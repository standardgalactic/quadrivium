Foreword
Have you ever heard the statement, “Doors and hardware are easy” or “Doors and hardware are unim-
portant”? Perhaps you’ve even made those statements yourself. Are those statements true?
Let’s consider the ﬁrst statement. I made that same statement before I researched the facts. There 
are thousands of products with millions of application combinations with building code compliance 
requirements. Suﬃce to say, doors and hardware are very complicated. Although they comprise 
approximately 2 to 3 percent of overall construction cost, doors and hardware typically comprise 25 to 
30 percent of all punch list items. 
Doors and hardware are also very important. Not only do they provide a protective barrier for people 
and property but more importantly, they save our lives! Think about what would happen if a raging ﬁre 
would not be stopped by a secure ﬁre door. Or how many times do we feel safe because we are behind 
a door locked to the outside? If we were in a building on ﬁre, we would go directly to the nearest exit. 
What if that exit didn’t open? Thousands of people in the twentieth century lost their lives because of 
nonexistent ﬁre and life safety codes and hundreds lost their lives as a result of noncompliance with 
existing codes. Yes, doors and hardware are very important—they save lives!
This publication is a guide on selecting proper doors and hardware by discussing functional options; 
building, ﬁre, and life safety codes; proper materials; durability grades; and materials, as well as aes-
thetic ﬁnishes. Read this publication and use it as a reference when designing a building. You too can 
save countless lives.

HOW THIS BOOK IS ORGANIZED
This book is based on the Door and Hardware Institute (DHI) Standard Sequence and Format for the 
Hardware Schedule. Although this standard states the information and format required of door hard-
ware schedules, it is also typically the same sequence and format used for specifying door hardware 
sets in project speciﬁcations.
There are many products, functions, applications, and component combinations that are available 
to be speciﬁed, furnished, and installed. The DHI Sequence and Format for the Hardware Schedule 
helps put order to the scheduling process to ensure that all applications, codes, and components are 
reviewed for proper operation, compliance, and function.
The Introduction describes the various associations, codes, standards, and practices of the industry, 
while the individual chapters follow the DHI Sequence and Format as follows:
t Hanging devices
t Securing devices
t Operating trim 
t Accessories for pairs of doors only 
t Closing and control devices
t Protective plates and trim
t Stops and holders
t Accessories
t Miscellaneous items
t Miscellaneous items (Yes, there are two categories for miscellaneous items.)
Each hardware device has the following sections, at minimum, with some devices having additional 
information:
t Also Known As—Any other industry or slang terms for the device
t Description—A brief overview of the device
t Properties—Various aspects of the device that create the whole
t Finishes—Color of the device

Introduction
The door opening industry aﬀects many parts of the construction process as well as the everyday user 
of the door opening. To be eﬀective, one needs to understand how each of the entities contributes and 
works individually and as part of the whole process. This Introduction will talk about various industry 
associations, such as the Door and Hardware Institute and the Construction Speciﬁcations Institute, and 
how they can help with the entire life cycle of a door opening and all of its touch points in the construc-
tion industry, from speciﬁcation writing and substitution requests to door hardware schedule writing 
and submittal reviews.
ASSOCIATIONS
With the continuous changes in the world of architecture, design, sustainability, energy eﬃciency, tech-
nology, and product improvement, associations are becoming a more important part of our everyday 
responsibilities in the workplace. Associations are where we go to meet people with diﬀerent roles and 
responsibilities who have the knowledge, experience, resources, products, networks, and connections 
to help us succeed in our professions.
AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS AIA
Founded in 1857, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) is a paid membership association for licensed 
architects, emerging professionals, and allied industry partners. With approximately 300 state and local 
chapters in the United States, the AIA hosts a continuing education program, and provides licensing, 
conventions, and networking events for its members.
AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE ANSI
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) was formed in 1916 and was the combined eﬀort of 
numerous entities, including the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (IEEE), the American Society 
of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the American Institute 
www.it-ebooks.info

XVI    |    INTRODUCTION
of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers (AIME), the American Society for Testing Materials (now ASTM 
International), and The U.S. Departments of War, Navy, and Commerce. The association was created to 
establish a national body to coordinate standards development and consensus approval of minimum 
standards.
The standards that ANSI develops are the minimum standards required for compliance. Some manufac-
turers go above and beyond the testing required, which can lead to a longer life cycle, fewer replace-
ments, less cost to the owner, less labor, and fewer materials in a landﬁll, contributing to a sustainable 
world.
AMERICAN SOCIETY OF INTERIOR DESIGNERS ASID
Founded in 1975, the American Society of Interior Designers (ASID) is the oldest and largest paid mem-
ber association, with over 30,000 members with careers primarily in interior design, industry product 
representation, and design education, and students of design. The association and its 48 chapters 
throughout the United States and Canada provide networking opportunities, educational events, and 
conventions for their members and guests of the industry.
ASIS INTERNATIONAL
Founded in 1955 and formerly known as the American Society of Industrial Security, ASIS International 
is a paid member association with over 38,000 members in 232 chapters worldwide. ASIS International 
is dedicated to providing education, conventions, and networking events in order to increase the eﬀec-
tiveness and productivity of security professionals around the world.
ASTM INTERNATIONAL ASTM
Founded in 1898 as the International Association for Testing Materials (IATM), ASTM International is 
committed to building a consensus on standards for industrial materials. The association sets the stan-
dards for testing of materials that are used in construction, including some door hardware.
BUILDERS HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION BHMA
Founded in 1925 as the Builders Hardware Manufacturers Statistical Association, the BHMA is known 
for its leadership with setting the minimum standards for door hardware. Most door hardware manu-
facturers are members of the BHMA and test their products to meet the minimum standards. With that 
said, there are manufacturers who test their products well above and beyond the minimum standards. 
This is an important fact to know when choosing door hardware to specify and install, as a proven 
longer life cycle will mean fewer replacements of product, which means less labor and less cost, and is 
sustainable by contributing less waste in a landﬁll.
The BHMA has partnered with the American National Standards Association (ANSI) to publish the ANSI/
BHMA A156 Series Standards, which are a numbered series of standards that address all door hardware 
and its minimum testing requirements to meet those standards. In order to be BHMA certiﬁed, you 
must adhere to and pass third-party testing to ensure the products meet the standards. If a product 
fails, it is no longer certiﬁed. It is important to verify that products are BHMA certiﬁed and not just 
tested to meet the requirements of BHMA.

CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS INSTITUTE CSI
Founded in 1948 by government agency speciﬁcation writers, the Construction Speciﬁcations Institute 
(CSI) was formed to improve the quality of construction speciﬁcations, which in turn means better-
quality construction. The institute expanded into the private sector and included design professionals, 
contractors, product representatives, and owners from the United States, who come together through 
chapter meetings, continuing education, conventions, and networking events to help each other share 
information beneﬁcial to the quality of construction. CSI has a sister organization in Canada by the 
name of Construction Speciﬁcation Canada (CSC).
In addition to other standards and formats, such as Page Format and UniFormat™, which is the orga-
nization of construction information based on function rather than material or method, OmniClass™ is 
a classiﬁcation system used to organize project information. CSI is probably most known for creating 
the speciﬁcations standard MasterFormat®, which is a master list of numbers and titles used to organize 
speciﬁcations and other project information by material type for most commercial projects. MasterFor-
mat® Section 08 71 00 Door Hardware is where all of the materials discussed in these chapters reside. 
Older versions of MasterFormat®, dated 1995 and prior, referred to the section as Finish Hardware or 
Door Hardware, and the numbering was only ﬁve digits, or 08710.
DOOR AND HARDWARE INSTITUTE DHI
With the roots of the institute dating back to 1934, the Door and Hardware Institute (DHI) is a paid 
annual membership–based association oﬀering discounts for all education, services, and literature to 
their members. DHI was formed from other industry associations, namely the National Builders Hard-
ware Association (NBHA) and the American Society of Architectural Hardware Consultants (ASAHC). 
As the industry resource for door opening standards, all industry professionals, including contractors, 
manufacturers, distributors, sales representatives, building oﬃcials, facility managers, architects, and 
others turn to DHI for education and certiﬁcation. Any person or company entering or working in the 
door opening industry would be wise to join the DHI.
DHI oﬀers certiﬁcation programs, which require an individual to attend and pass a minimum num-
ber of educational courses oﬀered by the organization. Once credentialed, members are required to 
take a minimum number of continuing education hours over a certain period of time to maintain the 
certiﬁcation.
Those who obtained their certification prior to the continuing education requirements are “grand-
fathered in” and do not have to take continuing education courses to maintain their certification 
status. In addition to the Architectural Hardware Consultant (AHC) certification, DHI offers a Cer-
tified Door Consultant (CDC) and a Electrified Hardware Consultant (EHC), and if one obtains all 
three certifications, they are replaced with one Architectural Openings Consultant (AOC) certifica-
tion, of which there are not many in the world today.
DHI also oﬀers certiﬁcation for other expertise such as the Fire Door Assembly Inspector (FDAI) pro-
gram. In 2007, NFPA 80 put into place an annual inspection of ﬁre doors, and soon after NFPA 101 fol-
lowed. Another, later, component to the annual inspection included Egress, and the standards state that 
a knowledgeable person is allowed to inspect these openings. The Door and Hardware Institute, along 
with Warnock Hersey/Intertek, have put into place a certiﬁcation and licensing program that teaches, and 
requires continuing education in, the proﬁciency that is required to be an expert in, such inspections.

INTERNATIONAL INTERIOR DESIGN ASSOCIATION IIDA
Founded in 1994, the International Interior Design Association (IIDA) is a paid membership asso-
ciation of 13,000 members and 33 chapters around the world. The IIDA is the result of the merging 
of three associations: the Institute of Business Designers (IBD), the International Society of Interior 
Designers (ISID), and the Council of Federal Interior Designers (CFID). The intent of the merger was 
to create a uniﬁed association with one mission: to represent interior designers around the world.
UNDERWRITERS LABORATORIES
Formed in 1894, Underwriters Laboratories (UL) was founded as the Underwriters’ Electrical Bureau, 
the Electrical Bureau of the National Board of Fire Underwriters, and was formed to test materials for 
safety. Today UL is a global third-party testing entity that continues to test materials for safe living and 
work environments.
UNITED STATES GREEN BUILDING COUNCIL USGBC
Formed in 1993, the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) is a paid membership associa-
tion that was formed to promote sustainable building design and construction. Today, the USGBC 
includes architectural ﬁrms, nonproﬁt associations, manufacturers, designers, and anyone else 
concerned with sustainability and how to improve our construction processes to save the earth’s 
resources and our lives. The USGBC formed the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design 
(LEED) rating system to help those involved in the construction process to select, design, and build 
projects to a set of minimum standards. Today these voluntary standards are becoming more and 
more a code requirement.
WARNOCK HERSEY
Warnock Hersey is a third-party testing entity that tests products to meet the minimum requirements 
of ﬁre testing, ﬁre door labeling, performance, and other testing. You would most commonly ﬁnd a 
Warnock Hersey label on a ﬁre rated door or frame.
CODES
Codes and standards are available to set the minimum requirements of door openings. Some local 
jurisdictions have speciﬁc codes and standards, which were either modiﬁed from another existing 
code, typically the International Building Code, for their own use.
Language and section numbers can change slightly or drastically when the codes are updated. Look for 
an outline, if available, of the changes that took place in the respective update. Many code updates occur 
on a three-year cycle, although some might be updated more or less often. Also, codes might not be 
adopted in their original version or in their entirety, but rather parts of the whole may be incorporated.
INTERNATIONAL GREEN CONSTRUCTION CODE IGCC
The International Green Construction Code (IGCC) is published by the International Code Coun-
cil (ICC), which was formed in 1994 as a nonproﬁt organization dedicated to developing a sin-
gle set of comprehensive and coordinated national model construction codes. The ICC was a

INTRODUCTION    |    XIX
combination of the Building Oﬃcials and Code Administrators International, Inc. (BOCA), the International  
Conference of Building Oﬃcials (ICBO), and the Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc. 
(SBCCI).
The International Green Construction Code was created as the ﬁrst model code to include sustainability 
measures for the entire construction project and site from design through construction and beyond 
through the entire building life cycle. The intent of the code is to make the design, construction, and 
maintenance of the buildings more eﬃcient. Reduced waste and positive impacts on health, safety, and 
welfare are the expected outcomes of sustainably focused construction.
INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODE IBC
The International Building Code (IBC) is published by the International Code Council (ICC), which was 
formed in 1994 as a nonproﬁt organization dedicated to developing a single set of comprehensive and 
coordinated national model construction codes. The ICC was a combination of the Building Oﬃcials 
and Code Administrators International, Inc. (BOCA), the International Conference of Building Oﬃcials 
(ICBO), and the Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc. (SBCCI).
The International Building Code is the standard building code typically used as a basis of design for a 
local jurisdiction to modify and adopt partially or as a whole. The code provides a standard consistent 
guideline for construction for all to adhere to as the minimum standard.
FINISHES
Hinges and pivots are available in just about every standard architectural hardware ﬁnish, from 
non-lacquered raw metal and primed for painting to satin chromium electro-plated and custom 
matched powder coat. Electro-plated clear coated/lacquered ﬁnishes are the most typically speci-
ﬁed and installed, and can be manufactured as polished (a mirror ﬁnish look) or brushed (a textured 
brushed look).
ANSI and the BHMA publish ANSI/BHMA A156.18 American National Standard for Materials and Fin-
ishes, 2006, and they refer to three ﬁnish designation systems: The National Bureau of Standards of the 
U.S. Department of Commerce (U.S.), Canadian (C), and Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association 
(BHMA). The BHMA ﬁnish designations give us more information in their number by not only telling 
us what the ﬁnish of the item is, but also including the base metal that was used to manufacture the 
product. This is important when specifying ﬁre rated openings, so that we have a steel-based metal as 
required by NFPA 80. Any other base metal, such as brass or bronze, would melt long before the time 
required by code, leaving the door vulnerable to ﬁre hazard.
For example, US26D is the U.S. designation for Satin Chromium Plated, while 626 is the BHMA desig-
nation for Satin Chromium Plated on Brass or Bronze base metal, and 652 is the BHMA designation 
for Satin Chromium Plated on Steel base metal. This is important to know when specifying, ordering, 
and installing hinges on ﬁre rated doors, as they require steel-based hinges per NFPA 80 (see Stan-
dards—NFPA 80).

GRADES
Most hardware devices are tested to meet multiple minimum criteria, and depending on the levels met, 
grades are applied. Grade 1 is the best-performing device passing the highest minimum standards, 
grade 2 is the next, and grade 3 is the lowest quality of the three.
Testing includes cycle testing, which is the performance of how many times a device can be “used.” 
For example, one cycle of a test would include a lever handle of a lockset being rotated to retract 
and extend a latchbolt. Another example is a door closer cycle; each time the door closer opens and 
closes is one cycle. Other tests include impact, where the devices are struck; weather or salt tests, 
where the devices are exposed to outdoor weather to see how long they will last, and the ﬁnish test 
to see how long the architectural ﬁnish on the device will resist wear and the test of time.
HANDING
Although many door hardware devices are not handed, there are many devices that are. Handing a 
device is determined by which way a door swings. A door hanging on the left and pushing away from 
you is a left-hand door and a door, hanging on the right and pushing away from you is a right-hand 
door. Reverse handed doors are the opposite, when a door is hanging on the left and pulls toward 
you, it is a left-hand reverse, and a door hanging on the right and pulling toward you is a right-hand 
reverse door.

INTRODUCTION    |    XXV
MATERIALS
CAST
A cast hardware device or component has typically been manufactured by melting metal or combina-
tions of metals to form a liquid, then pouring the liquid into a mold to create the device. Once the liquid 
cools, it creates a new solid object.
FORGED
A forged hardware device or component has typically been manufactured similarly to a wrought device 
by starting with a cast, then shaping the metal into either another object or a diﬀerent shape than the 
original. The diﬀerence between forged and wrought is that a wrought object is formed or rolled into 
its new shape while a forged object is hammered into shape, which causes the steel to become harder 
than wrought and less likely to crack when struck or striking another object. Forging can be done at dif-
ferent temperatures and is known by its type, for example, cold forging, warm forging, or hot forging.
STAMPED
A stamped hardware device or component has typically been manufactured by punching or stamping 
an object, usually metal, in order to bend, remove, or emboss the original object into another object or 
diﬀerent shape than the original. The process might take place with one object or device or multiple 
objects that are then attached to create the end result.
WROUGHT
A wrought hardware device or component has typically been manufactured similarly to a forged device 
by starting with a cast, then shaping the metal into either another object or diﬀerent shape from the 
original. The diﬀerence between wrought and forged is the fact that forged is hammered into shape, 
which causes the steel to become harder than wrought and less likely to crack when struck or striking 
another object, while wrought is formed or rolled into its new shape.
FIRE RATING
LABELS
Doors and Frames are typically installed into walls of a structure. Depending on the structure’s type, 
size, and occupancy, various ﬁre rated walls are required to compartmentalize the structure so that ﬁre 
does not spread through the entire structure without some type of protection to stop it from spreading 
from one area to another.
As such, doors, frames, and hardware must also carry a ﬁre rating also known as a ﬁre label. These rat-
ings are typically matched to the wall and ceiling ratings so that they have the same resistance as the 
surrounding elements. Labels are diﬀerent than listings; see Listings in this section.
Although doors must have a label to match a speciﬁc time frame as the walls do, such as a 3-hour or 
45-minute rating, frames and hardware are required to be ﬁre rated in general. Following are the most 
common ﬁre door ratings:
www.it-ebooks.info

XXVI    |    INTRODUCTION
A
An “A” label door, also known as a three-hour (3-hour) rated door, has been tested to withstand a ﬁre 
from penetrating or moving from one side of the door to the other, if closed and latched properly, for a 
minimum of three hours.  As of today, only metal doors can be manufactured to meet this rating.
B
A “B” label door, also known as a one-and-a-half hour (1-1/2-hour) rated door has been tested to keep a 
ﬁre from penetrating or moving from one side of the door to the other, if closed and latched properly, 
for a minimum of one-and-one-half hours.
C
A “C” label door, also known as a 45-minute rated door, has been tested to keep a ﬁre from penetrating 
or moving from one side of the door to the other, if closed and latched properly, for a minimum of 45 
minutes.
20 Minute
Twenty-minute (20-minute) doors were most typically used in corridors of educational facilities, but in 
current construction of these types of facilities, at a minimum 45-minute-rated doors are more typically 
required.
Smoke
Some ﬁre rated doors require a Smoke (S) rating in addition or in lieu of a ﬁre rating, depending on the 
construction, facility, and code type. This type of opening would prohibit or limit the amount of smoke 
being transferred from one side of the opening to the other.
LISTING
A hardware device most typically has a listing, which is usually governed and applied by the Under-
writers Laboratories (UL), (see UL under Standards earlier in this Introduction.) The listing requires cer-
tain devices to operate in a certain manner for certain applications; one example is panic hardware on 
egress doors being required in places of occupancy by more than 50 people at a time.
SPECIFICATIONS
Speciﬁcations can be written many diﬀerent ways using many diﬀerent methods, and there can be 
many right answers.  Following are some speciﬁcation types, methods, and mediums by which a proj-
ect can be speciﬁed.
FORMATS
The Construction Speciﬁcations Institute (CSI) developed and continues to maintain various docu-
mentation standards that are used by the architect to create project speciﬁcation documents to com-
plement the drawings or visual representation of the drawings. A typical speciﬁcation is created in 
three-part format, either in MasterFormat® 95 or 2004, and can be written as proprietary, open, or ANSI, 
and in a 2D or 3D medium.

INTRODUCTION    |    XXVII
PageFormat
PageFormat is a standard arrangement of information through consistent numbering in each division, 
in each section, and on each page of a speciﬁcation manual. For example, each section starts with PART 
1—GENERAL, 1.1 Summary, A. Section Includes or relevant instructions, and ends with PART 2—EXECU-
TION, 3.3 Adjusting or the relevant instructions.
MasterFormat®
MasterFormat® is a standard that uses a unique numbering system to organize information for build-
ing projects. This format went through a major update in 2004, referred to as MasterFormat® 2004, and 
receives updates every couple of years. Although created long before with many updates since, the 
version prior to 2004 is typically referred to as MasterFormat® 95.
95
MasterFormat® 95 is a 16 Division format with ﬁve-number sections. For example, door hardware is 
located in Division 8, Section 08700, and is named Hardware. Within this division and section, there 
are other formats used to create consistent page layout and references, known as OmniClass™, 
PageFormat.
2004
MasterFormat® 2004 is a 50-division format with six-number sections. For example, door hardware is 
located in Division 08, Section 08 71 00, and is named Door Hardware. Within this division and section, 
there are other formats used to create consistent page layout and references, known as OmniClass™, 
PageFormat. MasterFormat® 2004 allows for all of the technological and product advancements made 
over the years, and now has a place for them to be speciﬁed, whereas in the older versions some of 
these newer products had to be speciﬁed in sections where they did not belong, or in what was known 
as the Phantom Division 17, which was created randomly by various ﬁrms or entities to have a place for 
items that did not have a place of their own.
Three Parts
Each speciﬁcation document section typically has three parts in order to categorize the data consis-
tently throughout the project speciﬁcation documents; this way the data is in the same area each time 
you look, no matter what type of product or process you are looking at. Speciﬁcations for any products 
or processes should be speciﬁed once, in one place, and should be clear, correct, concise, and complete. 
Repetition can lead to conﬂicts, varying interpretations, and errors.
PART 1
Part 1 General typically describes the general requirements of a project, including the procedures, 
administration, and any requirements speciﬁc to the section written. Part 1 also typically refers back to 
and clariﬁes any Division 01 requirements such as substitution requests.
PART 2
Part 2 Products typically describes the products, including any materials and equipment that is required 
for the project. Part 2 also typically describes any speciﬁc manufacturers, product numbers, ﬁnishes, 
and functions required for the project as a whole or speciﬁc to an opening type. Most product types 
require at least three equal products of the same type, grade, and function speciﬁed to allow for com-
petitive bidding and the best value for the owner.
www.it-ebooks.info

XXVIII    |    INTRODUCTION
PART 3
Part 3 Execution typically describes the various applications and installations, including any pre- or 
postconstruction cleaning, protection, and anything to do with onsite fabrication.
UniFormat™
UniFormat™ is a classiﬁcation system for organizing construction information during the preliminary 
stages of design. By starting out with a standard format, it is easier and more intuitive to create the 
construction speciﬁcations from this early project document.
MEDIA
Door hardware speciﬁcations can be written in various media, but the most prominent approaches are 
2D or 3D.
2D
2D speciﬁcations are written conventionally in some type of word processor format. This can be done 
“long hand” in a word processing program or via door hardware speciﬁcation or submittal-writing soft-
ware that exports the data to a 2D word processing document.
3D
3D speciﬁcation is a newer medium to create the information required. This information is an add-
on to the overall design software and allows the 3D data, known as door libraries, to be exported 
out of the 3D software and models. Once the data is extracted, it can be manipulated, incorporated 
with details and data speciﬁc to that project, opening, function, and surrounding conditions, and 
then be imported back into the 3D environment or model as one of the contributing objects to the 
whole.
TYPES
Descriptive
Descriptive speciﬁcations are written as a detailed description of the requirements of the speciﬁc type 
of hardware. This includes the material, function, ﬁnish, and application. Descriptive speciﬁcations do 
not use manufacturers’ names or model numbers.
Nonrestrictive
Nonrestrictive speciﬁcations are written speciﬁcally to prohibit proprietary speciﬁcations and to allow 
competitive bidding and the best value for the owner’s money. Nonrestrictive speciﬁcations can be 
written in descriptive, performance, or reference standard format, as long as more than one manufac-
turer can meet those requirements.
Performance
Performance speciﬁcations are written as a detailed requirement of the end results without speciﬁc 
material and processes being described. This allows for any methods or means as long as the required 
end results are achieved. This can be both good and risky, and new types of products or means might 
be created to achieve these results, giving something new and not seen or used before. At the same 
www.it-ebooks.info

INTRODUCTION    |    XXIX
time, employing something not used before means it has no track record of performance, just the test-
ing required to meet the standards speciﬁed.
Proprietary
Proprietary speciﬁcations are written with a speciﬁc manufacturer, brand, and model number without 
any other manufacturers or products allowed. This might be the case when an existing facility, say a 
healthcare campus, has their standards, stock of the components for any nonfunctioning hardware, 
and the training to ﬁx it. This makes it easier than starting a new wing of a hospital with brand-new 
hardware manufacturers and types of hardware to learn and maintain. Proprietary speciﬁcations and 
projects are typically only allowed when the money or owner funding the project is private and not 
public. By specifying proprietary items, the owner will likely pay more for the items as there is no com-
petition during the bidding stage—the hardware required is single source, so the supplier can charge 
a bit more than for something being competitively bid.
Reference Standard
Reference standard speciﬁcations are written with a speciﬁc type or function in mind, but not neces-
sarily a speciﬁc aesthetic or manufacturer. Door hardware reference standard speciﬁcations would be 
written around American National Standard Institute/Builders Hardware Manufacturer’s Association 
(ANSI/BHMA) standards.
STANDARDS
A standard is enforceable when an Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ), a local, federal, or other entity 
having jurisdiction over law, adopts the standard as a whole itself, or references the standard in another 
adopted law, such as a state building code. The most commonly referenced standard in just about 
every building code is National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 80, Standard for Fire Doors and Other 
Opening Protectives, 2010, or the most current version (see Standards, Fire/Smoke). Some standards are 
updated on a consistent cycle, typically every three years (NFPA 80, 2007, was the version prior to 2010 
and 2013 will be the next version).
Standards are typically referred to as the minimum standard and are not always that impressive when 
it comes to cycle, grade, or any other minimum requirement. That said, although there are minimum 
standards, there are some manufacturers, products, and solutions that go above and beyond these 
minimums, some at the same or minimal additional cost, so do your research and rely on true consul-
tants who can oﬀer opinions on any and all products and solutions. These types of products not only 
oﬀer better value for cost, but also oﬀer other positive aspects to the owner and environment by being 
a sustainable solution, for example, having to replace a mortise lock after 15 million cycles instead of 
the typical minimum standard of 1 million, which both meet the minimum standard.
ACCESSIBILITY
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was created to set guidelines for accessibility to places of 
public accommodation and commercial facilities by individuals with disabilities. These guidelines are to 
be applied during the design, construction, and alteration of such buildings and facilities to the extent 
required by regulations issued by federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.
www.it-ebooks.info

XXX    |    INTRODUCTION
ADAAG—The Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a landmark law that protects the civil rights of persons with 
disabilities. ADAAG serves as the basis for standards used to enforce the design requirements of the 
ADA. These standards are maintained by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Department 
of Transportation (DOT).
ICC/A117.1 Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities
ICC/A117.1 is available for adoption and use by jurisdictions internationally. Its use within a government 
jurisdiction is intended to be accomplished through adoption by reference in accordance with pro-
ceedings establishing the jurisdiction’s laws.
International Green Construction Code (IGCC)
The International Green Construction Code (IGCC) is published by the International Code Council (ICC), 
which was formed in 1994 as a nonproﬁt organization dedicated to developing a single set of com-
prehensive and coordinated national model construction codes. The ICC was a combination of the 
Building Oﬃcials and Code Administrators International, Inc. (BOCA), the International Conference of 
Building Oﬃcials (ICBO), and the Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc. (SBCCI).
NFPA 1, Fire Code
Although NFPA created and maintains their own ﬁre code, it is not widely used or adopted, where the 
preferred code is from the International Code Council (ICC).
NFPA 70, National Electric Code
Adopted in all 50 states, NFPA 70 is the standard for safe electrical design, installation, and inspection 
to protect people and property from electrical hazards. Please refer to the most recent version of NFPA 
70 for current and complete information.
NFPA 80, Standard for Fire Doors and Other Opening Protectives
NFPA 80 regulates the installation and maintenance of assemblies and devices used to protect open-
ings in walls, ﬂoors, and ceilings against the spread of ﬁre and smoke within, into, or out of buildings.  
Please refer to the most recent version of NFPA 80 for current and complete information.
ASTM INTERNATIONAL
(Formerly Known as the American Society for Testing and Materials)
A globally recognized leader in the development and delivery of international voluntary consensus 
standards that works in an open and transparent process and using ASTM’s advanced electronic infra-
structure, ASTM members deliver the test methods, speciﬁcations, guidelines, and practices that sup-
port industries and governments worldwide.
UNDERWRITERS LABORATORY UL
Underwriters Laboratory (UL) is an independent safety company innovating solutions for many of the 
items that we use every day, from electricity to sustainability and renewable energy. UL is dedicated 
to testing safe environments to help safeguard people. There are many UL standards that aﬀect doors 
and door hardware.

INTRODUCTION    |    XXXI
SUBMITTALS
Hardware schedules, also known as submittals, are typically created from architectural project speci-
ﬁcations and drawings, which are created by an architect. Hardware schedules are created from the 
speciﬁcations typically by a door and hardware distributor employee. The schedule is typically submit-
ted to the project general contractor or construction manager, who submits it to the project architect 
for approval prior to ordering and delivering to the jobsite.
While a vertical schedule is typically speciﬁed and preferred by an architect, this standard describes 
both horizontal and vertical formats. Project speciﬁcations typically specify that hardware schedules 
are required to be created by a certiﬁed Architectural Hardware Consultant (AHC), who is certiﬁed 
by DHI.
SUBSTITUTIONS
If product substitution requests are allowed from what was originally speciﬁed, the request process 
is typically speciﬁed in Division 01 of the project manual, otherwise known as the speciﬁcations. The 
substitution request requirements are typically asking for product data and proof that the requested 
substitution will meet the same grade, function, application, aesthetic, and quality of the originally 
speciﬁed product. It is recommended that all substitution requests be submitted within the procedures 
as outlined in Division 1, Section 01 25 13 Product Substitution, and on Construction Speciﬁcations 
Institute (CSI) Substitution Request Forms.
As mentioned in the Standards section earlier in this Introduction, be cautious of what is considered an 
equal as standards refer to the minimum standard, but there are some manufacturers, products, and 
solutions that go above and beyond these minimums.
It is recommended that substitution requests and approvals not be taken lightly as sometimes the 
substitution is proposed or taking place to strictly save money or to become more competitive on a bid 
to win the project contract to supply the door hardware. Although it is not always the case where you 
get what you pay for, it is typically the case with door hardware. If you are saving money on an item, 
it is likely that the item is not of the same standards and quality as the originally speciﬁed device.  The 
quality substitution can be one of a few types, for example, furnishing a hinge with a cheaper-quality 
ﬁnish or rough edges as compared to a better-quality ﬁnish and square ﬂush edges.
SUSTAINABILITY
Some manufacturers contribute to sustainability with the way they source materials, manufacture 
products, and run and maintain factories and oﬃces. There are new practices taking place known as 
Health Product Declarations (HPD) and Environmental Product Declarations (EPD). These new practices 
provide transparent information about products, which include their materials and eﬀects on the living 
beings who are in contact with the items. HPDs and EPDs are almost like the cereal box labels that list 
the ingredients of products and their health eﬀects. A life-cycle analysis is also becoming a common 
practice, giving the product an expected lifespan of use.

As discussed in the Introduction, the ﬁrst type of device addressed in the Door and Hardware 
Institute’s Sequence and Format for the Hardware Schedule is the hanging device. Although not 
typically a highlight of the door opening, the hanging device is one of the most important components. 
Supporting the entire weight of the door from the top, bottom, side, or a combination, the hanging 
device is relied on for its precise and consistent pivot point swing or slide, and is probably the most 
actively used door opening component.
Depending on the type of door, its function, and application, doors can be hung onto a door frame, 
onto a framed opening, or directly on a wall. A swinging door can be hung on hinges, continuous 
hinges, pivots, or ﬂoor closers, while a sliding door can be hung on tracks and hangers suspended from 
the top underneath the head of a framed opening, on the face of the wall, or supported by the ﬂoor 
from underneath the door. The most eﬃcient and eﬀective way to hang a door would be any means 
supported by the ﬂoor rather than the frame or wall. This creates less or no tension on the frame or wall 
where the door by nature is pulling away, whereas a door supported by the ﬂoor is resting on top and 
has no tension at all.
Although a swinging door is the most common type, sliding door options and use have increased over 
recent years because of their functionality, space-saving ability, and aesthetics.
HINGES
Also Known As: Butts, Butt Hinges, Standard Hinges
DESCRIPTION
Hinges are manufactured to accommodate various door sizes, thicknesses, weights, new and existing 
conditions, and ﬁre ratings. Special hinge applications are available for speciﬁc situations, which 
include healthcare and those that have particular aesthetic needs, sound requirements, or door and 
frame applied materials.

Finishes, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.)
PROPERTIES
Hinges are typically manufactured with two leaves that have alternating knuckles, which meet to form 
a barrel, and a hinge pin holds the leaves together as one. This gives a hinge the ability to rotate or 
swing a door into the open or closed position.
A hinge pin typically has a ﬂat tipped end so that it rests against the top of the hinge barrel so that 
the pin does not fall through. With that said, although most commercial hinges are manufactured 
with pins that are “nonrising,” they still have the ability to rise if nothing is holding them in place as a 
nonremovable pin option (see Nonremovable Pin in the hinge options section of this chapter). Other 
pin options are what are known as fast pins, which are more diﬃcult to remove in the ﬁeld as they are 
either riveted or threaded into the barrel, similar to the way a screw is with threads. This type of pin 
might be most desirable on out-swinging, or reverse bevel, doors so that the pins cannot be easily 
removed, the door taken oﬀ its hinges, and the opening left unsecure.
Although the majority of barrels are round, some manufacturers oﬀer square barrel hinges for a 
diﬀerent aesthetic. Screw holes are typically countersunk, unless one is using a special hinge type such 
as the slip-in hinge (see Slip-In under Types in this section).
Bearings
Also known as anti-friction bearings, these are hinges that are manufactured with bearings separate 
the metal of the knuckles, keeping them from directly touching and pivoting on each other. The inserts, 
which can be plastic, ball bearings or oil-impregnated bearings, create a barrier between the metal parts, 
eliminating metal friction, which causes less wear on the knuckles than a nonbearing hinge would.
BALL BEARING
Ball bearing hinges are manufactured with a metal ring inserted in between each knuckle of the barrel 
with ball bearings inside each ring, very similar to the wheels of roller skates, which help them roll more 
smoothly and with less friction. Most commonly, the ball bearing rings are visible, creating additional 
shear lines in the appearance.
www.it-ebooks.info

HANGING DEVICES    |    3
Available as an option from some manufacturers are concealed bearing hinges, where the bearings are 
concealed in larger knuckles, which are visually similar to nonbearing butt hinges.
Standard weight hinges typically have two rings of ball bearings on the barrel whereas heavy weight 
hinges typically have four. Per building codes and standards, ﬁre rated doors must be installed with 
butt hinges that have a minimum of two ball bearings.
NONBEARING
Nonbearing hinges allow the knuckles of the barrel to directly meet, pivoting on each other with 
nothing to prevent the metal from wearing excessively. This is more likely on frequently used door 
openings than on infrequently used ones, such as a closet or bedroom door in a home.
OILIMPREGNATED BEARING
Oil-impregnated bearing hinges are manufactured with a metal ring insert in between each pair of 
knuckle of the barrel with oil inside each ring instead of ball bearings. These rings of oil act similarly to 
ball bearings and protect the knuckles of the hinge barrel from touching each other directly, helping 
to reduce excessive wear.
Corners
ROUND CORNER
Some hinges are available with rounded corners as an option; these are typically used for residential 
doors and frames, although you may come across them on a commercial project or two. The round 
corner can either be a speciﬁc model number or an option to a model number allowing you to change 
the square edge to round.
SQUARE CORNER
Most hinges are manufactured standard with square edges with 90-degree corners. Be cautious when 
handling the hinge, the corner can be sharp at the point.

Finishes
Depending on the manufacturer’s availability, hinges are typically available in all architectural 
hardware ﬁnishes. Depending on the aesthetic and cost choices made, sometimes hinges are speciﬁed 
with plated or solid metal ﬁnishes to match the locking and/or other hardware on the opening. Prime-
coated hinges are also available, which are less expensive than a plated ﬁnish and are typically painted 
the same color and at the same time as the door, frame, and surrounding areas.
Painting hinges or anything on site is not recommended as it will contribute to poor air quality for those 
currently and eventually working in the space. Using a manufacturer’s factory ﬁnish might even help 
contribute to credits toward a current or future green building standard, code, or certiﬁcation.
Grades
Although hinges are typically referred to in weights, ANSI/BHMA A156.1 American National Standard 
for Butts and Hinges have minimum standards and hinges are graded with various tests. Cycle testing, 
hinge pin rise, hinge play to test the movement of a ﬁxed hinge, vertical and lateral wear, an electrical 
hinge test, and ﬁnish tests are the main tests. Cycle testing shows the following as minimum grade 
requirements for cycle testing:
t Grade 1: 2,500,000 cycles
t Grade 2: 1,500,000 cycles
t Grade 3: 350,000 cycles
Imagine getting a grade 3 product when specifying a grade 1 due to poor substitution practices. Be 
sure to check each item delivered against the approved speciﬁcations and submittals for compliance 
of quality.
Hole Preparations
NONTEMPLATED
Nontemplated hinges are manufactured without standard fastener hole locations and the holes can be 
at any location on the hinge leaves. These hinges tend to be less expensive and are typically used for 
residential applications.

HANGING DEVICES    |    5
TEMPLATED
Templated hinges are manufactured with standard fastener hole locations on the hinge leaves. 
These standard locations are detailed in the ANSI/BHMA Standard A156.7–2003 for Template Hinge 
Dimensions. This standard is typically referenced in commercial construction projects speciﬁcations 
(see the Introduction of this book for more information on ANSI/BHMA).
Knuckles
Hinges can be manufactured with diﬀerent knuckle quantities. The diﬀerent knuckle quantities that 
form the barrel give the barrel diﬀerent appearances.
FIVEKNUCKLE HINGES
A hinge with ﬁve knuckles is typically the most widely used type of butt hinge. One leaf of the hinge has 
three knuckles and the other leaf has two, which ﬁt together to form a barrel. The hinge barrel is held 
together by inserting a hinge pin down the center of the barrel from one end to the other.
THREEKNUCKLE HINGES
Three-knuckle hinges are another widely used option, where one leaf has two knuckles, one each at the 
top and bottom ends of the leaf. The other leaf has one large knuckle in the center and, when pieced 
together with the other half, a three-knuckle hinge barrel is formed. The hinge barrel is held together 
by inserting a hinge pin down the center of the barrel from one end to the other.
TWOKNUCKLE HINGES
Two-knuckle hinges are also referred to as Paumelle Hinges (see Paumelle Hinges in this section). A 
two-knuckle hinge with a conventional barrel will have a very streamlined clean look where there are

only two long “knuckles” forming the barrel. Typically, rather than a pin being inserted into the barrel, 
the bottom half of the leaf of the barrel has a pin attached to it protruding out of the barrel on one side. 
The top hinge leaf barrel is hollow and, with the help of gravity keeping the two leaves together to form 
the full barrel, the top leaf slips onto the pin of the bottom leaf.
Unlike ﬁve- and three-knuckle hinges, which can be used on any handed opening, left hand or right 
hand, two-knuckle hinges are handed and have to be speciﬁc to the door swing. It would be impossible 
to install a left-hand hinge on a right-hand door, as the pin would be sticking down instead of up with 
nothing to support the bottom leaf.
Materials
Hinges are manufactured from various materials including steel, brass, bronze, or stainless steel. The material 
type speciﬁed and installed can depend on the door opening application and ﬁre rating requirements.
If a door opening is ﬁre rated, the codes state that hanging devices must be manufactured of steel to 
withstand the high temperatures of a ﬁre for a certain period of time, depending on the surrounding 
wall rating. If anything other than a steel base hinge is installed on a ﬁre rated door opening and a ﬁre 
occurs, the hinge metal might melt enough to cause the opening to fail, allowing the ﬁre to spread from 
one side of the opening to the other prematurely.
When choosing a base metal, one should also take into account rusting. Brass and bronze base metal 
hinges will not rust at all, whereas steel hinges are prone to rust, and although stainless steel can rust, 
it is more resistant than steel.
Although you might see aluminum hinges on some light-duty doors, it is not optimal for door openings 
due to the softness of the metal. Aluminum does not rust as steel does, but it does oxidize and corrode, 
which gives the appearance of rusting without the rust color. Aluminum hinges are typically clear 
coated to help prevent the oxidation.

Ratings
NONFIRE RATED
Nonﬁre rated hinges can only be used on doors and frames that are not ﬁre rated openings. These 
hinges can be manufactured from brass or bronze base metals.
FIRE RATED
Fire rated hinges can be applied to both ﬁre rated or nonﬁre rated doors and frames. These hinges can 
only be manufactured from steel or stainless steel base metals.
Sizes
The hinge size typically follows the model number, so once you have decided on the manufacturer, 
type, knuckle conﬁguration, and bearing type, and the door size, material, and frequency; it is time to 
determine the proper hinge size.
The ﬁrst number in the size of a hinge typically refers to the hinge height, while the second number 
refers to the hinge width. For a typical 1 3/4-inch-thick door, the hinge size would typically be 4 1/2 
inches by 4 1/2 inches, which means the hinge leaves are 4 1/2 inches high and 4 1/2 inches wide with 
the hinge leaves in the open position.
For thicker doors and doors and/or frames with plant-on materials on the faces such as panels, thicker 
hinges might be required to clear the added materials. The calculation for ﬁguring out the optimal 
hinge width is to deduct the backset (dimension between the edge of the door and the edge of the 
hinge leaf) of the hinge on the door from the door thickness, multiply the balance by 2, and add 
any additional clearances such as the thickness of an applied panel. The dimension might end up in 
the middle of a standard hinge size oﬀering; if you come across this situation, round up to the next 
available size.
Swaging
Hinge leaves are typically swaged. Swaging is a slight oﬀset of the hinge leaf at the barrel. The oﬀset 
accounts for the door edge, which is typically beveled. A beveled door edge is typically required for 
swinging doors so that the door edge does not bind with the square edge of the frame. If both edges 
were square, the door would not ﬁt into the frame.

HANGING DEVICES
When in the parallel position, most hinge swaging provides a 1/16-inch clearance between the hinge 
leaves to accommodate for the door and frame clearance, which allows the door to swing in and out of 
the door frame without binding.
Weights
Although hinges are categorized in grades by ANSI/BHMA A156.1 American National Standard for 
Butts and Hinges, they are also referred to as weights—standard and heavy. The optimal hinge weight 
depends on the door’s  width, weight, and frequency of use, and there are industry, code, manufacturers’ 
and standards charts to help guide us to the correct choice. In addition to weights, a hinge can be 
manufactured with diﬀerent quality levels, depending on its source, factory, and sometimes the 
standards of the country in which it is manufactured.
Some manufacturers still manufacture hinges in the United States, which are typically of superior 
quality to those manufactured in some other countries, known in the industry as imports. Imports 
are available for the most typical and widely used sizes, namely, for 3-foot-wide, 7-foot-high, and 
1 3/4-inch-thick wood or metal swinging doors. The hinges are less expensive than those still made in 
the United States and the lower quality can sometimes be noticed with ragged edges, poor ﬁnishes, 
and less than optimal performance.
Due to the competitive nature of the door opening industry, some of the U.S. manufacturers now sell 
similar hinges in quality and cost in order to compete on projects.
STANDARD WEIGHT
Standard weight hinges are manufactured with 0.134-inches-thick material and are typically speciﬁed 
and installed on the majority of commercial wood and metal doors and frames.
HEAVYWEIGHT
Heavyweight hinges are similar to standard-weight hinges in the manufacturing process and design, 
except they are manufactured at 0.180 inches in a thicker gauge metal and are more substantial than 
standard-weight hinges.
Heavyweight hinges are recommended for speciﬁcation and installation on wider, thicker, and more 
frequently used door openings to help the door withstand the higher use and abuse it might encounter 
in its extensive use.

TYPES
Anchor
Typically fully mortised and furnished in sets of three, an anchor hinge is manufactured similarly to a 
standard mortise hinge. The diﬀerence is that the top hinge of the set is manufactured with two ﬂat 
metal plates with screw holes that rest ﬂat on top of the door and against the head of the frame. The 
plates are screwed down and up in place, in a sense anchoring the hinge to the door and frame where 
the most tension, or pulling away from the frame, typically occurs.
Although not commonly used and a unique aesthetic where the hinge is installed at the very top 
of the edge of the door (instead of 5–1/2 inches to 7 inches down from the top of the door as with 
most standard hinges), the use of an anchor hinge could possibly help sustain an opening’s lifespan 
by supporting some of the weight of the top of the door by being attached to the head of the frame 
instead of the top of the hinge jamb.
Blank Plate
Hinge blank plates are available to ﬁt the preparation for a templated mortised hinge leaf, which 
might not be used anymore. A preparation might need to be ﬁlled with a blank if a door is removed 
from the opening altogether and no door will hang in the opening anymore or if the existing mortise 
preparation has weakened and is not suﬃcient to hold the weight of a door hung on the mortise hinge 
it was intended to. In this case, a hinge blank would ﬁll the preparation and a surface-mounted hinge 
could hang the door instead.

Detention Hinge
Typically used on prison cell doors or very high security metal pass-through doors used in courthouses or 
other types of detention facilities. One would think that this would be the perfect place for a high-security 
fastener, when in fact these hinges are typically welded onto the surface or faces of the metal door and frame.
Friction
Friction hinges are used to hold a door open at any angle of the door swing. The friction is caused by bearings 
or discs manufactured into the knuckles, which that can be adjusted to create diﬀerent friction levels.
Invisible Hinge
Unlike any conventional hinge and available from a limited number of manufacturers, invisible hinges 
are named just as they appear on the door and frame in the closed position, invisible. This gives the

appearance that there is no hinge installed at all and the hinge cannot be seen unless the door is in the 
open position. When in the open position, on the edge of the door and frame you can see the face of 
the hinge and the screws.
As with conventional hinges, there are various options available, depending on the door size and 
frequency of use, including spring and electric transfer hinge options. Although only visible when the 
door is in the open position and depending on the manufacturer, invisible hinges are available in most 
standard architectural hardware ﬁnishes.
Lightweight
Lightweight hinges are typically used for residential or very light-duty and frequently used door opening 
applications. Most lightweight hinges are not template are plain bearing, and have rounded corners.
Olive Knuckle
Typically fully mortised, olive knuckle hinges have a similar appearance to intermediate pivots with one 
knuckle in the center of the device. Oval in shape, resembling an olive, the knuckle joins the two leaves 
of the hinge together, and they are typically rated grade 2 by their manufacturers and are intended to 
be used on low-frequency, decorative, residential door openings such as interior French doors. The 
hinge leaves are typically narrow and might be able to carry less door weight than standard hinges with 
limited door size varieties.

FIGURE 1.18 Olive Knuckle Hinge

Paumelle Knuckle
Paumelle hinges are hinges that have one knuckle—whether round, rectangular, or olive in shape—
where one center knuckle joins the two leaves of the hinge together with a pin sticking out of the 
bottom half. The top half rests on top of the bottom, with gravity keeping the two halves together. Pau-
melle knuckle hinges are typically used on low-frequency, decorative, residential door openings such 
as interior French doors, and the hinge leaves are typically narrow and able to carry less door weight 
and door size varieties than standard butt hinges.
Pivot Reinforced
Similar to an anchor hinge, a pivot reinforced hinge has two ﬂat metal plates with screw holes that rest 
ﬂat on top of the door and against the head of the frame. The plates are screwed down and up in place, 
in a sense anchoring the hinge to the door and frame where the most tension, or pulling away from the 
frame, typically occurs.
Raised Barrel
Typically, a full mortise hinge and used when a door is recessed in a reveal in a frame, the hinge barrel is 
oﬀset to allow a door to swing on an oﬀset pivot point. When a door is recessed in a frame, a standard 
full mortise hinge barrel would not sit ﬂush against the frame and door leaving a gap and an incorrect, 
ineﬃcient butt hinge installation causing the door and frame to bind. By oﬀsetting the hinge barrel, 
the hinge barrel sits away from the frame edge, creating a new pivot point for the door, which prevents 
binding and results in a smooth, free-swinging door.
Slip-In
Unlike a typical hinge, slip-in hinges are manufactured without countersunk screw holes on the hinge 
leaves because they literally slip into a pocket behind either the hinge edge of the door, the frame, 
or both. Typically used with aluminum doors and frames, slip-in hinges might provide additional 
www.it-ebooks.info

HANGING DEVICES    |    13
reinforcement for both sides of the hinge leaf. The faces of the pockets on the door and frame would 
typically be drilled and tapped with countersunk screw holes at the time of manufacturing.
Spring
Spring hinges are manufactured most commonly 4–1/2-inches high by 4–1/2-inches wide for commer-
cial applications. Instead of a conventional pin in the barrel, a spring in tension inside the solid barrel of 
the hinge keeps the hinge leaves pulling together toward the closed position. This allows the tension to 
force the hinge leaves together when pulled apart as the door swings away from the frame, essentially 
closing the leaves of the hinge and the door into the frame when let go.
The disadvantage of a spring hinge is the lack of door control due to the spring hinge having only one 
adjustment, which either tightens or loosens the spring tension and closing force. When spring hinges 
are used on doors, it is not uncommon for the doors to either not close all of the way all of the time or 
slam shut harder than desired. In addition to only having one adjustment available, the surrounding

conditions such as air pressure, air conditioning, and heating at diﬀerent times of the day and year will 
aﬀect the closing force.
If you have spring hinges, especially in commercial applications, be prepared to adjust them frequently, 
depending on the frequency of use. It is recommended that a door closer be used in lieu of a spring 
hinge when possible due to the typical various valves that oﬀer stages of closing. This assists with con-
trolling the closing force to ensure proper closing and latching of the door into the frame as desired or 
required by code.
Per NFPA 80, if spring hinges are used on 3-foot by 7-foot by 1 3/4-inch ﬁre rated doors, at least two of 
the three hinges provided must be spring type.
In addition to standard-sized spring hinges, there are other types including, a large single-barrel spring 
hinge, sometimes referred to as a “Bommer hinge.” Although there are numerous manufacturers, Bom-
mer is one of the oldest and most well-known manufacturers of large single-barrel spring hinges. These 
hinges can typically be seen on older city apartment doors.
Another type of spring hinge is a double-acting spring hinge, which is typically installed on double-
acting doors. A double-acting door is typically used in restaurant kitchens for easy in and out access for 
the staﬀ, and if speciﬁed and installed correctly, will return the door to the closed position every time.
Strap Hinge
Strap hinges are used for oversized doors such as barn doors. One leaf is typically installed as a standard 
hinge, and the other is not really a leaf, but a strap that is installed across the face of the door.
Some screen or storm doors appear to have strap hinges installed on them, but typically they are a 
decorative plate that is installed on the face while another hinge is actually hanging the door, typically 
a continuous hinge.

Swing Clear
A swing-clear butt hinge is typically used to swing a door out of the opening in order to increase the 
clear width opening of a doorway or corridor. The clear width of the opening is typically increased 
by the same dimension as the thickness of the door. For example, if a door is 1 3/4-inches thick and

a swing-clear butt hinge is used, the clear width of the opening is increased by 1 3/4-inches to allow 
for more room to travel through the opening. This application is typically seen in cross-corridor 
door openings both voluntarily and by code to allow for stretchers, carts, wheelchairs, and people 
to travel through the opening. This allows for extra room without having to navigate a standard 
width, possibly getting caught up on or hitting the edge of the door while in the open position.
The swing-clear hinge is diﬀerent from a typical butt hinge, which remains in the path of the door 
opening when in the open position (see Figures 1.27 and 1.28). Building codes and accessibility stan-
dards state that the clear width opening of a doorway must be a minimum of 32 inches. You might 
now ask, what deﬁnes a clear width opening? Good question; a clear width opening is the clear open 
space to pass through the door opening when measuring with the door open at 90 degrees, measured 
between the face of the door and the opposite stop face of the frame.
Tee Hinge
Tee hinges are manufactured in the shape of a tee, and are typically used for light-duty doors such as 
a screen door of a home. The top part of the tee is sideways and gets mounted to the frame like a butt 
hinge, and the longer portion lays across the front of the door similar to a strap hinge.
Wide Throw
A wide throw butt hinge has hinge leaves that are wider than standard sizes and typically wider than the 
height. A standard butt hinge for a 1 3/4-inch-thick door is 4 1/2-inches high by 4 1/2-inches wide, and if the 
door were to have an applied panel to the face, the width of the hinge would have to be the same dimen-
sion wider than 4 1/2 inches to clear the applied panel, or the butt hinge barrel would bind. For example, if 
the panel were 1/2-inch thick, then the hinge would be speciﬁed 1/2 inch wider to accommodate and allow 
the barrel of the hinge to clear the panel for proper operation without binding.

OPTIONS
Air Transfer
This option is available for the transfer of air for pneumatic devices, although by far it is not a common 
application and there is a lack of availability of devices. Locking and exit devices that are operated by 
the use of pneumatic air might be used in rooms that do not allow electricity due to the presence of 
explosive materials.
A more common use for pneumatic air is for automatic operators (see Chapter 5, Closing and Control 
Devices), but the air transfer required is typically much higher than an air transfer hinge would allow 
and is typically done directly to the device with wider tubing.
Decorative Tip
Decorative tips are available as an option to give the plain ﬂat ends of a hinge some aesthetic appeal. The tips 
are typically installed at both ends of the hinge barrel and may require special pins with screws that protrude 
out of the tip. Some tips have threaded pins attached and are screwed into the ﬂat end of the barrel. Although 
various manufacturers oﬀer other types of decorative tips, the following are some of the more popular:
t Acorn tips: Shaped like an acorn, these tips have a rounded body with a soft pointed top.
t Ball tips: Shaped just like they sound, round like a ball
t Linear tips: With decorative grooves, some manufacturers offer unique aesthetics.
t Round tips: A rounded end that looks like the shape of a dome
t Steeple tips: Tall and shaped like the steeple of a church or temple, these tips resemble the same.
t Urn tips: Similar to a steeple tip near the top, an urn tip is wider and more rounded in the center.
Electric Transfer
Hinges are available with wires running through them, and electric transfer hinges are available for 
electric locking or release devices. An electriﬁed lockset on a single door or a pair of doors or an electric

strike on a pair of doors would require a device, which would transfer the power from the wall into the 
hinge leaf on the frame, through the barrel of the hinge and leaf on the door, and across the door to 
the electric device.
Depending on the function of the electriﬁed system on the door opening, electric transfer hinges are 
available with various wire quantities. A simple system would only require four wires, while a more 
complex system or added options such as a signal switch might require as many as twelve.
Also, electric transfer hinges are intended to operate with low-voltage and amperage devices. If they 
are too high, there is a danger of overheating and damaging the devices that they operate, and this 
creates the danger of a ﬁre. If the devices do require higher voltage, a power transfer device is required 
(see Chapter 10, Miscellaneous Items).
Some manufacturers furnish electriﬁed transfer hinges with nonproprietary Molex® connectors, 
which are plastic connectors that are coordinated with the electriﬁed hardware and power supplies. 
This allows all of the company’s electriﬁed devices to be manufactured with Molex® connectors, 
allowing any two devices to quickly and easily snap together like a plug-and-play device on your 
computer.

Hospital Tip
Hospital tips on butt hinges are an available option to create a smooth, ﬂush, and sloped tip of the 
hinge barrel. This option is typically used in mental health facilities to reduce the gaps or spaces of the 
hinge. This helps to minimize an object having the ability to be tied or wedged in between the barrel 
and hinge leaf, creating a hanging situation.
Nonremovable Pin
Nonremovable pins (NRPs) are an option recommended for hinges used on secure doors that are 
reversed bevel, doors that swing and are pulled toward the user in lieu of pushing them away. The key-
word here is “option”; hinge barrel pins are standard as removable and NRPs must be speciﬁed.
A nonremovable pin is a very inexpensive option—approximately $2 per hinge—and consists of a set 
screw on the inside of the hinge barrel, which is only visible and accessible while the door is open. NRPs 
prevent the possibility of the pin being popped out of the barrel with a hammer and screwdriver. Once 
the pin is out of the barrel, the door can essentially be pulled out of the frame from the hinge side, even 
if the door latch or deadbolt is in the locked position. An expensive mistake can be avoided for such a 
small cost if a nonremoveable pin hinge is used as necessary.

Nonrising Pin
Nonrising hinge pins are most typically used on commercial hinges, which means the pin will resist 
rising up out of the barrel with each rotation of the door and hinge leaves. This will help to reduce the 
hinge pin “rising” up out of the hinge barrel after frequent use of the door. Keep in mind that a pin that 
has risen out of the barrel can aﬀect the performance of the hinge and level swing on the door.
Rising Pin
Rising pins are typically seen on residential doors and are less expensive than commercial hinges. You 
might typically notice the hinge pin “rising” up out of the hinge barrel after frequent use of the door. 
Keep in mind that a pin that has risen out of the barrel can aﬀect the performance of the hinge and level 
swing on the door.
Security Stud
Security stud hinges prevent the hinges from being separated while in the closed position, where the 
pins are removable and can be popped out of the barrel. One leaf has a physical metal stud sticking out 
of it, while the matching position on the other leaf has a hole to accept it; this way, if someone tries to 
cut oﬀ the barrels of the hinge and pull the leaves apart, in essence pulling the door out of the frame, 
the security stud will not allow the leaves to separate.
Signal Switch
Sometimes referred to as a door position switch, each hinge leaf has a magnetic switch installed on the 
back side, which meets when the door and hinge are in the closed position. When the leaves split apart 
as the door swings open, the switch sends a signal to the security system, alerting one that the door is 
in the open position. This does not indicate, however, whether or not the lockset latch is in the latched 
or locked position, but there are other devices available for that function.

QUANTITIES
Hinges are typically installed in consistent quantities; two hinges per leaf for openings through 60 
inches to door height. One additional hinge per leaf for each additional 30 inches in height or fraction 
thereof, and four hinges for Dutch doors up to 90 inches in height. You might ask why four hinges for 
a Dutch door. A Dutch door is a split-leaf door that has a top half and bottom half that swing indepen-
dently from each other. In order for the doors to swing at all, they need at least two hinges each to do 
so. There is no such thing as a split hinge.

APPLICATIONS
Full Mortise
Full mortise butt hinges are the most commonly installed type of butt hinge in new and most renova-
tion type construction projects. Both of the hinge leaves are swaged and fully mortised into the edge 
of the door and frame allowing the hinge to sit ﬂush with the edge of the door and frame.
Full Surface
Full surface butt hinges do not have swaged leaves and are surface-mounted onto the face of the door 
and frame, and there are two typical reasons why a full surface butt hinge would be installed. The ﬁrst 
would be the use of a channel iron door and frame, which are so dense that they would typically not 
have a mortise preparation and hinge due to the intensive labor required and diﬃculty of doing so.
The second reason why a surface-mounted butt hinge might be used is in lieu of replacing a door or 
frame, which can be costly. Full surface butt hinges are used on an existing opening whose door and 
or frame preparation reinforcements have loosened, prohibiting a new hinge from being installed into 
the same preparation.
Although a surface-mounted butt hinge would be applied to a new location of the door and frame, 
being on the surface, the hinge would still be able to maintain the same pivot point as the existing full 
mortise hinges. (The pivot point is the center of the hinge barrel, which would need to be consistent 
from hinge to hinge up and down the edge of the door in order for the hinges to swing freely.)
Keep in mind, however, that, although you will have a smooth swinging door just as if the original 
hinge were in place functionally, aesthetically the diﬀerence would be seeing the actual leaves of the 
hinge spread across the face of the door or frame instead of just the barrel at the edge. The frame leaf

is typically shorter than the door leaf, as a frame face is typically 2 inches wide, which is not enough 
room for a standard 4 1/2-inch-wide hinge leaf.
Half Mortise
“Half” butt hinges always refer to the door portion of the opening. Half mortise butt hinges have a 
swaged leaf on the door side, and similar to a full mortise hinge, are mortised into the edge of the door. 
The frame hinge leaf, similar to the full surface hinge, is not swaged and is surface-mounted onto the 
face of the frame.

There are two typical reasons why a half mortise butt hinge would be installed. The ﬁrst would be the 
use of a channel iron frame, which is so dense that it would typically not have a mortise preparation and 
hinge due to the intensive labor required and diﬃculty of doing so.

to be replaced, which can be costly. They are often used on an existing opening whose frame

Keep in mind, however, that, although you will have a smooth swinging door just as if the original hinge 
were in place functionally, aesthetically the diﬀerence would be seeing the actual door leaf of the hinge 
spread across the face of the door rather than just the barrel at the edge.
INSTALLATION
Hinges may require the use of shims during installation to ensure a ﬂush, plum installation. If the door 
opening is ﬁre rated, there are speciﬁc requirements as to the type and installation of the shims.
Although hinges are the most commonly used means of hanging a door, they are also the least expensive 
and the least eﬃcient. Because they are installed at various points on the frame’s jamb and the door’s hinge 
side of a door with nothing supporting the door from the bottom, a door on hinges is always in tension, 
“pulling” away from the frame. Further, every time a door is swung open or closed, more tension is created, 
pulling on the screws within the reinforcements of the door and frame that hold the hinges in place.
Depending on the frequency of door swing use, a door may show and operate with signs of early wear, 
such as separation of the door from the frame starting at the top, and separation of the hinge leaf from 
the hinge preparation on either the door or frame. Once this happens, the door typically sags, pulling 
more and more as the tension grows, quickly becoming an issue for swinging, closing, latching, and 
securing the opening.
Fasteners
Hinges are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood or metal door and 
frame material installation. Phillips and ﬂat head are available depending on the manufacturer’s 
standard, and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, security stud, 
and torx.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.

Locations
Hinges should be installed at locations as recommended by industry standards and codes, which are 
typically measured from the ﬁnished ﬂoor. Depending on the door and frame type, whether consid-
ered standard or custom metal, wood, or aluminum, standards recommend starting the ﬁrst hinge 
from the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
CUSTOM STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Custom steel doors and frames are recommended to have hinges installed 10 inches above the ﬁnished 
ﬂoor with the center hinge equal in distance from the top and bottom hinges (or additional center 
hinge, depending on the door height), and the top hinge is recommended to be located 5 inches from 
the top of the door.
STANDARD STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Standard steel doors and frames are recommended to have the hinges installed anywhere up to 13 
inches above the ﬁnished ﬂoor but, depending on the manufacturer, can be at any location up to that 
height. The middle hinges are installed equal in distance from the top and bottom hinges (or additional 
center hinge, depending on the door height), and the top hinge is recommended to be located up to 
11 3/4 inches from the top of the door.
FLUSH WOOD DOORS AND FRAMES
Flush wood doors and frames are recommended to have hinges in the same locations as custom 
steel doors and frames, with the bottom hinge installed 10 inches above the ﬁnished ﬂoor and 
the center hinge equal in distance from the top and bottom hinges (or additional center hinge,

depending on the door height). The top hinge is also recommended to be located 5 inches from the 
top of the door.
Preparations
Hinge preparations are typically machined at the factory, including the drilling and tapping of screw 
holes. With metal doors and frames, the preparation is typically a cutout in the location where a hinge 
will go, and then a reinforcement plate is welded in place, which is where the hinge and screws will 
actually be secured.
When using a heavyweight hinge, the thicker gauge metal means that the materials to be mortised 
into a door are thicker, which means that the door and frame preparations have to be deeper than a 
standard hanging device to accommodate the thicker metal.

CONTINUOUS HINGES
Also Known As: Piano Hinges
DESCRIPTION
Sometimes referred to as piano hinges, continuous hinges are a more eﬃcient means of hanging 
a door than a standard hinge. This is true because the continuous hinge’s length covers the entire 
height of the door and frame, which, unlike a hinge, supports the door’s full height. Along with hav-
ing many more fasteners on a continuous hinge, this helps prevent sagging from the top where most 
of the tension of the opening exists with the screws always trying to pull away from the edge of the 
door and frame.
Continuous hinges are also typically more secure than standard hinges because of the full door and 
frame height installation. This makes it much more diﬃcult to pry apart the door and frame on the 
hinge side. It is true that air ﬂow might be more restricted on the continuous hinge side of a door, but 
without proper weatherstripping or gasketing, there would not be much energy eﬃciency advantage 
to using a continuous hinge.
PROPERTIES
Similar to standard hinges, continuous hinges are manufactured with two leaves, except they are typi-
cally the same size in length as the door and frame height instead of small points on the door as with 
standard hinges. Continuous hinges are available as two types, geared or pin and barrel.
Bearings
Bearings separate the metal of the knuckles from directly touching and pivoting on each other. The 
inserts create a barrier between the metal parts, eliminating metal friction, which causes less wear on 
the knuckles than would a nonbearing hinge.
NONBEARING
Nonbearing hinges allow the knuckles of the barrel to directly meet, pivoting on each other with noth-
ing to prevent the metal from wearing excessively. This is more likely on frequently used door openings 
rather than infrequently used ones, such as a closet or bedroom door in a home.
MEDICAL BEARING
Medical bearing continuous hinges are manufactured as barrel type hinge with a plastic insert separating 
the metal knuckles keeping them from directly touching. Not only do these inserts help with preventing 
FIGURE 1.55 Standard vs Continuous Hinge 
Installation

HANGING DEVICES    |    29
wear of the knuckles from the metal touching metal, but these inserts also assist with the resistance to air 
ﬂow between the hinge knuckles, which can transfer air particles from one room to another.
Corners
SQUARE CORNER
Continuous hinges are manufactured “standard” with square edges with 90-degree corners. Be cau-
tious when handling the hinge, as the corner can be sharp at the point.
Finishes
Continuous hinges are typically available in fewer ﬁnishes than standard hinges and the choices are 
limited, depending on the base metal of the hinge. Painting continuous hinges (or anything else for 
that matter) on a project site is not recommended, as it will contribute to poor air quality for those 
working and in the space. Using a manufacturer’s factory ﬁnish might even help contribute to credits 
toward a green building certiﬁcation or code now or in the future.
ALUMINUM BASE METAL
Although some manufacturers offer additional finish options, aluminum continuous hinges are 
typically available from the factory with a clear anodized finish (US 628), dark bronze anodized

(US 313), light bronze anodized (US 311), black anodized (US 315), and various powder-coated paint 
finishes, which are typically more durable than a conventional architectural finish and can be 
scratch resistant.
STEEL BASE METAL
Steel-based hinges are typically manufactured with a prime gray powder-coated ﬁnish, which is typi-
cally more durable than a conventional architectural ﬁnish, can be scratch resistant, and is intended to 
be painted in the ﬁeld to match the door or surrounding conditions.
STAINLESS STEEL BASE METAL
Stainless steel hinges are typically available from the factory with a polished stainless steel ﬁnish 
(US 629) or satin stainless steel ﬁnish (US 630). With surface-mounted continuous hinges, although the 
hinge itself, which is connected to the door, is stainless steel, the housing, or the metal that covers the 
screws to give the hinge a cleaner appearance, might be manufactured with aluminum material with a 
brushed aluminum or clear-coated anodized aluminum ﬁnish (US 628).
Some manufacturers also oﬀer various powder-coated paint ﬁnishes, which are typically more durable 
than a conventional architectural ﬁnish and can be scratch resistant.
Geared
Geared hinges have two leaves with alternating gears on each leaf that ﬁt together to form the rotat-
ing portion of the hinge, which is typically covered by rectangular full-length housing. Geared hinges 
are typically manufactured with aluminum material and have the ability to carry lighter, less frequently 
used door weights than a pin and barrel type continuous hinge (see Grades in this chapter).

Hole Preparations
BLANK
Blank plates are available, which are continuous hinges without holes. They would typically be used in 
a hinge perimeter welded installation instead of securing the hinge to the door and frame with screw 
fasteners.
CUSTOM HOLE PATTERN
If for some reason a custom hole pattern is desired or required, some manufacturers oﬀer that option 
for an additional cost due to the custom setup that will have to take place to create the custom hole 
pattern.
NONTEMPLATED
Nontemplated hinges are manufactured without standard fastener hole locations and holes can be 
placed at any location on the hinge leaves. These hinges tend to be less expensive and are typically 
used for residential applications.
PLUG WELD
In addition to the perimeter welding with a blank hole preparation, plug weld holes allow welding to 
take place within the body of the hinge in addition to the perimeter. Holes are drilled into the surface 
of the hinge leaves and the welds are made through the hole to the door surface, further bonding the 
two together.

32    |   HANGING DEVICES
SYMMETRY TEMPLATED
Symmetry templated hinges are manufactured with equally patterned hole locations on the hinge 
leaves. Since door manufacturers typically do not drill and tap holes on the doors and frames for con-
tinuous hinges, there are no standard locations required as with standard hinges, as described in the 
ANSI/BHMA standards.
Materials
Continuous hinges can be manufactured from aluminum, brass, bronze, steel, or stainless steel, 
depending on their type, application, and ﬁre rated door-opening requirements. If a door opening is 
ﬁre rated, the codes state that hanging devices must be manufactured of steel to withstand the high 
temperatures of a ﬁre for a certain period of time, depending on the surrounding wall rating.
If anything other than a steel-based continuous hinge is installed on a ﬁre rated door opening and a ﬁre 
occurs, the continuous hinge metal might melt enough to cause the opening to fail, allowing the ﬁre to 
spread from one side of the opening to the other.
Pin and Barrel
Pin and barrel hinge leaves form the barrel of the hinge, similarly to a standard hinge, giving the door 
edge a more conventional hinge look than a gear-type hinge. Pin and barrel hinges typically hold more 
weight and withstand higher use and frequency than a geared continuous hinge.
Sizes
Continuous hinges are typically available for standard door heights such as 6 feet 8 inches, 7 feet, 7 
feet 2 inches, 7 feet 6 inches, 8 feet, and so on, up to 10 feet. The hinges are typically manufactured 1 
inch shorter in length than the actual door height to allow the door to close into the frame without any

binding. If the hinge were the full height of the door, the hinge metal would bind behind the stop of 
the frame. Frame stops protrude into the door opening and, if the hinge is closed into the frame at full 
height, the hinge metal thickness would interfere with the door closing fully.
Continuous hinge leaves are various in widths depending on the type. A full mortised or ﬂush edge 
mount would be enough to extend the thickness of the door, less the inset dimension (typically 1/8 
inch), which is the distance between the edge of the door and back and of the hinge leaf.
Swaging
Continuous hinge leaves are typically swaged. Swaging is a slight oﬀset of the hinge leaf at the bar-
rel. The oﬀset accounts for the door edge, which is typically beveled. A beveled door edge is typically 
required for swinging doors so that the door edge does not bind with the square edge of the frame. If 
both edges were square, the door would not ﬁt into the frame.
When in the parallel position, most hinge swaging provides a 1/16-inch clearance between the hinge 
leaves to accommodate for the door and frame clearance, which allows the door to swing in and out of 
the door frame without binding.
Weights
Continuous hinges are not categorized in grades as with most architectural hardware. They are avail-
able in diﬀerent gauges, which is the thickness of the metal. They could also be considered light, 
medium, and heavyweight, depending on the thickness and amount of door weight they can hold.
With that said, continuous hinges can be manufactured with diﬀerent quality levels, depending on the 
source and factory and possibly country standards.
Some manufacturers still manufacture continuous hinges in the United States, which are typically of 
superior quality to those manufactured in some other countries, known in the industry as imports.

34    |   HANGING DEVICES
Imports are available for the most common and widely used sizes, typically for 3-feet-wide, 7-feet-high, 
and 1 3/4-inch-thick wood or metal swinging doors. The continuous hinges are less expensive than 
those still made in the United States and the low quality can sometimes be noticed with ragged edges, 
poor ﬁnishes, and suboptimal performance.
Due to the competitive nature of the door opening industry, some of the U.S. manufacturers now sell 
at the same level and price point of these continuous hinges to compete on projects through the dis-
tribution marketplace.
LIGHTWEIGHT
Lightweight continuous hinges would not typically be used on a commercial application but more likely on a resi-
dential or an infrequently used door or cabinet, or on a piano door (continuous hinges are also known as piano 
hinges). A lightweight continuous hinge is typically manufactured from aluminum, brass, or steel but can be of a 
thinner gauge than a medium or heavyweight continuous hinge for commercial applications.
MEDIUM/STANDARD WEIGHT
Medium-weight continuous hinges would typically be manufactured with 14-gauge material (.075 
inch) with the ability to carry standard door weights up to 400 pounds with certain applications with 
restrictions allowing 600 to 1,000-pound infrequently used lead-lined doors.
HEAVYWEIGHT
Heavyweight continuous hinges would typically be manufactured with 12-gauge material (.105 inch) 
with the ability to carry heavy door weights up to 900 pounds.
Welded End Pins
This option is to tack weld the pins so that they become nonremovable to secure the opening when 
the door is out-swinging and the barrel is visible and able to be tampered with. The pins are attached 
to the ﬁxed end knuckles of the hinge leaves so that the welding does not interfere with the rotation 
of the hinge barrel.
TYPES
Adjustable
An adjustable continuous hinge is a solution for those not-so-perfect installations, or existing situations 
where the surrounding conditions may have been altered since the original construction. These hinges 
do just what their name says: adjust to meet not-so-perfect conditions. If you have a frame or a door 
that is not ﬂush, is out of alignment or is sagging, or the clearances have been altered over time, an

adjustable hinge will allow you to close the uneven gaps at the edge of the door and frame as required 
to get a ﬂush installation. Keep in mind that the adjustments are limited and vary, depending on the 
manufacturer.
Edge Mount Safety Guard
Edge mount safety guard continuous hinges are available to protect the edge of a door in addition 
to hanging it. The hinge has additional metal, which wraps the edge of the door slightly to the face, 
protecting the edge from carts or stretchers as they go through the door opening. These hinges are 
also available as adjustable to meet not-so-perfect conditions. If you have a frame or a door that is not 
ﬂush, is out of alignment or sagging, or the clearances have been altered over time, an adjustable hinge 
will allow you to close the uneven gaps at the edge of the door and frame as required to get a ﬂush 
installation.
Raised Barrel
Typically a full mortise hinge and used when a door is recessed in a reveal in a frame; the hinge barrel is 
oﬀset to allow a door to swing on the oﬀset pivot point. When a door is recessed in a frame, a standard 
full mortise hinge barrel would not sit ﬂush against the frame and door, leaving a gap and an incorrect, 
ineﬃcient butt hinge installation, causing the door and frame to bind. By oﬀsetting the hinge barrel, 
the hinge barrel sits away from the frame edge, creating a new pivot point for the door, which prevents 
binding and a smooth, free-swinging door.
Spring
Spring continuous hinges are manufactured in some of the same sizes as standard continuous hinges, 
except with a spring in tension inside the barrel of the hinge. This allows the tension to force the hinge 
leaves together when pulled apart as the door swings away from the frame, essentially closing the 
leaves of the hinge and the door into the frame when let go.
The disadvantage to a spring hinge is that it only has one adjustment by tightening or loosening the 
spring tension, and the doors will typically either not close all the way all of the time or slam shut more 
than desired due to all of the surrounding conditions such as air pressure, air conditioning, and heating 
levels at diﬀerent times of the day and year.
If you have spring hinges, especially on commercial applications, be prepared to adjust them often, depend-
ing on the frequency of use. It is recommended that a door closer be used in lieu of a spring hinge when

possible because of the various valves that oﬀer stages of closing. This assists with controlling the closing 
force to ensure proper closing and latching of the door into the frame as desired or required by code.
Swing Clear
A swing-clear continuous hinge is typically used to swing a door out of the opening in order to increase 
the clear width opening of a doorway. The clear width of the opening is typically increased by the same 
dimension as the thickness of the door. For example, if a door is 1 3/4-inches thick and a swing-clear 
butt hinge is used, the clear width of the opening is increased by 1 3/4 inches to allow for more room 
to travel through the opening. This application is typically seen in cross-corridor door openings both 
voluntarily and by code to allow for stretchers, carts, wheelchairs, and people to travel through the 
opening. This allows for extra room without having to navigate a standard width opening, possibly 
getting caught up on or hitting the edge of the door while it is in the open position.
A typical continuous hinge remains in the path of the door opening when in the open position (see Figure 
1.68). Building codes and accessibility standards state that the clear width opening of a doorway must be 
a minimum of 32 inches. You might now ask, what deﬁnes a clear width opening? Good question. A clear 
width opening is the clear open space to pass with the door opening when measuring with the door 
open at 90 degrees, measured between the face of the door and the opposite stop face of the frame.

To explain further, let’s go through an example opening using a 36-inch-wide, 1 3/4-inches-thick hol-
low metal door and frame swinging on a standard mortise continuous hinge. Using the code to guide 
us as to where to measure, we come to the clear width dimension by deducting the door thickness, 
which is 1 3/4 inches, plus the width of both stops of the frame, which is typically 5/8-inch thick each, for 
a total of 3 inches. Deduct 3 inches from the original door width of 36 inches, and that leaves a 33-inch 
clear-width opening, which complies with the codes and standards. In addition, there are also restric-
tions regarding projections of door hardware into the clear width, so that it does not interfere with the 
clear-width requirement.

Using the same situation as described above, if we were working on a major renovation of an exist-
ing building, which was constructed prior to the required minimum clear-width openings of today’s 
codes and had 34-inch-wide openings, we would not meet the minimum clear-width requirements if 
we replaced the hinges with standard butt hinges using the same formula as above, which only give us 
a 31-inch clear-width opening. This can be a very costly renovation, having to rip out all of the doors and 
frames, widen the openings, and install new doors and frames to meet the requirements.
This is how a swing-clear hinge can help save cost and meet the required codes. If we start with the 
same 34-inch-wide door opening, use the same formula as above, but use swing-clear continuous 
hinges instead of standard continuous hinges, we can increase the clear width by the door width, which 
is 1 3/4 inches, increasing our 31 inches to 32 3/4 inches, meeting the required codes.
OPTIONS
Automatic Door Bottom Cut
When using an automatic door bottom, depending on the type and size, special cutouts might be 
required to accommodate the location of the door bottom so that it does not conﬂict at the same loca-
tion on the door.
Current Transfer Preparation
Continuous hinges are available with cutouts to accommodate electric power transfer devices for 
easy installation and access for maintenance or replacement (see Chapter 2, Securing Devices). Power

transfers are similar in function to an electric transfer hinge but are able to transfer higher voltage and 
amperage than can an electric transfer hinge.
Custom Design
Some manufacturers will custom make a continuous hinge to your design requirements as long as they 
comply with all required standards and codes. Of course, this would be for an additional cost.
Dutch Door Preparation
Dutch door continuous hinges are manufactured speciﬁcally for Dutch doors, which are single doors 
that are split horizontally. These doors are typically used for some type of pass-through and might have 
a shelf on the bottom leaf, as with a coat check room. A conventional continuous hinge is just that, 
continuous and would not allow a split door to open, whereas a Dutch door hinge is split and allows the 
top and bottom leaves to swing freely and independently.

Electric Transfer
Continuous electric transfer hinges are available with wires running through them and are an option for 
transferring power and powering electric locking or release devices on a door. An electriﬁed lockset on 
a single door or pair of doors or an electric strike on a pair of doors would require a device, which would 
transfer the power from the wall into the continuous hinge leaf on the frame, through the barrel of the 
continuous hinge and leaf on the door, and across the door to the electric device.
Depending on the function of the electriﬁed system on the door opening, electric transfer continu-
ous hinges are available with various wire quantities. A simple system would only require four wires, 
while a more complex system with added options, such as a signal switch, might require as many as 
twelve wires.
Also, electric transfer continuous hinges are intended to operate with low-voltage and low-amperage 
devices. If voltage or amperage are too high, there is a danger of overheating and damaging the devices 
and those that they operate, and it creates the danger of a ﬁre. If the devices do need higher voltage, a 
power transfer device is required (see Chapter 10, Miscellaneous Items).

HANGING DEVICES    |    41
Some manufacturers furnish electriﬁed transfer continuous hinges with nonproprietary Molex connec-
tors, which are plastic connectors that are coordinated with the electriﬁed hardware and power supplies. 
This allows all of the company’s electriﬁed devices to be manufactured with Molex connectors, allowing 
any two devices to quickly and easily snap together like a plug-and-play device on your computer.
Hospital Tip
Hospital tip continuous hinges are available to create a smooth, ﬂush, and sloped tip of the hinge barrel 
without any gaps or spaces that would allow something to be wedged in between the barrel and hinge 
leaf. These continuous hinges are typically installed on openings in mental health facilities to reduce 
the possibility of a patient harming him- or herself by tying a string around the hinge barrel to create 
a hanging situation.

Lead Lined
Continuous hinges are not actually lead lined, but the fastener hole pattern on each leaf is set in a way 
so as not to interfere with the lead lining of a door and frame. If the fasteners were to penetrate the 
lead lining in either the door or frame, it would create a hole in the lead and radiation could escape 
through the hole to the other side of the opening where the protection for those passing by would be 
eliminated.
Security Stud
Security studs prevent the hinges from being separated while in the closed position. One leaf has a 
physical metal stud sticking out of it, while the matching position on the other leaf has a hole to accept 
it; this way, if someone tries to cut oﬀ the barrels of the hinge and pull apart the leaves, in essence pull-
ing the door out of the frame, the security studs will not allow the leaves to separate.
The studs might also extend into the back of the door hinge leaf, which means that the door leaf itself 
has to be prepared to accept the studs recessed into it.
Sheared Leaf
Sheared leaf continuous hinges are available for narrow door thicknesses or frame rabbets. You must 
specify the desired dimension so that the factory can shear the leaves of the hinges to suit your special 
application.
Signal Switch
Sometimes referred to as a door position switch or monitoring switch, each hinge leaf has a mag-
netic switch installed on the back side, which meet when the door and hinge are in the closed posi-
tion. When the leaves split apart as the door swings open, the switch sends a signal to the security

system, alerting one that the door is in the open position. This does not indicate, however, whether 
or not the lockset latch is in the latched or locked position, but there are other devices available for 
that function.
Special Lengths
Although continuous hinges are typically available in standard lengths to accommodate standard door 
heights, some manufacturers oﬀer custom lengths for an additional cost.
Wide Throw
A wide throw continuous hinge has hinge leaves that are wider than standard sizes and typically wider 
than they are high. If the door were to have an applied panel to the face, the width of the hinge would 
have to be the same dimension wider than a standard hinge leaf to clear the applied panel, or the con-
tinuous hinge barrel would bind. For example, if the panel were 1/2 -inch thick, then the hinge would 
be speciﬁed 1/2 -inch wider to accommodate and allow the barrel of the hinge to clear the panel for 
proper operation without binding.
QUANTITIES
Continuous hinges are typically furnished one per door leaf. There are options for a Dutch door con-
tinuous hinge, which is split at the door split. Another option for a Dutch door would be to install two 
separate continuous hinges, one for the top leaf and one for the bottom.
APPLICATIONS
Full Mortise/Edge Mount
Full mortise continuous hinges are the most commonly installed type of continuous hinge in new and 
most renovation type construction projects. Both of the hinge leaves are swaged and fully mortised 
into the edge of the door and frame, allowing the hinge to sit ﬂush with the edge of the door and frame.
Full Surface/Flush Mount
Full surface continuous hinges do not have swaged leaves and are surface-mounted onto the face of the 
door and frame. There are two typical reasons why a full surface continuous hinge would be installed. 
The ﬁrst is the use of a channel iron door and frame, which are so dense that they would typically not 
have a mortise preparation and hinge due to the intensive labor required and diﬃculty of doing so.

FIGURE 1.78 Full Surface Continuous Hinge

www.it-ebooks.info

44    |   HANGING DEVICES
The second reason why a surface-mounted continuous hinge might be used is in lieu of replacing a 
door or frame, which can be costly. This type of hinge can be used on an existing opening whose door 
and or frame preparation reinforcements have loosened, prohibiting a new hinge from being installed 
into the same preparation.
Although a surface-mounted continuous hinge would be applied at a new location on the door and 
frame, being on the surface, the hinge would still be able to maintain the same pivot point as the exist-
ing hinges. (The pivot point is the center of the hinge barrel, which would need to be consistent from 
hinge to hinge up and down the edge of the door in order for the hinges to swing freely.)
Keep in mind however, that, although you will have a smooth swinging door just as if the original hinge 
were in place functionally, aesthetically the diﬀerence would be seeing the actual leaves of the hinge 
spread across the face of the door or frame instead of just the barrel at the edge.
Half Mortise
When speaking of half continuous hinges, the “half” always refers to the door portion of the opening. 
For example, half mortise continuous hinges have a swaged leaf on the door side, and are mortised 
into the edge of the door. The frame door butt hinge leaf is not swaged and is surface-mounted onto 
the face of the frame similarly to a full mortise continuous hinge. The frame leaf is usually shorter 
than the door leaf, as a frame face is typically only 2 inches wide, which is not enough room for a 
standard 4 1/2-inch-wide hinge leaf. There are two typical reasons why a half mortise continuous 
hinge would be installed. The ﬁrst would be the use of a channel iron frame, which is so dense that 
it would typically not have a mortise preparation and hinge due to the intensive labor required and 
diﬃculty of doing so, which is why a half continuous butt hinge would be applied. Another reason 
why a half mortise continuous hinge might be used is for an existing opening whose frame prepara-
tion reinforcements have loosened and failed, which would prohibit someone from being able to 
screw a new hinge into the same preparation. A half mortise continuous butt hinge would be applied 
to a new location on the frame, on the surface, which would maintain the same pivot point as the 
existing hinges, both not requiring the existing cutout and preparation for support and saving the 
frame from having to be replaced, which can be costly. Keep in mind, however, although this is a cost 
savings, the aesthetics will not be the most pleasing, seeing the entire hinge on the face of the frame 
instead of just the barrel.
Half Surface
Half continuous hinges always refer to the door portion of the opening. Half surface continuous hinges 
have a swaged leaf on the door side, and similar to a full surface hinge, are mortised into the edge of 
the door. The frame hinge leaf, similar to the full surface hinge, is not swaged and is surface-mounted 
onto the face of the frame.
There are two typical reasons why a half surface continuous hinge would be installed. The ﬁrst would 
be the use of a channel iron frame, which is so dense that it would typically not have a mortise prepara-
tion and hinge due to the intensive labor required and diﬃculty of doing so.
The second reason why a half surface continuous hinge might be used is in lieu of a replacing frame, 
which can be costly. Another instance where it would be appropriate to use a half surface continuous 
hinge might be when an existing opening has frame preparation reinforcements that have loosened, 
prohibiting a new hinge from being installed into the same preparation.

Although a half surface continuous hinge would be applied to a new location of the frame, being the 
surface, the hinge would still be able to maintain the same pivot point as the existing hinges.
Keep in mind, however, although you will have a smooth swinging door just as if the original hinge 
were in place functionally, aesthetically the diﬀerence would be seeing the actual frame leaf of the 
hinge spread across the face of the frame instead of just the barrel at the edge.
INSTALLATION
Continuous hinges are the second most commonly used and expensive type of hanging device. 
Because they are typically installed the same as the full height of the door, unlike standard hinges, 
the weight of the door is distributed along the entire height instead of various points of the door.
Similar to one with standard hinges, the door still has nothing supporting it from the bottom, so the 
tension still exists, albeit it is less than with standard hinges.
Although less than with standard hinges, depending on the frequency of door swing use, a door may 
show and operate with signs of early wear, separation of the door from the frame starting at the top, 
and separation of the hinge leaf from the hinge preparation on either the door or frame. Once this hap-
pens, the door typically sags; pulling more and more as the tension grows, quickly becoming an issue 
for swinging, closing, latching, and securing the opening.
Fasteners
Continuous hinges are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood or metal 
door and frame material installation. Phillips and ﬂat head are available, depending on the manufac-
turer’s standard, and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, security stud, 
and torx.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.
Locations
Continuous hinges are typically placed along the length of the entire door height less 1 inch to avoid 
binding with the stop on the frame. As with all hardware applications, check to see if there are any 
conﬂicts such as a protection plate being installed with a surface-mounted continuous hinge. Adjust

the protection plate width accordingly so the surface continuous hinge has a ﬂat smooth surface 
upon which to install.
Preparations
Continuous hinges do not require any special preparations at the edge of the door other than rein-
forcements and the door being manufactured narrower to accommodate for the installation for a full 
mortise hinge.
Screw holes are not typically drilled and tapped at the factory, especially for wood doors, unless spe-
ciﬁcally requested. Expect a costly up-charge when requesting factory drilling and tapping. Similar to 
a standard hinge, when using a heavy weight continuous hinge, thicker gauge metal means that the 
materials will be thicker and the door width will be narrower than a door with a standard weight con-
tinuous hinge.
PIVOTS
Also Known As: Pivot Set, Pivot Hinge
DESCRIPTION
Pivots can be manufactured as various types to accommodate various door sizes, thicknesses, weights, 
existing conditions, and ﬁre ratings. They can also be manufactured with various bearing types or no 
bearings at all, which can aﬀect the swinging operation of the door. Specialty pivots are available for 
various types of special applications such as oversized doors, aesthetic design aspects of an opening, 
and door- and frame-applied materials.
Conventional pivots do not typically return a door to center, but there are some lighter-duty spring 
pivots that have that option. For devices that return a door to center, see Hanging Means, Floor Closers 
in this chapter.
FIGURE 1.81 Standard Duty Center Pivot Set
(Source: Courtesy of Rixson®)
www.it-ebooks.info

HANGING DEVICES    |    47
PROPERTIES
Pivots are typically furnished in sets, which are installed at the top and bottom of the door and are con-
nected to the head of the door opening or frame and the ﬂoor.
Bearings
Pivots that are manufactured with bearings separate the metal of the knuckles from directly touching 
and pivoting on each other. The inserts create a barrier between the metal parts eliminating metal fric-
tion, which causes less wear on the knuckles than would a nonbearing pivot.
ANTIFRICTION BEARING
Anti-friction bearings have a material manufactured in between the two leaves of the pivot plates to 
prevent the metal from wearing on metal to give the device a longer life cycle without defect.
THRUST BEARING
Thrust bearings help support the weight or vertical load of the door, or the weight resting on top of the 
bottom arm and pivot.
NEEDLE BEARING
Needle bearings help support the lateral force of the opening, or the swinging from side to side on the 
pivot point.
Bushings
A bushing is a material used typically to separate the two portions of a top or intermediate pivot where 
they join, similar to bearings of a hinge, continuous hinge, or bottom pivot (see Hanging Means, Hinges, 
Properties, and Bearings in this chapter).
Materials
Pivots are manufactured from steel, brass, bronze, stainless steel, or aluminum depending on their 
application and ﬁre rated door opening requirements. If a door opening is ﬁre rated, the codes state 
that hanging devices must be manufactured of steel to withstand the high temperatures of a ﬁre.
If anything other than a steel base is installed on a ﬁre rated door opening and a ﬁre occurs, the hinge 
metal might melt enough to cause the opening to fail, allowing the ﬁre to spread from one side of the 
opening to the other.
TYPES
Bottom Pivot
The bottom pivot is typically an arm connected to a ﬂoor plate on a spindle and similarly to a top pivot, 
allowing the arm to rotate on the ﬂoor plate and the door to swing open and closed from a frame or 
door opening. For ﬂoor conditions that do not allow conventional fastening, there are some bottom 
pivots that rest on the ﬂoor but attach to the jamb instead (see Figure 1.82). Depending on the manu-
facturer, the pivot point might be covered by a cap with a screw fastener to cover the knuckle or joining 
portion of the two arms for aesthetics.
Other applications for bottom pivot arm conﬁgurations and fastening are available speciﬁcally for con-
crete and some have vertical adjustments, which move the pivot up and down within limits to accom-
modate for ﬂoors that are not level.

Intermediate Pivot
Oﬀset intermediate pivots are not only recommended to be speciﬁed and installed when using a top 
and bottom oﬀset pivot, they are required by some manufacturers. Oﬀset intermediate pivots have 
the same standard pivot point as a top and bottom pivot set, which is 3/4 inch, which means the pivot 
point, or center of the pivoting portion of the pivot, is 3/4 inch from the face of the door and are handed 
either left hand or right hand. Intermediate oﬀset pivots are also available in special oﬀset dimensions; 
the most common extended oﬀset dimension is 1 1/2 inches, which is typically used to accommodate a

HANGING DEVICES    |    49
panel on the face of the door. If an extended oﬀset is not furnished for a panel on the face of the door, 
the pivot point would conﬂict with the panel, and that portion of the panel would have to be cut out to 
accept the pivot point and arm.
Be careful when specifying extended pivots, as the more the extension, the less weight the pivot will 
hold due to the balance and placement of the arm underneath the door.
Intermediate oﬀset pivots must adhere to the same codes for hanging doors and butt or continuous 
hinges and can be used as a set of three or more instead of top and bottom pivots, similar to butt hinge 
applications.
LIGHTWEIGHT
Lightweight hinges are typically used for very light-duty, low-use door openings that can be mounted 
in diﬀerent mountings such as ﬂoor to stop, ﬂoor to ceiling, and jamb to ceiling.
Top Pivot
OFFSET
An oﬀset top pivot is typically manufactured with two arms that meet at one end and are attached with 
a pin of sorts, similar to a scissor, which rotates or “pivots” two parts on each other. This allows a door to 
swing open and closed from a frame or door opening.
CENTER
A center-hung top pivot is also known as a walking-beam pivot and has a retractable pin that allows 
the door to be installed into the frame. When installing, the pin is retracted until in place and then 
extended to secure the door into the opening.

Spring
Surface-mounted pivots are typically similar to light-duty center-hung pivots, and although they swing 
the door closed, they cannot be used on ﬁre rated doors. They are installed in the center of the thick-
ness of the door, can hold moderate weight doors, typically swing the door in both directions (similar 
to a kitchen-type door in a restaurant), and bring the door back to the center of the frame in the closed 
position. Spring pivots typically come in sets, which include a top and bottom pivot.
They are also installed slightly oﬀset in the thickness of the door, which means that the back end of 
the door swings into the opening, depending on the pivot and template, approximately 6 inches. This 
means that the frame cannot have a stop on it, at least not on the pivot side of the door if the door is 
meant to be single acting.
One thing to be cautious of is the clearance at the edges of the door. Because the pivot is offset 
in the thickness of the door and the door swings through the frame on the back end, there is a 
more than normal clearance, which allows for light to shine through the edges. It is recommended 
in most cases to use some type of gasketing around the perimeter of the door, typically a brush-
type seal.
Gate and gravity pivot hinges are also available, speciﬁcally manufactured to operate gates and not 
doors that are not full height in a door opening.
Also known as dwarf or small door spring hinges, screen hinges are small devices used for very light-
weight doors, such as an aluminum screen or window panel door.
The torsion door spring hinge typically has two plates and a thick pin of sorts connecting the two, with 
a heavy-duty spring wrapped around the pin. Tension is created when the plates separate, which are 
installed on the door and the frame or door opening.
Thrust
Similar to an anchor and pivot reinforced hinge, a thrust pivot hinge has a pivot set at the top of the 
door that continues to the jamb of the door, so in sense is a top pivot, but requires the use of butt 
hinges to complete the installation.
OPTIONS
Electric Transfer
Pivots are available with wires running through them, and electric transfer pivots are available for 
electric locking or release devices. An electriﬁed lockset on a single door or pair of doors or an electric 
strike on a pair of doors requires a device that would transfer the power from the wall into the pivot 
leaf on the frame, through the pivot point of the pivot and leaf on the door, then across the door to 
the electric device.
Depending on the function of the electriﬁed system on the door opening, electric transfer pivots 
are available with various wire quantities. A simple system would only require four wires, while a 
more complex system or one with added options, such as a signal switch, might require as many as 
12 wires.
Also, electric transfer pivots are intended to operate with low-voltage and low-amperage devices. If the 
voltage or amperage is too high, there is a danger of overheating and damaging the devices and those

HANGING DEVICES    |    51
that they operate, and it creates the danger of a ﬁre. If the devices do require higher voltage, a power 
transfer device is required (see Chapter 10, Miscellaneous Items).
Some manufacturers furnish electriﬁed transfer pivots with nonproprietary Molex connectors, 
which are plastic connectors that are coordinated with the electriﬁed hardware and power supplies. 
This allows all of the company’s electriﬁed devices to be manufactured with Molex connectors, 
allowing any two devices to quickly and easily snap together, much like a plug-and-play device on 
your computer.
Extended Oﬀset
The standard oﬀset pivot point is 3/4 inch, and although available in custom dimensions, the most com-
mon extended oﬀset dimension is 1 1/2 inches. The extended oﬀset is typically used to accommodate 
a panel or plant-on, on the face of the door. If a 3/4-inch panel is installed on a door and an extended 
oﬀset is not used, the pivot point would conﬂict with the panel and that portion of the panel would 
have to be cut out to accept the pivot point and arm.
Be cautious when specifying extended pivots, as the more the extension, the less weight the pivot will 
hold due to the balance and placement of the arm underneath the door.

Extended Spindle
Extended spindles for the bottom arms and ﬂoor plates are available for doors that have large under-
cuts in order to extend the entire length required. A typical door undercut is 3/4 inch from the ﬁnished 
ﬂoor, which is what a standard spindle is manufactured for. Another reason why an extended spindle 
might be required is a panel or covering on the door or a taller than normal saddle on the ﬂoor, which 
would require the spindle to extend through either.
Fire Rated
Oﬀset pivot sets have the option of being manufactured as ﬁre rated but have to be speciﬁed and 
ordered as such. This means the material is steel or stainless steel and has been tested and passed as 
ﬁre rated by Underwriters’ Laboratories (UL).

Institutional Design
Similar to hospital tip hinges (see Hanging Means, Hinges, Options, Hospital Tip in this chapter), institu-
tional design pivots are designed to eliminate the conventional ﬂat portion of the device where the two 
ends join and pivot. The end is rounded and makes it more diﬃcult to tie or wrap something around the 
end with the intention to harming oneself.
Lead Lined
Oﬀset pivot sets are not actually lead lined, but the fastener hole pattern on each leaf is set in a way 
so as not to interfere with the lead lining of a door and frame. If the fasteners were to penetrate the 
lead lining in either the door or frame, it would create a hole in the lead and radiation could escape 
through the hole to the other side of the opening, where the protection for those passing by would be 
eliminated.
Less Top Pivot
There are some conditions that might not allow the use of a top oﬀset pivot, although the intermediate 
and bottom pivots would be optimal for the application. An arched doorway would be one example 
where a top pivot could not be installed due to the conﬁguration of the top of the door and frame, so 
the pivot set would be speciﬁed “less top pivot.”
Special Layouts
Some installations require custom layouts and some manufacturers are willing to work with you to see 
if they have the ability to customize their tooling to create pivot conﬁgurations as required.
Weights
Pivots are not categorized in grades as with most architectural hardware, but in weights such as light, 
medium, and heavy.
With that said, pivots can be manufactured with diﬀerent quality levels, depending on the source and 
factory and possibly country standards.
Some manufacturers still manufacture pivots in the United States, which are typically of superior quality 
to those manufactured in some other countries, known in the industry as imports.
FIGURE 1.91 Lead Lined Top Oﬀset Pivot Arm
(Source: Courtesy of Rixson®)
www.it-ebooks.info

54    |   HANGING DEVICES
Imports are available in the most typical and widely used sizes, typically for 3-foot-wide, 7-foot-high, 
and 1 3/4-inch-thick wood or metal swinging doors. The pivots are less expensive than those still made 
in the United States, and the lower quality can sometimes be noticed with ragged edges, poor ﬁnishes, 
and not optimal performance.
Due to the competitive nature of the door opening industry, some of the U.S. manufacturers now sell 
products at the same level and price point of these pivots to compete on projects through the distribu-
tion marketplace.
LIGHTWEIGHT
Lightweight pivots would not typically be used on a commercial application but more likely on a resi-
dential or an infrequently used door.
MEDIUM/STANDARD WEIGHT
Medium-weight pivots would typically be used on standard-frequency openings with the ability to 
carry standard door weights from 150 and up to 650 pounds, depending on the manufacturer.
HEAVYWEIGHT
Heavyweight pivots would typically be used on standard-frequency openings with the ability to carry 
standard door weights from 1,000 and up to 1,750 pounds depending on the manufacturer.
QUANTITIES
Pivots are typically installed in set, depending on their type, although some are available as singles to 
be combined as necessary for the application.
CENTER
Center pivot sets are typically available with a top and bottom pivot. Because the door is hung bal-
anced in the opening, there is no accommodation nor is there any available type of intermediate center 
pivot; they are only available for oﬀset pivots. Remember, because of the door and frame conﬁguration 
for a center pivot, the opening cannot be ﬁre rated.
OFFSET
Oﬀset pivot sets are typically available with a top and bottom, although an intermediate pivot is 
required by most manufacturers for use with the top and bottom set. Oﬀset pivoted doors have the 
same requirements as standard hinges—two per leaf for openings through 60 inches to door height. 
One additional pivot required per leaf for each additional 30 inches in height or fraction thereof, and 
four pivots for Dutch doors up to 90 inches in height. You might ask why four hinges are used for a 
Dutch door. A Dutch door is a split-leaf door that has a top half and bottom half that swing indepen-
dently from each other. In order for the doors to swing at all, they need at least two pivots each.

HANGING DEVICES    |    55
POCKET
A pocket-pivot set typically uses single pivots. Pocket-pivot doors have the same requirements as stan-
dard hinges and are installed at the edge of the door, but some manufacturers require more pivots 
than codes require. The minimum is three pivots per opening, no matter the minimum height, four for 
7-feet, 6-inch door heights, and one additional pocket pivot per leaf for each additional 30 inches in 
height or fraction thereof.
APPLICATIONS
Similar to hinges, some applications will not allow for conventional mortising of the pivot arms on 
either the door or frame or both. Therefore, other application variations are available to accommodate 
other necessary mountings.
Center
Center-hung pivots are the next most recommended pivot type after oﬀset pivots, but they cannot be 
used on ﬁre rated doors. They are installed at the centerline of the thickness and oﬀ of the edge of the 
door and are not handed. Center pivots can be used for single-acting applications, such as one with a 
conventional door swing, or for double-acting applications, such as you might see in a restaurant on a 
kitchen door for easy access in either direction. Just as a door edge is beveled for other hanging means 
so the door edge does not bind with the frame edge, a center-hung door has a bull-nosed, or radius 
edge, to allow the door to swing through the opening without binding (see Figure 1.94). The radius at 
the edge of the door creates a larger than standard clearance, which allows light to shine through the 
edges. It is recommended in most cases to use some type of gasketing around the perimeter of the 
door, typically a brush-type seal.
Because center pivots are installed at the centerline of the thickness and oﬀ of the edge of the door, the 
back end of the door swings into the opening and to the other side (see Figure 1.94). If being used on a 
FIGURE 1.94 Double Lipped Strike with Built-In 
Emergency Stop

56    |   HANGING DEVICES
single-swing application, due to the fact that the door needs to swing through the opening on the back 
end, the frame cannot have a full-stop across the top to stop the door in the closed position. The stop 
on the frame can either be manufactured to end where the pivot starts or an applied angle stop can be 
used instead (see Chapter 7, Stops and Holders).
Center pivots can hold the weight of very large and oversized doors and, if installed correctly, they can 
swing the door freely and make it appear as if it were quite light weight when swinging open or closed. 
Light-duty center pivots are also available, although they do not have the same strength and durability 
as conventional commercial types.
RESCUE HARDWARE
Typically used on a healthcare restroom, center pivots are often part of a rescue hardware set, which 
includes a center pivot that swings both ways through an opening. Other parts of the rescue hardware 
set include a double-lipped strike plate, which extends the entire width of the frame jamb. An emer-
gency release stop is another part of the rescue hardware set, which is used to stop the door in the 
closed position in the frame or door opening. When a patient is in the restroom and happens to get 
injured, falls, or is unable to get out by themselves but are resting against the in-swinging door, the 
emergency stop can be depressed and the door can be swung toward the rescuers you and away from 
the patient, who can then be assisted.
Full Surface
Typically available for top pivots, the designation in the device title refers to the door portion of the open-
ing. The door and frame portions of the pivot are surface-mounted on the faces of the door and frame.
Half Mortise
Typically available for top pivots, the designation in the device title refers to the door portion of the 
opening. The door portion of the pivot is mortised as a conventional top pivot would be, while the 
frame portion is surface-mounted on the face of the frame.
Half Surface
Typically available for top pivots, the designation in the device title refers to the door portion of the 
opening. The door portion of the pivot is surface-mounted on the face of the door while the frame por-
tion is mortised as a conventional top pivot would be.
Oﬀset
Oﬀset hung pivots are the number one recommended pivot conﬁguration due to their application 
availability, strength, durability, and longevity; however, they do tend to be the most expensive con-
ventional hanging means other than oﬀset ﬂoor closers. Oﬀset pivots are handed, which means they 
need to be speciﬁc to the handing of the door, right or left.
Oﬀset pivots have a standard pivot point of 3/4 inch, which means the pivot point, or center of the 
pivoting portion of the arm, is 3/4 inch from the face of the door. This pivot point or spindle is typically 
covered by a cap that is held onto the spindle with a screw. Oﬀset pivots are also available in special 
oﬀset dimensions; the most common extended oﬀset dimension is 1 1/2 inches, which is typically used 
to accommodate a panel on the face of the door, similar to a wide throw hinge (see Pivots, Options, 
Extended Oﬀset and Hinges, Types, Wide Throw in this chapter).
Oﬀset pivots must adhere to the same standards and ﬁre codes for hanging doors as standard or con-
tinuous hinges, and it is not only recommended but required that an intermediate pivot be used when

HANGING DEVICES    |    57
installing top and bottom oﬀset pivots (see Pivots, Intermediate in this chapter). Light-duty oﬀset piv-
ots are also available, although they do not have the same strength and durability as conventional 
commercial types.
Patch Fittings
Typically available for both top and bottom pivots, patch ﬁttings are available for glass doors without 
top and or bottom rails to accommodate conventional pivot arms. Patch ﬁttings are attached to both 
sides of the glass, sandwiching it in between. Coordinating the glass thickness with the patch ﬁtting is 
necessary to ensure the glass will ﬁt into the patch ﬁttings properly or at all.
Pocket
Similar to swing clear standard and continuous hinges, pocket pivots are used for swinging a door away 
from the clear width opening. A typical application for a pocket-pivot hinge is to swing the door into 
a pocket in the wall so that the door appears ﬂush with the surrounding wall, appearing to become 
part of the wall, which some might ﬁnd more aesthetically pleasing. This application is typically used

in cross-corridor ﬁre rated doors, which are held open on electromagnetic holders and tied into a ﬁre 
alarm system (see Chapter 7, Stops and Holders).
Pocket pivots must adhere to the same standards and ﬁre codes for hanging doors as standard or con-
tinuous hinges.
INSTALLATION
The most eﬃcient type of hanging device is the pivot. This hardware allows the door’s weight to be 
borne by the ﬂoor and not on the frame. The result is virtually no stress on the frame.
The mounting screws are in shear, not tension. This means for the door to come oﬀ the frame, the heads 
of the screws would have to be sheared oﬀ horizontally and the door would have to be lifted oﬀ the 
ﬂoor portion of the pivot set. Pivot sets are available oﬀset or center hung.
Fasteners
Pivots are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood or metal door and 
frame material installation. Phillips and flat head are available, depending on the manufacturer’s 
standard, and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, security stud, 
and torx.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.
Locations
Pivots are installed on diﬀerent points of the door, frame, and ﬂoor, depending on the type and applica-
tion (see Hanging Means, Pivots, Quantities in this chapter).
Preparations
Pivot preparations vary by type and application and are typically reinforced with additional materials 
inside the door to assist with the screw holding force.
Screw holes are typically drilled and tapped at the factory for metal doors, but not for wood doors 
unless speciﬁcally requested. Expect a costly up-charge when requesting factory drilling and tapping. 
Similar to a standard hinge, when using a heavyweight pivot, thicker gauge metal means that the mate-
rials will be thicker and the door and frame preparations need to be coordinated.
FLOOR CLOSERS
Also Known As: Floor Check, Concealed Closer
Equal to pivots as the most efficient type of hanging device is the floor closer, and some may even 
consider it even more efficient with the addition of the self-closing ability. This hardware allows 
the door’s weight to be borne by the floor and not on the frame. The result is virtually no stress on 
the frame.
Floor closers can be manufactured as various types to accommodate diﬀerent door sizes, thicknesses, 
weights, existing ﬂoor conditions, and ﬁre ratings and are available for various types of special applica-
tions such as oversized doors and or door and frame applied materials.
www.it-ebooks.info

HANGING DEVICES    |    59
PROPERTIES
Floor closers are typically furnished in sets with a top pivot and ﬂoor closer body, which are installed 
at the top and bottom of the door and connected to the head of the door opening or frame and in the 
ﬂoor directly beneath.
Bearings
Floor closers that are manufactured with bearings help support the weight and operation of the device. 
They also keep the arm of the ﬂoor closer and the spindle from directly touching and pivoting on each 
other. This creates a supportive barrier between the metal parts, reducing metal friction, which causes 
less wear and a smoother operation.
THRUST BEARING
Thrust bearings help support the weight or vertical load of the door, or the weight resting on top of the 
bottom arm and ﬂoor closer arm. The thrust bearing level of duty will match that of the ﬂoor closer; for 
example, a heavy-duty ﬂoor closer will have a heavy-duty thrust bearing.
NEEDLE BEARING
Needle bearings help support the lateral force of the opening, or the swinging from side to side on the 
pivot point.
OILIMPREGNATED BEARING
Oil-impregnated bearings help support the movement of the walking beam pivot when it is being 
installed and uninstalled.
Finishes
Floor closer bodies do not have ﬁnishes, as they are covered beneath the ground. They are typically 
furnished with cover plates that are available in most architectural hardware ﬁnishes to match the other 
hardware installed on the door such as the locking device.
Grades
Door closers, including ﬂoor closers, are graded with grades 1, 2, or 3, depending on ANSI/BHMA test 
procedures. Such tests include cycle and various valve testing to meet minimum levels. Minimum lev-
els, for example, for a surface or concealed in door cycle testing for a grade 1 closer are 1 million cycles 
and 100,000 cycles with the backcheck valve control functional.

60    |   HANGING DEVICES
Materials
The internal parts and decorative cover plates of ﬂoor closers are manufactured from various met-
als, depending on the manufacturer. The arms are manufactured from brass, bronze, stainless steel, or 
steel, depending on their application and ﬁre rated door opening requirements. If a door opening is 
ﬁre rated, the codes state that hanging devices must be manufactured of steel to withstand the high 
temperatures of a ﬁre.
If anything other than a steel base is installed on a ﬁre rated door opening and a ﬁre occurs, the hinge 
metal might melt enough to cause the opening to fail, allowing the ﬁre to spread from one side of the 
opening to the other.
Springs
CAM
A cam action closer operates by a twisting motion, which pushes and pulls the springs that operate 
with the closer opening and closing cycles. A cam action closer is diﬀerent from a standard closer 
where a standard closer does not have a twisting part, but rather hydraulic ﬂuid that ﬂows back and 
forth through the device, pushing and pulling the parts that are required to move the closer through 
the cycles.
TORSION
A torsion spring is a wound spring, where the tension is in the wind rather than in compressing or 
squeezing. The spring is wound and has tension in the same direction as the door swing, which helps 
with eﬃciency and operation of the door.
COMPRESSION
A compression spring is compressed or squeezed and released to create the movement necessary 
to close a door and is not as eﬃcient as a torsion spring (see Hanging Means, Floor Closers, Options, 
Springs in this chapter).
Stops
Some ﬂoor closers have built-in stops, which hard-stop the door at a set degree of opening. The open-
ing degree is typically limited and depends on the manufacturer’s availability.
Valves
Floor closers are manufactured with various valves to assist with optimizing the closing and latching 
speeds and forces. These valves act in cycles of the door opening and closing.
BACKCHECK
Backcheck valves allow for adjustment to the opening force past about 65 degrees of the door in the 
open position to give the door less resistance, making it easier to push open.
CLOSING SPEED
Closing speed valves allow for adjustment of the closing speed cycle. This is the speed once initially 
released if the device has no delayed action option (see Hanging Means, Floor Closers, Options in this 
chapter) or once the delayed action has completed, and aﬀects the closing up until about 15 degrees 
of the closed position.
LATCH SPEED
Latch speed valves allow for adjustment to the latching speed cycle. This is the speed once past the 
closing speed cycle and gives the door enough force and power to clear any of the locking device 
www.it-ebooks.info

HANGING DEVICES    |    61
latches, or other surrounding elements that might aﬀect the closing such as gaskets around the 
perimeter of the door.
TYPES
The bodies of a ﬂoor closer typically come in two depths. In addition to the ﬂoor closer body sizes and 
depths required for installation, there are many feature diﬀerences.
Heavy Duty
Heavy-duty applications require a preparation in the ﬂoor of more than 4 inches deep and can carry 
standard weights up to approximately 450 pounds with extra-heavy-duty applications, carrying 
weights up to 1,500 pounds.
Shallow Depth
The body of a ﬂoor closer can be standard duty and requires a preparation in the ﬂoor of about 
2 inches deep, carrying weight up to approximately 250 pounds.
OPTIONS
Cold Weather Fluid
Cold weather ﬂuid is available in lieu of standard oil and ﬂuids used to operate the ﬂoor closer. This 
ﬂuid would be speciﬁed and used in areas where extreme cold weather exists so that the ﬂuids do not 
thicken or freeze, which would aﬀect the operation of the closer.

Cover Pan
Floor closers are available with cover pans to be installed where the standard decorative cover plate 
would be. A cover pan would likely be used for the installation of terrazzo or some type of ﬂoor 
FIGURE 1.101 Floor Closer Cover Pan

HANGING DEVICES    |    63
covering, which would be installed into the pan, then the pan would be installed into the ﬂoor. The mate-
rials would match the surrounding patterns with the exception of a narrow metal lip of the pan, which can 
be removed from the ﬂoor for access to the ﬂoor closer. Access might be required for spring or tension 
adjustments or for other types of required repairs or replacement. Depending on the pan and material 
dimensions, an extended spindle might be necessary (see Hanging Means, Floor Closers, Options, and 
Extended Spindles in this chapter).
Delayed Action
A delayed-action option delays, or slows, the door and sometimes even hold it for a short period 
of time at a certain degree. This option allows time for someone or something to pass through the 
doorway without rushing or getting hit by the door while moving through the opening, without the 
need for a hold-open feature (see Hanging Means, Floor Closers, Options, Hold Open in this chapter).
Electric Transfer
Floor closers are available with wires running through them, and electric transfer pivots are available 
for electric locking or release devices. An electriﬁed lockset on a single door or pair of doors or an elec-
tric strike on a pair of doors would require a device, which would transfer the power from the wall into 
the ﬂoor closer body, through the spindle, up the hanging side of the door to the raceway, and across 
the door to the electric device.
Depending on the function of the electriﬁed system on the door opening, electric transfer pivots are 
available with various wire quantities. A simple system would only require four wires, while a more 
complex system or added options, such as a signal switch, might require twelve wires.
In addition, electric transfer pivots are intended to operate with low-voltage and low-amperage devices. 
If the voltage or amperage is too high, there is a danger of overheating and damaging the devices and 
those that they operate, and this creates the danger of a ﬁre. If the devices do require higher voltage, a 
power transfer device is required (see Chapter 10, Miscellaneous Items).

64    |   HANGING DEVICES
Some manufacturers furnish electriﬁed transfer pivots with nonproprietary Molex connec-
tors, which are plastic connectors that are coordinated with the electriﬁed hardware and power 
supplies. This allows all of the company’s electriﬁed devices to be manufactured with Molex con-
nectors, allowing any two devices to quickly and easily snap together like a plug-and-play device 
on your computer.
Extended Oﬀset
The standard oﬀset ﬂoor closer pivot point is 3/4 inch, and although available in custom dimensions, 
the most common extended oﬀset dimension is 1 1/2 inches. The extended oﬀset is typically used to 
accommodate a panel or plant-on, on the face of the door. If a 3/4-inch panel is installed on a door and 
an extended oﬀset is not used, the pivot point will conﬂict with the panel and that portion of the panel 
will have to be cut out to accept the pivot point and arm.
Be cautious when specifying extended ﬂoor closer pivot points, as the more the extension, the less 
weight the ﬂoor closer will hold due to the balance and placement of the arm underneath the door.
Extended Pivot Pin
Center ﬂoor closers using top-center pivots sometimes require longer pivot pins in order to engage 
the door more than a standard pivot pin. This option is recommended when doors are taller than a 
certain height, but as with all door hardware, check with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Extended Spindle
Extended spindles for the bottom arms and ﬂoor plates are available for doors that have large under-
cuts in order to extend the entire length required. A typical door undercut is 3/4 inch from the ﬁnished 
ﬂoor, which is what a standard spindle is manufactured for. Another reason why an extended spindle 
might be required would be a panel or covering on the door or a taller than normal saddle on the ﬂoor, 
which would require the spindle to extend through either.
Fire Rated
Oﬀset ﬂoor closers have the option of being manufactured as ﬁre rated, but have to be speciﬁed and 
ordered as such. This means the material is steel or stainless steel and has been tested and passed by 
the UL as ﬁre rated and might require additional intermediate pivots to comply.
Hold Open
The hold open option is available to hold the ﬂoor closer and door in the open position, which is a ﬁxed 
degree of opening. The hold open positions can vary depending on availability and cannot be used on 
ﬁre rated doors, as they are mechanical hold open devices.

HANGING DEVICES    |    65
Lead Lined
Oﬀset ﬂoor closers are not actually lead lined, but the fastener hole pattern on each leaf is set in a way 
so as to not interfere with the lead lining of a door and frame. If the fasteners were to penetrate the 
lead lining in either the door or frame, it would create a hole in the lead and radiation could escape 
through the hole to the other side of the opening, where the protection for those passing by would be 
eliminated.
Fewer Parts
Floor closers typically have the option to be speciﬁed as fewer of certain parts such as the ﬂoor plate, 
top pivot, or possibly all parts except for the body alone. This might be desired if you wanted to order 
and install a replacement part of the closer or the closer body itself without having to pay for or waste 
the other parts of the closer.
Non-Hold Open
The non-hold open option is available so that the door is not held open and closes each time. It is typi-
cally used on ﬁre rated doors.
Physically Handicapped
This option indicates the opening force complies with ICC/ANSI A117.1 (International Code Council/
American National Standards Institute) Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities, 2009 and the 
ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG). These standards require that any 
accessible opening have a 5-pound maximum opening force. This option cannot be used on ﬁre rated 
or exterior door openings, whose requirements override accessible codes and standards. Be aware that 
this option reduces the opening force, which in turn reduces the closing force, and might prevent the 
door from closing and latching properly or at all (see Hanging Means, Floor Closers, and References in 
this chapter).
Sealed Closer
For door openings that have exposure to water or liquids, such as cleaning products, sealing a closer 
protects the inside of the closer body and all of the working parts of the ﬂoor closer. In order to seal 
the ﬂoor closer, it is typically placed in a cement case and a gasket is placed in between it and the 
secured cover plate, which is fastened to the cement case containing the ﬂoor closer body.
Selective Hold Open
The selective hold open option is available to hold the ﬂoor closer and door in the open position, 
which can be selected to achieve diﬀerent degrees of opening. The hold open positions can vary 
depending on availability and cannot be used on ﬁre rated doors, as they are mechanical hold open 
devices.
Special Layouts
Some installations require custom layouts and some manufacturers are willing to work with you to see 
if they have the ability to customize their tooling to create pivot conﬁgurations as required.
Threshold
Some manufacturers oﬀer thresholds to cover the ﬂoor closer in lieu of the standard decorative cover 
plate and or cover plate for terrazzo or other ﬂoor coverings. Thresholds might be required by some

codes for ﬂoor type transitions and when using a ﬂoor closer in those opening types, having the thresh-
old furnished by the same manufacturer as the ﬂoor closer would be the best option.
QUANTITIES
Floor closers are typically installed in sets, depending on their type, although some are available as 
parts as necessary for the application.
Center
Center ﬂoor closers are typically available with a ﬂoor closer body, arm, top pivot, and decorative plates. 
Because the door is hung from the top and bottom, there is no such thing as a center hung intermedi-
ate pivot. With its operation and conﬁguration, there is no physical way for the door to attach to the 
frame or framed opening hardware at the middle edge of the door. Also remember, center hung open-
ings are typically not ﬁre rated. 
Independently Hung
Independently hung ﬂoor closers can be sold as just a ﬂoor closer body to work with another hanging 
means to be speciﬁed such as hinges or pocket pivots. These ﬂoor closers can also sometimes be sold 
in sets, depending on the manufacturer, such as a ﬂoor closer body with two standard hinges.
Oﬀset
Oﬀset ﬂoor closers are typically available with a ﬂoor closer body, arm, top pivot, and decorative plates. 
Although an intermediate pivot is required by most manufacturers for use with the oﬀset ﬂoor closer

HANGING DEVICES    |    67
and top pivot, it does not typically come with the set and needs to be speciﬁed or ordered separately. 
Oﬀset pivoted doors have the same requirements as standard hinges—two per leaf for openings 
through 60 inches to door height. One additional pivot is required per leaf for each additional 30 inches 
in height or fraction thereof.
APPLICATIONS
Similar to hinges, some applications will not allow for conventional mortising of the pivot arms on 
either the door or frame or both. As such, other application variations are available to accommodate 
other necessary mountings.
Center
Center hung ﬂoor closers are the next most recommended hanging means after oﬀset ﬂoor closers (see 
Hanging Means, Floor Closers, Properties, and Oﬀset in this chapter). Center ﬂoor closers cannot be used 
on ﬁre rated doors, as they are installed at the centerline of the thickness and oﬀ of the edge of the door. 
Center hung ﬂoor closers can be used for single-acting applications, such as a conventional door swing 
or double-acting applications such as you might see in a restaurant on a kitchen door for easy access in 
either direction. Just as a door edge is beveled for other hanging means so the door edge does not bind 
with the frame edge, a center hung door has a bull-nosed, or radius, edge to allow the door to swing 
through the opening without binding (see Figure 1.135). The radius at the edge of the door creates a larger 
than standard clearance, which allows light to shine through the edges. It is recommended in most cases 
that you use some type of gasketing around the perimeter of the door, typically a brush-type seal.
Because center ﬂoor closers are installed at the centerline of the thickness and oﬀ of the edge of the 
door, the back end of the door swings into the opening and to the other side (see Figure 1.105). If being 
used on a single-swing application and due to the fact that the door needs to swing through the open-
ing on the back end, the frame cannot have a full stop across the top to stop the door in the closed 
position. The stop on the frame can either be manufactured to end where the center pivot starts or an 
applied angle stop can be used instead (see Chapter 7, Stops and Holders).
Full Surface
Typically available for top pivots, the designation in the device  title refers to the door portion of the open-
ing. The door and frame portions of the pivot are surface-mounted on the faces of the door and frame.
Half Mortise
Typically available for top pivots, the designation in the device’s  title refers to the door portion of the 
opening. The door portion of the pivot is mortised as a conventional top pivot would be, while the 
frame portion is surface-mounted on the face of the frame.

68    |   HANGING DEVICES
Half Surface
Typically available for top pivots, the designation in the device title refers to the door portion of the 
opening. The door portion of the pivot is surface-mounted on the face of the door while the frame por-
tion is mortised as a conventional top pivot would be.
Independently Hung
Typically handed left or right, an independently hung ﬂoor closer is a closer concealed in the ﬂoor and 
only functions as a door closer and not to carry the weight of the door. This closer requires the use of 
hinges, continuous hinges, or pocket pivots to hang and carry the weight of the door. The type of hang-
ing devices will have to be speciﬁed when ordering the ﬂoor closers so that the installation is templated 
properly.
Oﬀset
Oﬀset ﬂoor closers are the number one recommended pivot conﬁguration due to their application 
availability, strength, durability, and longevity; however, they do tend to be the most expensive con-
ventional hanging method. Oﬀset ﬂoor closers are handed, which means they need to be speciﬁc to 
the handing of the door, right or left.
Oﬀset ﬂoor closers have a standard pivot point of 3/4 inch, which means the pivot point, or center of 
the pivoting portion of the arm, is 3/4 inch from the face of the door. This pivot point, or spindle, is typi-
cally covered by a cap that is held onto the spindle with a screw. Oﬀset ﬂoor closers are also available in 
special oﬀset dimensions; the most common extended oﬀset dimension is 1 1/2 inches, which is typi-
cally used to accommodate a panel on the face of the door, similar to a wide throw hinge (see Hanging 
Means, Floor Closers, Options, Extended Oﬀset and Hinges, Types, Wide Throw in this chapter).
Offset floor closers must adhere to the same standards and fire codes for hanging doors as stan-
dard or continuous hinges. It is not only recommended, but required, that an intermediate pivot 
is used when installing top and bottom offset pivots (see Hanging Means, Pivots, Intermediate in 
this chapter).
Patch Fittings
Typically available for a ﬂoor closer set, including a ﬂoor closer body and top pivot, patch ﬁttings are 
available for glass doors without top and or bottom rails to accommodate conventional ﬂoor closers 
FIGURE 1.108 Patch Fitting Floor Closer

www.it-ebooks.info

HANGING DEVICES    |    69
and pivot arms. Patch ﬁttings are attached to both sides of the glass, sandwiching it in between. Coor-
dinating the glass thickness with the patch ﬁtting is necessary to ensure the glass will ﬁt into the patch 
ﬁttings properly.
INSTALLATION
Equal to if not more eﬃcient than a pivot, a ﬂoor closer is the ideal hanging and controlling device. This 
hardware allows the door’s weight to be borne by the ﬂoor and not on the frame, resulting in virtually 
no stress on the frame.
Be aware, however, that although a ﬂoor closer will stop a door when the spring reaches full tension, the 
ﬂoor closer will stop working eﬃciently, as it is not meant to stop the door. Some ﬂoor closers actually 
have stops built into them, but otherwise an additional stop will need to be installed (see Stops and 
Holders in Chapter 7).
The mounting screws are in shear, not tension. This means for the door to come oﬀ the frame, the heads 
of the screws would have to be sheared oﬀ horizontally and the door would have to be lifted oﬀ the 
ﬂoor portion of the ﬂoor closer.
It is recommended to install overhead stops on out-swinging doors hung on ﬂoor closers, especially on 
exterior heavy duty applications.
Fasteners
Floor closers are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood or metal door 
and frame material installation. Phillips and ﬂat-head screws are available, depending on the manufac-
turer’s standard, and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, security stud, 
and torx.
The mounting screws are in shear, not tension. This means for the door to come oﬀ the frame, 
the heads of the screws would have to be sheared oﬀ horizontally and the door would have to be 
lifted oﬀ the ﬂoor portion of the ﬂoor closer arm. Floor closers are available in oﬀset or center hung 
options.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.
Locations
Floor closers are installed on diﬀerent points of the door, frame, and ﬂoor, depending on the type and 
application (see Hanging Means, Floor Closers, Quantities in this chapter).
Preparations
Floor closer preparations vary by type and application and are typically reinforced with additional 
materials inside the door to assist with the screw holding force.
Screw holes are typically drilled and tapped at the factory for metal doors, but not for wood doors, 
unless speciﬁcally requested. Expect a costly up-charge when requesting factory drilling and tap-
ping. Similar to a standard hinge, when using a heavyweight ﬂoor closer, thicker gauge metal for the 
pivot arms mean that the materials will be thicker and the door and frame preparations will need to 
be coordinated.

SLIDING AND FOLDING DOOR HARDWARE
Also Known As: Track and Hardware
DESCRIPTION
Track and hardware is used to hang folding and sliding doors, which are sometimes used for aesthetic 
purposes, but typically are installed to maximize the space around the opening by not having a swing-
ing door that requires clearance all around so that the door swings freely.
Typical folding and sliding doors are not fire rated, although there are a handful of manufactur-
ers that do manufacture a fire rated heavy duty fire rated sliding door for building separation 
applications.
When specifying track and hardware, you must also consider any type of pulls, locking devices, or 
stops that may be required as they are typically not included in the standard track and hardware set.
PROPERTIES
Sliding door track and hanger components are manufactured with diﬀerent weights, thicknesses, and 
materials in order to accommodate the various door sizes, materials, and weights.
Bearings
NEEDLE BEARINGS
Some manufacturers incorporate needle bearings into the hangers in order to help with the lateral or 
side-to-side movement of the hangers with the sliding operation of the door.
Finishes
Tracks have traditionally not been a consideration for aesthetic reasons and were concealed as often 
as possible. In recent years, sliding doors have become more popular with unique track and hanger 
designs being developed to add aesthetic appeal to the opening. Finishes include polished steel or 
stainless steel, polished and satin brass or bronze, and anodized aluminum.
Materials
Tracks are typically available in anodized aluminum, brass, bronze, stainless steel, and steel, depending 
on the manufacturer and availability.
Tracks
Tracks are available in diﬀerent conﬁgurations, which in turn work with speciﬁc hangers, which are 
the mechanisms with rollers that attach the door with brackets and allow the door to slide across 
the track.
BOX SHAPE
This track is square where the top attaches to the top jamb of the framed opening or the face of a wall 
and the wheels suspend the door and slide along the inside of the box. There is an opening at the bot-
tom where the hanger sticks through and attaches to the door. The track can be straight for a single 
sliding door or a pair of bi-parting doors, can be manufactured curved for a curved wall and opening, 
or can be installed parallel in multiples to accommodate a bi-passing application. The track also has 
the option to come manufactured with a fascia, also known as ﬂashing, to cover the track, rollers, and 
hangers behind it.
www.it-ebooks.info

HANGING DEVICES    |    71
GROOVE
This track sits on the ﬂoor and rather than suspend the door from the track, the weight of the door is 
borne on the track and ﬂoor. This type of track typically has grooves that accept sheaves, which are 
metal wheels that glide along the grooves on the track.
TEE SHAPE
This track is shaped like a tee where the rollers grab the vertical portion of the tee on both sides and sus-
pend the door while the horizontal portion of the tee attaches to the top jamb of the framed opening.
ROUND SHAPE
Round tracks typically attach to the top jamb of the framed opening or the face of a wall and the 
wheels suspend the door and can slide along the inside of the tube. There is an opening at the 
bottom where the hanger sticks through and attaches to the door. The track can be straight for a single 
sliding door or a pair of bi-parting doors or can be installed parallel in multiples to accommodate a bi-
passing application.
There are tracks that are tubular in shape where the track is installed on the face of the wall and door 
opening. The hangers rest on top of the tube track and the hangers have their own unique aesthetic 
with the rollers on top instead of rolling along the inside.
Weights
LIGHT
Lightweight track and hangers are available to carry light door weights up to 25 to 75 pounds and are 
not recommended for frequently used openings.
MEDIUM/STANDARD
Medium-weight track and hangers are available to carry light door weights up to 150 to 200 pounds 
and are recommended for medium frequency of use.
HEAVY
Heavyweight track and hangers are available to carry light door weights up to 1,000 pounds and are 
ideal for frequently used openings but can be expensive.
TYPES
Folding
Folding doors are ﬁxed at one end with a top and bottom pivot and slide at the other. The doors fold 
together as you open them and extend next to each other when closed. This application helps save 
space where a swinging door might not have the room to swing all the way open or around due to a 
narrow corridor or other situation.
Folding doors require additional accessories such as hinges to attach the leaves of the folding doors 
together and can be installed in various conﬁgurations such as with two doors to create a single-fold 
door, four doors to create a double-fold door, two single-fold doors to create a pair of folding doors, to 
name a few combinations.
Sliding
Sliding doors can be installed as single doors or pairs of doors with many conﬁgurations available. They 
can be surface-mounted on a wall, bi-passing doors within one opening, single or double in a pocket, 
and even on the ﬂoor with rollers that are called sheaves, which roll along a grooved track on the ﬂoor.

OPTIONS
Side Wall Track
This option is available where the track is mounted on a wall where the ceiling or head of the jamb is 
not perpendicular but rather at a 45-degree angle. The angle of the top of the track where it mounts is 
also at 45 degrees, allowing for proper fastening.
Fascia
A fascia is a decorative cover, which is installed over or manufactured as part of the sliding door track. The 
fascia covers the track and hangers so that they are not visible and only the surface of the covering or fascia 
is seen. The fascia can be painted or coated with an architectural ﬁnish or another type of ﬁnish material.

Guides
Floor guides are available to help guide the doors for optimal use and to help avoid any damage to the 
surrounding conditions.

74    |   HANGING DEVICES
CHANNEL
The channel is installed along the entire length of the bottom of a folding or sliding door opening and 
either surface-mounted or recessed in the ﬂoor. If surface-mounted, it is more likely in an opening that 
is not frequently passed through, such as a closet.
CHANNEL ROLLER
The channel roller is typically a ﬁxed pin or caster to the bottom of the door that ﬁts and rolls along the 
channel guide. This keeps the door straight in the opening and helps prevent the doors from knocking 
into a wall or each other if against a wall, in a pocket, or bi-passing.
FLOOR
Floor guides are available in diﬀerent shapes and sizes to accommodate the diﬀerent types of doors 
and thicknesses available.
SIDEWALL
A sidewall channel is used when the door is mounted on the face of the wall and helps keep the door 
from scraping against and along the wall as it slides across the door opening.
THRESHOLD
A threshold guide is similar to a typical threshold (see Accessories, Types, Thresholds in Chapter 7), 
except the threshold has a groove for a channel roller guide.
Hangers
Hangers are used to hang the door from the track, which typically incorporate rollers, which help the 
door slide easily across the track. Hangers are available in diﬀerent sizes and duties, depending on the 
door size, weight, and frequency of use.
Mounting Brackets
Various mounting brackets are available to accommodate any special installation conditions that might 
exist or arise during construction. Check with various manufacturers or your local door opening con-
sultant.
FIGURE 1.115 Hangers

www.it-ebooks.info

HANGING DEVICES    |    75
Stops
Stops are used to stop a door from sliding past the end of the track and possibly into a wall or frame or 
framed opening side jamb. They can also be installed in a pocket to stop the door in the pocket before 
hitting the wall.
FLOOR
Floor stops are attached to the ﬂoor and can be used to stop the door in the open or closed position.
TRACK
Track stops are attached to the track by screws or a clip, and they create stops for doors to hit up against. 
The stops can either be a hard stop or have a bumper at the end for a softer stop.
WALL
Wall stops or bumpers are attached to the wall or frame or opening side jamb and can be used to stop 
the door in the open or closed position.
QUANTITIES
Tracks and hangers are typically furnished in sets for each door opening. Each track that holds a door 
typically has a set or pair of hangers and rollers. Optional items like stops, pulls, locking devices, and 
special application hardware need to be speciﬁed separately.

APPLICATIONS
Bi-Folding
Bi-folding doors are two-panel doors that are ﬁxed at one end with a top and bottom pivot and slide at 
the other. The doors fold together as you open them and extend next to each other when closed. This 
application helps save space where a swinging door might not have the room to swing all the way open 
or around due to a narrow corridor or other situation.
Bi-folding doors require hinges to attach the leaves of the folding doors together and can be installed 
in various conﬁgurations such as with two doors to create a single-fold door.

HANGING DEVICES    |    77
Bi-Parting
Like a pair of doors that part from each other and separate to open the door, bi-parting doors can 
be surface-mounted on the wall or installed in pockets in the walls. Suspended or floor-mounted 
tracks can be used for this application. Typically, the same track that is used for a single sliding 
door track can be used; the doors are butted up against each other and part from one another as 
they open.
Bi-Passing
Bi-passing doors are installed with two doors next to each other on separate tracks, either aligned or 
on one double track. This allows the doors to pass each other, saving space since there is no need for 
space to swing doors open. Bi-passing doors are typically opened one at a time, hiding behind one 
another, which blocks one side of the door opening. Suspended or ﬂoor-mounted tracks can be used 
for this application.
Face-Mounted
Also known as barn door hardware, sliding doors can be installed where the track is surface-mounted 
to the face of a wall and the door hangs and slides on the front of an opening. When surface-mounted, 
and depending on aesthetic preference, the track is either exposed or a decorative fascia is installed 
to hide the track.
Pocket
Pocket sliding doors conceal half of the track in a pocket in a wall, hiding the door in the wall when 
in the open position. This type of door is the most space-saving type if the wall already exists, 
FIGURE 1.121 Sliding Door Edge Pull

as the door utilizes the existing opening. A suspended track or floor track can be used for this 
application.
POCKET FRAME KITS
Some manufacturers oﬀer pocket frame kits, which include all of the necessary parts required to install 
a pocket door; some include framing for door openings that are not already framed.
Patch Fittings
Patch-ﬁtting hangers are available for glass doors that do not have top or bottom rails to accept stan-
dard track hangers. The ﬁttings are attached to both sides of the glass, sandwiching it in between.

Coordinating the glass thickness with the patch ﬁtting is necessary to ensure the glass will ﬁt into the 
patch ﬁttings properly.
Single
Single sliding doors can be installed on a wall and over the door opening, in a pocket, or a folding 
door.

80    |   HANGING DEVICES
Floor-Mounted
Aldo known as sheaves and track, this application sits on the ﬂoor and rather than suspend the 
door from the track, the weight of the door is borne on the track and ﬂoor. This type of track 
typically has grooves that accept sheaves, which are metal wheels that glide along the grooves 
on the track.
Soﬃt-Mounted
Soﬃt-mounted tracks, or tracks installed on the top jamb of a frame or door opening, are a typical track 
installation. The fasteners go up through the track and secure the track to the head, which holds the 
weight of the folding or sliding door.
INSTALLATION
Sliding door hardware can be installed on the face of the wall over the opening with brackets to sus-
pend the track, underneath the frame head or framed opening on the soﬃt, or on the ﬂoor with sheaves 
and track rather than hangers and track.
Fasteners
Track and hangers are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood or metal 
door and frame material installation. Phillips and ﬂat-head screws are available, depending on the man-
ufacturer’s standard, and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, security 
stud, and torx.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.
Locations
Each manufacturer typically recommends installation requirements and locations for fasteners and 
devices in order for track and hangers or sheaves to operate properly.
Preparations
Doors, frames or framed openings, and ﬂoors are typically not prepared for track and hangers prior to 
installation, as they are surface-mounted for the most part. Sheaves for ﬂoor track might be prepared, 
as they are recessed in the bottom of the door; it is best to coordinate and conﬁrm with your door 
manufacturer.
Preparations that will likely take place at the door and frame factories along with manufacturing are 
recessed pulls and locking and strike devices. Whether recessed at the edge or on the face of the door, 
these pulls and devices require preparation prior to installation.
REFERENCES
Codes and standards are available to set the minimum requirements of door openings (see Introduc-
tion of this book for more information). Some jurisdictions have speciﬁc codes and standards, which 
were either modiﬁed from another existing code or created for their own use.

Now that the door is hanging, the next part of the sequence is to secure the door.
When specifying any type of electriﬁed hardware, operations descriptions, also known as operations 
narratives, should always be used. These descriptions are short paragraphs that describe the operation 
of every part of the opening from either side, so that the designer, installer, and user can all have the 
same understanding of what is supposed to happen at the opening at any given time. Also required 
should be elevation and point-to-point diagrams. Elevations provide an overview of what the opening 
looks like with all of the components of the system connected. The point-to-point shows the system 
connections as well, but is geared more toward the actual wiring, including the colors and connections 
of each. A logic diagram might be used by the person who designed the system in order to lay out the 
“logic” of the system ﬂow and process.
Some electriﬁed devices are now being manufactured with solar power; that is, they get their power 
either fully or partially from the sun in order to operate. This might be beneﬁcial for a very remote site 
that might require some type of electriﬁed locking device, where it is not feasible to monitor or change 
the batteries.
INACTIVE LEAF OF PAIRS OF DOORS
When specifying or scheduling a pair of doors, the inactive leaf is always secured ﬁrst. Logistically, if the 
inactive leaf of a pair of doors is not secured ﬁrst, then the active leaf has nothing to secure itself into, 
leaving both of them unsecure and vulnerable. In other words, the inactive leaf must act as the ﬁxed 
material that the frame or wall would be for a single door opening.
Once we have secured the inactive leaf of a pair, or if we are specifying a single door opening only, the 
proper securing device is then speciﬁed. There are many factors, options, and preferences to take into 
account when securing the opening, including function, code, aesthetics, sustainability, and personal 
preference.

BOLTS
Also Known As: Flushbolts, Surface Bolts, Slide Bolts
DESCRIPTION
Bolts are used primarily to secure the inactive leaf of a pair of doors so that the active leaf has the ability 
to be secured into the inactive leaf. This can be accomplished using several applications, depending on 
the function of the door opening and its related codes.
Manual ﬂushbolts are typically the most common means to secure an inactive leaf of a pair of nonﬁre 
rated doors, and they are also known as lever extension ﬂushbolts. Automatic ﬂushbolts are typically 
used to secure ﬁre rated doors, and self-latching ﬂushbolts are another available type.
Although bolts are most commonly used, exit hardware might be used instead to secure the inactive 
leaf, typically when both leaves of the pair of doors are active or when life safety codes require both 
doors of the pair for egress. Other ways to secure an inactive door are surface-mounted manual slide 
bolts and Cremone bolts, which are decorative surface bolts typically operated by a knob or lever.
PROPERTIES
Bolts are typically manufactured as a piece of solid metal like a pin or rod, which extends out or oﬀ of 
a door and into a frame, wall, or door and into a strike plate. The extension or throw of the bolt can be 
done manually or automatically, and it can be mounted on the surface or face of the door or frame, or 
recessed and ﬂush within the door. Flushbolts are typically pins or rods housed in a metal casing for 
installation into a recessed pocket in the edge of the door.
Corners
RADIUS
Radius corner bolts and or housings are rounded at the edges instead of having square corners and 
do not aﬀect the operation of the device, only the aesthetics. Radius corners are most typically used 
on residential applications, although they are available and able to be used in commercial operations.
SQUARE CORNER
Square corner bolts and or housings are square-edged and are most typically used in the commercial 
industry, although they are available and able to be used in residential applications as well.
Finishes
Depending on the manufacturer’s availability, bolts are typically available in most architectural ﬁnishes. 
They are not usually available in a prime ﬁnish, which is typically used for painted applications that 
would match the door and or frame; plated ﬁnishes are most commonly used. Sometimes ﬁnished 
products are painted the same color and at the same time as the door, frame, and surrounding areas. 
Painting the device is not recommended as it might cause the paint to dry in places where there are 
moving parts, prohibiting the device from operating properly or at all.
Painting bolts or anything onsite is not recommended as it will contribute to poor air quality for those 
working on and eventually working in the space. Using a manufacturer’s factory ﬁnish might even help 
contribute to credits toward a current or future green building standard, code, or certiﬁcation.
Grades
With strict guidelines for testing, bolts are rated in grades 1, 2, and 3 for various types of tests including 
impact, friction, and cycle tests.
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    87
IMPACT
Impact tests rate the impact of force against the opening in the same direction of the door swing. 
The impact is typically oﬀ center on the door where the bolts are installed.
FRICTION
Friction tests measure the retraction of the bolt with a weight load to the bolt against the strike in the 
direction of the door swing. Typically, the weight load will make it more diﬃcult and, if very heavy, will 
prevent the bolt from retracting at all.
CYCLE
Cycle tests measure the full extension and retraction of the bolt into and out of the strike. In other words, 
the bolts are engaged and disengaged over and over again until they meet ANSI/BHMA minimum 
requirements or fail to work properly.
Materials
Bolts are manufactured from various materials, including aluminum, brass, bronze, stainless steel, or 
steel. The material type speciﬁed and installed can depend on the door opening application and ﬁre 
rating requirements.
If a door opening is ﬁre rated, the material tested and approved is likely steel, since it can withstand the 
high temperatures of a ﬁre for a certain period of time. If anything other than a steel base is installed 
on a ﬁre rated door opening and a ﬁre occurs, the metal might melt enough to cause the opening to 
fail, allowing the ﬁre to spread from one side of the opening to the other prematurely of the actual ﬁre 
rating of the door.
Automatic bolts and ﬂushbolts are manufactured speciﬁcally to the door material, whether wood or 
metal. Typically, bolts for metal doors are mortised into a cutout in the edge of the door several inches 
down from the top corner of the door. Because wood doors are typically weaker when mortised for 
door hardware, bolts for wood doors are typically mortised into the edge of the door at the top corner 
and wrap around the top of the door for a more secure installation.
Ratings 
NONFIRE RATED
Nonﬁre rated bolts can only be used on doors that are not ﬁre rated openings and would typically be of 
the manual type, as they are not able to latch automatically at the time of a ﬁre.
FIRE RATED
Fire rated bolts should only be applied to ﬁre rated doors, although they can be used on nonﬁre rated 
as well for function. Fire rated bolts are typically of the automatic type, so they can latch automatically 
at the time of a ﬁre to protect the nonﬁre side of the opening from the ﬁre side.
Sizes
Bolts are available in diﬀerent lengths, depending on the door height and reach necessary to operate 
the bolt.
AUTOMATIC FLUSHBOLTS
Typically a small bolt at the very top and bottom edges of the door, these devices operate automatically 
and do not need to be reached or accessed to operate. Therefore, the top is typically out of reach 
without help from a stool or ladder.
www.it-ebooks.info

88    |   SECURING DEVICES
MANUAL FLUSHBOLTS
Typically furnished with 12-inch rods, the device can be reached and operated by reaching your arm up 
or down and ﬂipping the lever. With taller than normal doors, or doors over 7-feet high, options exist 
for longer rods, which means the device can be installed lower on the edge of the door so that it can 
still be reached and operated manually.
SURFACE BOLTS
Surface bolts are available in many standard and custom lengths from several inches to several feet in 
length.
TYPES
Automatic
Automatic ﬂushbolts are actuated by triggers at the edge of the door. When the active door closes into 
the inactive door, the triggers are depressed into the bolt mechanism and the bolts are projected into 
the head of the frame and the ﬂoor automatically. When the active door is pulled or pushed into the

SECURING DEVICES    |    89
open position, the same triggers are released, which in turn retracts the bolts automatically. Once the 
bolts are retracted, the inactive door is released and can be swung into the open position.
Automatic ﬂushbolts are not only used on pairs of doors when the doors need to be accessible for 
convenience or to move wide equipment or furniture through the opening, but also they would be one 
of very few options to secure a pair of ﬁre rated doors. Fire rated doors must latch and secure on their 
own when a ﬁre condition occurs, so manual or self-latching doors would not be an option, as they 
must be set up manually by someone to lock the door, whereas automatic doors will always do the job 
without any help. There are some exceptions to having to use automatic ﬂushbolts on pairs of ﬁre rated 
doors. For example, in rooms that are typically not inhabited by humans, such as a mechanical room 
housing a transformer or a storage room, manual bolts, either surface- or ﬂush mounted, can be used 
where acceptable to the AHJ on the inactive leaf of a pair of doors.
Cremone
A cremone bolt is a surface-mounted top and bottom bolt that is most typically used in residential 
applications and for its aesthetic properties. The top and bottom bolts are operated by a knob or lever that 
when rotated, retracts or extends the bolts into the head of a frame or door opening and ﬂoor, allowing 
the door to be unlocked or locked. As with the surface bolt, cremone bolts are ideal for retroﬁtting 
applications due to the lack of door preparation required to install the device, and they are also typically 
installed on narrow stile doors, where a minimal amount of space is available for a locking device.
Dutch Door 
Dutch door bolts are typically used for one type of door, you guessed it, a Dutch door, which is a single 
door with top and bottom leaves. A Dutch door bolt is used to secure the top leaf into the bottom leaf, 
FIGURE 2.3 Dutch Door Bolts
(Source: Courtesy of Rockwood® Manufacturing Company)
www.it-ebooks.info

90    |   SECURING DEVICES
most commonly used where a low need of security or traﬃc control is required. This application allows 
the ability to pass things through the top leaf when it is in the open position while the bottom leaf is 
closed; for example, in a coat check room, library storage, or any other type of room that is not public. 
FIGURE 2.4 Dutch Door Diagram
(Source: Courtesy of Ceco Door)
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    91
A Dutch door would indicate that only those authorized should pass through, while allowing coats, 
books, or anything else that the doorway might be used for to be passed through it without opening 
the door fully and allowing unauthorized people to pass through.
Fire
A ﬁre bolt is a heat-sensitive device that projects out of the bottom edge of a door and into the sec-
ond door in the pair when the core of the door reaches a certain temperature, typically 230 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Although automatic in a sense, this bolt is not allowed on ﬁre rated doors unless used with 
a tested and listed automatic top bolt or top rod ﬁre exit hardware. This bolt does not require the use 
of a dust-proof strike.
Manual
Manual bolts are actuated just as their name says, manually, and the bolt of a ﬂushbolt is thrown or 
retraced with a ﬂip lever. The ﬂip lever is typically recessed in the edge of the bolt mechanism and is 
ﬂush with the device when the bolt is fully thrown or retracted. This would not only be aesthetically 
beneﬁcial but is required for operation so that the door can swing into the frame without any 
obstructions.
A surface bolt, also known as a slide bolt, is manually slid across a surface, typically a door into a 
strike on the frame. Surface bolts are available in many sizes and thicknesses, depending on the 
door size and security level of the opening you are trying to secure. For higher security, some surface 
bolts are available with a cylinder that requires a key to release the bolt in order to slide it.

92    |   SECURING DEVICES
Self-Latching
The least speciﬁed and installed type of ﬂushbolt, self-latching bolts are a combination of manual and 
automatic, where the triggers and bolts can be set to latch manually or automatically, depending on 
the required function and operation of the door opening.
OPTIONS
Dust-Proof Strike
When bolts are speciﬁed and installed on inactive leaves of pairs of doors, a typical surface or recessed 
rectangular strike is furnished with the device to accept the bolt when engaged in order to secure 
the door. Another option to the standard strikes supplied is the dust-proof strike, which is typically 
mounted on the ﬂoor (but could be used in the head). The dust-proof strike has a spring and cover, 
which is depressed when the bolt is projected and springs back ﬂush to the surface to cover the hole 
when the bolt is retracted.
The main function of the strike is to protect the opening that accepts the bolt from dirt buildup, typi-
cally more so on the ﬂoor, so the bolt can project fully every time it is engaged. If a standard strike is

SECURING DEVICES    |    93
used, every time someone walked over it, cleaned the area with a mop or broom, or just everyday dust 
accumulation, the buildup would eventually prevent the bolt from engaging fully, as the dirt would be 
ﬁlling the void instead.
Extended Rod
Extended rods are available for manual ﬂushbolts for doors that are taller than 7 feet. This means the 
ﬂip lever that operates the device can be low enough at the edge of the door while having a long 
enough rod to extend to the frame head or opening in order to secure the opening properly.

94    |   SECURING DEVICES
Nonkeyed
Most slide bolts are manufactured without a key and just slide across the door into the strike, which is 
typically applied to the frame or door if it is one of a pair.
Keyed
Some manufacturers oﬀer slide bolts with a key so that the bolt cannot be extended or retracted without 
the use of the key. Again, most commonly, we might see this on the exterior of a home on a storage door 
or a barn-type door, or in a warehouse where recessing a conventional locking device is not feasible.
Rabbet Kits
For doors that are manufactured with a rabbet at the edge, accessories such as a rabbetted face plate 
and strike guide are available to accommodate this conﬁguration.
QUANTITIES
Depending on their application, function, and governing codes, bolts can be furnished as single pieces 
or in a pair.
SINGLE
Typically, a surface-mounted bolt would be furnished as a single device and used in the middle of a 
door opening to secure it to a wall or another door.

FIGURE 2.12 Flushbolt Rabbet Kit
(Source: Courtesy of Rockwood® Manufacturing Company)
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    95
Flushbolts could be used as single pieces, either at the top of the door or bottom, as long as they 
are in compliance with codes and standards for application, function, and ﬁre rating. An example of a 
single-use manual ﬂushbolt is a moving partition that needs to be secured at the bottom only from the 
secure side of the door.
PAIR
Most bolts are furnished in top and bottom in pairs in order to secure the door opening to the frame or 
framed opening and ﬂoor.
APPLICATIONS
Flush
Flushbolts are typically installed in pairs, one at the top edge of the door and one at the bottom edge. 
This helps to maximize securing the door to its surrounding elements, typically the door frame and 
ﬂoor or saddle on the ﬂoor.
Flushbolts are manufactured to be installed in a speciﬁc door material, whether it is wood, aluminum, 
or other metal. In order to maximize securing, a strike would be installed on the head and ﬂoor for the 
bolt to engage into when in the locked or “thrown” position.
Surface
A surface bolt, sometimes referred to as a slide bolt, cannot be used on ﬁre rated doors because it is a 
manually operated device.
Typically used on existing openings in a retroﬁtting application, surface bolts can be used on the inside 
of a door to secure it from the inside only or possibly on the outside of a door to simply keep the door 
in the closed position. The strike is applied to the frame, other door in a pair, or ﬂoor, and the bolt slides 
across the face of the door, frame, or wall, and into the strike to secure the opening.
Surface bolts are not commonly speciﬁed locking devices commercially, but are more prevalent in a 
residential application. However, you will see them used in warehouses and heavy door openings that 
must stay in the closed position but not be locked. These bolts have guides that help the device slide 
along the face of a door or opening properly and in line to meet the strike at the other end.

96    |   SECURING DEVICES
INSTALLATION
Bolts are typically installed in pairs as a top and bottom set, although they can be installed as a single. 
Flushbolts are usually installed at the top and bottom edge of the strike or latch side thickness of a 
door; this provides a consistent and equal-locking position, and rigidity of the door at both the top 
and bottom of the opening. Slide or surface bolts can be used for various functions, to secure the 
inactive leaf of a pair of nonﬁre rated doors, where the bolts would be installed at the top and bottom 
edge of the door strike or latch side thickness of a door. In both situations, the bolts latch or slide into 
the head of the frame or jamb and the ﬂoor or threshold if installed. If a slide bolt is used on a single 
door, it might be installed at the center on the latch edge of the door and secure itself into the frame 
or adjacent wall.

SECURING DEVICES    |    97
When installing bolts that latch into the ﬂoor or threshold if installed, it is recommended to include a 
dust-proof strike for the bolt to extend or latch into (see Dust-Proof Strike in this chapter).
If a bolt is being installed on a stile and rail door, always conﬁrm the lock stile dimension to ensure that 
the bolt will have enough room to be installed.
Fasteners
Bolts are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood or metal door and frame 
material installation. Phillips and ﬂat-head screws are available depending on the manufacturer’s 
standard, and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, security stud, and torx.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.
Locations
Bolts are typically installed at the top and bottom edge of the strike or latch side thickness of a door and 
latch or slide into the head of the frame or jamb and the ﬂoor or threshold if installed. If a slide bolt is 
used on a single door, it might be installed at the center on the latch edge of the door and secure itself 
into the frame or adjacent wall.
Always refer to the manufacturer’s recommendations, standards, and codes relevant to the bolt being 
installed.
Preparations
Flush, recessed, or mortised bolt preparations are typically machined and reinforced by the manufac-
turer at the factory. Surface-mounted bolts typically require less or no factory preparation and can be 
installed in the ﬁeld.

CYLINDERS FOR LOCKING DEVICES
Also Known As: Cylinders
DESCRIPTION
Cylinders are typically operated by keys, which are what operate 98 percent of locked or secured doors 
today, although as the cost goes down and newer technologies and types of electriﬁed locking devices 
become available, that percentage will continually shrink.
Cylinders are manufactured as a housing and plug with pins and springs that move when a key is 
inserted. This must create a consistent shear line, which allows for the key to rotate the plug in the hous-
ing, turning the tail piece of the cam, in turn allowing the latch or deadbolt to be retracted or extended 
to open or secure the locking device and door.
The triangular shapes that appear as peaks and valleys at diﬀerent distances across the key are known 
as the blade, and the part of the key that sticks out of the cylinder is the bow. The peaks and valleys 
match the diﬀerent pin sizes inside the cylinder, and the springs are installed underneath the pins to 
give them tension when the key is inserted.
PROPERTIES
Mechanical cylinders are typically manufactured with a metal housing that has a plug, which is where 
the key is inserted, along with springs, pins, and a cam to operate.
Electronic cylinders are available from some manufacturers where, in addition to the mechanical components 
of a cylinder, there is an electronic component that needs to match the key as well, sending a signal between 
the key bow and the cylinder to ensure the key is intended to open that particular cylinder. Basically, this is a 
second level of security to verify that the mechanical key is not an unauthorized duplication.
Cam
With the rotation of the plug also comes the rotation of the cam on the back of the cylinder, which 
operates the locking device itself. The cam is a small piece of metal that has a particular shape to

SECURING DEVICES    |    99
operate the speciﬁc mechanisms inside of a lock body or chassis, in order to rotate and trigger the 
proper operation of the locking device.
Finishes
Depending on the manufacturer, cylinders are typically available in all architectural ﬁnishes to match 
the other speciﬁed hardware on the opening.
Painting cylinders or anything on site is not recommended as it will contribute to poor air quality for 
those working in the space. Using a manufacturer’s factory ﬁnish might even help contribute to credits 
toward a current or future green building standard, code, or certiﬁcation.
Collar
A cylinder collar surrounds the cylinder between the its face and the door or surface upon which it is 
installed. The collar provides the separation or acts as a spacer so that there is no void and the cylinder 
sits ﬂush against the door. Without the collar, the cylinder might be exposed for tampering.

FIGURE 2.24 Cylinder Collar 
(Source: Courtesy of SARGENT® Manufacturing Company)
Grades
Although cylinders are not typically referred to in grades, ANSI/BHMA A156.5 American National Stan-
dard for Cylinders and Input Devices for Locks, 2010, describes grades 1, 2, and 3. The grading tests 
include operational, ﬁnish, and security tests. These tests include torque to rotate cylinder plug, cyl-
inder body or housing tension and torque tests, cycle testing, cylinder plug pulling tests, and cylinder 
plug torque tests.

Housing
All of the components, including the cylinder plug, springs, and pins all come together in the housing 
where they work together in order to operate the cylinder.
Keying
The subjects of keying and master keying should have their own manuscript and reference guide, more 
suitably written by a master locksmith, one of which I am not, but several of whom I have close friend-
ships. With that said, I will give a brief overview of keying in general.
Not including the various levels of security that cylinders have as options, keying can be very simple or 
very complicated. Cylinders can be individually keyed, also known as keyed diﬀerent, or KD, or a change 
key. They can also be master keyed at various levels.

SECURING DEVICES    |    101
Keying is done with mathematics. There are certain calculations, depending on the number of pins in a 
cylinder, whether it be 5 pins or 6 pins, with or without sidebars or various levels to create the matching 
shear line in order to rotate the plug in the housing to operate the locking device.
Master Keying
Master keying is the art of creating a master key system, pinning, and operation of a key and cylinder. 
A master key is a key that opens all or part of the locks in a system, but there can also be various levels 
of master keying. An example is a ﬂoor master key where the ﬂoor master only opens a respective ﬂoor, 
such as the third ﬂoor, while the grand master key opens all of the locksets on the ﬁrst, second, and 
third ﬂoors. A great grand master key would open several buildings, say, in a global company or several 
buildings on one site like a campus. This way the CEO or any other executive requiring access to all or 
certain parts of a facility would only need to carry one key and it would operate no matter where he or 
she traveled.
Another type of master key is the janitor key, which would only open the janitor closets in a building, or 
an exterior master, where the key would only open all perimeter doors.
Materials
Cylinders are typically manufactured from cast, forged, or wrought extruded aluminum, brass, or 
bronze. Some other options available are stainless steel, iron, wrought steel, and zinc alloys.
Pin
The pins and springs are aligned in length with the key cutouts so that the shear line or multiple shear 
lines in a multilevel master key system can be created. Some manufacturers oﬀer higher security cylin-
ders where there are additional alignments that need to take place in addition to the main shear line, 
such as side bar alignment.
Plug
A key has various depth cutouts along the top of the blade that protrudes out of the bow, which is what 
our ﬁngers grab onto in order to rotate the key in the cylinder. These cutouts need to align with what is 
known as the shear line inside of the cylinder plug so that the plug will rotate in the cylinder housing.
FIGURE 2.28 Simple Master Key System Illustration
(Source: Courtesy of Rockwood® Manufacturing Company)
www.it-ebooks.info

102    |   SECURING DEVICES
Side Bar
Some manufacturers oﬀer higher-security cylinders, where there are additional alignments that need 
to take place in addition to the main shear line, such as side bar alignment. The cylinders are manufac-
tured with bars along the sides that require the key to have grooves to accept those side bars; otherwise 
the key will not enter the cylinder plug at all.
Spring
The springs and pins are aligned in length with the key cutouts so that the shear line or multiple shear 
lines in a multilevel master key system can be created.
TYPES
Conventional
Conventional cylinders are available for all applications. The face of the cylinder, or housing, is round 
with a round center, or plug, where the key is inserted. As described above, the shear line must be cre-
ated in order to rotate the key. A conventional cylinder can only be installed and replaced by taking 
apart the locking device, which can be time consuming and costly in labor.
Electronic
Electronic cylinders are the current and next-generation technology for locking and unlocking devices. 
Similar in design to mechanical cylinders, electronic cylinders require the use of power to verify the 
electronic credentials of the key, in addition to the mechanical blade.
Some electronic cylinders have the ability to keep an audit trail of the opening of the cylinder, so 
that it is known which key opened what door at what time of the day or night, giving another layer of 
key control.
FIGURE 2.29 Electronic Cylinder and Key

European
European cylinders are uniquely shaped cylinders manufactured for locksets made in Europe. They 
have a round plug area similar to a conventional cylinder, with an elongated top portion where the pins 
and springs are, rather than a round housing all around.

SECURING DEVICES    |    103
OPTIONS
High Security
The most expensive type of mechanical cylinder and key is high security. Similar to the security type, only 
those authorized to make duplicates at the time the original cylinders and keys were ordered are allowed 
to have copies made of those keys. Since the keys and cylinders are factory keyed and controlled, one 
would not be able to ﬁnd a locksmith that would have the key blanks available to make duplicates, adding 
security to the cylinder and keys.
Additionally, high-security cylinders are drill and pick resistant. Not to say that they cannot be drilled 
through or picked, but it would take a long time to do so compared to standard, patented, or security 
cylinders, as the cylinder is made of a higher-density metal that would not allow a standard drill bit to 
penetrate easily. These types of cylinders are typically required to meet the standards of UL437, The 
Standard for Safety of Keyed Locks.
Interchangeable Core
Also known as a removable core, the interchangeable core is in the shape of a ﬁgure eight within the 
round face, or housing of the cylinder. Although costing more than a conventional cylinder, the ﬁgure 
eight core can be removed from the housing with a control key, which is unique and made speciﬁcally 
to do so. This can save time and labor costs when having to either rekey or replace the cylinder and keys 
for a particular lock or facility with numerous replacement requirements.
Large Format
Interchangeable cores are manufactured in two sizes, depending on the manufacturer and available 
options. Large format is the bigger of the two interchangeable core types, but it functions the same as 
the small format.

104    |   SECURING DEVICES
Patented
Patented mechanical cylinders and keys have a little more security and cost slightly more than standard 
type, where the cylinders cannot be duplicated at just any hardware store. One would have to know 
who holds the patent and has the ability to duplicate these keys by doing some research and tracking 
them down. Once it is known who has the ability to copy the keys, the security of patented cylinders is 
the same as that for standard ones—ﬁnd the key blanks needed, which most hardware stores carry, and 
get the copies made, no questions asked.
Patented cylinders can also be “picked” easily, if the person attempting to do so has the experience. 
This is done by using ﬁne metal tools inserted into the plug of the cylinder to manipulate the pins and 
springs to create the necessary shear line.
Security
Security mechanical cylinders and keys cost more than patented, but there is a big diﬀerence in secu-
rity. Only those authorized to make duplicates at the time the original cylinders and keys were ordered 
are allowed to have copies made of those keys. Typically the parts are factory keyed and controlled, so 
one would not be able to ﬁnd a locksmith that would have the key blanks available to make duplicates, 
adding security to the cylinder and keys.
Security cylinders are also manufactured with multiple layers of pins and springs, and additional side 
bar pins and springs that are diﬃcult to pick.
Small Format
Small format is the smaller of the two interchangeable core types, but functions the same as large 
format.
Software
Some manufacturers oﬀer software to assist with creating, managing, and maintaining keying mechan-
ical systems. This software can typically be installed on any standard computer and can be very basic

or comprehensive. Electronic cylinders and keys typically require unique software to manage the 
particular system. This software might also manage not just the keying system but also the entire secu-
rity system or more, such as the entire building system, including ﬁre alarms, HVAC (heating, ventilation, 
and air conditioning), lighting, and anything else that might be tied into the building’s infrastructure.
Standard
Standard mechanical cylinders and keys are the least expensive and least secure type of cylinder. They 
are manufactured with single pins and springs, and the keys for these types of cylinders can be dupli-
cated at just about any hardware store that makes keys. This is not ideal for a facility or opening that 
requires key control and security, knowing who has a key for that particular device or system at all time.
If someone with a standard cylinder and key knows they have a tendency to lose them, or wants to 
give copies to anyone they choose, they can simply go to a hardware store, ﬁnd the key blanks needed, 
which most carry, and get the copies made, no questions asked.
Standard cylinders can also be picked easily, if the person attempting to do so has the experience. 
This is done by using ﬁne metal tools inserted into the plug of the cylinder to manipulate the pins and 
springs to create the necessary shear line.
QUANTITIES
Cylinders are typically installed in singles on the secure or outside of the door or opening, unless the 
lockset’s function requires two. If a function requires that a cylinder be installed on the inside of the 
door in addition to the outside, the function of the lockset can vary so that the cylinder locks or unlocks 
the inside in order to get out, which would typically be a code violation except for certain types of 
building occupancies. The other function would be that the cylinder on the inside of the door operates, 
or locks and unlocks the outside of the door, for instance in a classroom environment.
APPLICATIONS
Bored Lock
Also known as cylindrical locks, bored lock cylinders are used for bored or cylindrical type locksets. 
These cylinders are installed in the knob or lever handle, and either have a tail piece or match up to a 
turn piece in the chassis, or body of the locking device. This allows the key to turn and rotate the latch 
of the lockset in order to retract it so that the door can be opened.

106    |   SECURING DEVICES
Mortise
Mortise cylinders are most commonly used for mortise locksets, where the cylinder is recessed in a hole 
that matches the location of the cylinder hole in a mortise lockset.
Mortise cylinders are also used with mortise lock exit devices, mortise deadlocks, and key switches, 
which are used as an option to electronic access control systems to turn the system on and oﬀ fully. 
Unlike the rim cylinder, where a long tailpiece extends to operate the locking device, a mortise cylinder 
has a cam on the back, which rotates when the key is inserted and turned, and operates the locking 
device to retract the latch or deadbolt of the lockset.
FIGURE 2.34 Mortise Cylinder
(Source: Courtesy of SARGENT® Manufacturing Company)
FIGURE 2.35 Rim Cylinder
(Source: Courtesy of SARGENT® Manufacturing Company)
Rim
Rim cylinders are available for various types of locking hardware, depending on how the devices are 
manufactured, and typically sit on the rim of the trim, not fully mortised into the door or locking device. 
The rim cylinder has a long tailpiece, which extends into the opening and locking device in order to 
lock and unlock it. They are used most commonly on rim locks, which are residential type locks that are 
used as a secondary device to the lever or knob lock, also known as a deadbolt, used to retract the main 
latch in order to open the door.
Rim cylinders are also required on certain types of exit hardware trim, again depending on how it is 
manufactured, again with the long tailpiece of the cylinder extending into the door and locking device 
in order to lock or unlock it.

SECURING DEVICES    |    107
INSTALLATION
Cylinders are typically installed into the locking device, either into the lever or knob handle, the surface-
mounted locking device, or directly into the face of the door if the locking device is mortised into the 
door. Cylinders are typically manufactured speciﬁc to the manufacturer of the locking device and will 
not typically work in another manufacturer’s device without modiﬁcation, and even if they do, they 
might not work properly or for very long. With that said, there are some manufacturers that make their 
cylinders to operate in another manufacturer’s device intentionally, and in that case the cylinder should 
operate just as if it were made by the original locking device’s manufacturer. There are also third-party 
cylinder manufacturers that only make cylinders to operate in other manufacturers’ locking devices, as 
they do not manufacture locking devices themselves.
Fasteners
Depending on the type, cylinders are typically fastened into the locking device with screws from 
behind, by a set screw on the side, or simply by securing them tightly inside of a handle or knob without 
room to move. Cylinders are typically furnished with their respective fasteners, depending on the type 
and application.
Locations
Cylinders are typically installed into the locking device on the face of the door at locations recom-
mended by the manufacturer, industry standards, and codes. The locations are typically measured 
from the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
STANDARD STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Standard steel doors and frames are recommended to have the locking device and cylinders installed 
at various heights, depending on the locking device type. Knob and lever handle locksets, as well 
as exit device trim are recommended to be installed with a centerline of 40 5/16 inches above the 
ﬁnished ﬂoor, while deadlocks are recommended to be installed with a centerline of 48 inches above 
the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
CUSTOM STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Custom steel doors and frames are recommended to have the locking device and cylinders installed at 
various heights, depending on the locking device type. Knob and lever handle locksets, as well as exit 
device trim, are recommended to be installed with a centerline of 38 inches above the ﬁnished ﬂoor, 
while deadlocks are recommended to be installed with a centerline of 46 inches above the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
FLUSH WOOD DOORS AND FRAMES
Flush wood doors and frames are recommended to have the locking device and cylinders installed 
at various heights, depending on the locking device type. Knob and lever handle locksets, as well as 
exit device trim, are recommended to be installed with a centerline of 40 5/16 inches above the 
ﬁnished ﬂoor, while deadlocks are recommended to be installed with a centerline of 48 inches above 
the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
Preparations
When installed into a mortise locking device directly into the face of the door, cylinder preparations can 
be machined at the factory as recommended, but this is sometimes accomplished in the ﬁeld by the 
installer. When installed into a knob or lever handle device, the cylinder hole is in the hardware, which 
is on the face of the door, so a separate preparation hole is not required.

DOOR POSITION SWITCHES
Also Known As: Door Contacts, DPS, Door Status Switch, Magnetic Contact
DESCRIPTION
Although it could be as simple as a single device trigger depressed by a door when it closes into a frame, 
the typical door position switch is a magnetic device that is wired to an alarm and/or computer system. 
A typical application would signal when the door is in the open position and not properly in the frame.
The newest in electromechanical locking devices is to have a door position switch built into the locking 
device itself. With that said, the door position switch signal does not necessarily mean that the door 
is latched, locked, and secure, but there are other devices that can assist with that including a latch 
position switch and electromechanical locking devices. The signal can be sent one or more ways, 
including as a local alarm at the door, a remote alarm at one’s computer, or a text message to a cell 
phone.
PROPERTIES
Door position switches are typically manufactured from metal, plastic, and wire components and are 
usually to be housed in a plastic body.
Finishes
Door position switches can typically be found with white, gray, tan, brown, and black plastic ﬁnishes. 
Heavy-duty door position switches are typically manufactured with a metal housing and ﬁnish.
Grades
Door position switches are not referred to in grades and the quality is described by operation and the 
UL tests that they pass in order to comply with standards for operation.
Materials
Door position switches are typically manufactured with a plastic body or housing with metal and 
wire components inside. Heavy-duty door position switches are typically manufactured with a metal 
housing in lieu of plastic with a heavy-duty metal casing surrounding the wires.
Shapes
Both surface-mounted and concealed type door contacts are available from various manufacturers in 
a rectangular shape, while concealed ones are also available in a round shape.
TYPES
Magnetic
The magnetic door position switch is installed with two parts as a set with the primary intent to moni-
tor and signal the state of the opening. One of the two parts of the switch is installed on the door and 
one on the frame, which line up and make contact when the door is in the closed position in the frame.
Trigger
The trigger door position switch is typically installed with one part on the frame. When the door swings 
closed and rests against the trigger, which can be a roller ball for example, that would indicate that the 
door is in the closed position in the frame.
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    109
OPTIONS
Other than ﬁnish and installation options such as surface-mounted or concealed, there are no options 
available for the door position switch.
QUANTITIES
Trigger door position switches are typically installed as a single unit surface-mounted on or mortised 
into the frame. Magnetic door position switches are typically installed as a set with two parts, one 
surface-mounted on or mortised into the door frame and one surface-mounted on or mortised into the 
door to match the frame installation.
APPLICATIONS
Concealed
Concealed door position switches are typically installed with new construction applications and are not 
visible unless the door is in the open position in the frame.
Surface Mounted
Surface-mounted door position switches are typically installed with retroﬁt applications and are 
installed onto the face of the door and frame.
INSTALLATION
Surface-mounted door position switches are typically installed on the face of the door and frame and 
can be mounted anywhere on the typical three-sided perimeter of the door opening in the frame, but 
are typically installed along the top end.
Concealed door position switches are typically installed in the center of the head of a door and frame 
and cannot be seen when the door is in the closed position in the frame.
Fasteners
Door position switches are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood or 
metal door and frame material installation. Phillips and ﬂat head are available depending on the

manufacturer’s standard, and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, 
security stud, and torx.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.
Locations
Door position switches should be coordinated between the door, frame, and hardware supplier and 
installed at locations as recommended by the manufacturer.
Preparations
Door position switch preparations for concealed devices are typically machined at the factory while 
surface-mounted installations are typically done in the ﬁeld. Due to the surface mount, no preparations 
other than drilling and tapping the screw holes are required.
DUMMY TRIM
Also Known As: Dummy Handles, Dummy Levers, Dummy Knobs, Inactive Trim
DESCRIPTION
Dummy handles are rigid handles that do not operate and are typically installed on the inactive leaf of 
a pair of doors. Dummy trim can also be used as a pull handle on an active door.
PROPERTIES
Dummy trim is made up of components such as a handle, rosette or escutcheon, mounting hardware, 
and spindle that come together to create the dummy trim.
Finishes
Depending on the manufacturer’s availability, dummy trim is typically available in all architectural 
hardware metal ﬁnishes, while some manufacturers might oﬀer special materials and ﬁnishes like 
plastic. Depending on the aesthetic and cost choices made, dummy trim is typically speciﬁed with 
ﬁnishes to match the hanging and/or other hardware on the opening.
Grades
ANSI/BHMA A156 American National Standards for the various types of latching and locking devices all 
refer to grades 1, 2, and 3. The minimum standards for each type of test vary depending on the latchset 
or lockset type. The testing includes operational tests such as torque and strength, security tests such 
as impact and tension, and cycle and ﬁnish tests.
Be sure to check each item delivered against the approved speciﬁcations and submittals for compli-
ance of quality. Imagine getting a grade 3 product when specifying a grade 1 due to poor substitution 
practices.
Materials
Latchsets and locksets are manufactured from many parts that can be made of various materials, 
depending on the manufacturer’s standards. Some materials used to manufacture latchsets, locksets, 
and their components include iron, copper, steel, stainless steel, brass, bronze, and zinc.

Sustainability
Dummy trim can possibly help contribute to sustainability with its pre- and postconsumer recycled content, 
contributing to the overall material in the building. Using a factory ﬁnish and or not painting or coating 
the dummy trim on site can also help contribute to obtaining credits toward building a green structure.
TYPES
Bored
Also known as cylindrical, single-bored dummy trim is typically not bored into the door but is installed 
onto a mounting plate that is attached to the face of the door. With that said, there are some manu-
facturers that require additional cutouts for reinforcement and pair dummy trim might connect with 
a back-to-back installation through the door. Bored dummy trim has a limited choice of lever designs; 
there are typically three or four from which to choose.
Gate
A gate lock or latch is a small surface-mounted rim lockset or latchset that is typically used to keep a 
door opening in a gate from swinging freely.
Mortise
Mortise dummy trim is typically not mortised into the door but is installed onto a mounting plate that 
is attached to the face of the door. With that said, there are some manufacturers that require additional 
cutouts for reinforcement and pair dummy trim might connect with a back-to-back installation through 
the door. Mortise dummy trim comes in many choices of lever designs, typically the same choices as the 
locking devices from the same series.
Tubular
Tubular dummy trim is typically not bored into the door but is installed onto a mounting plate that is 
attached to the face of the door. There are some manufacturers, however, that require additional cut-
outs for reinforcement and pair dummy trim might connect with a back-to-back installation through 
the door. Tubular dummy trim has a varied number of choices of lever designs—anywhere from just a 
few to several dozen depending on the manufacturer.
OPTIONS
Single
Dummy trim is available in single quantities for one side of the door installation. They are typically 
surface-mounted or can be reinforced inside of the door, depending on the door and hardware manu-
facturer’s recommendations.
Double
Dummy trim is available in double or pair quantities for both sides of the door installation. Depending 
on the manufacturer and type, they can be surface-mounted or mounted back to back, where they are 
connected to each other through the door, but still do not rotate or operate any other device or mechanism.
Decorative
Trim can also be an aesthetic component of the panic or ﬁre exit hardware outside trim. Some 
manufacturers oﬀer many lever handle design choices for all hardware types; some have suites that 
www.it-ebooks.info

112    |   SECURING DEVICES
allow consistent design on all hardware types, including panic and ﬁre exit hardware. Other matching 
lever types include mortise locksets, electronic access control locksets, and tubular passage, privacy, 
and dummy trim. There are also suites of hardware available that include lever handles for locksets, 
pull handles for glass and sliding doors, drawer pulls, door stops, coat hooks, and hinges. With coor-
dination, this would give the entire opening, interior, and building a consistent door opening design.
Escutcheon
An escutcheon is a backplate to the trim and, if one is used, it is a cylinder on the outside and thumb-
turn on the inside of the door. Escutcheons can be rectangular, oval, or custom in shape and be installed 
ﬂush, with a pattern or with framed edges.
Heavy Duty
Heavy-duty dummy trim is available for very frequently used door openings that might need to with-
stand high abuse. This trim is typically very strong and will outlast conventional-duty trim.
Knob
Knob trim is available for the outside operation of panic and ﬁre exit hardware. Knobs are typically 
round, although some custom knobs might be more oval or square. In 1992, lever handles became the 
new standard, as knobs no longer met the requirements of or complied with ADA.
Lever
Lever trim is available for dummy trim hardware. Typically elongated and horizontal across the door 
face at the door lock edge, lever handles have many designs and choices in aesthetic. Some manufac-
turers oﬀer lever trim designs for their dummy trim, consistent with panic and ﬁre exit hardware, and 
locking device oﬀerings such as mortise locksets or electronic access control locking hardware.

Lever handle trim became the new standard in 1992, in order to meet the new ADA standard and 
requirements. These and current requirements roughly state that doorways cannot be operated by a 
twisting or pinching motion, which is how a doorknob is conventionally operated. With a lever trim, you 
can lean on the lever and still retract the latch to operate the door.
Certain codes require that the lever have a return to the door at its end, with no more than ½-inch 
clearance between the end of the return and the door face. This is to prevent anything from getting 
caught behind the lever handle, such as clothing or a ﬁre hose prior to being ﬁlled with water.
Pull
Pull trim is a good option for panic and ﬁre exit hardware for heavy-duty applications, but it is more 
commonly used as a simple pull handle, which, in essence, is a dummy trim.
Rigid
Rigid trim is trim that does not move and is always ﬁxed in one position. Examples of rigid trim are pull 
handles and dummy trim.
Rosette
A rosette is a backplate to the trim on both the outside and inside of the door. Rosettes can be 
rectangular, round, oval, or custom in shape as well as ﬂush, with pattern, or having framed edges.
QUANTITIES
One type of dummy trim can be installed as a single-sided application or two types can be installed as 
a double or back-to-back application.
FIGURE 2.39 Dummy Trim Pull
(Source: Courtesy of Rockwood® Manufacturing Company)
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    115
APPLICATIONS
Dummy trim can be installed for aesthetics or function. A single aesthetic can be used as a pull for a 
closet with a roller latch as the securing method. Dummy trim can also be installed as a double or back-
to-back installation on the inactive leaf of a pair of doors for either aesthetics or, as on a functioning 
swinging door, as a pull on both sides of the door.
INSTALLATION
Dummy trim can be installed as either a single aesthetic piece or as a pair. Single dummy trim is 
typically surface-mounted on a mounting plate on the face of a door. Double dummy trim can be 
surface-mounted on both sides of the same door or the two pieces can be connected to each other 
and placed back-to-back through the door.
Dummy trim is not allowed by life safety egress codes on the inactive leaf of a pair of doors in the path 
of egress. The reason for having no trim is so that the person trying to exit the space does not have to 
think about or choose the correct handle. If someone is in a panic trying to exit a space and ﬁxates on 
the inactive dummy handle, he or she could waste time trying to turn a handle that will never move or 
get the door to open. By having only one operable choice in the path of egress the chances of getting 
through the opening are greater.
If dummy trim is being installed on a stile and rail door, always conﬁrm the lock stile dimension to 
ensure that there is enough room to install the dummy trim.
Fasteners
Sometimes installed through the door or with a side preparation for a more secure installation, dummy 
trim is typically positioned on a mounting plate that is installed onto the door with screw fasteners. 
Fasteners are available for wood or metal door and frame material. Phillips and ﬂat-head screws are 
available depending on the manufacturer’s standard, and special screw heads are available as an 
option, including security, security stud, and torx.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.

116    |   SECURING DEVICES
Locations
Although dummy trim can act as a door pull, it should be installed at locations as recommended by 
industry standards and codes, which are typically measured from the ﬁnished ﬂoor. Depending on the 
door and frame type, whether considered standard or custom metal, wood, or aluminum, standards 
recommend starting the ﬁrst hinge from the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
STANDARD STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Standard steel doors and frames are recommended to have the dummy trim installed at 40 5/16 inches, 
which coincides with the centerline of the strike on the frame.
CUSTOM STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Custom steel doors and frames are recommended to have the centerline of the dummy trim installed 
at 38 inches.
FLUSH WOOD DOORS AND FRAMES
Flush wood doors are recommended to have the dummy trim installed at 40 5/16 inches, which 
coincides with the centerline of the strike on the frame.
Preparations
Single dummy trim preparations are typically completed in the ﬁeld by the installer, including the 
drilling and tapping of screw holes, whereas double or back-to-back dummy trim preparations might 
be completed at the factory.
ELECTRIC STRIKES
Also Known As: Release Device
DESCRIPTION
Electric strikes can be used to regulate who passes through door openings and access points. Unlike an 
electriﬁed lockset or exit device that still needs to have the latch retracted once unlocked electronically, 
an electric strike keeper, where the latch of the lockset is held, releases and allows the latch to pull away 
from the strike rather than being retracted from it.
Although they are used often, it is recommended that electric strikes not be your ﬁrst choice for security 
unless this is necessary in a retroﬁt environment, as they are not as robust as electromechanical locking 
devices. Electric strikes are ideal for traﬃc control or for keeping audit trail records of an opening.
PROPERTIES
Electric strikes have a keeper, which is where the latch of the locking device engages. The strike keeper 
releases the latch when operated so that the locking device, including the latch, can be pulled out of 
the strike keeper without rotating the lever of the locking device itself.
Finishes
Electric strikes are typically available in a limited number of the basic ﬁnishes, depending on the manu-
facturer. The ﬁnish of the device is typically a cover plate that covers the exposed edge of the electric 
strike.
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    117
Grades
Electric strikes are tested and graded with levels of 1, 2, and 3 by ANSI/BHMA with 1 being the highest 
and best performing. The tests for grade include cycle and strength tests.
Materials
Electric strikes are typically manufactured from metal, plastic, and wire materials that operate inside of 
a metal or plastic housing.
TYPES
Rim
Rim electric strikes are surface-mounted on the stop of the frame strike jamb where the mechanical 
rim latch strike would be.
Semi-Rim
Semi-rim electric strikes are mortised into the frame strike jamb where the mechanical rim latch 
strike would be. The keeper is extended out to accommodate the location of the rim latch on the exit 
hardware device.
Mortise
Mortise electric strikes are mortised into the jamb of the frame strike, where the mechanical latch strike 
would be, aligned so that the keeper of the strike accepts the latch of the locking device.

The electric strikes for use with locksets and mortise exit hardware devices require a mortise latch 
keeper, which is typically mortised into the frame strike jamb where the mechanical mortised latch 
strike would be. This strike, depending on the manufacturer, might have the option to accept the 
deadbolt in addition to the latchbolt of the locking device.

DOUBLE
Double vertical rod exit device electric strikes are mounted on the jamb of the head where the pair of 
mechanical vertical rod latch strikes would be.
OPTIONS
Connectors
Electronic hardware has historically been connected by twisting wires together, but now there are plas-
tic connectors that are prewired by the manufacturer so that their hardware will connect easily by plug-
ging the devices together. Such connections are available on hinges that connect to door harnesses 
that carry power across the door to the locking device.
Ampere (Amp)
An ampere (amp) is a measure of the amount of electric charge passing a point in an electric circuit. In 
other words, it is the speed that the electricity travels through a device, wire, and system.
Current
Current requirements diﬀer by manufacturer and device. Available as alternating or direct current, 
electrical devices must be coordinated correctly in order to have proper operation and function.
ALTERNATING CURRENT AC
Alternating current (AC) is the typical power used in homes and standard outlets. The current is sent 
to and from the device, in alternating directions. If you ever noticed a buzzing sound at a door with an 
electric strike when power is sent to it, you are likely hearing the alternating current running through the 
device.
DIRECT CURRENT DC
Direct current (DC) can eliminate the buzzing sound and is typically a one-way current similar to that of 
a battery and does not create the buzzing sound.
Extended Lip
Depending on the manufacturer, electric strikes are available with the option to extend the lip of 
the strike. This would be necessary if the door were not ﬂush with the edge of the door and inset 
into a reveal in the frame. This would give the latch a plate to rub against as it swings in and out of 
the reveal in the frame instead of possibly scraping against the frame paint or ﬁnish and possibly 
scratching it.

Open Back
Open-back strikes are used with pairs of doors, allowing what would normally be the inactive leaf, if 
ﬂushbolts were used, to be independent of the active leaf and able to operate on its own. An example 
is a pair of doors with the active door having a mortise lock exit device while the inactive door has a 
vertical rod device allowing egress only. In this case, the inactive door could operate from the egress 
side independent of the active door, and the open-back strike would allow the active door mortise lock 
device to latch without the use of a coordinator.
Fail Safe
Fail-safe strikes are available to tie into a ﬁre alarm system. This trim only locks when power is applied to 
the opening and unlocks when power is released. This function uses power all of the time but is neces-
sary to meet the codes in certain situations, if electriﬁcation is necessary at the opening. The devices 
are manufactured diﬀerently, depending on the manufacturer and options, and can be operated by 
solenoid or a motorized mechanism, which would retract and throw the bolt accordingly, or simply 
allow the lever or knob to be rotated to retract the latch manually.
Fail Secure
Fail-secure strikes are available for locking and unlocking a device. This trim only unlocks when power 
is applied to the opening and locks when power is released. This device uses less power than a fail-safe 
device, as the power is only used when necessary to open the device. The devices are manufactured 
diﬀerently, depending on the manufacturer and options, and can be operated by solenoid or a motor-
ized mechanism, which would retract and throw the bolt accordingly, or simply allow the lever or knob 
to be rotated to retract the latch manually.

Voltage
Voltage requirements diﬀer by manufacturer and device. Available with various voltages such as 12 VAC 
or DC, and 24 VAC or DC, devices must be coordinated correctly in order to have proper operation and 
function. With that said, there are manufacturers that have devices that operate with multiple voltages, 
so one would not need to coordinate them when purchasing the devices, but you should do so when 
installing them, to be certain there are no errors and the devices are not ruined and left unusable.
QUANTITIES
Electric strikes are installed in single units with one strike per latch.
APPLICATIONS
Surface-Mounted
Electric strikes for use with rim exit hardware devices require a rim latch keeper, which is typically 
surface-mounted on the stop of the frame strike jamb where the mechanical rim latch strike would be.
Electric strikes for use with vertical rod exit devices are mounted on the jamb of the head where the 
mechanical vertical rod latch strike would be.
Mortised
Electric strikes for use with locksets and mortise exit hardware devices require a mortise latch keeper, which 
is typically mortised into the frame strike jamb where the mechanical mortised latch strike would be.
INSTALLATION
An electric strike is typically installed on the frame or on the inactive leaf of a pair of doors, and the 
latchbolt and/or deadbolt of the locking device is secured in the keeper of the strike. The latchbolt of 
the locking device can be pushed through the keeper of the electric strike once the strike is released, 
without requiring the latchbolt to be retracted by the handle or knob as with mechanical strikes.
If an electric strike is being installed on a stile and rail door, always conﬁrm the lock stile dimension to 
ensure that there is enough room to install the strike.
Fasteners
Electric strikes are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood or metal door 
and frame material installation. Phillips and ﬂat-head screws are available, depending on the manufac-
turer’s standard, and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, security stud, 
and torx.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.
Locations
Electric strikes should be installed at locations as recommended by industry standards and codes, 
which are typically measured from the ﬁnished ﬂoor. Depending on the door and frame type, whether 
it is considered standard or custom metal, wood, or aluminum, standards recommend starting the ﬁrst 
hinge as measured from the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
STANDARD STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Standard steel doors and frames are recommended to have the centerline of the strike on the frame 
installed at 40 5/16 inches.
www.it-ebooks.info

122    |   SECURING DEVICES
CUSTOM STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Custom steel doors and frames are recommended to have the centerline of the strike on the frame 
installed at 38 inches.
FLUSH WOOD DOORS AND FRAMES
Flush wood doors are recommended to have the strike on the frame installed at 40 5/16 inches.
Preparations
Electric strike preparations are typically machined at the factory, including the drilling and tapping of 
screw holes. With metal doors and frames, the preparation is typically a cutout in the location where an 
electric strike will be installed.
PANIC AND FIRE EXIT HARDWARE
Also Known As: Crash Bars, Exit Hardware, Panic Hardware
DESCRIPTION
Although similar in function and appearance, there is a major diﬀerence between panic hardware and 
a ﬁre exit device, whether or not they are speciﬁed and installed on a ﬁre rated door.
Panic hardware is typically used for life safety, egress, and occupancy requirements. While ﬁre exit 
devices are typically used for the same reasons, in addition the door opening is ﬁre rated. These devices 
were tested in accordance with ﬁre rating requirements and will bear the ﬁre rated symbol to verify it 
they are compliant.
Another diﬀerence between the devices is that panic hardware can be “dogged” in the open position 
and a ﬁre exit device cannot be. As mentioned earlier, a ﬁre rated door must secure itself into the door 
frame on its own when a ﬁre occurs, and a ﬁre rated dogged device would require the assistance of 
someone to make that happen.
With that said, there is an option available from some manufacturers to electrically dog a device, where 
the bolts are retracted and held electronically, typically by a solenoid, which is magnetic. This device 
is wired, or tied, into the ﬁre alarm system, and when the ﬁre alarm is engaged, the power is cut, the 
solenoid releases, the bolts retract, and the door is engaged and secured into the frame as required at 
the time of the ﬁre.
PROPERTIES
Panic and ﬁre exit hardware can be manufactured with various conﬁgurations, aesthetics, functions, 
and options.
Actuating Bar
There are three main types of panic and ﬁre exit hardware actuating bars, which are depressed to 
retract the latches of the device, allowing egress. As you can see from Figure 2.48, the actuating bars 
have very diﬀerent aesthetics and angles of projection from the face of the door.
There are some newer, simple, more aesthetically designed devices available that might meet egress 
standards and codes for panic, but not necessarily ﬁre exit requirements.
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    123
CROSSBAR
The crossbar actuator is the original panic and ﬁre exit hardware design, which looks like a tubular bar 
installed horizontally across the face of the door. The crossbar can be depressed fully to retract the 
latchbolts, allowing the door to be pushed open.
Although aesthetically pleasing, crossbars can present issues as some building occupants (or even 
staﬀ) will chain them together for security purposes. This is obviously not allowed by code, especially 
as the means of egress.
TOUCHPAD
The touchpad actuator is the newer of the designs available and looks like a rectangular pad installed 
horizontally across the face of the door. At least half of the touchpad depresses (required by code) when 
pushed to retract the latchbolts, allowing the door to be pushed open.

124    |   SECURING DEVICES
INTEGRATED
Integrated actuators are similar to the touchpad design, rectangular in shape, except they are installed 
as part of the door, recessed in a preparation rather than being surface-mounted on the face. These 
devices are typically installed at the factory by the door manufacturer, hence the name “integrated.”
Chassis
The chassis is where the latchbolt is housed, and it is operated by the actuator. Depending on how the 
device is manufactured, the chassis can be engaged by the actuator from the side or face of the chassis.

SECURING DEVICES    |    125
The chassis is typically protected by a cover, which is usually in the same architectural ﬁnish as the rest 
of the device and door hardware speciﬁed.
End Cap
End caps are typically installed at the hinge side end of the exit device. They can be ﬂush with the end 
of the device or wrap around, depending on the manufacturer and the options oﬀered.
Finishes
Visible parts of an exit device are available in most architectural ﬁnishes, depending on the manufacturer 
and their availability.
Grade
Exit devices are available in diﬀerent grades, cited as grade 1, 2, and 3, with grade 1 being the highest-
quality grade. Testing is diﬀerent for interior and exterior openings. The following are a few of the 
interior tests and standards per ANSI/BHMA A156.3 American National Standard for Exit Devices, 2008.
CYCLE TEST
Cycle tests ensure the longevity of a device for a certain amount of cycles, during which the device is 
activated and the latchbolt is retracted.
GRADE 1
Grade 1 exit devices require 500,000 cycles of operation.
GRADE 2
Grade 2 exit devices require 250,000 cycles of operation.
GRADE 3
Grade 3 exit devices require 100,000 cycles of operation.

126    |   SECURING DEVICES
EXIT TEST
Standard
All grades require a 15-pound maximum depression force of the actuating bar.
Forced
All grades require a 50-pound maximum depression force of the actuation bar when 250 pounds of 
horizontal force is applied to the door, binding the latchbolt.
Materials
Exit device parts, including internal working parts, actuating bars, chassis, trim, rods, and strikes, can be 
manufactured from brass, bronze, stainless steel, or steel depending on the manufacturer and device.
Sizes
Exit devices are available in various sizes for door width and door height. The minimum width available 
for an exit device is 2 feet. The maximum width available for an exit device is 4 feet, and the actuating 
portion of the bar across the door must be at least half of the width of the door, while the maximum 
height for a vertical rod exit device is 10 feet.
There are very speciﬁc size and application requirements and compliances, so be certain to check with 
the local codes and standards, as well as the availability with the manufacturer.
Strikes
Strikes are the keeper for latches of panic and ﬁre exit hardware. Depending on the device and latch 
type, there are strikes available to suit each. They are typically furnished with the device along with 
fasteners and other required parts.
TYPES
Rim
Rim devices are the most secure, easiest to install, and least expensive of the types. They install fully on 
the inside of the opening, and the latch can be neither seen nor tampered with through the clearance 
on the door’s latch side.
NARROW
Narrow stile devices are available to suit narrow stile doors with less than 2 inches of stile dimension for 
the chassis to mount onto.
STANDARD
Standard stile exit devices are available to suit stiles 3 inches or wider for the chassis to mount onto.
Mortise
Although it has more parts, a bigger body inside the door, and costs more, the mortise lock is not as 
secure as a rim device. Unlike the rim device, one can see the latchbolt through the clearance at the 
latch side of the frame, tamper with it, and possibly damage it.
Vertical Rod
Few people ﬁnd surface-mounted vertical rod devices beautiful. In addition to taking away from the 
opening’s design, these hardware components can be a maintenance nightmare, and the latches will 
have to be adjusted regularly, depending on the frequency of use.

CONCEALED VERTICAL TOP AND BOTTOM RODS
Concealed vertical rods are similar to surface-mounted ones, except the rods are hidden inside of 
the door opening. This helps with the aesthetics, but like surface-mounted rods, this hardware can 
be a maintenance nightmare, even more so than the surface-mounted rods, because the adjustment 
typically cannot be completed while the door is hanging in the opening. The door will have to be

taken down from its hanging device; the latches will have to be adjusted regularly, depending on the 
frequency of use, and the door rehung accordingly.
Since the latch adjustments cannot be tested while the door is out of the opening, if they are not 
suﬃcient, the door will have to be taken down again and the cycle will continue until the adjustments 
are correct, which can waste a lot of resources and labor.

130    |   SECURING DEVICES
SURFACE TOP AND BOTTOM RODS
Surface vertical rod devices were originally oﬀered as top and bottom, with the rods extending from 
the cross- or touch bar at the center of the door, extending the entire height of the door opening, and 
latching into strikes at the head of the frame and ﬂoor.
SURFACE TOP ROD ONLY
Recent code changes do not allow anything to protrude oﬀ the face of the door for certain distances 
from the ﬁnished ﬂoor. These codes do not allow the bottom rod to be installed, and manufacturers 
have made modiﬁcations that have passed the tests to certain extents, allowing them to be installed 
on doors with the top rod only.

SECURING DEVICES    |    131
OPTIONS
Anti-Microbial Coating
Exit devices are available with an optional anti-microbial coating. The coating is a silver ion–based clear 
coating that helps stop the spread of bacteria. Although there are silver ions, they are not visible to the 
eye and a brass or bronze ﬁnish shows its true color through the coating. Silver has been used through-
out history to help reduce the spread of bacteria and infection; why not put it on doors and hardware 
that is touched over and over again by numerous diﬀerent people in a day?
Auxiliary Control
An auxiliary control is an option to lock and unlock the door from the outside, or pull side of the door, 
with a key and thumb turn where there are no lever handles or pulls but access might be required or 
desired. The cylinder unlocks the thumb turn and allows the rotation of the thumb turn, which retracts 
the latches of the exit device. This type of device might be questioned for ADA compliance.
Connectors
Electronic hardware has historically been connected by twisting together wires, but now there are plas-
tic connectors that are prewired by the manufacturer so that the hardware, at minimum, will connect 
easily by just plugging the devices together. Such connections would be available on hinges that con-
nect to door harnesses that carry power across the door to the locking device.
Cylinders
Cylinders are used on the exterior of exit devices to operate the trim. They can also be used to operate 
additional components of the device such as an alarm or the dogging feature if available. See Cylinders 
for Locking Devices in this chapter.
Dogging
Dogging a device means the device is operated to the open or unlocked position where all of the bolts 
are retracted and locked in that position.

FIGURE 2.70 Cylinder Dogging Exit Device

www.it-ebooks.info

132    |   SECURING DEVICES
The locking can be speciﬁed to either use a keyed cylinder or hex or Allen wrench key. Obviously, the 
keyed cylinder is the more controlled type of function so that only those who have access to the key can 
perform the function; otherwise, anyone with the right size Allen wrench can do the same.
Why would we want to dog open a device? Let’s use a school as an example. When a typical school is 
opened for the day, if not dogged in the open position, the exit hardware would cycle over and over 
each time a student, teacher, or personnel opened the door and went through the opening, putting 
excess use on the device and shortening its life.
If the device is dogged in the open position in the morning by those responsible, the device acts as a 
push/pull device, and the use of the latches and springs during operation of the device is limited, saving 
it from unnecessary wear and tear, extending its life.
Consider the electronic dogging we discussed earlier; with the ﬂip of a switch from a central location, 
we would save the time of a person or persons, who would otherwise have to go around the school 
perimeter to manually dog and undog these devices at the start and end of each day, not to mention 
possibly saving lives in an emergency lockdown situation.
Dummy Rail
A dummy rail is used for decorative purposes only and does not activate any latch or device. Be aware of 
egress code requirements, which might prohibit the use of a dummy bar on the egress side of an opening.
ACTIVE
Active dummy rails have an actuating bar that is not connected to anything and does not operate other 
than depressing and retracting from the housing.
INACTIVE
Inactive dummy rails do not have an actuating bar or any moving parts.
Electrical
Exit hardware is available with electrical options. These options can be used for a multitude of pur-
poses, including having to tie into a ﬁre alarm system so that it opens when there is an emergency and 
a ﬁreﬁghter can gain access without having to break through the door opening.
FIGURE 2.71 Hex Key for Dogging
(Source: Courtesy of SARGENT® Manufacturing Company)
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    133
Another reason for having an electrical function would be to tie into an alarm/security, or access control 
system. These systems would have the ability to monitor the latching and locking of the opening, and 
would signal the security station if they were not functioning as required. Access control would simply 
mean that one would be able to gain access through the opening by presenting proper electronic cre-
dentials to the opening, which would be conﬁrmed by the system, allowing or denying access.
ALARM
An alarm option in an exit device is typically used to alarm a door that is not intended to be operated 
except in an emergency. The alarm is installed into the push rail, and when the actuator is depressed on the 
exit hardware, it engages an alarm, which can be a local alarm or remote to a central monitoring location.
FIGURE 2.72 Alarmed Exit Device
(Source: Courtesy of SARGENT® Manufacturing Company)
BATTERY
Some devices or components of a device, such as electronic trim, might operate on batteries if there is 
no hard-wired power source available to power the locking device or trim. Battery life on these types of 
devices has been optimized and gets better with new innovations. Some trim can last up to a year with 
indicator lights and or sounds that give you months of warning that the battery needs to be changed.
DELAYED EGRESS
Delayed egress devices are typically used to alarm a door similar to an alarm option, with the added 
feature of delaying the egress, or exit through the opening. There are certain codes and authorities 
having jurisdiction that do not allow delayed egress devices due to their interpretation of the device as 
being more harmful than helpful to people who use the opening.
If the device is allowed by code, there are typically requirements such as a maximum timed delay and 
notiﬁcation by signage indicating length of delay. When codes do not allow a delayed egress function, 
an alarm option is typically used instead.
DOGGING
Electric dogging is an option that allows dogging of the device by the use of an electrical force rather 
than a mechanical method. Electric dogging can be accomplished by either physically depressing each 
push pad so that it is held open electrically or by adding the option of electric latch retraction, which 
would allow retraction of the latch remotely so it could be electrically dogged by computer or switch.
HARDWIRED
Hard-wired devices have wires running directly into them from an outside power source. The outside 
power source can be a voltage source, such as 24 VAC, or a power over an Ethernet source through the 
computer cables that connect your network to the Internet.
www.it-ebooks.info

134    |   SECURING DEVICES
INTEGRATED WIEGAND
Panic and ﬁre exit device trim is available with an integrated Wiegand card reader device. This reader 
is a proximity type, where the card is presented within proximity of the reader and is read by radio 
frequency rather than having to make the card physically contact the surface of the reader.
INTELLIGENCE
Exit devices can be equipped with intelligence, similar to that of your automobile. The newer the 
automobile, the more intelligent they become with what is called CAN bus technology. Have you 
ever noticed that, when you turn the key or push the ignition button, the lights flash and the horn 
beeps almost talking to each other? That is CAN bus—CAN, short for controller area network, 
is a standard that allows devices to communicate with each other without a host computer or 
software.
LATCHBOLT MONITORING
Latchbolt monitoring is an electriﬁed option that allows the monitoring of the latchbolt position, 
whether extended or retracted. This allows the signaling of any devices that have not extended and 
secured into the strike so that this can be followed up with in person to rectify the situation.
LEVER MONITORING
Lever monitoring is an electriﬁed option that allows the monitoring of the lever handle position, 
whether rotated or in the rest position. This allows the signaling of any lever handle that is in the rotated 
position, indicating that the latchbolt is likely retracted and not secure in the strike.
LATCH RETRACTION
Electric latch retraction allows the remote electronic retraction and extension of the exit hardware 
latchbolt. The operation can be accomplished by computer, a switch, or credentials such as a card and 
reader. When the signal is initiated, the latch of the device is retracted so that the door can be pulled or 
pushed open without having to retract the push pad from the inside or rotate a lever from the outside 
of an exit hardware device.
POWER OVER ETHERNET
Devices that are powered over Ethernet are energized by the Ethernet cable that hard-wires the 
computers to their network and the Internet, instead of having a separate voltage power source. The 
advantages of this network is low power consumption and that the network and door monitors are 
always live and talking to the system, ready to alert one of any suspicious activity.
REQUEST TO EXIT SWITCH
Request to exit switches are an electriﬁed option available to shunt an  alarm during an authorized 
exit. If a door has a local or remote alarmed exit hardware device, door and frame signal switch, 
lever, or latchbolt monitoring switch, a request to exit switch sends a signal to the contact, alarm, 
or computer stating that the doorway is being accessed from the exit side and that no credentials 
are required. This shunts the alarm, allowing the person to go through without having to present 
electronic credentials.
TRIM
Electriﬁed trim is available on the outside of an exit device door so that a door can be accessed from the 
outside with the use of an electronic access control system. Typically rigid, when a switch such as a card 
reader authorizes the credentials presented to it, the trim unlocks and is able to be rotated to retract 
the latchbolt, pull the door forward, and gain entry to the space.

Fail Safe
Fail-safe door trim is available to tie into a ﬁre alarm system. This trim only locks when power is 
applied to the opening and unlocks when power is released. This function uses power all of the time 
but is necessary to meet the codes in certain situations if electriﬁcation is necessary at the opening. 
The devices are manufactured diﬀerently, depending on the manufacturer and options, and can be 
operated by solenoid or a motorized mechanism, which would retract and throw the bolt accordingly, 
or simply allow the lever or knob to be rotated to retract the latch manually.
www.it-ebooks.info

136    |   SECURING DEVICES
Fail Secure
Fail-secure door trim is available for locking and unlocking a device. This trim only unlocks when power 
is applied to the opening and locks when power is released. This device uses less power than fail safe 
trim, as the power is only used when necessary to open the device. The devices are manufactured dif-
ferently, depending on the manufacturer and options, and can be operated by solenoid or a motorized 
mechanism, which would retract and throw the bolt accordingly, or simply allow the lever or knob to 
be rotated to retract the latch manually.
WAYFINDING
Flashing LED lights, a directional green laser, and an audio alarm that states “Exit This Way” are some 
of the features of wayﬁnding. With sensors to detect and shunt the wayﬁnding features if the ﬁre is too 
hot on the other side of the door, these devices typically guide you to a nearby exit when the ﬁre alarm 
system is activated.
WIRELESS
In addition to the common household wireless ﬁdelity (WiFi) that we all know and use for our wireless 
Internet access with the use of a wireless router connected to the modem, there are other wireless 
technologies available and incorporated into many existing mechanics, including electronic door lock-
sets. Some of these low-power-consumption wireless technologies send wireless signals to local hubs 
separate from the 802.11 routers that we are used to in our homes.
WIRELESS FIDELITY
Devices that have WiFi technology are typically powered by battery. These devices communicate on 
the same 802.11 wireless networks that we use to transmit our Internet signal from the hard-wired 
modem into the air so that our computers and mobile devices can connect and use the signal to do 
various things—most commonly access the Internet. New devices that incorporate both the modem 
and router are available by some Internet access providers.
The WiFi sends and receives data from the computers and system. The advantages of this network is 
low power battery consumption and easy network installation and communication, especially for exist-
ing conditions where running hard wires is not eﬃcient or sometimes even possible due to wall and 
frame materials. Although the system is not live all of the time, the network and door monitors “wake 
up” and talk to the system whenever there is any suspicious activity.

Fire Rating
Fire exit hardware devices are tested to meet ﬁre standards and codes, allowing it to be installed and 
operated on ﬁe rated door openings. Panic hardware is not necessarily tested and rated to meet ﬁre 
standards and codes.
Functions
Depending on the manufacturer and reentry application, there are many functions available to operate 
the outside trim of panic and ﬁre exit hardware. Functions range from simple mechanical passage and 
keyed locking to more technical options such as electronic locking and monitoring functions.
There are some more commonly used functions such as passage, privacy oﬃce, classroom, and storage. 
Although these functions are used the majority of the time, depending on the manufacturer’s product

availability, there are many other specialty functions to choose from such as hotel, dormitory, and 
automatic deadbolt lock. Figure 2.76 is the chart as listed in ANSI/BHMA A156.13 American National 
Standard for Mortise Locksets and Latches Series 1000, 2005
Handing
As described in the Introduction, there are several ways to hand doors, frames, and hardware. Panic and 
exit hardware is always a reverse bevel handing, either left-hand reverse (LHR) or right-hand reverse 
(RHR). This is true because all handing is done from the secure or keyed side of the door and with panic 
and ﬁre exit hardware always on the push side of the door and free to exit; the secure side is always the 
pull side of the door. If you are dealing with a passage function and there is no real secure side of the 
door in the locking sense, hand the door logistically as if there were an outside and inside, where the 
inside would have any visible mounting hardware such as screw heads.

Latching
Latching is a function of the panic or exit device latchbolt, where it engages into the respective strike on 
the door frame. Depending on the device type, there are diﬀerent latching options available.
CENTER
Center latching is typical on a single door with a rim or mortise panic or ﬁre exit device. The latch is 
approximately in the center of the height of the opening at the latch edge of the door and, depending 
on the door type, anywhere from 38 inches to 40 5/16 inches above the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
CENTER AND TOP
Center and top latching is typical on one leaf of a pair of doors with concealed vertical rod panic or ﬁre exit 
devices. There cannot be a top and center latching device on both leaves of a pair of doors. The latches at 
the center would hit each other and create a conﬂict with no strike for either to latch into; one leaf would 
have to have a device with just top latching. The center latch is approximately in the center of the height 
of the opening at the latch edge of the door and, depending on the door type, is anywhere from 38 inches 
to 40 5/16 inches above the ﬁnished ﬂoor and the top latch is at the top corner or the latch edge of a door.
TOP
Top latching is typical on both leaves of a pair of doors with concealed or surface-mounted vertical rod 
panic or ﬁre exit devices. The top latch is at the top corner or the latch edge of a door.
TOP AND BOTTOM
Top and bottom latching is typical on both leaves of a pair of doors with concealed vertical rod panic or 
ﬁre exit devices. The latches are at the top and bottom corners of the latch edge of a door.
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    139
Although surface-mounted top and bottom vertical rod devices are available, accessibility codes and 
standards do not allow their use. The code roughly states that no projections are allowed oﬀ of the 
lower face of the door at certain heights, depending on the code or standard.
TOP, CENTER, AND BOTTOM
Top, center, and bottom latching is typical on one leaf of a pair of doors or a single door, possibly rated 
for hurricanes or tornados, with concealed vertical rod panic or ﬁre exit devices. There cannot be center 
latching devices on both leaves of a pair of doors as the latches at the center would hit each other and 
create a conﬂict with no strike for either to latch into; one leaf would have to have a device with just top 
and or top and bottom latching.
The center latch is approximately in the center of the height of the opening at the latch edge of the 
door, and, depending on the door type, is anywhere from 38 inches to 40 5/16 inches above the ﬁn-
ished ﬂoor and the top latch is at the top corner or the latch edge of a door.
Although surface-mounted center, top, and bottom vertical rod devices are available, accessibility 
codes and standards do not allow their use. The code roughly states that no projections are allowed oﬀ 
the lower face of the door at certain heights, depending on the code or standard.
Luminous
Although using luminous materials was minimal and voluntary several years ago, there are some 
manufacturers that have fabricated these materials into their devices and are now prepared to make 
them standard as they become requirements. Those using devices without the luminous option would 
have to apply the luminous materials to the device—either as a sticker or paint—both of which are 
insubstantial and unreliable materials for the application.
Codes such as the International Building Code (IBC) are becoming more detailed with the requirements 
for luminous materials on panic and ﬁre exit hardware on certain openings. Section 1024 of the IBC 
states, “Where a panic bar is installed, such material shall be no less than 1 inch (25 mm) wide for the 
entire length of the actuating bar or touchpad.”
ELECTRO
Electro-luminous material is a high-intensity light source that emits through ﬁre and smoke. This light 
source requires power and would have to be tied into a backup generator source to operate. Although 
it is not part of the codes or standards that the luminous material be electro, there are manufacturers 
that have this type of panic and ﬁre exit device available.

PHOTO
Photo-luminous material is a glow-in-the-dark light source that emits through ﬁre and smoke. This light 
source does not require power other than a separate light source shining on it to keep it charged. The 
codes and standards are typically met with this type of luminous material and there are manufacturers 
that have this type of panic and ﬁre exit device available.

Narrow Stile
Narrow stile panic and ﬁre exit devices are basically the same as standard stile panic and ﬁre exit devices, 
except the chassis at the latch edge of the door has a narrower proﬁle. This would be installed on doors 
that have a narrow stile, where the chassis of a standard device will not ﬁt.
Security Shim Kit
When installed on full glass stile and rail doors, conventional panic and ﬁre exit hardware creates a void 
between the back of the device and the glass. This is an unsafe situation where something like an article 
of clothing could get caught while in the path of egress. A shim kit ﬁlls the void and creates a solid con-

SECURING DEVICES    |    141
tact to the glass with no place for something to get caught, which might slow or prevent someone from 
making their egress through the door opening most eﬃciently.
Touch Sense Bar
A touch sense bar is a dummy rail of sorts, except it is a switch that operates with the heat from your 
hands. Nothing typically is depressed, but the bar senses your hand’s touch and sends a signal to release 
the hardware, say, an electromagnet. Although the movement does nothing, there are manufacturers 
that oﬀer touch sense bars that do depress for a more realistic exit hardware feel while exiting the door.
Similar to the tube mechanical exit hardware, there are touch sense tube panic hardware devices 
available that release an electrical component such as an electromagnet, when the hand is sensed on 
the push rail.
Trim
Trim, also referred to as knobs, lever handles, or pulls, are available in many options and designs, 
depending on the manufacturer. The lever, knob, and pull designs are typically mounted on an 
escutcheon, which is a rectangular plate behind the lever or knob. This serves as a decorative plate, 
but conventionally also hides the fasteners behind the plate that are necessary to secure the device to 
the door.
ANTIVANDAL TRIM
Anti-vandal trim is an available option for lever handle trim that takes the pressure oﬀ of the lever 
handle. When an amount of pressure predetermined when the device is manufactured is applied to a 
rigid or locked lever handle, the lever drops and separates itself from the stem so that the spindle and 
internal parts of the exit device do not get damaged. The lever can be reset by lifting it back in place, 
where the lever will operate the latch as required.
Knob
Originally designed to grasp and rotate in order to retract a latch and open a door, knob trim was 
replaced for the most part by lever trim when the Americans with Disabilities Act was introduced in 
1992. Knobs require a tight grasp and twist motion to operate a door, which is strictly prohibited by 
most building, life safety, and disability codes and standards.

142    |   SECURING DEVICES
Lever
Designed in the shape of a lever handle, these devices have met some of the guidelines and give the 
opening a more conventional aesthetic than that of solely a healthcare facility. Some manufacturers 
have more options and have enhanced on the operation, guideline standards, and aesthetics of the 
device.
DECORATIVE
Trim can also be an aesthetic component of the panic or ﬁre exit hardware outside trim. Some 
manufacturers oﬀer many lever handle design choices for all hardware types; some have suites that 
allow consistent design on all hardware types including panic and ﬁre exit hardware. Other matching 
lever types include mortise locksets, electronic access control locksets, and tubular passage, privacy, 
and dummy trim. There are also suites of hardware available that include lever handles for locksets, pull 
handles for glass and sliding doors, drawer pulls, door stops, coat hooks, and hinges. With coordination, 
this would give the entire opening, interior, and building a consistent door opening design.
ELECTRIFIED
Electriﬁed trim is available on the outside of an exit device door so that a door can be accessed from 
the outside with the use of an electronic access control system. Typically rigid, when a switch such as 
FIGURE 2.84 Lever Handle

www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    143
a card reader authorizes the credentials presented to it, the trim unlocks and is able to be rotated to 
retract the latchbolt, allowing the door to be pulled open for entry to the space. Other available trim 
options include fail-safe or fail-secure function, voltage required, latch monitoring, lever monitoring, 
latch retraction, and request to exit. See Options/Electriﬁed in this section.
ESCUTCHEON
An escutcheon is a backplate to the trim, and if there is one, it is a cylinder on the outside and thumb-
turn on the inside of the door. Escutcheons can be rectangular, oval, or custom in shape as well as ﬂush, 
with pattern, or framed edges.
HAZARD OR TACTILE WARNING
Some standards and codes require that knobs and lever handles have a hazard warning signal for those 
who have vision impairment. Manufacturers oﬀer very limited choices to meet the hazard warning 
requirements, as follows:
Abrasive Coating
An abrasive coating is a nonsticky, black tar–like material with gravel-type material mixed into it. The 
material is a thick liquid that, when applied, and coats the entire knob or lever handle, except for the 
cylinder opening. When dry, the trim has a rough, black tar–like coating and ﬁnish.
Knurled
A knurled handle has patterns of scored on it and metal removed from the surface of the knob or lever 
handle. These “bumps” are typically on the back side of the knob or handle where the ﬁngers would 
feel the coarse, uneven surface and markings on the trim.
HEAVY DUTY
Heavy-duty trim is available for very frequently used door openings that might need to withstand high-
abuse situations. This trim is typically very strong and will outlast conventional-duty trim.

144    |   SECURING DEVICES
KNOB
Knob trim is available for the outside operation of panic and ﬁre exit hardware. Typical knobs are round, 
although some custom knobs might be more oval or square. In 1992, lever handles became the new 
standard as knobs no longer met the requirements or complied with the ADA.
LEVER
Lever trim is available for the outside operation of panic and ﬁre exit hardware. Typically elongated 
and placed horizontally across the door face at the door lock edge, lever handles have many designs 
and choices in aesthetics. Some manufacturers oﬀer lever trim designs for their panic and ﬁre exit 
hardware consistent with their other locking device oﬀerings, such as mortise locksets or electronic 
access control locking hardware.
Lever handle trim became the new standard in 1992 to meet the new ADA standard and requirements. 
These and current requirements roughly state that doorways cannot be operated by a twisting or 
pinching motion, which is how a conventional doorknob is operated. With a lever trim, you can lean on 
the lever and still retract the latch to operate the door.
Certain codes require that the lever have a return to the door at its end, with no more than ½-inch 
clearance between the end of the return and the door face. This is to prevent anything from getting 
caught behind the lever handle, such as clothing or a ﬁre hose prior to being ﬁlled with water.

SECURING DEVICES    |    145
PULL
Pull trim is a good option for panic and ﬁre exit hardware for heavy-duty applications. The pull is 
typically rigid, although some have thumb pieces and or cylinders to retract the latch, and are ideal for 
use where the device might be dogged for long periods of time.

146    |   SECURING DEVICES
RIGID
Rigid trim is trim that does not move and is always ﬁxed in one position. Examples of rigid trim are pull 
handles and dummy trim.
ROSETTE
Most exit devices are not available with a rosette option, which is a backplate to the outside trim due 
to the mounting plates and screws that are required to mount the exit device on the opposite side of 
the door. The escutcheon is more likely used, which will also be used to cover all mounting plates and 
screws.
Windstorm Ratings
Some manufacturers oﬀer Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and ICC/NSSA International 
Code Council/National Storm Shelter Association exit hardware device ratings to meet hurricane and 
tornado safety standards. These standards require the door, frame, and hardware to be heavy-duty and 
reinforced assembly tested as is, including the installation of the frame to the surrounding wall.
FIGURE 2.90 Windstorm Rated Surface Vertical Rod Exit Device and Latches
(Source: Courtesy of SARGENT® Manufacturing Company)
QUANTITIES
Panic and ﬁre exit hardware devices are applied in single quantities per door leaf. A single door would 
operate with one device, while a pair of doors might operate with two devices, although it might 
operate with one device along with another hardware type such as ﬂushbolts.
APPLICATIONS
Although most of the device applications have similar options, they are installed onto or into the door 
very diﬀerently.
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    147
Concealed
Concealed devices are installed inside of the door except for the operating components that need to be 
visible for operation. Most commonly known is the concealed vertical rod exit device, where the device 
and chassis are visible on the surface or face of the door, but the rods and latches that the rods operate 
are all concealed in the edge of the door.
Integrated door opening assembly panic or ﬁre exit hardware devices are also typically concealed 
inside of the door, including not only the rods and latches, but also the chassis.
Mortise
Mortise applications require the mortise lock, which is the locking device for mortise lock panic or ﬁre 
exit hardware, to be mortised into a pocket at the lock edge of the door. Depending on the lockset 
function, cylinder and or lever handle holes will need to be made on the face of the door for operation 
of the same.
Surface Mounted
Surface-mounted devices are typically one of two types, a rim device or surface-mounted vertical rod 
panic or ﬁre exit device. These devices are fully surface mounted on the face of the door except for any 
function holes necessary for cylinders, trim, and the latch strikes on the frame.
Tube
Some manufacturers oﬀer a tube design panic hardware. These devices are typically intended for 
full glass doors where there is no conventional frame for the strikes to latch into or door body for the 
hardware to be installed onto or into. These devices are aesthetically pleasing to many but might not 
have the functionality or ratings, both ﬁre and life safety, necessary for every application.
INSTALLATION
Panic and ﬁre exit hardware are typically installed either fully or partially on the face of the door. Some 
devices are partially concealed, and some operate fully concealed inside the door. They all latch in some 
way into the frame, either the side, top, both side and top, or in some cases the bottom alone or along 
with other sides of the frame. All of the latch combinations extend into a strike on the frame at the same 
location as the door.
If a panic or ﬁre exit device is being installed on a stile and rail door, always conﬁrm the lock stile 
dimension to ensure that the device will have enough room to be installed.
Fasteners
Panic and ﬁre exit hardware are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood 
or metal door and frame material installation. Phillips and ﬂat-head screws are available depending on 
the manufacturer’s standard, and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, 
security stud, and torx.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.
Locations
Panic and ﬁre exit hardware should be installed at locations as recommended by industry standards and 
codes, which are typically measured from the ﬁnished ﬂoor. Depending on the door and frame type, 
www.it-ebooks.info

148    |   SECURING DEVICES
whether considered standard or custom metal, wood or aluminum, standards recommend starting the 
ﬁrst hinge from the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
STANDARD STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Standard steel doors and frames are recommended to have the centerline of the strike for side-latching 
devices on the frame installed at 40 5/16 inches.
CUSTOM STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Custom steel doors and frames are recommended to have the centerline of the strike for side-latching 
devices on the frame installed at 38 inches.
FLUSH WOOD DOORS AND FRAMES
Flush wood doors are recommended to have the centerline of the strike for side-latching devices on the 
frame installed at 40 5/16 inches.
Preparations
Panic and ﬁre exit hardware device preparations are typically machined at the factory, including 
drilling and tapping screw holes. With metal doors and frames, the preparations are most typically 
reinforcements for the rail and chassis. Additional reinforcements as recommended by the manufacturer 
might include cutouts or reinforcements for surface or concealed mounted vertical rod exit devices, 
including the channels for the concealed rods.
REMOVABLE MULLIONS
Also Known As: Center Mullion, Door Mullion
DESCRIPTION
A mullion, when referring to a door frame, runs down the center of a pair of doors and can be 
manufactured as part of the frame so that each door can latch and operate independently. If both of 
the doors in a pair are required to be active for egress or any other purpose, this application is another 
option to using vertical rod exit devices on a pair of doors or a lockset with automatic ﬂushbolts.
Another option to manufacturing the mullion as part of a frame would be a hardware component 
known as a removable mullion.
PROPERTIES
A removable mullion is a single piece of material, which is typically metal in commercial construction, 
and is also typically the same height as the doors with which it will be installed.
Finishes
Removable mullion ﬁnishes are limited and typically available in light and dark anodized aluminum 
ﬁnishes or a prime coat of paint to be painted over in the ﬁeld with a ﬁnish paint or coating.
Materials
Removable mullions are typically available in aluminum, steel, and wood materials.
Shapes
Removable mullions are available in limited shapes, which are optimal for installing in between two 
doors so that they become independent of each other and can latch or lock into the mullion.
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    149
RECTANGULAR
Removable mullions are available in a rectangular shape with various dimensions, depending on the 
manufacturer.
FIGURE 2.91 Rectangular Removable Mullion
(Source: Courtesy of SARGENT® Manufacturing Company)
TEE SHAPE
Removable mullions are available in a tee shape, where the top or horizontal part of the tee is the 
stop against which the door stops, and the vertical portion is where the door latches or locks into the 
mullion.
FIGURE 2.92 Tee Shape Removable Mullion
(Source: Courtesy of SARGENT® Manufacturing Company)
Sizes
Removable mullions are available in standard door height sizes and custom sizes, depending on the 
manufacturer’s availability as well as industry standards for proper and consistent operation. There 
might be a premium cost for any custom size requests. Some manufacturers oﬀer a standard size of 96 
inches, which can be cut down in the ﬁeld to match the usable door height.
TYPES
Technically, there is only one type of removable mullion, with varying properties and options.
OPTIONS
Electric Transfer
Removable mullions are available with wires running through them so that electriﬁed hardware can be 
connected such as an electric strike. The wires run from the ceiling down the center of the mullion to 
the electric device on the frame in order to power the device.
Fire Rated
Some removable mullions have been ﬁre tested and comply with ﬁre rated codes and standards.
www.it-ebooks.info

150    |   SECURING DEVICES
Windstorm Rated
Some removable mullions have been tested and comply with severe wind conditions due to hurricanes 
and tornadoes. These mullions are typically furnished as part of a total door assembly, which includes 
doors, frames, and hardware that are tested as an assembly and not components.
Lockable
Keyed removable mullions are secured with a cylinder and key, this way only those authorized and 
with a physical key are able to unlock and remove the mullion. A storage closet or entrance to a room 
that might have furniture, equipment, or even art in an art gallery might need the doorway to become 
wider from time to time, and when not in use for that purpose, a locking mullion would help secure 
the opening.
FIGURE 2.93 Lockable Removable Mullion
(Source: Courtesy of Scott J. Tobias)
Nonlockable
Nonkeyed removable mullions are able to be removed by releasing a latch or might be secured in place 
with a fastener. This would be used when the door opening is not a secure space or an area where it is 
certain that the mullion would not be tampered with. Otherwise, the mullion could be removed from 
the opening very easily.
QUANTITIES
Removable mullions are installed on one per pair of doors in the center of the doors. This allows the 
devices, whether a lockset or exit device, to have something to lock into, while allowing the doors to 
remain independent of each other. This means that one door does not rely on the other for proper 
operation and, in theory, each door operates as a single unit within the pair opening.
APPLICATIONS
A removable mullion might be speciﬁed and installed for increased security as a preference to using 
vertical rod exit devices, or both. By providing the additional framing or hardware as removable, a 
diﬀerent type of locking hardware can be installed, such as a lockset or rim exit device, which is typically 
more secure (and aesthetically pleasing to some) than vertical rod exit devices.
Without the mullion in place, the latches of a conventional lockset or rim exit device would have nothing 
to secure into, and the latches of each door would conﬂict and hit each other, instead of engaging into 
a strike as necessary.
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    151
INSTALLATION
Removable mullions are installed in between a pair of doors to allow each door to operate and latch or 
lock independently of each other into the mullion.
Fasteners
Removable mullions are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood or metal 
installation. Phillips and ﬂat head screws are available, depending on the manufacturer’s standard, and 
special screw heads are available as an option, including security, security stud, and torx.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.
Various kits and brackets are available for various ﬁeld conditions, such as narrow transom brackets and 
shims for leveling the mullion when installing. Also available are mounting retainers, which help align 
and stand the mullions plumb and ﬂush as required.
Locations
Mullions are installed in between a pair of doors with fasteners at the top and bottom of the mullion 
to secure it in place.
Preparations
Removable mullions do not typically come prepared for hardware and is typically prepped in the ﬁeld 
by the installer.
The screw holes are prepared and if using a mounting kit, they are also prepared for the required 
fasteners.
TWO OR THREEPOINT LOCKSETS
Also Known As: Multipoint Locking Device
DESCRIPTION
Two- and three-point locksets provide multiple points of contact for bolts of a lockset in lieu of the 
conventional exit device. Conventional devices have a single point, such as a rim exit device, or two 
points, such as a concealed vertical rod exit device, which are most commonly used. These devices might 
more commonly be used in a more high-security area or an area tested for hurricane or tornado activity.
PROPERTIES
Two- or three-point locksets can be manufactured with various conﬁgurations, aesthetics, functions, 
and options.
Actuating Bar
Two- and three-point locksets might act as panic and ﬁre exit hardware and have similar actuating bars, 
which are depressed to retract the latches of the device, allowing egress.
CROSSBAR
The crossbar actuator is the original panic and ﬁre exit hardware design, which looks like a tubular bar 
installed horizontally across the face of the door. The crossbar can be depressed fully to retract the 
latchbolts, allowing the door to be pushed open.
www.it-ebooks.info

152    |   SECURING DEVICES
Although aesthetically pleasing, crossbars can present issues, as some building occupants (or even 
staﬀ) will chain them together for security purposes. This is obviously not allowed by code, especially 
in the means of egress.
TOUCHPAD
The touchpad actuator is the newer of the designs available and looks like a rectangular pad installed 
horizontally across the face of the door. At least half of the touchpad depresses (required by code) when 
pushed to retract the latchbolts, allowing the door to be pushed open. This design is more likely to be 
available over the crossbar for hurricane and tornado ratings.
Chassis
The chassis is where the latchbolt is housed, and it is operated by the actuator. Depending on how the 
device is manufactured, the chassis can be engaged by the actuator from its side or face. The chassis is 
usually protected by a cover, which is typically made with the same architectural ﬁnish as the rest of the 
device and door hardware speciﬁed.

(Source: Courtesy of SARGENT® Manufacturing Company)
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    153
Finishes
Visible parts of an exit device are available in most architectural ﬁnishes, depending on the manufacturer 
and their available selections.
Grade
Two- and three-point locksets are available in diﬀerent grades known as grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 
with grade 1 being the best and highest grade. Aside from the grades, other ratings such as windstorm 
for hurricane or no ratings for residential use might be available.
Materials
Two- and three-point lockset parts, including internal working parts, actuating bars, chassis, trim, 
rods, and strikes, can be manufactured from brass, bronze, stainless steel, or steel, depending on the 
manufacturer and device.
Strikes
Strikes are the keeper for latches of two- and three-point lockset hardware. Depending on the device 
and latch type, there are strikes available to suit each, which are typically furnished with the device 
along with fasteners and other required parts.
TYPES
Two Point
CONCEALED VERTICAL TOP AND BOTTOM RODS
Typically manufactured as a panic or ﬁre exit hardware device, two-point locksets are available as con-
cealed vertical rods with a push rail on the egress side with two latches, one at the side and one at the 
top, one at the top and bottom, or one at the side and one at the bottom. Concealed rods are similar 
to surface ones, except the rods are hidden inside of the door opening. This helps with the aesthetics 
for those who do not ﬁnd surface-mounted rods appealing. However, like surface-mounted rods, this 
hardware can be a maintenance nightmare because adjustment typically cannot be completed while 
the door is hanging in the opening. The door will have to be taken down from its hanging device; the 
latches will have to be adjusted regularly, depending on the frequency of use, and the door rehung 
accordingly.
FIGURE 2.96 Concealed Two-Point Lockset
(Source: Courtesy of SARGENT® Manufacturing Company)
www.it-ebooks.info

154    |   SECURING DEVICES
Since the latch adjustments cannot be tested while the door is out of the opening, if they are not 
suﬃcient, the door will have to be taken down again, and the cycle will continue until the adjustments 
are correct, which can waste a lot of resources and labor.
Two-point concealed vertical top and bottom rod devices are also available with lever handles on both 
sides of the door, operated by either a bored or a mortise lockset device installed on the latch side of 
the door.
RIM
Typically manufactured as a panic or ﬁre exit hardware device, rim two-point locksets are available with 
a push rail on the egress side with two latches. The rim latch is located at the latch side of the door and 
frame and the second latch is on either the top or bottom of the door, more likely at the top.
MORTISE
Typically manufactured as a panic or ﬁre exit hardware device, mortise two-point locksets are available 
with a push rail on the egress side with two latches. One type has the latch at the side of the door and 
frame on the latch side of the door and at either the top or bottom of the door, and the other type has 
one at the top and bottom with no latch on the side.
SURFACE TWO POINT
Typically manufactured as a panic or ﬁre exit hardware device, surface vertical rod two-point devices 
were originally oﬀered as top and bottom, with the rods extending from the cross- or touch bar at the 
center of the door, extending the entire height of the door opening, and latching into strikes at the 
head of the frame and ﬂoor.
Two-point surface vertical top and bottom rod devices are also available with lever handles on both 
sides of the door, operated by either a bored or a mortise lockset device installed on the latch side of 
the door.

Three Point
CONCEALED VERTICAL TOP AND BOTTOM RODS
Typically manufactured as a panic or ﬁre exit hardware device, three-point locksets are available as 
concealed vertical rods with a push rail on the egress side with three latches, one at the side, one at 
the top, and one at the bottom. Concealed rods are similar to surface ones, except the rods are hidden 
inside of the door opening. This helps with the aesthetics for those who do not ﬁnd surface-mounted 
rods appealing. However, like surface-mounted rods, this hardware can be a maintenance nightmare, 
because the adjustment typically cannot be completed while the door is hanging in the opening. The

door will have to be taken down from its hanging device; the latches will have to be adjusted regularly, 
depending on the frequency of use, and the door rehung accordingly.
Since the latch adjustments cannot be tested while the door is out of the opening, if they are not 
suﬃcient, the door will have to be taken down again, and the cycle will continue until the adjustments 
are correct, which can waste a lot of resources and labor.
Concealed vertical top and bottom rod devices are also available with lever handles on both sides of 
the door, operated by either a bored or mortise lockset device installed on the latch side of the door.
RIM
Typically manufactured as a panic or ﬁre exit hardware device, rim three-point locksets are available 
with a push rail on the egress side with three latches. The rim latch is located at the latch side of the door 
and frame and the second and third latches at the top and bottom of the door.
MORTISE
Typically manufactured as a panic or ﬁre exit hardware device, mortise three-point locksets are available 
with a push rail on the egress side with three latches. One type has the latch at the side of the door and 
frame on the latch side of the door and at either the top or bottom of the door, and the other type has 
one at the top and bottom in addition to the mortise latch on the side.
SURFACE VERTICAL TOP AND BOTTOM RODS
Typically manufactured as a panic or ﬁre exit hardware device, surface vertical rod three-point locksets 
were originally oﬀered as top and bottom, with the rods extending from the cross or touch bar at the 
center of the door, extending the entire height of the door opening, and latching into strikes at the 
head of the frame and ﬂoor in addition to the side.
Surface vertical top and bottom rod devices are also available with lever handles on both sides of the 
door, either operated by a bored or a mortise lockset device installed on the latch side of the door.
OPTIONS
Anti-Microbial Coating
Two- or three-point locksets are available with an optional anti-microbial coating. The coating is a silver 
ion–based clear coating that helps stop the spread of bacteria. Although there are silver ions, they are 
not visible to the eye and a brass or bronze ﬁnish shows its true color through the coating. Silver has 
been used throughout history to help reduce the spread of bacteria and infection: Why not put it on 
doors and hardware that are touched over and over again by numerous diﬀerent people in a day?
Auxiliary Control
An auxiliary control is an option to lock and unlock the door from the outside, or pull side of the door, 
with a key and thumb turn where there are no lever handles or pulls but access might be required or 
desired. The cylinder unlocks the thumb turn and allows the rotation of the thumb, which retracts the 
latches of the exit device. This type of device might be questioned for ADA compliance.
Connectors
Electronic hardware has historically been connected by twisting together wires, but now there are 
plastic connectors that are prewired by the manufacturer so that their hardware will connect easily 
by plugging the devices together. Such connections are available on hinges that connect to door 
harnesses that carry power across the door to the locking device.
www.it-ebooks.info

156    |   SECURING DEVICES
Cylinders
Cylinders are used to operate the outside trim of the device. Please see Cylinders for Locking Devices 
in this chapter.
Dogging
Dogging a device means the device is operated to the open or unlocked position, where all of the bolts 
are retracted and locked in that position.
The locking can be speciﬁed to use either a keyed cylinder or hex or Allen wrench key. Obviously, the 
keyed cylinder is the more controlled type of function so that only those who have access to the key can 
perform the function; otherwise, anyone with the right size Allen wrench can do the same.
Why would we want to dog open a device? Let’s use a school as an example. When a typical school is 
opened for the day, if not dogged in the open position, the two- or three-point lockset would cycle 
over and over each time a student, teacher, or other personnel opened the door and went through the 
opening, putting excess wear on the device and shortening its life cycle.
If the two- or three-point lockset is dogged in the open position in the morning by those 
responsible, the device acts as a push/pull device, and the latches, springs, and operation of the 
device are limited, saving the components from unnecessary wear and tear, extending the life cycle 
of the two- or three-point lockset.
Consider the electronic dogging we discussed earlier; with the ﬂip of a switch from a central location we 
would save the time of a person or persons who otherwise have to go around the school perimeter to 
manually dog and undog these devices at the start and end of each day, not to mention possibly saving 
lives in an emergency lockdown situation.
Electrical
Depending on the manufacturer, two- or three-point locksets are available with electrical options. 
These options can be used for a multitude of purposes, including tying into a ﬁre alarm system so that 
the lockset opens when there is an emergency and a ﬁreﬁghter can gain access without having to break 
through the door opening.
Another reason for having an electrical function is to tie into an alarm/security or access control system. 
These systems have the ability to monitor the latching and locking of the opening, and can signal the 
security station if this is not functioning as required. Access control simply means that one gains access 
through the opening by presenting proper electronic credentials to the opening, which are conﬁrmed 
by the system.
DOGGING
Electric dogging is an option that allows dogging of the device by the use of an electrical force rather 
than a mechanical one. Electric dogging can be accomplished by either physically depressing each 
push pad so that it is held open electrically or by adding the option of electric latch retraction, which 
allows retraction of the latch remotely to be electrically dogged by computer or a switch.
HARD WIRED
Hard-wired devices have wires running directly into them from an outside power source. The outside 
power source can be a voltage source, such as 24 VAC, or a power over Ethernet source through your 
computer cables that connect your network to the Internet.

INTEGRATED WIEGAND
Two- and three-point lockset trim is available with an integrated Wiegand card reader device. This 
reader is proximity-type, where the card is presented within proximity of the reader and is read by radio 
frequency rather than having to make the card physically contact the surface of the reader.
LATCHBOLT MONITORING
Latchbolt monitoring is an electriﬁed option that allows the monitoring of the latchbolt position, 
whether extended or retracted. This allows the signaling of any devices that have not extended and 
secured into the strike so that it can be followed up with in person to rectify the situation.
LEVER MONITORING
Lever monitoring is an electriﬁed option that allows the monitoring of the lever handle position, 
whether rotated or in the rest position. This allows the signaling of any lever handle that is in the rotated 
position, indicating that the latchbolt is likely retracted and not secure in the strike.
LATCH RETRACTION
Electric latch retraction allows the remote electronic retraction and extension of the hardware latchbolt. 
The operation can be accomplished by computer, a switch, or electronic credentials such as a card 
reader. When the signal is initiated, the latch of the device is retracted so that the door can be pulled or 
pushed open without having to retract the push pad from the inside or rotate a lever from the outside 
of a device.
REQUEST TO EXIT SWITCH
Request to exit switches are an electriﬁed option available to shunt an alarm during an authorized exit. 
If a door has a local or remote alarmed exit hardware device, door and frame signal switch, lever or 
latchbolt monitoring switch, a request to exit switch sends a signal to the contact, alarm, or computer 
stating that the doorway is being accessed from the exit side and that no credentials are required. This 
shunts the alarm, allowing the person to go through without having to present electronic credentials.
TRIM
Electriﬁed trim is available on the outside of an exit device door so that a door can be accessed from the 
outside with the use of an electronic access control system. Typically rigid, when a switch such as a card 
reader authorizes the credentials presented to it, the trim unlocks and is able to be rotated to retract 
the latchbolt, pull the door forward, and gain entry to the space.
Fail Safe
Fail-safe door trim is available to tie into a ﬁre alarm system. This trim only locks when power is 
applied to the opening and unlocks when power is released. This function uses power all of the time, 
but is necessary to meet the codes in certain situations if electriﬁcation is necessary at the opening. 
The devices are manufactured diﬀerently, depending on the manufacturer and options, and can be 
operated by solenoid or a motorized mechanism, which would retract and throw the bolt accordingly, 
or simply allow the lever or knob to be rotated to retract the latch manually.
Fail Secure
Fail-secure door trim is available for locking and unlocking a device. This trim only unlocks when power 
is applied to the opening and locks when power is released. This device uses less power than fail safe, 
as the power is only used when necessary to open the device. The devices are manufactured diﬀerently, 
depending on the manufacturer and options, and can be operated by solenoid or a motorized 
mechanism, which would retract and throw the bolt accordingly, or simply allow the lever or knob to 
be rotated to retract the latch manually.

Fire Rating
Fire two- and three-point lockset hardware devices are tested to meet ﬁre standards and codes, allowing 
them to be installed and operated on ﬁre rated door openings. Panic hardware is not necessarily tested 
and rated to meet ﬁre standards and codes.
Functions
Depending on the manufacturer and reentry application, there are many functions available to operate 
two- and three-point lockset hardware. Functions range from simple mechanical passage and keyed 
locking to more technical options such as electronic locking and monitoring functions.
There are some more commonly used functions such as passage, privacy oﬃce, classroom, and storage. 
Although these functions are used the majority of the time, depending on what is available from the 
manufacturer, there are many other specialty functions to choose from such as hotel, dormitory, and 
automatic deadbolt lock. Figure 2.98 is a chart as listed in ANSI/BHMA A156.13 American National 
Standard for Mortise Locksets and Latches Series 1000, 2005.
Handing
As described in the Introduction, there are several ways to hand doors, frames, and hardware. Two- and 
three-point lockset hardware can be any hand if lever handles are used on both sides, including left 
hand (LH), right hand (RH), left hand reverse (LHR) or right hand reverse (RHR). When the two- or three-
point lockset is a panic or ﬁre exit hardware device, the handing will always be a reverse bevel (LHR or 
RHR). This is true because all handing is done from the secure or keyed side of the door, and with panic 
and ﬁre exit hardware always on the push side of the door and free for exiting, the secure side is always 
the pull side of the door. If you are dealing with a passage function and there is no real secure side of 
the door in the locking sense, hand the door logistically as if there were an outside and inside, where 
the inside would have any visible mounting hardware such as screw heads.

Finishes, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.)
Hurricane Rating
Some manufacturers oﬀer Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and ICC/NSSA International 
Code Council/National Storm Shelter Association three-point lockset ratings to meet hurricane and 
tornado safety standards. These standards require the door, frame, and hardware to be heavy-duty and 
reinforced assembly tested as is, including the installation of the frame to the surrounding wall.

SECURING DEVICES    |    159
Latching
Latching is a function of the two- and three-point lockset latchbolt, where it engages into the respective 
strike on the door frame. Depending on the device type, there are diﬀerent latching options available, 
including top and bottom, top and side, or side and bottom.
CENTER AND BOTTOM
Center and bottom latching is not a typical application.
CENTER AND TOP
Center and top latching is typical on one leaf of a pair of doors with two-point locksets. There cannot 
be a top and center latching device on both leaves of a pair of doors. The latches at the center would 
hit each other and create a conﬂict with no strike for either to latch into; one leaf would have to have 
a device with just top latching. The center latch is approximately in the center of the height of the 
opening at the latch edge of the door.
TOP AND BOTTOM
Top and bottom latching is typical on both leaves of a pair of doors with two-point locksets. The latches 
are at the top and bottom corners of the latch edge of a door.
Although surface-mounted top and bottom vertical rod devices are available, accessibility codes and 
standards do not allow their use. The code roughly states that no projections are allowed oﬀ the lower 
face of the door at certain heights, depending on the code or standard.

www.it-ebooks.info

160    |   SECURING DEVICES
TOP, CENTER, AND BOTTOM
Top, center, and bottom latching is typical on one leaf of a pair of doors or a single door, possibly rated for 
hurricanes or tornados, with three-point locksets. There cannot be a center latching device on both leaves 
of a pair of doors as the latches at the center would hit each other and create a conﬂict with no strike for 
either to latch into; one leaf would have to have a device with just top and or top and bottom latching.
The center latch is approximately in the center of the height of the opening at the latch edge of the 
door and depending on the door type, anywhere from 38 inches to 40 5/16 inches above the ﬁnished 
ﬂoor and the top latch is at the top corner or the latch edge of a door.
Although surface-mounted center, top, and bottom two- and three-point locksets are available, 
accessibility codes and standards do not allow their use. The code roughly states that no projections 
are allowed oﬀ the lower face of the door at certain heights depending on the code or standard.
Luminous
Although the use of luminous materials was minimal and voluntary several years ago, there are some 
manufacturers that have manufactured these materials into their devices and are now prepared as they 
become requirements. Devices without this option will have to have the luminous materials applied 
to the device, as either a sticker or paint, neither of which are substantial and reliable materials for the 
application.
Codes such as the International Building Code (IBC) are becoming more detailed, with the requirement 
for luminous materials on panic and ﬁre exit hardware on certain openings, which would include any 
two- or three-point locksets tested for the same. Section 1024 of the IBC states, “Where a panic bar is 
installed, such material shall be no less than 1 inch (25 mm) wide for the entire length of the actuating 
bar or touchpad.”
ELECTRO
Electro-luminous material is a high-intensity light source that emits light through ﬁre and smoke. This 
light source requires power and would have to be tied into a backup generator to operate. Although 
it is not part of the codes or standards that the luminous material be electric, there are manufacturers 
that have this type of panic and ﬁre exit device available.
FIGURE 2.100 Electro-Luminous Exit Device
(Source: Courtesy of SARGENT® Manufacturing Company)
PHOTO
Photo-luminous material is a glow-in-the-dark light source that emits light through ﬁre and smoke. 
This light source does not require power other than a separate light source shining on it to keep it 
charged. The codes and standards are typically met with this type of luminous material, and there are 
manufacturers that have this type of panic and ﬁre exit device available.
Trim
Trim, also referred to as knobs, lever handles, or pulls, is available in many options and designs, 
depending on the manufacturer. The lever, knob, and pull designs are typically mounted on an 
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    161
escutcheon, which is a rectangular plate behind the lever or knob. This serves as a decorative plate, 
but conventionally also hides the fasteners behind the plate that are necessary to secure the device to 
the door.
ANTIVANDAL TRIM
Anti-vandal trim is an available option for lever handle trim that takes the pressure oﬀ the lever handle. 
When a certain amount of pressure, determined when manufactured, is applied to a rigid or locked 
lever handle, the lever drops and separates itself from the stem so that the spindle and internal parts of 
the exit device do not get damaged. The lever can be reset by lifting it back into place, where the lever 
will operate the latch as required.
DECORATIVE
Trim can also be an aesthetic component of the outside panic or ﬁre exit hardware. Some manufacturers 
oﬀer many lever handle design choices for all hardware types; some have suites that allow consistent 
design on all hardware types, including panic and ﬁre exit hardware. Other matching lever types 
include mortise locksets, electronic access control locksets, and tubular passage, privacy, and dummy 
trim. There are also suites of hardware available that include lever handles for locksets, pull handles for 
glass and sliding doors, drawer pulls, door stops, coat hooks, and hinges. With coordination, this would 
give the entire opening, interior, and building a consistent door-opening design.
ELECTRIFIED
Electriﬁed trim is available on the outside of an exit device door so that a door can be accessed from the 
outside with an electronic access control system. Typically rigid, when a switch such as a card reader 
authorizes the credentials presented to it, the trim unlocks and is able to be rotated to retract the 
latchbolt, pull the door forward, and gain entry to the space. Other available trim options include fail-
safe or fail-secure, voltage required, latch monitoring, lever monitoring, latch retraction, and request to 
exit functionality. See Options/Electriﬁed in this section.
ESCUTCHEON
An escutcheon is a backplate to the trim and if there is one, a cylinder on the outside and thumb turn 
on the inside of the door. Escutcheons can be rectangular, oval, or custom in shape as well as ﬂush, with 
pattern, or with framed edges.
HAZARD WARNING
Some standards and codes require that knobs and lever handles have a hazard warning signal for those 
who have a vision impairment. Manufacturers oﬀer very limited choices to meet the hazard warning 
requirements. These are as follows:
Abrasive Coating
An abrasive coating is a nonsticky, black tar–like material with gravel-type material mixed into it. The 
material is a thick liquid when applied and coats the entire knob or lever handle, except for the cylinder 
opening. When dry, the trim has a rough, black tar–like coating and ﬁnish.

SECURING DEVICES    |    163
Knurled
A knurled handle has patterns of scored and removed metal on the surface of the knob or lever handle. 
These “bumps” are typically on the back side of the knob or handle where the ﬁngers would feel the 
coarse, uneven surface and markings on the trim.
HEAVY DUTY
Heavy-duty trim is available for very frequently used door openings that might need to withstand high-
abuse situations. This trim is typically very strong and will outlast conventional-duty trim.
KNOB
Knob trim is available for the outside operation of panic and ﬁre exit hardware. Typical knobs are round, 
although some custom knobs might be more oval or square. In 1992, lever handles became the new 
standard, as knobs no longer met the requirements or complied with the ADA.
LEVER
Lever trim is available for the outside operation of panic and ﬁre exit hardware. Typically elongated and 
extending horizontally across the door face at the door lock edge, lever handles have many designs and 
choices in aesthetic. Some manufacturers oﬀer lever trim designs for their panic and ﬁre exit hardware 
consistent with that of their other locking device oﬀerings, such as mortise locksets or electronic access 
control locking hardware.
Lever handle trim became the new standard in 1992 to meet the new ADA standard and requirements. 
These and current requirements roughly state that doorways cannot be operated by a twisting or 
pinching motion, which is how a conventional doorknob is operated. With a lever trim, you can lean on 
the lever and still retract the latch to operate the door.
Certain codes require that the lever have a return to the door at its end, with no more than ½-inch 
clearance between the end of the return and the door face. This is to prevent anything from getting 
caught behind the lever handle, such as clothing or a ﬁre hose prior to being ﬁlled with water.
PULL
Pull trim is a good option for panic and ﬁre exit hardware for heavy-duty applications. The pull is 
typically rigid, although some have thumb pieces and or cylinders to retract the latch, and are ideal for 
use where the device might be dogged for long periods of time.
RIGID
Rigid trim is trim that does not move and is always ﬁxed in one position. Examples of rigid trim are pull 
handles and dummy trim.
ROSETTE
Most exit devices are not available with a rosette option, which is a backplate to the outside trim, due 
to the mounting plates and screws that are required to mount the exit device on the opposite side of 
the door. The escutcheon is more likely used and is also used to cover all mounting plates and screws.
QUANTITIES
Two- and three-point locksets are applied in single quantities per door leaf. A single door would 
operate with one device, while a pair of doors might operate with two devices, although they might 
just operate with one device along with another hardware type such as ﬂushbolts.
APPLICATIONS
Although most of the device applications have similar options, they are installed onto or into the door 
very diﬀerently.
www.it-ebooks.info

164    |   SECURING DEVICES
Concealed
Concealed devices are installed inside the door except for the operating components that must be 
visible for operation. Most commonly known is the concealed vertical rod exit device, where the device 
and chassis is visible on the surface or face of the door, but the rods and latches that the rods operate 
are all concealed in the edge of the door.
The integrated door opening assembly panic or ﬁre exit hardware devices are also typically concealed 
inside of the door, including not only the rods and latches, but also the chassis.
Mortise
Mortise applications require the mortise lock, which is the locking device for mortise lock panic or ﬁre 
exit hardware, to be mortised into a pocket at the lock edge of the door. Depending on the lockset 
function, cylinder and or lever handle holes will need to be made on the face of the door for operation 
of the same.
Surface Mounted
Surface-mounted devices are typically one of two types, a rim device or surface-mounted vertical rod 
panic or ﬁre exit device. These devices are fully surface-mounted on the face of the door except for any 
function holes necessary for cylinders, trim, and the latch strikes on the frame.
INSTALLATION
Two- or three-point locksets are typically installed either fully or partially on the face of the door. Some 
devices are partially concealed, and some operate fully concealed inside the door. They all latch in

SECURING DEVICES    |    165
some way into the frame, either side and top, top and bottom, or side, top, and bottom. All of the latch 
combinations extend into a strike on the frame at the same location as the door.
If a device is being installed on a stile and rail door, always conﬁrm the lock stile dimensions to ensure 
that the device will have enough room to be installed.
Fasteners
Two- or three-point locksets are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood 
or metal door and frame material installation. Phillips and ﬂat-head screws are available, depending 
on the manufacturer’s standard, and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, 
security stud, and torx.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.
Locations
Two- and three-point locksets should be installed at locations as recommended by industry standards 
and codes, which are typically measured from the ﬁnished ﬂoor. Depending on the door and frame 
type, whether considered standard or custom metal, wood, or aluminum, standards recommend 
starting the ﬁrst hinge from the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
STANDARD STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Standard steel doors and frames are recommended to have the centerline of the strike for side-latching 
devices on the frame installed at 40 5/16 inches.
CUSTOM STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Custom steel doors and frames are recommended to have the centerline of the strike for side-latching 
devices on the frame installed at 38 inches.
FLUSH WOOD DOORS AND FRAMES
Flush wood doors are recommended to have the centerline of the strike for side-latching devices on the 
frame installed at 40 5/16 inches.
Preparations
Two- and three-point lockset preparations are typically machined at the factory, including the 
drilling and tapping of screw holes. With metal doors and frames, the preparations are most 
typically reinforcements for the rail and chassis. Additional reinforcements, as recommended by the 
manufacturer, might include cutouts or reinforcements for surface- or concealed mounted vertical rod 
exit devices, including the channels for the concealed rods.
UNLATCH DEVICES
Also Known As: Release Device
DESCRIPTION
Unlatch devices can be used to regulate who passes through a door opening and all access points. 
Unlike an electric strike, where the latch of the lockset is held in a keeper that releases and allows the 
latch to pull away from the strike rather than being retracted from it, the unlatch device actually pushes 
the latch of the lockset out of the strike. When not in use, the unlatch device has a voice or standard 
keeper for the latch to rest in, but when activated, the void is ﬁlled by a moving bar used to push the 
latch out of the keeper in order to unlatch and open the door.
www.it-ebooks.info

166    |   SECURING DEVICES
Although they are used often and are more substantial than an electric strike, it is recommended that 
unlatch devices not be your ﬁrst choice of use for security unless necessary in a retroﬁt environment as 
they are not as robust as an electromechanical locking device. Unlatch devices are more secure than

SECURING DEVICES    |    167
electric strikes due to the one-piece construction, which allows the latch to rest inside of the strike like a 
conventional strike plate and not rest behind a keeper that is held in place by pins and springs. Unlatch 
devices are ideal for traﬃc control or for audit trail records of an opening.
PROPERTIES
Unlatch devices have a conventional strike plate keeper, which is where the latch of the locking device 
engages. The strike keeper is ﬁxed and, unlike an electric strike, pushes the latch of the locking device 
out rather than releasing it from the front when operated.
Finishes
Unlatch devices are typically available in a limited number of the basic ﬁnishes, depending on the 
manufacturer. The ﬁnish of the device is typically a cover plate that covers the exposed edge of the 
unlatch device.
Grades
Unlatch devices are tested and graded with levels of 1, 2, and 3 by ANSI/BHMA with grade 1 being the 
highest and best performing. The tests for the grade include cycle and strength tests.
Materials
Unlatch devices are typically manufactured from metal, plastic, and wire materials that operate inside 
of a metal or plastic housing.
TYPES
Bored
Bored unlatch devices are available to suit bored or cylindrical type locksets. The unlatch device is 
mortised into the strike frame jamb.
Mortise
Mortise unlatch devices are available to suit mortise locksets. The unlatch device is mortised into the 
strike frame jamb. Some mortise unlatch devices are able to accept not only the latchbolt of the locking 
device, but also the integrated deadbolt.
OPTIONS
Connectors
Electronic hardware has, historically, been connected by twisting together wires, but now there are 
plastic connectors that are prewired by the manufacturer so that their hardware will connect easily 
by plugging the devices together. Such connections are available on hinges that connect to door 
harnesses that carry power across the door to the locking device.
Ampere (Amp)
An ampere (amp) is a measure of the amount of electric charge passing a point in an electric circuit. In 
other words, it is the speed that the electricity travels through a device, wire, and system.
Current
Current requirements diﬀer by manufacturer and device. Available as an alternating or direct current, 
they must be correctly coordinated in order to have proper operation and function of electrical devices.
www.it-ebooks.info

168    |   SECURING DEVICES
ALTERNATING CURRENT AC
Alternating current (AC) is the typical power used in our homes and standard outlets. The current is 
sent to and from the device in alternating directions. If you have ever noticed a buzzing sound at a door 
with an electric strike when power is sent to it, you are likely hearing the alternating current running 
through the device.
DIRECT CURRENT DC
Direct current (DC) can eliminate the buzzing sound and is a one-way current similar to that of a battery 
and does not create a buzzing sound.
Extended Lip
Depending on the manufacturer, electric strikes are available with the option to extend the lip of the 
strike. This would be necessary if the door were not ﬂush with the edge of the door and inset into a 
reveal in the frame. This would give the latch a plate to rub against as it swings in and out of the reveal 
in the frame instead of possibly scraping against the frame’s paint or ﬁnish and possibly scratching it.
Fail Safe
Fail-safe strikes are available to tie into a ﬁre alarm system. This trim only locks when power is applied 
to the opening and unlocks when power is released. This function uses power all of the time, but is 
necessary to meet the codes in certain situations if electriﬁcation is necessary at the opening. The 
devices are manufactured diﬀerently, depending on the manufacturer and options, and can be 
operated by solenoid or a motorized mechanism, which would retract and throw the bolt accordingly, 
or simply allow the lever or knob to be rotated to retract the latch manually.
Fail Secure
Fail-secure strikes are available for locking and unlocking a device. This trim only unlocks when power 
is applied to the opening and locks when power is released. This device uses less power than fail safe, 
as the power is only used when necessary to open the device. The devices are manufactured diﬀerently, 
depending on the manufacturer and options, and can be operated by solenoid or a motorized 
mechanism, which would retract and throw the bolt accordingly, or simply allow the lever or knob to 
be rotated to retract the latch manually.
Voltage
Voltage requirements diﬀer by manufacturer and device. Available with various voltages, such as 
12 VAC or DC, and 24 VAC or DC, they must be coordinated properly in order to have proper operation 
and function of electrical devices. With that said, there are manufacturers that have devices that operate 
with multiple voltages, so one does not need to coordinate them when purchasing the devices, but you 
should do so when installing them to be certain there are no errors and the devices are not ruined and 
left unusable.
QUANTITIES
Unlatch devices are installed in single quantities of one device per latch.
APPLICATIONS
Mortise
Unlatch devices are mortised into the strike frame jamb, where power is run to the device, typically 
down the jamb from the ceiling above, where it is typically connected to a building’s power supply.
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    169
INSTALLATION
An unlatch device is typically installed on the frame or on the inactive leaf of a pair of doors, and the 
latchbolt and or deadbolt of the locking device is secured in the keeper of the strike. The latchbolt 
of the locking device is pushed through the strike and keeper of the unlatch device once the strike is 
released, not requiring the latchbolt to be retracted by the handle or knob as with mechanical strikes.
If an unlatch device is being installed on a stile and rail door, always conﬁrm the lock stile’s dimension 
to ensure that the device will have enough room to be installed.
Fasteners
Unlatch devices are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood or 
metal door and frame material. Phillips and ﬂat-head screws are available, depending on the 
manufacturer’s standard, and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, 
security stud, and torx.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.
Locations
Unlatch devices should be installed at locations as recommended by industry standards and codes, 
which are typically measured from the ﬁnished ﬂoor. Depending on the door and frame type, whether 
they are considered standard or custom metal, wood, or aluminum, standards recommend starting the 
ﬁrst hinge from the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
STANDARD STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Standard steel doors and frames are recommended to have the centerline of the strike on the frame 
installed at 40 5/16 inches.
CUSTOM STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Custom steel doors and frames are recommended to have the centerline of the strike on the frame 
installed at 38 inches.
FLUSH WOOD DOORS AND FRAMES
Flush wood doors are recommended to have the strike on the frame installed at 40 5/16 inches.
Preparations
Unlatch device preparations are typically machined at the factory, including the drilling and tapping of 
screw holes. With metal doors and frames, the preparation is typically a cutout in the location where an 
unlatch device will be installed.
ELECTROMAGNETIC LOCKSETS
Also Known As: Electromagnets, Magnetic Locks, Magnetic Locksets, Magnetic Locking Device
DESCRIPTION
Electromagnetic locksets were one of the ﬁrst types of electriﬁed locking devices, and although 
there are many new devices and technologies available, electromagnetic locksets are still used today. 
They are typically used on retroﬁt applications on existing doors and on stile and rail, full glass doors 
requiring minimal modiﬁcation to the door, frame, and surrounding conditions as a way to add security

and locking power, and to regulate who passes through a doorway or access point, by the use of a 
release device such as a card reader or keypad.
As with many codes and standards, through experience and time, these have changed through the 
years and language has been added to speciﬁcally address electromagnetic locksets, some prohibiting 
their use altogether.
Since electricity is required to power the magnet, all electromagnetic locks are fail-safe and will release 
and allow the door to be opened unless equipped with a backup power supply. Electromagnetic locks 
operate on DC power and, unlike electric strikes, are silent when locked or unlocked.
PROPERTIES
In addition to the wiring and electronic components inside of the device, there are two parts to an 
electromagnetic lockset, the magnetic lock body and an armature, both of which can be installed on 
the door or frame, depending on the application and available options from the manufacturer.
Armature
The armature is typically installed on the door and is the component that the electromagnetic lock 
aligns and secures with in order to lock the opening. The electromagnetic lock obviously needs 
electricity to operate, and the armature is basically a piece of metal that requires no power, which is 
likely why it is installed on the door, since the power originates from the wall and has to be transferred 
to the door through a transfer device. It is typically more secure and easier to install, and there are fewer 
possibilities for something to go wrong if the electromagnetic lock is installed on the door frame, which 
is easily connected to the power in the wall or ceiling above.
Body
The body is powered by electricity, which creates a very strong magnetic force that secures the door 
and frame by holding them together. If the electricity or power to the device is lost, the electromagnet 
will release from the armature, allowing the door to open. When it is in operation, release is achieved by 
switching oﬀ power to the magnet by the use of a release device, which is typically wired or tied into the 
electronic access control and security system. Release device options are a pushbutton switch, motion 
detectors, and biometric devices, which read unique characteristics of people such as ﬁngerprints, the 
retina of the eye, vein patterns of the wrist, and the entire face.
Finishes
Typically available in the same ﬁnish as the body material used to manufacture the electromagnetic lockset, 
satin stainless steel, anodized aluminum ﬁnishes, satin aluminum, black, and brown are most common. A 
version primed for painting is also available, and some manufacturers oﬀer cover plates, also known as dress 
covers, that allow customary and consistent ﬁnishes similar to the balance of the installed door hardware.
Grades
According to ANSI/BHMA A156.23 American National Standard for Electromagnetic Locks, 2012, 
electromagnetic locksets should meet the minimum testing standards. These testing standards include 
cycle and operational tests requiring minimum cycles of 250,000 for grade 3; 500,000 for grade 2; and 
1,000,000 for grade 1.
Materials
Depending on the grade, quality, and manufacturer, electromagnetic lockset bodies can be 
manufactured from a steel (more commonly stainless steel) or aluminum material. The armature is 
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    171
typically manufactured from a steel material with through-bolts attached to the armature plate, which 
are used to attach the armature plate to the door.
TYPES
There is really only one type of electromagnetic lockset, where the body is powered by electricity and 
“locks” or adheres via electromagnet to the armature. The diﬀerences in the types of electromagnetic 
locksets are more in the various applications and options from the various manufacturers.
OPTIONS
Automatic Relock Timer
Once the power is removed from and unlocks the device, an automatic relock timer allows an 
electromagnetic lock to reset itself, power back up, and be ready to secure the opening again. The 
timer is typically adjustable and can be set anywhere from 0 to 30 seconds.
Brackets
Various brackets are available to suit common and unique door and frame applications and surrounding 
conditions.
ALUMINUM SHIM
An aluminum shim bracket is available to lift the electromagnetic lockset oﬀ the surface to accommodate 
installations, typically existing, that are not ﬂush.
HEADER
As with all hardware that is installed into a frame cavity, a header bracket is available to give additional 
reinforcement to the shear lock or concealed electromagnetic lockset installations to give the hardware 
a more substantial installation into the void in the frame.
WOOD DOOR
As with all hardware that is installed into a door cavity, reinforcement brackets are available for wood 
door shear lock or concealed electromagnetic lockset installations to give the hardware a more 
substantial installation into the void in the door. This helps prevent the face, or veneer, of the door from 
being damaged or removed in part or altogether during installation or stressful use of the opening.
ZBRACKET
Named Z-brackets due to their shape, these hardware pieces are available for in-swinging door 
installations. As with most door hardware, we try to keep anything that can be tampered with on the 
secure (or inside) of the opening. On a typical out-swinging door, the electromagnetic lock is installed 
on the push side of the door on the head of the frame. On in-swinging doors the stop of the frame is 
in the way, and in order to accommodate an armature alignment for locking, the Z-bracket is installed.
Camera
As the typical use of an electromagnetic lockset is to regulate who passes through a doorway or access 
point, by the use of a release device such as a card reader or keypad, and in order to consolidate devices 
and reduce the wiring requirements to an opening, some manufacturers have manufactured security 
cameras into their electromagnetic locksets as an added feature.
Clamps
Clamps are an option that secures the electromagnetic lockset with more than just electricity. In 
addition to the magnetic power, clamps aﬃxed to the body latch onto the armature, holding it in place, 
increasing the holding force by thousands of additional pounds.

172    |   SECURING DEVICES
Conduit
Conduits are available for installations that require higher security and protection of the wires. Rather 
than having the wires exposed inside of the door and frame in route to their connections, such as 
the power supply and power transfer device, conduits are available to envelope and secure the wires, 
which helps deter tampering.
Connectors
Electronic hardware has historically been connected by twisting together wires, but now there are 
plastic connectors, typically Molex®, which are prewired by the manufacturer so that their hardware 
will connect easily by plugging the devices together. Such connections would be available on hinges 
that connect to door harnesses that carry power across the door to the locking device.

SECURING DEVICES    |    173
Dress Covers
Electromagnetic locksets are typically available in stainless steel or anodized aluminum materials and 
ﬁnishes. Therefore, dress covers, also known as cover plates, are available to give the electromagnetic 
lockset additional ﬁnish options similar to the balance of the door opening in order to match it as 
closely as possible.
Exit Delay Timer
Also known as delayed egress timers, exit delay timers are typically used to alarm a door similarly to 
an alarm option, with the added feature of delaying the egress, or exit through the opening. There 
are certain codes and authorities that have jurisdiction that do not allow delayed egress devices due 
to their interpretation of the device being more harmful than helpful to people who use the opening.
If the device is allowed by code, there are typically requirements such as a maximum timed delay and 
notiﬁcation by signage stating that there is a delay and the length of it. When codes do not allow a 
delayed egress function, an alarm option is typically used instead.
Fail Safe
Electromagnetic locksets require power to operate. Therefore, they are only available with fail-safe 
operation, which means they are devices that can tie into a ﬁre alarm system. When power is removed, 
the lock releases, or unlocks, allowing the door to be opened. Fail-safe operation uses power all of 
the time, but is necessary to meet the codes in certain situations if electriﬁcation is necessary at the 
opening. The devices are typically operated by a solenoid.
Holding Force
Available for various applications, depending on the facility type and security required, electromagnetic 
locks are available in a range of holding forces from several hundred to several thousands of pounds. 
The holding force is the number of pounds pressure that must be applied to the opening with the 
intent to force the opening to unlock.
Housings
Available for surface-mounted applications, housings are typically metal materials shaped the same 
way as the electromagnetic lockset, manufactured the full width or height of the door opening. This is 
FIGURE 2.113 Exit Delay Timer
(Source: Courtesy of SARGENT® Manufacturing Company)
www.it-ebooks.info

174    |   SECURING DEVICES
purely an aesthetic option to give the installation a full appearance rather than that of an installation on 
a short section of an opening with a void or space along the side of the device.
FULL LENGTH
Full-length housings are available for horizontal head of frame applications that extend from one frame 
jamb leg to the other.
VERTICAL
Vertically mounted housings are available for vertical applications, which typically include two magnets, 
one near the top and one near the bottom of the opening. This allows for an equal distribution of force 
and holding. If someone tried to pull the door and it was not secure at the bottom, for instance, there is 
a chance the door could be pulled or broken away, depending on the device and force applied. In lieu 
of installing the device as you would typically at the head of a door and frame, this would install from 
the foot of the frame along the entire height of the jamb leg to the frame head.
LED Indicator
Depending on the additional options and function of the electromagnetic lockset, some have light 
emitting diode (LED) lights to indicate certain functions or various statuses of the device.
Sealed
A sealed option does just that, seals the device from anything penetrating the inside and damaging the 
working electronic components. All corners, edges, connections, and seams are ﬁlled with an adhesive 
material that seals and bonds the edges to create a sealed box.

Sensors/Switches
ACCESS PANEL
Access panel sensors and switches are available in order to generate an alarm to prevent unauthorized 
access to the wires, boards, and conﬁguration options of the device.
ARMATURE
Armature sensors and switches are available in order to generate an alarm in the event of the 
misalignment of the armature and the body.
DOOR POSITION
Door position switch applications typically send a signal when the door is in the open position and not 
properly in the frame and wired to an alarm and or computer system. The device can be a mechanical 
trigger depressed by a door when it closes into a frame or a magnetic device that aligns when the door 
and frame are ﬂush in the closed position.
The newest in electromechanical devices functions, and some have a door position switch built into 
the device itself. With that said, the door position switch signal does not necessarily mean that the door 
is latched, locked, and secure, but there are other devices that can assist with that, including a latch 
position switch and electromechanical locking devices. The signal can be sent one or more of many 
ways, including as a local alarm at the door, a remote alarm at one’s computer, or a text message to a 
cell phone.
REQUEST TO EXIT
Request to exit switches are an electriﬁed option available to shunt an alarm during an authorized exit. 
Rather than using a separate motion sensor, which could act as a request to exit, requiring additional 
wiring and hardware to be installed on the door and frame, this option combines a motion sensor and 
electromagnetic lockset into one device. If a door has a local or remote alarmed exit hardware device, 
door and frame signal switch, or lever or latchbolt monitoring switch, a request to exit switch sends a 
signal to the contact, alarm, or computer stating that the doorway is being accessed from the exit side 
and that no credentials are required. This shunts the alarm, allowing the person to go through without 
having to present electronic credentials.
QUANTITIES
Electromagnetic locksets function in one set per door leaf, with an armature and body that are 
connected by wires to the required electrical voltage current. Single units with two magnets for a pair 
of doors all housed in one body are available, which require one point of wiring but also require both 
doors to operate in the same fashion at the same time, either both locked or both unlocked.

APPLICATIONS
An electromagnetic lock is typically installed on the frame or on the inactive leaf of a pair of doors, 
and the latchbolt and or deadbolt of the locking device is secured in the keeper of the strike. The 
diﬀerence between an electric strike and an unlatch device is that the keeper of an electric strike opens 
to release the strike, whereas the unlatch device pushes the latch out of the device, in reality retracting 
the latchbolt from the device.
Surface Mounted
Surface-mounted electromagnetic locksets are surface-mounted to the door and frame. The armature 
and required brackets are on either the door or frame and the electromagnetic lockset body is on the 
opposite side. As with most door hardware, we try to keep anything that can be tampered with on the 
secure side or inside of the opening.
FIGURE 2.116 Single Surface-Mounted Electromagnetic Lock
(Source: Courtesy of copyright © 2002–2013, Securitron Magnalock 
Corporation, an ASSA ABLOY Group Company)
INSWING
In-swing doors require the use of an additional bracket called the Z-bracket, so named because of its 
shape. On in-swinging doors the stop of the frame is in the way, and in order to accommodate an 
armature alignment for locking, the Z-bracket must be installed.
OUTSWING
A typical out-swinging door has the electromagnetic lock installed on the push side of the door on the 
head of the frame.
Shear
Also known as concealed, shear electromagnetic locks are concealed in the door and frame and are 
only visible when the door is separated from the frame in the open position. The lock body is typically 
installed in the frame and the armature in the door, this way the wiring does not have to extend through 
a hanging device and into the door in order to power the device.
INSTALLATION
Electromagnetic locksets can be installed either on the face of the door and frame or mortised into the 
door and frame, also known as concealed or shear, and should be installed as recommended by the 
standards and manufacturers’ recommendations.
As with any other type of door hardware device, although it is more aesthetically pleasing to install a 
concealed device, it might require consistent adjustments and maintenance.
Surface-mounted devices are more reliable and are installed either horizontally at the head of the 
frame and door or vertically along the lock and strike edge of the door and frame.
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    177
Be aware of surface electromagnetic lock installations. A surface-mounted device that is mounted on 
the top rail of a door might require a certain dimension of surface so that the device is not visible 
through the glass. For example, if a device closer requires 5 inches of surface to be mounted and the 
top rail is not coordinated and is only 4 inches, there are brackets that can assist in mounting the device, 
but 1 inch would be visible through the glass.
Fasteners
Electromagnetic locksets are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood 
or metal door and frame material. Phillips and ﬂat-head screws are available, depending on the 
manufacturer’s standard, and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, security 
stud, and torx. The armatures can be installed on the door with through-bolts, which give it a more 
substantial installation able to withstand high abuse and frequent use.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.
Locations
Electromagnetic locksets should be installed at locations as recommended by industry standards, 
codes, and manufacturers’ recommendations.
Preparations
Concealed or shear electromagnetic lockset preparations for metal doors and frames are typically 
machined at the factory, while wood door machining can be done either in the ﬁeld or at the factory, 
including the drilling and tapping of screw holes. Reinforcements can be used as recommended by the 
manufacturer to give the installation additional support.
ACTIVE LEAF OF PAIR OR SINGLE DOOR
Once we complete the requirements for the inactive leaf of a pair of doors, or if we are working with a 
single door only, the following are the choices of hardware.

DEADLOCKS
Also Known As: Deadbolt
Considered an auxiliary lock, deadlocks are typically used for doors that are not in the path of egress 
such as a closet door or as a secondary locking device as on an apartment entrance door.
PROPERTIES
Deadlock bodies are manufactured as bored, mortise, or surface mounted. In addition to the body and 
depending on the function, options can include combinations of cylinders and thumb turns.
Anti-Microbial Coating
Deadlocks are available with an optional anti-microbial coating. The coating is a silver-ion–based clear 
coating that helps stop the spread of bacteria. Although there are silver ions, they are not visible to 
the eye and a brass or bronze ﬁnish shows its true color through the coating. Silver has been used 
throughout history to help reduce the spread of bacteria and infection: Why not put it on doors and 
hardware that is touched over and over again by numerous people in a day?
Backsets
Most deadlocks are available with a 2–3/4-inch backset. A backset is measured from the edge of the 
door along the face to the centerline of the cylinder keyhole. Most deadlocks are also available with 
a 2–3/8-inch backset. Some deadlocks are available with adjustable backsets, allowing you to switch 
between 2 3/8 inches and 2 3/4 inches. Although not common, there are backset deadlocks with 
custom dimensions available.
Bolt
The bolt is the locking portion of the device. It extends across the clearance, or gap between the door 
and frame, and into the strike plate. Some codes state that the bolt must extend into the strike at least 
½ inch. Depending on the codes, the bolt can be extended with any combination on the inside and 
outside by a cylinder or thumb turn.
Case
Also known as the chassis or body of a bored or cylindrical deadlock, the case is where all of the 
components are connected and work together to operate.

SECURING DEVICES    |    179
Cylinder
A cylinder is a component that the key enters and rotates in order to operate the deadlock. Please refer 
to Cylinder for Locking Devices in the Inactive Leaf section of this chapter.
Door Thickness
Deadlocks are available for standard 1–3/4-inch-and 1–3/8-inch-thick doors but have options to extend 
the cylinder and thumb-turn components to operate thicker doors.
FIGURE 2.119 Backset Diagrams

180    |   SECURING DEVICES
Finishes
Visible parts of a deadlock typically consist of a cylinder face, thumb turn if that is part of the function, 
front or faceplate on the edge of the door, and strike plate on the frame. Deadlocks are available in most 
architectural ﬁnishes, depending on the manufacturer and the availability of ﬁnish materials.
Front
The front is one of the visible parts of the deadlock and is the cover or faceplate on the edge of the door, 
covering the inside mechanisms of the deadlock and giving it a decorative cover.
Grades
Deadlocks are available in diﬀerent grades, cited as grades 1 through 3, with grade 1 being the best 
and highest grade. Testing is diﬀerent for interior and exterior openings. The following are a few of the 
areas for interior tests and standards per ANSI/BHMA A156.36 American National Standard for Auxiliary 
Locks, 2010.
Housing
Also known as the mortise body of a mini-mortise or mortise body, this is where all of the components 
are connected and work together to operate.
Lead Wrapped
Lead-wrapped deadlocks are available on mortise-type deadlocks. The lead is typically hand wrapped 
by the manufacturer for installations where one side of the door needs to protect against radiation 
escaping that room.
Materials
Deadlocks parts, including internal working parts, cylinders, thumb turns, decorative plates, and strikes 
can be manufactured from brass, bronze, zinc, stainless steel or steel and other metals or mixes of 
metals, depending on the manufacturer.
Strike Plate
Also referred to as a strike, the strike plate is typically a piece of metal that comes in standard sizes with 
a hole in the middle to accept the deadlock bolt in order to secure the opening. The strike is typically 
installed on the inactive leaf of a pair of doors or the strike jamb of a door frame, and typically has the 
same ﬁnish as the lockset and balance of hardware.
Thumb Turn
A thumb turn is a part of a deadlock that rotates and operates the deadbolt of the deadlock to extend 
and retract it. A thumb turn is typically installed on the inside of the door opening, allowing those 
securely inside to operate the thumb turn to unlock or lock the door from the inside of the space. A 
thumb turn may have limited operation, such as a classroom deadlock, which will only allow the user 
to unlock or disengage the deadbolt from the strike plate in lieu of both locking and unlocking it. This 
is a security feature that prevents someone with bad intentions from locking him- or herself in a public 
space with others, prohibiting the entry of rescuers from the outside.
Wrought Box
A wrought box strike is a strike plate with an added ﬁve-sided box behind it. This gives the deadbolt 
additional protection from the inside of the frame is used most typically when a frame is ﬁlled with concrete 
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    181
for security and stability. Using a wrought box strike means the area where the deadbolt goes is safe; the 
concrete ﬁlls in around the box, allowing the bolt to have space behind the frame to work properly.
TYPES
Bored
Also Known As: Cylindrical
Similar to a bored lockset, this deadlock is a much simpler securing device than the mortise and is 
installed through a standard 2.126-inch (54-mm) hole bored through the door.
Mini-Mortise
Mini-Mortise deadlocks are very similar to mortise deadlocks, except the body is half the size or less of 
a standard mortise deadlock body.
Mortise
Able to withstand the most abuse, a mortise deadlock is one of the more durable and reliable types 
deadlocks. A pocket is prepared at the edge of the door into which the mortise deadlock body ﬁts. 
While this pocket is standard, the locksets have diﬀerent hub and cylinder spacing—these are the 
cutouts or preps needed for the cylinder and thumb turn, and they diﬀer by manufacturer.
This means if the door is prepared for one manufacturer, but the deadlock speciﬁcation is changed or 
another is substituted without approval, the holes in the ﬁeld will have to be modiﬁed. This is a touchy 
subject when applicable to ﬁre rated doors and is technically not allowed by code (although there are 
some circumstances that permit the modiﬁcations).
Rim
A rim deadlock sits on the face of a door ﬂush with the rim of the door, also known as the door edge. 
This deadlock typically has a cylinder on the outside and a thumb turn on the inside of a door, but 
FIGURE 2.120 Deadlock Thumb Turn

FIGURE 2.123 Rim Deadlock
(Source: Courtesy of SARGENT® Manufacturing Company)
sometimes you might see a cylinder on both sides, where the occupancy, application, and codes allow 
(with other requirements of the application, places of worship might be one example of a deadlock 
with cylinders on both sides of the door).
The thumb turn and or key typically operate two drop bolts that align with a strike on the frame, 
preventing the door from swinging open when engaged. This type of device is typically a secondary 
lock in a dwelling or residential of apartment entrance.
Tubular
Tubular deadlocks do not have a body or chassis and require minimal preparation on the face of the 
door, but they still have to be prepared to accept the deadbolt on the edge of the door. The deadbolt 
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    183
is operated by the thumb-turn stems that extend through the deadbolt base inside of the door. By 
turning the thumb turn, the deadbolt is retracted or extended.
OPTIONS
Deadlocks do not have many options other than function and ﬁnish types. They are also distinguished 
by the type of bolt that the deadlock projects. A deadlock might have a bolt that ﬂips up, projects out, 
or hooks into the frame. Hook bolts might be used on doors that slide and require the hook to hold the 
door secure against the frame jamb so that they cannot be pulled apart.
QUANTITIES
Deadlocks are typically installed one per door opening, whether a single door or a pair. The deadlock 
engages and secures into the inactive leaf of the pair of doors or the door frame of a single door 
application. It is possible to use more than one per opening (should someone wish to be creative), but 
typically there is only one.
APPLICATIONS
Bored
A bored deadlock application is a hole through the faces of the door and a preparation at the edge of 
the door for the latchbolt of a cylindrical or bored deadlock.
Surface Mounted
A surface-mounted deadlock application is typically a rim lock mounted on the face of one side of the 
door at the edge, or rim of the door, with a cylinder extended through the other side and face of the 
door.
Mortised
A mortised deadlock application is a deadlock that is installed in a mortised pocket on the edge of the 
door. The function, handle, cylinder, and thumb turn of any door preparations are on the face of the 
door, which line up with the same holes in the mortised lockset body or housing.
INSTALLATION
A deadlock device is typically installed on the door and secures into the door frame or the inactive leaf 
of a pair of doors, and the latchbolt and or deadbolt of the locking device is secured in the keeper of the 
strike. The applications, as shown in this section under Applications, are bored or mortised.

184    |   SECURING DEVICES
If a deadlock is being installed on a stile and rail door, always conﬁrm the lock stile dimensions to ensure 
that the device will have enough room to be installed.
Fasteners
Deadlock devices are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood or metal 
door and frame material. Phillips and ﬂat-head screws are available, depending on the manufacturer’s 
standard, and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, security stud, and torx.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.
Locations
Deadlock devices should be installed at locations as recommended by industry standards and codes, 
which are typically measured from the ﬁnished ﬂoor. Depending on the door and frame type, whether 
considered standard or custom metal, wood, or aluminum, standards recommend starting the ﬁrst 
hinge from the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
STANDARD STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Standard steel doors and frames are recommended to have the centerline of the strike on the frame 
installed at 48 inches.
CUSTOM STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Custom steel doors and frames are recommended to have the centerline of the strike on the frame 
installed at 46 inches.
FLUSH WOOD DOORS AND FRAMES
Flush wood doors are recommended to have the strike on the frame installed at 48 inches.
Preparations
Deadlock device preparations are typically machined at the factory, including drilled and tapped screw 
holes. With doors the preparations would be the mortised pocket or bored hole, and on the frame the 
preparation would be the strike plate.

ELECTROMAGNETIC LOCKSETS
Please refer to Electromagnetic Locksets in the Inactive Leaf section of this chapter.
LATCHSETS AND LOCKSETS
Also Known As: Latch or Lock, Latching or Locking Device
DESCRIPTION
Latchsets and locksets are available as various types, which bring varying levels of complexity for the 
preparation of a door and frame. While a latchset might be used simply to keep a door in the frame 
securely while providing a means to grab and open the door, a lockset typically provides security for 
any entry of authorized users from one space to another.
PROPERTIES
Latchsets and locksets are made up of various components. The body or chassis is where all of the 
components, such as handles, latches, and cylinders, come together to create the working device.
Anti-Microbial Coating
Latchsets and locksets are available with an optional anti-microbial coating. The coating is a silver-ion–
based clear coating that helps stop the spread of bacteria. Although there are silver ions, they are not 
visible to the eye and a brass or bronze ﬁnish shows its true color through the coating. Silver has been 
used throughout history to help reduce the spread of bacteria and infection: Why not put it on doors 
and hardware that is touched over and over again by numerous diﬀerent people in a day?
Backsets
Most latchsets and locksets are available furnished with a 2 3/4-inch backset. A backset is measured 
from the edge of the door along the face to the centerline of the cylinder keyhole. Depending on the 
manufacturer, latchsets and locksets are also available with other backsets, including 2 3/8-inch sets, 
with some having both narrower and longer options.
Bolt
See also, the Deadbolt and Latchbolt in this section. The bolt is the locking porting of the device. It 
extends across the clearance, or gap, between the door and frame and into the strike plate. Some codes 
state that the bolt must extend into the strike at least ½ inch. Depending on the codes, the bolt can be 
extended with any combination on the inside and outside by a cylinder or thumb turn.
Case
The case is also known as the chassis or body of a bored or cylindrical deadlock; it is where all of the 
components are connected and work together.
Connectors
Electronic hardware has historically been connected by twisting together wires, but now there are 
plastic connectors that are prewired by the manufacturer so that their hardware will connect easily by 
plugging the devices together. Such connections would be available on hinges that connect to door 
harnesses that carry power across the door to the locking device.

Cylinders operate a lockset from the outside (and sometimes from the inside, depending on the 
application and code restrictions), in order for it to function.
Please refer to the Cylinder for Locking Devices in the Inactive Leaf section of this chapter.
Deadbolt
A deadbolt is a bolt that protrudes out of the side of the locking device. A deadbolt has a squared edge 
in the shape of a rectangle, rather than the triangular shape of a latchbolt. The deadbolt can be the only 
locking device, as with a deadlock, keeping the opening secure in the frame with the ability to retract 
the bolt and open the door from either side with a key or thumb turn. It can also be a secondary locking 
device used to complement a latch, incorporated into the same device, such as a mortise lockset with 
a deadbolt function. The deadbolt operates by rotating a thumb turn or key, extending across the 
clearance, or gap, between the door and frame and into the strike plate. Some codes state that the 
latchbolt must extend into the strike at least ½ inch.

Deadlatch
A deadlatch is a small bolt that protrudes out of the side of the locking device, but rather than engaging 
inside of a hole in a strike plate, it depresses up against the strike plate. This latch is a secondary measure 
to tell the locking device that the door is in the closed position, and further secures the latchbolt from 
being forced open without authorization to do so (without a key).
Door Thickness
Latchsets and locksets are available for standard 1 3/4-inch- and 1 3/8-inch-thick doors, but depending 
on the manufacturer, they may also have options to extend the cylinder and thumb-turn components 
to operate thicker doors.
Finishes
Finishes are applied to the visible parts of a latchset or lockset, typically consisting of a cylinder face, 
thumb turn if that is part of the function, front or faceplate on the edge of the door, strike plate on the 
frame, and operating handles, knobs, or pulls. Latchsets and locksets are available in most architectural 
ﬁnishes, depending on the manufacturer and their available selection.
Front
The front is one of the visible parts of the latchset or lockset and is the cover or faceplate on the edge 
of the door, covering the inside mechanisms, giving the latchset or lockset a decorative cover and ﬁnish 
to match the rest of the exposed hardware on the door.

SECURING DEVICES    |    187
Grades
Latchsets and locksets are available in diﬀerent grades, including grades 1, 2, and 3, with grade 1 being 
the best and highest grade. The various ANSI/BHMA American National Standards for latchsets and 
locksets, clearly state that the testing requirements are the minimum standards, and it is important to 
know that there are some manufacturers that just meet the minimum standards, while some go well 
above and beyond the standards, giving the device a much longer life cycle. What does this mean to 
the customer? It means fewer replacements, less labor to replace them, less cost, and less impact on the 
environment due to less materials ending up in the landﬁll over time.
Various tests that take place with locksets include door ram tests, to test the strength of the latches 
and bolts; impact tests, to test the strength of the device itself; torque tests, to test the strength 
of the lever handle and mechanisms behind them; and cycle tests, which test how many times the 
device has operated, such as how many times a handle is rotated, in turn retracting and extending 
the latchbolt.
Housing
Also known as the body of a latchset or lockset, this is where all of the components are connected and 
work together to operate the mechanism.
Latchbolt
A latchbolt is a bolt that protrudes out of the side of the latching or locking device. A latchbolt has 
a ramped edge in more of a triangular shape, rather than the rectangular shape of a deadbolt. The

latchbolt can be a simple latching device that does not lock, but rather keeps the opening secure in 
the frame with the ability to retract the latch and open the door from either side at any time. It can 
also be a locking device that can be secured in the extended or latched position in the strike plate. The 
latchbolt operates on a spring and its natural position is extended; it extends across the clearance, or 
gap, between the door and frame and into the strike plate. Some codes state that the latchbolt must 
extend into the strike at least ½ inch. Depending on the codes, the latchbolt can be retracted by a 
thumb turn, knob, or most commonly a lever handle by rotating it. Once you release the handle, the 
latchbolt extends back out to its natural position.
Lead Wrapped
Lead-wrapped latchsets and locksets are available. The lead is typically hand-wrapped by the 
manufacturer around the body for installations where one side of the door needs to protect against 
radiation escaping that room possibly harming people on the nonradiation side of the door.
Materials
Latchsets’ and locksets’ parts, including internal working parts, cylinders, thumb turns, decorative 
plates, strikes, and handles, pulls, or knobs can be manufactured from brass, bronze, zinc, stainless steel, 
or steel and other metals or mixes of metals, depending on the manufacturer. Some manufacturers 
have options for rubber, nylon, leather, and other custom material pulls as well.
Strike Plate
Also referred to as a strike, the strike plate is typically a piece of metal that comes in standard sizes 
with a hole in the middle to accept the latchbolt or deadbolt in order to secure the opening. The 
strike is typically installed on the inactive leaf of a pair of doors or the strike jamb of a door frame 
and typically has the same finish as the lockset and balance of hardware. Strikes should cover the 
entire width of the rabbet of the frame, and if a longer reveal exists, custom length longer strikes 
should be used.
Thumb Turn
A thumb turn is a rotating part of a lockset that rotates and operates the deadbolt if included as a 
feature in the device. The thumb turn extends and retracts the latch or bolt, and it is typically installed 
on the inside of the door opening, allowing those securely inside to operate the thumb turn to unlock 
or lock the door from the inside of the space. A thumb turn may have limited operation, such as a 
classroom deadlock, which will only allow the user to unlock or disengage the deadbolt from the strike 
plate in lieu of both locking and unlocking it. This is a security feature that prevents someone with bad 
intentions from locking themselves in a public space with others, prohibiting the entry of rescuers from 
the outside.

SECURING DEVICES    |    189
Wrought Box Strike
A wrought box strike is a strike plate with an added ﬁve-sided box behind it. This gives the deadbolt 
additional protection from the inside of the frame; it is used most typically when a frame is ﬁlled with 
concrete for security and stability. By using a wrought box strike, the area where the deadbolt goes 
is kept safe and the concrete ﬁlls in around the box, allowing the latchbolt or deadbolt to have space 
behind the frame to work properly.
TYPES
Bored
Also Known As: Cylindrical
A much simpler securing device than the mortise, this lock is installed through a standard 2.126-
inch (54-mm) bored hole through the door—and typically, the only difference of the door

preparation between those from the different manufacturers is the location of the through-bolt 
holes. Through-bolts clamp the lockset to the door, sandwiching the door in between the rosettes 
holding the lockset together, preventing the chassis from moving or rotating within the bored hole 
preparation.
Until approximately 1992, there were no lever handles and there were no through-bolts 
manufactured by any company. When one rotated the knob and put too much pressure on the 
rotation, the entire chassis could spin, knocking the latch out of alignment. This prevented the 
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    191
door from latching into the frame properly—a major issue with fire rated door codes. Fortunately, 
times have changed.
Bored locksets have a limited choice in lever design (typically three or four choices) and although some 
special functions are available, there are not as many as with mortise locks.
Cabinet
Although cabinet locks might sometimes be speciﬁed by a door hardware consultant or furnished by a 
door hardware distributor, they are typically speciﬁed in the cabinet speciﬁcation section as included 
with the cabinet itself.
Interconnected
An interconnected lockset has two latching or locking devices built into one, a latchbolt, which may 
or may not lock, and a deadbolt. The special feature of this lockset is that when the lever handle is 
rotated, both the latchbolt and deadbolt retract simultaneously. This is important to know for egress 
code requirements, where doors in the path of egress must release with one motion, not the normal 
two that it takes to retract a latchbolt of one lock and the deadbolt of another.
Mortise
Able to withstand the most abuse, a mortise deadlock is one of the more durable and reliable types 
deadlock. A pocket is prepared at the edge of the door into which the mortise deadlock body ﬁts. While 
this pocket is standard, the locksets have diﬀerent hub and cylinder spacing—these are the cutouts or 
preps needed for the cylinder and thumb turn, and diﬀer by manufacturer.
This means that, if the door is prepared for one manufacturer, but the deadlock speciﬁcation is changed 
or another deadlock substituted without approval, the holes in the ﬁeld will have to be modiﬁed. This is 
a touchy subject when applied to ﬁre rated doors and is technically not allowed by code although there 
are some circumstances that permit the modiﬁcations. The same goes for a thumb turn if one is part of 
the function of the lockset on the inside of the door.

For mortise locksets that have a deadbolt feature, it is important to know that the deadbolt is retracted 
simultaneously with the latchbolt when the handle is rotated, for egress code requirements. Doors in 
the path of egress must release with one motion, not the normal two that it takes to retract a latchbolt 
of one lock and the deadbolt of another.

Preassembled
Also Known As: Cut and Notch
Preassembled locksets are called this because they are preassembled at the factory and installed onto 
the door in one piece. A notch is cut into the edge of the door into which the lockset is slipped and 
secured from the inside with screws.
Preassembled locksets are one of the more expensive locksets due to their being very substantial in 
makeup and cost to produce and its limited resources of manufacturing. Until several years ago, there was 
a single source of preassembled locksets, but now there are many imports that compete with the original.

FIGURE 2.142 Preassembled Lockset Diagram
(Source: Corbin Russwin®, Inc.)
Tubular
Tubular latchsets do not have a body or chassis. The latchbolt is operated by the thumb-turn stems 
through the deadbolt base. By turning the thumb turn, the latchbolt is either retracted or extended.
Although there are manufacturers who have many handle designs from which to choose, tubular sets 
are typically available in passage, privacy, and dummy functions. The reason for the limited available 
functions is the fact that the tubular device does not have the room that a body or chassis does. The 
latchbolt is operated by the handle’s mounting stems or screws that go through the latchbolt base. 
By turning the handle, the latchbolt is retracted, which allows the door to be operated into the open 
position.

OPTIONS
Connectors
Electronic hardware has historically been connected by twisting together wires, but now there are 
plastic connectors that are prewired by the manufacturer so that their hardware will connect easily by 
plugging the devices together. Such connections would be available on hinges that connect to door 
harnesses that carry power across the door to the locking device.
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    197
Cylinders
There are many cylinder options from which to choose. Please refer to the Cylinder for Locking Devices 
in the Inactive Leaf section of this chapter.
Electriﬁcation
BATTERY
Some electriﬁed locking devices or components of a device, such as electronic trim, might operate on 
batteries if there is no hard-wired power source available to power the locking device or trim. Battery 
life on these types of devices has been optimized and gets better with new innovations. Some trim can 
last up to a year with indicator lights and or sounds that give you months of warning that the battery 
needs to be changed.
CREDENTIAL READERS
Locksets can be integrated with many functions and technologies such as electronic card readers, 
which have traditionally been installed on the wall next to the door opening and lockset. Card reader 
technologies include magnetic stripe, radio-frequency, and biometric components. With that said, 
there are various secure levels of radio frequencies, with greater encryption or security credentials 
required before access is authorized.
Credentials
Credentials are devices that are programmed into the security or access control system, so that when 
presented to the system, they can be conﬁrmed or denied by it. In order to be accepted, they have to 
have been programmed so that the system recognizes them when presented.
Additionally, credentials leave a record, or audit trail, of what credential, belonging to whom, was 
presented and either opened or did not open that particular locking device and door.
BIOMETRICS
Biometrics is the newest and most expensive type of credential-reading device. Biometrics is the 
measurement and analysis of unique physical characteristics of people. Biometrics devices, depending 
on the device and manufacturer, can read our ﬁngerprints, facial patterns, the iris or retina of the eye, 
the vein pattern beneath the wrist, and many other physical diﬀerences among each of us.
These characteristics must be programmed into the security or access control system by software 
and hardware that reads and stores our unique shapes and sizes in order to verify them later when 
presented to the reader.
CARD
A card key is a more commonly used type of electronic credential, where the card has the authorization 
to unlock a doorway to allow entrance. A card reader has historically been installed on the wall next 
to the opening, but technologies and solutions today allow the reader to be installed as part of the 
locking device.
The older cards have magnetic stripes, similar to the credit and ATM bank cards that we most commonly 
use today. They are also the cheapest and least secure as they can be copied and breached easily if you 
know how and have the proper equipment. This can be accomplished by purchasing a portable reader, 
which can be found online today and is fairly inexpensive.
www.it-ebooks.info

198    |   SECURING DEVICES
As this technology is easily defeated today, magnetic stripe card keys are now available with the ability 
to have a pin code programmed into them, so that once swiped, the pin code must match the user.
As a newer technology, computer chips, also known as smart chips, are built into the cards as the only, 
primary, or secondary means of security of the card. These cards might have the ability to be swiped if 
a magnetic stripe is available, or most typically a radio frequency (RF) signal is sent from the card to the 
reader without their having to make contact with each other.
When available to be programmed by the security or access control system, a secondary means of 
security can be built into the chip, which requires the use of a pin code or even a biometric read such 
as a thumbprint from the user.
FOB
A key fob is similar to the smart card and is a small plastic device that can be hung on a keychain 
like a conventional key. This technology also sends an RF signal between the fob and the card reader, 
FIGURE 2.146 Magnetic Key Card

SECURING DEVICES    |    199
conﬁrming or denying credentials and allowing or preventing the door’s unlocking for the user. Some 
key fobs have been turned into a bracelet, so that users can wear them around their wrists without wor-
rying about losing the credential/key, and some require another credential veriﬁcation device in order 
for the RF to operate, such as a biometric thumbprint reader, shown in Figure 2.150.

200    |   SECURING DEVICES
TAG
A key tag is similar to the smart card and key fob and is a small ﬂat and thin plastic device that adheres 
to an existing credit card or key card that might be used to operate another device. This technology 
also sends an RF signal between the tag and the card reader, conﬁrming or denying credentials and 
allowing or preventing the door’s unlocking for the user.
HARD WIRED
Hard-wired devices have wires running directly into them from an outside power source. The outside 
power source can be a voltage source, such as 24 VAC, or a power over Ethernet source through your 
computer cables that connect your network to the Internet.
INTEGRATED WIEGAND
Electriﬁed locksets are available with an integrated Wiegand card reader device. This reader is aprox-
imity type, where the card is presented within proximity of the reader and is read by radio frequency 
rather than the card having to physically contact the surface of the reader. This reader has historically 
been installed on the wall next to the locked side of the door (if installed per most typical egress 
codes).
High-security integrated Wiegand locking devices are available, which have a higher level of security 
and data encryption that is required by most federal government agencies.
INTELLIGENCE
Locksets can be equipped with intelligence, similar to that of your automobile. The newer the 
automobile, the more intelligent it has become, with what is called CAN bus technology. Have you ever

SECURING DEVICES    |    201
noticed when you turn the key, or nowadays push the ignition button, the lights and beeps and ﬂashes 
almost talking to each other? That is CAN bus, CAN, short for controller area network, is a standard that 
allows devices to communicate with each other without a host computer or software.
KEYPAD
Electriﬁed locksets are available with keypads. The keypads typically have numeric buttons or virtual 
touch screen buttons that are used to enter codes in order to gain authority to rotate the lever or 
knob and open the door. Keypads were the ﬁrst type of keyless lockset in a mechanical form. Once the 
technology advanced in the industry, the electronic option became available.
LATCHBOLT MONITORING
Latchbolt monitoring is an electriﬁed option that allows the monitoring of the latchbolt position, 
whether extended or retracted. This allows the signaling of any devices that have not extended and 
secured into the strike so that this can be followed up with in person to rectify the situation.
LEVER MONITORING
Lever monitoring is an electriﬁed option that allows the monitoring of the lever handle position, 
whether rotated or in the rest position. This allows the signaling of any lever handle that is in the rotated 
position, indicating that the latchbolt is likely retracted and not secure in the strike.
POWER OVER ETHERNET
Devices that are powered over Ethernet are energized by the Ethernet cable that hard-wires the 
computers to the network and the Internet, instead of having a separate voltage power source. The 
advantages of this network is low power consumption and the fact that the network and door monitors 
are always live and talking to the system, ready to alert one of any suspicious activity.

SECURING DEVICES    |    203
REQUEST TO EXIT SWITCH
Request to exit switches are an electriﬁed option available to shunt an alarm during an authorized 
exit. If a door has a local or remote alarmed exit hardware device, door and frame signal switch, 
lever or latchbolt monitoring switch, a request to exit switch sends a signal to the contact, alarm, 
or computer stating that the doorway is being accessed from the exit side and that no credentials 
are required. This shunts the alarm allowing the person to go through without having to present 
electronic credentials.
TRIM
Electriﬁed trim is available on the outside of an exit device door so that a door can be accessed from the 
outside with the use of an electronic access control system. Typically rigid, when a switch such as a card 
reader authorizes the credentials presented to it, the trim unlocks and is able to be rotated to retract 
the latchbolt, pull the door forward, and gain entry to the space.
Fail Safe
Fail-safe door trim is available to tie into a ﬁre alarm system. This trim only locks when power is 
applied to the opening and unlocks when power is released. This function uses power all of the time 
but is necessary to meet the codes in certain situations if electriﬁcation is necessary at the opening. 
The devices are manufactured diﬀerently, depending on the manufacturer and options, and can be 
operated by solenoid or a motorized mechanism, which retracts and throws the bolt accordingly or 
simply allows the lever or knob to be rotated to retract the latch manually.
Fail Secure
Fail-secure door trim is available for locking and unlocking a device. This trim only unlocks when power 
is applied to the opening and locks when power is released. This device uses less power than fail safe, 
as the power is only used when necessary to open the device. The devices are manufactured diﬀerently, 
depending on the manufacturer and options, and can be operated by solenoid or a motorized 
mechanism, which retracts and throws the bolt accordingly or simply allows the lever or knob to be 
rotated to retract the latch manually.
WIRELESS
In addition to the common household wireless ﬁdelity (WiFi) that we all know and use for our wireless 
Internet access through the use of a wireless router connected to the modem, there are other wireless 
technologies available and incorporated into many existing mechanics, including electronic door 
locksets. Some of these low-power-consumption wireless technologies send wireless signals to local 
hubs separate from the 802.11 routers that we are used to in our homes.
WIRELESS FIDELITY
Devices that have WiFi technology are typically powered by battery. These devices communicate on 
the same 802.11 wireless networks that we use to transmit our Internet signal from the hard-wired 
modem into the air so that our computers and mobile devices can connect and use the signal to do 
various things, most commonly access the Internet. New devices that incorporate both the modem and 
router are available from some Internet access providers.
The WiFi sends and receives data to and from the computers and system. The advantages of this network 
is low power battery consumption and easy network installation and communication, especially in 
existing conditions where running hard wires is not eﬃcient or sometimes even possible due to wall 
and frame materials. Although the system is not live all of the time, the network and door monitors 
“wake up” and talk to the system whenever there is any suspicious activity.

Fire Rating
Fire exit hardware devices are tested to meet ﬁre standards and codes, allowing them to be installed 
and operated on ﬁre rated door openings. Panic hardware is not necessarily tested and rated to meet 
ﬁre standards and codes.

SECURING DEVICES    |    205
Functions
Depending on the manufacturer and reentry application, there are many functions available to operate 
the outside trim of panic and ﬁre exit hardware. Functions range from simple mechanical passage and 
keyed locking to more technical options such as electronic locking and monitoring functions.
There are some more commonly used functions such as passage, privacy oﬃce, classroom, and storage. 
Although these functions are used the majority of the time, depending on the manufacturer’s avail-
ability, there are many other specialty functions from which to choose, such as hotel, dormitory, and 
automatic deadbolt lock. Figure 2.161 is the chart as listed in ANSI/BHMA A156.13 American National 
Standard for Mortise Locksets and Latches Series 1000, 2005.
Handing
As described in the Introduction, there are several ways to hand doors, frames, and hardware. Locksets 
are always a standard handing from the outside or locked side of the door. Either left hand (LH) or right 
hand (RH). If you are dealing with a passage function and there is no real secure side of the door in the 
locking sense, hand the door logistically as if there were an outside and inside, where the inside would 
have any visible mounting hardware such as screw heads.
Hotel Indicator
A hotel indicator is used in order to identify the state of the opening to someone on the outside of the 
door. The indicator might use words, colors, or both, such as “Occupied” in red and “Unoccupied” in 
green.

Keypad
The ﬁrst keyless lockset was a mechanical keypad. The buttons were typically numbers that are used 
to enter a combination in order to unlock the lock, rotate the handle or knob, and retract the latchbolt 
in order to open the door. Once electronic technologies reached door hardware, keypads became 
electronic, similar to smart phones.

Latching
Latching is a function of the latchbolt of a latch or lockset. The latchbolt is angled so that it can engage 
and slide into a strike plate and is typically installed on a door frame. Depending on the device type, 
there are diﬀerent latching options available, some of which include monitoring switches to determine 
whether or not the latch is projected properly from a remote location and via an alarm or computer.
www.it-ebooks.info

SECURING DEVICES    |    209
Trim
Trim, also referred to as knobs, lever handles, or pulls, is available in many options and designs depending 
on the manufacturer. The lever, knob, and pull are typically mounted on an escutcheon, which is a 
rectangular plate behind the lever or knob. This serves as a decorative plate, but conventionally also 
hides the fasteners behind the plate that are necessary to secure the device to the door.
ANTIVANDAL TRIM
Anti-vandal trim is an available option for lever handle trim that takes the pressure oﬀ of the lever 
handle. When an amount of pressure predetermined when the device is manufactured, is applied to a 
rigid or locked lever handle, the lever drops and separates itself from the stem so that the spindle and 
internal parts of the exit device do not get damaged. The lever can be reset by lifting it back in place, 
where the lever will operate the latch as required.
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH
This trim has been designed to minimize the possibility of someone harming themselves. Many strict 
guidelines must be met to obtain one of the many rating levels for safety, and many tests are performed. 
One test includes the ability to tie a string, shoelace, or wedge any item around the trim that would 
harm someone or aﬀect the operation of the device and opening.
Knob
Designed with slight indentations for gripping and rotating purposes, the behavioral health knob is 
available. It might be possible that certain areas and doorways of behavioral health facilities occupancy 
might not need to comply with ADA.

www.it-ebooks.info

210    |   SECURING DEVICES
Lever
Designed in the shape of a lever handle, these devices have met some of the guidelines and give the opening 
a more conventional aesthetic rather than that of a healthcare facility. Some manufacturers have more 
options, follow more guideline standards, and have enhanced the operation and aesthetics of the device.
Paddle
Paddle trim is designed to both assist with minimizing harm and operation and to assist with ease 
of operation of the door opening. One could easily manage the paddle while carrying something, as 
compared to having to rotate a lever handle to gain entry.
DECORATIVE
Trim can also be an aesthetic component of the locksets and latchsets. Some manufacturers oﬀer many 
lever handle design choices for all hardware types; some have suites that allow consistent design on all 
hardware types. Other matching lever types include exit devices, electronic access control locksets, and 
tubular passage, privacy, and dummy trim. There are also suites of hardware available that include lever 
handles for locksets, pull handles for glass and sliding doors, drawer pulls, door stops, coat hooks, and 
hinges. With coordination, this would give the entire opening, interior, and building a consistent door-
opening design.
ELECTRIFIED
Electriﬁed trim is available on the outside of an exit device door so that a door can be accessed from 
the outside with an electronic access control system. Typically rigid, when a switch such a card reader 
authorizes the credentials presented to it, the trim unlocks and is able to be rotated to retract the

latchbolt, pull the door forward, and gain entry to the space. Other available trim options include a fail-
safe or a fail-secure function, the voltage required, latch monitoring, lever monitoring, latch retraction, 
and request to exit. See the Options/Electriﬁed in this section.
ESCUTCHEON
An escutcheon is a backplate to the trim and, if there is one, has the cylinder on the outside and a 
thumb turn on the inside of the door. Escutcheons can be rectangular, oval, or custom in shape and can 
be installed ﬂush, with pattern, or with framed edges.
HAZARD WARNING
Some standards and codes require that knobs and lever handles have a hazard warning signal for those 
who have vision impairment. Manufacturers oﬀer very limited choices to meet the hazard warning 
requirements, as follows.
Abrasive Coating
An abrasive coating is a nonsticky, black tar–like material with gravel-type material mixed into it. The 
material is a thick liquid when applied and coats the entire knob or lever handle, except for the cylinder 
opening. When dry, the trim has a rough, black tar–like coating and ﬁnish.

SECURING DEVICES    |    213
Knurled
A knurled handle has patterns of scored on and metal removed from the surface of the knob or lever 
handle. These “bumps” are typically on the back side of the knob or handle where the ﬁngers would 
feel the coarse, uneven surface and markings on the trim.
HEAVY DUTY
Heavy-duty trim is available for very frequently used door openings that might need to withstand high-
abuse situations. This trim is typically very strong and will outlast conventional duty-trim.
KNOB
Knob trim is available for the outside operation of panic and ﬁre exit hardware. Typical knobs are round, 
although some custom knobs might be oval or square. In 1992, lever handles became the new standard, 
as knobs no longer met the requirements or complied with the ADA.
LEVER
Lever trim is available for the outside operation of panic and ﬁre exit hardware. Typically elongated and 
oriented horizontally across the door face at the door lock edge, lever handles have many designs and 
choices in aesthetic. Some manufacturers oﬀer lever trim designs for their panic and ﬁre exit hardware 
consistent with their other locking device oﬀerings, such as mortise locksets or electronic access 
control locking hardware.
Lever handle trim became the new standard in 1992 to meet the new ADA standard and requirements. 
These and current requirements roughly state that doorways cannot be operated by a twisting or 
pinching motion, which is how a doorknob is conventionally operated. With a lever trim, you can lean 
on the lever and still retract the latch to operate the door.
Certain codes require that the lever have a return to the door at its end, with no more than ½-inch 
clearance between the end of the return and the door face. This is to prevent anything from getting 
caught behind the lever handle, such as clothing or a ﬁre hose prior to being ﬁlled with water.
RIGID
Rigid trim is trim that does not move and is always ﬁxed in one position. Examples of rigid trim are pull 
handles and dummy trim.
ROSETTE
A rosette is a backplate to the trim on both the outside and inside of the door. Rosettes can be 
rectangular, round, oval, or custom in shape and are installed ﬂush, with pattern, or with framed edges.
QUANTITIES
Latchsets and locksets are typically used in quantities of one per door opening for either a single door 
or a pair of doors. With that said, there are some applications and locking devices that might allow the 
use of two latchsets or locksets on a pair of doors. One application would be a Dutch door that might 
use a deadlock to keep the top and bottom leaves together and secure. Another application might be a 
pair of doors that are installed in a frame with a center mullion. In this case, unless codes require egress 
panic or ﬁre exit hardware, a lever latch or lockset could be used on both leaves.
APPLICATIONS
Bored
A bored latchset or lockset application has a hole through the face of the door and a preparation at the 
edge of the door for the latchbolt of a cylindrical or bored deadlock.

FIGURE 2.174 Bored Lever Handle Lockset
(Source: Courtesy of SARGENT® Manufacturing Company)
Detention
A detention grade lockset is a very heavy-duty basic locking device that is typically operated by what is 
known as a mogul key. The mogul key is very large with large cutouts where it engages into the lockset 
to operate the deadbolt or latchbolt.
Mortise
A mortised latchset or lockset application is a latchset or lockset that is installed in a mortised pocked 
on the edge of the door. The function, handle, cylinder, and thumb turn of any door preparations are on 
the face of the door and line up with the same holes in the mortised lockset body or housing.
Rim
A rim-mounted latchset or lockset application is a device surface-mounted on the face of the door. This 
is not a common application or device used as a primary means of securing a door, but might be more 
likely a secondary means such as a deadlock.

216    |   SECURING DEVICES
INSTALLATION
A latchset or lockset device is typically installed on the frame or on the inactive leaf of a pair of doors, 
and the latchbolt and or deadbolt of the locking device is secured in the keeper of the strike. Something 
to be aware of is the room available to install a lockset on the edge of the door, also known as the door 
stile. The stile for most locksets, both mortised and bored, is approximately 5 inches. There are narrow 
stile latchsets and locksets available for narrower backset locksets and smaller bodies, but the typical 
room needed to install a lockset comfortably is 5 inches. The same hardware ﬁts into 4 1/2 inches, but 
is very snug and allows no room for error or poor preparation and installation. One might not have 
enough room on a stile and rail door or a panel type door where the panel is recessed and allows less 
room for the device.

SECURING DEVICES    |    217
Fasteners
Latchset and lockset devices are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood 
or metal door and frame material installation. Phillips and ﬂat-head screws are available, depending 
on the manufacturer’s standard, and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, 
security stud, and torx.

FIGURE 2.179 Bored Lockset Being Installed on Door

218    |   SECURING DEVICES
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.
Locations
Latchset and lockset devices should be installed at locations as recommended by industry standards 
and codes, which are typically measured from the ﬁnished ﬂoor. Depending on the door and frame 
type, whether considered standard or custom metal, wood, or aluminum, standards recommend 
starting the ﬁrst hinge from the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
STANDARD STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Standard steel doors and frames are recommended to have the centerline of the strike on the frame 
installed at 40 5/16 inches.
CUSTOM STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Custom steel doors and frames are recommended to have the centerline of the strike on the frame 
installed at 38 inches.
FLUSH WOOD DOORS AND FRAMES
Flush wood doors are recommended to have the strike on the frame installed at 40 5/16 inches.
Preparations
Latchset and lockset device preparations are typically machined at the factory, including the drilling 
and tapping of screw holes. With doors the preparations are typically a bored or mortised cutout for 
the body, function holes, thumb turns, cylinders, and any handles of the device. The frame preparations 
are typically the cutout for the strike plate at the same location where the latchbolt and or deadbolt 
protrude from the lockset and door to the strike on the frame.

Now that we’ve hung and secured the door, the third part of the sequence is to specify operating trim. 
Whether there is a locking device speciﬁed or not, such as a mortise lockset or panic hardware, next we 
must specify or schedule a door pull, push plate, or a push-pull bar. There are many diﬀerent manufac-
turers and variations of operating trim—there is something for just about everyone’s aesthetic taste. 
With that said, if you want to create your own, some manufacturers have the ability to fabricate one’s 
custom design or patterns into existing operating trim.
DOOR PULLS
Also Known As: Pulls, Pull Handles
DESCRIPTION
Door pulls are typically installed on doors that do not require latching or locking and are more for 
simple function and or aesthetic appeal. There are manufacturers that have locking pull options, typi-
cally used on full glass door entrances.
PROPERTIES
Finishes
Door pulls are typically available in all architectural ﬁnishes to match the balance of hardware speciﬁed, 
such as the hanging, securing, or controlling devices.
Grades
Door pulls are not categorized in grades but should comply with standards in Workmanship and Per-
formance Tests as described for Product Category J400 in the current version of ANSI/BHMA A156.6 
American National Standard for Architectural Door Trim.

Materials
Depending on the material, door pulls can be manufactured of aluminum, brass, ceramic, plastic, stain-
less steel, stone, wood, and other suitable materials.
TYPES
There are various types of door pulls available and manufacturers have created their own variations 
of materials, shapes, and sizes for each of the basic types. The current version of ANSI/BHMA A156.6 
American National Standard for Architectural Door Trim describes the recognized types.
Straight
A straight pull is a pull that is typically installed vertically on the face of a door. The ends of the pull can 
either curve back to attach to the door or posts might extend out of the side of the pull at various points 
along the vertical axis.
Oﬀset
An oﬀset pull is a pull that is typically installed vertically, but unlike a straight pull, the ends or mounting 
posts go horizontally across the door before returning to the face of a door. The ends of the pull can 
either curve back to attach to the door or posts might extend out of the side of the pull at various points 
along the vertical.

Flush
A ﬂush pull is a pull that is typically used for sliding doors and mortised into ﬂush with the face of a door. 
The pull portion of it is a recess in the face of the pull where your ﬁngers, other body part, or device 
could grab the pull and open the door.

228    |   OPER ATING TRIM
There are also recessed edge pulls, which are used for pocket-type sliding doors. The doors, when 
open, are recessed in a pocket between two walls, and the ﬂush pull can be popped up out of the side 
of the door in order to grab the pull and slide the door closed.
Drop-Ring
A drop-ring pull is a pull that can be surface-mounted or recessed in the face of a door. The pull portion is 
a ring that pivots oﬀ on a ﬁxed mount away from the face of the door, allowing you to pull a door forward.
Pull Plate
A pull plate is a straight or oﬀset pull typically vertically mounted to the center of a push plate, 
although it might be oﬀset on the plate. The ends of the pull can typically curve back to attach to 
the push plate.
Set Option
A set option is a straight or oﬀset pull vertically mounted to a push plate. The mounting is typically with 
posts that extend out of the side of the pull at various points along the vertical.
SIZES
Door pull sizes are typically speciﬁed by a manufacturer’s speciﬁc model number. The model number 
includes the door pull diameter and length dimension. The length dimension typically describes the 
end-to-end dimension, no matter where the mounting takes place (at the ends or with center posts). 
FIGURE 3.8 Pull Plate

www.it-ebooks.info

OPER ATING TRIM    |    229
For model numbers that are not standard sized or for custom door pull sizes, the custom length must 
be speciﬁed. Door pull installation lengths are typically referred to as center-to-center dimensions, that 
is, the center of the mounting posts or ends of pulls. This is not to be mistaken by the overall dimension, 
which might be longer than the installation dimension.
OPTIONS
Anti-Microbial Coating
Door pulls are available with an optional anti-microbial coating. The coating is a silver ion–based clear 
coating that helps stop the spread of bacteria. Although there are silver ions, they are not visible to 
the eye and a brass or bronze ﬁnish shows its true color through the coating. Silver has been used 
throughout history to help reduce the spread of bacteria and infection: Why not put it on doors and 
hardware that is touched over and over again by numerous people in a day?
Custom Sizes
There are manufacturers that will manufacture custom door pull designs, including special shapes, 
metal extrusions, sizes, colors, and materials. Be prepared for an additional cost for any customization 
diﬀerent from a manufacturer’s standard models, sizes, shapes, or materials.
Decorative
Some manufacturers have more decorative-looking pulls in addition to the traditional square-cornered 
rectangular designs.

Edges
BEVELED
Pull plates include a push plate, which has the option for beveled edges. In addition to an aesthetic 
preference, beveled edges are softened at the end to a 45-degree angle back to the door instead of a 
90-degree square edge. It is typical for all edges of a push plate to be beveled.
SQUARE
Pull plates include a push plate, which might have the option for square edges. In addition to an 
aesthetic preference, square edges are a 90-degree cut back to the door. These can be dangerous as 
the edges can be sharp.
Engraving
Manufacturers have the ability to engrave some of their door pulls, especially if it’s a ﬂat-surfaced 
pull or a pull plate or set-option door pull. Engraving requests might be a room number in an oﬃce, 
educational, or healthcare facility, or possibly a tenant or employee name or title. Anything that would 
ﬁt on the surface could be accommodated by those manufacturers that have the ability.
QUANTITIES
Door pulls are furnished in single quantities and should be speciﬁed one for each door surface required 
along with the proper mounting, either single (through-bolted or concealed) or back to back.
APPLICATIONS
Flush Mounted
Door pulls can be ﬂush-mounted—typically a surface ﬂush or drop-ring pull—or have a concealed 
edge pull, typically used on pocket sliding doors.
Surface Mounted
Door pulls can be either surface-mounted on one side of a door with through-bolts (bolts that are visible 
on the other side of the door) or concealed-mounted, in which case the pull is not visible on the other 
side of the door. Pair door pulls are typically concealed-mounted and aligned back to back to each other.
INSTALLATION
Door pulls can be installed on one or both leaves of a single door or on a pair of doors and can be 
installed on one side or both as a single or back-to-back mounting.
Fasteners
Door pulls are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for installation on wood, metal, 
or glass door materials. A pull-plate door pull has countersunk screw holes around the perimeter, which 
should comply with ANSI/BHMA A156.6 American National Standard for Architectural Door Trim, 2005.
BACK TO BACK
Back-to-back mounting is typically installing two identical pulls mounted to each other through the 
same holes in the door using the same fasteners.
CONCEALED
Concealed mounting is typically a one-sided installation with a mounting plate or fastener. The pull is 
recessed and attached to the fasteners, then locked in place with a set screw, which is typically out of 
sight and underneath the pull end faces.
www.it-ebooks.info

OPER ATING TRIM    |    231
SELFADHESIVE
Self-adhesive double-faced tape is available from some manufacturers and might most typically be 
used with a pull-plate door pull. If self-adhesive tape is used, the plate does not have any screw holes, 
as with a typical installation.
THROUGHBOLT
Through-bolt fasteners are visible on the other side of the door and connect to the pull. Standard bolt 
heads or decorative bolt heads are available from some manufacturers.
Back-to-back fasteners are for pulls that are installed at the same location on both sides of a door. 
The fasteners are typically installed through the door and the pulls sit on top of the fasteners and are 
secured similarly to concealed fasteners with set screws on both sides of the door.
Special screw heads are available as an option, including security, security stud, and torx. It is recommended 
that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on a box of self-tapping 
screws, which might be more convenient for the installer, unless recommended by the manufacturer.
Locations
Door pulls should be installed at locations as recommended by industry standards and codes, 
depending on the door type, which are typically measured from the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
CUSTOM STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Custom steel doors and frames are recommended to have the centerline of a door pull installed at 
42 inches above the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
FLUSH WOOD DOORS AND FRAMES
Flush wood doors and frames are recommended to have the centerline of a door pull installed at 
42 inches above the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
STANDARD STEEL DOORS AND FRAMES
Standard steel doors and frames are recommended to have the centerline of a door pull installed at 
42 inches above the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
Preparations
Door pull preparations could be machined at the factory or in the ﬁeld, including the drilling and tapping 
of screw holes. With surface-mounted pulls, the screw holes are typically cut in the ﬁeld, while ﬂush pulls 
might be prepared at the factory as a preference due to the precision required for proper operation.
PUSH PLATES
DESCRIPTION
Push plates are typically installed on doors that do not require latching or locking and are more for simple 
function and/or aesthetic appeal. Surface applied, push plates come in many shapes such as rectangular/
square edged and round/radius edged, and some manufacturers oﬀer custom form shapes and edges.
PROPERTIES
Finishes
Push plates are typically available in all architectural ﬁnishes to match the balance of hardware speciﬁed 
such as the hanging, securing, or controlling devices.

Grades
Push plates are not categorized in grades but should comply with standards in Workmanship and 
Performance Tests as described for Product Category J400 in the current version of ANSI/BHMA A156.6 
American National Standard for Architectural Door Trim.
Materials
Push plates can be manufactured of aluminum, brass, ceramic, plastic, rubber, stainless steel, stone, 
wood, and other suitable materials.

There are various types of push plates available, and manufacturers have created their own variations 
of materials, shapes, and sizes for each of the basic types. The current version of ANSI/BHMA A156.6 
American National Standard for Architectural Door Trim describes each as related to Product 
Category J300.
Flat Plate
A ﬂat-plate push plate is typically installed vertically on the face of a door but can be installed in 
diﬀerent conﬁgurations on the door. The shape can be square edged, rounded, or a custom shape if 
available from the manufacturer.

Cold Forged
A cold-forged push plate is typically a standard or carbon alloy steel, which is forced into a die to 
create the shape, rather than stamping it out of metal like a ﬂat push plate. Although typically installed 
vertically, the plate can be installed in diﬀerent conﬁgurations on the door.
Push-Pull Plate
A push-pull plate is a push plate that has a pull projecting oﬀ the bottom end of the plate. The plate 
must be forged in order to get this shape to have any strength.
SIZES
Push plate sizes are typically speciﬁed by a manufacturer’s speciﬁc model number. The model number 
includes the push plate height, size, and thickness. It also includes any pull information such as 
diameter and center-to-center dimension if a pull plate is being used.
OPTIONS
Anti-Microbial Coating
Push plates are available with an optional anti-microbial coating. The coating is a silver ion–based clear 
coating that helps stop the spread of bacteria. Although there are silver ions, they are not visible to

There are manufacturers that will manufacture custom push plates, including special shapes, metal 
extrusions, sizes, colors, and materials. Be prepared for an additional cost for any customization of a 
manufacturer’s standard models, sizes, shapes, or materials.
Decorative
Some manufacturers have decorative push plates in addition to the traditional square-cornered 
rectangular designs.
Edges
BEVELED
Push plates have the option for beveled edges. In addition to being an aesthetic preference, beveled 
edges are softened at the end to a 45-degree angle back to the door instead of being a 90-degree 
square edge, which is safer than a square edge. It is typical for all edges of a push plate to be beveled.
SQUARE
Push plates might have the option for square edges. Although it might be an aesthetic preference, 
square edges have a 90-degree cut back to the door, which can dangerous due to their sharpness.

a room number in an oﬃce, educational, or healthcare facility, or possibly a tenant’s or employee’s 
name or title. Anything that will ﬁt on the surface could be accommodated by those manufacturers that 
have the ability to do engraving.
QUANTITIES
Push plates are furnished in single quantities and should be speciﬁed one for each door surface required.
APPLICATIONS
Surface Mounted
Push plates are typically surface-mounted, on either one side of a single acting door or on a door that 
swings in one direction. Push plates can also be mounted on both sides of a double-acting door or on 
a door that swings in both directions such as a restaurant kitchen door.
INSTALLATION
Fasteners
Push plates are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for installation on wood or 
metal door materials. A push plate typically has countersunk screw holes around the perimeter, which 
should comply with ANSI/BHMA A156.6 American National Standard for Architectural Door Trim, 2005.

Accessories for Pairs 
of Doors Only
If we are working with a pair of doors, the next step in the sequence is to include accessories for pairs of 
doors, including coordinators and carry bars. These devices help us coordinate the closing and opening 
of certain pair of door applications.
COORDINATOR
Also Known As: Door Coordinator
DESCRIPTION
As its name suggests, this device coordinates the closing sequence of a pair of doors with an active and 
inactive door using automatic ﬂushbolts. When opened and then released, if the active door closes 
before the inactive, the automatic ﬂushbolts on the inactive leaf will not secure properly. If the inactive 
leaf is not secured, that would prohibit the active leaf form securing properly, in reality leaving both 
doors unsecure and not in compliance with any ﬁre codes that might be required for that opening.
A coordinator is not one of the more aesthetically pleasing devices, but it serves an important function 
by meeting codes requiring both leaves of a pair of doors to latch.
PROPERTIES
Finishes
Coordinators are typically available in a primed ﬁnish, intended to be painted the same color as the 
door frame in the ﬁeld. There are some manufacturers that oﬀer limited ﬁnishes.
Materials
Depending on the type and in addition to the springs and metal parts inside the device, coordinators 
are available manufactured with aluminum, brass, and steel metals.

TYPES
Although all work toward the same end result in coordinating the closing sequence of a pair of doors, 
there are various types of coordinators available with diﬀerent applications for each.
Bar
A bar coordinator is a rectangular tube-like device that has springs and mechanisms inside that 
operate two triggers at either end of the device. If the active door closes faster than the inactive 
one, the active door trigger holds the active door until the inactive door passes and depresses the 
inactive door trigger. Once the inactive door trigger is depressed, the active door trigger releases and 
allows the active door to close. This device might have options to work with vertical rod exit devices, 
which typically latch in the same location where the bar coordinator is installed. Factory cutouts are 
coordinated for the vertical rod exit device it will work with and cut into the bar at the factory so the 
latches have someplace to latch.
Gravity
Although similar in function, a gravity coordinator is quite diﬀerent in operation and appearance from 
the bar coordinator. The gravity coordinator is operated with a roller-stop and lift mechanism that piv-
ots on a base plate that is attached to the face of a door frame and relies on gravity to operate. If the 
active door closes faster than the inactive, the active door roller stop holds the active door until the 
inactive door passes and rotates the lift arm, which raises the roller stop above the active door allowing 
it to close.
Universal
With a body and installation similar to a bar coordinator, the universal coordinator has two arms that 
extend and retract out of the face with rollers at the end of each. When the doors move to the open 
position, the arms of the coordinator extend. If the active door closes faster than the inactive one, 
the active door roller stop arm holds the active door until the inactive door passes and depresses the 
inactive roller stop arm, which releases the active roller stop arm allowing the active door to close. The 
universal coordinator does not typically have the option to allow vertical rod exit devices to latch.

SIZES
Bar
Bar coordinators are typically available in various sizes to accommodate various door widths. Manufac-
turers typically provide recommendations for minimum and maximum door width sizes.
Gravity
The gravity coordinator is available in one size but sometimes with varying roller stop arm lengths to 
accommodate diﬀerent door width sizes. Manufacturers typically provide recommendations for mini-
mum and maximum door width sizes.
Universal
Universal coordinators are typically available in one size to accommodate up to certain door widths. 
Manufacturers typically provide recommendations for minimum and maximum door width sizes.
OPTIONS
Filler Bar
Filler bars are available for bar coordinator installations. Most bar coordinators will not ﬁll the entire 
width of the rabbet on the head of a frame where it is installed. Therefore, manufacturers oﬀer matching 
ﬁller bars, which are the same shape, size, and ﬁnish as the bar coordinator. Filler bars come in certain 
widths and can be cut in the ﬁeld to ﬁll any size space.
Mounting Brackets
Mounting brackets are available in diﬀerent sizes and conﬁgurations for the installation of bar coordi-
nators that have conﬂicting stop mounted hardware. Such hardware might be a parallel arm closer or 
surface vertical rod exit device strike.
FIGURE 4.3 Universal Door Coordinator

www.it-ebooks.info

246    |   ACCESSORIES FOR PAIRS OF DOORS ONLY
QUANTITIES
Any type of coordinator is typically furnished in single quantities for each pair of doors. Mounting 
brackets for bar coordinators are typically furnished in sets of two, one for each end of the bar coordi-
nator, for each pair of doors.
APPLICATIONS
Face Mounted
Gravity coordinators are installed at the center on the face of a frame above the doorway.
Rabbet Mounted
Bar and universal coordinators are installed on the door side rabbet of a double rabbetted frame at 
the head.
INSTALLATION
Gravity coordinators are installed at the center on the face of a frame above the doorway while bar and 
universal coordinators are installed on the door side rabbet of a double rabbetted frame at the head. 
The bar and universal coordinators are typically ﬂush up against the stop of the frame, with the intent 
of giving the appearance of a single rabbetted frame.
Due to the bar coordinator’s mounting position, there may be conﬂicts with other hardware to be 
installed such as door closers and vertical rod exit device latches. In these circumstances, another item 
that might be required is the coordinator mounting brackets.
Fasteners
Coordinators are typically installed with self-tapping screw fasteners, which can be installed on various 
door frame materials.

Locations
BAR
Bar coordinators are installed on the door side rabbet of a double-rabbetted frame at the head and ﬂush 
against the stop of the frame with the intent of giving the frame a single-rabbetted frame appearance.
GRAVITY
Gravity coordinators are installed at the center on the face of a frame above the doorway and hang oﬀ 
of the face of the frame.
UNIVERSAL
Universal coordinators are installed on the door side rabbet of a double-rabbetted frame at the 
head. They are installed ﬂush against the stop of the frame with the intent of giving the frame a 
single-rabbetted frame appearance.
Preparations
Coordinator frame preparations are not necessary and are simply screwed directly to the head of the 
door frame rabbet or face of the door frame.
CARRY BAR
Also Known As: Carry Open Bar, Door Carry Bar
DESCRIPTION
A carry bar is used when the possibility exists that an inactive door can open before an active door. An 
application that might require this device is a mortise lock exit device on the active leaf and vertical rod 
FIGURE 4.7 Carry Bar

www.it-ebooks.info

248    |   ACCESSORIES FOR PAIRS OF DOORS ONLY
exit device on the inactive one. If the vertical rod exit device door is opened ﬁrst, the carry bar pushes 
the active door out far enough so that it can engage with the coordinator and for a proper closing 
sequence. If the vertical rod exit device door does not close ﬁrst, the mortise lock exit device door will 
not latch properly, prohibiting both leaves from latching at all.
PROPERTIES
Finishes
Coordinators are typically available with limited architectural ﬁnishes, most of the time available with a 
gray prime coat for painting in the ﬁeld, typically with the same color as the door and frame.
Materials
Depending on the manufacturer, carry bars are available manufactured with brass and steel metals and 
some with nylon rollers to assist with the opening of the active door.
TYPES
Although they are manufactured slightly diﬀerently, there is really only one type of carry bar. Most are 
manufactured out of a metal that is ﬁxed to the inactive door, with either a metal or nylon roller at the 
other end, which are used to assist with the opening of the active door.
SIZES
Carry bars are very small, no more than 2 inches by 3 inches on either side.
OPTIONS
Adjustment
The only option available for some carry bars is an adjustment to the length of the arm. The adjustment 
allows for use with various door sizes and gives the device an extra 1/2 inch extension if necessary.
QUANTITIES
Carry bars are typically furnished in single quantities for each pair of doors.
APPLICATIONS
Surface Mounted
Carry bars are surface-mounted on the push side face of the inactive door.
INSTALLATION
Fasteners
Carry bars are typically installed with through-bolts in order to give the device a more secure installa-
tion to the face of the door.
Locations
Carry bars are typically located on the push side and near the top edge of the inactive leaf of a pair 
of doors.
www.it-ebooks.info

ACCESSORIES FOR PAIRS OF DOORS ONLY    |    249
Preparations
Carry bar preparations are not necessary and they are simply through-bolted to the edge the active 
door of a pair of doors in the ﬁeld.
SUBSTITUTIONS
If product substitution requests are allowed for door hardware, it is typically speciﬁed in Division 1 of 
the project speciﬁcations. The substitution request requirements typically request product data and 
proof that the requested substitute will meet the same grade, function, application, aesthetic, and 
quality of the originally speciﬁed product.
Sometimes, to be more competitive on a bid, a less durable or lower-quality carry bar substitution 
might be oﬀered or take place without much or any knowledge at all. A cost credit might be oﬀered, 
and sometimes it might not be when the lesser quality substitution takes place. A lesser quality carry 
bar substitution might result in the failure of the installation, causing a necessary replacement of the 
product. This is also less sustainable since more parts are needed more frequently due to the premature 
replacement.
REFERENCES
Codes and standards are available to set the minimum requirements of door openings (see the Intro-
duction of this book for more information). Some jurisdictions have speciﬁc codes and standards, which 
were either modiﬁed from another existing code or created for their own use.

Closing and controlling a door is important for many reasons, including the protection of lives and 
materials, traﬃc control, security, and energy eﬃciency.
A closing device, also known as a door closer, is manufactured as diﬀerent types of ﬁxtures, depending 
on the function and application of the opening. Surface-mounted, concealed overhead in the door or 
frame, and concealed in the ﬂoor versions are available for diﬀerent applications with various options 
for each.
A controlling device, also known as a door stop, is also manufactured as diﬀerent types of mechanisms, 
including ﬂoor, wall, and overhead, in order to protect the door, frame, hardware, and surrounding con-
ditions. Sometimes a closing device is erroneously used as a controlling device, which it is not intended 
to be. Misusing the closing device shortens the life of the opening because of having to maintain and 
adjust the door, frame, and hardware time and time again.
Depending on the local codes and authority having jurisdiction, some door openings might have cer-
tain considerations in regard to their closing requirements if there are sprinklers installed on either side 
of the opening.
DOOR CLOSER
Also Known As: Closing Device, Closer
DESCRIPTION
A door closer is intended to close a door automatically after it has been opened. This is a manual device 
that works with springs and or hydraulic ﬂuid to create the proper tension and pressure to close the 
door as intended. A door might need to close for numerous reasons, such as for security purposes, 
because of ﬁre protection codes, for energy eﬃciency, or simply as a preference. With that said, door 
closers have many options, one of which is the ability to manually hold the door in the open position,

254    |   CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES
but there are certain restrictions with doing that if the door is ﬁre rated, as codes state that all ﬁre rated 
doors must close automatically at the time of a ﬁre.
PROPERTIES
Closers are typically furnished with a closer body, which is installed at the head of a door and frame. 
There are other types of closing devices such as spring hinges and ﬂoor closers, which are covered in 
Chapter 1, Hanging Devices.
Finishes
Closer bodies do not have ﬁnishes as they are covered by a metal or plastic cover. Plastic covers are typi-
cally furnished with a painted or powder-coated architectural ﬁnish to match as closely as possible the 
other hardware installed on the door such as the locking device. Powder coating is a process of baking 
on the paint, while metal covers allow for the matching of most standard architectural ﬁnishes, but at 
an additional cost.
Grades
Door closers are graded with grades 1, 2, or 3 depending on ANSI/BHMA test procedures. Such tests 
include cycle- and various valve-testing to meet minimum levels. Minimum levels, for example, for a 
surface or concealed in door, cycle testing for a grade 1 closer is 1 million cycles and 100,000 cycles with 
the backcheck valve control functional.
Materials
The internal parts and covers of door closers are manufactured from various metals and plastic, 
depending on the manufacturer. The arms are manufactured from brass, bronze, stainless steel, or 
steel, depending on their application and ﬁre rated door opening requirements.
SPRING
A spring is typically found to be part of a door closer, working together with hydraulic valves that 
require a lubricant to operate. The spring is wound and has tension in the same direction as the door 
swing, which helps with eﬃciency and operation of the door.
STOPS
Some door closers have built-in stops, which hard-stop the door at a set degree of opening. The stop 
function is typically manufactured into the closer arm and the opening degree is typically limited and 
depends on the application and manufacturer’s availability.
FIGURE 5.1 Surface-Mounted Door Closer Body

www.it-ebooks.info

CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES    |    255
VALVES
Closers are manufactured with various valves to assist with optimizing the closing and latching speeds 
and forces. These valves act in cycles of the door opening and closing.
Backcheck
Backcheck valves allow for adjustment to the opening force past about 65 degrees of the door in the 
open position to give the door less resistance, making it easier to push open.
Delayed Action
Delayed action valves are available to delay the initial closing of the door. This will allow something that 
moves slower than average more time to move through the opening without the door pushing right 
up behind it.
Latch Speed
Latch speed valves allow for adjustment to the latching speed cycle. This would be the speed once past 
the closing speed cycle and give the door enough force and power to clear any of the locking device 
latches or any other surrounding conditions that might aﬀect the closing, such as gaskets around the 
perimeter of the door.
Sweep Speed
Sweep speed valves allow for adjustment to the closing speed cycle. This would be the speed once 
initially released if the device has no Delayed Action option or once the delayed action has completed, 
and would aﬀect the closing up until about 15 degrees of the closed position.
TYPES
Door closers are available to suit various applications and aesthetics, including heavy-duty devices for 
high frequency–use doors and an old fashioned “pot belly” closer.
Surface Mounted
PARALLEL ARM
The parallel arm surface-mounted door closer mounts on the push side of the door and the arm is 
parallel with the door, making it less susceptible to vandalism or hanging oﬀ the arm if the closer has 
FIGURE 5.2 Parallel Arm Door Closer
(Source: Courtesy of Norton® Door Controls)
www.it-ebooks.info

256    |   CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES
to be mounted on the push side of the door. This type of installation is less eﬃcient than the regular 
arm installation due to the conﬁguration and requires more tension in the spring to close eﬀectively.
POT BELLY
Resembling a pot belly, the closer of the same name is a surface-mounted closer that is more rounded 
than square and protrudes out in front of the door.
REGULAR ARM
The regular arm surface-mounted door closer is always mounted on the pull side of the door, with the 
arm protruding oﬀ the face of the door and frame. Regular arm installation is the most eﬃcient of the 
surface-mounted installations due to the conﬁguration and force of the arm.
TOP JAMB
A top-jamb-mounted surface-mounted door closer body is mounted on the frame instead of the door, 
where the arm protrudes oﬀ the face of the frame door similar to regular arm installation. This applica-
tion is typically used when the closer is mounted on the door’s push side when there is a reveal. If the

CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES    |    257
door is set in a reveal, regular arm installation conﬁguration will not allow the arm to extend enough to 
the frame face, whereas if the closer body is on the frame, the arm can extend into the reveal enough 
to reach the door face.
Overhead Concealed in the Frame
Overhead concealed in the frame door closers, along with concealed in the door ones, are the least 
eﬃcient means of closing a door. This is typically due to the fact that the closer body is smaller than a 
surface-mounted closer and much smaller than a ﬂoor-mounted closer. The smaller body size means 
less room for the spring and valves, which assist in the optimum functionality of the closer.

FIGURE 5.7 Floor-Mounted Door Closer
(Source: Courtesy of Rixson®)
Overhead Concealed in the Door
Similar to overhead concealed in the frame, overhead concealed in the door closers are the least 
eﬃcient means of closing a door. This is typically due to the fact that the closer body is smaller than a 
surface-mounted closer and much smaller than a ﬂoor-mounted closer. The smaller body size means 
less room for the spring and valves, which assist in the optimum functionality of the closer.
Floor Mounted
Depending on the manufacturer, device, and applications, ﬂoor closers are typically the most eﬃcient 
type of hanging device and should be your ﬁrst choice for frequently used doors that need to self-close.
Please see Floor Closers in Chapter 1 for more information.
OPTIONS
Cold Weather Fluid
Cold weather ﬂuid is available in lieu of standard oil and ﬂuids used to operate the ﬂoor closer. This ﬂuid 
is speciﬁed and used in areas where extreme cold weather exists so that the ﬂuid does not thicken or 
freeze, which aﬀects the operation of the closer.
Cover
Door closers are available with a cover to hide the closer body and mounting hardware of the device 
such as the screws. Covers are available in both plastic and metal and come in various architectural 
ﬁnishes. Plastic closers have a painted ﬁnish to match the architectural ﬁnishes of other components 
www.it-ebooks.info

CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES    |    259
installed on the door as closely as possible, such as a securing device. A metal cover has the architec-
tural ﬁnishes available to match the other installed hardware more closely.
Delayed Action
A delayed action option delays, or slows down, the door and sometimes holds it for a short period of 
time at a certain degree. This option allows time for someone or something to pass through the door-
way without rushing or getting hit by the door while moving through the opening, without the need 
for a hold open feature.
Fire Rated
Door closers are typically tested and manufactured as ﬁre rated, but sometimes they might have to be 
speciﬁed and ordered as such. This means the material is steel or stainless steel and has been tested 
and passed by UL as ﬁre rated.
Hold Open
Hold open option is available to hold the door closer and door in the open position, which is a ﬁxed 
degree of opening. The hold open positions can vary depending on availability and cannot be used on 
ﬁre rated doors, as it requires a mechanical hold open device.
Lead-Lined Cover
Surface-mounted closers have the option for a lead-lined cover. The cover typically covers the entire 
door closer including fasteners and body, so any holes made during installation would be covered by 
the lead-lined cover, protecting those outside of the room not intended to receive radiation.
Mounting Brackets
In addition to standard, parallel, and top-jamb-mounting brackets, other various mounting brackets 
are available to assist with special installations such as corner brackets, narrow rail brackets, and stop 
arm brackets.
Nonsized
Nonsized door closers are the easiest to work with as they are adjustable and can operate many diﬀer-
ent door sizes and weights. Be cautious, though, as some nonsized or adjustable closers might not have 
the power that is required to operate all door types, so be sure to check the manufacturer’s recommen-
dations to avoid returns, back charges, and doors that do not operate properly.
Physically Handicapped
This option indicates the opening force complies with ICC/ANSI A117.1 (International Code Council/
American National Standards Institute) Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities, 2009, and the 
FIGURE 5.8 Narrow Top Rail Surface Door Closer 
Mounting Bracket
(Source: Courtesy of Norton® Door Controls)
www.it-ebooks.info

260    |   CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES
ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG). These standards require that any 
accessible opening have a 5-pound maximum opening force. This option cannot be used on ﬁre rated 
or exterior door openings, which override accessible codes and standards. Be aware that this option 
reduces the opening force, which in turn reduces the closing force, and might prevent the door from 
closing and latching properly or at all.
Security Cover
Security covers are available for special applications requiring additional protection. These covers are 
manufactured of steel and have high-security fasteners, which are more diﬃcult to tamper with and 
take more time to damage.
Sized
Door closers might be available with sizes, where the spring “size” provides the tension required for 
a particular door size or weight. Be cautious when using sized closers as they are not always easily 
adjustable and might not operate, that is, open or close a door properly.
Slide Track
Slide track installations are available for both the push and pull side of the door. This installation gives 
the door closer a more streamlined aesthetic but aﬀects the performance of the device, making it less 
eﬃcient than a standard installation. When installed on the pull side of the door, the closer is typically 
held open in a pocket and only closes when released during a ﬁre alarm situation.
Special Layouts
Some installations require custom layouts, and some manufacturers are willing to work with you to see 
if they have the ability to customize their tooling to create special mounting conﬁgurations as required.
QUANTITIES
Door closers are typically installed as one per door leaf.
FIGURE 5.9 Surface-Mounted Slide Track Door Closer

www.it-ebooks.info

CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES    |    261
APPLICATIONS
Concealed
Concealed closers can be concealed either in the head of the frame, the head of the door, or in the ﬂoor. 
The ﬂoor closer is typically the most eﬃcient type of door-closing device due to its size and the fact 
that the ﬂoor creates the least tension for the door, allowing for a consistently eﬃcient door operation.
Surface Mounted
The surface closer is the most used type, and can be mounted on the surface of the door and frame 
faces in various conﬁgurations. This is typically the second most eﬃcient type of door closer behind 
the ﬂoor closer.
INSTALLATION
Surface-mounted door closers are typically installed on the face of the door and frame. Although 
this is the most common type of installation, it is not the most eﬃcient. The ﬂoor closer is the ideal 
door-hanging and-controlling device due to its size and because it is on the ﬂoor, creating the least 
tension to the door opening and, if installed properly, a consistently eﬀective operation.
One clue that a regular surface-mounted door closer is not installed properly is the regular arm position. 
The arm should typically be at 90 degrees, perfectly perpendicular to the door frame and door upon 
which it is installed. If the arm is at any other degree except for facing straight ahead, it is likely not 
installed properly.

Be aware of door closer installations. A surface-mounted door closer that is mounted on the top rail 
of a door might require a certain dimension of the surface so that the closer is not visible through the 
glass. For example, if a door closer requires 5 inches of surface to be mounted and the top rail was not 
coordinated and is only 4 inches, there are typically brackets that can assist in mounting the closer, but 
1 inch will be visible through the glass.
Concealed closers can be installed either with the closer body in the door and arm attached to the 
head of the frame or with the closer body in the head of the frame and the arm in the head of the door. 
Although the door closer disappears and this is aesthetically pleasing, both of these are the least eﬀec-
tive means of closing a door because of the door closer body’s size and lack of ability to eﬃciently close 
a door for long periods of time without requiring adjustments.
Floor closers are installed underneath the ﬂoor and are the most eﬃcient type of door closer. They can also 
be used to hang the door in addition to closing it. This is also the most eﬃcient means of hanging a door.
FASTENERS
Door closers are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood or metal door and 
frame material. Phillips and ﬂat-head screws are available, depending on the manufacturer’s standard, 
and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, security stud, and torx. If installed 
on a wood door, proper closer “blocking” should be speciﬁed so that the reinforcements are there to 
support this very demanding piece of hardware, which puts a lot of stress on the door and frame upon 
which it is installed. If you are installing on a wood door, also consider through-bolt fasteners. Although

not aesthetically pleasing, since they are visible from the opposite side of the door that the door closer 
is installed on, they will give the installation more stability and longevity.
Floor closer mounting screws are in shear, not tension. This means for the door to come oﬀ the frame, 
the heads of the screws would have to be sheared oﬀ horizontally and the door would have to be lifted 
oﬀ the ﬂoor portion of the ﬂoor closer arm. Floor closers are available oﬀset or center hung.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.
LOCATIONS
Door closers are installed on diﬀerent points of the door, frame, and ﬂoor depending on the type and 
application and should be installed per the manufacturer’s recommendations.
PREPARATIONS
Door closer preparations vary by type and application and are typically reinforced with additional 
materials inside the door to assist with the screw-holding force.
Screw holes are typically drilled and tapped at the factory for metal doors but not for wood doors unless 
speciﬁcally requested. Expect a costly up-charge when requesting factory drilling and tapping. Similar 
to a standard hinge, when using heavyweight ﬂoor closers, using thicker gauge metal for the pivot arms 
means that the door and frame preparations need to be coordinated with the thicker materials.
ELECTRONIC OR PNEUMATIC DOOR CLOSERS
Also Known As: Electric Door Closers
DESCRIPTION
Typically used to tie into ﬁre alarm systems so that when the ﬁre alarm is activated, the electronic clos-
ers shut oﬀ, and the door closer releases and closes to secure the opening as intended by code. There 
are also versions of electronic and pneumatic door closers that operate and swing the door and frame 
open automatically in addition to closed, without having to push or pull on the door. Pneumatics take 
it one step further and require air pressure to actually operate the device that opens and closes the 
door. A switch, very commonly an actuator device, which is a large pushbutton, activates the automatic 
operator or electronic system in general to begin the process.
Similar to door closers, electronic and pneumatic door closers are typically furnished with a closer 
body, which is installed at the head of a door and frame. There are other types of closing devices such 
as spring hinges and ﬂoor closers.
Finishes
Electronic and pneumatic door closer bodies do not have ﬁnishes as they are covered by a metal or 
plastic cover. Plastic covers are typically furnished with a painted or powder-coated architectural ﬁn-
ish to match as close as possible the other hardware installed on the door, such as the locking device. 
Powder coating is a process of baking on the paint. While metal covers allow for the matching of most 
standard architectural ﬁnishes, but at an additional cost.
Grades
Electronic and pneumatic door closers are graded with grades 1, 2, or 3 depending on ANSI/BHMA test 
procedures. Such tests include cycle and various valve testing to meet minimum levels.
www.it-ebooks.info

264    |   CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES
Materials
The internal parts and covers of electronic and pneumatic door closers are manufactured from various 
metals and plastic, depending on the manufacturer. The arms are manufactured from brass, bronze, 
stainless steel, or steel, depending on their application and ﬁre rated door opening requirements.
SPRING
A spring is typically found to be part of an electronic door closer, working together with hydraulic 
valves that require a lubricant to operate. The spring is wound and has tension in the same direction as 
the door swing, which helps with eﬃciency and operation of the door.
STOPS
Some electronic door closers have built-in stops, which hard-stop the door at a set degree of opening. 
The stop function is typically manufactured into the closer arm, and the opening degree is typically 
limited and depends on the application and manufacturer’s oﬀerings.
SWITCHES
Most devices have switches to operate timers and other operations of the device, depending on the 
functionality available and necessary for the proper operation of the opening.
VALVES
Electronic and pneumatic door closers might also have mechanical components or might only operate 
mechanically while opening or closing the door, depending on the device type, its options, and the 
application. Devices are manufactured with various valves to assist with optimizing the closing and 
latching speeds and forces. These valves act in cycles of the door opening and closing.
Backcheck
Backcheck valves allow for adjustment to the opening force past about 65 degrees of the door in the 
open position to give the door less resistance, making it easier to push open.
Delayed Action
Delayed action valves are available to delay the initial closing of the door. This will allow something that 
moves slower than average more time to move through the opening without the door pushing right 
up behind it.
Latch Speed
Latch speed valves allow for adjustment to the latching speed cycle. This is the speed once past the 
closing speed cycle and gives the door enough force and power to clear any of the locking device 
latches or any other surrounding conditions that might aﬀect the closing, such as gaskets around the 
perimeter of the door.
Sweep Speed
Sweep speed valves allow for adjustment to the closing speed cycle. This is the speed once it is initially 
released, if the device has no delayed action option or once the delayed action has completed, and 
aﬀects the closing up until about 15 degrees of the closed position.
TYPES
Floor Mounted
Depending on the manufacturer, device, and applications, ﬂoor-mounted electronic door closers are 
available to hang and close the door by activating a switch.
www.it-ebooks.info

CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES    |    265
Overhead Concealed in the Frame
Overhead concealed in the frame door closers have been known to be the least eﬃcient means of clos-
ing a door. This is typically due to the fact that the closer body is smaller than that of a surface-mounted 
closer and much smaller than that of a ﬂoor-mounted closer. The smaller body size means less room for 
a spring and valves, which assist in the optimum functionality of the closer.
Surface Mounted
MOTION SENSOR HOLD OPEN
Some manufacturers oﬀer an electronic motion sensor built into their door closer. This sensor detects 
movement in the doorway, which holds the door in the open position until there is no movement. Once 
there is no movement detected, the door closer releases, but if someone stands still in the opening, the 
door will not sense the presence and will release and close automatically. Of course, this could result in 
injury, so it is important to keep moving through the doorway.
FIGURE 5.12 Electronic Motion Sensor Hold Open Door Closer
(Source: Courtesy of Norton® Door Controls)
PARALLEL ARM
The parallel arm surface-mounted electronic door closer mounts on the push side of the door and the 
arm is parallel with the door, making it less susceptible to vandalism or hanging oﬀ the arm. This type of 
installation is less eﬃcient than the regular arm installation due to the conﬁguration and requires more 
tension in the spring to close eﬀectively.
REGULAR ARM
The regular arm surface-mounted electronic door closer is always mounted on the pull side of the door, 
with the arm protruding oﬀ the face of the door and frame. Regular arm installation is the most eﬃcient 
of the surface-mounted installations due to the conﬁguration and force of the arm.
SMOKE DETECTOR
Electronic closers can have a smoke detector feature that can be tied into a facility ﬁre alarm system. 
Normally the door is held open, like a corridor door in a high-rise oﬃce building, but when the smoke 
is detected the alarm is set oﬀ, the closers release, and they close to secure the nonﬁre side of the 
door from the ﬁre side.
www.it-ebooks.info

266    |   CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES
TOP JAMB
A top-jamb-mounted surface-mounted electronic door closer body is mounted on the frame instead of the 
door, where the arm protrudes oﬀ the face of the frame door similar to regular arm installation. This applica-
tion is typically used when the closer is mounted on the door’s push side when there is a reveal. If the door is 
set in a reveal, regular arm installation conﬁguration will not allow the arm to extend enough to the frame face, 
whereas if the closer body is on the frame, the arm can extend into the reveal enough to reach the door face.
OPTIONS
ACTUATOR
Actuators are nothing more than large heavy-duty pushbuttons that initiate a system or device in order to 
operate it. Basically it is a big switch that turns a device on and oﬀ. The actuator can be timed to open for a 
certain period, or it can be instantaneous, where it would only work while one is holding down the button.

CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES    |    267
DEGREE OF OPENING
Most devices have the option to set the degree of opening. This allows for preferences to be set or 
accommodations to be made for any unexpected ﬁeld or installation conditions.
ELECTRONIC SWITCH
In addition to the actuator, the electronic switch is the most common switch used to operate electronic 
and pneumatic door closers. Any other electronic switch also would operate the device if installed 
correctly and operated as intended. For example, a card reader system could be used to activate a 
closer or a motion sensor from the egress side of the door.
TIMER
Timers are typically built into electronic closing devices in order to set the preferred operation 
time for closing and holding open the door. The timers can be set to preference or to meet any 
required codes.
QUANTITIES
Electronic and pneumatic door closers are typically installed one per door leaf.
APPLICATIONS
Concealed
Concealed electronic and pneumatic door closers can be concealed either in the head of the frame, 
the head of the door, or in the ﬂoor. The ﬂoor closer is typically the most eﬃcient type of door closing 
device due to its size and fact that the ﬂoor creates the least tension for the door, allowing for a consis-
tently eﬃcient door operation.
Surface Mounted
The surface-mounted electronic or pneumatic door closer is more eﬃcient than any concealed device 
and can be mounted on the surface of the door and frame faces in various conﬁgurations.
INSTALLATION
Surface-mounted electronic and pneumatic door closers are typically installed on the face of the door 
and frame. Although this is the most common type of installation, it is not the most eﬃcient.
Concealed electronic and pneumatic door closers can be installed either with the closer body in 
the door and arm attached to the head of the frame or with the closer body in the head of the 
frame and the arm in the head of the door. Although the door closer disappears and is aesthetically 
pleasing, these two types are the least effective means of closing a door due to the door closer 
body’s size and lack of ability to efficiently close a door for long periods of time without requiring 
adjustments.
Electronic and pneumatic ﬂoor closers are installed underneath the ﬂoor. They can also be used to hang 
the door in addition to closing it. This is typically the most eﬃcient means of hanging a door due to the 
weight being borne on the ﬂoor instead of in tension on the frame as is the case when they are hung 
by other means such as hinges.
Pneumatic devices require the installation of air-generating machines behind the wall that generate air 
pressure in order to operate the device installed on the door and frame. Pneumatic devices can be cost 
eﬀective if you are installing many devices, although relying on air pressure and additional machines 
can be a challenge.

268    |   CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES
Be aware of device installations. A surface-mounted device that is mounted on the top rail of a door 
might require a certain dimension of the surface so that the device is not visible through the glass. For 
example, if a device requires 5 inches of surface to be mounted on and the top rail is not coordinated 
and is only 4 inches, there are typically brackets that can assist in mounting the device, but 1 inch will 
be visible through the glass.
FASTENERS
Electronic door closers are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood or 
metal door and frame material. Phillips and ﬂat-head screws are available, depending on the manufac-
turer’s standard, and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, security stud, 
and torx. If the door closer is installed on a wood door, proper closer “blocking” should be speciﬁed 
so that the reinforcements are there to support this very demanding piece of hardware, which puts a 
lot of stress on the door and frame upon which it is installed. If you are installing on a wood door, also 
consider through-bolt fasteners. Although not aesthetically pleasing, since they are visible from the 
opposite side of the door that the door closer is installed on, they will give the installation more stabil-
ity and longevity.
Floor closer mounting screws are in shear, not tension. This means for the door to come off the 
frame, the heads of the screws would have to be sheared off horizontally and the door would 
have to be lifted off the floor portion of the floor closer arm. Floor closers are available as offset 
or center hung.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.
LOCATIONS
Electronic door closers are installed on diﬀerent points of the door, frame, and ﬂoor, depending on the 
type and application and should be installed per the manufacturer’s recommendations.
PREPARATIONS
Electronic door closer preparations vary by type and application and are typically reinforced with addi-
tional materials inside the door to assist with the screw-holding force.
Screw holes are typically drilled and tapped at the factory for metal doors but not for wood doors, 
unless speciﬁcally requested. Expect a costly up-charge when requesting factory drilling and tapping. 
Similar to a standard hinge, when using heavyweight ﬂoor closers, using thicker-gauge metal for the 
pivot arms means that the materials will be thicker and the door and frame preparations need to be 
coordinated.
POWEROPERATED DOOR CLOSERS
Also Known As: Automatic Operators, Auto Operators, Automatic Door Openers, Auto Door Openers, 
Electric Door Closers
DESCRIPTION
Typically used to assist with the operation of a doorway, such as an accessible opening for the elderly 
or disabled, a switch, very commonly an actuator device, which is a large pushbutton, activates the 
automatic operator or electronic system in general to begin the process.
www.it-ebooks.info

CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES    |    269
Similar to standard door closers, power-operated door closers are typically furnished with a closer 
body, which is installed at the head of a door and frame.
Finishes
Power-operated door closer bodies do not have ﬁnishes as they are covered by a metal or plastic cover. 
Plastic covers are typically furnished with a painted or powder-coated architectural ﬁnish to match as 
closely as possible the other hardware installed on the door such as the locking device. Powder coating 
is a process of baking on the paint. Metal covers allow for the matching of most standard architectural 
ﬁnishes, but for an additional cost.
Grades
Power-operated door closers are graded with grades 1, 2, or 3 depending on ANSI/BHMA test proce-
dures. Such tests include cycle- and various valve- testing to meet minimum levels.
Materials
The internal parts and covers of power-operated door closers are manufactured from various metals 
and plastic, depending on the manufacturer. The arms are manufactured from brass, bronze, stainless 
steel, or steel, depending on their application and ﬁre rated door opening requirements.
SPRING
A spring is typically found to be part of a power-operated door closer, working together with hydraulic 
valves that require a lubricant to operate. The spring is wound and has tension in the same direction as 
the door swing, which helps with eﬃciency and operation of the door.
STOPS
Some power-operated door closers have built-in stops, which hard-stop the door at a set degree of 
opening. The stop function is typically manufactured into the closer arm and the opening degree is 
typically limited and depends on the application and manufacturer’s available choices.

latches or any other surrounding conditions that might aﬀect the closing, such as gaskets around the 
perimeter of the door.
Sweep Speed
Sweep speed valves allow for adjustment to the closing speed cycle. This would be the speed once 
the door is initially released, if the device has no delayed action option or once the delayed action has 
completed, and aﬀects the closing up until about 15 degrees of the closed position.
TYPES
Floor Mounted
Depending on the manufacturer, device, and applications, ﬂoor-mounted power-operated door clos-
ers are available to hang and close the door by activating a switch. Most of these devices allow the door 
to be operated manually, similar to a mechanical door closer in case of an electrical power failure.
Overhead Concealed in the Frame
Overhead concealed in the frame power-operated door closers have been found to be the least eﬃ-
cient means of closing a door. This is typically due to the fact that the closer body is smaller than a 
surface-mounted closer body and much smaller than a ﬂoor-mounted closer body. The smaller body 
size means less room for spring and valves, which assist in the optimum functionality of the closer. With 
that said, they have improved throughout the years and are a good means to conceal the automated 
device, while maintaining the opening’s aesthetics and operation.
Surface Mounted
PARALLEL ARM
The parallel-arm surface-mounted power-operated door closer mounts on the push side of the door and 
the arm is parallel with the door, making it less susceptible to vandalism or hanging oﬀ the arm. This type 
of installation is less eﬃcient than the regular arm installation due to the conﬁguration and requires more 
tension in the spring to close eﬀectively.

REGULAR ARM
The regular arm surface-mounted power-operated door closer is always mounted on the pull side 
of the door, with the arm protruding off the face of the door and frame. Regular arm installation 
is the most efficient of the surface-mounted installations due to the configuration and force of 
the arm.
TOP JAMB
A top-jamb-mounted surface-mounted electronic door closer body is mounted on the frame instead of 
the door, where the arm protrudes oﬀ the face of the frame door similar to regular arm installation. This 
application is typically used when the closer is mounted on the door’s push side when there is a reveal. 
If the door is set in a reveal, regular arm installation conﬁguration will not allow the arm to extend 
enough to the frame face, whereas if the closer body is on the frame, the arm can extend into the reveal 
enough to reach the door face.
OPTIONS
ACTUATOR
Actuators are nothing more than large, heavy-duty pushbuttons that initiate a system or device in 
order to operate it. Basically, an actuator is a big switch that turns a device on and oﬀ. The actuator can 
be timed to open for a certain period of time, or it can be instantaneous, where it only works while one

In addition to the actuator, the electronic switch is the most common switch used to operate electronic 
and pneumatic door closers. Any other electronic switch would also operate the device if installed 
correctly and operated as intended. For example, a card reader system can be used to activate a closer 
or a motion sensor from the egress side of the door.
FLOOR MATS
Floor mats are available to act as a switch, similar to those you might be familiar with at a grocery store. 
When you step on the mat a switch is activated, which starts the operation of automatically operating 
and swinging open the door.
HIGH ENERGY
Some devices are available in high energy versions. They operate at faster speeds and might 
require a higher voltage or more amps for operation. These devices are typically used on exterior 
openings and any door that might need to open and close quickly, like an operating room door in 
a hospital.
LOW ENERGY
Most common devices are low or standard energy. They operate at standard speeds and likely require 
standard voltage and amps for operation. These devices are typically used on interior openings such as 
corridors, restrooms, or any door that might need assistance automatically.
MOTION SENSORS
Motion sensors are available as a switch, typically on the egress side of a power-operated door. When 
one moves toward the opening in order to egress, the sensor senses the movement, which starts the 
operation of automatically operating and swinging open the door.
www.it-ebooks.info

272    |   CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES
SAFETY RAILS
When high-energy devices are installed, some codes and standards require the use of safety rails on 
either side leading up to the opening. These rails act as a guide into the opening and assist with mini-
mizing any injuries from the high-powered operation of the door.
SENSORS
When high-energy devices are installed, some codes and standards require the use of sensors on 
either side of the opening to sense any presence that might interfere or injure a person in the path 
of operation. These sensors assist with minimizing any injuries from the high-powered operation of 
the door.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
High-energy power-operated door operators are installed by the provider or certiﬁed manufacturer 
installer in order to ensure optimum installation and maintenance. These installations typically oﬀer 
service contracts, which require a monthly fee and long-term commitment. This gives the owner secu-
rity knowing that someone is always on call if something is not operating properly on a highly sensitive 
and active door opening.
TIMER
Timers are typically built into power-operated door closing devices in order to set the preferred opera-
tion time for closing and holding open the door. The timers can be set to preference or to meet any 
required codes.
QUANTITIES
Powered door closers are typically installed one per door leaf, although there are devices built for a 
pair of doors.
APPLICATIONS
Concealed
Concealed power-operated door closers can be concealed either in the head of the frame, the head of 
the door, or in the ﬂoor. The ﬂoor closer is typically the most eﬃcient type of door closing device due to 
its size and fact that the ﬂoor creates the least tension for the door, allowing for a consistently eﬃcient 
door operation.
Surface Mounted
The surface-mounted power-operated door closer is more eﬃcient than any concealed device and can 
be mounted on the surface of the door and frame faces in various conﬁgurations.
INSTALLATION
Surface-mounted power-operated door closers are typically installed on the face of the door and frame. 
Although this is the most common type of installation, it is not the most eﬃcient. The ﬂoor closer is the 
ideal door hanging and controlling device.
Concealed power-operated door closers can either be installed with the closer body in the door and 
arm attached to the head of the frame, or the closer body in the head of the frame and the arm in the 
head of the door. Although the door closer disappears, and this is aesthetically pleasing, these two 
types are the least eﬀective means of closing a door due to the door closer body’s size and lack of 
ability to eﬃciently close a door for long periods of time without requiring adjustments.

274    |   CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES
Power-operated ﬂoor closers are installed underneath the ﬂoor. They can also be used to hang the 
door in addition to closing the door and are typically the most eﬃcient means of hanging a door due 
to the weight being borne on the ﬂoor instead of in tension on the frame when hung by other means 
such as hinges.
FASTENERS
Power-operated door closers are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for wood 
or metal door and frame material. Phillips and ﬂat-head screws are available, depending on the manu-
facturer’s standard, and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, security stud, 
and torx. If this type of closer is installed on a wood door, proper closer “blocking” should be speciﬁed 
so that the reinforcements are there to support this very demanding piece of hardware, which puts a lot 
of stress on the door and frame on which it is installed. If you are installing on a wood door, also consider 
through-bolt fasteners. Although not aesthetically pleasing, since they are visible from the opposite side 
of the door that the door closer is installed on, they will give the installation more stability and longevity.
Floor closer mounting screws are in shear, not tension. This means for the door to come oﬀ the frame, 
the heads of the screws would have to be sheared oﬀ horizontally and the door would have to be lifted 
oﬀ the ﬂoor portion of the ﬂoor closer arm. Floor closers are available oﬀset or center hung.

will visible through the glass.
LOCATIONS
Power-operated door closers are installed on diﬀerent points of the door, frame, and ﬂoor, depending 
on the type and application and should be installed per the manufacturer’s recommendations.
PREPARATIONS
Power-operated door closer preparations vary by type and application and are typically reinforced with 
additional materials inside the door to assist with the screw-holding force.
Screw holes are typically drilled and tapped at the factory for metal doors but not for wood doors, unless 
speciﬁcally requested. Expect a costly up-charge when requesting factory drilling and tapping. Similar 
to a standard hinge, when using heavyweight ﬂoor closers, using thicker gauge metal for the pivot arms 
means that the materials will be thicker and the door and frame preparations need to be coordinated.
OVERHEAD DOOR STOPS AND OR HOLDERS
Also Known As: Door Checks
DESCRIPTION
An overhead stop is used when a wall or ﬂoor stop installation is not feasible. If the door swings into a 
corridor with no wall around, or nowhere to put one on the ﬂoor out of the walking path, an overhead

CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES    |    275
stop can be installed. Either surface-mounted on the push side face of a door or concealed in the door 
and connected to the frame, these devices provide protection to the door and surrounding elements.
The devices typically look the same but can have either a stop-only function, where the door stops 
at a set degree, or a holder function, where the door is held open at a certain degree. Some devices 
allow the switching of functionality, but more often they are dedicated to either stopping or hold-
ing a door.
Door holders cannot be used on ﬁre rated doors as ﬁre rated doors must close automatically at the time 
of a ﬁre, and a mechanical holder would not allow that. There are certain electronic devices available to 
hold open a door while being tied into a ﬁre alarm system, which releases the device and door at the 
time of a ﬁre, protecting either side of the opening as required by code.
FIGURE 5.18 Various Overhead Stops and Holders

PROPERTIES
Overhead stops and holders are typically track-and-arm conﬁgurations that have various components 
such as an arm bracket, springs for stopping and protecting the device, and slider devices to move 
along the channel track.
Finishes
Depending on the material, overhead stops and holders are available in most architectural ﬁnishes 
to match the balance of the hardware installed on the opening such as the lockset and hinges. Metal

276    |   CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES
devices have matching metal ﬁnishes, while plastic housings might have powder-coated or painted 
ﬁnishes. Powder coating is a process of baking on the paint.
Grades
ANSI/BHMA American National Standard for Door Controls—Overhead Stops and Holders, 2010, com-
pares testing for various grades for overhead stops and holders. Those that have passed cycle tests of 
250,000 comply for grade 1, while 100,000 cycles will get them a grade 2, and 50,000 grade 3. There are 
other tests for grades, such as force tests and ﬁnish tests.
Materials
An overhead door stop and holder can be manufactured from many types of materials but is typically 
manufactured from metal, including its components such as springs. A channel is typically manufac-
tured from metal but could be manufactured from plastic or another accepted material as long as it 
passes the testing requirements.
TYPES
There are various types or conﬁgurations for overhead stops and holders, but they are all a basic design 
that attach to both the door and frame, limiting the extent of swing or holding open of the door.
Jointed Arm
A jointed arm overhead stop or holder has an additional arm and attachment that the standard over-
head stop conﬁguration doesn’t have. This allows for additional shock absorbing by adding a spring 
component at the additional joint.

Rod
A rod overhead stop or holder is a single rod that slides in and out of a guide. This does not allow for as 
much ﬂexibility or added functionality in the device, such as additional springs or friction hold-open 
options that a channel device might have.
Slide
Typically in a channel form, the slide overhead stop or holder are the most frequently used type of over-
head device. The slide arm and channel allow for the addition of some functionality such as springs to 
help absorb the pressure of the door opening and stopping at a certain degree.

OPTIONS
Cantilever
Also a jointed arm type of overhead stop and holder, the cantilever arm is shaped in an angled or 
bowed conﬁguration as compared to the conventional straight-arm conﬁguration. This might allow the 
device to extend a few extra degrees when swinging open due to the curve of the arm.
Double Acting
Concealed devices might have the ability to work with double acting doors. This door type is typically 
hung with a center-hung pivot or ﬂoor closer and can swing in either direction through the door open-
ing. Surface-mounted devices do not have this ability as they are installed on the push side face of the 
door and the conﬁguration will not allow for double acting functionality.

Friction
A friction device allows the door to “stick” at the position in which it is left. This is not to say it is “holding 
the door open” or even that it oﬀers a hold-open option, because it will move with the touch of a hand, 
but does have a bit of resistance or friction to keep the door steady.
Hold Open
Hold-open overhead stops and holders have the functionality to actually hold open a door in a certain 
position, typically predetermined by the user. This might be helpful when the door is very active but 
does not have the need to close automatically such as a ﬁre rated door does.
Selective Hold Open
Selective hold-open overhead stops and holders have the functionality to actually hold open a door 
in a certain position, but rather than doing so at a ﬁxed degree predetermined by the user, the degree 
can be selected as the user needs. In other words, the hold-open can be 85 degrees one time, and 110 
another, depending on the users’ needs. This might be helpful when the door is very active but does 
not have the need to close automatically such as a ﬁre rated door does.
Single Acting
Surface-mounted or concealed devices have the ability to work with single acting doors. This type of 
door is typically hung with hinges, continuous hinges, or oﬀset pivots or ﬂoor closers, but it can be 
hung on center-hung pivots or ﬂoor closers. This door type can only swing in one direction in the door 
opening. Surface-mounted devices do not have this ability, as they are installed on the push-side face 
of the door and the conﬁguration will not allow for double acting functionality.
Stop
An overhead stop function stops the door without having the ability to hold it open. The degree of 
opening is typically predetermined and set upon installation, and protects the door and surrounding 
elements from damage.
QUANTITIES
Overhead stops and holders are typically installed one per door leaf.
APPLICATIONS
Concealed
Concealed overhead stops and holders are available to minimize the visibility of the hardware itself. 
The device is typically installed inside of the door with the arm attached to the head of the door frame.
Surface
Due to the device conﬁguration, surface-mounted overhead stops and holders are typically installed 
on the push side face of the door with the arm attached to the head of the door frame.
INSTALLATION
Overhead door stops and holders can be installed on the face of a door and frame or concealed in 
the head of a frame and attached to a door. Some surface- and ﬂoor-mounted door closers have the 
option to have a stop built into their functionality, but they might not be as reliable as a dedicated stop. 
Depending on the frequency of door swing use, various installation types are available.

CLOSING AND CONTROL DEVICES    |    279
Fasteners
Overhead door stops and holders are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for 
wood or metal door and frame material. Phillips and ﬂat-head screws are available, depending on the 
manufacturer’s standard, and special screw heads are available as an option, including security, security 
stud, and torx. If the device is installed on a wood door, proper closer “blocking” should be speciﬁed so 
that the reinforcements are there to support this very demanding piece of hardware, which puts a lot of 
stress on the door and frame upon which it is installed. If you are installing on a wood door, also consider 
through-bolt fasteners. Although not aesthetically pleasing, since they are visible from the opposite side 
of the door that the door closer is installed on, they will give the installation more stability and longevity.
It is recommended that the proper fasteners be speciﬁed for eﬃcient installation rather than relying on 
a box of self-tapping screws, which might be more convenient for the installer.
Locations
Overhead door stops and holders should be installed at locations as recommended by industry stan-
dards and codes, which are typically measured from the ﬁnished ﬂoor. Regardless of the door and 
frame type, whether considered they are standard or custom metal, wood, or aluminum, standards 
recommend starting the ﬁrst hinge from the ﬁnished ﬂoor.
Preparations
Overhead door stops and holder preparations vary, depending on the type. Surface-mounted devices 
are typically face-applied in the ﬁeld while concealed overhead stops are typically machined at the 
factory, including the drilling and tapping of screw holes. Surface-mounted overhead devices vary by 
manufacturer, with some requiring frame preparation.

Protective Plates 
and Trim
Next in the sequence are protective plates. Protective plates do just what they say, protect the door as 
a layer installed on the surface of the door. Some doors can be very expensive to replace, so rather than 
damaging, dinging, denting, scratching, or ruining the surface of a door itself, the protection plate can 
take the abuse. A protection plate is also typically less expensive to replace than an entire door, so if the 
surface of the plate gets very damaged, it can be replaced at less cost.
ARMOR PLATES
Also Known As: Armor Protective Plate, Armor Protection Plate, Protection Plate, Protective Plate
DESCRIPTION
Armor plates are typically installed on the bottom half of doors that require protection from an object 
moving through the door opening that might cause damage to the door’s surface. Protection plates 
have diﬀerent names depending on their sizes, and armor plates are typically any size above 12 inches 
and up to 48 inches in height.
PROPERTIES
Finishes
Armor plates are typically available in a limited number of architectural ﬁnishes and should comply 
with the current version of ANSI/BHMA A156.18 American National Standard for Materials and Finishes.
Grades
Armor plates are not categorized in grades but should comply with standards in Workmanship as 
described for Product Category J100 in the current version of ANSI/BHMA A156.6 American National 
Standard for Architectural Door Trim.
Armor plates are available in diﬀerent duties, which depend on the thickness and type of material used.

Laminate
Standard-duty plastic armor plates are manufactured from a minimum 1/8-inch-thick material 
according to ANSI/BHMA A156.6 American National Standard for Architectural Door Trim, 2005.
Materials
Armor plates can be manufactured from aluminum, brass, plastic, or stainless steel. Armor plates 
should comply with Materials for Product Category J100 as described in the current version of ANSI/
BHMA A156.6 American National Standard for Architectural Door Trim.
TYPES
Armor plates come in one type, which can be manufactured from diﬀerent materials, in various sizes, 
using diﬀerent mounting methods. The current version of ANSI/BHMA A156.6 American National Stan-
dard for Architectural Door Trim describes armor plates as Product Category J100.
Metal
A metal armor plate is categorized as J101 in ANSI/BHMA A156.6 American National Standard for Archi-
tectural Door Trim, 2005.
A plastic armor plate is categorized as J105 in ANSI/BHMA A156.6 American National Standard for Archi-
tectural Door Trim, 2005.
SIZES
Height and Width
Although the sizes may vary depending on interpretation, armor plates are typically speciﬁed by height 
and width and are installed 1 1/2 inches less than the door width on the pull side of the door and 2 
inches less than the door width on the push side of the door. These dimensions are for doors installed in 
standard door frames that have standard 5/8-inch stops projecting into the door opening clear width. 
The deduction of 2 inches on the push side is so the plate does not bind with the frame stops and the 
deduction of 1 1/2 inches on the pull side is so the fasteners have suﬃcient space to secure to.

286    |    PROTECTIVE PLATES AND TRIM
Armor plates are typically any height over 12 inches, which is the typical maximum height of a kickplate, 
and 48 inches, which is above any standard-height cart or object that might move through the door 
opening.
Thickness
Standard armor plates are available in various thicknesses depending on the intended use and frequency.
OPTIONS
Anti-Microbial Coating
Armor plates are available with an optional anti-microbial coating. The coating is a silver ion–based 
clear coating that helps stop the spread of bacteria. Although there are silver ions, they are not visible 
to the eye and a brass or bronze ﬁnish shows its true color through the coating. Silver has been used 
throughout history to help reduce the spread of bacteria and infection: Why not put it on doors and 
hardware that is touched over and over again by numerous people in a day?
Countersunk Holes
Armor plates might not be manufactured standard with countersunk holes, and this should be speciﬁed 
if desired. If the holes are not countersunk, the head of the screws will protrude oﬀ the face of the door, 
whereas countersunk holes will allow the head of the screws to install ﬂush with the face of the armor plate.
Cutouts
Some doors might have louvers, a lockset, or other conﬂicting hardware where an armor plate might 
be installed. Therefore, manufacturers will provide special cutouts, if ordered properly. Otherwise, ﬁeld 
cutting might not give the accuracy required for the conﬂicting hardware devices to operate properly 
or at all.
Edges
BEVELED
Armor plates have the option for beveled edges. In addition to being an aesthetic preference, beveled 
edges are softened at the end to a 45-degree angle back to the door instead of having a 90-degree 
square edge. Although four beveled edges are available as an option, three beveled edges are also 
available for those who are not particular about the bottom edge. The bottom edge of an armor plate is 
typically ﬂush with the bottom of the door and is beveled, leaving it at a square edged, 90-degree angle.
SQUARE
Armor plates might have the option for all four square edges. As described above, three beveled edges 
are an option, leaving at least one, the bottom edge of the armor plate, a square edged. In addition to 
being an aesthetic preference, square edges are a 90-degree cut back to the door. Caution should be 
used, however, as the edges can be sharp.
Engraving
Manufacturers have the ability to engrave armor plates. Engraving requests might include a room 
number in an oﬃce, educational, or healthcare facility, or possibly an exit sign with photoluminescent 
properties.
Labeling
Until a change in codes occurred, which forced a change in manufacturing and testing requirements, 
protection plates higher than 16 inches from the bottom edge of the door could not be installed on 
www.it-ebooks.info

PROTECTIVE PLATES AND TRIM    |    287
ﬁre rated doors. Now, some manufacturers have tested their plates for installation on ﬁre-rated doors 
no matter what the height of the plate or ﬁre label of the door.
Shapes
A typical armor plate is square with squared corners, but some manufacturers oﬀer shaped protection 
plates, which allow for curves and designs to be incorporated into the shape.
QUANTITIES
Armor plates are furnished in single quantities and should be speciﬁed one for each door surface 
required.
APPLICATIONS
Surface Mounted
Armor plates are surface-mounted, typically on the push side face of a door.
Angle Plate
BOTTOM
An angle plate also covers one or two sides of the door in addition to the face of the door.
ONE SIDED
A one-sided angle plate wraps around one side edge of the door in addition to the face of the door.
TWO SIDED
A two-sided angle plate wraps around both side edges of the door in addition to the face of the door.
INSTALLATION
Armor plates are typically installed on the push side face of a door.
Fasteners
Armor plates are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for installation on wood or 
metal door materials. An armor plate typically has countersunk screw holes around the perimeter, which 
should comply with ANSI/BHMA A156.6 American National Standard for Architectural Door Trim, 2005.
COUNTERSUNK
Armor plates might not be manufactured standard with countersunk holes and this should be speciﬁed 
if desired. If the holes are not countersunk, the head of the screws will protrude oﬀ the face of the door, 
whereas countersunk holes will allow the head of the screws to install ﬂush with the face of the armor plate.
SELFADHESIVE
Armor plates are available with a self-adhesive double-faced tape option in lieu of screw fasteners. 
If self-adhesive tape is used, the armor plate typically will not have any screw holes as with a typical 
installation.
SURFACE MOUNTED
Armor plates might not be manufactured standard with countersunk holes. The screws would be installed 
surface-mounted on the plate with the head of the screws protruding oﬀ the face of the armor plate.
Locations
Armor plates should be installed on the bottom half of the push side of a door surface to protect the 
door from objects moving through the door opening that might cause damage to the door surface.

TYPES
Kickplates have one type, which can be manufactured from diﬀerent materials, in various sizes, using 
diﬀerent mounting methods. The current version of ANSI/BHMA A156.6 American National Standard for 
Architectural Door Trim describes armor plates as Product Category J100.
Metal
A metal kickplate is categorized as J102 in ANSI/BHMA A156.6 American National Standard for 
Architectural Door Trim, 2005.
Plastic
A plastic kickplate is categorized as J106 in ANSI/BHMA A156.6 American National Standard for 
Architectural Door Trim, 2005.
SIZES
Height and Width
Kickplates are typically speciﬁed in height by width and are installed 1 1/2 inches less than the door 
width on the pull side of the door and 2 inches less than the door width on the push side of the door. 
These dimensions are for doors installed in standard door frames that have standard 5/8-inch stops 
projecting into the door opening clear width. The deduction of 2 inches on the push side is so the plate 
does not bind with the frame stops and the deduction of 1 1/2 inches on the pull side is so the fasteners 
have suﬃcient space to secure to.
Although the sizes may vary depending on interpretation, kickplates are typically any height over 6 
inches, which is the typical maximum height of a mop plate, and 12 inches.
Thickness
Standard kickplates are available in various thicknesses depending on the intended use and 
frequency.
OPTIONS
Anti-Microbial Coating
Kickplates are available with an optional anti-microbial coating. The coating is a silver ion–based clear 
coating that helps stop the spread of bacteria. Although there are silver ions, they are not visible to 
the eye and a brass or bronze ﬁnish shows its true color through the coating. Silver has been used 
throughout history to help reduce the spread of bacteria and infection: Why not put it on doors and 
hardware that is touched over and over again by numerous diﬀerent people in a day?
Countersunk Holes
Kickplates might not be manufactured standard with countersunk holes and this should be speciﬁed if 
desired. If the holes are not countersunk, the head of the screws will protrude oﬀ the face of the door, 
whereas countersunk holes will allow the head of the screws to install ﬂush with the face of the armor 
plate.
Cutouts
Some doors might have louvers or other conﬂicting hardware where a kickplate might be installed. 
Therefore, manufacturers will make special cutouts, if ordered properly. If not, ﬁeld cutting might not 
give the accuracy required for the conﬂicting hardware devices to operate properly or at all.

Edges
BEVELED
Kickplates have the option for beveled edges. In addition to being an aesthetic preference, beveled 
edges are softened at the end to a 45-degree angle back to the door instead of having a 90-degree 
square edge. Although four beveled edges are available as an option, three beveled edges are also 
available for those who are not particular about the bottom edge. The bottom edge of a kickplate is typ-
ically ﬂush with the bottom of the door and is beveled, leaving it at a square-edged, 90-degree angle.
SQUARE
Kickplates might have the option for four square edges. As described above, three beveled edges are 
an option, leaving at least one, the bottom edge of the armor plate, square edged. In addition to being 
an aesthetic preference, square edges are a 90-degree cut back to the door. Caution should be used, 
however, as the edges can be sharp.
Engraving
Manufacturers have the ability to engrave kickplates. Engraving requests might be a room number in 
an oﬃce, educational, or healthcare facility, or possibly an exit sign with photoluminescent properties.
Labeling
Until a change in codes, which forced a change in manufacturing and testing requirements, protection 
plates higher than 16 inches from the bottom edge of the door could not be installed on ﬁre rated 
doors. Now, some manufacturers have tested their plates, so they can be installed on ﬁre rated doors 
no matter what the height of the plate or ﬁre label of the door.
Shapes
A typical kickplate is rectangular with square corners, but some manufacturers oﬀer shaped protection 
plates, which allow for curves and designs to be incorporated into the shape.
QUANTITIES
Kickplates are furnished in single quantities and should be speciﬁed one for each door surface required.
APPLICATIONS
Surface Mounted
Kickplates are surface-mounted, typically on the push side face of a door.

Stops and Holders
If ﬂoor or door closers with overhead stops were not applied, the next step in the sequence is to apply 
stops and holders. Although we might have protected the door with protective plates and trim, that is 
not enough. The surrounding elements must also be accounted for, and we can protect the door and 
frame with ﬂoor or wall stops, ﬂoor or wall holders, and electromagnetic door holders.
DOOR HOLDERS
Also Known As: Door Stop, Hold Open
DESCRIPTION
Door holders can be used when a wall or ﬂoor stop is not applicable and the entire hold-open device 
operation needs to be on the door.
PROPERTIES
Finishes
Door holders are typically available in a limited number of architectural ﬁnishes and should comply 
with the current version ANSI/BHMA A156.18 American National Standard for Materials and Finishes.
Grades
Door holder stops are categorized by grades as described in the standards of Tests for Door Stops in 
the current version of ANSI/BHMA A156.16 American National Standard for Auxiliary Hardware. These 
standards describe testing in cycles, aging, bumper retention, and impact.

Materials
Door holders can be manufactured with an aluminum, brass, bronze, stainless steel, or steel housing 
that is mounted to the wall with a rubber insert that is impacted by the door or door hardware. Door 
bumpers should comply with the Resilient Material Retention Test as described in the current version 
of ANSI/BHMA A156.16 American National Standard for Auxiliary Hardware.
TYPES
Door bumpers come in various types, which can be manufactured from diﬀerent materials, in various 
sizes, and using various mounting methods. The current version of ANSI/BHMA A156.16 American 
National Standard for Auxiliary Hardware describes ﬂoor stops as auxiliary hardware.
Angle Stop
An angle stop is not truly a door holder, or even mounted on the door. An angle stop is installed at 
the head of a cased opening or framed opening to stop the door in the closed position. Because the 
opening has no stop as with a conventional door frame, a hardware device is required in order to stop 
the door in the center of the frame so that it can be secured. Another reason to stop the door is so that 
the door, frame, hardware, and surrounding elements do not get damaged due to improper use from 
the intended function of the opening.
Foot Bolt
A foot bolt-type door holder is installed at the latching end of the bottom of the door. The bolt is 
thrown into a strike on the ﬂoor and engaged when depressed by a foot. The device holds the door 
open until manually released.

FIGURE 7.2 Roller Bumper Door Stop
(Source: Courtesy of Rockwood® Manufacturing Company)
Lever
Also known as a kick down stop, a lever door holder is installed at the latching end of the bottom of 
the door and has a rubber bumper at the bottom end. The lever is thrown with the foot and the rubber 
bumper creates pressure against the ground, holding the door in the open position. The door is held 
open until the lever is ﬂipped up manually.
Plunger
A plunger door holder is installed at the latching end of the bottom of the door and has a rubber 
bumper at the bottom end. The plunger is thrown with the foot and the rubber bumper creates 
pressure against the ground, holding the door in the open position. The door is held open until the 
plunger is released manually.

STOPS AND HOLDERS    |    313
Roller Bumper
This is not truly a door holder, but when mounted on the door, a roller bumper stops a door from 
hitting another door directly behind it, such as an apartment entrance door back to back to a closet 
door in the entranceway. Roller bumpers have two options, straight and oﬀset. The straight option 
comes in various lengths to accommodate shorter and longer distances between doors.
SIZES
Door holders are available in various sizes and lengths to suit all size doors and diﬀerent frequencies 
of use.
OPTIONS
There are no options to door holders other than the various options in design, ﬁnish, and installation.
QUANTITIES
Door holders are furnished in single quantities and should be speciﬁed one for each door required.
APPLICATIONS
Surface Mounted
Depending on the type, door holders may be surface-mounted on the face of the door. Some have 
strikes that are installed on the ﬂoor.

INSTALLATION
Door holders are typically installed on the ﬂoor. Some have strikes that are installed on the ﬂoor.
Fasteners
Door holders are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for installation on wood 
or metal.
Locations
Door holders should be installed per the manufacturer’s recommendations and where they are 
intended to stop the door. A door holder is installed at the locking edge on the face of the door.
Preparations
Door holder preparations typically take place in the ﬁeld by the installer, including the drilling and 
tapping of screw holes.
ELECTROMAGNETIC DOOR HOLDERS
Also Known As: Electromagnetic Hold-Open, Magnetic Holder
DESCRIPTION
Electromagnetic door holders can be used when a door’s function requires it to be held open but close 
at the time of a ﬁre. This application typically is used on a ﬁre rated door that has a function requiring 
it to be held open. The device is mounted on the wall or ﬂoor and an armature is mounted at the same 
location on the door with various holding forces available. The device is wired into the ﬁre alarm system 
and when the ﬁre alarm is triggered, the power is cut to the device, and the door releases so that it can 
close and latch as required by codes.
PROPERTIES
Electric
Electromagnetic door holders have fail-safe operation and are available for multiple power sources, in 
various voltages and currents.
FAIL SAFE
Fail-safe strikes are available to tie into a ﬁre alarm system. This trim only locks when power is applied 
to the opening and unlocks when power is released. This function uses power all of the time but is 
necessary to meet the codes in certain situations, if electriﬁcation is necessary at the opening. The 
devices are manufactured diﬀerently, depending on the manufacturer and options, and can be 
operated by a solenoid or a motorized mechanism, which would retract and throw the bolt accordingly, 
or simply allow the lever or knob to be rotated to retract the latch manually.
VOLTAGE AND CURRENT
Voltage and current requirements diﬀer by manufacturer and device. Available with alternating or direct 
current, and as various voltages, such as 12 VAC or DC and 24 VAC and DC, they must be coordinated 
properly in order to have proper operation of electrical devices.
Alternating Current
Alternating current (AC) is the typical power used in our homes and standard outlets. The current is 
sent to and from the device, alternating in direction. If you have ever noticed a buzzing sound at a door 
www.it-ebooks.info

STOPS AND HOLDERS    |    315
with an electric strike when power is sent to it, you are likely hearing the alternating current running 
through the device.
Direct Current
Direct current (DC) can eliminate the buzzing sound, and is typically a one-way current similar to that 
of a battery and does not create the buzzing sound.
Finishes
Door holders are typically available in a limited number of sprayed architectural ﬁnishes, which are 
applied to the device covers. Finishes should comply with the current version of ANSI/BHMA A156.18 
American National Standard for Materials and Finishes.
Grades
Electromagnetic door holders are not categorized by grades and should meet the standards of the 
current version of ANSI/BHMA A156.15 American National Standard for Release Devices—Closer Holder, 
Electromagnetic and Electromechanical.
Materials
In addition to the internal parts of an electromagnetic door holder, the bodies and covers can be 
manufactured with a metal or plastic material.
TYPES
Electromagnetic door holders come in various types for various hold-open applications as described 
in the current version of ANSI/BHMA A156.15 American National Standard for Release Devices—Closer 
Holder, Electromagnetic and Electromechanical. Holding forces for standard devices can range from 40 
to 55 pounds, while a heavy-duty holding force can hold around 300 pounds.
Floor Mounted
SINGLE
A single ﬂoor-mounted electromagnetic door holder rests on the ﬂoor and the wiring goes through the 
ﬂoor, where the existing wiring can reach it. The armature is installed on the swinging door at the same 
location so that the pieces can meet and hold open the door.
DOUBLE
A double ﬂoor-mounted electromagnetic door holder rests on the ﬂoor and the wiring goes through 
the ﬂoor, where the existing wiring can reach it. It is typically used for a bank of pairs of doors where 
the doors are back to back in the open position and can utilize the same device, saving wiring and 
installation time. The armatures are installed on the swinging doors at the same locations so that they 
can meet and hold open the doors.

SIZES
Electromagnetic door holders are available in various sizes to suit diﬀerent size doors and frequencies 
of use.
OPTIONS
Armature Bend
This armature option allows the armature to bend so that it has more ﬂexibility in matching up with 
the device.
Armature Extension
The armature installed on the door has the option to be extended, depending on the distance between 
the door and the wall. If a door does not reach a wall due to an obstruction, the extension will help the 
armature reach the device installed on the wall.
Swivel Armature
This option adds a swivel to the armature so that it has more ﬂexibility in matching up with the device.
Wall Mounted
STANDARD DUTY
A wall-mounted standard electromagnetic door holder is mounted to the wall where the wiring can 
reach it. The armature is installed on the door at the same location of the swinging door so that the 
pieces can meet and hold open the door.
HEAVY DUTY
A heavy-duty wall-mounted electromagnetic door holder is mounted to the wall where the wiring can 
reach it. The armature has a hook that hooks into a recess in the device’s body that is electromagnetically 
held in place. The hook and device are installed on the wall and door at the same location so that they 
can meet and hold open the door. This device can be installed on both sliding and swinging doors.

Automatic Hold-Open
An automatic hold-open device has a hold-open mechanism built into the device that mounts to the 
ﬂoor. When engaged with the holding device on the wall, the device automatically holds the door 
against the holding device until pushed or pulled, which releases the device.
Manual Hold-Open
A manual hold-open is a door stop with bumper that mounts to the ﬂoor with a hook eye built into it. 
The hold-open hook is installed on the door and has to be manually hooked to the holding device on 
the ﬂoor. The holding device holds the door until unhooked and released manually.

Semi-Automatic Hold-Open
A semi-automatic hold-open is a device that mounts to the ﬂoor and has a hold-open mechanism built 
into it. When the holding device hook attached to the door is lowered manually, it can hold the door 
against open until manually released.
Stop
BUMPER
Some manufacturers have created their own uniquely designed ﬂoor stops, which are more decorative 
than standard ﬂoor stops. Others are manufactured as heavy duty, typically for exterior applications.
DOME
A dome stop is in the shape of a half of a dome with a metal housing and rubber bumper at the ﬂat end 
in the middle of the stop. Dome stops are available in diﬀerent heights and should be coordinated with 
the door undercut.
PENCIL
A pencil stop is a skinny post that is mounted to the ﬂoor and has a 90-degree angle with a rubber 
bumper at the end. The stem reaches out and hits the door before the door hits up against a wall or 
surrounding conditions.
STEM
A stem stop is a post, thicker than a pencil stop post that mounts to the ﬂoor and has a 90-degree 
angle with a rubber bumper at the end. The stem reaches out and hits the door before the door hits up 
against a wall or surrounding conditions.

QUANTITIES
Wall stops are furnished in single quantities and should be speciﬁed one for each door required.
APPLICATIONS
Surface Mounted
Depending on the type, ﬂoor stops are surface-mounted on the ﬂoor, face of the door, or both.
INSTALLATION
Depending on the type, ﬂoor stops are typically installed on the ﬂoor, face of the door, or both. Floor 
stops would be the second most preferred stopping method to a wall stop. Floor stops might contribute 
to a tripping hazard if not installed on the ﬂoor in the proper location or with the optimal application. 
Cleaning a wall stop is also easier than an overhead or ﬂoor stop, especially in sanitary environments 
such as a hospital.
Fasteners
Floor stops are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for installation on wood, 
metal, or other materials such as drywall or concrete.
Locations
Floor stops should be installed per the manufacturer’s recommendations and where it is intended to 
stop the door. A ﬂoor stop would be installed at the locking edge of the door as close to the wall as 
possible to avoid a tripping hazard. The stop would be placed so that the paddle arm, push pull, exit 
device trim, lockset lever handle, or any other operating device would be protected by the door hitting 
the stop before any other operating hardware.
Preparations
Floor stop preparations take place in the ﬁeld by the installer, including the drilling and tapping of 
screw holes.
WALL STOPS
DESCRIPTION
Wall stops should be the ﬁrst choice, especially in healthcare facilities, as the bacteria and dirt 
are much easier to clean at a standing height surface than on the ﬂoor or overhead. They can be 
cleaned within arm’s length—they can easily be sprayed with a cleaning agent and wiped clean 
without having to bend down or use a mop, which can create a buildup of dirt and bacteria over 
time.
PROPERTIES
Finishes
Wall stops are typically available in a limited number of architectural finishes and should comply 
with the current version of ANSI/BHMA A156.18 American National Standard for Materials and 
Finishes.

Grades
Wall stops are categorized by grades as described in the standards of Tests for Door Stops in the current 
version of ANSI/BHMA A156.16 American National Standard for Auxiliary Hardware. These standards 
describe testing in cycles, aging, bumper retention, and impact.
Materials
Wall stops can be manufactured with an aluminum, brass, bronze, stainless steel, or steel housing that 
gets mounted to the wall with a rubber insert that is impacted by the door or door hardware. Wall stops 
should comply with the Resilient Material Retention Test as described in the current version of ANSI/
BHMA A156.16 American National Standard for Auxiliary Hardware.
TYPES
Wall stops have various types, which can be manufactured from diﬀerent materials, in various sizes, 
and using diﬀerent mounting methods. The current version of ANSI/BHMA A156.16 American National 
Standard for Auxiliary Hardware describes wall stops as auxiliary hardware.
Automatic Hold-Open
An automatic hold-open device has a hold-open mechanism built into the device that protrudes oﬀ 
the face of the door. When engaged with the holding device on the wall, the hold-open mechanism 
automatically holds the door against the holding device until it is pushed or pulled, which releases the 
device.
Manual Hold-Open
A manual hold-open is a door stop with bumper that protrudes oﬀ of the face of the door with a hook 
eye built into it. The hold-open hook is installed on the wall and has to be manually hooked to the 
holding device on the wall. The holding device holds the door until unhooked and released manually.
Semi-Automatic Hold-Open
A semi-automatic hold-open is a device that protrudes oﬀ of the face of the door that has a hold-open 
mechanism built into it. When the holding device hook attached to the wall is lowered manually, it can 
hold the door open until it is manually released.
Stop
BUMPER
Concave
Concave wall bumpers can be manufactured with or without a metal housing and with or without 
visible screws. Regardless of the housing, there is a rubber bumper that is just a rim with a hollowed-
out center. This conﬁguration is typically speciﬁed when installing with a bored or cylindrical 
locket that has a pushbutton feature on the inside lever. Without a hollowed-out center, every time 
the lever with the pushbutton hits the stop, the pushbutton would depress and lock the lockset 
unintentionally.
Convex
Convex wall bumpers can be manufactured with or without a metal housing and with or without 
visible screws. Regardless of the housing, there is a solid rubber bumper. This conﬁguration is typically 
www.it-ebooks.info

324    |   STOPS AND HOLDERS
speciﬁed when one is installing it with a bored or cylindrical locket that does not have a pushbutton 
feature on the inside lever. Without a pushbutton feature, there is no concern about the pushbutton 
being depressed and locking the lockset unintentionally.
FLEXIBLE STEM
Flexible stem stops are similar to stem stops where a skinny post protrudes oﬀ of the face of the door 
with a rubber bumper at the end, except the skinny post is a spring and can ﬂex in various directions. 
The stem is long enough to clear any levers, pulls, or operating hardware that might be damaged or 
damage the surrounding elements.
HINGE PIN
Hinge pin stops, also known as adjustable pin stops, attach to hinge pins and have a bumper on both 
sides to limit the door swing and protect the door and wall or frame side from getting hit and causing 
damage.
PENCIL
A pencil stop is a skinny post that protrudes oﬀ of the face of the door with a rubber bumper at the end. 
The stem is long enough to clear any levers, pulls, or operating hardware that might get damaged or 
damage the surrounding elements.
STEM
A stem stop is a post, thicker than a pencil stop post that protrudes oﬀ of the face of the door with a

APPLICATIONS
Surface Mounted
Depending on the type, wall stops are surface-mounted on the wall, face of the door, or both.
INSTALLATION
Wall stops typically are installed on the wall, face of the door, or both. They are the preferred stopping 
method because they do not pose a tripping hazard if installed on the ﬂoor instead. Cleaning a wall stop 
is also easier than doing so for an overhead or ﬂoor stop, especially in environments that must be kept 
sanitary such as a hospital.

Next in the sequence we list accessories that include astragals, thresholds, weatherstripping, and gas-
keting. We use these hardware types to seal the clearances around the perimeter of an opening. This 
can help with a number of issues including keeping sound, light, and smoke either in or out, maintain-
ing energy eﬃciency, and helping to contain the inside weather and conditions inside the structure and 
the outside weather and conditions outside. Although most weatherstripping and gaskets are surface 
mounted or recessed installed, some door frame manufacturers oﬀer their frames with gaskets already 
installed in kerfs where the rabbet meets the stop of the frame.
ASTRAGALS
Also Known As: Meeting Stile Seals, Gaskets, Weatherstripping
DESCRIPTION
An astragal is installed to cover or ﬁll the clearance in between a pair of doors. Astragals are available 
in diﬀerent conﬁgurations and are installed on the surface, recessed, or wrapped around the edge of 
a door in one piece or two. Astragals are recommended to be installed the entire height of a door and 
might be required by certain codes.
PROPERTIES
Finishes
Astragals are typically available in a limited number of architectural ﬁnishes and should comply with 
ANSI/BHMA A156.18 American National Standard for Materials and Finishes, 2012. Although some 
manufacturers might oﬀer other options, the most typical astragal ﬁnishes available are anodized alu-
minum, bronze, dark bronze gold, and painted ﬁnishes. Astragals with gasket materials are typically 
available in brown, black, gray, tan, and white and can be manufactured from foam, neoprene, santo-
prene, silicone, brush, and other materials.

Grades
Astragals are not categorized by grades and should comply with Test Requirements as described in 
ANSI/BHMA A156.21 American National Standard for Thresholds, 2009. These standards describe load 
and material.
Materials
Astragals can be manufactured with aluminum, brass, bronze, rubber, stainless steel, steel, wood, or 
other suitable material. Some thresholds have weatherstripping incorporated into the design, which 
can be a neoprene, brush, rubber, silicone, or santoprene (sustainable type) material.
TYPES
Astragals are available in various types, which can be manufactured from diﬀerent materials, in a vari-
ety of sizes, using diﬀerent mounting methods. ANSI/BHMA A156.22 American National Standard for 
Door Gasketing and Edge Seal Systems, 2005 describes the basic types.
Split
A split astragal is manufactured with two parts. One part is installed on each door leaf, which meets 
when the doors are in the closed position to create a seal for the center space between a pair of doors. 
The two parts can be of the same gasket material or one part a gasket with the other a metal or rubber 
material for the gasket to rest up against.
Overlapping
An overlapping astragal is installed on one door leaf of a pair of doors. The astragal overlaps and rests 
on the face of the second door leaf when the doors are in the closed position. This creates a seal for 
the center space between a pair of doors. Doors with overlapping astragals have to close in a certain 
order, one door before the other. If the door with the overlapping astragal closes ﬁrst, the door with-
out the astragal will not be able to pass the door with the astragal in order to get to a fully closed posi-
tion, as the edge of the door will get caught on the edge of the astragal. A coordinator can be used 
to coordinate the proper closing sequence of a pair of doors to ensure proper closing and latching as 
necessary.
FLAT
A ﬂat astragal is a ﬂat plate that rests on the face of a door at the edge and hangs oﬀ the edge so that it 
can rest up against the other door when in the closed position.

ACCESSORIES    |    331
TEE
Tee astragals are in the shape of a tee with the vertical portion installed against the edge of a door while 
the horizontal portion is installed on the face of the door edge.
Security
Security astragals are installed on the face of one leaf of a pair of doors while the other end rests on the 
face of the other leaf. There is an additional bracket, sometimes referred to as a cam, which is installed 
at the head to keep the astragal ﬂush against the other door. The bracket is rigid and also assists the 
astragal with closing and resting against the door leaf properly.
SIZES
Astragals are available in various widths and are typically the same full height as the door. A ﬂat astragal 
can be between 1 and 2 inches across, while a meeting stile astragal can be 1/2-inch wide overall. No 
matter the width, the edge portion always hangs oﬀ and meets with the other half or other door in the 
middle or resting on the face.
OPTIONS
Adjustable
Some astragals are available as adjustable where the gasket can be adjusted horizontally to accommo-
date for uneven gaps in between the two doors. This could be for a not-so-perfect installation or possi-
bly for variations in pressurization or surrounding conditions that might prohibit the door from closing 
properly. The opposite side of the astragal where it meets the other door typically has screws along 
the height to make the slight adjustments as necessary. If the astragal is not adjustable and is installed 
incorrectly or unevenly, the entire astragal would have to be reinstalled in lieu of trying to adjust it ﬁrst.
Cover
Snap cover versions are available to hide the surface-mounted screw fasteners of surface-mounted 
astragals. These astragals tend to be thicker and protrude oﬀ of the face of the door more than one 
without a cover due to the depth required to recess and cover the screw heads.
Cutout
Astragals might have the option to have cutouts made for any conﬂicting hardware such as a strike 
plate or faceplate of a deadlock or lockset.

Fascia
Metal overlapping astragals are available with a wood fascia to cover the metal material with wood. 
This is typically an aesthetic decision and does not aﬀect the operation of the astragal.
Locking
AUTOMATIC
Automatic locking astragals have spring bolts installed at the head of foot of the astragal. When 
installed, typically on the edge of an inactive leaf of a pair of doors, it acts as the ﬂushbolt would in a 
pair of doors application. To retract the spring bolts, pull down or pull up on the trigger at the edge of 
the astragal and door; when released they automatically project.
MANUAL
Manual locking astragals have spring bolts installed at the head of foot of the astragal. When installed, 
typically on the edge of an inactive leaf of a pair of doors, the astragal acts as the ﬂushbolt would in a 
pair of doors application. To project or retract the slide bolts, pull down or pull up on the slide mecha-
nism at the edge of the astragal and door.
Seal
Overlapping astragals are available with or without diﬀerent seal materials such as silicone, rubber, 
neoprene, santoprene, vinyl, and brush. If there is no gasket, the metal or material of the astragal rests 
directly on the surface of the door; if it has a gasket, it is in between the astragal and door and creates 
an additional seal along the entire height of the door.
Thermal Break
Also known as “broken,” a thermal break surface is an astragal used to assist with the energy eﬃciency 
of the gap between a pair of doors. The astragal is manufactured with a three-piece surface, typically 
manufactured from metal on both sides and a separating material in the middle, which can be PVC, 
wood, rubber, or other suitable material to prohibit the temperature from traveling from one side of 
the astragal and doorway to the other.
QUANTITIES
Astragals are furnished in single quantities and should be speciﬁed one for each door required. This 
includes split astragal sets that might require multiple pieces to make the astragal whole.
APPLICATIONS
Recessed
Also known as meeting stile gaskets, astragals can be installed recessed into the edge of one or both 
doors of a pair, depending on the type.
Surface Mounted
Astragals can be surface-mounted on the face at the stile edge of one or both doors of a pair depend-
ing on the type.
INSTALLATION
Astragals are typically installed the full height vertically at the meeting stile center edges of a pair of 
doors.

ACCESSORIES    |    333
Fasteners
Astragals are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for installation on various door 
materials. Heavy-duty and security fasteners are available if required.
Locations
Astragals should be installed per the manufacturer’s recommendations at the full height vertically at 
the meeting stile center edges of a pair of doors.
Preparations
Surface-mounted astragal preparations take place in the ﬁeld by the installer, including the drilling and 
tapping of screw holes. Recessed astragal preparations take place at the factory, depending on the 
door material and what is available from the manufacturer.
THRESHOLD
Also Known As: Saddle
DESCRIPTION
A threshold is recommended to be installed to ﬁt the entire jamb depth and width of a sill of a door 
opening. A threshold might be required for a number of reasons. Typically used between two diﬀerent 
ﬂoor types, a threshold might be required for a transition between one side of a door with carpet and 
the other with tile. This would create a smooth transition where the two diﬀerent ﬂoor types might cre-
ate a more diﬃcult one or tripping hazard.
Another reason for a threshold might be the adopted ﬁre codes, some of which state that any combus-
tible ﬂooring, such as carpet, that goes underneath a doorway must have a threshold installed over it. 
This would help prevent the ﬁre from spreading underneath the door from one room to another.

PROPERTIES
Finishes
Thresholds are typically available in a limited number of architectural ﬁnishes and should comply 
with ANSI/BHMA A156.18 American National Standard for Materials and Finishes, 2012. Although some 
manufacturers might oﬀer other options, the most typical threshold ﬁnishes available are aluminum, 
bronze, dark bronze, anodized aluminum, and stainless steel.
Grades
Thresholds are not categorized by grades and should comply with Test Requirements as described in 
ANSI/BHMA A156.21 American National Standard for Thresholds, 2009. These standards describe load 
and material.
Materials
Thresholds can be manufactured with aluminum, brass, bronze, rubber, stainless steel, steel, wood, or 
other suitable material. Some thresholds have weatherstripping incorporated into the design, which 
can be a neoprene, brush, rubber, silicone, or santoprene (sustainable type) material.
Surfaces
BROKEN
Also known as a thermal break, a broken surface is a threshold used to assist with the energy eﬃciency 
of the bottom of a door opening. The threshold is manufactured with a three-piece surface made up 
of metal on both sides and a separating material in the middle that can be PVC, wood, rubber, or other 
suitable material to prohibit the temperature from traveling from one side of the threshold and door-
way to the other.

FLUTED
A ﬂuted surface is a surface that has grooves horizontally across the threshold and along the entire 
width. The ﬂuted surface can assist with traction or simply be an aesthetic preference.
SMOOTH
A smooth surface is ﬂat and smooth horizontally across the entire threshold and along the entire width. 
The smooth surface can be slippery if a substance is left behind from the weather or someone’s shoe 
stepping on it.

TYPES
Thresholds are available in various types, which can be manufactured from diﬀerent materials, in 
various sizes, using diﬀerent mounting methods. ANSI/BHMA A156.21 American National Standard for 
Thresholds, 2009 describes the standards types of thresholds.
Adjustable
An adjustable threshold comes in parts, which are pieced together to make the whole threshold. Parts 
can include supporting ends, centerpieces, and thermal break material.
FIGURE 8.9 Heavy-Duty Flat Surface Threshold

FIGURE 8.10 Adjustable Threshold
(Source: Courtesy of Pemko Manufacturing Company)
Bulkhead
Typically manufactured from a heavy plate material such as diamond plate, bulkhead thresholds, which 
might be installed on roof doors, are shaped like typical bulkheads with one step up from one side and 
two steps up on the other.
Compression
A compressing top saddle compresses slightly to help absorb the weight and pressure applied to it. 
Compressing top thresholds are not very common and therefore not often used.
Expansion Joint
ADJUSTABLE
An adjustable expansion joint threshold comes in parts, which are pieced together to make the whole 
threshold to cover building expansion joint gaps so that there is a continuous ﬂoor surface between 
the two.
COVER PLATES
Typically manufactured from aluminum material, cover plates are available to cover building expansion 
joint gaps so that there is a continuous ﬂoor surface between the two.
Half-Threshold
Half-saddles with a ﬂuted surface are horizontal on one end and return back to the ﬂoor on the other 
end as a typical threshold would, and have a ﬂuted top surface. The horizontal end either butts up 
against or rests on top of a ﬂoor type such as carpet, where the normal return to the ﬂoor would inter-
fere with proper installation.
FIGURE 8.11 Half-Threshold
(Source: Courtesy of Pemko Manufacturing Company)
www.it-ebooks.info

336    |   ACCESSORIES
Interlocking
Interlocking thresholds have a single or double lip at the top of the threshold to catch a hook strip that 
is applied to the door. The hook strip slides and locks into place under the lip of the threshold, giving 
the bottom of the opening a more secure and closed opening underneath the door. Some interlocking 
thresholds have a water return feature to drive the water away from the opening bottom rather than 
collecting and possibly making its way inside.
Latching Panic
Latching panic thresholds are rabbeted and have a stop surface for a door to stop against when in the 
closed position. The stop typically has a gasket material to help soften the closing of the door against 
the stop surface and to help create a better seal at the bottom of the door. In addition, although cur-
rent codes and standards typically prohibit the use, the latching threshold is conﬁgured to work with a 
bottom latch of a surface-mounted vertical rod exit device. Latching panic thresholds are available with 
barrier-free and ﬂuted top surface options.
FIGURE 8.12 Latching Threshold
(Source: Courtesy of Pemko Manufacturing Company)
Plate, Fluted Surface
Plate thresholds with a ﬂuted surface are ﬂat plates that remain horizontal on both ends and have a 
ﬂuted top surface. Flat plates can be surface-mounted on the ﬂoor or recessed in the ﬂoor to have a 
continuous ﬂush installation.
Rabbeted
Rabbeted thresholds have a stop surface for a door to stop against when in the closed position. The 
stop typically has a gasket material to help soften the closing of the door against the stop surface and 
to help create a better seal at the bottom of the door.
Ramped, Barrier Free
Ramped thresholds are available with a ﬂuted top surface and are barrier free. Ramped thresholds 
typically are used on oﬀset ﬂoors that have a slight step to them to make them accessible. An acces-
sible compliant ramped threshold can accommodate ﬂoors with from 1/2-inch to over 2-inch surface 
changes.
FIGURE 8.13 Modular Ramp
(Source: Courtesy of Pemko Manufacturing Company)
Residential
Thresholds are available for speciﬁc residential door openings, which have diﬀerent code and standard 
requirements and are diﬀerent conﬁgurations than commercial construction door openings. Some 
residential door manufacturers manufacture complete door openings, including the door, frame, hard-
ware, gasketing, and threshold.
www.it-ebooks.info

ACCESSORIES    |    337
Saddle
A saddle is a traditional threshold that returns to the ﬂoor on both ends and is installed in between the 
entire jamb width opening of a door frame or opening. Saddles can be manufactured with smooth or 
ﬂuted surfaces, be barrier free, and can eliminate oﬀset ﬂoor steps or transitions.
Saddle for Floor Closers
Some manufacturers oﬀer thresholds to cover the ﬂoor closer in lieu of the standard decorative cover 
plate and or cover plate for terrazzo or other ﬂoor covering. Thresholds might be required by some 
codes for ﬂoor-type transitions and when using a ﬂoor closer in those opening types, optimally fur-
nishing the threshold by the same manufacturer as the ﬂoor closer would be the best option. Floor 
closer thresholds are available for center or oﬀset hung closers, with or without mitered ends, and with 
smooth or ﬂuted top surfaces.
SIZES
Thresholds are available in various widths and heights. A ﬂat plate or low raised plate can measure ¼ 
inch in thickness or overall height while the maximum allowed threshold height per accessibility codes 
and standards is ½ inch. Ramped thresholds must comply with a 1:12 slope, which means the slope of 
the ramp can change 1 inch in height for every 12 inches of distance.
OPTIONS
Epoxy-Filled Surfaces
Fluted surfaces have the option to be ﬁlled with various materials to help with traction such as an 
epoxy material, or with visibility such as with a photoluminescent epoxy material. These materials ﬁll 
the ﬂuted top surface voids and harden to become part of the threshold.
Anchors
Anchors are available to assist the fasteners with attaching to certain materials such as concrete or 
other ﬂoor surfaces or materials. The anchor is typically installed deeper into the ﬂoor than a standard 
screw fastener and will withstand higher abuse and frequency of use.
Barrier Free
A barrier-free option ensures that the threshold complies with accessibility codes, standards, and 
requirements, which allow certain maximum threshold and ﬂoor transition heights.
Coating
Thresholds are available with optional coatings that assist with making the surface slip resistant. This 
surface option might be desired in an area that experiences a lot of rainfall or snow.

338    |   ACCESSORIES
Cutouts
Thresholds might need to have cutouts for hardware such as dust-proof strikes or concealed vertical 
rod exit device latches.
Systems
Thresholds, most commonly ramped thresholds, are available in systems, which are preconﬁgured 
components made into their own solution to accommodate common ﬁeld conditions and applications.
Sound Transmission Class (STC)
Sound transmission class (STC) ratings measure the sound through a partition such as a wall, ceiling, 
and doors. (Some refer to the “C” as co-eﬃciency, but the correct term is “class.”) A standard rating, such 
as speech through a wall, would be STC 25, while STC 30–35, a slightly higher rating, would muﬄe the 
speech, although it still would be able to be heard. At STC 50, a band might be heard through a wall, but 
most sounds are contained and not heard at a rating this high. Higher ratings are available by specialty 
door manufacturers who specialize in heavy-duty sound attenuation.
QUANTITIES
Thresholds are furnished in single quantities and are speciﬁed one for each door required. This includes 
adjustable or ramped component thresholds that might require multiple pieces to make the threshold 
whole.
APPLICATIONS
Recessed
A ﬂat plate threshold can be installed recessed in a ﬂoor so that it is ﬂush with the ﬂoor creating a con-
tinuous surface.
Surface Mounted
Thresholds are typically installed surface-mounted on the ﬂoor or ﬂoor surface material.
INSTALLATION
It is typically recommended that a threshold be installed horizontally across the entire door width and 
across the entire jamb width opening. For example, if installing a threshold into a hollow metal frame 
with a 5 3/4-inch jamb width opening, a 4-inch-wide threshold would be inappropriate. Instead, a 
product at least 6 inches wide would be installed.
Fasteners
Thresholds are typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for installation on vari-
ous ﬂoor materials. If a heavy-duty or special application is required, other types of bolts and anchor 
options are available to be speciﬁed and used for the installation.
Locations
Thresholds should typically be installed per the manufacturer’s recommendations and horizontally 
between a door frame or door opening. They should cover the entire jamb width opening of the frame 
or framed opening.

Preparations
Threshold preparations take place in the ﬁeld by the installer, including the drilling and tapping of 
screw holes, and any anchor or special fastener installation preparations.
WEATHERSTRIPPING AND GASKETING
Also Known As: Weatherstrip, Gasket, Seals, Sound/Weather/Light Seals, Sound/Weather/Light Gaskets
DESCRIPTION
Weatherstripping and gasketing are installed to cover or ﬁll the clearance surrounding a door or doors 
in a frame. Weatherstripping and gasketing are available in diﬀerent conﬁgurations and are installed, 
either surface-mounted or recessed, around the perimeter edge of a door. Weatherstripping and gas-
keting are recommended to be installed the entire height and width of a door and might be required 
by certain codes or standards.
PROPERTIES
Finishes
Weatherstripping and gasketing are typically available in a limited number of architectural ﬁnishes and 
should comply with ANSI/BHMA A156.18 American National Standard for Materials and Finishes, 2012. 
Although some manufacturers might oﬀer other options, the most typical astragal ﬁnishes available 
are anodized aluminum, bronze, dark bronze, gold, and painted ﬁnishes. Astragals with gasket materi-
als are typically available in brown, black, gray, tan, and white and can be manufactured from foam, 
neoprene, santoprene, silicone, brush, and other materials.
Grades
Weatherstripping is not categorized by grades and should comply with Test Requirements as described 
in ANSI/BHMA A156.22 American National Standard for Door Gasketing and Edge Systems, 2005.
Materials
Weatherstripping housing can be manufactured with aluminum, brass, bronze, rubber, stainless 
steel, steel, wood, or other suitable material. The weatherstripping material inserted into the hous-
ings can be manufactured of neoprene, brush, rubber, silicone, or santoprene (sustainable type) 
material.
Some codes and standards require the use of intumescent materials, which expand when heated to 
a certain degree to seal and close any gaps surrounding an opening. Intumescent materials can be 
installed two ways, either on the frame or as part of the construction of a wood door edge, hidden 
behind the ﬁnished wood veneer.
TYPES
Weatherstripping and gasketing are available in various types, which can be manufactured from dif-
ferent materials, in various sizes, using diﬀerent mounting methods. ANSI/BHMA A156.22 American 
National Standard for Door Gasketing and Edge Seal Systems, 2005 describes the basic types.

Head and Jamb
Head and jamb weatherstipping is attached to the head and both jambs of the door frame. There are 
several types of basic head and jamb gaskets, which are described below.

FIGURE 8.18 Surface-Mounted Single Fin Adhesive 
Perimeter Seal
(Source: Courtesy of Pemko Manufacturing Company)
ENCASED IN RETAINER
This type of weatherstripping is a simple housing with a gasket material attached to it.
ADJUSTABLE
Adjustable weatherstripping is an encased weatherstripping that has a larger housing that can be 
adjusted to ﬁll uneven clearances surrounding the door opening. The adjustments are typically accom-
plished with built-in screws.
SELFADHESIVE
Although very easy to install and convenient, self-adhesive weatherstripping has the tendency to peel 
oﬀ of the door frame. Although tested and reliable when installed correctly, if the surface is not clean 
prior to installing or if the instructions are not followed exactly, it will not last very long.
SPRING
Spring weatherstripping is available to give the door tension in the opening. This will assist in keeping 
the door from rattling in a frame, although it is not a very commonly used type of weatherstripping.
MAGNETIC
Magnetic weatherstripping is available to give the gaskets a better chance of sealing the perimeter by 
matching up with another half that seals the gap magnetically.
www.it-ebooks.info

ACCESSORIES    |    341
INTERLOCKING
Interlocking weatherstripping is manufactured with two pieces and does like its name describes, inter-
locks with each other to create a tight seal.
Door Sweep
ENCASED IN RETAINER
Similar to the simple encased in retainer weatherstripping, the gasket material is attached to the hous-
ing, which is surface-mounted onto the door. This type of bottom “sweeps” the ﬂoor, as it does not have 
any rising or dropping motion as with an automatic door bottom.
DOOR SHOE
A door shoe is a housing that wraps around the bottom of the door with a weatherstripping material 
that is aﬃxed to it and sweeps the ﬂoor similary to a surface-mounted door sweep.

342    |   ACCESSORIES
DOOR SHOE WITH DRIP CAP
A door shoe with a drip cap is similar to a door shoe that has a housing that wraps around the bot-
tom of the door with a weatherstripping material that is aﬃxed to it and sweeps the ﬂoor similar to 
a surface-mounted door sweep. In addition, there is a curved material that helps with keeping water 
and other substances away from the clearance at the bottom of the door so it does  not to get inside 
the structure.
AUTOMATIC ENCASED IN RETAINER/SURFACE
A surface-mounted automatic door bottom is surface-mounted on the push side face of the door 
when it is hung in a door frame, and drops down to seal the bottom clearance when the door is 
in the closed position and rises up when in the open position. There is a small trigger that when 
depressed, causes the bottom to drop down; this is why it is important that the automatic door bot-
tom is installed on the push side face of the door, so that the trigger is depressed on the frame soﬃt 
when the door closes.

A concealed mounted automatic door bottom is mortised underneath the door in the center of the 
overall door thickness and used when the door is hung in a door frame. The seal drops down to seal the

bottom clearance when the door is in the closed position and rises up when in the open position. There 
is a small trigger that when depressed causes the bottom to drop down; this is why it is important that 
the automatic door bottom is installed in a door frame, so that the trigger is depressed on the frame 
soﬃt when the door closes.
Be aware of concealed hardware conﬂicts such as ﬂushbolts and vertical rod exit devices, and be aware 
of ﬁre rated wood doors, where automatic door bottoms might not be tested to meet applicable ﬁre 
door codes.
SIZES
Door bottoms are available in various widths to accommodate diﬀerent size door widths.  Depending 
on the type, some might have more ﬂexibility with being modiﬁed and shortened in the ﬁeld.
OPTIONS
Adjustable
Automatic door bottoms are available with adjusting screws to slightly raise and lower the actuating 
portion of the device. This allows for proper placement of the gasket against the ﬂoor or threshold, 
instead of having the gap visible or rubbing too hard against the bottom surface.
Cover
Although automatic door bottoms have a covering on the device mechanism, they are typically not 
removable covers as with weatherstripping, but rather a completely shaped housing.  As such, the 
screws are typically visible on surface mounted devices as they are applied through the face of the 
device, but concealed devices are typically aﬃxed from the bottom/underneath the door, which 
conceals the fasteners.

ACCESSORIES    |    345
Inserts
The door bottom weatherstripping insert material can be foam, neoprene, santoprene, silicone, brush, 
and other materials, and can also vary in shape.
Weatherstripping is furnished in quantities to suit the head and both jambs of a door opening and 
should be speciﬁed for each door width and height as required.
APPLICATIONS
Recessed
Some door frame manufacturers install recessed weatherstripping in a kerf integral in the frame at the 
corner of the rabbet where the stop meets the soﬃt. Some have a material built into the design to act

as a break to keep the metal from touching metal. This is ideal for energy eﬃciency—if the frame is hot 
on the outside and cold on the inside, the temperatures are not touching and do not aﬀect each other 
as greatly as if there were no break.
Surface Mounted
Weatherstripping is typically surface-mounted with the housing on the face at the frame soﬃt to allow 
the actual gasket material to be compressed against the door.
INSTALLATION
Weatherstripping is typically installed the full height vertically of both frame jambs and horizontally 
across the head of the frame.
Fasteners
Weatherstripping is typically installed with screw fasteners, which are available for installation on vari-
ous door materials. Heavy-duty and security fasteners are available if required.

ACCESSORIES    |    347
Locations
Weatherstripping should be installed per the manufacturer’s recommendations and the full height ver-

Preparations
Surface-mounted weatherstripping preparations take place in the ﬁeld by the installer, including the 
drilling and tapping of screw holes. Recessed preparations take place at the factory, depending on the 
door material and the services available from the manufacturer.

BUMPER GUARD
Also Known As: Door Guard
DESCRIPTION
Bumper guards are available to protect the surface of a door from being struck by heavy carts, machin-
ery, or any other object that might move through the opening. Rather than having objects hit the face 
of the door or installed hardware directly, these guards protect the door and hardware surfaces from 
being struck and damaged. There are various conﬁgurations manufactured to protect various types of 
door hardware devices that might be on the face of a door.
PROPERTIES
Bumper guards are typically manufactured from steel and are either a single or component piece 
assembly that protrudes oﬀ of the face of a door in order to be struck before anything else is hit or dam-
aged such as a lockset or exit device.
Finishes
These devices are typically manufactured from stainless steel material, which is very durable, requires 
no maintenance, and is the most weather resistant ﬁnish. There are some available in brass or bronze 
base metals, which allow for the matching of the architectural ﬁnishes of the balance of the door hard-
ware such as the lockset or hinges.
Grades
Bumper guards are not typically categorized in grades.

only two are speciﬁed. (This is because there is no strike jamb. The inactive door is the secure entity, so 
the silencers are installed on the head of the frame—one for each door at the latch side.)

VERTICAL ROD COVER
Also Known As: Rod Cover, Rod Protector
DESCRIPTION
A vertical rod cover is typically used to protect the rods of a surface-mounted vertical rod exit device 
from being struck by an object, such as a cart of equipment, or from being tampered with. These covers 
were also invented to accommodate an accessibility standard that prevents objects from projecting oﬀ 
the face of a door. By having these sloped covers, some devices are able to comply with this accessibility 
standard.

Miscellaneous Items
COMPUTERS
Also Known As: Personal Computers, PCs, Computers, Laptops
DESCRIPTION
Computers might be necessary to run software to operate the electronic door hardware and integrate 
into any other systems such as ﬁre or burglar alarm monitoring systems. Some door hardware 
manufacturers require the use of their own software to operate the system, which means that the 
devices all have to come from the same manufacturer, while others allow open compatibility, also 
known as open architecture, which allows a multitude of devices and software to talk to each other and 
operate together in the same environment regardless of who the manufacturer is.
There are many properties, types, options, quantities, applications, and installations oﬀered by various 
manufacturers, and each system should be designed by an experienced professional speciﬁc to each 
client and the users of the system.
DRAWINGS AND DIAGRAMS
Also Known As: Elevation Drawings or Diagrams, Point-to-Point Drawings or Diagrams, Wiring Drawings or 
Diagrams, Point-to-Points, Elevations
Drawings and diagrams should be required at minimum for each electriﬁed door opening, no matter 
how little or how much or how few or how many electriﬁcation or devices are being used. These 
drawings and diagrams should be speciﬁed in the project speciﬁcations but are not necessarily part of 
the speciﬁcations.

TYPES
Elevation
Elevation drawings have a front- or back-facing view of the opening with clear labels showing all of the 
devices installed on the opening. The elevation is typically accompanied by an operations narrative, 
which describes how the opening will operate from either side at any given time. Each system should 
be designed by an experienced professional speciﬁc to each client and user of the system.
Point-to-Point Wiring
A point-to-point wiring diagram typically shows each device in a system with their respective 
colored wires attached to each other. This will help guide the installation electrician with wiring the 
system together and avoid any guessing or errors that might cause damage to the devices requiring 
replacement. Each system should be designed by an experienced professional speciﬁc to each client 
and user of the system.

EXIT MOTION SENSOR
Exit motion sensors are used as part of some code egress requirements in addition to user preferences. 
Exit motion sensors might be required as part of some egress code requirements as a means to detect 
people approaching the door in order to release an electriﬁed locking device without their having 
to have prior knowledge of the device or its release to allow their egress. These same codes typically 
require a pushbutton as a secondary emergency release separate from the main system to release the 
door in an emergency. Signage is typically required and part of the pushbutton installation in order to 
make the user aware of the device in an emergency. Each system should be designed by an experienced 
professional speciﬁc to each client and the users of the system.

KEYPAD
Keypads are used as a switch in a hardware system to authorize a user to engage the electriﬁed locking 
device in order to gain entry through the door. The keypads typically have numeric buttons that are 
used to enter codes in order to gain authority to rotate the lever or knob and open the door. Keypads 
were the ﬁrst type of keyless lockset in a mechanical form. Once the technology advanced in the 
industry, the electronic option became available. Each system should be designed by an experienced 
professional speciﬁc to each client and user of the system.
KEY SWITCH
A key switch can be an important part of an electriﬁed hardware system. Key switches can be used to 
turn a system on and oﬀ; for example, the ﬁrst one into an oﬃce in the morning can turn oﬀ an alarm 
system or the requirement to use a card key in the morning now that someone is there to monitor those 
entering the space. This allows the system to rest and not cycle over and over if there is no reason to 
monitor the opening remotely or while there are people occupying the space. The key switch would 
also be used to engage or turn on a system or requirement for a card reader to be used once the oﬃce 
is closed for the day.
Key switches can be manufactured to accept both mortise and rim-type cylinders (for more information 
on cylinder types, please see Cylinders in Chapter 2). Each system should be designed by an experienced 
professional speciﬁc to each client and user of the system.
POWER SUPPLY
Power supplies are a very important piece of an electriﬁed hardware system. Power supplies typically 
take in high raw power from the power companies then transform, store, and regulate the output 
of power as necessary for the system. Device requirements and quantity, as well as their location, 
determines the power supply requirements.  Amps and voltage capacities must be compatible in order

for the system to operate optimally if not at all.  With the proper conﬁguration, one power supply can 
power one or multiple devices. The wiring distance of devices from the power supply can also vary, 
depending on the system as a whole, and each system is speciﬁc to the user and should be designed 
by an experienced professional.
Taking in the raw power from the power company and regulating it is important to protect the devices 
and the system from power surges, shorting out, and damaging the device or system where replacing 
materials might be required. The regulator “cleans” the energy and allows an even clean output of 
required voltage, such as 24 volts AC (alternating current).
POWER TRANSFER
A power transfer device would be used to transfer power from the frame to the door, and to the 
electronic locking device on the door. This device would be used in lieu of an electric transfer hinge, 
which has the same function. Some manufacturers have a much higher power rush than others to 
operate their electriﬁed locking device and might require a power transfer in lieu of an electric transfer 
hinge, as the hinge might not be able to handle the in-rush of power, which would damage the hinge 
and possibly the device. Each system should be designed by an experienced professional speciﬁc to 
each client and user of the system.
PUSHBUTTON
A pushbutton is a switch in a hardware system to authorize the unlocking of an electriﬁed locking 
device from the egress or nonsecure side of the door. Users typically use a pushbutton as a secondary

means of releasing a device in an emergency and when the primary device, typically an exit motion 
sensor, is not operating properly. This device is typically required by egress codes but also might be a 
preferred option of a user. Each system should be designed by an experienced professional speciﬁc to 
each client and user of the system.
OPTIONS
AMPERE AMP
Devices are available with various amperage requirements, which in turn require the proper amperage 
from a power supply. Some power supplies might allow for 2 amps, which would allow many devices 
to connect to the power supply as long as the total is less than 2 amps. For example, three 1/2-amp 
devices such as three mortise locksets within a certain allowable distance of the power supply would 
equal 1 1/2 amps in total, under the 2-amp total allowance of the power supply. Each system should be 
designed by an experienced professional speciﬁc to each client and user of the system.
BATTERY
Some power supplies have battery backups that are always charging when in operation, and if 
there is a power loss the battery will take over for a certain period. The logic is that the battery 
would hopefully supply power until the power comes back up, but depending on the system, size, 
power load, and period of the outage, the system may not operate after a short period of time. 
Each system should be designed by an experienced professional specific to each client and user 
of the system.

MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS    |    391
CURRENT
Current requirements diﬀer by manufacturer and device. Available as an alternating or direct current, 
devices must be coordinated properly in order to have proper operation and function. Each system 
should be designed by an experienced professional speciﬁc to each client and user of the system.
Alternating Current (AC)
Alternating current (AC) is the typical power used in our homes and standard outlets. The current is sent 
to and from the device, alternating in direction. If you ever noticed a buzzing sound at a door with an 
electric strike when power is sent to it, you are likely hearing the alternating current running through 
the device. Each system should be designed by an experienced professional speciﬁc to each client and 
user of the system.
Direct Current (DC)
Direct current (DC) can eliminate the buzzing sound and is typically a one-way current similar to that of 
a battery. Each system should be designed by an experienced professional speciﬁc to each client and 
user of the system.
VOLTAGE
Voltage requirements diﬀer by manufacturer and device. Available with various voltages such as 12 VAC 
or DC, and 24 VAC or DC, devices must be coordinated properly in order to have proper operation and 
function. Each system should be designed by an experienced professional speciﬁc to each client and 
user of the system.
KEY CONTROL CABINETS
Key control cabinets should be speciﬁed and detailed along with a comprehensive key control plan to 
help the owner and user maintain key control and security of their building and facility. There are many 
options for key cabinets and control systems, with each system being speciﬁc to each user. All systems 
should be designed by an experienced professional.
KEY CONTROL SOFTWARE
Key control software is available for both electronic and mechanical key systems. Some manufacturers 
oﬀer these software programs, as do third-party vendors, who oﬀer numerous options for maintaining 
a key system. There are many options for key control software; each system is speciﬁc to each user and 
should be designed by an experienced professional.
MANUALS
Manuals should be speciﬁed and detailed to ensure that the owner and users of the facility or building 
have access to all product nomenclature, model numbers, installation guides, user manuals, and any 
other literature and collateral available to assist them with the smooth operation and maintenance of 
their facility.
New technologies are emerging, such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), which is the 3D rep-
resentation of the drawings and speciﬁcations for a building being designed and built, prior to the

physical construction of the building. This new technology allows all “manuals” to be virtual and stored 
in a computer ﬁle rather than hardcopy binders as traditionally done. This technology allows for the 
troubleshooting, conﬂict resolution, accurate costing, timing, and coordination of all aspects of the 
construction project prior to its taking place in order to be more eﬃcient and better prepared for the 
real thing.
Each system should be designed by an experienced professional speciﬁc to each client and user of the 
system.
WIRE
Wire is typically specified by the electrician but should be coordinated in the specifications and 
submittals for clarification of the wiring requirements and the party responsible for furnishing it. 
Some of the important aspects of wiring are the distance a wire can run from the power supply 
to the device. The wire gauge also plays an important part of the system design. The higher the 
gauge, the longer a distance the power will travel without dissipating. If the gauge is too small, 
and the distance is too long, the power will not operate the device properly, possibly preventing 
the system from operating optimally, causing damage to the devices or system or, more seriously 
loss, theft, or harm to the users of the building or facility. Wiring is an important part of the elec-
trified hardware system and each system is specific to each user and should be designed by an 
experienced professional.
