Foreword
What’s your investment broker doing? Right now … really, what are they 
doing? Are they busy managing your money, making the best investments to 
secure your retirement—or are they shopping for a yacht—or a new pent-
house apartment in New York, London, or San Francisco?
What we now know is that following the 2008 recession, Wall Street (your 
broker) got bailed out. What did everyone else who lost money get? Did you 
lose your retirement nest egg? What did you get? Did you know that if you 
happen to be black, in particular a woman, chances are that if you had a 401(k) 
or investment portfolio, it lost some 80 percent of its value during the reces-
sion and that it will take the rest of your life to get it back—if at all? Are you 
ready to work through your retirement?
For decades, poor people and their communities have suffered at the hands 
of predatory banks and investment firms. While banks and investment firms 
have been raking in big dollars, making big profits for themselves and the super 
rich—poor people have been left behind. However, in the last few years, a 
movement has been brewing. Poor people, white, black and brown, are slowly 
realizing the power of their dollar. They are showing the world that the dollar 
they hold is the same shade of green as the dollar that wealthy investors hold, 
and that they have the power to effect change in a magnificent way.
Enter crowdfunding—a way for the everyday entrepreneur and small business 
to raise investment capital from anyone, without selling their souls to banks, 
hedge funds, venture capitalists, and so-called “angel investors.” Since the law 
President Obama signed went into effect on May 16, 2016, equity crowdfund-
ing, driven by the power of the average person’s investment dollar, has shown 
exponential growth. However, even with this exponential growth, driven by 
everyday investors, the question arises: how are black and brown communities 
benefiting from this new investment vehicle? More important, where are they?
William Michael Cunningham, a pioneer of the movement long before crowd-
funding was a “thing,” has been working diligently to bring awareness of crowd-
funding and its benefits to black, brown, and minority communities. Through 
his research, Bill has made widely known what is no secret in underrepre-
sented communities—that although black buying power surpasses $1 trillion, 
black communities rarely benefit from the boost the economy receives from 
their dollars.

Foreword
x
In this second edition, Bill brilliantly explains what is keeping crowdfunding 
alive in communities all over the nation. (What he may not mention is that the 
majority of the funding on a crowdfunding web site he ran, Blackcrowdfunding.
net, came from black women like myself.)
To learn more about the world of crowdfunding and equity crowdfunding 
and what it can do for you, grab onto your seat and be prepared to find out 
how it will fundamentally change investing and finance around the globe—and 
around you.

About the Author
William Michael Cunningham is an econo-
mist, investment advisor, researcher, and social 
investing policy analyst. Cunningham researches, 
evaluates, develops, and creates specific socially 
responsible investments. A former securities 
broker and institutional salesman, he has worked 
with pension fund trustees, investment manag-
ers, community activists, government agencies, 
and financial industry organizations to create 
and implement social and community invest-
ing initiatives. Cunningham has testified before 
the Ways and Means and Financial Services 
Committees of the US House of Representatives. In an October 1998 petition 
to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, he 
opposed the elimination of the Glass–Steagall Act, citing evidence that grow-
ing financial market malfeasance greatly reduced the safety and integrity of 
large financial institutions. He warned that getting rid of the law was sure to 
bring about a crisis.
On December 22, 2003, on December 22, 2005 (in a meeting with the Division 
of Market Regulation), and on February 6, 2006, he warned the SEC about the 
possibility of systemwide economic and market failure.
On June 7, 2007, Mr. Cunningham proposed the creation of the Microcredit 
Stock Exchange (an early form of crowdfunding) to the Government of the 
District of Columbia in a meeting with the Office of the Deputy Mayor for 
Planning and Economic Development and the Office of the City Council 
Chairman. The proposal was not accepted.
On June 17, 2015, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit 
recognized Mr. Cunningham as a friend of the court in an action (15-1150)  
that two state securities regulators brought against the US Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC). His brief concludes by suggesting the SEC 
immediately implement Title III of the JOBS Act. The SEC implemented Title 
III shortly thereafter.
On June 16, 2016, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit again recognized Mr. Cunningham as a friend of the court in Met Life 
vs. the Financial Stability Oversight Council (16-5086), “MetLife’s challenge to

its designation as a systemically important financial institution under Dodd-
Frank.” Mr. Cunningham’s brief noted the public’s interest in financial stability.
And on July 15, 2016, Mr. Cunningham was recognized as a friend of the 
court in National Association of Fixed Annuities vs. the Department of 
Labor(16-cv-1035), a case in the US District Court for the District of Columbia 
challenging the ability of the Department of Labor to “raise investment advice 
standards” as they apply to retirement accounts. Mr. Cunningham supported 
the public interest and the department.
Mr. Cunningham has been involved in the provision of online resources to 
small businesses for more than 20 years, posting his first web site in 1995. He 
is an unaffiliated member at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names 
and Numbers (ICANN).
On December 28, 2014, he released the Top 50 Crowdfunding Campaigns: Fifty 
Most Successful Crowdfunding Campaigns (Kindle Edition, www.amazon.com/
Top-50-Crowdfunding-Campaigns-Successful-ebook/dp/B00RKK4NL0).
Mr. Cunningham holds an MA in economics from the University of Chicago, as 
well as an MBA in finance from the university’s Booth School of Business. He 
holds a BA in economics from Howard University.

Acknowledgments
I thank my college and graduate-school interns, current and former, for their 
help. They are a remarkable group of talented young people. I have been hon-
ored to work with them.
In the current year, Ms. Ningyuan Liu, an impact investing analyst and recipi-
ent of a master’s degree from the Management Studies Program in the Fuqua 
School of Business at Duke University, was extremely helpful. She worked on 
this book as part of an internship with Creative Investment Research.
Mr. Jimmy Maio, an impact investing analyst with Creative Investment Research, 
also worked on this book. He is a recent graduate of the University of Virginia.
Ms. Heewon Kim, an impact investing analyst with Creative Investment 
Research and a student at the George Washington University School of 
Business, is another intern who was very helpful.
Ms. Hanna Kim, Mr. Ziqi Chen, Ms. Jing Chen, and Mr. Jianning Zhang, interns 
at Creative Investment Research and National Crowdfunding Services, also 
provided assistance, as did Howard Williams.
I also thank, again, Claiborne Booker, an alumnus of the Booth School at the 
University of Chicago; and Creative Investment Research advisory board 
member Larry McCoy. Both were a great help, as was Carnell Scruggs. Betty 
Culpepper at the US Library of Congress was extremely helpful, as were staff 
lawyers in the Law Library.
I’d like to also thank Charles O’Neil at the Texas Association of African 
American Chambers of Commerce. Dorothy Pitman Hughes also helped.
Lineage Family Reunion members Gladys and William David Jackson were, 
again, instrumental in providing needed assistance that allowed me to com-
plete this book.
Finally, I’d like to thank my sister Stefanie Flood and my new grandniece Anaya 
Webb.
If I write anything you find useful, these are the people to thank. If I make a 
mistake, (and I will), the fault is mine, and mine alone.

Introduction
Crowdfunding is now well established. In fact, we raised money via crowd-
funding to help with writing this book (Figure 1).
We raised $195 on Indiegogo from
• 
Aaron Palmer
• 
Eneshal Miller
• 
Ambrose Moses III
• 
Claiborne Booker
We also ran a campaign on GoFundMe, another crowdfunding web site 
(Figure 2). (While you can do this for donations-based crowdfunding, SEC 
rules prohibit you from doing the same thing for JOBS Act crowdfunding.)

What This Book Is About
On April 5, 2012, President Obama signed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups 
Act, better known as the JOBS Act. The act is designed to “reopen American 
capital markets to small companies,” defined as “emerging growth compa-
nies.” I believe this is one of the most significant legislative initiatives since the 
Securities and Exchange Acts of 1933 and 1934. This law changes everything.
A composite of several pieces of proposed legislation,1 the final version of 
the JOBS Act, H.R. 3606, was passed by the House of Representatives on 
March 7, 2012. The Senate passed its version of the legislation on March 
22, 2012. Supporters included the National Venture Capital Association, the 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, the National Small Business

Association, the US Chamber of Commerce, the International Franchise 
Association, and the Biotechnology Industry Organization.
Small businesses and startups can now raise up to $1 million in equity (or 
debt) funding online via what are called crowdfunding platforms—online com-
munities and web sites. Imagine an eBay-like site that allows you to post your 
idea for a commercial venture online and then allows investors to purchase 
equity shares or stakes in it. As one journalist put it, it’s social media meets 
venture capital.
I believe that not only will companies now be able to use the Internet to raise 
significant amounts of capital (equity or debt) funding but, having done so, they 
will also use the new media to drive sales, product development, distribution, 
social/sustainability benefits, compliance/branding issues, and customer sup-
port. This really changes everything. This book is about the development and 
implementation of the law, what it means, and how and why it will impact the 
business startup marketplace. The book also describes significant transforma-
tional opportunities, and risks, for those seeking to understand the economic 
implications of the new law.
Not just for entrepreneurs, the book will benefit securities lawyers, commu-
nity development specialists, educators, venture capitalists, and those offering 
services in the new crowdfunding arena. It is, simply, the most current and 
most comprehensive compendium of information on the law and its impact 
on this new market.
Plan for the Second Edition
As in the first edition, I start with a summary of the JOBS Act. Next, I review 
how the financing environment for startups has changed since the first edition, 
followed by a review of current data on emerging growth companies (EGCs), 
a new business firm category created by the JOBS Act. I cover disclosure and 
crowdfunding in the next chapters.
What is new in the second edition is this: based on the SEC’s data, I have cre-
ated a financial model of the crowdfunding marketplace. I show what small 
companies can expect to pay to use Title III crowdfunding. I also show the 
cost of creating and running a Title III crowdfunding platform. Finally, I create a 
model of the Title III crowdfunding industry, based on SEC data.
I end where we began, with a section-by-section review of the JOBS Act.
As I said in the first edition, it’s essential that you are fully up-to-date with the 
regulations before you even think about raising money via crowdfunding. The 
laws may have eased when it comes to raising capital for your company, but 
that doesn’t mean they are easy. You can still pay significant penalties for mak-
ing mistakes when offering securities.

Summary of the 
JOBS Act
The JOBS Act represents a fundamental change in the business-financing envi-
ronment. Many companies, previously blocked out of the market for capital, 
are now able to obtain business financing. This has led to disruptions across 
the board. In this part of the book, we explore some of those disruptions.
The JOBS Act starts by encouraging small companies to sell stock to the 
public (known as going public). The second section of the law eliminates cer-
tain restrictions against selling stock to the general public, lowering certain 
outdated safeguards meant to prevent the sale of securities to persons and 
institutions that are unqualified or unprepared to purchase them.
The third section of the law, the crowdfunding provision, targets emerging 
growth companies and defines them as an equity security issuer with “total 
annual gross revenues of less than $1,000,000,000 … during its most recently 
completed fiscal year.” These firms are now exempt from certain reporting 
requirements, making it easier to raise capital. As you’ll see, this is a big deal.
Here’s what makes up Part I:
Chapter 1—The JOBS Act: Summary and Definitions
We review the crowdfunding industry and its remarkable growth and define 
various types of crowdfunding efforts: donations vs. rewards-based, including 
crowdfunding efforts that offer stock or equity rewards. To understand the 
law and take advantage of it, you must know the precise meaning of several 
terms, including emerging growth company and crowdfunding. Chapter 1 defines 
these.

In addition, you must understand the set of institutional arrangements that 
govern the market for startup financing. Using examples, charts, and graphs, I 
describe the crowdfunding marketplace.
Chapter 2—Startup Financing Environment: Is the JOBS Act Still 
Needed?
This chapter is all about the supply of startup and small business capital. Using 
information on startup business capital flows, I describe how startups are 
currently financed and the recovery this sector has experienced since the 
financial crisis. I note that the crisis has led to generally lower potential avail-
ability of capital for startup businesses (since home values have not yet fully 
recovered), but point out how the JOBS Act will improve financing opportuni-
ties for small companies.
Chapter 3—Emerging Growth Companies: Facts, Figures, and 
Potential
This chapter focuses on demand for startup and small business capital. The 
chapter provides baseline information on emerging growth companies (EGCs), 
companies with less than $1 billion in revenue. I list the number of EGCs in 
each state, the number of EGCs in each industry, and compare the entrepre-
neurial environment in the United States with that in China. Finally, I describe 
how the JOBS Act will impact this sector. Chapter 3 also reviews selected 
donations-based, Title III and Title IV equity crowdfunding campaigns.

The JOBS Act 
Summary and Definitions
Signed into law on April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) 
Act remains a revolutionary development in the world of startup and small 
business financing. The revolutionary potential of the JOBS Act has been grad-
ually activated by phased regulatory implementation of its various parts, called 
titles. Only since May 16, 2016, for example, have startups and small businesses 
been enabled to tap the promise of certain provisions in the JOBS Act to use 
the power of the Internet to raise equity capital from investors across the 
country and around the globe. These provisions allow small companies, includ-
ing startups, to raise via crowdfunding (described in full later in this chapter) 
up to $1 million per year, subject to a five-year and $700 million market-
value limit. For such companies, the JOBS Act has also created exemptions to 
accounting and auditing rules, as well as to rules that require public companies 
to report details concerning executive compensation and other financial data.
All of these developments have the potential to be a very good deal for 
startup and small businesses. The aim of this book is to present the details of 
the JOBS Act and not only show you what’s happening from the 40,000-foot 
level, but also provide a ground-level interpretive and practical guide that will 
empower you to use the act to obtain capital to start or fund an existing firm, 
or to help others do so. This book will also prove helpful to investors looking 
for opportunities to invest in promising companies.

This chapter reviews the crowdfunding industry and its remarkable growth. I 
define and explain types of crowdfunding efforts: donations vs. rewards-based, 
including crowdfunding efforts that offer stock, or equity, rewards. The chapter 
closes with a summary of the JOBS Act.
The Growth of the Crowdfunding Industry 
Since 2012
Much has transpired in the years since the first edition of this book was pub-
lished, a few short months after the 2012 signing that made the JOBS Act law. 
An entire industry has developed. This industry group now includes crowd-
funding platforms, or web sites, designed to allow firms with less than $1 bil-
lion in revenue to raise funding. A secondary group of service providers has 
formed around certain aspects of the law. This group includes crowdfunding 
public-relations experts, accountants, lawyers, writers, authors, and educators. 
Several new crowdfunding trade associations have also been formed.
Figure 1-1 is an industry map showing the top 50 firms in the following areas:
• 
Rewards crowdfunding
• 
Lending and debt-based crowdfunding
• 
Real-estate crowdfunding
• 
Donation-based crowdfunding
• 
Title III equity crowdfunding (all platforms and interme-
diaries currently registered with the US Securities and 
Exchange Commission, or SEC)
The map includes a Service Provider section, showing selected law firms, pub-
lic-relations firms, and trade associations specializing in crowdfunding.
This is remarkable: from a standing start in 2012, every portion of the indus-
try’s infrastructure now has professional participants in place. This bodes well 
for the future.
Some may question why I am so optimistic about the law’s potential. Figure 1-2 
may help you understand. It shows search trends from 2004 to 2016 for two 
terms: crowdfunding and small business administration on Google. From zero in 
2004, searches for crowdfunding in 2016 exceeded Google searches for Small 
Business Administration. This is noteworthy.

I do not mean to imply that crowdfunding will replace the Small Business 
Administration. The JOBS Act is one small part of crowdfunding, but this new 
technique will certainly be one option startups and small businesses will use 
to obtain funding.
Estimates of the size of the crowdfunding marketplace vary wildly.1 The histo-
gram in Figure 1-3 shows one estimate of the US crowdfunding marketplace 
in 2014. Lending and other related forms of crowdfunding, accounting for 
$6.4 billion (69 percent) of the total of $9.6 billion in crowdfunding revenues, 
was the leading category of crowdfunding.2 This figure distinguishes donations-
based crowdfunding—that is, fundraising efforts in which the return to donors 
is all social (such as good feelings)—from rewards-based crowdfunding—that 
is, fundraising efforts in which the campaign sponsors will provide donors 
something (even a small item or service) in return for a donation. Note that 
investment-based crowdfunding, the subject of the JOBS Act, is a subcategory 
of rewards-based crowdfunding in which the reward is a monetary return of 
undetermined value.

Administration,” August 2016
1When I approach data that has a great deal of uncertainty, I prefer to present data whose 
reliability has been stabilized by the passage of time.
2The related forms are hybrid crowdfunding (a combination of some or all of the categories 
listed) and royalty crowdfunding (campaigns that allow contributors/investors to share in 
specified asset-based income streams).

broadly similar in 2014 to those in the United States. Figure 1-4 shows that

To supply a better feel for US trends, Figure 1-5 shows the cumulative amount 
of money raised by 2016 on Kickstarter, perhaps the premier non–JOBS Act 
crowdfunding web site in the United States. Founded in 2009, Kickstarter 
allows anyone with a need, product, or service to raise money. By July 2012, 
companies, individuals, and others had raised $276 million on Kickstarter. By 
July 2016, this figure had grown by an order of magnitude to $2.527 billion.
Crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter emerged because of the ability of 
entrepreneurs to use technology to address the lack of small business financ-
ing from large financial institutions. The inability of these large entities to hon-
estly meet small business credit needs was one factor that led to the recent 
global financial crisis. Large financial institutions allocated staff resources and 
money to derivatives trading and hedge funds rather than seeking to facilitate 
and grow small business lending because derivatives trading appeared easier 
and more profitable in the short term. The crisis cost US households $17 
trillion.
Courtesy of the JOBS Act—and via crowdfunding platforms (defined at the 
end of this chapter), online communities, and web sites—a small business, 
including companies just starting up, can raise up to $1 million in equity (or 
debt) funding online. Although Kickstarter is a crowdfunding web site, it is not 
a crowdfunding platform in the technical sense defined by the US SEC in rela-
tion to the JOBS Act, which I discuss in Chapter7. For now, think Facebook

for money. Think Facebook combined with eBay (FaceBay or BayFace), a site 
that allows you to post your idea for a commercial venture online and allows 
investors to purchase equity shares or stakes in it. As one article put it, social 
media meets venture capital. (Note that, unless they register as crowdfund-
ing portals under the JOBS Act, you cannot currently use either Facebook or 
eBay in this way, however.)
In the new, post–JOBS Act implementation environment, not only will compa-
nies be able to use the Internet to raise significant amounts of capital (equity 
or debt) funding, but having done so, they will use the new media in entirely 
new ways to drive sales, product development, distribution, social/sustainabil-
ity compliance/branding, and customer support. This really changes everything, 
and is why I am writing a second edition to this book.
This book is about the development and implementation of the JOBS Act, 
what it means, and how and why it is impacting the business startup market-
place. This book also describes significant opportunities and risks for those 
seeking to reap the benefits and fully comprehend the economic implications 
of the SEC.
Rewards- and Donations-Based Crowdfunding 
Compared to JOBS Act Investment-Based 
Crowdfunding
Independent of the new regime of fundraising possibilities established by the 
JOBS Act and its regulatory implementation, rewards- and donations-based 
crowdfunding has spurred a vibrant, active, amazing marketplace for new 
products and services. Enthusiasts have used rewards- and donations-based 
crowdfunding to launch entirely new products, such as the Pebble Smartwatch 
(see Chapter 5). Others have used this type of crowdfunding for philanthropic 
causes, such as assisting victims of the mass shooting in Orlando or promot-
ing reading by disseminating LeVar Burton’s Reading Rainbow app to children 
(also detailed in Chapter 5). These examples signal that we are at the start 
of a remarkable journey of business reinvigoration, facilitated, fostered, and 
bankrolled by rewards- and donations-based crowdfunding.
Before we get too carried away with visions of a business- and innovation-
financing utopia, let’s remember that rewards- and donations-based crowd-
funding differ fundamentally from the investment-based crowdfunding 
governed and enabled by the JOBS Act. As I’ve noted, the difference is based 
primarily on the nature of the compensation received by crowdfunding campaign 
participants. Social return is the currency of donations-based crowdfunding. 

Chapter 1 | The JOBS Act 
10
Investment-based crowdfunding, on the other hand, relies mainly on something 
more tangible: cash (Benjamins, Tubmans, cabbage, cheddar, ducats, moola, the 
long green—however you describe it) or at least its potential, to compensate 
participants. The difference is critical, because it establishes the rationale for 
the JOBS Act. Table 1-1 summarizes the key differences between JOBS Act 
crowdfunding and rewards- and donations-based crowdfunding.

Title I: Reopening American Capital Markets to Emerging Growth Companies
Defines emerging growth company (EGC) as a firm with less than $1 billion in revenue and its 
first sale of common equity after 12/8/2011.
Exempts EGCs from executive compensation shareholder approval requirement.
Exempts EGCs from needing to present more than two years of audited financial 
statements.
Exempts EGCs from compliance with any new or revised financial accounting standards, 
with certain limits.
Exempts EGCs from audit and attestation requirement concerning internal controls, with 
certain limits.
Exempts EGCs from compliance with auditing or other Public Company Accounting 
Oversight Board (PCAOB) accounting standards.
Exempts broker/dealers from pre-offering reports on EGCs.
Prohibits SEC or national securities associations from applying conflict-of-interest rules or 
regulations concerning an initial public offering (IPO) of an EGC.
Allows an EGC to solicit qualified institutional buyers or accredited investors.
Prohibits SEC or national securities associations from applying rules or regulations 
concerning the publication of research reports on EGCs.
Allows an EGC to submit a confidential draft registration statement to the SEC.
Requires the SEC to study decimalization, a system that allows security prices to be given in 
one-penny ($0.01) increments.
Allows an EGC to forgo exemptions granted under the act.
Requires the SEC to study modernizing Regulation S-K. Regulation S-K establishes certain 
reporting requirements, rules that govern which data must be reported to investors, and 
when.
Title II: Access to Capital for Job Creators
Requires the SEC to modify Regulation D so that general solicitation and advertising 
prohibitions do not apply if all buyers are accredited investors. Regulation D, according to 
the US SEC, is a regulation containing “three rules providing exemptions from (security 
offering) registration requirements, allowing some companies to sell their securities without 
having to register the securities with the SEC.”1
Requires issuers to verify that security buyers are accredited.
Mandates that the SEC allow security sales, under this exemption, to those the seller 
believes are qualified institutional buyers.

Mandates that Regulation D–exempt offerings do not become public offerings “as a result of 
general advertising or general solicitation.”
Exempts certain persons from broker/dealer registration under three conditions.
Title III: Crowdfunding
Defines terms under which transactions of $1 million or less are exempt from certain 
registration requirements. Crowdfunding is raising equity capital funds for a startup or small 
business firm from a relatively large number of small investors.
Defines a funding portal.
Defines requirements for a crowdfunding exemption.
Defines exemption from shareholder caps.
Defines funding portal exemption, portal SEC, and national security association examination 
dependency. (In other words, portals are exempt from certain SEC registration rules, but 
are required to remain subject to examination by the SEC and other regulators.)
Does not allow a state or any governmental subdivision to enforce laws or initiate certain 
actions against funding portals, subject to limits. (These limits are described in later chapters 
of the book.)
Title IV: Small Company Capital Formation
Directs the SEC to exempt certain small companies from Regulation A, a class of securities 
with less than $50 million in aggregate offerings over a 12-month period. This limit was 
increased from $5 million.
Mandates that securities covered by the exemption be equity, debt, or debt securities 
convertible to equity.
Describes disclosure, reporting, electronic filing, disclosure termination, and exemption 
disqualification requirements.
Mandates a biannual review of the $50 million limit.
Releases securities covered by the section from state regulation.
Mandates blue-sky study. Blue-sky laws are state laws governing the sale and offering of 
securities.
Title V: Private Company Flexibility and Growth
Increases shareholder registration requirement to $10 million, from $1 million for issuers 
with either 2,000 “shareholders of record” or 500 accredited investors.
Exempts securities received as part of employee compensation from the held-of-record 
calculation.

The JOBS Act

I explain most of these important changes in securities laws in the rest of the 
book. But the bottom line is that startups and small businesses may now find 
it easier to raise capital.
To implement the changes in the securities law mandated by the JOBS Act, 
Congress required the US SEC to create an entirely new set of regulations. Over 
four years and 2,000 pages of regulations later, it did. These are the “rules of the 
crowdfunding road” and serve to let you know exactly what is (and is not) allowed. 
The path the SEC took to implementing the JOBS Act is described next.
Regulatory Implementation Chronology
The JOBS Act requires changes to the regulations governing the issuance of 
debt and equity offerings in the United States. These regulations were defined 
by two key laws, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934.
The Securities Act of 1933 does the following:
• 
Requires that investors receive financial and other signifi-
cant information concerning securities being offered for 
public sale
• 
Prohibits deceit, misrepresentations, and other fraud in 
the sale of securities
Its companion, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, created the SEC and gave it 
“broad authority over all aspects of the securities industry. This includes the 
power to register, regulate, and oversee brokerage firms, transfer agents, and 
clearing agencies as well as the nation’s securities self-regulatory organizations 
(SROs).”
Table 1-2.  (continued)
The JOBS Act: Public Law 112-106, House Bill Number H.R. 3606, Signed into Law on 
April 5, 2012
Title VI: Capital Expansion
Increases shareholder registration requirement to $10 million, from $1 million for issuers 
with 2,000 shareholders of record for a bank or bank-holding company.
Mandates termination of registration if the number of shareholders of record falls below 
1,200 for a bank or bank-holding company.
Title VII: Outreach on Changes to the Law
Requires the SEC to notify small and medium-sized, women-owned, veteran-owned, and 
minority-owned businesses of changes made by the act.

Chapter 1 | The JOBS Act 
14
In order to reflect Congress’s vision of modern economic conditions and 
needs, the JOBS Act charges the SEC to review and modify certain regulations 
that were created to implement the 1933 and 1934 acts. As part of the modi-
fication process, the SEC is required to obtain and consider input from the 
public. To do so, the agency issues open requests for comment on proposed 
SEC regulations. Each regulation or rule, together with its public commentary 
and successive drafts, is documented and tracked in a specific numbered regu-
latory file.
Key JOBS Act Regulations
The five key regulations implementing the JOBS Act are listed in Table 1-3 in 
order of issuance. In subsequent chapters, we review each of these regulations 
in more detail.

The JOBS Act
15
The JOBS Act was enacted on April 5, 2012, and mandated that the SEC issue 
all rules by January 28, 2013.
Table 1-3 reflects a somewhat misleading version of the path to JOBS Act 
implementation. The truth is that implementation was far more convoluted 
than the table suggests. The Act mandated that “not later than 270 days after 
the date of enactment of” the JOBS Act on April 5, 2012, that the SEC “shall 
issue such rules as the Commission determines may be necessary or appro-
priate for the protection of investors.” This means the rules should have been 
issued no later than January 28, 2013. The SEC was 1,205 days late in imple-
menting provisions of Title III of the JOBS Act.
Why does this matter? Unemployment was 7.5 percent in April 2012. By May 
2016, when the Title III provisions of the JOBS Act became operational, it was 
nearly 5 percent. This means that many of those who would have created new, 
small, innovative products and companies are now working for someone else.
Structure of the Act
As set out in Table 1-2, the JOBS Act consists of the following seven titles:
• 
Title I—Reopening American Capital Markets to Emerging 
Growth Companies. Defines the scope of the problem 
and defines what emerging growth companies are.
• 
Title II—Access to Capital for Job Creators. Removes the 
“prohibition against general solicitation or general adver-
tising … for accredited investors” and provides other 
relief from certain restrictions. Outlines ways to begin 
the process of getting capital to emerging growth com-
panies and others.
• 
Title III—Crowdfunding. The most significant title of the 
law. Opens startup and small company investment mar-
kets to the 97 percent of the US population previously 
excluded.
• 
Title IV—Small Company Capital Formation. Allows small 
and medium-sized companies to raise up to $50 million 
via crowdfunding. The SEC implemented Title IV of the 
JOBS Act before Title III. It is my contention that Congress 
intended Title III, small-scale (up to $1 million) equity 
crowdfunding, to come first. After all, Congress placed 
Title III before Title IV in the JOBS Act for a reason: this 
sequencing allowed the SEC to use experience gained in 
small-scale offerings to set the stage for and improve the 
larger-scale offerings generated out of Title IV.

Chapter 1 | The JOBS Act 
16
• 
Title V—Private Company Flexibility and Growth. Defines 
certain exemptions from SEC registration.
• 
Title VI—Capital Expansion. Modifies the number of 
shareholders a company must have in order to trigger 
certain issuer registration requirements. Modifies secu-
rity issuer reporting requirements for bank-holding 
companies.
• 
Title VII—Outreach on Changes to the Law. Mandates 
that the SEC notify women-, veteran-, and minority-
owned companies of the opportunity to raise capital by 
using crowdfunding.
Let’s take a look at some of the more important pieces of the legislation.
Increased Capital-Raising Allowances
The JOBS Act increases the amount of money that can be raised by using 
standard exemptions to the securities registration and reporting require-
ments, and it allows startups and small companies to raise capital over the 
Internet. At its best, the law recognizes that changes in technology have 
necessitated a revision to securities laws. Figures 1-6 and 1-7 place these 
changes in context.
Figure  1-6 shows how the act changes the amount of money that can 
be raised via small company offerings and crowdfunding. The revision to 
small company offering limits (Reg A in Figure 1-6, short for Regulation A) 
is significant, growing from $5 to $50 million. Crowdfunding, however, 
moves from zero to $1 million, a percentage increase of, well, infinity. The 
crowdfunding dollar amount allowed is 50 times smaller than the Reg A 
limit. Hopefully, this provides some context. While the change is significant, 
the dollar amount allowed via crowdfunding is well below that of other 
security offering options.

The JOBS Act
17
In addition to allowing new forms of capital access, the law also increases 
the number of shareholders needed to trip what is known as the share-
holder trigger, the point at which a company must register its securities with 
the SEC. Figure 1-7 shows the old and the new triggers in general (Public 
Company SOR Trigger) and for banks and for bank-holding companies (B, 
BHC SOR Trigger).

Exemptions from Certain Reporting 
Requirements 
EGCs seeking debt or equity funding are now exempt from a number of 
requirements regarding the reporting of certain financial data. These reporting 
requirements were enshrined in the Securities and Exchange Acts of 1933 and 
1934, and they have governed the rules for raising equity capital ever since, so 
this is a big change. Firms that issued stock on or before December 8, 2011 
are not covered by the act, however.
According to the law, EGCs do not need to do the following:
• 
“Present more than two years of audited financial state-
ments in order for the registration statement of such 
emerging growth company with respect to an initial public 
offering of its common equity securities to be effective.”
• 
“Comply with any new or revised financial accounting 
standard as defined under section 2(a) of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7201(a)).”

Further, broker/dealers are exempt from restrictions concerning the publica-
tion or distribution of research reports about an EGC’s stock. These research 
reports are not considered an offer to sell securities, an important exemp-
tion. In the language of the law, these research reports published will “not …  
constitute an offer for sale or offer to sell a security, even if the broker or 
dealer is participating or will participate in the registered offering of the secu-
rities of the issuer.”
The act loosens rules concerning sales, solicitation, reporting, and accounting 
that discourage many startup and small companies from going public. In addi-
tion, investment banks and brokers are free to publish and distribute research 
reports on small and startup companies without worrying that they will con-
flict with SEC rules and regulations.
Furthermore, there is no “quiet period” for these EGC issuers. Previously, 
from the time a company submitted and filed with the SEC a formal notice 
that it was raising equity, known as a registration statement, to the point at 
which staff at the SEC determined that the registration statement was legal, 
issuers could say only a limited number of things to the public about what 
they were doing. This new law allows EGCs to speak to the public about what 
they are doing and why they are raising capital. Given the nature of Internet 
technology, this only makes sense. More on this later.
Further, the JOBS Act limits the ability of the SEC to restrict communi-
cations between a securities analyst and a potential investor based on 
the analyst’s role in an EGC’s stock offering. The SEC cannot restrict an 
analyst’s ability to participate in telephone calls, e-mails, conference calls, 
or any other communication. These exclusions cover the management of 
an EGC and persons working for or with a securities firm or securities 
association.
The law states that the EGC or persons “authorized to act on behalf of an 
emerging growth company” can communicate, verbally or otherwise, with 
potential investors that are “qualified institutional buyers or institutions that 
are accredited investors.”3
Finally, the act directs the SEC to revise its rules “to provide that the prohibi-
tion against general solicitation or general advertising … shall not apply to 
offers and sales of (emerging company) securities … provided that all pur-
chasers of the securities are accredited investors.”
3An accredited investor is an individual with a high net worth and thus deemed to be 
sophisticated when it comes to financial matters.

Funding Portals
As noted earlier, crowdfunding can be defined as the process of raising equity 
or ownership capital for a startup or small business firm from a relatively large 
number of small investors. Funding portals are web sites used to facilitate the 
flow of capital from investors to crowdfunded EGCs. They are central to the 
crowdfunding process. Those providing a platform for the sale of EGC securi-
ties do not need to register with the SEC as a broker/dealer, provided they 
meet certain conditions:
• 
Even if a funding platform does not register with the 
SEC as a broker/dealer, it is still required to register with 
the SEC. It is also …subject to the SEC’s “examination, 
enforcement, and other rule-making authority.”
• 
Platforms can, under the final rules, “have a financial 
interest in an issuer that is offering or selling securi-
ties … through the intermediary’s platform, provided 
that (a) the intermediary receives the financial interest 
from the issuer as compensation for the services pro-
vided to, or for the benefit of, the issuer in connection 
with the offer or sale of such securities being offered 
or sold … through the intermediary’s platform; and (b) 
the financial interest consists of securities of the same 
class and having the same terms, conditions, and rights 
as the securities being offered or sold … through the 
intermediary’s platform.”
• 
If a platform does not register as a broker/dealer with the 
SEC, then it cannot be compensated for providing invest-
ment advice concerning the EGC securities on its own or 
other EGC portal web sites.
These rules are an effort by Congress to both protect investors and provide 
incentives for those seeking to serve as intermediaries—those who connect 
the startups and small businesses needing capital with those with money to 
invest. As long as you do not control customer money and do not recommend 
companies on your crowdfunding web site, you can avoid the complicated and 
restrictive rules that govern firms selling securities in the general marketplace. 
To protect investors, you will still need to let the SEC know who you are, 
however.

The JOBS Act
21
■
■Note  In the first edition, I noted that it seemed the law is structured so that funding 
platforms cannot make money. Two things are going on here. First, the law pushes platforms 
to register as broker/dealers, providing another advantage to an industry that has not shown 
that it deserves a new revenue stream. I quantify this advantage in later sections of this 
book, using the SEC’s estimate of the cost to create and run a platform. Second, the Title III 
rules changed to allow funding platforms to take a share of the companies that they bring 
to market. Third, while the initial rules prohibited Title III platforms from advertising, now a 
very limited set of information can be provided along with a link that refers people back to 
the intermediary platform. Issuers can compensate people for promoting an offering “outside 
of the communication channels provided by the platform” as long as that communication fits 
within this very limited set of information allowed by the advertising rule (described further in 
other chapters of this book).
The firms that have registered as platforms so far are listed later in this chapter, in Table 1-5.
Portal Requirements
Funding platforms must register with the SEC as a broker or as a funding 
portal. They must also register with one or more self-regulatory organiza-
tions, such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or another 
regulatory agency. Funding portals must also disclose EGC stock and security 
risks and provide “other investor education materials.”
According to SEC rules, a crowdfunding portal must be registered with the 
commission “either as a broker/dealer or a funding portal.” Broker/dealers 
tend to be existing securities firms that are allowed to conduct business in 
a wide range of securities and use Form BD to register with the SEC “via 
FINRA’s Central Registration Depository (CRD) system.
Crowdfunding portals register with the SEC and FINRA by using a new form, 
Form Funding Portal, through the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, 
and Retrieval (EDGAR) system. January 29, 2016 marked the opening date for 
crowdfunding portal registration with the SEC. Table 1-4 lists the registration 
details for crowdfunding portals.

Portals must take responsibility for training investors, a new requirement that 
fits well with this marketplace, given the heightened risk of investing in small 
firms. Portals will use new social media tools to fulfill this obligation. This will 
be a major factor in this marketplace.
To the extent that a startup or small firm creates a product or service that 
uniquely addresses a real market need, both customers and investors will take 
notice. Social media, such as YouTube, Facebook, and LinkedIn, will amplify this 
information. These potential network effects could be significant. If word gets 
out about a breakthrough product or service, it might be possible to raise 
significant amounts of money far faster than before. Likewise, there is also the 
risk that investors can lose money quickly. I am betting on the former, how-
ever, and I believe that “the wisdom of the crowd” will serve to limit outright 
fraud. I expect to see a number of YouTube crowdfunding channels, crowd-
funding pages on Facebook and LinkedIn, in-person seminars and webinars, 
and other efforts to educate crowdfunding investors. This effort will have the 
added benefit of teaching people about investing in general. Financial literacy 
in the United States may improve.
Portals must do more than provide information on small company investing. 
They must also certify that each crowdfunding investor using their platforms 
has reviewed and understands information on the risk of investing in small 
firms. The portals must affirm “that the (EGC) investor understands that the 
investor is risking the loss of the entire investment, and that the investor could 
bear such a loss.” They must, according to the law, make sure investors have 
the following:
• 
An understanding of the level of risk generally applicable 
to investments in startups, emerging businesses, and small 
issuers
• 
An understanding of the risk of illiquidity
• 
An understanding of such other matters as the commis-
sion determines appropriate, by rule
Funding portals must be registered with the SEC and with FINRA. Table 1-5 
lists SEC- and FINRA-registered funding portals as of July 2016.

The JOBS Act
25
Investment Restrictions
The law is clear about how much and from whom you can raise the money 
when you use crowdfunding portals. EGCs, for example, are limited to raising 
$1 million in any 12-month period. Individual investors can spend only the 
greater of $2,000 or 5 percent of their net income, if their net income is less 
than $100,000, on crowdfunded shares. If they have a net worth greater than 
$100,000, they can spend 10 percent of their net income on the stocks and 
securities of EGCs, up to a “maximum aggregate amount sold of $100,000.” 
So, if your income is $1 million, 10 percent of this would be $100,000. This 
is what you can spend on crowdfunded securities, the same amount you can 
spend if your income is $5 million.
This is an extremely important change to securities laws. You no longer need 
to be an accredited (high-net-worth) investor to get in on ground-floor oppor-
tunities to buy into startups. The law thus opens the door to regular citizens 
seeking to make investments in startup and small companies, a door that was 
previously open only to people with a lot of money. The JOBS Act does this 
while protecting small, moderate-income investors by limiting the amount of 
money they can put into these small, new, and relatively risky firms.
Small Company Risk
Potential investors in EGCs must understand something clearly: small com-
panies go out of business with great regularity. There is no guarantee that 
crowdfunding investors will see a return on their money. They need to under-
stand that they could lose their entire investment. In addition, even if they do 
not lose their money, they may not be able to access it for some time. This is 
called liquidity risk—the risk that you may not be able to get your money back 
when you need it.
Other risks will become apparent only after this market gets going, and the 
SEC will require portals to educate potential investors about them.
Fraud Prevention 
Funding portals must be concerned with fraud. They will publish background 
information on portal owners and on issuers. This information will include 
data on violations of security market regulations, if any, committed by those 
seeking crowdfunding.
■
■Note  Authenticity matters: in one case on a donations-based (not equity) crowdfunding portal, a 
family-owned business sought funding donations to save the firm. It turns out that this family had run 
several other businesses into the ground. The crowd sniffed this out and rejected the campaign.

Chapter 1 | The JOBS Act 
26
Twenty-One-Day Dissemination and Goal Meeting 
No later than 21 days after the first day on which EGC securities are sold, fund-
ing portals must “make available to the Securities and Exchange Commission 
and to potential investors any information provided by the issuer.”
Moreover, funding portals can, by law, provide funds raised to EGCs only when 
they meet their fundraising goal or target, or, in the words of the law, “when 
the aggregate capital raised from all investors is equal to or greater than a 
target offering amount.” Portals must also “allow all investors to cancel their 
commitments to invest”—to back out if they get cold feet.
EGCs thus get funds raised only if they meet or exceed their funding target. 
How might this work?
Let’s say your restaurant seeks to take advantage of a temporary opportunity; 
for example, the fact that the Super Bowl is coming to your town. You need 
$100,000 for a new storefront and equipment. You believe that, by getting 
ready now, you will significantly increase the amount of money your restaurant 
makes. You are willing to sell part of your restaurant operation to outsiders 
in exchange for the money you need. By launching a successful crowdfunding 
campaign, one that raises at least $100,000, you get that needed money. This 
might work by selling ownership shares in your restaurant for $10 each.
If you get commitments for only $90,000, the deal is off and you have to go 
home and lick your wounds. But if you get $100,000 or more, you get your 
funding and start work on renovating your restaurant.
A year later, when the Super Bowl is in town, you discover that your hunch 
was correct: your receipts are up by 50 percent because you are selling many 
more meals. Investors know this fact because you must provide them regular 
financial reports, probably via the funding portal on which you initially sold 
shares. Other small company investors read these financial reports and bid up 
the price from $10 a share to $20. They buy them from your original crowd-
funding investors. Who benefits? You are better off because you got low-cost 
financing to take advantage of an opportunity. Your original investors doubled 
their money. Your new investors believe you can do even better in the future. 
Everyone is better off.
Funding portals have an affirmative obligation to make sure that EGC inves-
tors abide by certain rules. Funding portals must make sure “that no investor 
in a 12-month period has purchased securities that, in the aggregate, from 
all issuers, exceed the investment limits set forth in (the Act).” Moreover, as 
mentioned earlier, portals must vet investors to ensure they have the income 
required to invest in what are by nature risky ventures.
This is an area of new activity. It remains to be seen how well portals will 
monitor EGCs, but, given what’s at stake, I have no doubt they will figure it out.

The JOBS Act
27
■
■Note  How will funding portals know if you have gone over the income/net worth limits in 
investing in EGCs? Service providers have been created to address this issue. Each crowdfunding 
portal is responsible for ensuring that you stay within the investing limits, however.
Privacy Issues
Funding portals must protect the privacy of information obtained from inves-
tors using their platform. While these steps are not enumerated in the law, I 
expect most funding portals will follow standard Internet privacy protocols. 
These protocols describe what personal information is collected, how it is 
used, how long it is kept, how it is protected from others, and how consum-
ers can review and, if need be, delete or dispute it. To further protect privacy, 
portals cannot pay for leads or “compensate promoters, finders, or lead gen-
erators for providing the broker or funding portal with the personal identify-
ing information of any potential investor.” This means portals cannot pay for 
e-mail lists or other types of lists.
The purpose behind this part of the law is to stop a potential spam issue. Let’s 
say you are an investor and join a portal. You make a few small investments. 
This section of the law means that third parties cannot obtain that informa-
tion and sell it to another portal or to an EGC. Were they able to do so, you 
would see a lot more junk e-mail in your inbox.
Conflict-of-Interest Prohibition
The law prohibits EGC insiders, such as “directors, officers, or partners (or 
any person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function) from 
having any financial interest in an issuer using its services.” In other words, 
EGCs cannot raise funds through a self-created, self-directed funding portal. 
You can’t create a funding portal just to raise money for your firm.
Funding portals can take EGC securities in payment for services. All compen-
sation paid to a platform must be fully disclosed, however.
Requirements for Issuers 
The crowdfunding portion of the law provides that EGCs must provide a full 
set of information to investors, funding portals, and the SEC. In addition to 
their physical address, EGCs must report detailed information on the current 
set of officers and board members; provide information on anybody with a sig-
nificant ownership interest, defined here as greater that 20 percent; describe 

Chapter 1 | The JOBS Act 
28
how the funds raised will be put to use; and provide either an income tax 
return, a financial statement prepared by a certified public accountant (CPA), 
or a set of fully audited financial statements.
In addition, EGCs must provide information on the price of the securities 
being offered, the terms (price, structure of the deal, and so forth), and the 
legal and other conditions and rules that impact these ownership stakes. EGCs 
must describe how investors might be impacted by changes in the ownership 
structure, including how much of the firm they are buying and the conditions 
under which that ownership interest may change. They must also detail the 
risks involved in purchasing shares in the company.
All this protects investors from changes that might significantly and unfairly 
reduce their share of ownership in an EGC.
Crowdfunding Regulations
The law provides the following:
• 
Issuers cannot “advertise the terms of the (EGC) offering, 
except for notices which direct investors to the funding 
portal or broker.”
• 
Issuers can compensate, directly or indirectly, persons 
for promoting security offerings if those persons use a 
communication channel provided by a “broker or fund-
ing portal” and the issuer and platform fully disclose this 
arrangement.
• 
Issuers must “ensure that such person clearly discloses 
the receipt, past or prospective, of such compensation, 
upon each instance of such promotional communication.”
• 
Issuers must file an annual report with the commission. 
These annual reports go to investors and must “provide 
to investors reports of the results of operations and 
financial statements of the issuer, as the commission shall, 
by rule, determine appropriate.”
• 
Issuers must comply with other yet-to- be determined 
SEC rules “for the protection of investors and in the pub-
lic interest.”
These are rules to protect investors. In short, the law seeks to centralize the 
distribution of final information on EGC offerings to the portal on which they 
reside. Methods used to generate interest in an EGC offering are limited, and 
issuers must disclose any compensation paid. On an annual basis, portals have 
to describe their operations in detail.

The JOBS Act
29
EGCs are liable for the amount paid for the security or for damages if the 
issuer lies about the company or makes a statement that can be regarded as 
untrue. If EGCs neglect to mention something that they should have, such 
as any information investors need to determine with accuracy the value of 
an EGC and the chance that the EGC will do well, the EGC will have to pay 
investors back.
Trading Restrictions on Crowdfunded Securities
Securities “may not be transferred by the purchaser of such securities during 
the one-year period beginning on the date of purchase, unless such securities 
are transferred as follows:
• 
To the issuer of the securities
• 
To an accredited investor
• 
As part of an offering registered with the commission
• 
To a member of the family of the purchaser or the equiv-
alent, or in connection with the death or divorce of the 
purchaser or other similar circumstance, in the discretion 
of the Commission.”
You are exempt from the trading restriction if you are
• 
On lands not subject to state or federal law (for example, 
tribal lands)
• 
Subject to SEC reporting requirements
• 
An investment company
The buyer must hold EGC securities and shares for a year, unless special 
circumstances make this unwarranted. This is to prevent manipulation and 
flipping. If I buy shares in an EGC and “pump up” the EGC by posting untrue 
or exaggerated information of the EGC’s prospects on Facebook, the price 
for the EGC share would, in all likelihood, increase. I might be able to sell my 
shares right away, before other potential EGC investors can determine the 
validity of the information I posted. To prevent this, EGC shares cannot be 
traded to the public for one year after the purchase date.
What this says is that when you buy into an EGC via crowdfunding, you are 
going to be locked into that investment for at least one year, so be careful.
■
■Caution  Buying shares of an EGC through a crowdfunding portal means (with a few exceptions) 
that you’ll need to hold the securities for at least one year before selling them.

Chapter 1 | The JOBS Act 
30
In addition, the law states that the SEC must make a special effort to reach out to 
firms owned by women, veterans, and members of minority groups with informa-
tion about crowdfunding and other elements of the JOBS Act. Crowdfunding can 
potentially level the playing field for all small businesses, opening new sources of 
business capital and revenue for women- and minority-owned firms. Such firms 
now have an opportunity to raise funds from a wide community of investors, 
some of whom are specifically interested in helping women- and minority-owned 
firms. This means these firms do not have to go through banks and other financial 
institutions that have in the past put roadblocks in their way.
While this is no panacea, crowdfunding expands business financing options 
far wider than before. It’s an option more minority- and women-owned firms 
should consider.
Important Definitions
To understand the JOBS Act, it is important to understand the terms used 
throughout the book. First among these is emerging growth company (EGC), 
defined as a company or entity with less than $1 billion in gross revenue dur-
ing its most recently completed fiscal year. The technical definition indexes 
this amount to inflation, so that, for example, what was worth a billion in 2012 
was worth only $935,754,177.80 in 2008, calculated using the consumer price 
index (CPI), an index that tracks how much more (or less) things cost over a 
month. In any case, the $1 billion figure will change slightly each year, depend-
ing on the rate of inflation.
Once designated an EGC, a firm must remain one until one of four dates:
• 
The last day of the fiscal year in which revenues exceed 
$1 billion
• 
The last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniver-
sary of the first sale on securities
• 
The date on which an EGC issues more than $1 billion in 
nonconvertible debt
• 
The date on which the issuer is deemed a large acceler-
ated filer
Let’s look at some other important definitions, in alphabetical order:
Regulation A: Securities regulations governing a “class 
of securities exempt from the registration require-
ments of the Securities Act for offerings of up to $50 
million of securities within a 12-month period.” The 
SEC expanded Regulation A into two tiers: Tier 1, for 
securities offerings of up to $20 million; and Tier 2, for 
offerings of up to $50 million.

The JOBS Act
31
Regulation A+: Securities regulations related to the pre-
ceding guidelines; Regulation (or Reg) A+ covers $20 
million to $50 million offerings under Regulation A.
Advertising rule: “An advertising notice that includes the 
terms of the offering can include no more than (1) a 
statement that the issuer is conducting an offering, the 
name of the intermediary through which the offering 
is being conducted, and a link directing the investor to 
the intermediary’s platform; (2) the terms of the offer-
ing; and (3) factual information about the legal iden-
tity and business location of the issuer, limited to the 
name of the issuer of the security, the address, phone 
number and web site of the issuer, the e-mail address 
of a representative of the issuer, and a brief descrip-
tion of the business of the issuer.” The SEC defines 
“terms of the offering to include (1) the amount of 
securities offered, (2) the nature of the securities, (3) 
the price of the securities, and (4) the closing date of 
the offering period. The permitted notices (are) simi-
lar to ‘tombstone ads’ … except that the notices will 
be required to direct an investor to the intermediary’s 
platform.”
Audited financial statement: A listing of company data 
showing what a firm owns (assets), what it owes (lia-
bilities), and what it spent (expenses), and whether it 
made or lost (income) in a given time period, most 
likely three or twelve months. An audited statement 
is a set of listings that have been reviewed by a third 
party, typically a CPA.
Broker/dealer: A firm that legally engages in the sale, 
transfer, and trading of financial securities. Broker/deal-
ers must register with the SEC and adhere to strict 
regulatory standards. They register with the SEC by 
using FINRA’s Central Registration Depository (CDR) 
system, “the central licensing and registration system 
for the US securities industry and its regulators.”
Commission: Short for the US Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC).
Company: A collection of assets, both money and peo-
ple, who associate in order to make money, in most 
cases by providing a good or a service. Companies are 
formed to carry out a specified task or tasks.

Chapter 1 | The JOBS Act 
32
Crowdfunding: A form of financing whereby people 
purchase equity securities, or ownership stakes, 
issued by a firm. The term also describes a form of 
raising money for business and product development 
whereby people make donations or contributions 
to the firm. People also crowdfund through product 
or service purchases. All methods have one thing in 
common: they provide resources to a new or existing 
product, service, firm, or company. This financing can 
take the form of equity, debt, or hybrid securities, and 
they may be completed using an Internet platform to 
handle the distribution of information, or not.
Crowdfunding campaign: Characteristics and structure 
of an effort to raise funds online. A crowdfunding 
campaign typically has a certain time length or term 
(30, 60, 90, 120 days), looks to raise a certain dollar 
amount in funding, and offers something of value to 
crowdfunding campaign participants in exchange for 
monetary contributions or investments. Most crowd-
funding campaigns include a description of the per-
sons sponsoring the effort. They may also include 
videos and pictures.
Debt: Loans made to a person or company.
Equity: An ownership stake in a company.
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA): A finan-
cial and investing market self-regulatory organization. 
FINRA regulates 3,901 securities and brokerage firms 
and the 641,561 individuals licensed, by FINRA, to sell 
securities. See www.finra.org.
Funding platform: The same as a funding portal, but may 
refer to the underlying computer technology used to 
carry out transactions and administrative tasks.
Funding portal: Also known as a crowdfunding platform 
or crowdfunding intermediary, this is a web site that 
facilitates the provision of capital or other resources 
to EGC firms.

The JOBS Act
33
Initial public offering (IPO): Common equity, or com-
mon stock, sold by an issuer under an SEC Act of 
1933 registration that has been reviewed by the SEC 
and approved. An IPO is the first time a company has 
sold ownership stakes to the public. Typically, newer, 
younger companies issue IPOs. A privately held com-
pany can also issue stock, thereby becoming publicly 
held. An investment bank or broker/dealer typically 
helps the firm issue stock by making recommenda-
tions concerning the type of security issued, the best 
time to issue it, and the price the IPO security is likely 
to fetch in the open market. An IPO is referred to as 
a public offering.4
Initial public offering date: The first date on which com-
mon equity, or common stock, is sold by an issuer 
under an effective SEC Act of 1933 registration.
Kickstarter: A Brooklyn-based reward and donations 
crowdfunding web site founded on April 28, 2009. 
Kickstarter is registered as a public-benefit corpora-
tion. According to Wikipedia, “The company’s stated 
mission is to help bring creative projects to life.”
Public company SOR trigger: An SEC-imposed reporting 
requirement that mandates the disclosure of certain 
financial and accounting information after the number 
of shareholders in a company has reached some pre-
determined (trigger) level.
Regulation D: According to the SEC, “permits issuers to 
use general solicitation and general advertising (col-
lectively, ‘general solicitation’) when conducting an 
offering … provided that all purchasers of the secu-
rities are accredited investors and the issuer takes 
reasonable steps to verify that such purchasers are 
accredited investors.”
Regulation crowdfunding: Rules adopted by the SEC to 
permit companies to offer and sell securities through 
crowdfunding.
Reporting requirement: The obligation firms have to 
provide certain financial data.

investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp#ixzz1wrZTVpwM.

Chapter 1 | The JOBS Act 
34
Research reports: Compilations of information and data 
concerning a company; issue; industry; federal, state, 
or local government entity; or other information 
used to facilitate security purchase and sale decisions. 
Research reports are typically issued by broker/deal-
ers or investment banks.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002: Also called the Public 
Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection 
Act (in the Senate) and Corporate and Auditing 
Accountability and Responsibility Act (in the House). 
It is more commonly called Sarbanes–Oxley, Sarbox, 
or SOX. Whatever you call it, it is a federal law that 
attempted to set new standards of ethical behavior 
for management, board members, and employees of 
publicly traded companies. Some have claimed that 
the law increased compliance costs and caused IPOs 
to fall. This may not be the case, however. It is just as 
likely that a decline in ethics caused the fall in IPOs. 
Small and other businesses began to believe that you 
just could not trust Wall Street, and they either went 
to the private (as opposed to public) markets or did 
not obtain capital at all. This in part explains the ele-
vated unemployment levels in the United States and 
elsewhere.
SEC: Short for the US Securities and Exchange 
Commission, the main regulatory agency charged with 
protecting the investing public.
Securities Act of 1933: The law, modified by the JOBS 
Act, governing the sale of company ownership and 
loan interests or securities using the “means and 
instrumentalities of interstate commerce.” All such 
offers and sales must be registered with the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission. The law, which 
regulates original-issue market activities, attempts to 
ensure that security buyers are fully informed before 
purchasing securities.
Securities Exchange Act of 1934: Governs what happens 
after you buy a security and wish to trade it. It estab-
lishes the rules for the secondary trading of securities. 
The 1934 act also established the SEC.

The JOBS Act
35
Self-regulatory organizations(SROs): Investment industry 
companies and individuals who come together to gov-
ern their business activities. There is currently a single 
financial industry self-regulatory organization in the 
United States, FINRA.
Summary
The JOBS Act significantly changes to the rules governing the ways that com-
panies raise money through the securities markets. Among other things, the 
act allows companies to raise more in “private placements” than in the past 
before having to register securities with the SEC, it allows companies to raise 
money through crowdfunding, and it loosens the rules regarding the adver-
tisement of securities before they are sold.
Rules implementing this law have now been written and applied. This book, the 
Second Edition, describes those rules in an effort to help innovators, entrepre-
neurs, and others use the law as envisioned. The rules took time to implement 
because of the successful efforts by financial industry representatives, tied to 
the old way of doing things, to block or slow the use of the new capital-raising 
freedoms granted by the act.
The bottom line is this: given the financial crisis, the SEC imposed the old 
regulatory framework—the 1933 and 1934 acts, a framework of questionable 
effectiveness—onto new technology. This may be akin to pouring new wine 
into old wineskins. (I hope not.) Even if the long-term effectiveness of this 
approach remains unclear, this book will help guide you through the regula-
tions as they exist today.
The hope behind the law remains an expectation that innovators and entre-
preneurs will now find it far easier to raise capital and thus create jobs and 
prosperity for many. I remain optimistic for reasons I detail in the next chapter, 
which describes supply and demand for capital conditions in the startup and 
small business financing marketplace.

Startup 
Financing 
Environment
Is the JOBS Act Still Needed?
I hope this chapter provides some of the rationale for the optimism expressed 
at the end of Chapter 1. Financing a startup is difficult. The financial crisis 
made this task all the more challenging. But, with the addition of the financing 
options allowed under the JOBS Act, I believe the task of financing a startup or 
existing business may be, at the margin, easier, and this is all most true entre-
preneurs need—a little daylight.
Even with a strengthening market, you might ask whether the JOBS Act is 
still needed. There is no question that, had the SEC moved to make JOBS 
Act crowdfunding available sooner, the impact would have been greater. As 
noted in the preceding chapter, the SEC was terribly late in implementing 
the provisions of Title III. Over that interval, unemployment, which stood at 
7.5 percent in April 2012, when the JOBS Act was enacted, fell to 4.9 percent 
2

Chapter 2 | Startup Financing Environment
38
by November 2016. By then, 170 firms had taken advantage of the Title III 
provisions of the JOBS Act to seek up to $1 million in capital. Although ris-
ing employment is always a good thing, I maintain that many who would have 
created new, small, innovative products and companies are now working for 
someone else.
This may not appear to be a reason for optimism, but it is: with declining levels 
of unemployment, the quality of JOBS Act crowdfunding campaigns should go 
up. In addition, I think the JOBS Act will benefit society by allowing access for 
those who have been shut out of the small business financing market.
Different groups have differing levels of access to capital. Much of this is based 
on gender and race: “A study conducted by CB Insights in 2010 examined the 
disparity in the amount of venture capital funding for Silicon Valley companies 
founded by minorities and women as compared to companies founded by 
Caucasians. The study found that while less than 1 percent of venture-capital-
backed company founders were African-American and 12 percent were Asian, 
83 percent had a racial composition that was entirely Caucasian.”1
But there is no question that the market for startup financing has recovered and 
recovered well. I believe further improvements are possible and that the JOBS 
Act has and will continue to help. This chapter surveys what changed in the 
overall small business financing market environment between 2012 and 2016.
Capital is always an issue—always—and while there are those for whom money 
is not an issue, they are the exception. Even large companies, with millions in rev-
enue and thousands of customers, saw their lines of credit reduced, or eliminated 
overnight, by banks claiming that they were required to do so by regulators. When 
banks are told to reduce risk, small businesses, especially startups, are the first to 
see credit eliminated or reduced—and lenders claim that this is an appropriate 
response to new regulatory guidelines that they helped cause.
We’re still not buying it. In response to being told to reduce risk, there is no 
reason to start by clamping down on small business credit. While banks are 
denying needed small business credit and not helping others issue IPOs, they 
continue to engage in risky, unethical behavior. A large global bank, Barclays, 
paid “$100 million to … settle (charges that) false rate submissions … inflated 
borrowing costs linked to the London and US dollar interbank offered rates.”2 
In the same month of August 2016, another bank, Goldman Sachs, was fined

$36.3 million “after regulators found the firm improperly used confiden-
tial information to try to win business.”3 They paid that fine because they  
were trying to maximize profit, and bonuses, in a big way. (That’s a total of 
$136 million in fines. Imagine $136 million going, at $50,000 each, to help 
2,720 small businesses get off the ground.)
And, consider this: “For years, Wells Fargo employees secretly issued credit 
cards without a customer’s consent. They created fake e-mail accounts to 
sign up customers for online banking services. They set up sham accounts 
that customers learned about only after they started accumulating fees.”4 The 
bank was fined $185 million, enough to fund another 3,700 small businesses 
and startups at $50,000 each. Yikes!
Something must be done. Well, finally, there’s a way startups can avoid being 
at the mercy of rigged interest rates, unethical financial institutions, misguided 
banking policy, and lax regulatory enforcement. The JOBS Act offers a power-
ful set of tools startups can use to bypass traditional business funding sources: 
crowdfunding.
■
■Note  People have dreams. They have needs. They have talent and will create companies to 
make use of that talent and, in the process, fulfill those dreams. Crowdfunding is the result. The 
combination of an unresponsive financial sector, technology that allows anyone to eliminate the 
need for a middleman, and the optimistic and caring nature of the American people all serve to 
make this an exciting time.
Startup Financing Marketplace Recovering
Statistics indicate that the business-financing and startup-financing environ-
ment is rebounding. New data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 
provides perhaps the best information available on the rate of new business 
creation and the employment impact from new firms. Figure 2-1 draws data 
from the BLS Business Employment Dynamics (BED) program, which provides 
“insight on the contribution of young and small businesses to the overall num-
ber of businesses and jobs in the economy.”

Figure  2-1 shows both the number of new (less than one year old) busi-
nesses started (left axis) and the number of jobs they have created (black line, 
right axis). It shows that the number of jobs created by firms less than one 
year old have “decreased from 4.1 million in 1994, when this series began, to  
3 million in 2015.” (We suspect technology has something to do with this 
decline. Startups need fewer people now that they did in 1994.)
While the number of jobs created by startups has declined from the 4.7 million 
peak in 1999, the number of new companies starting up has increased, growing 
from a low of 560,000 in 2010 to 679,000 by 2015. This led to the creation of 
3 million jobs in 2015. The JOBS Act and the implementing regulations put in 
place by the SEC will support this trend.
How We Got Here: Impact of the Market 
Crisis on the IPO Market
Investment bankers often justify their outsized compensation by claiming 
that they exist to serve the public by providing capital to new companies, 
and that by bringing new companies to market, they increase economic 
activity and provide for the social good. Let’s test that theory by taking a 
look at some additional information related to the investment banker’s claim 
to social good.

The JOBS Act
41
■
■Note  Initial public offerings (IPOs) have been a primary way companies have raised significant 
amounts of equity capital. This money is ostensibly used to help the company grow (or to repay 
debt, thereby eliminating a burden and also setting the stage for corporate growth), and, unlike 
a loan, does not have to be repaid at fixed terms or with interest. Those providing capital to the 
company, investors, depend on the stock market to set the subsequent price for the stock and, in 
turn, the value of the company selling the shares. The Bank of North America (chartered in 1781 
and now Wells Fargo) launched the first IPO in the United States. As of July 2012, the largest IPO 
ever was the $22 billion Agricultural Bank of China offering in 2010. The $1 million annual JOBS 
Act fundraising limit represents 0.005 percent of this amount.
Over the last ten years, the number of companies raising capital through the 
issuance of stock in the public securities markets has declined dramatically. 
According to the “2016 IPO Report” published by Wilmer Cutler Pickering 
Hale and Dorr, a law firm, “the 2015 IPO market produced 152 IPOs, a disap-
pointing tally that lagged well behind the 244 IPOs in 2014.”5 The firm goes 
on to note that gross proceeds (which refers to the amount of money raised) 
and the median offering size fell for 2015, both explained, in part, by the overall 
dominance of IPOs by EGCs.
■
■Note  What are the chances that that these figures are misleading? Perhaps companies simply 
turned to private market transactions to raise needed equity. These are transactions between a 
company and private individuals, instead of between a company and the public. Others have 
claimed that “the JOBS Act has led to a resurgence in the IPO market, with some 85 percent of 
companies completing an IPO since April 2012 filing as emerging growth companies.”6
Both claims, in my view, are likely to be false. The Wells Fargo scandal shows that large financial 
institutions are still not to be trusted and that there is a role for efficient, effective regulation. What 
is unquestioned is that small companies are responsible for most of the new jobs created in the 
US economy.
In addition, the number of IPO offerings that are less than $50 million has 
been growing as a percentage of all IPOs, as shown in Figure 2-2.

The JOBS Act
43
Before the financial crisis, investment banks turned away from the IPO market 
in favor of proprietary trading and other products that were easier to profit 
from. And it’s not that it was a bad time to do IPOs. According to the IPO 
Task Force, a group of “venture capitalists, experienced CEOs, public investors, 
securities lawyers, academicians, and investment bankers” gathered by the US 
Department of the Treasury in 2011 to study IPO market conditions, inves-
tors know that IPOs tend to perform well. It’s just that they cannot get IPO 
shares fairly or regularly. And there has been a lack of research and data on 
companies issuing IPOs.
In addition to denying deserving companies funding, this behavior damaged 
the competitive position of the United States As US investment banks turned 
away from this market, companies seeking IPO-generated capital took their 
business overseas. As the IPO Task Force noted, “US companies raised only 
15 percent of global IPO proceeds in 2010, down from an average 28 percent 
over the preceding ten years.” This behavior is not only damaging to compa-
nies denied capital; it is damaging to workers. According to the IPO Task Force, 
“92 percent of job growth in a company occurs post-IPO.”7
Also, as the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness noted, had the 
United States “maintained the same level of startup activity that we witnessed 
in 2007, we would have nearly two million more jobs than we have today.”8
Venture Capital and Angel Investing
In this section, we quickly review the main sources, for some, of startup capi-
tal. Many point to venture capital and angel investing as potential sources of 
funding for startups and small businesses. Charts and tables presented in this 
section give some perspective on these two sources.
Venture capital is often cited as a readily available, realistic source of capital for 
startups and small businesses, especially those involved in technology-related 
fields. I think this is incorrect. Venture capital is a form of ownership, or equity, 
investing “provided … to small, early-stage, emerging firms.” These are the 
same firms the JOBS Act seeks to serve. Looking at the data for 2014, shown 
in Figure 2-4, venture capitalists invested $49 billion in startups and small busi-
nesses. Only 3,665 companies and startups were funded, however, and the 
average venture capital investment totaled $13 million.

Angel investing operates with the same intention as venture capital investing, 
just at a much smaller, much more personal scale. Typically, an angel investor is 
a wealthy individual or group of individuals who provide ownership, or equity, 
investments to a business or startup. Angel investors may also provide loan 
financing, usually in the form of debt convertible into ownership stakes, or 
equity. As Figure 2-4 shows, angel investors provided $24 billion to 73,400 
companies in 2014.

webform/2014%20Analysis%20Report.pdf.)
While these numbers are impressive, as shown in the next chapter, many 
deserving companies simply cannot access these capital sources. Even with 
this performance, Figure 2-5 shows that only 34 percent of venture capital 
funding goes to companies in either the early stage (defined as firms less than 
three years old that are still testing or developing their products or services) 
or the seed stage (defined as “early financing …directed toward product 
development, market research, building a management team, and developing a 
business plan”9).

The JOBS Act and crowdfunding has the potential to reach many more with a 
decidedly larger impact.
Comparing the United States to China 
One source, the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), conducted its 17th 
annual survey of the environmental environment in 2016. The survey rates 
entrepreneurial activity around the globe.
GEM, an impressive and comprehensive survey tool, “interviewed adults (18–
64 years of age) in 60 economies, spanning diverse geographies and a range 
of development levels.” Based on this source, Figure 2-6 compares early-stage 
entrepreneurial activity in China with that in the United States. The chart 
shows that although entrepreneurial activity is higher in China than in the 
United States right now, the differences are not stark.

■Note  China now leads the world in energy consumption, and energy consumption is a leading 
economic indicator. It is only a matter of time before China’s economy surpasses that of the United 
States in size. Of course, this may change if enough US companies use crowdfunding.
Additional Factors Impacting Startups
In their 2016 report, GEM noted, “The long-term effects of the US financial 
crisis and the continuing global downturn continue to be felt worldwide.” 
These factors serve to reduce the amount of capital available for new-busi-
ness financing. While the housing crisis reduced the amount of capital that 
entrepreneurs can access, recovery in this sector may bode well for future 
activity, since startups are financed via home-equity loans. As the Department 
of Commerce notes, “homes provide collateral, and home-equity loans pro-
vide relatively low-cost financing.”
Figure 2-7 shows the change in the value of homes in the United States from 
2002 to 2016.

The JOBS Act
47
Home equity provides a significant portion of a person’s net worth, and, again, 
according to the Department of Commerce, “most studies find that asset lev-
els (for example, net worth) measured in one year increase the probability of 
starting a business by the following year. The finding has generally been inter-
preted as providing evidence that entrepreneurs face liquidity constraints.” 
Yet, despite the environment, a significant number of people want to own their 
own business. The pull to the path to financial freedom through successful 
entrepreneurship is strong, even with the financial crisis.
What the JOBS Act Does
Using new capital-raising techniques to start a business, the JOBS Act removes 
or eases at least one liquidity constraint or barrier. It seeks to open domestic 
capital markets to small businesses, and to reform and repair IPO market-
access mechanisms.
■
■Note  Access and motivation are two critical parts of the entrepreneurship puzzle. The JOBS Act 
is unparalleled in its ability to address critical issues in this area. Entrepreneurs will self-identify, and 
the act, by allowing access to capital via crowdfunding, will help motivate potential small business 
owners. As more and more small business projects are crowdfunded and become successful, we expect 
attitudes in the broader US society to change to show increased support for entrepreneurship.

Amended in this way for the first time since enactment, the SEC acts of 1933 
and 1934 create a new category of securities issuer: emerging growth compa-
nies. As noted, these are issuers with less than $1 billion in sales or revenue. 
As you saw in the preceding chapter, the act exempts these firms, temporarily, 
from certain regulatory requirements when issuing equity in regulated capital 
markets. While exempt initially, EGCs become subject to all regulatory bur-
dens after five years. Reaching $1 billion in revenue and having a public float—
market capitalization—of greater than $700 million are the only two other 
events that trigger the formerly exempted regulatory requirements.
The idea is that, after five years, reaching $1 billion in revenue, or having a 
market valuation of $700 million, an EGC will be larger, have more employees, 
and thus be better able to handle reporting requirements. The law assumes 
(correctly) that these reporting requirements are expensive, in both money 
and time. Thus, the law establishes a “growth window” during which EGCs are 
exempt from certain regulatory requirements.
From Which Regulations Are EGCs Exempt?
EGCs get relief from only selected security market regulations. I presented 
the basic facts on some of these regulations in Chapter 1. What follows is an 
elaboration on the more important aspects.
Audited Statements
The JOBS Act mandates that EGCs must provide audited financial statements 
for two, not three, years prior to stock issuance. One year after issuing stock, 
an EGC would be required to provide three years of financial data, if these exist.
Financial Reporting
The JOBS Act exempts EGCs from accounting and financial reporting rules, man-
dated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), requiring 
“mandatory audit firm rotation.” This means that EGCs are not required to 
change auditors from one that knows the firm to one that does not.
Marketing
To help determine the probability that EGC offerings will be successful, the 
JOBS Act allows EGCs to canvass and communicate with qualified and insti-
tutional investors. Before the sale, EGCs must still provide a prospectus to 
potential investors.

The JOBS Act
49
Regulatory Initiatives
EGCs are also exempt for certain provisions of more recent financial market 
regulatory initiatives. ECGs do not have to hold a “nonbinding stockholder 
vote on executive compensation arrangements.” They also do not need to 
calculate and report the “median compensation of all employees compared 
to that of the CEO.”
Perhaps the most interesting thing is that the JOBS Act exempts EGCs from 
restrictions concerning the flow of information to investors from security 
analysts about these firms. Currently, investment banks and brokers cannot 
publish research on a specific EGC while offering that company’s stock. Now, 
investors can receive EGC research reports “before or at the same time as 
its IPO.”
Sarbanes-Oxley
Section 404(b) of the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-204) 
“requires a publicly held company’s auditor to attest to, and report on, man-
agement’s assessment of its internal controls.” Publicly traded firms must 
assess how effective inside controls over financial and accounting reports 
are in identifying and describing potential fraud. This internal evaluation must 
be reviewed and certified by outside auditors. SOX 404 requires that pub-
licly traded companies “establish and maintain internal controls over financial 
reporting.” EGCs, under the JOBS Act, have up to five years to put into place 
these audit procedures.
The chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO) of EGCs 
must still certify that the EGC’s financial statements are accurate. Internal 
financial reporting controls are still required. These internal controls do not 
need to be reviewed and certified by outside auditors, however, for up to five 
years.
Section 501
To protect the investing public, Section 501 of SOX remains in place. Section 
501 requires the SEC to deal with and mitigate “potential conflicts of interest 
that may arise when research analysts recommend equity securities.”10

Startups Act and Its Impact on Equity Research Analysts,” Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & 
Jacobson LLP, May 18, 2012, www.friedfrank.com.

Chapter 2 | Startup Financing Environment
50
To facilitate this activity, the JOBS Act allows EGCs to submit a preliminary 
confidential registration statement with the SEC. Although the SEC can begin 
to evaluate EGC registration statements prior to an IPO launch, an EGC must 
wait at least 21 days before soliciting potential investors en masse via road 
shows, defined as “a presentation by an issuer of securities to potential buyers 
intended to create interest in the securities.”11
Summary
The JOBS Act is a much-needed shot in the arm for US entrepreneurs. These 
individuals have been suffering greatly because of a banking system that ignored 
them in favor of easier profits, a regulatory system that let the banks do so, a 
housing crisis, and an increasingly competitive international climate.
In the next chapter, we dig a little deeper and take a look at EGCs, the primary 
intended beneficiaries of the JOBS Act. This starts our foray into the details 
of the JOBS Act.

Emerging 
Growth 
Companies
Facts, Figures, and Potential
The JOBS Act defines emerging growth companies (EGCs) in the United States 
as firms with less than $1 billion in revenue. The act targets these firms, allow-
ing them to raise up to $1 million by selling ownership stakes (equity capital), 
or taking on debt (loans) via crowdfunding. These firms can raise a maximum 
of $1 million on an annual basis.
In this chapter, you’ll examine the potential EGC market in general. At the 
end of the chapter, you’ll see how EGC firms have used existing crowdfunding 
platforms to raise donations, and in a few cases, equity, now that the JOBS Act 
has gone into effect. This will help you better understand how these platforms 
help EGCs gain funding.
This analysis of the emerging growth company market has been confirmed by 
data from ReferenceUSA, a firm that collects emerging company information 
from “hundreds of thousands of public information sources.” ReferenceUSA’s

staff “analyzes and verifies every record and compiles all the information” into 
“the most up-to-date data available. … Business and consumer databases are 
continuously updated.”
For our purposes, I have decided to use verified data on 16 million US busi-
nesses. While this lowers the number of firms in the analysis, I feel the increase 
in accuracy get us closer to the answer we seek, namely, how many emerging 
growth companies are there in the United States?
If you are a potential investor, information on the nature of the potential 
investment universe will help you allocate capital. If you are a service provider 
looking to help emerging growth companies as they raise capital via the JOBS 
Act, knowing the number of potential clients out there is of interest. If you 
are an emerging growth company considering raising capital via the JOBS Act, 
I suspect you want to know the number of potential competitors you have.

Figure 3-1 confirms that the EGC market, representing 99.98 percent of the 
firms in the United States, is also vibrant. Nearly half (48 percent) of US firms 
provide some kind of service. Firms involved in retail trade, at 20 percent of 
the total, are also well represented. Construction, at 7 percent of all US firms, 
is a significant part of the picture.

Figure 3-2.  Billion-dollar companies in the United States, by industry.  
(Data source: ReferenceUSA.)
The data seems to suggest that certain industries are more likely to have firms 
that grow to be $1 billion in size, but I caution against drawing this conclu-
sion. When looking at Figure 3-3, keep in mind that the data may simply be 
reflecting economy-of-scale factors. Certain industries are dominated by large 
firms. Manufacturing is a good example. In certain industries, equipment costs 
support the development of billion-dollar firms. There may be fewer billion-
dollar firms in the services category, relatively speaking, because equipment 
and other requirements are minimal.

Although no hard-and-fast rules can be established by this analysis, it suggests 
that investors looking to invest in a company that might grow to be a billion-
dollar company might want to consider the factors reflected in the preceding 
data. (The US Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, still uses the SIC 
codes to classify companies in its database of firms that have issued securities, 
including securities covered by the JOBS Act, by the way.)
Emerging Growth Companies in the United 
States by Revenue
Figure 3-3 shows the number of emerging growth companies in the United 
States, by revenue, for several significant categories.
This graph shows that most firms in the United States are small, with less than 
$500,000 in annual revenue. The EGC market is very large, so if you are an 
investor, a service provider, or an EGC, opportunities offered by the JOBS Act 
are also large. Nearly all firms in the United States—99.9 percent—have the 
ability to take advantage of the JOBS Act to raise capital.
Table 3-2 shows the number of emerging growth companies in 2016 by state.

Texas, California, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Ohio all have more than 
200 billion-dollar companies.
■
■Tip  States will have an opportunity to develop specialized rules for EGCs seeking to raise 
capital via crowdfunding. I expect to see competition between states to encourage EGCs to stay or 
locate in their area. If you are thinking of raising capital as an EGC, be sure to explore the incentives 
your state is offering.
While the geographic distribution of firms is both important and interesting, 
note that these companies are everywhere. Also note that the number of 
firms may not be as important as the general rate of entrepreneurial activity 
in a state or region.
■
■Note  The total number of firms as shown in Tables 3-2 and 3-3 may be different from totals 
shown in Table 3-1 due to rounding and classification issues.
The potential EGC market is large—very large. If each EGC issued $1 million 
in equity, the resulting market would total $12 trillion in capital. But we don’t 
have to dream this large. Even $1 trillion in equity offerings would forever 
alter the size, scale, scope, and nature of the small business market in the 
United States. Of course, I suspect that most of these firms have no interest 
in raising $1 million in capital, and many are far too small for an offering of this 
size to make sense. But the numbers give you some idea of how many firms 
fit the definition established by Congress, so this is the total market potential.
In an earlier section of this chapter, you saw that firms reporting less than $50 
million in revenue totaled 12,807,781—probably a better indication of true 
future crowdfunding market activity. For now, we will continue to follow the 
Congressional definition of the EGC marketplace.
■
■Tip  EGCs are everywhere. The data in the preceding tables show the type of competition 
you may face in your industry and your region. Understand, however, that this is no barrier to your 
raising funds. Your success depends upon your efforts, your network, your story.
Figure 3-4 combines 2016 data from ReferenceUSA on the number of EGCs 
by state with 2015 data from the Kauffman Foundation showing the level of 
entrepreneurial activity by state. The chart maps the number of EGC firms in 
a given state with an indicator showing the level of entrepreneurial activity in

59
that state. The chart shows that, in general, having a large number of EGCs in 
a state is positively related to entrepreneurial activity in that state. This may 
be due to an increase in opportunities for entrepreneurial activity: the larger 
the set of firms, the more choice an entrepreneur has in terms of the potential 
entrepreneurial activity.

Expect activity to increase, after some time, in highly entrepreneurial indus-
tries, such as the construction industry, because of crowdfunding. It is conceiv-
able that social service businesses, such as child and senior care centers, will 
also see an increase in the number of firms in these industries. According to 
the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, the construction and the ser-
vices sectors have the highest rates of entrepreneurial activity.
Figure 3-5 gives a sense of the change in entrepreneurial activity, by state, 
between 2011 and 2015. Activity is, in general, slightly lower. As I noted earlier, 
this may be due to the improving labor market and the reduction in the supply 
of potential entrepreneurs this implies.

As the Bureau of Labor Statistics notes,
Entrepreneurship plays a vital role in the growth of the US economy. As 
the primary source for information on the nation’s labor market, the U.S. 
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects data on new businesses and job 
creation.

The JOBS Act
63
Potential Impact on Jobs
As I noted in the first edition, if every EGC firm used crowdfunding to hire 
just one more person, millions of new jobs would be created, a number that 
shows the potential for this law to change the nature of small business activity 
in the country.
It is conceivable that the law will have the biggest impact on smaller indus-
tries and in smaller states. Why? Firms in these industries and states typically 
have a more difficult time raising capital. The potential for growth and the 
potential for developing new and more highly effective business approaches 
will be higher in these “backwater” states and industries. New data supports 
this claim.
BLS notes that there have been fewer new businesses and correspondingly 
fewer new jobs created: “The number of jobs created by establishments less 
than 1 year old has decreased from 4.1 million in 1994 (when first started col-
lecting this data) to 3 million in 2015.” Figure 3-6 depicts this trend.

Chapter 3 | Emerging Growth Companies
64
Note the uptick starting in 2010. This is a hopeful sign, one that JOBS Act 
crowdfunding may bolster. Given, as noted in Chapter 2, changes in technology 
leading to increased productivity, we do not expect to get to the levels seen 
in 1998 or 1999 anytime soon, but having a tool like the JOBS Act supports 
this recent trend.
Also important are new, higher limits on money raised in more-conventional 
ways. The JOBS Act allows firms to raise money by using what are called 
Regulation A and Regulation D exemptions. Under the former, companies can 
now raise $50 million in capital, increased from $5 million. As to the latter, 
as one law firm noted, “Regulation D prohibited the general solicitation or 
advertisement of securities in Rule 506 offerings. Thus, issuers needed to have 
some preexisting relationship with potential purchasers before conducting 
a private placement. Title II of the JOBS Act has reversed that limitation to 
allow for the general solicitation and advertisement of a Rule 506 offering, as 
long as all ultimate purchasers are accredited investors.”1 These rule changes 
have the potential to allow companies to create a lot of jobs.
Of course, these two exemptions differ from crowdfunding. They are changes 
to existing exemptions and do not create a new class of small business firms 
and funding intermediaries. Even with these more generous provisions, the 
real fun and action is likely to be with EGCs on crowdfunding web sites.
Crowdfunding Examples
Of course, what is exciting about the JOBS Act is the potential it has to sig-
nificantly increase the number of small businesses operating in the United 
States. Donations-based crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo 
have developed a record of assisting small ventures in their search for capital. 
We now add to these sites the FINRA-approved equity crowdfunding sites 
listed in Chapter 2.
To understand the businesses behind the preceding numbers this section 
presents a summary of several firms that have already raised capital by using 
both donations-based and debt/equity crowdfunding. I have more to say in 
Chapter 5, but in order to help you understand the truly revolutionary poten-
tial of this new financing mechanism, here I summarize the experiences of a 
few early adopters. Also please note the distinction between donations and 
equity. Although some of these firms are raising equity capital via the JOBS Act, 
some are not. I specify which are raising capital under the JOBS Act. These 
are issuing securities or selling equity stakes in their businesses. Others are

seeking donations, or selling a product. Still, this is a useful precursor to equity 
crowdfunding.
■
■Note  These are early adopters, some of the first and most successful crowdfunding examples. 
They are, by definition, exceptions. The key takeaway is this: crowdfunding is the last step, not the 
first one, in raising capital online. You must bring the crowd with you.

Beta Bionics and the Artificial Pancreas
The first company to successfully raise $1 million via Title III equity crowd-
funding was Beta Bionics. Figure 3-7 shows the company’s crowdfunding page. 
According to news reports, “775 members of the public (invested) an average 
of $1,300 each.”
Figure 3-7.  Beta Bionics crowdfunding campaign
Beta Bionics describes itself as a “public benefit corporation.” The firm is char-
tered “to act in the best interests of people with type 1 diabetes, including at 
the expense of short-term profits.”
Beta Bionics is not a typical JOBS Act Title III equity crowdfunding company, but 
it does suggest factors that are important. Prior to the launch of its campaign, 
the firm had attracted a marquee name and investor in the drug company Eli 
Lilly, which “previously purchased a 5 percent stake for $5 million. Lilly’s invest-
ment served to set the overall value of the startup at $100 million.”
Further, many of the initial Title III crowdfunding investors are “scientists or 
people involved with diabetes research.” These are industry insiders whose 
participation validates the firm as being legitimate.
Unlike donations-based crowdfunding campaigns, this campaign offered rewards 
to investors in the form of cold, hard cash—possibly a lot of cash—along with 
a warm feeling from helping make life better for people with type 1 diabetes.
But Title III is not the only way you can use the JOBS Act to raise money. 
There is also Title IV, which allows you to raise up to $50 million. Let’s take a 
look at a Title IV campaign that has gotten a lot of attention.

Another company to successfully raise $1 million via equity crowdfunding was 
BrewDog brewery, but this example is a little different. The company is seek-
ing to raise $50 million under a different section of the JOBS Act, Title IV. They 
are offering shares via Regulation A+. See Figure 3-8.

Donation and Reward-Based Crowdfunding 
Campaigns
The firms detailed in this section are not raising capital under the JOBS Act, 
since they are not issuing securities or selling equity stakes in their businesses. 
They are instead seeking donations or selling a product. The existence of 
these sites, and their usefulness to young businesses, paved the way for the 
JOBS Act and its crowdfunding sections.
Pebble: E-Paper Watch for iPhone and Android 
Perhaps the prototypical emerging growth company is Pebble Technology 
(Figure 3-9). The most successful crowdfunding initiative to date has been 
its Pebble Watch campaign. The watch connects wirelessly to a smartphone 
and serves as an on-the-wrist notification center. On December 1, 2016, news 
reports indicated that fitness wearable maker Fitbit was set to acquire Pebble 
Watch for “between $34 and $40 million.”2

The vertical axis shows the number of rewards. The horizontal axis shows  
the various rewards and the dollar amount required for each. The boxes at the  
top of each bar represent the number of rewards taken. You can imagine the 
Pebble Watch company granting equity ownership stakes instead of or in addi-
tion to selling crowdfunding campaign participants a watch.
Launched with a goal of raising $100,000, the campaign ultimately raised 
$10,266,845 from 68,929 backers, or “investors.” These individuals preor-
dered one or more of the watches or paid $1 simply to be updated on the 
product’s progress. Table 3-8 lists the perk, or sales, list for the watch, showing 
what contributors got for participating in the fundraising.

Coolest Cooler
Pebble Watch was a surprise Kickstarter hit. An even bigger surprise was the 
Coolest Cooler campaign, launched to provide funding for the creation and 
manufacturing of a “souped up” food and beverage cooler. The unit contains a 
USB charger, a battery, Bluetooth speakers, an LED light, a bottle opener and 
a corkscrew, a built-in blender, and other useful features. The campaign raised 
$13 million in 90 days. See Figure 3-11 and Table 3-9.

The product, shown in Figure 3-11, has been beset with delivery and perfor-
mance issues. Crowdfunding campaign participants, called backers, are not happy:
August 15, 2016: You guys are the worst. Where is my cooler. I am going 
to start the worst cooler campaign on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and 
Instagram if I don’t get my cooler pronto. Don’t ask us to help you sell 
more of what you can't ship. This is a HORRIBLE campaign. E-mail me 
the ship date.
August 14, 2016: Can anyone help me sync the speaker? I can’t get it to 
work with my iPhone.
August 14, 2016: Okay, I am backer 2,629—can we at least have some 
idea of how the rest of us are going to be filled? I think the BS about 
shipping by area code or some mythical subdivision of the USA doesn’t fly 
in 2016. I think backers would be happy to see orders filled as they were 
received, i.e., hopefully the first backer (#1) has been filled. I think if we 
could see numbers of orders filled and some kind of accounting of orders 
filled, that would at least let people see where they stand. I placed my pledge 
on August 29th, 2014. Coming up for my two-year anniversary of no cooler!
Clearly, the creators of the campaign had a difficult time. I suspect they were 
caught by surprise and did not plan on having the volume of orders gener-
ated. What is important to note here is how quickly and how complete the 
customer service (or lack thereof) record is. There is no place to hide in the 
crowdfunding process, especially in the age of the Internet. If you do not meet 
customer expectations, they will not hesitate to let others know, in graphic 
detail, repeatedly, about your shortcomings.

Coolest + Swag: You get your Coolest cooler, along with the cozy Keep Calm and 
Blend On shirt, party cup, and Blended Drink Guide.

whatever—for two 30-minute sessions to discuss your project, idea, or anything

10 Coolest Coolers: Maybe you host the biggest outdoor parties, or maybe you 
have nine best friends. Either way, you can buy a bunch and save some cash. 
We’ll reach out for your address and get you a shipping estimate prior to the 
end of the campaign.
$2,000
Coolest Bartender: I will personally fly out to your hometown and man your bar at 
your next event with the only Coolest fully functional prototype in the world. If

anyone else, then this reward is for you.

The JOBS Act
75
While several commenters on the campaign’s Kickstarter page threatened 
legal action, there is actually little that campaign contributors and sponsors 
can do. It’s not that the campaign was fraudulent. The business is legitimate, 
just not very good a delivering products on time. The product exists, but the 
company has been trying to do something quite difficult, and all product flaws 
have not been worked out yet.
■
■Note  As crowdfunding grows, expect more legal actions to be initiated by the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC) and the SEC against crowdfunding campaigns deemed to be either fraudulent 
or deceptive.
If fact, legal action has been taken in only a few crowdfunding campaigns. In June 
2015, the Federal Trade Commission settled with a Kickstarter crowdfunding 
campaign creator who raised $122,000 to create a board game. The FTC 
claimed that no work was ever done on the project, however, and required 
the creator to refund all money collected. It is unclear how many backers 
received refunds.
While serving to generate excitement, such funding success (and difficulty) 
is not typical. I expect most EGCs raising money over the Internet to more 
closely resemble the two firms described next.
East Harlem Café 
On crowdfunding web site Indiegogo, Michelle Cruz, owner of the East Harlem 
Café, successfully raised $10,050 to purchase “kitchen storage, supplies, and 
food prep equipment.” Rather than going to a bank, Cruz turned to members 
of her community, via Indiegogo, to get the money she needed.
Because the JOBS Act was not signed when this campaign was undertaken, it 
was, technically, illegal to raise equity financing over the Internet. Instead, East 
Harlem Café offered a range of goods and services to those supporting the 
store via a cash donation. These are described in Table 3-10 and ranged from 
a “huge thank you” for a $1 donation, to a large coffee for a $10 donation, to 
an “all of the above” gift basket that included everything offered to funders, 
plus exclusive use of the café’s space for two hours.

The campaign was ultimately successful, raising $10,050 from 147 “investors.”
What is important about this example is that is shows how a local firm, pro-
viding a high level of service to a specific community, can engage people quickly 
and efficiently to obtain the funds needed. It goes without saying that the alter-
native funding source was a bank loan or a credit card. This firm was able to 
raise funds in less time than it would have taken them to get a bank loan and 
to reach out to customers, thereby generating an increase in revenue.
Simple. Honest. Effective. This will be the way most successful crowdfunders 
approach the market.

La Casa Azul Bookstore 
La Casa Azul is an independent bookstore in East Harlem. This firm sought 
$40,000 and raised $34,503 from 433 “funders.” La Casa Azul is an example of 
another community-based business that energized its customer base to help 
the firm financially
Both campaigns raised far less than the $1 million annual crowdfunding equity 
maximum now allowed by the JOBS Act. They also raised money in exchange 
for goods and/or services, not equity. Yet, these early campaigns show how 
community businesses can raise significant amounts of money online, bypass-
ing banks and other financial institutions and speaking directly with customers, 
in an engaging and truly remarkable way.
Summary
Emerging growth companies, as defined by the JOBS Act, are, like the coun-
try itself, a wildly varied lot. EGCs encompass everything from biotechnology 
firms with $100 million in venture capital funding to the hair salon next door. 
Every industry, every region, every city, and every block hosts a potential EGC.
But there is strength in the diversity of firm sizes and types. Investors have 
a better chance of finding a firm or an industry that appeals to them. Some 
investors will seek to focus on a given industry or region. Some will focus on 
neighborhood businesses—say, in East Harlem, New York. Some will focus 
on high-technology firms on the West Coast. Some may focus on auto-parts 
stores in southwestern Iowa. The ability to focus small company investments 
will be astounding. Others will cast their crowdfunding investment net widely, 
subject to the limits imposed by the law. For these investors, diversification 
may limit the risk of loss for investors who are truly diversified. This is the 
true power of this effort.
Having reviewed factors impacting the demand for small business credit and 
the number of startups by state, in the next chapter we will continue our deep 
dive by reviewing the specific forms the SEC has created for use in Title III 
crowdfunding. We will also review reporting requirements.

Disclosure and 
Crowdfunding 
in the JOBS Act
One of the major changes promulgated by the JOBS Act affects financial dis-
closures. Startups are relieved from many of the more burdensome account-
ing and reporting requirements, requirements imposed by the Securities 
and Exchange Acts of 1933 and 1934. This part of the book describes these 
changes in detail, as well as the provisions relating to crowdfunding—using the 
Internet as a means to raise capital.
Chapter 4—Accounting, Reporting, and Other Standards in the JOBS 
Act: Form C
Chapter 4 describes the key operational tool the SEC uses to match demand 
for small business and startup capital with supply: Form C. (Appendix A also 
includes links to a blank Form C well as links to completed versions so that 
you can see what it looks like when filled out.) Form C is used to operation-
alize changes the law makes to disclosure requirements. These are critical. 
Disclosure rules describe and govern the specific information that must be 
given to investors before and after they invest. These rules have been said to 
limit the ability of small firms to raise money. In an age in which information 
moves in the blink of an eye and people use the Internet to conduct busi-
ness transactions of astonishing variety, it makes sense to use the technology 
to facilitate the flow of capital and other resources to create small business 
enterprises, especially when banks have not been lending.

Chapter 5—Crowdfunding
Chapter 5 provides summary information on crowdfunding. We review some 
of the most successful donations-based crowdfunding campaigns (including 
Reading Rainbow, Veronica Mars, Star Citizen, and Pulse Nightclub).
Chapter 6—What Title III Crowdfunding Costs
Chapter 6 uses new information to show you what the cost of Title III crowd-
funding is estimated, by the SEC, to be. This is the ability of new and existing 
emerging growth companies (EGCs) to sell part of their company via equity 
shares over the Internet. It also covers debt-based Title III crowdfunding and 
financing.
Chapter 7—Portals: Crowdfunding Industry Model
As with Chapter 6, Chapter 7 provides information from an industry per-
spective, showing what revenue and profits are estimated, by the SEC, to be. 
Portals, intermediaries sitting between EGCs and investors, are critical to the 
flow of capital to EGCs.

Accounting, 
Reporting, and 
Other Standards 
in the JOBS Act
Form C
The Securities Act of 1933 mandates that to sell or even offer to sell securities 
in the United States, those securities must be registered with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, the SEC. The SEC, in turn, requires security sell-
ers (broker/dealers) to disclose a great deal of information about the com-
pany doing the selling, the company investors are buying into (not the funding 
portal or broker). This set of information tries to provide, comprehensively, 
all relevant information about the firm’s past and future prospects. This 1933 
act allows certain companies to skip the registration process under a limited 
number of conditions. These security registration exemptions allow a firm to 
sell its securities if it is selling them to “accredited investors,” generally high-
income, high-net-worth people. The JOBS Act changes this.

Chapter 4 | Accounting, Reporting, and Other Standards in the JOBS Act

■
■Note  The Securities Act of 1933, often called the Truth in Securities Law, has two main 
objectives: require that investors receive financial and other significant information concerning 
securities being offered for public sale; and prohibit deceit, misrepresentations, and other fraud in 
the sale of securities.”1
Requirements that small companies, or EGCs, abide by certain accounting and 
disclosure standards have been modified for certain issuers and investors.
Remember that a primary role of the SEC in the investing process, under the 
1933 act as well as the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is to make sure that 
investors are fully and honestly informed about the company they are consid-
ering. This occurs in the form of disclosure, which is the act of making hidden 
information known. To do this under Title III of the JOBS Act, the SEC has 
created a new form: Form C.
In essence, the JOBS Act expands and modifies the number of financial secu-
rity offerings and sales exceptions. Exemptions are significant because they 
potentially lower the cost of raising capital. As you read, however, keep in 
mind that the exemptions outlined in the JOBS Act expire when one of three 
things happens:
• 
The EGC reaches its fifth birthday after its IPO.
• 
The EGC reaches $1 billion in revenue.
• 
The EGC becomes a large accelerated filer.
A large accelerated filer is an issuer or firm with $700 million or more, as mea-
sured by its stock market value, in total equity shares in the hands of people 
who are not associated with the firm. The SEC measures this data as of the last 
business day of the second quarter of an issuer’s fiscal year. A large accelerated 
filer is also a firm that has met certain SEC requirements, known as Section 
13(a) or 15(d) requirements, for at least a year and has issued at least one annual 
report under these requirements. Sections 13(a) and 15(d) mandate that com-
panies offering securities submit certain periodic reports to the SEC. Finally, a 
large accelerated filer is one that is not entitled to use the exemptions that exist 
for smaller companies under other sections of the SEC acts of 1933 and 1934.
Reporting Requirements the Act Relaxes
The JOBS Act seeks a gradual application of the more burdensome reporting 
requirements that publicly traded companies must bear to smaller companies.

the SEC web site, www.sec.gov/about/laws.shtml.

The JOBS Act
83
In other words, as EGCs “grow up,” they have to start playing by the same 
rules as the big boys. EGCs are still required to provide quarterly and annual 
reports. But, among other things:
• 
EGCs are exempt from Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404(b), 
meaning they are not required—for up to five years—to 
attest to internal audit controls.
• 
EGCs can provide two years’ worth of audited financial 
statements prior to issuing stock, in place of the three 
years of statements, required before the passage of the 
JOBS Act. The exemption vanishes one year after the 
EGC offers stock, however, so that at year one, an EGC 
will need to report three years of audited financial data: 
the two years’ worth of data filed at the start of the 
period plus one year’s worth of financial data collected 
in the interim.
• 
The act states that EGCs need not comply with new or 
revised financial accounting standards until those stan-
dards become “broadly applicable to private compa-
nies.” EGCs can opt in, however, and choose to meet the 
requirements for certain regulations if they choose to do 
so before losing EGC status.
• 
EGCs do not need to change accounting auditors on the 
basis outlined in Sarbanes-Oxley. The auditors inspect 
accounting policies, practices, and procedures to make 
sure that they conform to standard industry practices 
and accurately reflect the financial condition of the firm. 
Under SOX, companies have to change auditors fre-
quently to ensure no cozy relationships develop; but 
EGCs do not, at least until their fifth birthday.
• 
EGCs do not need to calculate and display the ratio of 
“the median … annual total compensation of all employ-
ees (excluding the chief executive officer) to the annual 
total compensation of the chief executive officer” as 
required by Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
Advertising and General Solicitation
Perhaps the most important change has been to the rules governing advertis-
ing and general security (stock or debt instrument) purchase or sale requests. 
Given the open nature of the Internet, if you are selling equity on the Web, it 
is difficult, if not impossible, to restrict general advertising. The whole point of 
the Web is to allow access to information by people across the globe.

Chapter 4 | Accounting, Reporting, and Other Standards in the JOBS Act
84
■
■Note  Rules governing hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds have been 
profoundly modified by the JOBS Act. Funds that rely on a Regulation D Rule 506 exemption will 
now be advertised and possibly sold online. See my comments to the SEC on this at http://sec.
gov/comments/s7-07-12/s70712-1.htm.
As part of the effort to encourage small companies to issue stock, Title II 
relaxes rules that limited the ability of firms to publicize or otherwise discuss 
their equity offering. Rules limiting the ability of firms to ask people to buy or 
sell their stocks and bonds are well entrenched. In the United States, to be 
legal, offers to sell securities must meet certain requirements mandated by 
the SEC. Certain exemptions, called Regulation D exemptions, exist. But to be 
fully legal, a seller must abide by rules set by the SEC to have these exemp-
tions apply to its sale of securities. The reason the JOBS Act is so important 
is that it creates a new set of security sales exemptions.
The JOBS Act tells the SEC to eliminate, or remove, any rules preventing 
security-instrument issuers from advertising to or otherwise soliciting per-
sons from purchasing stock issued by small firms. This is known as general 
solicitation or general advertising. Strangely, there is no formal definition in law 
for these terms. Much like pornography cases at the Supreme Court, however, 
the SEC knows them when it sees them. The JOBS Act now allows potential 
investors to receive research from investment banks and others underwriting 
an EGC’s IPO. Now, for example, an investment bank can provide research to 
potential investors in an EGC while serving as an underwriter to that EGC 
online and via other media. This makes sense only if you are going to offer 
equity online via a publicly accessible web site, since the investment bank and 
analyst have no way to control who accesses the information. Part of the 
problem with using the Internet to raise capital has been concern about pos-
sibly violating general solicitation and advertising rules. The changes that are 
part of the JOBS Act should eliminate these concerns.
Under Title III, issuers cannot compensate any person to promote their offer-
ing outside the communication channels provided by the intermediary unless 
the notices contain only the following information:
• 
A statement that the issuer is conducting an offering
• 
The name of the platform on which the offering is being 
conducted
• 
The terms (amount, type, price, closing date) of the offering
• 
The name, address, phone, and web site of the issuer
• 
The e-mail address for a representative of the issuer

The JOBS Act
85
An issuer can communicate with investors “about the terms of the offering via “a 
communication channel provided by the intermediary on the intermediary’s plat-
form as long they clearly identify themselves as the issuer in all communications.”
Any notices of this type and form must direct potential investors and investors 
to the platform on which the offering is being conducted. These notices do not 
have to be filed with the SEC or with the crowdfunding platform or intermediary.
■
■Note  General solicitation and general advertising are considered by the SEC as any 
advertisement, article, notice, or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine, or 
similar media, or broadcast over television or radio, and any seminar or meeting whose attendees 
have been invited by any general solicitation or general advertising.2
This is a major change. Previously, broker/dealers and investment banks could 
not provide research to most investors concerning the securities of small 
firms they were bringing to market.
SOX Conflict-of-Interest Provisions Still in Force
Conflict-of-interest provisions, as outlined in Section 501 of Sarbanes-Oxley, 
remain in effect. In summary, these provisions require investment firms and 
analysts to keep research reports confidential prior to the time that the stock 
is offered to the public and to keep research reports free from influence by 
those seeking to sell investment banking services to issuers.
Section 501 requires investment analysts to be supervised and evaluated 
only by investment firm personnel who are not involved in investment bank-
ing activities. The section also seeks to prohibit retaliatory actions targeting 
investment analysts who publish unfavorable reports on a company. Section 
501 seeks to prevent this type of retaliation on the part of investment banking 
firm personnel who might feel that their firm’s ability to solicit business from 
firms receiving unfavorable evaluations is diminished.
Under 501, investment banks that have or are about to participate in a secu-
rity offering must establish certain time periods during which they halt the 
publication of research reports that provide information on certain issuers. 
Other actual and potential conflicts of interest, such as the analyst’s personal 
investments in the company, or broker or investment banking firm compen-
sation from the firm that is the subject of the report, must be disclosed. 
Likewise, status as an investment banking client in the one-year period before 
the report’s publication, and any other material conflicts, must be disclosed.

Accredited Investors
Under Title II of the JOBS Act, investment instrument sellers are required to 
verify that all equity security purchasers are accredited investors. (Note that 
these requirements do not apply to raising money through crowdfunding: Title 
III’s provisions on spending and income limits serve the same purpose there.)
■
■Note  Accredited investors are considered financially savvy and therefore better able to protect 
themselves from fraud.
Who or what is an accredited investor? Here’s how the SEC defines it:
• 
A bank, insurance company, registered investment com-
pany, business development company, or small business 
investment company
• 
An employee benefit plan, within the meaning of the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 
if a bank, insurance company, or registered investment 
adviser makes the investment decisions, or if the plan has 
total assets in excess of $5 million
• 
A charitable organization, corporation, or partnership 
with assets exceeding $5 million
• 
A director, executive officer, or general partner of the 
company selling the securities
• 
A business in which all the equity owners are accredited 
investors
• 
A natural person who has individual net worth, or  
joint net worth with the person’s spouse, that exceeds  
$1 million at the time of the purchase, excluding the  
value of the primary residence of such person
• 
A natural person with income exceeding $200,000 in each 
of the two most recent years or joint income with a spouse 
exceeding $300,000 for those years and a reasonable 
expectation of the same income level in the current year
• 
A trust with assets in excess of $5 million, not formed to 
acquire the securities offered, whose purchases a sophis-
ticated person makes
To aid in determining the likelihood that a firm seeking to raise capital  
under the JOBS Act will actually be able to do so, the Act permits an EGC to 
communicate with potential institutional and qualified security buyers.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission does not pass upon the merits 
of any securities offered or the terms of the offering, nor does it pass upon the 
accuracy or completeness of any offering document or literature.
These securities are offered under an exemption from registration; however, 
the US SEC has not made an independent determination that these securities 
are exempt from registration.
ECG must disclose “that it will file a report with the Commission annually and 
post the report on its web site, no later than 120 days after the end of each

Legends: “A crowdfunding investment involves risk. You should not invest any 
funds in this offering unless you can afford to lose your entire investment.”
In making an investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination 
of the issuer and the terms of the offering, including the merits and risks 
involved. These securities have not been recommended or approved by any 
federal or state securities commission or regulatory authority. Furthermore, 
these authorities have not passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this 
document.

Keep in mind that although this looks like a lot of data (and it is), most start-
ups will not have to worry about providing much of it. I believe that most 
new crowdfunded startup firms will have one owner. This owner will hold, 
prior to the offering, 100 percent of the firm. This means the firm’s capital 
structure will be as simple as possible: one owner holding all of the stock. The 
firm won’t have issued any other securities, so no information needs to be 
provided about them (because they don’t exist). Documentation and terms 
concerning ownership rights will be standardized and made as fair and simple 
as possible to facilitate the offering. Valuation and security pricing will also be 
simple: the stock price is what it is; take it or leave it. You will, however, have 
to explain how you came up with that number.
Most startups will not have to worry about reporting the more difficult parts 
of the required data.
Crowdfunding portals will help small business owners comply with these 
requirements. They will provide valuation models or modeling services, legal 
documents that describe the security rights, modification, and dilution infor-
mation. For a one-person firm, these will be as simplified as possible, anyway.
I believe that portals with overly complicated terms and offerings will be 
seen as inauthentic and nontransparent. Crowdfunding investors will probably 
avoid these portals in favor of those that can comply with these requirements, 
while keeping things as simple as possible.
■
■Note  The best portals will simplify the crowdfunding process while maintaining the investor 
protection intent of the disclosure rules embedded in the JOBS Act.
Registration documents, including a prospectus, must be delivered to poten-
tial buyers prior to the sale of securities. These statements have two main 
parts. The prospectus describes key facts about the issuer’s operation, how 
it is doing financially, and who runs the firm. A second portion of the reg-
istration document contains information that, while public, is not required. 
This can include anything from the firm’s annual report, to contracts, to legal 
documents.

Form C
Form C is the main disclosure tool under the JOBS Act for Title III crowdfund-
ing. I caution you, however, that Form C looks deceptively simple. It is not. The 
SEC’s own estimates of the cost to complete the form, shown in Table 4-2, 
should give you some feel for the nature of the task.

The SEC estimates that issuers raising $100,000 or less will spend $2,500 fill-
ing out Form C. Those raising from $100,000 to $500,000 will spend between 
$2,500 and $5,000 on Form C. Those raising over $500,000 to $1,000,000 
will spend between $5,000 and $20,000.
Note that we use these SEC-provided estimates to create a financial model of 
crowdfunding issuers, platforms, and the industry itself. We use model infor-
mation at several points in the book.

Chapter 4 | Accounting, Reporting, and Other Standards in the JOBS Act
94
Appendix A provides further details about Form C.
Form C is also used to file offering amendments, progress reports, and annual 
reports, and to notify the SEC that you are terminating reporting obligations 
under Title III of the JOBS Act. To carry this out, Form C includes the follow-
ing sections and subforms:
• 
Form C-U: Progress Update. Used to report the total amount 
of securities sold. Must be filed either five days after reaching 
goal or five days after the offering deadline.
• 
Form C/A: Amendment to Offering Statement. Used to dis-
close minor and material changes to the offering statement 
(Form C). Information is defined as material “if there is 
a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would 
consider it important in deciding whether or not to pur-
chase the securities.”
• 
Form C-AR: Annual Report. Must file no later than 120 days 
after the end of the issuer’s fiscal year. Required unless the 
issuer is required to file under other SEC rules—Exchange 
Act 13(a) or 15(d); has filed at least one annual report and 
has fewer than 300 holders; has filed at least three annual 
reports and has less than $10 million in assets; all securi-
ties repurchased or the issuer liquidates or dissolves.
• 
Form C-AR/A: Amendment to Annual Report. Use to file 
modifications to the annual report.
• 
Form C-TR: Termination of Reporting. File within five days 
from the date the issuer becomes eligible to terminate 
reporting.
The form also includes an optional question-and-answer format that can be 
used to provide disclosures required. The SEC mandates that, when using this 
option, you give “full and complete answers” that are not misleading in any 
way. You cannot discuss future performance or anticipated events.
There is no requirement that the issuer “provide direct notification via e-mail.” 
Notification concerning the location of the forms on the issuer’s web site is 
sufficient.
Registration with the SEC
The JOBS Act permits EGCs to file a confidential registration statement with 
the SEC before launching their IPO. This allows EGCs to determine market 
demand for their securities without letting others know they are doing so 
and without exposing potentially sensitive business information. In addition, 

The JOBS Act
95
EGCs are allowed to meet with institutional and other accredited investors 
to determine the level of market interest in their securities.
■
■Note  Being able to gauge investor interest before offering stock is critical. The best portals 
develop tools to accurately measure and facilitate this.
EGCs are required, in fact, to file, with the SEC, an initial confidential regis-
tration statement “at least 21 days before it begins pre-IPO road shows for 
potential investors.”
Finally, EGCs are exempt from the requirements of Section 229.301of  
Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, for any period prior to the earliest 
audited period presented in connection with its initial public offering. This 
regulation requires an issuer to provide the following data:
• 
Net sales or operating revenues
• 
Income or loss from current operations
• 
Income per share
• 
Total assets
• 
Long-term debt
• 
Preferred stock
• 
Cash dividends per share
• 
Other financial data metrics that “would enhance an 
understanding” of the issuer’s financial conditions and 
trends in operations
Under the old rule, these data had to be provided for the last five fiscal years 
or, if the issuer had been around for less than five years, for the life of the 
issuer and its predecessors. Issuers must, however, provide information for 
preceding fiscal years that is needed to keep the submitted data from being 
misleading.
Summary
The JOBS Act makes significant modifications to the rules concerning what 
companies must disclose to investors. In addition, it allows firms to “test 
the waters” more vigorously, communicating with a wider range of poten-
tial investors without having to publicly reveal sensitive, confidential business 
information. Newly developed Form C is the main disclosure tool under Title 
III of the JOBS Act.

Chapter 4 | Accounting, Reporting, and Other Standards in the JOBS Act
96
Given the medium used to effectuate crowdfunding transactions—the 
Internet—the JOBS Act establishes that persons and companies with web 
sites matching EGC stock buyers and EGC issuers will not have to register as 
a broker/dealer, unless they fail to meet certain conditions. It establishes that 
communications between EGCs and potential investors can happen under a 
wider range of circumstances, and establishes that even persons and institu-
tions who may be involved in a crowdfunding transaction can distribute EGC 
research reports on a more reasonable basis. This facilitates the flow of infor-
mation about EGCs and should lower the cost of raising capital.
This chapter began to outline the costs of conducting a Title III JOBS Act 
solicitation. In the next chapter, we explore the SEC’s estimates of the rev-
enue generated by an individual crowdfunding platform to calculate the indi-
vidual profitability of each platform under very restrictive assumptions and 
conditions. We sum the individual platform estimates to get an estimate of 
the profitability of the Title III crowdfunding industry, again, using the SEC’s 
numbers.

Crowdfunding
On June 7, 2007, I proposed the creation of the Microcredit Stock Exchange 
to the Government of the District of Columbia.1 The Exchange represents 
one of the earliest versions of crowdfunding. This solution was created in 
direct response to the decline in business ethics that limited capital access 
in low-income, minority, and women business communities. The Microcredit 
Stock Exchange and, by extension, crowdfunding, was designed to counter 
capital misallocation by helping ensure that more capital goes, at the margin, 
to deserving small companies. As described in the proposal,
Equity capital, or shares, in micro businesses would be traded on a Micro 
Business Stock Exchange created and managed by a third-party entity. 
The Exchange would provide the framework for the provision of small 
amounts of equity capital ($1,000 to $250,000) to micro businesses 
in Washington. To make things easier and to enhance the probability 
of success, we suggest the initiative focus specifically on disadvantaged 
businesses operating in (low-income areas of the city) far Northeast and 
in Southeast.2

At the same time, others were working on the equity crowdfunding concept 
that soon became the JOBS Act. As I noted in an article in the The Washington 
Post,
Crowdfunding works this way: An entrepreneur with an idea for a company 
or product posts the details of the idea or product on a web site such as 
Kickstarter. The posting includes information on the amount of money 
needed, benefits to those who contribute to the project, and information 
on the developers. The (Title III) crowdfunding provisions of the JOBS Act 
allow startup and other companies to sell up to $1 million in equity, or 
ownership shares, in their business.
Currently, the two largest crowdfunding platforms, Indiegogo and Kickstarter, 
are donations-based platforms (not equity). They were the model for cer-
tain aspects of the JOBS Act: Title III and Title IV allow firms to raise from  
$1 million to $50 million.
Figure 5-1 provides information on the nature of crowdfunding on Kickstarter. 
As of October 6, 2016, most Kickstarter campaigns raise between $1,000 
and $10,000. Very few (169,192 out of 111,419) raise over $1 million. Still, 
2,8433,209 raised over $100,000, a significant a number and a significant dollar 
amount for those seeking to start a business.

The JOBS Act
99
The most exciting part of the JOBS Act remains crowdfunding. This chapter 
describes crowdfunding in detail and reviews how small businesses can use 
the technique to raise money.
What Is Crowdfunding?
Crowdfunding is a business-financing technique that uses online social net-
works linked to a web-based platform to raise money. It is as if, by having 
a Facebook page, you can generate donations (business-financing capital) to 
finance something like an artistic project, a product, or a company. Imagine 
being able to raise money for your firm via eBay. Figure 5-2 illustrates a typical 
crowdfunding path.
Company has/creates product
or service, applies to a Portal in
order to obtain ivestment
capital via Crowfunding
Portal reviews applicant,
creates documents (Form C and
other filling requirements, etc.)
mandated by the JOBS Act.
If approved, company information
is posted to Portal website.
Investors review, decide to invest
(or not).
If funding goal is reached, company
gets funds. If not, it doesn’t.
If it doesget $, company must meet
ongoing JOBS Act reporting and other
requirements.
Figure 5-2. Typical JOBS Act crowdfunding path
Using social networks to generate financing is nothing new. The Barack Obama 
presidential campaign used crowdfunding to raise $500 million in 2008.3 The 
crowdfunding provision of the JOBS Act simply applies this experience to the 
practice of business financing. What is now different is that the JOBS Act vali-
dates and extends this approach to the business world. This is a huge change. 
In fact, it’s the biggest change in business-financing options since the creation

of the small business loan. It has the potential to become what’s called a disrup-
tive innovation—a game changer in the world of finance.
Prior to the JOBS Act, people had been able to use the Internet to raise dona-
tions for a project or take orders (and money) for a product or service before 
launch. But until now, they have not been able to sell an interest in their firm, 
legally, in exchange for that donation.
Figure 5-3 gives a view of the potentially disruptive nature of crowdfunding.4

Catching the Wave,” Harvard Business Review, January–February 1995.
The bottom axis looks at the flow of business capital over time. The vertical 
axis is a scalar representing an index of the amount of money flowing to all 
firms. The line at bottom represents the amount of business startup funding 
directed to firms that would otherwise find it very difficult, if not impossible, 
to obtain financing. The next higher line represents firms that could get capital

with some difficulty. Next are firms that can get capital from traditional institu-
tions, and have very high social return—that is, they employ a large number of 
people and produce goods and services recognized as socially useful. Finally, 
the highest line represents firms for which obtaining capital is, with the proper 
documentation, not a problem. The curved black line shows the cumulative 
supply of capital to all of these firms, as augmented by crowdfunding.

Important Recent Crowdfunding Campaigns
To show how disruptive crowdfunding has become, you need only review 
some of the best-known crowdfunding campaigns, which we do in this section. 
Keep in mind that these are donations or rewards based.
Levar Burton and Reading Rainbow
Reading Rainbow, a children’s program hosted by former Star Trek actor Levar 
Burton, debuted in 1983 and ran until 2006. Burton launched a campaign on 
Kickstarter to raise money to resurrect the program. In one of the most 
encouraging displays of the power of crowdfunding, he raised $1 million in  
24 hours. In fact, a total of 105,857 backers pledged $5,408,916.
Figure  5-4 shows the structure of the campaign, listing all of the rewards 
offered and the number of rewards taken at each dollar amount. Table 5-1

Why was this campaign so successful? Here are some reasons:
• 
It linked to two well-known media properties, Reading 
Rainbow and Star Trek.
• 
The fact that Reading Rainbow was cancelled in 2006 and 
that Burton did not wait until now to try to relaunch, but 
had developed several successful products in the interim, 
also worked in this campaign’s favor.

• 
His campaign was certainly socially responsible, with 
high social impact, focusing on an area of recognized 
need—education.
• 
He also had justification for a large crowdfunding goal. In 
other words, to do what he wanted to do, it would take 
at least a million dollars.
• 
He had the name recognition required to generate initial 
curiosity, which, given the high quality of what he was 
offering, quickly turned into participation.
• 
He structured the rewards correctly, with an ultimate gift 
of some interest: a chance to wear Geordi’s visor at a 
dinner with Burton (The Ultimate Star Trek “Visor” pack-
age). Wow! It did not matter whether anyone purchased 
the thing; the fact that it was offered at all showed that 
Burton was all in.
Why this campaign is important to JOBS Act crowdfunding: The campaign drove 
educators to crowdfunding. One group raised $5 million from 2,877 donors 
to teach students computer coding. The Wayfinding Academy raised $206,451 
on Indiegogo to create an affordable, experience-based and individual passion-
based two-year community college.
Educators have become one of the more successful and influential groups of 
crowdfunders. According to the Associated Press, “From classroom cleaning 
supplies to computers for students to use in the classroom, to underwater 
robots, public school teachers throughout the U.S. are turning to crowdfund-
ing. When government entities can’t provide the funds, teachers increasingly 
open their own wallets or go online.”5
The next generation of businesspeople are learning about crowdfunding at 
the grass roots level, by seeing it in action from a very young age.
Veronica Mars
Veronica Mars is an American teen noir mystery drama television series cre-
ated by screenwriter Rob Thomas. On March 13, 2013, Thomas posted The 
Veronica Mars Movie Project on Kickstarter, with a goal of raising $2 million 
to fund a feature film. The campaign was wildly successful, with 91,585 backers 
donating $5,702,153. (They raised $2 million in 10 hours.)

Why this campaign is important to JOBS Act crowdfunding: The Veronica Mars 
campaign encouraged filmmakers and visual artists to consider using crowd-
funding. Additional film-based projects, including Zach Braff’s Wish I Were 
Here Project, which raised $3,105,473 from 6,520 backers, was launched on 
April 24, 2013. A current Title III equity crowdfunding campaign seeks to raise 
capital for a fan-driven movie studio, also following in the footsteps of Mars.
Star Citizen
Star Citizen is a computer game for Windows and Linux set in the 30th cen-
tury. A crowdfunding campaign for the game was launched in October, 2012 
on Kickstarter. In 2014, Guinness World Records recognized the effort as the 
“largest single amount ever raised via crowdsourcing” and crowdfunding. The 
game is still in development as of September 2016, having raised a total of 
$122,704,233 from 1,515,540 backers or supporters.
The path taken to that record dollar amount is of interest. Game developers 
started their own crowdfunding campaign, moved to Kickstarter, and then 
moved back to their own platform.

The reward and benefit structure is one of the reasons the campaign has 
worked. In return “for contributing to the project's funding, backers receive 
virtual rewards in the form of tiered pledge packages, which include a space-
ship and credits to buy additional equipment and to cover initial costs in the 
virtual economy, like fuel.” For hard-core gamers, this is a significant benefit.
News reports have stated that “Star Citizen’s initial release date was November 
2014,” and as of September 2016, the game has yet to be delivered. Portions 
of the game are available and playable online, however.
As with the Coolest Cooler project (described in Chapter 3), not everyone 
is willing to wait. In July 2016, a supporter who donated to the game “suc-
cessfully received a refund of $2,550” after complaining to the Los Angeles 
Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission.
Why this campaign is important to JOBS Act crowdfunding: Star Citizen has the 
potential to be the Lehman Brothers of donations-based crowdfunding. If the 
game is never delivered, it will negatively impact all of crowdfunding, including 
debt- and equity-based JOBS Act crowdfunding.
Oculus Rift
The Oculus Rift is a virtual reality headset developed with the assistance 
of a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign. Two years after launching their 
Kickstarter campaign, the company behind the Rift, Oculus VR, was purchased 
by Facebook for $2 billion.

Investors became upset, and one posted a photo of a T-shirt imprinted with 
the image of an eye and the text Love VR. Oculus and a tweet on Twitter to say, “I 
helped Oculus Rift sell for $2 billion dollars and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.” 
To say that many of those who backed the Oculus crowdfunding campaign 
felt cheated is an understatement. Much of this remorse is based, however, on 
greed: equity investors in Oculus VR, as opposed to crowdfunding campaign 
backers, were rumored to have gotten a return of 20× on their money.6
As several commentators have pointed out, the Oculus Rift crowdfunding 
campaign worked exactly as designed. It announced a new product to the 
world, provided the funding needed to create a working prototype, revealed 
the exact nature of consumer demand for the product, and brought the com-
pany to the attention of a large investor.
Why this campaign is important to JOBS Act crowdfunding: By showing, in clear 
terms, one possible outcome from investing in a startup company with an 
innovative product using JOBS Act crowdfunding (not used in this case, how-
ever), this campaign set the stage for the development of other campaigns 
hoping for the same outcome. It shows what might be possible if all of the 
stars align correctly. I must warn you, however, that an outcome as profitable 
as this one is highly unlikely.
Orlando
In the wake of the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, a GoFundMe 
page was quickly posted by the state’s lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgen-
der (LGBT) civil rights organization (Figure  5-8). That crowdfunding cam-
paign rapidly became the best funded on the site, raising over $7 million from 
119,280 people in two months. The city itself created a separate campaign, 
OneOrlando.org, which attracted large corporate donors (the Walt Disney 
Company, Universal Studios, and others) who have donated $1 million each.
6Jillian Berman, “I Backed Oculus Rift On Kickstarter And All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt,” 
Huffington Post, March 26, 2014, www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/26/oculus-rift-
kickstarter_n_5034511.html.

The JOBS Act
113
Why this campaign is important to JOBS Act crowdfunding: The Pulse Nightclub 
shooting occurred on June 12, 2016. The GoFundMe campaign was set up 
on the same day, June 12, 2016. This is unprecedented, but reflects the speed 
with which funding activity can take place. For businesses, this means that 
time is less of a limiting factor. Of course, the analogy to business is not exact 
or entirely fair. The Orlando incident remains a tragedy, also unprecedented, 
that received wall-to-wall, 24/7 news coverage. We can only hope that there  
are more positive uses of the quick response made possible by crowdfunding. 
The JOBS Act imposes certain time limits, detailed in the next chapter, that 
reduce the ability of small businesses to obtain funding immediately. Still, a 
combination of donations- and rewards-based crowdfunding and JOBS Act 
Figure 5-8.  GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign for Pulse Nightclub

Chapter 5 | Crowdfunding

crowdfunding may allow startups everywhere to take advantage of opportuni-
ties in a way that is hard to imagine at present.
As the examples in this chapter show, crowdfunders obtain donations or sell 
a product or service for cash. You have not been able to sell (legally) equity 
shares in your business online in the United States to nonaccredited investors. 
Until now.
Crowdfunding in the JOBS Act
Title III of the JOBS Act establishes the crowdfunding exemption, a release 
from legal liability that would otherwise arise from federal laws concerning 
the sale of equity securities under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77d). 
Trying to sell ownership stakes in very small companies via the Internet would 
be impossible otherwise. This is why the current crowdfunding models use 
donations or product preorders (as in the example of Pebble Watch pre-
sented previously) to raise money. The securities laws are so burdensome 
that it is impossible to raise money (legally) any other way.
Once again, Title III says EGCs can sell up to $1 million in equity securities via 
crowdfunding over any 12-month period. As of October 4, 2016, just over 120 
JOBS Act Title III solicitation efforts have been launched (Figure 5-9).

The JOBS Act

Title III also establishes that, for securities offered under the nonaccredited 
investor provisions of the act, an individual can invest only the greater of 
$2,000 or 5 percent of either what they make or of their net worth (what 
they own minus what they owe) if their income or net worth is less than 
$100,000. Persons with a net worth or annual income greater than $100,000 
can invest up to 10 percent of what they make in a given year in all EGC secu-
rities. The maximum that persons with a net worth greater than $100,000 
can invest is either 10 percent of their income or net worth, up to $100,000.
It’s worth noting that another section of the JOBS Act, Title IV, allows compa-
nies to raise up to $50 million in capital. As required by Section 401(a) of the 
JOBS Act, in March 2015, the SEC adopted amendments to what are known 
as Regulation A offerings. Companies use Form 1-A for these solicitations. 
Appendix B provides further details on this form. Although these documents 
make the process appear quite simple, you may want to consult with a quali-
fied securities attorney and a CPA prior to applying.
Although I do not go into detail about Title IV here, let me note that this sec-
tion of the act has generated quite a lot of excitement. Refer to Table 1-1 in 
Chapter 1 for more information on the differences between Title III and Title 
IV of the act.
Figure 5-10 shows the number of Form 1-A applications for financing under 
this provision from January 1, 2016 to October 6, 2016.

Income and Investment Limits
The final rules adopted by the SEC on Title III crowdfunding state that “an 
investor will be limited to investing (1) the greater of $2,000 or 5 percent 
of the lesser of the investor’s annual income or net worth if either annual 
income or net worth is less than $100,000; or (2) 10 percent of the lesser of 
the investor’s annual income or net worth, not to exceed an amount sold of 
$100,000, if both annual income and net worth are $100,000 or more.”

Figure 5-11 shows the investment limit on the left side, and income or net 
worth on the bottom axis. It shows that, as income goes from $0 to $1,000,000, 
the limits increase from $2,000 to $100,000. From income or net worth of 
$40,000, the crowdfunding investment limit grows, reaching a maximum of 
$100,000. Notice that $2,000 is the lower limit. In other words, even if your 
income is zero, you can still invest $2,000 in crowdfunding securities (assum-
ing you can get $2,000 from somewhere).

The JOBS Act
117
Figure 5-11.  Investment Llmits under the JOBS Act. (Source: Graphic by William Michael 
Cunningham, from Regulation Crowdfunding Final Rules issued by the SEC.)
Transactions must be conducted through a broker or funding portal that 
meets the requirements set out in Section 4A(a) of the JOBS Act. Issuers 
must comply with requirements set out in Section 4A(b) of the act. (I detail 
both sections in Chapter 10, which covers Title III of the act.)
Rules for Portals
To qualify to sell ECG securities, a broker or funding portal must register 
with the SEC as a broker/dealer or funding portal, must register with FINRA 
or another self-regulatory organization, must provide investors with both 
education and disclosures concerning the risk of monetary loss, and must 
ensure that investors actually read and understand educational and risk-of-
loss documentation. Some question how anyone can verify another person’s 
level of comprehension, but the JOBS Act mandates that funding portals try 
to address this issue. (I discuss this further in Chapter 7.)
The final JOBS Act Title III crowdfunding rules state that you cannot use more 
than one portal or platform to raise capital under the JOBS Act. The final 
rules also define a platform as “a program or application accessible via the 
Internet or other similar electronic communications medium through which 
a registered broker/dealer or a registered funding portal acts as an interme-
diary in a transaction involving the offer or sale of securities in reliance on 
Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)).”

Chapter 5 | Crowdfunding
118
■
■Note  The final rules state that funding portals are not permitted to physically meet with 
investors to solicit investments and offerings on its platform, or to hold launch parties.
A portal or broker/dealer must quiz EGC investors to document their under-
standing of the riskiness of these securities. They must also take steps to 
reduce the risk of fraud by obtaining a background check, including securities 
enforcement regulatory history, for persons holding more than 20 percent of 
the outstanding equity of each EGC issuer.
Portals also have to make sure EGCs are not funded until they reach mone-
tary goals set at the start of the capital raise. In other words, if you say you are 
trying to raise a million dollars through crowdfunding, a crowdfunding portal 
cannot give you any money until pledges to your firm or the amount of money 
you raise totals $1 million. These funds will be held in a separate account. 
Some portals will not be able to hold funds. Some will. Either way, if you do 
not raise the targeted amount, all funds revert to your potential investors.
All investor information is confidential.
The final Title III crowdfunding rules made significant modifications in numer-
ous areas.
We initially stated that portals cannot compensate anyone for providing informa-
tion on potential investors. Now, under the final rules, “an issuer can compensate 
persons to promote its offering through communication channels provided by 
the intermediary on its platform, where certain conditions are met.”
The portal or platform is charged with making sure that investors are informed 
that promoters have an obligation to “disclose in all communications on the 
platform the receipt of compensation and promotional activity on behalf of 
an issuer.”
Further, in this book’s first edition I noted that:
Directors, officers, and partners in a funding portal cannot have a financial 
interest in EGC issuers launched on their portal.
This has been modified. A portal is now allowed to have a financial interest in 
an issuer on its platform under the following circumstances:
• 
The interest is in return for services the platform pro-
vides to the issuer.
• 
The compensation consists of securities that are identical to 
those being offered on the platform. The issuer cannot give 
the platform securities that contain better terms or condi-
tions than those offered to everyone else on the platform.

The JOBS Act
119
Rules for Issuers
Section III of the JOBS Act further mandates that EGC issuers provide a lot of 
information to potential investors. As detailed in Chapter 4, this information 
includes data on the firm’s (or the owner’s) name and legal status (corpora-
tion, partnership, and so forth). You must also include information on your 
physical location, so you need an address. EGC issuers also must report and 
provide information on anyone holding more than 20 percent of the shares of 
the firm raising cash. The current or projected anticipated business has to be 
described in a business plan.
You must describe the firm’s current financial condition. For offerings less 
than $100,000, the income tax returns of the issuers or financial statements 
certified by the CEO are required; offerings between $100,000 and $500,000 
require CPA-reviewed financial statements; offerings greater than $500,000 
require audited financial statements.
In addition, you must tell what you plan to do with the money, and how much 
money you are trying to raise and when. EGC issuers must provide regular 
updates concerning progress in meeting this goal.
You must set a price in writing for the securities offered, along with informa-
tion on how that price was determined, and how it might be determined in 
the future. You must provide valuation examples. Investors must be given a 
reasonable opportunity to change their minds about the purchase.
Next, outline the current structure of the firm: who owns what, how, and 
when. Describe the terms, spelling out the conditions of the security offering, 
and outline information on the conditions surrounding both the security sale 
and the company. Describe any other ownership interests in the EGC firm 
offering the securities in detail. In addition, you have to describe information 
on certain conditions and terms of the ownership interest, along with infor-
mation on how the rights in these ownership interests held by the current 
company owner(s) might be modified to damage the new prospective owners 
buying shares via crowdfunding.
In short, you must outline all risks, including risks relating to the fact that 
those purchasing shares in an EGC over the Internet are probably not the 
majority owners. Risks relating to ownership dilution, the sale of additional 
shares that reduce the percentage ownership of legacy or prior shareholders 
in a firm, must be described.
The EGC cannot advertise terms of the offering, except through “notices 
which direct investors to the funding portal or broker” and, within certain 
guidelines, can compensate certain parties to promote its offerings. All pro-
motional compensation must be fully disclosed.

Chapter 5 | Crowdfunding
120
EGC issuers are strictly liable for any material misstatements and omissions. 
EGC security buyers can bring a legal action to recover the amount of money 
they paid for an EGC security against EGC security offerors if they determine 
that the offerors left something out, hid relevant facts about the EGC, or 
shaded facts in a way that made the EGC appear more favorable and worthy 
than it actually was. The act establishes that persons can bring a legal action 
to recover moneys lost or for damages even if they no longer own the EGC 
security at issue.
Figure 5-12 provides a summary of crowdfunding as outlined in the JOBS Act.
Figure 5-12.  Summary of crowdfunding
The far left (first) column shows entrepreneurs as they approach the crowd-
funding market. The next column represents portals, online crowdfunding 
facilitators. Critical portions of the crowdfunding process are shown in the 
middle column. Significant crowdfunding documents are in the next column, 
Finally, the column at right represents the crowdfunding network of investors 
and others. Notice that the first and last columns show people involved in 
the process. The rows represent phases of the process, defined as the initial 
phase, the second phase, the decision phase, and the final phase.

The JOBS Act
121
Entrepreneurs start by providing mandatory data to portals, in the next col-
umn. The first decision point of the process is reached. Portals must decide 
whether they will allow the entrepreneur to list his or her solicitation on the 
site. If so, the process continues, and business plans are posted. The process 
moves to connector A. Notice that at this point, there are no investors, hence 
the noninvestor box in the last column.
Moving to connector A in the first column of the second row of the graphic, 
unaudited and audited data are collected by portals. Professional service pro-
viders, represented by accountants and lawyers, now join the process, depend-
ing on the nature of the crowdfunding campaign. These service providers may 
or may not be required, depending on the amount of money being raised. 
(The figure assumes that these service providers are engaged.) They create 
audited financial reports and the antifraud certifications required by the act. 
This validated data is used in the next phase of the process. A standardized 
security document is created and distributed to the network of potential 
investors.
At this point, note that the network is divided into two categories: noninves-
tors and investors. Investors receive information from a standardized security 
pricing model, as required by the act. Noninvestors do not.
Portals are required by the act to track fundraising goals for each company 
seeking funding. If the firm meets its fundraising goals, it moves to the final 
phase of the fundraising effort. Crowdfunding companies are required to 
provide regular updates to investors, represented in the graphic by the box 
labeled Ongoing reports.
Nature of the Innovation
Although not fully revolutionary, crowdfunding is a sustaining innovation, an 
evolutionary change that puts business financing within reach of everyone 
with an Internet connection, representing a true democratization of business 
capital access. Venture capital firms, commercial banks, and angel investors 
won’t just stop lending and investing. They will continue to do so. They may 
now face new and significant competition, however.
Of course, crowdfunding is no panacea. The potential for fraud still exists. 
There is always the chance that someone will seek to create a fictitious fund-
ing portal or nonexistent company to raise money. Legitimate firms may fail, 
giving rise to a multitude of lawsuits that decimate interest in this new field, 
making it impossible for even worthy companies to raise capital. Or it may 
work too well. Thousands of small businesses may obtain capital without 
going to a bank or other financial institution. Banks and VC firms may then 
lobby to get the JOBS Act repealed.

Chapter 5 | Crowdfunding
122
In fact, there is every reason to believe that entrenched industry interests may 
mobilize to limit the reach and impact of this technology, since this tends to 
happen with every disruptive business innovation. Investment and commercial 
banks would try to limit the power of this financing technique, since it has the 
potential to reduce their control over the small-business lending market.
Advantages of Crowdfunding 
Crowdfunding has advantages. Using crowdfunding, small business owners can 
bypass the Small Business Administration, and leave other ineffective small 
business financiers behind.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of crowdfunding over traditional financing is 
that it enables entrepreneurs to gauge public interest in their product and 
service and obtain financing at very low cost. If successful, investors in the 
project often become “network evangelists,” bringing others to the table to 
buy both products and shares in the new firm. Traditional venture capital 
firms have tried to do this by creating a network of investee firms that use 
goods and services created by other companies in which the VC has invested. 
Questions concerning the fairness and ethics of this “VC network” approach 
are well known, but this is not an issue with crowdfunding. That’s because 
crowdfunding seeks to create an authentic, diversified, and diverse group of 
investors in an EGC, which places it beyond the control of any single VC firm.
■
■Note  Venture capital (VC) firms invest in startup and early-stage firms. Venture capital 
investments usually start at $250,000 and are mainly made to businesses with the possibility of 
very high growth. If they invest, these firms expect to earn a significant return on their investment. 
According to news reports, “Venture capital firm Spark Partners and hedge fund Matrix Partners 
each invested $19 million in VR Inc., the company that makes the Oculus Rift, earlier this year. Now, 
their investments are worth about $380 million each.”7
In addition to creating or validating the market for your service/product, 
crowdfunding enables you to control the financing process in a way that no 
other business-financing option allows. An entrepreneur controls all aspects 
of the offering, from the dollar amount sought, to the timing of the issue, to 
the amount paid for assistance. Some portals (those that are affiliated with

Rift Acquisition?”ExtremeTech, March 26, 2014, www.extremetech.com/gaming/179258-

acquisition.

The JOBS Act
123
SEC-registered broker/dealers) will be allowed to charge for their services, 
but if a given portal seems to charge too much, others will probably spring up 
to offer crowdfunding services at a discount. Small investors are likely to be 
patient investors, too, and more willing to wait until the product or service 
proves itself in the marketplace, since the law prohibits them from placing the 
bulk of their net worth in any one venture.
Crowdfunders are responsible for all aspects of the effort, from choosing the 
site on which to list, to creating a “pitch” and other solicitation documents, 
to setting the terms of the transaction. Portals and broker dealers may struc-
ture the documents and give you options, but the final decision rests with the 
crowdfunded company. If they do not like listing conditions on one portal web 
site, they will go to another with better terms. In addition, crowdfunders do 
not, of necessity, need to give up a significant or majority portion of their own-
ership in their company to get money. Of course, what is a reasonable share of 
the firm to give up will vary. Standards will develop over time.
Most crowdfunders set a financial goal, in terms of the amount of money 
they are seeking to raise, but may exceed it. In what must be the most-
watched crowdfunding campaign, the Pebble: E-Paper Watch for iPhone and 
Android (Pebble Watch) sought to raise $100,000 and managed to raise over 
$10,000,0008 (as covered in Chapter 3).
In addition to the advantages noted in this section, note that, in most cases, if 
the initial effort to raise capital is unsuccessful, a business owner can retool 
the approach, typically using feedback obtained from the unsuccessful cam-
paign, and try again. Although the act puts an “all or nothing” rule in place, 
this has not traditionally been the case in the field. Some current sites allow 
crowdfunders to take what they have raised.
Drawbacks of Crowdfunding
As with any new instrument, there are drawbacks to this type of funding. 
It may not work. You may spend a great deal of time and effort trying to 
raise money, only to fall short. This can be stressful. Crowdfunding requires a 
level of transparency and openness that other forms of financing do not. To 
be successful, the crowdfunding effort must be consistent and diligent. This 
means that most successful crowdfunding efforts are well thought out, stay in 
constant contact with potential funders, and tell one story and stick with it. 
They may add data at the request of individuals, but they do not start by raising 
money for a film, for example, only to change to raising money for a book if 
they cannot raise enough to make a film.

Chapter 5 | Crowdfunding
124
The number of investors you will have to deal with via crowdfunding is typ-
ically far larger than that with traditional business financing. This, too, can 
be stressful. With traditional business financing, the number of investors an 
entrepreneur has to deal with (and keep happy) tends to be very small—one 
bank; one venture capital firm; or a few friend, family, and/or angel investors.
In addition, despite the ethical issues noted, for certain firms and in certain indus-
tries, the advice and counsel that traditional investors provide can be invaluable. 
Taking advice from a thousand small investors may be, at best, impractical.
■
■Note  The crowdfunding market is also likely to become saturated with similar projects. How 
to distinguish yourself, without giving away trade secrets, is bound to be a key question.
A Charitable Word
What if you just need a few dollars to pay a bill, handle a medical emergency, 
fund a short-term project or event? You don’t really want to create a company 
through crowdfunding to do so. Can crowdfunding still help? Yes. Many sites 
exist to fund these types of needs and projects. One is GoFundMe. GoFundMe 
allows you to set up a personal online fundraising web site. It serves as a useful 
alternative and counterpoint to the business-financing approach, while provid-
ing data that can be useful for those seeking to crowdfund a business.
GoFundMe was launched on May 10, 2010. In that time, it has grown to the 
point of now facilitating almost $2 billion in charitable donations per year!
Lessons:
• 
If you just need money for a project or a personal issue, 
use a crowdfunding web site focused on charitable dona-
tions, such as GoFundMe. Do not try to create a business 
to deal with a personal issue or project.
• 
On the charitable donation side, successful projects 
solicit small dollar amounts. This lesson applies to busi-
ness crowdfunding as well. The impact of fraud and 
misapplication of funds raised are minimal if the dollar 
amount sought is small.
• 
You must bring people to the crowdfunding party. These 
will probably be Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other 
social media friends, supplemented by non-social-media 
friends. This lesson applies to donation- and business-
based projects.
Figure 5-13 summarizes these relationships. The graphic includes three donation- 
or reward-based crowdfunding web sites, each representing a different sector.

crowdfunding-statistics
For the most part, their information matches what we stated earlier, namely, 
that smaller crowdfunding “goals are more attainable. They calculate that the 
average successful crowdfunding raises $7,000 and the average campaign lasts 
around nine weeks.” They also note that initial traction is important. It seems 
that “campaigns that can gain 30 percent of their goal within the first week are 
more likely to succeed.”
To reemphasize that “social media is a critical factor in crowdfunding suc-
cess,” Fundable notes that “for every order of magnitude increase in Facebook 
friends (from 10, to 100, to 1,000), the probability of success increases drasti-
cally (from 9 percent, to 20 percent, to 40 percent).”
By way of introduction to crowdfunding in general, another web site, Fundable, 
has posted a few key statistics on crowdfunding, which we reproduce here.9
Figure 5-13. Three donation- or reward-based crowdfunding web sites

Chapter 5 | Crowdfunding
126
Fundable’s research notes that crowdfunding remains a young person’s game: 
those with “ages 24–35 are much more likely to participate in crowdfunding 
campaigns; those over 45 are significantly less likely to back campaigns. Finally, 
the web site notes that persons “earning over $100,000 per year are the most 
likely to invest in startups through crowdfunding.”
Kickstarter is closest to a web site focusing on for-profit ventures, given its suc-
cess with the Pebble Watch. Kickstarter also has an affinity for art and artistic 
projects, including computer software. Indiegogo also has a large number of 
artistic projects on its site. GoFundMe seems to focus on the charitable, with 
many projects that seek to provide financing for personal medical and other 
health-related needs. Where Kickstarter and GoFundMe seem to overlap is in 
their focus on projects aimed at meeting personal needs or achieving personal 
gain. This does not mean all of these projects are selfish, just that they are per-
sonal. Indiegogo10 and GoFundMe seem to focus on artistic and personal proj-
ects. These are rough approximations of the focal areas, however. Figure 5-13 
may help you decide which type of crowdfunding web site to solicit.
Assuming you have now separated your personal financial needs from your 
business-financing needs, it is time to discuss how to crowdfund for a business.
How to Crowdfund
Even with the disadvantages noted previously, crowdfunding is still a viable 
option for many firms. The question then becomes, how do you proceed? Let 
me note a few things:
• 
Rules governing the industry have been written, and you 
can now act as a crowdfunding intermediary. The Division 
of Corporation Finance also has reminded issuers that 
any offers or sales of securities that rely on the crowd-
funding exemption are now lawful under the federal secu-
rities laws since the SEC’s rule making is complete.”11
10On November 15, 2016, Indiegogo announced a partnership with equity crowdfunding 
platform Microventures. The announcement came with this disclosure: “Indiegogo.com is a 
website owned and operated by Indiegogo, Inc., which is not a broker-dealer, funding portal 
or investment advisor; and neither the website nor Indiegogo, Inc. participate in the offer 
or sale of securities. All securities related activity is conducted through First Democracy 
VC, a registered funding portal and member of FINRA or MicroVenture Marketplace, Inc., 
a registered broker-dealer and member FINRA/SIPC. No communication, through this 
website, email or in any other medium, should be construed as a recommendation for any 
securities offering.”

■Tip  There is no substitute for a crowdfunding effort that is honest, compelling, and authentic. 
Combined with the sense of fulfillment your investors will get from seeing their dollars go to a 
deserving individual (you), and not a bureaucratic organization, your campaign will have a better 
chance of succeeding. And remember, as with any effort—as long as it’s authentic—marketing 
and publicity can make the difference. 
• 
As of this writing, several SEC-approved web sites exist 
where you can legally issue equity (stock) to nonaccred-
ited investors to fund your small business in the United 
States. You still need to think early, often, and carefully 
about the issues and the opportunity. As promised, we 
provide updates. In addition, several web sites have current 
updates related to the JOBS Act, including www.nation-
alcrowdfundingservices.com, www.creativeinvest.
com, and http://crowdfundingnow.blogspot.com.
• 
Consider what you are doing. Does the market really 
exist for your product or service? What makes you spe-
cial? How complicated is your idea/product/service? 
Complicated is not necessarily bad; it just means it may be 
more difficult for the public to understand what you are 
doing, and consequently, they may not invest right away.
VentureBeat looked at the first few Title III crowdfunding campaigns and came away with the 
following guidelines:12
• 
Easy-to-understand concept = more money.
• 
Everyday products engage investors.
• 
Management experience is key.
• 
Lack of transparency is a deal killer.
• 
Failure isn’t necessarily bad.

• 
Consider your current network. Do you know enough 
people to get started? As noted earlier, the average 
GoFundMe user had 482 Facebook friends, and this was 
sufficient to raise, on average, just over $1,000.00. At the 
end of the day, crowdfunding is all about the crowd. Do 
you have one? If not, how quickly can you create one? 
Will they buy what you are selling?
• 
Even if you have a crowd, how will you promote your effort? 
Will you hire outsiders to do so? Firms are sure to spring 
up to help. How will you decide whether to use one?
• 
What makes you think you can make money doing what 
you propose to do? Have you “run the numbers”? How 
much money can you make? How much will it cost to 
provide the proposed good or service?
• 
How will you reward your investors? Is owning a piece of 
your small company going to be enough?
• 
How will you deal with a few thousand “partners?” 
E-mail? Newsletter? Facebook? LinkedIn? Dedicated 
investor web site?
• 
What other crowdfunding projects have you studied? 
What worked for them? What didn’t?
■
■Note  If you want to succeed with a crowdfunded business, you need to do your homework. Get 
a book on starting a business, take a class in entrepreneurship, or work on your business degree. 
Even though it is easy for people to invest in your business through crowdfunding, that doesn’t 
mean they will. They will be looking very closely to assess your credibility as a businessperson.
How to Get Started
Many crowdfunding web sites currently exist. The following is a rundown of 
funding portals under the JOBS Act. The two biggest crowdfunding portals are 
Kickstarter and Indiegogo:
• 
Kickstarter: Launched in 2009 and focused on artistic 
endeavors, Kickstarter is the best-known crowdfund-
ing platform. According to statistics listed on the site, 
111,419 successful campaigns have raised a total of $2.5 
billion on Kickstarter as of September 2, 2016.
• 
Indiegogo:. Online since 2008. According to one of the 
founders, the site is “open to any campaign, any idea, 

The JOBS Act
129
­anywhere in the world.” Most industry observers expect 
Indiegogo to create an equity-financing platform in keep-
ing with the JOBS Act.
Keep in mind that these are not JOBS Act crowdfunding portals. Rather, these 
are the firms that existed before the law was enacted.
Funding Portals Regulated by the SEC
The web sites listed in Table 5-6 have gone through the time and trouble 
to register with the SEC and with FINRA, and are formal crowdfunding

Chapter 5 | Crowdfunding

In addition to these sites, entrepreneurs always have the option of posting a 
fundraising effort on their own web site or page. But note, you cannot, under 
the JOBS Act, create your own funding portal to raise money for your ven-
ture. You can, however, create a web site that points to another web site that 
provides detail on your venture. We provide much more information on this 
in the Chapter 7.
Creating a Solicitation
Every crowdfunding web site has specific procedures for soliciting invest-
ments. This section outlines some general procedures. Most sites will want or 
require these elements.
Known as the pitch, a solicitation refers to the tools you use to ask for money. 
A comprehensive pitch has several characteristics:
• 
The elevator speech, a 30-second summary of your prod-
uct, service, and company. Many suggest the creation of 
a “high concept” tagline, a sentence or two that gleans 
the absolute essence of the product or service. I do not. 
If you can do so, then do so, but some things are more 
complicated than this. If your effort falls into this category 
(and think very hard about this), then don’t try.
• 
An all-inclusive description of the problem the business 
is designed to address. This does not mean you have to 
build a company around a complicated need. The prob-
lem can be as simple as the lack of a good day-care facility 
in your neighborhood, or the fact that your block is miss-
ing a good tapas place. You just have to be fully descrip-
tive about the nature of this issue.
• 
An expansive definition of and a few words on the com-
petition, complete with a full description of how your 
business will deal with them.
• 
Under any circumstances, you should be able to briefly 
and simply describe what you are trying to do. It does 
not have to be comprehensive, but it must be informative, 
specific, and allow people to visualize what you are doing.
The Deck
Once you have these items, you are ready to create a ten-slide PowerPoint 
presentation (not including the cover) that describes your business. You will 
use this to create and supplement your crowdfunding web site solicitation. I 
have included a blank deck in Appendix C.

The JOBS Act
131
Contents of the Deck
I suggest the following:
	1.	 Cover slide. Place as much of the information required 
by the act on this slide as possible. This includes informa-
tion on the location of the business, the web site, e-mail 
address, and other data.
	2.	 Summary. This is a short, one- to three-sentence state-
ment that presents, in a concise way, what you do or are 
trying to do. The best summaries are clear, helpful, seri-
ous and humorous at the same time, and, again, concise.
	3.	 Team. This is where you describe the members of your 
firm. If you aren’t working with anyone, that’s OK. You 
just have to explain how you can do what you need to do 
by yourself, or describe your plan for getting help when 
you need it.
	4.	 Problem. What is the nature of the issue you seek to 
address? Remember, this does not have to be compli-
cated. It can be a basic or common problem. You just 
have to say what it is in a manner that will encourage 
investors to support you, financially.
	5.	 Solution. Describe how you will address the issue you 
identified.
	6.	 Marketing. Describe, briefly, the size of the market, in local 
terms if it is a local problem (my day-care center will 
capture 10 percent of the local day-care market) or in 
national terms if you are selling nationally (my product 
will generate $X in revenue).
	7.	 Sales. Now that you have described the problem, the 
solution, and the market, how will you get your product 
or service into the hands of people who need it?
	8.	 Competition. Who else provides the goods or services 
that you do (or are planning to do)?
	9.	 Goals. Look at the next three or four calendar quarters 
(every three months). Describe what will you accomplish, 
in terms of making money (or other goals, if you won’t 
make money that soon).
	10.	 Financing. How much money do you need?
Here is what this sequence says,

Chapter 5 | Crowdfunding
132
“Look, there is this problem. We have a team of one or more people to 
address this problem. We are going to provide a solution to this specific issue 
in this specific way to these specific people. We will make this much money. 
Isn’t this great? Don’t you want to be a part of the solution? Well, by investing 
this much money, you can.”
This approach works because it is, at once, flexible, general, and specific to 
your venture. You could be discussing a day-care center, a hair salon, a bio-
technology firm, anything. It’s all in how you summarize.
Taxes and Crowdfunding
Any money derived from an investment effort leading to the delivery of a 
commercial product is typically taxable, because federal and state entities see 
this revenue as income. As a result, any project in this category is going to be 
levied at prevailing tax rates, whether it is offered as art, technology, or manu-
factured goods. No matter whether you want to manufacture a bike, make a 
movie, or create a video game, you need to pay taxes. The only exceptions are 
nonprofits (NPs) or nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and you need to 
get recognition from the IRS for these.
Summary
Crowdfunding has the potential to significantly increase the amount of capital 
flowing to small firms, known in the act as EGCs. It also has the potential to 
damage those firms, by subjecting them to burdensome and onerous reporting.
The following factors might impact your ability to be successful at crowdfunding:
• 
Early Adapter Syndrome (EAS): There is a guy in my building 
who is a crowdfunding junkie. Daily, he tells me about the 
latest gadget he just bought on Indiegogo or Kickstarter. 
He must be the first to own the latest toy. Here’s the thing: 
he has grown quite knowledgeable about both technol-
ogy and selecting tech products. His success ratio has 
grown to near 100 percent now. He can spot a troubled 
product or crowdfunding campaign a mile away. (Not a 
bad skill to have, actually.)
• 
Love: People participate in crowdfunding campaigns 
related to products, services, and causes they feel excited 
about. They love what you, the crowdfunder, are doing. 
Now, part of the issue is making sure that the love comes 
through. If there is a disconnect, people will not know 
that they love what you are doing.

The JOBS Act
133
• 
Community: What you are crowdfunding speaks to the 
community, whatever that community is. It can be a small 
or large group of people who are, or may be, impacted by 
what you are doing. They love it (see the preceding item), 
love you for doing it, and are willing to part with a few 
dollars to help you (and the community) out.
• 
Belief: They like you. They really, really do. Not only do 
they like you, but they
• 
Want to be the first to own (or help)
• 
Love what you are doing
• 
Think it will help and, with respect to investment 
crowdfunding, think they will profit
• 
Believe in you
What all of this points to is that being successful at crowdfunding requires 
major effort and deep thought concerning the business venture proposed. 
Who are you? Where are you? Who owns your business now? Do you mind 
giving up a portion of your business to people you don’t know? What do you 
bring to the table? Can you convince a group of strangers to give you money 
for what will be, in many cases, an unproven business venture? Should you try?
If you can’t answer these questions, you may want to think a little more about 
your business. Talk it over with trusted friends and family. Taking a free busi-
ness class would not be a bad thing to do even if you can answer the ques-
tions. (Search Google for business startup class or go to Yahoo Small Business 
Advisor, online at http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/.) You may 
want to partner with someone. You may even want to drop the whole thing. 
But, if you’ve come this far, I don’t think you will.
The next chapter reviews the details of what Title III crowdfunding costs, at 
least according to the SEC. I have posted links to firms and other information 
for your review.

What Title III 
Crowdfunding 
Costs
Under the final rules for crowdfunding, the SEC (the commission) has devel-
oped detailed cost estimates for Title III JOBS Act issuers. These estimates 
cover the cost of each requirement imposed on issuers. This chapter describes 
these estimates and offers my perspective. As an initial cost guide, I think 
these estimates will be of interest to those considering JOBS Act crowdfund-
ing under Title III.
Exclusions
Before we get started, let’s go over the firms and individuals who are not eli-
gible to use crowdfunding under the JOBS Act. The first are those who have 
not filed timely reports with the commission. If you previously sold securities 
by using the exclusions granted by the JOBS Act, but did not file the required 
annual reports with either investors or the commission, then the commis-
sion does not trust you enough to let you use crowdfunding again. Other 
exclusions relate to persons barred from doing business with securities, firms, 
banks, credit unions, and others.

Chapter 6 | What Title III Crowdfunding Costs
136
The final rules also exclude a specific set of individuals and firms. These are 
called ineligible issuers:
• 
Foreign issuers (not organized under the laws of the 
United States, a territory or a state)
• 
A firm already required to file reports under Section 13 
or Section 15(d) of the 1934 SEC Act
• 
An investment company defined in Section 3 of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940, or excluded from the 
definition of investment company by Section 3(b) or 3(c) 
of that act (15 USC 80a-3(b) or 15 USC 80a-3(*c))
• 
Is disqualified as specified under 227.503(a)
• 
Convicted within 10 years of any felony or misdemeanor
• 
In connection with the sale of a security
• 
Involved in making a false statement to the 
commission
• 
Arising out of conduct as an underwriter, broker, 
dealer, municipal securities dealer, investment 
advisor, funding portal, or paid solicitor of 
purchasers of securities
• 
Is subject to any order, judgment, or decree within five 
years that restrains or enjoins the person from engaging 
or continuing to engage in any conduct or practice:
• 
In connection with the sale of a security
• 
Involved in making a false statement to the 
commission
• 
Arising out of conduct as an underwriter, broker, 
dealer, municipal securities dealer, investment 
advisor, funding portal, or paid solicitor of 
purchasers of securities.
• 
Is subject to a federal banking agency, CFTC, NCUA, or 
state securities commission order that bars a person 
from association with a regulated entity barring the per-
son from doing the following:
• 
Associating with a regulated entity
• 
Engaging in the credit union, saving association, 
securities, insurance, or banking business

The JOBS Act
137
• 
Is delinquent in filing required annual reports with the 
commission and with investors
• 
Has no business plan or simply plans to raise money to 
merge or acquire another company or companies
You get the idea. The SEC is using its regulatory track record to impose a set 
of exclusions. I have some problems with this. After all, while the rules seek to 
exclude those the commission has deemed “bad actors,” it is silent on firms 
such as Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, and others who caused the financial 
crisis that gave rise to the need for crowdfunding in the first place.
These exclusions are likely to eliminate the worst potential actors, to the 
short-term benefit of the newly formed crowdfunding industry. They are also 
likely to allow other large firms that should be excluded to participate, to 
the long-term detriment of the crowdfunding marketplace. These exclusions 
are also likely to snare those who simply disagree with certain aspects of the 
commission’s regulatory enforcement track record (or lack thereof ).
Estimate of Issuer Cost 
Assuming you are not excluded from participating, the next section provides 
estimates of the cost to issue securities under the Title III section of the JOBS 
Act. These cost estimates were provided by the commission as part of the 
final Regulation Crowdfunding rule-making process. I used these estimates to 
create a financial model of crowdfunding. (Note that this is not our model, 
which will be developed in later parts of this book and updated online, but, 
rather, this reflects the thinking of the key JOBS Act regulator, for better or 
for worse.)
Broadly, cost categories are detailed as follows:
• 
Platform and portal fees: This charge reflects the fact that 
issuers pay a fee to be listed on a crowdfunding platform.
• 
Cost to fill out and submit Form C: Form C (discussed fur-
ther in Appendix A) is the main disclosure document 
required by the JOBS Act for Title III crowdfunding.
• 
Cost to submit the issuer’s annual report: This reflects the 
cost to fill out and submit the Form C-AR annual report.
• 
Financial statement review costs: Under the JOBS Act, issu-
ers must provide potential investors with an indepen-
dent accounting review or audit. The requirement varies 
depending on the amount of capital being raised. For 
those raising less than $100,000, financial statements ver-
ified by the chief executive officer suffice. For campaigns 

Chapter 6 | What Title III Crowdfunding Costs
138
seeking between $100,000 and $500,000, reviewed finan-
cial statements are required. If you are seeking to raise 
between $500,000 and $1,000,000, audited financial 
statements are required.
The final rules provide a range of estimates for each of these costs  
(see Table 6-1).

At the low end, the commission estimates that it will cost issues (you) from 
$6,670 to 11,700 to raise $100,000 or less. Raising from $100,000 to $500,000 
will cost from $20,000 to $56,000, and raising over $500,000 will cost from 
$48,000 to $120,000.

costs graphically.

At the lower end, Figure 6-3 shows the cost for an offering of up to $100,000.
Figure 6-3.  Range of costs to launch a crowdfunding campaign up to $100,000. (Source: SEC.)
Note that the estimated fees for Form C and annual report preparation are 
the same at the high and low end, $2,500 and $1,667, respectively. I think the 
SEC is effectively setting the price for these services. In other words, if you 
are a third-party service provider offering these services for issuers, the SEC 
seems to be saying that you should not charge more than the amounts listed.
Financial statement review costs are zero, because below $100,000, issuers 
are allowed to submit financial statements signed and verified by the CEO.
For offerings between $100,000 and $500,000, the SEC estimates costs 
as noted in Table 6-1 and Figure 6-4. Platform fees range from $15,000 to 
$30,000. The cost to file Form C is estimated to range from $2,500 (the cost 
for firms raising $100,000 or less) to $5,000. Annual report (Form C-AR) 
fees range from $1,667 (again, the cost for firms raising $100,000 or less) to 
$3,333. Financial statement review fees range from $1,500 to $18,000.

The JOBS Act
141
For offerings between $500,000 and $1,000,000, the SEC estimates that plat-
forms will charge issuers from $37,500 to $56,250. The cost to file Form C 
will, under these estimates, range from $5,000 (the upper end of the range for 
firms raising $100,000 to $500,000) to $20,000. Annual report (Form C-AR) 
fees range from $3,333 (again, the upper end of the range for firms rais-
ing $100,000 to $500,000) to $13,333. Financial statement review fees range 
from $2,500 to $30,000.

Summary
The SEC estimates that raising less than $100,000 will cost you between 
$6,700 and $11,700. Raising from $100,000 to $500,000 will cost from 
$20,000 to $56,000, and raising more than $500,000 will cost from $48,000 to 
$120,000. Given these costs, the next chapter looks at the anticipated revenue 
and profit for the Title III crowdfunding industry as a whole.

Portals
Crowdfunding Industry Model
In order to crowdfund, you need a portal. In this chapter, I expand on the JOBS 
Act rules governing these critical entities. I also review our estimates, based 
on SEC data, for total revenue and profit by platform type and for the industry 
as a whole.
What Is a Portal? 
A crowdfunding portal, or funding platform, is an intermediary that stands 
between an entrepreneur or business owner seeking money and the people 
with the money. Note that although Indiegogo and Kickstarter are both por-
tals, they are not JOBS Act Portals, because they do not broker equity shares 
in companies (yet).
A portal can take any organizational form. You can create a portal as an indi-
vidual, cooperative, partnership, LLC, or corporation.
In whatever form, a portal must register with the SEC as either a broker or a 
funding portal (as defined in Section 3(a)(80) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934). A portal must also register with the securities industry’s sole regula-
tory agency, FINRA.
7

Chapter 7 | Portals
144
Funding platforms or portals are web sites created for the sale of EGC securi-
ties. By law, they have four, and only four, responsibilities. They must:
• 
Register with the SEC and FINRA
• 
Provide risk and investor education materials
• 
Ensure that investors understand risk
• 
Manage the crowdfunding process
Table 7-1 shows the regulatory options for funding portals.

(C) Compensate employees, agents, or other 
persons for such solicitation or based on the 
sale of securities displayed or referenced on 
its web site or portal; can take securities as 
compensation for services.
(D) Hold, manage, possess, or otherwise 
handle investor funds or securities.
(E) Engage in such other activities as the 
commission, by rule, determines appropriate.

The JOBS Act
145
■
■Note  On January 29, 2016, the SEC approved FINRA’s rules and forms for funding portals. 
Funding portals cannot make investment recommendations or offer advice, or hold investor funds. 
Portals can take a percentage of the offering in exchange for services provided.
FINRA notes that “The Funding Portal Rules consist of a set of seven rules (Funding Portal Rules 
100, 110, 200, 300, 800, 900 and 1200) and related forms (Form FP-NMA, Form FP-CMA, Funding 
Portal Rule 300(c) Form, and Form FP-Statement of Revenue).” You can find these rules at http://
finra.complinet.com/en/display/display_main.html?rbid=2403&element_
id=12218.
Responsibilities of Portals 
Portals have critical responsibilities. They must provide investor education 
and risk disclosures, subject to a review by the SEC to determine the appro-
priateness of those disclosures. Table  7-2 shows the four responsibilities 
funding portals have.
Table 7-2.  Responsibilities of Funding Portals

EGC
Review background, including name, legal status, physical address, 
and web site address of EGC issuers.
Make sure EGCs do not get funding if they do not reach funding 
goal.
Make sure portal directors, officers, or partners do not have a 
financial interest in any EGC issuer using the portal.
Portals not only have to ensure that investors understand that they risk los-
ing their entire investment in an EGC stock issue, but also have to verify that 
these investors can afford to do so. That’s right—portals must make sure 
that investors affirm that they can afford to lose their entire investment in a 
crowdfunding issuer.

Chapter 7 | Portals
146
To determine this, portals have to question and quiz EGC investors. EGC 
investors have to demonstrate their level of understanding concerning the 
riskiness of investments in EGCs and small companies.
■
■Note  If you are considering investing in a crowdfunding EGC company, you can get a head 
start on educating yourself about risks in this sector. Look at the State of Virginia’s “A Consumer’s 
Guide to Small Business Investments” online at www.scc.virginia.gov/srf/cons/files/
secsmbus.pdf.
EGC investors also have to demonstrate an understanding of liquidity, defined 
as the ability to quickly turn an asset into cash. EGC shares are assumed to be 
illiquid, so if it turns out that investors need the cash invested back quickly, say, 
one month after buying an EGC’s shares, too bad. They may be locked into 
the EGC investment for at least a year. I say may because some are working on 
portal business models that address this issue, perhaps by taking EGC shares 
from you in exchange for a short-term loan. As of now, however, you should 
assume that you will not be able to trade or sell your crowdfunding securities 
for at least one year.
Portals also have a role to play in fraud prevention and reduction. They are 
responsible for obtaining a “background and securities enforcement regula-
tory history check on each officer, director, and person holding more than 20 
percent of the outstanding equity of every (EGC) issuer.”
Recall that, according to the JOBS Act, EGC issuers get investors’ money only 
when they meet or exceed their capital-raising target. If, as an EGC you say 
you want to raise $1,000,000, then to get any money at all, you must do so. 
You will not be able to have a target of $1,000,000 and get, say, $500,000. 
Portals are responsible for making sure that this is the case. Of course, the 
way around this is to set your sights lower. Most EGCs will seek to raise a 
minimal amount of capital. This may lead to sequential EGC issues, as these 
firms come back to the crowdfunding marketplace repeatedly. But as long as 
they are below the $1 million per year capital-raising limit, this should not be 
an impediment.
Portals must also ensure that investors do not exceed the investment limits 
outlined in the law. They must protect the privacy of information provided by 
EGC crowdfunding investors.
In addition, portals cannot pay for leads. They can’t buy lists of investors, but 
must develop an investor database organically. You cannot create a portal to 
finance companies in which you have any financial interest, but you can be 
compensated in shares of stock (or debt) offered. Your offer has to be exactly 
the same as what’s being offered to everyone else.

The JOBS Act
147
■
■Note  How will portals make money? The SEC thinks they will earn money by charging 
companies that want to raise capital. We review the crowdfunding portal and crowdfunding 
industry model in later parts of this chapter.
The JOBS Act provides an exemption from registration as a broker/dealer for 
portals that consent to examination by the SEC, that are a member of the only 
national securities association, known as FINRA. FINRA is required to develop 
specific rules for funding portal members.
Funding portals regulated by FINRA cannot offer investment advice. They 
cannot say, for example, “Shares in Portal Member X are better than shares 
in Portal Member Y.” Although they can advertise, they cannot ask you to buy 
securities listed on their site. They must be perfectly neutral with respect to 
the relative value between competing EGC issuers. They cannot pay “employ-
ees, agents or other persons” or someone else to solicit buyers for the EGC 
securities listed on their site, but they can take securities in exchange for ser-
vices.1 Portals cannot hold or manage investor funds or securities.
I noted in Chapter 1 that the JOBS Act limits the ability of a state or gov-
ernmental subdivision to enforce laws against portals, but the JOBS Act 
makes clear that state security regulators can launch enforcement actions 
against portals or EGC issuers or other persons claiming a security registra-
tion exemption under the JOBS Act if these actions are related to a “law or 
administrative action of a state in which the principal location of the funding 
portal is located,” or if the law or administrative action is consistent with SEC 
requirements for funding portals.”
The act also clarifies that most states cannot require EGC issuers to pay state 
security registration, or filing fees. States where the EGC is located or states 
where more than 50 percent of the EGC issue purchasers reside have the 
option to impose filing fees, however.
States cannot “enforce any law, rule, regulation, or other administrative action 
against a registered funding portal.” States do have the ability to examine and 
enforce state laws that do not conflict with SEC rules.
1This financial interest is legal only if it is “compensation for the offer/sale of securities.” 
Direct investments in companies offering securities on a platform are prohibited. To be 
legal, these securities must be “the same class … and same terms as those in the offering.”

A Word of Caution 
Choosing a broker or funding portal requires careful thought. Given recent 
history, I would not be surprised to see crowdfunding portal scams become 
more prevalent. One sure sign will be fees. If someone offers to help you take 
advantage of crowdfunding by offering services for a steep fee, you should be 
on guard. Why? Someone offering to help you raise money over the Internet 
in exchange for hefty fees may be looking to take advantage of those who are 
not fully familiar with the act (hence, this book).
Of course, it may be that the person(s) offering the service are themselves 
unfamiliar with the act. As you now know, this is a complicated law, full of 
seemingly contradictory language and other potential pitfalls. You need to be 
sure that the people helping you are fully familiar with the law. (Ask whether 
they have read this book.)
This is important because of the consequences of violating the law. If your 
crowdfunding offering is not legal, it becomes unregistered. This means it is not 
compliant with SEC rules and regulations. If this happens, you may be liable 
for putting forward an illegal security offering. If you have concerns, make sure 
you consult a lawyer, or call FINRA to see whether the broker or funding 
portal offering the service is registered.
Even if you are successful, other factors come into play. Significantly increasing 
the number of partners you have may cause you to lose focus. The day-to-day 
operations of the business may suffer as a result. This may be a risk worth 
taking, however, especially if you have no other potential source of funding.
A final concern may be the unwillingness of big investors to invest in your 
firm after you have, say, 65,000 small investors, as Pebble Watch potentially has  
(if everyone who participated in their campaign had also become an investor 
in the firm). This is, in reality, of limited concern. Private equity funds and other 
small business investors will follow the money and adapt their business mod-
els to deal with an increased number of very small investors in the companies 
they buy, if they have to.
Transferring and Trading Crowdfunded Securities
At some point, portals will become facilitators for trading crowdfunding secu-
rities. This will be a significantly enhanced set of responsibilities, but there is 
no requirement in the JOBS Act that portals or funding platforms offer this 
service.

The JOBS Act
149
Rules regarding the transfer or trading of crowdfunded securities are, how-
ever, outlined and specifically limited by the JOBS Act. Crowdfunded securities 
must be held for, at minimum, one year from the date of purchase. The JOBS 
Act allows only four exemptions to that rule. Crowdfunded securities can be 
transferred under the following circumstances:
• 
They are transferred to the issuer of the securities.
• 
They are transferred to an accredited investor.
• 
They are transferred as part of an SEC registered offering.
• 
They are transferred to a member of the family of the 
purchaser; or in connection with the death or divorce 
of the purchaser or other similar circumstance, at the 
discretion of the commission.
Note that any purchaser of crowdfunded securities, meaning a security issued 
through a crowdfunding portal or funding platform, is exempt from the trading 
restriction if the security purchaser is on tribal territory “or other lands not 
subject to state or federal law,” is subject to SEC reporting requirements, or 
is an investment company.2
■
■Note  Most portals will probably develop trading capabilities at some point. But the restrictions 
noted in this section will still apply.
This is a huge exemption, because mutual funds, closed-end funds, unit invest-
ment trusts, investment advisors, broker/dealers, and public companies are all 
subject to SEC reporting requirements. These entities will be able to trade 
crowdfunded securities at will. Members of the general public will not, subject 
to the five exemptions listed previously. This means that there may come 
a day when “investment companies” dominate the market for crowdfunded 
securities.
■
■Note  The exemptions for investment companies, broker dealers, and other industry players 
show how much power the financial services industry still has in Washington. We can only hope 
that these institutions will not get in the way of crowdfunding.
2According to the SEC, “an ‘investment company’ is a company (corporation, business  
trust, partnership, or limited liability company) that issues securities and is primarily 
engaged in the business of investing in securities.” See www.sec.gov/answers/mfinvco.

Chapter 7 | Portals

This exemption creates an enhanced risk of fraud—not from EGCs, but from 
investment companies. In the search for higher returns and competitive advan-
tage, an investment company or group of investment companies may facilitate 
the creation of fraudulent “crowdfunded” securities. They would then seek 
to create demand for these securities by trading them among themselves at 
ever higher prices, finally allowing the general public in right before prices fall 
to reflect actual (much lower) value.
Such a scheme might work as follows. Investment Company A buys crowd-
funded Security 1 for $10. It arranges for Investment Company B to buy the 
crowdfunded Security 1 for $20, with a promise that Investment Company A 
will, at some later point, buy new crowdfunded Security 2 from Investment 
Company B at an inflated price. Investment Company B gets Investment 
Company C to buy crowdfunded Security 1 for $30, with a similar promise. 
Investment Company C sells crowdfunded Security 1 to members of the pub-
lic for $40. Crowdfunded Security 1 is, however, worth only $10. The public 
eventually takes the loss.
As of this writing, it looks like the only people who will not be able to trade 
crowdfunded securities before the year-long holding period is over are the 
people who need the ability to do so—low- and middle-income investors.
A Tale of Two Portals
Kickstarter and Indiegogo are the two most widely recognized donation-
based crowdfunding portals. They have fundamentally different views on the 
future of equity crowdfunding. Indiegogo raised $15 million in additional cap-
ital so that it can move swiftly into equity crowdfunding.3 Kickstarter has 
taken the opposite path, and has said that it will not participate in the equity 
crowdfunding market.4 Their experience should be useful to anyone looking 
at the crowdfunding experience as a guide for how finding investors through 
a portal might work.

Kickstarter
Kickstarter is a venture-capital-backed web site that facilitates the provision of 
financing for creative projects. Funding for projects on the site is provided by 
the general public. Three people—Perry Chen, Yancey Strickler, and Charles 
Adler—created the site in 2008. On June 22, 2012, Kickstarter began publish-
ing statistics about projects hosted on the site. Table 7-3 provides summary 
statistics as of October 6, 2016. (Keep in mind that a project must meet its 
funding goals to move forward.)

The JOBS Act
153
By any stretch of the imagination, this is a remarkable track record. The site 
has facilitated the collection and distribution of $2.6 billion in contributions 
for over 320,000 projects launched on the site, 113,169 of which were suc-
cessful (three out of ten). In other words, a large number of people raised the 
money they sought.
Fifty-seven percent of successful projects were in the $1,000 to $10,000 range, 
an admittedly wide, but nonetheless impressive, range. Even more interesting, 
31 percent of successful projects sought and received more than $10,000.
Of course, many projects were not funded. What is important to note is 
this: the majority, 62 percent, of these projects never reached the 20 per-
cent funded level, meaning that potential contributors seem to know early 
on whether a project is a good deal. This threshold nonfunding percentage 
has grown from 60 percent in 2012 to 62 percent by 2016, meaning that the 
crowd is getting smarter. I believe this reflects the growing “wisdom of the 
crowd” and have every reason to believe this wisdom will carry over into the 
JOBS Act equity funding marketplace.
The lesson here is clear: if you want to be successful at crowdfunding, at least 
for now, it is important to bring enough of your friends and family along to 
immediately reach at least 20 percent of your funding goal. So, if you are look-
ing for $10,000, make sure you have pledges for $2,000. And please note the 
following: putting in $2K of your own money will not help. The crowdfunding 
community will want to see a lot of little investments from a large number of

people. This will give confidence to others that you at least have some com-
munity support to start with.
Indiegogo
The second of the two largest crowdfunding web sites currently operational, 
Indiegogo, seems to have a different focus. It is a softer, more cause-related web 
site than Kickstarter, which seems to have more commercially viable projects 
on its site.
Started in 2008 by Danae Ringelmann, Slava Rubin, and Eric Schell, and headquar-
tered in San Francisco, California, Indiegogo has as of 2012, “hosted over 100,000 
funding campaigns in areas such as music, charity, small business and film.”
As of the time of this writing, the site has garnered significant attention and 
positive feedback for its campaign to raise funds for an elderly school bus 
monitor, Karen Klein, after a video surfaced showing the woman being brutally 
and mercilessly harassed by schoolchildren. As of July 10, 2012, the campaign 
raised $680,354 for her, most of it in the first 48 hours. This is an example of 
the power of this medium. This is an example of the power of this medium. 
If you are planning an arts-related, cause-sensitive company, Indiegogo may be 
the place to start, for now.
The Title III Crowdfunding Industry Under the 
JOBS Act
One of the great things about the SEC is that it is required by law to estimate 
the cost of regulations. The JOBS Act is a regulation of massive scope and 
potential scale, so the SEC spent a good deal of effort estimating the potential 
impact the new law might have on the startup financing marketplace. We can 
use these estimates to get a feel for the costs and benefits from this emerging 
marketplace, at least as far as the SEC is concerned. One thing we can say with 
certainty is that these estimates will probably not be accurate to the penny, 
however. They are simply meant as a guide to one potential outcome of the 
new law.
Basis for the Estimates
The SEC estimates that 1,900 firms and issuers will launch Title III crowd-
funding efforts per year. It bases this estimate on historical data showing the 
number of firms that have used existing exemptions to raise capital of up to 
$1 million per year.

The JOBS Act
155
The SEC further estimates that 110 crowdfunding platforms will be created. 
Of this, they estimate that ten will not be currently registered with the com-
mission and will choose to register as broker/dealers. Fifty current broker/
dealers will dip their toes into the Title III crowdfunding waters, according to 
the SEC. Another fifty firms will register as funding portals. Two of these will 
be foreign firms. Figure 7-3 shows the industry breakout.
Recall that in Chapter 5 we estimated, using data from the SEC, the cost of 
crowdfunding for the individual entrepreneur or firm. We can use those fig-
ures to estimate the total industry revenue, now that we have an estimate of 
the number of Title III issues per year and the number of platforms. Before we 
do that, however, we need to estimate costs incurred for both creating and 
operating a crowdfunding platform. These are shown in Figure 7-4.
Figure 7-3. Title III crowdfunding industry profile by number of platforms, by type. New BD =  
New Broker/Dealer. Current BD = Existing Broker/Dealer. Funding Platform = Intermediary 
registered using Form FP. Foreign = Non-US-based platform.

Chapter 7 | Portals
156
For funding platforms, we estimate costs at $347,900. Costs for new broker/
dealers will be $322,862. Costs are lower for existing broker/dealers who 
decide to offer Title III crowdfunding services, because they already have com-
pliance and other assets they can use to immediately become active Title III 
crowdfunding facilitators. For these firms, costs are estimated at $293,857. 
Foreign broker/dealers face the highest cost burden, given heightened compli-
ance costs. We estimate their costs will average $374,279.
Next, we make certain assumptions about fees generated from Title III crowd-
funding offerings. We use these assumptions to estimate total revenue for 
each platform, by type of platform. This is a simple estimate to make: we 
assume that potential revenue is equally distributed among all firms. Each firm 
has a chance to generate $421,458 in revenue.
Projected platform income is determined by subtracting costs from this rev-
enue figure. This, in turn, determines the profitability of each platform by type. 
Figure 7-5 shows this result.
Figure 7-4.  SEC crowdfunding industry profile, total cost by type of platform

The JOBS Act
157
For funding platforms, we calculate income of $73,559. For new broker/
dealers, we estimate income will be $98,597. Income is higher for existing 
broker/dealers because costs are lower. For these firms, income is estimated 
at $127,602. Foreign broker/dealers, who face the highest costs, have cor-
respondingly lower income. We estimate income at $47,180 for these firms.
Industry Profitability
For the industry as a whole, the SEC’s framework gives us a basis we can use 
to estimate total revenue and total profitability by type of platform, which we 
do in this section.
The SEC estimates that platforms will charge from $2,500 to $56,250. Using 
an average of this estimate, we calculate that each platform will generate 
$421,458 in revenue from 17 successful offerings. Since the SEC has forecast 
there will be 110 platforms, we calculate industry revenue at $46,360,417 
($421,458 × 110). Figure 7-6 shows total revenue by type of platform.

How to Use This Data
The preceding information may be of use if and when you select a Title III 
crowdfunding platform. As the data shows, current broker/dealers who cre-
ate crowdfunding platforms are in the best position to make money under the 
SEC JOBS Act rules. You may want to consider working with funding platforms 
or platforms owned by foreign companies to gain some type of competitive 
or cost advantage. These platforms may develop into a lower-cost alternative, 
although it remains to be seen just what these types of platforms will charge.
Depending on national economic and industry trends, these estimates may or 
may not be accurate. They might be completely off. Under either circumstance, 
you will want to carefully evaluate the type of platform you are working with, 
should you consider raising money using Title III of the JOBS Act at all.
Summary
Portals are intermediaries in crowdfunding transactions. They must register 
with the SEC and one or more self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA. 
The JOBS Act mandates that portals provide education, specifically on the 
risks of investing in securities via crowdfunding. Investors must certify, and 
portals must confirm they understand the risk of investing in EGCs.
Figure 7-6.  Crowdfunding industry revenue, by type of platform

The JOBS Act
159
Portals manage the EGC investing process, seeking to reduce the risk of fraud 
and ensuring that EGCs do not receive funds raised until the crowdfunding 
campaign meets stated dollar-financing goals. They must ensure that portal 
directors, officers, and partners do not have a financial interest in EGCs seek-
ing financing.
From past experience, we know that successful portals exhibit a certain 
authenticity and transparency. The release, by Kickstarter, of its performance 
statistics is an example of transparency that we believe should become a JOBS 
Act crowdfunding industry standard.
The estimates calculated in this chapter confirm that the crowdfunding indus-
try is poised for significant growth. This happens, however, only if firms in the 
industry act, in an ethical and honest way, to facilitate startup and small busi-
ness funding.
When the first edition of this book was published, reportsindicated that there 
were over 450 crowdfunding platforms.5 In the intervening period, many have 
gone out of business. While there have been replacements, and the Title III 
JOBS Act industry is at a more mature stage, risks abound. New crowdfunding 
platforms are still springing up every day. Hopefully, the data in this chapter 
(and this book) will help you honestly evaluate the current players.
The next chapters review the JOBS Act itself.

The JOBS Act,  
by Title
In this part of the book, the chapters present each section of the JOBS Act, 
along with some comments and observations.
An Act of Congress, probably in reference to or short for an action that 
Congress took, is the starting point for the laws that govern the country. Most 
acts require something, prohibit or deny something, or suggest something that 
should be done.
Acts tend to be broken into sections, called titles. Each title typically concerns 
a given subject. In this case, the titles focus on various parts of the small-
company capital-raising process. Each title seeks to reform or repair a given 
part of the process. The titles that make up the JOBS Act are covered in the 
following chapters:

Title I
Reopening American Capital Markets to 
Emerging Growth Companies 
This section of the JOBS Act sets the stage for all that comes later. It defines 
an emerging growth company as a security issuer with less than $1 billion in 
revenue in the most recently completed fiscal (as opposed to calendar) year. 
It also states that any company with less than a billion in revenue that issued 
common stock prior to December 8, 2011 is not eligible to be treated as an 
emerging growth company. Certain disclosure requirements are lifted. The 
“firewall,” or limitations between security issuance activities (underwriting) 
and research, is lifted for EGCs.

the first sale of common equity securities of such issuer pursuant to an effec-
tive registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 occurred on or

■
■Things to notice  The emerging growth company definition is the key innovation of Title I. 
EGC revenues are measured under standard, generally accepted accounting principles. Foreign 
issuers must convert their revenues to dollars, using the exchange rate (foreign currency to dollars) 
existing on the last day of the EGC issuers’ fiscal year, to determine where they fall along the $1 
billion dollar limit. Once you determine that you meet the requirements to be called an EGC, the 
SEC mandates that a company identify itself as such on the front page of its offering document, 
or prospectus.

“(B) may not be required to comply with any new or revised financial account-
ing standard until such date that a company that is not an issuer (as defined 
under section 2(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7201(a))) 
is required to comply with such new or revised accounting standard, if such 
standard applies to companies that are not issuers.”.
(2) SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.—Section 13(a) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(a)) is amended by adding at the end the 
following: “In any registration statement, periodic report, or other reports to

sented in connection with its first registration statement that became effec-
tive under this Act or the Securities Act of 1933 and, with respect to any such 
statement or reports, an emerging growth company may not be required to 
comply with any new or revised financial accounting standard until such date 
that a company that is not an issuer (as defined under section 2(a) of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7201(a))) is required to comply with 
such new or revised accounting standard, if such standard applies to compa-

■
■Things to notice  Section 102 allows EGCs to reduce the amount of financial data they 
present to potential investors. This reduced data set includes exemption from reporting certain 
executive compensation data items. In addition, Sections 103 and 104 establish that EGCs do not 
need to change auditors or have them attest to the integrity of the EGC’s accounting policies and 
procedures.
SEC. 103. INTERNAL CONTROLS AUDIT.
Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7262(b)) is

SEC. 104. AUDITING STANDARDS.
Section 103(a)(3) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7213(a)(3)) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
“(C) TRANSITION PERIOD FOR EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES.—
Any rules of the Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supple-
ment to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to pro-
vide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of 
the issuer (auditor discussion and analysis) shall not apply to an audit of an 
emerging growth company, as defined in section 3 of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934. Any additional rules adopted by the Board after the date of 
enactment of this subparagraph shall not apply to an audit of any emerging 
growth company, unless the Commission determines that the application of 
such additional requirements is necessary or appropriate in the public inter-
est, after considering the protection of investors and whether the action will 
promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation.”.*
*Exempts EGCs from mandatory audit firm rotation requirements

COMPANIES.
(a) PROVISION OF RESEARCH.—Section 2(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 
1933 (15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(3)) is amended by adding at the end the following: 
“The publication or distribution by a broker or dealer of a research report 
about an emerging growth company that is the subject of a proposed public 
offering of the common equity securities of such emerging growth company 
pursuant to a registration statement that the issuer proposes to file, or has 
filed, or that is effective shall be deemed for purposes of paragraph (10) of 
this subsection and section 5(c) not to constitute an offer for sale or offer to 
sell a security, even if the broker or dealer is participating or will participate in 
the registered offering of the securities of the issuer. As used in this paragraph, 
the term ‘research report’ means a written, electronic, or oral communica-
tion that includes information, opinions, or recommendations with respect to 
securities of an issuer or an analysis of a security or an issuer, whether or not 
it provides information reasonably sufficient upon which to base an invest-
ment decision.”.*
*Mandates that the verbal, hard-copy, or electronic publication and distribution, by a broker/dealer, 
of a research report on an EGC, does not constitute an offer to sell a security

(b) SECURITIES ANALYST COMMUNICATIONS.—Section 15D of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o–6) is amended—
(1) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d); and (2) by inserting after 
subsection (b) the following:
“(c) LIMITATION.—Notwithstanding subsection (a) or any other provision of 
law, neither the Commission nor any national securities association registered 
under section 15A may adopt or maintain any rule or regulation in connection 
with an initial public offering of the common equity of an emerging growth 
company—*
*Disallows the imposition of functional role-based conflict-of-interest rules with respect to the 
issuance of common stock by an EGC. Allows EGCs or persons representing an EGC to communicate 
with accredited investors to “test the waters” or determine level of interest in EGC offering.
“(1) restricting, based on functional role, which associated persons of a broker, 
dealer, or member of a national securities association, may arrange for com-
munications between a securities analyst and a potential investor; or
“(2) restricting a securities analyst from participating in any communications 
with the management of an emerging growth company that is also attended by 
any other associated person of a broker, dealer, or member of a national secu-
rities association whose functional role is other than as a securities analyst.”.
(c) EXPANDING PERMISSIBLE COMMUNICATIONS.—Section 5 of the 
Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77e) is amended—
(1) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (e); and
(2) by inserting after subsection (c) the following:
“(d) LIMITATION.—Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an 
emerging growth company or any person authorized to act on behalf of an 
emerging growth company may engage in oral or written communications 
with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions 
that are accredited investors, as such terms are respectively defined in section 
230.144A and section 230.501(a) of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or 
any successor thereto, to determine whether such investors might have an 
interest in a contemplated securities offering, either prior to or following the 
date of filing of a registration statement with respect to such securities with 
the Commission, subject to the requirement of subsection (b)(2).”.
(d) POST OFFERING COMMUNICATIONS.—Neither the Commission 
nor any national securities association registered under section 15A of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may adopt or maintain any rule or regulation 

The JOBS Act
171
prohibiting any broker, dealer, or member of a national securities association 
from publishing or distributing any research report or making a public appear-
ance, with respect to the securities of an emerging growth company, either—*
*Disallows the imposition of rules that prohibit a broker, dealer, or member of a national securities 
association from speaking, writing, or publishing research reports on the securities of EGCs
(1) within any prescribed period of time following the initial public offering 
date of the emerging growth company; or
(2) within any prescribed period of time prior to the expiration date of 
any agreement between the broker, dealer, or member of a national securi-
ties association and the emerging growth company or its shareholders that 
restricts or prohibits the sale of securities held by the emerging growth com-
pany or its shareholders after the initial public offering date.
■
■Things to notice  Section 105 establishes that research reports on EGCs issued by brokers 
issuing an EGC’s securities do not constitute an offer to sell a security. The section also expands the 
types of permissible discussions brokers can conduct concerning EGC issuer securities.
SEC. 106. OTHER MATTERS.
(a) DRAFT REGISTRATION STATEMENTS.—Section 6 of the Securities Act 
of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77f) is amended by adding at the end the following:
“(e) EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES.—
“(1) IN GENERAL.—Any emerging growth company, prior to its initial public 
offering date, may confidentially submit to the Commission a draft registration 
statement, for confidential nonpublic review by the staff of the Commission 
prior to public filing, provided that the initial confidential submission and all 
amendments thereto shall be publicly filed with the Commission not later 
than 21 days before the date on which the issuer conducts a road show, as 
such term is defined in section 230.433(h)(4) of title 17, Code of Federal 
Regulations, or any successor thereto.*
*Permits an EGC to submit, to the SEC, a confidential, nonpublic draft securities offering registration 
statement. Sets a 21-day pre “road show” time limit.

Chapter 8 | Title I
172
“(2) CONFIDENTIALITY.—Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, 
the Commission shall not be compelled to disclose any information pro-
vided to or obtained by the Commission pursuant to this subsection. For 
purposes of section 552 of title 5, United States Code, this subsection shall 
be considered a statute described in subsection (b)(3)(B) of such section 552. 
Information described in or obtained pursuant to this subsection shall be 
deemed to constitute confidential information for purposes of section 24(b)
(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.”.
(b) TICK SIZE.—Section 11A(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
U.S.C. 78k–1(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
“(6) TICK SIZE.—
“(A) STUDY AND REPORT.—The Commission shall conduct a study examin-
ing the transition to trading and quoting securities in one penny increments, 
also known as decimalization. The study shall examine the impact that deci-
malization has had on the number of initial public offerings since its implemen-
tation relative to the period before its implementation. The study shall also 
examine the impact that this change has had on liquidity for small and middle 
capitalization company securities and whether there is sufficient economic 
incentive to support trading operations in these securities in penny incre-
ments. Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this paragraph, 
the Commission shall submit to Congress a report on the findings of the 
study.
“(B) DESIGNATION.—If the Commission determines that the securities of 
emerging growth companies should be quoted and traded using a minimum 
increment of greater than $0.01, the Commission may, by rule not later than 
180 days after the date of enactment of this paragraph, designate a minimum 
increment for the securities of emerging growth companies that is greater 
than $0.01 but less than $0.10 for use in all quoting and trading of securities 
in any exchange or other execution venue.”
■
■Things to notice  Section 106 also mandates that the SEC conduct a study on “tick size.” 
While not entirely irrelevant to the EGC market, we see this as benefitting hedge fund and others 
engaged in high-frequency trading.
SEC. 107. OPT-IN RIGHT FOR EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES.
(a) IN GENERAL.—With respect to an exemption provided to emerging 
growth companies under this title, or an amendment made by this title, an 
emerging growth company may choose to forgo such exemption and instead 
comply with the requirements that apply to an issuer that is not an emerging 
growth company.

The JOBS Act
173
(b) SPECIAL RULE.—Notwithstanding subsection (a), with respect to the 
extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting stan-
dards provided under section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933 and sec-
tion 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as added by section 102(b), 
if an emerging growth company chooses to comply with such standards to the 
same extent that a non-emerging growth company is required to comply with 
such standards, the emerging growth company—*
*Allows an EGC to refuse exemptions allowed under the act. Says the EGC must notify the SEC of 
its choice. Sets terms of this refusal, stating that an EGC that refuses cannot go back and must 
comply with that choice for the entire period that it is an EGC.
(1) must make such choice at the time the company is first required to file a 
registration statement, periodic report, or other report with the Commission 
under section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and notify the 
Securities and Exchange Commission of such choice;
(2) may not select some standards to comply with in such manner and not 
others, but must comply with all such standards to the same extent that a 
non-emerging growth company is required to comply with such standards; 
and
(3) must continue to comply with such standards to the same extent that a 
non-emerging growth company is required to comply with such standards for 
as long as the company remains an emerging growth company.
■
■Things to notice  Section 107 allows EGCs to voluntarily comply with any requirements that 
apply to a non-EGC issuer. This option is nonrevocable—that is, after it is selected, the EGC must 
abide by all requirements.
SEC. 108. REVIEW OF REGULATION S-K.
(a) REVIEW.—The Securities and Exchange Commission shall conduct a 
review of its Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.10 et seq.) to—*
*Mandates that the SEC review Regulation S-K. Seeks to have the SEC update the regulation 
concerning the nonfinancial portions of the registration statement to lower costs and streamline 
the registration process.

Chapter 8 | Title I
174
(1) comprehensively analyze the current registration requirements of such 
regulation; and
(2) determine how such requirements can be updated to modernize and sim-
plify the registration process and reduce the costs and other burdens associ-
ated with these requirements for issuers who are emerging growth companies.
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this 
title, the Commission shall transmit to Congress a report of the review con-
ducted under subsection (a). The report shall include the specific recommen-
dations of the Commission on how to streamline the registration process in 
order to make it more efficient and less burdensome for the Commission and 
for prospective issuers who are emerging growth companies.
■
■Things to notice  Regulation S-K is, according to Wikipedia, a “regulation under the US 
Securities Act of 1933 that lays out reporting requirements for various SEC filings used by public 
companies.”
Analysis
Given the nature of the changes to the IPO marketplace anticipated by the 
JOBS Act, the changes mandated by Title I—indeed, by the entire act—have 
taken some time to implement.
The JOBS Act is a response to concerns about the ability of smaller com-
panies to obtain equity financing. Technology, via the Internet, created a new 
method that can be used to facilitate the provision of capital to new small 
businesses. The act seeks to formally allow this method.
The JOBS Act responded to a decline in the number of IPOs in the United 
States by opening the door more widely to small companies. It is not a per-
fect solution, but it is a very good start. One reason that the JOBS Act is not 
perfect is its lack of recognition concerning exactly what caused the IPO crisis 
to begin with. I believe a decline in the ethical standards of business behavior 
caused small businesses to seek other forms of financing. The JOBS Act does 
little to address this core issue, and, in fact, grants significant EGC and crowd-
funding regulatory advantages to existing broker dealers and securities firms. 
This may exacerbate the problem without having the desired effect of increas-
ing small company IPOs.
All is, however, not lost. I believe the “crowd” and the market itself will prevent 
this from happening. Investors and small companies will gravitate to authen-
tic, transparent portals, as described in Chapter 7. More detail is provided in 
Chapter 10.

Title II
Access to Capital for Job Creators
To sell securities legally in the United States, the company offering them must 
register the securities with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. All 
information concerning the offering has to be presented to investors via a 
prospectus. A company can bypass this registration requirement via the use of 
a limited number of exemptions.
Section 201 of the JOBS Act relaxes rules governing how funds can be 
raised via one of the most important exemptions, Regulation D. Under two 
Regulation D rules, 505 and 506, exemptions from certain parts of the regis-
tration requirements are allowed for companies that sell their securities to 
accredited investors. Title II of the act also modifies and eliminates restrictions 
on general solicitation or advertising, which is important if an issuer is to offer 
securities over the Internet.
Title II
SEC. 201. MODIFICATION OF EXEMPTION.
(a) MODIFICATION OF RULES.—
(1) Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission shall revise its rules issued in section 
230.506 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, to provide that the prohibi-
tion against general solicitation or general advertising contained in section 
9

Chapter 9 | Title II
176
230.502(c) of such title shall not apply to offers and sales of securities made 
pursuant to section 230.506, provided that all purchasers of the securities are 
accredited investors. Such rules shall require the issuer to take reasonable 
steps to verify that purchasers of the securities are accredited investors, using 
such methods as determined by the Commission. Section 230.506 of title 17, 
Code of Federal Regulations, as revised pursuant to this section, shall continue 
to be treated as a regulation issued under section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 
1933 (15 U.S.C. 77d(2)). *
*Requires the SEC to modify rules concerning public securities offerings so that restrictions 
concerning advertising and solicitation do not apply if all buyers of an offering are accredited 
investors. Issuers must verify accredited investor status of buyers, however.
(2) Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Securities 
and Exchange Commission shall revise subsection (d)(1) of section 230.144A 
of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, to provide that securities sold under 
such revised exemption may be offered to persons other than qualified insti-
tutional buyers, including by means of general solicitation or general advertis-
ing, provided that securities are sold only to persons that the seller and any 
person acting on behalf of the seller reasonably believe is a qualified institu-
tional buyer.
■
■Things to notice  Several provisions of the JOBS Act went into effect right away. Others took 
some time to implement. Some of the final rules implementing certain sections of this title were not 
implemented until March 25, 2015. It took even longer for the marketplace to catch up. I thought 
perhaps the SEC was sending a signal to Congress that it is too underfunded, too stressed, too 
lightly staffed to meet these and other deadlines. Turns out the SEC was simply protecting the 
market for large financial institutions by slowing down adaptation of what could have been a very 
disruptive technology until the economy improved and others caught up.
(b) CONSISTENCY IN INTERPRETATION.—Section 4 of the Securities Act 
of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77d) is amended—
(1) by striking “The provisions of section 5” and inserting
“(a) The provisions of section 5”; and
(2) by adding at the end the following:
“(b) Offers and sales exempt under section 230.506 of title 17, Code of 
Federal Regulations (as revised pursuant to section 201 of the Jumpstart Our 

The JOBS Act
177
Business Startups Act) shall not be deemed public offerings under the Federal 
securities laws as a result of general advertising or general solicitation.”
(c) EXPLANATION OF EXEMPTION.—Section 4 of the Securities Act of 
1933 (15 U.S.C. 77d) is amended—
(1) by striking “The provisions of section 5” and inserting
“(a) The provisions of section 5”; and
(2) by adding at the end the following:
“(b)(1) With respect to securities offered and sold in compliance with Rule 
506 of Regulation D under this Act, no person who meets the conditions set 
forth in paragraph (2) shall be subject to registration as a broker or dealer 
pursuant to section 15(a)(1) of this title, solely because—
“(A) that person maintains a platform or mechanism that permits the offer, 
sale, purchase, or negotiation of or with respect to securities, or permits 
general solicitations, general advertisements, or similar or related activities 
by issuers of such securities, whether online, in person, or through any other 
means;*
*Creates an exemption from broker/dealer registration requirements for persons who would 
otherwise be subject to broker/dealer registration simply because they (1) maintain a web site or 
platform that permits transactions or advertising of security offerings; (2) invest in these security 
offerings, or (3) provide ancillary services.
“(B) that person or any person associated with that person co-invests in such 
securities; or
“(C) that person or any person associated with that person provides ancillary 
services with respect to such securities.
“(2) The exemption provided in paragraph (1) shall apply to any person 
described in such paragraph if—
“(A) such person and each person associated with that person receives no 
compensation in connection with the purchase or sale of such security;
“(B) such person and each person associated with that person does not have 
possession of customer funds or securities in connection with the purchase 
or sale of such security; and
“(C) such person is not subject to a statutory disqualification as defined in 
section 3(a)(39) of this title and does not have any person associated with that 
person subject to such a statutory disqualification.

Chapter 9 | Title II
178
“(3) For the purposes of this subsection, the term ‘ancillary services’ means—
“(A) the provision of due diligence services, in connection with the offer, sale, 
purchase, or negotiation of such security, so long as such services do not 
include, for separate compensation, investment advice or recommendations 
to issuers or investors;
and
“(B) the provision of standardized documents to the issuers and investors, so 
long as such person or entity does not negotiate the terms of the issuance 
for and on behalf of third parties and issuers are not required to use the stan-
dardized documents as a condition of using the service.”
Analysis
Section 201 furthers the exemptions of Title I with an eye toward relaxing or 
reducing prohibitions against advertising to enable the Internet to be used in 
the sales process. It limits sales to accredited investors, however, and places a 
new requirement on the books that requires issuers to verify that accredited 
investors are, in fact, accredited investors.
Section 201 changes rules concerning general advertising and solicitation. It 
eliminates restrictions on the promotion of securities online. It also provides 
that accredited investors must have their status as such verified by issuers. It 
provides a safe harbor for individuals who offer Rule 506 securities online. 
Finally, it opens the door for providers of support services, such as accoun-
tants and lawyers, by stating that these individuals do not have to register as 
brokers or dealers.

Title III
Crowdfunding
The crowdfunding provision of the JOBS Act gets most of the attention. 
Section 301 establishes that transactions under $1 million are exempt from 
certain registration requirements. Note that the act does not specify that only 
EGCs can use these provisions. The crowdfunding exemption is broadly avail-
able to even very large or very old firms.

SEC. 302. CROWDFUNDING EXEMPTION.
(a) SECURITIES ACT OF 1933.—Section 4 of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 
U.S.C. 77d) is amended by adding at the end the following:
“(6) transactions involving the offer or sale of securities by an issuer (including 
all entities controlled by or under common control with the issuer), provided 
that—
“(A) the aggregate amount sold to all investors by the issuer, including any 
amount sold in reliance on the exemption provided under this paragraph dur-
ing the 12-month period preceding the date of such transaction, is not more 
than $1,000,000;*
10

Chapter 10 | Title III
180
*Establishes $1 million offering limit with respect to crowdfunded securities
“(B) the aggregate amount sold to any investor by an issuer, including any amount 
sold in reliance on the exemption provided under this paragraph during the 
12-month period preceding the date of such transaction, does not exceed—*
*Establishes income thresholds for those purchasing crowdfunded securities
“(i) the greater of $2,000 or 5 percent of the annual income or net worth of 
such investor, as applicable, if either the annual income or the net worth of the 
investor is less than $100,000; and
“(ii) 10 percent of the annual income or net worth of such investor, as appli-
cable, not to exceed a maximum aggregate amount sold of $100,000, if either 
the annual income or net worth of the investor is equal to or more than 
$100,000;
“(C) the transaction is conducted through a broker or funding portal that 
complies with the requirements of section 4A(a); and
“(D) the issuer complies with the requirements of section 4A(b).”
■
■Things to notice  The income limits apply to all transactions through crowdfunding portals. In 
other words, status as an accredited investor does not allow you to purchase more securities on a

(b) REQUIREMENTS TO QUALIFY FOR CROWDFUNDING EXEMPTION.—
The Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.) is amended by inserting 
after section 4 the following:
“SEC. 4A. REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN SMALL

investors as the Commission shall, by rule, determine appropriate; *
*Requires that portals safeguard investor information; prohibits them from buying leads; prohibits

Portals can, however, under very specific conditions, take a financial interest in companies on their

the broker or funding portal with the personal identifying information of any

of the securities being offered may be materially limited, diluted, or qualified 
by the rights of any other class of security of the issuer; “(ii) a description of 
how the exercise of the rights held by the principal shareholders of the issuer 
could negatively impact the purchasers of the securities being offered;*
*Establishes information that crowdfunding security issuers have to report to investors concerning

■
■Things to notice  For most firms, the description of ownership and exercise rights are

motional communication;

185
“(4) not less than annually, file with the Commission and provide to investors 
reports of the results of operations and financial statements of the issuer, as 
the Commission shall, by rule, determine appropriate, subject to such excep-
tions and termination dates as the Commission may establish, by rule;
and
“(5) comply with such other requirements as the Commission may, by rule, 
prescribe, for the protection of investors and in the public interest.
“(c) LIABILITY FOR MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS.—
“(1) ACTIONS AUTHORIZED.—
“(A) IN GENERAL.—Subject to paragraph (2), a person who purchases a 
security in a transaction exempted by the provisions of section 4(6) may bring 
an action against an issuer described in paragraph (2), either at law or in equity 
in any court of competent jurisdiction, to recover the consideration paid for 
such security with interest thereon, less the amount of any income received 
thereon, upon the tender of such security, or for damages if such person no 
longer owns the security.

exempted by the provisions of section 4(6), makes an untrue statement of a 
material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated or neces-
sary in order to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under 
which they were made, not misleading, provided that the purchaser did not 
know of such untruth or omission; and
“(B) does not sustain the burden of proof that such issuer did not know, and 
in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of such untruth or 
omission.

Chapter 10 | Title III
186
■
■Note  I believe the vast majority of firms will accurately represent their operations. There 
is the potential for legal abuse, however. Some may seek to take innocent statements made by 
issuers at the start of the fundraising process and make them actionable at some much later point. 
Statements may also be misused by competitors.
“(3) DEFINITION.—As used in this subsection, the term ‘issuer’ includes any 
person who is a director or partner of the issuer, and the principal execu-
tive officer or officers, principal financial officer, and controller or principal 
accounting officer of the issuer (and any person occupying a similar status or 
performing a similar function) that offers or sells a security in a transaction 
exempted by the provisions of section 4(6), and any person who offers or sells 
the security in such offering.
“(d) INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO STATES.—The Commission shall 
make, or shall cause to be made by the relevant broker or funding portal, the 
information described in subsection (b) and such other information as the 
Commission, by rule, determines appropriate, available to the securities com-
mission (or any agency or office performing like functions) of each State and 
territory of the United States and the District of Columbia.
“(e) RESTRICTIONS ON SALES.—Securities issued pursuant to a transac-
tion described in section 4(6)—
“(1) may not be transferred by the purchaser of such securities during the 
1-year period beginning on the date of purchase, unless such securities are 
transferred—*
*Restricts transfers of crowdfunded securities except under four conditions:
Transferred to the issuer
Transferred to an accredited investor
Transferred as part of a registered security offering
Transferred to a family member as part of a divorce proceeding or death of the buyer
“(A) to the issuer of the securities;
“(B) to an accredited investor;
“(C) as part of an offering registered with the Commission;
or

187
“(D) to a member of the family of the purchaser or the equivalent, or in con-
nection with the death or divorce of the purchaser or other similar circum-
stance, in the discretion of the Commission; and
“(2) shall be subject to such other limitations as the Commission shall, by rule, 
establish.
“(f) APPLICABILITY.—Section 4(6) shall not apply to transactions involving 
the offer or sale of securities by any issuer that—
“(1) is not organized under and subject to the laws of a State or territory of 
the United States or the District of Columbia;
“(2) is subject to the requirement to file reports pursuant to section 13 or 
section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;

Company Act of 1940, or is excluded from the definition of investment com-
pany by section 3(b) or section 3(c) of that Act; or
“(4) the Commission, by rule or regulation, determines appropriate.
“(g) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this section or section 4(6) 
shall be construed as preventing an issuer from raising capital through meth-
ods not described under section 4(6).
“(h) CERTAIN CALCULATIONS.—
“(1) DOLLAR AMOUNTS.—Dollar amounts in section 4(6) and subsection 
(b) of this section shall be adjusted by the Commission not less frequently 
than once every 5 years, by notice published in the Federal Register to reflect 
any change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published 
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
“(2) INCOME AND NET WORTH.—The income and net worth of a natural 
person under section 4(6)(B) shall be calculated in accordance with any rules 
of the Commission under this title regarding the calculation of the income and 
net worth, respectively, of an accredited investor.”
(c) RULEMAKING.—Not later than 270 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission (in this title referred to as 
the “Commission”) shall issue such rules as the Commission determines may 
be necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors to carry out sec-
tions 4(6) and section 4A of the Securities Act of 1933, as added by this title. 
In carrying out this section, the Commission shall consult with any securities 
commission (or any agency or office performing like functions) of the States, 
any territory of the United States, and the District of Columbia, which seeks 
to consult with the Commission, and with any applicable national securities 
association.

(d) DISQUALIFICATION.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 270 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Commission shall, by rule, establish disqualification provisions 
under which—*
*Requires the SEC to create rules governing the disqualification of issuers, brokers, and portals
(A) an issuer shall not be eligible to offer securities pursuant to section 4(6) 
of the Securities Act of 1933, as added by this title; and

vises or examines banks, savings associations, or credit unions, a State 
insurance commission (or an agency or officer of a State performing like func-
tions), an appropriate Federal banking agency, or the National Credit Union 
Administration, that—
(I) bars the person from—
(aa) association with an entity regulated by such commission, authority, agency, 
or officer;
(bb) engaging in the business of securities, insurance, or banking; or
(cc) engaging in savings association or credit union activities; or

Fargo, for example) should be excluded from this market. I doubt this will be the case, however.
SEC. 303. EXCLUSION OF CROWDFUNDING INVESTORS FROM 
SHAREHOLDER CAP.

The Commission shall, by rule, exempt, conditionally or unconditionally, securi-
ties acquired pursuant to an offering made under section 4(6) of the Securities 
Act of 1933 from the provisions of this subsection.”.

(a) EXEMPTION.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Section 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
U.S.C. 78c) is amended by adding at the end the following:
“(h) LIMITED EXEMPTION FOR FUNDING PORTALS.—
“(1) IN GENERAL.—The Commission shall, by rule, exempt, conditionally or 
unconditionally, a registered funding portal from the requirement to regis-
ter as a broker or dealer under section 15(a)(1), provided that such funding 
portal—*
*Requires the SEC to create rules that release funding portals from rules that would otherwise 
require them to register as broker/dealers, as long as they remain subject to SEC authority. The 
SEC came up with Form FP—Funding Portal registration.
“(A) remains subject to the examination, enforcement, and other rulemaking 
authority of the Commission;
“(B) is a member of a national securities association registered under section 
15A; and
“(C) is subject to such other requirements under this title as the Commission 
determines appropriate under such rule.

Chapter 10 | Title III
190
“(2) NATIONAL SECURITIES ASSOCIATION MEMBERSHIP.—For purposes 
of sections 15(b)(8) and 15A, the term ‘broker or dealer’ includes a funding 
portal and the term ‘registered broker or dealer’ includes a registered funding 
portal, except to the extent that the Commission, by rule, determines other-
wise, provided that a national securities association shall only examine for and 
enforce against a registered funding portal rules of such national securities

(b) DEFINITION.—Section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15

“(80) FUNDING PORTAL.—The term ‘funding portal’ means any person act-
ing as an intermediary in a transaction involving the offer or sale of securities

of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77d(6)), that does not—*
*Limits the ability of states to enforce security registration and offering laws against a funding 
portal. States and state security regulators do have the authority to enforce laws concerning fraud. 
In addition, for portals specializing in specific geographic areas, allows states to impose filing 
fees. Also allows securities regulators in an issuer’s home jurisdiction to assess fees. On June 
17, 2015, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit recognized William Michael 
Cunningham as a “friend of the court” in an action (15-1149) that two state securities regulators 
(Montana and Massachusetts) brought against the SEC. The states lost.

(1) by redesignating subparagraphs (C) and (D) as subparagraphs (D) and (E), 
respectively; and
(2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following:
“(C) section 4(6);”
(b) CLARIFICATION OF THE PRESERVATION OF STATE ENFORCEMENT

(a) relate solely to State registration, documentation, and offering require-
ments, as described under section 18(a) of Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 
77r(a)), and shall have no impact or limitation on other State authority to

4(6) of that Act.
(2) CLARIFICATION OF STATE JURISDICTION OVER UNLAWFUL

performing like functions) of the State of the principal place of business of 
the issuer, or any State in which purchasers of 50 percent or greater of the 
aggregate amount of the issue are residents, provided that for purposes of

Analysis
Section 302 establishes what a crowdfunding exempt transaction is. It also 
establishes buying limits for crowdfunding investors: $2,000 or 5 percent of 
annual income or net worth for those with less than $100,000; or 10 percent 
of annual income or net worth, subject to a global maximum of $100,000 for 

The JOBS Act
193
those with a net worth greater than $100,000. These limits are described in 
detail in Chapter 5 and presented in Figure 10-1.
Figure 10-1.  Income and investment limits
To be effective, transactions must go through a qualified funding portal. The 
requirements for these are also set out in section 301. The section establishes 
the education, fraud protection, and privacy requirements of crowdfund-
ing web sites. It also establishes the “all or none” aspects of EGC offerings. 
Section 301 sets prohibitions on compensating those who find investors and 
establishes the conflict-of-interest prohibition.
Requirements for EGC issuers are listed. It establishes that any payments for 
those who promote a site’s offerings through communication channels pro-
vided by a broker or funding portal must be clearly disclosed. It also establishes 
the schedule for filing annual funding portal operating reports with the SEC.
Section 301 of the JOBS Act:
• 
Establishes liability for misleading statements made by 
EGC issuers
• 
Outlines the conditions regarding the transfer and sale of 
EGC issues, once bought
• 
Mandates that dollar amount limits set out in the section 
must be adjusted for inflation once every five years

Chapter 10 | Title III
194
• 
Requires that the SEC create rules that determine when 
an EGC is ineligible to issue securities
• 
Establishes that the SEC must exempt EGC crowdfunding 
securities from section 4(6) of the 33 Act (Section 303)
• 
Outlines rules for funding portals, and establishes the 
general registration and operating conditions for these 
entities (Section 304)
• 
Limits the ability of the SEC to interfere with state secu-
rity regulators’ enforcement or examination of funding 
portals, establishes that the exemptions granted from 
state regulation apply only to “registration, documenta-
tion and offering requirements” (Section 305)
• 
Establishes conditions under which state fees can be 
applied to crowdfunded securities

Title IV
Small Company Capital Formation
Some have called Title IV the most important part of the JOBS Act, since it 
expands what are known as Regulation A exemptions. Regulation A allows 
the SEC to remove registration restrictions from any class of security if it 
determines that doing so is in the public interest. Securities issued under a 
Regulation A exemption had been previously limited to $5 million. The JOBS 
Act raises that limit to $50 million. This is a very large increase, a change we 
don’t normally see.
Title IV
SEC. 401. AUTHORITY TO EXEMPT CERTAIN SECURITIES.

“(1) SMALL ISSUES EXEMPTIVE AUTHORITY.—The Commission”; and
(2) by adding at the end the following:

a class of securities to the securities exempted pursuant to this section in 
accordance with the following terms and conditions:*

*Requires the SEC to create a class of securities that are subject to reduced registration 
requirements
“(A) The aggregate offering amount of all securities offered and sold within 
the prior 12-month period in reliance on the exemption added in accordance 
with this paragraph shall not exceed $50,000,000.
*Establishes that the amount of the securities sold in any 12-month period will not exceed $50 
million
“(B) The securities may be offered and sold publicly.
“(C) The securities shall not be restricted securities within the meaning of the 
Federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
“(D) The civil liability provision in section 12(a)(2) shall apply to any person 
offering or selling such securities.
“(E) The issuer may solicit interest in the offering prior to filing any offering 
statement, on such terms and conditions as the Commission may prescribe in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors.
“(F) The Commission shall require the issuer to file audited financial state-
ments with the Commission annually.*

Commission and distribute to prospective investors an offering statement,

the federal Regulation A. The study is online at www.gao.gov/assets/600/592113.pdf.
The Comptroller General shall conduct a study on the impact of State laws 
regulating securities offerings, or “Blue Sky laws”, on offerings made under 
Regulation A (17 CFR 230.251 et seq.).
The Comptroller General shall transmit a report on the findings of the study 
to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives, and 
the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate not later

Analysis
This section of the act creates another way small companies can use the 
capital markets to raise capital. It establishes that the SEC must increase the 
amount of capital that companies can raise to $50 million, by using what are 
known as Regulation A exemptions. Historically, Regulation A offerings have 
been much lower than Regulation D1 offerings.2 This section of the JOBS Act 
seeks to change that.
One of the reasons this is important is that, after years of denial, lawmakers 
recognized not only that capital is an issue, but also that the issue is so serious 
that it requires an “all of the above” approach. The law’s new “on-ramps”—
increases in old and outdated regulatory capital limits, and efforts to make use 
of the Internet and social media—start here.
1Regulation D comprises a series of exemptions that allow companies to sell equity to 
private, accredited investors.

Title V
Private Company Flexibility and Growth 
If a company has fewer than 750 shareholders and less than $1 million in 
assets, long-established rules exempt that firm from having to register its 
securities with the SEC. The JOBS Act revamps these limits to $10 million in 
assets and either of the following:
• 
2,000 shareholders
• 
500 nonaccredited investors
The JOBS Act specifies how the 2,000-person limit is to be calculated. Included 
in the calculation are persons who received the stock as part of an employee 
compensation arrangement.
The relaxation of this limit should facilitate the creation and use of online 
capital-raising tools targeted to accredited investors.

end the following: “For purposes of determining whether an issuer is required 
to register a security with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (1), the 
definition of ‘held of record’ shall not include securities held by persons who 
received the securities pursuant to an employee compensation plan in trans-
actions exempted from the registration requirements of section 5 of the

Commission shall also adopt safe harbor provisions that issuers can follow 
when determining whether holders of their securities received the securities 
pursuant to an employee compensation plan in transactions that were exempt 
from the registration requirements of section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.

Summary
Title V relaxed shareholder limits that say exactly when a company must begin 
registering and reporting security sales offerings to the SEC. There has been 
considerable debate about the impact this section of the JOBS Act has had. 
Some companies, including Google, claimed that the shareholder reporting 
limits forced them to go public before they would have otherwise. Others 
claimed that “fewer than 12 companies” will benefit from this rule change.1
It seems reasonable to assume that the higher the number of shareholders 
you can have before you must report to the SEC and start following all the 
disclosure rules, the longer you will take to do so. Given the elevated number 
of shareholders one observes in a crowdfunding solicitation, I think, unless the 
trigger point was raised to, say, 100,000 shareholders, that the impact of this 
provision on capital-raising activity will be helpful, but minimal.

Title VI
Capital Expansion
Title VI of the JOBS Act focuses on banks, and does for them what Title V did 
for other companies. It says banks don’t need to register with the SEC until 
they have $10 million in assets and a certain number of shareholders. It also 
expands the number of those shareholders for these institutions from 500 
to 2,000 before triggering the registration requirement, with no qualification 
concerning accredited vs. nonaccredited persons.

Analysis
This section of the JOBS Act seeks to reduce disclosure and registration 
requirements affecting banks and thrift institutions. Most small businesses will 
not be affected. To the extent that banks and thrifts use their newfound regu-
latory freedom and the money resulting from it (generated by an increase in 
demand from small businesses and a reduction in costs) to make small busi-
ness loans, then small businesses in areas served by these banks will be bet-
ter off. Some small banks will increase lending, other things equal, but most 
will probably capture the cost savings and pay them out to shareholders or 
management.

The JOBS Act
205
Banks and thrifts that deregister based on fewer than 1,200 shareholders—in 
other words, choose not to supply current periodic financial and operational 
information to the SEC—will be marginally less transparent. This may mean a 
higher degree of investor risk. These institutions will still file periodic financial 
reports with banking regulatory agencies, however.
For many banks, leaving the capital markets is not an option. These banks and 
thrifts depend on institutional investors, and these investors mandate that the 
bank or thrift register its securities with the SEC as a condition of investing.
Combined with other sections of the JOBS Act, banks may have more access 
to capital. Time will tell if they use this potential increase in capital access to 
increase lending activity. More likely, some will and some won’t. The general 
hope is that the combination of new capital access approaches will work sym-
biotically to significantly increase capital access for small firms.

Title VII
Outreach on Changes to the Law
This title of the JOBS Act follows a pattern established by Section 342 of 
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which 
requires the creation of an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion at 29 fed-
eral agencies to “monitor the diversity efforts of the agencies, the regulated 
entities, and agency contractors.”
As we saw in the recent economic collapse, financial institutions were adept 
at promoting themselves as socially responsible in devising products to help 
minority communities—products such as subprime mortgages that turned out 
to hurt more than help those communities. This part of the law is designed 
to make sure that a multiplicity of businesses have access to crowdfunding, or 
are, at the very least, aware that it exists.1

Title VII
SEC. 701. OUTREACH BY THE COMMISSION.
The Securities and Exchange Commission shall provide online information 
and conduct outreach to inform small and medium sized businesses, women 
owned businesses, veteran owned businesses, and minority owned businesses 
of the changes made by this Act.
Analysis
One of the most overlooked but important provisions of Dodd-Frank is 
Section 342, which requires federal banking agencies to examine diversity 
efforts at 27,000 financial institutions that 29 federal agencies regulate. They 
are required to do so via the Office of Minority and Women Inclusion, or 
OMWI, offices. While the success or failure of this effort rests on the level 
of scrutiny the agencies apply to the financial institutions and the techniques 
they use, knowing that they are being watched should spur the financial insti-
tutions to hire more women and minority employees and spend more money 
with women and minority contractors.2 This should be good for women- and 
minority-owned firms seeking to crowdfund. Those that are successful in 
attracting business from government agencies on the lookout for competent 
women- and minority-owned firms that can provide value-adding services and 
goods on a competitive basis should be able to obtain financing on better 
terms via crowdfunding.
This is important because self-employment rates for minorities and women 
still lag behind self-employment rates for men. According to the Hamilton 
Project, fostering business formation among these groups will play an impor-
tant role in contributing to the overall rate of entrepreneurship.3
From 1997 to 2007, the number of minority-owned startups surpassed the 
number of white-owned startups. Additionally, the number of women-owned 
startups increased, and the number of male-owned startups decreased.4

In addition, over the same time period, gross receipts (sales, receipt, value of 
shipment) of minority- and women-owned firms grew faster than the gross 
receipts of nonminority firms.5
This section of the JOBS Act is recognition of the fact that successful entre-
preneurship provides personal benefits such as wealth, savings, job satisfaction, 
and economic mobility.6
Small businesses serve as an important store of wealth. Households in the 
bottom half of the wealth distribution had an average business equity of only 
$20,000, but that number represented 60 percent of those households’ net 
worth.7
Note that entrepreneurship increases economic mobility: families who owned 
a business were more likely to move into a higher-income group than other 
families over a five-year period. Those who did not start a business were 
more likely to stay at the same income group or fall to a lower one.8
From an investing perspective, research indicates that a solid focus on diver-
sity may give rise to above-average investment performance. Why? To suc-
cessfully compete in the United States and globally, companies must reflect 
the changing population within the ranks of their employees and managers. 
Increasingly, the faces of our work force, our suppliers, and our investors are 
faces of color; faces of women; faces of people with disabilities; faces of gay, 
lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered individuals; and faces of older workers. By 
integrating diversity into investing, companies vigorously tailor their offerings 
to fit the needs of shifting cultural priorities.
In fact, an equity portfolio consisting of large capitalization firms with out-
standing diversity performance consistently outperforms broader market 
index-based portfolios, such as S&P 500 Index Funds, as Figure 14-1 shows.

Crowdfunding and Status as a Minority- or 
Women-Owned Company 
As you have seen, crowdfunding can mean that hundreds of people invest in 
your firm or project. A natural question concerns whether or not having hun-
dreds, possibly thousands, of investors will change a firm’s status as women- or 
minority-owned. After all, unless you can verify the race and gender of the 
persons investing, you cannot be sure to meet the required definition.
I do not believe this should be a concern. As long as you offer less than the 
majority of the shares in your firm, and as long as the persons who own at 
least 51 percent of the equity in your firm are minorities or women, then 
your firm will continue to have the status of a minority- or women-owned 
firm. Might this be an issue for subsequent offerings, should you decide to sell 
more stock? Yes, but I believe you should cross that bridge when (and if ) you 
get to it.

Form C
Under JOBS Act Title III, operationalized as Regulation Crowdfunding, to raise 
money using Title III Crowdfunding, you must first file Form C. The Swiss 
Army knife of disclosure documents, the form should be filed 21 days prior 
to soliciting funds. Form C is filed electronically via the SEC’s Electronic Data 
Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system.
Remember that the financial statements you must file on Form C have three 
levels of authentication, depending on the amount of money raised. The first 
two categories are as follows:
• 
$100,000 or less: Financial statements, information from 
the issuer’s federal income tax returns. The principal 
executive officer must certify these forms.
• 
Between $100,000 and $500,000: Accountant-reviewed 
statements. The accountant must be independent of the 
issuer.
For the first two categories, if the issuer has audited or CPA-reviewed finan-
cial statements, the issuer must provide them. If you have these, you “will not 
need to include the information reported on the federal income tax returns 
or the certification of the principal executive officer.”
A

Appendix A | Form C
214
• 
The third category of authentication is for those rais-
ing more than $500,000, and is divided further into two 
subcategories:
• 
For first-time Regulation Crowdfunding issuers: Audited 
or CPA-reviewed financial statements. The 
accountant must be independent of the issuer. If you 
happen to have audited financial statements lying 
around, you can use those.
• 
For veteran crowdfunders: Audited or CPA-reviewed 
financial statements. The accountant must be 
independent of the issuer.
The crowdfunding platform you raise money on is responsible for walking you 
through this process, because they face significant liability if they do not help 
you fill out the form correctly. In addition, recall that the SEC, under the influ-
ence of large firms in the investment and financial services industry, focuses 
on the potential for fraud. What this means is that they designed Form C with 
multiple opportunities for you to inadvertently trip up.
Form C also includes Form C/A, used to notify potential investors about 
changes to your offering statement (Form C). This is how you legally reveal 
any material changes, additions, or updates.
Form C-U is used to provide information on “progress toward meeting the 
target offering amount.” You must report progress “within five business days 
after reaching 50 percent and 100 percent of (your) target offering amount. 
These updates will be filed on Form C-U.”
Form C serves as an issuer’s annual report. This section of the form, Form 
C-AR, must be provided to investors “no later than 120 days after the end of 
(an issuer’s) fiscal year. The report must be filed on EDGAR and posted on 
the issuer’s web site.” If you are making amendments to your annual report, 
you must file Form C-AR-A.
Finally, if you are terminating reporting under Regulation Crowdfunding, file 
Form C-TR.
You’ll want to talk to both the platform and your lawyer about this form. (I 
recommend you get your own lawyer and not rely on a lawyer affiliated with 
the platform, by the way.)

Form 1-A
If Form C is the Swiss Army knife of disclosure documents, Form 1-A is a 
machete. The stakes are higher. You can solicit up to $50 million from anyone, 
not just accredited investors. (Certain investors are limited to investing only a 
certain percentage of their income, however.) While you have more freedom 
to talk about your offering on social media and via advertising, the overall 
audience is going to be more knowledgeable.
In addition, the review process is more stringent for this form than it is for 
Form C. You must file Form 1-A with the SEC prior to soliciting investors, 
and the SEC must approve your submission. You must wait 48 hours after 
receiving SEC approval before you make your first sale. You can, however, 
test the waters by gauging general investor interest prior to soliciting inves-
tors. Audited financial are required for those raising from $20 million to  
$50 million. You can submit CPA-reviewed financials otherwise. Refer to  
Table 1-1 in Chapter 1 for more information on the differences between  
Title III (Regulation Crowdfunding) and Title IV (Regulation A+) of the Act.
Bottom line: you could get into real trouble with Form 1-A if you don’t know 
what you are doing. That’s not to say that you should not consider using 
this capital-raising option. As with other forms of crowdfunding, the platform 
you select will be a very important part of the process. Unlike Regulation 
Crowdfunding, most of the liability does not rest with the platform. It rests 
with the firm making the offering and the platform.
As stated in Appendix A, I suggest you speak with an unaffiliated (with the 
crowdfunding platform) lawyer prior to signing up for any services.

Appendix B | Form 1-A

Form 1-A is more of a compliance document than a tool to interest investors. 
Most of those using 1-A need to have numerous other resources, social media 
assets, web sites, and videos, in order to attract investors.

As I noted in this book, it makes sense to have a cogent, easy-to-share sum-
mary of your crowdfunding approach, no matter what you are trying to do. 
This chapter facilitates that by presenting sample slides. These slides (avail-
able free online at www.creativeinvest/crowdfundingslides/) provide a

In the first slide, I suggest you provide basic information (Figure C-1). Note 
that this is the same information required for Title III crowdfunding.

How will people find out about you and your solution to the problem you 
outlined in the earlier slide? How many people are affected by the problem? 
How will you make them customers? These are the questions you want to 
answer next (Figure C-6).

On the following slide, you provide your best estimate of the amount of 
money your solution to the problem will generate (Figure C-7). Pipeline refers

If the other parts are done well, it should be obvious why you need the money 
you have asked for. Of course, this does not mean that you will get the money 
you asked for, but this is the place to show why your request makes sense 
(Figure C-11).
