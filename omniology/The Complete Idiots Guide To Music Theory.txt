Forewords
This is the book I wished I had in high school.
Then, along with choir and concert band, my primary outlet for music was a
rock band, and each of us would gather nightly in my garage, rehearsing, scheming,
and dreaming, trying to knock out our own music, but without a solid grasp of the
language and technical know-how. This book would have been such a big help
back then. It’s still a big help now! Music is a communicative art, and the first
persons the composer, arranger, or players must communicate with are other
musicians. To a beginner, or to the uninitiated, written music may seem like an
American trying to read Mandarin! If you wish to read and write music, this
book could be more than your first primer—it could be your Rosetta Stone.
In my own teaching, I often use The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Music Theory as a
means to jump-start the learning process for my students. Too often young
musicians and teachers alike approach music theory as a Very Hard Subject 
That Must Be Learned, instead of a set of liberating tools that makes one’s
music-making easier and better. However, this book makes learning theory fun!
Michael’s diagrams, language, and wit will often contain the bit of information
that enables the student to finally grasp the material at hand, oftentimes with an
accompanying smile at the author’s language and antics. Consequently, I’ve
often found that theory teachers at all levels will employ it for its numerous
strategies, often at a time when nothing else has conveyed the concept.
Beginning with the basic terminology and concepts, Michael invites the reader to
work through a course that eventually leads them to a point where they can use
the elements and concepts of music theory to improvise or compose whatever
kind of music they’ve heard in their heads, and then present it to the rest of us,
so we can perform it, too. Each chapter contains several individual nuggets of
information: clear explanations about notation, rhythm, melody, and harmony,
along with further chapters on counterpoint, form, score layout, and even re-
hearsal technique. Each chapter is filled with tips, often with just the right kind of
language or explanation to simply illuminate the trickiest of concepts. Each bit of
technical language that is presented is done so in a logical and straightforward
fashion, often humorously, helping the reader remember the concept more easily.
This edition has added more aural skills/ear training materials—probably the single
most important skill musicians learn and continue to hone their entire lives.
Indeed, the chart that provides examples of all of the melodic intervals, based on a
number of famous melodies, is superb—invaluable to any musician! Additionally,
the accompanying compact disc provides a number of exercises: pitch recogni-
tion (often incorporating your instrument!), interval and chord identification,
rhythmic and melodic dictation, as well as some others. All these skills are valu-
able assets, and Michael ably sets you on the road to acquire them.
Making music seems to be a drive that’s inherent in all of us. We must have all of the
tools and knowledge of their use to musically reach out and express ourselves. The
Complete Idiot’s Guide to Music Theory, Second Edition, is one of the first and best tools
in your musical toolbox. And you know what the song says: “If I had a hammer … ”
—Frank Felice, Ph.D, Associate Professor of Music Theory, Composition
and Electronic Music, Butler University (www.frank-felice.com)

During the summer of 2001, I taught a class at the University of Indianapolis
for our School for Adult Learning. The class was Introduction to Music Theory
for Nonmusicians. The students would be 24 years old or older and have no
experience with music or performance other than their pleasure in listening. As
time for the class to begin neared, I felt uneasy about how I would approach
teaching and selecting a text. When the class began, I tried to cover the basics
of pitch and rhythm. But I soon realized that what I really needed to do was
start where the students were and with music with which they were familiar.
I also realized that everyone has music inside himself or herself. Music is in
time. It is regular. It occurred to me that humans all walk in time. We all speak
in time. Our bodies have a natural rhythm. We only need to find out how to
take advantage of these abilities we all share.
We have all had the experience of playing something back on our internal tape
recorder. Everyone has a memory of some piece of music. I can close my eyes
and internally hear “Take Five,” the song that Michael mentions in Chapter 6. 
I first listened to it as a youngster. I still have it locked in my head. Everyone
can hear “Happy Birthday” internally. Mike will show how this trait will help
you to understand the theory of music.
Music theory is part of the written language of music. It is the written word of
this aural art, music. It is not something only intended for music students. We
don’t have to use it only to analyze a Bach fugue. It is a living part of all music.
I wish Michael’s book had been available for my class.
Music is a language. It has its own vocabulary. I teach several classes in jazz the-
ory each year. One point I like to make to my students is that they need to have
the ability to communicate with the rest of the free world. This means using
the same nomenclature all musicians use. Michael has done an outstanding job
of teaching you to speak music as musicians speak it. He also has used several
styles of music to teach the language. This stuff is not just for academe.
I was excited to read Chapter 12, “Transcribing What You Hear.” Musicians would
agree that listening and practice are of equal importance. Step by step, Michael
leads you through all the basics you need to realize the music inside you. It
doesn’t matter if you like classical, jazz, rock, or any other genre of music. This
book will allow you to understand the principles by which music is organized.
This book is not just another music theory text. This is a book about the nuts and
bolts of the music language. The presentation of material in “learnable” chunks
allows you to understand everything about the language. He is right on with the
“Least You Need to Know” section of each chapter. The exercises at the end of
each chapter serve as meaningful and helpful ways to understanding by doing.
I am convinced this book will lead you to new abilities, understanding, and
enjoyment of music.

of Indianapolis

Introduction
Or, Why You Need to Know a Little Theory
Back when I was in high school and college (a long time ago, and getting longer
every day), many, if not most, of my fellow students regarded music theory as
only slightly more fun than listening to paint dry. I didn’t share that opinion,
and still don’t; I think music theory is interesting and fun and an essential part
of any serious music education.
Still, if all you live for is to play your instrument (or to sing) 24 hours a day, tak-
ing time out from practicing to move a bunch of notes around on paper might
not be tremendously appealing. In fact, I believe introductory-level music the-
ory classes are the second most-skipped classes in college music schools, with
only music history classes being less well received. (Some enterprising soul is
bound to combine the two classes into a “Theory of Music History”—or “History
of Music Theory”—course, thus creating new levels of student apathy.)
I’m not sure why so many budding musicians are so down on theory. Maybe it’s
because of the way it’s presented. (Let’s face it: Some instructors can be fairly
boring when they present this material, and most music textbooks are stultify-
ingly dull.) Maybe it’s because of the way music theory resembles sentence dia-
gramming and other dreary grammar-related stuff. I don’t know; maybe to
some people, it just seems like a lot of work.
But the fact remains: Every musician needs to know some music theory.
That’s a bold statement, and one that you might take issue with. After all,
you’ve gotten this far in your music studies without knowing theory—why do
you need to start studying theory now?
Or perhaps you know of a famous musician who doesn’t know the least little bit
of music theory—and might not even know how to read music. If this person
became rich and famous without knowing the theory behind the music, why
should you have to learn that theory?
Music Theory Is Important
Famous musicians who don’t know how to read a note of music are the excep-
tion rather than the rule. Most musicians, if they want to communicate with
other musicians—to play in a band, or to teach them their songs—have to know
at least the basics about how music works. These basics—notes, chords, and so
on—are what we call music theory.
Notes and chords are the building blocks of the language of music. Music the-
ory defines the many different ways you can arrange those blocks into songs
and compositions. Without the theory, all you have is noise; applying music
theory, you can create great works of art.
Musicians apply music theory every time they sit down to play or sing—
whether they know it or not. When you read a piece of music, you’re using

The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Music Theory, Second Edition
music theory. When you write down a series of notes, you’re using music the-
ory. When you play a chord, you’re using music theory. When you sing a har-
mony line, you’re using music theory.
Even those musicians who don’t have any formal training use music theory.
When they put their hands on the piano, they might not know that they’re
playing a major ninth chord with the fourth in the bass; they do know that those
notes fit together well, even if they can’t tell you the strict chord construction.
Now, if they did have formal training, they could go beyond just playing the
notes to sharing those notes with others. Instead of pointing at their fingers and
saying “play this,” they could actually write their notes and chords down on
paper, in a format universally understood by musicians the world over. After all,
it’s a lot easier to tell someone to play a CM9/F chord than it is to say “put your
first finger here, and your second finger here,” and so on.
The knowledge of how different notes work together also helps you expand on
the simple melodies you’re currently playing. When you know theory, you
know how to accompany a melody with chords and how to voice those chords
so that they sound good to your ears. You also can learn how to turn that simple
melody into a full-blown arrangement for groups of voices and instruments, and
how to create your own melodies and compositions.
Without a knowledge of basic music theory, you won’t be able to fully express
your musical ideas; nor will you be able to share those ideas with others.
Music Theory Is Useful
Of course, it isn’t just professional musicians who need to know theory. Even if
you’re just doing it for your own personal enjoyment, a knowledge of theory
will help you better appreciate the music you play or sing.
Here’s a good example: Let’s say you’re helping out at your daughter’s school
and someone, knowing that you’re a musician, asks you to work up an arrange-
ment of “Mary Had a Little Lamb” for the upcoming school pageant. There
are two girls and one boy in the class who sing pretty well, and another boy
who knows how to play trumpet. You’ll accompany them on guitar.
This doesn’t sound like a tall order, but it’s one that requires a lot of theory to
complete. First of all, you need to know how to read and write music—which
includes the knowledge of clefs and keys and time signatures. Then you need to
know about chords and chord progressions, and how to create harmonies and
counterpoint. You also need to know how to arrange music for different voices
and instruments, and even how to transpose music from one key to another.
(That’s because the trumpet reads music in a different key from everybody else.)
You see the problem. If you don’t know your theory, you won’t be able to com-
plete this rather simple assignment. It’s as simple as that.
When you know the theory behind the music, playing and singing gets a lot more
interesting. With a little grounding in theory, it’s easier to understand why some
melodies are more appealing than others, and why certain chord progressions
work better with certain melodies. You’ll see how harmony works, which will
xvi

Introduction
really help if you’re singing background or accompanying someone on piano or
guitar. You’ll even be able to arrange music for your choir or band, or to create
your own compositions.
And here’s the neat part: Music theory isn’t hard. Once you learn the basic notes
and scales, the rest falls together fairly easily. After all, a chord is just three
notes put together. That’s all—just three notes. And a song is nothing more
than a few chords strung together in a series, along with a melody—which is
just a series of notes all in a row. Figuring out what goes where (and which
notes sound good together) is what theory is all about.
Music Theory Is for Nonmusicians
Music theory isn’t just for musicians, either. There are a lot of listeners out
there who are curious about how music is created. Just what makes a particular
song so special? Why does some music sound uplifting, and other music sound
sad? And just what are your musician friends talking about when they say things
like “cool changes” or “take this up a third”? 
You don’t have to be a music student to be interested in how music works—just
as you don’t have to have a literature degree to be interested in how words and
sentences fit together. Basic music theory is for anyone who is interested in music;
the more you know, the more you can appreciate the music that you listen to.
Music Theory and Me
There are many different ways to learn music theory. Your school might have
music theory classes you can take. Your music teacher also might teach a little
theory, or know a private teacher you can study with. Or you can learn theory
the way I did: by yourself, from a book.
I taught myself music theory back when I was in eighth grade. My junior high
school had the usual general music classes, as well as choir and band, but didn’t
have any theory classes. So, because I wanted to arrange some tunes for a band
I was in, I had to teach myself the theory behind the arranging.
My theory education came from a lot of trial and error, and from two books:
Dick Grove’s Arranging Concepts: A Guide to Writing Arrangements for Stage Band
Ensembles (1972) and David Baker’s Arranging & Composing for the Small Ensemble
(1970). Both of these books are still in print today, and still as valuable as they
were back then. I recommend you check them out.
Now, if you look at the titles of those books, you’ll see that they really don’t
have anything to do with basic music theory. There’s theory in the books, of
course, but you really have to read between the lines (so to speak) to pull it out.
I would have given my right arm back then for a book that focused on beginning-
level theory, written at a level that I could comprehend.
Well, 30 years later, I wrote that book.
It’s interesting. I was a fairly serious musician throughout my junior high and
high school years, and went on to attend the prestigious Indiana University
xvii

The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Music Theory, Second Edition
School of Music, in its even more prestigious jazz studies program. But some-
thing shifted along the way, and I ended up graduating IU with a business degree,
and found myself some years later working in the book publishing industry.
After serving my time in the corporate world, I became a full-time writer, writ-
ing books about all manner of topics, from computers to business management
to home theater systems.
Then, in 2000, I wrote a music book—The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Playing Drums
(available at a bookstore near you). Things had finally come full circle, and I
was writing about the music that I loved, and lived, so many years ago.
That book led to my writing other music books, chief of which is the one you
hold in your hands—The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Music Theory. The first edition
of this book, published in 2002, became an overnight success—one of the best-
selling music theory books of all time. I’m still amazed at how well this book
has been received, and am grateful to the tens of thousands of readers who
helped to make it so successful. I’m glad to have had the opportunity to intro-
duce a new audience to the joys of music—in, I hope, a manner that is easy to
follow, reasonably comprehensive, and somewhat practical. And I’m pleased to
present this updated second edition of the book, made even more useful by the
inclusion of The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Music Theory, Second Edition, Ear
Training Course on the accompanying CD.
As to the book itself, The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Music Theory, Second Edition, is
designed to be a self-teaching tool for anyone wishing to learn music theory. The
book starts with basic notes and rhythms; advances through scales, melodies,
chords, and harmony; and ends with valuable information about accompanying,
arranging, and conducting your music. In short, it presents pretty much every-
thing you’ll need to know about music theory—for musicians of any level.
Of course, I always recommend studying with a good teacher. Even if you’re
reading this book, you can learn even more by supplementing the material in
these pages with the hands-on instruction you can get from a real human being.
To me, that’s really the best of both worlds; self-paced study accompanied by
interaction with a good music theory instructor.
What You’ll Find in This Book
However you decide to learn, I hope you find the information in this book use-
ful. I’ve arranged the material in such a way that even if you know nothing
about music or music theory, you can start on page one and progress through
the book, moving from the basics to more advanced concepts. If you do know
some theory, you can skip those chapters that you already know and go right to
the new material you want to learn. And, once you’ve learned what you need 
to know, you can still use this book as a reference, to look up those scales or
chords that you never can seem to remember.
The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Music Theory, Second Edition, is composed of 20
chapters, each of which presents a different aspect of music theory. The chap-
ters are organized into six general parts, as follows:
xviii

Introduction
Part 1, “Tones,” gets you started with reading music. You’ll learn about the
notes on a piano, the intervals between different notes, and how those notes
combine into different scales. You’ll also learn about clefs and keys—both major
and minor.
Part 2, “Rhythms,” shows you how to arrange your notes sequentially in
space. You’ll learn how to count and how to notate your music, using whole
notes, half notes, quarter notes, and more. You’ll also learn about different time
signatures, and about tempo, dynamics, accents, and other musical effects.
Part 3, “Tunes,” helps you combine tones and rhythms to create your own
melodies. You’ll learn how melodies and chords are constructed; you’ll also
learn about chord progressions and different song forms.
Part 4, “Accompanying,” shows you how to make more out of your basic
melodies. You’ll learn how to write down the songs you hear on the radio, how
to accompany simple melodies on piano or guitar, and how to add harmony and
counterpoint to your songs.
Part 5, “Embellishing,” goes beyond basic theory to present advanced music
notation and show you how to transpose music to other keys. You’ll also learn
how to spice up your music by substituting more sophisticated chords in your
arrangements.
Part 6, “Arranging,” presents real-world advice for taking your music public.
You’ll learn how to create lead sheets and scores, use music notation software 
to create sophisticated arrangements, arrange for groups of instruments and
voices, and get your music performed. You’ll even learn the right way to wave
the baton when you conduct a choir or orchestra!
In addition, you get four appendixes and a bonus audio CD. The appendixes
include a glossary of musical terms, a chord reference, the answers to this
book’s exercises (found at the end of each chapter), and a guide to the shiny lit-
tle compact disc that accompanies this book. 
What’s on the CD
The CD that comes with this book is a fun bit of business all by itself.
Pop it into your CD player and you’ll find that it contains The Complete
Idiot’s Guide to Music Theory, Second Edition, Ear Training Course, a self-
paced audio guide to improving your musical hearing. Work through the exam-
ples and exercises on the CD to learn how to recognize scales, intervals, chords,
and rhythms. It’s a great way to learn how to understand and transcribe the music
you hear. (And you can check your answers against those supplied in Appendix D.) 
While you don’t need to listen to the CD to learn from the book, I’ve tried to
tie the ear training lessons in with the content presented throughout the book.
For example, when you read Chapter 2, “Intervals,” you can listen to Lesson
Two on the CD (track #11), which lets you hear what all those intervals actually
sound like. Look for the Ear Training CD icon, like the one here, at the begin-
ning of a chapter to discover which track of the CD corresponds to the infor-
mation being presented.

What You Need to Use This Book
Any practicing or aspiring musician can learn basic music theory from The
Complete Idiot’s Guide to Music Theory, Second Edition. You don’t need any initial
knowledge to get started; you can use this book even if you don’t know how to
read music or play an instrument.
However, it will help if you have access to some sort of keyboard instrument.
That can be a piano or organ, or some sort of inexpensive synthesizer or 
consumer-grade music keyboard. It doesn’t have to be a great keyboard or a big
one; you’ll use it mainly to perform some of the examples and exercises in the
book. (You can use this book without having a keyboard, but then you’ll have to
envision some of the examples in your head.)
Most of the examples and exercises can be performed on any instrument—
piano, guitar, trumpet, or whatever. If you don’t play an instrument, you can
sing most of the exercises. If you can’t play or sing, I suggest you go the cheap
keyboard route, so that you have some way of hearing the theory presented.
It will also help if you have some blank music paper at your disposal. And, of
course, a CD player—so you can listen to The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Music
Thoery, Second Edition, Ear Training Course on the accompanying audio CD.
How to Get the Most out of This Book
To get the most out of this book, you should know how it is designed. I’ve tried
to put things together in such a way to make learning music theory both reward-
ing and fun.
Each chapter presents a basic concept of music theory, and progresses through
that concept using a combination of text and musical examples. In some chap-
ters you’ll find pages of reference material—scale listings, chord charts, and the
like—that you can turn back to whenever necessary.
At the end of each chapter are exercises based on the theory presented in that
chapter. Work through these exercises to test your newfound knowledge—and
find out what areas you need to work on a little more!
(In case you’re wondering, the answers to these exercises are in the back of the
book, in Appendix C.)
Throughout the entire book you’ll see a number of little boxes (what we in the
publishing profession call margin notes) that present additional advice and infor-
mation. These elements enhance your knowledge or point out important pit-
falls to avoid. Here are the types of boxes you’ll see scattered throughout the
book:

Discover the building blocks of all music: the pitches you play or sing. You’ll
learn about the notes of a scale, the different types of clefs and staves, the inter-
vals between notes, major and minor scales, and all sorts of different keys and
key signatures. (That’s a lot for just four chapters!)

Lesson 1, Track 2
As you can tell from the title, this is a book about music theory. But what
exactly is music theory? And, even more basic than that, what is music?
There are lots of different definitions of the word “music,” some more poetic
than practical. For example, William Shakespeare called music the “food of
love,” George Bernard Shaw called music the “brandy of the damned,” and
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz called music “sounding mathematics.”
Interesting definitions all, but not really what we’re looking for here.
Let’s try another definition:
Music is the art, the craft, and the science of organizing sound and silence
in the framework of time.
Now that’s a little more helpful, but it’s still fairly broad. This definition could
describe a tremendous range of activities—a mother singing a lullaby to her
child, an orchestra playing a Mozart symphony, a rock group performing their
latest hit, a group of Native Americans playing ceremonial drum beats, Louis
Armstrong playing trumpet in a jazz quartet, a group of sailors chanting “yo
heave ho,” or a nightingale warbling a serenade. You probably didn’t buy this
book to learn about all these things, although all of them have been called
“music,” at one time or another.
So we’ll use a slightly different definition of music in this book. This definition
is a lot more specific:
Music is a succession of tones arranged in a specific rhythm.
Chapter

Part 1: Tones
Better? This definition doesn’t cover everything that’s ever been called “music,”
but it probably covers those types of music that you’re familiar with—primarily,
twentieth-century popular music, from ragtime to reggae to rock, and every-
thing in between.
Now to the word “theory.” In scientific circles, this word is used as the formula-
tion of a hypothesis, such as Einstein’s theory of relativity. While academic
music theorists sometimes do formulate hypotheses in this scientific fashion,
that’s not what this book is about.
In our context, we’ll use the word “theory” to mean a study of the rudiments of
music—the basic things that performers and listeners need to know to produce
and enjoy this marvelous art. This goes back to the root meaning of the word,
which means “a way of looking.” If we broaden this definition to include not
just looking, but also listening and performing, then we’re set.
Now that we’ve defined our terms, it’s time to get started—and learn the theory
behind the music. To do this, we have to go back to our definition of music,
which says that music is a succession of tones, arranged in a specific rhythm. To
study music, then, we have to learn about notes, and about arranging them.
We’ll get to the “arranging in a specific rhythm” bit starting with Chapter 5.
That lets us focus our attention, for the time being, on tones.
Understanding Musical Tones
So what’s a tone? The definition is simple: a tone is a sound that is played or
sung at a specific pitch.
When you hum (go ahead …), you’re humming a tone. When you whistle, you’re
whistling a tone. When you go “aaaahhhh,” you’re sounding a tone. If you put
two or more hums, whistles, or “aaaahhhhs” together, you have music.
You can hum lots of different tones, high or low. The higher tones are referred
to as higher pitched; lower tones are called lower pitched.
Here’s an exercise: Hum a tone. Now hum a tone higher than the first tone.
What you’ve just hummed are two separate tones, at two separate pitches. The
second tone was higher pitched than the first tone.
Different voices, and different instruments, produce different ranges of tones.
For example, women tend to have higher voices than men; the tones most
women sing are higher-pitched than the tones most men sing. (There are
exceptions to this rule, of course; listen to some of the doo-wop singers of the
1950s and you’ll hear some fairly high male voices!)
In the world of musical instruments, physically larger instruments tend to pro-
duce lower-pitched tones, whereas smaller instruments tend to produce higher-
pitched tones. This is because bigger instruments move more air than smaller
ones do, and more air means a lower pitch. This is why the small cylinder of a
flute produces higher notes than the big brass tubing of a tuba, and why the
thin strings on a guitar are higher-pitched than the thick strings.
4
Pitch describes the
specific frequency or tun-
ing of a tone. (Frequency
is a measurement of how
fast air molecules are
vibrating.)
Definition
Some instruments produce
tones that aren’t at specific
pitches. These instruments—
such as drums and 
cymbals—are called un-
pitched or nonpitched
instruments. The tones they
produce can be high or
low, but typically don’t
correspond to specific
note pitches.
Note

Chapter 1: Pitches and Clefs
Some instruments produce a broader range of tones than other instruments. In
particular, the piano has a very broad range. From the lowest tone (the key on
the far left of the keyboard) to the highest (the key on the far right), the piano
reproduces more tones than just about any other instrument—and certainly a
lot more than the human voice!
Time for another exercise: Hum the lowest tone you can hum; then gradually
raise the pitch until you’re humming the highest tone you can hum. You just
hummed a whole lot of different tones. How, then, do you describe a specific
tone so that someone else can hum the same tone?
5
You’ll find lots of musical terms in this book, but you need to know that musicians
tend to use a lot of these terms interchangeably. A conductor who says, “That
note was wrong,” might mean that the pitch was wrong, or that the note value
(rhythm) was wrong. That’s because the word “note” can be used in place of
either more specific definition.
Don’t get hung up on the differences between “tones” and “pitches” and “notes.”
While there are specific definitions for each word, it’s acceptable to be a little
loose on the usage. I might even substitute one word for another in this book.
You’ll understand what I mean from the context.
Note
Tones Have Value
When it comes to describing a tone, it helps to know that every tone you can
sing or play has a specific value. You can measure that value scientifically, and
use that value to describe the tone—or, more precisely, its pitch. If that’s too
complicated, you also can assign an arbitrary name to each tone. (Go ahead:
Hum a note called “Bob.”)
What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?
If you plug a microphone into an oscilloscope, and then hum a tone into the
microphone, the oscilloscope will measure the frequency of the tone. This is
actually a measurement of how fast the molecules of air are vibrating; the faster
the vibrations, the higher the pitch.
These vibrations are measured in cycles per second, and there are a lot of them.
(Cycles per second are often called hertz; abbreviated Hz.) If you hum the pitch
we call middle C (the white key in the exact center of a piano keyboard, or the
third fret on the A string of a guitar), the oscilloscope will measure 256Hz—that
is, the air is cycling back and forth 256 times per second.
So one way to identify specific pitches is by their frequency. Unfortunately,
writing out even a simple melody in terms of frequency gets a tad unwieldy.
For example, here’s the first half of “Mary Had a Little Lamb” (“Mary had a lit-
tle lamb, little lamb, little lamb”) notated by frequency:
Actually, the “standard”
pitch today is the A above
middle C, which equals
440Hz; all the other notes
are pitched in relation to
this note. In earlier times
and cultures, this note had
other values—as low as
376Hz in early eighteenth-
century France, and as
high as 560Hz in early
seventeenth-century Ger-
many (referred to as North
German church pitch).

587Hz, 587Hz, 587Hz,
659Hz, 783Hz, 783Hz
The specific frequencies of “Mary Had a Little Lamb.”
Not easy to read, is it?
Which is why we don’t use the frequency method to write music.
6
One good way to determine a specific pitch is with a tuning fork, which is a fork-
shaped piece of metal that resonates at a specific frequency when struck. Most
tuning forks resonate at 440Hz, which is the pitch A. Some people have what is
called perfect pitch, in that they can hear absolute pitches in their heads. How-
ever, most people need the guidance of a tuning fork, pitch pipe, piano, or other
musical instrument to fix a specific pitch.
Note
Play by Numbers
An easier way to designate tones is to number each individual pitch. But before
we start numbering, it helps to know a little bit about how different pitches
relate to each other.
When you hum a pitch, you can “slide” that pitch from lower to higher and
back again, which might make you think that there are an infinite number of
pitches available. (You can certainly see this when you look at frequencies; you
have one tone at 256Hz, another at 257Hz, another at 258Hz, and so on.)
Although that might be true in theory, in practice some pitches are too close
together to clearly distinguish them. For example, if you hum a 256Hz tone and
a 257Hz tone, they sound almost identical in pitch because there isn’t a big
enough interval between the tones.
We need to place a reasonable interval between tones, enough for our ears to
notice, and then assign values to those main pitches that result. What you end
up with is a series of pitches called a scale. (You’ll learn more about scales in
Chapter 2.) Each scale starts on a specific tone, and ends on a higher-pitched
version of that same tone.
In the Western world, we divide our scales into seven main notes—eight if you
count the first note, which is repeated at the end of the scale. Because there are
seven notes, it’s easy to number them—one through seven. Using this number-
ing system, here’s what the first half of “Mary Had a Little Lamb” looks like:
3 2 1 2 3 3 3

3 5 5
“Mary Had a Little Lamb” by the numbers.

Chapter 1: Pitches and Clefs
If you’re reading ahead and want to see how the numbering system applies to tra-
ditional music notation, here’s what the C Major scale looks like, by the numbers:
7
Numbering the notes in the C Major scale.
Now, not to be confusing here, but there are actually notes between some of these
main notes—enough of them that we really have twelve pitches before they start
repeating. These in-between pitches are equally spaced in what we call half steps,
where the major pitches (A, B, C, etc.) have either one or two half steps between
them, depending on the note. (I know, it’s getting confusing already …)
For the time being, we’re going to focus on the seven main notes of a scale,
since that’s easiest to understand. We’ll leave the half steps for Chapter 2. Feel
free to read ahead if you’re interested.
Do Re Mi
Another way to remember each tone is by assigning a simple syllable to each
tone. Remember the song from The Sound of Music that goes “Do, a deer, a
female deer”? That’s what we’re talking about here.
In this particular method, called Solfeggio or Solfège (pronounced sol-FEZH) ,
each of the seven notes of a scale has its own name. The following table shows
the words to use.

These syllables come from
the initial syllables of the
first six words to the Hymn
to St. John; the seventh syl-
lable (Ti) is derived from
the name St. John, in Latin.

If you’re reading ahead and want to know how the Solfeggio names apply to
traditional music notation, here’s what the C Major scale looks like:

The Do Re Mis of the C Major scale.
Tones Have Names
It’s important to know that both the numbering and the Solfeggio methods are
relative ways of naming musical tones. That is, the first note in a scale is always
number one, and is always called Do. The second tone is always number two,
and is always called Re. It doesn’t matter what actual tone you start with, these
names always apply.
The problem with using relative naming is that it doesn’t tell you what precise
pitch to start with. You might start your Do Re Mi on a low pitch, and your
neighbor might start hers on a higher pitch, and your duet will end up sound-
ing like two water buffaloes in heat.
And that’s not good. (Unless you’re a water buffalo, of course.)
No, what we need is a way to designate specific pitches—without resorting to
the cumbersome frequency method.
Learning the ABCs
The accepted way of naming specific musical pitches uses the first seven letters
of the alphabet—A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. While the numbering method is rela-
tive (the number 1 can be assigned to any pitch), the letter method is absolute.
This means that A always refers to a specific frequency. When you tell someone
to sing or play an A, they’ll always sing or play the same pitch.
The only problem with this method is that you can sing or play more than one A.
Try this exercise: Sing A B C D E F G A (think “Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do”).
The first A and the second A should be the same tone, with the second A an
octave higher than the first A. (You’ll learn about octaves a little later in this
chapter—suffice to say it’s a way of presenting a lower or higher version of the
same note.)
You can play an A with a low pitch, and an A with a higher pitch—and other As
both below and above those. Now, all the As will have the same tone; they’re
just higher or lower versions of the basic pitch.
How, then, do you tell which A to play or sing?

Notes on a Piano Keyboard
A good way to visualize the seven basic notes (A through G) is to look at a
piano keyboard. Each white key on the keyboard corresponds to one of these
seven main notes, as shown in the following figure. (And ignore the black keys,
for the time being.)
9
The white keys on a piano keyboard.
As you can see, the black and white keys on a piano form a certain pattern. If
you start in the right place, you’ll see that the black keys are arranged in groups
of threes and twos. The first white key to the left of a group of three black notes
is always assigned to the tone of F. The first white key to the left of a group of
two black notes is always assigned to C. Once you know where F and C are, you
can figure out the location of the other tones.
To figure out which A (or F or C) to play, know that the C located in the very
middle of the piano keyboard—directly underneath the manufacturer’s logo 
or pull-down door handle—is called middle C. (It’s the C in the middle of the
keyboard—easy to remember.) All other notes can be described relative to mid-
dle C—as in “the F above middle C” or “the D below middle C.”
Notes on a Staff
Now that you know the seven basic notes and where they lie on a piano key-
board, how do you go about communicating those notes to others? You could
just spell out a song; if you used this method, the first half of “Mary Had a
Little Lamb” would look like this:
E D C D E E E
D D D
E G G
The notes of “Mary Had a Little Lamb.”
Now, that’s more specific than using numbers or Solfeggio, but it’s still some-
what difficult to read. A better way to notate pitches is to do so visually, using a
graphic that in some ways resembles a basic piano keyboard. This graphic is
called a staff.
Some musicians
identify the specific
pitch by placing a
number after the note
name. Using this method
(which is sometimes called
scientific pitch notation),
the lowest C on a grand
piano is notated C1. The
next C up from that is C2;
then C3, C4, and so on—
and the same for all the
other notes. (In this nota-
tion, middle C is C4.)
Tip

Part 1: Tones
The basic music staff is composed of lines and spaces, like this:
10
A blank staff.
As you can see, the staff has precisely five lines and four spaces. Each line or
space represents a specific pitch. The pitches are determined by the clef at the
beginning of the staff; the staff we’re looking at here uses what is called the tre-
ble clef. (There are several different types of clefs, which we’ll discuss later in
this chapter.)
The notes of a staff (treble clef).
This treble clef staff pictures the notes in the exact middle of a piano keyboard—
just above middle C. (The bottom line of the staff represents the E above mid-
dle C.) The following figure shows how the notes of the staff relate to specific
piano keys.

Back to “Mary Had a Little Lamb”; here’s what the first part of that song looks

Chapter 1: Pitches and Clefs
Above—and Below—the Staff
The basic staff describes nine basic notes—five on the lines, four in the spaces.
But what about all those notes either above or below these nine notes—like that
last note in “Mary Had a Little Lamb”?
Notes higher than the F at the top of the staff are written in the lines and
spaces above the staff. For example, the first space above the staff is the first
note after F: G. The first line above the staff is the first note after G: A. You
can keep adding spaces and lines above the staff to describe higher and higher
notes, as shown in the following figure.
11
Notes above the staff.
Just as you can add lines and spaces above the staff, you can also add lines and
spaces below the staff to describe lower notes. For example, the first space
below the staff is the first note before E: D. The first line below the staff is
the first note before D: C. The following figure shows the first few notes below
the standard staff. By the way, the first line below the staff is middle C.
The lines you add
above or below a staff
are called ledger lines.
Definition
Notes below the staff.
Different Clefs
Up till now, we’ve been looking at a staff that represents the notes just above
middle C on the piano keyboard. The notes of this staff are determined by the
type of clef that appears at the beginning of the staff—and there are several dif-
ferent types of clefs.
The Treble Clef
The clef we’ve been working with so far is called the treble clef; it looks like this:
The treble clef.

Part 1: Tones
As you’ve already learned, in real-world terms the treble clef is positioned just
above middle C. The bottom line of the treble clef staff is an E; the top line is
an F.
The treble clef, like all clefs, fixes the position of a single pitch—from which
you can figure out where all the rest of the notes go. In the case of the treble
clef, the pitch it fixes is G, which is the second line on the staff. (If you look
closely at the treble clef itself, you see that the big round part of the clef circles
around the second line of the staff.) For this reason, the treble clef is sometimes
called the G clef—and the clef itself looks a little like a capital G.
If you ever have trouble remembering which note goes with which line or space
on a staff, here’s an easy way to remember them. The lines of the treble clef staff
are assigned, bottom to top, to the notes E, G, B, D, and F. You can remember
the lines by recalling the first letters in the phrase “Every Good Boy Does Fine.”
The spaces of the treble clef staff are assigned, bottom to top, to the notes F, A,
C, and E. You can remember the spaces by remembering the word “FACE.”
Most higher-pitched instruments and voices use the treble clef. This includes
trumpets, flutes, clarinets, and guitars, as well as singers singing the soprano,
alto, and tenor parts.
The Bass Clef
When you need to write music below the treble clef, you can use a different
clef, called the bass clef. The bass clef is positioned just below middle C, and is
sometimes called the F clef. (That’s because the two dots on the clef surround
the fourth line, which is F.)
Here’s what the bass clef looks like, with the notes of a bass clef staff:
12
A clef is a graphi-
cal symbol, placed at the
beginning of a staff or
piece of music, that estab-
lishes the pitch of a spe-
cific line or space on the
staff; thus it determines the
pitch of all the other notes
on the staff.
Definition
The word bass,
as in “bass clef,” is pro-
nounced base—like the
bottom of things, not like
the fish.
Definition
The bass clef.
Most lower-pitched instruments and voices use the bass clef. This includes
trombones, tubas, bass guitars, and singers singing the bass part.
An easy way to remember the lines of the bass clef is with the phrase “Good
Boys Do Fine Always.” (The first letter of each word describes each line of the
staff, from bottom to top.) To remember the spaces of the bass clef, remember
the first letters in the phrase “All Cows Eat Grass.”
The Grand Staff
If you play or write for piano, there’s another staff you need to know. This staff,
called the grand staff, links together a treble clef staff and a bass clef staff.
(That’s because you play the piano with two hands; each staff roughly corre-
sponds to each hand.)

Chapter 1: Pitches and Clefs
The grand staff looks like this:
13
The grand staff.
When you use a grand staff, it’s important to note that the two staffs neatly
flow into each other. The A at the top of the bass clef extends above that staff
to a B and a C. The C is then linked to the treble clef, goes on up to a D, and
then the E on the bottom line of the treble clef.
The neat thing is that the C—which just happens to be middle C—is halfway
between each staff. So when you write a middle C on a grand staff, it might
extend down from the treble clef staff or extend up from the bass clef staff,
depending on where the surrounding notes are placed.
Specialty Clefs
There are a handful of specialty clefs you must learn, although you probably
won’t use them much. These clefs are designed for instruments whose range
doesn’t fit comfortably within the traditional treble or bass clefs.
One of the most common specialty clefs is the alto clef, shown here:
The alto clef.
The alto clef is used primarily by the viola, which is a slightly bigger version of
a violin. The pointer on this clef points at middle C, which is the third line, in
the exact middle of the staff.
The tenor clef looks a lot like the alto clef, except the pointer points at a differ-
ent line. (It still points to middle C, but middle C is positioned at a different
point on the staff.) The tenor clef looks like this, and is sometimes used by bas-
soons, bass violins, and tenor trombones.
The tenor clef.

Part 1: Tones
Although there are several other specialty clefs (including the baritone, subbass,
and French violin clefs), you probably won’t run into them too often; they’re
not widely used. However, you might run into what is called an octave clef,
which looks like a normal treble or bass clef with the number 8 either above or
below the clef. When you see this type of clef, you’re supposed to transpose the
normal treble clef notes either up (if the 8 is above the clef) or down (if the 8 is
below the clef ) an octave.
14
Octave clefs.
The Percussion Clef
There’s one more clef you should know, and it’s really the easiest of them all. This
clef is used when you’re writing for drums and other percussion instruments—
those that don’t play a fixed pitch. It’s called either the percussion clef or the
indefinite pitch clef, and it can be written one of two ways:
The percussion clef—version one and version two.
The neat thing about this clef is that the lines and spaces don’t correspond to
any specific pitches. Instead, you assign different instruments to different parts
of the staff.
For example, if you’re writing for drum set, you might assign the bass drum to
the bottom space, the snare drum to the third space, and two tom-toms to the
second and fourth spaces; you can put the ride cymbal on the top line of the staff.
The Least You Need to Know
◆Music is a succession of tones arranged in a specific pattern; a tone is a
sound that is played or sung at a specific pitch.
◆There are many different ways to describe a specific pitch. You can
describe a pitch by its vibration frequency, by where it lies numerically
compared to other pitches, or by using the Do Re Mi (Solfeggio) method.
◆Established music notation assigns letters to the seven basic pitches, A
through G. The letters repeat as you generate higher pitches.
◆Pitches are assigned to specific keys on a piano keyboard, and to specific
lines and spaces on a musical staff.
◆The clef placed at the start of a staff determines which notes appear where
on the staff. The most used clef is the treble clef; the bass clef is used for
lower-pitched instruments and voices.
There really aren’t
any rules for how
to assign instru-
ments to a percus-
sion clef, so you’re pretty
much on your own. It’s
probably a good idea to
consult a few drummers or
look at a few percussion
parts to get a better idea
of how to use the percus-
sion clef.

Lesson 2, Track 11
In the previous chapter you learned all about musical pitches: how they’re
named and how they’re presented on a staff. In this chapter we’ll go beyond
that by looking at how pitches can be raised and lowered, and how you can
describe the differences between pitches in terms of intervals.
To make things as simple as possible, we’ll discuss these pitches and intervals in
terms of the C Major scale—that is, the notes between one C on the piano key-
board and the next C above that. The basic concepts can be applied to any
scale, as you’ll see; it’s just that sticking to a single scale makes it all a little eas-
ier to grasp. (And, at least on the piano, the C Major scale is the easiest scale to
work with—it’s all white keys!)
Be Sharp—or Be Flat
As you learned in Chapter 1, the lines and spaces on a music staff correspond
exactly to the white keys on a piano. But what about those black keys? Where
are they on the staff?
When we say there are 7 main pitches in a Western musical scale (A through
G), that’s a bit of an oversimplification: There actually are 12 possible notes in
an octave, with some of them falling between the 7 main pitches.
Just count the keys between middle C and next C on the piano—including the
black keys, but without counting the second C. If you counted correctly, you
counted 12 keys, which represent 12 pitches; each pitch/key is the same interval
away from the previous pitch/key.
Chapter

Part 1: Tones
These black keys are called sharps and flats. Sharps and flats are halfway between
the pitches represented by the white keys on a piano; a sharp is above a specific
key and a flat is below a specific key.
Put another way, a sharp raises the natural note; a flat lowers the note.
Take the black key above the middle C key, for example. You can refer to this key
as C-sharp, because it raises the pitch of C. It also can be called D-flat, because
it lowers the next white key up, D. It may be a little confusing, but it’s true—
C-sharp is the same note as D-flat. And whenever you have two notes that
describe the same pitch—like C-sharp and D-flat—the notes are enharmonic.
Here are the dual names you can use for a piano’s black keys:
18
An interval is the
space between two pitches.
The smallest interval in
Western music is a half
step; intervals are typically
measured in the number of
half steps between the two
notes.
Definition
Two notes that
sound the same but can
be spelled differently are
called enharmonic notes.
Definition
The black keys on a piano keyboard.
On a music staff, sharps and flats are designated by special characters placed
before the affected note. These characters, called accidentals, look like this:
Any modification
to a natural note is called
an accidental. Sharps and
flats are accidentals; the
natural sign (used to return
a sharped or flatted note
to its natural state) is also
an accidental.
Definition
A sharp, a flat, and a natural sign.
That third character is called a natural. When you see a natural sign on a piece
of music, it means to return the specific note to its natural state, without any
sharps or flats.
It’s important to know that you can add sharps and flats to any note—even those
keys on a piano that don’t have black notes between them. So, for example, if
you add a flat to the C note, you lower it to the next note on the keyboard—
which happens to be B natural. (This means B natural is the same pitch as C-flat.)
Steppin’ Out …
The smallest interval in Western music is the half step. On the piano keyboard,
half steps appear between the white keys B and C and between E and F. In all
other cases they appear between a white key and a black key—for example, D
to D-sharp, or F-sharp to G.

Chapter 2: Intervals
Two half steps equal one whole step. The interval between F and G is a whole
step; the interval between B and C-sharp is also a whole step.
Now that you know about steps, it’s a little easier to understand how sharps
and flats work. When you sharpen a note, you move the pitch up a half step.
When you flatten a note, you move the pitch down a half step.
Take the note C, for example: When you add a flat to C, you take it down a half
step. Because the first key (white or black) to the left of C is the white key B,
this means C-flat equals B. When you add a sharp to C, you take it up a half
step. The first key to the right of C is the black key we call C-sharp. (This black
key is also the first key to the left of D, which means C-sharp is the same as 
D-flat.)
19
In some musical
circles, a half step is called
a semitone, and a whole
step is called a tone.
Definition
On a guitar, a half step is
the distance of a single
fret. A whole step is the
distance of two frets.
Note
While the half step is the smallest interval in Western music, music from
other parts of the world often contains intervals smaller than a half step.
Some Indian music, for example, divides an octave into 22 steps, each
about half as large as a Western half step.
Tip
You can use the step method to describe the intervals between two notes—
although once you get more than a few steps away, the counting becomes a tad
difficult. When you’re trying to figure out which note is seven half steps above
middle C (it’s G, in case you’re counting), it’s time to use another method to
describe your intervals. 
A Matter of Degrees
A more accepted way of describing intervals is to go back to the seven main
notes of a scale—and revisit the relative numbering method. You can use the
numbers of the scale to denote the basic intervals between notes, and thus apply
this numbering to any scale.
First Things First
As you learned in the previous chapter, you can use numbers to describe the
seven main notes in any scale. The first note is numbered one, the second note
is numbered two, and so on. This method of numbering actually describes the
seven degrees of a musical scale.
There also are fancy musical names you can use in place of the numbers, which
you might run into in some more formal situations. The following table pre-
sents these formal degree names.

Part 1: Tones
Degrees of the Scale

Name
First (Root)
Tonic
Second
Supertonic
Third
Mediant
Fourth
Subdominant
Fifth
Dominant
Sixth
Submediant
Seventh
Leading Note
Eighth (Octave)
Tonic
There are a few more terms you need to know before we proceed. When two
notes of the exact same pitch are played by two different instruments or voices,
they’re played in unison. Two identical notes with the same name, played eight
degrees apart, form an octave. (The word octave comes from the Latin word
octo, for “eight”—because an octave is eight notes above the beginning note.)
For example, if you go from middle C to the next C up the keyboard, that’s an
octave; F to F is another octave … and so on.
These musical degrees come in handy when you’re describing intervals between
notes. Instead of counting half steps and whole steps, you can simply describe
an interval by using these relative numbers.
For example, let’s say you want to describe the interval between C and D. If you
count C as number one (the first degree), D is number two and the interval
between them is called a second. The interval between C and E (the first and
third degrees) is a third; the interval between C and F (the first and fourth
degrees) is a fourth … and so on.
Pretty easy, once you get used to it!
The following figure shows the basic intervals, starting with a unison and end-
ing with an octave, with C as the root.
20
All this dominant and sub-
dominant stuff will become
more important when you
learn about chord progres-
sions in Chapter 10.
Note
The lowest note of
an interval, chord, or
scale, is called the root.
Definition
The basic intervals, starting on C.
Interestingly, when you examine the frequencies of two notes, as discussed in the
previous chapter, you find that the second note in an octave is an exact multiple
of the first note. For example, the A above middle C has a frequency of 440Hz;
the A an octave above that has a frequency twice that, 880Hz. For this reason
two notes with the same name have the same sound, even if they’re pitched an
octave or more higher or lower.
Note

Chapter 2: Intervals
21
Major and Minor Intervals
When you describe intervals by degree, you still have to deal with those pitches
that fall above or below the basic notes—the sharps and flats, or the black keys
on a keyboard.
When measuring by degrees, you see that the second, third, sixth, and seventh
notes can be easily flattened. When you flatten one of these notes, you create
what is called a minor interval. The natural state of these intervals (in a major
scale) is called a major interval.
Here’s what these four intervals look like, with C as the root, in both major and
minor forms.
Major and minor intervals, starting on C.
Perfect Intervals
Certain intervals don’t have separate major or minor states (although they can
still be flattened or sharpened). These intervals—fourths, fifths, and octaves—
exist in one form only, called a perfect interval. You can’t lower these intervals to
make them minor or raise them to make them major; there’s no such thing as a
minor fifth or a major octave. The intervals, because of their acoustical proper-
ties, are perfect as-is.
Remember, in this chapter
we’re dealing with inter-
vals within a major scale.
Minor scales (described in
Chapter 3) have different
“natural” intervals between
degrees of the scale.
Note
Why is a perfect interval so perfect? It all has to do with frequencies, and with
ratios between frequencies. In a nutshell, perfect intervals sound so closely related
because their frequencies are closely related. 
For example, a perfect octave has a ratio of 2:1 between the two frequencies—
the octave is twice the frequency of the starting pitch (which is called the funda-
mental). If the fundamental is 440Hz, the octave above is twice that frequency,
or 880Hz. Similarly, a perfect fifth has a ratio of 3:2, and a perfect fourth has a
ratio of 4:3. Other intervals have more complex ratios, which makes them less
perfect. For example, a perfect third has a ratio of 5:4, not quite as simple—or
as perfect. 
Put into a series, each increasingly complex interval ratio forms what is called a
harmonic series, and the intervals (in order) are called harmonics. But don’t get
hung up on all the math; what’s important is that you know what the perfect inter-
vals are, not the math behind them.
Note

Part 1: Tones
Here are the three perfect intervals, with C as the root.
22
Three perfect intervals, starting on C.
Augmented and Diminished Intervals
Okay, now you know that perfect intervals can’t be major or minor. That doesn’t
mean that they can’t be altered, however. You can raise and lower fourths and
fifths—however, the result is not called major or minor. When you raise a per-
fect interval a half step, it’s called an augmented interval. When you lower a per-
fect interval a half step, it’s called a diminished interval. So don’t call the new
intervals major or minor—call them augmented or diminished.
For example, if you use C as the root, F is a perfect fourth away from the root.
If you sharpen the F, the resulting note (F-sharp) is an augmented fourth above
the root.
Along the same lines, G is a perfect fifth above C. When you flatten the G, the
resulting note (G-flat) is a diminished fifth above the root.
Here are the key augmented and diminished intervals, with C as the root.
An augmented fourth and
a diminished fifth are
enharmonically the same
note.
Note
Augmented and diminished intervals, starting on C.
Now, just to confuse things, other types of intervals can also be called dimin-
ished and augmented—and these intervals have nothing to do with the perfect
intervals.
To start, you can also create a diminished interval by lowering a minor interval
by another half step. For example, F to D-flat is a minor sixth; if you flatten the
D-flat (yes, there’s such a thing as a double flat), the resulting interval is called a
diminished sixth.
You can also create an augmented interval by raising a major interval by another
half step. For example, F to A is a major third; if you sharpen the A (to A-
sharp), the resulting interval is an augmented third.
Fortunately, you don’t have to deal with either type of diminished or augmented
interval that often. But you still need to know what they are, just in case!

Chapter 2: Intervals
Beyond the Octave
You don’t have to stop counting intervals when you get to the octave. Above the
octave are even more intervals—ninths, tenths, elevenths, and so on.
Intervals that span more than an octave are called compound intervals because
they combine an octave with a smaller interval to create the larger interval. For
example, a ninth is nothing more than an octave and a second; an eleventh is an
octave and a fourth … and so on.
The following table describes the first six intervals above the octave.
Compound Intervals

Compound intervals can have all the qualities of smaller intervals, which means
a compound interval can be (depending on the interval) major, minor, perfect,
augmented, or diminished.

It might be easier for you to think of all these intervals in terms of half steps. To
that end, the following table shows how many half steps are between these
major and minor intervals.

What you’ve learned so far is traditional Western music notation—but it’s not the
only way to notate musical pitches. Some educators today use what is called the
Mod-12 system to teach notes and intervals. In this system, the intervals between
the 12 half steps in an octave are numbered, from 0 to 11. (If you count the
zero, that adds up to 12 intervals.)
For example, the interval we call unison has zero half steps between notes, and
is called “interval 0.” The interval we call a minor third has three half steps, and
is called “interval 3.”
The nice thing about using this system is that you don’t have to worry about
enharmonics. A diminished fifth and an augmented fourth both have six half
steps, and are both called “interval 6.”
You can also use the Mod-12 system to describe individual notes—based on their
interval from tonic. Tonic, of course, is note 0. The minor second degree is note 1,
and the major second degree is note 2. If you wanted to describe the tonic, the
major third degree, and the perfect fifth degree, you’d use the numbers 0, 4, and 7.
While many people like to use the Mod-12 system to teach intervals, I prefer the
old-fashioned method presented here in this chapter—for the sole reason that this
is what you’ll run into in the real world. When you’re playing in a concert band
or a jazz trio, you won’t hear other musicians say “play 4, 7, 11.” You will hear
them say “play the major third, fifth, and major seventh.”
Still, if Mod-12 works for you, use it. It’s a perfectly acceptable way to learn the
12 tones we use in Western music—and it makes it a lot easier to deal with
enharmonic notes.
Note

Chapter 2: Intervals
And take special note of those intervals that are enharmonically identical—such
as the augmented fourth and the diminished fifth. What you call that particular
interval depends on which direction you’re heading, and which notation is the
easiest to read in a given piece of music.
The Least You Need to Know
◆The smallest interval between any two notes is called a half step. Two half
steps equal one whole step.
◆A sharp raises the value of a note by a half step. A flat lowers the value of a
note by a half step.
◆The intervals between any two notes are described in terms of degree. For
example, the interval between the first and third notes is called a third.
◆In a major scale, seconds, thirds, sixths, and sevenths are called major
intervals. You can create a minor interval by flattening these notes.
◆In a major scale, fourths, fifths, and octaves are called perfect intervals.
When you flatten a perfect interval, you create a diminished interval;
when you sharpen a perfect interval, you create an augmented interval.

◆Putting eight notes together to form a scale
◆Creating major and minor scales
◆Discovering the different modes within a major scale
Lesson 3, Track 24
In the first two chapters we discussed the seven key notes (A through G), and
how they relate to each other. We also tossed around the word “scale” to
describe all seven of those notes together.
In this chapter we further examine the concept of the musical scale, which (no
surprise) is seven notes all in a row, in alphabetical order. (If you count the first
note, repeated an octave higher at the top of the scale, it’s eight notes.)
What might be surprising is that there are so many different types of scales.
You can have a major scale, a minor scale (three different types of minor scales,
actually), or any number of different modes within a scale. It sounds confusing,
but it’s really fairly simple once you understand how scales are constructed,
using different intervals between the various notes.
(What’s a mode, you ask? You’ll have to read this entire chapter to find out!)
Scales are important because you use them to create melodies, which you’ll
learn about in Chapter 8. In fact, you can create a nice-sounding melody just by
picking notes from a single major scale. For example, use the C Major scale 
(the white notes on a piano) and pick and choose notes that sound good when
played together. Make sure you start and end your melody on the C note itself,
and you’ve just written a simple song.
Eight Notes Equal One Scale
A scale is, quite simply, eight successive pitches within a one-octave range. All
scales start on one note and end on that same note one octave higher.
Chapter

Part 1: Tones
For example, every C scale starts on C and ends on C; an F scale starts on F
and ends on F; and they all have six more notes in between.
28
The eight notes of a scale; C Major, in this instance.
The first note of a scale is called the tonic, or first degree, of the scale. Not
surprisingly, the second note is called the second degree, the third note is called
the third degree, and so on—until you get to the eighth note, which is the
tonic again.
The major exception to the eight-note scale rule is the scale that includes all
the notes within an octave, including all the sharps and flats. This type of scale
is called a chromatic scale, and (when you start with C) looks something like this:
The C chromatic scale; the top staff shows the scale using sharps, the bottom staff shows the scale
using flats.
Now, any given scale has specific relationships between the different degrees of
the scale. That’s how you can describe different types of scales: A major scale
has different intervals between specific notes from those you’ll find in a similar
minor scale. These different intervals give each type of scale its unique sound.
The most common scale is called the major scale. Major scales are happy scales;
they have pleasant and expected intervals at every turn. (Just sing “Do Re Mi Fa
So La Ti Do” and you’ll hear this pleasant quality.)
The mirror image of the major scale is the minor scale. Minor scales are sad
scales; the intervals between the notes sound a little depressing.
Both major and minor scales can start on any note—from A-flat to G-sharp. No
matter which note you start with, each scale has its own specific combination of
intervals between notes.
The following sections go into more detail about both major and minor scales.
Major Scales
What makes a major scale major are the specific intervals between the notes of
the scale. Every major scale uses the same intervals, as shown in the following
table.
Most musicians
don’t capitalize the word
“minor,” or any of its
abbreviations. Major chord
notation is (almost) always
capitalized, and minor
chord notation is (almost)
always lowercase.

Put another way, the intervals in a major scale go like this: whole, whole, half,

If you start your major scale on C (the C Major scale), you end up playing all
white keys on the piano. C Major is the only major scale that uses only the
white keys; all the other scales have black keys in them.

Minor Scales
Minor scales sound a little less “up” than major scales. This is partly because
the third note of the minor scale is a minor interval, whereas the third note of
the major scale is a major interval. That little half step between a minor third
and a major third makes all the difference in the world!
Not to confuse you; however, whereas there was a single type of major scale,
there actually are three types of minor scales: natural, harmonic, and melodic.
We’ll look at each scale separately.
Natural Minor
The easiest minor scale to construct is the natural minor scale. You can think of
the natural minor in terms of its corresponding major scale. When you start
and end a major scale on the sixth note, instead of the tonic, you get a natural
minor scale.
Here’s an example: Play a C Major scale (C D E F G A B C). Now move up to
the sixth note—or just move down two notes. (It’s the same thing—up six or down
two—both put you on the A.) Now play an eight-note scale, but using the notes
in C Major. What you get—A B C D E F G A—is the A minor (natural) scale.
As you can see, each natural minor scale shares the same tones as a specific
major scale. The following table shows you which minor scales match up with
which major scales.

When you’re playing a piece of music, you typically stay within the
notes of the designated scale. Any notes you play outside the scale are
called chromatic notes; notes within the scale are said to be diatonic.
For example, in the C Major scale, the note C is diatonic; the note 
C-sharp would be chromatic.
Even though chromatic notes might sound “different” than the normal scale notes,
they can add color to a piece of music. (That’s where the term comes from, by
the way; chroma means “color.”)
Tip
If you start your natural
minor scale on A (the A
minor scale), you will play
all white keys on the piano.
The A natural minor scale
is the only minor scale that
uses only the white keys;
all the other scales have
black keys in them.

Harmonic Minor
The harmonic minor scale is similar to the natural minor scale, except the sev-
enth note is raised a half step. Some musicians prefer this type of minor scale
because the seventh note better leads up to the tonic of the scale.

the sixth and seventh notes is three half steps—and you seldom have an interval
in a scale wider than two half steps. (It’s just too awkward to sing.) So the

As if three minor scales weren’t enough to deal with, some music theorists use
this melodic minor scale only when you’re going “up” the scale. (They call this
the ascending melodic minor scale.) Going back down (the descending melodic minor
scale), they use the notes in the natural minor scale. So the sixth and the seventh
degrees are raised on the way up, but not on the way down. Theorists are split
on this issue, however; some use the melodic minor scale both ascending and
descending, and others use the two different scales. It’s okay to use a single scale,
as presented here, as long as you’re aware of the alternate way of doing things.
37

Part 1: Tones
In the Mode
If a scale is a combination of eight successive notes (in alphabetical order, of
course), do any eight notes make a scale?
Not necessarily.
Once you get past the major and minor scales, all the other eight-note combi-
nations aren’t technically called scales; they’re called modes.
38
Modes date all the way back to the ancient Greeks, and the findings of Pythagoras
and Aristotle. In fact, it was Aristotle’s student, Aristoxenus, who formalized the
Greek scheme of modes, which included the Dorian, Ionian, Lydian, and Phrygian.
The name of each mode was based on the final note of the mode.
The number and use of modes were expanded in the era of the medieval church,
where they were called church modes and used in the form of plainsong called
Gregorian chant. The last discovered mode, Locrian, is actually a theoretical
mode; it was never used in the same context as the other church modes.
Chronologically, modes were around long before scales. The major and minor
scales we use today came after the introduction of the various modes, and were,
in fact, based on the Ionian and Aeolian modes, respectively.
Note
There are seven essential modes, each of which can be thought of as starting on
a different degree of the major scale. You stay within the relative major scale;
you just start on different notes.
For example, the Dorian mode starts on the second degree of the major scale.
In relation to the C Major scale, the Dorian mode starts on D, and continues
upward (D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D). The same holds true for the Phrygian mode,
which starts on the third degree of the related major scale—in C Major: E, F,
G, A, B, C, D, E.
Modes are important when you’re constructing melodies. When you create a
melody based on a specific mode, you get to create a different sound or feel while
staying within the notes of a traditional major scale. You just start and stop in
different places. (Melodies based around specific modes are called modal melodies.)
Ionian
If you’re a musician, you play the Ionian mode all the time without really
knowing it. That’s because the Ionian mode starts on the tonic of the related
major scale—and contains the exact same notes as the major scale.
The following table details the half steps between the notes of the Ionian mode.
While it’s convenient to
think of modes in relation
to a specific major scale,
modes are arrangements
of intervals in and of them-
selves. In practice, any
mode can start on any
note.

◆Scales can be either major or minor. (And there are three different types of
minor scales!)
◆All major scales have the same intervals between different notes, no matter
what note they start on.
◆A mode, like a scale, consists of eight notes in a row—but aren’t limited to
just major and minor. Modes are derived from the ancient Greeks and
(later) the medieval church, and can be thought of as starting on different
degrees of the related major scale.

Major and Minor Keys
In This Chapter
◆Understanding major and minor keys
◆Determining key by using key signatures
◆Using the circle of fifths
◆Applying accidentals and changing keys
If you’re writing music within the C Major scale, you have it easy. All the notes
fall in the lines and spaces of the treble and bass clefs; no sharps or flats are nec-
essary. (And, if you’re playing the piano, you don’t have to use those tricky black
keys!)
However, if you’re writing music using another scale, you have to use acciden-
tals to raise and lower notes beyond the white keys on the piano keyboard. For
example, if you’re using the F Major scale, you have a pesky B-flat to deal with.
Now, you could put a flat sign in front of every B-flat in your music. However,
you’ll end up writing a lot of flats—which is a major pain in the butt.
Fortunately, there’s an easy way to designate consistent flats and sharps throughout
an entire piece of music, without noting each and every instance. This approach
requires the knowledge of musical keys—which just happen to correspond to the
musical scales we discussed in the previous chapter.
Keys to Success
When a piece of music is based on a particular musical scale, we say that music
is in the “key” of that scale. For example, a song based around the C Major
scale is in the key of C Major. A song based around the B-flat Major scale is in
the key of B-flat Major.
When you assign a key to a piece of music (or to a section within a larger piece),
it’s assumed that most of the notes in that music will stay within the correspond-
ing scale. So if a piece is written in A Major, most of the notes in the melody
and chords should be within the A Major scale. (There are exceptions to this, of
course; they’re called accidentals; they’re discussed later in this chapter.)
Chapter

Part 1: Tones
46
Using Key Signatures
One of the convenient things about assigning a particular key to a piece of
music is that it enables you to designate the appropriate sharps and flats up
front, without having to repeat them every time they occur in the music.
Here’s how it works.
You designate a key by inserting a key signature at the very start of the music,
next to the first clef on the first staff. This key signature indicates the sharps
and flats used in that particular key. Then, when you play through the entire
piece, you automatically sharpen and flatten the appropriate notes.
For example, let’s say you write a song around the F Major scale. The F Major
scale, if you recall, has one flatted note: B-flat. So next to the first clef on the
first staff, you put a flat sign on the B line. Now, when you play that song,
every time you see a B, you actually play B-flat.
The key signature for the key of F—note the flat sign on the B line, indicating the automatic 
B-flat.
The same would apply if you were playing in the key of G, which has one sharp:
F-sharp. You put a sharp sign on the top F line on the first staff; then every
time you see an F, you play an F-sharp.
Major Keys
Just as there are 15 major scales (including three enharmonics), there are 15
major keys; each with its own key signature. The following table shows what
each key of these key signatures looks like, along with its corresponding scale.

Minor Keys
The key signatures used to indicate major keys also can represent natural minor
keys. As you remember from Chapter 3, a natural minor scale is based on the
same notes as a major scale, but starts on the sixth note of the scale. This same
method applies to keys, so that (for example) the key of A minor uses the same
notes—and the same key signature—as C major.
The following table shows the 15 minor keys, with their corresponding key sig-
natures and scales.

How can you quickly determine which key signature you’re looking at?
It depends on whether the key signature contains sharps or flats.
If the key signature includes flats, the key (no pun intended) is to look at
the next-to-last flat—the one that’s next to the farthest one on the right.
This note determines the key signature.
For example, if a key signature has two flats, you look at the next-to-last flat and
determine that the key is B-flat, which it is. If the key signature has three flats, you
look at the next-to-last flat, and determine that the key is E-flat. It’s pretty easy.
But what do you do if there’s only one flat? There’s no next-to-last flat! For the key
signature with a single flat, the key is F. You’ll have to memorize that one, as you
will the key with no flats or sharps—which is the key of C.
If the key signature includes sharps, the method is different. What you want to
remember here is that the last sharp in the key signature represents the seventh
degree of that particular scale, so that the tonic of the scale is the next note up.
In other words, look at the last sharp and the next note up is the key.
Take, for example, the key signature with one sharp. That sharp is on the note F-
sharp, so the next note up tells you that the key is G. If the key signature has two
sharps, the last one is on the note C-sharp, and the next note up is D—which is
your key. And so on for all the other sharp key signatures.

The Circle of Fifths
There’s a quick way to remember how many sharps or flats to include with each
key signature. This method is called the circle of fifths; it works like this.
Starting with the key of C, for every perfect fifth you move up, you add a sharp.
So the key of G (a perfect fifth up from C) has one sharp. The key of D (a per-
fect fifth up from G) has two sharps … and so on.
The circle of fifths works in the other direction for flats. For every perfect fifth
you move down from C, you add a flat. So the key of F (a perfect fifth down
from C) has one flat. The key of B-flat (a perfect fifth down from F) has two
flats … and so on.
The following drawing shows how all the major keys relate in the circle of
fifths. When you move clockwise around the circle, you’re moving up through
the fifths (and the sharp keys); when you move counterclockwise, you’re mov-
ing down through the fifths (and the flat keys).
All the major keys are a fifth apart in the circle of fifths.
The next figure shows the circle of fifths for the 15 minor keys. It works just the
same as the major-key circle; move clockwise for the sharp keys, and counter-
clockwise for the flat keys.
The circle of fifths works for minor keys, too.

Accidents Will Happen
When you assign a key signature to a piece of music, it’s assumed that all the
following notes will correspond to that particular key. How, then, do you indi-
cate notes that fall outside that key?
First, it should be noted that you can play outside a key. For example, it’s okay
to play the occasional B natural when you’re in the key of F, which normally has
a B-flat. No one will arrest you for it—in fact, certain types of music regularly
employ nonscale notes.
When you decide to write a note that isn’t within the current key, you have to
manually indicate the change in the music—by using sharp, flat, or natural
signs. When musicians see the inserted sharp, flat, or natural, they know to play
the note as written, rather than as indicated by the music’s key signature.
These “outside the key” notes are called accidentals or chromatic notes; they’re
quite common.
For example, let’s say a piece of music is in the key of F, which has only one flat
(B-flat). You want your melody to include an E-flat, which isn’t in the key. So
when you get to that note, you insert a flat sign before the E to indicate an 
E-flat. It’s as simple as that.
51
Jazz and blues music often
add flatted thirds and sev-
enths within the desig-
nated major key, which
give these styles their
unique sound.
Note
Use accidentals to indicate notes outside the current key signature.
The same theory would apply if you want to include a B natural in the same
piece, instead of the expected B-flat. If you simply insert a natural sign before
the B, you’ve accomplished your mission.
When you change a note with an accidental, that accidental applies until the
end of the current measure. At the start of the next measure, it’s assumed that all
notes revert to what they should be, given the current key. So if you flat an E in
measure one of an F Major melody, the first E you write in measure two will be
assumed to be natural; not flatted.
The one exception to this rule occurs when you tie a note from the end of one
measure to the beginning of the next. The accidental carries over—thanks to the
tie—to that first note in the second measure, as you can see in the following exam-
ple. (Ties are explained in Chapter 5.) Note that the accidental doesn’t apply to
any subsequent notes in the second measure; it applies only to the tied note.
An accidental
applies only from that
point in the measure to the
end of the measure. It
doesn’t affect those notes
in the measure before the
accidental appears.
Warning
Accidentals apply to all notes tied over a measure.

Part 1: Tones
If you think other musicians might be confused about whether a note has
reverted back to normal, it’s okay to use a courtesy sharp, flat, or natural sign.
(This is a sign placed within parentheses.) This reminds the reader that the note
has reverted back to its normal state. You don’t have to use courtesy signs like
this, but when the music is complicated, it can be quite helpful.
52
A courtesy accidental reminds musicians that a changed note has reverted back to normal.
Changing Keys
Some long pieces of music don’t always use the same key throughout the entire
piece. In fact, some short pop songs change keys midway through. It’s allowed.
When you change keys in the middle of a song, it’s called modulating to another
key. You can modulate to any key, although the most common modulations are
up a half step (from E Major to F Major, for example), or up a fourth or fifth
(from E Major to either A Major or B Major, for example).
When you want to change keys, you indicate this by inserting a new key signa-
ture in the first measure of the new key. It’s as simple as that, as you can see in
the following figure. (Note that some composers and arrangers also insert a
double bar whenever there’s a key change.)
The half-step modula-
tion is most common
in twentieth-century
popular music, and
can add a “lift” to the end
of a pop song. The fourth
or fifth modulation is more
common in classical music
of the seventeenth through
the nineteenth centuries.
Tip
To change keys, insert a new key signature.
The only complicated key change is when you’re changing to the key of C—
which has no sharps or flats. You indicate this by using natural signs to cancel
out the previous sharps or flats, like this:
If you want, you can alert musicians to a key change by placing the
appropriate sharps and flats at the very end of the last staff of the old
key—as well as with a new key signature in the following measure. This
approach is entirely optional; it’s perfectly acceptable to signal the key
change with a single key signature in the first measure of the new key.

The Least You Need to Know
◆You use key signatures to indicate what scale your music is based on.
◆The sharps and flats in a key signature are automatically applied through-
out the entire song.
◆To indicate notes outside the current key, use accidentals—sharps, flats,
and natural signs.
◆To change the key in the middle of a piece of music, insert a new key sig-
nature.

Lesson 4, Track 27
Part 1 of this book covered how to work with pitch—but that’s only half of the
music theory that you need to know. In this chapter we’ll deal with the other
half of the equation, which is how you work with time—which, in music, is
called rhythm.
Rhythm is what drives the music forward and gives it its beat. To learn rhythm,
you have to learn about note values. This type of music notation isn’t that hard,
really. All you need to learn is a little basic math and how to count—up to four.
Before we start, however, let’s lay down some ground rules for this chapter.
While a lot of songs are written with four beats to a measure—one, two, three,
four—that isn’t a universal. Some very popular songs only have three beats to a
measure. (Think “My Favorite Things,” from The Sound of Music.) And other
tunes, especially in the jazz and classical genres, have more than four beats per
measure.
To make it easier to learn the basics, in this chapter we’re only going to address
four-beat measures—what we call 4/4 time. All the other types of beats—three,
five, seven, whatever—will be covered in Chapter 6.
And that’s why I said you only have to know how to count to four!
Chapter

Part 2: Rhythms
58
Taking the Measure of Things
Rhythm is about counting. Listen to your favorite pop song, and feel the beat.
(Go ahead, tap your foot—it’s okay!) You’ll likely feel the beats fall into groups
of four—one, two, three, four; one, two, three, four …. It’s easy to hear because
it’s very natural.
Let’s use a specific example—“Mary Had a Little Lamb.” The notes of the
song fall into groups of four; just replace the words “Ma-ry had a” with “one
two three four” and you see how it works.
In this song, and other songs based around groups of four, each group of four
beats is called a measure, a container that holds a specific number of beats. In
standard 4/4 time, a measure holds the equivalent of four quarter notes. The
beginning and end of a measure are signified by bar lines, like this:
The first beat in a measure is counted as one. The second beat is counted as
two. The third beat is counted as three, and the last beat is counted as four.
There is no five; if you count out five you’ve counted too far! Whenever you hit
four, the next beat is always one.
Every time four beats go by—one, two, three, four—another measure is com-
pleted. If you put enough measures together—one, two, three, four; one, two,
three, four—you have a song.
Taking Note—of Notes
Every time you sing or play a tone, you’re also singing or playing a note value.
There are different types of note values, with each note value signifying a spe-
cific length of time—as measured by parts of a measure.
To better explain, we have to get into a little math. (Don’t worry—there won’t
be any story problems!) You see, each note value lasts a specific duration, and
each duration reflects a ratio to duration. As you can see from the following fig-
ure, each shorter note is precisely half the duration of the previous note. So if
you can divide and multiply by two, this should be fairly easy for you.
A group of measures on a staff; each measure is separated by left and right bar lines.

Chapter 5: Note Values and Basic Notation
The most common rhythmic notes—each smaller note is exactly half the previous note.
Whole Notes
The most basic note is called the whole note, which is called a whole note
because, in 4/4 time (we’ll get to this soon—I promise!), it lasts a whole meas-
ure. Because 4/4 time has four beats in a measure, this means a whole note lasts
four beats. A whole note looks like a big empty oval, nice and whole.
59
Whole notes, at different places on the staff.
When you put a whole note in a measure of 4/4 time, that’s the only note that
goes in that measure; no other notes will fit. When you play a whole note, you
play your instrument once at the very beginning of the measure (on beat one),
and then you hold that tone through the entire measure. In other words, one
whole note should last a whole measure.
Half Notes
Because the whole note is the largest note, let’s go down one size and look at the
next smallest note. Remember that I said each shorter note is exactly half the
previous note? Let’s apply a little math and divide a whole note by two to see
what we get.
The next smallest note is called a half note. (It’s half of a whole note—pretty
simple, eh?) Because a whole note lasts a whole measure (in 4/4, anyway), a half
note lasts a half measure. This means a half note lasts two beats, which is half of

Part 2: Rhythms
the four-beat duration of a whole note. Put another way, you can put two half
notes in a measure, because two half notes equal one whole note.
A half note looks like a whole note with a line next to it. The line is called a
stem; it can point up or down, depending on the pitch of the note. If the stem
points down, it sits to the left of the notehead. If the stem points up, it sits to
the right of the notehead.
60
Two half notes—one with the stem pointing up; the other with the stem pointing down.
If the notehead (the part of the note that isn’t the stem) is on or above
the third (middle) line of the staff, then the stem should point down from
the notehead. If the notehead is below the third line of the staff, then the
stem should point up from the notehead. 
The only exception to this guideline is when you have a run of connected
notes—notes where all the stems are connected, like a run of eighth or sixteenth
notes. It’s okay to run two or more of these connected notes together with their
stems in the same direction, even if they move past that third line of the staff, to
make the music easier to read.
Tip
When you play a half note, make sure the tone lasts a full two beats. If you let
up after the first beat, you’re playing only half a half note—which is what we’ll
discuss next.
Quarter Notes
Let’s keep going. If a half note is half a whole note, what is half a half note?
Well, do your math, and when you divide 1⁄2 by 2, you get 1⁄4. This means half a
half note is a quarter note.
Because a half note lasts two beats, a quarter note—which is half that duration—
lasts one beat. Put another way, you can fit four quarter notes in a measure; one
to a beat.
When you tap your foot to the beat of most popular songs, your foot is tapping
quarter notes. One, two, three, four—each of those counts is a quarter note.
A quarter note looks like a half note with the notehead filled in, as shown here:
A notehead is the
big, oval part of a note.
The stem is always
attached to the notehead.
Definition
Two different quarter notes, pointing in both directions.

Chapter 5: Note Values and Basic Notation
61
Eighth Notes
Just like the scientists in Fantastic Voyage or that miniature DC Comics super-
hero called the Atom, notes just keep getting smaller. Again, we’re operating
on a 2-to-1 ratio, so let’s take a quarter note and divide it in half. Doing the
math, 1⁄4 ÷ 2 = 1⁄8—so the next-smallest note is the eighth note.
Just as there are four quarter notes in a measure of 4/4 time (4 × 1⁄4 = 1), each
measure holds eight eighth notes (8 × 1⁄8 = 1). Put another way, there are two
eighth notes for every quarter note (2 × 1⁄8 = 1⁄4)—or two eighth notes for every
beat.
An eighth note looks like a quarter note with a flag on it. If you have two or
more eighth notes in a row, the flags can be replaced with horizontal stems at
the end of the normal horizontal stems. (The flags don’t have to be joined
together; sometimes it’s just easier to read that way.)
A flag is the little
doohickey dangling off the
stem of eighth notes, six-
teenth notes, and all smaller
notes. (It actually looks like
a country’s flag flying off a
mast.) The flag is always
at the end of the stem, so
if the stem is pointing up,
the flag is above the note-
head; if the stem is point-
ing down, the flag is
below the notehead.
Definition
A variety of different eighth notes.
Sixteenth Notes
Okay, you know where this is going. Half an eighth note is (do the math!) a six-
teenth note (1⁄8 ÷ 2 = 1⁄16). There are 16 sixteenth notes in a measure (16 × 1⁄16 = 1),
or 4 sixteenth notes per one quarter-note beat (4 × 1⁄16 = 1⁄4).
A sixteenth note looks like a quarter note with two flags on it. As with the eighth
note, if 2 or more sixteenth notes are next to each other, the flags may (or may
not) be joined together.
A variety of different sixteenth notes.
Although we’ll end this discussion with sixteenth notes, there are lots of notes even
smaller than that. Each successive note is half the value of the previous note and
is indicated by an additional flag on the stem.
For example, the thirty-second note is the next-smallest note after the sixteenth note; 
it has three flags on its stem. After that is the sixty-fourth note, with four flags. In
actuality, you won’t run into too many notes smaller than the sixteenth note.

Taking Count
It’s fairly easy to write down a series of notes—but how do you communicate
notes and values to other musicians verbally? Do you go all mathematical and
say things such as “the fourteenth sixteenth note” or “the eighth note after the
two sixteenth notes on beat four”—or is there an easier way to describe your
rhythms?
Just as you describe absolute pitches by using letters (A through G), you describe
absolute rhythms by using numbers—and you need only to be able to count to
four.
It starts fairly simple, in that each beat in a measure is counted as either one,
two, three, or four. So if you’re counting off four quarter notes, you count
them as one, two, three, four. If you want to talk about the fourth quarter note
in a measure, you call it “four,” as in “in the last measure, make sure you play a
B-flat on four.”
If the beat is always one, two, three, or four, what about the eighth notes that
lay between the beats? It’s simple: count them as “and” as in “one-and, two-
and, three-and, four-and,” all very even. You’d talk about an eighth note like
this: “Make sure you play a C-sharp on the and after three.”
This is pretty easy—but what about sixteenth notes? This gets a little tricky, but
it’ll seem natural once you get into it. Use the nonsense syllables “e” and “ah”
to represent the sixteenth notes between eighth notes. So if you’re counting a
group of straight sixteenth notes, you’d count “one-e-and-ah, two-e-and-ah,
three-e-and-ah, four-e-and-ah,” all nice and even. Still not sure about this?
Examine the following figure, which shows how to count various groupings of
notes.
How to count various types of notes.
Taking a Rest
If a note represents the duration of a pitch, what do you call it when you’re not
playing or singing? In music, when you’re not playing, you’re resting—so any
note you don’t play is called a rest.
When you see four quarter notes, you play or sing four tones—one per beat.
When you see four quarter note rests, you don’t play four tones; you rest over
four beats.
Each type of note—whole note, half note, and so on—has a corresponding rest
of the same duration. So you have a whole rest that lasts a whole measure, a half
rest that lasts a half measure, and so on. Rests are used to indicate the spaces in
between the notes and are just as important as the notes you play.

Chapter 5: Note Values and Basic Notation
The following table shows all the notes you’ve just learned and their correspond-
ing rests.

Taking a Note—and Dotting It
Sooner or later you’ll run into something a little different: a note or a rest with
a dot after it. When you run into one of these dotted notes, that note should have
a longer duration than the normal version of that note—one and a half times
longer, to be precise.
Here’s where your math skills come back into play. Let’s take a dotted quarter
note as an example. A regular quarter note is worth a single beat. If you multi-
ply 1 × 11⁄2, you get 11⁄2 beats—so a dotted quarter note is worth 11⁄2 beats. You
also could go about it by saying a quarter note equals four sixteenth notes, and
4 × 11⁄2 = 6, and 6 sixteenth notes equal 11⁄2 quarter notes. However you do the
math, it comes out the same.
So when you see a dotted note, hold that note 50 percent longer than you
would do normally, as shown in the following table.
Dotted Note Values
This Dotted Note …
Equals This
You can also have dotted rests, which work the same as dotted notes. When you
see a dot after a rest, that rest should last one and a half times the value of the
main rest.
63

Part 2: Rhythms
Taking Two Notes—and Tying Them Together
Another way to make a note longer is to tie it to another note. A tie is a little
rounded connector placed between two notes; it essentially tells you to add the
second note to the first note.
64
A tie makes one note out of two.
When you see two or more notes tied together, you play them as if they’re a
single note; for example, two quarter notes tied together equal one half note.
What do you do if the tied notes are on different pitches? Well, this may look
like a tie, but it isn’t really a tie—it’s a slur. A slur is a way of indicating that two
(or more) notes are to be played in a smoothly connected fashion, rather than as
distinctly separate notes.
Another way to think
about a dotted note
is that it has a dura-
tion equal to three of
the next-smaller note value.
For example, a dotted half
note equals 3 quarter notes,
a dotted quarter note equals
3 eighth notes, and a dot-
ted eighth note equals 3 six-
teenth notes.
Tip
This isn’t really a tie; it’s a slur.
Taking the Beat and Dividing by Three
There’s another little oddity in rhythmic notation—and this one is very impor-
tant. Everything we’ve done up to now has divided notes and beats by two.
What happens, then, if you divide by something other than two?
The most common division other than two is dividing by three; this is called a
triplet. When you see the number three over a group of three notes (or three
rests—or any combination of three equal notes and rests), you know that those
three notes have to fit into a space that would normally hold just two notes.
The three notes of a triplet fit in the space of two regular notes.
Triplets have more of a rolling feel than straight notes and are counted as “trip-
ah-let.” You can have triplets of any note value, although quarter-note triplets
(where three of them are spaced over two beats), eighth-note triplets (three on
a single quarter-note beat), and sixteenth-note triplets (three in the space of a
single eighth note) are the most common.

Chapter 5: Note Values and Basic Notation
The Least You Need to Know
◆Note values are named according to their duration. Whole notes last a
whole measure (in 4/4 time), half notes last a half measure, and so on.
◆Each smaller note lasts half as long as the previous note. A quarter note,
for example, is half as long as a half note.
◆Each note value has a corresponding rest of the same duration—which
indicates not to play or sing.
◆A dot after a note or rest extends the value of that note by 50 percent.
◆When you fit three notes into a space that normally holds only two, those
notes are called triplets.

Triplets are the most common uneven rhythmic division, but not the only one. You
can divide a beat any way you like, which can lead to groups of five or seven
or any prime number. (If you divide a beat by a nonprime number, you’re actually
dividing by two or more groups of a prime number. For example, if you divide a
beat into six, you’re really dividing into two groups of three—or two triplets.)

Time Signatures
In This Chapter
◆Understanding how time signatures determine meter
◆Learning both usual and odd time signatures
◆Changing time signatures
◆Subdividing odd time signatures
In the previous chapter you learned about measures, those containers that hold
the beats of a piece of music. The start and end points of a measure are marked
by vertical bar lines, and multiple measures combine to create a complete song.
To simplify things, in Chapter 5 we limited our discussion to measures with
four beats apiece, with each of those beats equaling a quarter note. That covers
a lot of different songs, especially in popular music. Whatever type of music
you listen to—rock-and-roll, soul, jazz, country, hip hop, or even reggae—most
of the songs you hear are likely to adhere to this four-beat form.
However, not all music has four beats per measure, and not every beat is equal
to a quarter note. To understand all the different numbers and types of beats
per measure, you need only to apply a little math—in the form of fractions.
Measuring the Beats
Written music uses something called a time signature to signify how many beats
are in a measure and what kind of note is used for the basic beat. A time signa-
ture looks kind of like a fraction, with one number sitting on top of another
number. The top number indicates how many beats are in a measure; the bot-
tom number indicates the note value of the basic beat.
Time signatures show how beats are organized in a particular piece of music.
This organization is called meter, and time signatures are sometimes called
meter signatures.
Chapter

Part 2: Rhythms
68
Let’s take the four-quarter-notes-to-a-measure form we used in the previous
chapter. Because we have four beats in a measure, the top number in the time
signature is a four. Because the basic beat is a quarter note, the bottom number
is a four (as in the 4 in 1/4). So the standard form we’ve been using is called
“four four” time (because of the 4 on top of the 4), and looks like this:
The time signature for 4/4 meter.
Other time signatures follow this same form. For example, if our measures have
three beats instead of four, and still use a quarter note for the beat, we have a
3/4 time signature. If you have three beats per measure but the basic beat is an
eighth note instead of a quarter note, that time signature is “three eight,” or 3/8.
Read on to learn more about the different types of time signatures you’re likely
to encounter in the world of music.
Quarter-Note Time
The most common types of time signatures use a quarter note for the base beat.
However, you’re not limited to just four beats (quarter notes) per measure;
quarter-note time signatures can have as few as one beat per measure, or as
many as … well, as many as you like!
Although 4/4 is the most common quarter-note time signature, you’ll almost
definitely run into its close cousin, 3/4. In 3/4 time, you have three quarter
notes per measure; the measures are counted “one two three, one two three.” If
you’ve ever heard a waltz, you’ve heard 3/4 time.
Another common quarter-note time signature is 2/4 time. This time signature
is common in marches and other fast music, and is very easy to play. After all,
two measures of 2/4 add up to one measure of 4/4!
Less common are quarter-note time signatures with more than four beats per
measure. For example, 5/4 time feels a little awkward, especially if you’re used
to feeling the “backbeat” in a 4/4 pop song. But jazz musicians play a lot of
5/4—just listen to the Dave Brubeck Quartet’s famous recording of “Take Five”
if you want to hear a good example of playing in five.
The following table shows some of the more common quarter-note time signa-
tures.
Classical musicians tend
to refer to the organization
of beats as “meter,” while
jazz and pop musicians
tend to refer to it as “time,”
as in “4/4 meter” or
“4/4 time.”
Note
In most rock and pop
music, the second and
fourth beats of a measure
are accented, typically by
the drummer, like this: one
TWO three FOUR, one
TWO three FOUR. (When
you clap your hands to a
song, you’re probably clap-
ping on two and four.)
This heavy “backbeat” is
what gives rock-and-roll its
rolling rhythm; it is so com-
mon that it’s noticeable
when it is absent.

By the way, 4/4 time is sometimes called common time, and indicated by a large
“C” for the time signature, like this:
4/4 time is common time--indicated by a big “C.”
Eighth-Note Time
Not all music uses a quarter note for the beat. A lot of music—especially classi-
cal music—is based on an eighth-note beat.

Part 2: Rhythms
When you have an eighth-note time signature, such as 3/8 or 6/8, every time you
tap your foot you’re tapping an eighth note; not a quarter note. So for a measure
of 3/8, you’d tap three eighth notes; for a measure of 6/8, you’d tap six eighth notes.
When the eighth note is the beat, half a beat (the “and” after the beat, if you’re
counting) will be a sixteenth note. Also, if you see a quarter note in an eighth-
note time signature, that note takes up two beats.
It’s all about math, basically. When you play in an eighth-note time signature, all
your normal note values take up half as much space as they do in a quarter-note
time signature. It’s simple division.
The most common eighth-note time signatures are those divisible by three: 3/8,
6/8, 9/8, and so on. When you’re playing one of these time signatures and you’re
playing really fast, you might end up tapping your foot just once every three
beats, like this: ONE two three FOUR five six, ONE two three FOUR five six.
(In fact, many conductors will conduct 6/8 time with just two downbeats per
measure—the one and the four.) These time signatures sound a lot like 3/4, the
waltz time signature. The following table details the most common eighth-note
time signatures.

Half Time
If you move the other direction from the basic quarter-note time signature, you
get into time signatures based on a half-note beat. In a half-note time signature,
each half note gets one beat; quarter notes get half a beat, and eighth notes get
a quarter of a beat. Whole notes, on the other hand, get just two beats. (It’s not
really that confusing; it’s just more math to deal with.)
Half-note beats—2/2, 3/2, and the like—are typically used in classical music for
slower, more sweeping passages.
The following table presents the most common half-note beats.

Don’t assume that an eighth-note time signature is automatically twice as
fast as a quarter-note time signature. Although this might be true (and almost
always is true when time signatures change in the middle of a song), the speed
of the beat (what musicians call tempo) is independent of the time signature.
Thus, a song in 3/8 time actually could be played slower than a song in 3/4.
(Learn more about tempo in Chapter 7.)
Warning

Part 2: Rhythms
72
Just as 4/4 is sometimes called common time, 2/2 is sometimes called cut time.
You can indicate 2/2 by either the normal time signature, or by a large C with a
line through it, like this:
2/2 time is cut-time—thus you cut a “C” in half.
Changing the Time
You always indicate the time signature at the very beginning of a piece of music.
However, you don’t have to keep the same time signature through the entire
song; you can change time anywhere you want in a piece of music; even for just
a measure or two!
If the meter changes in the middle of a song, you insert a new time signature at
the point of change. This new time signature remains in effect through the rest
of the song, or until another new time signature is introduced.
Here’s what a time change looks like in the middle of a piece of music:
In most music nota-
tion, the time signa-
ture is shown only
on the first line of
music (or when there’s a
time change)—unlike the
key signature, which is
typically shown at the start
of each line.
Tip
Changing time signatures in the middle of a song.
Grouping the Beats
If you see a piece of music in 9/8 and despair about counting that high (nine’s a
lot higher than four), there’s a way around the problem. You can do as many
musicians do: Chop up each measure into smaller groupings.
When you’re playing in odd time signatures—especially those with more than
four beats per measure—it’s common to subdivide the beats within a measure
into an easier-to-grasp pattern. Using smaller groupings not only makes each
measure easier to count; it also makes the music flow better. When you sub-
divide measures in this fashion, you create sub-rhythms behind the basic beat,
which makes the music easier to listen to.
For example, if you’re playing in 6/8 time, you could count all the beats evenly
(one, two, three, four, five, six)—or you could subdivide the beat. The most
common subdivision of 6/8 divides the measure into two equal parts, each con-
taining three beats, like this:

Chapter 6: Time Signatures
Subdividing a 6/8 measure into two groups of three.
So you count the measure “one two three; one two three,” or “one lah lay, two
lah lay.” Easier, isn’t it?
Of course, you could also divide 6/8 into three groups of two, or one group of
four and one group of two, or one group of one and one group of five, but the
two groups of three is the most common way to play this particular time signa-
ture.
For another example, let’s look at 5/4 time. In 5/4, measures are typically sub-
divided into one group of three and one group of two, like this:
73
Subdividing 5/4 time into one group of three and one group of two.
You count each measure “one, two, three; one, two.”
Of course, you could also reverse the groupings, and end up with two beats in the
first group and three beats in the second—“one, two; one, two, three.” It depends
on the feel and the flow of the music.
The more beats you have in a measure, the more possible groupings you can come
up with. To demonstrate, the following example shows three possible groupings of
7/4 time—4+3, 3+4, and 2+3+2.
Three different ways to group 7/4 time.
Just for fun, count all the way up to eleven, and see how many groupings you can
come up with for a measure of 11/4!
The Least You Need to Know
◆You have to place a time signature at the beginning of a piece of music—or
anywhere you change the basic meter or time.
◆The top number in a time signature indicates the number of beats per measure.
◆The bottom number in a time signature indicates what note is used for the
basic beat.
◆Odd time signatures are sometimes broken up into smaller groupings, to
make each measure easier to count.

Tempo, Dynamics, and
Navigation
In This Chapter
◆Determining how fast to play
◆Changing tempo
◆Determining how loud to play
◆Changing dynamics and accenting notes
◆Repeating parts of a song
You might not have noticed, but the first six chapters of this book taught you
how to read and write music. That’s right—all those bits about staves, clefs,
notes, and rests comprise what we call the standard music notation, which is the
common language of all musicians.
Think of it this way: The staff, clef, and key signature determine where a note
is in terms of pitch. The time signature and note value determine where a note
is in terms of time, or rhythm. By placing a note in this two-dimensional space,
you tell a musician everything he or she needs to know to play that note—and
all the notes that follow.
The only thing you haven’t learned about music notation is how to signify the
speed (tempo) and loudness (dynamics) of a piece of music. That’s what we’ll
cover in this chapter, along with some simple navigational aids to help you get
from one point to another within a song.
Taking the Pulse
In Chapter 6 you learned how to figure out how many beats there are in a meas-
ure. The question remains, however, how fast those beats should be played.
The speed of a piece of music—how fast the beat goes by—is called the tempo.
A faster tempo means a faster beat; a slower tempo makes for a slower song.
Chapter

Part 2: Rhythms
78
You can indicate tempo in one of two ways: by indicating the precise number of
beats per minute or by using traditional Italian terms. We’ll discuss both meth-
ods next.
Beats per Minute
The most accurate way to indicate tempo is by specifying a certain number of
beats per minute, or bpm. This gives you a very precise speed for your song,
especially when you use a metronome or a click track on a computer. You set your
metronome or click to a specific bpm number, and it tick-tocks back and forth
at the proper speed. When you play along to the metronome or click track,
you’re playing at exactly the right tempo.
Setting the tempo—120 quarter-note beats per minute.
As you’ll soon see, many
notation markings (espe-
cially for classical music)
are in Italian. This speaks
to the importance of Italian
culture in the evolution of
Western music, but it also
means it wouldn’t be a
bad thing to know a little
Italian—and I don’t mean
a short guy named Mario!
Note
In classical music, the
abbreviation MM (for
Maelzel’s Metronome) is
used to represent beats
per minute.
Note
A metronome is a device that precisely ticks off beat after beat at a
specified tempo. Metronomes can be either old-fashioned, pendulum-type
affairs or modern computerized devices that emit a type of electronic
beat. The metronome was invented by a man named Maelzel, who was a con-
temporary of Beethoven. In addition to inventing the metronome, Maelzel also
developed a hearing aid to help Beethoven deal with his advancing deafness.
When you’re playing professionally (especially in recording studios), you might
run into something called a click track, which is a type of electronic metronome.
The click track is typically played on a synthesized instrument, like an electronic
woodblock or cowbell. Click tracks can also be generated by computerized
sequencing and recording programs, for when you’re recording at home. (To
hear what a click track sounds like, listen to the rhythm and melody exercises on
the accompanying CD; I use a click to “count off” each of the exercises.)
Definition
Italian Tempo Terms
The second way to indicate tempo, typically found in orchestral music, is
through the use of traditional Italian musical terms. These terms correspond to
general tempo ranges, as indicated in the following table, which is arranged
from the very slowest to the very fastest tempo.

Chapter 7: Tempo, Dynamics, and Navigation
Italian Tempo Terms
Tempo
Means …
Slow Tempos (40–75 bpm)
grave
Very slow; solemn
largo
Slow and dignified
larghetto
A little faster than largo
lento
Slow
adagio
Moderately slow
adagietto
A little faster than adagio
Moderate Tempos (70–115 bpm)
andante
A “walking” tempo
andantino
A little faster than andante
moderato
Moderate pace
allegretto
Not quite as fast as allegro
Fast Tempos (110–220 bpm)
allegro
Fast, cheerful
vivace
Lively
presto
Very fast
prestissimo
Very, very fast
79
These tempo markings are very approximate, and even the order is not 100 per-
cent observed. The important thing the Italian terms try to get across is the
“spirit” of the music. For example, the word allegro in Italian really means
“cheerful.” When these markings are used, the precise tempo is always left to
the discretion of the orchestra’s conductor.
So when you see a piece of music marked “Allegro,” such as Bach’s Brandenburg
Concerto No. 6, you know that it should be played fairly fast. If you see a piece
marked “Largo,” like the second movement of Dvor˘ák’s New World Symphony,
you know that the tempo should be fairly slow. This method isn’t terribly pre-
cise, but it will get you in the ballpark.
Sometimes you’ll
see these tempo
terms accompanied
by the word molto,
which means “very.” So if
you see molto vivace, you
know that the music should
be played “very lively.”
Tip
Specifying tempo using traditional Italian terms.

Part 2: Rhythms
Speeding Up—and Slowing Down
Some pieces of music retain the same tempo throughout the entire song (think
most popular music here). Other pieces of music speed up and slow down at
times; often for dramatic effect.
If a tempo change is immediate—that is, you go directly from one tempo to
another, with no gradual transition—you indicate the change by inserting a new
tempo marking of your choice. For example, if you’ve been playing at 120 bpm
and want to switch to a faster tempo—160 bpm, let’s say—all you have to do is
insert a new 160 bpm tempo mark. If you’re using Italian tempo markings, just
insert the new marking where you want the tempo to change.
If you’d rather gradually speed up or slow down the tempo, it’s time to learn a
new set of Italian markings. There are several you can use, but the most com-
mon are ritardando (to gradually slow down the tempo) and accelerando (to gradu-
ally speed up the tempo). The following table presents all the tempo-changing
markings you’re likely to encounter:
Indicating Tempo Changes
Indicator
Means …
ritardando (rit., retard.)
Gradually slow down
rallentando (rall.)
Gradually slow down
ritenuto (riten.)
Hold back the tempo
accelerando (accel.)
Gradually speed up
doppio movimento
Twice as fast
a tempo
Return to the previous tempo
tempo primo
Return to the tempo at the beginning of the piece
80
Decreasing the tempo using a ritardando marking.
Hold That Note!
Sometimes you don’t just want to slow down, you actually want to stop. When
you want to ignore the beat and hold a specific note, you use what’s called a fer-
mata, which looks like a little bird’s eye placed on top of a note (or a rest) and
indicates a pause in the music. This means you hold that note (or rest) indefi-
nitely or until the conductor cuts you off; then you start up with the next note
after the fermata, at normal tempo.

Chapter 7: Tempo, Dynamics, and Navigation
81
When you see a fermata, hold the note.
Getting Loud—and Getting Soft
You now know how to indicate how fast or how slow a song should be played.
How do you indicate how loud or how soft you should play it?
Dynamic Markings
A song’s dynamics indicate how loud or soft you should play. In the world of
music notation, there is a set range of volume levels, from very soft to very
loud, that you use to indicate the dynamic level of a piece of music. These
dynamic markings are shown in the following table:
Dynamic Markings
Marking
Dynamic
Means …
ppp
pianississimo
Very, very soft
pp
pianissimo
Very soft
p
piano
Soft
mp
mezzo piano
Medium soft
mf
mezzo forte
Medium loud
f
forte
Loud
ff
fortissimo
Very loud
fff
fortississimo
Very, very loud
The dynamic marking, just like the tempo marking, typically appears at the
beginning of the song. If you don’t see a dynamic marking, that means the song
should be played at a medium volume.
Use dynamic markings to indicate how loud a song should be played.
Changing Dynamics
Dynamics can—and do—change throughout the course of a piece of music.

Part 2: Rhythms
82
To abruptly change the volume level at a specific point, insert a new dynamic
marking. It’s okay to indicate dramatic changes in volume; you can go from pp
in one measure to ff in the next, if you want.
To gradually change the volume of a song, you have to use what we call crescendo
and decrescendo marks. The crescendo mark (which looks like a giant hairpin,
closed at the left and widening to the right) indicates that you gradually increase
the volume from your current level to the new level indicated at the end of the
crescendo. The decrescendo mark (which looks like a hairpin open at the left
and closed at the right) indicates that you gradually decrease the volume from
your current level to the new level indicated at the end of the decrescendo.
Crescendos and decrescendos indicate gradual increases or decreases in volume.
Crescendos and decrescendos can be relatively short (just a beat or two) or
extend over multiple measures. Obviously, the longer the crescendo or
decrescendo, the more gradual is the change in volume.
Play It Harder
If you want a specific note to be played louder than the other notes around it,
you’ll want to place an accent mark (>) over that note. When a note is accented,
you simply play it louder than a normal note.
To indicate that a note is to be played very loud (or hit very hard, if you’re writ-
ing a percussion part), you place a marcato (ˆ ) over the note. This means you
play or hit that extra hard—with a good solid punch!
You can use three other markings to indicate a sudden accent. These markings,
like all Italian notation, are placed under the note in question, as detailed in the
following table.
Italian Accent Markings
Marking
Means …
fz
Sudden accent (forzando)
sf
Forced (sforzando)
sfz
Even more forced (sforzando)
The way you can
remember whether
the marking means
to get louder or
softer is that the wider the
“mouth” of the hairpin, the
louder the music. When 
the mouth is at the left and
then narrows, that means
you start loud and get
softer. When the mouth is
at the right, that means you
start soft and get louder.
Tip
Technically, the marcato is
not an accent. The formal
definition means to play
the note “well marked,” or
distinct from the surround-
ing notes. In practice,
however, this translates
into a loud, long accent.
Note

Chapter 7: Tempo, Dynamics, and Navigation
83
Two accent marks and a marcato.
More Dynamics
There are even more musical markings you can use to indicate how loud or soft a
piece of music is to be played, although these are less frequently used than those
already presented. These additional markings are listed in the following table.
Additional Dynamic Markings

Finding Your Way
Reading a long piece of music is a little like reading a roadmap. You’ll see various
indications in a score that provide direction, to repeat a section or to jump to
another section within the song.

Part 2: Rhythms
84
When you’re playing a long piece of music, various parts of the song might be
indicated by numbers or by letters. For example, you might see the letter A at
the beginning of the first verse, and the letter B at the beginning of the second
verse, and the letter C at the start of the chorus. This way other musicians can
tell you to start at a specific point in the song by saying, “Start at letter B.”
Alternatively, the measures of a song might be numbered. If this is the case,
you can say “Start at measure 16”; everyone will know what you mean.
In any case, you need some way to determine just where you are in a piece of
music; otherwise you’ll always have to start at the beginning—even if all you
need to practice is the very end!
Repeating Sections
There are various shorthand methods you can use when writing or arranging a
piece of music. Especially useful are various ways to indicate repeating sections,
which saves you the trouble of writing out the exact same music two (or more)
times.
When you have a section of music that should be repeated, you border that
section by a pair of repeat marks. One repeat mark indicates the start of the sec-
tion to be repeated; the other one indicates the end of that section. Unless
noted otherwise, you repeat a section only once (that is, you play it twice), and
then you move on to the next section.
A long piece of
music (especially in the
orchestral environment) is
often called a score. More
precisely, the score is the
piece of music the conduc-
tor uses, which contains all
the parts for all the instru-
ments and voices. The music
for each individual instru-
ment is not technically a
score, although sometimes
people refer to it as such.
Definition
Learn more about the vari-
ous sections of a song in
Chapter 11.
Note
Use repeat marks to indicate a range of measures to play twice.
Sometimes you’ll need to repeat a section but play a slightly different ending
the second time through. When you see this in the score—called a first ending
and a second ending—you play the first ending the first time through, and then
when you repeat the section you skip the first ending and play the second ending.
Use first and second endings to end a repeated section two different ways.
You also can repeat a section of a song by returning to a section designated with
a sign (called a Segno sign). For example, when you see the notation “D.S. al
Fine,” you jump back to the Segno sign and play through to the end of the
song.

Chapter 7: Tempo, Dynamics, and Navigation
Another navigation technique uses a separate section of music called the Coda.
When you insert a Coda sign in your music, that indicates that you should
jump to the section marked Coda. A common navigation technique is notated
“D.C. al Coda” or “D.C. al Fine,” where you jump to the beginning of the
song and then follow through to the Coda or the end (Fine). The following
table details these and other common Italian navigation markings.
Italian Navigation Markings
Marking
Means …
D.C. al Fine
Go back to the beginning and play through to the end.
D.C. al Coda
Go back to the beginning and play to the Coda sign; then
skip to the Coda section.
D.S. al Fine
Go back to the Segno sign and play through to the end.
D.S. al Coda
Go back to the Segno sign and play to the Coda sign; then
skip to the Coda section.
85
“D.S.” is short for
Dal Segno, which means
“from the Segno” (or, in
English, “from the sign”).
“D.C.” is short for Dal
Capo, which means “from
the head” or “from the
start.” (Capo is Italian for
“head”—literally, the top
of the chart.)
Definition
Use the Segno (left) and Coda (right) signs to navigate a piece of music.
Repeating Measures
If you have only a single measure to repeat, you can use a measure repeat sign.
Just insert this sign between the bar lines after the measure you want to repeat;
musicians will know to repeat the previous measure.
Use the measure repeat sign to repeat the contents of the previous measure.
You can use the measure repeat sign in multiple measures. For example, if you
have three measures worth of repeat signs, you play the original measure four
times (the original time plus three repeats).
Repeating Notes
If you’re really lazy, you’ll like the fact that you don’t always have to write each
individual note in a piece of music. If you’re repeating notes of the same rhyth-
mic value and pitch, you can use note repeat notation to spare yourself the trou-
ble of writing down all those eighth or sixteenth notes in a row.

Part 2: Rhythms
Note repeats are indicated by drawing slash notes through the main note. One
slash mark means play two notes in a row; each equal to half the value of the
original note. For example, if you draw a single slash through a quarter note,
you play two eighth notes; a single slash through an eighth note means you play
two sixteenth notes.
Two slash marks means you play four notes in a row; each equal to one quarter
the value of the original note. For example, if you draw a double slash through
a quarter note, you play four sixteenth notes; a double slash through an eighth
note means you play four thirty-second notes. The following table indicates
some common note repeat values.
Note Repeat Markings
Marking
Equals …
86
You can also use
note repeats on dot-
ted notes. When
you put a single
slash on a dotted note,
you play three notes of the
next-higher value; when
you put a double slash on
a dotted note, you play
six notes of the second-
higher value.
Tip
Repeating Rests
There’s one last bit of repeat notation you need to know—and it concerns rest-
ing; not playing. In much orchestral music, each individual instrument spends a
lot of time not playing. While the composer could indicate all this inactivity by

Chapter 7: Tempo, Dynamics, and Navigation
writing lots of individual measures full of whole rests, it is more common (and a
lot easier) to indicate the total number of measures the instrument will rest.
This is done by using a multiple-measure rest sign in a single measure, with a
number written above the rest. The number indicates how many measures of
rest there are. For example, a multiple-measure rest with the number 6 written
above indicates that that instrument is supposed to rest for six measures.
87
Use a multiple-measure rest sign to indicate multiple measures of rest; in this example, six measures.
The Least You Need to Know
◆The tempo of a piece of music can be indicated by traditional Italian
markings or by a specific “beats per minute” instruction.
◆You indicate changes in tempo by using Italian markings such as ritardano
(slow down) and accelerando (speed up).
◆The volume level of a piece of music is typically indicated by the use of
traditional Italian dynamic markings, from pianissimo (pp) to fortissimo (ff).
◆You indicate changes in dynamics by using crescendo (get louder) and
decrescendo (get softer) markings.
◆When you want a single note played louder than normal, use an accent
mark.
◆You navigate an entire piece of music using repeat signs and various Italian
markings. (For example, D.C. al Coda means to go back to the beginning,
play to the Coda sign; then jump to the Coda section.)

◆Discovering what makes a melody memorable
Lesson 5, Track 36
In the first part of this book (Chapters 1 through 4), you learned all about notes
and pitches. In the second part (Chapters 5 through 7), you learned all about
note values and rhythms. By themselves, pitches and rhythms don’t amount to
much. But when you combine them, they create something wonderful—a melody.
Melody is defined as a logical progression of tones and rhythms—a tune set to a
beat. But pay close attention to that word “logical.” A melody isn’t a random
conglomeration of notes; the notes have to relate to and follow from each other.
In other words, a melody has to make sense, or else it’s just a bunch of noise.
That textbook definition of melody, however precise, doesn’t go far enough for
my tastes. To me, a melody is the most memorable part of a piece of music. It’s
the song you sing, the notes you hum, the musical line that stays in your mind
long after the record is over or the band has stopped playing. The best melodies
pack an emotional punch; they make us jump with joy or weep with sadness.
When done right, melodies can tell a story without words, or reinforce the
meaning of a song’s lyrics.
If you want to compose or arrange music—or even improvise to an existing
song—you have to know how to create a memorable melody. That’s where this
chapter comes in—it’s all about the art of melody.
Combining Tones and Rhythms
If you think back to Chapter 1, you’ll remember how we discussed various ways
to describe the tones in the song “Mary Had a Little Lamb.” We finally settled
Chapter

Part 3: Tunes
92
on the traditional labeling of tones using the letters A through G. Each tone in
the song is assigned a letter corresponding to its precise pitch; anyone reading
the letters knows which tone to sing or play.
Assigning tones, of course, is only half the story. When you sing “Mary Had a
Little Lamb,” you give each tone a specific rhythmic value; each tone takes up
a specific place in time. The rhythm of the song is described by using different
note values, the half notes and quarter notes that we call music notation.
By combining the pitch values with the rhythmic values, we can now notate the
entire melody of “Mary Had a Little Lamb.” The notes on the staff tell us what
pitches to sing; the note values tell us how long to sing each pitch.
The result looks like this:
The complete melody for “Mary Had a Little Lamb.”
All melodies are described using similar notation. You set the key signature and
the time signature up front, and then fill in the notes of the melody from there.
Naturally, you have to arrange the notes within measures, with each measure
holding the appropriate number of beats. When you’re done writing down the
notes, you’ve written your melody.
Common Melodic Techniques
Every song—every piece of music—has a melody. Some longer pieces (such as
much orchestral music) have multiple melodies. Some melodies consist of mul-
tiple parts, with different parts repeated in different parts of the song. However
the music is constructed, the melody is the heart of the song—the part you should
be able to sing or hum or whistle all by itself, with no other instruments needed.
To get a feel for how melodies are constructed, let’s take a look at some melodies
from well-known pieces of music. You’ll see that although they all have their
distinct sound and feel, these melodies also have a lot of factors in common.
Dvorˇák’s New World Symphony
We’ll start with a tune from Antonin Dvorˇák’s Symphony #9 in E minor (“From
the New World”)—more popularly known as the New World Symphony. This is a
popular piece of orchestral music, and consists of several different sections; the

Chapter 8: Melodies
melody we’ll look at is just one of many used throughout the work, and it goes
like this:
93
One of the main melodies in Dvorˇák’s New World Symphony.
Let’s first get a feel for the mechanics of the melody. As you can see, the time
signature for this melody is 4/4, so there are four quarter-note beats in each
measure. The key signature is D♭, with five flats. When you listen to it, the
melody has a happy sound, which means it’s in a major key—D♭Major, to be
precise. The piece of the melody we’re looking at is four measures long.
If you look at (or listen to) this melody carefully, you’ll see that it breaks into
two two-measure phrases. The first two measures end on a note (E♭) that doesn’t
feel like an ending note (it’s the second note in the scale); this sets up a kind of
tension that you want to hear resolved. The second two measures resolve the
tension by effectively repeating the first two measures, but ending on a more
satisfying tone—D♭, the tonic of the scale.
This is a common technique, setting up some sort of tension in the first part of
the melody that is then resolved in the second part. This helps to make a melody
interesting; if you think about it, it’s also a very logical, symmetrical, almost
mathematical construction. (If you look at it like a mathematical formula, the
first half of the melody “equals” the second half.)
Another technique used in this melody is the repetition of specific rhythms. Look
at the rhythmic pattern used throughout—dotted eighth note, sixteenth note, and
quarter note. This “dum de duh” pattern is played twice in the first measure,
and twice again in the third measure, establishing a kind of rhythmic signature
for the entire piece. This rhythmic repetition helps to establish a familiarity for
the listener; you hear the rhythm once, then you hear it again, and it feels
familiar; almost comfortable. In fact, a listener expects to hear some repetition; if
every measure of a melody is completely different from all the preceding meas-
ures, the melody will be difficult to remember.
Bach’s Minuet in G
Our next example is Johann Sebastian Bach’s Minuet in G—although you might
be familiar with it as the melody of the pop song “A Lover’s Concerto,” per-
formed by the Toys back in the mid-1960s.
This melody differs from Dvorˇák’s melody in a number of ways. First, it’s in 3/4
time; not 4/4. Second, it’s in the key of G, and is based on the G Major scale.
Beyond those differences, there are a lot of similar techniques in use. Note the
rhythmic repetition between measures 1-2 and 3-4, and the continued repeti-
tion of the first measure in measures 5 through 7. Also note the very slight ten-
sion created in measure 4 (the end of the first half of the melody—it sounds like
there’s more coming), which is then resolved in the second half of the melody.

Part 3: Tunes
There’s something else interesting about this particular melody. The first half of
the melody has an insistent upward motion; the second half uses a downward
motion to deposit you pretty much where you started. Even though not all the
notes go up (or down), the general flow of the melody moves in those direc-
tions, and thus propels the melody forward.
You need to have some sort of motion in a melody, or you’ll put the listener to
sleep. That motion can be in the tune, or in the rhythm, but it needs to be
there, to help the melody get from point a to point b.
Michael, Row the Boat Ashore
Next up is the traditional folk song “Michael, Row the Boat Ashore.” The
words to this tune, simple as they are, can actually help us see the melodic form.
When you read the words, you can clearly see that the song consists of two
near-identical halves—rhythmically, anyway.
The first time Michael rows his boat ashore (hallelujah!), the melody has a
slight upward motion, and ends with a slight bit of tension on the fifth note of
the scale (A). The second time Michael goes boating, the melody sways down-
ward slightly, and resolves itself by ending on the tonic of the key (D).
Symmetry, repetition, tension, and release—these techniques are used over and
over to create memorable melodies.

Pachelbel’s Canon in D
Our final melody is a bit different from the ones we’ve examined so far. It’s dif-
ferent because rhythmically, it’s very simple—nothing but half notes.
You’ve probably heard this melody before—it’s Johann Pachelbel’s Canon in D
(sometimes just called “Pachelbel’s Canon”—like he only wrote this one!) and
it’s been used in a number of different movies and television shows. You might
have even heard it in the background of a commercial for GE light bulbs back
in the 1990s. (They bring good things to light.) In any case, it’s a compelling
melody, despite its rhythmic simplicity.
The very simple melody for Pachelbel’s Canon in D.
This melody also is different in that it doesn’t use a lot of symmetry or repeti-
tion. (Except for the repeated half notes, of course!) It’s actually the stepwise
intervals between the notes that propel this melody forward; each pitch leaning
forward to the next, one after another, almost in a giant spinning circle of
tones. And then the last note, C#, is the leading tone of the scale (D Major);
you jump back to F# (the third of the scale) and start all over again.
The point of examining this particular melody is that you don’t need fancy
rhythms to create a memorable melody. Pure tones, played slowly and simply,
can be quite lyrical—if you pick the right ones!
Composing Your First Melody
Now that you know some of the techniques you can use to create a melody, let’s
put those techniques to work.
As you learned with Pachelbel’s Canon, a melody doesn’t have to include com-
plex rhythms. The right notes on the right pitches are what you need to start
any new tune.
One of the primary rules of composing is to base your melody on a specific
scale. And, as you’ll learn in Chapter 9, there are three notes in a scale which,
when played together, create what we call a major triad. These three notes rep-
resent a good place to start for our first melody.
For simplicity’s sake, let’s start in the key of C, using the C Major scale. The
three notes we want to use are the tonic, the third, and the fifth—C, E, and G.
So let’s start our melody with two half notes and a whole note, starting with C
and progressing up to G on the whole note.
To be fair, the melody illus-
trated in Pachelbel’s Canon
in D is just the first four
measures of a much
longer melody. The musi-
cal form (canon) used in
this piece is like a round,
where the melody starts in
one part and then contin-
ues while other parts start
up with the same melody.
See Chapter 11 to learn
more about the canon
and other musical forms.

Part 3: Tunes
96
This gives us the first two measures of the melody:
The first two measures of our first melody.
Let’s elaborate on these notes a bit. If you want to give the melody a little more
of a flow, you can fill in the blanks between these three notes by adding notes in
the step between each pitch. We’ll do this by turning the half notes into quarter
notes, and adding passing tones between the C and the E, and the E and G.
(That means we’ll go from C to D to E, and from E to F to G.)
The result looks like this:
A passing tone is
a subsidiary tone you have
to pass through to move
from one important note to
another. The passing tone
is not part of the underly-
ing chord structure, but is
often situated between two
of the notes in a triad.
Definition
The first two measures, with passing tones added.
We’re still left with that single whole note sitting there. It’s okay to leave it like
that, but doing so makes this part of our melody sound like nothing more than a
simple major scale—which it actually is! Fortunately, we can choose to add a lit-
tle more interest by using another technique called a neighboring tone, in which
you land on the main note (in this case, the G), slide briefly to an adjacent note,
and then return to rest on the main note (G, again). The result sounds a little
like “doo-de-doo,” which is slightly more interesting than a plain “doo.”
You can place neighboring tones above or below the main tone; for our little
melody, we’ll use the neighboring tone above the G—which happens to be an A.
Keeping the rhythm simple, we’ll now start the second measure with a quarter
note on G; then follow it by a quarter note on A and a half note on G.
The result looks like this:
You create a
neighboring tone by start-
ing on a pitch, moving up
or down by a step (either
half or whole) and then
returning to the original
pitch; the neighboring tone
is the one that “neighbors”
the original note. Like a
passing tone, a neighbor-
ing tone typically is not
one of the three notes in
the underlying chord triad.
Definition
Embellishing the melody with a neighboring tone.
This is a nice little melody—but it’s really only half of a melody. Ending on the
fifth note of the scale, as it does, actually sets up some melodic tension. When
you hear this melody, you want to resolve the tension, and somehow get things
back to where they started—on C.
There’s an easy way to do this, of course. All you have to do is create a sort of mir-
ror image of the first two measures, but with a downward motion from G to C.
The first thing we’ll do is copy the first measure into a new third measure—
except we’ll copy it with the first note starting on G, and with the quarter notes
moving down in a G F E D progression. (Note that this progression puts two of

Chapter 8: Melodies
97
the C Major triad notes—G and E—on the primary beats of the measure: one and
three.) Then we’ll end the run with a whole note in the fourth measure, posi-
tioned on the tonic note: C.
Your completed melody looks like this:
Your completed melody—play it loud and proud!
That wasn’t so difficult, was it? Granted, this melody won’t win any Grammy
awards, but it is a legitimate melody, and it’s quite singable. (Trust me, I’ve heard
worse.) The key thing is that you’ve seen that creating a melody isn’t hard, as long
as you know the basic theory involved.
What Makes a Melody Memorable?
All of this brings us to the key question: How exactly can you create a memorable
melody?
It certainly helps to have a little soul and inspiration, of course, but you also can
employ some very reliable techniques to ensure that you create a melody that works,
and will stick in the listener’s memory after he or she hears it. We’ll go through a
number of these techniques next, with the caveat that these aren’t necessarily “rules”—
it’s possible to do just the opposite of what I recommend and still create a great-
sounding melody. (Which means there must be some art involved, doesn’t it?)
Center on a Pitch
You don’t want your melodies wandering around all over the place, like a dog looking
for a place to do his business. What you want is more of a hunting dog of a melody,
one that knows where home is and, at the end of the day, finds its way back there.
The “home” of your melody needs to be a specific pitch. When you pick a home
pitch, your melody can then revolve around the pitch. You can start on that pitch
(although you don’t have to), and you should end on that pitch. Equally important,
the other notes in the melody can play around that pitch—and even land on it,
occasionally.
Note that your home pitch doesn’t have to be the tonic of the scale. You can make
the third your home, or the fifth—but probably not the second or sixth or seventh,
because they’re less related to the tonic triad of 1-3-5.
For example, listen to the following melody. It’s in the key of G, but revolves
around the home pitch of B—the third of the scale.

Part 3: Tunes
98
A four-measure melody in the key of G, which hovers around the third of the scale (B).
What you want to avoid is having each measure of your melody center around
a different pitch. If your melody wanders around in this type of fashion, with
no central core, you won’t know how to end the melody—you won’t know
where home is.
Make Sure You End Up at Home
Many of the most memorable melodies use the home pitch to lend logic to the
melodic flow. In fact, it’s good if your audience can listen to part of your melody
and, based on the prominence of the home note, hum the end of the melody
before they ever hear it.
When you don’t end your melody on the expected note, you create an unre-
solved tension that can be unsettling to listeners. Although it’s okay to insert
that kind of tension in the middle of your melody, you don’t want to end with
that kind of tension. You want to resolve your melody so that there’s a feeling
of completion at the end.
What you want to avoid is a melody that wanders around aimlessly. Let your
ear be your guide. Play over the melody and see if it holds together. It’s a little
bit like writing a good paragraph or a good stanza of a poem; when you’re fin-
ished, the best thing to do is to read it aloud and see if it really works.
The wrong way to do it—you don’t want to end your melody with unresolved tension.
Stay Within the Scale
When you’re picking the specific notes for your melody, it’s good to pick a par-
ticular scale—and stay within the seven notes of that scale. For example, if you
decide to write in the key of F Major, your melody will include the notes F, G,
A, B♭, C, D, and E. Used properly, none of these notes will sound out of place.
A melody that uses the F Major scale.

Chapter 8: Melodies
Conversely, if you’re writing in F Major and throw a D♭into your melody, that
note will sound out of place. Although it’s possible to use these nonscale (chro-
matic) notes in a melody, it’s probably not something you, as a beginner, should
try. Composing a melody using chromatic notes requires a degree of harmonic
sophistication that seldom comes naturally—although it can be developed with
practice.
By the way, when you choose a scale for your melody, it doesn’t have to be a
major scale. Let’s say we’re still in the key of F, but you want to write a less lively,
more poignant-sounding melody. For this type of melody, you might choose to use
the D minor scale (which uses one flat, as with the key of F). When you write
this type of melody, you’ll probably center on the tonic triad of D minor (D, F,
and A) rather than the tonic triad of F Major (F, A, and C).
Use the Big Five
You can make things even simpler by sticking to five key notes within a given
major scale—the first, second, third, fifth, and sixth of the scale. (In C Major,
these notes are C, D, E, G, and A.)
These notes combine for what is called the pentatonic scale. (The word penta
means five; five tones equal a pentatonic scale.) By using only these five notes,
you avoid the two notes in the scale (the fourth and the seventh) that sometimes
create harmonic tension.
When you use the five notes in the pentatonic scale, it’s virtually impossible to
insert a “wrong” note into your melody. However, you can overuse these notes
and end up with a vaguely Oriental-sounding tune—or even something that
sounds a little bit like the theme to an old cowboy movie!
99
A melody based on the C pentatonic scale.
Find the Hook
For a melody to be truly memorable, there needs to be a piece of your melody
that really reaches out and grabs the listener’s attention. In pop music this is
called the hook, because it’s the part of the song that hooks the listener. In more
traditional music, this piece of the song is sometimes known as the motif (or
motive)—and is repeated throughout the entire piece of music.
A motif is typically fairly short—a few notes (think of the five whistling notes in
Sergio Leone’s theme from the movie The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) or, at
longest, one or two measures. When you hit on a good motif or hook, don’t be
afraid to use it—repeat it as often as you need, throughout your entire song.
Instead of basing
your melody on a
major or minor
scale, you can base
it on one of the modes—
Aeolian, Dorian, Lydian,
and so forth—discussed
back in Chapter 3.
Tip
On a piano, an
easy way to see
and play a penta-
tonic scale is to
play strictly on the black
keys. These five keys—
G♭, A♭, B♭, D♭, and E♭—
comprise the G♭pentatonic
scale.

Create Variations
You can create additional melodies in your music by varying your motif slightly,
such as changing its rhythm or moving its tones up or down in the scale. You
should retain enough of the main motif so that listeners can tell where it came
from, but add enough variation so that you create a new—but related—melody.
How can you vary a motif ? You can reverse the rhythm, simplify the rhythm,
or make the rhythm more complex. You can reverse the notes (so that the
melody goes up instead of down, or down instead of up), or change the middle
notes in the motif, or shift the notes up or down a third or a fifth. In short, just
about any variation is fair game, as long as the initial motif isn’t completely
obliterated by the variations.
Take a look at the following example, in which the simple four-note motif from
the previous example is run through a number of variations—both rhythmically
and melodically.
A simple four-note motif, repeated throughout a longer melody.
The same four-note motif, with variations.
Remember that you want your variations to relate to the original motif. If you
get too far away from the original motif, it isn’t a variation anymore—it’s a
brand-new melody!
Write in Four—or Eight, or Sixteen
When you’re composing a melody, it helps to keep the lengths of the parts of
the melody (the motifs and phrases) relatively simple. In most Western music—
popular music, especially—most melodies can be divisible by two. That means
you probably want your melody to be two, four, eight, or sixteen measures long.
You probably don’t want to write a three- or five-measure melody; writing to an
odd number of measures may feel wrong to some of your listeners.
When you write a longer melody, you can divide it up into two- or four- or
eight-measure chunks. For example, the following sixteen-measure melody is
constructed from four four-measure parts.
One notable exception to
this 2/4/8/16 rule is the
genre we call the blues.
Most blues music uses a
twelve-measure form, with
twelve-measure melodies.
(To learn more about the
blues form, see Chapter
11.)
Note

Make It Move
A good melody doesn’t just sit there; it goes someplace. You can propel a melody
rhythmically, or tonally, through the “motion” of the tones. In this sense, motion
refers to the progressive upward or downward direction of the pitches, or what
some call the contour of a line of music.
A good way to think about the upward or downward motion of a melody is to
look at the starting note and the ending note—while ignoring, for the time
being, all the notes in between. To create an upward-moving melody, make sure
the ending note is at least a third (and ideally a fifth or more) higher than the
starting note. Same thing with a downward-moving melody; force the last note
to be lower than the first one.
All the notes between the first and last notes help you move to that final note.
The notes don’t all have to go in the same direction, but they do have to gradu-
ally move up or down to where you want to end.
A melody with upward motion.
Note that it’s okay to have a melody that starts and ends on the same note.
What you can do is make the midpoint of the melody higher or lower than the
starting/ending pitch. If you choose a higher midpoint, the first half of the
melody will have upward movement, and the last half will use downward
movement to return to the home pitch.
Take Small Steps
The most singable melodies progress in small steps, which means each note is
only a step or two away from the previous note. The smaller the steps between
the notes in your melody, the more lyrical your melody will sound.
When you throw large jumps—of three or more steps—into your melody, it
starts sounding random, and becomes much more difficult to play or sing. It’s
much better to use a series of passing notes within your chosen scale to move
from one main note to another.
A melody that pro-
gresses in half or whole
steps uses what is called
step-wise or conjunct
motion. Melodies that
progress by leaps larger
than a whole step use
what is called skip-wise or
disjunct motion.
Definition

Part 3: Tunes
Obviously, this isn’t a hard-and-fast rule. (And every rule is meant to be broken,
anyway!) Think, for example, of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow,” or “Moon
River,” or “When You Wish Upon a Star.” All of these songs feature leaps of
anywhere from a fifth to an entire octave in their melodies. So it’s okay to leap,
if you know what you’re doing—although small steps are better suited for less-
experienced songwriters.
102
Small steps and large leaps in a melody—the small steps sound more lyrical and are easier to sing.
Stay in Range
You don’t want to cover too many notes in your melody. If the distance between
the lowest note and the highest note is too wide, singers will have trouble
singing all of your melody—and your melody will start to sound random and
disjointed, without a home.
Consider, for example, America’s national anthem, “The Star-Spangled
Banner.” Francis Scott Key put his words to one whopper of a tune—one that
had a rather wide melodic range. Think of how hard this song is to sing—and
how many well-trained vocalists have trouble hitting all the notes. The broad
range in this song doesn’t make it a bad song; it just makes it one of the more
difficult songs to sing or play.
Thus, if at all possible keep the lowest and highest notes in your melody within
an octave of each other. (Or, at most, within an octave and a third.) You should
also consider the absolute range of the voice or instrument you’re writing for,
and try to stay within that range. (To learn more about voice and instrument
ranges, turn to Chapter 19.)
Ironically, the melody of
“The Star-Spangled
Banner” comes from an
English drinking song
called “Anacreon in
Heaven.” Maybe the high
notes are easier to hit after
a few pints of British ale!
Note
A melody with too wide a range—really hard to sing!
Avoid Unsingable Intervals
While we’re on the topic of singability, certain intervals are easier to sing than
others. Half steps and whole steps are easy to sing, as are seconds, thirds, and
fifths. Some fourths, for some reason, are a little more difficult to sing, and
sixths and sevenths are particularly problematic.
Octaves aren’t by nature difficult—a C is a C is a C, whether it’s high or low—
although the shear distance between the notes adds a degree of difficulty for
singers. Along the same lines, any interval over an octave should probably be
avoided, just because it’s such a big jump.

Chapter 8: Melodies
Chromatic intervals—notes that aren’t in the underlying scale—are very diffi-
cult for most singers to sing. For example, if you’re in the key of C and your
melody jumps from an E to a G♭, a lot of singers won’t be able to hit that sec-
ond note. They’ll want to sing either an F or G, both of which are in the scale;
the G♭takes a lot of concentration to hit, out of the blue.
There’s another chromatic interval you should avoid at all costs, called a tritone;
it’s (depending on how you look at it) a raised (augmented) fourth or a flatted
(diminished) fifth. The tritone just plain sounds wrong; some early music theo-
rists considered this the “Devil’s interval,” and the musical equivalent of evil.
(Go ahead, play a tritone—F to B, for example—and see how difficult it is to
sing.)
103
As with all things
musical, the real test
is in the singing.
Whatever intervals
you use, try to sing them,
and then check what you
sing against the piano. If
you have trouble singing a
particular interval, so will
others—and the best melo-
dies are the easiest to sing.
Tip
Don’t put tritones in your melodies!
Keep the Rhythm Simple
At least when you’re starting out, it helps to keep the rhythm of your melody
relative simple. That means sticking to quarter notes and half notes, and using
sixteenth notes sparingly.
It also means avoiding, for the time being, what we call syncopation. Syncopation
makes for a jumpy melody, and is hard for some singers to sing.
Syncopation means there’s an emphasis in a place you’re not expecting
it—or when there isn’t an emphasis where you were expecting it. You
can create a syncopated rhythm by accenting something other than the
downbeat—or by putting a rest on the downbeat. This type of change-up creates
rhythmic patterns that might sound “off” to some listeners but often have kind of a
funky or jazzy feel.
Definition
Syncopated rhythms may be created by using a short rest on the downbeat or
other strong beats. If you find yourself writing a melody that sounds just a little
too “jerky,” consider simplifying the rhythm and using more straight eighth and
quarter notes—on the beat.

Part 3: Tunes
Simplifying a rhythmically complex melody.
Stay in Time
It’s also possible, especially when you’re first starting out, to create a melody that
doesn’t strictly follow the pattern of your chosen time signature. For example,
you could create a six-beat melody, which doesn’t fit well in a four-beat 4/4 world.
104
A melody that doesn’t follow the normal bar-line breaks.
You want to pace your melody so that it fits within your chosen time signature.
That means creating a melody that can easily be divided into measures, without
having extra beats left over. In fact, it’s a good exercise to write out your melody
without bar lines, and then make sure you can easily figure out where to draw
the bars to create your measures. If you can’t easily fit your melody into meas-
ures, think about rephrasing your rhythms, or changing the rest periods between
sections of your melody.
Along the same lines, make sure you can easily tell where the first beat of the
measure is throughout your melody—especially in the first and last measures.
You don’t want your melody to feel “offbeat,” in the strictest sense of the
phrase. You want your melody to end on a beat that feels right; otherwise your
listeners will find themselves stumbling in place when “one” isn’t where it’s sup-
posed to be.
Set Up—and Resolve—Tension
One of the most common melodic techniques is to divide your melody into two
parts, and set up a harmonic tension in the first part that is then resolved in the
second part. This gives your melody a distinct form, and its own internal logic;
it also helps to propel the melody from the first part to the second.
One way to create tension is to end the first part of your melody on something
other than the tonic of the scale. (When you’re factoring in the chord structure—
which you’ll learn in Chapter 10—you’ll find that tension is achieved by ending
the first part of the melody on a IV or V chord.) Practically, you can create ten-
sion by ending a phrase with the second, fifth, or seventh notes of the scale—
which correspond to the notes in the scale’s V chord, if you’re reading ahead.
More-experienced com-
posers are capable of
changing time signatures
within a melody, thus
accommodating lines that
don’t fit within a steady
time signature flow.
Note

Chapter 8: Melodies
The half note in measure two creates tension; the next two bars resolve the tension.
You then have to relieve this tension by manipulating the second part of your
melody back to the tonic of the scale—or to one of the notes in the tonic triad
(the I chord). The notes in the tonic triad are the tonic, third, and fifth of the
scale, although the tonic and the third probably work better for relieving ten-
sion. (That’s because the fifth is an ambiguous note, used both in the I chord
and the V chord; again, read ahead to Chapter 10 to learn all about chord pro-
gressions.)
In any case, you can hear the tension when you play a melody. Just look back to
Dvorˇák’s New World Symphony or “Michael, Row the Boat Ashore.” For that
matter, “Mary Had a Little Lamb” also has this type of internal tension, coming
right after “Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb,” and resolved with
“Mary had a little a lamb, whose fleece was white as snow.”
It’s a popular technique—because it works!
Set Up a Call and Response
Another effective technique to employ in your melodies is that of call and response.
This is where you set up a phrase in the first part of your melody, and then
“answer” that phrase in the second part. This is slightly different from the tech-
nique of tension and release, although the call does set up a certain tension that
demands a tension-relieving answer. The answering phrase serves as a “part
two” to the original phrase; the first phrase takes you in one direction, and the
second phrase brings you back home.
To create a call-and-response type of melody, it helps to think of a question—
and its answer. For example, you might think of the question, “Where is my
car?” and the answer, “It’s in the street.” When you put this call and response to
music, you might get something like this:
105
A simple call-and-response melody.
Establish Symmetry
A technique that is somewhat implied in both the tension-and-relief and call-
and-response techniques is that of symmetry. By this I mean that the second
part of your melody should be somewhat of a mirror image of the first part of
your melody.

Part 3: Tunes
You can achieve this symmetry by mirroring rhythms, or by mirroring tones.
Take Dvorˇák’s New World Symphony, for example. Measure 3 is identical to
measure 1, thus setting up the symmetry between the two parts of the tune.
“Michael, Row the Boat Ashore” has a rhythmic symmetry between the two
parts, even though the tones used change a bit. (Sometimes the tones have to
change, to relieve the harmonic tension or answer a melodic call.)
In any case, when you make the second part of your melody resemble the first
part, you establish a familiarity in the mind and ear of the listener, so they know
(pretty much) what to expect and feel comfortable when you deliver it to them.
106
The last two bars are a near-mirror image of the first two measures.
Balance Repetition and Variety
Repetition is part and parcel of symmetry—and of establishing motifs and hooks.
You find a melodic or rhythmic figure that you like, and you repeat it through-
out the course of the melody or song. This sort of repetition, such as that
shown in the following example, helps to unify your melody; it’s the melodic
equivalent of a steady drumbeat, and serves as an identifying factor for listeners.
However, too much of a good thing can get annoying. If you repeat your figure
too often, it will start to bore the listener. It’s hard to say how much repetition
is too much repetition, but chances are you’ll be able to tell—or your listeners
will tell you.
Songwriter Jimmy Webb, in his book Tunesmith: Inside the Art of Songwriting
(Hyperion, 1998), says that the key to writing interesting melody is “to lead the
ear on a path which is both pleasant and to some degree unexpected.” (Empha-
sis his.) I agree wholeheartedly. The best melodies sound familiar yet still manage
to surprise us somewhere along the line; they do a good job balancing repetition
and variety.
Note
When you find yourself using too much repetition, it’s time to trot out the 
variations—or to add completely new melodic or rhythmic figures. Balancing
repetition and variety is an essential skill to learn, and marks a key difference
between a novice and an experienced composer.
Follow the Chord Progressions
I’ve mentioned chords and chord progressions a few times in this chapter,
because chords and progressions contribute significantly to the melodies you
compose. However, I haven’t presented chords yet, because I feel it’s important

Chapter 8: Melodies
to master a single melodic line before you start stacking multiple notes on top
of each other.
That said, after you’ve read Chapters 9 and 10, you’ll probably want to return
to this chapter and apply what you’ve learned. That’s because one very useful
approach to composing melodies is to come up with a chord progression first,
and then add a melody on top of that. Of course, you can’t do this until you
learn about chords.
After you’ve read Chapters 9 and 10, you’ll better understand how to create—
and resolve—harmonic tension in a melody, using certain chords. For example,
you’ll discover that the most common chord progression is I-IV-V, or some
variation of that. (In the key of C, the chords would be C Major, F Major, and
G Major.) The IV and V chords (the V chord, especially) are used to create ten-
sion; you often end the first part of your melody with the V chord. You resolve
tension by getting back to the I chord, which is the reason you almost always
end your tunes with the I chord. When your melodies follow these chords, you
establish the kind of tension and relief that makes for a memorable melody.
Your melody needs to fit within the chord structure of your song, as you’ll also
learn in Chapter 10. This means that, within a specific measure, the main notes
of your melody probably should fit within the three main notes of the underly-
ing chord. For example, if you have an A minor chord, the main notes of the
melody accompanying that chord should probably be A, C, or E—the three
notes in the chord.
Again, you’ll learn more about chords and progressions in the next two chap-
ters, so be patient—it will all be explained, in due course!
Follow the Form
Most songs follow some sort of established song form. That means that your
melodies should fit within that form, as well.
You’ll learn more about song forms in Chapter 11, but here’s a brief example: A
lot of popular songs are divided into verses and choruses. The verse is the first
melody, which is repeated throughout the song. The chorus is a second melody,
often the main melody (containing the hook), which is played between verses.
So a typical pop music song form might look like this: verse-verse-chorus-verse.
That means you’ll need to write two melodies for the song, which must be
related in some way.
After you read Chapter 11, you should return to this chapter to apply what
you’ve learned about form to your basic melodic skills.
Follow the Words
Another factor that can drive a melody is the presence of lyrics. If you’re writ-
ing an instrumental, of course, you don’t have to worry about following the
words. But if you’re writing a popular song, you have to deal with both music
and words—and how they fit together.
107

Part 3: Tunes
You want your music to fit with your words. In the simplest sense, this means
arranging the rhythm of the music so that it fits the natural rhythm of the words.
You don’t want your singers to be forced into awkward phrasing to fit all the
syllables into a given space. Most words and phrases have a natural pace, and
will suggest a rhythm to you. Make sure your music’s rhythm fits this lyric
rhythm—in particular, avoid putting an unaccented word or syllable on an
accented part of the measure, like the downbeat.
You also want the flow of your melody to match the flow of the words. For
example, if the words ask a question, you probably want the melody to flow
upward, to imitate the way a human voice ends a question on a higher pitch.
In addition, you want the feel of the music to match the feel of the lyrics. If the
lyrics are sad, you probably don’t want to set them to a happy-sounding melody.
There are exceptions to this rule, of course—mismatching words and lyrics can
create a sense of musical irony that is appropriate in some situations—but in
general, you want your melody to reflect the feel of the lyrics, even when
played without vocals.
Write for a Specific Instrument or Voice
The type of melody you compose might be dictated by the specific voices or
instruments you’re writing for. For example, if you’re writing for flutes, you
probably don’t want to create a booming, bombastic melody—they won’t be
able to play it. By the same token, too high a melody will be difficult for low
male voices to sing. You need to find not only the right range for a given voice
or instrument, but also the right feel. Match the requirements of your melody
with the right voices and instruments to avoid an unpleasant listening experience.
Be Unique
Finally, you should know that a melody doesn’t have to be harmonically or
rhythmically complex to be memorable; it doesn’t have to be long or short or any
certain length. It does, however, have to be distinctive. A memorable melody
might remind us of other melodies, but it can’t duplicate them. The best melodies
have something unique about them, some distinctive hook or motif or rhythmic
pattern that makes them stand out.
It’s difficult (if not impossible) to teach you how to be unique, so this is some-
thing you’ll have to address on your own. Does your melody stand on its own?
Does it sound a little like something else you’ve heard? Does it sound a lot like
something else you’ve heard? As with many aspects of composition, this is one
area in which you’ll have to trust your ears—and one that you definitely have to
listen for.
Learn More About Composing
Writing your own music is fun, but it requires mastery of many musical skills—
of which we’ve only covered a few in this chapter. Whether you want to write
songs or symphonies, the same techniques of composition apply. You have to

The Least You Need to Know
◆A melody consists of a logical progression of tones and rhythms.
◆Melodies typically follow a two-, four-, eight-, or sixteen-measure form.
◆Melodies typically conform to a specific scale or mode.
◆The best melodies are often the simplest—in terms of both tune and
rhythm.
◆Longer melodies can typically be divided into two parts, with the end of
the first part creating a tension that is resolved in the second part.
◆You should make sure that your melodies are truly singable—and the only
way to do this is to see if you can sing them!

Lesson 6, Track 41
More often than not, music is more than a single melodic line. Music is a package
of tones, rhythms, and underlying harmonic structure. The melody fits within
this harmonic structure, is dependent on this harmonic structure, and in some
cases dictates the harmonic structure.
The harmonic structure of a piece of music is defined by a series of chords. A
chord is a group of notes played simultaneously, rather than sequentially (like a
melody). The relationships between the notes—the intervals within the chord—
define the type of chord; the placement of the chord within the underlying key
or scale defines the role of the chord.
This chapter is all about chords—and it’s a long one, because there are many,
many different types of chords. Don’t let all the various permutations scare you
off, however; at the core, a chord is nothing more than single notes (typically
separated by thirds) played together.
It’s as simple as that. If you can play three notes at the same time, you can play
a chord.
This chapter, then, shows you how to construct many different types of chords,
with a particular emphasis on the type of harmonic structure you find in popular
music. (This is important; the study of harmony in classical music is much more
involved, with a slightly different set of rules.) And, when you’re done reading this
chapter, you can find a “cheat sheet” to all the different chords in Appendix B.
This appendix is a quick yet comprehensive reference to every kind of chord
imaginable—in every key!
Chapter

Part 3: Tunes
112
Forming a Chord
Okay, here’s the formal definition: A chord is a combination of three or more
notes played together.
Let’s do a little exercise: Sit down at the nearest piano and put your right thumb
on one of the white keys. (It doesn’t matter which one.) Now skip a key and
put another finger on the third key. Skip another key and put a third finger on
the fifth key. You should now be pressing three keys, with an empty key between
each finger. Press down and listen to the music—you’re playing a chord!
Basic chords consist of just three notes, arranged in thirds, called a triad. The
most common triads are constructed from notes plucked from the underlying
scale, each note two steps above the previous note. So, for example, if you want
to base a chord on the tonic of a scale, you’d use the first, third, and fifth notes
of the scale. (Using the C Major scale, these notes would be C, E, and G.) If
you want to base a chord on the second degree of a scale, use the second,
fourth, and sixth notes of the scale. (Still using the C Major scale, these notes
would be D, F, and A.)
Building a three-note triad.
Within a specific chord, the first note is called the root—even if the chord isn’t
formed from the root of the scale. The other notes of the chord are named rel-
ative to the first note, typically being the third and the fifth above the chord’s
root. (For example, if C is the chord’s root, E is called the third and G is called
the fifth.) This is sometimes notated 1-3-5.
Different Types of Chords
Let’s go back to the piano. Putting your fingers on every other white note, form
a chord starting on middle C. (Your fingers should be on the keys C, E, and G.)
Nice sounding chord, isn’t it? Now move your fingers one key to the right, so
that you’re starting on D. (Your fingers should now be on the keys D, F, and A.)
This chord sounds different—kind of sad, compared to the happier C chord.
You’ve just demonstrated the difference between major and minor chords. The
first chord you played was a major chord: C Major. The second chord was a
minor chord—D minor. As with major and minor scales, major and minor
chords sound different to the listener, because the intervals in the chords are
slightly different.
The notes of a chord don’t
always have to be played
in unison. You can play
the notes one at a time,
starting (usually, but not
always) with the bottom
note. This is called arpeg-
giating the chord, and the
result is an arpeggio.
Note
You should always
spell a triad using every
other letter. So D♭-F-A♭is a
correct spelling (for a D♭
Major chord), but the en-
harmonic spelling of C♯-F-A♭
is wrong
Warning

Chapter 9: Chords
113
In most cases, the type of chord is determined by the middle note—the third.
When the interval between the first note and the second note is a major third—
two whole steps—you have a major chord. When the interval between the first
note and the second note is a minor third—three half steps—you have a minor
chord.
It’s no more complex than that. If you change the middle note, you change the
chord from major to minor.
Read on to learn all about major and minor chords—as well as some other types
of chords that aren’t quite major and aren’t quite minor.
Major Chords
A major chord consists of a root, a major third, and a perfect fifth. For example,
the C Major chord includes the notes C, E, and G. The E is a major third
above the C; the G is a perfect fifth above the C.
Here’s a quick look at how to build major chords on every note of the scale:
Major triads.

shown in the following table:

In addition, just printing the letter of the chord (using a capital letter) indicates
that the chord is major. (So if you see C in a score, you know to play a C Major
chord.)

Part 3: Tunes
Minor Chords
The main difference between a major chord and a minor chord is the third.
Although a major chord utilizes a major third, a minor chord flattens that inter-
val to create a minor third. The fifth is the same.
In other words, a minor chord consists of a root, a minor third, and a perfect
fifth. This is sometimes notated 1-♭3-5. For example, the C minor chord
includes the notes C, E♭, and G.

major scale or key,
that chord is always a

chord is C Major.

Diminished Chords
A diminished chord is like a minor chord with a lowered fifth. It has a kind of
eerie and ominous sound. You build a diminished chord with a root note, a minor
third, and a diminished (lowered) fifth. This is sometimes noted 1-♭3-♭5.
For example, the C diminished chord includes the notes C, E♭, and G♭.

Augmented Chords
An augmented chord is like a major chord with a raised fifth; thus an augmented
chord consists of a root, a major third, and an augmented (raised) fifth. This is
sometimes notated 1-3-♯5.
For example, the C augmented chord includes the notes C, E, and G♯.
Here’s a quick look at how to build augmented chords on every note of the
scale:
While it’s important to learn about diminished and augmented chords, you won’t
run into too many of them, especially in popular music. If you base the root of
your chord on the notes of a major scale, as you’ll learn in Chapter 10, only 
the seventh degree triad forms a diminished chord. (Triads based on the other
degrees of the scale form major or minor chords.) There is no augmented chord
found on any degree of the major scale.

Chord Extensions
Chords can include more than three notes. When you get above the basic triad,
the other notes you add to a chord are called extensions.
Chord extensions are typically added in thirds; so the first type of extended chord
is called a seventh chord because the seventh is a third above the fifth. Next up
would be the ninth chord, which adds a third above the seventh … and so on.
Chord extensions are nice to know, but you can simplify most pieces of music
to work with just the basic triads. The extended notes add more color or flavor
to the sound, kind of like a musical seasoning. Like a good meal, what’s impor-
tant is what’s underneath—and you can always do without the seasoning.
So if you see a piece of music with lots of seventh and ninth chords, don’t panic—
you can probably play the music without the extensions and still have things
sound okay. Of course, for the full experience, you want to play the extended
chords as written. But remember, the basic harmonic structure comes from the
base triads; not from the extensions.
That said, it helps to have a full understanding of extended chords, just as a
good chef must have a full understanding of all the different seasonings at his or
her disposal. That means you need to know how to build extended chords—so
you can throw them into the mix when necessary.
Sevenths
The seventh chord is the most common chord extension—in fact, it’s so com-
mon that some music theorists categorize it as a basic chord type, not as an
extension. In any case, you need to be as familiar with seventh chords as you are
with triads. They’re that important.
Creating a seventh chord within a specific key or scale is normally as simple as
adding another third on top of the fifth of the base triad. This gives you a 1-3-
5-7 structure—the equivalent of playing every other note in the scale.
There are actually three basic types of seventh chords: major, minor, and domi-
nant. Major and minor seventh chords are kind of sweet sounding; the domi-
nant seventh chord has its own internal tension.
Dominant Sevenths
The dominant seventh chord—sometimes just called the “seventh” chord, with
no other designation—takes a major triad and adds a minor seventh on top. In
other words, it’s a major chord with a lowered seventh; the chord itself consists
of a root, major third, perfect fifth, and minor seventh. This is sometimes
notated 1-3-5-♭7.
For example, a C7 chord includes the notes C, E, G, and B♭.
The dominant seventh chord is an especially important—and frequently used—
extension, as this is what you get if you play a seventh chord based on the fifth
(dominant) tone of a major scale. As you’ll learn in Chapter 10, the dominant

Chapter 9: Chords
117
chord is frequently used to set up the tension leading back to the tonic chord;
when you add a seventh to the dominant triad (with its mix of major triad and
minor seventh), you introduce even more tension to the music. Here’s a quick
look at how to build dominant seventh chords on every note of the scale:
Dominant seventh chords.
There’s really only one way to notate a dominant seventh chord: by placing a sin-
gle 7 after the name of the chord. For example, you notate a C dominant seventh
chord like this: C7.
Major Sevenths
The major seventh chord takes a standard major chord and adds a major seventh
on top of the existing three notes. This gives you a chord consisting of a root,
major third, perfect fifth, and major seventh. For example, a C Major 7 chord
includes the notes C, E, G, and B.
Here’s a quick look at how to build major seventh chords on every note of the scale:

Other Sevenths
When I said there were three basic types of seventh chords, I left the door open
for other types of less frequently used seventh chords. Indeed, you can stick
either a minor or a major seventh on top of any type of triad—major, minor,
augmented, or diminished—to create different types of seventh chords.
For example, a major seventh stuck on top of a minor triad creates a “minor
major seventh” chord. (That is, the base chord is minor, but the seventh is
major.) This is notated 1-♭3-5-7; a C minor Major 7 chord would include the
notes C, E♭, G, and B (natural).
Other types of seventh chords.
A minor seventh on top of a diminished triad creates a diminished seventh
chord, like this: 1-♭3-♭5-♭7. (This is the chord you get if you play a seventh
chord based on the seventh tone of a major key.) A minor seventh on top of an
augmented triad creates an augmented seventh chord, like this: 1-3-♯5-♭7. A
major seventh on top of an augmented triad creates a major seventh chord with
a raised fifth (♯5), like this: 1-3-♯5-7 … and so on.

Chapter 9: Chords
Other Extensions
While the seventh chord is almost as common as an unadorned triad, other
chord extensions are less widely used. That doesn’t mean you don’t need to
bother with them; when used properly, sixths and ninths and other extended
chords can add a lot to a piece of music.
Let’s look, then, at the other extensions you can use to spice up your basic chords.
Sixths
I said previously that all chords are based on notes a third apart from each other.
There’s an important exception to that rule: the sixth chord. With a sixth chord
(sometimes called an added sixth chord), you start with a basic triad; then add an
extra note a second above the fifth—or a sixth above the root. You can have
major sixth and minor sixth chords, as well as sixths above diminished and aug-
mented triads, as shown in the following figure:
119
Different types of sixth chords.
Later in this chapter you’ll learn about chord inversions, where the order of the
notes in a chord is changed. Interestingly, a sixth chord can be viewed as noth-
ing more than the first inversion of a seventh chord.
For example, the C Major 6 chord (C E G A) contains the same notes as the A
minor 7 chord (A C E G), just in a different order. For that reason, you sometimes
might see sixth chords notated as seventh chords with a separate note (the third)
in the bass. (C Major 6 could be notated like this: Am7/C.) This is a little
advanced—come back to this sidebar after you’ve read the section on inversions.
It’ll make sense then.
Note
Ninths
A ninth chord adds another third on top of the four notes in the seventh chord.
That makes for five individual notes; each a third apart. You can have ninth chords
based on both major and minor triads, with both major and minor sevenths.
Here’s just a smattering of the different types of ninth chords you can build:
When you get up to the
ninth chord, you assume
that the chord includes
both the underlying triad
and the seventh.
Note
Different types of ninth chords.

Part 3: Tunes
120
Seventh, ninth, and eleventh chords see frequent use in modern jazz music,
which often employs sophisticated harmonic concepts.
Elevenths … and Beyond
An eleventh chord adds another note a third above the ninth, for six notes total:
1-3-5-7-9-11. You can set an eleventh on top of any type of triad, along with all
sorts of seventh and ninth variations—although the most common eleventh
chord always uses the unchanged note from within the underlying key or scale.
As with the ninth chord, you have to make a few assumptions with the eleventh
chord. You have to assume the underlying triad, of course, but you also have to
assume the presence of both the seventh and the ninth.
Different types of eleventh chords.
Above the eleventh, it’s possible to construct both thirteenth and fifteenth
chords. Just keep adding more notes; each a third above the last.
By the way, the fifteenth chord is pretty much the highest you’ll find, because
the new note for the next chord up—the seventeenth chord—is exactly two
octaves up from the chord root. There’s no point in calling it a new chord when
all you’re doing is doubling the root note.
Altered, Suspended, and Power Chords
To ensure that you have a comprehensive background in chord theory, there are
three other chord types you need to know about. These are variations on the
basic chord types that crop up from time to time—and can help you notate
more complex musical sounds.
Altered Chords
When you get into seventh and ninth and eleventh chords, you run into the pos-
sibility of a lot of different variations. It’s math again; the more notes in a chord,
the more possible combinations of flats and sharps and such you can create.
This is why we have something called altered chords. Altered chords take stan-
dard, easy-to-understand chords and alter them. The alteration—a lowered
fifth, perhaps, or maybe an added ninth—is typically notated in parentheses,
after the main chord notation.
For example, let’s say you wanted to write a C Major seventh chord, but with a
lowered fifth. (I know … that’s a really weird-sounding combination.) To notate
this, you start with the basic chord—CM7—and add the alteration in parenthe-
ses, like this: CM7(♭5). Anyone reading this chord knows to start with the basic
chord, then make the alteration shown within the parentheses.

Chapter 9: Chords
121
Another example: Let’s say you have a C minor chord and want to add the ninth
but without adding the seventh. Now, if you wanted to include the seventh,
you’d have a Cm9 chord, which is relatively standard. But to leave out the sev-
enth takes a bit more planning. Again, you start with the underlying triad—in
this case, Cm—and make the alteration within parentheses, like this: Cm(add9).
Anyone reading this chord knows to play a C minor triad and then add the
ninth—not to play a standard Cm9 chord.
The difference between a ninth chord and a triad with an added ninth.
There are an endless number of possibilities you can use when working with
altered chords. You can even include more than one variation per chord—all
you have to do is keep adding the variations onto the end of the chord notation.
Just remember to start with the base chord and make your alterations as clear as
possible. (And, if all else fails, you can write out the notes of the chord on a
staff—just to make sure everybody understands.)
Suspended Chords
We’re so used to hearing a chord as a 1-3-5 triad that any change to this
arrangement really stands out like a sore thumb to our ears. (Not that you
should put your thumbs in your ears, but you know what I mean …) This is
what makes a suspended chord so powerful, especially when used properly.
A suspended chord temporarily moves the normal major third of a major chord
up a half step to a perfect fourth. This suspension of the second note of the
triad is so wrong to our ears, we want to hear the suspension resolved by mov-
ing the second note down from the fourth to the third—as quickly as possible.
For example, a C suspended chord includes the notes C F G—instead of the C
E G of C Major. This sets up an incredible tension, as the fourth (F) sounds
really out of place; your ears want the F to move down to the E to create the
more soothing C Major triad.
In fact, most often you do resolve suspended chords—especially at the end of a
musical phrase. You can use the suspended chord to set up the desired end-of-
phrase tension, but then quickly resolve the suspended chord to the normal
major chord, like this:
Added notes can
be notated by the
word “add” plus
the number, or just
the number—within paren-
theses, of course.
Tip
Resolving a suspended chord—the F in the first chord drops down to the E in the final chord.
As you can see from the
example, you notate a
suspended chord with the
phrase “sus4”—or, more
simply, “sus.”
Note

Part 3: Tunes
122
The resolution from the perfect fourth to the major third is just a half-step
movement, but that little half step makes a world of difference; until you make
the move, you’re sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for that incredible
tension to resolve.
Power Chords
If you want a really simple chord, one with a lot of raw power, you can play just
the root and the fifth—leaving out the third. This type of chord is called a power
chord; it is noted by adding a “5” after the chord note. (For example, a G power
chord is notated G5, and includes only the notes G and D.) Power chords are
used a lot in certain types of popular music, in particular the hard rock and
heavy metal genres. 
Here’s one bad thing about power chords: If you use a bunch of them in a row,
you create something called parallel fifths. As you’ll learn in Chapter 14, parallel
fifths are frowned upon, especially in classical music theory. So use power chords
sparingly and—if at all possible—not consecutively.
Power chords, up and down the scale.
Inverting the Order
Although it’s easiest to understand a chord when the root is on the bottom and
the fifth is on the top, you don’t have to play the notes in precisely this order.
Chords can be inverted so that the root isn’t the lowest note, which can give a
chord a slightly different sound. (It can also make a chord easier to play on a
piano, when you’re moving your fingers from chord to chord; inversions help
to group the notes from adjacent chords closer together.)
When you rearrange the notes of a chord so that the third is on the bottom 
(3-5-1), you form what is called the first inversion. (Using a C Major chord as an
example, the first inversion is arranged E G C.) The second inversion is where you
put the fifth of the chord on the bottom, followed by the root and third (5-1-3).
(Again using C Major as an example, the second inversion is arranged G C E.)
The standard triad form, with the root on the bottom, is called the root inversion.
In classical music theory, a
power chord is called an
open fifth, and is techni-
cally an interval, not a
chord.
Note
The first and second inversions of a C Major chord.

Chapter 9: Chords
If you’re working with extended chords, there are more than two possible inver-
sions. For example, the third inversion of a seventh chord puts the seventh in
the bass; the fourth inversion of a ninth chord puts the ninth in the bass.
The particular order of a chord’s notes is also referred to as that chord’s voicing.
You can specify a voicing without writing all the notes by adding a bass note to
the standard chord notation. You do this by adding a slash after the chord nota-
tion, and then the name of the note that should be played on the bottom of the
chord.
For example, if you want to indicate a first inversion of a C Major chord (nor-
mally C E G, but E G C in the first inversion), you’d write this: C/E. This tells
the musician to play a C Major chord, but to put an E in the bass—which just
happens to be the first inversion of the chord. If you wanted to indicate a sec-
ond inversion (G C E), you’d write this: C/G. This tells the musician to play a
C Major chord with a G in the bass.
You can use this notation to indicate other, nonchord notes to be played in the
bass part. For example, Am7/D tells the musician to play an A minor seventh
chord, but to add a D in the bass—a note that doesn’t exist within the A minor
seventh chord proper.
123
Don’t confuse the
chord/bass notation with
the similar        (like a 
fraction with a horizontal
divider, as opposed to 
the chord/bass diagonal
slash). The        notation
tells a musician—typically
a pianist—to play one
chord over another. For
example, if you see     , 
you should play a Cm
chord with your right hand,
and a Dm chord with your
left.

Adding Chords to Your Music
When you want to indicate a chord in your written music, you add the chord
symbol above the staff, like this:
Write the chord symbol above the staff.
The chord applies in the music until you insert another chord. Then the new
chord applies—until the next chord change. For example, in the following piece
of music you’d play a C Major chord in measure 1, an F Major chord in meas-
ure 2, a C Major chord in the first half of measure 3, a G7 chord in the second
half of measure 3, and a C Major chord in measure 4.

If you’re writing a part for guitar, or for a rhythm section (bass, piano, and so
forth) in a pop or jazz band, you don’t have to write out specific notes on the
staff. A guitarist will know to strum the indicated chords, a piano player will
know to comp through the chord progressions, and the bass player will know to
play the root of the chord.
You write a comp part by using slashes in place of traditional notes on the staff.
Typically, you use one slash per beat, so a measure of 4/4 will have four slashes,
like this:
Comping is a
technique used by jazz
and pop musicians to play
an improvised accompani-
ment behind a particular
piece of music. A piano
player might comp by
playing block or arpeg-
giated chords; a guitarist
might comp by strumming
the indicated chords.
Definition
Writing chords for a rhythm section.
You can indicate specific rhythms that should be played by writing out the rhythm,
but with slashes instead of note heads. The result looks something like this:
Indicating a specific rhythm for the chord accompaniment.
If you’re writing specifically for guitar, you also have the option of including
guitar tablature. Tablature shows the guitarist how to fret the chord, and is very
useful for beginning-level players. More advanced players probably don’t need
this assistance, unless you’re indicating a particularly complex chord.
A guitar part with tabla-
ture is sometimes called a
guitar tab.
Note
A guitar part with tablature added.

The Complete Idiot’s Chord Reference
If you flip back to Appendix B of this book, you’ll find “The Complete Idiot’s
Chord Reference.” This is a comprehensive reference to just about every kind of
chord you can think of—major chords, minor chords, extensions, you name it.
You’ll find out how to construct each chord, learn the guitar tablature, and dis-
cover alternate ways to describe the chord. Keep this appendix bookmarked—
you’ll get a lot of use out of it!
The Least You Need to Know
◆A chord consists of three or more notes (called a triad) played simultaneously—
with each note typically a third above the previous note.
◆A major chord includes the root note, a major third, and a perfect fifth.
◆A minor chord includes the root note, a minor third, and a perfect fifth.
◆Extensions above the basic triad are typically added in thirds, and can be
either major or minor.
◆A minor seventh chord is a minor triad with a minor seventh; a major sev-
enth chord is a major triad with a major seventh; a dominant seventh chord
is a major triad with a minor seventh.
◆When you play a chord with a note other than the root in the bass, you’re
playing a chord inversion.
◆When you write for guitar, piano, or bass, you don’t have to write out all the
notes; all you have to do is specify the chord, along with rhythmic slashes on
the staff.

Chord Progressions
In This Chapter
◆Understanding scale-based chords
◆Learning the rules of chord leading
◆Figuring out how to end a progression
◆Discovering the most common chord progressions
◆Fitting chords to a melody—and a melody to a chord progression
In Chapter 9, you learned how to group notes together to form chords. Individual
chords alone are interesting, but they become really useful when you string them
together to form a succession of chords—what we call a chord progression. These
chord progressions provide the harmonic underpinning of a song, “fattening
out” the melody and propelling the music forward.
Of course, to create a chord progression that sounds natural, you can’t just
string a bunch of chords together willy-nilly. Certain chords naturally lead to
other chords; certain chords perform distinct functions within a song. You have
to use your chords properly, and arrange them in the right order, to create a
piece of music that sounds both natural and logical.
Chord progressions don’t have to be complex, either. The simplest progressions
include just two or three chords—which are easy enough for any beginning gui-
tarist to play. How many songs, after all, do you know that use only the G, C,
and D chords? (A lot, I bet.) Those three chords comprise one of the most
common chord progressions—which should show you how easy all this is.
Chords for Each Note in the Scale
To better understand the theory behind chord progressions, you need to under-
stand that you can create a three-note chord based on any of the seven notes of
a major key or scale. You start with the note of the scale (one through seven) as
the root of the chord; then build up from there in thirds—using only the notes
within the scale.
Chapter

Part 3: Tunes
128
Let’s use the key of C as an example, because it’s made up of only the white
keys on a piano. When you play a triad based on C (the tonic of the scale), you
play C E G—a C Major chord. Now move up one key, and play the next
triad—D F A, or D minor. Move up another key, and you play E G B, the E
minor chord. Move up yet another key, and you play F A C—F Major. Keep
moving up the scale and you play G Major, A minor, and B diminished. Then
you’re back on C, and ready to start all over again.
This type of chord building based on the notes of a scale is important, because
we use the position within a scale to describe the individual chords in our
chord progressions. In particular, we use Roman numerals (I through VII) to
describe where each chord falls in the underlying scale. Uppercase Roman
numerals are used for major chords; lowercase Roman numerals are used for
minor chords. To indicate a diminished chord, you use the lowercase Roman
numeral plus a small circle. To indicate an augmented chord, use the uppercase
Roman numeral plus a small plus sign.
Thus, within a major scale, the seven chords are notated as follows:
I
ii
iii
IV
V
vi
vii°
If you remember back to Chapter 2, each degree of the scale has a particular
name—tonic, dominant, and so on. We can assign these names to the different
chords, like this:
I
ii
iii
IV
V
vi
vii°
Tonic
Supertonic
Mediant
Subdominant
Dominant
Submediant
Leading Tone
Of these chords, the primary chords—the ones with the most weight—are the I, IV,
and V. These also are the only major chords in the major scale—and often the
only chords used within a song.
When describing chord progressions, we’ll refer to chords by either their
Roman numerals or their theoretical names (tonic, dominant, and so forth).
You can figure out which specific chords (C Major, D minor, and so forth) to
play, based on the designated key signature.
To make things easier, you can refer to the following table, which lists the
seven scale-based chords for each major key signature.

Creating a Progression
Let’s see how you can use these Roman numerals to create a chord progression.
For the time being we won’t pay attention to the underlying harmonic theory;
we’ll just concentrate on the mechanics of creating a progression.
I mentioned earlier the popularity of the G, C, and D chords. In the key of G
Major, these chords happen to fall on the first (G), fourth (C), and fifth (d)
notes of the scale. This makes these the I, IV, and V chords—or, more techni-
cally, the tonic, subdominant, and dominant.
If you’ve ever played any folk songs, you know that one of the more common
chord progressions goes like this:
G / / /
C / / /
G / / /
D / / /
(Naturally, the progression repeats—or ends with a final G chord.)
Because you know that the G = I, C = IV, and D = V, it’s easy to figure out the
Roman numeral notation. It looks like this:
I
IV
I
V
There—you’ve just written your first chord progression!
The benefit of using this type of notation is you can apply the chord progres-
sion to other keys. Let’s say you want to play this I-IV-I-V progression in the
key of C. Referring back to the Scale-Based Chords table earlier in this chapter,
you can translate the progression to these specific chords:
C / / /
F / / /
C / / /
G / / /
This definitely makes things simpler.
It’s All About Getting Home
The goal of most major chord progressions is to get back to the home chord—
the tonic chord, or I. All the other chords in the progression exist as part of a
roadmap to deliver you back to the I chord. The route can be simple (just a
chord or two) or complex (lots and lots of different chords), but ultimately you
want to end up back on I.

These examples use slash
notation, where each
slash (/) equals one beat.
Measures are separated
by spaces.

Chapter 10: Chord Progressions
131
If you’re playing in a minor key, you want to end up on the home of that key—
which is the vi chord of the relative major scale.
As you’ll learn in the next section, certain chords naturally lead to the I key. In
addition, you can employ multiple-chord progressions to get you back to I—
these are called cadences and are also discussed later in this chapter.
One Good Chord Leads to Another
Although you can write a song using any combination of chords that sounds
good to your ears—even chords from other keys—in most cases chord progres-
sions are based on a few simple rules. These rules come from a concept called
chord leading, which says that certain chords naturally lead to other chords.
You can hear chord leading for yourself by playing some chords on the piano.
To keep it simple, we’ll stay in the key of C—so you don’t have to play any of
the black keys.
Start by playing a C Major chord (C-E-G). This is the I chord, which doesn’t
necessarily lead anywhere because, based on chord leading rules, the I chord can
be followed by any chord in the scale.
Now play a G Major chord (G-B-D). This is the V chord in the scale, and it defi-
nitely wants to go somewhere. But where? You could follow it with an F Major
chord (F-A-C), but that isn’t fully satisfying. Neither is D minor (D-F-A) or E
minor (E-G-B) or even A minor (A-C-E). The only chord that sounds fully 
satisfying—the chord that V naturally leads to—is the I chord, C Major.
The rule here is that the V chord naturally leads back to the I chord. Although you
can write another chord after a V, the best resolution is to follow the V with the I.
Other chords also have related chords that they naturally lead to. Some chords
can even lead to more than one chord. To learn which chords lead where, take a
look at the following table.
Chord Leading Reference

Any chord

IV, V, vii°
iii
ii, IV, vi
IV
I, iii, V, vii°

Although there are exceptions to these rules, you can create a pleasing chord
progression by following the order suggested by this chart. This means if you
have a iii chord, you follow it with either a ii, IV, or a vi chord. Or if you have a
vi chord, you follow it with either a ii, IV, V, or I chord … and so on.
Technically, the vi chord of
the major scale is actually
the i chord of the relative
natural minor scale—if you
recall the relationship
between major and minor
keys, presented back in
Chapter 4.

Part 3: Tunes
132
Let’s put together some of these combinations. We’ll start, of course, with the I
chord. Because I leads to any chord, let’s go up one scale note and insert the ii
chord after the I. According to our chart, ii can lead to either IV, V, or vii°. We’ll
pick V. Then, because V always leads to I, the next chord is a return to the tonic.
The entire progression looks like this:
I
ii
V
I
When you play this progression in the key of C, you get the following chords:
C / / /
Dm / / /
G / / /
C / / /
Sounds good, doesn’t it?
Let’s try another example. Again, we’ll start with the tonic, but this time we’ll
use the vi chord as the second chord. According to the chart, vi can lead to
either ii, IV, V, or I; let’s pick IV. Then, because IV can lead to either I, iii, V, or
vii°, we’ll pick V as the next chord—which leads us back to I as our final chord.
The entire progression looks like this:
I
vi
IV
V
I
When you play this progression in the key of C, you get the following chords:
C / / /
Am / / /
F / / /
G / / /
C / / /
You should recognize that progression as the chords that drove thousands of
doo-wop tunes in the 1950s and 1960s.
Let’s return to that progression, and make an alternate choice for the third
chord—ii instead of IV. Because ii also leads to V, we can leave the rest of the
progression intact, which creates the following alternate progression:
I
vi
ii
V
I
This, when played in the key of C, results in these chords:
C / / /
Am / / /
Dm / / /
G / / /
C / / /
When you’re playing a chord progression, the number of beats or
measures allotted to each chord isn’t set in stone. For example, you
could play the I-IV-V progression with a single measure for each chord.
Or you could play two measures of I, and a measure each of IV and V.
Or you could play three measures of one, and then two beats each of IV and V.
It all depends on the needs of the song—and helps provide an almost infinite
variety of possible chord combinations.
Tip
You can also work backward from where you want to end up—your final chord.
Because in most cases you want the final chord to be the tonic (I), all you have
to do is work through the options that lead to that chord. Consulting the Chord
Leading Reference table, you find that four chords can lead to the I: IV, V, vi,

Chapter 10: Chord Progressions
133
and vii°. The obvious choice is the V chord, so that’s what we’ll use. Now we have
to pick a chord to lead to V; the choices are ii, IV, vi, and I. Let’s pick ii. Now we
pick a chord that leads to the ii; the choices are I, iii, IV, and vi. Let’s pick iii. Now
we pick a chord that leads to the iii; the choices are I, IV, and vii°. Let’s pick I,
which is also a good chord with which to start our phrase. When you put all these
chords together, you get the following progression:
I
iii
ii
V
I
Play this progression in the key of C, and you use these chords:
C / / /
Em / / /
Dm / / /
G / / /
C / / /
Pretty easy, isn’t it?
Ending a Phrase
When you come to the end of a musical phrase—which can be anywhere in your song,
even in the middle of your melody—you use chords to set up a tension, and then
relieve that tension. This feeling of a natural ending is called cadence, and there are
some accepted chord progressions you can use to provide this feeling of completion.
Perfect Cadence
The most common phrase-ending chord progression uses the V (dominant)
chord to set up the tension, which is relieved when you move on to the I (tonic)
chord. This progression is notated V-I, and in the key of C looks like this:
G / / /
C / / /
You could probably see this cadence coming, from the chord leading shown in
the table named Chord Leading Reference earlier in this chapter. There’s no
better way to get back home (I) than through the dominant chord (V).
Plagal Cadence
A slightly weaker ending progression uses the IV (subdominant) chord in place of
the V chord. This IV-I progression is called a plagal cadence; in the key of C, it
looks like this:
F / / /
C / / /
Although this is an effective cadence, it isn’t nearly as strong as the perfect V-I
cadence. For that reason, you might want to use a plagal cadence in the middle of
your song or melody, and save the stronger perfect cadence for the big ending.
Imperfect Cadence
Sometimes, especially in the middle of a melody, you might want to end on a chord
that isn’t the tonic. In these instances, you’re setting up an unresolved tension, typi-
cally by ending on the V (dominant) triad.
The V-I progression
can be enhanced
by using the domi-
nant seventh chord
(V7) instead of the straight
V. This progression is
notated V7-I.
Tip

Part 3: Tunes
134
This type of ending progression is called an imperfect cadence, and you can get to
the V chord any number of ways—I-V, ii-V, IV-V, and vi-V being the most
common. In the key of C, these progressions look like this:
I-V:
C / / /
G / / /
ii-V:
Dm / / /
G / / /
IV-V:
F / / /
G / / /
vi-V:
Am / / /
G / / /
Interrupted Cadence
Even less final than an imperfect cadence is an ending progression called an
interrupted cadence. In this progression, you use a V chord to trick the listener
into thinking a perfect cadence is on its way, but then move to any type of
chord except the tonic.
V-IV, V-vi, V-ii, and V-V7 progressions all are interrupted cadences—and, in
the key of C, look like this:
V-IV:
G / / /
F / / /
V-vi:
G / / /
Am / / /
V-ii:
G / / /
Dm / / /
V-V7:
G / / /
G7 / / /
Common Chord Progressions
Given everything you’ve learned about chord leading and cadences, you should
be able to create your own musically sound chord progressions. However, just
in case you get stuck, let’s take a look at some of the most popular chord pro-
gressions used in music today.
I-IV
It doesn’t get much simpler than this, just the tonic (I) and the subdominant
(IV) chords repeating back and forth, over and over. This is a cyclical progres-
sion, good for songs that don’t really have a final resolution point.
In the key of C, the progression looks like this:
C / / /
F / / /
I-V
If you can cycle between the tonic and the subdominant (IV), why not the tonic
and the dominant (V)? Like the first progression, the simplicity of this one
makes it quite common in folk and some forms of popular music.
In the key of C, the progression looks like this:
C / / /
G / / /
In classical music theory,
an interrupted cadence 
is more often called a
deceptive cadence.
Note
Jazz musicians
sometimes refer to chord
progressions as chord
changes—as in, “Dig
those crazy changes, man!”
Definition

Chapter 10: Chord Progressions
Unlike the I-IV progression, this one has a bit more finality, thanks to the V-I
relationship. But since you keep going back to the V (and then the I, and then the
V again, and then the I again, and on and on …), it still is very cyclical sounding.
I-IV-V
You can’t get any more popular than the old I-IV-V progression. This is the
progression (in the key of G) you’re playing when you strum the chords G, C,
and D on your guitar.
There are many different variations on the I-IV-V progression. You can leave
out the IV, insert an extra I between the IV and the V, and even tack on another
I-V at the end to wrap things up with a perfect cadence. You also can vary the
number of beats and measures you devote to each chord.
One example of I-IV-V in a four-measure phrase might look like this, in the key
of C:
C / / /
C / / /
F / / /
G / / /
You could also bunch up the IV and the V into a single measure, like this:
C / / /
C / / /
C / / /
F / G /
The progression also could be used over longer phrases, as in this eight-measure
example:
C / / /
C / / /
C / / /
C / / / 
F / / /
F / / /
G / / /
G / / /
The point is these three chords are used in a huge number of modern songs—
and make up the core of what many refer to as “three-chord rock-and-roll.”
They’re not limited to rock, of course; many folk, country, jazz, rap, and even
classical and show tunes are based on these three chords.
It’s an extremely versatile progression.
I-IV-V-IV
This progression is a variation on I-IV-V. The variation comes in the form of a
shift back to the subdominant (IV), which then forms a plagal cadence when it
repeats back to the tonic. In the key of C, the progression looks like this:
C / / /
F / / /
G / / /
F / / /
It’s a nice, rolling progression—not too heavy—without a strong ending feeling to
it—which makes it nice for tunes that repeat the main melody line again and again.
I-V-vi-IV
This progression is another rolling one, good for repeating again and again.
(That’s because of the ending plagal cadence—the IV repeating back to I.)
In the key of C, it looks like this:
C / / /
G / / /
Am / / /
F / / /
135
This progression is
often played with a
dominant seventh
chord on the fifth
(V7), which provides
increased tension before
you return to the tonic.
Tip

Part 3: Tunes
136
I-ii-IV-V
This progression has a constant upward movement, resolved with a perfect
cadence on the repeat back to I. In the key of C, it looks like this:
C / / /
Dm / / /
F / / /
G / / /
I-ii-IV
This is a variation on the previous progression, with a soft plagal cadence at the end
(the IV going directly to the I, no V involved). In the key of C, it looks like this:
C / / /
Dm / / /
F / / /
As with all progressions that end with a plagal cadence (IV-I), this progression
has a rolling feel, and sounds as if it could go on and on and on, like a giant circle.
I-vi-ii-V
This was a very popular progression in the 1950s, the basis of a lot of doo-wop
and jazz songs. It’s also the chord progression behind the song “I’ve Got Rhythm,”
and sometimes is referred to (especially in jazz circles) as the “I’ve Got Rhythm”
progression.
In the key of C, it looks like this:
C / / /
Am / / /
Dm / / /
G / / /
I-vi-IV-V
This is a variation on the “I’ve Got Rhythm” progression, with a stronger lead
to the V chord (IV instead of ii). It looks like this, in the key of C:
C / / /
Am / / /
F / / /
G / / /
This progression was also popular in the doo-wop era and in the early days of
rock-and-roll. The defining factor of this progression is the descending bass line;
it drops in thirds until it moves up a step for the dominant chord, like this: C-A-
F-G. You’ve heard this progression (and that descending bass line) hundreds of
times; it’s a very serviceable progression.
I-vi-ii-V7-ii
This is another variation on the “I’ve Got Rhythm” progression, with an extra ii
chord squeezed in between the final V and the return to I, and with the V chord
played as a dominant seventh. In the key of C, it looks like this:
C / / /
Am / / /
Dm / / /
G7 / Dm /
By adding the ii chord between the V7 and the I, almost in passing, it takes the
edge off the perfect cadence and makes the progression a little smoother.

Chapter 10: Chord Progressions
137
IV-I-IV-V
As this progression shows, you don’t have to start your chord progression on
the tonic. In the key of C, it looks like this:
F / / /
C / / /
F / / /
G / / /
This progression has a bit of a rolling nature to it, but also a bit of an unre-
solved nature. You can keep repeating this progression (leading from the V back
to the IV), or end the song by leading the progression home to a I chord.
ii-V-I
This progression is quite popular in jazz, often played with seventh chords
throughout. So you might actually play a ii7-V7-I progression, like this (in the
key of C):
Dm7 / / /
G7 / / /
CM7 / / /
Sometimes jazz tunes cycle through this progression in a variety of keys, often
using the circle of fifths to modulate through the keys. (That’s the term you use
any time you change key.)
Circle of Fifths Progression
There’s one more chord progression that’s fairly common, and it’s based on the
circle of fifths you learned about back in Chapter 9. Put simply, it’s a progression
where each chord is a fifth above the next chord; each chord functions as the
dominant chord for the succeeding chord. The progression circles back around
on itself, always coming back to the tonic chord, like this: I-IV-vii°-iii-vi-ii-V-I.
The IV-I-IV-V progression is
also frequently played at
the end of a phrase in
many jazz tunes. Used in
this manner, it’s called a
turnaround. (See Chapter
16 to learn more.)
Note
The circle of fifths progression presented here is a simple one you can use without
getting into nonscale chords. But there’s also another, longer, circle of fifths pro-
gression, based on chromatic chords, that you might want to play around with.
It’s a little too complex to write out in Roman numeral notation, but it works by
having each chord function as the precise subdominant of the next chord—that is,
the chords move in perfect fifths around the chromatic scale. Even more fun, each
chord is turned into a dominant seventh chord, to make the dominant-tonic rela-
tionship more explicit. Here’s how it works, in the key of C:

You can also play this progression backward, creating a circle of fourths, but that

Singing the Blues
There’s a unique chord progression associated with the genre of music we com-
monly call the blues. This blues form isn’t relegated solely to blues music, how-
ever; you’ll find this form used in many jazz and popular tunes, as well.
The blues progression is a 12-measure progression. (It’s sometimes called a “12-
bar blues.”) This 12-measure progression repeats again and again throughout
the melody and any instrumental solos.
The form is essentially a I-IV-I-V7-I progression, but spread over twelve meas-
ures, like this:
I / / /
I / / /
I / / /
I / / /
IV / / /
IV / / /
I / / /
I / / /

Although these are the basic blues chords, you can use lots of variations to spice
up individual songs. (Turn to Chapter 16 to see some of these variations.)
Chords and Melodies
Although chords fill out a tune and provide its harmonic underpinning, you still
need a melody to make a song.
The relationship between chords and melody is complex—and works a little like
the proverbial chicken and the egg. You can start with one or the other, but in the
end you have to have both.
This means you can write a melody to a given chord progression, or you can start
with the melody and harmonize it with the appropriate chords. There’s no set place
to start; whether you start with the melody or the chords is entirely up to you.
Fitting Chords to a Melody
If you write your melody first, you then have to figure out which chords fit where.
In many cases, it’s a simple matter of applying one of the common chord pro-
gressions to your melody; more often than not, you’ll find one that’s a perfect fit.
The blues progression is
sometimes played with a
V7 chord in the final
measure.

Chapter 10: Chord Progressions
To demonstrate, let’s look at the chords behind some of the melodies we first
examined back in Chapter 8.
Michael, Row the Boat Ashore
We’ll start with “Michael, Row the Boat Ashore,” which is a great example of a
progression that relies heavily on the I, IV, and V chords—but with a few twists.
Here’s the song, complete with chords:
139
The chords to “Michael, Row the Boat Ashore.”
The first twist in the chord progression comes in the fifth full measure (the start
of the second phrase), which uses the iii chord (F♯m) instead of the expected I.
The second twist is the sixth measure, which moves down to the ii chord (Em).
From there the melody ends with a perfect cadence (I-V-I), just as you’d expect.
So, if you started your hunt for the perfect progression for this melody by apply-
ing a standard I-IV-V progression, you’d be in the right neighborhood.
Bach’s Minuet in G
Next, let’s examine Bach’s Minuet in G. Again, if you apply the standard I-IV-V
progression, you’ll be pretty much on the mark, as you can see here:
The chords to Bach’s Minuet in G.

Old Johann was able to wring the most out of a very simple chord progression;
in this case nothing more than I-IV-I-IV-I-V-I. Of course, this shows that you
don’t need a complex chord progression to create great music.
Dvorˇák’s New World Symphony
Dvorˇák’s New World Symphony uses another relatively simple chord progression,
as you can see here:
The chords to Dvorˇák’s New World Symphony.
The chord progression is basically I-V-I, with a neat little ii-V-I imperfect
cadence at the end. There’s also a very unique nonscale twist in the second half
of the third measure, where the I chord (D♭) suddenly gets a raised fifth and
goes augmented. (In the orchestral score, the fifth is in the bass in this measure,
for a very dramatic effect.) The use of the augmented tonic sets up an unex-
pected tension, without messing up the harmonic structure by throwing in
something like a IV or a V chord where it wouldn’t really belong.
Pachelbel’s Canon in D
Even more simple is the chord progression behind Pachelbel’s Canon in D, as
you can see here:
The chords to Pachelbel’s Canon in D.
Note how the chords flow, one into the next, based on established chord leading
rules—I-V-vi-iii-IV-I-IV-V—and then back to the I, again and again. You can
play this progression all night long and not get tired of it; that’s what makes it
such a classic.

Chapter 10: Chord Progressions
Mary Had a Little Lamb
Finally, let’s figure out the chords to “Mary Had a Little Lamb.” Just as the melody
is a simple one, so is the accompanying chord progression—nothing more than
I-V-I, repeated once. Sometimes the simplest progressions are the best!
141
The chords to “Mary Had a Little Lamb.”
Chord Writing Tips
When it comes to fitting a chord progression to an existing melody, here are
some tips to keep in mind:
◆Try some common chord changes first. You’d be surprised how many
melodies fit with the I-IV-V progression!
◆The main notes in the melody (typically the notes that fall on the first and
third beats of a measure) are the first, third, or fifth note of the underlying
chord.
◆Try to simplify the melody by cutting out the passing and neighboring
tones (typically the shorter notes, or the notes not on major beats); the
main notes you have left often will suggest the underlying chord.
◆Make sure you’re in the right key. In most cases, the “home” note in the
melody is the tonic note of the underlying key.
◆Generally, the slower the tempo, the more frequent the chord changes.
(So if you have a long whole note, or a note held over several measures,
expect to find several different chords played behind that single note.)
◆Work backward from the end of a melodic phrase, remembering that
melodies almost always end on the I chord. You then can figure out the
cadence leading to the I, and have half the song decoded fairly quickly.
◆Chord changes generally fit within the measure structure, which means
you’re likely to see new chords introduced on either the first or third beat
of a measure.

Part 3: Tunes
Writing a Melody to a Chord Progression
You don’t have to start with a melody; you can base your tune on a specific
chord progression and compose a melody that best fits the chords.
If you prefer to work this way, it helps to get a good feel for the chord progres-
sion before you start writing the melody. Play the chords again and again on
either a piano or guitar. In many cases, you’ll find a melody forming in your
head; if this type of natural melody comes to you, you only have to figure the
notes and write them down.
If no natural melody occurs, it’s time to roll out the theory. While you don’t
want to work totally mechanically, there are some basic approaches you can use.
Take a look at these tips:
◆Stay within the notes of the chords—at least for the main notes in the
melody. If you’re holding an A minor chord in a specific measure, work
with the notes A, C, and E for your melody.
142
A simple melody for the popular I-IV-V chord progression—note the heavy use of chord notes in the melody. ( The notes
indicated with a (p) are passing tones.)
◆Try to find a logical line between the main notes in different measures.
For example, if your chord progression goes C-Am-F, realize that these
chords have one note in common—the C. So you can base your melody
around the C note. Conversely, if your chord progression goes C-F-G,
you might want to pick three notes (one from each chord) that flow
smoothly together—E to F to G, for example; or G to F to D.
◆Use notes that emphasize the quality of the underlying chords. For exam-
ple, when you’re writing to a V7 chord, emphasize the tension by using
either the root or the seventh of the chord in the melody.
◆Once you pick your main tones, fill in the gaps with passing tones.
◆Come up with an interesting rhythmic motif, and repeat that rhythm
throughout the melody.
I wish there were a more complete set of rules for adding a melody to a chord
progression, but we’re getting into an area that is more art than science. The
best way to hone your skill is simply to work at it—play a lot of chord progres-
sions, and practice writing different types of melodies over the chords. (And
remember to read my companion book, The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Music
Composition, for lots more advice and instruction.)
Over time, you’ll figure out your own rules for writing melodies—and develop
your own melodic style.
In this example, the C in
measure 3, beat 4 is tech-
nically an anticipation, not
a passing tone. An antici-
pation is, in effect, an
“eager” note—a note from
the next chord that is
sounded just a little earlier
than the chord itself.

The Least You Need to Know
◆Every note of the scale has an associated chord, notated by a Roman
numeral (uppercase for major; lowercase for minor).
◆Chord progressions naturally lead back to the tonic, or I, chord of the
underlying scale.
◆Every chord naturally leads to at least one other chord; for example, the V
chord naturally leads to the I.
◆The final chords in a progression--the ones that ultimately lead back to
I—are called a cadence.
◆The most common chord progressions include I-IV, I-V, I-IV-V, I-IV-V-
IV, I-V-vi-IV, I-ii-IV-V, I-ii-IV, I-vi-ii-V, I-vi-IV-V, I-vi-ii-V7-ii, IV-I-IV-

In This Chapter
◆Understanding the parts of a piece of music
◆Analyzing song structure
◆Discovering head tunes
◆Learning longer musical forms
Now that you know all about melodies and chord progressions, it’s time to think
about the entire piece of music, from start to finish. A piece of music, after all,
is more than just an eight-measure melody (and accompanying chords) played
once. Most pieces repeat a melody several times, and often contain more than
one melody.
When you’re constructing a song (or a longer piece of music), you have to con-
sider the overall form of the piece. If you have a main melody, do you need to
repeat that melody—and if so, where, and how many times? Do you need to
add a second, contrasting melody? What about some sort of buffer or break
between the two melodies? And how do you work your way into the main
melody—and how do you wrap things up at the end?
All these questions pertain to what we call song form. Song form is the sum of all
the parts that make up your song, usually in some sort of logical order.
Think of song form as the grammar you use when writing music. Just as you
can analyze the pieces and parts of a sentence, you can also analyze the pieces
and parts of a song and, not surprisingly, there are some common parts you
probably want to use.
There are also some established forms you might want to use; especially if
you’re writing classical music—symphonies, cantatas, minuets, and the like.
We’ll discuss these classical forms in this chapter, too, for when you’re ready to
take on some serious composing tasks!
Chapter

Part 3: Tunes

Parts of a Song
When you’re writing popular music, there are accepted parts of a piece of
music that you have to work with. Not that you have to use each song part in
each and every song you write; these parts are more like building blocks you
can use (at your discretion) to construct your own individual piece of music.
In popular music, most any piece of music is typically called a song. In other
types of music, such as classical music, the word “song” has more specific conno-
tations regarding length and form and use of instruments and voices. To be more
universal, you could use the word composition, or (less formally) the words piece
or tune. Since this book, however, deals primarily with popular music, we’ll con-
tinue to use the word song—as long as you realize that we’re talking about any
formal musical composition, not just something played by four guys with guitars.
Note
Introduction
The introduction, or intro, to a piece is typically some sort of instrumental
lead-in. The introduction can be of any length, and doesn’t even need to exist—
a song can start cold on the first note of the first verse. The introduction may
include a theme based on the song’s main melody, played by one of the instru-
ments; or maybe just a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus.
In any case, the introduction is used to set up the first verse of the song, and
then is quickly forgotten.
Verse
The verse is the first main melody of the piece. It’s an important melody, and
often is repeated several times throughout the course of the song.
Harmonically, the melody might end on the tonic chord (I), or it might end on
the dominant (V), creating a tension that is resolved when you proceed to the
chorus.
If your song has words, each instance of the verse typically has a different set of
lyrics. The lyrics to the first verse are sometimes repeated in the final verse. In
all cases, the verse should relate to and lead into the song’s chorus.
Chorus
The chorus is the second main melody of the song, and the emotional high
point of the piece. The chorus should contain the main melodic theme, as well
as any hook you might include to grab the listener. The hook can be in the
melody, chords, rhythm, or lyric—something unique and memorable that sets
this song apart from all others. Choruses are often shorter than verses, often
lasting just four or eight measures.

Chapter 11: Phrases andForm
147
Bridge
The bridge is kind of a break in the middle of the piece. Most bridges sound
completely different from the verse and chorus, and are often based on a differ-
ent harmonic structure. For example, a bridge might be based around the IV
chord instead of the I chord.
Bridges typically are short—only about eight measures. (That’s why a bridge is
sometimes called the “middle eight” of a song.)
Instrumental Solo
If you’re writing a song with lyrics, you might want to give the singer (and the
audience) a break by inserting an instrumental section after the chorus or bridge.
This section should probably be based on the chords of the verse, or maybe the
verse and chorus combined. When the instrumentalist is done soloing, you
return to either the verse or the chorus and pick up the lyric where you left off.
This section is relevant only if you’re writing a song with lyrics; otherwise the
entire song is instrumental!
Ending
The ending isn’t necessarily a separate section of the song. Sometimes you end
the song after the last chorus; either by stopping on the I chord or (if you’re in
a recording studio) fading out the volume. More sophisticated songs have unique
ending sections tacked on to the end of the song, which typically use some sort
of cadence or turnaround (explained in Chapter 16). You might even want the
ending to mirror the song’s intro, or otherwise reflect the melodic or harmonic
nature of the piece.
Putting It All Together
Most popular and jazz music is based on eight-measure phrases. Your verse
might be one eight-measure phrase; your chorus, another. We keep track of the
different parts of a song by assigning them letters—which shouldn’t be confused
with the letters we used to label the notes in a scale. (These letters have nothing
to do with individual notes or pitches.)
The very first eight-measure phrase in your song—which is typically the first
verse—is labeled “A.” If the verse is repeated anywhere in the song, it retains its
“A” labeling.
The second eight-measure phrase—typically the chorus—is labeled “B.” If the
chorus repeats later in the song, the repeated chorus is still labeled “B.”
The third eight-measure phrase—the bridge, if you have one—is labeled “C.”
Additional phrases build on this lettering scheme.
An extended chorus played
during the fadeout of a
song is called the out
chorus.
Note
The eight-measure phrase
rule isn’t hard and fast,
although the concept of
being divisible by eight is
somewhat rigidly fol-
lowed. This means that, in
addition to the standard
eight-measure phrases, you
can also have 16- and
32-bar phrases, both of
which are divisible by 8.
(Although if a phrase gets
to be 32 bars long, it’s
probably more of a section
than a phrase, if you want
to be technical about it.)

Part 3: Tunes
Let’s look at a song that has a verse, a chorus, a verse, and another chorus. The
form of this song would look like this:
A
B
A
B
Note that when the verse repeats, we don’t give it a new letter; it keeps the “A”
designation—even if the lyrics change. Same thing with the chorus; the B sec-
tion is always B, no matter how many times it repeats.
Now let’s look at a song that has two verses, a chorus, and a final verse. The
form of this song looks like this:
A
A
B
A
Things get more interesting when you add a bridge to the mix. Consider a song
with two verses, a chorus, a bridge, and a final chorus:
A
A
B
C
B
Or how about a song with two verses, a chorus, another verse, a bridge, a final
verse, and a final chorus:
A
A
B
A
C
A
B
It’s not really that hard to follow, once you know what letters stand for what.
Incidentally, some songs are all A. This is fairly common in folk music, where
you have one melodic phrase repeated over and over, each time with a different
set of lyrics. Think of “If I Had a Hammer,” or “Where Have All the Flowers
Gone?” as good examples. Neither song has a chorus, per se; they’re all verses,
and lots of them.
Head Cases
There’s a unique musical form associated with jazz music, and with some rock-
and-roll “jam” bands. This form, called the head arrangement, is ideally suited
for extended improvisation.
In this type of music you play the “head”—the main melody, or sometimes both
verse and chorus—relatively straight, and then repeat those chord progressions
for a series of instrumental solos. (Jazz musicians call this “soloing over the
changes.”) The head is then repeated, straight after the soloists blow themselves
out.
In terms of form, this type of tune might look like this:
A (head)
A (solos)
A (head repeat)
If a more complex song (complete with both verse and chorus) is used as the
head, the form might look something like this:
ABA (head)
ABA (solos)
ABA (head repeat)
148
When you have
variations of a sin-
gle section like this,
you can label each
instance of the section by
a number after the letter, as
in A1, A2, A3, and so on.

Classical Music Forms
Within the genre that most of us know as “classical” music, several distinct
forms exist. If you plan to take a more traditional path in your musical career,
you’ll need to explore each of these forms in more depth:
◆Anthem
An anthem is a piece of choral music, generally with a religious
text. (The anthem is the Protestant church’s version of the Latin motet.)
Most anthems are for four voices, and some even include instrumental
parts; most often for string instruments.
◆Aria
An aria is a vocal piece (a song, operatic in nature) that can be
either standalone, or part of a larger work. Over time, arias have become
longer and more complex, serving as a type of showcase for the vocalist.
◆Canon
The canon is a musical form in which the melody is imitated by
various parts at regular intervals. Canons typically are instrumental in nature.
◆Cantata
A cantata is a type of chamber music, Baroque in style. It comes
primarily from Lutheran church music, and is written for either soloists
and instrumental accompaniment or soloists, chorus, and instrumental
accompaniment.
◆Choral symphony
A choral symphony is, quite simply, a symphony that
incorporates a choir. The most notable example of this form is Beethoven’s
Symphony No. 9 in D Minor, an adaptation of Schiller’s Ode to Joy.
◆Chorale
A chorale is a congregational hymn of the Lutheran church,
originally written in unison but later adapted for four vocal parts or organ.
◆Concerto
A concerto is a piece of ensemble music for voices and instru-
ments, typically with a solo instrument or voice in contrast with an orches-
tral ensemble.
◆Fugue
The term fugue describes a piece of music that incorporates imi-
tative counterpoint. (See Chapter 14 to learn more about counterpoint.)
Most fugues are instrumental in nature.
◆Grand motet
This musical form is a motet for large ensembles of voices
and instruments, contrasting solo voices with the larger chorus.
◆Lieder
The word lieder is the plural of lied—German for “song.” In pop-
ular usage, lieder is a non-operatic art song with lyrics based on a dramatic
poem; in performance, the vocal and the piano accompaniment are of
equal importance.
◆Madrigal
A madrigal is a piece of vocal music based on a fourteenth-
century Italian form. The typical madrigal is a polyphonic composition for
four to six voices, typically unaccompanied, based on a poem or other sec-
ular text.
◆March
A march is an instrumental piece, based on a regular and
repeated drum rhythm, originally developed for military bands.

Part 3: Tunes
150
◆Mass
A vocal work based on the Roman Catholic mass. The five pas-
sages of the mass that are frequently set for choir or for choir and vocal
soloists include the Kyrie (“Lord have mercy”), Gloria in excelsis Deo
(“Glory be to God on high”), Credo (“I believe”), Sanctus (“Holy, holy”),
and Agnus Dei (“O Lamb of God”).
◆Minuet
A minuet is a French dance in triple time (3/4, 3/8, 6/8, and so
forth).
◆Motet
The motet is a short unaccompanied choral work, popular from
the thirteenth through the sixteenth centuries. The early motet was exclu-
sively a sacred form, based on pre-existing melodies; other words and
melodies were added in counterpoint.
◆Opera
An opera is a long, complex dramatic work, incorporating both
voices and instruments. You can think of an opera as the classical equiva-
lent of today’s popular musicals, mixing music with a dramatic plot.
◆Operetta
Literally, a “little opera.” More commonly, a shorter or less
ambitious stage work than a full-blown opera, typically with just a single act.
◆Oratorio
A dramatic musical setting of a religious libretto, for solo
singers, choir, and orchestra. An oratorio is like a non-secular opera, but
without the scenery or costumes; oratorios are typically performed in con-
cert halls or churches.
◆Plainsong
Plainsong, also known as plainchant, is chant comprised of a
single line of vocal melody, typically unaccompanied and performed in the
free rhythm of the spoken word. The form matured during the sixth cen-
tury, at the request of Pope Gregory I, and was subsequently known as
Gregorian chant.
◆Programme music
Programme music is instrumental music that tells a
story, illustrates a literary idea, or evolves a pictorial scene.
◆Sonata
A sonata is a piece of instrumental music, performed in several
distinct sections (called movements). Sonatas typically are written for a
soloist and small ensemble.
◆Song
A song, in classical music, is a short and self-contained piece for
one or more voices; it can be accompanied or not, and either sacred or
secular in nature. In popular music, however, just about any musical com-
position (vocal or instrumental) is called a song.
◆String quartet
The string quartet is a particular form of chamber music
written for two violins, viola, and cello. In terms of importance, the string
quartet is to chamber music as the symphony is to orchestral music.
◆Suite
A suite is an ordered set of instrumental pieces meant to be per-
formed at a single sitting.
◆Symphony
A symphony is an extended work for orchestra, typically in
three or four distinct movements. The symphony is generally regarded as
the central form of orchestral composition—this is the big dog of classical
instrumental music.

If you’re serious about continuing your music education, you’ll study each of these
forms in much more detail. For now, though, it’s probably enough to know the
names of these forms; you can learn more about each form when the time comes.
The Least You Need to Know
◆Most popular songs consist of a short instrumental intro, one or more verses,
a chorus, a bridge, and an ending.
◆Each part of the song is assigned a letter; the form of the song is notated by a
combination of letters. For example, a song with two verses, a chorus, and a
final verse is designated AABA.
◆Jazz musicians and jam bands often play head arrangements, in which the
main melody (the head) is played straight; then used for a series of instrumen-
tal solos.
◆There are several forms specific to classical music, including the opera, the
sonata, and the symphony.

Introduction, Track 1
In an ideal world, everything you need is served up to you on a silver platter. As
a musician, that means you’ll always get perfectly noted pieces of sheet music
from which to read, with all the chords and melodies and rhythms clearly writ-
ten out.
Unfortunately, we don’t live in an ideal world: You won’t always get sheet music
for the songs you have to play; sometimes you’ll be expected to “play by ear”
and figure out the music on your own.
How do you write down a piece of music, note for note, based on a few listens
to a CD? It’s a particular skill, that’s for sure; one that involves a technique called
ear training. That means you have to train your ears to recognize certain rhythms
and intervals, and be able to transfer what you hear to the written page.
Training Your Ear
Consider the following: You’re in a band that plays the latest hit songs, and the
band leader gives you a CD and asks you to learn a new tune—by tomorrow
night. No sheet music, no one to answer your questions, no one to practice
with you and help you figure it out—you’re completely on your own, just you
and your CD player.
Or you’re working with a songwriter who doesn’t read music. Your friend sings
a melody, and asks you to write it down so he can send it to a music publicist.
He doesn’t know what key the song is in, or what notes he’s singing; he leaves
those details up to you to figure out.

Maybe you’re playing organ in the church choir. The guest vocalist this week
approaches you just before Sunday’s service, and says she’ll be singing “Amazing
Grace,” in the key of G. She doesn’t have any sheet music for you—“You know
the song,” she says—and if you don’t, you’ll have to learn it, fast.
Perhaps you’re playing saxophone in a pickup band at your local bar. It’s open
mike night, and the next performer wants you to add some horn accompani-
ment to his tune. “It’s a 12-bar blues,” he says, “in the key of A. You have a solo
after the second chorus.” No music, no nothing—just you, onstage, winging it.
All of these situations require you to think on your feet—or, more properly, to
play by ear. You need to be able to hear a song and figure out what chords and
notes are being played, without benefit of any written music.
This might sound daunting to you, but it’s a skill you need to develop. You have
to be able to hear a melody or chord progression, and then transcribe what you
hear. With practice, you’ll be able to do this quickly and accurately; it can even
become second nature. All you have to do is train your ears.
Transcribing music involves three distinct steps:
1. Listen
2. Process
3. Document
You begin by listening to the music—not for passive enjoyment, but more actively,
so that you clearly hear every note. Then you process what you’ve heard, figur-
ing out what notes and chords and rhythms are being played. Finally, you docu-
ment the music you’ve processed, either by writing down the notes on paper, or
using the processed music as a basis for live playing or improvisation.
With practice, you’ll move through the listen-process-document system almost
subconsciously; the notes will come to you automatically when you hear them,
without a lot of work on your part. So warm up your ears—it’s time for the
training to begin!
Transcribing is the
art of writing down melo-
dies and chords by ear,
without the benefit of any
other written notation.
Definition
Ear training is a difficult skill to learn. Developing your listening skills takes time
and guidance, and for most people is best accomplished in a classroom setting,
or with an experienced teacher.
If you’re serious about training your ears, a good place to start is with the CD
that accompanies this book. The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Music Theory, Second
Edition, Ear Training Course presents a series of audio examples and exercises
that will help you learn to recognize scales, intervals, chords, and rhythms. And
you can check your progress against the answers provided in Appendix D.
If you want to continue in this self-paced fashion, pick up a copy of Ron Gorow’s
Hearing and Writing Music: Professional Training for Today’s Musician (Septem-
ber Publishing, 2000). Even better, head down to your local community college
or university and sign up for an ear-training class. The personal feedback and
guidance you’ll receive from the instructor will be worth the effort.

Chapter 12: Transcribing What You Hear

Listening—Actively
Before we get into ear training proper, you need to learn how to actively listen
to music. This isn’t listening for enjoyment; it’s listening to remember, and to
analyze.
Start by isolating yourself from the hurly-burly of your day-to-day life. Turn off
the TV, close the windows, and block out all extraneous noises—the air condi-
tioner, the refrigerator, the hum of the air pump in your fish tank. Create an
environment in which you can focus on the music, without any distractions.
Prepare the music. This means setting up your audio system, with a good pair
of speakers, or even a quality set of headphones. Make sure the music source
can be easily accessed; you’ll be doing a lot of rewinding and fast forwarding.
Now get yourself comfortable. Find a comfy chair, or a couch, or even a place
on the floor, surrounded by pillows. Get comfortable, but don’t get relaxed;
instead, remain alert and ready for input. And don’t squirm. When you’re fully
prepared, it’s time to listen. Select a song, one of your favorites; then press the
play button … and listen.
Begin by listening to the overall form of the song. Determine where one phrase
ends and another begins. Figure out where the verses are, and the chorus, and
even the bridge, if there is one. Get a feel for how the song is constructed, for
its internal logic, for the way it flows from one point to another.
Now listen to the song again, but this time focus carefully on the melody line.
Listen hard, and listen critically. Note where the melody goes up, and where it
goes down. Note where the melody changes; where the verse ends and the cho-
rus begins; and where any variations occur. Listen to it as many times as you
need, until you’re sure you can sing it back, verbatim.
Return to the start of the song, and this time don’t listen to the melody. Instead,
listen to the bass line. Listen to the tones played, and to the rhythms. Note how
the bass notes relate to the melody, and to the other parts. Listen to the bass
part and memorize the bass part; then play the song back again and sing along
with the bass, from memory.
Again, return to the start of the song. This time listen to another part—the lead
guitar, or the piano, or the saxophone. It doesn’t matter; pick a part, and follow
it from start to finish. Listen critically, and hear how this part fits with the bass and
the melody and all the other parts. Listen until you have the part memorized.
Repeat this process until you know all the parts of the song. Get to the point
where you can sing back any given part, without prompting. Let that song get
inside your brain; become one with the music.
Finally, listen to the entire song again and try to figure out where the chord
changes are. There might be a new chord every 4 beats, or 8, or even 16.
Figure out the time signature (probably 4/4), and then try to lay a map of the
chord changes over the form of the song.
When you’re isolat-
ing the bass line,
you might want to
turn up the bass
(and turn down the treble)
on your audio system, to
better hear the low notes.
Tip

Part 4: Accompanying
This is how you actively listen to a song. You’re not listening for enjoyment
(you can do that separately); you’re listening to learn—and to remember. Once
you can recall a part exactly, from memory, you’re one step closer to figuring
out the notes behind the part, and transcribing it to paper.
Developing Superhearing
As part of your active listening, you have to be able to discern the component
parts of the music. You have to be able to hear discrete pitches and intervals,
hear different rhythms, and even hear the individual pitches within each chord.
Sound difficult? It is—which is why you need to practice.
Hearing Pitch
Lesson 1, Track 2
The first part of the music you need to hear is the pitch. You need to be able to
listen to a pitch, isolate it, and then replicate it. In plain English, that means you
need to be able to sing back any specific pitch you hear in a song. To do this,
you have to develop what is called tonal memory, or pitch memory. This is simply
the ability to recall a specific pitch, outside the context of the song or melody.
You can develop your tonal memory with this simple exercise. Take a half-full
glass of water and hit it (gently!) with the edge of a spoon. The glass will produce a
distinct pitch. Listen to the pitch, and fix it in your head. Wait until the glass
stops ringing, then wait a few seconds more, then sing or hum the note that you
heard. While you’re singing (or humming), hit the glass again; if your tonal
memory was on target, the second tone generated by the glass will be the same as
the tone you’re singing. If not, try it again—and pay more attention this time.
Repeat this exercise, adding more time between hitting the glass and singing the
note. The longer you can hold the note in your head, the better developed your
sense of tonal memory will be.
Next, try to find that pitch on your instrument. (Use whatever instrument you
like—piano, guitar, trumpet, whatever—it doesn’t matter.) Hit the glass, wait a
minute, sing the pitch, and then try to play that pitch on your instrument. Don’t
worry if you can’t find the pitch right off. You might need to poke around a few
related notes until you find the one that matches what you’re singing. That’s
natural. With practice, you’ll be able to more quickly identify individual tones.
Obviously, you want to verify the note you’re playing with the source—the
ringing glass. Play the note on your instrument while you hit the glass; if you
have the right note, they’ll be in unison.
You can extend this exercise by generating different notes with different objects.
(You can also fill the glass to different levels to produce different pitches.)
When you’re comfortable with your progress, put on a CD and pick a single
note from the melody. Repeat the exercise, this time trying to reproduce that
melody note. Restart the CD to replay the melody and check your accuracy.

When you hear notes or
melodies inside your head
(in your inner voice),
you’re internalizing the
music.

Hearing Intervals
Lesson 2, Track 11
If you can hear and reproduce a single note, what about two of them?
That’s right: The next step is to develop your tonal memory to decipher and
reproduce pitch intervals.
Before you begin your exercises, you need to develop an internal database of rel-
ative interval relationships. That means internalizing all the different intervals
within a given object—remembering what each interval sounds like.
The best way to do this is to sit down at your instrument and play each interval
until it’s burned into your brain. Play a minor second, and a major second, and a
minor third, and a major third, and so on, until you have each interval committed
to memory. Can you sing a minor third? If not, you need to study some more.
Of course, there are shortcuts you can take. If you can remember specific
snatches of melody, you can associate those melodies with particular intervals.
The following table provides some melodic shortcuts for your interval training:

Interestingly, about 5 percent of musicians (just musicians—not the general popu-
lation) have something called absolute pitch or perfect pitch, which means they
can wake up in the morning and, with no prompting or assistance, correctly sing
or identify any given pitch in the scale. Some people claim to be able to help
you develop this skill, but in general it is virtually impossible for anyone over the
age of five or so to learn perfect pitch. (Not 100 percent impossible, but almost.)
In any case, you don’t really need this kind of long-term pitch memory to tran-
scribe music. You can get along fine with the short-term pitch memory that we all
possess, along with a good interval memory, which we’ll discuss next.

Exercise your interval memory the same way you did your tonal memory. Start by
listening to a song and picking two adjacent notes in the melody—the first two
notes are often the best to work with. Wait a few seconds; then try to sing the two
notes. Verify your accuracy by playing the song again.
Once you can internalize the interval, try to determine what interval it is that
you’re singing. Is it a second? A third? Is it major or minor? Determine the inter-
val, and then try to reproduce the interval on your instrument. Once you can accu-
rately play the interval, you can verify the specific interval you guessed. (For
example, if you find yourself playing a G and then a B, you know you’re playing a
major third.)

Part 4: Accompanying
162
Hearing Rhythms
Lesson 4, Track 27
We’ll set aside pitches for a moment and instead focus on note durations—in
other words, your rhythm memory. Use the same technique as you did before,
but this time listen to the rhythm of a song’s melody. Start by figuring out the
time signature of the song and breaking the melody (in your head) into meas-
ures. Now pick the first few beats of the melody’s first measure. Stop the play-
back, fix that rhythm in your head, and then pound it out with your hand on a
table. Repeat this process until you can hold the rhythm in your head for half a
minute or longer.
Once you can repeat a short rhythmic phrase, it’s time to up the ante. Try re-
peating the rhythm for an entire measure; then two, then four, then for the
entire melody. Always check your accuracy by pounding the table in time to the
original song.
With the entire rhythm of the melody committed to memory, use the theory
you’ve learned and try to transcribe the rhythm. Start small, a beat or two at a
time. Make sure the rhythm you write is mathematically sound; for example, if
the song is in 4/4, all the notes have to add up to a full whole note. (That means
four quarters, or eight eights, or two quarters and four eights, or whatever.)
Once you’ve written down the entire rhythm, play back the song again, this
time reading the rhythm you’ve written. If you notice a discrepancy, correct it;
otherwise, repeat the exercise with another song; this time one that is more
rhythmically complex.
Hearing Melodies
Lesson 5, Track 36
Now that you can hear individual notes, intervals, and rhythms, you should be
able to hear and transcribe complete melodies. All you have to do is put together
everything you hear, in the right order, to develop your melodic memory.
Although you can piece together a melody one note or interval at a time, it’s
easier if you try to grasp the big picture first. That means figuring out how
When you first start listening to intervals, you should focus on the relative
distance between the two notes. Is it a wide span between the pitches?
If so, the interval is a larger one; maybe a fifth or a sixth or something
even larger. Is it a narrow span between the pitches? If so, the interval
is a smaller one; maybe some sort of second or third. Narrow the possibilities
down as much as possible before you determine the precise interval.
Tip

Chapter 12: Transcribing What You Hear
many measures long the melody is, and how it’s broken up into phrases. Once
you can dissemble a melody into its component parts, you should focus on each
part separately.
On what pitch does this part of the melody start? On what pitch does it end?
On what pitch does the middle of the phrase end? If you try to pinpoint indi-
vidual parts of the melody, it should be relatively easy to connect the dots and
fill in the empty spaces with the proper passing and neighboring tones.
Once you’ve written out the entire melody—including both pitches and rhyth-
mic notes—remember to verify your accuracy by playing back the melody
you’ve written. Compare the melody you play with the melody you first heard;
the better you get, the closer they’ll match up.
Hearing Keys
Once you can notate a melody, you should be able to determine what key the
song is in. For example, if your melody incorporates a B♭—but no other flat or
sharp notes—it’s a good guess that the song is written in the key of F. (As you
probably remember from Chapter 4, the key of F has a single flat.) If the
melody has an F♯and a C♯, you’re probably in the key of D.
Another way to determine the key is to fix the home pitch of the melody. If the
melody keeps resolving to G, chances are you’re in the key of G. (Unless, that
is, the melody is minor—in which case, you could be in the key of G minor.)
Test your guess by using your instrument to play a major scale in the designated
key, while the original song is playing. If all the notes fit, you’ve guessed right.
If not, try a related key—a key one or two steps away on the circle of fifths.
Hearing Chords and Chord Progressions
Lesson 6, Track 41
The last piece of the puzzle concerns the underlying chord structure. You need
to hear when the chords change, and what they change to.
When determining chords, it helps to listen to the song’s bass line. If you listen
to the notes the bass is playing, 9 times out of 10 the main notes—all embellish-
ment aside—will be the root notes of the underlying chords. For example, if you
know the song is in the key of C and the bass player plays, in successive meas-
ures, C, A, F, and G, it’s a good guess that the chord progression is C-Am-F-G.
You should also listen carefully to determine whether you’re hearing a major or
a minor chord. Remember, major chords are happy sounding; minor chords are
a little sad.
Once you’ve figured out the chords in the song, you should test your chord
transcription against the melody you’ve previously transcribed. Make sure the
notes of the melody fit within the chord structure; if not, you probably need to
rethink a few chords.
163
If you’re having
trouble hearing the
chords, you can
always try to figure
out the chords from the
notes of the melody, which
you learned how to do
back in Chapter 10.
Tip

Part 4: Accompanying
The real test comes when you play your chords against the original recording.
Be especially careful to match where your chords change with where the chords
change in the original song. It’s not uncommon to accidentally skip a chord
change or two, so listen closely to make sure you picked up on all the changes.
Writing It All Down
If you’ve followed the exercises carefully, you’ve ended up with a complete tran-
scription of the melody and chords for a specific song. Congratulations! It’s a
lot of work, I know, but this newfound skill is one you’ll use again and again as
you progress in the music field.
You can further develop this skill by transcribing other parts of the song, not
just the melody. If the song has a horn section, try to figure out and transcribe
each individual horn part. If there’s an orchestral backing, work on transcribing
the string parts. If there’s a fancy rhythm section, isolate and transcribe the
rhythms played by each individual percussionist.
Further developing your transcribing skill is especially important if you choose
to pursue the fields of composing or arranging. You can certainly challenge
yourself by transcribing an entire big-band arrangement for your high school
jazz band, a full choral arrangement for your church choir, or a string quartet
for your community orchestra. There’s value in this skill—and a great sense of
accomplishment when you get it right.
The Least You Need to Know
◆Ear training is necessary for those times when you don’t have written
music to work with—or when you want to figure out a song you’ve
recently heard.
◆The key to transcribing a song is to listen, process what you’ve heard, and
then document what you’ve processed.
◆To accurately analyze a piece of music, you have to learn how to actively
listen—to isolate and then remember the individual parts of the song.
◆As part of the ear training process, you must develop your intrinsic tonal,
interval, and rhythmic memory, so that you can remember and replicate
the pitches, rhythms, and melodies you hear.
◆Once you’ve transcribed the entire melody, you can more easily figure out
the song’s key signature and its underlying chord structure.

In This Chapter
◆Working with a lead sheet
◆Figuring out what to play
◆Understanding different types of accompaniment
◆Adding a more interesting bass part
◆Accompanying on guitar
If you play piano or guitar, at some point in time you will be asked to accom-
pany another musician or group of musicians. Maybe it’s playing behind a
singer at church, or backing up your children’s choir at school, or even vamping
behind a harmonica soloist in a blues band. Whatever the situation, you’ll be
expected to provide at least rudimentary backing to the primary musicians.
If, along with this request, you also are handed a page of detailed sheet music,
you’re set. All you have to do is read your part, play the notes, and take your bows.
However, if there’s no written music accompanying the request, you have your
work cut out for you. Depending on the gig, you might have to transcribe the
melody, figure out the chords, and compose your own part—all of which you
can do, if you have the proper grounding in music theory.
What’s the Score?
When you’re asked to accompany someone on piano (or guitar, for that matter),
you should first figure out how much homework you need to do. This is deter-
mined by the amount of written music you’re given.
The best of all possible situations is that you receive a complete musical score.
If this is the case, you don’t need to read any further in this chapter—you’re set!
However, it’s more likely that you’ll be provided with only sketchy written
information—or none at all. If this is the case, you need to apply the skills
you’ve learned in the previous chapters to figure out just what you need to play.

168
Working from a Lead Sheet
Here’s the 411: You’re given a sheet of music that includes the melody and the
chords—what musicians call a lead sheet. It will look something like this:
With this lead sheet in hand, what do you play?
The temptation for many novice musicians is to play the melody with your
right hand and form the chords with your left hand.
You should resist this temptation.
When you read a lead sheet, the melody (also known as the lead) is provided for
your reference only. Unless you’re playing solo piano in a cocktail bar, you’re
not expected to play the melody—except, maybe, during instrumental breaks.
No, what you’re expected to play are the chords—along with any kind of embel-
lishment or harmony you can create to play behind the melody.
But the main thing you need from this situation is to play the chords, which
you have—printed in big, bold letters on your lead sheet. Play the chords them-
selves with your right hand, while you play the root note of the chord (the bass
line) with your left hand.
That’s all you have to play, and it isn’t hard at all.
A typical lead sheet—melody and chord symbols.
Learn more about lead
sheets and other types of
arrangements in Chap-
ter 19.
Note
When you’re playing chords with your right hand, try to avoid playing
every chord in the standard 1-3-5 inversion. Try different inversions—
different voicings—to better group the notes from adjacent chords
together. (Turn back to Chapter 9 for more information on chord inver-
sions.) For example, if you’re alternating between the C and the F chord, you
might play the C chord C-E-G, but then play the F chord C-F-A (first inversion),
which lets you leave your thumb on the C note for both chords.
Tip
Working from a Chord Sheet
A chord sheet is like a lead sheet, but without the melody written out. Working
from a chord sheet is just like working from a lead sheet—play the chords with
your right hand and the root of the chord with your left. A typical chord sheet
looks like this:

Chapter 13: Accompanying Melodies
169
A chord sheet—no melody.
Working from a Melody
Sometimes you get the melody (in the form of a lead sheet) without chords. All
you have to go from is the melody—no chords, no bass line, no anything else.
A melody sheet—no chords.
What do you do now?
First, don’t panic. Second, remember back to Chapter 10, in which you learned
how to create a chord progression based on a melodic line. That is the skill
from which you need to draw now.
Take the melody you were given and go off by yourself for a half-hour or so.
Play the melody on the piano, and try to figure out what chords sound good
with that melody. If it’s a familiar song, the chords might come easily to you; if
you’ve never heard the song before, you have your work cut out for you. In any
case, apply the rules you learned back in Chapter 10, and write out your own
chord progression for this melody.
When you’re trying to figure out the chords behind a melody, there are
several different approaches you can take. The best approach, as you
learned in Chapter 10, is to try some common chord progressions. See
if I-IV-V fits the melody; if not, try I-ii-V, or I-vi-IV-V, or the “circle of fifths”
progression. Chances are, one of the common chord progressions will fit—or at
least come close.
Tip
The key thing here is that the chords you write are now your chords. Even if
they’re not quite the established chords for this melody, you can get away with
it by claiming that this is your unique harmonization. You’re at the piano, and
you’re in charge, so what you play must be right!
Now, if you’re playing along with other musicians—perhaps a bass player or a
guitarist—you don’t want to end up with three different sets of chords to this
single melody. If you’re playing in a group, put your heads together and work
out the chord progressions as a group. Heck, maybe one of you actually knows

Part 4: Accompanying
the chords already! In any case, three heads are better than one, and together you
should be able to come up with just the right chord progression for this song.
Working from Nothing
Now we visit the worst-case scenario. You’re asked to play piano accompaniment
and you’re given no music at all. All you have are your ears and your fingers,
and all the skills you’ve picked up from reading this book.
Now you can panic!
In this situation, it’s okay to ask for help. Ask the person in charge if he or she
has anything to give you—a lead sheet, a lyric sheet, an old trumpet part—any-
thing at all. (Anything is better than nothing in this scenario.) Ask what key the
song is in. Ask if there’s anyone who knows the chords and can either teach
them to you or write them down for you. Ask if anyone has a recording of the
song you can take home and listen to.
In short, ask for all the help you can get.
Whatever meager help you get, you’re now on your own. It’s time to fall back
on the ear-training skills you learned back in Chapter 12. You’ll need to figure
out the melody, figure out the key, and figure out the chords. In short, you have
to reconstruct the song from memory and hope you get it right.
Then, when you start to play and the vocalist says “Those aren’t the right
chords!” make sure you have something small but heavy nearby—because you’ll
want to throw it!
Working the Form
Once you get the chords written down, you’ll need to write down some sort of
“cheat sheet” to help you remember the form of the song. Do you play one or
two verses before the first chorus? How long is the introduction? Is there an
instrumental break in the middle—and for how many measures? Do you fade
out at the end, or stop cold?
You’ll need to figure all this out and write it down, so you’ll remember when to
start, when to stop, and what to do in between. Use the form notation (AABA,
ABCA, and so forth) you learned back in Chapter 11 to help you keep your place.
Playing the Part
Once you have the chords written down, you have to play the song. Because
there’s no formal piano part, you’re on your own in terms of figuring out what
type of part to play. Fortunately, you can employ some common accompani-
ment techniques; you don’t have to reinvent the wheel.

Chapter 13: Accompanying Melodies
171
Block Chord Accompaniment
The easiest type of accompaniment to play is the block chord accompaniment.
This approach is exactly as it sounds: Whenever there’s a chord change, you put
all your fingers on the keyboard (at the same time) and play the chord.
That’s it. You don’t play any special rhythms, you don’t arpeggiate the chord,
you don’t do anything except plunk! the notes of the chord all at once.
All you have to do is put the three (or more) notes of the chord in your right
hand and double the root of the chord with your left hand, like this:
Accompanying a melody with block chords.
The primary benefit of playing a block chord accompaniment is that it’s easy—
for you, anyway. The drawback is that it’s a rather sparse accompaniment; it
really doesn’t add anything to the music, except to provide only the most basic
harmonic underpinning to the melody.
Still, if block chords are all you can master, that’s what you should play. No one
will ever accuse you of getting in the way or covering up the melody!
Rhythmic Accompaniment
There’s another way to play chords that isn’t quite as boring as the block chord
approach. You play the block chords, but with a more interesting rhythmic pattern.
What kind of pattern am I talking about? There are several you can choose
from, including these:
Rhythmic accompaniment in quarter notes.

Part 4: Accompanying
172
You can even break up the rhythm slightly by playing your left hand (the bass) on
beats one and three, and your right hand (the chords) on two and four, like this:
Rhythmic accompaniment with a syncopated rhythm.
Rhythmic accompaniment with a syncopated dotted quarter note rhythm—kind of a Latin feel.
Playing the chords on the backbeat.
Or, if you want a more lively sound, play the bass on each beat and the chords
as eighth notes on each upbeat (plus the downbeat of one), like this:
Playing the chords on the upbeat.

Chapter 13: Accompanying Melodies
173
The benefit of this approach is that it provides a driving pulse for the song. The
drawback is that you have to pick the right kind of pulse, which requires you to
have some sense of rhythm.
If you don’t have any natural rhythm, you might want to stick to block chords.
Arpeggiated Accompaniment
If you’re playing a slower song, you might want to break up the chords and play
the individual notes in a sequence, like an arpeggio. You can create a simple
arpeggiated accompaniment by playing straight eighth notes over two beats, with
the root of the chord on beat one, the third of the chord on the first upbeat, the
fifth on beat two, and the third (again) on the second upbeat.
Written out, it looks something like this:
An arpeggiated
accompaniment also is
often called a broken
chord accompaniment
because you break the
chord apart and play
each note separately.
Definition
Playing an arpeggiated accompaniment.
You can vary this accompaniment by changing up the order of the chord tones,
varying the rhythm, or even adding passing notes, like this:
An arpeggiated accompaniment with passing tones in addition to the main chord tones.
If you make sure you play the root of the chord in the bass, you have a quick
and easy accompaniment for all types of music.

Part 4: Accompanying
174
Moving Bass
Once you get good at these simple types of accompaniment, you can spice
things up by playing a more complex bass part.
So far, all you have to do is play the root of the chord—in time!—with your left
hand. However, if you listen to just about any song from the pop era, starting
with the Beatles, you’ll hear a lot more in the bass than just the root. That’s
because bass guitarists in the ’60s upped the ante and started playing some
really interesting bass parts.
If you want to add more bass to your piano accompaniments, start by adding
passing tones between the root notes of consecutive chords, like this:
Paul McCartney was one
of the pioneers of this new
style of bass playing, as
was James Jamerson at
Motown. One of the most
influential bass parts ever
recorded was on the Four
Tops’ hit “Bernadette”—
which is James Jamerson
at the top of his form.
Note
Passing notes in the bass.
You’re not limited to the root in the bass, either. Many bass parts provide inter-
est by stopping on the third or the fifth of the chord, instead of on the root. If
you expand on this concept you end up with a walking bass line, such as that
found in a lot of jazz music. A walking bass line goes beyond simple passing
tones by “walking” up and down the scale, like this:
A walking bass line.
As you develop your accompanying skills, you can elaborate on the bass or the
chords in lots of different ways. Just remember to listen to the song and play a
part that’s appropriate.
One Good Strum Deserves Another
Pianos aren’t the only accompanying instruments, of course. If you play guitar,
you have to face many of the same challenges a piano player does when asked
to provide accompaniment to others.
Chief of these challenges, of course, is figuring out what chords to play—
which, you now know, is within your grasp. All you have to do is use the skills
you learned previously in this book.

Chapter 13: Accompanying Melodies
Once you’ve figured out the chords, you have to play them. In most instances,
you can get by with simple strumming. You can strum on the first beat of every
measure, you can strum on every beat, you can strum a backbeat on two and
four, or you can strum in a more complex rhythm. Depending on the song, you
can even break up the chords by playing one string at a time in an arpeggiated
pattern. The important thing is to use your ears and play what fits the music.
And make sure you keep up with the chord changes!
The Least You Need to Know
◆If you’re given a lead sheet with chord notation, play the chords as written.
◆If you’re given a melody sheet with no chords noted—or no music at all—
you have to figure out the chords before you play.
◆When accompanying other musicians, play the chord with your right hand
and the root of the chord with your left.
◆You can play many different types of accompaniment—block chords, sim-
ple rhythms, broken chords, and so on—depending on the mood and
tempo of the song itself.
◆Before you play a new song, make sure you sketch out the form of the
song (verse, chorus, and so forth) so that you don’t get lost in the middle
of things.

Transposing to Other Keys
In This Chapter
◆Understanding transposition 
◆Discovering when you need to transpose a song
◆Learning different methods of transposition
◆Using computerized music notation programs to transpose your songs
automatically
You’re sitting at your piano, on stage, ready to play the next tune, when the
female vocalist walks over to you.
“This song’s a little high for me in B♭,” she says. “Take it down to A.”
Huh?
Or maybe you’re just starting to play guitar, don’t know all the chords yet, and
just got the sheet music for one of your favorite songs. You blanch when you
discover that the song is in the key of G♭. G-flat! Who plays in G-flat? You
don’t know any chords in G-flat—not a one!
But you do know all your chords in G; maybe there’s a way to change the song
from G♭to G.
Perhaps you’re arranging a Christmas carol for your church choir, which will be
accompanied by a solo trumpet. You hand the trumpet player his part and he
plays what you thought was supposed to be a C—but it comes out as a B♭in-
stead, according to the notes on your piano.
What gives?
All three of these examples are situations in which you need to know how to
transpose a piece of music from one key to another—which is what this chapter
is all about.
Move Your Notes Around
Transposition is the art of translating a note or chord from one key to another.
It’s really a math exercise—this note in this key equals that note in that key.
Chapter

Part 4: Accompanying
178
When you transpose a note or a melody or a chord, you take it from one key,
and instead play the equivalent note, melody, or chord in another key.
For example, let’s say you’re playing the note C in the key of C—the key’s tonic
note. When you transpose that note to the key of F, you now play an F—which
is the tonic note for the key of F.
Sounds easy enough, doesn’t it?
Let’s look at a more complex example: Let’s say you’re in the key of C and you
play a melody that moves from C to D to E—the first three notes of the C
Major scale. When you transpose that melody to the key of F, the new notes
(the first three notes of the F Major scale) are F, G, A.
Getting the hang of it yet?
Here’s another example: Let’s say you’re in the key of C, and you’re playing the
I-vi-IV-V chord progression—C-Am-F-G. When you transpose that chord pro-
gression into the key of F, the new chords are F-Dm-B♭-C. It’s still I-vi-IV-V;
just in a different key.
You can transpose from any one key to any other key. That means you could
move the notes anywhere from a half step to a major seventh up or down from
where you started. (You also can move notes up or down by whole octaves—
what is called octave transposition—but you’re really not altering any notes;
you’re just changing octaves.)
Why You Need to Transpose
As you saw in the introduction to this chapter, there are many different reasons
you might need to transpose a song. Here are some of the most common:
◆The song, as written, is out of the range of a vocalist or instrumentalist. If
a singer can’t hit the high notes in the key of C, maybe the key of B or B♭,
or even A might be friendlier.
◆You or another musician don’t know how to play the song in the given
key. This is especially a problem with beginning guitarists who don’t
always know the chords in some of the more extreme flat or sharp keys—
but they do know the chords for G and A and C and F. If you can trans-
pose the song to one of these keys, everyone can play their parts. (You
have the same problem with any instrument that has to deal with a lot of
sharps and flats in the key signature; it’s easier to play in C, G, D, F, and
B♭than it is to play in the other, more complex, keys.)
◆You’re writing or arranging for one of the many instruments that don’t
play in what we call concert key. For example, trumpets always sound one
whole note lower than what is written—so you have to transpose all trum-
pet players’ music up a step so they’ll be in the same key as the other
musicians. (So if the concert key is C, you write the trumpet part in D;
when a trumpet plays a D, it actually sounds as concert C.) These instru-
ments are called transposing instruments, because you have to transpose
their parts for them.
Concert key or
concert pitch is the under-
lying key of a piece of
music—that is, the actual
pitches that sound when
played. The piano is
always in concert key.

Chapter 14: Transposing to Other Keys
179
These scenarios are more common than you’d think—which means you better
learn how to transpose—and fast!
Four Ways to Transpose
When you have to transpose a song from one key to another, there are four
ways to go about it. You can …
◆Put your math skills to work and manually move each note up or down the
required number of steps.
◆Put your music theory skills to work and utilize degree-wise Roman
numeral notation.
◆Use your music theory skills again and mechanically transpose each note
based on the interval from the previous note.
◆Put technology to work and let a computerized music notation program
do the job for you.
Step-Wise Transposition
Step-wise transposition is the grunt work of the arranging and composing world.
In this method, you count the half steps between the first key and the second,
and then move each note and chord up or down the necessary number of steps.
For example, let’s say you have the following melody in the key of D:
Your original melody, in the key of D.
You need to transpose this melody to the key of F. When you do the counting,
you find that F is three half steps above D. So you have to move all the chords
and notes up three half steps like this:
1. Take the first note of the melody—an A. If you move this note up three
half steps, it becomes a C.
2. Move to the second note of the melody—a B. If you move this note up
three half steps, it becomes a D.
3. Move to the third note of the melody—a C♯. If you move this note up
three half steps, it becomes an E.
And so on, and so on. You do the same thing with the chords:
1. The first chord is D Major. If you move this chord up three half steps, it
becomes an F Major chord.
Many instruments
do not play in concert
key. See Chapter 18 to
learn which instruments
play in what keys.
Warning

Part 4: Accompanying
2. The second chord is a G Major. If you move this chord up three half steps,
it becomes a B♭Major chord.
When you get done transposing all the notes and chords, you get this:
180
The same melody, transposed to the key of F.
It’s grunt work, that’s for sure—but it gets the job done.
Degree-Wise Transposition
If you’ve done a good job reading this book—and developing your music the-
ory skills accordingly—there’s another approach you can take to transposition.
This approach requires you to break all the chords and notes down to their
degrees of the underlying scale; you can then apply those degree representa-
tions to the new key.
The easiest way to understand this approach is to look at chords—in this case,
the chords from our previous key-of-D melody:
The original chord progression, in the key of D.
To get the ball rolling, we’ve noted the chord type above each chord—I, IV, V,
and so forth. For the next few minutes, we’re going to work strictly with this
degree notation and forget (for the time being) about the original chords.
The chord progression in Roman numerals only.
With the chord progression broken down by Roman numeral, you can write
out each of the chords in your new key—in this case, the key of F. When you
write out the new chords, you get this:

Chapter 14: Transposing to Other Keys
181
The chord progression transposed to the key of F.
Voilà! You’ve just transposed the entire chord progression—and you didn’t have
to count any half steps to do it.
You can apply this same technique to the notes in the melody. Work through
the original key-of-C melody and put the degree of the scale (1, 2, 3, and so
forth) under each note of the melody, like this:
If you’re not sure
which chords to use,
refer back to the
Scale-Based Chords
table in Chapter 10.
Tip
Marking up the original melody, write the degree of the scale under each note.
Now get a blank sheet of music paper and, in the key of F, write out the scale
degrees below the staff. If you fill in the actual notes for each scale degree, you
end up with the completed melody:
Your transposed melody, by the numbers.
This method is a little more work for melodies than it is for chords, but it defi-
nitely works.
Interval-Based Transposition
In interval-based transposition, you have to transpose the first note from one
key to another, but then you ignore the key change and work completely in the
new key. You do this by noting the intervals between each note in the melody,
and then using those intervals to “compose” the transposed melody on the fly.
Let’s turn again to our original melody, and note the intervals between each
note in the melody, like this:

Part 4: Accompanying
182
Now, you start composing your “new” melody in the new key. The first note in
the new key (which you have to manually figure out) is a C, and the interval
between that note and the second note is a major second—which makes the sec-
ond note a D. The next interval is another major second, which makes the next
note an E. The next interval is a major second down, which makes the next note
a D. And so on, until you’re done.
The original melody, marked up with intervals.
Transposing your melody one interval at a time.
This method doesn’t work as well when you’re transposing chords, because it
doesn’t tell you what type of chord comes next—major, minor, or other. I sup-
pose you could augment this interval-based approach by noting the chord type
from the original version, but that gets a tad complex; there are easier ways to
transpose chord progressions.
Software-Based Transposition
Thanks to modern computer technology, you may be able to avoid manual
transposition completely. Almost all computerized music notation programs,
such as Finale and Sibelius, let you enter your music in concert key; all you have
to do is click a button (or select a menu item) to automatically transpose one or
more staves to another key.
For example, the Finale program (from Coda Music Technology) has a drop-down
menu option that enables you to determine whether a given part is noted in
concert key or the instrument’s native key. Depending on the option you select,
your score can show all instruments in concert key, or the specific keys for each
instrument. The nice thing about this option is that you can do your original
composing in concert key and then automatically transpose the parts to their
own keys when you’re done writing—which is easier than trying to manually
transpose all the parts while you’re composing.
Finale also lets you transpose a part from any one key to any other key, just by
selecting a few options in a dialog box. When you want to change keys, you can
instruct the program to transpose the original notes up or down, as appropriate,

Chapter 14: Transposing to Other Keys
183
or hold to their original pitches. It’s a lot easier than trying to transpose each
part on your own!
Finale’s Key Signature dialog box; the Transposition Options section lets you choose between
transposing the notes when you change keys and holding the notes to their original pitches.
The Least You Need to Know
◆Transposition is the art of moving notes and chords from one key to another.
◆You need to learn transposition for those times when a singer requests a
song in a different key, you or other musicians can’t play in the original
key, or you’re composing or arranging for instruments that don’t play in
concert key.
◆You can transpose a melody by counting the half steps from one key to
another, noting the scale degrees of the original melody and chords, or
using the intervals between the notes of the melody.
◆Many computerized music notation programs will automatically transpose
your music for you with the click of a mouse.

Harmony and Counterpoint
In This Chapter
◆Understanding the differences—and similarities—between harmony and
counterpoint
◆Creating pleasing background harmonies
◆Using different chord voicings
◆Composing interesting two-part counterpoint
◆Learning effective voice leading technique
A song doesn’t have to be anything more than a melody and chords. Think of a
folk singer and her guitar, or a solo violinist accompanied by piano. Melody and
chords are all you need. However, when you turn on the radio you don’t hear a
lot of solo folk singers. What you typically hear is a full arrangement, complete
with keyboards and bass and drums, background vocals, and other types of
instrumental backing.
Of course, these background vocals and instruments are doing nothing more
than playing the notes in the song’s chord progression. But they also help to fill
out the sound and make the piece of music more interesting.
To fill out your songs, you need to add harmony parts. These harmony parts
can be either vocal or instrumental, and there can be any number of them.
What they do is simple: They follow separate lines within the underlying chord
progression, thus buttressing the harmonic structure of the song.
If you want to get really fancy, your backing parts can represent new and con-
trasting melodies when played against your original melody. When you create
this type of complex harmony, it’s called counterpoint; it’s widely used in many
forms of classical music.

Part 5: Embellishing
188
Two Ways to Enhance a Melody
Two notes sounded together make a harmonic interval; three or more notes
sounded together make a chord; and two or more melodies sounded together
make counterpoint. Intervals and chords are used to construct harmony; coun-
terpoint exists as separate melodic lines.
Another way to think of it is that harmony is a vertical (up and down) combina-
tion of notes, whereas counterpoint operates horizontally (side to side).
Harmony is vertical.
In reality, harmony and counterpoint are related concepts; both involve “vertical”
combinations of notes and both involve a “horizontal” movement of individual
voices or instruments. Still, harmony is more about singing or playing parts of a
chord; counterpoint is more about creating a second (or third or fourth) mel-
ody line—albeit one that adheres to the underlying harmonic structure.
Counterpoint is horizontal.
Technically, the study of harmony includes chords and chord progressions—basically,
anything that combines two or more notes simultaneously. Because we already
covered this basic material in Chapters 9 and 10, in this chapter we’re covering
the use of multiple voices or instruments to enhance melodies, based on the
underlying harmonic structure (chord progression) of a piece of music.
Note
This chapter presents har-
mony and counterpoint

spective. Classical musi-
cians have a much

formal—take on these 
concepts.

Chapter 15: Harmony and Counterpoint
189
Living in Harmony
Harmony is like playing chords behind a melody, only using other instruments
or voices. In fact, the art of adding chords to a melody is a harmonic exercise.
We add harmony parts to our music because harmony lends richness to a song.
It fills out a single melody line and reinforces the underlying chord structure.
A melody with backing harmonies is the difference between a solo vocalist and a
full chorus. It’s the difference between a folk singer with an acoustic guitar and
a pop singer with a group of backup vocalists. It’s the difference between a jazz
trio and a big band.
In other words, harmony makes music bigger.
You create harmony parts by using the notes in the underlying chord progres-
sion. If all you do is assign specific notes of a chord to specific instruments or
voices, you’ve created harmony.
It doesn’t have to be much harder than that. Harmony parts, whether vocal or
instrumental, are typically less rhythmically complex than the main melody. It’s
not uncommon to find harmony parts consisting of whole notes or half notes
while the melody maintains a more complex rhythm.
Harmony parts can also mirror the rhythm of the melody; in these instances,
the harmony resembles classical counterpoint—which you’ll learn about later in
this chapter. Harmony can also be used to punctuate the melody, fill in breaks
in the melody, and function as a kind of call-and-response mechanism. (Think
of the classic pop tune “Midnight Train to Georgia”; Gladys Knight is the call
and the Pips are the response—woo woo!)
In terms of harmonic complexity, you can have everything from a single accompa-
nying voice to choruses and string sections with two and three and more voices.
The more voices you have, the more challenging it is to create distinct harmony
parts without doubling or duplicating other parts. Of course, writing a single
harmony part is also challenging, but in a different way; that single part has to
include just the right notes, suggesting the underlying chord without distracting
from the main melody.
For the purposes of learning basic theory, we’re going to concentrate on simple
two- and three-part backing harmony, without a lot of rhythmic or melodic
complexity. Once you master this type of rudimental harmony, you can expand
to include more complex types of vocal and instrumental backing.
Voicing and Inversions
The order of the notes of a chord (top to bottom) is referred to as the chord
voicing. (It’s also called the chord inversion, as you learned in Chapter 9.) Voicing
is very important when you’re writing harmony parts, because you have to
employ different voicings to avoid parallel motion between parts.

Part 5: Embellishing
Let’s consider the harmony you play as piano accompaniment. If you recall, we
used the following chord progression as an example back in Chapter 13:
190
A common chord progression that needs harmonized.
As learned back in Chapter 13, a simple block chord piano accompaniment
(right hand only) to this chord progression looks something like this:
Simple block chord harmonies.
The triads you play as accompaniment represent three-voice harmony; you just
happen to play all three voices with one hand. All the chords are in the root
(noninverted) form of 1-3-5—which represents a problem. When you change
from chord to chord, all the harmony notes move in parallel to each other. In
terms of voice leading, this is often frowned upon.
It’s also boring.
You can prove this by isolating the top note of this chord accompaniment. Now
sing the succession of top notes as if you were singing backup vocals:
Isolating the top voice in the I-vi-IV-V chord progression.
Like I said: pretty boring—and not particularly melodic, either.
A better approach is to vary the voicings of the chords so that the harmony
parts don’t have to move in parallel.
For example, you might keep the C chord in its normal root position, but
change the Am to the first inversion (C-E-A), the F to the second inversion 
(C-F-A), and the G to the first inversion (B-D-G), like this:
Inverting the chords to vary the internal voicings.

Chapter 15: Harmony and Counterpoint
191
Not only does this make the chord progression easier to play (all the notes are
closer together on the keyboard) it also makes any individual part easier to sing.
Take the top note part again: Instead of moving G-E-C-D as it did originally, it
now moves G-A-A-G, like this:
The new top voice harmony part, thanks to revoicing the chords.
The voice is fairly consistent, now; it doesn’t jump all over the place like it did
before. And if you check out the other voices, you find that they’re also a lot
more singable. (The middle voice moves E-E-F-D, and the bottom voice moves
C-C-C-B.)
When you write out each of these parts separately, you use three different
staves, like this:
The succession of root position, first inversion, second inversion is fairly
common—and one you can apply to any number of chord progressions.
(Also common is the succession of first inversion, second inversion, root
position.)
Tip
Three-voice harmony—on three different staves.
These principles apply when you’re playing piano accompaniment; they also
apply when you’re writing vocal or instrumental harmony parts. If you vary the
voicings, you open up a lot of possibilities as far as which voice goes where.

Part 5: Embellishing
192
Making Harmony Parts More Melodic
Of course, you’re not limited to having your voices follow the strict chord pat-
tern. What if we start swapping the top two notes of our harmony between two
different voices? There are lots of ways to do this, but one particularly good-
sounding one looks like this:
Swapping a few notes between the top two harmony parts.
See what we did here? We swapped the second and fourth notes between the
parts, so that the first part now goes G-E-A-D, and the second part goes E-A-
F-G. You’re still representing all the notes in the chord, but you’re making each
individual line more melodically interesting.
A good tip when you’re creating either vocal or instrumental harmony is to
physically sing each part yourself. If the part is boring or hard to sing, consider
different inversions or swapping notes between parts. The best harmony parts
sound great on their own!
Voice Leading
Voice leading is what you get when you follow one harmony part from start to
finish; the different intervals between the notes follow a set of conventions and
act to create a pseudo-melody out of the harmony line. You have to make sure
that one note properly leads to the next to avoid having the harmony line sound
like a bunch of totally unconnected tones.
It’s helpful to think
of a chord progres-
sion as nothing
more than a group
of simultaneous melodies.
This will help you create
singable harmony parts,
as opposed to parts that
correspond only to notes
within the underlying
chord structure.
Tip
If you follow these voice-leading conventions, you’ll create chord progres-
sions that sound good in both popular and classical music. When you’re
working in the popular and jazz styles, however, you’ll discover that you
can be a lot freer with your voice leading; let your ear guide you to
what works best.
Tip

Chapter 15: Harmony and Counterpoint
193
When you’re writing harmony, there are three key voice-leading conventions to
keep in mind. When you follow these conventions, the creation of harmony
parts becomes somewhat easy:
◆In general, voices should move smoothly. That means moving each voice
the shortest distance possible, and retaining common tones between suc-
cessive chords in the same voice. How big of a leap is too much? Try to
avoid leaps larger than a fourth, except in the lowest (bass) voice, which
can accept larger leaps that move along with the chord progression.
◆When at all possible, you should avoid moving all the voices in the same
direction. If some of the voices move up over the course of a line, at least
one voice should move down.
◆Avoid moving voices in parallel “perfect” intervals—fourths, fifths, or
octaves. Voices can move in parallel thirds and sixths.
Here’s an example of bad voice leading. Notice how the two parts move in par-
allel, and how each voice has huge leaps from note to note?
… corrected.
The second example shows how to fix the voice leading problems, merely by
swapping a few notes from voice to voice or by picking other notes within the
chord. It isn’t that hard when you realize that any note can be assigned to any
voice; all you have to do is pick the right notes to create the best-sounding
musical lines.

Making a Point—with Counterpoint
Counterpoint is simply the art of combining two or more simultaneous musical
lines. Unlike the art of harmony, where the harmony parts are subsidiary to the
main melody, both melodic parts in counterpoint have equal weight.
The two voices in traditional counterpoint must not only sound melodic when
played separately; they also must fit together harmonically to suggest the chord
structure of the song. That means if you play the underlying chords against the
counterpoint, the melodic lines mustn’t sound dissonant; it also means you
should be able to deduce the underlying chord structure from the melodic lines
alone.
Sounds like a tall order, doesn’t it? Creating effective counterpoint is kind of
like working with a musical puzzle, creating two melodies that not only fit with
the song’s chord progression, but also sound good when played together. Mastery
of contrapuntal technique is definitely something that separates novices from
more experienced musicians.
Key to successful counterpoint is the interaction of the different voices. (And
when I say “voices,” I mean melodic lines; counterpoint can be used in both
vocal and instrumental music.) The two lines have to work together; not fight
with each other. The second line has to be the melodic equal of the first, and
neither line should dominate.
All of this is harder to do than you might think.
Classic two-part counterpoint, courtesy of Johann Sebastian Bach—notice the independence of the two melodic lines. 
The word counter-
point comes from the Latin
punctus contra punctum,
which means “note against
note.” When a second
melodic part is added to
an existing one, the new
part is said to be “in coun-
terpoint” to the first part.
Definition
The dean of contrapuntal
writing was Johann
Sebastian Bach, although
many classical composers
utilized this particular musi-
cal form. Bach was
known for his three- and
four-part counterpoint, in
which any of the parts
could be the lead part.
Note
It’s also important that both lines be singable. That means either melody
should be able to stand on its own as a main melody against the underlying
chord progression. A melody in counterpoint should not be just a combination
of notes to fit the chords; it has to be melodic, it has to have its own internal
musical logic, and it has to fit with the other melody.
When composing melodies for counterpoint, call upon the skills you learned
back in Chapter 8. Make sure each melody has a shape and a destination, as
well as a coherent form. Also make sure each melody makes sense within the
song’s general chord structure, it fits within a comfortable vocal or instrumen-
tal range (generally no more than an octave range), and the intervals within the
melody are small and singable.

Chapter 15: Harmony and Counterpoint
When you put your two melodies together, you should make sure they both fit
within the notes of the underlying chord, and stay within the confines of the
underlying scale. The two melodies should also not duplicate each other; if you
have two identical melodies, you’re writing in unison; not in counterpoint. That
means each melody should have its own motion—which should complement,
but not interfere with, the motion of the other melody. The notes within each
melody also should not interfere or clash with the notes in the other melody;
avoid dissonant vertical intervals.
It’s okay for the two melodies to have their own rhythmic patterns. In fact, in
classical music it’s expected. (If your two melodies have identical rhythmic
structure you have what is called a 1:1 rhythmic ratio, which in some ways is
easier to work with than more rhythmically complex forms.)
Creating Your First Counterpoint
The best way to learn about counterpoint is to dive into the deep end—and
start composing!
For our first counterpoint, we’ll start by defining some parameters. These are
not necessarily hard-and-fast rules for the contrapuntal form, but they do make
it easier for beginners to create a working counterpoint.
Here are the parameters:
◆Use a 1:1 rhythmic ratio; both melodies should use the same rhythmic
patterns.
◆Only consonant harmonic intervals are allowed; no dissonant harmonies.
◆The lower part must begin and end on the tonic of the key.
◆The upper part must begin on either the first or the fifth of the key, and
end on the tonic—either in unison with the bass part or an octave above.
◆Between the melodies, rely heavily on intervals of thirds and sixths. Avoid
octaves and unisons, except for the final note.
◆Move each voice the shortest distance possible.
Now let’s get started.
Some composers like to write both melodic parts simultaneously; this enables
them to employ various advanced techniques, such as sharing a contrapuntal
melody between the two parts. However, for beginners it’s a lot easier to write
the first part first; then complete the puzzle by adding the second, counter-
point, melody.
Which is exactly what we’ll do.
We’ll start from the bottom up and create our first melody for the lower voice.
(This is the staff labeled “2,” in bass clef.) Our melody is in 3/4 time, in the key
of F Major. Because counterpoint works best when both parts have a lot of
rhythmic and melodic movement, the melody is fairly lively, with a lot of eighth
notes; it also starts and ends on the tonic note, F.
195
These general principles
are similar to the ones
established by Johann
Joseph Fux in his classic
counterpoint book Gradus
ad Parnassum (“steps to
perfection”), published in
1725. Many great com-
posers throughout history
have used this book to
learn counterpoint.
Note

Part 5: Embellishing
Now things get interesting. We need to come up with a second, higher, melody
that doesn’t clash with the lower melody—in fact, it should complement the first
melody. You can’t create this second melody in a vacuum; counterpoint is more
than just putting two unrelated melodies together. The two melodies have to fit
together logically, and have to work together to suggest the underlying chords.
So let’s start at the start. The lower part started on an F, which is the tonic of
the underlying key. According to our parameters, the upper melody can start
either on the tonic or the fifth. We don’t want to get too fancy with our first
counterpoint, so we’ll start the upper melody (the treble clef labeled “1”) on the
F two octaves higher.
In the first measure, the lower melody has a slight upward progression. To dis-
tinguish the upper melody from the lower part, we’ll give this second melody a
slight downward progression. Remember, we want the intervals between the
two voices to be pleasant-sounding, which means emphasizing the thirds and
sixths, and avoiding dissonant intervals. We also want to avoid parallel move-
ment, so we’ll leave the second note of the upper melody on F, which sounds
good against the D on the bottom. (It’s a nice minor third.)
For the third note, it’s time to introduce some motion—in this case, a down-
ward motion, to contrast with the upward motion in the lower melody. We’ll
move down from F to C, which is a nice singable fourth. It also forms a pleas-
ing minor sixth against the E in the lower melody.
The fourth and final note in the first measure also needs to show downward
movement, so we’ll continue down from C to A, an easily singable minor third.
The A also creates a pleasing major third against the F in the lower melody.
Now, if you look closely, you’ll see that not only did we introduce contrary
motion in the upper melody (down, in contrast to the upward-moving lower
melody), but we also used the upper melody to suggest the underlying chord (F
Major). The downward melody is actually an arpeggiated F Major chord, in its
first inversion (F to C to A).
196

Two melodies in
counterpoint that move in
opposite directions (one
up; the other down) are
said to have contrary
motion.

Chapter 15: Harmony and Counterpoint
What we have so far is shown here:
197
Starting to add counterpoint to the first voice.
As you can see, creating counterpoint requires a lot of logical thinking—it’s a lot
like thinking through the moves in a game of chess. The conventions are there and
it’s all very logical, but you have to work hard to make it all fit together as it should.
We’ll continue adding to the upper voice line, following the conventions note by
note. When we’re finished, we have two complete melodies, in counterpoint to
each other, like this:
Your first counterpoint!
Your first counterpoint is a good example of simple 1:1 rhythmic counterpoint. Of
course, classical counterpoint requires that the rhythms differ between the two
voices, so let’s continue to work with this example to create some rhythmic vari-
ations.
How do you introduce different rhythms into the top melody? In this example,
you can do it by essentially scooting all the notes to the left one beat. That is,
you put the eighth-note figure on beat one instead of beat two of each measure,
and extend the measure-ending quarter note into a half note.
Here’s what this looks like:
Your first counterpoint—but with different rhythms in the top melody.

Part 5: Embellishing
Note that this approach created eighth notes in the top part when the bottom
part is using quarter notes, and vice versa. This provides a simple rhythmic vari-
ation without going whole-hog on complex interrelated rhythms.
What to Avoid
Whether you’re writing harmony or counterpoint, there are certain combinations
of notes that you want to avoid. In most cases, you’ll avoid these combinations
because they don’t sound right; still, it’s good to know the conventions in advance
so you can keep from making rookie mistakes.
Avoid Extended Parallel Movement
Parallel movement is when two or more voices move in the same direction by
the exact same interval. Parallel movement is frowned upon in some types of
music—but perfectly acceptable in others. For example, in classical music you
want to avoid parallel movement in perfect fourths or fifths and octaves; in pop-
ular music, however, parallel fourths and fifths are permitted and even some-
what common—even if they do sound a little boring if carried on for too long.
In any case, if you try hard, you can generally come up with something that
sounds more interesting than extended parallel voices. Go ahead and use a little
parallel movement if you have to, but then vary things whenever possible to
keep from getting boring.
198
Avoid extended parallel movement.
Avoid Big Leaps
Whether you’re writing harmony or counterpoint, you should follow one of the
key conventions used when creating melodies—keep the intervals between
notes as small as possible. Avoid big leaps between notes; they not only sound
disconnected, they’re also hard to play and sing. As with standard voice-leading,
any interval larger than a fourth or fifth is probably too big a leap.

Chapter 15: Harmony and Counterpoint
Avoid big leaps.
Avoid Dissonant Intervals—Unless They Resolve
In this case we’re talking about the intervals between different voices—and this
is as much a practical consideration as anything else. If you’re fitting voices to
chords, you probably won’t have much in the way of dissonance to work with;
there’s nothing dissonant within an F Major chord, for example.
But what if you’re harmonizing an F Major seventh chord—in which two of the
notes are E and F, which are just a minor second apart? The voicing you want
to avoid is putting the two notes together on two close voices; for example, hav-
ing the first soprano sing the F and the second soprano sing the adjacent E. Not
only will this sound harsh; it will also be difficult for each voice to sing—the
notes are too close together. A better approach would be to put one of the notes
in a lower voice, so that there’s an octave or so space between the two notes.
199
Avoid unresolved dissonances.
The tritone is another interval to avoid in your harmony. This is simply the
hardest interval in the world to sing, or for instruments to hit. When you put a
tritone in your harmony, you’re just asking for trouble—specifically, for one of
the voices to miss the note!
Now, it’s okay to introduce this kind of dissonance, if you then resolve it. That
means you can include dissonance in passing tones, or even at the end of phrases,
but only if one of the voices then resolves to a more pleasing interval. For
example, in that F Major seventh chord, the voice with the E might quickly
resolve to either an F or a C. In the tritone example, you can move one of the
voices up or down a step to create either a perfect fifth or a third.
For some good
examples of close
harmony, listen to
some old Beach
Boys albums. Of particular
note is the classic Pet
Sounds album, which con-
tains some terrific close
harmony on songs like
“God Only Knows” and
“Wouldn’t It Be Nice.”

Realize, however, that this is one rule that’s definitely meant to be broken. There
are so many instances of close harmony out there that it’s hard to argue against
the practice. The problem is that this type of close harmony is difficult to pull
off; especially for beginners. Wait until you’re more comfortable with your har-
mony and counterpoint before you try writing voices this close together.
The Least You Need to Know
◆Harmony is a vertical combination of notes within the underlying chord
structure; counterpoint is an integrated series of horizontal melodies relat-
ing to the underlying chords.
◆Harmony is facilitated when you vary chord voicings throughout a pro-
gression.
◆Each harmony part must be singable on its own and follow established
voice leading conventions.
◆Each melody within a counterpoint should be able to function as a stand-
alone melody, and at the same time complement the other melodies.
◆Whether you’re creating harmony or counterpoint, you should generally
avoid extended movement in parallel fourths, fifths, or octaves—especially
in classical music. (Popular music typically has fewer—and looser—
conventions.)

Chord Substitutions and
Turnarounds
In This Chapter
◆Learn how to spice up boring chord progressions with extensions
◆Discover how to alter a chord’s bass note and play two chords simultaneously
◆Master the art of chord substitution
This section of the book is all about embellishing your music. You can embellish
your melody with harmony and counterpoint (as you learned in the previous
chapter); embellish individual notes (as you’ll learn in the next chapter); and
embellish your chords and chord progressions.
Which is what this chapter is all about.
Even if you’re stuck with a boring I-IV-V progression, there is still a lot you
can do to put your own personal stamp on things. For example, you don’t have
to settle for precisely those chords; you can extend the chords, alter the bass
line, and even substitute other chords for the originals. You’ll still maintain the
song’s original harmonic structure—more or less—but you’ll really jazz up the
way things sound.
All this will impress your listeners and fellow musicians. A few key chord alter-
ations and substitutions will make folks think you have the right touch—and
that you really know your music theory!
Extending a Good Thing
The simplest way to spice up a boring chord progression is to use seventh chords,
or even add a few extensions beyond that. As you learned back in Chapter 9, the
basic chord is a triad consisting of the 1-3-5 notes. When you start adding notes
on top of the triad—sevenths, ninths, and elevenths—you’re extending the
chord upward.
Chapter

Part 5: Embellishing
204
Chord extensions can make a basic chord sound lush and exotic. There’s noth-
ing like a minor seventh or major ninth chord to create a really full, harmoni-
cally complex sound.
Seventh chords—especially dominant seventh chords—are common in all types
of music today. Sixths, ninths, and other extended chords are used frequently in
modern jazz music—and in movie and television soundtracks that go for a jazzy
feel. Pick up just about any jazz record from the 1950s on, and you’ll hear lots
of extended chords. There are even a lot of rock and pop musicians—Steely
Dan comes to mind—who embrace these jazz harmonies in their music.
So why not use this technique yourself?
Here’s an example of how extended chords can make a simple chord progres-
sion sound more harmonically complex. All you have to do is take the standard
I-vi-IV-V progression in the key of C (C-Am-F-G) and add diatonic sevenths
to each triad. That produces the following progression: CM7-Am7-FM7-G7—
two major sevenths, a minor seventh, and a dominant seventh. When you play
this progression—and invert some of the chords to create a few close voicings—
you get a completely different sound out of that old workhorse progression.
And it wasn’t hard to do at all!
Seventh chords have been part of the musical vocabulary from about the seven-
teenth century. There is a tendency to use the V7 and ii7 chords as much as or
more than the triads on those degrees of the scale—even for the simplest musical
genres, such as hymns and folk songs. In the blues, it is common to use seventh
chords on every scale degree—even the tonic.
Other extended chords (ninths, elevenths, and so forth) came into widespread use
in the nineteenth century, and are still used in many forms of music today. (Chopin is
often cited as one of the first composers to extensively use extended chords.) For
example, in many jazz compositions the ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords are
used more often than triads and seventh chords.
Note
The standard I-vi-IV-V progression (in C) embellished with seventh chords (and some close 
voicings).
You can get the same effect by adding ninths and elevenths to your chords
while staying within the song’s underlying key. The more notes you add to your
chords, the more complex your harmonies—and the fuller the sound.

Chapter 16: Chord Substitutions and Turnarounds 205
Altering the Bass
Here’s another neat way to make old chords sound new—and all you have to do
is change the note on the bottom of the chord.
Back in Chapter 9 we touched briefly on the concept of slash chords, more prop-
erly called altered bass chords. With an altered bass chord, the top of the chord
stays the same; but the bass, as the name implies, is altered.
Some folks call these chords slash chords because the altered bass note is indi-
cated after a diagonal slash mark, like this: G/D. You read the chord as “G over
D,” and you play it as a G chord with a D in the bass.
Examples of slash chords.
You can use altered bass chords to achieve several different effects, including
the following:
◆By putting one of the three main notes (but not the root) in the bass, you
dictate a particular chord inversion.
◆By treating the bass note as a separate entity, you can create moving bass
lines with increased melodic interest.
◆By adding a nonchord note in the bass, you create a different chord with a
different harmonic structure.
Slash chords are used a lot in jazz, and also in more sophisticated popular
music. Listen to Carole King’s Tapestry album and you’ll hear a lot of altered
bass (she’s a big fan of the minor seventh chord with the fourth in the bass); the
same thing with a lot of Beach Boys songs, especially those on the legendary Pet
Sounds album.
Two Chords Are Better Than One
An altered bass chord uses a diagonal slash mark to separate the chord from the
bass note. When you see a chord with a horizontal line between two different
notes, like a fraction, you’re dealing with a much different beast.
This type of notation indicates that two chords are to be played simultaneously.
The chord on top of the fraction is placed on top of the pile; the chord on the 
bottom is played underneath. For example, when you see 
you know to play 
a C Major chord on top of a full G Major chord.

Part 5: Embellishing
206
Examples of compound chords.
When you play two chords together like this, you have what’s called a compound
chord. You use compound chords to create extremely complex harmonies—
those that might otherwise be too complex to note using traditional extensions.
One Good Chord Can Replace Another
When you’re faced with a boring chord progression, you may have no alterna-
tive but to substitute the chords as written with something a little less boring.
The concept of chord substitution is one that is common in jazz (those jazz musi-
cians get bored easily!) and other modern music.
Chord substitution is a simple concept. You pull a chord out of the song, and
replace it with another chord. The substitute chord should have a few things in
common with the chord it replaces, not the least of which is its place in the
song’s underlying harmonic structure. So if you replace a dominant (V) chord,
you want to use a chord that also leads back to the tonic (I). If you replace a
major chord, you want to replace it with another major chord or a chord that
uses some of the same notes as the original chord.
The key thing is to substitute an ordinary chord or progression with one that
serves the same function, but in a more interesting manner.
Diatonic Substitution
The easiest form of chord substitution replaces a chord with a related chord
either a third above or a third below the original. This way you keep two of the
three notes of the original chord, which provides a strong harmonic basis for
the new chord.
This type of substitution is called diatonic substitution, because you’re not alter-
ing any of the notes of the underlying scale; you’re just using different notes
from within the scale for the new chord.
For example, the I chord in any scale can be replaced by the vi chord (the chord a
third below) or the iii chord (the chord a third above). In the key of C, this
means replacing the C Major chord (C-E-G) with either A minor (A-C-E) or E
minor (E-G-B). Both chords share two notes in common with the C chord, so
the replacement isn’t too jarring.

Chapter 16: Chord Substitutions and Turnarounds
207
Replacing the I chord (C Major) with the vi (A minor) and the iii (E minor)—lots of notes in
common.
You can replace extended chords in the same manner, and actually end up with
more notes in common. For example, you can replace CM7 with either Am7 or
Em7, both of which have three notes in common with the original chord.
Major Chord Substitutions
Diatonic substitution is the theory; you’d probably rather know some hard-and-
fast rules you can use for real-world chord substitution. Don’t worry; they exist,
based partially on diatonic substitution theory.
The following table presents four different substitutions you can make for a
standard major chord. Remember that the root of the substitute chord must
stay within the underlying scale, even if some of the chord notes occasionally
wander about a bit.
Major Chord Substitutions
Substitution
Example (for the C Major chord)
Minor chord a third below
16FIG05
Minor 7 chord a third below
Minor chord a third above
The first substitution in the table is the standard “down a third” diatonic substi-
tution. The second substitution is the same thing, but uses an extended chord
(the minor seventh) for the substitution. The third substitution is the “up a
third” diatonic substitution, as discussed previously.
Minor Chord Substitutions
Substituting a major chord is relatively easy. So what about substituting a minor
chord?

Part 5: Embellishing
208
As you can see in the following table, some of the same substitution rules work
with minor as well as major; especially the “up a third” and “down a third” dia-
tonic substitutions.
Minor Chord Substitutions
Substitution
Example (for the A minor Chord)
Major chord a third above
Major chord a third below
Major 7 chord a third below
Diminished chord with same root
The last substitution falls into the “more of a good thing” category. That is, if a
minor chord sounds good, let’s flat another note and it’ll sound even more minor.
Some folks like the use of a diminished chord in this fashion; others don’t. Let
your ears be the judge.
Dominant Seventh Substitutions
Okay, now you know how to substitute both major and minor chords; but what
about dominant seventh chords? They’re not really major and they’re not really
minor—what kind of chords can substitute for that?
The answer requires some harmonic creativity. You can do a diatonic substitution
(using the diminished chords a third above or below the dominant seventh), but
there are more interesting possibilities, as you can see in the following table:
Dominant Seventh Chord Substitutions
Substitution
Example (for the G7 chord)
Major chord a second below
Diminished chord a third below

Chapter 16: Chord Substitutions and Turnarounds 209
Substitution
Example (for the G7 chord)
Diminished chord a third above
Minor 7 chord a fourth below—
over the same root
The more interesting substitutions here are the first one and the last one. The
first substitution replaces the V7 chord with a IV chord; the use of the sub-
dominant (IV) chord results in a softer lead back to the I chord. The last 
substitution uses an altered chord, so that you’re leading back to tonic with a
iim7/V—what I like to call a “Carole King chord.” (That’s because Ms. King
uses this type of harmonic structure a lot in her songwriting.) So if you’re in the
key of C, instead of ending a phrase with a G or G7 chord, you end with a
Dm7/G instead. It’s a very pleasing sound.
Functional Substitutions
Here’s something else to keep in mind. Within the harmonic context of a com-
position, different chords serve different functions. The three basic harmonic
functions are those of the tonic, subdominant, and dominant—typically served
by the I, IV, and V chords, respectively. But other chords in the scale can serve
these same functions, even if not as strongly as the I, IV, and V.
For example, the subdominant function can be served by either the ii, IV, or vi
chords. The dominant function can be served by either the V or vii° chords.
And the tonic function can be served by either the I, iii, or vi chords. All these
functions are shown in the following table:
Chord Function
Chords
Tonic
I, iii, vi
Subdominant
ii, IV, vi
Dominant
V, vii°
When you have a chord serving a specific function in a composition, you can
replace it with another chord of the same type. So if you have a IV chord, serv-
ing a subdominant function, you can substitute any of the other subdominant-
functioning chords—the ii or the vi. Along the same lines, if you have a ii
chord, you can replace it with either the IV or the vi.
The same thing goes with the other functions. If you have a V chord, serving a
dominant function, you can replace it with a vii° chord—or vice versa. And a I
chord, serving a tonic function, can be replaced by either a iii or a vi chord—
and also vice versa. It’s actually a fairly easy way to make some simple chord
substitutions.
Just in case you think you
found a mistake in the pre-
ceding table, the vi chord
can serve both the tonic
and subdominant func-
tions. It’s a very versatile
chord!

Turnarounds
Chapter 10 also presented a concept of the phrase-ending cadence. Well, in the
fields of jazz and popular music, you find a similar concept called a turnaround.
A turnaround typically is a two-bar phrase, with two chords per measure, that
functions much the same as a traditional cadence, “turning around” the music
to settle back on the I chord at the start of the next phrase.
There is a wide variety of chord combinations you can use to create an ear-
pleasing turnaround, some of which go outside the underlying key to circle
back around to the tonic.
Here are just a few you might want to try:

Note that some of these outside-the-key chords take traditionally minor chords
and make them major, so pay close attention to the uppercase and lowercase
notation in the table. (For example, the III chord is an E Major chord in the
key of C; not the expected E minor.)
Also pay attention to flat signs before a chord; this indicates to play the chord a
half step lower than normal. For example, a ♭vi chord in the key of C is a half
step lower than the standard A minor vi chord, which results in the A♭minor
chord instead.
You can use these turnarounds in any of the songs you write or arrange. It’s an
easy way to add harmonic sophistication to your music, just by changing a few
chords at the end of a phrase!
The Least You Need to Know
◆When you don’t want to play a boring old chord progression, you can use
one of several techniques to make the chord progression sound more har-
monically sophisticated.
◆The easiest way to spice up a chord progression is to change triads to sev-
enth chords or extended chords (such as sixths, ninths, elevenths, or thir-
teenths), and add sevenths and other extensions to the basic chords.
◆Another way to change the sound of a chord is to alter the bass note—to
either signal a different inversion, or to introduce a slightly different har-
monic structure.
◆Substituting one chord for another also can make a chord progression
more interesting. The most common chord substitutions are diatonic, in
which you replace a chord with the diatonic chord either a third above or
below the original chord.
◆You can also perform a chord substitution based on chord function. Any
chord fulfilling a tonic, subdominant, or dominant function can be re-
placed by any other chord fulfilling the same function.
◆You can add interest to a chord progression by introducing a two-measure
turnaround at the end of the main phrase; these chords circle around and
lead back to the I chord at the start of the next phrase.

There are some aspects of music theory that don’t fit neatly within traditional
categories. Still, you need to know about them, so I have to include them some-
where in this book.
That somewhere is this chapter. It’s kind of a grab bag of more advanced tech-
niques, mainly relating to notation, that you need to have at your fingertips—
even if you won’t use them every day.
So settle back and read about some of the oddball aspects of music theory, and
that popular musical style we call swing.
Throwing a Curve
When you’re writing music, you sometimes need to connect two or more notes
together. You might literally connect them together to form a single, longer
note; or you might simply want them played together as a smooth phrase. In
any case, whenever you connect two or more notes together, you use a notation
effect that looks like a big curve—and is called, alternately, either a tie or a slur.
Ties
You learned about ties back in Chapter 5. When two notes of the same pitch
are tied together—either in the same measure, or across measures—the notes
are played as a single note.
Chapter

Part 5: Embellishing
216
A tie is made with a small curve, either above or below the note, like this:
Two identical notes tied together equal one long note.
Slurs
A slur looks like a tie between two notes of different pitches, but really indicates
that the notes are to be played together as a continuous group. Although you
can’t play two different tones as a continuous note, you can run them together
without a breath or a space in between. This is called “slurring” the notes
together; it looks like this:
Lots of notes grouped together are played as a smooth phrase.
Often, wind instruments (trumpets, clarinets, and so forth) base their breathing
on the song’s phrases. They’ll blow during the phrase and breathe between the
phrase marks.
Bowed instruments (violins, cellos, and so forth) use phrases to time their bowing.
They’ll use a single, continuous movement of the bow for the duration of the
phrase; at the end of the phrase mark, they’ll change the direction of their bowing.
Two different notes tied together are slurred together.
There’s a subtle difference between two notes that are slurred together and two
notes that aren’t. The notes without the slur should each have a separate attack,
which ends up sounding like a slight emphasis on each note. The second of the
two slurred notes doesn’t have a separate attack, so the sound is much smoother
as you play from note to note.
Phrases
When you see a curved line above several adjacent notes, it’s not a slur—it’s a
phrase. You use phrase marks to indicate separate ideas within a longer piece of
music. When one idea ends, you end the phrase mark; when a new idea begins,
you start a new phrase mark.
The curved line
used in a slur is called a
slur mark.
Definition
Technically, a phrase mark
indicates that a passage
of music is played
legato—which means to
play smoothly.

The Long and the Short of It
Back in Chapter 7, you learned about some of the embellishments you can make
to individual notes—accents, marcatos, and so on. There are a few more marks
you can add to your notes; they’re presented here.
Tenuto
A straight horizontal line over a note means to play the note for its full dura-
tion. In other words, stretch it out for as long as possible.
This mark is called a tenuto mark, and it looks like this:
The tenuto mark means to play a long note.
Staccato
The opposite of a long note is a short note; the opposite of tenuto is staccato. A
dot on top of a note means do not play it for its full duration; just give it a little
blip and get off it.
A staccato mark looks like this:
The staccato mark means to play a short note.
When Is a Note More Than a Note?
There are other marks you can add to your notes that indicate additional notes
to play. These notes are kind of musical shorthand you can use in place of writ-
ing out all those piddly smaller notes.
Grace Notes
A grace note is a short note you play in front of a main note. In mathematical
terms, a grace note might have the value of a sixteenth or a thirty-second note,
depending on the tempo of the music. Basically, you play the grace note just
ahead of the main note, at a slightly lower volume level. When you note a grace
note, write it as a smaller note just in front of the main note, like this:
Drummers call a grace
note a flam, because (on
a drum) that’s what it
sounds like—”fa-lam!”
Note

Part 5: Embellishing
218
A grace note is like a little preview note before the main note.
Grace notes are typically written as small eighth notes, with a line drawn through
the stem and flag. The grace note can be on the same tone as the main note, or
on an adjoining tone. (You play whatever note the grace note is on.)
Turns
A turn is an ornament used primarily in Baroque and classical music. In a turn
the neighboring notes turn to the main note, “turning it around.”
Let’s look at how a turn works: When you see the turn mark (which looks like a
line turned around on itself), you play the diatonic note above the main note,
then the main note, then the note a step below the main note, and then the
main note again. Here’s how it looks on paper, and how you play it in practice:
A turn “turns around” the main note.
When you’re playing a turn, you have a bit of latitude for how fast you actually
play it. You can play a turn as written in the example, as a pure mathematical
subset of the note’s noted duration; or you can whip through the turn really
quickly, landing back on the main pitch until the note is done. It’s all a matter
of interpretation.
Trills
A trill is a way to extend a single note by alternating between two neighboring
tones. In particular, you alternate between the main note and the note one step
above, like this:
If you’re unsure
how to play a turn
in a piece of
music, ask your
conductor for the proper
interpretation.
Tip
Play a trill with a whole bunch of neighboring notes.
As with turns, there are many different ways to play a trill. The most common
approach is to alternate between the two notes as rapidly as possible, although
technically a trill can have a preparation in which you play the main note straight
before you enter into the “shake.” (You can also terminate the trill—or just trill
right into the next note.)

Chapter 17: Special Notation
219
Glissandos
Whereas turns and trills alternate between two or three neighboring notes, a
glissando packs a lot more notes into a short space. To be precise, a glissando is 
a mechanism for getting from one pitch to another, playing every single pitch
between the two notes as smoothly as possible.
Depending on the instrument, a glissando can be a continuous glide between
the two notes (think trombone) or a run of sequential chromatic notes (think
piano). Glissandi (not glissandos!) can move either up or down; typically, both
the starting and ending notes are specified, like this:
On the piano, you can
also “cheat” a glissando
by playing only the white
keys between the top and
bottom tones—which lets
you play a glissando with
a stroke of your hand.
Note
Glissando up—and down.
Arpeggiated Chords
When you want an instrument to play a chord as an arpeggio, but you don’t
want to write out all the notes, you can use the symbol called the role. The role
indicates that the instrument is to play an arpeggio—but a rather quick one.
This squiggly line tells the musician to play the written notes from bottom to
top, in succession, and to hold each note as it is played. The effect should be
something like a harp playing an arpeggiated chord, like this:
The quick and easy way to notate an arpeggiated accompaniment.
Getting Into the Swing of Things
The last bit of notation I want to discuss concerns a feel. If you’ve ever heard
jazz music, particularly big band music, you’ve heard this feel; it’s called swing.
Traditional popular music has a straight feel; eighth notes are played straight,
just as they’re written. Swing has a kind of triplet feel; it swings along, all
bouncy, percolating with three eighth notes on every beat.
What’s that, you’re saying—three eighth notes on every beat? How is that possible?
It’s possible because swing is based on triplets. Instead of having eight eighth
notes in a measure of 4/4, you have twelve eighth notes—four eighth-note
triplets. So instead of the basic beat being straight eighths, the first and third
beat of every triplet combine for a spang-a-lang-a-lang-a-lang kind of rhythm.

Part 5: Embellishing
220
What’s confusing is that instead of notating swing as it’s actually played (with
triplets), most swing music uses straight eighth notation—which you’re then
expected to translate into the triplet-based swing.
So if you’re presented a swing tune and you see a bunch of straight eighths, you
should play them with a triplet feel instead, like this:
In swing, straight eighths are played with a triplet feel.
Some arrangers try to approximate the swing feel within a straight rhythm by
using dotted eighth notes followed by sixteenth notes, like this:
In swing, dotted eights and sixteenths are played with a triplet feel.
Whatever you do, don’t play this precisely as written! Again, you have to trans-
late the notation and play the notes with a triplet feel.
The swing feel is an important one, and you find it all over the place. Swing is
used extensively in jazz music, in traditional blues music, in rock shuffles, and in
all manner of popular music old and new. Learning how to swing takes a bit of
effort; it’s normal to play the stiff dotted-eighth/sixteenth rhythm instead of the
rolling triplets when you’re first starting out. But that effort is worth it—a lot of
great music is based on that swinging feel.
Getting the Word
Before we end this chapter, let’s take a look at one other notation challenge:
how to add words to your music.
Notating lyrics is something that all songwriters have to do, and it isn’t that
hard—if you think logically. Naturally, you want to align specific words with
specific notes in the music. More precisely, you want to align specific syllables
with specific notes.
This sometimes requires a bit of creativity on your part. You might need to split
up words into awkward-looking syllables. You also might need to extend sylla-
bles within words where a note is held for an extended period of time. This
requires a lot of hyphens in the lyrics, as you can see in the following example:

Chapter 17: Special Notation
221
Notating lyrics; split words in syllables, and extended syllables.
Just remember to position your lyrics underneath the music staff. If you have
multiple verses, write each verse on a separate line; then break each word into
its component syllables and carefully match up each syllable with the proper
musical note.
The Least You Need to Know
◆Curved marks are used to tie identical notes together, slur neighboring
notes together, and indicate complete musical phrases.
◆A dot above a note means to play it short (staccato); a line above a note
means to play it long (tenuto).
◆You play grace notes lightly and quickly before the main note.
◆Turns and trills ornament a main note by the use of rapidly played neigh-
boring notes.
◆A glissando indicates a smooth glide from one pitch to another.
◆Swing music is played with a rolling triplet feel; not straight eighth notes.
◆Lyrics must be broken down into syllables to fit precisely with notes in the
music.

◆Learn about the different voices in the choir—and all the instruments in
the orchestra
◆Discover the playable (and singable) ranges of each instrument and voice
◆Uncover the best—and the worst—keys to write in
◆Find out which instruments don’t sound in concert pitch—and how to

You know the theory; now it’s time to put that theory to practice.
The most common application of music theory comes when you compose or
arrange a piece of music for multiple voices or instruments. That could be a
simple presentation for your church choir, a new song for your rock band, a
sophisticated piece for your high school jazz band, or a multipart symphony for
a full orchestra.
Whatever size group you’re writing for, you have to deal with the same issues of
theory, and call on the same set of skills. You also have to know a little bit about
the ranges of each instrument or voice, and how each instrument will play the
notes you write.
This chapter deals with the particular skills necessary for vocal and instrumental
arranging. I recommend you bookmark this chapter; if you do a lot of arrang-
ing, you’ll find the information about ranges and transposition very useful!
Vocal Arranging
A vocal ensemble is probably the easiest type of group to arrange for. That’s
because all the voices reproduce exactly what you write, with absolutely no
transposition. (Well, except for the fact that the tenor voice sounds an octave
lower than written—but that’s an easy one to deal with.)
Chapter

Part 6: Arranging
226
Voice Characteristics
When you’re writing for a choir, you have to know the voices that are available
at your disposal. In general, you have two female voices and two male voices,
with an optional third male voice to work with.
◆Soprano
This is the highest female voice. The soprano typically sings
the lead part, as the highest voice naturally stands out from the rest. Some
sopranos can sing quite high, although you might want to avoid the very
upper reaches of the range; these high parts often sound shrill, especially
with younger or less-experienced singers.
◆Alto
The alto is the lower female voice, with a deep and resonant tone.
The alto range overlaps the soprano range, but know that an alto will
sound strained at the top of her range—just as a soprano will sound
strained at the bottom of hers.
◆Tenor
The tenor is the highest male voice; it overlaps significantly with
the range of the female alto. Tenor parts are written in treble clef, but
actually sound an octave lower than written.
◆Baritone
The baritone is an optional male part; most choruses don’t
have separate baritone lines. The baritone falls smack between the tenor
and the bass, but typically has more of a bass-like sound—without the very
low notes.
◆Bass
The bass is the lowest male voice. It’s natural to assign bass notes
to the bass voice, which works out okay most of the time. At the low end
of the bass range, the sound gets a tad rumbly.
Vocal Ranges
It’s important that you write vocal parts that can actually be sung. It’s no good
to write a bass part that sounds forced—if the poor fellow can hit the note at
all.
For that reason, pay close attention to the ranges listed in the following table
and stick within these ranges when writing your vocal parts.

Instrumental Arranging
When you move on to instrumental arranging, you have a lot of different
instruments at your disposal. You need to know a little bit about how each
instrument works; in particular the range of the instrument and whether it
sounds in concert pitch or is somehow transposed.
Instrument Characteristics
Instruments are typically organized into several major groups. For our purposes,
we’ll look at strings (both bowed and plucked), brass, woodwinds, keyboards,
and percussion.
Strings
When you think of stringed instruments, you typically think of the violin and its
close cousins: the viola, cello, and double bass (sometimes called the string bass
or upright bass). Each of these instruments works on the same principle, with
four strings stretched over a hollow body. Music is made when a bow is pushed
and pulled over the strings, or when the strings are plucked.
The highest string voice is the violin, followed (in descending order) by the
viola, cello, and double bass. The violin is written with the treble clef, cello and
double bass use the bass clef, and the viola—the oddball of the group—uses the
alto clef, as shown in the following figure. (Remember: The pointy part of the
alto clef points at C.)
On a symphonic
score (discussed in
Chapter 19), the
instruments are dis-
played in the following
top-to-bottom order: wood-
winds, brass, percussion,
special instruments (like
piano or harp), and,
finally, strings.
Tip
The alto clef; used primarily by the viola.

Part 6: Arranging
228
Guitars and Other Plucked Instruments
The guitar is technically part of the string family, although most folks differen-
tiate it from the violin-type instrument. That’s because the guitar is never
bowed; it’s always plucked or strummed. (The guitar also has six strings, com-
pared to the four strings of the violin instruments.)
There are several other instruments that fit within the guitar category. The
mandolin and ukulele are smaller and higher pitched than the guitar, whereas
the electric bass is more like a traditional double bass, but in a guitar-like con-
figuration with just four strings.
Guitars, of course, can be either acoustic or electric—and the electric ones can
have either solid or hollow bodies. The different configurations produce different
types of sound, although the notation is the same for all the different guitars.
Guitar parts can be notated with notes on staves or, if you just want a strummed
rhythm, by using chord notation. You can also spell out the fingering of each
chord by using guitar tablature, as shown in the following.
Guitar tabs can 
be automatically
derived from tradi-
tional chord nota-
tion when you use a
computerized music nota-
tion program, such as those
discussed in Chapter 19.
Tip
Guitar tablature.
Oh, and while we’re talking about plucking strings, we can’t forget the harp.
The harp isn’t really a guitar (it’s kind of like a piano, but more vertical), but it
does work when you pluck its strings.
Woodwinds
Some woodwinds are made of brass; some are made of wood. But all (except the
flute) use a wooden reed to produce their sound; you put the reed in your mouth
and blow until it vibrates.
The flute produces sound when you blow across an open hole; kind of like blow-
ing across a soda bottle. But it’s still classified as part of the woodwind family,
probably because it has a similar valve structure and fingering for determining
individual notes.
There are lots of different woodwind instruments. You have flutes and piccolos;
at least four different types of saxophones; a variety of clarinets; those odd-
sounding oboes and bassoons; and even the not-so-common English horn
(which isn’t a horn and isn’t even English—it’s an alto version of the oboe).
Woodwind instruments primarily use the treble clef, although the bassoon and
contrabassoon both use the bass clef.

Chapter 18: Composing and Arranging for Voices and Instruments
229
Brass
Brass instruments typically are made of brass. However, so are saxophones and
cymbals and timpani, and they’re not part of the brass family; so that really isn’t
a good indicator, is it? Nope, what makes brass instruments unique is that length
of brass tubing wound up into a tight little package, the open mouthpiece you
blow into, and the three or four valves you use (in conjunction with changing
the shape of your lips) to create different tones.
The trumpet is the brash and annoying younger brother of the brass family, 
the trombone is the more stable older brother, and the tuba is the not-always-
serious uncle. Also hanging around is the weird foreign relation, the French
horn; and a few other unusual relatives, such as the baritone. All in all, it’s a
rather loud and brassy bunch—pun intended.
Brass instruments use either the treble or bass clefs, depending on their predom-
inant pitch.
Keyboards
Depending on whom you ask, keyboard instruments are really string instruments
or percussion instruments. In reality, they’re a little of both. The sounds are
produced by internal strings, which are struck by tiny hammers—much like per-
cussion instruments are struck.
There are many different types of keyboards, and they all have fairly wide
ranges. The piano, of course, is the big dog, but you can’t forget about organs,
or harpsichords, or any number of electronic synthesizers. A full piano has 88
keys; some smaller instruments can have shorter keyboards. Without exception,
all modern keyboard instruments sound in concert pitch.
Percussion
When you talk percussion, you’re talking about a lot of different instruments.
Percussion instruments make noise when you hit them or shake them, so the
family includes everything from snare drums and cymbals to marimbas and tim-
pani. Most percussion instruments are of indefinite pitch—that is, although they
make a noise when you hit them (or shake them), that noise isn’t associated with
a specific pitch. Other percussion instruments, such as timpani and the mallet
family, do produce a definite pitch (or pitches).
When you’re writing for an indefinite pitch instrument, you don’t have to follow
standard staff notation. For example, when you write for drum set, you assign
different parts of the staff to different drums and cymbals in the set. In the fol-
lowing example, the bass drum is the bottom space on the staff; the snare drum
is the third space up. Cymbals are at the top, notated by X-shaped note heads.
Writing for drum set.

Part 6: Arranging
230
Of course, you can save yourself a lot of time and trouble by just telling the
drummer how many measures there are in each section of your song and letting
him (or her) make up his (or her) own part. That’s particularly common when
you’re arranging for a rock or jazz band.
Transposition
Many instruments read one note and play another—at least compared to con-
cert pitch (the actual notes as played on a piano). For example, a trumpet reads
a C but sounds a B♭. These so-called transposing instruments need to have their
music transposed to a different key to play in the same concert key as all the
other instruments.
Let’s take the trumpet again. Because the trumpet always sounds a major second
lower than written, you need to write the trumpet part a major second (two half
steps) higher than the pitch you actually want to hear. So if you want the trum-
pet to play a concert C, you have to write a D; the trumpet reads D, sounds C,
and everything is right with the world.
You learned about transposition back in Chapter 14, and you’ll need to apply
those skills here. That’s because there are a lot of instruments that don’t play in
concert key; all the following instruments need their parts transposed.
Most transposing instruments fall into three groups, and are named according
to how they relate to C:
◆B♭instruments, like the trumpet, sound a major second below their writ-
ten pitch. That is, they’re written a major second above the concert pitch.
So if one of these instruments plays a C, it comes out sounding as B♭in
concert pitch.
◆E♭instruments, like the alto sax, sound a major sixth below (or a minor
third above) their written pitch. That is, they’re written a major sixth
above the concert pitch. So if one of these instruments plays a C, it comes
out sounding as E♭in concert pitch.
◆F instruments, such as the French horn, sound a perfect fifth below their
written pitch. That is, they’re written a perfect fifth above the concert
pitch. So if one of these instruments plays a C, it comes out sounding as F
in concert pitch.
The following table details which instruments fall into which group:

With a few exceptions, instruments not listed here are nontransposing—that is,
what they play sounds exactly as written, in concert pitch. The best example of
a nontransposing instrument is the piano; you read middle C, you play middle
C, the piano sounds middle C—no transposing necessary.
What does all this mean in terms of actual transposition? The next table details
how each type of instrument transposes each of the possible concert keys. The
key listed for each instrument is the key that you write for that instrument in
order to sound the concert key. (For example, for the concert key of C, you
would write a B♭instrument in the key of D, an E♭instrument in the key of A,
and an F instrument in the key of G.)

Note

Part 6: Arranging
232
As you learned in Chapter 14, all of today’s music notation programs will auto-
matically perform this transposition for you, saving you the trouble of transpos-
ing all the instruments manually. With a program like Finale or Sibelius, you
can write the entire piece in concert pitch and then have the program create
individual output in the instruments’ transposed pitch. Easy!
Good Keys and Bad Keys
Because of the need to transpose the nonconcert key instruments, you can end
up with some instruments reading a whole bunch of sharps and flats, which of
course is problematic. For example, the concert key of A has three sharps, and is
relatively easy for nontransposing instruments to read. But for B♭instruments,
such as trumpets, the transposed key is B, which has five sharps and is a bear to
read. For that reason, you probably want to avoid composing in the concert key
of A—unless you want to give your trumpet section a real workout!
In general, you want to arrange things so no instrument is reading more than
three sharps or flats. Taking this challenge into account, the following table
shows the best—and the worst—keys to compose in:

Instrumental Ranges
Just as with voices, each instrument has its own particular range. There are cer-
tain notes that a trumpet, for example, just can’t play.
For that reason, you need to know the playable range for each instrument in the
orchestra, which is where the following table comes in. For each instrument
There are actually many more transpositions than listed in this table, especially
among the instruments used in classical music. For example, trumpets in D were
very often used by Mozart, Haydn, and other composers of their time.
One of the reasons for these different transpositions is that early trumpets and
horns had no valves, so there were only a limited number of notes available on
them. A composer would then choose a transposition that gave him the best
selection of available notes for each instrument.
Note
The notation 8va means to
play the note an octave
above what’s written. The
notation 8vb means to
play the note an octave
below what’s written.

The Least You Need to Know
◆In descending order, the four main voices in the choir are soprano, alto,
tenor, and bass (SATB).
◆The main families of instruments are strings (both bowed and plucked),
woodwind, brass, keyboards, and percussion.
◆Transposing instruments don’t sound in concert pitch; they sound a speci-
fied interval above or below the written note. Their parts must be trans-
posed so that the note they play is the proper note in concert pitch.
◆B♭instruments (trumpet, clarinet, and soprano and tenor saxes) sound a
major second lower than concert pitch; E♭instruments (alto and baritone
saxes) sound a major sixth lower than concert pitch; and F instruments
(English horn and French horn) sound a perfect fifth lower than concert
pitch.

The topic of orchestration is a big one; if you’re serious about it, there’s a lot you
need to know about all the different instruments and voices. If you’re interested in
learning more, there are two very good books I can recommend. 
Samuel Adler’s The Study of Orchestration (W.W. Norton & Company, 3rd
Edition 2002) is an extremely comprehensive guide to classical and modern
orchestration, one used by many college orchestration classes. And Henry
Mancini’s Sounds and Scores: A Practical Guide to Professional Orchestration
(Northridge Music Inc., 1973) is an easy-to-read, extremely practical guide to
jazz and popular music arranging, from the composer of the Pink Panther theme
and tons of other movie scores. Both these books will teach you a lot more about
orchestration than I can in this short chapter.
If you’re interested in arranging for big bands or jazz ensembles, there are two
other books that make my list—and happen to be the two books that I personally
learned from, back in the day. These books are David Baker’s Arranging and
Composing for the Small Ensemble (Alfred Publishing, 1970; revised edition 1988)
and Dick Grove’s Arranging Concepts Complete (Alfred Publishing, 1972; sec-
ond edition 1989). Both books are still in print, and still very useful.

Lead Sheets and Scores
In This Chapter
◆Create clear and readable written music
◆Understand the differences between lead sheets, chord sheets, and scores
◆Learn how to create a full score for choir, big band, or orchestra
◆Explore easy-to-use music notation software for your computer
Once you’ve written a piece of music, you need to present it in a way that other
musicians can easily read. There are many different approaches to creating
written music; which ones you use depends in part on the type of music you’ve
written and who will be playing it.
If you’ve written a song for a rock or country band, the music you write can be
fairly simple—chords and melody will generally suffice. If, on the other hand,
you’ve written a full-blown symphony (good for you!), you’ll need to create a
detailed score containing the individual parts for each and every instrument in
the orchestra.
Whatever type of written music you create, you need to keep it neat and make
it easily understandable. Musicians have to be able to read the music at first pass
(called sight reading), which means it helps to follow certain established parame-
ters. There’s no point in being unique if nobody can read your music!
Follow the Rules
Whatever type of music you prepare, you need to follow certain notation
rules—guidelines, actually, since they’re not set in stone. These guidelines
include the following:
◆The first instance of each staff for each instrument or voice must have its
own clef sign, key signature, and time signature.
◆Typically, the time signature is shown only in the very first measure—and
wherever a time change appears.
Chapter

Part 6: Arranging
242
◆Each instrument should be clearly marked at the beginning of each staff.
(The first instance typically has the full instrument name spelled out; sub-
sequent staves can use abbreviations.)
◆In band and orchestral scores, group like instruments together (all the
trumpets together, for example).
◆For instruments that use the grand staff (both bass and treble clef), group
the two staves by using braces.
◆Measure lines should be drawn through all the instruments belonging to
the same section—but not through all the instruments in the score.
◆If you want, you can combine all like instruments on a single staff (all the
trumpet parts on one staff, for example).
◆If an instrument or voice will be resting for an extended period of time,
you don’t have to include the staff for that instrument or voice during the
rest period.
◆Use letter markings to notate individual sections of the music. (For ease of
reading, letter markings are typically enclosed in a box or circle.)
◆Number your measures—or at least the first measure of every line.
(Alternately, you can insert a number mark every 5 or 10 measures.)
It goes without saying that the music you create should also be readable. If you’re
writing it all out by hand, make sure you produce clear and distinct notes, and
they’re easily distinguishable on the staff. If you have poor penmanship (like I
do!), consider taking a calligraphy course to improve your handwriting, or use a
computerized music notation program to create great-looking music on your
computer printer. (See the “Use the Computer” section later in this chapter.)
These rules apply to the score you compose and that the conductor uses. As for
the music that the musicians themselves read, you have to create individual
parts for each instrument. (This is not a requirement for vocal scores.) So if
you’ve written a piece for a big band, you have to create a separate first trumpet
part, and a separate second trumpet part, and a separate third trumpet part, and
so on. When you write out the individual parts, include only that instrument’s
part—the conductor is the only person who gets to see all the parts together on
the master score.
Take the Lead
The most common form of written music is the lead sheet. A lead sheet doesn’t
include any individual instrumental parts; all you get is the song’s melody,
chords, and lyrics.
As you can see in the example on page 244, a typical lead sheet consists of one
staff for the melody line, with lyrics under the staff and chords above it.
Lead sheets are simple to create, and they’re ideal for notating popular songs. If
you play in a rock or country band (or even a jazz trio or quartet), you can use
lead sheets to present much of the music you play.
The master piece
of music—the one that
contains all the individual
parts—is called the score.
Definition
A lead sheet is
not commercial sheet
music. Sheet music typi-
cally includes full piano
parts, whereas lead sheets
contain melody and
chords only. In addition,
lead sheets are not avail-
able commercially, unlike
sheet music.
Warning

Chapter 19: Lead Sheets and Scores
243
Make It Simple
Even simpler than the lead sheet is a piece of music that contains only chords;
no melody lines and no lyrics. There are two different approaches to this type
of music, and we’ll look at both.
Chord Sheets
The chord sheet is just what it sounds like: a sheet of music containing only the
chords of a song (see the example on page 245). The chords are presented
measure by measure, so that members of the rhythm section (piano, bass, and
guitar) can play through the song with minimal effort.
The Nashville Number System
In the field of country music, especially among studio musicians, a different
type of chord sheet is used. This method of writing chords is called the
Nashville Number System, and it uses numbers instead of letters.
In the Nashville Number System, everything revolves around the tonic chord of
a given key. That tonic chord is assigned the number 1. The chord based on the
ii of the key—a minor chord—is assigned the number 2m (The m tells the musi-
cian it’s a minor chord.) The chord based on the iii of the key—also a minor
chord—is assigned the number 3m. And so on up the scale, up to chord number 7.
As you can see, major chords are distinguished by number only; minor chords
have an m added. Extensions are added as superscripts to the right of the num-
ber, so that a dominant seventh chord based on the fifth of the scale is noted as 57.
A chord chart using the Nashville Number System looks something like the
example on page 246.
Because the Nashville Number System doesn’t use traditional notes, it is ideal
for musicians who don’t know how to read music. It also makes it very easy to
change key—just play the 1 or 2 or 3, or whatever chord in whatever key you
want; it’s as easy as that.
Sing It Loud
Arranging for choirs is a bit more complicated than sketching out chords for a
rock band. Choral music normally has four or five parts, and each part has to
have its own line in the score.
Let’s look at a typical four-part choral score (see the example on page 247). The
parts are arranged with the highest voice (soprano) at the top, and the lowest
voice (bass) at the bottom. The four vocal parts (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass)
are grouped together with braces, and a piano accompaniment is included below
the vocal parts. The top three parts use the treble clef; the bass line uses the
bass clef. Lyrics are included below each staff.
If you prepare a
chord sheet using a
music notation pro-
gram, you may
choose to include guitar
tablature in addition to the
standard chord symbols.
This is particularly useful if
you’re writing for beginning-
level guitarists.
Tip
The Nashville Number
System is very much like
the Roman numeral nota-
tion system, except it uses
regular numbers (1, 2, 3)
instead of Roman numer-
als (I, II, III).
Note

Part 6: Arranging
244
When you create a choral score—or any score with multiple parts, for that
matter—make sure a measure within one part aligns vertically with the same
measure in all the other parts. In fact, the notes within each measure also
should align between parts. If it helps, use a ruler to help keep the notes in
alignment when you’re writing the score.
Charts for choruses are
sometimes called SATB
scores, for the soprano,
alto, tenor, and bass parts.
Note
If there are addi-
tional backing
instruments, they
can also be
included in the score—
below the vocals, just like
the piano part.

Jazz It Up for Big Bands
Another popular ensemble—particularly among high school and college 
musicians—is the big band, or jazz band. A typical jazz band includes a lot of
instruments, which results in a fairly large piece of music. For example, whereas
a choral score might get two groups of staves on a page, a jazz band score typi-
cally takes a whole page just to display all the different instruments.

Part 6: Arranging
248
What instruments are we talking about? The typical big band has some or all of
the following, listed from top to bottom on the score:
◆Woodwinds: Flute (sometimes played by a sax player), soprano sax (some-
times played by an alto or tenor sax player), one to three alto saxes, one to
three tenor saxes, one or two baritone saxes
◆Brass: Three to five trumpets, three to five trombones
◆Rhythm section: Guitar, piano, bass, drums, other percussion (such as
congas or tambourine)
That’s a lot of instruments to put on a single page! But, as you can see in the
example on page 249, they all fit.
When you create a big band score, you have a choice of how you deal with
transposing instruments. You can create a concert key score, with all instru-
ments written in concert key; if you take this approach, you have to make sure
you transpose the individual parts when you create them. Alternately, you can
create a transposed score in which each instrument is written in its transposed
key; this type of score might be harder for the conductor to read, but it more
accurately represents what the musicians see on their individual parts.
Creating parts for the rhythm section is particularly interesting. In most cases you
can use slash notation and indicate the chord changes, but you don’t have to create
fully realized parts. The big exception to this is when you have important rhythms
that you want the rhythm section to reinforce; you can note these rhythms using
slash notes, as shown in the fifth measure of the example on page 250.
Strike Up the (Concert) Band
An even bigger band to write for is the concert band. Unlike a jazz band, a con-
cert band includes virtually all the brass and woodwind instruments, along with
a full percussion section—snare drums, bass drums, timpani, marimba, and so
forth. A concert band is almost like an orchestra, but without strings.
Concert bands evolved from traditional marching bands. Not only did the musi-
cians get to sit down, the instrumentation was also augmented from the slightly
more Spartan marching ensembles.
When you’re writing a concert band score, you include the following groups of
instruments, in top-to-bottom order:
◆Woodwinds: Piccolo, flute, oboe, English horn, clarinet, alto clarinet, bass
clarinet, bassoon, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone 
◆Brass: Cornet, trumpet, French horn, trombone, bass trombone, baritone
horn, tuba
◆Percussion: Timpani, percussion (with separate staves for snare drum,
bass drum, and so on)
The example on page 251 shows a typical concert band score. As with jazz band
scores, concert band scores can be in either concert key or transposed.
In all band and orchestral
scores, like instruments are
typically grouped together
in systems. In a system,
the individual staves are
joined together, to make it
easier to view the instru-
ments as a group.

A marching band has similar instrumentation to a concert band, minus the follow-
ing instruments: oboe, English horn, bassoon, alto clarinet, cornet, bass trom-
bone, and various concert percussion instruments. One popular variation of the
traditional marching band is the drum and bugle corps (sometimes just called
drum corps). This is typically a smaller ensemble emphasizing brass and percus-
sion instruments—and precision marching routines.

Make the Big Score—for the Symphonic
Orchestra
Now we’re in the big leagues. Creating a score for full orchestra is a major
undertaking, if for no other reason than there are many instruments to deal
with. Because of this, most orchestra scores are written on large sheets of
paper—11" x 17" or so. Because of the sheer size of the beast, you’ll probably
get only four to eight measures on each page, which means the typical orches-
tral score also is fairly long.
As you can see from the example on page 251, instrument families are grouped
together in the score in the following order:
◆Woodwinds: Piccolo, flute (first and second), oboe (first and second),
English horn, E♭clarinet, B♭clarinet (first and second), bass clarinet, bas-
soon (first and second), contrabassoon, French horn (first, second, third,
and fourth)
◆Brass: Trumpet (first, second, and third), trombone (first, second, and
third), tuba
◆Percussion: Timpani, percussion (including snare drum, bass drum,
marimba, and so on)
◆Harp
◆Piano
◆Strings: Violin (first and second), viola, cello, double bass
As with big band scores, you can create orchestral scores in either concert key
or transposed keys—whichever works better for you.
Because most orchestral pieces are fairly long, it’s important to include proper
road mapping in your scores. Number each measure, and designate each section
with a new letter. This way musicians (and the conductor!) can easily find their
places during the starting and stopping of the rehearsal process—or if they hap-
pen to fall asleep during a long rest in a live performance!
Use the Computer
In the old days, it was a real pain in the rear to create scores for large ensem-
bles. Every part had to be written separately, by hand, and transposed as neces-
sary. That was a lot of writing, and didn’t always result in the most readable
pieces of music—especially if your handwriting is as bad as mine!
252
You also can cre-
ate a condensed
score, in which
individual parts are
collapsed into single
staves. This type of score
is easier to read, even
though it doesn’t contain
the part detail necessary
for initial rehearsals.
Tip
You have the option
of cutting down the
number of staves in
the score during
long sections of music
where fewer instruments
are playing.
Tip

Chapter 19: Lead Sheets and Scores
Today, thanks to computer technology, a lot of this notation process can be auto-
mated. Music notation software, available for both Windows and Macintosh
operating systems, enables you to create a complete piece of music—including
full orchestral scores—from your computer keyboard. The result is a professional-
looking piece of music, complete with proper note spacing and notation marks.
All music notation programs let you enter notes on the page with either your
mouse or computer keyboard. All you have to do is click a position on the
staff, and a note appears.
Many of these programs also let you connect a MIDI keyboard and input
music directly from the keyboard to your computer. The notation program
translates the notes you play on the keyboard into corresponding notes on a
staff. You can then fine-tune the music onscreen as necessary.
There are all different types of music notation programs, although they all per-
form the same basic functions. Some programs let you include more parts than
others, though, and some include more professional notation features. So when
you’re shopping for a music notation program, here are some things to look for:
◆The number of individual staves (instrumental and voice) you can create
for a piece of music.
◆The quality of the printed music. (Look especially for proper note spac-
ing, full extension of note stems, and the automatic avoidance of note col-
lisions, in which a note or marking from one staff overlaps a similar note
or marking on another staff.)
◆The capability to extract individual parts from a score.
◆The capability to automatically transpose parts.
◆The capability to include lyrics.
◆The capability to include guitar tabs.
◆The capability to write in standard percussion notation.
◆The inclusion of advanced notation markings and the flexibility to place
them wherever you want in the score.
◆The capability to create notation based on MIDI keyboard input.
The two most popular music notation programs today are Finale (www.codamusic.
com) and Sibelius (www.sibelius.com). Both programs work in similar fashion,
and both cost around $600 for the full package. Fortunately for cost-conscious
or outright starving musicians, both programs are also available in lower-priced
and/or student versions, so you can get similar (but not identical) functionality
at a bargain price. (Finale even offers a free version, called Finale Notepad, that
you can download from their website.)

Performing Your Music
In This Chapter
◆Preparing the parts for the individual musicians
◆Ensuring an effective and efficient rehearsal
◆Learning how to conduct a large ensemble
◆Choosing the appropriate method to start a song
◆A parting word—and advice for learning more
You’ve done it. You’ve learned enough theory to compose your own piece of
music, and you’ve arranged it for a vocal or instrumental ensemble. Now it’s
time to venture out into the real world, and get that music played.
Scary, isn’t it?
Having your music performed can be a nerve-wracking experience. Will all the
parts fit together? Did you write in the proper ranges? Did you transpose all
the parts properly? How will it sound?
Of course, to hear your music performed, you have to arrange for a group to do
the performing. If it’s a simple song, that might be as easy as gathering together
your local garage band for a quick read-through. If it’s a vocal arrangement, you
might be able to recruit your school or church choir for the job. If it’s a big
band piece, your high school or college jazz ensemble probably is the group to
ask. And if you’ve written a symphony or other orchestral work, it’s time to call
in some favors from your community orchestra.
Once you have the group lined up, the fun really starts—and you get to be a
conductor!
Preparing the Parts
As you learned back in Chapter 19, every musician must have his or her own
personal copy of the music. That doesn’t mean copying the conductor’s score a
few dozen times; it means writing out the specific part for that individual
instrument or voice.
Chapter

Part 6: Arranging
258
Most commercial music comes with all the individual parts you need for your
group. However, if you’re playing an original piece, it’s your responsibility to
create the individual parts for each instrument or voice, and to pass them out to
the musicians. Ideally this happens well in advance of the first rehearsal, so
they’ll have the opportunity to practice their parts on their own.
Remember to transpose the parts to the proper keys, to make the music as read-
able as possible, and to include proper signposts and road mapping throughout.
(That means numbering the measures, lettering individual sections, and includ-
ing cues of some sort when you’re coming off an extended section of rests.)
Rehearsal Routines
You’ve arranged the music, and arranged for the musicians. The big hand of the
clock is almost in the full-up position, and it’s time for your first rehearsal.
What do you do?
When you’re rehearsing a chorus, band, or orchestra, you need to warm up the
group before they start playing (or singing) full blast. Then you have to effec-
tively and efficiently rehearse the piece at hand—you have to get the musicians
up to speed as quickly as possible. (Time is money!)
Here’s a suggested routine you can use when you’re working with a large
ensemble of any type:
1. Setup
If you’re dealing with professionals, they’ll know to be set up and
ready to play at the appointed time. If you’re dealing with younger or
amateur players, you need to allow them time to get settled in and ready
to play.
2. Tuneup
You need to take a few minutes to get an instrumental group in
tune with itself.
3. Warmup
It’s especially important for nonprofessional players—both
vocalists and instrumentalists—to “limber up,” musically before they
tackle the hard stuff. Have them play or sing some scales, or run through a
simple and familiar piece of music, to help them stretch their musical
muscles, so to speak.
4. Play-through
Once everyone is set up, tuned up, warmed up, and ready
to go, you can start rehearsing your music. You might want to start by
playing the piece all the way through, to give everyone a feel for the piece.
Then you can go back and rehearse specific sections, focusing on those
parts of the music that are particularly tricky, or that seemed to give the
musicians problems on the first play-through. Remember to end the
rehearsal with a final play-through of the entire piece.
How to Conduct Yourself
If you’ve composed or arranged a piece of music, you’ll probably be expected to
lead the band or orchestra or choir when it’s time for that music to be played.
Your rehearsal time
will inevitably be limited—
and less than what you’d
ideally like to have. Plan
out your rehearsal routine
in advance to take best
advantage of the time you
have. Don’t spend so
much time on the begin-
ning of the piece that you
never get a chance to
rehearse the end!
Warning

Chapter 20: Performing Your Music
259
That means you need to know a little bit about conducting—at least enough to
get everybody started and stopped at the same time!
At its most basic, conducting is about setting the correct tempo, counting in the
musicians, and leading the way through any important changes in tempo or
dynamics throughout the music. Professional conductors also shape the flow of
the music, and can turn a generic orchestral or choral performance into a per-
sonal statement and a moving work of art.
However, when you’re first starting out you’ll have your hands full just finding
the downbeat. Fortunately, better musicians can soldier through, even if you’re
busy waving your arms around like a broken Dutch windmill.
The thing is, conducting is pretty simple. There are a few set patterns you need
to learn, then it all falls into place.
Conducting in Four
Most music is written in 4/4 time, so it’s very important to learn the pattern for
conducting in four.
You work through this pattern using your right hand—unless you’re left-
handed, of course. For the four-beat pattern, your hand has to move to four dif-
ferent positions. You don’t have to use huge movements, but your hand has to
move enough for the musicians to tell what the heck you’re doing. Try moving
your arm from the elbow, directly in front of your chest.
The four positions of this pattern describe a cross—up, down, left, right, like
this:
You can use a
baton (a short
wooden or plastic
stick) for conduct-
ing, but you don’t have to.
It’s perfectly acceptable to
conduct using nothing but
your bare hands.
Tip
The right hand is
typically used to
conduct the beat;
your left hand is
used to add emphasis or
point out specific parts. You
also can just stick your left
hand in your pocket, or mir-
ror your right-hand move-
ment with your left hand.
Tip

4

3
Conducting in four.
You start with the 4 position. This is the upward-most movement, and actually
serves as a kind of preparatory (or “get ready”) beat before the downbeat of one.
You move your arm up to a point, coinciding with the fourth beat of the meas-
ure (or the upbeat before the first measure of the song).

Part 6: Arranging
260
Now you bring your arm down, all the way to the bottommost position, exactly
on beat one. This is position 1, and it’s the most important movement in your
conducting. The musicians have to get a solid “one,” and that’s where your
downbeat comes in.
For the second beat in the measure, move your arm up slightly and to the left,
to position 2. Then, for the third beat, move your arm straight across, to the
right, to position 3.
Now we’re up to the fourth beat of the measure, and your upbeat. Swing your
arm back up to position 4 and get ready to start all over again for the next
measure.
Practice this movement—(up)-down-left-right-up—again and again, at different
tempos. Once you get this mastered, you’re conducting!
Conducting in Two
Conducting in 2/4 or 2/2 time is pretty similar to conducting in four. All you
have to do is leave out the left and right movements to positions 2 and 3.
That’s right: Conducting in two is a simple up-down, up-down movement; up
for the preparatory beat, down for one, up for two, down for one—again and
again and again.
Here’s what the pattern looks like:
1
2
Conducting in two.
Conducting in Three
Conducting in three is slightly more difficult than conducting in two or four.
It’s kind of like the four pattern, but without the left, or 2 position. In terms of
movement, you start with the preparatory beat (of course), then go down for
one, to the right for two, up for three, then back down for one again. Down,
right, up—like this:

Conducting in three.
Finding the Beat
As I said earlier, one of the chief duties of the conductor is to set the tempo.
There are two ways you can do this:
◆Timing the preparatory beat
This approach, preferred by profession-
als, gets you right into the music. You don’t count anything out in ad-
vance, just start by swinging your arm up for the preparatory beat. The
time between the preparatory beat and the initial downbeat is the duration
of a single beat, and very quickly sets the tempo. (Of course, the drawback
to this approach is that it’s very difficult to master—and, for that reason,
isn’t recommended for beginners.)
◆Counting the beat
This approach leaves no ambiguity over the tempo
of the song. You simply count out the beat, in tempo, like this: “One, two,
three, four,” or “One, two, ready, go.” You count out one measure (or
more), which serves to count the band in—and everybody starts on the
same beat at the same tempo.
You can use whichever method you prefer, although when you’re first learning a
piece, it’s probably better to count off before you start. This way you can set the
tempo in your head, and the other musicians won’t be guessing about where the
one is.
Practicing in the Real World
The best way to practice conducting is to do a little conducting in the privacy
of your own home—to your favorite songs and pieces of music. You should
practice to a variety of different CDs, to get used to the different beat patterns
used in different types of music.
Setting the tempo with the
preparatory beat is the
norm in the world of clas-
sical music. In the pop
and jazz worlds, it’s more
common to count off the
tempo.
Note

Part 6: Arranging
262
But before you go out and face the world for your first honest-to-goodness con-
ducting session, you need to practice with other people. Gather a few of your
friends, and practice with the piece you’ll be conducting—even if it’s just a few
of the parts. Run through the piece a few times, and encourage your friends to
tell you what you could do to improve your conducting.
That first downbeat in front of a group of musicians can be daunting. Use your
friends to help you get over any shyness or fear, so that you appear confident
when you pick up the baton for real. (Remember—musicians, like wild dogs, can
smell fear.)
The Least You Need to Know
◆Before your first rehearsal, make sure that every musician has his or her
own personal copy of the music.
◆Make sure you warm up and tune up the musicians before you start rehearsal.
◆To conduct a piece of music in 4/4, move your right hand from the up
position to the down position for the first beat, to the left for the second
beat, to the right for the third, and back to the up position for the fourth
beat. (That’s down, left, right, up—1, 2, 3, 4.)
◆Although you can let your preparatory beat establish the music’s tempo, it’s
probably better to count off the first measure (“One, two, ready, go”) to
help everyone feel the right beat.

Thus ends this book—and your first exposure to basic music theory. I hope
you’ve found the information in these pages helpful, and that I’ve passed on
some of my love and enthusiasm for how music gets created.
The key thing to remember (aside from all the notes and rhythms and such) is
that these musical building blocks exist for you to use—however you like. We
may say that there are rules and conventions, but when it comes to creating
music, all the rules are made to be broken. What ultimately matters is how a
piece of music sounds—to you, and to your listeners.
Theory is good, but it’s just a guideline for what happens out in the real world.
If you want to use parallel fifths in your harmony, go ahead. If you want to flat a
fifth or resolve a turnaround to the ii chord instead of the I, do it. Some of the
greatest pieces of music have broken all sorts of rules. As long as it sounds good,
it’s all okay.

Chapter 20: Performing Your Music
263
Just because you’re done with this book, however, doesn’t mean that your music
education has ended. In fact, if you choose to make music a part of your life,
your education never ends. Every song you listen to, every piece of music you
hear is an opportunity to learn more about the music you love. Keep your ears
open and your mind free, and you’ll continue to expand your knowledge and
skills for the rest of your musical life.
You can also further your music education with more reading. If you’re serious
about becoming a better musician, I recommend you check out the following
books:
◆Arranging and Composing for the Small Ensemble (David Baker; Alfred
Publishing; 1970—revised edition 1988)
◆Arranging Concepts Complete (Dick Grove; Alfred Publishing; 1972—
second edition 1989)
◆Hearing and Writing Music: Professional Training for Today’s Musician (Ron
Gorow; September Publishing; 2000)
◆Melody in Songwriting: Tools and Techniques for Writing Hit Songs (Jack
Perricone; Berklee Press; 2000)
◆Sounds and Scores: A Practical Guide to Professional Orchestration (Henry
Mancini; Northridge Music Inc.; 1973)
◆The Study of Orchestration (Samuel Adler; W.W. Norton & Company; third
edition 2002)
◆Tunesmith: Inside the Art of Songwriting (Jimmy Webb; Hyperion; 1998)
◆What to Listen for in Music (Aaron Copland; Mentor; 1939—softcover revi-
sion 1999)
I’d be remiss if I didn’t also mention some of the other music books that I have
written. Like this book, they’re all in Alpha Books’ Complete Idiot’s Guide series,
and (I hope) are as equally easy to read and follow. These books include:
◆The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Music Composition (Michael Miller; Alpha
Books; 2005)
◆The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Playing Drums (Michael Miller; Alpha Books;
2000—second edition 2004)
◆The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Singing (Michael Miller and Phyllis Fulford;
Alpha Books; 2003)
◆The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Solos and Improvisation (Michael Miller; Alpha
Books; 2004)
Of course, if you really want to learn about music, you need a good teacher.
Whether you study one-on-one with a professional educator, or attend music
classes at your favorite school or university, a teacher can provide the individual
instruction that’s necessary to develop your own unique musical skills.
There are also many music theory resources on the Internet. These tend to
change from year to year, so go to Google and do a search on “music theory”

and see what you find. Among my favorite sites (as of summer 2005) are Music
Notes Music Theory (library.thinkquest.org/15413/), Teoría Music Theory Web
(www.teoria.com), and Ricci Adams’s Musictheory.net (www.musictheory.net).
While you’re on the Internet, make sure you check out my personal website
(www.molehillgroup.com). There you’ll find information about my latest book
projects and (at www.molehillgroup.com/theory-corrections.htm) any updates or
corrections to the information in this book.
The Internet is also a good way to get in contact with me; my e-mail address is
theory@molehillgroup.com. I encourage and appreciate any comments you
might have about this book, or about music theory in general; it’s always good
to hear from fellow musicians.
If you love music, as I do, you’ll want to experience as much of it as possible.
The more you play, or sing, or just listen, the more you’ll learn about the theory
behind the music. So put down this book and put on your favorite CD—or pick
up your instrument and start playing. The music is waiting for you!
