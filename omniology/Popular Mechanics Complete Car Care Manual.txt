or almost 100 years, the editors of Popular Mechanics have made car care and maintenance 
a central component of the magazine. From the very beginning, we understood just how pas-
sionate readers were about their cars, and just how far they would go to protect, repair, and 
maintain their beloved vehicles. How else to explain an executive trading in his workday suit for a 
pair of overalls and spending his Saturday afternoons hunkered down under the hood of his car? 
For some of our readers, saving money is no doubt a major motivation. But for most, working on 
their cars is a labor of love, pure and simple. That, and they want to make sure the repair is done 
right. The cars may have changed over the years, but the dedication of readers has been a constant. 
And Popular Mechanics has been a partner all the way, delivering the hands-on information car 
enthusiasts need to get the job done right. 
We understand that the key to any successful piece of advice is clarity. So we strive to make sure 
our instructions and our illustrations are legible and to the point. We hope you'll find those quali-
ties in evidence in the pages that follow. You'll find chapters on all the basic car components-
engine, chassis, electrical system, drivetrain, and interior/exterior-as well as an opening chapter on 
the essential maintenance information that every owner should know. Each project is labeled 
"easy," "moderate," or "diffic ult" to allow you to make your own decision as to whether you have 
the requisite expertise, not to mention the time and energy, to undertake a given procedure. So, 
whether you're breaking out the brand-new wrenches from your first tool set, or sliding under a car 
on your creeper for the umpteenth time, you'll find this book to be an indispensable reference 
source, packed with easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions that take the mystery out of auto 
maintenance and save you money. And, should you decide that a given repair is a bit too tricky for 
you, the book will arm you with the knowledge necessary to discuss the work intelligently with 
your professional mechanic. 
Our goal is a simple one: We want to provide you with the information you need to keep that 
treasured car of yours in peak condition regardless of its make, model, or age. We know how much 
you love your car and how dedicated you are to maintaining it. We're hoping our book provides 
you with a way to put that dedication into action.

EASY 
Replacing Wiper Blades 
T
hrough the monsoonlike ra in, 
you see some sort of flashing 
lights ahead of you. But despite 
the best efforts of your windshield 
wipers, all you can see are blurry blobs 
of yellow, amber and red. Slowing to 
half speed, you continue to press for-
wa rd through the deluge. Suddenly 
you realize that those flashing blobs 
are the warning lights of a stopped 
school bus, and children are running 
across the road in front of you. Fortu-
nately, your brakes work infinitely bet-
ter than your windshield wipers. 
Once it's dry and sunny again, grab 
a tape measure and head for the garage. 
Lift one of the wiper arms (it's usually 
easier to grab the driver's-side arm) off 
the windshield against its spring ten-
sion and keep lifting until the pivot 
point locks the arm upright (Fig. 1). 
Look for contaminated rubber 
inserts, which can be caused by road 
film or car-wash chemical adhesion. 
Inspect the wiping edges for "park set 
rubbel;" the term used to describe hard-
ened finely-cracked inserts that have 
been exposed to the sun too long in a

parked position. This will cause chatter-
ing and skipping. Check for a rubber 
insert that has been partially torn away 
from its metal support. It will slap the 
windshield with each wiping pass. 
Plain old dried out, cracked rubber 
inserts mean they've seen better days. 
You also may find rubber inserts that 
are abrasion-worn from winter condi-
tions, infrequent car washes and/or a

lack of preventive maintenance. And 
rear-window wiper blades are sub-
jected to a lot more road grit than 
front blades. In the rear, you get aero-
dynamic backwash, with the rear tires 
kicking up all sorts of debris. And 
don't rule out an improperly installed 
refill. Maybe someone else had tried 
to replace the inserts before you got 
to them. Buy a pair of full-blade 
assemblies to get a factory fit. Also 
check the wiper anTIs. If they're okay, 
proceed to replace the blades. 
Blade Runner 
But first, measure the length of the 
wiper blade to the nearest inch (Fig. 2) . 
Most vehicles today use blades any-
where from about 16 to 21 in. in 
length. H owevel; some cars or mini-
vans with very large windshields may 
exceed that by a few inches. 
Parts catalogs, even those for sim-
ple items like wiper blades, are fu ll of 
all sorts of extraneous information. 
You may find three different types of 
refills and three different types of 
blades for almost every vehicle listed. 
REPLACING WIPER BLADES 
HOW IT WORKS 
Windshield Wipers 
As the rubber insert of a wiper 
blade sweeps across your wet wind-
shield, a wedge of water builds up 
in front of the rubber-a squeegee 
effect-and the wiper displaces 
that water elsewhere_ What's left is 
clean, clear glass that allows you to 
continue on your way safely_ That's 
the way it's supposed to work. The 
illustrations to the right show some 
of the reasons why it may not. 
Other reasons may involve com-
ponents that work behind the 
scenes-actually, behind the cowl 
or dashboard of your car. They 
include the splined shafts that the 
wiper arms pivot on, the mechanism 
that creates the back-and-forth piv-
oting motion and the electric wiper 
motor that drives the whole system. 
A small nut under a cosmetic 
plastic cover jams the wiper arm 
onto the splines of its shaft. The 
splines keep the shaft from slipping 
in the arm as it turns in one direc-
tion and then the other, over and 
over and over. This reciprocating 
motion is created by a metal crank-
type linkage assembly that's 
attached to each wiper arm's 
splined shaft, and to the wiper 
motor with another splined shaft. 
Picture the chugging action of a 
steam locomotive's piston and dri-
vewheels and you'll get the idea. 
Rear wipers-found on minivans, 
SUVs and some sport coupes-work 
the same way, except the recipro-
cating mechanism is much smaller 
and built into the motor. 
Wiper speed depends on the 
amount of voltage that's sent to the 
motor from the wiper switch-low 
voltage equals low speed, high volt-
age equals high speed. Intermittent 
wiper action is created by a sepa-
rate electronic module wired 
between the switch on your dash-
board or steering column stalk and 
the motor. Some cars even have 
electronically controlled road-
speed-sensitive wipers that wipe 
faster the quicker you go.

on them. Others will not. 
So if this is the case, you'll 
have to hold the blade off 
the glass while you work. 
If your car has wipers that 
park behind a cowl or the 
lip of the hood, turn on the 
ignition, turn on the wipers 
and then shut off the igni-
tion when the wipers are in 
midstroke so you can have 
access to them. 
unit may simply lock onto the pin. 
Sometimes, the box will contain an 
adapter that locks into the blade open-
ing and accepts pins in different sizes. 
The straight-end connector can be 
tricky. Sometimes yo u need to lift a 
tab on top of the existing blade with a 
screwdri ver to clear the locking nub 
on the arm . You may also need to 
cock the old blade a few degrees out-
of-parallel with the arm to slide it off 
the arm 's end. 
(Fig. 3) Release the tab to disengage the blade from 
the straightened arm.

Once the old blade is off, applying 
a little antiseize compound to the 
arm's end couldn't hurt. The new 
blade may come with an adapter to fit 
the arm 's end or it may just slide on. 
Again, give a firm shove until the 
blade clicks into place. 
If you don't kn ow what brand of 
blade your ca r has, don't buy r ubber 
insert refi lls. The refi lls may not fit the 
blades properly, and you'll get lousy 
wiper performance. 
If you do know what brand of 
blade is currently on the car, refill s are 
okay as long as yo u buy the sa me 
brand and type. Experience has 
shown that mixing blade and refi ll 
brands doesn't lead to optimulll wiper 
performance. But realistically, you're 
still better off just buying a pair of 
blade assemblies no matter what the 
brand. The few extra bucks get yo u 
new, matched components that 
mount quick ly and easil y. 
Fresh Rubber 
Now that you've got new blades in 
hand, it's time to determine what 
method to use to mount the wiper 
blade to the wiper arm. T here are 
many variati ons: hook-slot connector, 
pin-type arm, wide-straight end, nar-
row-straight end, side saddle, pin-type 
blade, narrow-dead locker, flat hook 
and rock to lock. 
At the very least, you'll need a 
small screwdriver to gentl y pry the 
blade off the arm or to unlock a tab 
of some sort. Sometimes a pair of 
needle-nose pliers helps too, but the 
pliers tend to mar the w iper-arm fi n-
ish more than a screwdriver. 
Bear in mind that most wipers will 
stay raised in an upright position away 
from the windshield so you can work 
denl y snaps down o n the 
w indshield's glass. 
For the hook-slot connector, you 
generally need to raise the arm off the 
windshield to a working height. T hen, 
swing the blade perpendicular to the 
arm so that you have more light on the 
connector. You'll find some sort of tab 
at the connector that either needs to be 
lifted or pushed to release the lock that 
holds the blade pivot in the hook slot. 
O nce the tab is released, a firm shove 
toward the base of the arm will slide 
the blade right out of the hook slot 
(Fig. 3). Then, simply line up the new 
blade's mount (there may be an adapter 
in the box to create this mount) with 
the hook slot and slide it in until it 
clicks. This means it's locked in place. 
For the pin-type arm, raise the arm 
to a working height and take a close 
If you're replacing a rubber insert, 
just grab it with needle-nose pliers at the 
open end. T he other end generally has 
some sort of deadstop that prevents the 
insert from sliding out. You may need 
to unlock a tab or squeeze together the 
locking tangs of the insert before you 
can begin pulling. Then, just hold the 
blade firm ly while you pull the insert 
out like a piece of spaghetti. Gra b the 
new insert-make sure that you've got 
the right end if they're different-line 
it up with the first set of guides on the 
blade, then feed it in carefull y. Ma ke 
sure to engage each set of guides as 
you go. Sometimes there are as many 
as eight guides. O nce the insert is all 
the way in, make sure it is locked in 
place. fj 
look at the type of lock-
ing tab that holds the 
blade onto the pin. 
You'll either have to 
push the tab up from 
underneath the blade or 
I ift the ta b from the top 
wi th a screwdri ver (Fig. 
4) . Once the tab 
" uncollars" the pin, 
pull the blade assembly 
with a sideways motion 
away from the arm. (Try 
to imagine pulling the 
blade up the windshield, 
to picture the motion. ) 
Depending on the blade 
manufacturer, the new

water. Some heavy-duty filters are 
designed to be cleaned severa l times, 
but a utomotive filters are not. 
Before you reuse a fi lter, however, 
inspect it for cracked pleats. The best 
way is to hold the dirty side of the fi l-
ter in front of yo ur eyes with good 
lighting on the opposite side (with a 
cylindrical fi lter, hold a trouble light 
in the middle of the opening). O f 
co urse, you should see some tra nslu-
cence (if you don't, the filter is 
plugged ). But if you see even a single 
li ne of light, which indicates a hair-
line crack, discard the fi lter. A lot of 
unfiltered air can get through a crack, 
and it's the abrasive dust in the air 
that wears engines. Sure, that wear 
takes place over time, but if you're in 
a dusty area that time can be a lot 
shorter th an you'd li ke. 
Buy a quality replacement fil ter. 
T he top brands are different fro m the 
no-name cheapies you may see. There 
are many grades of filter "paper" and 
the more expensive ones used by the 
top brands have more consistent 
pores, so they do a better job of trap-
ping dirt. In addition, their pleats are 
more precisely spaced so the fi lter has 
the maxim um surface area fo r the size 
of the housing. 
Metering the Air 
Just downstream of the filter housing, 
perhaps connected by a duct, will be 
the engine's airflow meter, or sensor. 
(Some engines have no airflow meter. 
Instead, their computer calculates air 
intake using rpm, intake vacuum and 
barometric pressure.) Contamination 
of the airflow meter will give your 
engine's computer inaccurate infor-
mati on about the amount (mass) of 
air the engine is burning. That could 
mean poor drivea bility, poor mileage 
and hard starting. 
Don't, however, try to clean the 
airflow sensor, save for blow ing 
loose dirt and co bwebs with your 
breath. T he calibra tion of these 
instruments is fragile, and yo u stand 
a good chance of mucking yo ur sen-
sor up irrepara bly. 
Duct Hunting 
Before you install the new fi lter, 
inspect the duct from the throttle 
body to the fi lter housing. Spread the 
flu tes of the duct, looking fo r cracks. 
If the duct is cracked, it may be closed 
at idle but spread on acceleration, 
when the engine torq ues. That not 
only brings in unfi ltered air, but on 
today's engines with mass airflow sen-
sors, the dirty air also is "unmea-
sured." T he amount of fuel sprayed 
by the injectors is determined by how 
much air is flowing in, so if some of 
that airflow isn't measured by the sen-
sor, not enough fuel w ill be injected. 
The engine will run lean and hesitate 
and/or stum ble. The same th ing can 
occur if the duct isn't properly fitted 
and clamped at each end. 
Find a crack? Well, it's a duct, so you 
can repa ir it with duct tape (Fig. 3). 
That's a move that no professional 
would make, because in time the tape 
will lose its grip in the heat of the 
engine compartment, as the duct 
flexes. But it's your cal; and if you are 
willing to recheck periodica lly and 
retape as necessary, you can save the 
cost of the new part, or at least post-
pone the expense. 
Fit Is Important 
Carefully check the fit between the 
lips of the housing and the rubber 
gasket rimm ing the filter. This gasket 
not only seals the filter housing's two 
halves together, but also provides an 
airtight and dirt-tight seal between 
the fil ter and the clean side of the 
ho using. Look carefully at the old fil-
ter's gasket. It sho uld show a 
smooth, clean line 360
0 around at 
the sealing face on both sides. The 
rim of the filter housing will have 
compressed the rubber gasket if 
everything is correct. If not, a little 
detecti ve work is in order. Is the filter 
the co rrect part? If not, is your 
replacement filter the correct part? 
Don't rely on just a visual compari-
son-look up the correct part num-
ber and cross-reference. Ad it's possi-
ble another brand will fit better. 
Are all of the spring clamps prop-
erly latched ? Some air cleaners use 
screws to hold them shut, while oth-
ers use a large wingnut. All of the fas-

you can hardly see or reach next to

The resin-impregnated , 
heat-cured "paper" ele-

ability of the paper. But 
soon the dirt builds up

the bottoms of the pleats, 
restricting airflow. The

It's time to finish up. Install the cover

addition to the spring clips and 
wingnurs that hold the pans together, 
there also may be alignment tabs in 
areas you can't reach with your fin-

you fit the halves together, so the two 
parts of the housing form an airtight 
joint when you turn the wingnuts or

A point comes when 
not enough voids remain

result is inadequate oxy-

used to mean rich run-
ning. Modern fuel-
injected engines meter

It all looks random, but the premium-priced filter 
"papers" are more consistent in the sizes of the pores 
than it seems, and a quality material is a mathematically 
predictable barrier to dirt particles. In actuality, the layers 
of fibers form a maze and some of the dirt also is trapped 
within the layers of the paper. The inrushing air produces 
clean-running engine that eventually won't get out of its 
own way. At least carbureted cars coughed and sput-
tered to let you know that you had a problem. 
But with today's engines, a filter has to be really bad 
to restrict acceleration. A bigger hazard is an overloaded 
filter rupturing and dumping 20 miles of bad road into 
your engine.

F
lat tires are never a fun

in the ankl e-deep mud on the

It's time to kn uckle down and

puncture, and that may be a viable 
option, especially for smaller individu-
als or the elderly who would have a 
tough time changing a tire . .lust remem-

technician that you've used this stuff. 
The propellant is flammable, and unless 
he's warned, he stands the chance of 
causing a nasty explosion. Aerosol flat-

flat spare is no help. And if you're like 
most people w ho save a plugged or 
nearly worn tire for the spare, it's likely 
that the spare has a slow leak, which 
would leave you stranded. 
Furthermore, you'll never be able to 
change a tire if you don't have the 
basics-a jack and a lug wrench (Fig. 
2). Go back into their hidy-hole and 
confirm their existence (Fig. 3) . While

ing poi nts. You'll probably need to lie 
on the ground to find them, but this 
will be a lot more palatable now in 
your driveway than later on the shoul-
der of some mud bog. 
Grunting Helps 
The most common difficulty in chang-
ing a tire is lugs that are tightened far 
too tightly. A casual rattle with a 
mechanic's air wrench can deliver a 
tightening torgue that only a pro 
wrestler could remove with the stock 
lug wrench. Wheel lugs need to be 
tightened to no more than the manu-
facturer's recommended torgue to 
ens ure they won't loosen. Check your 
(Fig. 2) loosening lug nuts calls for a 
lot of upper-body strength. An inexpen-
sive 4-way lug wrench can substantially 
increase your leverage and break loose 
overly tightened lugs.

math-that means a 200-pound adult 
should be able to tighten the 
lugs by placing all his weight on top 
of the wrench only 6 in. away from 
the fastener. A few drops of engine oil 
or grease on the threads and the 
lug chamfer (where the lug touches 
the wheel, not the threads) wi ll 
prevent galling and seizing. 
When removing a wheel, first loosen 
all of the lugs in a crisscross pattern a 
half-turn or so. It may be necessary to 
use the mechanic's favorite cheater bar 
(Fig. 4)-a piece of water pipe 
or thick wall pipe about 4 ft. 
long-to add enough leverage 
to break the lugs loose. Remove 
them one at a time and lube 
them if they squeak. Retighten 
them in three stages, again in a 
crisscross pattern. 
Black And Round 
Many carmakers, in an 
attempt to reduce vibration by 
making sure the wheels are 
more concentric with the hub, 
use a protruding lip that mates 
closely with the centerhole on 
the rim. This works well for a

couple of years, but eventually corro-
sion from road grime can make it 
impossible to budge the wheels, even 
after you've loosened all the lugs. 
Correct this now, and you won't need 
to try it in the field. Jack up the corner 
of the car to take the load off the 
wheel and kick the wheel, alternating 
sides until it pops loose. No joy, and 
now your feet hurt? Be sure the lugs 
are only a single turn frol11 tight, 
lower the car and move it a foot for-
ward and back, rapping the brakes 
smartly to break the wheel loose. A 
shot of penetrating oil may help in an 
hour or two. Clean up the corrosion 
with emery paper (Fig. 5) and coat al l 
the surfaces lightly with wheel bear-
ing grease, Vaseline or, best of all, 
antiseize compound. 
You'll need a few things besides 
the on-board tools for your emer-
gency tire change. Pack a flash light 
with good batteries or, better yet, a 
cigarette-lighter-powered trouble 
light, an emergency triangle, a couple 
of road flares, some gloves and a pon-
cho or ground cloth. Toss in three 
pieces of scrap 2 x 4 as well, each 
about a foot long, and a piece of thick 
plywood 2 x 2 feet. 
That Fateful Day 
When changing a tire the first, 
and most important, thing to 
do is to get the vehicle to a 
safe area, far enough from the 
road to save you from becom-

Leave the vehicle in Park and 
set the hand brake. Block the 
wheel diagonally opposite the 
flat with two pieces of wood 
(Fig. 6). Loosen all the lugs on 
the flat a full turn. Take the 
spare out of the trunk and put it 
halfway under the car near the 
jack. In the unlikely event the 
car falls off the jack, it will onl y

Lower the vehicle and pull the 
jack out. Now you can tighten 
the lugs to their correct torque. 
Check the owner's manual for 
the torgue specification. Measure 
carefully. If the lug is dry and

the one pictured here (Fig. 7), check 
your owner's manual for specifics. 
If the ground isn't firm, put the 2 x 2 
piece of plywood under the jack point, 
and the jack on top of the wood. Be 
sure everything is level. Jack the car 
up until the flat clears the ground by 
several inches, because the spare isn't 
flat and will need more clearance.

Pull the flat off and put it

the spare on the studs. No 
studs? You've got lug bolts 
(common on many European 
cars) and you'll need to juggle 
the wheel while you get the top 
one started. The easy way is to 
sit down on the ground facing 
the hub and balance the spare 
on your legs while you start the 
first lug bolt. If you begin with 
the top bolt, the wheel will 
hang gracefully from it and you

Be sure you don't have anything 
(like a stone or mud) trapped 
between the rim and hu b, or the rim 
will wobble. In fact, if the mud COI11-

torg ue and the wheel could fly off. If 
you need to, remove the wheel again 
in the morning to remove the debris, 
corrosion and rust from all the mat-
ing faces and between the wheel and 
hub, and then lightly lube. This will 
have the added benefit of mak ing the 
wheel easier to remove the next time. 
Hint: There should be some grease to 
be found on the jackscrew of your

to buy one and keep it in the trunk. 
As you're putting away your tools 
and jack, be sure you haven't left 
them covered with mud or moisture, 
which might cause them to rust while 
stored . If they're a mess, clean them

do you remove the Swiss-cheese pipe 
without ruining the other two ? By 
using a power cutting wheel and a

albeit more slowly.

up of a larger pipe slipped over a

The following scenario is 
typical of vehicles that have 
had part of their exhaust sys-
tem replaced at least once. The 
saga begins with a section of 
the original exhaust plumbing 
behind the catalytic converter 
rusting out and making a 
ruckus. Because the original 
exhaust pipes are welded 
together, however, all the pipes 
from the cat back need to be 
replaced. There's no practical 
way to remove just the rotted 
section because of all the 
welds. 
(Fig. 2) Peel up the corners of the old pipe to slide in the new piece. 
' . . 
If you had the wherewithal, 
you cou ld probably cut out just 
the rusted portion and have a 
pipe custom-fitted. But that 
would be extremely labor-
intensive and not particularl y 
economical over the long haul. 
Also, exhaust work just isn't 
done that way. So, generally, 
two or three aftermarket pipes 
and the muffler are clamped 
together behind the converter 
to repair the exhaust. 
(Fig. 3) After installing all the parts, adjust for fit and tighten the clamps. 
Then you drive around for 
another year or two in peace and 
quiet-unaware that the replacement 
pipes hanging under you tend to rust 
at different rates. Sometimes, the mid-
dle pipe of the three you installed goes 
first. Other times, the muffler at the 
end fa lls off before the other two. Still 
other times, the flanged pipe bolted to 
the cat is the first to go bad. In all 
cases, though, you want to replace 
onl y the bad pipe. Problem is, the 
Sizing It Up 
Get the back of the car up on jack-
stands, with chocks securing the front 
wheels. Be sure to wear safety gog-
gles, as exhaust systems tend to drop 
razor-sharp flakes of rust that are 
seemingly attracted to your eyes. 
Get under the vehicle to see what 
kind of couplings you're dealing 
with. The flanged type is easy. Just 
spray the rusty bolts with penetrant 
way the coupling is facin g. Both may 
be present in the same exhaust sys-
tem. The important thing to remem-
ber is that you may need to save the 
inner pipe, so use a gentle touch with 
the cutting wheel. If the outer pipe 
needs to be saved, there's nothing you 
can do to keep from cutting it. But 
that's why you're going to use a cut-
ting wheel instead of an impact chisel. 
It ma kes for a neater, smoother cut.

(Fig. 4) Smear muffler cement over the joint after you install the clamp. 
Slice, Don't Dice 
To begin, remove the bad pipe's 
clamps. Then, make a lengthwise

to slice open the outer pipe. Put on a 
pair of goggles, get a good doubl e-
handed grip on the cutter tool ancl

gentle pressure, score the mark.

If you're saving the inner pipe, 
repeat this step until you're through 
the outer pipe. It's okay for the inner 
pipe to get a little score groove in it-

way th rough. [f you're saving the outer 
pipe, the second cut ca n take you all 
the way through the inner pipe. 
With the cut made, use a screw-
driver or a chisel to pry open the 
outer pipe like a tin ca n. That will 
give you enough play at the crim ped 
area to wiggle the pipes apart. 
Spread 'em 
Fitting a new pipe over an old one is 
no problem. Fitting a new pipe in to an 
old one sometimes is, because of the 
crimp from the old clamp. If you're 
having trouble, use an exhaust-pipe 
expa nder to gain some extra clea rance. 
Then, simply fit the pipes together as if 
they were both new after smearing a

so you reach into the console for 
your favorite MC5 CD. Popping

liberally lubricated it with peanut 
butter and jell y. After making a men-
tal note to give Junior a good ta lk-
ing-to, you decide to surf the air-
waves for some good oldtime rock-
and-roll. Punching the FM button, 
you hope that at least one of the 
radio presets has some Bob Seger 
tunes hiding behind it. But no, 
there's nothing to be heard on any 
channel except a great rushing noise, 
not even so much as CONELRAD. 
Time to come back to this millen-
nium and find out what's wrong with 
your antenna. 
Manual Or Power? 
Fixed antennas have only a couple of 
failure modes, and generally they 
involve mechanical damage to the 
antenna mast or the cable. If part of 
the mast is still there, you'll generally 
get some sort of signa l. A poor con-
nection between the antenna base and 
the fender also could be a problem. 
Unscrew the antenna mounting nut 
and check for corrosion. A cleanup 
with a wire brush and reassembly 
might re-establish a good ground. 
Power antennas are more coy. If 
they're too shy to come out of the 
fender, you're listening to static. 
No-Show 
The issue could be either electrical or 
purely mechanical. Go back to your

antenna and try to pull the mast out 
with your fingers. If it moves out 
readily, pull it out all the way, and 
then cycle the radio power with the 
key on. If the mast moves even the 
slightest amount, or you can hear the 
motor running at all, the problem is 
mechanical. 
If the motor seems deceased, 
go back to basics-check the fuse. 
Determining which fuse protects the 
antenna motor may require some 
detective work. It may be the radio 
fuse, or it may be a separate fuse, per-
haps shared with the rear-window 
defroster grid or a trunk-mounted CD 
changer. (Finding something else that 
doesn't work often is a good clue.) 
Fuse is okay? Check the antenna's 
mounting, as described previously, for

a good ground pathway, although 
there may be a separate gro und wire 
to a specific chassis ground point. You 
may want to use an ohmmeter (Fig. 1) 
to hunt for resistance. Incidentall y, if 
you try to measure the resistance of 
the antenna cable's RF lead between 
the mast and the radio connector, it 
may check out as infinite. Some 
antenna assemblies use a capacitor in 
series with the RF lead, some don 't. 
T he ground shell of the anten na cable 
should have a low resistance to chas-
sis ground, normally 5 ohms or less. 
You'll need to find a schema tic of 
the antenna wiring to troubleshoot 
any deeper. But with the radio and 
key on, the harness to the antenna 
REPAIRING POWER ANTENNAS 
assembly should have one hot wire 
on, and a di fferent wire hot when the 
key or rad io is off. Good hunting. 
Stubborn 
Does the antenna motor run briefly 
but not actually move the mast up 
and down? Or does it move a few 
inches and then grind to a halt? One 
problem we've seen is a kinked or 
pinched drain tube. (Fig. 2) The mech-
anism can fill with water, which then 
freezes solid in cold weather, or cor-
rodes the works and causes a jam. 
Check the tube, especially if you can 
pull the mast o ut manually and it's 
wet. If the tube is compromised and 
the works are full of water, you may 
need to disassemble the thing, dry it 
out, and put it back together with 
fresh lubricant. 
Can you help the mast along in 
and out? If so, the sliding sections 
of the mast may be corroded or bent. 
Careful bending by hand may restore 
movement, and polishing with 600-grit 
sandpaper or rubbing compound can 
smooth the action. At the very least, 
run the mast completely out and clean 
it thoroughly with a soft cloth, relu-
bricating with a sparse amount of sili-
cone grease or paste wax. 
What's That Funny Noise? 
Modern power antennas use a simple, 
flexible rack-and-pinion mechanism. 
It's pretty reliable, but abuse and the 
ravages of time and weather can liter-
ally strip the gears. So if you hear 
noises that sound li ke interrupted gear 
meshing, there's probably some section 
of the rack or pinion that's in need of 
dental work. It's possible to fix this 
without replacing the antenna assem-
bly outright (Fig. 3). (You may not even 
have to access the mechanism.)

FERRULE 
(Fig. 4) Remove the outer nut and 
collar as a first step to removing or 
replacing the mast. 
Visit your dealership's parts depart-
ment. GM, for one, offers a repair kit 
for power antennas. T his consists of a 
new mast and rack assembly, ready to 
install. You may need to order it, as 
the two dealers we tried didn 't have it 
in stock . There are aftermarket 
antenna parts to be had, but finding 
the right part is going to be difficult 
unless you have better luck than we 
did interrogating the staff behind the 
parts counter at the local wareho use 
distributor. 
Here's how the system works: The 
limi t switches that stop the motor at 
both ends of the antenna mast's travel 
are built in to the mechanism, and you 
ca n consider them unserviceable. T he 
limit switches rely on the antenna bot-
toming out or topping out to rotate a 
switch drum, at which point the cur-
rent to the motor turns off. 
At the top of the antenna mechanism 
is a large nut that holds the whole works 
onto the fender. Remove this nut. This 
isn't as easy as it sounds if it doesn't have 
flats that you can turn with a wrench. 
You may need to use a spanner with 
pins- although a pair of snap ring pliers 
may work if the nut isn't wickedly tight. 
At the potential expense of the chrome 
finish, you may need to fa ll back on the 
mechanic's friend, locking pliers. Under 
the nut and perhaps a plastic spacer or 
two there wi ll be a ferru le (Fig. 4), which 
is the stepped sleeve that the mast actu-
ally bumps into at the end of its travel 
upward. Pull out this ferrule. Now have 
someone else turn on the radio. The 
mast should elevate itself completely out 
and flop over, so you have to be there to 
catch it. Carefully notice which way the 
teeth of the rack point as the mast clears 
the fender. Note the state of the teeth. 
M issing teeth probabl y mean you 
should disassemble the housing and 
clear all the bits out, but teeth that are 
simply worn should be okay. 
The new mast's rack has been 
cu rled up like a p ig's ta il in the pack-
age, and it will be difficult getting it to 
mesh with the gea rs. With your fin-
gers or pliers, bend the bottom 2 or 3 
in. backward to remove the curl. The 
end should be straight now. After 
making sure that the radio is turned 
o ff, take a look at the last tooth-you 
may need to remove a small amount 
of casting fl ash. A pocketknife does 
that job well. 
Take the new mast, with the teeth 
of its rack a ppropriately oriented, 
and insert it into the ho le unti l it bot-
toms. Rotate the mast a little to the 
left and right to get th e teeth to mesh 
with the pinion gea r (Fig. 5). H ave 
your helper turn the radio on and off 
w hile you push the new mast firm ly 
down. This wil l ca use the limit switch 
to cycle inside th e mechanism. Now 
have your helper turn the radi o on, 
and if all is well, the mast will suck 
itself very neatly in until it bottoms 
o ut. All you need to do now is rein-
sta ll the ferru le, spacers and nut. 
Lightly lu be the mast sections with 
silicone grease or paste wax.

working, you may be able to disas-
semble it, clean up any fore ign matter 
or corrosion, and get it

running aga in. The switch consists 
of a plastic drum with wiper fin gers 
and electrical traces, so it's vu lnerable 
to moisture and dried-out lu brica nt. If 
you ca n't fix it, or the motor itself is 
toasted, you'll need to replace the 
whole shootin' match. An aftermarket 
antenna will set you back about $60 
to $75 at the loca l auto parts store, or 
mo re than a hundred at the dea ler-
maybe more for a lux ury import. The 
OEM parts will, of course, drop in. 
Aftermarket pieces may require a 
certain amount of adaptation to 
mount properly, and perhaps even 
some creati ve w iring to make them 
work properl y. Don't forget to check 
for used parts at the local scrapyard

longer than you're probably used to. 
An older, marginal socket may not fit 
the hex properly and could slip off 
and break the plug. It also helps to 
use a socket with a rubber insert to 
securely hold the plug. 
Finally, the elbow grease 
Start with a warm engine. Clean the 
plug hole recesses with compressed

Removing plugs from a hot cylinder 
head can damage the threads. 
Once yo u have the plugs out, 
check them carefully before yo u 
decide they've got a lot of life left. 
Use a magnifying glass and feeler

see rounding off of the center elec-

install new plugs. Forget trying to 
file the plugs. 
If you're reinstalling the old 
pI ugs, smear a film of antiseize on 
the threads near the tip. New plugs 
have a coating that will lu bricate 
the threads on the way in and pre-
ve nt the plug from seizing on their 
next removal, but it's only good for 
one stab. 
If any spark plugs are dry-soot 
black, that's from carbon-a rich-

trouble code indicating the oxygen 
sensor is incorrectl y signa li ng lean, 
the sensor could be responsible. If it's 
correctly indicating a rich mixture, 
then you have to look for a cause, 
such as leaking fuel injectors or 
engi ne misfire, perha ps ca used by 
defective plug wires. It wou ld seem 
that misfire would throw a lot of raw 
gas into the exhaust, which it does. 
But it also th rows in a lot of oxygen, 
and that's what the sensor sees, and 
in this case it just tells the computer 
to add more fuel. 
Not sure or no code? Then check 
the oxygen sensor, which resembles a 
HOW IT WORKS 
The Right Plug 
The correct plug for your 
engine is, of course, the 
exact part number that 
the manufacturer 
installed at the factory. 
When it's time to retire 
them, you'll be forced to 
choose from several 
manufacturers' offerings, 
and they're all pretty 
much alike, right? Wrong. 
There are subtle differ-
ences in a plug's ability to dissipate heat that belie what would otherwise 
be an exact physical match. A "hot" plug has a long path through the 
ceramic to the (relatively) cool cylinder head. A "cold" plug has a shorter 
heat-conduction path and tends to run cooler. 
Plug manufacturers cross-reference their product lines to other manu-
facturers' lines, and you should be able to find a plug to fit almost anything 
in the cross-reference chart. More important than heat range are things 
like thread diameter and length, and the type of tip . 
Installing the wrong plug can ruin your engine instantly if the plug is 
too long and whacks the top of the piston, especially in today's alu-
minum heads. 
Too short a plug not only won't fire, carbon will quickly fill the threads on 
the cylinder's head, preventing you from installing the correct plug. 
spark p lug threaded into the exhaust 
manifold . If there's an O 2 trouble 
code and no apparent other ca use, 
yo u could just rep lace the sensor. O r, 
before you invest in a new one, test 
the sensor you've got. You can do 
this using one of the inexpensive 
testers made for Saturday mechanics. 
With a warmed-up engine (necessary 
to get the O 2 sensor working) and 
the throttle cracked open (so the 
engine is running at about 2000 
rpm), the tester's indicator lights typ-
ically wi II flash on and off (or will 
both glow steadily) if the O 2 sensor 
is working properly. 
If you don't get the lights, or as an 
extra check, let the engine cool. 
Remove the sensor with a tight-fitting 
wrench and bench-test it. The typical 
sensor has a closed but slotted end 
and is a heat battery of sorts. If you 
envelop the sensor end with the flame 
of a propane torch (so it gets hot but 
not cherry red ), it should produce 
over OAv with a high-impedance digi-
tal voltmeter hooked up, or turn on 
the tester lights. If the sensor is good, 
the voltage should drop or the lights 
go out within 3 seconds after you pull 
away the flame. 
Occasionally a vehicle has a different 
type of sensor, and in some designs it 
has an open tip. This is a varying-resis-
tance device that doesn't respond to 
these voltage-generating tests, so you'll 
have to rely on the on-board diagnostic 
system for openers, and a shop manual 
checkout procedure to find out if it's 
bad. This type (widely used on new 
cars) also was used on 1987-90 Jeeps, 
an occasional Toyota in the late 1980s 
and a lot of Nissans. These days you 
should ha ve access to factory service 
information (or a good aftermarket 
equivalent) for your car, so refer to it. 
Whether you install a new sensor 
or refit the one you've got, coat the 
threads of the 0 , sensor with anti-
seize compound.- ~

food's parking lot, you gra b a 
sip of the hot coffee you 
picked up at the drive-thru. You take 
your time as you place the cup in its 
holder in the center console. No 
hurry. The approaching traffic may be 
moving fast, but it's far enough away 
for you to accelerate up to cruising 
speed. Good thing, because at about

back off and let you sputter up to 
road speed . But now your engine 
sputters like a H arley idling at the 
curb, even at normal traffic speeds. 
And there's coffee all over the console 
from the vibration. 
What's Up?

and that none of them have been 
burned open by leaning against the 
exhaust manifold. You've touched 
every sensor connection to see if 
it's on tight, you've even checked for 
trouble codes. 
H owever, not everything ca lls fo r 
high-tech diagnostics and the latest 
scan tester. Engine misfire often is 
caused by leaking spark plug wires, so 
visual inspection could reveal what's 
wrong. The jackets may be damaged 
from the outside by abrasion caused 
by engine vibration (particularly at 
the plug-end boots), a hot engine 
compartment, spilled fluids or battery 
acid, multiple disconnections and 
reconnections for other service, or 
even a family of nesting rodents. 
Run the engine in near darkness, 
and then look and listen. If you see 
little electrical arcs, or hear a snap-
crack, there is high-voltage electrica l 
leakage. Of course, running the 
engine at idle doesn't exercise the 
ignition system very hard, so you can 
add something to the test by spraying 
the plug wire ends with clean water 
from a household spray bottle. 
Another test: With a jumper wire, 
ground the metal shank of a screw-
driver that has a well-insulated handle. 
Then, run the tip of the screwdriver 
along the length of each wire and all 
around at the coil and plug boots. This 
will often produce an arc from the wire 
to the screwdriver (Fig. 1). 
Now look at the wires under good 
lighting. If they are damaged by abra-
sion, oil-soaked, cut, burned from 
contact with the exhaust, or have a 
dried-out look with heat cracks, it 
definitely shouldn't be a surprise if 
you see arcs in the dark under some 
conditions. H owever, if they look bad

but th ere a re no arcs, do a resis-
tance check. 
A conventional plug wire has 
a resistance of 10,000 to 15,000 
ohms per foot of length-if it's

T he actual method of remov-
ing the o ld wire is not always 
" just pull it off." Pulling on the 
wire itself is sure to cause an 
internal separation (see p. 19). 
Of course, if you're replacing a 
bad wire, it may not matter, but 
if anyone of the old wires is 
still good, it's best to keep it as 
a spare.

Maintaining Your Tires 
A

But this can be avoided with 
careful tire maintenance. It the recent 
tire reca\ls and reports ot tread sepa-
ably when the tires are overnight cold, 
or when it has been at \east 6 hours 
since the vehicle was driven (Fig. 1). 
Don't try to "eyeba\l" a tire for nor-

Some tires always look underinflated. 
Some have stiff sidewalls and always

At least once a month, check your tire 
pressures- in your driveway, pref

which usually is on the driver's tront 
dooriamb or the matching surface on 
the pillar (Fig. 2) . These pressure 
specs usually are lower than the 
maximum pressure allowed on the 
tire's sidewall, but they're based on 
each particular vehicle and its rated 
load, not what the tires are physi-
cally capable of withstanding. 
Although tire pressure specifica-
tions usually peak at 32 to 36 psi, buy 
a tire pressure gauge that reads to at 
\east 60 psi. That'S a typical pressure 
specification tor a compact spare. 1£ 
the vehicle manufacturer specifies a 
pressure range, such as a minimum 
and a maxin"\llm, alwayS use the max-
imum. The higher the pressure, the 
greater the load-carrying capacity of 
the tire, the more stable the vehicle's

handling will be, and the cooler the 
tire will run at speed. All tires leak air 
pressure over time. The closer the 
tires are to the recom mended maxi-
mum pressure, the greater the safety 
margin for all operating parameters. 
A normal tire leaks about .5 to 1 psi 
per month. 
In addition, as ambient tempera-
tures drop with the changes of sea-
sons, so do the tires' air pressure-
one psi per 10°F. It might seem that 
the temperature-related drop is 
marched by lower operating tempera-
tures of the tires in cold weather. But 
the key to tire safety is adequate pres-
sure to carry your vehicle's load . 
Although higher rire pressures 
stiffen the ride somewhat, it's a small 
price to pay for the extra safety and 
the ability of the vehicle to accommo-
date greater loads. Maintaining 
proper tire pressure also improves 
fuel economy, although not by much. 
Caution: Overinflation increases 
center tread wear. 
Don't forget the spare. And note 
our earlier wa rning about the higher 
specified pressure for a compact 
spare. If your spare is carried in the 
underbody, as it is on many minivans, 
you'll need to crawl underneath with 
a pressure ga uge and air hose. 
MAINTAINING YOUR TIRES 
Inspecting Tires 
If you hit a road hazard such as a 
sharp rock, of course you're going to 
look as soon as possible for damage. 
But remember, even if the exterior 
looks fine, the tire may be damaged 
inside. Although it may not slow-leak, 
it could fai l suddenly. You'd be wise 
to get the car to a tire shop so the tire 
can be demounted and given an inter-
nal inspection. The few dollars is a 
grea t investment in peace of mind, 
and if there is internal damage, forget 
about a patch. Invest in new rubber. 
WEAR 
INDICATOR 
BAR 
to a sharp edge at one or both sides-
or much grea ter on one side is a sign 
of misa lignment. 
If you see cuplike wear in the 
treads, typically along one side, the 
possible causes are wheels that are out 
of balance, worn-out shocks or struts, 
and loose suspension components. 
The classic sign of unbalanced wheels 
is high-speed (50 mph and up) vibra-
tion, and it usuall y surfaces before the 
cuplike wear becomes noticea ble. Sus-
pension problems usually produce 
shake at lower speeds. 
Look for any cuts on the 
surface of the tire that 
expose the steel belt or fa b-
ric cord. This is grounds for 
immediate replacement. 
(Fig.3) Check the tread for cuts, foreign objects 
and abnormal wear. The wear bars will indicate 
Tires with unevenl y 
worn treads should be 
replaced, unless the prob-
lem is caught ea rly and 
there's plenty of trea d 
depth left. In tha t case, 
they could provide a mod-
erate amou nt of life on the 
rea r wheels, particu larl y 
on a fro nt-dri ve car. How-
ever, if yo u have an all-
wheel dri ve that you push 
when the tire is worn out. 
Wheel alignment also plays an 
important role in tire perfor mance. If 
the wheels are misa ligned, they don't 
roll true down the road. The side sli p-
page produces friction, which raises 
tire temperatures and not only 
increases tread wear but causes the 
wear to be uneven . 
So inspect the tire treads. As you 
do, pry out pebbles from the grooves. 
They reduce traction and can damage 
the tread a rea . 
The treads sho uld be deepest at 
midpoint-at least Ys in. thick. That's 
)\6 in. above the tread bars that are the 
official "replace them " indicators 
(Fig. 3). H owever, yo u need tread 
above those bars or the tire wi ll do a 
poor job of shedding any water and 
slush it runs into on the road. The 
wear pattern should be relatively even 
at each side, although it might be 
somewhat greater in the middle. 
Tread wear that is "feathered"-worn 
pretty hard, invest in an 
entire set of new tires. 
Wheel Balancing 
Most shops have off-car electronic 
balancers that allow the wheels to be 
rotated to any position without affect-
ing their balance. The disadvantage is, 
if there's any unbalance in the wheel 
hub, it won't be corrected. If this does-
n't cure the vibration, it's worth find -
ing a shop with on-car equipment 
before you try something else. In addi-
tion, make sure the shop has weights 
designed for your wheels. It takes at 
least a half-dozen differently shaped 
weights to fit properly on the rims of 
all the popular wheels. There are sev-
eral so-ca lled "uni versal" weights, but 
they may not fit your rim, and could 
pop off or cause rim damage. 
If the wheels are balanced and yo u 
have wheel shake at medium speeds 
on up, or the tires have cup wear, 
check the shocks and struts.

HOW IT WORKS 
Reading A Passenger Tire Sidewall 
A "P" or "LT" stands for pas-
senger car or light truck tire. 
The 3-digit number (215 on 
this diagram) is the tire 
cross-section width in mil-
limeters. The 2-digit number 
that follows (65) is the 
aspect ratio-the height of 
the sidewall relative to the 
cross-section. A lower num-
ber indicates a wide tread 
area relative to the side-
wall-today's sporty look. 
The letter "R" means radial 
tire construction. The next 2-
digit number (15) is the wheel 
rim diameter in inches. A 2-
~ 
.• ': .. . 
digit number following the 
size information is a load-ver-
sus-pressure rating. A letter 
that follows that 2-digit rating 
is a speed rating. Example: 
"S" is for a tire rated for 
speeds up to 112 mph. You'll 
also find maximum pressure 
(in psi and kilopascals), and 
maximum load (in kilograms 
and pounds). In addition, 
there are numerical or letter 
grades for relative tread life, 
traction and temperature 
(UTQG). The layout of the 
information may vary accord-
ingto make.

(Fig. 4) Minor scraping on the rim's lip is okay, but a

(Fig. 5) To avoid warping brake discs, tighten the lugs in a criss-

Sidewall Check 
Using a tire and wheel cleaning 
product wi ll give you a clear look 
at both the tires and wheels. You 
shou ld be able to find cracks in the 
wheel, damage beyond surface 
nicks to the tire sidewa lls, and 
damage to the bead area that cou ld 
be responsi ble for pressure leakage 
(Fig. 4). 
Tire Rotation 
Every owner's manual has a tire rota-
tion diagram, and tire rotation may 
seem like motherhood and apple 
pie- always good. H owever, this 
subject is not so simple. Cost of rota-
tion versus longer tire life is not a 
precise equation. It depends on the 
tires, the driving, wheel a lignment 
and suspension condition. Further, 
professional service is not always 
expertly done. Unless the lug nuts 
are tightened to specifications in 
three even stages, using a crisscross 
pattern (Fig. 5), the rotors may 
become warped, which adds to main-
tenance costs. If you let the mileage 
stretch out a bit, such as to 10,000 
miles or more, tires may develop 
almost imperceptible wear patterns 
that w ill affect ride when they're 
moved to a new positi on on the car. 
If you ca n 't rotate the tires often, you 
may be better off leaving them in 
place and accepting the somewhat

Jumpstarting Your Car

as the airliner door slams and the

Less than an hour ago, you parked your 
car in the middle of a lO-acre airport 
parking lot, expecting the vehicle to 
take YO Ll home when you return in five 
days. Except you realize that you forgot 
to turn off tbe headlights after your 
predawn departure from home and the 
warning bLlzzer hasn't worked for eons, 
if your car has one. And if it doesn't, 
there's no surprise- you've done this

you'll have to call the airport-approved 
towing service and drop close to a hun-

JUMPSTARTING YOUR CAR 
Neglect Is Abuse 
Lead-acid automotive batteries are 
actually remarkable at delivering 
extremely high current for the few sec-
onds it takes to start your engine, even 
in extremes of heat and cold. What 
they are not good at is being able to 
recover after delivering more modest 
amounts of current for a long time. 
Irreversible chemica l changes ta ke 
place. Specifically, sulphate needles 
that bridge the separator between the 
positive and nega tive plates form 
when a battery is deeply discharged. 
T hese needles not only internall y short 
the plates, ca using a high self-dis-
charge rate, they also coat the plates 
and interfere with the normal lead/sul-

Before you do anything else, check

CHECK FOR IMPRINTED POLARITY MARKS 
(Fig. 2) Make absolutely sure you've got the polarity correct 
whenever you work on a battery. If your battery has side ter-
minals, use these adapter bolts (right) when jumping it or use 
jumper cables with clips shaped for side terminals. 
HOW IT WORKS 
Deeply Discharged Batteries 
A lead-acid car battery, like any 
battery, has an internal resis-
tance, normally a few tenths of an 
ohm. This means that a charging 
voltage only a little higher than 
the battery's normal 12.6 volts 
will provide enough current to 
actually charge the battery at 
some decent rate, say, 10 to 12 
amps. But as the battery dis-
charges, its internal resistance 
goes up. And the curve is steep. 
When the battery is almost totally 
discharged, internal resistance 
can be high enough to prevent the 
13.5 to 14 volts your alternator 
puts out from doing any signifi-
cant charging. Charging current in this instance can be as little as only a few 
hundred milliamps until the battery's resistance goes down-and that might 
take many hours, or even days of charging at normal voltages. 
The answer is a high-voltage, high-rate professional charger that can 
supply as much as 25 to 30 volts for a brief period to give the battery a 
kick in the pants. This will generate a lot of heat, enough to cook a battery 
within a few minutes. Leave this business to a professional, and follow up 
with a normal 6- to 10-amp charge. 
work, and will damage the battery 
further. If you need a boost start to get 
home, well ... life's like that. 
Safety First 
Your first task is to get jumper cables. 
Preferably nice fat ones with a quality, 
heavy-duty set of clamps. This is more 
than just tool envy- there'S a lot of 
current passing along those wires, 
more than an arc welder, at least for a 
few seconds. Resistive losses in the 
cable can reduce the voltage available 
to your stalled car's electrical system to 
the point at which it will still be diffi-
cult to start, even with a healthy donor 
battery and alternator adding their all 
to the mix. It's important 
to use fat cables and to 
have good electrical con-
nections to reduce these 
losses to a minimum. 
A set of 6-ft. cables 
won't do you much good 
if you're parked nose-in to 
a parking space-wlless you feel up to 
pushing a 3-ton SUV back a truck length 
to make the engine compartment avail-
able. Twelve or 15 ft. is better, which 
makes using heavy-duty cables more 
important because resistance losses are 
proportional to the length of the cable. 
Keep your cables clean and dry to 
prevent corrosion from becoming a 
high-resistance factor. 
Doing The Deed 
It's nitty-gritty time. You've got 
cables, you've got a healthy donor car 
available. Open the hoods and posi-
tion the donor car nearby, so that 
your cables will reach. 
Some cars, like the one illustrated 
on the previous page (Fig. 1), have a 
remote positive terminal someplace in 
the engine compartment. The battery 
is mounted in an inaccessible area or 
with its terminals inaccessible even in 
the engine compartment. As for 
where to attach the jumper cable, this 
junction will be clearly marked and 
covered in a red plastic sheath. If in 
doubt, consult your owner's manual. 
Wear eye protection, even if it's 
only a pair of sunglasses. Once in a 
blue moon, a battery will explode

Options 
If your RV or second car is

periods of time, the battery 
will self-discharge. The 
simplest solution is to use 
when you try to jump it. 
Explode? Yes, explode. 
It's ca used by hydrogen 
gas, which is normally 
vented by a battery that's 
being charged or dis-
charged at a high rate, 
say, when you're trying 
to start a car, the battery

a jumpstart. H ydrogen is

the top of the plastic battery case off 
and spray acid into your eyes. 
Connect the red clamp on one end 
of the jumpers to the positive terminal 
on the dead car. Verify the polarity of 
the terminals by the plus symbol 
molded into the battery case (Fig. 2) . 
Don't just use the red terminal-
someone may have installed an incor-
rect, red-colored terminal onto the 
negative pole of the battery. Do the 
same on the positive terminal of the 
donor car. Start the donor car and let 
it idle. Lights, beaters, stereos and 
rear-window defrosters- all electrical 
drains- should be off. 
If possible, cover the dead battery 
with a shop towel or a sheet of card-
board. Any acid that manages to bub-
ble out of the vents will wind up on 
the cloth instead of on your clothes or 
the paint on the fender. 
Connect to the negative terminal of 
the donor car's battery with the black 
clamp. Verify the polarity. Now connect 
the remaining black clamp to the dead 
car's engine block, an accessory mount-
ing bracket or a protruding ear on a 
manifold. Use the battery's negative ter-
minal as a last resort. This procedure 
will generate any sparks far from any 
hydrogen gas venting from the battery 
and reduce the risk of explosion. 
Now wait. This will let the dead 
battery recharge slightly. It will charge

more when the dead car starts, but it 
will help tbe donor car's battery start 
your engine a little if you give it a 
quick shot of charge. If the dead car's 
battery had enough charge left to make 
the solenoid click and run the interior 
and instrument lights, then a minute or 
so is enough. If the battery was dead, 
dead, dead, give it 5 minutes or so. 
Crank, Zoom 
Now you can actually try to start your 
dead car. When the car starts, let it run 
at fast idle for another few minutes still 
connected to the donor car to continue 
charging by both alternators. Idling 
provides only a modest charge rate, so 
after a few minutes the best thing is to 
drive the car at normal speeds for 30 
to 60 minutes.

enough current to start a car with a

almost start, a 10- or 20-minute 
charge will get you on your way, out 
of the weather and with clean hands.

MODERATE 
Repairing a Leaky Radiator 
Y
our radiator is 
leaking. Well, it 
happens. If yo u 
haven't changed the 
coolant on a reasona ble 
schedule, it ca n become 
corrosive and eat 
through the radiator. 
Even normal shaking 
and vibrati on will even-
tu all y ca use separati ons 
between th e parts that 
are connected by solder, 
epoxy or mechanical 
crimps. Thermal forces 
from engines heating up 
and cooling down can 
ca use cracks in stressed 
areas. Sealing gaskets 
can compress and allow 
leakage. And if you have a rea r-drive 
car with a mechanica l fa n and weak 
engine mounts, the engine can lurch 
forward under braking far eno ugh 
for the engine-mounted fan to " ki ss" 
the radiator. O r it could be just plain 
bad luck-a rock gets thrown up and 
punches a hole in a tube. 
Whatever its root ca use, a leak is 
genera lly obvious. But what to do 
about the radiator? Replace it? After 
all, today's radiators are supposed to 
be unrepairable. This is not true at all, 
and the best thing you can do is take 
out the radiator and bring it to a radi-
ator shop fo r a free consultati on. If it 
can be repaired, you'll not onl y sa ve 
money, but the repaired original-
equipment (OE) radiator probably 
will be a lot better than a new dis-
count part. It's no different from any 
rebuilt automobile component, except 
that the radiator has no moving parts. 
Everything starts with removing 
the leaking radiator. Altho ugh doing 
so takes some care, it's a straightfo r-
ward job. In the easier cases, you can 
lift it out with shroud and fans 
attached, then complete the strip-
down on the garage floor. And even in 
a really tight engine compartment you 
can usuall y get it out without touch-
ing the alc lines, or at worst you 
would onl y have to unbolt the radia-
tor from the same module that holds 
the alc condenser. 
Begin by disconnecting the battery 
ground strap (even if the car has belt-
driven, rather than electrical, fans) . 
The next step normally is to drain the 
radiator, but before you do,

prepared to do a com-
plete drain-and-refill , this 
preliminary step ca n help 
prevent trapping a lot of 
air in the system. Air 
bubbles lead to engine 
hot spots and ping in 
summer operation, and 
poor heater output in the 
winter. 
If there's an underbody 
plastic cover at the front, 
remove it, even if it's not 
necessary to do so to drain 
the coolant. With the cover off, you'll 
surely be able to collect the draining 
coolant with less splash. You'll also be 
able to get to the lower radiator hose 
more easily, and you can inspect the 
lower end of the radiator as well. You 
might see a bolt-on connection to the 
condenser or the support member that 
you wouldn't otherwise notice. And

downflow radiators (tanks at the top

heater hose connecti on, as 
on a few cars, pinch off the 
hose just a few inches from 
the neck, using locking pli-
ers. (If necessary, use a pair 
of tongue depressors or 
popsicle sticks between the 
jaws to get a good squeeze.) 
With th e heater hose 
pinched, you won't lose 
coolant from the hea ter 
during the drain. It can be 
tough to get coolant to 
completely fill the heater on 
some cars, so unless you're

and let the radiator drain. Move tbe 
clamps off the necks toward the mid-
po ints of the radiator hoses (Fig. 1), 
then disconnect the hoses-including

at the radiator. If the hoses are heat-

good condition, slip a thin screwdri ver 
between the hose and neck, and work 
it around to free the hose, then twist 
the hose and work it off. Don't pry 
with a large screwdri ver or you could 
distort a metal neck or even crack a 
plastic one. You may find it necessary 
to ca refull y slit the hose with a sharp 
kn ife to get it to let go. Don't scratch 
the neck, or it'll lea k in the future. 
As you disconnect the lower hose, 
a fa ir amount of engine coolant is 
likely to flow out, so make sure you 
have a large catch pan underneath. 
Eva luate the radi ator insta llation 
and begin the wrench work to free it 
up. A typica l approach is to remove 
the upper mountlretainer on each 
side, or the single support member 
across the front. If there's enough 
clearance for the radiator to come up 
and out with its shroud and electric 
fans intact, just unplug the electrical 
connectors for each fan (Fig. 2) . If 
not, you'll often be able to just unbo lt 
the shroud and fa ns from the radiator 
and tilt them back to provide clea r-
ance to lift out the radiator.

31

Disconnect the overflow hose 
and if the reservoir is in the way, take 
it out. This can give you your first 
close look at the reservoir. Many 
reservoirs develop hairline cracks that 
allow hard-to-trace leaks, so if you 
have a leak here, you just may have 
saved a bundle. If not, keep working. 
If you have an au tomatic transmis-
sion, the radiator usually contains an 
automatic transmission cooler. Dis-
connect the cooler lines, a job that 
isn't always a simple wrench opera-
tion. In the easiest cases, there's a 
hose connection and a clamp. In the 
most difficult, tbere's a quick-discon-
nect fitting that requires a special (but 
inexpensive) tool to separate. If YO ll 
have a quick-disconnect, as on most 
Ford products, and YO ll can't get the 
tool, you'll find tbat the radiator end 
of the quick-disconnect has fittings 
that thread into the cooler. So a fitting 
can be unscrewed, but be careful. Use 
a tight-fitting wrench and unthread 
slowly, so you don't damage the 
quick-disconnect coupling. 
Whatever type the cooler connec-
tions are, be prepared to plug them. 
Yes, you want to a void transmission-
fluid leakage. But more critically, if 
any amount of coolant gets into the 
cooler or its lines, it can be sayonara 
for the automatic transmission. You 
can plug a hose end with a bolt. Plug 
a fitting with a rubber eraser, vacuum 
hose plug or some other clean, soft, 
flexible material that will stay in place 
(but also come out easily when you're 
ready to reinsta ll the radiator). 
All clear? Lift out the radiator and 
strip off any parts you were able to 
leave in place. Virtually all late-model 
vehicles have radiators with plastic

or both end tanks or the core rel-
atively inexpensively. 
tanks crimped onto the core. Your 
next step is to take the rad iator to a 
radiator shop that actually repairs 
plastic-tank radiators. The National 
Automoti ve Radiator Service Associa-
tion (NARSA) has been giving its 
members intensive training in the 
repair of these radiators, whether 
with copper/brass or aluminum cores, 
for several years (215/541-4500). So a 
radiator shop should know how to fix 
it, and not simply try to unbox a 
cheap new radiator and sell it to you. 
The cheap radiators just don't trans-
fer heat as well, and unless you can 
get a spectacular price on a well-made 
replacement, you're usually better off 
with a repair. 
Can it be repaired? 
Almost all car, light-truck and 
sport/ute radiators have plastic tanks, 
either with aluminum or copper/brass 
core sections. They're precisely engi-
neered to cool. And given today's tiny 
grille openings or no-grille underbody 
breathers, a cheap radiator is a bad 
gamble. It may look shiny new, but it 
could corrode and fail a lot faster 
than a properly repaired unit. 
When a radiator leaks, the most 
conunon causes usually are readily 
repairable at far less than the cost of a 
new quality radiator. It certainly has 
been true with the copper/brass radia-
tors largely out of use. It's even more 
likely with today's designs, particularly 
aluminum-core radiators, which can 
run $200 to $400 for a first-rate 
replacement. Here are some repair 
examples: 
• Leaking gasket between plastic tank 
and core: The shop uncrimps the 
tank, installs a new gasket and 
reet·imps the tank (Fig. 3) . It should 
cost less than $75. 
• Damaged tube (perhaps from a 
stone): These can be fixed for an 
extremely modest labor charge with 
special epoxy or solder. Even alu-
minum radiator tubes can be soldered. 
MAINTENANCE BASICS 

• Cracked plastic tank (perhaps 
from thermal stresses): A new tank 
today is relati vely inexpensive for 
most makes, so the job should cost 
less than $150. 
• Leaking header: The headers are the 
metal plates at each end of the tubes. 
The radiator tanks attach to the head-
ers, either by crimping a gasket joint 
or by soldering. O lder Ford radiators 
have epoxy sealing between the head-
ers and the tubes. If leaks occur from 
cracked epoxy, a radiator shop can 
remove the old epoxy and install a 
new sealing film using specially 
shaped guns and other tools. The cost 
is typica ll y about $175 to $200 for 
both ends of the radiator, about half 
the price of a new Ford radiator. 
• Fan "kiss" or corroded radiator: the 
core is smashed in or leaking from cor-
rosion pinholes. If the tanks are good, 
the shop can install a new core-per-
haps even an OE one- and reuse the 
old tanks, saving about 25 to 30% on 
the cost of a new radiator. And the 
result should be equal to a new OE 
radiator. If the OE rad iator is an inex-
pensive design, then there won't be 
much of a difference (perhaps less than 
$75), and you might as well buy new if 
it's in stock. However, one core fits 
REPAIRING A LEAKY RADIATOR 
many different sets of tanks, so stock-
ing cores is simpler for a shop. Result: 
The choice may come down to a new 
core that's available now versus wait-
ing for a new radiator and having to 
spend up to $100 more besides. 
Putting It All Together 
When you're ready to install, 
inspect the rubber support bushings 
for the rad iator. Many of today's radi-
ators are held by mounting systems 
that allow them to shake at a fre-
quency that absorbs engine vibration. 
Replace heat-cracked or oil-soaked 
bushings. Otherwise, engine idle will 
be rough and the radiator may shake 
itself into a leak. Clean the threads of 
oil-cooler quick-disconnect fittings 
and apply Teflon pipe sea ler before 
reinstallation. 
If your drained coolant was rela-
tively fresh, it's okay to put it back in 
if it's not contaminated with dirt, oil 
or transmission fluid . Otherwise, use 
a 50/50 coolant/water mix. If you've 
taken this opportunity to flush the 
system with water, then add half the 
system's capacity of pure coolant and 
top off with water. 
Always check the carmaker's 
instructions for filling a radiator-and 
then go beyond that and add a little 
more. Today's cooling systems are 
notorious for convoluted passages 
that balance heat transfer if the sys-
tem is full, but trap air bubbles if not 
completely filled. If there are air 
bleeds, they must be open during the 
fi ll-up. Jack up the front of the car to 
raise the pressure-cap fill neck before 
you pour in coolant. Even if the fi ll 
neck isn't on the radia tor itself, the 
higher it is, the better the system wi ll 
burp air as you pour in coolant. Make 
sure the reservoir level is correct and 
that the air-sealing gasket in the pres-
sure cap is in good condition, so the 
system won't draw in air as the 
coolant cools. 
And "thermocycle" the system, 
which simply means to warm it up, 
then let it cool down. Check the radi-
ator coolant level when the system is 
cool, and top it off if necessary. 
Once is not enough. Keep checking 
every day or so for a few weeks. Some 
air purging will continue, and the sys-
tem should draw in additiona l 
coolant from the reservoir. The reser-
voir level drops modestly? Hey, that's 
the way it's supposed to work. Top it 
off when necessary and you can con-
clude that all has gone well. (;

Full Inspection 
Actually inspecting the wheel and 
brake is the next step. Make a lign-
ment marks for the wheel and a lug 
stud before remova l so you're able to 
index the rim to the same stud. W ith 
the wheel off, inspect the mating sur-
faces of the w heel and disc hub sur-
face. If they're packed with dirt or 
bad I y rusted, clea n them tho ro ugh I y 
(use 100-grit sa ndpaper o r emery 
cloth). Remove sa nding residue w ith a 
cloth and bra ke solvent. Lu be spar-
ingly with a ntiseize. 
Look closely at both sides of the 
brake lining contact surfaces of the 
disc. Moderate scores (too sma ll to 
snag your fingernail on) are not nor-
ma llya concern, but rust o r other 
materials are (typica ll y brake li ni ng 
tra nsfer). R ust o ften occu rs on ca rs 
that sit for extended periods in damp 
climates w ith not-so-clean air. Use a 
fin er abrasive (200 grit) on the disc 
contact su rfa ces.

dence says unless a 
shop does a good jo b

choice, but even that shou ld be

If you can't bring runout down

.002 in. is the maximum. The thought 
of replacing the hub may not be 
appealing, but unless runout is far 
beyond reason and pulsation is intol-
erable, keep it in mind if nothing else 
surfaces as a possibility. A profes-
sional shop with an on-car lathe may 
(we repeat, may) be able to machine a 
disc so that it's referenced to the hu b, 
to compensate for a small amount of 
excessive hub runout. 
Brakes Not Releasing 
When there's an uneven thickness 
problem on the discs at relatively low 
mileage (under 50,000), acco mpanied 
by short lining life, it's possible the 
bra kes aren't releasing fu lly, allowing 
the shoes to stay in contact with the 
discs. A defective caliper piston 
(sticking when you try to push it 
back), a bad piston seal (not retract-
ing the piston) and a sticking ca liper 
are all possibilities. 
W hen the caliper doesn't slide 
smoothly back and forth, that's trou-
ble, and short lining life from fa ilure 
to retract the shoes completely is just 
one consequence. The brake shoes 
may also slap unevenly against the 
disc, another cause of pulsation. 
Most ca lipers slide along guide 
bolts or pins, through bushings with 
HOW IT WORKS 
Tire Imbalance 
Tire imbalance, per se, shouldn't cause a 
pulsating brake pedal. Brake pedal vibra-
tions are almost always caused by an out-
of-true condition somewhere in the braking 
system. But on rare occasions it can hap-
pen. Normally, each tire has to be bal-
anced statically first-i.e., so no part of 
the tire is heavier and always sinks to the 
bottom. Then they all need to be balanced

J 
plastic or metal sleeves. W hen you 
remove the ca liper (Fig. 4), inspect 
everythi ng. If the guide bolts or pins 
are corroded, replace them with 
brand-new ones, lubed with silicone 
grease (don't try cleaning them). 
Ditto (including silicone lube) for 
the sleeves if they're 
corroded or cracked, and 
the bushings if they are dete-
riorated. 
Rear Drum Brakes 
The rear drums are not as frequent 
a cause of pulsation as rear discs, 
but if they're warped, or if the lin-
ings are not making good contact, they 
certainly can be responsible. Unless a 
drum contact surface is badly grooved 
(grooves here are not as acceptable as 
on a disc), you'll need a drum gauge to 
check for taper or out-of-round. Or 
ask a machine shop to measure it for 
you, as the typical shop will do it for 
free or a nominal charge. Linings that 
are worn very unevenly are a tip-off to 
a drum that should be measured. Also 
check fo r broken springs, or springs 
that show obvious signs of weakness 
by allowing shoes to move easily. 
Invest in a good torque wrench, 
keep it in the trunk and use it to 
tighten the lug nuts instead of the lug 
wrench when you have a flat. You 
should enjoy smooth moderate stops

not brake pedal vibration. Even a 
tire with a high or low spot will nor-
mally be felt through the wheel. 
But once in a great while you'll 
find a tire that has inconsistent stiff-
ness. Some parts of the tire's side-
wall will be more or less easy to 
deflect under load than others. This 
won't show up on the wheel bal-
dynamically, so the rim doesn't wobble at higher speeds. 
Any imbalances from either of these conditions normally 
will manifest themselves as steering-wheel vibration, 
ancer, but will make a brake pedal pulsate at a rate pro-
portional t o your road speed. The diagnosis is to swap for 
a different tire and see if the problem goes away.

After 10 minutes of 
shoveling snow and ice 
from the roof and windows (not 
to mention 30 minutes of shovel-

to go to work. Twisting the key 
languidly brings the engine to 
life, much to your relief. But ... 
the windshield wipers leave 
streaks, the washers drizzle fluid 
inches short of the glass, the bat-
tery light flickers and the heater

good day for even a late-model

Winter Takes Its Toll 
The traditional tuneup is 
especially during damp 
winter days. This mois-
ture acts as a conductor 
along a path that nor-
mall y doesn't conduct 
electricity at all, and can 
leak enough current 
between the battery 
posts to prematurely 
drain your battery. In 
fact, consider replacing 
yo ur battery if it's more 
tban 4 years old. Newer 
cars tend to use sma ller

with high underhood

self-tuning, and don't have igni-

rated for five yea rs or far longer

Cars are still imperfect, mechani-
cal contrivances, however. Although 
many maintenance requi rements are 
reduced, there's still plenty of stuff 
that can break or fall off. An after-
noon of preventi ve maintenance will 
greatly reduce the possibility of bad 
things happening. It's autumn-the 
leaves are fa lling, but the weather is 
still relatively warm. A couple of 
hours of maintenance will be a lot 
easier to take now than a couple of 
hours of repairs when yo u have to 
shovel your wayan extra 50 ft. to 
work in an unheated garage. 
The Easy Stuff 
Clean. Clean out the interior and the 
trunk. Shampoo the carpets and the 
seats, because a winter of slush and 
melted snow will infiltrate dirt deep 
into the fibers, there to remain for-
ever. Dump the ashtray. Clean the 
wheel well arches and undercarriage 
of mud and road dirt, so that salty 
slush doesn't soak into them, provid-
ing a perfect environment for rust. 
Electrical 
While you're cleaning, clean the bat-
tery with warm water. Remove the 
terminals and wire brush them and 
the battery posts with warm water 
and baking soda (Fig. 1). Reattach 
the terminals and coat all exposed 
metal with petroleum jell y. You're 
not done yet-using some sort of

Check all light bulbs and replace 
any that aren't working. The days 
are short during the winter, and 
yo u'll depend on these bulbs for visi-

Underhood in General 
Still in an electrical mode, check the 
alternator connections and mounts 
for looseness and evidence of over-
heating. High electrical demands for 
lights, heater fa ns and rear-window 
defrosters, as well as recharging a bat-
tery abused by coaxing a reluctant 
engine to life, can make a marginal 
connection overheat. 
Check accessory belt condition and

Fall is a good time to change oil and filters. Check your 
owner's manual for the rating and viscosity, but most 
cars nowadays use an SL-service rated oil. This rating is 
some measure of the oil's longevity and resistance to 
oxidation and evaporation. SL oil is fine for older engines 
that specify an SG-, SH-, or SJ-rated oil, because the rat-
ing always improves when a new one is introduced. The 
SAE viscosity rating is a measure of how thick the oil is. 
All modern cars should use a multigrade oil, probably a 
5W-30 or lOW-30. The W in these ratings stands for a 
winter viscosity. A multigrade oil will be as thin as 
In spite of what your brother-in-law the shade-tree 
mechanic tells you, don't use a heavier grade of oil just 
because you used to in your older car. Modern cars were 
engineered to use 5W-20, 5W-30 or lOW-30 oil year-
round. Check the owner's manual to be sure. The lighter 
oils are also better on fuel con-
the thinner (5W- or lOW- rating) when the engine 
is first started. This will allow oil to flow more 
rapidly and lubricate parts that have had all the 
oil drain off of them overnight. A thicker oil 
might not be pumped to remote parts of the 
engine rapidly enough. On the other hand, a 
thicker oil (the second number in the rating) 
will resist becoming too thin when the engine 
reaches operating temperature. The American

EASY 
Repairing a Flat Tire 
'
here's rarely a more welcome 
sight than the inside of a warm 
garage late at night, as your 
door rolls open to welcome you and 
your fam il y home after a trip out of 
town. Particularly tonight, beca use 
you're far later than expected. Flat 
tires are generally no more than a nui-
sance-but this time you found your 
spare tire to be as flat as yesterday's 
beer. Fortunately, a nice young gentle-
man working in a gas station only a 
half mile up the road managed to plug 
your tire within a few minutes. You 
watch the inflation pressure of the tire 
for a week or so, and everything 
seems fine. 
Until a few weeks later. Then the 
same tire disintegrates suddenly on 
the interstate in heavy traffic. You 
manage to maintain control of your 
SUV by lifting partway off the throttle 
and gingerl y steering over to the 
shoulder, ignoring the cacophony of 
the fa i led ti re as it fla ps violently in 
the wheel well, shedding parts as it 
tears into pieces. It's not just flat, it's a 
smoking ruin, and there's substantial

damage to your wheel well's sheet-
metal to boot. Obviously, there was 
more damage to your tire than met 
the eye-and the nice fellow who 
repaired it for you didn't necessarily 
do you any favors. 
The Right Way-
And The Wrong Way 
The tire industry has a rule about 
externally pl ugging a tire with a 
worm. Don't. It's a qualified exclu-
sion, and we agree with it, for good 
reasons. An externa lly applied worm 
might be an acceptable emergency 
get-home-tonight quick fix, but a 
properl y trained tire technician must 
later complete the repa ir by removing 
the tire from the rim and doing a 
complete inspection of the tire for 
additional punctures and damage. 
Damage can come from not only the 
nail or whatever caused the air loss, 
but also from running the tire at low 
pressure or flat. Driving more than a 
few feet with the tire at zero inflati on 
pressure may ca use the rim to gouge 
the inner liner, damaging the body 
cord. Driving at more than a walk 
with the tire at very low pressure may 
build up enough heat to damage the 
sidewall beyond serviceability (Fig. 1). 
The portion of the nail or wire that 
entered the tire's interior may have 
flailed around and ripped the inner 
liner or plies (Fig. 2) . After inspecting 
the tire, the technician may apply a 
proper patch, remount the tire and 
reinflate it. 
Here's How 
Okay, we doubt many readers will 
ever repa ir a flat themselves because it 
in volves some pretty expensive tools. 
However, we've done it with nothing 
more than hand tools and a 12-volt 
portable compressor, and more than 
once, too. Once, it was late at night 
and we didn't want to wait for the tire 
shop to open. Another time, it was 
beca use we were in a very remote 
area, and a trip to town was nearly a 
two-day hike. 
Busted 
Wheel/tire assembly off the car ? 
(We've done it with the rim still 
bolted to the axle of a trailer but it's 
tough work.) Start by inflating the 
tire and submerging it in water to 
look for bubbles. Now ro ll the tire 
along the gro und in a good light to 
look for the puncture. Chalk any 
suspicious holes in the tread, even if 
there was no stream of tiny little 
bub bles associated with it. You'd be 
ama zed at how many times tires are 
taken in for repa ir with multiple 
punctures. Make a chalkmark on the 
tire sidewa ll next to the valve stem, 
because the tire should be reinstalled 
in the same index. Now you can 
remove the val ve core to completely 
M A IN TEN A NeE BAS I C S 

deflate the tire and demount it. 
Next, with a bright light, carefully 
inspect every sq uare inch of the 
inner liner. Pay particular attention 
to the areas inboard of the chalk-
marks you've made. Look fo r dam-
age caused by the fore ign object. 
Such a hole may be patched if the 
object hasn't damaged any cord, 
although any exposed cord usually 
means the tire should be scrapped. 
A few late-model cars come 
equipped with tires that can be run 
without any air at all, at least far 
enough to get to a place where 
they can be repaired. These tires, 
available from several different 
manufacturers, can be retrofitted 
to any car that uses an appropriate 
size tire. The sidewalls of these 
tires have an extra piece of molded 
rubber near the bead. This rein-
forcement is stiff enough to keep 
the rim from contacting the inside 
of the tire, even under cornering 
and braking. The tire and auto 
manufacturers specify an upper 
REPAIRING A FLAT TIRE 
Also look for peripheral damage 
caused by the tire being pinched 
between the rim and the pavement. 
Any damage to the inner liner that 
came about as a result of friction by 
being pinched and then driven makes 
the tire a likely candidate for imme-
diate replacement. 
Any punctu re through the sidewa ll 
of the tire automatically means the 
tire needs to be scrapped.

range-often 50 or 100 miles-

the performance of these tires 
with zero air pressure is so good, 
tire manufacturers require any car 
fitted with them to have a tire-

will alert the driver to the fact that 
he's driving on a flat.

(Fig. 3) A tubeless t ire puncture can 
be properly repaired only by breaking 
the tire off the rim and pulling a 
stem-type patch through the tread 
from the inside. 
Straight Holes 
If the hole makes a 25" or smaller 
angle to the tread, the correct patch to 
use is a " mushroom " patch (Fig. 3). 
The head of the mushroom provides a 
good adhesive seal to the tire's inner 
liner for proper air retention. The 
stem of the patch serves severa l pur-
poses. It plugs the hole to anchor the 
patch and, in concert with the chemi-
cal vulcanizing cemen t, prevents 
water fro m entering the hole and 
working its way into the tire's tread. 
Using a proper tire rea met; clean out 
the hole from the inside out (Fig. 4).

surface for bonding the cement.

tire buffing tool to remove the surface 
of the ru bber and leave a smooth tex-

through the liner into the ply rub ber 
or the cord . Brush, blow or vacuum 
the rubber dust away from the buffed 
area . Don't touch this area with your 
fi ngers or a rag. 
MAINTENANCE BASICS 

Coat your awl liberally 
with cement and run it in and 
out of the hole several times to 
carry the cement throughout 
the hole. Leave the awl in the 
hole until just before installing 
the patch so the cement stays 
liquid. Remove the peel-off 
tab from the patch, and put a 
single coat of vulcanizing 
cement on the head of the 
patch and the buffed area. 
Allow this to dry thoroughly, 
and don't touch the cemented 
areas because the moisture 
and oil in your fingerprints 
will prevent good adhesion.

Valve stem caps aren't there 
to simply backstop the valve 
core's air retention-they

the stem and out of your tire. 
Reinflate the tire. Use

close eye on your tire for a 
few weeks, both by monitor-

usually will cause an out-of-round 
condition and the ride will often indi-
cate it.

However, after the system has been 
shut off for a few minutes, pressures 
equalize, so you can check pressure at 
both of the service valve ports (one 
low-pressure, one high-pressure). 
They should be the same-roughly 
equal to the ambient temperature. 
GAP 
If pressure is less, the 
refrigeration system is low 
on refrigerant, and that 
could account for the fail-
ure of the compressor to 
engage. Have a profes-
sional trace the leak and 
then recharge the system 
with refrigerant. Inciden-
tally, if the service valve 
ca ps are missing, they 
could be the cause of your 
loss, as they provide the 
real seal, not the valve 
itself. Warning: Do not try 
to seal leaks withalc sealer 
prod ucts-period. 
Great, you think, at 
least in the old days, ordi-
nary folks used to be able 
to purchase R -12 refriger-
ant to punch up a tepid 
air conditioner. Not any-
more. And it won't be too 
long before R-12 is off the 
market completely- a vic-
tim of federal regulations 
that restrict the manufac-
ture of ozone-depleting 
chlorofluorocarbons. 
Fortunately, it's still 
possible for the average 
(Fig. 1) Gap between hublplate and pulley should close when 
alc is turned on. 
Important: Use only R-
12 in an R-12 system, R-
Saturday mechanic to fix some of what 
ails his air conditioner without having 
to open up the system. To keep you in 
the service picture, let's consider just a 
few of the common causes of poor-or 
zero---cooling that you can diagnose 
and cure. Start by acquiring the alc ser-
vice manual and electrical schematic 
for your vehicle. You'll also need a 12-
volt test light. A volt-ohmmeter comes 
in handy as well. 
No Cooling 
If the compressor doesn't engage, 
there will be zero cooling. An electro-
magnetic clutch should lock the drive 
hublplate on the compressor (Fig. 1), 
with the belt-driven pulley to spin the 
compressor shaft. 
The clutch circuit is fused, so check 
the fuse. The fuse is good? With the 
engine and the alc on, check to see if 
won't engage, it's bad. 
It takes special tools to change a 
compressor clutch. Unless you can 
rent them, leave this job to a pro. 
If the clutch engages when you jump 
it, there's a problem with the ground 
circuit, which may be wired through to 
the engine computer. Both circuit prob-
lems require straight electrical diagno-
sis and a good wiring diagram. 
However, the refrigeration system 
may also be involved. There's a low-
pressure switch in the current-feed 
circuit that is designed to keep the 
compressor from engaging when pres-
sure is low. 
See if there's enough refrigerant 
pressure to close that switch, which 
requires pressure gauges, and hoses 
that attach to your system. When the 
system is running, one half operates at 
low pressure and the other at high. 
134a in an R-134a system; 
never mix the two! Right now, there's 
still some R -12 around, so you might 
want to keep the system on R-12. 
However, if you ever have a compressor 
failure, the replacement will likely be 
compatible with R-134a, which would 
make changing over to the new refrig-
erant simpler. But this is not do-it-your-
self work. It takes special equipment. 
The alc pressure is normal? Appar-
ently, the problem is purely electrical. 
And in this case the first step is to 
check for a computer trouble code. 
The engine computer? You bet. On 
most American cars and some 
imports, turning on the air condition-
ing at the dashboard is just a request 
to the engine computer to provide the 
electrical ground to complete the com-
pressor clutch circuit. If the engine 
computer sees a reason not to, the alc 
won't come on. Possible reasons, in 
MAINTENANCE BASICS 

addition to low refrigerant, include 
warning signals from certain engine 
sensors. The coolant-temperature sen-
sor may be signaling a very high 
coolant temperature, and allowing the 
ale to come on could cause overheat-
ing. Or a power-steering switch may 
be signaling high pressure (as in a 
parking maneuver), and allowing the 
alc to come on could add to the engine 
load from the belt-driven accessories 
and stall the engine. Of course, some 
of these signals may be wrong, and 
you'll need to investigate the solution 
to these engine problems to get the alc 
online again. 
No computer trouble codes? Check 
for a bad alc clutch relay. Also, note 
SERVICING YOUR A I C 
that some of the computer sensors are 
not covered by trouble codes-the 
power-steering switch is a common 
example. If your car has one, bypass it 
for testing. If the compressor now 
comes on, replace the switch. 
No clues in the computer circuit? 
Refer to an ale circuit diagram to see 
what additional switches or relays are 
in the compressor-clutch circuit. On 
many cars of all makes (particularly 
R-12 systems), there's a switch that 
cycles the compressor clutch on and 
off to control performance. You can 
find out if the switch is bad by 
unplugging it and attaching a jumper 
wire across its connector. If the com-
pressor now comes on, the switch

the clutch isn't pulling in, there's no

apparently isn't closing. Confi rm this 
with an ohmmeter across the switch 
terminals. O n GM and Ford vehicles, 
the switch usually is on a large cylin-
drical can ca lled the accumulator. On 
many Chrysler products, it's in a 
block at the fi rewa ll. 
Bad switch? On late-models, the 
switch is mounted on a Schrader 
valve. As you unthread the switch, the 
valve closes so you won't lose any 
refrigerant. Grease the new O-ring 
with mineral oil, gently position it on 
45 

the port and then thread 
the new switch into 
place. 1£ the switch has a 
plastic body, a firm 
hand-tightening is 
enough. With metal, a 
gentle nudge with a 
wrench does it, because 
the O-ring makes the 
sea\. 
Note: Your circuit 
diagram ma y show other 
pressure switches. The 
variety is almost endless, 
depending on the type of 
vehicle, so without a 
diagram, you're in Guess 
City. Among the most 
common variety are a 
high-pressure cutout and a dedicated 
low-pressure cutout (often in addition 
to the cycling clutch switch). If the 
basic pressure check showed nothing 
awry, unplug and bypass these switches

achieved with a jumper wire acrosS the 
wiring connector terminals-but read

up as a signal. If so, 
simply unplug these to 
bypass. Double-check 
each switch with an 
ohmmeter. 
Many cars-particu-
larly Japanese models 
and many late-model 
Chrysler products-use 
a temperature sensor 
on the evaporator (the 
in-car heat exchanger 
that cools the interior 
air) in conjunction with 
an electronic module to 
cycle the clutch. The 
shop manual should 
provide specifications 
for a resistance check 
of the temperature sensor and 
where to connect a voltmeter to test 
for an output signal to operate the 
clutch. Make these checks under 
the dashboard. 
Poor Cooling 
The temperature of the 
air coming out of the 
registers will not neces-
sarily be very low on a 
humid, hot day. The alc 
may expend all its effort 
just wringing humidity 
out of the air, and the air 
blowing out of the regis-
ters easily could be as 
high as 60° to 65°F. If 
there is some cooling, 
but clearly not a normal 
amount, make this sim-
ple check: Is the front of 
the condenser (the heat 
exchanger in front of, or 
alongside, the radiator) 
free of bugs, leaves, road 
film and other debris? If 
it isn't, airflow is 
restricted. Clean the con-
denser with a soft brush 
and a detergent-and-
water solution (Fig. 3) .

MAINTENANCE BASICS 

If you've got a car that has 
either no grille or a tiny one, 
you've got an " underbody 
breather." Inspect any under-
body airdams and covers. 
If they're damaged or missing, 
they could be responsible for 
reduced airflow and poor cool-
ing. And on almost all cars, 
when the air conditioning is 
turned on, a radiator/con-
denser electric fan should also 
come on. If it doesn't, that also 
reduces airflow and a/c perfor-
mance, particularly in slow-

mance as anything. If the 
blower simply won't reach 
high speed, check the circuit 
diagram for a high-speed 
blower relay. You might be 
able to fix a bad connection 
by simply plugging in the 
w iring connector properly. Or 
you may find a broken wire 
by probing tbe wiring connec-
tor with a test light. 
Of course, if the airflow is 
normal, you'll wa nt to make 
sure a partial loss of coolant 
is not responsible for a drop 
in performance. Some older 
Japanese-made and some 
Chrysler systems (with R-12 
refrigerant) have a sight 
glass-
a tiny window into the 
refrigeration circui t. Check it 
to see if there are any bubbles 
when the clurch is engaged 
(bubbling w hen it's disen-
gaged or in the first few sec-
onds after engagement is nor-
mal ). Bubbles with the clutch 
engaged may-repeat, may-
indicate a low charge (Fig. 4) . 
Also, check operati ng pres-
sures wi th a pressure ga uge 
and compare them with fac-
tory specifications. You must 
use the specs beca use pres-
sures vary widely with ambi-
ent tempera tures. 
(Fig_ 4) Bubbles in the sight glass may mean the air 
conditioner is undercharged. Have a professional (using 
special equipment) recharge. 
Anotber common cause of 
poor performance: the heater 
core's bigh temperature is 
bleeding into what should be 
purely chilled air from the 
evaporator. Some heat transfer 
is normal if you move the tem-

from the max cold position. 
However, at max cold, there 
should be no hot-air bleed.

just a slight rise in pressure, thus 
killing the a/c. If your system runs fine 
with the car parked, but stops as soon

t's the second time this week that 
you've had to jumpstart your ca r. 
Bad enough first thing in the 
morning, when you can use the bat-
tery in your RV to give you a start-
but standing in a rainy Wal-Mart 
parking lot with your hood open and 
jumper ca bles in your dripping hands 
is just plain humiliating, not to men-
tion uncomfortable and inconvenient. 
The standard solution: Install a 
new battery- which means coughing 
up enough money to buy a new one 
and have it installed. 
A few minutes of attention once or 
twice a yea r can perhaps double the 
life of your battery, saving you cold, 
hard cash. And, just as importantl y, 
keep rain from running down your 
neck in shopping mall parking lots on 
stormy nights. 
Would You Like 
Fries With That, Sir? 
First, you need to determine if your 
battery is indeed fried or not. Other 
reasons for a no-start or barely start 
condition include, for openers, a mar-
ginal starter motor and high-resistance 
wiring in the primary (starter motor) 
CirCUIt. 
Open the hood. If your top-post 
battery terminals are covered with 
green fur that looks like it belongs in a 
bad sci-Ii movie, you'll need to clean 
that up'. Start by pouring some wa rm 
water over the terminals to dissolve 
the sulfation. This accretion is normal, 
but it can prevent good contact 
between the battery posts and the 
clamp, which in turn keeps your bat-
tery from providing enough voltage to 
start or prevents it from charging

negative connection from a

properly. Remove the termi-
nals, and brighten up all the 
metal with a wire brush-style 
battery post terminal cleaner 
and a baking soda paste. 
Don't splash liquid around 
the engine compartment or 
onto the paint, and rinse 
everything off thoroughly. 
Side-terminal batteries rarely 
look worse than dull, but 
that's enough to cause hard 
starting. Wire-brush the con-
tact surfaces to brighten them. 
(See page 80.) 
Dirt on the top and sides 
of the battery, even greasy 
dirt, can hold enough mois-
ture to create a current leak 
from the positive terminal 
d irectl y to the nega ti ve termi-
na' making your battery self-
discharge more rapidly. Leave the bat-
tery clean and dry. 
Now take a close look at the termi-
nal clamps on the cables. If they're 
eroded too badly to provide good 
mechanical contact, replace them. 
Warning: Whenever you work 
on a car battery, always disconnect 
the negati ve terminal first-not the 
positive (Fig. 1) . Why, you may ask? 
Simple: If yo u accidentall y brush up 
against the fenderwell or any other 
grounded metal part of the car 
while you' re unhooking the ground

MAINTENANCE BASICS 

HOW IT WORKS 
Maintenance-Free Batteries 
Like many things in life, 
the term "maintenance-
free" is only partially true. 
Lead-acid batteries nor-
mally consume some of 
the water in their dilute 
sulfuric acid electrolyte 
during a normal charge-
discharge cycle. It actually 
electrolyzes into hydrogen 
and oxygen and escapes 
as gas. So adding water 
periodically is necessary 
to keep the plates flooded, 
although it can't be done 
on some batteries. (See 
page 50) Maintenance-
free batteries use a cal-

cium alloy of lead instead 
of an antimony alloy, which reduces 
the amount of electrolysis. In addi-
tion, the amount of free-standing 
elect rolyte above the plates is 
designed to be much higher in a 
new maintenance-free battery. This 
means that there's enough elec-
trolyte to keep the plates covered 
even after a few seasons of normal 
use. So, during the battery's nor-

Avoid quickie afterm a rket univer-

the old clamp and clamp on the new 
one. Wh ile these have their uses (keep 
one in your on-car toolbox as a get-
home-tonight expedient) they'll 
develop corrosion between the clamp 
and the cable in a few months and 
leave you stranded, again . If you feel 
up to it and have a soldering iron

generating enough heat, you can sol-

not plumbing solder.

may extend the service life of 
these supposedly maintenance-
free batteries. 
you're lucky, you can pick up an 
appropriate cable at the auto parts 
counter. Generally, all they stock are 
simple one-lead cables, in positive and 
ground. Yes, there is a significant dif-
ference between the term inals 
on the battery, and you reall y 
ought to use a black-insulated 
cable on the ground and a 
red-insulated ca ble on the 
positive or the post will fit the 
clamp poorly, which is how 
you got into this mess in the 
first place. 
Unfortunately, it's not 
always that simple. Some bat-
tery clamps, both positive and 
negative, are soldered to more 
than a single wire. Yo u have a choice 
here. The best solution is to go to the 
dealer and get the correct piece. That 
may be inconvenient, and will cer-
tainly be expensive. Also (see page 
89), you may be able to get (at an 
auto parts store) a "cable repair sec-
tion" (terminal attached to a section 
of cable) . It's designed to attach to 
cable ends from which the battery 
connections and extra wires have 
been amputated. Or you can solder 
lugs of the appropriate size and gauge 
to the extra wires, and then attach the 
lugs to the clamp either by means of 
the clamp bolt or a large sheetmetal 
screw into the clamp body. Look for a 
clamp with an extra terminal if this is 
necessary, although if you've got side-
term inal batteries this might be 
impossible. As a last resort, splice and 
solder the cables together ahead of the 
terminal. Be sure to use shrink tu bing 
to cover the splice, especially if you're 
splicing the positive side.

Write down the reading. 
Squirt the liquid back and 
repeat with the next cell. All 
six cells should have readings 
that agree within 0.050, or 
you've got a bad cell. These 
readings are temperature sen-
sitive, so if it's very cold or hot 
out, you may need to correct 
the readings. The hydrometer 
scale equates the specific grav-
ity of the electrolyte with the 
state of charge of the battery. 
If all the readings agree, and the 
gravity is low, the battery needs 
to be charged. 
Charge 
An alternative to the hydrometer test 
(and one used by professionals): With 
the battery charged, open circuit voltage 
should be 12.6 to 12.8 volts with the 
engine off and all loads off. With the car 
running and all loads off, the voltage 
should be between 13.6 and 14.5 volts. 
Disable the engine by pulling the 
fue l pump fuse. Measure the battery 
voltage while cranking the engine. It 
should read at least 9.5 to 10 volts 
while cranking. 
If the charging voltage is low, sus-
pect some charging system problem. 
But if the charging voltage is correct 
and the cranking voltage is low, then 
the ba ttery is suspect, as you've 
already troubleshot the wiring from 
the battery to the starter and ground. 
(Fig. 5) Battery hold-down clamps are 
essential to prevent a battery from 
becoming ballistic. 
Strapping In 
Replacing the battery is straightfor-
ward. It's vital that the hold-down 
clamps be reinstalled properly (Fig. 5). 
Some batteries use a wedge/lip 
arrangement at the bottom of the bat-
tery, while others (usually in older 
cars) use a pair of long bolts and a 
frame or lip to hold the battery down 
to the tray. A battery is perfectly capa-
ble of holing a radiator or smashing

Time Is On Our Side 
The useful life span of an average 
automotive battery is four to seven 
yea rs. With the auto companies' 
eternal quest to make cars and 
trucks more efficient, two things 
have conspired to shorten this life 
span: smaller batteries and higher 
underhood temperatures. Higher 
temperatures are so damaging that 
many cars have insu lating blankets 
for the battery, or the battery is 
mounted in the trunk. 
A single instance of deep-discharg-
ing a battery can reduce its life span 
by half, so avoid running a battery 
into deep discharge. If you do, then 
charge it properly as soon as possible 
before the plates inside build up a 
layer of sulfates. A properly charged 
battery won't freeze, but a discharged 
battery wi ll freeze at temperatures 
well above zero. Any battery that's 
been frozen is finished. 
REPLACING A BATTERY 
FLOATING 
BALLS 
(Fig. 1) This battery hydrometer shows 
a fully discharged cell. 
How Can You Tell? 
Is one cell of the battery visibly differ-
ent than the others? Look through the 
side of a translucent-cased battery. If 
one cell has substantially less electrolyte 
than the rest, or if one cell's lead plates 
are much lighter in color, then that cell 
has gone bad and the battery is junk. 
Charge the battery for an appropriate 
time (depending on how powerful your 
ba ttery charger is) a nd then use a 
hydrometer (Fig 1) to measure the spe-
cific gravity of the electrolyte. The more 
charge on the battery, the more sulfuric 
acid there is in the electrolyte and the 
higher the hydrometer float wi ll be on 
the scale. A battery that shows a low 
state of charge on the hydrometer after 
(Fig 2) Use a battery cutoff switch to 
diagnose parasitic current drains. 
a long charge is dead. Don't rush to 
judgment, however, because a deeply 
discharged battery will take a charge 
very slowly at first. 
Is there some parasitic drain in your 
vehicle that's discharging your battery? 
An easy way to check is to temporarily 
install a battery cutoff switch (Fig 2) in 
the ground side. With everything in the 
car shut off, put an ammeter across the 
switch, turn the switch off, wait at 
least one hour, and measure the cur-
rent drain. Up to 40 milliamperes (ma) 
is normal to keep the vehicle comput-
ers, radio presets and clock alive. Any-
thing more than 200 ma will run your 
battery down in a few days. 
Transplant 
Once you've determined the battery is 
bad and the charging system and the 
rest of the electrical system is good, 
it's time to install a new battery. Start 
by rinsing the bad battery and the sur-
rounding area with plenty of water. 
This wi ll wash away any splattered 
battery acid, which otherwise would 
eat through sheetmetal, electrical 
wiring and the seat of your britches. 
Try not to splash it around. 
Next, disconnect the battery's neg-
51 

ative terminal. If you accidentally 
touch your wrench to anything 
nearby, no big dea l. Then, you can 
unhook the positive side. If you try to 
unhook the positive side first, any 
random contact with nearby metal, 
such as the inner fender, will result in 
a welder-like shower of sparks and 
heat. Removing the ground side first 
breaks the circuit and prevents this. 
Side-terminal battery hardwa re is 
notorious for not wanting to turn . Try 
tapping lightly with a hammer, and 
rotating the wire terminal slightly as 
you turn the wrench. Top-post battery 
termina ls are sometimes very difficult 
to release. Light tapping may help, 
but you stand the chance of breaking 
the post off if you apply any substan-
tial force. You may need to use a bat-
tery post tool to elevate the clamp 
loose from the post. 
Nurse! Clamp! 
Now's the time to seriously evaluate 
all of the wiring and clamps. This 
hardware carries substantial amounts 
of current- hundreds of amps for 
short periods when starting the car, 
and dozens for longer periods when 
the engine is running. It's imperative 
that it all be in good shape. The 
clamps should not be deformed. Light 
corrosion can be wire-brushed off, 
and a paste of baking soda will help 
neutralize any acid. Rinse thoroughly. 
If the attachment point of the wire to 
the metal clamp is good, fine. If the 
clamp or the connection is nasty-look-
ing, you should replace the cable. 
Reserve the clamp-on, universal cable-
end terminals for emergencies-they 
won't last as long as a proper connec-
tion and may contribute to yet 
another premature battery failure. 
Remember that the positive and nega-
tive posts on top-post batteries are 
physically, as well as electrically, dif-
ferent. Don't interchange. You may be 
able to rehabilitate an otherwise good 
term inal clamp by replacing the bolt-
but be sure to use a lead-plated battery 
terminal bolt, not just something left 
over from installing your screen door. 
How Dry I Am 
Most conventional batteries are 
shipped without any electrolyte in 
them. If you have a good auto parts 
store, they'll keep a supply of ready-to-
use batteries in assorted sizes on hand. 
If not, you'll have to have one filled 
and charged. Here's the procedure: Fill 
the dry battery with electrolyte of the 
HOW IT WORKS 
correct specific gravity. Any place that 
can sell you a battery wi ll have this. 
Fill to the bottom of the filler neck, no 
higher. Now wait several hours while 
the electrolyte seeps into the spongy 
lead plates. The level will go down, but 
as long as it covers all of the plates 
inside you can proceed to charging the 
battery. At this point the battery proba-
bly will start the car- but it's important

But many of them have a built-in

tester. This is a Plexiglas wand that 
sticks down into the battery just 
below the normal level of the elec-
trolyte. At the bottom of this is a 
small chamber containing a 
loose plastic ball that floats in 
the dense electrolyte when the 
battery is charged. When it's 
floating, you can see the green 
ball at the top window through 
the Plexiglas. When the battery 
is discharged, the ball sinks and 
all you can see is the dark elec-

is too low, the plastic wand's 
bottom isn't submerged in it, 
and you'll notice a light color 
through the window. This means 
it's time to replace the battery.

one of which could be faulty.

market shock absorbers made for 
pickups and SUVs used primarily as 
transportation, and they wi ll help. If 
you want more, there are additional 
steps you can take to further restore 
the ride and handling. 
Springs and Shackles 
Look at the leaf springs-at the rear 
on each side, even at the front if 
yo ur vehicle also has them there. 
Loose center U-bolts are an occa-
siona l problem, and retighten ing 
with a torque wrench co uld be help-

down sign ifica ntly, look closely for a 
cracked leaf (Fig. 1), and if yo u find 
one, change the spring, plus the 
mounting bushings and shackle in 
back. In fact, even w ith the leaves 
intact, there can be enough deterio-
ration in the rear shack les to justify 
rep lac ing both for a rea l ride

Take out the bolts that hold the 
spring assembly at front and rear, 
() () 
which can be easier said than done in 
many cases. Turning the bolts while 
holding the nuts with a second wrench 
is straightforward stuff (Fig. 2), but 
the rear bolts can almost "mate" with 
the rubber bushings inside the 
shackle, and getting them out can be a 
ted ious job if that happens. You may 
have to slowly unthread the bolt,

to tap it out with a hammer and

the end of the leaf spring, which could 
snap up (against the frame) if there's 
still some tension on the spring.

The Leaf Spring Suspension 
The leaf spring suspension is a popular 
choice for the rear of trucks and some 
sport utility vehicles. It has been used 
for some heavy-duty truck front sus-
pensions and the rear of passenger 
cars, but the leading application is the 
truck/SUV with the nonindependent 
rear axle. The leaf spring has several 
leaves-simply adding leaves 
increases the load-carrying ability of 
the suspension. The top leaf typically is 
the longest and each end of that leaf is 
formed into an eye, into which a rubber 
bushing is installed. The spring eyes 
are bolted to the chassis in front and 
attached at the rear through a hinge 
joint called a shackle. The shackle permits the spring to 
effectively change its length as it flexes to absorb 
impacts. The leaf spring also attaches (through U-bolts) 
to the solid rear axle, so it locates the axle without the 
use of arms, an important function. This permits a simple 
MAINTAINING AND REPAIRING YOUR SUSPENSION 
suspension design with obvious packaging benefits. How-
ever, these advantages are offset in passenger cars and 
some SUVs by the superior ride qualities of the coil 
spring, which merely supports the vehicle and simply 
compresses and expands as it absorbs the impacts.

and it won't clear the frame to come

until the shackle end of the leaf 
spring comes down far enough below 
the frame. 
The original equipment bushings 
with those metal shackles are part of 
the reason for loss of ride quality. To 
get a long-term smoother ride, install 
aftermarket shackles that include 
small rubber springs with two metal

sleeve inserts and metal arms-almost 
a reverse of the original equipment 
design. The Dana Velvet-Ride series 
that we installed is an example. You 
a ttach the metal arms to one metal 
sleeve of the rubber shackle, insert 
and tighten the through bolt and nut, 
and then install the new shackle in 
place of the original. The metal arms 
connect to the chassis and the rubber 
spring, and the rubber spring is bolted 
(through its second metal sleeve) to 
the leaf spring. 
Inspect the underbody frame-to-
body bushings (Fig. 3) and the radius 
rod bushings, and apply rubber 
lubricant as routine maintenance. If

they're badly cracked, perhaps miss-
ing chunks of rubber, installing 
replacements will help eliminate body 
shake. Occasionally, the metal floor 
pan of the vehicle is the problem- it's 
rusted and weak. A piece of galva-
nized flat sheetmetal, thick enough for 
support, should be welded in place. 
Even if you just have to replace 
bad bushings, don't simply loosen the 
bolts and pry to get clearance to 
install replacements, or you could 
cause damage you won't see. This 
work normally requires loosening 
radiator mounts, the steering gear and 
column, and other parts, so check and 
fo llow the fa ctory-prescribed proce-
dure for your vehicle. Or better still, 
lube periodically and the bushings 
will be fin e. 
Steering Stabilizers 
Is a lot of vibration coming through 
the steering wheel? The problem 
could be wheel balance or alignment, 
even the steering gea r's free play 
ad justment. But if it's a low-speed 
problem on secondary roads, look for 
something worn out. 
If your operation has pounded the 
tightness our of steering parts, you 
can feel the looseness when you grab

the tie rod and idler arms and find 
you can flex them too easily. If you 
want to replace them just this 
once, get heavy-duty parts specifi-
cally designed for pickups and 
SUVs. They'll not only be labeled 
for heavy-duty use, but they'll have 
grease fittings, which the original 
equipment may not. 
Many vehicles have steering 
stabilizers. If the vehicle is suffering 
from vibration and shimmy, look 
for worn-out stabilizers, basica lly 
one or two horizontally installed 
"dampers" (shock absorbers) that 
connect the steering linkage to the 
frame or axle (Fig. 4) . 
The dampers mount to the 
steering linkage with a bracket 
(held by U-bolts) and to the frame 
or front axle with another bracket, 
and there are washers and rubber 
bushings at each end. If they're 
loose but the bushings look good, 
a simple tightening may remedy 
the problem. When they have signifi-
cant mileage on them, replace the 
dampers along with mounting hard-
ware and bushings. 
If you don't have stabilizers, but 
use the vehicle on bad roads a lot and 
want to get rid of the shimmy, there 
are kits you can install, complete with 
frame brackets and U-bolts. These 
kits have been a factory fix for other-
wise unfixa ble shimmy for years, and 
aftermarket kits for trucks and SUVs 
are available. 
Jounce Bumpers 
Have the rear axle jounce bumpers 
been taking a beating? If they have, 
you may see that the ends are scuffed. 
However, you proba bly know with-
out even looking whether or not the 
vehicle has been bottoming. If you 
get stiffer shocks, your normal ride 
will suffer. A better approach is to 
replace the jounce bumpers with 
ones that rea lly are small rubber 
assist springs, such as Monroe's 
Muscle LSE. They look like a short 
stack of thick pancakes, and when 
you're driving on bad roads they 
make contact with the jounce pad on 
the axle and prevent bottoming out. 
You could perceive this as causing a 
slight stiffening of the ride, but the 
bottoms of the "short stacks" have a 
couple of inches of clearance to the 
pads, so they're onl y in the p icture 
MAINTAINING AND REPAIRING YOUR SUSPENSION 
on bumps. And because they're 
springs, they absorb impact so the 
overa ll ride quality should be better. 
On many trucks, you can just 
unbolt the bracket that holds the orig-
inal jounce bumper, bolt on a univer-
sal bracket (with elongated holes) and 
attach the "short stack. " If the jounce 
bumper bracket is riveted to the 
frame, use a chisel or hand grinder to 
cut it loose. 
After installing the bracket and 
rubber spring, tighten the bracket 
bolts lightly, then lower the vehicle to 
the ground, adjust the bracket height 
to the recommended clearance with a 
normal load in the truck bed, and do 
a final tightening. t6

Replacing Shock Absorbers

literally and figuratively, downhill.

Of course, you could get the 
jouncy ride of worn shocks at much 
lower mileage, perhaps because you 
drive briskly on bad roads and accel-
erate the wearing-out process. Or 
maybe the shock mountings have 
loosened. Occasionally, a shock pro-
duces a visible leak of fluid, but some 
hint of weep is normal, and most 
shocks we've seen that were well 
worn out, also looked bone dry.

HOW IT WORKS 
Shock Absorbers Don't Absorb Shocks 
A shock absorber doesn't absorb shock (the spring does 
that, by flexing to absorb the energy of an impact). The 
shock absorber actually stops the vehicle from bouncing 
up and down on the flexing spring. It does this by transfer-
ring the spring-flexing energy to a piston in an oil-filled 
Single- and double-tube shocks are used on either the 
front or rear end of most vehicles. Struts are simply a 
shock that includes the spring perch and a bearing that 
replaces the upper ball joint. 
chamber, which dissipates it in the form of heat. Most 
shocks have twin-tube (chamber) arrangements, an inner 
chamber with the piston and a calibrated valve at the 
bottom, which has the entry passage to an outer cham-
ber-the reservoir. When the piston comes down on com-
pression, it forces fluid through the calibrated 
valve into the reservoir. When the piston moves up 
as the shock absorber extends, oil is drawn from 
the reservoir into the main chamber, and some 
also flows through orifices in the piston, as part of 
the ride control calibration. A charge of low-pres-
sure gas in the reservoir reduces oil foaming, 
which would affect ride control. Many high-perfor-
mance shocks, including some for heavy loads 
such as motorhomes, are of single-tube construc-
tion, with a high-pressure gas charge in the base. 
Fluid flow is between the areas below and above 
the piston, which has a sophisticated valve 
assembly. The higher pressure of the single-tube 
design is even more effective against fluid aera-
tion, but at the expense of ride comfort. Strut 
replacement is sometimes a job for a pro with the 
right tools and coil spring compressors. 
REPLACING SHOCK ABSORBERS

tools available for holding the shock 
rod, in an assortment of sizes, at

it could be more than that. 
Just check the manufacturer's cata-
log, and if there are shock absorbers 
listed for your exact year, make and 
model, and the listing says it covers 
the electronic control sys-
tem type, you're cool. You 
will be giving up the elec-
tronic control, but there 
isn't a system that's all that 
sophisticated on anything 
but a few premium cars, 
such as Cadillac, M er-
cedes, Corvette and some 
other high-end sports cars. 
If the afterm arket cata-
log doesn't I ist a replace-
ment, you're stuck with 
ordering replacement 
shocks from a dealer. On 
some Ford products there's 
an external motor drive, 
and you can unplug it 
from the old shock and 
install it on the new one. 
(Fig. 4) Generally, a 
socket will spin off the 
mounting hardware. New 
hardware is usually 
included with the shock. 
In most other cases, you 
get a choice of shock 
absorber designs. 
Getting the 
Shock Off 
If there's an electrical 
connector, start by 
unplugging it. No elec-
tronics problem with 
installing conventional 
shocks? You could 
just cut the wiring, 
and tape securely. But 
if there's any chance you 
or a subsequent owner 
will want to re-establish 
the system, that won't work. 
If the connector is in the 
trunk, that's easy (just tape 
over it). But if it's under-
neath, find a safe location 
away from exhaust heat, 
pack it with pieces of plas-
tic foa m stuffed against the 
terminals, put it into a heavy plastic 
pouch, seal and hold it in place with 
a ca ble tie. 
Loosening a rust-frozen nm and 
bolt is one of the major headaches in 
shock replacement. If a nut is 
exposed, yo u should be able to 
loosen it with a nut splitter, a c1amp-
like tool yo u often can rent from an 
auto parts store. No space for the 
splitter? Penetrating solvent, fol-
lowed by heat from a torch, is 
another possibility. The most diffi-
cu lt is the type where the piston rod 
turns when you try to loosen the nut. 
One approach is to clamp locking 
pliers onto the "do uble-D" end of 
the piston rod, hold it from turning 
with the pliers and loosen the nm 
with a conventional wrench (Fig. 2). 
Something better (pa rticularly for 
recessed installations) is a special 
toolkit with a hollow hex that fits 
over the rod onto the nut, followed 
by a wrench (made to fit the double-
D ) that goes through the hollow hex 
onto the double-D end (Fig. 3). Inex-
pensive kits, with three hollow hexes 
for most U.S. makes, or even some 
for specific models, are readily ava il-
able in auto parts stores. It comes

U.S. makes. There's also one specifi-

conventional hex, yo u can 
use an ordinary socket, of 
course (Fig. 4) . 
Many shocks are 
mounted on studs, and 
we've even seen those 
where the shock upper 
mount has a retaining 
bracket held by an addi-
tional stud and bolt. It's 
not a major difficulty, just 
extra hardware to remove. 
When you get the nuts off 
a stud mounting, you still 
have to pry off the shock, 
wo rking evenl y at top and 
bottom so it doesn't cock. 
If you're not sure of the 
condition of a bone-dry 
shock, just disconnect it 
from the bottom mount if 
possible (or remove it com-
pletely if it's on studs). 
Then slowly compress the 
shock (even low-pressure 
gas shocks will be easily

compressed). If you feel any lost 
motion ("looseness" or unevenness), 
th e shock is worn out. 
Installing New Shocks 
If you're on a budget and installing 
nongas shocks, it's a good idea to 
make sure they don't have air inside 
and bleed it o ut if they do. (Don't try 
this on old shocks. If they have air 
inside, it's from internal wear, and 
bleeding is not a cure.) With new non-
REPLACING SHOCK ABSORBERS 
gas shocks, bleed by holding each 
shock upright (insta lled position): 
Extend it, and then turn it upside 
down and compress. Repeat the pro-
cedure a few times and the new shock 
sho ul d operate smoothl y, with some-
w hat grea ter resistance on extension . 
Using adjustable shocks? Some 
have soft, normal and fir m positions, 
and although yo u can make adjust-
ments after installati on, start with 
soft or normal (firm is best for " ride 
restoration " after tens of thousa nds 
of miles of use). 
The mounts for replacement shocks 
often are very different from those for 
the originals. That's okay, so long as 
you follow the instructions carefully. 
A common example is the aftermarket 
hardware for the "stud-in-bushing" 
design used on many General Motors 
ca rs. T here's a speciall y shaped steel 
replacement stud assembly that goes 
into the lower mou nting, and the 
bushing that's in the replacement 
shock just slides onto it (Fig. 5). 
If the shock mounts on studs and 
the nut is tough to thread on, clean 
th e threads with a wire brush and 
apply penetrating oil/solvent. If the 
nut almost spun off, apply a film of 
thread-locking compound to the stud. 
If you ca n tighten the shock hardware 
to specs without distorting the bush-
ing, that's ideal. If the nut hits the end 
o f the threads and the bushings are 
loose, you've got the wrong ones- or 
yo u're missing some hardware. ~

Maintaining Your Exhaust System 
T
he sign says "DIP." And it's not 
advertising a samba school-
there's a dip in the pavement 
large enough to lose a first-grader in. 
You touch the brakes lightly to keep 
from spilling your java as you traverse 
it. But there's a sudden graunching 
noise from under your car, followed 
by the scream as about a gallon of 
fast-food coffee £lenses the skin from 
your thigh. You pull over to inspect 
your leg and the underside of your car, 
in that order. There are big, hot 
chunks of metal hanging loose under 
your chassis, and the exhaust system is 
nea rl y draggi ng. 
Today's exhaust systems consist of 
a lot of expensive parts. Tbere are 
one or mo re catalysts, an oxygen sen-
sor, maybe even a 2-stage muffler. 
There's piping that's not only shaped 
to clear underbody lines, but also 
may be made of premium metals, in 
some cases dual-wa ll tu bing. There 
a re sheetmetal underbody beat 
shields to prevent tbe exhaust from 
igniting dry grass. 
Wbat's bolding everything 
togetber? A few clamp joints and 
some welds. What's bolding every-
thing up? A few pieces of rubber with 
some brackets. What's keeping every-
thing aligned? Those same few pieces 
of rubber and brackets. Failures are 
common and they range from cracked 
rubber to failed welds. 
Before you suffer the same expen-
sive fate we described earlier, take 
time to perform a regular underbody 
inspection-it's easy. To get started, 
jack up the car and support it on 
safety stands front and rear. Now 
you're ready for an in-depth look. 
Hangers 
If any hanger is broken, it has to be 
replaced, witbout delay- even if the 
exhaust system seems to be hanging 
level. One broken hanger means tbat 
when the system moves up and down 
as you drive, a whiplash effect goes 
through tbe clamped and welded 
joints. Eventuall y clamps loosen and 
welds crack. 
Replacing a broken hanger used to 
be simple, because most companies 
used some type tbat bolted to the 
body and clamped to some part of the 
exhaust system. Today, the most pop-
ular design uses rods welded to the

help if the bracket has broken loose at 
the weld line. 
pipes and, often, to the vehicle under-
body (Fig. 1). These hangers also have 
a thick rubber section that resembles a 
flattened football or beacb ball, witb 
boles for a rod at each apex of the 
rubber. Welding positively locates all 
the parts, and although you may have 
to tug and pry, replacing the rubber 
piece when it becomes cracked is very 
stra igh tforwa rd. 
You can install a brand-new p ipe 
if tbe rod comes off the pipe, but if 
the pi pe itself is good, tb at's an 
unnecessa rily tough and expensive 
replacement. The altern ative is to 
install a universa l hanger, th ough 
this may require a bit of jury-rigging. 
First, remove the broken hanger. 
Then look for a nearby hole, perhaps 
even fro m the old hanger. Take a uni-
versa l hanger that can tw ist and tilt 
and has an adjusta ble length setup, 
and attach it to the underbody with a 
bolt (a nd if it isn't threaded, also 
with a nut) through that hole. Next, 
make the connection around tbe 
pipe-
a simple clamp and U-bolt 
usuall y works (Fig. 2) . Don't be sur-
prised if a part of the welded-on 
bracket (from the bro ken hanger) 
has to be cut or ground off to pro-
vide space fo r th e clamp that w ill 
attach to the uni versal ha nger. You 
sho uld try to make attachments very 
close to the locations of the original 
equi pment setup'. This will ma intain 
system a lignment and the balanced 
hang of the entire system. 
If there is noise fro m exha ust 
system contact with the underbody or 
an underbody part, you should check 
fo r da mage underneath. Exhaust sys-
tem clearances are limited, and if you 
see the need to increase one, it may 
be possible to bend or shim an origi-

hanger is welded in place, see if yo u 
can bend it with a piece of pipe over 
the rod's open end. If you need more 
than Y< in . or so, look for an alterna-
ti ve. If the hanger is a bolt-on to the 
body, for example, you may be able 
to install washers as shims. 
Some older imports have rubber 
hangers that resemble thick ru bber 
bands. If the old band has broken off, 
you can get a replacement, but 
installing it is not a matter of simply 
stretchi ng it over the retaining tabs. 
The band is so thick and stiff you 
pro bably will have to pry pretty hard 
to get it on. 
Ma ny exhaust systems have a 
bracket to provide firm support close 
to the transmission. If the bracket 
cracks- or if it was removed for ser-
vice and never reinstalled-that can 
account for a lot of exhaust system 
flex and eventual cracking. If you 
can't get a replacement bracket, you 
may be able to get the old cracked 
one rewelded. But replacement is the 
best choice, and if the dealer doesn't 
A muffler is a canister 
with internal tubular pas-
sages, shaped in part by 
baffles, designed to 
gradually reduce the pul-
sations of flowing 
exhaust gas. The slow-
down creates back pres-
sure in the exhaust sys-
tem , all the way back to 
the engine itself. This 
slows down the exit of 
exhaust gas from the 
engine, reducing its per-
formance. To get around 
ha ve it, the wrecki ng ya rd may. 
Shields 
Exhaust system heat shields are prone 
to damage from driving on rough 
roads. To a void the possibility of a 
grass fi re, replace any that are missing 
o r barely hanging on. If a shield is 
dented, unbolt it, and check the 
exhaust system fo r damage. 
Exhaust Joints 
If there has been a lot of exhaust sys-
tem up-down travel because of a bro-
ken hanger, the clamps and joint may 
be damaged. If a welded joint is 
cracked at a muffler or resonator joint, 
you can replace the parts. Or to save 
money, cut away the piping and part of 
the neck joint, then install a short con-
nector pipe and secure it with clamps. 
If a clamped joint isn't cracked, 
but is leaking exhaust gas, remove the 
old clamp. If the pipe ends are badly 
distorted, you'll have to rent a pipe 
expander to reshape them. O therwise, 
separate the pipes, sand them to 
remove any rust, then apply a coat of

cial at low speed, 
because slowing down 
the flow pattern of intake 
and exhaust gases 
improves performance 
somewhat. Many engines 
have 2-stage mufflers 
with an internal spring-
loaded valve. These muf-
flers maintain a specified 
amount of back pressure 
for good low-speed per-
formance. But when the 
engine is at higher speed 
and there's more exhaust 
this problem, many high-performance engines 
increase the exhaust flow with larger mufflers and 
accept some increase in exhaust system noise as a 
result. With careful design, however, including the use 
of silencing materials, the systems can be made to 
meet legal restrictions. Some back pressure is benefi-
gas to flow through the muffler, back pressure builds 
up. Before it can become excessive, it pushes open 
the spring-loaded valve, and the gases take a far less 
restrictive flow through the muffler. This "second 
stage" permits the engine to develop considerably 
greater horsepower at higher rpm.

Damper Weights 
Some exhaust systems have vibration

that are attached to a 
pipe or are part of a 
flange connection. If a 
damper weight breaks off 
or is bent, the exhaust

The answer is that something'S 
wrong with your belt's drive. Don't just 
put on a new belt, grumble and wait 
for the next belt failure. Find out why 
your car has an appetite for drive belts. 
T hen make a more durable repair. 
First, inspect a II of the bel ts and 
each of the pulleys (Fig. 1). Twist 
over each belt and check it thor-
o ughl y. O n a simple V-belt, look at 
the sidewalls, and if they're glazed, 
that's a sign of slippage-typically 
caused by improper adjustment, but 
possibly a sign of a bad pulley, too. 
(Fig. 1) A belt that's installed improp-
erly, or one riding on improperly aligned 
pulleys, will not last long. 
On a multi ribbed belt look carefully 
for missing chunks of rubber. Specifi-
cally check for gaps at least a half-
inch or longer on adjacent ribs. 
If the bel t hasn't lasted long, the 
reason will be found during inspec-
tion of the pu lleys. There are lots of 
reasons why some cars eat belts.

These belts typica ll y are tensioned by 
an idler pulley with an automatic ten-
sioner. Just because there's an auto-
matic tensioner doesn't mean it's 
working right. Any of the root causes 
discussed below can result in a belt 
getting chewed up fast, or popping off 
the pulleys. 
There's a tension indicator on the 
idler and it should be reasonably 
close to midpoint. It shou ld not be 
resting on the stop tab at the "loose" 
end. If it is at the stop- or very 
close-the belt has stretched and 
should be replaced before it pops off. 
You just put in a new belt, you say? 
Maybe you routed the belt incor-
rectl y. Yes, it is possible to get the 
belt wrapped around all the pu lleys 
in what seems to be the right way but

diagram (Fig. 2), which on many cars 
is on an underhood label. 
ALTERNATOR

Are you sure you have the right 
belt? Just because the tension indicator 
is in the right place doesn't mean you 
have the correct belt. It's hard to eye-
ball the difference between 7-rib and 
8-rib belts, and if the pu lleys have 
more or fewer grooves, the belt won't 
sit right. Even if the number of 
grooves matches, it's possible to install 
the belt too far inboard. While you're 
looking at the tensioner, also check for 
cracks in the housing which wou ld 
allow it to flex enough for trouble. 
Noth ing obviously wrong yet? If 
the belt is still on the pulleys, run the 
engine and eyeball the accessory drive. 
If the tensioner is vibrating a lot but 
the pulleys are running smoothl y, the 
damper bL.lshing is bad and you'll 
have to install a new tensioner. 
Put a wrench on the spring ten-

Serpentine Belt 
L 
68 
The serpentine belt is so named 
because its routing resembles the 
shape of a serpent. Carmakers devel-
oped the system so one belt would 
drive several, if not all, underhood 
accessories. A single belt, no matter 
how long, saves space under the hood 
since all the pulleys and accessories 
are on the same plane and there's no 
need to stack or stagger them. The 
ribbed side of the belt fits into grooved 
pulleys (each one a "mini" V), and the 
smooth back side of the belt often 
wraps around the water pump pulley 
and one or more idler pulleys. An idler 
is used to route the belt so there's 
plenty of "wrap" around each acces-
sory pulley for good power transfer. To 
maintain adequate tension for good 
power transfer, and still eliminate the 
need for periodic adjustment, an auto-
matic tensioner is usually used. 
There's a nearly infinite variety of 
tensioner designs, but they all have a 
powerful coil spring inside. The poly-V 
belt design used on serpentine belts is 
capable of transmitting more power 
with less frictional loss than traditional 
V-belts. A properly installed and auto-
matically tensioned serpentine belt 
system could remain troublefree for 
four to five years or 100,000 miles.

If you come across a ba II

screwed into the sheetmetal (Fig. 3) . 
If so, it's very likely that a hex is 
included for removing the old ball 
w hile it's still attached to the strut and 
screwing in the new strut's ball with 
an open-end wrench. Look at the new 
strut for guidance. 
For the hard-mo unt type

bolt, screw or nut that holds 
the old strut in place, remove 
it and attach the new piece

with a peg-style mount, you 
should find an E-clip of some 
sort or a cotter pin prevent-

Also, don't inadvertently mount the

applications-those that contain some 
hydraulic oil as well as nitrogen gas-
perform more smoothly if oriented with

ASSEMBLY 
In the old days, your heavy metal hood and trunklid 
required beefy, space-robbing, spring-loaded hinges to 
stay open. Then the carmakers tried flimsy prop-rods for 
holding up the hood. But they invariably get in the way 
during service and tend to wear out and break at the 
pivot point on the radiator support. 
So, as a result, gas-charged hood and hatch support 
struts, or gas springs, have steadily infiltrated the mar-
ket. They're compact, light, durable and relatively inex-
pensive-key for auto manufacturing in the '90s. 
One of the slickest applications around is on the 
Chrysler Cirrus/Dodge Stratus trunklid. No bulky suitcase-
crushing hinges here, thanks to two stubby gas struts that 
open the lid past vertical to allow for easier trunk access. 
How do they work? Like tiny shock absorbers really. 
But instead of being filled primarily with fluid for 2-way 
damping, they're charged with nitrogen gas for 1-way 
expansion. One end is fastened to the inner fender or 
cowl, the other to the hood or hatch. When you lift the 
lid a little bit, it extends the strut's piston rod enough for 
the gas to push on the piston and keep expanding the 
strut. The lid has nowhere to go but up. 
On closing, you're actually pushing against the gas 
pressure to compress the strut back to its original size 
and position. A typical gas support strut is designed to 
last for at least 50,000 operations. They're mainte-
nance-free throughout their life cycle but must be 
replaced when worn out.

puter-controlled EGR systems, 
there may be no way to check 
the solenoid/valve mechanism

haven't heard any engine ping 
or knock lately, idle qua lity is 
okay, and if the CH ECK ENGI E 
light hasn't come on, th e EGR 
system is probably fin e. 
When the EMR indicator 
glows, it doesn't necessa ril y 
mea n trouble. But each time 
the light comes on, the emis-
sions system should be checked. 
The idea is to work on the 
engine before the engine works 
you over. After giving your 
okay, the light has to be reset 
so the system starts counting 
down for the next EMR cycle. 
(Fig. 2) Stick a pen or pencil in the back of the mileage 
counter in the cowl tray on Audis and Volkswagens to 
reset EMR system. 
Other operations you ca n 
check include the smog pump 
(or p ulse-air system ) on engines 
that use them . Examine the 
pump belt for cracks, wea r and 
proper tension. Follow the 
tubes from the pump to the

There's no resetting provision

integrity of its ru bber lines and

look at the air filter, air-box 
breather element and the 
engine's vacuum lines. Make

Pulling the Instrument Panel 
This third category can get compli-

dismantle part of the dash to remove

Chrysler's mini va ns (Fig. 4) . Accord-

behind th e tachometer on the 
opti onal cluster. Someti mes you' ll 
find a 9-volt battery in th ere, too. It 
must be replaced with an a lka line 
battery. Some Chrysler captive 
import light trucks ha ve a reset 
switch on the back of th e cluster nea r 
the speedo junction or on the lower 
righthand corner of the cluster, 
behind the face pane l. 
On ea rl y-model GM vehicles, pull 
the instrument cluster lens and use a

orange plastic flag that pops up near 
the odometer. An al ignment mark 
should appear in the left center of the 
odometer window w hen the flag is

no specific EMR indicator. The CHECK

Early-model non-turbo Audis have a 
cancel switch labeled oxs on the back 
of the instrument cluster that must be 
removed from the pod to ga in access. 
Late-model turbos hide a mileage 
counter with a reset button under the

DIFFICULT 
Passing An Emissions Inspection 
Y
our car is running beautifully, 
and all seems right with the 
world. You have no trepidation 
whatsoever when the time comes to 
take it in for your state or local emis-
sions test. After an interminable wait 
in line at the inspection station, a 
smiling, snappily dressed functionary 
shoves a probe up your tailpipe and 
asks you to gun it. Moments later, the 
inspector smiles wearil y as he hands 
you an envelope-not a new inspec-
tion sticker for your license plate, but 
an envelope that says "FAIL" in 
bright red letters. You have only a 
month to do your homework and 
pass inspection. Heck, getting into 
college wasn't this hard. 
Wasn't your car designed to meet 
these emissions standards? Haven't 
you done your best to maintain it 
with regular oil changes and tuneups? 
What's gone wrong? And, most 
important, how can you make it pass? 
Take a minute to read the rejection 
slip carefully. Typically, it will give 
you the test results for your car along 
with the acceptable limits. Note 
which of the "terrible trio"-hydro-
carbons (HC), carbon monoxide 
(CO) or oxides of nitrogen (NOx)-is

screwdriver while the engine idles. If 
the EGR valve passages aren't blocked, 
the engine should stall immediately. 
Raw Gas 
Hydrocarbon emissions are simply 
unburned fuel being pumped raw into 
the exha ust system. Misfiring is the 
most likely culprit, and that can come 
from an ignition problem, or an inter-
nal engine failure that reduces com-
pression. Another possibility is a mix-
ture that's too lean to catch fire 
dependably because of either a fuel 
system malfunction or a vacuum leak. 
If a high HC number isn't from a 
miss, it's probably due to an overly 
rich mix. 
So, worn or fouled spark plugs are 
the first things to suspect. If you can

feel a dead miss at idle, use insulated 
pliers to pull plug wires one at a time 
to see if one in particular does not 
have any effect on smoothness (don't 
do this on '96 and newer cars with 
OBD II, as it will set a misfire code 
and turn on the Malfu nction Indica-
tor Lamp on the dash) . Remove and 
inspect that spark plug. If it's okay, 
use an ohmmeter to find out if the 
plug wire is open-you should meter 
5000 to 20,000 ohms, then exa mine 
the distributor cap for heavy corro-
sion in the sockets, cracks, etc. 
With the plug out, do 
a compression test-
anything much less than

pect (a va lve may be 
burned). Also, look over

T here are a couple of other things 
that ca n supply enough extra gasoline 
to put hydrocarbons above the limit. 
O ne is the evaporative-emissions con-
trol system that traps gasoline vapors 
that wou ld otherwise escape into the 
atmosphere. It then meters the vapors 
into the intake during off-idle modes 
to be burned. If it flows at idle, the 
mix will be too rich. 
Another potentia l culprit is engine 
oil that's diluted with gasoline. Fuel 
vapors are drawn through the Positive

Killer Compound 
Ca rbon monoxide is 
prod uced by incomplete 
combustion-the 
air/hie! cha rge is ignited, 
but isn't burning prop-
erl y or entirely. In most 
cases, this is due to fuel-
system tro ubles that 
make the engine run 
rich, but intake air restrictions co uld 
affect it too. It's important to note 
that some combustion is required for 
CO to be created. So, you won't see a 
high CO reading if there's no spark. 
With a carburetor, richness might 
be due to an idle mixture screw that's 
open too much, a heavy float (the 
foam type may absorb gasoline, and 
the brass pontoon type ca n develop 
holes and fill up wi th fuel), a choke 
that stays on a fter the engine has 
warmed up, or a power va lve that 
sticks in the open position. Wi th fuel

to the computer. This, however, 
graduates into professional-level 
troubleshooting. 
On a precomputer carbureted car, 
one way to get under the H C and CO 
limits is to retard the ignition timing. 
This will slow the idle and provide a 
longer, hotter burn. Then, bring the 
idle speed back up to specs with the 
throttle stop screw or idle stop sole-
noid, which will ad mit more air. Per-
formance will be off, but you'll prob-
ably pass the test. 
Hard NOx 
NOx is a tough one. It forms when 
nitrogen (78 percent of the air we 
breathe) combines with oxygen (21 
percent of the atmosphere), which can 
happen only at very high combustion 
temperatures. The trouble is, many of 
the things that were initially done to 
cut H C and CO involved dramatically 
increasing the heat inside a car's cylin-
ders. That heat created plenty of NOx. 
Fortunately, it was found that only the 
peak temps (over 2500°F) produced 
this smog-promoting gas, not the long, 
hot burn that oxidized the other two 
pollutants. Introducing Exhaust Gas 
Recirculation (EGR) knocked the top 
off the temperature curve, thus putting 
NOx within bounds. One of the main 
reasons electronic 
engine management 
systems were devel-
oped in the late 
1970s was to allow a 3-way catalyst, 
which adds rhodium to the 2-way cat's 
platinum and palladium to further 
diminish NOx. 
The first things to suspect are an 
inoperative EGR valve (perhaps the 
vacuum line is cracked, or the internal 
diaphragm has ruptured) and carbon-
clogged EGR passages. Try applying 
vacu um to the valve at idle. If the 
engine starts to run roughly or stalls, 
the valve is okay and the passages are 
at least partially open. Remove the 
valve and dig out all the deposits you 
can. 
There's a good chance that the cat-
alytic converter is no longer capable 
of reducing NOx, but determining 
that requires high-tech diagnosis best 
left to a professional. There's another 
distinct possibility that you can deal 
with, however: heavy carbon deposits 
in the combustion chamber and on 
the backs of the intake valves. These 
can raise the compression ratio 
enough to cause the hot flash that 
forms NOx, and will also interfere 
with the carefully engineered swirl 
pattern of the incoming mixture that 
makes it burn evenly. 
N umerous treatments have been 
devised to avoid the huge job of 
removing the head and manually 
cleaning the combustion chambers, 
piston tops and valves, but the only 
one suitable for the do-it-yourselfer is 
chemical treatment. The most basic 
approach is to pour a suitable addi-
tive into the gas tank. A more thor-
ough job can be achieved by adding 
detergent- or solvent-based cleaners 
directly into the intake stream. 
Too much heat is another thing to 
think about. Is the engine running 
hot? Is the intake air overheated due 
to a jammed Ea rly Fuel Evaporation 
valve, or is a Thermostatic Air 
Cleaner door in the snorkel stuck 
closed? 
Ignition timing that's too far 
adva nced can result in detonation 
that causes NOx to rise. A switch 
to premium fue l may reduce it. A 
final note: Moisture-laden air can 
lower NOx output by as much as 30 
percent, so yo u might consider visit-
ing the emissions station on a rainy 
day. fj

a sealing washer with a rubber insert. 
Use a properly fitting box wrench or a 
6-point socket wrench to remove the 
plug. Be careful not to rock the socket 
to the side as this could damage the 
f1a ts on the bolt. 
If putting the car up on stands 
doesn't leave you enough underbody 
space to get adequate leverage, you 
can use a 4-way lug wrench provided 
it has the proper end. This will allow 
you to twist the bolt without add ing 
any side thrust, and you'll be able to

use both hands and all of 
your upper-body strength. 
Remain calm, have patience 
and you'll get it loose. 
But of course, li fe isn't 
easy. The threads in the pan 
and on the plug are damaged, 
perhaps from partial cross-
threading. What to do now? 
Forget the drain plug and get 
a repair kit. A typical kit has 
a replacement fitting that cuts 
deeper threads, and when 
tightened, it seals against a 
washer and remains in place. 
Some kits cut fresh, deeper 
threads for a new plug. A 
hexhead brass cap with an 0-
ring sea l threads onto the 
end. When it's time to change 
the oil, you unthread the cap. 
O thers (for odd-size, severely 
damaged ho les) are fat, cone-
shaped synthetic rubber plugs 
large r than the drain-plug 
hole. You fo rce a special rod 
into an opening in th e cone, 
which tempora ril y stretches it 
and reduces its diameter, 
allowing it to fit in the hole. 
Withdraw the rod, and the

you have enough room to swing the wrench. 
cone relaxes and seals the hole-the 
cone won't come out until you force 
in that rod to stretch it. 
If the drain plug looks marginal, 
consider installi ng a Fram oil-drain 
va lve kit. These are avai lable 
for the most common types of 
drain-plug holes. Thread a 
spring-loaded va lve assembl y 
with a copper washer in to the 
hole and tighten. The va Ive is 
the primary oil seal, and a 
knurled cap threads on fin-
gertight aga inst an O-ring-
this keeps out dirt. 
When it's time to dra in oil, 
unthread the cap and thread 
on a fittin g with a drain hose, 
which you can aim right into 
the pan (no splatter and no 
hot oi l running down your 
arm ). T he hose fittin g has an 
internal tip th at pushes open 
the spring-loaded va lve, and 
the oil drains out. When the 
pan is drained, unthread the hose fit-
ting (the va lve springs shut), reinsta ll 
the fin gertight cap and you' re good to 
go (after changing the fi lter and 
putting fresh oil in the engine, of 
course). If the drain plug is okay and 
you want to reuse it, replace the 
washer and then tighten the plug to 
specifications-20 ft.- lb. to perhaps 
35 ft.-lb.-depending on the size of 
the plug. 
Empty the drained o il 
into a suitable container. 
(In my area, the county 
gives away flat jugs with a 
giant built-in funnel.) 
When the jug is full, take 
the oil to the store where 
you bought the new oil to 
be emptied into an oil-recy-
cling tank. Many states 
req u i re service sta tions to 
take small quantities of old 
oil. Dumping oil in that 
low spot behind the shed or 
in to the sink is not accept-

MAINTENANCE BASICS 

This filter has a rubberized area to 
provide for tightening by hand. 
Sometimes the end of a fil-
ter has a hexnut in the center, 
so you could use a conven-
tional wrench. If you can't 
find the right size and shape 
cap wrench, try one of the 
following: 
• Nylon band wrench. 
This universal tool wraps a 
band around the filter tightl y. 
• Coil-spring wrench. It 
fits over the end of the con-
ventional spin-on filter, and 
the band coil extends to near 
the filter's base. Turn the end 
with a wrench and the coils

tighten around the entire fil-

and separation from the

Off With The Filter 
When removing an oil fi lter, what you 
need more than anything is the appro-
priate wrench. There are many sizes, 
and perhaps the most common 
answer is the cap wrench, which fits 
on the end of the filter. Only problem: 
The wrench fits against a fluted pat-
tern and there are countless fluted 
patterns. So not only do you need the 
right size, but the right internal shape 
to fit the flutes. The one tha t fits the 
filter on your car now, we should 
warn you, may not fit the replacement 
filter you buy. 
• Spring-band wrench. This 
wrench fits over the end of the filter 
and extends just past the fI utes, so it 
gri ps the full circle of the filter bod y. 
• A "spider" has three fluted legs 
that clamp against the spin-on car-
tridge and "dig in," preventing slip-
page. It has an end plate for a ratchet, 
and because the spider legs extend 2 ~ 
in., they grip well past the outer end 
of the filter. This design provides well-
distributed gripping power. 
It is possible to loosen a badly 
stuck filter with a good filter wrench. 
WHAT'S THAT STARBURST? 
You should see two labels on a container of oil. One is a 
"starburst" with the words American Petroleum Institute 
Certified printed on it. This means that the oil has 
passed tests for the recommended service in which 
it's to be used-that includes a test by ISLAC (Inter-
national Lubricant Standardization and Approval 
Committee). Passing the ISLAC oil test enables car-
makers to add to their fuel economy numbers. Oils 
such as OW (a synthetic grade) and 5W (thin) pass this 
test, and so do some lOW-30 oils. Heavier oils, including 
those formulated for older cars, do not. 
On the second label you'll see the words "Energy Conserving." Real 
world: Oils labeled this way won't make a noticeable difference in your 
car's gas mileage. This label also lists the service category. On late models 
you want an oil deSignated For Service SL. You may also see some Sl/SJ-
rated oil on shelves. Read your owner's manual. 
CHANGING YOUR OIL AND FILTER 
How about dri ving a big screwdriver 
through the spin-on cartridge and 
using that to loosen a stuck filter? 
You're more likely to destroy the car-
tridge and still not loosen the filter. 
Have the drain pan in place, sitting 
on a spread of newspapers or an oi l-
absorbent pad- just in case. Once the 
filter is loosened, oil may start flowin g 
to the ground. 
Unthread the filter and carefully 
empty it into the drain pan. 
Refilling 
Apply a film of clean engine oil to the 
gasket of the new filter, then thread 
the filter on by hand. Some filters 
have a rubberized surface to make it 
easy to turn. Every reputable oil filter 
is designed to seal for tens of thou-
sands of miles with no more than a 
good hand-tightening. You don't need 
a wrench unless you have one of those 
deeply recessed filters with no space 
around it for your hands. (If that's the 
case, the only choice is a cap wrench.) 
Turn the filter until you feel the filter 
base just make contact with its 
mounting plate. Then use the wrench 
to tighten a half-turn more. 
If you haven 't bought engine o il 
in a whi le, you may be confused by 
the choices. For a little fri endl y 
advice, see "What's That Starburst? "

quently asked questions (FAQ ) fi rst. 
High-speed Internet service may be 
just " recommended," but without it 
you're in for real frustration, both for 
downloading special software and 
using certain features. Some down-
loads are over 15MB, and your actual 
transfe r speed may be far less than the 
connection rate-
meaning litera lly 
hours of downloading. Th roughput 
rates might be better in the wee hours 
when there's less traffic on the Inter-
net. After your days-long subscription 
to the Web site expires, you'll still 
wa nt access to the data you've paid 
for. So print out the service data as 
you download it, or at least keep it on 
your hard dri ve and backed up to 
some other place. 
Advice For The Slow Lane 
If you must use a dial-up modem, 
understand that only straightforward 
wi ring diagrams (not interactive types) 
and non-PDF repair instructions will 
open within tolerable times. Also, you 
should ask someone with a broadband 
connection to download needed soft-
ware and store it on a CD. Installing 
from a CD saves lots of time. 
An alternative that works reason-
ably well with dial-up is 
Alldatadiy.com, the Saturday 
mechan ic's site from the supplier of 
professional service info rmati on. For 
$25 (one car, $15 each additional), 
you get a one-year subscription to all 
the information Alldata provides to 
independent garages as far back as 
1982, including continuous updating 
of Technical Service Bulleti n (TSB) 
listings. It's easy to navigate, although 
service manual info rmati on lags 
model introducti ons by one to two 
years. Info rmation is edited and refor-
matted from factory manuals, 
although some specialty information 
is excluded, such as automatic trans-
mission overhaul. All leading makes 
are covered except H onda and BMW 
(which are only in Alldata's profes-
sional system ). TSB postings run onl y

"Me? Reprogram my car's com-

idea is the same. And there are safe-
guards to keep you from leaving your

that checks your car's powertrain 
computer. For other on-board com-
puters, you have to check ca libration 
charts on the Web site to determine 
what is available. Because of the 
delays in finishing SAE standard 
j2534, low-cost, mass-production 
pass-throughs are not yet ava ilable. 
When GM and the leading japanese

or the motor-home engine for power, 
but you hate to disturb the untram-
meled wilderness by doing that. And 
besides, the campground has ru les 
aga inst generators after sunset. 
Too Close To Home? 
The problem you have is common to 
many RVs, and there are many possi-
ble reasons for yo ur predicament. The 
RV's deep-cycle house battery was left 
uncharged over the winter, ftoze and 
is now useless except as an anchor for 
your boat. Or, you simply forgot to 
turn on the battery switch. Or, the 
alternator on the RV was maxed out 
by running the alc fan, GameBoy and 
stereo and trying to recharge the bat-
tery all at the same time. 
How Batteries Charge 
A conventional lead-acid car battery 
is filled with interleaved plates of 
spongy lead and lead dioxide soaking 
in sulfuric acid and water electtol yte. 
The sulfu ric acid is diluted to a spe-
cific gravity of about 1.26 to 1.30, 
depend ing on the type of battery. 
Charging the battery combines some 
of the sulfuric acid and lead, reducing 
the concentration of sulfuric acid 
Motorhomes, tractors, boats, 
motorcycles and other occasional-
use vehicles should use a battery-
maintainer style of charger to 
prevent battery damage. 
The permanent extra 
wiring harness makes it 
easy to hook up the 
charger when 
necessary.

With hard-to-access batteries, look for 
a remote jumper cable post. 
down to about 1.12 and coating the 
plates with a layer of spongy lead sul-
fate. Reversing this process gives you 
back most of that electricity. This 
means that checking the specific grav-
ity of the electrolyte is a very good 
way of finding out the actual state of 
charge of a battery. 
It's also fussy and potentially dan-
gerous if the battery electrolyte ends 
up someplace it's not supposed to be, 
like in your eye or on the leather 
upholstery of your wife's vehicle. 
Also, some maintenance-free batteries 
have no filler caps and there's no way 
to check or add electrolyte. 
So, we're left to estimate the bat-
tery's state of charge by reading its 
voltage. A fully charged 12-volt bat-
tery should have an open-circuit volt-
age of 12.6 volts. A discharged bat-
tery will have a voltage of about 11.2 
volts-but these numbers need to be 
checked with no load and with sev-
eral hours of rest after charging. And 
this is at a normal battery tempera-
ture of 80°F-colder batteries

in the electrolyte develops a gradient, 
becoming more concentrated next to 
one plate and less concentrated at the 
other. Only time will even this out, 
and that's why you can't quick-charge 
a battery to any more than about 50 
percent of its capacity. 
To charge a battery, a charger or 
your car's alternator needs to raise the 
voltage across the battery posts. Nor-
mal charging voltage needs to remain 
below about 14.4 volts, which is the 
level at which gassing of hydrogen and 
oxygen starts. Your car alternator was 
never intended to charge a totall y dis-
charged battery. Here's what hap-
pened on that fa teful trip to the moun-

A battery left discharged fo r

some of its soft lead sulfa te

permanent deposits. These 
deposits interfere with normal 
battery operation, and can 
damage the plates.

charge. Once that battery 
started to accept a charge (but 
in this case it did not), it would

alternator's life. 
This type of situation ca lls 
for an external battery charger. 
The traditional charger is a sim-
ple transformer and diode affair 
that charges a battery to a con-

MAINTENANCE BASICS 

HOW IT WORKS 
There Are Batteries, 
And Then There Are Batteries. 
We commonly think of car batteries as lead-acid 
flooded wet-cell batteries that haven't changed sub-
stantially since the earliest electric cars used them 
(the early batteries' cases were made of glass, not 
plastic). The lead in these is alloyed with antimony to 
make it hard enough to withstand the vibration it 
receives in a moving vehicle. In the last few genera-
tions, maintenance-free batteries have become the 
standard. These use an alloy of lead and calcium. In 
contrast, the antimony used in older batteries pro-
motes the electrolysis of water, lowering the electrolyte 
level and requiring replenishment. Maintenance-free 
batteries generally have a higher level of electrolyte 
covering the plates, and they commonly lack filler caps. 
A smart charger will rapidly recharge a 
dead battery without boiling off electrolyte. 
make the electrolyte disappear as 
gases- an especially bad idea for a 
maintenance-free battery that can't be 
replenished. Even a small trickle 
charger will damage a battery over a 
few months if left on. 
The more modern battery chargers 
are smart. They will raise the current 
flow high enough to bulk charge the 
battery rapidly, then taper off until 
the battery is full y charged . This 
reduction is necessary to keep below 
the 14.4-volt gassing point. The 
chargers then throttle back to a some-
what lower voltage that won't boil 
the electrolyte, and periodically check 
Totally discharging one of these types of batteries even 
once can permanently compromise its ability to take a 
full charge. Deep-cycle batteries use a purer lead in 
thicker plates, and are capable of many cycles of near-
total discharge. They need periodic replenishment of 
the water in their electrolyte. 
The newest lead-acid battery technology uses a gel 
electrolyte that won't run out if the battery or vehicle is 
upended. Another type becoming popular is the 
absorbed glass mat (AGM) cell. The electrolyte in this 
battery is held in a spongy mat and can't move around. 
AGM and gel-cell batteries internally recombine the 
hydrogen and oxygen from electrolysis so you never 
have to add water to them.

Today's Tuneup 
T
here's the thruway exit, but 
you're stuck in the left lane. 
Hey- a break in the traffic. You 
flip up the turn signal, floor the gas 
pedal and try to edge into the right 
lane. Whoops! Your V8 is embar-
rassed by a 4-cylinder econobox with 
the same objective. It was behind you, 
but it apparently has better accelera-
tion. You hit the brakes, crank the 
wheel to get back into the left lane, 
cruise to the next exit miles and miles 
ahead, and make the time-wasting 
U-turn. The Wife suggests a tuneup. 
But we don't tune up today's engines, 
right? They're computerized and 
there's nothing to adjust. 
Wrong. It's true we stopped replac-
RETAINING CLIP 
ing ignition points over 20 years ago. 
If it's really a late-model vehicle, it 
may not even have a replacea ble fuel 
filter under the hood. The battery is a 
fill-free design. And there's no ignition 
timing to adjust. However, while it has 
changed significantly- even in the last 
seven or eight years-the concept of a 
tuneup itself is anything but gone. 
Emissions regulations may have 
tightened, but ambient air is still 
dirty. So the air filter still plugs up, 
and the engine gasps for breath until 
a clean new filter is installed (Fig. 1). 
Gasoline is unleaded, so spark plugs 
don't lead-foul anymore, and the new 
precious-metal designs last much 
longer. But they aren't guaranteed to

it seals properly, and replace the cover. 
last a lifetime, and engine perfor-
mance often can improve when plugs 
are replaced well before the owner's 
manual dictates. 
Underhood Checks 
A good way to start today's tuneup is 
to look for trouble codes, using a scan 
tool. The only codes that turn on a 
Check Engine light are those that 
directly impact emissions, provided 
the computer can detect them, to keep 
people from getting nervous. Most 
ENGINE 

codes show up only with a scan tool. 
O n the other hand, " no code" drive-
ability problems are also extremely 
common. 
If yo u find a trouble code, you 
should trace the circuit to pinpoint 
the problem. Sure, it cou ld be just a 
bad sensor, but it may be a bad wiring 
connecti on, chafed wire or damaged 
hose. You'll need the facto ry service 
information to be able to do this. 
No trouble code? Inspect under the 
hood. look for damaged vacuum 
hoses that should be replaced, loose 
connections at any of the sensors and 
solenoids, tears in the air clea ner 
ductwork, a disconnected duct or 
poor spark plug wiring conn ections.

controls and their sensors. There sti ll 
are tim ing marks on man y late mod-
els and if your vehicle is one of them, 
you ca n check basic timing (a t idle) 
with a timing light. No marks? You 
still can check ignition timi ng on the 
scan tool by reading the ignition 
advance data item. look for a steady 
increase in ignition timing as the 
throttle is gradually opened from idle 
to a midthrottle position. 
Even if the timing is all right, check 
the throttle position sensor and intake 
airflow (mass airflow) sensor read-
ings, w hich also should show grad ual 
increases as the accelerator peda I is 
depressed. At the same time, tap on 
the mass airflow sensor with a screw-
driver handle and if the engine hic-
cups or the scan tool reading spikes, 
the senso~ ' is defective. 
A coolant temperature sen-
sor should show a continuous 
increase in the reading until the 
engine is fully warm (195' F to 
230' F). A MAP (manifold 
absolute pressure) engine vac-
UU111 sensor should show 
changes when a pinched-closed 
hose supplying vacuum to it is 
released (Fig. 2) . The engi ne 
should read about 750 to 850 
rpm at idle with the engine

warmed, and increase grad uall y as the 
gas pedal is depressed. 
Still no reason for a driveabil ity 
glitch? You need to access the power-
train computer. It may be located 
under the hood or under the dash. T he 
most common under-dash loca ti on is 
behind the passenger-side kickpad. 
Remove the kickpad and, while a 
helper is slowly accelerating the 
engine, flex the computer wiring con-
nectors and tap on the computer hous-
ing (Fig. 3). If the engi ne hiccups, 
there's a bad connection or possibly 
cracked solder joints on the circuit 
board. You may need a replacement. 
Replacing Spark Plugs 
Time was, spark plugs were always 
visible, even if it took a struggle to 
reach them. Now they're often 
recessed into the head, and in many 
cases there are no plug wires. A mini 
ignition modu le, perhaps wi th the coil 
bui lt into it (or into the plug boot), is 
used instead. You may have to 
remove a cover that holds the ignition 
modules and plug boots fo r access. 
Whatever the design, very carefu ll y 
make any necessary electrical discon-
nection at the plug prior to plug 
remova l. If there are plug wires, grasp 
and lift by the plug boots. Never pull 
on a plug wire or it may separate 
internally. Look inside the boot and if 
it appears soaked in oil or cracked by 
heat, replace it. If the ignition coil is 
built in, expect it to be pricey. 
Inspect the plugs. If they all have a 
coating of black carbon, that indi-
cates a rich fuel mi xture and 
likely a bad oxygen sensor. A 
scan tool should be able to 
pinpoint a ma lfuncti oning 
oxygen sensor even if it did-
n't log a trouble code. If 
there's just a single carbon-
blackened plug, you probably 
have a leak ing fu el injector. 
When you're ready to 
insta ll the new plug, apply 
a thin film of antiseize com-
pound so the new plug 
doesn't heat-seal in place. 
Use a torgue wrench to 
tighten the plug.

(Fig. 4.) You may not be able to 
clean the pintle on a recessed 
EGR valve like this one. 
Exhaust Gas 
Recirculation 
Exhaust gas recirculati on 
(EGR ) valves may stick open, 
fa i I to close com pletel y or just 
not operate smoothly. If so, 
the engine will hesitate and 
may stall, fuel economy may 
drop, and emissions may be 
affected-even if you pass the 
state inspection test. The 
EGR valve meters some 
exhaust gas back into the cylinders to 
lower peak temperatures of the air-
fuel charge during combusti on. This 
not onl y reduces a key pollutant 
(oxides of nitrogen) but often 
improves fuel economy. The EGR 
valve, typically a diaphragm-actuated 
device with a pin-type valve, is pulled 
open by engine vacuum, but th at vac-
uum must be precisely regulated. Too 
much vacuum results in too much 
ex haust gas fl ow, which can ca use the 
engine to lose power, even stall. 
Late models with OBD II comput-
ers have sophisticated strategies to 
detect severely malfunctioning EGR. 
H owever, this basic check will work on 
all vacuum-controlled EGR systems. 
Locate the EGR va lve and if it has a 
vacuum hose connection, unplug it. 
Run the engine at idle, and connect a 
spare hose from a source of engine vac-
uum or use a manual vacuum pump 
and apply vacuum to the hose neck. 
The engine should slow significantly, 
probably even stall, if you apply full 
engine vacuum (17 to 21 in.). 
If there's no significant change in 
engine idle-in fact, if the engine has 
been idling rough-the valve may be 
sticking open. Remove it and if you can 
see a heavy accumulation of deposits in 
the port, and if it's an exposed pin-type 
valve, clean it with a wire brush (Fig. 4). 
If the end of the pi n is recessed in the 
port, it can't be cleaned. Replace it. 
Battery Terminals 
Clean the battery terminals, then rein-
stall and tighten. Today's batteries-
top-post and side-terminal-are subject 
to continuous drain with the engine off, 
to keep alive the memories of many 
computers (from powertrain to car 
radio). Just a slight coat of corrosion-
perhaps too subtle to be visible-can 
reduce battery charge. Disconnect the 
cable terminals. On a top-post battery, 
brush around the post and inside the 
cable terminal (Fig. 5). If the post or 
cable terminal is badly corroded, 
replace it with a premium terminal, the 
kind that often includes a cable section. 
Forget the cheap screw-together termi-
nals-they'll become severely corroded 
and cause more problems than they 
solve. With a side-terminal battery, 
brush bOth contact faces even 
if they look clean. Make sure 
the bolt threads in without a 
feeling of looseness, and if 
there is any, don't try to muscle 
the bolt supertight with a 
wrench. You're more likely to 
make things worse. 
Where To Get 
Service Information 
Diagnosing failures that 
produce trouble codes, and 
finding out normal readings 
for engine sensors, is not sub-
ject to rule of thumb pro-
cedu res. You need the latest factory 
di agnostic sequences and specifica-
tions. Vehicle makers have Web sites 
with this service info rmation, and 
you' ll be able to access the data for a 
day at a time. Many sites charge for 
this information-you can pay using 
a credit card. At present, General 
Motors info rmation is available at 
www.acdelco.com (click on ACDelco 
TechConnect). O r you can get a 
low-cost subscription from www.a ll-

Smoothing Out a Lumpy Idle 
F
earful pedestrians glare at you 
as they pass in front of yo ur 
bumper at crosswa lks. O ut of 
embarrassment, you try to ignore 
them by glancing around noncha-
lantly, stroking your hair as you look 
in the rearview mirror or tuning the 
radio. Meanwhile, the size of your 
right thigh is growing to Dan Jansen 
proportions from the force being 
applied to the brake pedal. Your 
engine's idle speed is surging up and 
down, creating crescendos that 
would make Pavarotti proud : 
WAAAAaaaah, WAAAAaaaah, 
WAAAAaaaah! It's all you can do to 
keep your maniacal car from lurching 
forwa rd into a lawsuit. 
There are a number of generic 
steps you can take to see what's ailing 
your wheels. And if there ever was a 
time to step back and remember the 
basics, this is it. 
Pop quiz: What is an internal-com-
bustion engine? 
It's basica lly little more than an air 
pump. The more air that gets in, the 
faster the engine runs. And airflow 
controls idle. By allowing a certain 
volume of air to bypass the closed 
throttle plate(s), idle rpm can be 
maintained at a healthy level. Even to 
accelerate, we don't "step on the 
SMOOTHING OUT A LUMPY IDLE 
gas," we "step on the air" by opening 
the throttle plate farth er. Fuel is added 
a nanosecond later, in response to the 
greater intake airflow. 
Check Your Intake Tract 
If your engine uses a remotely mounted 
air filter in an air box, inspect every-
thing from there back to the throttle 
plate(s). At the air box, check all hose 
connections and make sure the clamps 
are tight (Fig. 1). Replace the air filter 
if it's so dirty that light from a lOO-watt 
bulb doesn't pass through the element. 
Make sure the new one seats properly 
in the air box and that the cover sits 
flush and clamps down evenly. Follow 
the intake tract toward the throttle 
plate, tightening all the clamps as you 
go. If there's an inline mass airflow 
meter in the tract, take extra care to 
examine its connections for leaks. 
Big, convoluted rubber tubing-style 
intake tracts are susceptible to devel-
oping cracks between the convolutes 
on the underside of the tube. They're 
generally not visible unless you remove 
one end of the tube and bend it back to 
get a good look below (Fig. 2) . If the 
engine controls measure airflow by 
means of a manifold absolute pres-
sure (MAP) sensor, this type of leak 
shouldn't affect idle quality. But the 
(Fig. 1, left) Make sure all the clamps 
sealing the intake duct are tight. 
(Fig. 2, right) Pull back the intake duct 
to check for hidden cracks underneath. 
hole still needs to be sealed, or else 
dirt and debris will find its way in. If 
the engine uses an airflow sensor, this 
type of leak tends to audibly revea l 
itself when the engine torq ues for-
wa rd on its mounts and opens wide 
the convolute crack . 
Then the engine gets an unmetered 
gulp of air and revs up on its own. 
The idle speed control may try to 
catch the speed burst by closing down 
the bypass channel. Then, when the 
engine returns to its normal position 
and the convolute crack closes, the 
idle speed is too low. In response, the 
idle controls may open up the channel 
aga in to raise the idle. This scenario 
can turn into a cycling condition that 
produces a lumpy, rolling idle. 
If you don't mind getting your 
engine bay a little messy, another 
quick way to go about checking fo r 
intake tract and runner leaks is to 
simply spray carburetor cleaner 
around connections and the intake 
manifold while the engine is running 
(Fig. 3) . If you get an rpm change 
when you spray, it means the vapors

are getting in somehow. So you have 
to play spy to find the lea k. Don't 
spray nea r the distributo r-if you 
have one-beca use there's a chance 
the solvent wi ll ignite and leave you 
minus your eyebrows and nose hair. 
Keep Your Bore Clean 
When you get to the last clamp at the 
throttle bore, unscrew it and remove the 
intake tract. Take a look inside the bore 
with a flashlight. If the muck is so thick 
that it's a wonder the throttle plate can 
move at all, you've found a major cause 
of your lumpy idle. In addition to the 
idle air-bypass channel, a small amount 
of air must be able to pass around the 
throttle plate itself. When blowby 
vapors fwm the pev system (and EGR 
exhaust gases) sludge up the bore over 
time, the idle air-bypass function is seri-
ouslyaffected. 
Steal an old toothbrush from your 
kids (so yo ur wife doesn't blow a gas-
ket) and pick up some nonca ustic 
fu el-i nj ection intake clea ner at an 
auto parts store. With the engine off, 
spray some cleaner in the bore and 
start scrubbing with the toothbrush. 
Pay pa rticular attenti on to the cir-
cumferent ial area where the throttle 
plate sits w hen closed. Also clean 
both sides of the plate and its edges. 
If the externally mounted idle air-
bypass va lve is easil y removed and its 
channel easil y accessed, try to get 
clea ner to pass through the channel 
into the bore. Be sure to clea n the 
va lve's pintle tip, too (Fig. 4) . (Also 
see page 122.) 
Wash Down the Residue 
With the bore and channel clean, stick 
the intake tract back on and start the 
engine. If the engine doesn't use an air-
flow meter, you ca n pull the tract off 
with the engine run ning and spray 
some more cleaner in the bore to wash 
down the residue. Goose the throttle a 
couple of times. Then tighten the 
clamp and let the motor idle so that 
the engine-ma nagement system ca n 
relea rn the parameters necessary for 
increased throttle plate air bypass. 
HOW IT WORKS 
(Fig. 3) Spray carb cleaner around the 
throttle bore to find air leaks. 
If your engine does use an airflow 
meter, it' ll probably stall when you 
pu ll the intake tract off the bore. Get it 
started aga in and just pull the end of 
the rubber tract back a bit with one or 
two fingers to spray some more cleaner 
down in the bore. The engine wi ll 
stumble for a second, but that's okay. 
Whatever you do, don't spray the 
cleaner into the tract before the airflow 
meter. You could damage the meter.

Engine Management 
An automotive computerized engine-
management system works like any 
computer as it controls idle speed. The 
central processing unit relies on vari-
ous inputs to calculate necessary out-
puts. On modern motors, however, the 
inputs to the processor, or powertrain 
control module (PCM), are called sen-
sors. The outputs are called actuators. 
And the PCM is programmed to control 
the actuators under any condition that 
the sensors deem necessary. 
Key sensory inputs of most engine-
management systems include engine 
speed, coolant temperature, crank-
shaft position, intake airflow, manifold 
vacuum, throttle position and exhaust oxygen content. 
Many systems go further, factoring in such inputs as 
camshaft position, barometric pressure, intake air tem-
perature, detonation detection, EGR valve position, 
misfire detection, engine-oil temperature, power-steer-
ing pressure, air-conditioning pressures, gear-lever 
position, vehicle speed, automatic-transmission-fluid

Key actuators on many systems include the fuel injec-

to stop the engine from turning. H ere's

If a signal gets lost

An engine with high mileage that's

Replacing Your Water Pump

ombing down the interstate, 
you glance at the odometer and 
realize you've just reached an 
automotive milestone: 100,000 miles 
with no major repairs. Time was a car 
that had passed its bell y over that

much used up, but yours still runs

been better-now you're walking. 
Seal Deal 
The biggest change in water pump 
design occurred decades ago when the 
spring-loaded mechanica l seal was 
adopted. Howevel; its rubber parts 
may disintegrate if the engine over-
heats, and its polished sealing faces can 
L
ear and warp if the engine is run dry.

.. -,,-
........... A~ 
(Fig. 1) Wet liquid seeping from the 
weep hole signifies the end of the ser-
vice life of the seals in your pump. 
Typica lly, pumps wi ll start leaking cat-
astrophica ll y shortly after a boi l-over. 
This kind of failure can be worse 
than it sounds. Besides the vastl y 
expensive internal engine damage 
that runni'ng without coolant may 
cause, a leaking seal can wash away 
the shaft bearing's lubricant, perhaps 
resulting in a seized shaft, and a fl y-
ing fa n or belt pu lley can destroy the 
radiator or even dent the hood. 
So, leakage is the 
o. 1 fa ilure. 
oise is second, and is always indica-
ti ve of a terminal condition. While 
service literature on water pumps 
often will show a picture of a badly 
eroded impeller that contributes to 
overheating, technicians say that's not 
as common as it once was. Another 
possible problem with the same con-
sequences is an impeller that's come 
loose from its shaft. Erosion of the 
inside surfaces of the pump chamber 
caused by cavitation (a weak cap or a 
chronica ll y low level, perhaps?) can 
open up the working space and 
reduce flow, as can corrosion from 
weak antifreeze in the coolant mix . 
Evidence Gathering 
If you start to smell the distinctive 
odor of engine coolant, or you notice 
that the level in the overflow bottle is 
dropping rapidly, it's time for a care-
ful exam. (If you're lucky, it may be 
just a leaky hose connection, but look 
the radiator over, too. If the smell is 
strong in the passenger compartment 
and the windshield tends to steam up, 
thin k about the heater core. In cases 
where none of the above is the culprit, 
better check o ut the water pump. ) 
First, use an inspection mirror and 
a good light to view the vent hole 
that's at the bottom of the pump cast-
ing's nose (Fig. 1) . Or, support the 
front of the car safely on jackstands 
and look up from underneath. All 
seals are supposed to weep slightl y (a 
little coolant is needed to lube the 
faces), but dri ps mean you'd better go 
shopping for an estimate. 
Next, grasp the fan or water pump 
pulley and see if it rocks from side to 
side. If there's anything but slight 
movement, the bearing is on its way 
out. Also, you can remove the belt 
and see how the bearing feels as you 
rotate the pump shaft (Fig. 2) . 
Roughness isn't acceptable. 
A low-flow situation that results in 
hot running can be hard to diagnose. 
Drain the level down to the top of the 
radiator tubes, get the engine hot, and 
then shut it off for 10 minutes and let 
it heat soak to make sure the thermo-
stat is wide open. Now, fire it up again 
and run it at 3000 rpm. On Japanese 
cars using the radiator fill neck on the 
top tank, look down into it with a 
flashlight and you should see strong 
circulation (Fig. 3). Another possibil-
ity is to squeeze the upper hose to feel

T he first steps in removing any 
water pump are to let the engine cool 
HOW IT WORKS 
Water Pump Shaft Seals 
Two perfectly flat rings, one stationary and the other 
rotating with the pump shaft, are pressed together by 
means of a coil spring. The rings may be made of carbon 
or may be ceramic, phenolic, porous bronze, cast iron, 
etc., in any combination. This allows only enough seep-
age to keep the elements lubricated. It has a weak link, 
however, in the form of its rubber parts-the bellows that 
seals the spring and the rubber seat cup between the 
rotating element and the shaft. If the engine is ever run 
dry, the temperature of the pump is apt to rise far 
beyond what the rubber can survive, and a leak occurs. 
Another possibility is warpage of the sealing elements, 
also from overheating. 
There's conflicting evidence on whether silicates and 
phosphates from antifreeze, or other hard particles such 
as casting core sand, can actually damage the seal faces. 
Engineers have told us the' running clearance is way too 
small to admit solids of any appreciable diameter. 
Since cars are lasting longer than they used to, and 
since we've become such a litigious society, carmakers 
are working harder than ever to make water pumps last. 
After all, when a pump goes you've got to get out and 
walk, which exposes you to dangers that horrify auto 
company lawyers. 
REPLACING YOUR WATER PUMP 
So, there has been a push for water pump seals that 
will rarely, if ever, fail. One design that looks promising is 
from Michael Ostrowski and John Crane International, 
the leading supplier of conventional water pump seals. 
Called the Advanced Metal Diaphragm seal, it uses a 
flexible stainless steel diaphragm that acts as both the 
spring and the bellows, and incorporates an improved 
method of mounting the seal faces.

(Fig. 4) This is an easy one, because 
it's near the top. Your job would be a 
lot tougher if the pump were near the 
bottom. 
dri vers, remove the air shrouds (in 
some cases, the radi ator, too), and 
then the fan and its clutch, which bolt 
to the front of the water pump shaft. 
Novv you can start on the pump by 
disconnecting the hoses. Those for the 
heater will probabl y be stubborn, so 
you ma y need to split thei r ends with 
a utility knife (if they're long enough, 
you might be ab le to trim them off 
square and reuse them). 
Extract the pump-to-engine bolts 
and keep them and any brackets they 
retain in strict order or you'll regret it 
at assembly. There may be hidden 
bolts, so take a look at a diagra m. 
The pump sho uld come off with a 
good tug (Fig. 4) . If not, make sure 
you didn't miss any bolts, and then 
tap on the inlet or outlet neck with a 
mallet or a block of wood and a ham-

tion. Make sure you get exactly

Curing a Clicking Starter 
Y
OU twist tbe ignition key to 
start yo ur engine, and instead

clicks. The engine that started every

That clicking noise is from either

solenoid is part of the starter. Typi-
ca ll y it has a terminal for a thick 
power feed w ire from the barrery

the battery). Recharge it for the day. 
Batteries do run down as a result of a

HOW IT WORKS 
Starter Solenoids 
A solenoid is an electromagnetic device that is capable 
of doing work, and in some starters, it does two jobs. 
1) It moves a plunger that makes electrical contact 
between terminals for the battery and the starter motor, 
so the motor turns. If that's all it does, it's really just a 
switching device. 2) In some starters, the movement of 
the plunger also pushes a linkage that moves the 
starter's drive gear into mesh with the flywheel ring gear. 
The solenoid has two wire coils. One is large, draws

tions at both ends. If you see 
corrosion or a possibly poor 
connection, make a voltage 
drop test (Fig. 2) . First, connect 
the voltmeter negative lead to 
the battery ground terminal and 
the positive lead to the engine 
block, close to the starter. With 
the key held in the start posi-
tion, the voltmeter should read 
under 0.5 volt. If it's 0.5 volt or 
higher, the drop is excessive. In 
fact, if it's above 0.2 volt, tbat's 
really too high and could be a 
contributor to the problem if 
the battery is marginal. Perform 
the same check with the power 
feed side of the circuit (in this 
case, connect the voltmeter's 
positive lead to the battery, and 
the negative lead to the starter's 
battery ca ble terminal) . 
Get a high reading? Repeat 
the test, taking care to make contact at 
the battery post or side-terminal bolt, 
not the cable end. If the voltage drop 
now is within reason, the cable termi-
nals are the problem. A simple cleaning 
may be all that's needed, but if a cable's

a lot of current and produces a strong magnetic field. 
That's enough to move the plunger. Once the plunger is in 
pOSition (having completed the circuit and moved the 
starter drive), the large coil is disconnected and the cir-
cuit for a small coil is completed. The small coil draws a 
small amount of current and produces a weaker mag-
netic field-just enough to hold the coil in position. This 
saves battery energy for the big job of cranking the 
engine. If there isn't quite enough battery electrical pres-
sure (voltage) to provide the current flow, however, the 
plunger won't lock into position so the small coil can take

O n Chrysler vehicles, find the power 
feed (it's the wire terminal that turns 
on a grounded 12-volt test light). 
Connect a jumper wire fro m that ter-

wire (usua lly red ) that goes to the

clamp that yo u ca n't tighten, so it also 
never ca n be retightened. I t's the 
spring-band (Fig. 1), an inexpensive 
form of constant-tension clamp. It 
may not be everywhere under the 
hood, but it usuall y is in a lot of 
places. Because it ca n't be pretight-
ened to any spec, it's sized so even if 
the hose takes a set underneath, it 
maintains some tension, hopefull y 
adequate to prevent a leak, but onl y if 
the hose neck is in perfect shape. 
Shrink-Band Clamp 
Would you like a low-cost non-
adjustable clamp th at not only main-
tains tension but sea ls well even if the 
hose neck is far from perfect? It's 
here, and it also can help with other 
problem clamping situati ons: the plas-
tic shrink-band clamp. 
You must bu y a shrin k band that's 
sized for yo ur particular hose diame-
ter. The band comes on a thick card-
board roll so it doesn't shrink in stor-
age. Just crush the roll, remove the 
band, lube the hose neck with 
antifreeze, slip the band onto the hose 
and the hose onto the neck. Un li ke a 
conventional clamp, the shrink band 
should be positioned so it extends 
onto a bead on a hose neck. 
Apply heat with a hair dryer (Fig. 
2) or heat gu n (from within a couple 
of inches or so), and in a couple of 
minutes the band conforms com-
pletely to the neck and bead, increas-
ing leak resistance. And th e hea t from 
the coolant will ca use it to continue to 
shrink in service to compensate for 
any compression set in the hose. 
H ow do you get it off? If you're 
replacing the hose, just cut it with a

HOW IT WORKS 
How Coolant Hose 
Leaks Occur 
Why does a coolant hose connec-
tion leak after you've tightened a 
conventional clamp? After all, the 
clamp itself doesn't loosen. What 
happens is this: Both the hose 
neck and the hose expand when 
the coolant warms up. The clamp, 
however, is relatively unchanged, 
so it squeezes the rubber under-
I 
I :-
neath even more, and this causes the rubber to become permanently com-
pressed, which is called a set. When the engine cools, the neck contracts 
more than the hose. Many hose materials become virtually glued to the 
neck, so a seal is maintained. Others do not. In fact, silicone is almost 
immune to heat-sealing. That makes the silicone hose easy to replace, but 
it is the most prone to cold coolant leakage. Always install the clamp next

but is easier to use. 
Those Quick-

have these choices: 1) C ut the band

[n many cases, today's cars and trucks I 
use qu ick-connects instead of clamps 
for many heater circu it hoses and also J' 
fo r some radiator hoses. The qu ick-
connect is a fitting with an O -ring 
103 

seal, and if it ever lea ks, you have 
something else- one or two 0-
rings-to check and replace. 
Every quick-connect comes off a 
bit differentl y, but it's usuall y obvi-
ous. On GM pickups you unthread a 
retainer, then turn a metal tab that 
provides a secondary hold and pull 
the hose. T he hose end is a plastic fit-
ting with O-ring seals. Just peel them 
off and install new ones. Clean out 
any debris from inside the fema le 
metal fittin g on the engine. 
So if the leak is from the quick-
connect, get a replacement from the 
car dealer, th en just pry open and 
remove the old quick-connect's per-
manent clamp and insta ll the new 
quick-connect on the hose.

nect, you may be able to cut through 
a metal secti on in a long underbody 
coolant line, install a short hose sec-
ti on (secure it with some form of con-
stant-tension clamps), and that should 
give you the extra hose length at the 
end that has the leaking quick-con-
nect. Then you should be able to 
remove the qu ick-connect and make a 
hose-to-metal fitting clamp joint. 
The Hoses 
Ma ny of today's hoses, particularly 
for the heater circuit, have crimped-
on sections, and crimps are known to 
leak. A brand-new hose is a simple 
but expensive solution. An alternative 
is to grind o r saw into the crimp, just 
enough to be able to break it apart. 
Even without crimp sections, the 
coolant hoses themselves are anything 
but simple, flexible lines of rubber. 
On ca rs with pressurized coolant 
reservoirs (where the cap is on the 
reservoir, not the radiator or engi ne), 
the upper radiator hose typically has 
a tee fitting with a secondary hose to 
the reservoir (a nd the lower hose may 
have one to the heater circuit). So 
unless a repair tee is ava ilable, don't 
be surprised if the hose prices o ut at 
$100. Other hoses (a lso not cheap) 
are permanently crimped to meta l 
lines, much like an air conditioning 
line or power steering hose. And even 
where there is a simple-looking hose, 
it ma y be a molded design, so that it 
fits into a very tight area (perhaps so 
it can connect to a metal line) without 
the possibi lity of kinking. (;

the immediate-if temporary- cure is

damaged starter-stud 
threads, or the nut had 
been cross-threaded when 
installed. Poor-quality 
rebuilts, used starters, 
goofs during ca ble or 
starter replacement are 
some of the usua I sus-
pects. In fact, th ese prob-
lems are so common th at 
you can buy an inexpen-
sive (less than $5) starter-
terminal repair stud kit at 
auto parts stores. This 
cuts its own threads as it 
is threaded onto a 
stripped stud (example:

And with the power

So if the old battery died 
and you installed the lowest-
price replacement you could 
get, th at could be the reason 
behind the slow cranking. In 
the days of carburetors, the

There's hardly any late-

If the engine starts easil y after it

ity. An easy check is to spray the 
starter with cold wa ter if you get 
slow cranking during a hot resta rt. 
Now it cra nks well ? If there's no

starter with better hot-starting a bil-

Batteries Not Included

high end of normal. 
Oil Is Thicker Than 
Water 
When all the battery connec-
tions are good, there are two 
common causes of high 
draw: engineltransmission 
friction and a bad starter. 
If the battery is under-
charged, yo u have to find 
out w hy. With the engine 
running at fas t idle, you 
should check charging 
voltage across the battery 
terminals. If the voltage 
isn't well over 13, some-
thing's wrong. Unless 
there's a loose or glazed 
belt yo u can p lainly see, 
inspect the battery-ca ble 
connections to make sure 
they're clean and tight. 
You can't see what the 
contact surfaces of side 
terminals look like with-
out taking them a part. 
An almost-invisible coat-
ing of corrosion can con-
stitute a charging barrier, 
so wire-brush them even 
if they appear good. 
Then, recheck the charg-
ing voltage. 
(Fig. 4) Check the ground connection to the vehicle's engine 
for contact as well. 
In cold weather, the fric-
tion may be ca used by engine

If the vehicle has a man-
ual transmission but can 
norma lly be cranked in 
Neutral without having the 
clutch pedal fl oored, a thick 
gea r oil may be slowing 
down engine cra nking. The 
thick gear o il may silence 
gear noise during warm 
weather, but by winter yo u 
may need something much 
lighter, both for easier start-
ing and better shift quality. 
Some carmakers recommend 
a utomatic transmission fluid 
in a manual transmission o il 
for cold weather. Throw in 
the clutch pedal and if the 
engine now cranks normall y, 
that's the tipoff. Check the 
owner's manual for accept-
able lubes. 
In hot wea ther, engine 
friction has the opposite 
cause: engine oil that's too 
still is low, inspect the 
other end of the ground 
(nega tive) ca ble. If the 
ground cable is a split 
design, the ca ble to the 
vehicle's body or chassis 
may be the easiest to see. 
But it has less to do w ith 
charging and starting, so 
more carefully check-
and tighten if neces-
sary-the cable to the 
engine, which may not be 
quite as accessible. 
Warning: Some cars have 
just a single ground ca ble 
from the ba ttery to the 
body (Fig. 3). But don't 
stop there. Somewhere 
else on the car there will

you're ready to find out if the starter 
circuit is pulling normal current. A 
low-cost induction ammeter (Fig. 5), 
which clips onto the battery ca ble, 
CURING SLOW CRANKING 
may not be a precision instrument, 
but it's close enough to pinpoint 
excessive current draw. Compare the 
reading with factory specs, if they 
exist. If they don't, here's a general 
guideline: Average starter draw is 150 
and the oil won't prov ide the 
thin-film lubrication the cylinder 
wa lls need. Synthetic o ils are better at 
maintaining their lubricity, but they're 
also slightly more expensive. 
In addition, if your engine is run-
ning on the hot side-not overheat-

ing, just running a bit hotter 
than it should-that thins 
out the o il a bit mo re. The 
extra engine heat also may 
heat up the sta rter, which 
then will dra w more current 
than normal. If the coolant 
temperature ga uge is read-
ing on the high side, get a 
precise reading, and if it's 
pushing 24S·F or even 
2S0·F, that's just too high. 
When everything else 
seems all right, make the 
fo llowing checks:

• Is the ignition timing 
being upset by electromag-
netic interference from the 
battery ca bles during engine 
cranking? This is most 
likely to happen if the bat-
tery or ignition w iring has 
been moved, even slightl y, 
during service. Perhaps a

Feel th e fluid. If it's very oily, it's

light oiliness. 
Yo ur initial analysis points to oil, 
but you're not sure about the color or 
wh ere it's coming fr0111 . Start pulling 
dipsticks. The power steering reser-
voir is a good place to start if the oil 
seems reddi sh (Fig. 1). If the reser-
voir is topped up, and the lea k is at 
the front, check the a utomatic trans-
mission cooler lines, p articularly if 
they have sections of rubber hose 
with clamps. 
If the oil is definitely black and the 
drops are directl y under the engine, 
it's engine o il, which is the most com-
mon lea k. But, once aga in , you're 
faced with that sa me qu estion: Where 
is it coming from? A slow leak fol-
lows ribs on th e engine block, is 
blown along the top of gasket joints, 
and oil gets everywhere. Put a lot of 
I ight in the engi ne compa rtmenr and 
take a look . You might get lucky and 
see the source. But unless you're sure, 
don 't replace anything yet. A lot of 
gaskets are not on ly tough to replace, 
but they have sophisticated designs 
that are anything but cheap (Fig. 2) . 
It would be a shame to waste a da y 
replacing a costl y gasket and still ha ve

Oi l also may be seeping past a 
worn cra nkshaft or camshaft sea l

the rotating shaft will eventua ll y wear 
to the point at which the tension in 
the garter spring won't keep o il from 
leaking. This type of seal w ill onl y 
lea k w hen the engine is runn1l1g- and 
when it does o il will spray everywhere 
from the spinning shaft. 
Because pinpointing an engine o il 
leak can be difficult, you should get 
all the help you can and, fortunately, 
a method preferred by the profession-
als is within easy reach: trace dyes

When you look at a pair of 
machined surfaces, or even 
today's well-finished engine 
surfaces, you may wonder 
why a gasket, an O-ring or 
other type of seal is needed 
to prevent an oil leak. 
Except for seals around 
rotating parts, wouldn't 
clamping the parts together 
tightly be enough to prevent 
oil leakage? 
The answer: close, but no.

also called a "compression 
set." Retightening gaskets 
helps and may work for a 
considerable time. But when 
it doesn't, the gasket must 
be replaced. Today's oil-seal-
ing gaskets (like all automo-
tive gaskets) are made of 
high-temperature synthetic 
materials, in combination 
with natural fibers, that are 
more resistant to a compres-
sion set. They have engi-
neered shapes that, when 
compressed, provide a more 
effective seal. There may be 
metal grommets around bolt 
holes to prevent overtighten-
ing. The gaskets often are 
Sorry, even mating joints 
bolted together look a lot 
more precise than they 
really are, and fluids can 
seep past them. It takes a 
flexible material in the joint 
to compensate for any 
unevenness and looseness to prevent, or at least mini-
mize, leakage. That flexible material is a gasket. The 
design of a gasket itself is a complex art. Simple materi-
als such as cork compress nicely and compensate for a 
fair amount of unevenness, but under the compression 
of a line of bolts, cork gaskets soon take a "heat set," 
made with raised rubber 
"beads," in some cases a single broad bead, in others, 
two or more riblike layouts, which set up a series of barri-
ers to oil leakage. Gaskets often are shaped to fit into 
grooves in the mating metal surfaces. Or a gasket may 
look almost like a large rounded band or square-cut rail 
and fit into a groove in each gasket surface.

These can be used fo r all fluids-oils,

The trace dye is fluorescent, so under 
UV light (so-called black light), it pro-
duces an unmistakable yellow/green 
glow. Aim the light, and a small dye 
stain may show you the source of the 
leak. The newest trace dyes were 
formulated in response to complaints 
from mechanics about low visibility 
of the dyes and the difficu lty of 
positioning the large UV 
lamps. Now you can find kits 
with compact, flexible lamps, 
improved trace dyes and 
coated yellow glasses that 
enhance the appearance

of the dye. 
The kits typically include two 
bottles of dye, one for oils and 
another for antifreeze/coolant. 
(Fig. 4) Ultraviolet light will 
make trace dyes glow brightly. 
The trace dyes for a/c refrigerants are 
very specific formulations, and they 
require special injectors. They are not

are sold in specific a/c kits.

trace dye (Y2 ounce, which is half the 
amount in the see-through bottle) 
with as much engine oil as you have 
left in your top-up bottle, then 
pour that into the engine. You 
could just pour the 1!~- o unce 
dose into the engine, but if 
there's a leak you're probably 
down on oil anyway. If you 
just pour in the trace dye dose, 
it will coat the oil fill er neck, 
and take a lot longer to be 
washed away by engine oil and 
mixed thoroughly into the oil 
suppl y. And it will take longer 
for the leak to show up. 
ENGINE 

After driving the car long enough 
to allow oil leakage, park the car over 
newspaper to catch the leaking oil. 
Check the drops on the paper with the 
UV lamp. If the drops glow, you're 
ready to look for the leak. Jack up the 
vehicle, support it on safety stands 
and connect the lamp clips to the bat-
tery. Then, put on the yellow glasses, 
aim the light up from underneath and 
press the switch. 
Because leaking oil may follow a 
twisty path, look for the highest point 
of any oil trace, and that should lead 
you to the source. In our case, the path 
started at the oil dipstick tube, which 
had a leaking O-ring seal. In most 
cases, you'll find a loose gasket joint, 
which you may be able to tighten. 
However, in many cases, the gasket will 
have taken a severe "set" in the joint, 
and retightening won't stop the leak. 
If yo u don't want to make th e 
investment in a trace dye kit, there is 
FINDING OIL LEAKS 
an alternative method for finding a 
lea k. You can use a coupl e of prod-
ucts yo u may a lready have at 
home- one in the ga rage, one in the

The garage item is aerosol engine 
degreaserlcleaner. Use the aerosol 
cleaner to loosen road film, then 
remove the film fro m the engine, 
transm ission and ad jacent underbody 
with a wa ter hose. Drive the vehicle 
to dry it off- or when you jack it up 
and support it all safety stands, wi pe 
the area clean and dry with a cloth. 
That's what you may have to do any-
way to remove a lot of the road film. 
The objective is to clean the under-
body well enough so road film and 
leaking black oil aren't confused. 
From the medicine ca binet, get 
aeroso l powder, such as that used to 
treat ath lete's foot, and spray the

to avoid wet, muddy roads in the

green, o r maybe red, or maybe

no, especiall y if it's been two years or 
more since the last time you drained it. 
Today's engines are loaded with 
aluminum components: cylinder 
heads, water pumps, manifolds, even 
engine blocks. And the twO primary 
heat exchangers-radiator and

HOW IT WORKS 
Cooling Your Engine 
A coolant pump, or water 
pump, circulates the 
antifreeze and water mix-
ture between the engine 
and the radiator. After the 
coolant circulates through 
the engine, the pump 
pushes it out the upper 
radiator hose into the radi-
ator, a heat exchanger 
made of metal tubes (alu-
minum on today's cars) to 
which fins are attached. 
The fins draw away heat 
and dissipate it to the air 
that is drawn through the 
radiator by fans and the 
forward motion of the car. 
The cooled coolant is 
drawn from the radiator 
through the lower radiator

hose and back into the engine by the pump, and the 
cycle starts all over again. 
When the engine is cold, coolant circulates only within 
the engine, so engine heat warms it up faster. At about 
195
0 F, the coolant heats a temperature-sensitive valve 
(the thermostat) that opens to allow the coolant to flow 
through the radiator. The thermostat may be located at 
the engine outlet, in line with the upper radiator hose, or 
at the inlet to the water pump (the preferred location on 
today's cars). 
the heater, which, like a miniature radiator, gives up its 
heat to the surrounding air. In this case, however, the 
heated air is blown into the passenger compartment. 
The coolant also flows through hoses into and out of 
Raising the cooling system's pressure also raises the 
coolant's boiling point, so the radiator cap (which also 
could be on the engine or on the separate reservoir) has 
a pressure valve to raise the pressure in the cooling sys-
tem by about 15 psi. This increases the boiling point of 
the coolant by about 40
0 F. So, the boiling point of a 
50/50 mix of antifreeze and water in a properly function-
ing system is about 265
0 F or higher. 
If the system has a heater coolant 
valve, close it by moving the tempera-
ture control lever or kn ob to COLD. 
With the engine running at fast idle 
and wa rmed up, have a helper move 
the lever or kn ob to HOT while yo u 
listen at the coolant valve. If after the 
first rush of coolant you hear a con, 
tinuous gurgling noise, there's still air 
in the coolant, and you shou Id be' 
prepared to watch the coolant level in 
the reservoir over the next few weeks. 
Picking the 
right antifreeze 
Most antifreeze is made with a base 
chemical called ethylene glycol. Green, 
yellow, red, orange, pink, and blue dye 
114 
is used. The dye is not an indicator of 
the formula. Extended-life antifreezes, 
rated for fo ur years/60,000 miles, 
were on the market until the mid-
1990s. But the newest entries are 
superlong-life anrifreezes with tota ll y 
new rust/corrosion inhibitors, in some 
cases developed originally for diesels. 
The original, from Texaco (used as 
original equipment by GM), is called 
Dex-Cool. Other Dex-Cool antifreezes 
also are available from Prestone and 
Zerex, perhaps others. Dex-Cool is 
recomended for five years or 150,000 
miles. Ford and Chrysler Group use a 
different antifreeze ca lled a "hybrid," 
recommended for five years or 
100,000 miles. 
The rust/corrosion inhibitOrs vary, 
but if antifreeze is a major brand 
that is not extended life, but is in a 
ca r with a lot of aluminum compo-
nents, change it in two years or 
30,000 miles- whichever comes 
first. You can push that to a third 
year if the engine is all cast-iron. 
"Toyota Red" is a specific formula, 
but if yo u drain it, you can replace it 
with any name-brand American for-
mula. Here again, the replacemen t 
interval is two yea rs or 30,000 miles. 
If you ha ve at least 5000 miles on 
the antifreeze, the chemical bond 
with the aluminum components is 
"solid." So if you want to get 
extended life with a coolant installa-
ENGINE 

tion, just do a thorough drain-by-
dilution, at least three times. T he 
coolant you drain out should be vir-
tua ll y clear, like the color of wa ter. If 
it's still colored, you have to repea t 
the process until it's a ll o ut. 
With the radiator and reservoir 
drained, pour in the amount of anti-
freeze necessary-there should be 
plenty of room-and then top up with 
water. Follow the procedures we've 
FLUSHING YOUR COOLING SYSTEM 
discussed to ensure a full system. 
Remember: You should do this only 
as a maintenance procedu re, not as a 
final step when replacing a parr, such 
as the water pum p and radiato r. 
What about "pet-friendl y" or 
"safer" antifreezes made with a base of 
propylene glycol? The name brands 
(Sierra and Prestone Lo-Tox) will do 
the same job as ethylene glycol. But 
they cost a little more and actuall y 
require a greater quantity to provide 
the same freeze protection, and in 
truth, they're onl y a bit less haza rdous. 
They aren't sweet, and conse-
quentl y aren't as likely to be con-
sumed by toddlers or pets. Don't rely 
on this, however. Sto re all unused

Checking Your Ignition Timing 
(Fig. 1) It's deep and dark in the engine compartment, and filthy to boot. On a cold 
engine, clean the timing tab and scale for better visibility. 
Y
OU floor the accelerator to pu ll 
around a line of exit traffic, and 
you rea li ze that yo ur car is 
barely responding. A taxica b is 
camped half an inch from yo ur rea r 
bumper, and the ca bby is altern ating 
between using one of his fingers to 
semaphore his displeasure with your 
fo rwa rd progress and lea ning on the 
horn button. Your car's acceleration, 
nonetheless, rema ins a fraction of its 
form er self. What could be w rong? 
The engine runs smooth ly, but simpl y 
lacks power. There's no Check Engine 
light or trouble codes. 
Pardon our asking, but when 
was the last time you checked the igni-
tion timing? Ignition timing? H ey, 
you're dri vi ng a '97 model with a big, 
fast engine computer. All of those elec-
n'onic gizmos handle that stuff, right? 
Actua ll y, you may need to dig out 
your old timing light and put it to use. 
Checking and, if necessa ry, adjusting 
ignition timing may have become lost 
skills, but a majority of cars and 
trucks on the road still have timing 
116 
marks-and they weren't put there 
just for show. 
If the sparks arrive at th e plugs too 
early or too late, engine performance 
drops and the vehicle is likely to fail 
an emissions test. Sure, changes in 
ignition timing have been controlled 
by the engine computer on cars and 
light trucks fo r many years. H owever, 
the basic timi ng still has to be right. 
There is a movement towa rd "coil 
on plug" igniti on, eliminating spa rk 
plug wires (a nd the convenient attach-
ment fo r the timing light) and the rim-
ing marks, too. If your engine has no 
marks, you'll have to check timing 
with a scan tester, which reads the 
sensor data processed by the COI11-
puter. H owever, if there are marks, 
you ca n make the mosr meaningful 
check-the actual tim ing rather than 
a computer-processed signal. 
If you have a car with a di stributor, 
the timing probably is adjustable. It 
may have very little range for adjust-
mem , but if you see any sign of a slot 
in tbe distribu tor's holes for the retain-
ing bolts or nuts, timing can be reset. 
Even if there is no distributor, there 
is a base timing specification, and if 
it's incorrect, th e engine won't run 
right. The problem could be ca used 
by a bad signa l from a sensor or even 
by a bad computer, but unless you 
check the timing, you won'r know. 
Most pre-'96 models were 
eq uipped with an emissions diagnos-
tic system ca lled OBD (On-Board 
D iagnostics) . A large number o f these 
models, including two best-selling 
ca rs, H onda Accord and Toyota 
Camry, have adjustable ignition tim-
ing. In 1996, a far more sensitive, 
complex system ca lled OBD II ca me 
into use. With either system, there's 
no guarantee that an igniti on timing 
error wi ll prod uce a Check Engine 
light or even a trouble code. 
Checking ignition timing is a 
straightforward procedure-if you 
have a good timing light that's right 
for your car. The type you need 
depends on th e type of timing marks 
on yo ur engine. Get the riming spec 
from a shop manual or an after-market 
service informarion system. 
(Fig. 2) The timing mark on the flywheel 
may be under a dust cover or plug.

Finding Timing Marks 
Locating the mark s may not be easy if 
they' re on the engine's front and are 
cove red with dirt (Fig. 1). The mark s 
may be fo und on an opening In the 
transmission bell housing. (A rubber 
plug may be used to keep road film

highlight the specified timing with a 
piece of chalk or white nail polish 
(Fig.3) . Keep the highlight thin since 
a wide mark can span several degrees.

out if a sensor or the computer is bad. 
W hen a timing light is aimed at the 
timing marks with the engine running, 
a fixed mark should a lign with the 
illuminated mark on the spinning parr, 
be it the crankshaft pulley or damper, 
or the flywheel. If the marks don't 
align, make the necessary adjustment 
of the distributor or go through a shop 
manu al di agnostic procedure to fi nd 
If there's just a fixed point and a 
single line on the crankshaft da mper 
or p ulley, you probabl y ca n't check 
timing with a simple timing light. 
Wh en those two marks are aligned, 
the timing is zero unless otherwise 
marked. Zero mea ns the spark woul d 
arri ve when the piston is at the very

T he actual timing is typically some 
number of degrees before (or even 
after) top dead center. If there's 110 
mark for th at specifica ti on, a ll you' ll 
see when the timing light flashes is 
that the two marks are some space 
apart. Is it the correct num ber of 
degrees? You need an adjustable tim-
ing light. W ith it, you can change the 
timing of the strobe light so that the 
light flashes ea rlier or later. You th en

HOW IT WORKS 
Distributorless Ignition 
An electronic module with a double-ended ignition coil 
for each pair of companion cylinders is the most common 
type of distributorless ignition. The companions are cylin-
ders with pistons that are in the same position in their 
respective cylinders at the same time-one on compres-
sion stroke ready for spark ignition, the other on 
exhaust. The coil module also contains electronic cir-
cuitry that communicates with the engine computer and 
executes its commands for ignition. There are three key 
inputs to the computer: the crankshaft and camshaft 
position sensors and a detonation (knock) sensor. The 
first two generally are electromagnetic devices that react 
to precisely located gaps in trigger wheels on the shafts. 
Changes in voltage caused by changes in electromagnet-
ism provide signals from these sensors that tell the com-
puter when each piston is rising on compression stroke. 
So, the computer can tell the coil module exactly when to 
discharge an ignition coil to provide a spark. The com-
puter then can keep track of the sequence of cylinders 
for the electronic coil module to fire (so long as the 
engine is running). All the system continues to need are 
the crank sensor signals. If the weather, fuel quality or 
operating conditions produce engine knock, the detona-
tion sensor sends a signal to the computer, which retards 
ignition timing. Each ignition coil discharges a spark from 
both ends, but only the one in the cylinder on com pres-

sion has a fuel mixture to ignite. The other spark dissi-
pates harmlessly in the exhaust gas of the companion 
cylinder. Ignition timing, along with fuel injection, is com-
puter-adjusted primarily according to changes in throttle 
position, rpm, altitude and vehicle speed.

appeared to align. If you changed it 
16' in the retard direction, the timing 
rea lly is advanced 16' . If the factory 
spec is 10' advance, the timing is too 
far ahead . If you changed it 6' but the 
timing specification is 10' advance, 
the timing is retarded. In either case, 
an ad justment is needed. 
Okay, that's the way it should 
work. Let's go through a real timing 
check to demonstrate. First, the tim-
ing marks have to be clean and visi-
ble. Visibility often is tough, because 
of engine-compartment crowding. 
You may have to unbolt and hang a 
fluid reservoir out of the way to get a 
straight-on viewing angle. That's 
important, because if your viewing 
angle is bad, you get what's called 
"parallax error," and it can mislead 
you by several degrees. 
Connect the timing light. The 
power and ground lead go to the 
battery, the lead with the plastic 
clip (ca lled the pickup) goes to 
the No. 1 spark plug (Fig. 4). 
The pickup must be squarely 
positioned on the plug wire. On 
an inline four-cylinder or six-
cylinder engine, the plug nearest 
the belt-and-pulleys end of the 
engine is virtually always No. l. 
If you have a V-type engine, 
you'll have to check the manual, 
since No.1 could be the first 
plug on either side. 
After connecting the timing 
light, start the engine and warm 
it up, so it runs at idle speed. It's rare, 
but some manufacturers specify check-
ing timing at a speed other than idle. If 
the timing isn't correct, you've got to 
find out why. The usual reasons are a 
defective crankshaft sensor (the part 
that reads crankshaft position for tim-

throttle-position sensor. There mayor 
ma y not be a trouble code to guide 
you, but with an ignition-timing check, 
you've made a good start. Scan-tool 
and Illultimeter tests of the sensors can 
take you the rest of the way. fI

core, a clear-cut sign that the engine is 
tipping forward on acceleration. It's 
time to check the engine mounts and 
"dog bone" struts before there's a 
major failure and possible sticking of 
the gas peda I (Fig. 1). 
Today's engine mounts are any-
thing but simple two-piece metal 
brackets with slabs of rubber bonded 
between them. They have engineered 
shapes, specific durometer measure-
ments (hardness) and often have 
strangely shaped cutout areas ca lled 
"voids"- air gaps that tun e the 
mounts' operatio n. In some cases 
they have hydraulic cham bers that 
are filled with silicone fluid , and also 
in limited use are ones with elec-
tronic controls. 
Okay, your car isn't brand-new and 
that's why the mounts are likely to be 
worn. The rubber may have been 
soaked with road film and oil (from a 
lea king va lve-cover gasket). But it's 
more likely, particularly at 50,000 to 
60,000 miles and up, that the mounts 
have cracks and distorted shape from 
the high temperatures common in 
toda y's engine compartments. If the 
weatherstripping along the cowl is 
missing, for example, that breaks the 
sea l for the back of the powertrain 
compartment, allowing air to flow 
over the top instead of circulating

mounts (a nd other components). 
The mount at the drivebelt (front) 
end of the engine has the biggest job 
119 

in today's transverse-
engined models. It reacts 
to both vertica l and fo re-
aft shake, so check it w ith 
a pry bar (Fig. 2) and 
look at the rubber. If it 
cracks open at the internal 
edges of any vo ided area, 
or if it exhibits virtuall y 
no resista nce, it is not pro-
viding much COntrol. 
Check fore-aft mounts, 
also by prying. In these 
cases, however, you'll 
probably have to force the 
bar against the metal 
edges of the mounts to be 
able to pry hard enough. 
What? Leaking Silicone? 
Mounts w ith hydraulic chambers are 
circular and have a metal shell as part 
of their structure. It is possible for 
them to leak internally, but you're 
more likely to encounter an external 
lea k. Surface cracks in th e rubber gen-
era lly are harm less, but run your fi n-
gers around them and if you pick up 
some thick, black goo that's not road 
film, it's the silicone oi l leaking out. As 
w ith an all-rubber design, the only fi x 
is rep lacement. You often can obtain 
aftermarket rubberll1letalmounts to 
replace hyd raulics at a significant sav-

Probably, particularly if 
the car is not destined for

tional use. 
Replacing Engine 
Mounts 
Although the powertrain 
end mounts on a trans-
verse-engined car can be 
replaced individually if 
th e one at the opposite 
end is good, it's better to 
replace both. When a fore 
or aft mount is bad on a transverse 
powertrain, always replace both . 
Ditto for the mounts on the dri ver 
and passenger sides of a north -south 
powertrain. 
Support the engine with a hydraulic 
floor Jack. If you have to place the 
jack on the o il pan, put a block of 
wood on the jack li fting pad to protect 
Electronic-Hydraulic Engine Mounts 
120 
The Honda electronically con-
trolled mount is typical of high-
tech mounts used in a variety of 
cars to dampen the last little bit 
of shake produced by the power-
train. It's a hydraulic engine 
mount with two fluid chambers 
connected by a large orifice (kept 
closed by a rotary valve) and a 
small orifice (always open). The 
small orifice allows the mount to 
operate much like a simple, fairly 
stiff shock absorber. At idle, how-
ever, a vacuum diaphragm unit 
operates the rotary valve to open 
POWERTRAIN 
CONTROL MODULE 
the large orifice, permitting more fluid flow between the 
chambers. It's like a shock that suddenly becomes softer, 
in this case absorbing the idle shake of the engine. The 
vacuum (from the engine) is fed through a solenoid valve 
that is controlled by the powertrain computer. This system 
operates when the engine is idling, perhaps triggered by 
turning on the alc (which produces a load that affects 
ENGINE MOUNT 
CONTROL 
SOLENOID VALVE 
engine idle). The computer 
opens the solenoid valve, and 
the engine vacuum flows to the 
vacuum diaphragm unit at the 
engine mount. When the sole-
noid valve closes above idle 
speed, the vacuum is vented 
and the engine mount goes back 
to single-orifice operation. If the 
vacuum reading fails to hold 
steady, there's a vacuum leak in 
the mount and it should be 
replaced. The next stage in elec-
tronic control of engine mounts 
already is in limited use (on 
some Lexus cars): A diaphragm pulsates in the hydraulic 
mount. The diaphragm creates a proportional counter-
vibration to the frequency of the engine shake in the 600-
to-900-rpm range, canceling the shake so the engine 
idles smoothly. If one of these mounts ceases to work, 
you may need to troubleshoot the wiring and check the 
mount itself.

the pan (Fig. 3). If the mount's nuts or 
bolts are frozen, spray them w ith pen-
etrating solvent so you ca n loosen 
them with a w rench and not have to 
resort to a chisel and hammer. ln most 
cases, removing the fasteners and jack-
ing the engine up slightly is all that's 
necessa ry to slide out a defective 
mount and insert the replacement. If 
you have to jack up a lot, there's a 
chance you could stress another 
mount unless you loosen it. Check 
before you pum p the jack handle. 
If there's a stud in the moun t 
you're replacing, make sure you have 
it aligned precisely w ith its hole 
before you lower the engine. O n 
many vehicles, you have to work both 
from underneath and above to insert 
and tighten nuts and bolts, and you 
occasiona lly w ill need a helper to pry 
on the engine while you get a bolt 
started through its mounting hole. If 
the mounting holes are slotted, run 
the engine and let it id le fo r a minute 
or two so the engine settles in the

bolts. Do the fin al tightening w ith a

Shock Absorber and 
"Dog Bone" Struts

it typica ll y is bolted to the engine at 
the top end, and a chass is crossmem-
bel' at the bottom. Disconnect the

shock at a whee l. If you fee l looseness 
or roughness w ith lost moti on, that's 
a sure indicator of a worn-out shock. 
Is there a dog bone strut or two? 
The dog bone usuall y is at the top of 
the engine compa rtment, at the fore 
side of a transverse powertra in. H ow-
ever, usuall y does not mean a lways. It 
may be insta lled at the top rea r side 
(typ ica ll y at the accessory-belt end, 
where it ca n directl y ass ist the engine 
mount), or even at the bottom center 
on the aft side of a tra nsverse engine. 
So if you don't see one at fi rst glance, 
don't assume it isn't there. 
T he ends of the dog bone ha ve 
rubber sleeve bush ings (Fig. 4) , and if 
the ru bber is cracked or distorted, 
replace the enti re strut (the bushings 
are not replacea ble) . It's a straightfor-
ward job. Just unbolt it at each end, 
and install th e new one. T he engine

bone is removed, in which case you'll 
have to pry it fo rwa rd into a lignment

Some premium aftermarket dog

bers, much like a shock absorber-so 
the damping is done hydraulica ll y 
instead of by sq ueezing ru bber

morning commute. The engine 
starts easily, runs fine while 
fast-idling down the driveway and 
down the street for a few miles, but

the stall occurs because the air horn in 
the tractor-trailer rig immediately 
behind you curdles the flui d in your 
inner ear's semicircular canals when 
forward motion fa ils to p roceed at an 
orderly pace. You restart, your car 
accelerates with a slight stumble, and 
when you coast to a stop at a traffic

where it's rea lly difficult to see. But

INTAKE 
AIR DUCT 
take the time to check them al I, mak-
ing sure they're not only on tight, but 
not cracked or burned through due to 
contact with an exhaust pipe or 
exhaust gas recirculation tube. Don't 
be surprised if the last hose you check 
is the one that's damaged. If all the 
hoses are intact and on tight, there's 
another possibility that's just as likely: 
dirt and gum accumulation in the 
throttle body. 
Get Dirty 
To check for this, you've got to remove 
the intake air duct between the air 
cleaner housing and the throttle body 
(Fig. 1). First, disconnect all hoses and 
unplug any sensor wiring connectors 
(Fig. 2) . If there's a chance you could 
confuse a hose connection or wiring 
connector, put a piece of masking tape 
on the hose or connector, another on 
the hose neck or sensor, and mark each 
with the same letter. 
Next, loosen any clamps, work the 
duct off the throttle body and set it 
aside. Wi th the wiring and hoses dis-
connected, you should not run the 
engine. Even if it starts and runs, it 
will log trouble codes, possibly trig-
gering the Check Engine light. Then 
you'll have to go through a code-

clearing procedure- extra work you 
don't want. Moreover, the computer 
may have to relearn some drivea bility 
trim settings, which may leave you 
with a marginally running engine for 
a while. 
O n some vehicles, it's possible to 
lea ve hoses and sensors connected 
and still move the intake air duct 
safely out of the way. In that case, it 
would be possible to spray a solvent 
into the throttle body opening with 
the engine running. However, there's 
no great advantage to this and, as 
you'll see, there are reasons why it's 
not such a great idea . 
Take a good look inside the th rot-
tle body using a flashlight. Operate 
the throttle linkage to open the throt-
tle plate so you can see past the out-
side surface of the throttle body. If 
you see a coating of dirt and oily film 
0 11 the inside wa ll of the throttle body 
or the edge of the throttle plate, 
you've likely fo und the problem. The 
coating both upsets and restricts the 
airflow when the throttle is closed or 
slightly open. 
Where do these deposits come 
from? Some are in airborne dirt that 
gets through tbe air filter or past a 
crack in the intake air duct. So be sure 
to check the intake air duct for cracks, 
particularly in the "accordion" area 
where they're not as obvious. Most 
deposits, however, are from oil gases 
transferred from the positive crankcase 
ventilation system and pushed forward 
by normal engine pulsation as the 
intake valves close and open, and fr0111 
exhaust gases that seep in. 
Some throttle body bores have a 
coating to reduce the buildup, but, in 
time, bores with protective coats can 
be affected. There are several ways to 
ENGINE 

clea n out the area . The best is with a 
professional tool ca lled the Intake 
Snake, w hich comes with an effecti ve 
yet safe solvent, and the si mplest is 
with an old worn-out toothbrush 
with soft bristles and a mild solvent. 
Tbere are tbree reasons w hy you 
have to be ca reful, both in cho ice of 
solvent and in applica ti on: 
First, if the th rottle body has a pro-
tecti ve coating (as on many Ford 
products) to reduce the buildu p, a 
strong solvent and hard brushing will 
remove it, so you 'd have to do the job 
more often. If you see a wa rning label 
on a Ford product, that's wb y. 
Second, there may be a senso r tip 
projecting into a small opening in th e

area of the throttle plate, and a 
strong solvent or hard brushing 
might damage it. In addition, a sen-
sor O-ring seal may be damaged by a 
strong solvent. 
T hird, the th rottle plate shaft is 
sealed at the mounting holes in the 
throttle bod y to prevent entry of 
unmeasured air (which would upset 
the fuel mixture). A strong solvent 
(and hard brushing) could damage 
the seals. 
Stronger Than Dirt 
Most aerosol carburetor and choke 
cleaners are pretty strong. Ditto for 
those aerosol cleaners that can be 
sprayed into the air intake with the 
tbrottle open for combustion-chamber 
cleaning. These aerosols have 
to be very strong to clean surfaces with-
out the mechanical adva ntage 
How A Throttle Body Works 
An engine runs primarily 
on air (about 15 parts 
by weight, to one of 
fuel), and the throttle 
body in a modern fuel-
injected engine is the 
device that controls the 
airflow through its 
round opening. When 
the intake valve for a 
particular cylinder is 
open, the air flows 
through the throttle 
body, which is mounted 
on the intake manifold. 
The airflow continues 
into the intake mani-
fold, through a chamber,

and then through the open intake valve into the cylinder. 
At the same time the fuel injector sprays in fuel, the 
inrushing air and fuel mix, the intake valve closes and a 
spark from the plug ignites the mixture. The intake air-
flow control is provided by the throttle plate, a pivoting 
plate on a spring-loaded shaft that goes through the cen-

ter of the throttle body's 
round opening. The 
throttle plate is a type 
of air valve, often called 
a "butterfly." When your 
foot is off the gas pedal, 
the throttle plate 
springs closed, and only 
a minimum amount of 
air, enough for engine 
idle, goes through a 
bypass around the throt· 
tie plate. One end of the 
throttle plate shaft also 
holds the movable con-
tact arm of the throttle 
position sensor, a vari-
able resistor-type sen-
sor that tells the engine computer whether the vehicle is 
idling, accelerating or holding a throttle position. On 
many new engines, the gas pedal is just a variable resis· 
tor, sending a signal to the engine computer. The com-
puter controls the throttle plate to produce the desired 
opening. This is called "drive by wire."

of a rubbing brush. A strong solvent 
can cause deterioration of not only sen-
sor seals, but also throttle shaft seals. 
Further, you can't see which 
deposits have been removed 
and which have not. The 
aerosol spray will not clean all 
areas, particularly the back 
side of the throttle plate. 
A tuneup/injector cleaner 
mixed with gasoline (1:4 or 
1:5 ratio) should be safe

much, and you can pour the

Start by cleaning the exterior of the 
throttle plate, and then hold it open 
using a wire tied to the throttle link-
age so you can clean the inside 
perimeter of the plate. All you're try-
ing to do with brushing is to loosen 
all tbe deposits. 
Next, clean the throttle body wall, 
being careful to work around any 
electronic sensors, and around the 
throttle plate shaft holes. When 
you're done, remove the deposits with 
solvent and a clean rag.

able separately for under $15). The

and won't scratch any-
thing. It's 14 in. long and 
moderately flexible, so you 
can reach deep into the 
throttle body and follow 
any contours (Fig. 4) . The 
rool holds the sponge like 
work tips that are coated 
with a hypoallergenic sol-
vent that's also safe for sen-
sors and throttle plate 
seals. Because the dirty film 
is held by the work tip,

Electric Cooling Fan Problems 
FAN CIRCUIT FUSE 
I
t's a really, really warm day, but the 
temperature gauge reads normal 
and the alc is blowing out a lot of 
cold air, so who cares? Tben the traffic 
suddenly slows to a crawl and doesn't 
get any better. Gradually the tempera-
ture gauge needle creeps toward the 
Hot end of the dial, and the air blow-
ing out of the alc registers is anything 
but cold. In fact, to forestall overheat-
ing, you shut it off. Even worse, you 
soon bave to turn on the heat to try to 
prevent a boil-over, and open the win-
dows to try to get a breeze. 
If you're lucky, the traffic tie-up 
of a powertrain computer, but the basic 
circuit is pretty straightforward. 
On almost all cars the fans should 
go on if the alc is turned on, triggered 
by the powertrain computer or by an 
ale pressure switch. The fans may not 
go on instantly, but certainly within a 
couple of minutes. If tbey don't, pro-
ceed to a circuit diagnosis. 
The simplest first circuit check you 
can make is the current feed, starting at 
the fuse, which on late models is in an 
underhood fuse box (Fig. 1). Just pull it 
out and look. Replace it if it's blown. 
On older models it's often a fusible

four gauge numbers higher than the 
wire of which it's part. You may see it's 
singed. Even if it isn't, pull on the ends 
of the wrap, and if it stretches, the wire 
underneatb is broken. 
Checking The Fan Motors 
Fuse okay? The most practical 
approach is to go next to the end of 
the circuit: the fans themselves. Most 
cars have two fans. Unplug one fan's 
wiring connector and (referring to the 
wiring diagram color codes) hot-wire 
the fan motor's half of the connector. 
Run one jumper wire from the current 
feed terminal of the connector half to 
the battery's positive terminal. Attach 
a second jumper wire to the other ter-
minal of the connector and run it to 
an electrical ground (Fig. 2). The fan 
should run. If it doesn't, the fan 
motor apparently is defective. 
Some cars have a single fan that 
runs at two speeds. In these cases, the 
connector may have: 
• Two terminals (one frol11 a dual 
power feed-through a dropping 
resistor for low speed and a resistor-
bypass circuit for high speed-plus 
the second one for the ground). 
breaks, and you're cruis-
ing again. The gauge nee-
dle starts dropping, and 
you turn off the heater. 
Still sweaty, you turn on 
the alc again, and even if 
the air isn't frigid, it's cold 
enough to make you feel 
better. 
(Fig. 2) Try jumping the battery direct to the fan to see if it spins. 
There's a splice or con-
nector for the dual power 
feed earlier in the circuit. 
If you check by hot-
wiring at the fa n motor 
itself, it will run at high 
speed.

Hot-wire each pair separately with

Testing Coolant 
Switch Or Sensor 
If both fans run when they're hot-
wired, the problem is somewhere be-
tween the current feed at the fuse and 
the fan motors. On older systems 
where the trigger for the fans is a 
coolant temperature switch, unplug 
the switch connector. Be sure you 
ha ve the right one, as some 
vehicles have as many as 
three: one for a dashboard 
warning light, one for an 
overhead console and one for 
the powertrain computer. 
With the engine running 
and with the coolant switch 
unplugged, the fan should 
come on because the power-
train computer logs a trouble 
code for a failed switch and 
turns on the fans in most sys-
tems. If it doesn't, and the 
switch is a typical domestic 
design, it has a normally open 
type that stays open until 
coolant temperatures are 
high, when it closes to turn on 
the fan. To double-check, just

ground the unplugged connector's sin-
gle wire terminal, using a jumper wire. 
The fan should spin. Many older 
Japanese cars have circuits with nor-
mally closed switches. They open with 
high coolant temperatures to turn on 
the fan, so a simple unplugging (with 
the ignition on) always should get the 
fans to operate with this setup. 
Most late models have a coolant 
temperature sensor. It isn't a switch, 
but a temperature-sensitive resistor

(thermistor) that sends a signal to the 
powertrain computer. The computer, 
which also has some control over alc 
operation, then decides when the fans 
should operate and at what speed. You 
may not be able to get a response by 
simply unplugging the sensor connec-
tor or even by grounding it. Instead, 
check its calibration by connecting an 
ohmmeter (Fig. 3). The thermistor 
develops lower resistance as the tem-
perature goes up, higher resistance as it 
ENGINE 

drops. If the sensor reads a thousand 
ohms or more (which signals low tem-
perature) when the engine coolant is 
warmed up, it's out of ca li bra tion. 
Replace it. Even easier is to use a scan 
tool which will give you a reading in 
degrees (c. or F.). 
Relay Diagnosis 
Head fo r the fan relay (or relays- some 
systems have low- and high-speed fa n 
relays) (Fig. 4). Turn on the ignition, 
and locate the relay terminal for the 
wire from the switch. When you 
ground its terminal with a jumper wire, 
the relay should click and the fan 
should run. If it does, the relay and its 
circuit to the fans are good. Any prob-
lem is in the wiring between the coolant 
temperature switch and the relay. 
If the fan still won't spin, continue 
at the relay, wh ich has two current 
feeds, one to the electromagnetic coil, 
one to the electrical contacts. Probe 
the two current feed terminals of its 
wiring connector with a grounded test 
light. With the ignition on, it should 
go on in both cases. No light in one? 
There's a break in the wiring from the 
fuse to that relay terminal. 
On systems wi th computer control 
via a sensor signal, make a similar test 
of the relay current feed term inals 
wi th a grounded (computer-safe) test 
light and the ignition on. 
If the current feeds are good, 
ground the relay'S switch term inal 
(the one with the wire that goes to the 
coolant switch ). If there's a sensor and 
the switch terminal wire goes to the 
powerrrain computer, unplug the wire 
before gro unding the terminal. The 
relay should click and oper-
ate the fans. If it doesn't, 
replace the relay. 
You may have trouble 
doing this with relays that 
plug into an underhood 
relay "center. " Unplug the 
relay, turn on the ignition 
and with your test light

from a fused source 
of 12-volt electricity. 
At the relay, there is 
one current feed into 
an electromagnetic coil, and one 
feed into a set of contacts for the 
switch, which is open. The other ter-
minal for that open switch is con-
nected to the electric motor for the 
fan. The fourth terminal, also for the 
coil, is wired to the powertrain com-
puter, which may look at various sig-
nals to determine whether or not to 
provide an electrical ground for that 
coil. If, as in this circuit example, it 
gets a high-temperature signal from 
terminals in the rela y center. If they 
pass (turning on the test light), make 
up short jumper wires to connect to 
the unplugged relay and one long 
jumper (that you run to an electrical 
ground ) for the switch terminal. If the 
relay still doesn't work (ignition on), 
replace the relay. If the relay does 
click, probe the output terminal to the 
fan motor with a grounded test light. 
Light goes on? The problem is in the 
wiring from re lay to fan motor.

the coolant temperature sensor, also 
wired to it, the powertrain computer 
can choose to ground the coil termi-
nal. This energizes the coil, creating 
a magnetic field that pulls the arm on 
the power feed contact, so that it 
touches the terminal for the wire to 
the electric motor. That closes the 
switch of the relay. Current flows 
through the closed contacts of this 
switch to the electric motor, which 
spins to operate the fan.

Complete Engine Testing 
Many people-even mechanics-
think that the beginning and end of 
internal engine diagnosis lie in using a 
compression tester. But the truth is 
that many internal engine problems 
(such as a weak valve spring, for 
instance) are not revealed by com-
pression testi ng alone. 
"A weak valve spring is easy to 
spot, if you use a vacu um ga uge," 
said Dave Hakim, an engi ne and fuel 
system specialist with Federa l Mogul 
Corp. "Connecting the ga uge to the 
intake vacu um would reveal normal 
vacuum at idle. But when a valve 
spring is bad, the vacuum needle 
would fluctuate rapidly between 12 
and 24 in. when you ra ise the rpm." 
You can diagnose most internal 
engine problems using a vacu um 
gauge, a compression gauge and a 
leakage tester. And you can usually 
get to the root of mysterious internal 
engine noises by being a good listener. 
Engine Noises 
The most common source of engine 
noise comes from the valvetrain . The 
noise-usually a clicking or tapping 
at half the engine's rotating speed-is 
caused by excessive clearance between 
components or a bad hydraulic lifter. 
On camshaft-in-block engines, you 
can isolate valvetrain noises by briefl y 
running the engine with the va lve 
cover off and pressing on each valve 
rocker with the end of a hammer han-
dle. When the pressure from the han-
dle removes the clearance, the noise 
disappears and you've found the 
problem. 
Diagnosing valvetrain noises is 
more difficult on overhead-cam 
engines beca use you can't run them 
with the valve cover off. 
Running the probe of a mechanic's 
stethoscope along the length of the 
valve cover with the engine running 
should allow you to isolate the noisy 
valvetra in component (Fig. 1). If you 
don't have a stethoscope, use a long 
screwdri ver as a probe and listen by 
placing your ear against the handle. 
Other internal noises include main-
and rod-bearing knocks, wrist-pin

noise and piston slap. A main-bearing 
knock has a deep metallic sound and 
is usually loudest when the engine is 
under load. If the knock is because of 
a failed bearing, low oil pressure may 
accompany the sound. Connecting-
rod noises have a lighter rapp ing 
sound under light engine load. Dis-
connecting the spark plug to the 
offending cylinder usuall y results in a 
marked decrease in the noise. Piston 
slap, caused by excessive piston-to-
cylinder wall clearance, causes a du ll 
rattle. Disconnecting the spark plug 
makes it go away. Wrist-pin noise 
usually gets louder when the spark 
plug is disconnected. 
Keep in mind that there are many 
external engine noises that can mimic 
internal noises, such as a loose fly-
wheel or broken flexplate. Drivebelt 
pulleys can also cause noise, which 
can be isolated by running the engine 
briefly with the drivebelts removed . 
Vacuum Testing 
A good manifold vacuum ga uge costs 
only about $35, yet it can quickly tell 
you a lot about what is going on in an 
engine. A vacuum ga uge can reveal 
how well the valves are working, 
whether the piston rings are sealing 
adequately or whether camshaft tim-
ing is retarded. 
To perform a manifold vacuum 
test, begin by connecting the vacuum 
ga uge to an adequate source of 
intake-manifold vacuum. 
On most engines it's easiest to tee 
the ga uge hose into a vacuum hose 
such as the hose that runs from the 
intake manifold to the vacuum brake 
booster. With the gauge connected, 
start the engine and let it warm up to 
operating temperature. O n most 
properly running engines, the ga uge 
will hold steady between 15 and 20 
in. If the needle fluctu ates at idle, it 
indicates that one or more valves are 
leaking. Doing a compression test or 
an engine leak-down test will reveal 
the leaking valve or valves. 
A slightly low vacu um-gauge read-
ing, along with a slight flutter of the 
ga uge, may indicate that the valve 
guides are worn (Fig. 2) . On engines 
without overhead camshafts, you can 
verify guide and seal conditions by 
removing the valve cover(s) and 
squirting engine oil on the tops of the 
129 

va lve guides while the engine is run-
ning. If the vacuum-gauge reading 
increases and blue smoke starts to 
appear from the tailpipe, it's a good 
indication that the valve guides are 
worn. 
If the vacuum reading fluctuates 
between 5 and 7 in., it indicates that 
va lve timing is excessively late. A 
skipped tooth or excessively worn 
timing chain or belt are all likely 
ca uses. 
To check for weak or broken va lve 
springs, increase engine speed to 
2000 rpm. If the gauge needle fluctu -
ates between 12 and 24 in. and the 
fluctuations increase as engine speed 
increases, the valve springs a re weak. 
If the fluctuation is irregular, it's 
likely that one va lve spring is weak 
or broken. 
If intake vacuum appears normal 
in the above tests and the engine oil is 
in good condition, you can do a quick 
test to determine piston-ring sealing. 
To do this, bring the engine speed up 
to 2000 rpm, then let the throttle 
snap closed. If the vacuum reading 
jumps 5 in. o r more over the normal 
reading, it indicates that the piston 
rings are in good condition. 
Compression Testing 
A compression test can reveal a lot 
about an engine's internal condition, 
but onl y if it's performed properl y. 
Many people mistakenly do compres-
sion tests with old diluted oil, the 
engine cold or with the throttle closed. 
Begin by warming the engine to 
norm al operating temperature. Then, 
use compressed air to blow all the 
spark plug wells clea n before remov-
ing the spark plugs. 
Disable the ignition, then connect 
th e compression gauge to the No.1 
cylinder, according to the instructions 
suppli ed with the gauge. Ha ve an 
assistant hold the throttl e wide open 
while crank ing the engine over until 
five complete compression stro kes 
ha ve been completed (as indicated by 
pu lses on the ga uge). Record the 
compression readings on the first and 
fifth strokes. Repeat the process for 
each cylinder. 
130 
A cylinder has good compression if 
it achieves two-thirds of its total com-
pression on the first stroke and 
reaches the minimum factory com-
pression specification by the fifth 
stroke. If the compression reading is 
low on the first stroke and builds with 
following strokes but doesn't reach 
minimum compression, the piston 
rings are probabl y not sealing well . If 
the ga uge reading remains low on all 
five strokes, it usually indicates a leak-
ing va lve. Low compression in two

probe should show no CO2 when the

adj acent cylinders indicates a blown 
head gasket. 
If all engine cylinders achieve 
proper compression, then you're 
done. If any of the cylinders had low 
compression, however, you'll have to 
confirm the cause by doing a "wet 
compression test. " Squirting oil into 
combustion chambers with low read-
ings temporaril y improves seal ing of 
the piston rings. I f compression goes 
up 10% or more w hen you repeat the 
compression test, then the rings are 
bad. If compression stays the same, 
then the compression leakage is most 
likely from the va lves. 
Keep in mind that a wet test won't 
work on horizontall y opposed Volk-
swagen, Porsche and Subaru engines. 
Leakage Testing 
Long favored by professiona l racing 
mechanics as the most accurate 
method for testing an engine's com-
bustion-chamber sealing, a cylinder 
leakage tester works by pressurizing 
the combusti on chamber with com-
pressed air and then measuring total 
leakage as a percentage. 
A leakage tester, which costs about 
$75, will not only tell you the condi-
ti on of the rings and va lves, it can tell 
you if the leak is coming from an 
intake or exhaust va lve (Fig. 3). 
To do a leakage test, warm the

spark plugs. Remove the 
air cleaner and block the 
throttle wide open. 
Rotate the engine so the 
No.1 cylinder is at the 
exact top dead center 
(TOC) on the compres-
sion stroke. Install the fit-
ti ng from the lea kage 
tester in the No.1 spark 
plug ho le, then connect 
an air-compressor line to 
the tester. Pressurize the 
cylinder and note the per-
centage of leakage on the 
ga uge. 
An engine in grea t 
shape will have cylinders 
with 5% to 10% lea kage. 
An engine with 20% 
lea kage is still in pretty 
good condition. If the 
engine has a cylinder with more than 
30% leakage, however, you should 
isolate the cause.

mechanic to place the

probe in a plastic bag. By 
placing the plastic bag

exhaust gases th at are leaking from

EASY 
Plugging Leaks 
T
he sweat pours down your brow 
as you lift the hood while gaso-
line gurgles into your tank in the 
self-serve lane. Through the shimmer 
of heat that escapes from underhood 
you lean over to check the level of 
bright green coolant in the translucent 
overflow tank. Empty, again. 
You've topped it up a few times-
but the last few tankfuls it's been dry 
inside. In fact, coolant seems to be 
disappearing at an accelerating rate. 
The weather is getting hotter, and 
you're about to take a vacation. It's 
time for some action. 
It should be easy to prevent most 
major coolant leaks since they usually 
occur when a hose fails. And you 
should be able to spot the bad hose 
before it bursts by those telltale signs 
of heat cracking and other deteriora-
tion, right? Wrong. While coolant 
hoses near the end of their useful lives 
used to show the classic warning 
signs, they no longer necessarily do. 
Today's hoses are so much better you 
can't tell only by looking. 
132 
Fig. 1. Remove a stubborn hose by 
carefully slicing it. Don't nick the neck 
it fits over. 
You should also be able to easily 
spot a coolant leak, even a small one. 
After all, the antifreeze contains a 
green dye that leaves a stain. Well, 
the truth of the situation is that your 
current model engine may have more 
than a dozen hose connections- and 
other joints sea led by gaskets and 0-
rings- and many of them are buried. 
To top off the problem, there are 
ways that coolant can escape from 
the system without leaving so much 
as a trace. 
Even when you find the leak, it 
may take some special steps to fix 
it. Result: Finding, fixing and pre-
venting future coolant leaks 
involves a lot more than it used to. 
But if you take the time to do the 
job right, yo u'll be able to avoid the 
repeated need to top up the system, 
and the disaster that would occur if 
you forget. 
Fixing Obvious Leaks 
If a leak is obvious, such as a leak-
ing radiator, cracked hose or badly 
leaking joint, that's great-a solid 
starting point. If it's an O-ring type at 
a coolant pipe, clean the groove if nec-
essary with ultrafine sandpaper or 
steel wool. Wipe clean, and then 
replace the O-ring, lubricating it with 
antifreeze. Leaky radiator? Check 
with a radiator shop, and you may get 
away with an inexpensive repair. 
It might be possible to resolder a 
split seam or a leaking joint at the 
neckltank junction on an old copper-
brass radiator without even removing 
the radiator from the car. Even leaky 
plastic-tank radiators can sometimes 
be repaired by replacing the O-ring 
between the end tank and the alu-
minum core. This is definitely a task to 
leave to a professional, however. It's a 
hose? If the clamp is not tight, and the 
leak is from the hose end, perhaps the 
hose has taken a compression set 
under the clamp. Try a simple retight-
ening-but don't overdo it, or you'll 
distort the hose and neck, and just end 
up with a worse leak than you had. 
Tightening the clamp doesn't help? 
Replace the hose. Uh-oh, it's stuck. 
Grab it with pliers and twist? Not 
unless you want to crush the hose neck 
and make it impossible to seal prop-
erly. Better to cut it off instead. 
With a razor blade, slit the leaking 
end of the hose at several points around 
the circumference, gently pry up each 
slice, then peel the rest of the hose end. 
Don't nick the neck on the radiator or 
engine, or it'll never seal again. Clean 
the neck- on the radiator, engine, 
heater core, connector pipe-with a 
wire brush and wipe clean. Then install 
the replacement hose, using fresh 
antifreeze as a hose lubricant. 
Radiator necks are generally pretty 
sturdy, but heater-hose pipes are usu-
ally very fragile. Twisting and prying

to remove a hose-or replace it later-
can easily break the seal between the 
pipe and the heater core's tank. And 
removing a heater core to repair or 
replace it can involve removing half of 
the underside of the dashboard-an 
operation that can consume a dozen 
hours or more. Use caution. 
Unless there's lots of slack in the 
hose, don't try to trim the cut end and 
reuse it. What's left probably will kink 
and ultimately restrict coolant flow. 
Use a new clamp and position it 
correctly for a leak-free connection, 
being extra careful if there is a ny 
damage or distotion to the hose neck. 
The two best types of clamps are the 
constant-tension spring band and the 
360
0 adjustable double-band. A 
decent-quality, worm-drive tangen-
tial-force clamp, with a slotted band 
that won't dig deep into the hose rub-
ber or cut it when you 
tighten, also does a good 
job. The screw-tower 
clamp, widely used as 
original equipment, is tol-
era ble for a bra nd-new 
system, but is a bout the 
least effecti ve for reseal-
lI1g. 
Install the hose as far as 
possible on the neck, and if 
there's a stop, right up to it. 
Position the clamp carefully 
so that it's about midway

PLUGGING LEAKS 
berween the end of the hose and the end 
of the neck, typically about one-half 
inch or more from the end of the hose. 
If there's a raised sealing bead on the 
neck, position the clamp flush against 
the back side of it. If it's any distance 
away, it won't seal as well and it will 
force a crevice berween the hose and 
neck. Coolant will collect and stagnate 
in the crevice, accelerating corrosion 
(and erosion) of the neck on copper-
brass radiators, eventually resulting in a 
significant leak. If a hose neck is badl y 
distorted or eroded, get it reshaped or 
repaired by a radiator shop if you 
expect it to seal. 
Finding Hidden Leaks 
Sure, you ha ve to look hard to 
inspect all the hose connections, 0-
rings and gasket joints, but you can 
get some help if you first pressuri ze 
the system with a cooling-system 
pressure tester. Pump up the system 
to its rated pressure plus a co uple of 
psi . If the ga uge reading holds fo r 2 
minutes or so, the cooling system 
isn't leaking- at the moment. H ow-
ever, yo u may still be losing coolant. 
Does the gauge's reading sta rt 
dropping almost immediately? That 
tells you the system isn't holding 
pressure, and if you start looking 
yo u sho uld see leakage from the 
offending joint or possibly the wa ter 
pump's weep hole. All water pumps 
seep a minor amount of coolant 
(there's no such thing as a perfect 
sea l), but if you see steady dripping 
or more, the pump seal is bad. 
Replace the pump. 
O kay, the press ure ga uge reading 
hardl y budged, and yo u' re still losing 
coolant. Now the diagnosis gets a bit 
tougher, because there 
are these possibilities 
-Although cold engine 
leaks are more common, 
it's also possible the leak-
age o nl y occurs with a 
hot system. Run the 
engine to warm up the 
system and retest. 
-There is minor seepage 
from many joints and it a ll 
adds up. If your engine's 
cooling system has a lot of 
connections, inspect them 
all fo r even the slightest 
trace of coolant staining. 
Simple retightening of all 
the hose clamps may do 
the job. 
-The leakage is from the 
133 

overflow reservoir, which on many cars 
is at atmospheric pressure and isolated 
from the pressurized part of the cool-
ing system. Hairline cracks in reser-
voirs often result in leaks that travel 
along body seams and are detectable 
only if you are really looking for them. 
-The engi ne periodically runs so hot 
that coolant fills the atmospheric over-
flow reservoir and overflows it. Or the 
pressure cap valve is wea k, so that 
coolant flows from the system into the 
reservoir even under normal operating 
temperatures. Check the coolant level 
in the reservoir immediately after get-
ting stuck in heavy traffic. If coolant is 
ready to pour out of the reservoir 
vent, pressure-test the cap to see if it's 
holding the specified pressure. 
On systems where the reservoir is 
pressurized, inspect the radiator-cap 
valve seal for deterioration. A bad 
seal can allow coolant to be lost by 
evaporation. 
Ifthecapisgood, nextcheckthe 
antifreeze concentration with a

antifreeze is low (below 50%), the 
coolant will boil at a lower-than-nor-
mal temperature and contribute to the

running too hot, a poor cooling sys-
tem condition may be responsible. 
This wou ld include low coolant level, 
an electric fan coming on too late (or a 
mechanica l clutch fa n slipping), a 
defective water pump, a plugged radi-
ator or even something as simple as a 
bug-and-road film coating on the front 
of the condenser or radiato r. Such a 
coating blocks the cooling airflow. 
Preventing Future Leaks 
Toda y's hoses fail more often from 
the inside, beca use of a problem 
called electrochemical degradation, 
the catchy ECD for short. T he metals 
of the cooling system and the hose 
material, combined with the coolant, 
form an electrical cell that produces a 
low DC vo ltage, particularl y at high 
coolant temperatures. Over a period 
of time, the electrical flow is enough 
to cause fine cracks to develop inside 
the hose, starting at both hose ends 
and working along the length of the 
hose. Eventuall y, th e hose develops 
a pinho le lea k o r ma y even burst. 
You ca n't see this damage, but you 
ca n feel it. Wrap your thumb and two 
or three fingers (not your whole hand) 
around the hose at the end and feel with 
your fingertips for soft "channels. " 
Run your fingers around the hose to 
develop a mental picture o f what the 
inside circumference of the hose must 
look like. Work your way from each 
hose end toward the center of the 
hose, and if the hose feels more solid 
as you approach the center, it's proba-
bl y suffering from ECD. According to 
studies by Gates Rubber Co., most 
upper radiator hoses, for example, are 
ready to leak (if they haven't already) 
after about four yea rs of service. 
So if any of your cooling system 
hoses fa ils this fingertips test, drain the 
system, cut the hose and peel it off. And 
insta ll new premiLU11 hoses designed to 
resist ECD. You can get silicone hoses, 
but newer designs of another synthetic, 
EPDM, are less prone to tearing and are 
designed to resist ECD. Secure them 
with good-quality clamps and your 
engine should keep its cool. 
If you're topping up your system 
after a leak, all you rea lly need to do 
is add a 50150 mixture of coolant and 
water to the radiator. But if you've 
been topping up with wa ter, you have 
no rea l idea of the relative concentra-
tion of the two fluid s. Perhaps yo u've 
been using water from some roadside 
ditch or rain puddle-a better propo-
sition than walking or melting an 
engine for sure, but one that requires 
you to drain the cooling system com-
pletely and flush it. 
If you've flu shed the system for 
wh atever reason, don 't just start 
pouring 50150 coolant into the rad ia-
tor. There still wi ll be a lot of water in 
the system that won't drain from the 
radiator (see page 101) and they'll 
leave you with a low concentration of 
glyco l. Instead, look up the capacity 
of your cooling system in the owner's 
manua l or the shop manual. Add half 
that amount of undiluted coolant, 
and top it all off with pure water. 
You did collect the drained coolant 
for proper recycling or disposal, did-

If you have automatic temperature 
control, there may be built-in diag-
nostics you can access for trouble 
codes covering the temperature con-
trol door. (Refer to a service manual, 
factory tech service Web site or

you can watch the temperature-door

have to check a manual or Web site 
for instructions.) If you don't see 
and/or feel the motor or flap-door 
shaft operate as you change the tem-
perature reading, you've pinpointed 
the problem. In many cases, the flap-

must be replaced, but the motor is 
good and can be reused.

cable is kinked or the flap is jammed. 
Total free play? The cable is loose or 
disconnected, or rhe flap is broken. 
Nothing'S obviously wrong? There 
may be air pockets in the 
cooling system-these com-
monly develop over time. If 
there's a pressure cap on the 
radiator or engine and a low 
coolant level in the radiator, 
but the level in the reservoir is 
norma l, a defective gasket in 
the cap is admitting air. 
Replace the cap. 
Top up the system and 
purge air, fo llowing the vehi-
cle maker's specific procedure. 
Simply blocking the radiator can make your car 
warm up faster in extremely cold weather. 
As a generic approach, 
start with the engine cold, all 
bleed valves open, and the 
side of the vehicle with the 
coolant neck jacked up as 
high as possible. This raises 
the fill neck to the high point, 
so air bubbles out. Slowly add 
a 50/50 antifreeze/ water mix-
ture to the fill neck. You'll see 
some coolant (and perhaps air 
bubbles) oozing out of the 
bleeders. Close the bleeders, 
refit the pressure cap, and run 
the engine at about 2500 rpm 
until it's warmed up (or as 
warm as it will get). Allow the

engine to cool down, then repeat the 
top-up procedure. You may have to 
repeat this every few days over a week 
to get most of the air out. 
Coolant temperature too low? On 
vehicles with a clutch-type fan on the 
engine, make sure the clutch is not 
locked up. Spin it by hand (with the 
engine off but warmed up). If there's 
virtually no slippage, the clutch is 
defective. If it spins two to three 
times, it's probably okay. 
Could someone have removed the 
thermostat, probably trying to rem-
edy an overheating situation? That's a 
very bad idea, not to mention the fact 
that it is illegal to tamper with emis-
sions controls. 
No fan operation problem and 
coolant temperature is very low? If 
you've neglected your system, the 
thermostat might be stuck open from 
debris. If it's really buried, pour in a 
cooling system cleaner and run the car 
per the instructions. Then, do a triple 
drain-and-refill of the radiator and 
engine block, and go through the air-
bleeding top-up process. If coolant 
temperature remains low, bite the bul-
let and remove the thermosta t for a 
test. 
If the access to the 'stat isn't bad, 
hold off on the drain-and-refill, and

pull the 'stat for a look and a test. 
Clean if necessary, but before putting 
it back refit the 'stat housing, then 
run a cleaner through the system. 
Then do the triple drain-and-refill, 
and test the thermostat before you 
decide to reinstall. 
Testing: Wedge a 0.002-in. feeler 
between the closed 'stat valve and its 
seat, then submerge the 'stat in a pot 
of water on a stove. Rest a radiator 
thermometer in the water, heat the 
water to boiling, and note the tem-
perature at which the thermostat 
cracks open-it wi ll drop off the 
feeler at its rated temperature. 
Some engines, particularly trans-
verse four-cyl inders, radiate so much 
heat so fast that there's no internal fix 
for extremely cold weather. It may not 
be an elegant solution, but put a piece 
of cardboard against the front of the 
radiator, blocking about half of the 
surface area. Trim it back if the engine 
starts running hot. Remember to 
remove the cardboard in the spring. 
Coolant temperature reading is 
normal, but one or both hoses are not 
hot? Refer to a service manual or Web 
TURNING UP YOUR HEATER 
site to identify the heater inlet versus 
outlet hose. 
Neither hose is warm ? Many cars 
have a heater coolant shutoff valve 
spliced into the heater inlet valve for 
better ale performance in summer. If 
the shutoff valve fails to open fully, 
the flow to the heater will be 
restricted. Vacu um operated? Discon-
nect the hose. If you feel vacuum 
(with some valves you'll also see the 
linkage move), the valve is being held 
open by a defective vacuum control. 
Leave the hose disconnected (plug the 
end with a golf tee) and see if that 
cures the problem. If it doesn't, the 
shutoff valve is stuck. Replace it. If 
the valve is cable controlled, you 
should see the valve shaft move con-
tinuously as the dashboard tempera-
ture lever is operated. If it doesn't or 
if it moves just slightly, the cable 
needs adjustment. Note: The VW 
Golf and Jetta have a cable-type 
valve, but it opens proportionally to 
the flow of hot coolant as needed-
there are no flaps in the dash. 
On some other European cars and 
on the Lincoln LS, the valve works 
sim ilarly to the VW's, but it's elec-
tronica lly contro lled. Quick test: 
Unplugging the electrica lly con-
trolled type should force the system 
to fu ll heat. 
If the heater inlet hose is noticeably 
warmer than the outlet, the heater 
core is restricted from debris in old 
coolant or from excessive use of 
sealer. First, try to reverse-flush the 
heater core. Do this by either discon-
necting both heater hoses from the 
heater necks on the cowl and attach-
ing spare hoses, or by disconnecting 
both heater hoses at the engine. 
(Clamp off the heater hoses if you're 
using spare hoses; plug the engine 
hose necks if you're disconnecting 
there.) Force a garden hose into the 
heater outlet hose, aim the inlet hose 
away from the vehicle, and open the 
bibcock. If the debris flows out and 
you eventually see a healthy flow of 
coolant, you may have caught a 
break. Otherwise, you've got to 
replace the heater core. 
If heater performance during high-
way operation is all right but it really 
drops off in low-speed driving, there's 
a cooling system flow problem. Some 
systems have a hose restrictor in the 
inlet hose, and if it gets plugged with 
debris, that lowers the flow. You 
should find this by fee ling along the 
inlet hose with the engine idling. 
(You'll reach a section where the tem-
perature significantly drops.) A few 
engines (on the Dodge Durango, Lin-
coln LS and a number of German 
cars) have auxiliary water pumps to 
improve coolant flow at low 
speed/idle. If the pump fai ls, heater 
output drops during that operation. 
Of course, if the cooling system was 
long neglected, it's possible the engine 
water pump has eroded internally, 
reducing coolant flow. 
In most cases, poor heater opera-
tion can be cured by following the 
factory top-up procedure with the air 
bleeds open. Do this several times 
over the course of a week. Is there a 
faster fix? A pro with a coolant 
changer that purges air as it fills the 
system can give you faster heat. tI

(Fig_ 1) Adjusting the throttle-valve

in the process is not something you 
have to live with. Nor is it a problem 
you have to drop a few weeks' pay to 
correct. Most of the causes are things 
you can fix or prevent, and although 
you'll need a good service manual for 
adjustment procedures, specs and 
parts locations, you won't need a col-
lection of special tools or instruments. 
There are two basic types of auto-
matics: the fully hydraulic and elec-
tronic hydraulic. In a fully hydraulic 
automatic, found primarily on older 
vehicles, all the shifting is controlled 
by piston-type valves that slide in a 
valve body and direct the pressurized 
fluid to the appropriate bands and 
clutches. The road-speed signal comes 
from a centrifugal hydra ulic device 
called a governor and the engine load 
(acceleration) signal comes from a 
cable or linkage between the trans-

mission and the throttle body. Shift 
quality and engine load also may be 
signaled by a vacuum modulator, a 
diaphragm unit connected by a hose 
to engine vacuum, and by a link to a 
piston-type va lve in the valve body. 
The electronic hydraulic may have a 
hydraulic valve body with electronically 
controlled solenoids that provide sig-
nals for directing fluid flow. Or it may 
have a set of solenoids that directly 
control fluid flow. The road-speed sig-
nal comes from a vehicle-speed sensor 
and the load signal from the throttle 
body's throttle-position sensor. 
Garage Shifts 
If the Park or Neutral to Drive shift-
ca lled the "garage shifr"-is rough, 
but other shifts are normal and the 
idle speed is high, then high idle is 
very likely to be the reason. There are 
many possible causes of high idle speed 
on cars with computer-controlled idle, 
including vacuum leaks, a malad-
justed throttle-position sensor and 
lea king O-rings around fu el injectors. 
Idle speed normal? If you'd been 
pulling a trai ler, particul arly in hot 
weather, the automatic transmission 
fluid may be oxidized. This is a com-
mon ca use of harsh shifts, particularl y 
with the garage shift. You won't always 
get a bad smell from oxidized fluid , 
but if you've done the kind of high-
load operation that could overheat it, 
a fluid and filter change might help. 
All Shifts 
If all the shifts are harsh, the mileage 
is high, the fluid has never been 
changed and the service has been 
severe (such as hot-weather trailer 
towing), it's possible that a ll the con-
trol hydrau lics are sludged or sticky. 
You could drop the oil pan for an 
inspection and if that's what you find, 
a straightforward fix is to bolt in a 
replacement valve body. That's still just 
a moderate investment. H owevel; before 
you go this far, check out all the other 
possibilities that can be easily fixed. 
For example, when the harsh shift-
ing is ill every gear, the hydraulic-
pressure feed, or line pressure, is likely 
to be too high. Also, on some trans-
missions the design is such th at harsh-
CURING A HARSH·SHIFTING AUTOMATIC 
VACUUM 
MODULATOR 
ness could resu lt fro m pressure that is 
too low, so don't forget a fluid-l evel 
check with the dipstick. 
Note: Some late model a utoma tics 
may suffer poor shift quality if they were 
drained and fi lled with other than a 
specified fluid. A fluid designed for Ford 
Type F applications will cause problems 
in a Ford transmission for which Type H 
is specified, for example (see page 132). 
Before you go further on a car or 
truck with an electronically controlled 
automatic, watch the speedometer. If 
the readings bounce around a Jot, per-
haps from zero to 2 or 3 mph when the 
car is stopped and idling, the vehicle-
speed sensor apparently is misbehaving 
and a bad road-speed signal may be 
what's upsetting the shift quality. Note: 
The sensor could be misbehaving with-
out the speedometer effect. The best 
check is with a scan tool. 
On vehicles with fully hydraulic 
transmissions, the hydra ulic gover-
nors that supply the road-speed signal 
may cause late or mushy shifts, but 
are not likely to ca use harshness. 
Road Load Signals 
The transmission's hydraulic pressure 
is modulated by a throttle valve, 
141 

which responds to how hard you're 
accelerating. The valve is in the trans-
mission's valve body, the assembly of 
hydrau lic valves tbat routes the pres-
surized oil to make the shifts in most 
transmissions. And with an automatic 
transmission that is controlled 
hydra ulically instead of electronically, 
the valve is connected to external 
linkage and a cable that goes to the 
engine's throttle body to provide that 
throttle-position signal. 
However, almost all 1980s and up 
to mid-1990s cars and trucks use a 
cable from the transmission to the 
throttle-body linkage, and that cable 
has an adj uster at one end. On most 
General Motors and Ford products, it's 
at or close to the throttle body. On 
late-model Chrysler products with the 
3-speed (basicall y hydraulic) transaxle 
and many imports, including Honda 
and Toyota, the adjuster is at the trans-
mission end (Fig. 1). 
The adjuster has some provision for 
varying the length of the cable assembly, 
and it has a spring that takes up back-
lash. The details of adjustment vary 
(which is why you need a service man-
ual), but the principle-including inspec-
tion-is similar among most makes. 
Inspect the spring to see if it's bro-
ken or weak (so it doesn't compensate 
for free play in the cable). Replace a 
bad spring. Check the cable-retaining 
142 
PISTON SPRING 
brackets to ensure they're not loose or 
bent, and that they hold the cable 
housing properly. Look for a bent link 
at either end of the cable. Next, oper-
ate the throttle linkage and watch the 
cable, which should function smoothly 
and progressively at both ends. If it 
doesn't, make the adjustment. 
On General Motors vehicles, a typ-
ical procedure would be to press the 
release button on the adjuster and 
pull the cable slider through the 
adjuster with the throttle linkage held 
closed, leaving just a hair of free play 
so there's no binding. 
On a Honda Accord, the usual 
method begins with running the engine 
at idle, pulling on the cable housing 
toward the throttle body to remove all 
play and checking for some free play 
between the bracket and the locknut 
on the throttle-body side (about .040 
in., which you can measure with a 
feeler gauge) (Fig. 2). If there's not 
enough or too much free play, hold the 
locknut on the transmission side (the 
lower locknut) and turn the locknut on 
the throttle-body side (the upper one). 
Things vary somewhat for electron-
ically controlled transmissions. 
Because the throttle-position sensor 
provides the upshift/downshift signals, 
it's the primary item to check. If the 
throttle-position signal to that throt-
tle-valve assembly is wrong, the shift

quality goes down. To see if the sensor 
is operating within factory specs, per-
form a scan tool test. Or probe the sig-
nal terminal of the sensor with a high-
impedance (minimum 10 megohms) 
digital voltmeter, following the service 
manual procedure. 
Both fully hydraulic and electroni-
ca lly controlled transmissions may use 
a vacuum modulator. And the modula-
tor is a major factor in shift quality in 
either case. The modulator takes the 
engine vacuum signal and uses it to 
control the shift characteristics, so if 
vacuum is low (because the engine is 
out of tune or because there's a vacuum 
leak), the transmission will behave as if 
the car is being accelerated and "stiff-
ens" the shifts. With the engine idling, 
disconnect the vacuum hose and feel 
the hose end for a strong vacuum (at 
least 13 in. if you want to check with a 
gauge). Also test for a leaking 
diaphragm by inserting a cotton swab 
into the neck. If there is any transmis-
sion oil on the swab, the diaphragm is 
leaking. Replace the diaphragm unit. 
High altitude and low vacuum can 
affect shift quality, so if you've moved 
up to the mountains, ask the local 
DRIVETRAIN 

(Fig. 4) Some transmissions use an 
external damper bobweight at the end 
of the tailcone to control vibration. If 
it's missing or loose, you could have 
poor shift quality. 
dealer if there's a special modulator 
with an altitude compensator. 
Only One Shift 
Does the harsh shifting occur only in 
one gear change, such as First to Sec-
ond or Third to Fourth, for example? 
The accumulator is something to sus-
pect on fully hydraulic and partly 
electronic automatics. Most hydraulic 
clutch/band circuits have an accumu-
lator, which is a spring-loaded piston 
assembly in a chamber, to prevent 
shift shock. If the chamber is filled 
with sludge or the piston spring is bro-
ken, it could be responsible (Fig. 3). If 
the accumulator is external, you can 
remove the cover and look inside. 
Of course, a sludge-filled or var-
nished accumulator chamber could 
indicate a varnished va lve body under 
the oil pan. So one harsh shift now 
could become all harsh shifts soon. 
H owever, just cleaning out the one 
external-access accumulator now could 
be smooth-shift news for a long time. 
If the accumulators are on the valve 
body, the job is more difficult because 
you'll have to remove the oil pan. But 
at least you get a look at the valve 
body too. Refer to a service manual to 
see what's involved in an inspection. 
Shudder and/or Vibration 
The automatic transmission 10ckllP 
clutch, used on every modern auto-
matic to help the carmakers meet 
fuel-economy standards, is responsi-
ble for all sorts of shudders, particu-
larl y if it engages at the wrong time. 
A simple way to determine if it's the 
reason for poor shift quality is to 
unplug the wiring connector on the 
transmission. Do this only for a brief 
test, as many transmissions will over-
heat fluid if they don't get clutch 
engagement. And be sure to unplug 
the right connector, as many auto-
matics have more than one, particu-
larly if they have electronic controls. 
If the transmission becomes silky 
smooth with the clutch circuit dis-
abled, check with the dealer to find 
out if there's a factory fix. On newer 
cars there may be a reprogrammed 
computer or a new computer module 
to raise the shift speed. Or there may 
be a recalibrated pressure switch (to 
accomplish the same thing) in a 
hydraulic passage for the transmis-
sion-speed governor. 
Another cause of shudder or a 
vibration is a loose, broken or missing 
vibration damper that may be 
CURING A HARSH·SHIFTING AUTOMATIC 
attached to your transmission (Fig. 4). 
Not a lot of cars have a damper, and 
the damper alone doesn't directly 
affect shift quality. But if it's not intact 
and tightly mounted, the overa ll 
response of the transmission is 
affected, and that may worsen the 
feel of the shifts. 
\1(1hatever you do, don't try to cure 
shift problems by pouring some addi-
tive, particularly a limited-slip differ-
ential oil, into the transmission. Lim-
ited-slip oil contains a large dose of 
special friction modifiers that cures 
harsh shifts and shudder. But it also 
causes so much slippage that the 
clutches and bands will burn out fast. 
What about harsh downshifts on 
acceleration? Well, the typical down-
shift, made at full throttle or close to it, 
generally is harsh. If it's the only harsh 
shift and it suddenly becomes much 
harshel; check the fluid level. If the fluid 
level is normal, and you have a fully 
hydraulic automatic, open the manual 
and look for a downshift cable adjust-
ment. It often is similar to the throttle-
valve cable adjustment, but made at 
wide-open throttle. Check the manua l. 
The odds are very good that yo u' ll 
fi nd the reason for your car's harsh 
shifts somewhere among the basic 
items we've covered here. Then, you 
can send those nasty little shifts back 
to charm school. tj

EASY 
Replacing Your Automatic 
Transmission Filter 
Y
Ou've just spent the hottest 4 
hours of your life creeping 
through a colossal traffic jam. 
You pull into the driveway and col-
lapse into your favorite comfy chair in 
your air-conditioned den. Later, in the 
cool of the evening-before you begin 
packing the family car for a get-
away-you check the car's vital fluids. 
The oil and coolant are okay, but the 
automatic transmission dipstick is still 
too hot to touch- the fluid on it is as 
black as squid ink and smells like the ' 
bottom of a barbecue grill after a pic-
nic. Time to change the transmission 
oil and fi lter. 
The oil in your automatic trans-
mission can get very hot- often 
approaching 300°F-when you're 
pulling a heavy load or moving slowly 
in hot weather. But it also can get 
every bit as torrid when the wheels

bolts on the transmission pan from rear 
to front, then drain the oil. 
are spinning and slipping on icy roads 
in winter, so this is a year-ro und issue. 
And the oil becomes contaminated 
with particles that have worn off the 
transmission's clutches and bands, 
even metal shavings from the pump 
and other moving parts. 
Don't wait until the oil sample on 
the automatic transmission dipstick 
has a burned odor to change both the 
oil and the filter. Unlike engine oil, the 
automatic transmission oi l not only 
has to lubricate, it also has to provide 
hydra ulic pressure to operate the 
clutches and bands that produce the 
gear-ratio changes. 
Factory recommendations for trans-
(Fig. 2) Use a scraper to remove the 
remains of the old gasket, being care-
ful not to scratch the aluminum trans-
mission casting. 
mission oil and filter changes range 
widely. GM, for example, says 
100,000 miles, but that's under ideal 
conditions. And the recommendation 
comes down to as low as every 15,000 
miles given one or more of the follow-
ing: you drive in a lot of traffic and 
high temperatures, periodica ll y pu ll a 
tra iler or other heavy load, let the car 
sit idling for long periods or subject it 
to other operation similar to taxi, 
police or deli very services. Mom's taxi 
service surely falls in the latter cate-
gory, so a transmission oil and filter 
change every two yea rs or every 
30,000 miles is good practice. 
Getting Greasy 
Jack up the front of the cal; support it 
on safety stands, put a large catch pan 
underneath the transmission and loosen 
the transmission-pan bolts (Fig. 1). 
Remove the bolts at the rear, then 
loosen the others, so the oil drains out 
one side into your catch pan. On the 
typical car, several quarts will come 
out, which is less than half of the oil 
inside- and there's no practical way 
to get out any more oil. Consider that 
DRIVET R A I N 

the next time you want to postpone a 
transmission service. Finally, remove 
all the bolts and lower the pan. (And 
no, most transmissions don't have a 
drain plug.) 
Scrape the gasket from the pan, tak-
ing care not to gouge the flange sur-
face (Fig. 2). Wire-brush any gasket 
residue from the pan. If any piece of 
gasket sticks to the underside of the 
transmission, gently remove it with a 
scraper-not a screwdriver, as the sur-
face normall y is soft aluminum and 
prone to being gouged. A gouged sur-
face may not seal, even with a new 
gasket. If the gasket is rubber with a 
ra ised center section, it's reusa ble if it 
is still in perfect condition. Just clean 
and dry the gasket surfaces on the pan 
and transmission. If it's damaged, 
replace it with one of the same type. 
Clean the pan thoroughly, as there 
will probably be a fair amount of silt 
in the corners, from sludge, worn fric-
tion-clutch material and tiny bits of 
metal. Big flakes of metal might indi-
cate a problem, but expect a certain 
amount of shiny stuff. 
If the oil-pan bolt holes are dis-
torted by previous overtightening, 
place the edge of the pan on a heavy 
metal surface (your workbench, for 
example) and with a ball-peen ham-
mer, tap them down flat to ensure a 
good sea l.

abrasive particles pass right through, 
another compelling reason to service 
the tranny regularly. 
Remove the old filter, which typi-
ca ll y is held by screws. Pull it down 
slowly, as it may have a neck with an 
O -ring, and you should remember 
where that ring is (Fig. 3). Some 0-
rings sit on the neck, but are prone to 
sticking inside the case when you 
remove the filter. If you don't remove 
the old O -ring and add a new one 
with the new filter, it won't seat 
properl y. Most General Motors cars 
have an O -ring, but there's a cup sea l 
that goes in the case on some models 
since 1994 . The filter neck is inserted 
into it, and there's no O-ring at all.

Fina ll y, add fres h oil. Not all cars 
use the sa me type. Most late models 
take Dexron lIE or Dexron III, 
altho ugh Ford recommends an oil 
that meets its M ercon standard 
(including some older cars for w hich 
a "Type H " fluid was prescribed ). 
Check yo ur owner's manual. Major 
brands of o il are fo rmulated to meet 
a ll these carmaker requirements, and 
you should use one of them. A few 
European cars and older Fords 
(some through 1981) may require a 
Type F fluid, which is nothing like 
the Dexron and M ercon formulas. If 
Type F (or the virtually identica l 
Euro-spec Type G) is listed in the 
owner's manual, that's w hat you 
should pour in. New N issan prod-
ucts ma y call for Type J or Type K 
fluid , which is not a Dextron type. 
Oil is generally added to the 
trans through the dipstick tube and 
you'll need a long skinny funnel or 
a funnel and a hose to get it in . 
Some GM a utomatics have no dip-
stick and removal of a fill plug is 
necessary. 
Whatever type of oil you need, fol-
low the carmaker's precise recom-
mendations for checking fluid level. 
Typica lly, you have to cycle the shift 
lever from P to L and back a few 
times and add the oil with the engine 
running. Do it slowly, recheck repeat-
edly, as less than a pint can be the dif-
ference. Overfilling causes as many 
performance problems as a low fluid 
level, so if there's any transmission oil 
left in the quart bottle, don't pour it 
in . Pur the cap back on and save it. If 
someday down the road you fi nd the 
dipstick reads low, what's left in the 
bottle should be JUSt the right amount 
to top it off. tI

DIFFICULT 
Replacing Your 
Front-drive Car's Clutch 
T
he problem was almost imper-
ceptible at first: Going up a 
slight hill at highway speeds, 
you noticed that the engine was 
revving higher even though your car 
wasn't going any faster. Backing off 
the gas or dropping into a lower gear 
made the problem go away each time. 
But that was a month ago. Now 
yo u spend your days looking for 
routes that have no hills, beca use 
even a slight incline causes the 
engine to rev wildly while the car 
slows down. There's also the smell 
of burnt buttered popcorn in the air 
as yo u downshift in a feeble attempt 
(the semi driver on your bumper is 
blasting his air horn) to reduce the 
engine load and get the car going 
aga in. Your biggest fear is that yo u'll 
end up backing down the hill. The 
problem isn't in the engine or 
transaxle. All that slipping is caused 
by a worn-out or misadjusted clutch. 
Compared to other automotive 
devices, the clutch (Fig. 1) is decidedl y 
low-tech (see How It Works, fo llow-
ing page). And while replacing and 
adjusting the clutch doesn't require 
exceptional skill or high-tech equip-
ment, there are some things you 
should look out for. 
Please Release Me 
It couldn't be simpler: Push the clutch 
pedal in and the clutch should disen-
gage. H owever, if the clutch doesn't 
fully disengage, you'll hear a lot of 
grinding during shifts or when you try 
to put the car in gear. "A lot of people 
immediately think there's a problem 
with the clutch disc or pressure plate 
when the clutch doesn't disengage," 
says Ga be Vajda, a technician with 
LuK, a maker of clutch pans. 
"Any play in the clutch-pedal parts 
soaks up travel, so the clutch won't 
fully release," Vajda cautions. He says 
that before you remove the transaxle

Also, a nonreleasing clutch could even 
be caused by something as simple as

thick, which has been the case with 
some 1988-90 Chevy Beretta and 
Corsica models. Trimming away insu-

full pedal travel.

(Fig.2) Remove the outer stub axle from the hub, and then pull the entire axle free

HOW IT WORKS 
148 
Clutch Play 
At the heart of the clutch assembly is the clutch disc. It 
has friction material, similar to brake-lining material, on 
each side and a splined hub that slides back and forth on 
the transaxle's splined input shaft. When the clutch 
pedal is not depressed, the clutch disc is tightly clamped 
between the flywheel and the pressure plate to firmly 
connect the engine to the transaxle. Depressing the 
clutch pedal allows the clutch disc to spin freely between 
the flywheel and pressure plate, allowing the engine, fly-
wheel and pressure plate to spin on their own, while the 
splined input shaft and transaxle freewheel with the disc. 
The clamping force that engages the clutch comes 
from a large spring, or series of springs, located inside 
the pressure plate called a diaphragm. Depressing the 
clutch pedal presses on the diaphragm spring, causing 
the pressure plate to move away from the clutch disc, 
and the clamping force diminishes until the engine can 
spin independently of the transaxle. 
To get the clutch moving, the clutch pedal is con-
nected to a sheathed cable or a hydraulic master cylin-
der and slave cylinder. The cable system works much like 
a heavy-duty version of the brake-caliper cable that can 
be found on a 10-speed bicycle-depressing the pedal 
pulls on the cable to release the clutch. With the 
hydraulic system, pressing on the clutch pedal moves a 
piston in the master cylinder, which displaces fluid, caus-
ing the piston in the slave cylinder to move. This, in turn, 
operates the clutch. Some older cars and trucks use a 
simple mechanical bellcrank linkage instead of a cable 
or slave cylinder, but the mechanical principle is the 
same: Depress the clutch pedal and the clutch is 
released. How? 
Whether the clutch-pedal system is operated hydrauli-

cally or by cable, it moves a release fork that pivots on 
the bell housing. The pivoting action moves the end of the 
fork toward the pressure plate. A throwout bearing (also 
called a clutch-release bearing) at the end of the release 
fork applies even pressure to the diaphragm spring and 
the pressure plate moves back, releasing the clutch disc. 
Let the clutch out, and the pressure on the spring

housing. O n ca ble-operated clutches, 
there co uld be too much play in the 
cable, which can reduce travel. To 
reduce cable p lay, find the adjusting 
nut at the top or bottom of the cable 
and adj ust the cable to the proper 
specifications. O n hydraulica ll y oper-
ated clutches, air in the lines, or a 
worn master or slave cyli nder, can 
result in reduced travel. To bleed the 
air, top off the master cylinder reser-
voir with brake fluid. Place a piece of 
hose on the slave cylinder's hydra ulic 
vent, then place the other end of the 
hose into a partially fill ed glass bottle. 
Open the vent, then have an ass istant 
repeatedl y depress the clutch pedal 
slowly until any bu bbles coming fro m 
th e end of the vent line disappear. 
After tightening the vent, clutch travel 
should return to normal. If it doesn't, 
then the slave and master cylinders 
should be replaced. 
Removal and Inspection 
Barring adjustment, the onl y way to 
fix a slipping clutch is to rep lace it. 
Insta lling a new clutch is very 
stra ightforward. But you have to 
make sure the work is done right, 
since fix ing any mistakes usuall y 
means removing the transaxle- some-
thing you don't want to do Illore than 
once. It's best to consult a service 
manual for instructions specific to 
your vehicle. T he following is a gen-
era l procedure for replacing a clutch. 
Start by disconnecting the battery 
positive ca ble. Then, while wor king 
under th e hood, prepare th e tra nsaxle 
for removal by disconnecting the 
clutch ca ble or hydraulic slave cylin-
der. Also, remove or disconnect items 
th at prevent the transaxle fro m being 
removed, such as backup-light wires, 
air-cleaner ducting, exhaust pipes, the 
starter motor, speedometer ca ble and 
other items. If you are in doubt as to 
exactl y what needs to be removed, 
consult a manual. 
Next, chock the rear wheels and 
jack up the front end of th e car and 
support it with stands. Working from 
under the car, remove any additional 
parts that you couldn't reach from 
under the hood, including the bolts

(Fig.3) A support bar or a stout piece of 
timber will be necessary to support the 
engine while the tranny is out. 
that hold the axle shafts to the 
transaxle on IllOSt vehicles (Fig. 2). 
To remove the transaxle, you nor-
mally have to remove one or more 
engine lllountS. But before yo u can 
start removing them, you'll have to 
support the engine. W ith many cars, 
it's possible to support the engine 
from underneath by placing a jack 
(Fig.4) The clutch is readily accessi-
ble-but only after removing the 
transaxle from the engine. You'll need 
to remove or unhook the axles as well. 
under the oil pan (with a third piece 
of wood on the I ift pad to prevent 
damage to the pan). But on other 
cars, a special engine-support rod that 
allows the engine to hang while the 
transaxle is out must be installed 
under the hood. (Fig. 3) Again, con-
sult a manual for the proper method. 
To disconnect the transaxle from 
the engine, support the transaxle with 
a jack and remove the bolts frolll 
around the fl ywheel bell housing. Next, 
slide the transaxle away from the 
engine until the transaxle input shaft 
clears the pressure plate, then lower 
the transaxle to the ground and roll it 
fro m under the car and out of the way. 
Once you have reilloved the trans-

axle, you will then be able to access the 
pressure plate and clutch disc (Fig. 4). 
Remove the bolts from around the 
pressure plate, then remove the plate 
and clutch disc. Inspect the friction 
surface of the flywheel. If it is scored, 
checked or shows signs of hot spots, it 
must be removed, machined at a 
machine shop and then reinstalled . 
Keep in mind that it's good practice to 
have the flywheel machined so the 
clutch disc has a proper surface to 
break in on. If you don't have the fly-
wheel machined, sand it lightl y with 
medium-grit sandpaper wrapped 
around a small block of wood, then 
wipe clean with a damp cloth. 
150 
When inspecting the flywheel, also 
inspect the pilot bearing or bushing at 
the center of the flywheel. The needle 
bearings (if applicable) should be 
lubricated and show no signs of 
galling. If there's any doubt about the 
quality of the bearing, remove it with 
the appropriate tool and install a new 
one. You should also inspect the back 
side of the fl ywheel for signs of oil 
leakage at the engine's rear main seal. 
If oil reaches the surface of the clutch, 
chattering and grabbing will result. 
Some cars have "stepped" flywheels, 
which is when the clutch disc rides on 
one surface and the pressure plate 
bolts to a surface that's stepped above 
the clutch surface. It's important that 
both surfaces be machined the same 
amount, or slipping or fa ilure to 
release could result. 
(Fig.S) You'll need an old tranny input 
shaft, this special arbor, or a wooden 
dowel to center clutch disc on flywheel 
as the pressure plate is installed and 
torqued down. 
If the flywheel is machined too 
much, it moves the clutch and pres-
sure plate away from the release bear-
ing. This can keep the clutch from 
fully releasing. You might be tempted 
to use shims between the crankshaft 
and fl ywheel to move the clutch 
assembly toward the release bearing. 
However, it's possible for a thin fly-
wheel to burst at high rpm. The only 
safe alternative is to replace the worn 
flywheel with a new one. 
Inspect the transaxle's input shaft 
DRIVETRAIN 

seal to be sure it isn't leaking. (There's 
no need to inspect the clutch disc, 
pressure plate or release bearing, since 
you'll be replacing those.) If the seal is 
leaking, replace it. Next, look for 
leakage at the engine's rear main seal. 
If there's more than a hint of seepage 
there, this may well be the reason for 
the early demise of the clutch disc. 
Mark the flywheel so you can reinsta ll 
it back on the crankshaft in the cor-
rect index. Remove the fl ywheel and 
remove the old seal. Carefully install 
the new seal without gasket sealer by 
tapping it in with a seal installation 
tool, or at least a large socket or a 
piece of wood. Check the crankshaft's 
sealing surface for a depression where 
the seal has eroded the metal (this is 
particularl y common in dusty areas). 
There may be a repair sleeve available 
for your engine, so check with your 
machine shop if you think you have a 
problem. 
Installation 
Before you install a new or fresh ly 
machined flywheel, make sure the 
crankshaft flange is clean. After plac-
ing the fl ywheel on the flange, 
tighten the bolts in a star pattern to 
the proper torque specification. 
There are two tricks to installing the 
clutch disc and pressure plate. First, 
the disc is designed to go on in one 
direction. If you look at the center 
hub, you'll notice a series of damper 
springs. On one side of the cl utch, 
this damper hub sticks out from the 
friction surface. That side always 
goes toward the trans axle. Put it in 
the other way, and yo u' ll soon be 
taking the transaxle out to do it all 
over aga in. Second, yo u'll need a 
"clutch pilot tool" to install the 
clutch disc so it aligns with the pilot 
bushing in the crankshaft (Fig. 5). 
To install the disc, slide it onto the 
pilot tool, then securely stick the cen-
ter of the tool into the pilot bearing. 
Install the pressure plate over the 
clutch disc, torque all bolts to speci-
fications using a star pattern, then 
remove the pilot tool. 
Before installing the transaxle, 
install the new release bearing onto 
the release fork, then make sure that 
the fork operates freely. Jack the 
transaxle into position and slide it 
forward so that the input shaft slides 
into the splined hole in the clutch 
disc. You may have to turn either the 
input shaft or the engine's crankshaft 
(and the flywheel and clutch along 
with it) to get the splines to align. 
Don't force the input shaft into its 
splined hole. When everything's prop-
erly a ligned, the shaft will slide right 
REPLACING YOUR FRONT-DRIVE CAR ' S CLUTCH 
in. If it doesn't slide right in, don't 
force it. Back it out and try again. 
Never let the transaxle hang 
unsupported from the engine, since 
this can lead to damage to the pilot 
bearing, input shaft and front input 
shaft bearing. 
After installing and torquing all 
the bellhousing bolts to spec, you can 
reinstall any motor mounts that you 
had removed, the drive axles, as well 
as any other components under the 
car. Once the underside work is done, 
remove the jack holding the 
transaxle and lower the car to the 
grou nd. Reinstall any ul1derhood 
components. 
You don't really have to replace the 
clutch cable at this time, but because it 
costs less than $75, replacing it is 
good insura nce against trouble later 
on. In any case, adjust the cable to the 
proper amount of free-play. 
Most hydraulic clutch actuators 
are self-adjusting and, therefore, have 
no free-play. Still, you'll want to make 
sure the self-adjusting action is work-
ing properly. To do that, simply push 
the slave cylinder piston back into its 
bore. If it moves, the system is work-
ing properly. If it doesn't move, it 
means the slave cylinder's pressure-
relief orifice is clogged and the slave 
cylinder should be replaced. ~

All modern automatics (except for the

speeds, thus saving fu el. These are 
contro lled by the powenrain control 
module (the engine and transmission 
management computer) on the basis 
of speed, temperature, throttle posi-
tion, etc. If the engine is running at a 
higher rpm on the highwa y than 
usual-300 to 500 more-to main-
tain the same speed, it's possible that 
lockup isn't occurring. Besides reduc-

much more disastrous effect of ca us-

Pour ATF back into the dipstick tube with a funnel. 
The single most important 
thing you can do to head 
off big-bucks transmission

ATF on a regu lar basis. 
Some ca rmakers have 
backed down from the 
unrea listic 100,000-mile

recommended in the past. 
Every 30,000 miles is 
much more reasonable. If

ramps. Block the rear wheels. If you 
have a gravel driveway, toss a 4 x 8 
sheet of plywood down first to pre-
vent the stands from tunneling into 
the ground while you're 
under the vehicle. 
If you just remove the 
pan (leave a few bolts 
along one side partway in), 
ATF will flow out in a 
wave all around the seam, 
probably splashing outside 
the radius of your catch 
pan. 1£ you've got a suit-
able pump, you ca n run the 
pickup hose down into the 
dipstick tube until it bot-
toms out, then pump until 
yo u stop getting fluid. This 
will vastl y red uce spillage. 
To extract as much of 
the old ATF as possible, 
leave the pan on, remove a

hose into the largest jug you can find, 
and let the engine idle until air starts 
spurting. Many professionals enhance 
this procedure by pouring a few 
quarts of fresh fluid into the dipstick 
tube at rough ly the same rate that the 
old fluid is coming out, thus adding 
flushing action. 
Now you can remove the pan. This 
is not only necessary for changing the 
filter, but also allows deposits and 
sediment to be washed out of the pan. 
There's another important considera-
tion: This operation provides the 
opportunity to find out if fa ilure 
is impending. Judging this is some-
what subjective, so we asked an ASE 
Master Automotive Technician his 
opll1lOn. 
"You should see next to no swarf 
or debris, and then only on the first 
change," he says. "Subsequent 
changes should be nearly dead clean. 
If a newer gearbox is making junk, it's 
in trouble. You might find just a trace 
of aluminum shavings, or other very 
minor debris, but the assembly 
process is so clean, and the newer 
gearboxes so unforgiving of dirt, that 
any real accumulation genera ll y 
means a problem is in development." 
Now's the time to replace the filter 
and its seal, which probably can be 
purchased in the same kit as the trans-
mission pan gasket. When rein-
stalling the pan, start every pan 
bolt by hand for at least two 
threads before tightening any 
of them. 
If the last person to

places will just attach the machine to 
a cooler line, exchange the fluid, and 
call it done. We beg to differ. The pan 
shou ld be removed for cleaning. 
The Right Stuff 
Most of the autOmatic transmissions 
on the road will work just fine on 
Dexron III/Mercon ATF, except for 
'92 and earlier domestic Fords, which 
need Type E But the Dexron is essen-
tially a generic fluid, and some experts 
sa y they've cured shifting 
problems simply by 
replacing it with the 
exact O.E.-specified 
stuff. They have also con-
fided in us that they've 
inadvertently caused trouble 
by using bulk ATF that was 
labeled, "Will also work in ... " 
So, especially with imports, you 
might want to read your owner's 
manual carefully where fluid speci-
fications are listed. 
You want real peace of mind? 
Then think about spending the extra 
money for synthetic ATF. The master 
technician mentioned earlier always 
uses straight $5-per-quart synthetic 
for his own vehicles. (I

the ends of the trunnions rust and 
eventuall y crumble, which results in 
clearance where there should be none 
at all. 
Another destroyer of U-joints is an 
excessive angle of operation. This 
may be due to an overloading condi-
tion, which makes the tail end sag, or 
a set of helper springs or a ir shocks 
that puts the rear of the car up into 
the stratosphere. In either case, level-
ing the vehicle is the only way to 
increase the universal joints' life span. 
The driveshaft itself is a simple-
enough component. Unless it's bent 
from contact with, say, a railroad 
track or is out of balance due to the 
loss of a weight, it' ll keep spinning 
just about fo rever. 
Rules Of Thumb 
Vibration caused by a U-joint or dri-
veshaft usuall y occurs at 25 to 35

mph, about 60 mph, or while braking 
a t low speeds. That" body boom " 
that hurts your ears probably is 
caused by a bent or unbalanced drive-
shaft. A clunk when the tra nsmission 
is put into gear, or when " floa ting" at 
about 10 mph, is either the result of 
damaged U-joints or a differential 
problem. 
To find out if a vibration is coming 
from the driveline or the engine, 
attach a tachometer if you don 't have 
one on the dash, run up to the speed 
at which the roughness is felt, and 
note the rpm. Then, shift into a lower 
gea r, go back up to the same rpm and 
see if the vibration has diminished. 
No ? Then you've found engine trou-
ble. If, on the other hand, the vibes 
change considerably at the original 
engine speed, the U-joints or drive-
shaft are probably at fault. 
Next, raise the vehicle and support 
it under the rear axle or suspension 
control arms so that the springs are 
compressed with a normal amount of 
weight and the driveshaft is at the 
proper angle. Gra b the shaft near

then twist it hard back and forth. Any

Brutal R&R 
Odds are, you'll need to raise the 
vehicle off the ground (unless you're 
dri ving a giant-wheeled 4x4 ). Ramps 
are great fo r this, but a fl oor jack and 
a pair of jackstands will do the job 
fine . To replace a U-joint, unscrew the 
nuts of the U-bolts th at clamp the uni-
versal's cups to the rea r axle's yoke. 
Mark the parts so th at you can put 
them back the way they were. Using a

Wh ile a hydraulic press is ideal for 
driving the cups out of the yoke ears, 
you might be able to manage with a

husky bench vise. Or, you can drive 
the cups o ut with a drift and a heavy 
hammer. If these are the originals, 
they're probably retained by injected 
nylon, which will simply be destroyed 
in the process. Another option is to 
see if there are C-clips in grooves in 
the inner or outer sides of the ears. 
The inner type can be forced out eas-
ily with a screwdriver and hammer,

Next, give the shaft a

clean-in high gear, it 
rotates at the same speed 
as the engine, so a lump 
of undercoating would be enough to 
give a car the shakes-then look for 
evidence of a thrown balance weight. 
Also, see if it's bent. 
H you still haven't found the trou-

rotate it 180°, bolt it back up, and

4. Shut the engine down and install 
two worm-gear hose clamps around 
the shaft with their heads 180' from 
the mark you just made. 
5. Rev it up to 65 to 70 mph and see 
if the vibrati on has disappeared. If it 
has, give it a road test to be sure. If it 
hasn't, rotate the clamp heads about 
45' away from each other and try

moving the clamp heads apart until 
you get it right. 
As you probably know, the basic 
function of a U-joint is to allow two 
shafts to operate at an angle to each 
other. But you may not realize that 
while the driving yoke rotates at a con-
stant speed, the driven one speeds up 
and slows down twice during each rev-
olution. At an angle of 4', the variation 
in speed is a negligible 0.5 percent. At 
10', however, the change is 3 percent, 
and at 30' with the yoke going 1000 
rpm, its partner goes from 866 to 1155 
rpm each quarter of a revolution. You 
can imagine the surging vibration such 
an arrangement would set up. 
Fortunately, this condition is elimi-
nated by the use of two joints with 
the driving yokes rotated 90' from 
each other. As long as the angle of 
each joint is about the same, the 
acceleration and decelera ti on of one is 
ca nceled out by the deceleration and 
acceleration of the other, and a 
smooth transmission of power is 
accomplished. ~

aga inst the center of the steeri ng wheel 
to audi bly signal your displeasure with 
the hackie's driving, personal hygiene 
and relationship with his mother. 
But your horn doesn't blow. A sound 
more akin to the utterings of a dyspep-
tic goat emanates from your grille for a 
few seconds-then silence. Your horn is 
broken. The moment is gone. And your 
mood sours even further. 
This Has Got to Stop 
Actually, blowing your horn as a sign 
of sheer displeasure is totall y inappro-

behind the grille and in front of the

despite any message you might have 
deli vered. Some municipalities pro-
hibit blowing a horn within the city 
lim its unless there's a traffic situation 
that genui nely requ ires it-
if not, you 
may get a ticket. But horns do have 
more purpose than letting your 
teenage son signa l to his date that he's 
wa iting in the driveway. A brief tootle

the attention of that soccer mom dri-
ving a 7000-pound SUV w hi le ta lking 
on her cell phone and looking in the 
rearview mirror at her w hining kids. 
(Fig. 2) See the panel cover or manual 
to know which fuse protects the horn's 
circuits. If the S-strip is broken (fuse at 
right ), replace the fuse. 
The horn is required eq uipment by 
law-you'll need to get it fixed or you 
may not be able to pass inspection. A 
zealous police officer may even find it 
ap propriate to write yo u a citation if 
your horn isn 't functioning properl y. 
Less-Than-Adequate Honking 
In our scenario, the horn blew for a 
few seconds at reduced volu me. T his 
mea ns that the circuitry that feeds the 
horn with 12 volts is ali ve and well. 
Most vehicle actu all y have two 
horns, wired to sound at the same 
time. T hey usuall y will be of a differ-
ent pitch, sound ing a chord instead of 
a single note. Some lux ury cars use 
th ree ho rns for a more complex, 
melodious sound. T he horns gener-

vehicle's grille (Fig. 1). A cursory 
rooting aro und in the engine C0 111 -

If one or more horns are inopera-

o bvious reasons.) Sound vibra ti ons? 
Remove the wiri ng connector, clea n 
up the spade lugs and then reinstall 
the connector. Still nothing? If the 
horn has only one wire runni ng to it, 
it relies on its mounting bolt to com-
plete the circu it to ground . Unbolt the 
horn, clea n up any corrosion and

If there's sti ll no sound, make sure 
that a bad horn is indeed the problem 
by running a jumper wire directl y to 
the battery terminals. If one horn is 
defunct, replace it. Generall y, the 
horn will have an imprint or a sticker 
identifying it as a High or Low tone. 
To preserve the OEM horn character, 
you'll need an exact replacement. 
This will ensure that the horn 's fre-

Not so much as a squea k from either

Now's the time to check the fuse,

kick panel or under th e hood-or

If the fuse is bad, odds are you've

The Fuse Passed Inspection 
Now you'll need a 12-volt test light 
or a voltmeter. You also should fi nd a 
shop manual or, at the very least, a 
schematic diagram of the horn circuit. 
Start by testing for 12 vo lts at the 
connector to the horn (Fig. 3). O ne 
side of the circuit is carried by the ca r's 
metal frame, so you'll need to check 
between a good ground point and the 
wiring connector for the horn. If 
there's no voltage at the connector, try 
checking the horn relay (Fig. 4). 
_J 
161 

T he horn relay switches a large 
current ro the horns at a signal from 
the low-current horn burron in the 
steering wheel (Fig. 5). It's a sim ple, 
inexpensive single-pole single-throw 
(SPST) relay, packaged in a small 
metal or plastic box with five spade-
lug connectors. If you're un lucky, 
your vehicle uses a relay that's inte-
gra ted in ro a larger box of sparks that 
also controls several other functions 
on your car, such as the headlights or 
the turn signals. This part is consider-
ably more expensive. Sorry. Consult 
the shop manual for the location of 
the relay, as it, like th e fuse box, may 
be hidden almost anyw here under-
hood or under the dash-and not nec-
essaril y nea r the fuse box. A simple 
SPST relay will have a constant sup-
ply of 12 volts to it, a lead that runs 
through the harness ro the horn, 
another lead that runs to the horn 
switch in the wheel, and a grou nd. 
Check that voltage is coming into the 
relay at two terminals and leaving it 
at two oth er term inals when the 
switch is pushed. [f it's not, try 
ground ing the lead that goes to the 
horn butron to make the rela y pull in. 
If the horn sounds, the relay is good 
but the horn button or its wiring is 
bad. You may be able to simply 
replace rhe relay if it's the problem. 
Otherwise, you'll need to do some 
serious detecti ve work to chase down 
the open circuit. 
Button, Button, 
Who's Got The Button? 
If yo u have a "panic" button on your

it sounds the horn, but the horn does-
n't work w hen you press the button, 
the problem is in the horn button or 
its wiring to the relay. Every late-

t's a light drizzle-barely enough 
to wet the windshield. So you press 
the washer button and turn on the 
wipers. There's nothing- or maybe 
just a weak squirt-out of the washer 
nozzles, and the wipers quickly slow 
down and just streak the windshield 
to cover up whatever clear areas there 
had been. Traffic becomes a blur, and 
you're forced to slow down, pick your 
way through a slalom of cars and 
trucks to a side street, and just shake 
for a few moments until you have the 
presence of mind to get out and clean 
the window by hand. 
Where's the Liquid? 
You just filled the reservoir last week 
and haven't used the was hers since. 
So th e reservoir should ha ve plenty of 
fluid, right? It was a washer anti-
freeze solution? Okay, is the reservoir 
still full? It's empty? There must be a 
leak. Even if that solution conta ins a 
dye, yo u still are likely to have a 
tough time finding a cracked seam in 
the reservoir, particularly if the reser-
voir is under the battery or in a 
fender well, the late-model location 
of choice for space-deprived power-
train compartment engineers. 
Fill the reservoir and run your fin-
gers along any seam, and also around 
the pump seal, which may be a simple 
rubber grommet. [f you're losing fluid 
at a noticeable rate, you should be 
able to find a wet spot pretty fast. If 
it's a seam, empty the reservoir, dry 
the exterior and apply a bead of wind-
shield sealer or epoxy. If it's the pump 
grommet, pull the pump out (just 
work it side-to-side or up-and-down 
with an outward tugging motion). 
Replacement grommets are not neces-
sarily easy to buy, so if you can't get 
one, it's worth tryi ng to apply beads of 
RTV silicone sealer around the pump 
opening in the reservoir and around 
the barbs of the pump. Allow ade-
quate time for the RTV silicone to 
"skin" (partly cure) so it doesn't 
extrude out of position when you rein-
sta ll the grommet and pump. 
The reservoir is full? Next ques-
tion: Is the pump working? Have a 
helper press the washer button wh ile 
you listen at the pump. If you hear it 
working, disconnect a hose that runs 
from the pump, aim it into a container 
and repeat the test. If there's a solid 
stream, repeat the test at the hose con-
nection to a spray nozzle. If a car has

two nozzles, it's unlikely that both 
nozzles would plug up simultaneously, 
but it is possible that the hose from 
the reservoir is kinked, that a check 
valve (installed in some lines) has 
closed up or an inline filter is plugged. 
So if you get a solid stream from the 
pump, but nothing at a hose connec-
tion, work your way back to the 
pump. If all you can find is a check 
valve or an inline filter, remove it and 
make a temporary splice with a plastic 
hose connector. You may find the 
washer system operates well enough 
to make that your permanent repair. 
If the pump isn't working, either it 
has failed or there's a break in the cir-
cuit leading to it. Unplug the wiring 
connector and again have your helper 
press the washer button while you 
probe the terminals with a grounded 
12-volt test light. It should go on with 
the probe in one of the two terminals, 
and when you identify that one (the 
current feed), try to jump across the 
two terminals with the test light. Aga in 
it should go on. If you can't get the 
light to go on in the first test, there's a 
break in the current-feed side of the cir-
cuit from the washer button, and you'll 
have to trace it from there. If you can't 
get the test light to go on when you 
jump across the two terminals of the 
connector, there's a bad ground. 
The connector passes both tests? 
The pump is the problem. On most 
late models, you ca n just pull it out 
(the rubber grommet may come out 
with it). 
On many older ca rs, where little 
more than the end of the pump sticks 
o ut, look for a serrated retainer you 
can pry out with a thin-blade screw-
dri ver. Then pull the pump itself with 
slip-joint pliers on an edge of the 
electrical terminal (Fig. 1).

EASY 
Curing Radio Noise 
Y
ou're looking forward to the 
chance to listen to the ball-
game, having just dropped your 
purple-haired teenage daughter off at 
her first semester at college. A lot of 
ba llgames, actually, now that you 
don't have to listen to her head banger 
music, with its shrieking vocals and 
droning guitars. But instead of the 
first inning, you hear what sounds 
like some awful guitar note-and it 
changes pitch as you speed up and 
slow down, turn ing to a man iaca l 
rhythmic clicking as you wait for a 
traffic light to change. There's no tape 
in the player. W hat you have here is 
rad io frequency interference (RFI). 
Finding the Source 
There are three classes of RF noise-
constant, intermittent and engine-
speed following. Our hapless father's 
problem was in the last category-
his noise varied up and down in 
pitch and volume as his engine sped 
up and slowed down. T his type of 
noise is caused by something that 
varies its speed with the engine. 
Likely culprits include the ignition, 
the alternator or even a fuel injector. 
Constant-speed noises are usual ly 
caused by an electric motor-most 
likely the electric fuel pump fo und in 
the tank of most modern vehicles 
which runs at a constant speed any-
time the engine is running. An elec-
tric fan motor w ill also run at a con-
stant speed-until yo u change the 
fa n setting or turn it off. Intermittent 
noises are easier to associate with a 
source, such as an electric seat 
adjuster or a power-window motor. 
In other words, even though the 
noise comes from a radio speaker, it 
may be caused by any manner of 
device anywhere on your vehicle. 
Constants 
The one motor that's guaranteed to be 
on whenever the car is running is the 
fuel pump's, and unfortunately it's 
usually buried inside the fuel tank. 
(Fig. 1) A cheap AM radio makes a 
good Geiger counter-style device for 
hunting down RFI. Here, we're looking 
for an alternator with a bad diode. Mind 
your fingers. 
H ere's one sure way to tell. Turn the 
key to the Run position without start-
ing the car. The pump should run for 
2 or 3 seconds. Then, when the 
computer senses that the engine isn't 
running, it will shut off the pump to 
prevent spill ing fuel and dra ining the 
battery. Other almost-constants are 
heater fans, w ipers and electric 
radiator-cooling fa ns. 
Engine-Speed Noises 
Candidates here include the alterna-
tor/voltage regulator, a fau lty fuel 
injector and the ignition system. 
Geiger-Counter Test 
Here's our favorite low-tech tool for 
hunting down and ki lling wild 
noises- a cheap AM rad io (Fig. 1). 
Tune it to an empty channel around 
1400 kHz, crank up the volume in 
your headset, and use the radio to 
sniff out the noise. These cheapo 
radios use a ferrite-bar antenna that 
has good reception along its side, but 
poor reception along its length. Once

you find th e noise within a few fee t, 
turn the radio 90' to minimize the 
noise. The top of the radi o will point 
at the source like a gunsight. 
Making Sure 
Find some way of disconnecting the 
source of the RFI and check to see if 
the noise ceases. This will be difficult 
in the case of the fu el pump or igni-
tion, but you can pull the belt off the 
alternator. (Don't disconnect the 
alternator electrica lly-the back EMF 
[voltage] may smoke the di odes.) If 
you think it's a fuel injector, try dis-
connecting it from the harness. 
Plugged Up 
Virtually all cars today use resistor-
type plug cables if they use spark 
pi ug wires at all. If your vehicle is 
more than a few yea rs old, degraded 
ca bles may be the so urce of the prob-
lem. Remove and replace the ca bles 
one at a time, clean them of grease 
and dirt with mild detergent, and 
check the connections to the ends. 
Now get out your ohmmeter and 
measure the cables' resistance along 
their length-they sho uld measure 
approximately 10,000 ohms per foot. 
Resistance in the megohms or single 
digits ma y well be the source of not 
only your RFI, but a nagging misfire. 
Replace any suspect wires with fac-
tory or high-quality aftermarket 
wires. Check the plugs, coil and any 
CURING RADIO NOISE 
distributor fo r evidence of carbon 
tracking or a rcing as well (Fig. 2). 
Intermittents 
These noises are easy to associate 
with the source. Any RFI that sounds 
onl y when one window is going up or 
down will be easy to blame on the 
wi ndow motor. 
Which Way Home? 
Now that yo u've pinpointed the 
noise, what can be done abo ut it? It 
depends on whether yo ur RFI source 
is broadcasting or ca bling the noise 
to your radi o. T his matters beca use 
the cure is di fferent. Try pulling your 
radi o's antenna lead o ut. If the noise 
goes away or is substantially q uieter, 
it's coming in through the antenna. If 
the noise stays the same or gets 
lo uder, it's coming in a long the 12-
vo lt power ca bles. 
Try removing the antenna fro m the 
fender and cleaning the fender sheet-
metal and the antenna mount. Clean 
down to the shiny metal, using sandpa-
per to remove any corrosion (Fig. 3). 
Smear the area lightly with Vaseline 
and reattach. This will provide a 
proper ground at the antenna. Be sure 
the radio chassis is properl y grounded 
to the car body (Fig. 4). Aftermarket 
installations are more likely to have a 
radio that's grounded onl y by the 
shield in the antenna co-ax. A simple 
wire added between tbe component's 
(Fig. 4) Check grounding 
points by loosening, clean-
ing and tightening. 
metal case and the car's 
sheetmetal will often elimi-
nate any RFI. 
There are two wa ys to 
reduce noise: by using an 
inductance in a power 
ca ble to keep the bigh-
frequency noise from 
traveling, or by using a 
capacitor to shunt it off 
to ground harmlessly. 
Sometimes both ploys a re 
necessary. In fact, most of 
the electrica l motors in 
your ve hicle use some 
sort of capacitor for noise suppres-
sion. Any good car stereo shop or 
Radio Shack will have the parts yo u 
need. The noise filter we show below 
is one example (Fig. 5). It has a large 
inductance in series wi th the 12-volt 
power ca ble to a buzzing aftermarket 
stereo, as well as a co uple of small 
ca pacitors in para llel. T he inductance 
prevents noise fro m entering the 
amplifier through the power leads, 
and the capacitors bypass any left-
over nOise. 
Electric motors, as we mentioned, 
often have a capacitor in parallel 
with the armature fo r the purpose of 
reducing RFI. If the motor's brushes 
are worn and sparking, the noise may 
overpower the capacitor's filtering. 
Most automotive electric motors are 
not servicea ble, and they'll have to be

both power and ground connections.

replaced if a simple filter doesn't 
qui et them. 
As we said earl ier, fuel pumps are 
difficu lt to get to-in most modern 
cars they are mounted inside the fuel 
tank. To access the pump, or even the 
wiring that connects to the pump, it's 
necessary to drop the tank out from 
under the car, which is a lengthy, 
messy and potentially dangerous job. 
Be careful if you attempt to add a fil-
ter to the external tank wiring, as the 
filter itself is large and bulky. You'll 
need to securely mount it to the top of 
the tank to keep it from brea king 
loose over potholes and bumps. 
Soldering 
One of the most common so urces of 
RFI is poor connections. If you find a 
poor, corroded connection or a loose 
electrical joint, don't just crimp the 
connector tighter onto the wire. 
168 
Remove the connector and clea n the 
wire. It may be necessary to trim the 
wire back a few inches to get past any 
corrosion inside the insulation. 
There's onl y one acceptable technique 
for splicing wires if you're having RFI 
issues-
and the common automotive-
style crimp connector isn't it. Yo u'll 
need a good, clean, high-wa ttage sol-
dering pencil or gun, rosin-core 60-40 
solder and PVC shrink tube. 
Start by using proper, stranded 
autoilloti ve-grade wire. Unstranded 
househo ld wire will fracture and 
eventuall y brea k. Start with wire of 
at least the same diameter as the wire 
you're ad ding to. If you're adding a 
power ca ble, a ground connection or 
a filter, use 12-ga . wire for ultra low 
resistance. Strip and pre-tin both 
wires to allow you to twist them 
together for a sound mechanical con-
nection. Slip a length of PVC shrink 
tube over one wire, twist together, 
and solde r. Use enough hea t and a 
sparing amount of solder to make a 
shin y, wet-looking solder joint. Allow 
the joint to cool without disturbing 
it. This will prevent the liquid solder 
fro m crystallizing as it cools. 
Cover the joint with the PVC tub-
ing and shrin k the tubing with a hea t 
gun, or ca refull y with your lighter if 
you must. If the solder joint you're 
making will be exposed to the ele-
ments, use shrin k tube that has water-
proofin g adhesive inside it to keep 
corrosion from creeping into your 
fresh joint. Silicone seal or liquid elec-
trica l tape is a good alternati ve. 
Dress any new wires carefully to 
prevent chafing on corners. Support 
any components you've added. 
Remember that even a foot or two of 
heavy-ga uge wire can flex itself to the 
breaking point if it's unsupported. ~

Servicing Composite Headlamps

t'S your first chance in months to 
get out of Dodge. It'll be great to 
pack up some cold ones, a couple 
of fishing rods and some o ld clothes 
and escape to the country for a day or 
two. But as you leave the mercury-
vapor-illuminated metroplex, you 
realize what you forgot-carrots, lots 
and lots of carrots, because yo u can 
barely see the road in front of you 
in the starlight of the countryside. 
Relax, it's not your fai ling eyesight. 
It's a burned-out head lamp. 
Older Ways 
For generations, American ca rs, and 
any car sold in the United States, had 
the same kind of headlight-
a sealed-
beam, either in a single or a quad 
arrangement. T his fragil e blown-glass 
envelope was filled with an inert gas 
and worked pretty well until it 
burned out. It had only modest per-
form ance, but the Department of 
Transportation mandated its use. 
Most modern cars use what's called 
a composite headlamp-a plastic reflec-
(Fig. 2) Many modern head lamp assem-
blies have a bubble level to assist in 
aiming the light beam. You'll still need 
a marked wall to see the beam pattern.

quartz-halogen design. The "glass" 
bulb is actually made of silica quartz, 
which is highly resistant to heat. T he 
filament is engineered to run at a much 
higher temperature, producing more 
light and heat. The silica envelope is 
filled with a mixture of halogen gases 
(iodine or bromine) to scavenge evapo-
rated tungsten filament from the inside 
of the quartz, keeping each bulb's 
brightness constant until it fails.

bulbs are always packaged in a bag or 
sleeve. This is to prevent the oils on 
your fingers from contacting the quartz. 
Temperatures at the surface of the bulb 
are high enough-several hundred 
degrees-that the oils will carbonize 
onto the surface, creating a loca lized 
hot spot. This hot spot will overstress 
the silica, resulting in a crack that lets 
air into the bulb, blowing the filament 
out within minutes. Never allow your 
fingers, or anything that isn't squeaky 
clean and dry, to touch the bulb (Fig. 1). 
If you do, clean the bulb with alcohol 
and a clean cloth. The easiest way to 
avoid problems is to leave the protective 
sleeve on until the bulb is in the socket 
and ready to reinstall. When reinstalling

High IntenSity Discharge Lighting 
170 
Some high-end vehicles are available with an 
extremely bright, tightly focused type of lighting known 
as High Intensity Discharge (HID). Unlike conventional 
lighting, there is no filament to burn out, as the light is 
generated by incandescent gases in a quartz tube. 
How hot is it? Hot enough to create a plasma of the 
molecules by stripping the electrons away from their 
nuclei. This requires, at least initially, nearly 20,000 
volts to discharge across electrodes in the bulb. The 
plasma envelope's shape is easier to focus than a 
springy tungsten wire, so less stray light goes into 
oncoming traffic's windshields and more, far more, 
goes onto the verge of the roadway. There's nothing to 
burn out, so the lamp should outlast the vehicle. After-
market retrofit kits are available to upgrade your vehi-
cle. We've installed a Xenarc low-beam kit from Sylva-
nia on one of our vehicles, and it has given us a new 
appreciation for the number of deer browsing near the 
side of the road at night.

of lights is far more critical than conventional lamps,

EASY 
Servicing Electronic Suspensions 
Y
OU and your Corvette have 
been terrorizing the same back 
road on the way home for 
months. A warning lamp that says 
SERVICE RIDE CONTROL winks at you 
from the dash. No problem, you 
say-I'll take it to the dealer for ser-
vice next week. 
That sensuous, sweeping switch-
back turn is disappearing- rapidly, 
very rapidly-under your front tires. 
You've been through this turn a 
hundred times before, but this time 
something is different. A small 
pothole suddenly makes your outside 
front tire start to skitter across the 
asphalt as you mow down a solid 
hundred feet of weeds between 
the verge and the ditch before regain-
ing control. 
Suddenly the need to see the dealer 
has become much more urgent. Then 
the dealer says it may cost as much as 
(gulp! ) two grand to fix. Time for the 
Saturday mechanic to get busy. 
Finding the Problem 
Consider the fact that the warning 
light mysteriously came on after the 
car was jostled around on some 
broken pavement. That means 
there's a good chance you're dealing 
with just a bad electrical connection. 
Or maybe one of the Bilstein shock 
absorbers was severely worn and just 
needed that last pounding to jam the 
adjustment mechanism. In retro-
spect, the right front corner has felt a 
bit mushy lately, hasn't it? Luckily 
the Selective Ride Control (SRC) 
system in the Corvette is one of 
the simplest setups, if not the sim-
plest, of its kind. OE replacement 
parts aren't cheap (the shocks cost 
about $300 apiece), but at least you 
don't have to pay labor when doing 
the job yourself.

can't be converted to a conventional

Check the Basics First 
Roughly half of all the mainstream 
carmakers offer some type of elec-
tronic suspension system on some 
models. In general, they all make 
computer-controlled adjustments on 
response to one or more of the fol-
lowing inputs: road conditions, vehi-
cle speed and weight/load, brake

app licati on, steering-wheel angle, 
power-steering pressure, throttle posi-
tion, lateral/longitudinal accelerati on 
and the position of a dash- or con-
sole-mounted dri ver-selectable switch. 
But don't let this list overwhelm 
you. The key to any modern autolllo-
ti ve system is to keep it simple and 
check the basics first, then move on. 
One prerequisite fo r work ing on 
almost any modern car is adequa te 
documentati on. Beg, borrow or steal 
the manual for your ca r, which may 
involve ordering it fro m the dea ler. 
Without some sort of manual, you'll 
be guessing, and proba bly not onl y 
won't be able to make the repair but 
you might inadvertently damage some 
pretty expensive parts. 
In the case of your Corvette, there 
should be at least one tro uble code 
stored in the computer. 50 you would 
jump right to "Corvette di agnostics" 
on the page ISS, beca use it would 
probably lead you to the problem a 
lot faster. 
If the computer hadn't turned on the 
warning message but you felt something 
wrong with the suspension (or you 
don't have the self-diagnostic informa-
tion for the system you're dealing with), 
you would start by taking a close look 
at the adjustable shocks for some signs 
of oil leakage as if dealing with plain 01' 
shocks. If you see any stains or drips,

hydraulic or both. N o matter how com-
plex the system is, the damping portion 
of the shock/strut is still filled with 
hydraulic oil and needs to be sealed. 
Next, do a visual inspection for any 
airlfl uid lines that have burst and for 
damaged or misadjusted height sen-
sors on those setups that use them. 
Look around for any obvious harness 
connector trouble and check the 
shock/strut actuators and their con-
nectors (Fig. 2). If you hear the air 
compressor running constantly, it usu-
all y means a height sensor is out of 
whack, there's a small air leak or a 
relay is stuck in the ON position. If the 
compressor never turns on, you can 
suspect a bum height sensor, a stuck-

open relay, a clogged air bleed-off 
valve, a blown fuse or even the com-
pressor itself. 
Ford issued a technical service bul-
letin on this exact subject back in the 
mid-90s. It seems that on 1990-93 
Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis and 
Town Car models, the rear air suspen-
sion may not pum p up when loaded 
because the air-supply line at the Y 
connector nea r the No.4 crossmem-
ber tends to rub on the underside of 
the car body. The constant rubbing 
eventually wears through the line and 
creates a lea k. An improved air line 
with a protecti ve shield was issued to 
remedy the problem. The OE part 
numbers are F2AZ-5A897-B (Crown 
Vic/Grand Ma rq uis) and F2VY-
5A897-A (Town Car). 
Corvette Nitty-Gritty 
Understanding how the 5RC system 
works will help to diagnose and fix it 
and will make oth er setups easier to 
comprehend . 5RC consists of fo ur 
ad justable gas-charged shocks, an 
actuator motor on top of each shock 
and a computer to dri ve the actuators. 
5RC can adjust the damping rate 
only-the ride height never changes. 
Inputs to the computer include a 3-
position dri ver-selecta ble switch, the 
vehicle speed sensor and signals from 
each actuator's H all-effect position 
sensor. Based on the car's speed and 
where the driver has the switch, the 
computer powers the actuator motors 
so that they rotate a certain number 
of degrees. Every time the key is 
turned on, the computer rotates the 
actuators back to the 0° stop. 
Inside the conventional-looking 
shock shaft is a thin rod, ca lled the 
damping rod. It extends fro m the 
top of the shaft down to the piston. 
On top of the damping rod is a gear. 
When the actuator is mounted, its 
gea r fits over the gea r on the rod, 
which enables the actuator to rotate 
the rod up to 160
0 inside the larger 
shaft. Beca use the bottom of the rod 
is beveled, as it turns clockwise it 
gradually closes off the bypass 
orifice machined in the side of the 
larger shaft. T he sma ller the orifice

gets, the stiffer the shock gets. 
Mechanically it's simple. As long as 
the electronics don't screw up, only 
normal wear should affect the system. 
Other electronic dampers work in 
basically the same way but they vary 
in design. For instance, the Continen-
tal's air struts use a shutter-type mech-
anism with different size orifices to 
vary the oil flow. 
174 
Replacing the Shocks 
If you find a leaker or one shock that's 
clearly worn out, replacing it is about 
as straightforward as any conven-
tional shock. Start by loosening the 
lug nuts of the wheel that has to come 
off and jack up the appropriate end. 
Remove the wheel. (On some air sys-
tems, such as the Lincoln Town Car 
and Mark series cars, you must flip

off the air suspension switch in the 
trunk before jacking up the vehicle-
don't say we didn't warn you (Fig. 3). 
Next, pull the actuator's locking clip 
ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS 

and pull the actuator straight up off 
the shock to expose the damping rod's 
little gear. Lay the actuator gently on 
a frame rail if possible. Don't let it 
hang on the harness. If there's no 
place to set the actuator down, either 
tie it out of the way or pull its connec-
tor from the main wiring harness and 
remove the actuator and its harness 
completely. 
Now, you just need to remove the 
upper and lower mounting bolts and 
pull the shock. You may need to 
pump up like Arnold Schwarzenegger 
for a few seconds to compress the stiff 
gas shock enough to slip it out 
between the control arms. The same 
goes for slipping the new unit through 
the arms into place. Be careful not to 
damage the new damping rod gear. 
The actuator must remesh smoothly 
with the new gear. Anything that pre-
vents the actuator from doing its job 
will set a trouble code in the com-
puter (Fig. 4). 
Actuator Precautions 
Don't hit the Corvette's actuator with 
anything during installation-press it 
on gently by hand. Never whale on 
the upper retaining nut with an 
impact gun or you'll jam the damping 
rod. The nut must be torqued to 33 
ft.-lb. Hold things steady with a 
wrench on the flats of the retainer 
insulator while tightening the nut. 
Make sure there's a good mesh 
between the damping rod gear and 
the actuator gear, and a good fit for 
the locking clip (Fig. 5). 
Once mounted, make sure the actu-
ator harness pigtail points directly 
rearward for a front shock and directly 
forward for a rear shock. This 
prevents the harnesses from rub-
bing against the fender splash 
shields and frame rails. 
The actuators on other elec-
tronic shocks/struts are usually 
held in place by two screws, so 
they can be installed in only one 
position. This means the com-
puter doesn't need to take a zero 
reading with each key cycle. 
There's no way to install an 
SRC shock backward because 
the actuator position sensor 
keeps tabs on the damping rod 
angle. However, this doesn't 
necessarily apply to all elec-
tronic suspensions. Be sure to 
check the manual for the latest 
information. 
Fig. 5. Actuator must align with top of damp-
ing rod to maintain proper soft/hard positions. 
Corvette Diagnostics 
Remember that SERVICE RIDE COp-.1TROL 
warning? When it's on, it means the sys-
tem is in a fail-safe mode and the com-
puter has locked all the actuators in the 
60° position until the problem is fixed. 
With the car stopped and the ignition 
on, jump terminals A and B (1989 only) 
or A and C (later models) of the ALDL 
(assembly line diagnostic link) located 
under the knee bolster with a paper clip 
or a piece of jumper wire to make the 
SERVICE RIDE CONTROL warning message 
flash out 2-digit codes. There are 13 
possible codes that can be spit out, but 
you'll need a service manual to decipher 
them and to do the proper tests. 
Four things can prevent the 
warning light from flashing codes or 
from coming on with the key for a 
bulb check: a burned-out bulb, a 
blown fuse, a bad harness connection 
at the computer or a bad computer. 
The electronic brain for this system is 
found in the bin behind the driver's 
seat in the Corvette. In other cars, it's 
usually mounted behind the rear seat 
in the trunk area. Only two problems 
won't set codes in the SRC system: a 
leaking or worn shock and system 
voltage out of the 10- to 16-volt range. 
To clear codes after the repair has been 
completed, jump ALDL terminals A 
and B (1989) or A and C (later models) 
three times 2 seconds each. 
The Real Time Damping sys-
tem on late-model Corvettes (mid-
late 1990s) also permits on-board 
trouble code diagnostics without a 
scan tool, through the Central Con-
trol Module. Codes are displayed on 
the Driver Information Center. Refer

DIFFICULT 
Fixing Power Windows 
A
nother toll-booth, another 
mile-or at least it seems as if 
the tollbooths come every mile 
on this road, with a half mile of traffic 
idling its leisurely way up to the token 
monster. Within an arm's length of 
the bin, you toggle the power window 
switch with one hand while the other 
hand fingers a token, preparing to 
whip it into the basket just as you 
floor the throttle. All goes as 
planned-except the window doesn't 
move, the token bounces back into 
your face, and you ha ve to jam on the 
brakes, crack the door and pitch a 
second token backhanded to keep 
from getting a ticket as a toll evader, 
all to the tune of horns blaring from 
the cars behind you. 
Fortunately, power windows 
are usually one of the more reliable 
systems on a late-model car. And 
diagnosis and repair are usually pretty 
straightforward. 
What's Up? 
The most coml11on power window 
mechanism is pretty basic. There's a 
simple regulator mechanism, usually 
similar to the mechanism used on gar-
den-variety hand-cranked windows. It 
comes in several varieties-rack, sec-
tor and cable drive. Troubleshooting is 
pretty straightforward, once you get 
the door panels off-but your prob-
lem may be terribly simple and may 
not require removing any trim at all. 
First: Are all of the windows on the

probe the window 
switches to isolate any 
electrical faults in the 
switches, connectors or 
wiring. 
fritz? Or just one? If you 
can't move any of the 
windows, the first place 
to look is at the fuse. 
Window regulators are 
high-current devices, and 
the fuse is sized to just 
barely be able to open all 
four windows together. 
Age and a few sticky 
window channels can 
pop a fuse. 
Turn the key to the 
Run position, but don't 
start the car. If the fuse is 
blown, pushing a win-
dow button will do noth-
ing at all: The motor 
won't groan and the glass 
won't quiver. If the fuse is 
good and you can hear 
the motor, or the glass 
acts like it wants to 
move, then you've got 
some sort of mechanical problem. If 
not, check the fuse. If the fuse box isn't 
labeled, check the owner's manual to 
see which fuse is the culprit. Don't go 
yanking fuses willy-nilly looking for a 
bad one-you might interrupt the 
power to the engine management com-
puter, causing poor driveability for 30 
minutes or so-or you might reset all 
the buttons on your car radio to that 
undersea-alien rock-gospel station. 
Fuse okay, but the window still 
won't budge? Again, are a ll the 
windows dormant? Or just one? If 
it's just one, you still may get an 
opportunity to go spelunking inside 
the door. If it's all four, maybe it's 
something simpler you can trou-
bleshoot under the dash. 
176 
ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS 

At this point, if you've narrowed 
the fault down to some electrical 
problem that's not as simple as a 
blown fuse you need to round up a 
schematic of your car's electrical sys-
tem and a voltmeter or 12v test light. 
All that's necessary now is to start at 
the fuse panel and follow the wiring 
to the switch, and from there move on 
to the motor, testing along the way 
for 12 volts. Somewhere, you'll find a 
loose or corroded connector inter-
rupting the voltage to the motor. Or, 
the switch itself might be bad. If the 
driver's door switch won't open the 
right rear door, but the switch in the 
door will, look for either a bad switch 
in the driver's door or a fault in the 
intervening wiring. 
Open Sesame 
At this point, you probably need to 
be able to access the inside of the 
switch panel. On some vehicles, like 
the one in our lead illustration, yo u 
can simply pry the panel up with 
your fingers and backprobe the con-
nectors (Fig. 1). Other vehicles may 
require that you remove the panel. 
Door panels are held on with a 
bewildering variety of fasteners. Start

bad motor, or you may need the entire 
mechanism. 
by pulling off all of the door pulls and 
handles. The perimeter of the panel is 
customarily held on fragile plastic 
studs intended for one-time use. Pry 
them up carefully, and you should be 
able to reuse them. 
Once you've got the door panel 
off, carefully remove the weather 
sheeting. You'll need to replace 
this later, and you may need fresh 
contact cement to do so. 
Warning: You now have the ability 
HOW IT WORKS 
Automatic Windows 
Some late-model high-end cars 
have frameless windows that 
automatically crank themselves 
open a quarter-inch or so as the 
doors are opened. It happens so 
fast that you may not notice it. The 
window opens rapidly, clearing the 
seal before the door latch clears. 
It then closes automatically about 
a second after the door latch 
latches. There are two advantages 
to this. First, the slightly open win-
dow vents interior air, which can 
actually make doors on tightly 
sealed cars hard to open by spring-
ing the door back open against air 
pressure. It also lets the manufac-
turer use a vastly different style of 
seal on the top of the window. The 
FIXING POWER WINDOWS 
seal can more closely resemble a 
sedan door seal, with a small lip 
protruding over the top of the glass. 
This type of seal won't work on 
frameless windows because the 
glass has to clear the seal as it 
opens and closes. This type of 
seal allows less water and noise 
intrusion. A similar automatic sys-
tem is used on those high-end 
convertibles with fully automatic 
tops, to provide clearance for the 
moving parts of the top. The down-
side with any automatic window 
system is with the logic control 
module needed to achieve this. 
Repairs will probably need a factory 
shop manual and, potentially, 
some expensive parts. 
to put your fingers into places where 
fingers normally don't go. As our 
mechanic pal Lefty points out, "A 
power window motor has enough 
torque to put a serious hurtin' on ya 
if it's actuated while errant digits are 
in the gears." 
Proof Positive 
As an absolute proof that the problem 
is electrical, try running a jumper wire 
direct from the battery positive termi-
nal to the positive side of the motor to 
see if it comes alive. 
Be aware that a few window regu-
lator systems supply 12v constantly, 
and switch the ground side of the cir-
cuit. Check the schematic. Also, most 
vehicles have the ability to lock- and 
deactivate-the rear windows. Check 
this switch if only the rears are balky. 
Occasionally, the true problem is a 
bad motor (Fig. 2). You'll have to 
replace it. Otherwise, you can simply 
trace the wires until you find the 
problem. 
Sticky 
All windows have gaskets and seals to 
keep wind noise and rain out. If the 
window has a slow spot or won't 
open or close properly, check the gas-
kets. A gasket that's misplaced or torn 
can prevent proper operation. If the 
gasket is loose, or even torn, you may 
be able to repair it. If the gasket is 
simply loose, get some 3M Super 
Weatherstrip Adhesive at the auto 
parts store. Clean off the old adhesive 
with lacquer thinner and reglue the 
gasket into place. Allow this to dry 
overnight with the window closed, 
and be certain you're not gluing the 
window to the gasket. 
If the gasket is torn, you might be 
able to use a super glue to simply 
repair the tear. You may be able to 
judiciously trim a loose corner of gas-
ket away with a single-edge razor 
blade. Be particularly careful about 
doing this on the part of the gasket 
that sits outside of the glass, because 
it may admit rain and salt spray to the 
inside of the door in quantities too 
large for the door's internal drainage 
system to cope with.

(Fig. 3) Check the weatherstripping 
and window channel for torn, loose or 
folded rubber parts, or foreign objects 
in the way. 
Replacing a gasket or sea l with a 
new part is genera lly stra ightforwa rd. 
If it's not o bvious th at the gasket is 
astray, inspect the entire gasket and 
channel carefully. Look for damage, 
bur also look fo r such things as pine 
sap, foss ilized Froor Loops or other 
foreign objects that might make the 
window stick or bind. Clean the sur-
face of the gasket and window with 
lacquer thinner to remove oxidized 
rubber and scum (Fig. 3). 
The re's a fair amount of friction 
between the gasket and the w indow 
glass. Almost any misa lignment ca n 
d ra matica ll y increase the fr icti on 
to the point w here the motor no 
longe r has enough torque to move 
the glass properly. 
Lubricate the entire channel with 
silicone spray or protectant, because 
the reduced fricti on just might get 
your window working aga in .

WEATHERSTRIP 
(Fig. 4) Reel and cable window regula-
tors are simple mechanisms, but can 
be fussy about cable routing and may 
snag if jammed. 
It's also possible that the ptoblem is 
deeper inside the door. If so, you'll need 
to pull the door panel and go poking 
atound. Remember to pull the fuse to 
prevent amputating your fi ngers. You 
can use either a rubber wedge doorstop 
or a couple of feet of duct tape to 
anchor the glass up while you work. 
Sometimes the problem is nothing 
more th an a loose bolt allowing the 
door's lI1ner structure to move 
around, misa ligning the window 
tracle Many doors have slotted holes 
for the attachment points for internal 
pa rts, so careful consideration of the 
misa lignment will sometimes let you 
simply slide one adjustment a quarter-
inch or so and straighten it all out. All 
bets are off if the door has been dam-
aged in a crash. It may take a long 
time to get everything working right. 
SECTOR GEAR 
(Fig. 5) Severe misalignment caused by 
loose fasteners can jam gear-type reg-
ulators. 
Lastly, the mechanism that runs 
the window up and down may be 
fau lty. W hether it's a gea r-and-sector, 
scissors lift or cable-operated mecha-
nism (Fig. 4), you'll need to watch it 
moving up and down a few times. 
Aga in, keep your fingers out of the 
works. Sometimes the problem w ill be 
a loose fastener or rivet, sometimes a 
btoken or missing bushing (Fig. 5). 
Cables ca n bind on th e drum or 
become sticky. Lube all the fricti on 
points with white grease. Don't forget 
there are gaskets in the window track 
down below the top of the door, and 
yo u may need to reglue, repair or

If there's anything over 60,000

monl y 100,000 plus, there's a good 
chance that the ca use of this distress-

forcing fuel forward w ith suffic ient 
pressure. Even if the condition hasn't 
reached the point of grounding you, 
pump inadequ acies ca n ca use numer-
ous driveability problems, such as 
momentary cutting out, hesitation, 
low power and sta lling at inoppor-
rune moments (typically, it'll start 
aga in after it's cooled o ff). 
For years, the ca r compa nies have 
been looking fo r a pump life of 
10,000 hours (say, 400K mi les) as a 
bogey. Now, they're ask ing their O .E. 
suppliers fo r " Iife-of-car" (that many 
mil es isn't a car's life span anymore?). 
To reach this goal, pump makers have 
lowered amperage draw and ba lanced 
armatures more precisely. That's all 
very admirable, but ask any service 
technician and he'll tell you that they 
simpl y don't last anywhere nea r that 
long in most cases. What's happening? 
In a word, crud. Many (most? ) of 
the fuel filters replaced are so jammed 
up you can't blow through them (Fig. 
1). If you had checked the pump's 
amperage draw before removing the old 
filter, you might have seen up to twice 
the expected number-perhaps eight to 
10 instead of four to six. It shouldn't 
take much of an intellectual leap to real-
ize that a plugged fuel filter at the outlet 
site will make a pump work harder, and 
all that extra current will wipe out the 
179 

brushes and groove the commu-
tator, killing the pump prema-
turely. Also, the pump's already 
digested whatever's causing the 
restriction. 
While on the subject of 
pump fatalities, another reason 
pumps burn out is because 
immersion in gasoline is neces-
sary for cooling, yet people run 
around on "E." So, try to keep 
your tank at least half full. 
Two-Legged Tripod? 
For a century, mechanics have 
been taught that spark, com-
pression and fuel are the legs 
of the tripod that support an 
engine's ability to run, and that's still 
true. So, before you jump to any 
unfortunate conclusions about your 
fuel pump, do a spark check (a story 
for another day) and make sure the 
camshaft is still connected to the 
crankshaft (remove the oil filler cap 
and watch the cam or rockers while 
you have a helper crank the engine). If 
these two essentials are okay, you can 
start thinking gasoline. 
Turn the key on and listen care-
fully. In most cars, you'll hear the 
pump run for a few seconds. No? 
Then check the fuse. If it's blown, and 
the car starts after you replace it, you 
should still find out how many amps 
it's being forced to carry. If pump 
electrical draw is too high, a fix now 
will head off a future breakdown. 
You'll need either a low-reading 
analog ammeter (Fig. 2) or a DMM

",.", 
(Fig. 2) Find out how many 
amps the pump is drawing 
with a current draw test.

current-carrying capacity. Amperage 
testing is done either by hooking up the 
meter in series with the load, or with an 
inductive pickup that you clamp 
around the wire. The latter works best 
with big current flow, such as you'd 
find in the starter circuit, so we prefer 
the former for diagnosing fuel pumps. 
That means you've got to break 
into the circuit. Connect one of the 
ammeter's leads to the positive battery 
post and the other to the pump's hot 
wire. Look this up in a service manual. 
Ditto for the specs, but we will say that 
if you see anything over 5 amps with a 
low- to mid-pressure system (13 to 45 
psi), or 7 amps with a high-pressure 
version (60 psi) you've got a problem.

lem in the pump relay circuit will set

variety Ford. 
Excluder and PSI 
Have you replaced the fuel 
filter at the recommended 
intervals? How about ever? 
If you've been lax in this 
regard, it's certainly one of 
the first things to check. 
Even if it's not the reason 
the engine won't fire up, it's

critical maintenance that you 
should be doing anyway, so 
you're not wasting your time. 
Important: Filter removal 
will be a lot less dangerous and 
messy if you relieve system 
pressure first. Wrap a rag 
around the Schrader-type valve 
on the fuel rail and press down 
on the valve's pin (Fig. 3). Or, 
remove the fuel pump fuse, 
and crank for 20 seconds. 
Checking fuel pressure is one of the 
basics of troubleshooting, and reason-
ably priced gauges are available. Most 
screw onto the Schrader-type valve, but 
with some imports you'll need a special 
banjo connector or a special fitting. 
Turn the ignition on and read the 
gauge. No or low pressure may mean 
the pump's electrical circuit is faulty. 
This could be because of a defective 
control relay, but check for bad con-
nections before you think about a new 
relay. Examine all the connectors for 
evidence of corrosion or looseness. 
Test for the presence of battery voltage 
at the pump's positive terminal or wire, 
and check for a bad ground as well. 
By the way, an inertia-type safety 
switch in the pump's circuit, as found 
on many Fords, can be tripped by a 
minor impact, such as bumping into a 
snowbank. 
Voltage-drop testing is the best 
way to locate high resistance. With 
the circuit powered up, use an accu-
rate voltmeter to see if you get a read-
ing across connections and lengths of 
wire. Anything more than about 0.2 
volt is too much. 
Other possible causes of too few psi 
to start the car are the already-men-
tioned clogged filter, a pick-up sock in 
the tank that's blocked, a crimped line 
or, of course, a weak pump. 
If key-on/engine-off pressure was 
within specs, use a test light at the 
(Fig. 3) Before you open any connections, relieve system pressure.

Unlike mechanical fuel 
pumps, which are neces-
sarily attached to the

be higher than the 3 to 5 psi a typical mechanical unit 
supplies. Otherwise, you won't get that nicely vaporized 
plume that burns so well. Plenty of fuel has to be flowing 
all the time, too. Only a small percentage of what's 
available is actually used even at full throttle. The rest 
serves to keep those injectors and rails cool as it recir-
culates to the tank. That, plus the location of the pump 
way back in or by the tank, pretty much eliminates vapor 
lock problems. 
With throttle-body fuel injection (also called "wet 
throttle plate"), electric pumps typically put out 15 to 
appropriate injector wire (or, pull an 
injector connector and plug one of 
th ose inex pensive " noid " lights in to 
the harness) . No Aashing? Then the 
injectors aren't firing, which mea ns 
troubleshooting w ill have to gradua te

Pump replacement may be easy or dif-
ficult, depending on the design. O n 
vehicles with in-tank pu mps, access is 
sometimes just a marter of removing a 
sea t, or fo lding back the trunk mat and 
removing a panel. Others require that 
you drop the tank, wh ich can be quite 
a ponderous undertaking, especia lly if 
you've just fi lled up (gasoline weighs 6 
pounds per ga llon). We use the term 
"drop" in a mechanic's sense here-we 
don't rea lly mean to drop it. You can 
siphon it down-dump what you get 
into your other car, or give it to a 
neighbor. If you have a good floor 
jack, put a big sq uare of plywood 
between it and the tank. Remember 
that there's still a certain amount of 
fuel in the tank after you've drained it. 
No smoking, and dry up any spilled 
fuel right away. It'd be a rea lly good 
idea to work outdoors, too. Remember 
that gasoline vapor is heavier than air, 
and will spill down the basement stairs 
until it finds the pilot light for the 
water heater. Poof!

think about work ing on an electric 
fue l pump until yo u've disconnected 
the nega ti ve bartery cable. O n

ASY 
I Eliminating Battery Drain 
I
t's a fa miliar feeling, twisting 
the key and being rewarded 
with little more th an a groan 
from th e starter. Your mechanic 
di agno es it as nothing more than 
a tired battery, and a simple trans-
plant cures the problem. It's deja-
vu, as you've heard the same thing 
every winter-your car's battery 
needs replacement on an annual 
basis. It's time to get to the bot-
tom of the problem. 
Gi ven norma I ci rcumsta nces 
and use, a car battery should last 
four to fi ve years or more. Sure, 
there's a warra nty, but it's typi-
cally pro rata, which means that 
unless the battery dies an almost 
instant death, all you will get is a 
partial credit towa rd the price of a 
new one. 
There a re a lot of reasons why a 
car eats batteries. If you've had hard 
luck with the ones you've been buy-
ing, th e pro blem almost surely is not 
the fault of the battery manufactu r-
ers. O h, there's an occasional dud, 
but most of the time the 
reason is in the car itself. 
Deep-di scharging a few 
times wi II damage a ba t-
tery, and so will constant 
over- or und ercharging. 
All Charged Up 
First, mel ke sure the bat-
tery reall y is damaged 
before you spring for a 
new one. The simplest test 
is to full y charge it and see 
if it takes that charge. If it 
takes a charge, it's still 
good-but if it doesn't, it 
must be bad. 
(Fig. 1) Inexpensive low-current trickle chargers 
may not revive a completely discharged battery. 
nect a trickle charger overnight, and 
then conclude the next day that the 
battery can't take the charge. But 
there's a flaw in this approach: If a 
modern low-maintenance battery 
goes stone dead for some reason, it 
may need a rea l jolt to accept a 
charge. The discharged battery's inter-
nal resistance is very high, and 
many smaller chargers won't sup-
ply enough voltage to get over the 
hump (Fig. 1). There are profes-
sional chargers that starr out with 
well over 12 volts (typica ll y 18 to 
24 volts) to break through, and 
your trickle cha rger (or even a 
reasonably decent homeowner-
model charger) just won't kick 
out that much. You'll have to take 
the battery to a service station 
that has a premium charger. If yo u 
insist on trying to use your own 
small charger, it may take several 
days. Remember that the dash-
board ga uge rea lly doesn't tell you 
much. Check the voltage across 
the battery terminals when you're 
done (charger off and headlights on 
for 15 seconds to remove a "surface 
charge" ). It should be at least 12.7 
volts, preferably about 12.8 volts. 
Even if your battery isn't so run-
down that it needs breakthrough volt-
age to start tak ing a charge, it does 
need good connecti ons from the 
charger. Unfortunately, 
the side-terminal battery 
has a small contact area 
for the cable's alligator 
clip. Unless you have a 
specially shaped clip, you 
really need a charging 
adapter, made of copper, 
that clamps all the way 
around the side-terminal 
contact area (Fig. 2). 
If the battery takes a 
charge but runs down in 
use, there's a problem that 
has to be traced. Other-
wise, the car will seem to 
eat the next battery, too, 
even if it's a higher-
capacity model. 
Now that the battery is 
H ere's where we get to 
the procedure that con-
vinces many Saturday 
mechanics that they need 
a new battery. They con-

the charging voltage. With

ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS 

the engine running and warm and all 
the power-consuming accessories 
switched off, the voltage across the 
battery should read at least 13.8 
volts. Next, turn on the headlights 
and rear-window defroster, and set 
the heater/air-conditioning fan on 
high. The voltage should still 
be above 13.5 volts. Anything less 
means you may have a malfunction-
ing alternator.

Let's see if you're pulling more juice 
than the charging system can replace 
during your normal driving cycle. 
If you have a high-performance 
sound system and a cellular phone, 
and run other accessories, this kind 
of usage really sucks amps. But you

still should be okay-if you drive the 
car far enough. A half-mile in the 
morning with the alc on and a half-
mile back home at night with the alc 
and lights on, perhaps w ith your 
favorite CD blasting through the 
spea kers, is a great recipe for battery 
rundown. Drive your car long 
enough to pay back the battery for 
what you've borrowed, plus interest, 
at least once a week. 
In addition, today's cars pull a fair 
amount of current even when every-
thing seems to be off, just to keep 
alive the memories for all the elec-
tronics: the engine computer, keyless-
entry receiver, the radio presets and 
the alarm system, to name the most 
common. 
To keep the draw from depleting 
the battery, the electronics are sup-

there's a sma II-to-med i um 
draw that's bleeding the

tem that's not performing

you can spot the problem 
if you look hard. Many

the door opening and connect an

provides the ground. T he ohmmeter

eral hundred milliamps, or even as 
much as severa l amps. 
H owever, even if the draw is near 
50 milliamps or so when you actua ll y 
take your reading, it might be far too 
high before the snooze, or perhaps the 
electronics are awake for far too long. 
So, next, wake up the electronics and 
see what the rea dings are. 
To do that, disconnect the amme-
ter fro m the parasitic-draw adapter. 
Connect a battery booster cable from 
the battery terminal to the ca ble ter-
minal, bypassing the adapter. Turn the 
ignition key to the run (not to start) 
position. Wait a few seconds, then 
turn the key back to lock and take it 
out. Reconnect the ammeter, discon-
nect the booster ca ble and take the 
current-draw reading, which shoul d 
be the awake number. 
If the awake number is accepta ble, 
make sure the electronics go to sleep 
within a reasona ble amount of time. 
If the electronics still are awake and 
pulling hundreds of milliamps- or 
even an amp or more-hours later, 
something is very wrong. You can iso-
late a high current draw to a specific 
circuit by pulling one fuse at a time 
and rechecking. Just make sure the 
ignition is off.

which case the lights are supposed to

cover, decklid or hood slightly to see 
if the light already is on or just com-
ing on. If it's constantl y on, then 
you've fou nd your culprit. 
A bad doorj amb switch 
can cause 
a lot of problems. If it's 
making intermittent con-

up the electronics and 
turning on the interior 
lights.

ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS 

Rocking the Boat 
If the current draw is acceptable 
and the issue seems to be that the bat-
tery just suffered from short life, 
make sure that the battery case is in 
good condition and the battery hold-
down is tight (Fig. 5). Even a slightly 
loose battery can vibrate enough to 
suffer a short life. Just because a top 
holddown looks tight doesn't mean 
the battery actually is secure. See if it 
rocks, even a little. Many holddowns 
are against a bottom lip on the bat-
tery, almost out of sight, so if the 
battery mounting isn't rock solid, 
check a down-low holddown. 
Are the cables in good shape and 
securely tightened? The alternator 
may be pumping, but if the cable con-
nections are bad, the juice won't actu-
ally get to the battery. The battery 
ground usually is the big offender. 
In some cases, there's a split 
ground cable, and you can see one of 
the cable ends, in plain view and 
clearly tight. But the other part of the 
ca ble (usually the one to the engine) 
is buried deep, and what's out of 
sight shouldn't be out of mind. Find

it, and put a wrench on it to see if it's 
snug (Fig. 6). 
Many cars have a separate ground 
strap between body and engine, and it's 
usually nowhere near the battery (Fig. 7). 
In fact, if it's underhood, it's often dis-
connected for service and never recon-
nected. So the car's electrical system 
"forces" the juice through less efficient 
routes, and the battery is one of those 
that suffers. We've even seen engine-to-
body ground straps that actually ran 
from the transmission to some part of 
the underbody. These ground straps 
fray, come apart and are far from any 
place you normally wou ld look. 
So if you don't see a clear-cut route 
from the battery nega ti ve (ground) 
terminal to both the engine and the 
body, look again- everywhere. Some 
older Ford products have a single 
grou nd cable to the engine, but with 
the insulation stripped at midpoint, 
and the body ground made by a clip 
from the stripped section to the 
fender-well sheetmeta I. 
Okay, the battery takes a charge 
and the cable connections are good. 
Well, perhaps the accessories you use 
are simply pulling more juice than the 
car can provide in your short-trip 
operation. A regular diet of trickle 
charging every night shou ld provide 
the vitamins your battery needs for a 
normal life span. t6

EASY 
Replacing Headlights 
Y
Ou're cruising down a 2-lane 
road late at night. Oncoming 
cars flash their lights and toot 
their horns at you. Or they come 
straight at you and suddenl y veer 
away. No, they're not partied out. 
Unless you're blinding them with 
your high beams, one of your head-
lamps probably is out. 
Replacing burned-out head lamps 
is a straightforward procedure, if the 
problem is just the headlamp. 
Although most are about $1.5, some 
head lamps are special numbers, 
avai lable only from a dealer and can 
cost up to $45 apiece, even for an 
econobox. And there are even higher-
tech (a nd higher-priced ) systems, 
such as High Intensity Discha rge 
(HID ) headlamps, in some luxury 
models. They may look li ke ordinary 
headlamps-just as halogen sea led 
beams resemble the conventional 
sea led beams used years ago-but the 
manufacturing processes, the coat-
ings, the materials and the gases used 
inside the bulbs are totally different 
and produce tota ll y different lighting. 
Don't leave in a head lamp with a 
cracked lens just because the light hasn't 
gone out. Even if only a small part of 
the lens is missing, dirt gets in and coats 
the bulb inside, which reduces light out-
put. And if there's a chunk missing from 
the lens, the light beam isn't diffused as 
it should be and can blind oncoming 
drivers. With normal vehicle vibration, 
the lamp also may not hold its aim and 
you won't get the best view of the road. 
Also read "Servicing Composite Head-
lamps on page 149. 
Circuit Check 
If it seems that a headlamp is burned 
out, make a simple circuit check. With 
just one of two or four on the blink, 
the odds are that the sealed beam is 
the problem. It's unlikely that two 
headlamps will go out simultaneously.

held by either Phillips or Torx exter-
nal screws. A few may be on stu ds 
that project through to the back of 
the lamp assembly-these are accessi-
ble from under the hood. 
Next, look for and remove the four 
screws holding the headlamp rim or 
bezel. Be careful not to confuse them 
wi th the screws that control headlamp 
aim-the ones with coil springs under 
the screwheads. Are the screws rust-
frozen in place? Don't try too hard to 
turn them, or you may strip out the 
(Fig. 2) Use a simple 12v test light to confirm operating power and ground circuits 
before replacing an expensive bulb or sealed beam. 
Of course, if the low and the high 
beams are in a single bulb, it is possi-
ble, but it's much less likely when 
they're separate lights. 
Checking or changing a burned-
out headlamp begins with gaining 
access. If it's a sealed beam, there's 
probably a trim plate in front, which 
comes off first. Most trim plates are 
screwheads. Spray them with pene-
trating solvent and allow it to soak in 
(Fig. 1). The attachment screws usu-
all y have a Phillips head, but-like the 
tri m screws- they may be Torx. 
Once the rim is out, pull the sealed 
beam forward and unplug the wiring 
connector from the back. You'll see 
twO or th ree terminals on the lamp 
ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS 

and connector. A 2-headlamp system 
always has th ree term inals. A 4-eye 
lamp ma y have two or three, depend-
ing on how the entire circuit is wired. 
A simple check of the circuit is to 
see if there's power at the connector 
and a complete electrical ground. Take 
an ordinary 12v test light (Fig. 2), con-
nect the alligator clip end to a ground 
and check each connector terminal 
with the probe. T he headl amps 
should be turned on. T he test light 
should go on in at least one terminal. 
If the sealed beam is a 2-eye with 
three terminals, flick on the high-
beam switch and the test light should 
go on with the p robe in a second one 
of the three terminals. 
Next, unground the test light and 
gentl y press the alligator clip end (with 
a nail inserted, if necessary) to make 
contact with the other (ground wire) 
terminal-ground is usually a black 
wire. The test light should go on aga in. 
If the test light goes on during 
these two checks, install the new 
sea led bea Ill. If it doesn't, forget the 
insta llation until the circuit problem 
is repaired. If the test light went on 
when the alligator clip was connected 
to ground, but not when you probed 
the other connector terminal for a 
complete ground, the problem is a 
defective ground connection-a com-
Illon problem. 
Check a facto ry Illanual or after-
HOW IT WORKS 
market info rmation system, such as 
www.a lldata.com. for the location of 
your car's ground. [f the connection is 
corroded, wire-brush it clea n. [f it's 
loose, retighten it. 
No power to the headlamp con-
nector? That can be more difficult to 
trace, and you'll need a wiring dia-
gram and parts locator aga in . 
A new circuit complication is on 
the scene: daytime running lights, or 
DRLs. These may be the low-beam or 
high-beam headlamps, or other exter-
nallights such as tLirn signals. 
H eadlamps are wired in what is 
ca lled a para llel circuit-each lam p 
receives full battery voltage. However, 
if your ca r is a newer-than-'96 model 
Quartz-Halogen Sealed Beam 
The conventional sealed 
beam of years ago had a 
tungsten filament inside 
a lens assembly with a 
reflector. Today's quartz-
halogen beam is a sepa-
rate bulb inside that lens 
assembly. It produces a 
brighter, whiter light-at 
least 25% more down-
the-road visibility, with 
less power draw. 
The bulb envelope is a 
high-temperature glass-
the "quartz." The filament 
material is the familiar 
tungsten, but the bulb is 
filled with a special gas 
from a "family" called 
halogens, such as iodine 
or bromine gas (that family also includes alc refrigerants, 
by the way). In a conventional sealed beam, the high 
temperature of the tungsten filament causes particles of 
the metal to vaporize from it. The particles deposit on the 
wall of the conventional sealed beam (darkening it), and 
eventually the filament burns out. 
The quartz lens allows the bulb to operate at a much 
higher temperature to help produce that brighter, whiter 
light. The halogen gas inside the quartz envelope causes 
the "evaporating" tungsten particles to continuously 
redeposit on the filament, so it enjoys long life and con-
sistent brightness virtually until it fails. 
Headlamp technology is fast-moving. The High Intensity 
REPLACING HEADLIGHTS 
Discharge lamp (see 
page 150) is just one of 
the new approaches, but 
It's already installed as a 
low beam in some BMWs 
and Mercedes-Benzes 
and the Lincoln Mark VIII. 
This type has no filament, 
but instead it has two 
electrodes in an "atmos-
phere" of xenon gas. The 
current jumps the gap 
between the electrodes, 
producing a compara-
tively brighter light. You 
may have already seen 
these lights coming at 
you out on the highway. 
They're so white that 
they appear a little blue. 
But because there's no filament to burn out, the hour life 
of the xenon bulb is expected to go into six figures. 
There are several other new headlamp designs on the 
market, including one on the '97 Lexus ES 300 that uses 
multiple reflectors. All the new lamps-including the 
high-performance halogens-are capable of producing a 
lot of brightness with reasonable power consumption. 
And introduced in some 2003 models are "smart" head-
light systems that use signals from sensors to pivot the 
headlamps side to side for the road conditions and the 
way you're driving the car. These combination 
bright/smart lights are in part a technological fix for the 
declining night vision of a graying population. 
187 

with daytime running lights and the 
headlamp high beams are used, there's 
a second circuit controlling them 
through an electronic module. The 
high beams could be wired to the 
module so that they can be fed current 
for DRLs in a series circuit-the cur-
rent flows through both, so that one 
acts as a resistor for the other. The 
result is less brightness, but 
also less current flow for red uced 
power consumption. If you 
have a problem w ith the high 
beams, a defective DRL 
module is one of the new 
possibilities of which you 
should be aware, both for 
sealed beams and replaceable 
bulb designs. Some cars have 
DRLs that are also designed 
to shut off when the parking 
bra ke is applied. Read those 
circuit descriptions carefull y! 
Replaceable Bulbs 
Many late-model cars have a 
replaceable bulb plugged into 
the back of the lens assembly 
188 
(Fig. 3) instead of the sealed beam. 
(European cars have always used this 
type.) Typica lly, the bulb has a wiring 
connector held by a plastic locktab, 
and a plastic lockring to hold the bulb. 
Pry up the tab (with a thin screw-
dri ver, if necessary) and hold it up as 
you pull the harness connector off the 
terminals on the bulb. You can probe 
the harness connector the same way 
as on the sealed-beam design to make 
(Fig. 3) Newer cars use bulbs 
that can be replaced without 
using tools. Unscrew the 
socket from the reflector and 
change the bad bulb, then 
replace the socket. 
sure the bulb is at fau lt. An 
alternative: If the bulb is 
easy to remove, take it out 
for inspection. Turn the plas-
tic lockring, which may 
come out or stay loosely in 
place. Then grasp the bulb 
by its connector and gently 
rock it out (it seals w ith an 
O-ring to keep out dirt and 
moisture). If the bulb fil a-
ment is burned out, that tells 
you it's most likely the prob-
lem. Warning: Replacea ble 
bulbs are usually quartz-
halogen-and touching the 
bulb with your fingers will 
lea ve fingerprints that will 
crack the quartz glass with in 
a few hours. The new bulb 
will be wrapped in card-
board or foam, so don't remove the 
wrapping until last and avoid touch-
ing the bulb. Too late? Clean the bulb 
with alcohol and a clean cloth. 
When you insta ll the new bulb, 
work it in very carefull y, then push 
smoothl y to seat it in the lens hous-
ing. This ensures that the O-ring 
seals properly instead of being 
twisted or dislodged.

Saturday mechanic can do. Yes, we're 
talking abou t the powertra in com-

even the air conditioning. 
Today, you can order a computer 
fro m your neighborhood parts store, 
which can choose one from a long list 
of reliable aftermarket suppliers. T he 
computers are reconditioned, and in 
many cases you change over a pro-
gram module, which holds the spe-
cific calibration instructions 
for the powertra in, such as 
ignition timing. If you're ca re-
ful, you can do the jo b. In 
fact, in many cases you' ll fi nd

REPLACING YOUR CAR'S COMPUTER 
(Fig. 3) Some early Chrysler computers were 
housed in an air duct under the hood for cooling. 
Still another possibility: a 
laundry list of trouble codes. 
In many cases, the problem is 
in what's ca lled a driver, a type 
of electronic switching device 
that is in the computer box. 
H owever, it isn't replaceable, 
so if it's bad, the only cure is a 
new computer. 
Minor Surgery 
Computers typica ll y have 
been located under the das h-
board, accessible after 
removing a trim pad or the 
glove box on the passenger's 
189 

side. O lder Chrysler computers usu-
ally are under the hood, integrated 
into an engine air-intake duct, but 
they were an exception for the 
1980s (Fig. 3). Today, and as the 
electronics have become more heat-
resistant, many computers are 
located under the hood. 
Wherever the computer is located, 
the first steps are to turn off the igni-
tion and disconnect the battery 
gro und cable. 
Next, unplug the computer's 
wiring connector. It often has plastic 
latches or locking tabs, so you should 
look carefully before you try to pry 
anything off and press tabs or latches 
wherever necessary (Fig. 4). 
190 
Eyeba ll the terminals in the com-
puter and the wiring connector, look-
ing for both corrosion and signs of 
bending. You can try to straighten a 
bent pin-but no rough stuff. And 
don't try to sand or scrape off corro-
sion, or you'll ruin the terminal. Brace 
the terminal with your fingers and 
clean it with a pink pencil eraser. 
If everything looks good, start 
putting the connector back on by 
working it back and forth a few 
times, then pushing it all the way 
home. This may clean off a small 
amount of virtually invisible corro-
sion (enough to create havoc with 
electronics and produce multiple trou-
ble codes) and get the computer sys-
(Fig. 4) Once you've determined that 
the computer is really fried, replacing it 
is simple. It's often situated under the 
dash or behind the passenger's-side 
kick panel. There may be a locking tab 
holding the computer's umbilical 
connector in place. 
tern working again. If the problem 
comes back, well, at least you tried. 
Back to disconnecting the com-
puter. With the wiring connector off 
the computer, probe the connector's 
terminal for the ground wire with a 
computer-safe test light or multimeter 
(set to volts), connected to a 12-volt 
source (either at the battery or at the 
fuse box). The test light should go on 
to full brightness, or the meter should 
ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS 

read battery voltage. Also check the 
12-volt power feed (or feeds) in the 
connector with a grounded test light 
or voltmeter. The results should be the 
same. If you get a low-voltage reading 
or a weak light, there's a bad con-
nection. Whatever the result, always 
double-check all electronic grounds. 
Brain Transplant 
Is it a clear-cut case of a bad com-
puter? O rder the replacement and 
make the module changeover, if nec-
essary (Fig. 5). General Motors vehi-
cles and most European cars have 
computers with a plug-in program 
module, which doesn't come with the 
replacement computers. In fact, some 
have two modules, and you have to 
change over both. 
Remove the module cover, then 
take out the module. Some of them 
are held by retainers- push them 
back and simultaneously lift the 
module straight up and out. W ith 
most others, you have to pry it out, 
and the sa fest way is with thumb and 
fo refinger at the ends, applying an 
ever-so-slight rocking upward 
motion. The typical module is in a 
plastic carrier (don't try to separate 
the pieces). If space is too tight fo r 
your fingers, use two small screw-
drivers- one at each end-to rock 
the module assembly up as evenl y as 
possible. Do not pry one side up or 
yo u may bend the terminals. 
Note the way the module comes 
out, as it has to go into the new com-
puter the same way. It's possible to 
insta ll it backward on some cars, 
which could destroy the new com-
puter. Position the module on the 
mounting area of the replacement 
computer, push slowly (so you know 
that the terminals are lined up fo r 
engagement), applying pressure onl y

compensating adjustments 
(primarily to fuel-system ca l-
ibrations). So be prepared 
for perhaps 100 miles or 4 to 
5 hours of so-so performance 
as the new computer (even 
with an old program mod-
ule) learns how to do its job. 
(Fig. 5) You may need to remove your old calibra-
tion module and install it in the new computer. 
This is something to keep 
in mind if you are doing a 
test run to see if one of the 
minor operations (cleaning 
corrosion, tightening a 
ground and so on) fixed a 
problem. Disconnecting the 
battery cable erases the trou-
on the ends of the mod ule, until it 
seats. Lock the ta bs. 
Reconnect the wiring harness to 
the computer. If yo u're wo rking 
under the dash, yo u may build up a 
lot of static electricity while sliding 
into working position. As yo u make 
the harness connection, yo u could 
zap the computer with enough volt-
age fro m the static electricity to fry 
it. Simply gro und pa rt of yo ur body 
to an underdas h grou nd, such as by 
keeping a bare elbow against a 
metal brace. 
Make sure you not only seat the 
wiring connector, but that you close 
any latches that hold it in position. 
Reinstall the computer, engaging all 
clips and tightening all bolts, screws 
and nuts so the computer is held 
securely in position. 
Reconnect the car battery. The 
installation instructions with the 
replacement computer will provide a 
basic test of the system (similar to 
checking for trouble codes), and once 
that's done, you should be ready to 
drive. But all modern engine com-
puters must go through a period of 
"learning" how you drive and making 
ble codes. However, if the 
fa ults remain, most trouble codes 
show up aga in within a half-hour of 
vehicle operation, even though it 
takes much longer for overall engine 
performance to return to normal after 
a successful fix. 
All models since '96 have computers 
that conform to On-Board Diagnostics 
II (OBD II), an enhanced computer sys-
tem with some standardization of trou-
ble codes and diagnostic routines. O ne 
scan tester (computer-system data ana-
lyzer) will fit the underdash diagnostic 
plug on all OBD II cars, and there are 
models for Saturday mechanics for 
under $200 (see page 181). 
The OBD II computers on many 
vehicles are reprogrammable 
through the diagnostic plug. With 
previous systems, carmakers offered 
factory fixes by having the dealer 
replace the computer or the program 
module. With the specific OBD II 
system, they now ha ve the dealer 
simply reprogram the computer. A 
few cars have had rep rogrammable 
computers in past (pre-OBD II) 
years, but with OBD II, it's basica ll y 
across the board on U.S. nameplates 
and most imports. ~

t's a sweltering day. You get 
behind the wheel, start the engine 
and hit the max alc button. But 
instead of refreshingly cool air hitting 
you, there's a blast that smells li ke a 
basketball team's locker room after a 
hard game. Your car's air condition-
ing is suffering from what could be 
ca lled "jock socks odor." And you're 
not alone-it's one of the most com-
mon complaints that Popular 
Mechanics receives from readers. 
If you take the car in to a dealer, 
he' ll tell you it's a fungus growth in 
the under-dash alc case that holds the 
evaporator. That's the heat exchanger 
that pulls the BTUs out of the passen-
ger compartment. His solution is an 
expensive cleanout of the alc with dis-
infectant. And after you've spent a lot 
of money, the smell is gone- for a 
wh ile. It may be back before the air 
conditioning season is over. 
Is there a less costly and mo re 
durable way to fix it yourself? Can 
you prevent the problem fro m occur-
ring in the first place? The answer to 
both questions is yes. 
(Fig 2) An evaporator-tray drain 
that's plugged with dirt and debris 
might keep moisture from draining 
onto the ground.

ment because it's where the air is 
dehumidified (as well as cooled ), and 
when you shut off the engine, heat 
builds up inside the evaporator hous-
ing. A hot, humid environment with 
stagnant air is the perfect setting for 
fungus growth. 
The recircu lati on switch closes off 
outside air, and causes the alc to 
merely recirculate the ai r in the pas-
senger compartment. With little or 
no entry of hot outside a ir, the inte-
ri or gets cooler faster and remains 
much colder. It's okay to use recircu-
lati on to help with the initia l cool-
down on a sweltering day, but after a 
few minutes, yo u shou ld shift out of 
recirculation to bring in fresh air.

ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS 

(Fig. 3) There are effective and ineffec-
tive cures for alc odor. This aftermarket 
disinfectant works when sprayed 
directly onto the evaporator core. 
Before spraying, tape over the blower 
resistor opening (illustrated), making a 
small opening for the straw. 
Many manual and automatic tem-
perature-control systems are in recir-
culation when in ma x alc or at the 
lowest temperature on the automati c 
system's dial. In this instance, you 
should also shift to a slightl y warmer 
setting. 
Garbage Collection 
The next step is to lift the hood and 
inspect the air intake at the cowl. If 
it's packed w ith leaves and other 
CURING A I C ODORS 
debris, you may ha ve a miniature 
compost pile forming. The odors 
from it are drawn into the passenger 
compartment by the blower fan. 
These odo rs a re equall y unpl easant, 
and yo u wil l need to dig out the 
debris or clean it up w ith a shop vac-
uum and wash out the area to get rid 
of them. 
After you've cleaned it, remove 
the a ir-intake grille, insert a fine 
window-screen mesh underneath, 
sea l the perimeter with plumber'S 
putty, then refit the screen. Periodi-
ca ll y check the sc reened area and 
remove debris to ensure a fresh air 
suppl y. Most late-models have an 
intake air filter that removes smoke 
and pollen from the o utside air. 
These fil ters a lso keep out debri s 
and may ha ve a replacement interva l 
of typically one yea r or 15,000-
20,000 miles. 
When you're do ing an o il change 
or oth er regular maintenance und er 
th e hood, inspect the eva po rator-
tray drains (Fig. 2), which are o ne or 
two hoses on most ve hicles. [f the 
hose ends are plugged or badl y dam-
aged, the moisture that the evapora-
tor wrings from the interior air wi ll 
not drain properly, leaving a stag-
nant pool for fung i. Dig out any 
road film with a thin screwd ri ver. 
Many hose ends have built-in check 
va lves, w hich shou ld be carefu ll y 
inspected for damage. The ends are 
speciall y shaped, so don 't trim them 
flat with a razor blade. Open the 
check valves gentl y, and if th e ends 
J 
193 

are nOt dam aged or plugged, leave 
them a lone. If the ends are damaged, 
howeve r, the best route is to replace 
the hose. 
The next step is at th e evaporator 
case. But before you do any work, 
check with the car dea ler to deter-
mine if th ere's a speci fic factory 
soluti on th at goes beyond disinfect-
ing and other steps we' ll be cover-
ing. For exa mp le, ma ny 1985-94 
Cadi llacs have evaporators with 
such tight spacing between the fins 
that th e evaporator holds too much 
moisture, increasing fung i growth. 
General Motors has replacement 
194 
evaporators that may decrease cool-
ing a few degrees, but drain mois-
ture more readily. 
Late-model Chrysler products 
since 1992, particularly mini va ns, 
have been known to suffer from air-
conditioning odor. It doesn't smell 
like dirty socks, but it is offensive, 
and the ca use is an overly thick coat-
ing of a corrosion treatment. Here 
aga in, the onl y fix is a new evapora-
tor. See your car dealer. 
For the overwhelming majority 
of cars, the treatment is to disinfect 
th e evaporator case. Some shops use 
expensive professiona l equipment 
th at ta kes severa l hours to use cor-
rectly. It's the best treatment, but it's 
fa irly costl y. You can save some 
money a nd get very good resu lts 
with a quality handhe ld disinfectant 
spray if yo u work careful ly (Fig. 3). 
A ho usehold disinfectant such as 
Lysol ca n be used, bur it isn't made 
for this problem, and any resu lts 
will be too short- li ved to justify th e 
effort. Listerine wo n't work either, 
despite th e fac t that it's often rec-
ommended by people who do n't

Wiring 
Just locate the blower motor's wiring 
connector (Fig. 4) and, with a 
grounded test light, isolate the cur-
rent-feed terminal if there are two 
wires. The mod ule's wiring is very 
straightforwa rd, and when it's 
installed, the module turns on the 
blower at the appropriate time in high 
ambient temperatures when ale oper-
ation normall y would occur. It rea ll y 
is easier than it sou nds. The most dif-
ficult part wi ll probably be finding a 
good place to sinstall the module, 
w hich is held by a Velcro strip.

Strapping In 
Draining the cooling system and refill-
ing it with a fresh mixture of antifreeze 
and water is the No. 1 do-it-yourself 
job, and it's worth doing right. That 
means opening the engine block drain 
(if there is one) as well as the one on 
tbe radiator and getting out all the old 
coolant. You then face the problem of 
completely filling the cooling system. 
Because the radiator or surge tank 
neck on many cars isn't the high point 
of the system, air is trapped elsewhere. 
Even if it is the high point, there are 
nooks and crannies in modern systems, 
many of which were developed with 
sophisticated computer programs for 
an efficient flow pattern.

doesn't have a bypass va lve, the 
engine will wa rm up slowly, and it 
may run hotter in summer and heat 
poorly in winter. A thermostat also 
may have a jiggle va lve, a pinli ke 
device that balances pressures in the 
system and helps bleed air. 
when clamped down a precise 
amo unt. Still others, which resemble 
conventi ona l gaskets, have to rque-
limit buttons, which are meta l or hard 
plastic rings for the bolt holes, to 
resist over-tightening. Others use a 
hard-plastic carrier to carry an engi-
neered-shape rubber sealing ring, as 
shown in the illustrati on on the fol-
lowing page. Intake manifo ld gas kets 
are traditi ona ll y difficult to seal on v-
shaped engines, especially when 
there's a combination of aluminum 
cylinder heads and a cast-iron block. 
You could use a conventional gas-
ket in place of these high-tech won-
ders, and it will cost less-but it had 
better be made by a reputa ble gas ket 
company specifica ll y listed for your 
ca r's exact yea r and applicati on. 
Usua lly the torque 
required to seal a gasket 
properl y is a lot less than 
you would think feels 
right, and if you over-
tighten, you distort the 0-
ring and it will leak. You 
have to use a torque 
wrench to be sure. 
Even if you get the right thermo-
sta t, you have to insta II it correct! y so 
it operates normall y. On many Japa n-
ese ca rs with thermostat jiggle va lves, 
for example, there's a specified posi-
tion for the va lve, such as being 
aligned with a tab at 12 o'clock.

Exhaust System 
Today's high-tempera-

exhaust systems are any-
thing but cheap, and 
they' re either welded 
together or held by super-
duty clamps (Fig. 3). If 
you ha ve to cut a weld to 
replace a pipe o r muffler, 
get a hi gh-qu a lity clamp 
to ensure it ho lds the 
joint on today's heavier 
pi pes. Yo u may have to

The gaskets that seal the thermo-
stat housing and water pump also are 
very differe nt from the fiber/pa per 
type you may be fa miliar with on

designs are all over the powertra in. 
Gaskets 
The simple precut gasket is still 
around, and it may even be a good 
choice on older cars for replacing 
fo rmed-in-place silicone, which ca n 
smear during installation and th ere-
fo re seal poorly. 
However, more of the gaskets used 
today are high-tech designs that 
resemble giant O-rings. Some of them

Brakes 
If your car has antilock brakes, be 
careful not to damage the wheel sen-
sor when yo u pull a ca li per for brake 
lining work. In fact, it's a good time 
to inspect the sensor connector for 
ph ysical damage and the trigger wheel 
for badly chipped teeth. You may find 
a reason for misbehavior of your 
high-tech brake system that's 
198 
repairable with some pretty common 
do-it-yourself parts replacements. 
Bleeding brakes at the wheels after 
you replace a caliper should not be a 
problem with antilock brakes-just 
stuff a tapered plastic plug into the 
brake hose end when you disconnect 
the caliper, to help keep out air. 
H owever, replacing the master 
cylinder might be a special problem. If 
it's physica lly separate from the 
antilock hydraulic components, you 
can bleed a master cylinder very well 
on the bench (or in some cases on the 
car, just before you reconnect the 
brake lines)-there are special kits 
available in auto parts stores for this. 
And when you install the master 
cylinder on the car or reconnect the 
brake lines, the pedal should be firm .

cases where doing this confuses 
the car's electronics. This prob-
lem afflicts late-model Thunder-

grammed Ride Control, ea rly 
Mazda 626s with Auto Adjust 
Suspension (but not the later 
models), Nissan 300ZX Turbos 
and more exceptions to come. 
We suspect, however, that there 
will be computer bypass kits 
available eventually.

necessarily mean replacing the actuator. 
Tuneup and general electrical

careful, but if you are, yo u 
Just plug any hydraulic lines you dis-
connect to keep out as much air as 
possible when you start the job. 
If the master cylinder and antilock 
system are a single assembly, you 
may have to fo llow a specific shop 
man ual procedure to bleed it. Some-
times this is d-i-y doable, and some-
times it isn't. For example: The mas-
ter cylinderlanti lock assembly on 
many Fords requires a special proce-
dure. But, the late-model 
TauruslSable also calls for a special 
electronic switching device and a 
breakout box (a special adapter for 
testing circuits) to bleed the single 
assembly which (for now) makes it a 
job for a dealer. 
Shocks and Struts 
Those computer-controlled shocks 
may have seemed like a neat feature 
when the car was new, but they may 
cost hundreds of dollars a pair at 
replacement time. If you want to 
maintain the electronic control, on 
many cars you can transfer the electric 
motors that operate the originals to a 
pair of new shocks and save some 
money (Fig. 4). Even with switching 
over the motors, you can be in for 
major expense with electronica ll y con-
trolled shocks, and it may not seem 
worth it on an older car. 
should not let fear of smoking some 
expensive component keep you from 
doing work. Here are a few guidelines 
to follow: 
• W hen you have to disconnect a fuel 
line on most Ford and Chrysler prod-
ucts, you' ll genera lly find it doesn't 
have a threaded fitting, but a quick-
connect type. It takes a special but 
inexpensive tool, available from auto 
parts stores (Fig. 5). Don't try to pry 
the fuel fitting apart, or you'll dam-
age it. These fittings often have 0-
ring seals, which should be 
replaced. Be sure to get these 
in a packet for the exact 
app lica tion. Ford, for exam-
ple, uses spring-lock cou-
plings on both fuel and alc 
lines. The O-rings are not 
only a slightly different size, 
but a tota lly different rub-
ber. Fuel-line O-rings won't 
li ve in alc and vice versa. 
• If you have to disconnect 
a wiring terminal from a 
plastic connector, such as for 
an electrical test, you can't 
just shove in a small screw-
driver blade to disengage it, 
or you could damage the ter-
minal and create a problem 
where none existed. Virtu-
ally all late-model cars have 
special terminals and plastic 
require special tools. The pick-type 
tools for Genera l Motors and many 
Ford cars are ava ilable from auto 
parts stores, but you could have diffi-
culty with other makes. In '93, 
Chrysler switched to a new line of 
connectors that require a half-dozen 
special tools that we still haven't seen 
in auto parts stores . 
• If you ha ve to disconnect a battery 
cable, consider the use of a computer 
memory saver. It not only wil l keep 
the time on the electric clock and hold 
the preset radio stations, it will main-
tain the long-term calibrations of the 
powertrain computer. If you lose 
these, the car's driveability may be 
poor until the computer "relearns," 
which could take 100 or more miles 
of driving. 
There are two basic types of mem-
ory savers. The 9-volt battery with 
one type is okay, but just a small volt-
age drop could kill the memory. So 
you must keep a I I electrica I accessories 
and lights off (that means door dome-
light switches, too, so either keep the 
doors closed or install hold-closed 
clips on the switches). An alternative is 
a saver that hooks up to a 12-volt bat-
tery. If your battery is okay, just care-
fu lly make the connections as you dis-

Fortunately, on most cars you can 
unplug the computer at a connector in 
the trunk and then insta ll conven-
connectors for positive 
retention, and these usually

a special inexpensive tool to open them.

connect the cable. Or use the battery 
from another car or a lantern battery. 
• Use a computer-safe test light. A 
standard 12-volt light may allow 
enough current draw through a cir-
cuit with electronics to measurably 
shorten the life (or even fry) some 
solid-state components. Computer-
safe test lights start at under $15, and 
even the best-which plug into a ciga-
rette lighter socket and identify both 
power feed and ground-are under 
$60, including one that has a built-in 
flashlight (for probing under the dash) 
and a buzzer if you're probing a 
power feed in a blind spot. 
• The test meter should be a "high-
impedance" type (10 megohms or 
greater), for the same aspects of safety 
for electronic circuits as the test light. 
Name-brand multimeters may go over 
$500, but there are suitable volt-ohm-
meters that start at under $50. 
If you have to probe a circuit and 
wa nt to do it safely, one way is to buy 
a " bed of nails" test lead that makes 
mini holes in a wire, and when you 
disconnect the lead, they self-heal. 
You can pierce the insulation with a 
dressmaker's hemming pin, but it may 
not make good enough contact with 
the copper wiring inside. 
• Don't reposition wires underhood. 
This applies not only to spark-plug 
wires, but to any harness, including a 
battery cable (particularly if yo u get a 
replacement that's a different length 
from the original, or is outside a har-
ness and is not easy to route the same 
way). The reason is the high-voltage 
electricity from spark-plug wires may 
produce electrical interference in adja-
cent low-voltage circuits, particularly 
if they contain electronic components. 
Because many electronic components 
operate on 5-8 volts, even the sud-
den flow of 12-vo lt high-amperage 
electricity through a battery cable 
during cranking can cause big trouble. 
• Never disconnect or connect a cir-
cuit, or an electronic module, with the 
ignition key in the ON position. In fact, 
to avoid static electricity damage, 
unplug an electronic module with one 
hand held to a body ground. Static 
electricity that discharges from your 
hand may not totally trash an elec-
tronic module, but it can shorten its 
life from years down to weeks or even 
days. Professionals who face this 
problem all the time may wear a 
grounding strap on one of their wrists. 
As you get familiar with your car 
and read the manuals, you will be able 
to move into higher-technology service . 
You'll discover that it takes careful 
attention to the diagnostic procedures 
in the manuals, but it isn't rocket sci-
ence, and it doesn't take a degree in 
computer science, either. The high tech 
you've already learned in doing the low-
tech service will get you started. fI

EASY 
Scan Tool Diagnosis 
I
t's state inspection time and 
you're ready to leave bright and 
early for the inspection station 
with the famil y's '98 minivan. You're 
starting the day in a less than jovial 
mood because your daughter said 
"the light came on" last night on the 
way home. She said she threw a few 
dollars of gas into the tank to make it 
home. Turns out your annoyance is 
misplaced. Sure enough, the light's on 
all right, but it's not the fue l warning, 
it's the CHECK ENGINE warning. You 
stop for gas anyway, and then you 
pull into the inspection lane. 
Well, full tank or not, the minivan 
does not pass muster. 
SCAN TOOL DIAGNOSIS 
Failure Is Not an Option 
This is a late-model vehicle with 
what's known as OBO II, the second-
generation on-board diagnostic sys-
tem that replaced OBO I starting in 
1994. It's industry-wide and federa lly 
mandated. One of the problems with 
OBO II for the do-it-yourselfer is that 
you can't get trouble codes by count-
ing the blinks on the CHECK ENGINE 
light like you can on earlier computer-
controlled vehicles. You could take 
your minivan into a high-tech shop, 
where the minimum charge for diag-
nosis and inspection could run you 
somewhere into three figures. Or you 
can learn about OBO II yourself, but 
(Fig. 1) OBO II scan tools hook to the 
car's engine-management computer via 
a connector under the steering wheel. 
you will need a piece of diagnostic 
equipment that you probably don't 
have-an OBO II scan tool (Fig. 1). 
If the Check Engine light came on, 
it should be no surprise that the vehi-
cle failed an emissions test. With OBO 
II, that light comes on only if there's a 
failure that significantly affects emis-
sions. That makes the scan tool even 
more important since it will reveal a 
lot of the problems that do not cause 
the warning light to come on. 
With many problems, the light 
201 

stays on after the repair is made and 
the code remains in the computer 
memory for a certain number of igni-
tion ortloff cycles. Your daughter didn't 
tighten the gas cap correctly, causing a 
code for the evaporative emissions sys-
tem to set. Eventually the light will go 
out and the code will self-erase, per-
haps after the next time you start and 
stop the ca r. You also can use the scan 
tool to erase it immediately. 
With many other problems, how-
ever, the only way to turn off the light 
and erase the code is with the scan 
tool. Just a warning: If you erase trou-
ble codes with a scan tool or discon-
nect the battery for any reason, you 
also erase the computer's continuous 
monitoring system. So if you take 
your car in for a stare inspection 
before enough normal driving, the 
computer might not have completed 
all its tests, and your car will fa il 
inspection for that reason. 
The OBD II scan tester not only will 
enable you to find answers to the sim-
pler problems, but will tell you into 
what areas the seemingly more compli-
cated ones fall. Then you will have a 
better understanding of what the tech-
nician is (or should be) looking for. 
Cracking the Code 
With an OBD II scan tool you also can 
read a certain amount of engine operat-
ing data: typically rpm, ignition timing, 
fuel-injection calibrations, readings 
from a variety of sensors (such as the 
oxygen, throttle position, barometric 
and mass airflow sensors), a "calcu-

lated load" value and sometimes 
switch position signals (Fig. 2). OBD II 
also includes a "capture" mode, in 
which you can use the scan tool to take 
a "snapshot" of what the sensors were 
reading at the exact instant a drivea bil-
ity hiccup occurred (Fig. 3). 
Sensor Scan 
With enhanced scan tool capability, you 
can discover problems that do not trig-
ger the engine-warning light. For exam-
ple, we recently turned up a generic 
P0713 code on a late-model car. This is 
listed in the shop manual as "transmis-
sion fluid temperature sensor circuit-
high input." If the transmission fluid is 
running very hot, the transmission 
could completely fail, and quickly. 
A scan tool could save a lot of 
worry and effort if it has enhanced 
diagnostics. You can do much of the 
troubleshooting from the driver's seat 
the way we did. First we cleared the 
code with a simple push of a button on 
the tester. Then we rechecked: The code 
came back quickly. We cleared it again 
and looked at the reading that was 
coming from the transmission tempera-
ture sensor to the powertrain computer. 
It was 131
0 F, nothing abnormal. 
The problem apparently was in the 
sensor or the circuit, possibly a bad con-
nection. The wiring was good and when 
we started poking around, we found 
physical damage that clearly indicated 
the problem was a defective sensor. 
So Many Choices 
If you have a late-model vehicle, you 
have OBD II. However, just because 
it's generic, and the wiring 
connector from any OBD Il 
scan tool will plug into your 
vehicle, doesn't mean any 
OBD II scan tool will work 
on your car. The Europeans 
are the problem, as the ones 
after 1998 requi re a soft-
ware upgrade. Korean cars 
are also problematic, and 
how well they work with 
any given scan tool needs to 
be investigated on a case-
by-case basis. 
Further, new cars are 
being converted (on a phase-in basis 
starting with Saturn and Saab in 2003) 
to "CAN" (Controller Area Network). 
This is a new diagnostic "protocol" and 
most scan tools will need an adapter 
module, or complete replacement. 
The OTC Mind Reader for OBD I 
can be upgraded with an additional 
chip to read generic OBD II in domes-
tic, Japanese and earlier European 
models (but not the later Europeans). 
T he Actron ScanTool for O BD I 
can be updated to the same level of 
OBD II as the OTC Mind Reader 
with a plug-in cartridge (or you can 
buy an OBD II-only model). 
AutoXray produces a programma-
ble scan tool. Although it doesn't have 
the OBD I Chrysler command tests of 
the M ind Reader, it is the one home 
mechanic's scan tool we've tested to 
date that covers all generic OBD II 
models (including the Europeans) with 
more on the way and covers the new 
CAN diagnostic with just a software 
ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS 

update. The software is sold over the 
Internet. You' ll be able to store it on 
your per sonal computer and then 
dow nload it to your scan tool via a 
cable available from the manufacturer. 
Any A utoXray scan tool is designed 
to be upgraded electronically, from one-
make OBD I coverage through the lat-
est models. Although the professionals 
have had this software (and a lot more) 
in their scan tools, you have to wait for 
it in the consumer market. O ther scan 
tools may be upgraded to enhanced sta-
tus and beyond with new cartridges, 
CD-ROMs or via the Internet. Ask 
about upgrades before you buy. 
Although Actron has a line of OBD 
II scan tools, its top tester for ca r own-

resetters like this one do not give 
you sensor data. 
ers is the Actron CP9087, a simple 
code reader w ith read-codes and 
code-erase buttons. You get no sen-
sor readings or other data items (Fig. 
4). It's a low-cost device (under 
$200) that comes with a good 
assortment of wire leads for making 
test connections-incl uding a back-
probe adapter that has a thin, 
curved metal terminal. T his term inal 
lets the probe slip through a water-
sealed connector to reach a wiring 
terminal for a test connection. 
OBD II has been in use on all 
vehicles since 1998, so the earliest 
vehicles th at have this system are we ll 
off warranty. OBD II is complex and 
we've given you just a basic introduc-
tion. The OBD II powertrain com-
puter is getting a lot better at fin ding 
problems and logging codes. But, the 
computer won't tell yo u a thing 
unless you hook up a scan tool. (I 
How OBD II Transmits Data 
Today's powertrain com-
puters are at the heart of a 
vehicle's communications 
network, circulating infor-
mation from switches and 
sensors to the other com-
puters that control anti lock 
brakes, air conditioning, 
transmission, suspension 
and safety systems. The 
powertrain computer is 
also in charge of systems 
that affect engine emis-
sions, so the information it 
processes has to be avail-
able for evaluation by a technician. That information 
travels along a wire to a standard 16-terminal diagnostic 
connector (although, generally, fewer than a half-dozen 
terminals are live in any given vehicle). Because manu-
facturers do not all use the same data transmission pro-
tocols, the scan tool must be programmed to recognize 
which one is being used. Fortunately, there has been 
some standardization, but we're not down to one trans-
SCAN TOOL DIAGNOSIS 
mission protocol for all, 
hence the problem with 
late-model European cars 
(including the Cadillac Cat-
era). There are four differ-
ent so-called standard 
data pins in the standard 
connector, and at least 
four different types of data 
transmissions that could 
be used, plus enhanced 
versions of the standard 
stuff (other pins are avail-
able for additional manu-
facturer-specific data, 
such as vehicle diagnostic systems for alc and ABS). 
As anyone with a household PC knows, "plug and 
play" doesn't always work, and OBO II scan tools can 
encounter compatibility problems. Some European and 
Korean cars don't always work when they're suppossed 
to. How can you tell? Checking a scan tool manufac- . 
turer's Web site for updates is the way to keep your 
tool current.

Desperate Measures 
Trailer wiring may be easy. Many 
vehicles, particularly pickups and 
SUVs, come prewired for trailers. If 
there's a preinstalled hitch, the con-
nector might already be in place 
behind a convenient spring-loaded 
cap. Or, if you've bought a new vehi-
cle, you may find the harness needed 
to install the connector inside the 
glove box. Simply unplug the connec-
tor to the rear lights on your truck, 
plug in the trailer harness between the 
male and female ends, and you're 
ready. 
But wiring a tra iler may not be 
easy. If you're towing just for the day 
and don't ever plan to tow again, you 
can pick up some adapters that 
replace the taillight bulbs in your 
vehicle and have pigtailed wires hang-
ing from them. How you route the 
wires out of the light sockets and 
down to the hitch can be problematic. 
And what if you have a trailer with 
simple I-lamp lights and a car with 
multiple taillights, like most European 
cars? At the very least, odds are the 
trailer and vehicle use different con-
nectors, as the trailering industry uses 
at least fo ur different styles.

you need onl y three wires to the tra iler 
plus a groun d wire. 
Always run a ground wire from the 
frame of the vehicle (not from the

Adding another taillamp housing to 
the trailer is one option, but a simpler 
solution exists. Your trailer-rental 
place, and most auto parts stores, sell 
simple electronic adapters 
that will combine the brake-
lamp and turn-signal func-

Other Circuits 
Some larger tra ilers ha ve a

which are separate from the 
running lights in the tail-
lamp assemblies. You may 
for ru nning lights inside the trailer or 
for charging the trailer battery in the 
case of a travel trailer. This circuit 
probably will be hot whenever the 
engine is running, but it may be con-
trolled by a switch on the dash. Be 
sure the wires are of a ga uge la rge 
mended. This will prevent discharging 
the vehicle battery from the trailer, 
and prevent surges of current from 
overcooking the wiring or blowing a 
fuse. 
Whoa, Nellie 
This leads to the concept of electric 
trailer brakes. These are actuated by 
a contro ller in the vehicle that 
increases the voltage to the brakes 
proportional to the vehicle's deceler-
ation. This requires a wire from the 
controller to the trailer brake. (This 
is why some connectors have as 
man y as seven pins, to make provi-
sions for the multiple circuits.) Use 
12-ga. wire for this circuit. If you 
have electric trailer brakes, there 
must be an auxiliary battery and a 
breakaway switch in the circuit to 
slow the trailer if it comes loose from 
the hitch. 
Keeping It All Together 
How to make the connections? 
We've seen plenty of trailers lumber-
ing down the road with blinking or 
dim lights. Odds are, if you looked 
at the wiring on one of these rigs, 
you'd see wires twisted together and 
insulated with electrical tape. 
Almost as bad are the automotive-
style crimp connectors, 
need to add another circuit 
to handle them. If you try to 
wire them in parallel with

vibration and moisture. 
Any crimp connector 
exposed to the elements 
will have a short life span. 
Don't even think of using 
household-style wire 
nuts-they' ll unscrew 
themselves within a few 
hundred miles. We use the 
screw-in Posi-Lock connec-
tors ill ustra ted here for 
quick jobs. Our own trailer 
has every connection made 
with solder and PVC 
the customary pair of run-
ning lamps, yo u may overload the 
vehicle's headlamp switch-so you'll 
need to add a relay to handle the 
extra current.

DIFFICULT 
Fixing Faulty Cruise Control 
A
larmingly, the speedometer 
needle steadily winds down 
from 75 mph toward 50. Just 
as you uncurl your feet and try to 
accelerate back to traffic speeds, the 
vehicle downshifts with a lurch and 
abruptly climbs back to over 80 mph. 
So you tap the brakes and disengage 
the cruise control to avoid a conversa-
tion with one of the many law 
enforcement officers lurking behind 
every other billboard. Toggling the 
Resume switch settles things down, 
holding to a legal speed on both the 
uphill and downhill sections of the 
interstate. The kids in the back seat

have stopped threatening to throw

20 miles later and see the lights. Red 
and blue flashing ligh ts. You're doing 
over 85 mph and, odds are, Smokey 
isn't going to believe you have the 
cruise set to 70. Time to find out why 
your cruise control has a mind of its 
own.

Does your Japanese car not

their set speed if the vehicle speed fa lls

to accelerate the vehicle to your set 
speed and hit the Set button again. 
Annoying, but that's the way they 
were designed.

longer downhills to keep 
from building up excess 
speed? T hat's norma l too. 
The cruise control only has 
authority to reduce engine 
speed to idle. It doesn't acti-
vate th e brakes. Modern cars, 
in an attempt to improve 
mileage, have very tall gear 
ratios, low-friction engine 
designs, low-roll i ng-resis-
tance tires and optimized 
aerodynamics. That long 
downgrade outside of town 
may have accelerated your 
'60s-era Pontiac to onl y a 
couple of miles per hour 
above legal. But, it may well 
propel your new economy ca r 
to blatantl y illegal velocities unless 
yo u intervene by braking or down-
shi fting. 
Smooth and steady 
Cruise control on your vehicle is a ter-
rific device. It substantiall y reduces 
the driver's workload on longer trips, 
and can save substantia l amou nts of 
fuel and expense over the life of the 
vehicle-until it stops work ing. 
We'll get to the scenario of not 
holding a steady speed later, but here 
are a couple of things to check imme-
diately if the cruise control is on 
strike. 
Does the Cruise icon on the dash 
light up when you turn the switch on? 
Duh. Check the fuse. You ma y need 
to look in the owner's man ual to see 
which one if it's not tagged on the 
fu se box cover. An aftermarket cruise 
may ha ve an inline fuse holder in the 
wiring to the controller. 
If there is power to the system, the 
next check is the brake lights. Brake 
lights? Yup, cruise controls have a 
switch to toggle them off when you 
touch the brake pedal, and many use 
the same switch as the brake lights. If 
one of the brake lights has fa iled, the 
cruise control thin ks the brakes are 
208 
on a II the ti me a nd won't come on. 
Same result if the switch is incorrectl y 
adjusted or broken or jam med. Wa it, 
there's more-if your vehicle has a 
manua l transmission, there's a similar 
switch on the clutch pedal. You ma y 
need to break o ut a test light or multi-
meter to verify the function of this 
array of switches. T hese switches usu-
a ll y are norma ll y closed switches, and 
WHAT'S THIS THING?: The cruise 
control servo motor could be anywhere

close their contacts when the 
pedal is depressed. We've seen 
several cases of intermittent 
cruise control dropout ca used 
by a brake light switch that 
was adjusted very tight. Any 
small bump would jiggle the 
brake pedal down far enough 
to toggle the brake lights on 
for a brief instant-long 
enough to shut down the 
cruise. Adjusting the switch 
to specs (usua lly so the brake 
lights come on after the pedal 
travels 11 in.) fi xed it. 
Once you verify all of 
these things, it's time to look 
for more subtle causes. Check 
underhood . Inspect the link-
age between the cruise con-
trol actuator and the throttle. 
It may be as simple as a toilet-
tank bead chain or a separate 
throttle cable with its own 
actuator cam to the throttle body. 
Look fo r disconnected or damaged 
wiring to the contro ller or actuator, 
particularly if it's an aftermarket sys-
tem, which may have been insta lled 
by someone with poor mechanical 
skills. 
Another obvious fai lure point is 
the vacuum line to the actuator. If it 
has fallen off, there's no vacuum to 
the actuator and no force can be 
applied to the throttle. We' ll get 
ahead of ourselves here and menti on 
that a vacu um line that looks fine may 
ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS 

SPEEDOMETER HEAD 
have a subtle lea k caused by aging, 
brittle rubber or connections that 
don't seal well. A lot of the cruise 
controls we've seen with issues in reg-
ulating their speed correctly are fixed 
by simply replacing all the vacuum 
lines between the servo, vacuum 
reservoir (if there is one) and the 
intake manifold vacuum supply. 
Control issue with your servo 
There are two main components of 
the cruise control system: the con-
troller and the servo. 
The controller integrates all the 
inputs and tells the servo how far to 
actuate the throttle plates. Normally, 
there is no way you can service this 
item, so if you trace a problem to the 
controller, you'll have to buy a new 
one. A bad controller probably will 
require a service manual for specific 
diagnostics. You'll also need a scan 
tool to access any computer trouble 
codes to boot. 
The servo does the work of moving 
the throttle blades to speed up the 
vehicle. Conventional systems are 
actuated by manifold vacuum. Check 
the lin kage from the servo to the 
throttle to ensure it's properly hooked 
up and not binding or sticky. Inside 
the servo is a diaphragm that moves 
to pull on the linkage. Some older sys-
tems, used on cars or trucks that don't 
have throttle-position sensors, may 
have a rod that moves in and out of a 
magnetic coil to tell the controller the 
throttle position. There are also two 
electrically operated solenoid valves. 
One valve admits vacuum to the 
diaphragm chamber to add more 
throttle. The other bleeds air back 
into the chamber to reduce throttle. 
N ormall y, they will never be open at 
the same time, so if one is sticky or 
leaking, cruise control operation will 
be erratic at best. Check fo r leakage 
with a handheld vacuum pump. A 
leaky valve may benefit from a quick 
shot of silicone spray. 
Diesels and some late models may 
use a servo that is completely electri-
cal. These usually are mounted on the 
fe nderwell or firewall, and are con-
nected to the throttle by a second 
throttle ca ble. Other than keeping the 
ca ble lubricated and properl y 
adjusted, there's not much to fiddle 
with . As always, check the shop man-
ual for specifics on your vehicle. 
• 
SUCK IT UP: The vacuum reservoir pro-
vides an added source of vacuum for 
those long uphill grades. 
Many late-model cars have throttle 
plates connected directly to an actua-
tor controlled by the engine manage-
ment computer. There is no physical 
connection between your right foo t 
and the throttle blades (Scary, eh?), 
and there mayor may not be a sepa-
rate cruise control servo or controller. 
How fast was I going, officer? 
If you still have no engagement, there 
may be an issue with the cruise con-
trol's speed input. Modern cars use 
information from the ABS's vehicle 
speed sensor (VSS) because the engine-
WHERE'S THIS THING?: Speed sensor 
may be buried under the dash near 
speedo head. 
management computer needs to know 
road speed. If your Check Engine light 
is on, the cruise may not work, espe-
cially if the VSS is malfunctioning. 
Older vehicles may use speed informa-
tion from the speedometer. Aftermar-
ket systems ma y resort to a ring of 
magnets clamped to a driveshaft or 
axle shaft, with a magnetic coil posi-
tioned nearby. If the magnets have 
fallen off or the coil has been smashed 
by a rock or road debris, there's no 
speed data for the controller. 
Urban Legend 
The legend has been related to us by 
all manner of people, including a 
couple of state po lice officers. Using 
the cruise control in rainy or slick 
conditions will make your car speed 
up uncontrollably, until you lose con-
trol and crash. It's a myth. Engaging 
the cruise will not make the car speed 
up. The cruise will attempt to main-
tain a steady speed. If the wheels lose 
traction and the car starts to slow 
down, the cruise will speed up the 
engine to attempt to accelerate back 
to the set speed. This will make the 
dri vewheels spin more briskl y. The 
vehicle speed will go slower, rega rd-
less of how furiously the wheels spin. 
If you have a rea r-wheel-drive car, the 
effect is to destabilize the vehicle, and 
you probably will spin out unless the 
vehicle regains traction in a reason-
able length of time. A front-wheel-
drive car with spinning tires will 
attempt to continue in a more or less 
straight line- which will make steer-
ing control dodgy at best. 
H eavy ra in or snow makes use of 
the cruise control inadvisable, but 
such conditions certainly won't 
make your car accelerate to ludi-
crous speeds while you hang on fo r 
dear life. If the cruise is engaged and 
yo u perceive a loss of traction, the 
best bet is to tap the brake to disen-
gage the system, and then add just 
enough throttle to maintain steering 
until the vehicle slows down to a 
more appropriate speed. t6

Changing A Fuse 
I
t's a da rk a nd stormy night. 
Made even darker because the 
head lights o n yo ur car ha ve 
suddenly quit. The car runs fine-
but yo u have to ha ve it towed to a 
garage . Tow: $85. Labor to replace 
headlight fuse: $25 . One lO-amp 
blade-style fuse: 65 cents. The rea l-
ization the next morning that th ere 
was a spare fuse a lready in the fuse 
box that yo u cou ld have swapped 
in you rself for free in a few sec-
onds: Priceless. 
Better To Light 
A Single Candle 
Modern cars and trucks are heavil y 
dependent on their electrical systems. 
The one in your car probably gener-
ates more power than was available in 
your great-grandfather's entire house. 
You might find three different fuse 
boxes on your vehicle, and dozens of 
fuses. Unlike domestic (house) electri-
cal panels, which rely 0 11 reusab le, 
resettable circuit breakers, most auto-
motive circuits use disposable, one-
time-only fuses. The onl y automotive 
applications that we're aware of that 
use circuit breakers use self-resetting 
breakers, which will cycle automati-
cally every few seconds. 
Fuse basics 
Let's start with the basics. Any electri-
ca l component uses a certain amount 
of power to accomplish its task. Take, 
for example, a 2l-watt brake-light 
bulb. Two of these add up to 42 
wa tts, which at your car's nominal 
ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS 

operating voltage of 14 volts is about 
3 amps of current. Suppose the wires 
to the lamp socket were chafed and 
the bare wire touched some exposed 
metal, shorting the circuit to ground. 
The current draw could instantly rise 
to dozens of amps- and in a few sec-
onds the wiring harness would 
become a smoking, charred ruin-if it 
weren't for the fuse. The fuse is 
designed to carry a precise amount of 
current and no more. Ask it to do 
more, and a sma ll wire or strip of 
metal inside it melts rapidl y, sparing 
the rest of the wiring. And then you 
can find the short, repa ir it and 
replace the fuse for a few cents. 
Fuses sometimes fai l for what 
seems to be no good reason. Go fig-
ure. One common scenario is when a 
marker lamp or head lamp burns o ut. 
The melting filament in the bulb can 
momentaril y short the contacts inside 
the bulb just as it vaporizes, sucking 
enough current to pop the fuse. You'll 
need to replace the bulb and the fuse. 
CHANGING A FUSE 
You'll need pliers or some sort of tool 
to pull the fuse out of its spot. 
Gone Fishing 
Not sure which fuse is popped 
because you don't have a chart? You 
could always pull all of them, one at a 
time, and inspect them. A faster way 
is to use a voltmeter or test light. T he 
conductors inside blade-type fuses are 
exposed at the upper surface. Start by 
turn ing on the ignition and the circuit 
you're trying to troubleshoot. Con-
nect the ground wire of your 
meterltest I igh t to a good chassis 
ground point-one with bare meta l. 
Touch the probe to the fuse's exposed 
conductor. A good fuse wi ll show 
voltage on both sides. A blown one 
wi ll be electrically dead on one side. 
What Amps? 
Fuses are carefull y manufactured to 
permit only a calibrated amount of 
current to flow. Replace a blown fuse 
with one with a higher amperage rat-
ing at your own risk. You could cause 
a meltdown in the wiring harness-
, 
which wi ll in turn cause more S h~

circuits, some of w hich may not be 
protected by other fuses. You may 
need to replace the entire wiring har-
ness, or you may start an electrical fire 
that destroys your entire car or truck. 
Now that I've got your attenti on, 
I'll backpedal and say that in an emer-
gency I once had to replace a blown 
IS-amp with a 20-amp beca use that 
was the only spare in the fuse box. 
But first thing the next morning I 
replaced the fuse with the correct 
one-which promptly blew. The fuel 
pump was drawing tOo much current 
because the fue l fi lter was dirty, but 
that's a differe nt Saturday Mechanic. 
There are three sizes of blade-style 
fu ses-mini, normal and maxi. And 
they are all color-coded: normal-size 
lO-amp fuses are red and IS-amp 
fu ses are blue, and so on. Just to con-
fuse the issue, the color-coding is dif-
fere nt for the maxi sizes. Don't make a 
mistake and assume a red fuse is 
always 10 amps. Add itional warn ing: 
Don't assume the last person to 
replace a fu se did so with one of the 
correct rating, even if he was a profes-
sional. As always, you can look in the 
owner's manua l-and probably on the 
fuse chart on the fuse box cover-for 
the correct rating. 
No Spares? 
Some vehicle manufacturers do not 
provide spare fuses or even a place in 
the fu se panel to stOre them. Even if 
there are spa res in yo ur fuse box, 
there are probably only a couple, and 
not one of every va lue. Go to the autO 
parts department o r autO parts stOre 
and buy a fuse kit. For less than 10 
bucks you ca n get a box containing 
an assortment of fu ses with a fuse 
puller inside. Leave this in your glove-
box to keep it dry and clean . t;

IFFICULT 
Curing Premature Brake Wear 
Y
Ou' re taking a pleasant ride in 
the country, enj oying your ca r's 
performance. A stop sign. You 
step unhurriedly on the brake pedal-
wh at the heck? You let o ff and try 
again. There's no mistake. You hear a 
high-pitched squeal th at you recog-
ni ze as a pad wear indicator sounding 
off. Those front linings are going, 
gOlllg, gone. 
That wo uldn't be so troubling 
except that you distinctl y remember 
doing a brake job less than a year 
ago. H ey, what's going on ? 
Low-Life Linings 
Thirty yea rs ago w hen disc brakes 
were becoming common, we were 
impressed by how long linings lasted. 
Not anymore. Ma ny late model ca rs 
and trucks eat their pads quickl y. The 
tendency is to blame new fricti on 
material formulas fo r accelera ted pad 
wear, but the real reason is usua ll y 
someth i ng else al together. 
Now, you've got overdri ve, a low-
fricti on V6 and an aerodynamic design 
that not onl y lets the ca r coast fa rther, 
but also cuts airflow to the brakes. 
Another factor in the short-li ved 
pad scenari o is the SUV phenomenon. 
A typical Blazer or Explorer might 
weigh 4800 pounds, but the brakes 
are not enough better than those 
designed for the 3000-pound pickups 
most of these vehicles evolved from. ft 
doesn't take much of an intellectual 
leap to see that even normal driving 
amounts to heavy-duty service. 
Take a Proactive Role 
What ca n you do to extend the life 
of th ose brakes ? First off, buy the 
highest-qu ality brand -name linings 
you can find. These may be " full -
ceramic," have ceramics added to the 
semimetallic mix, or have a sacrifi-
cial titanium coating that speeds 
break-in and improves initia l feel. 
216 
Innards and

Even the most diligent 
person in this regard is 
still going to have prob-
lems if the self adjusters 
of the rear discs aren't 
operating. Typically, 
corrosion and contami-
nati on jam the piston 
and immobilize the 
screw mechanism.

That's not, however, a ll there is to 
the jo b by a long shot. Yo u've got to 
look at the brake system as a whole. 
Ma ny motorists just don't use 
the parking brake. Some may think it's 
an emergency stopping system only. 
But w ith many common rear-disc 
designs and some rea r drums, lining-
to-rotor/drum adjustment 
simply doesn't occur unless the park-
ing brake is applied (a symptom is a 
low pedal). So, adopt the sensible habit 
of engaging this device every time you 
park instead of just depending on Park 
to keep the car from rolling away.

ware is frequently faulty. 
tured uni ts, saying th at it wasn 't 
wo rth the la bo r and headache to 
pull them apart and put in a kit-it's 
ha rd to get the adjusting mechanism 
to wo rk properl y. G reat, except 
ca lipers can be expensi ve in som e 
cases. That's the price you pay for 
driving a modern car and neglecting 
maintenance. 
W hat maintenance is that? Brake 
flui d changes, of course. W ith th at 
pa rking brake/self-adjustment mecha-
nism present and immersed, intern al 
corrosion is to be strenuously 
avoided. Ergo, periodic fluid changes 
are even more important th an with 
disc/drum systems. This has been 
advised by many import manufactur-
ers fo r decades, and is now starting to 
show up in the service recommenda-
ti ons fo und in the owner's manuals of 
domestics. 
This car-care item can save you 
seri ous money in the long run . Besides 
disc brake intern als, consider ABS. 
Corrosion and debris in the contro l 
unit ca n result in a disastrously 
expensive repair-$1500 isn't 
unusua l! Use a turkey baster to get 
most of the old stuff out of the master 
cylinder reservoir, refill it with fresh, 
then use a clea r bottle and hose setup

(Fig. 3) A partially clogged brake line 
can let pressure build up in the caliper. 
at each of the bleeders and pump unti l 
you see a nice, clean liquid appea r. D o 
this every other yea r. 
Beaten Drums 
Rear drum brakes often shirk their 
duty, too, resulting in burned-up front 
pads. Seized star-wheel screws (Fig. 1) 
and oth erw ise inoperative self 
adjuster s (Fig. 2) are practica ll y an 
epidemic, so you 're asking for acceler-
ated front lining wear if you don't 
inspect and lubricate the hardware 
involved, and replace any items 
you're dubious about (frayed or 
fatigued ca bles, for instance). 
W e fixed a car recentl y that had 
fried pads and a badl y grooved rotor 
on one side. It rurns out the hose was 
p lugged-it allowed pressure to 
gradua lly build up in the caliper, and 
then the piston couldn't retract (Fig. 3). 
Another possible ca use of drag is over-
filling the ma ster reservoir, 
w hich can appl y th e brakes as the 
fluid expands. 
Broken In 
or Just Broken? 
We know people who still believe 
that the right w ay to sea t new linings 
is to rea ll y stand on th e brakes a few 
times. That 's an anachronistic idea 
HOW IT WORKS 
left over from the days w hen 
linings were supplied 
"green. " Panic stops would 
indeed get th at fricti on 
material hot enough to cure 
it. But you don't get 
uncooked pads and shoes 
from manufacturers any-
more, so this w hole idea 
belongs to a bygone era, a 
time of ignition points and 
bias ply tires. 
There's no wa y to 
overemphasize the impor-
tance of proper lining break-
in (some authorities say 
overl ooking this procedure is the No. 
1 ca use o f noise and hard pedal com-
pl aints) . The idea l way to start new 
linings off is to make 30 slow stops 
(spaced 2 minutes apart) from about 
30 mph using light to m oderate pres-
sure. You may not be wi lling to take 
that much time, but yo u'd be foolish 
not to make at least 10 moderate

much damage that it's sur-

is too flimsy to cause any damage to 
the disc, unlike the rivets, which will 
grind away at that nice stopping sur-
face, leaving wide, deep grooves. 
With bonded linings, the steel pad 
plates will do the same, and have 
been called "full-mets" by brake 
guys with a twisted sense of humor. 
CURING PREMATURE BRAKE WEAR 
By the time you hear and feel either, 
considerable rotor damage has

A slightly higher-tech 
variation on this theme 
is the electrical pad 
wear warning system, 
which first appeared a 
couple of decades ago 
on such cars as Toyotas 
and Mercedes. Here, 
the pad is drilled for an 
electrical contact that 
stands slightly proud of 
the lining rivets. When 
wear reaches the point 
that this touches the 
rotor, the ground circuit 
to a Brakes warning 
light on the dash is completed, and 
the lamp winks on. Again, unfortu-
nately, some companies that manu-
facture replacements for these appli-
cations don't bother to include the

smooth o ut), then avoid heavy brak-
ing for the first 200 miles. 
What if one pad is worn-out, but 
the other still has lots of friction 
material left? Think about the way a 
single-piston caliper operates. The 
piston pushes one side directl y against 
the disc, and this action pulls the 
other side into contact. If anything 
interferes with the sliding or floating 
movement that transfers and divides 
the force, only the pad that the piston 
actuall y bears on will wear. So, every 
time you put in a new lining, clean 
and lubricate the machined grooves of 
sliding calipers, using special brake 
grease (Fig. 4). Ditto for the bushings 
and pins or bolts of the floating vari-
ety, and make sure any rubber pans 
are in good shape.

Don't force ca liper pistons 
back for pad replacement without 
opening the bleeder. T he line comes in 
near the bottom of the cylinder where 
the sediment is, and this forces debris 
up into the ABS unit-often resulting 
in a glowing antilock warning light. In 
fact, many brake experts say just open-

MODERATE 
Replacing a Parking Brake Cable 
Y
Ou've just parallel-parked your 
manual-transmission car on a 
steep side street, carefully set-
ting the parking brake by pulling it 
up farther than you've ever pulled 
before. So fa r that it actually pops a 
little as it edges up that last click. 
Exiting the vehicle, you turn to lock 
the door-j ust as your car slides for-
ward 3 ft. and nudges the luxury car 
in front of yo u in the bumper. Setting 
off the alarm. Hurriedly, you restart 
your car and back up to your original 
position, determined to pull the 
brake up far enough to anchor the 
Titanic this time. Unfortunately, this 
time the hand brake offers no resis-
tance whatsoever until the mecha-
nism tops out-and yo u have no 
parking brake at all, forcing you to 
find a flat parking space three streets 
away and walk through the rain to 
your job interview. 
Not to mention having to replace 
the parted handbrake cable. 
Why It Failed 
Parking brakes are operated by a 
long, steel cable that runs between the 
handle in the cockpit and the rear 
wheels. It has crimped-on ends that 
can potentially slip off (unusual but 
not unknown). More commonly, the 
rubber-covered outer cable that runs 
between the car and the rear brakes 
tears or sp lits, allowing moisture and 
road salt to corrode through the inner 
steel cable. Sooner or later, the cor-
roded cable fails under tension. 
Live in the desert where it's flat, 
and never use your parking brake? Or 
maybe you have an automatic trans-
mission and just put your car in Park. 
Then you face another issue-the 
ca ble needs to be exercised regularly 
or it will seize up. So you should use 
the parking brake regularly. Ever have 
trouble getting your transmission out 
of Park when parking on a grade 
(Fig. 1) Unlike the two separate 
cables shown on page 190, this 
vehicle uses an equalizer bar to 
distribute the pull to both rear 
wheels equally. This means 
three potential adjustments.

because the parking pawl in the 
tranny is jammed against its gear? Set-
ting the parking brake before purring 
the trans in Park and letting the car 
roll forward will prevent this. 
Getting Dirty 
First, you need to determine which 
cable has parted. Remove the boot 
over the mechanism between the sea ts 
and see which cable is slack. If there's 
only a single ca ble to the handle, you'll 
often need to pull up the rear sear and 
look for the equalizer bar (Fig. 1). One 
cable to the bar will be easy to pull 
straight out. Warning! Parking brake 
cables are generally lubricated with 
thick black grease that will get every-
where, and generally destroy your car 
interior and your clothes. Be ready 
with rags to contain the mess. 
Now, you need to check the outer 
cable that leads to the rear wheel. If 
it's damaged, you'll need to replace 
that as well. You may have no option 
if the inner and outer cable are sold as 
REPLACING A PARKING BRAKE CABLE 
an assembly, which they often are. To 
actually look at the outer cable, you'll 
need to get under the car. This means 
either backing onto ramps or jacking 
up the car and resting it on jacksta nds. 
If you're using jackstands, loosen the 
lug nuts fi rst. (Never get under a car 
that's lifted on a jack, even a floor 
jack.) Be sure to block the wheels. 
Check the outer cable, which leads 
from the backing plate of the brakes 
over to the car body. Don't confuse it 
with the brake hydraulic line, which 
is a steel tube connected to the body 
at some point with a short rubber 
hose. The brake cable will be much 
thicker and rubber-covered along its 
whole length. Look for cracks, abra-
sions and deteriorated rubber, and 
don't forget both sides-if the other 
side is damaged you may as well 
replace both cables now. 
Inside the Brake Drum 
Once you've determined which 
cable(s) to replace, get the car up in

cable is usually done at the handle inside 
the car. You may need to hold the new 
cable with locking pliers to keep it from

adjuster nut. 
the air and the wheel or wheels off. 
Now you need to remove the brake 
drum. Generally, the drum is simply 
sandwiched between the axle flange 
and the wheel, retained by a small 
sheetmetal clip or Phillips setscrew to 
keep it from landing on your foot 
when you remove the wheel. Occa-
sionally, they will become intimately 
attached to the hub and need per-
suading. Judicious application of pen-
etrating oil, light hammer taps near 
the hub, profanity and moderate heat 
will see them loosen. You may need to 
back off the adjuster mechanism to 
get the shoes out of the way if the 
drum has developed a wear ridge on 
the inner lip. 
Now you can see the brake shoes 
and mechanism. (This might be a 
220 
good time to replace the shoes if 
they're worn down to anywhere near 
the rivets). If you're replacing only the 
inner cable, simply disassemble the 
mechanism fa r enough to pull out the 
old cable and thread the new one into 
place. If you need to replace the outer 
cable as well, it's probably pretty well 
rusted onto the backing plate. Spray it 
with penetrating oil, and twist with 
pliers until it lets loose. Some cables 
are retained by snap rings or a small 
collet-style clip-check the new cable 
for its attachment style. 
Clean It Up 
N ow's your chance to wire brush rust 
and dirt from all the hardware and 
mating surfaces on the brake mecha-
nism, and sparingly lubricate all the 
moving parts with antiseize com-
pound or high-temp grease. Replace 
any suspicious hardware like springs 
and clips. Be sure to clean the mating 
surface of the axle flange and brake 
drum, to prevent foreign matter from

keeping the drum from seating prop-
erly on the flange. Lightly lube the 
mating surfaces with antiseize so you 
won't have to cuss the next time you 
need to take it apart. Reinstall the 
brakes and drum, hooking up the new 
cable to the actuating arm. Adjust the 
brake shoes properly if you needed to 
back off the adjuster. 
CHASSIS 

Back Inside 
Now it's time to hook up the inner 
ca ble's fo rward end (Fig. 2). If it didn't 
come with a new nut, you'll have to 
rescue the old one. It may be a lock-
nut, or there may simply be two nuts 
jammed together. T hread the th readed 
end of the cable into the equa lizer bar 
or the handle, and lightly run the nut 
down. Pu ll the handle up (or depress 
the pedal) three clicks, and then 
tighten the adjusting nut until the 
wheel lightl y scra pes as you rotate it. 
T his assumes you had the brake shoes 
adjusted correctly a nd they don't 
scrape with the handle down.

correctly adjusted, and then you 
adjust the ha ndbra ke, bad things can 
happen. As the bra ke shoes' auto-
matic adjuster mechanism (Fig. 3) 
kicks in over the next few days, the 
slack in the hand brake ca ble wil l 
gradua ll y disappeal; a nd your brakes 
wi II sta rt to drag. Be ca reful fo r the 
first few days that the hand bra ke 
retains two or three clicks of free p lay.

sepa rate cables with no equa lizer bar, 
adjust the indi vidual ca bles so both 
rear wheels have equal tensio n when 
the brakes a re actuated. 
Four-wheel Discs 
If your car has fo ur-wheel disc brakes, 
your job is simpler, because the attach-

rear disc brakes actually have a small

Self-adjusting Brakes 
Self·adjusting brakes are 
universal now, except for 
some elderly Volkswagens 
still on the road. The service 
brakes are act uated by a 
hydraulic cylinder that forces 
the two shoes apart, jam-
ming them into the inner 
diameter of the brake drum.

wore down. This self·adjust mecha-
nism is actuated by the slight verti-
cal movement of the t railing brake 
shoe that occurs whenever the

the first stop sign you draw a startled

in the carpet under the pedal. Didn't

ca ll y, low-pedal trouble develops so 
gradua lly that people don't realize it. 
Hydraulic brakes have been 
around since Duesenberg introduced 
them in 1921, but apparently a long 
history is no defense against 
trou bles. And professionals and do-
it-yourselfers alike are often guilty 
of misd iagnosis-they blame the 
master cylinder, though it is seldom 
the cu lprit. 
There are only two plausible rea-
sons for a low pedal: air in the sys-
tem; and excessive movement 
between linings and rotors or drums 
(due to lack of adjustment, an out-

that's knocking the pistons back so 
that there's extra space to take up 
before braking action begins). 
Isolation 
You can find out all you need to 
know about the master cylinder by 
removing the lines, screwing brass or 
plastic plugs into the outlets, and 
then applying the brakes. If the 
pedal's high and hard now, the mas-
ter has been properly bled and its 
seals are okay. The pedal would sink 
gradually if it were bypassing-that 
is, if fluid were finding its way 
around the sliding seals. You've also 
confirmed that the booster is okay.

wheel. Use a suitable rounded-jaw 
tool, either the locking-pliers type or 
one of those inexpensive J-hooks with 
a knurled screw. Releasing one at a 
time should locate the problem. 
Use That Parking Brake 
If you never engage the parking 
brake, self-adjustment of the pads 
and rotor simply won't occur, and 
that means a low pedal. Another 
impediment to adjustment is corro-
sion and contamination of the piston, 
cylinder and self-adjustment hard-
CHASSIS 

ware. So, change your habits and 
start using the parking brake every 
time you leave the car, and replace 
those calipers if they're not just right. 
H the parking brake isn't used regu-
larly, one of these days a parking lot 
attendant will apply it and your car 
will be immobilized until those cor-
roded cables and other seized parts 
are replaced. 
Beat the Drums 
Rear drum brakes can cause a low 
pedal, too. Seized star-wheel screws 
and otherwise inoperative self-
adjusters are all too common, and 
you're risking trouble if you don't 
replace the hardware when replacing 
shoes (Fig. 1). At the very least, clean 
the star-wheel threads and treat them 
to a coating of antiseize compound. 
There's another factor that's usu-
ally not recognized: drivers who never 
stop aggressively enough in Reverse

to ratchet the self-adjusters. It's a 
good idea to stomp on the brake 
pedal every week or so while backing 
up- preferably in a deserted lot or 
other safe place. 
What about the drums them-
selves? They're frequently out of 
HOW IT WORKS 
round (Fig. 2), leaving excess shoe-to-
drum clearance and, of course, caus-
ing pulsation. 
Bubble Trouble 
For all practical purposes, brake fluid 
is incompressible. Air, on the other 
hand, can be squeezed down into a 
smaller-than-natural volume, and its 
presence will disrupt the operation of 
any hydrau lic system. It promotes 
internal corrosion, too. Ergo, it must 
be expelled (Fig. 3). 
One possible cause of pedal prob-
lems is failure to bench bleed a new 
master cylinder (Fig. 4). Screw the 
supplied fittings into the outlets and 
place the tips of the tubes in the fluid 
in the reservoir. Clamp one of the 
master's mounting ears in a vise-
don't grip aro und the cylinder- so 
the unit is as level as possible. Use a 
rod or drift to stroke the piston 
slowly. Wait at least 15 seconds 
The Dual Master Cylinder 
Whether you call it the dual, split or tandem master 
cylinder, it has been used on every car sold in this 
country since 1967, although Cadillac had it in '62. 
Even so, most people don't understand its con-
struction and operation. A typical modern 
specimen is of the composite variety-
aluminum with a plastic reservoir-
but iron 1-piece units are still 
around on older vehicles. 
Two pistons ride in the 
bore, and here's where 
we encounter some 
potentially confusing 
terminology. The rear 
piston is the primary, 
the one in the front is 
the secondary. This 
apparent misnaming 
resulted because the rear pis-
ton is the first to receive the signal 
from the brake pedal, so it does make a cer-
tain amount of sense. Kind of. Each piston has a pri-
mary cup seal at its front and a secondary at its rear. 
In normal braking, the pushrod from the booster forces 
the primary piston forward. No pressure is created 
until the primary seal covers the compensating or vent 
DEALING WITH A LOW BRAKE PEDAL 
port from the reservoir, but once it does fluid is 
trapped in the chamber between the pistons and it 
becomes a solid column. Pressure is routed 
from this chamber to two wheels. A 
combination of the trapped fluid and 
the primary piston coil 
spring bears on the sec-
ondary piston, to which 
the line to the other two 
wheels is attached. The 
replenishing ports allow 
fluid to move freely between 
the chambers behind both 
pistons' primary cups and the 
reservoir, determined by 
demand and expansion 
and contraction from 
temperature changes. 
If a hose lets go or a 
saboteur has sawed 
through one of the brake 
lines, the other half will 
still provide a means of decelerating the vehicle, albeit 
with a lower pedal and reduced stopping power. This 
protective function is, of course, the dual master's 
reason for being. 
223 

between strokes to allow the low-
pressu re chamber to release all its 
bubbles and fi ll completely. Keep 
stroking until there's no more ev i-
dence of air at the ports and tube tips. 
If the car has a replacement cylin-
der that somebody didn't bench bleed, 
you might be able to do it with the 
master in place, provided you can 
jack the rear of the vehicle high 
enough to get the cylinder to be level. 
Aga in, pump slowly and allow time 
between strokes. 
An important precaution to 
observe during any bleeding pro-
cedure that involves pumping the 
pedal is to limit pedal travel. You 
don't wa nt the delicate lips of the mas-
ter cylinder's piston seals to ride so 
deep in the bore that they encounter 
rough corrosion or deposits, which 
can scratch them. Just throw a chunk 
of 2 x 4 on the floor under the pedal. 
When it comes to the bleeders at 
224 
the wheels, most people just open 
them and let the fluid sq uirt. Not only 
wi ll this result in sli ppery puddles on 
the floor, the fluid can shoot farther 
than you might expect-think about 
the 2S00-plus psi of line pressure on 
some ABS-equipped cars. Brake fluid 
is a pretty effective paint remover, and 
it really burns when you get it in your 
eye. Wea r eye protection. 
One convenient setup is a tube and 
transparent bottle kept half fu ll of 
fresh fluid (Fig. 5). There are also 
inexpensive I-man bleeder hoses that 
contain a I-way valve to eliminate the 
possibility of air being drawn back in 
when you release the pedal. 
The bleeder cups and hoses that 
are often included in manual vacuum 
pump kits, such as those from M ighty 
Yac, work well. Once again, you can 
see what you're getting, and you don't 
have to keep climbing into the seat to 
pump the pedal. 
(Fig. 5) The old-fashioned, low-tech 
way to bleed brakes is to use a jelly jar 
half full of brake fluid, a short piece of 
hose, and a patient helper to depress 
the brake pedal. 
You should also be aware of spe-
cial procedures. For example, on 
Teves Mark II ABS systems, you can't 
get fluid to the rear brakes unless you 
turn the key on and then apply the 
peda l slightl y. Be sure to check the 
shop manual if your vehicle has an 
anti lock braking system. 
Finally, there's the bleeding 
seq uence. Since you're supposed to do 
the longest line in the circuit first, the 
traditional order is right rear, left rear, 
right front and left fro nt. But with the 
diagonally spli t systems you'll find 
mostly on fwd cars, the order is right 
rear, left front, left rear then right 
front. ABS-equipped cars may have 
special procedures to fo llow. (I

Your car stops, but you've swerved 
well into the adjacent lane, where, 
fortunately, an alert dri ver slowed and 
pulled over to give you some clea r-
ance. Too close. Your panic braking 
attempt should have had two differ-
ent results: Your car should have 
slowed more rapidly, and should have 
tracked in a straight line as it slowed. 
There's obviously something wrong. 
Check It Out 
Your car pulled to the left, but the 
problem is more likely to be at the 
right front wheel. It didn't brake as 
well as the left, so the car pulled in the 
opposite direction. 
Remove the wheel and take a look. 
Don't be surprised if you see that both 
shoes have a reasonable amount of 
brake lining left. The problem is more 
likely to be a bad caliper, that big 
hydraulic clamp that forces the brake 
shoes against the disc-brake rotor. 
SERVICING FRONT BRAKE CALIPERS 
Turn the forcing screw 
and the caliper should 
move smoothl y as the pis-
ton is pushed back. 
(Fig. 2) Some types of sliding calipers can be 
pushed back without removing them from the 
caliper mounts. Be sure it's not seized sliding sur-
faces that are binding, though. 
If the caliper passes this 
test, make one more (if you 
haven't already): Check the 
bleeder valve to be sure it 
loosens (Fig. 1). If it doesn't, 
you can drill it out and install 
a replacement. But this can 
be a difficult operation, and 
installing a remanufactured 
caliper is a safer bet. If the 
caliper binds or moves only 
with unusual effort, there are 
two possibilities: The caliper 
piston is frozen in place (the 
Most cars have sliding calipers with 
a single hydraulic piston. When you 
step on the brake pedal and that pis-
ton is pushed out, it forces the inner 
brake shoe against the inner side of 
the rotor. The caliper simultaneously 
slides inward, pulling the brake shoe 
in the outer side of the caliper against 
the outer surface of the rotor. Some 
cars have fixed calipers with one or 
two pistons in each side of the caliper 
(two or four pistons total). When you 
step on the pedal, all of the pistons 
force the brake shoes against the rotor. 
Check the brake fluid level in the 
reservoir and if it's been topped up to 
maximum level, siphon out a small 
amount (otherwise it may overflow 
during the test). Set up the clamp so 
the top edge of the C is against the 
midpoint of the inboard side of the 
caliper (behind the piston ) with the 
ti p of the forcing screw directly oppo-
site. Depending on the shape of the 
caliper, the forcing screw could also 
bear against the back side of the out-
board brake shoe or even against the 
rotor surface. If the vehicle has anti-
lock brakes, loosen the brake bleeder

which the bolts go, or rusted sliding 
"ways" (guides) in the anchor that holds 
the caliper. You'll have to remove the 
caliper to see. 
Sliding Caliper 
Taking off a sliding ca liper is a 
straightforward operation (Fig. 2). 
Usually there are two bolts that hold 
it to its anchor frame. Or, there's a 
single bolt at the bottom and a locat-
ing stud at the top, a design called a 
flip up. Clamp off the brake hose 
close to the ca liper with a C-c1amp or 
padded locking pliers to minimize loss 
of brake fluid and to reduce the neces-
sity of after-the-job bleeding. Next, 
loosen the bolt that holds the hose to 
the caliper. Remove the bolt or bolts 
holding the ca liper. 
If the ca liper is the type that is held 
in machined guides, there are two 
common setups. There is a lower 
guide that can be unbolted and driven 
off the anchor. Do this, and then lift 
the caliper up from the bottom of the 
anchor and off the upper guide. Or, 
225 

226 
there are bolt-on retainers at the top 
and bottom to hold the caliper against 
the guides. Remove both, then pull 
the caliper away from the anchor. 
Replacement 
With the caliper off the bracket, 
unthread the brake-hose banjo bolt 
and catch any drops of fluid with a 
rag. Install a replacement caliper, 
using new sealing washers for the 
brake hose (Fig. 3). Many caliper 
bolts are not recommended for reuse, 
so if the vehicle manufacturer says 
this is the case, get new ones (Fig. 4). 
Making It Slide 
If the caliper piston returns smoothl y, 
you'll likely find that the ca liper isn't 
sliding properly because the move-
ment of the caliper bolts is hindered 
by corrosion or sticking in the caliper 
ear bushings. Or, the machined 
guides are rusted. You can use a wire 
brush to remove rust from the guides 
(and the caliper edges), then lubricate 
both with suitable water-repellent 
grease. Heavy rust may 
require a light touchup 
with a file. However, if 
the bolts are sticking in 
the bushings, replace 
them, and lubricate with 
the same type of grease. 
If the O-rings are 
deteriorated, replace 
them, or they could 
allow the bushings to 
cock. In any case, clean 
the caliper ears, then 
relubricate the O-rings. 
The Details 
(Fig. 3) Always replace any copper sealing washers 
on brake line connections with new ones. 
Don't leave out any dust 
or moisture boots from the caliper 
ears. And if the old ones are deterio-
rated, replace them (they could be the 
cause for corrosion seizure of the slid-
ing caliper bolts in the bushings). If a 
sliding rear caliper is reusable and it 
incorporates the parking brake mech-
anism behind the piston, be sure to 
thread back the piston (turn back the 
internal screw mechanism). 
HOW IT WORKS 
Fixed Caliper 
With a fixed caliper, you won't 
know if the pistons are sticking 
until you take it off. So don't loosen 
the brake hose (although you 
should determine if the bleeder 
valve is frozen). Remove the mount-
ing bolts-usually just two but pos-
sibly four. Hang the caliper with 
wi re to re i ieve any tension on the 
Rear Disc Caliper with Parking Brake 
If the parking brake uses 
the rear disc-brake shoes 
instead of a separate set of 
drum-brake shoes, there is 
a mechanism in the caliper 
piston cylinder to push the 
piston and apply the rear 
brakes when the driver 
operates the linkage. That 
mechanism, which is con-
nected to the parking brake 
linkage, has a screw setup 
to compensate for the fact 
that in normal foot-brake 
operation, the piston auto-
matically moves out to 
adjust for brake-shoe lining 
wear. The type shown here 
is a common design. There is a cone behind the piston 
and it moves with the piston when the foot brake is 
applied. When the parking brake is operated, the brake 
lever turns the screw on which it is mounted (it also is 
an adjusting screw threaded through an adjusting nut). 
Rear calipers with park-
ing brakes require special 
techniques to retract the 
pistons at pad replace-
ment time. 
The nut can't turn 
because it's splined into 
the cone. With the 
inboard brake shoe in 
place, the piston (and 
shoe) can't turn either. 
So the lever operation 
causes the piston to be 
pushed out to apply the 
disc-brake shoes. When 
the lining wears, some 
clearance develops 
between the piston/cone and the nut. When the foot 
brake is released, hydraulic pressure in the caliper 
cylinder also is released. The adjusting spring then 
causes the nut to thread out on the adjusting screw to 
take up the clearance.

no leak and the problem isn't at the

front of you saves a collision, but you 
know something is wrong with the 
antilock braking system, a.k.a. ABS. 
The shop gives you the bad news: 
The actuator is defective, and you can 
figure on $1400 for a replacement (or 
even worse, it's part of an integrated 
unit with the brake master cylinder 
and the price is even higher) . No, it 
didn't log an ABS trouble code, but 
that doesn't mean anything. It's not a 
bad connection and it's not a factory 
defect. What caused it? Maybe even 
the technician will shrug his shoul-
ders, but there's a good chance it's 
contaminated brake fluid . 
The brake fluid reservoir is vented, 
so that's an entry point for dirt and 
moisture. And the rubber brake hoses 
are permeable-they allow even more 
moisture to get into the fluid. Dirt and 
moisture move through the lines. 
Most goes to the calipers and wheel 
cylinders, and some may get to the 
ABS actuator, where it can cause the 
delicate solenoids or motors inside to 
behave erratically. 
And if you or the shop does a disc 
caliper brake job, and someone pushes 
back the caliper pistons, the possibili-
ties are ominous. A lot of the dirty, 
moisture-laden fluid in the calipers is 
228 
pushed back, where some of it gets 
into the ABS actuator. The prospects 
for an ABS failure go up, up, up. 
Even if you don't have ABS, conta-
minated brake fluid can affect caliper 
and wheel cylinder bores. The older 
systems with the reservoir built into 
the master cylinder are even more 
prone to contamination, because the 
reservoir cover gasket may ha ve taken 
a set and be leaking. Or a lot of dirt 
ma y ha ve gotten into the system when 
the cover was removed as part of a 
brake job. Even simple moisture in 
the fluid is a real problem, because the 
heat of braking will cause it to boil, 
causing brake fade. 
Flushing the system is not a diffi-
cult job. There is equipment for a one-
man bleeding job, but the good stuff is 
expensive and we have reservations 
about trying to use the low-cost alter-
natives (hose with a one-way valve, 
and manual vacuum pump are exam-
ples). A simpler, effective approach is 
to have a helper step on the brake 
pedal. If you can line up someone, the 
only equipment you need is: 
• Ramps or jack and stands to raise 
the vehicle a few inches in front and 
back, so you have access to the 
bleeder valves. However, it's possible 
to reach them on some vehicles with 
the wheels on the ground. 
• Piece of clear hose to fit on the 
bleeder valve. 
• Tight-fitting wrench for the bleeder 
(like a tubing wrench). Don't use an 
ordinary open-end wrench. 
• Spray can of automotive cleaning sol-
vent and a spray can of penetrating oil. 
• Turkey baster to draw fluid out of 
the reservoir. A baster costs under $1, 
so don't try to clean and reuse one 
from the kitchen. 
• A pint container of brake fluid for 
an econobox, a quart for a larger car. 
The brake fluid may be labeled DOT 
3 (minimum boiling point of 400°F), 
DOT 4 (minimum boil of 450°) or 
even DOT 5.0 or 5.1 (500°F). Your 
system contains DOT 3 or DOT 4. 
These twO are fully compatible, so 
you can mix them without worry, and 
one of these is what you should use. 
Brake fluid is hygroscopic, which 
means it's like a sponge. But it's 
supposed to be, so if any moisture can 
get in, the fluid embraces it. However, 
moisture causes the normal boiling 
point of the fluid to drop. Just 2 % 
moisture in a fluid is considered 
excessive. There are moisture testers, 
but we don't know a repair shop 
CHASSIS 

that has one. And there's no guar-
antee that the moisture level in the 
reservoir is the same as at the ca liper-
it ma y be higher at the ca liper. 
Warning: T here are silicone brake 
fluids (labeled DOT 5) that are 
immune to moisture (5. 1 is nonsili-
cone, but DOT 3 and 4 are what you 
should use). Don't even think about 
using DOT 5 silicone fluid in an auto-
motive braking system, because it 
may ca use faster wear of the seals, 
and if enough water gets into a system 
it could ca use loss of pedal. DOT 5 
and 5.1 have application in some rac-
ing vehicles. 
Flush Twice 
Now for the flushing job itself: Raise 
the vehicle a few inches on ramps or 
w ith a jack and stands. 
Begin by cleaning the master cylin-
der's brake fluid reservoir (or top and 
sides of the master cylinder with the 
integral reservoir), using aerosol 
cleaning solvent and paper towels or 
a clean rag (Fig. 1). Don't remove the 
reservoir cover unri I the area is 
squeaky clean. 
If it's an older 
style-
the master 
cylinder with the inte-
gra l reservoir-you'll 
find a rubber gasket. 
Inspect the perimeter for deteriora-
tion and r eplace the gasket if 
necessary. Otherwise, just clean it 
w ith som e fresh brake fluid. Siphon 
most of the fluid ou t of the reservoir 
(Fig. 2), then add fresh f luid up to the 
level mark. 
On front-drive vehicles, where the 
hydraulic system is split left 
frontlright rear and right front/left 
rear, start at the left rear w heel. Next, 
go to the right front, then right rear 
and last, the left front wheel. On rea r-
drives w ith a diagonal split, do the 
same. If the rear-dri ve split is 
front/rear, however, start at the right 
rear, then left rear, right front and Jeft 
front. The object is to begin at the 
w heel brake farth est away from the 
master cylinder and graduall y work 
toward the closest.

Testing Brake Fluid with Dip Strips 
If the brake fluid in the reservoir is obvi-
ously dirty, flush the system. If it isn't, flush 
if it contains excess moisture, which you 
now can determine with "reagent dip 
strips." Reagents are substances used in a 
chemical reaction to detect other sub-
stances, and Wet Check strips for brake 
fluid now are marketed by Wagner Brake. 
Insert the strip into the fluid, remove it in a 
second, wait 30 seconds and compare the 
change in color of the two pads with a 
chart. 
One pad merely identifies the type of 
fluid-DOT 3 or DOT 4. They're compatible, 
so this is not critical (and a SO/SO mixture of the two 
merely produced an 10 color close to that of DOT 4, in our 
tests). The pad closest to the end, however, turns tan if 
moisture content is excessive. 
We tested the strips in separate containers of DOT 3 
and DOT 4, with different percentages of water. With pure 
brake fluid, the color was in the definitely okay range: 
dark green. At 1.64% water content, there was a very 
FLUSHING YOUR BRAKE SYSTEM 
slight indication (some light-
ening of the green) that the 
fluids were less than pure. 
At 3.2S% water, there 
would be at least a 2S% drop 
in brake fluid boiling point 
with DOT 3. It could be 
as much as SO% with DOT 4. 
The color change to tan was 
unquestionable in three of 
four tests. In the fourth, 
there was some indication of less-than-per-
fect fluid-fuzziness in the light green-but 
not tan. 
At S% water the pad turned tan as soon as it was 
taken out of the fluid-we didn't even have to wait the 30 
seconds. Read the strip almost exactly 30 seconds after 
removal from the fluid. If you read it too early, you might 
get an okay indication with 3% water. If you put the strip 
down for a few minutes, it can absorb enough moisture 
from a humid room to indicate contaminated fluid when 
none is act ually present.

(Fig. 4). Some tapping 
on the wrench or p liers 
end with a hammer 
may help. 
When the bleeder 
just breaks loose, stop 
and push the end of the 
clear hose onto the 
bleeder nipple. Aim the 
other end of the hose 
into a clear glass or 
bottle (Fig. 5). 
(Fig. 5) A hose 
over the bleeder 
bolt will keep fluid 
off of your arm and 
out of your eyes. 
This will cause the level 
in the master cylinder 
reservoir to rise slightly. 
It may take 25 to 35 
pedal applications to do 
this, but when the level 
stops rising after a cou-
ple of dozen, that should 
be it. If you don't do 
this, the reservoir might 
overflow under some 
conditions. 
Put a block of wood 
under the pedal to pre-
vent the piston from 
bottoming our in the 
master cylinder. Then 
tell your helper to step 
(Fig. 4) You may 
need to use a 
special wrench. 
W hen you're done, a 
hard brake application 
should extinguish the 
brake warning light. 
And remember when 
you next do a disc brake 
on the pedal and press down gently 
but firml y. Open the bleeder valve and 
watch the fluid as it flows through the 
clear hose into the clear glass or bottle 
(Fig. 6). If you don't get any fluid 
movement at the rear brakes on a car 
with ABS, close the bleeder valve. 
H ave your helper turn on the ignition 
and apply the brakes once, then turn 
off the ignition and just lightly rest 
his/her foot on the pedal. Open the 
bleed valve slowly. If a stream of fluid 
flows fro m the valve, allow it to come 
for about 10 seconds, then close the 
va lve and add fluid to the master 
cylinde r. Depending on the system, 
the pressurized reservoir may push 
our enough fluid. O r the flow may 
continue only if the helper presses 
down on the pedal. On most cars, the 
flow will start and continue without 
the preliminaries-only the helper's 
foot pressing on the pedal. 
W hen the pedal hits the wood 
block, tell your helper to hold it there. 
If you had a lot of trouble loosening the 
bleeder, remove it completely. Apply a 
thin film of anti-seize compound to the 
threads of the bleeder valve, then rein-

stall and close the valve. Add fresh fluid 
to the master cylinder reservoir again 
and repeat the procedure. When the 
fluid color changes from grungy black 
to something closer to what the new 
fluid looks like, you can stop. Close the 
bleeder valve and go to the next wheel 
brake. Be very sure to add fresh brake 
fluid up to the level in the reservoir 
every single time. 
Before you do the fina l top-off, 
however, have your helper apply the 
brakes over and over, to exhaust the

to use a screw-type drum puller.

that's okay. Otherwise: 
• If the wheel is binding all the way 
around the rota.tion, the brakes aren't 
releasing properly. If that's the case, 
remove the drum and check for either 
one of two possibilities: 1. The brake 
shoes are not retracting fully beca use 
the return springs are weak, perhaps 
combined with the shoes hanging up 
on the backing plate; or 2. The auto-
matic adjuster for the shoes is over-
doing it. 
• If you get an intermittent scraping 
or binding, maybe the drums are our-
of-round, the shoes aren't retracting 
properly, a backing plate is warped or 
an axle problem exists. 
• If there's no hint of a scrape-
despite the fact that your rear brakes 
have been noisy or haven't been con-
tributing to the car's brak ing-they 
may need to be adjusted . If there's an 
access opening in the backing plate or 
drum, turn the adjuster until the shoes 
make light contact with the drum. 
Then rotate the wheel to see if the lin-
ing drag is relatively even all around. 
SERVICING DRUM BRAKES 
If you can't turn the ad juster, take off 
the drum to free it. 
Look As You listen 
To gain a better look at the brake 
drum, remove the tires and wheels. 
Now, as you turn the brake drum, 
eyeba ll its relationship to the back-
ing plate at various points. If the 
drum seems to move in and out or 
rock up and down-even slightly-
the wheel bearing is bad, or the 
wheel spindle or axle shaft is bent. If 
the drum appears to turn evenly but 
its relationship with the backing 
plate is uneven, perhaps the plate is 
bent-also not an unusual problem. 
(If you're not sure, compare one rear 
drum brake with the other to see if 
the appearance is different while 
turning it.) Either wa y, you'll have to 
pull the drums to confirm the ca use. 
Inspect the drum where the wheel 
mounts against it. If a wheel is 
deformed, the drum may be 
deformed as well. Also, compare the 
tire sizes side to side and front to 
rear. Odd-size tires can trigger a vehi-
cle's antilock brakes at the wrong 
time, affecting the rear-braking per-
but drums don't. And even if a 
drum is super-smooth, get it measured 
at a machine shop to see if it's out-of-
round, worn past specs or misshapen 
in some way. Norma lly (but not 
always), a faulty drum will create an 
uneven lining wear pattern or cause 
short lining life. 
Find a drum that needs cutting? 
Take both drums to the machine 
shop, and have an equal amount 
removed from each. There may not be 
enough metal remaining, which 
means new drums. After a drum is 
machined, clean it out with a de-
tergent and water solurion, then wipe 
it with a lintfree rag and a brake sol-
vent. Wipe until the rag comes clean, 
and let the drum dry. 
Next, inspect the linings. Even if 
they're thick enough to be left in (y, 
in. or more ), they may have a glazed 
surface and need replacing. Don't try 
to sand off the glaze. The linings 
ha ve undergone a chemical change 
from overheating, possibly combined 
with the effects of aging as well as 
climate. 
The linings may also be glazed 
because the brake shoes were drag-
ging. Perhaps the automatic adjust-

ment mechanism is bad-or someone 
keeps forgetting to release the parking 
brake before starting to drive. 
Running Out-Literally 
Did you encounter that intermittent 
scrape when you turned the drum in a 
pre-disassembly check? But despite the 
noise, did the drum and shoe hard-
ware seem to be good? This is the time 
to check for a bent spindle or axle 
shaft, and/or a bad bearing. Use a dial 
indicator (Fig. 2). (If you don't own an 
232 
indicator, you can rent one from an 
auto parts store or rental center.) 
To check the radial runout, mount 
the dial indicator on the suspension, 
body or chassis so that the plunger is 
against the edge of the spindle or 
shaft hub. Then turn the axle shaft or 
spindle. Caution: Turn the axle 
slowly, so you won't be foo led by a 
burr or nick on the hub-particularly 
one on the edge-as you're checking 
radial runout. To get an accurate 
reading, you may need to clean up 
some corrosion on the hub with sand-
paper or a wire brush. 
To check for lateral runout on axle 
shafts with a hub, relocate the dial 
indicator so the plunger is touching 
the outer face of a hub. Then turn the 
shaft again. 
Runout, in any case, should be 
within manufacturer's specs-typi-
cally just a few thousandths of an 
inch. If your brakes have objection-
able shudder, you'll probably find that 
the runout is .010 in. or greater. 
Putting It All Together 
Ready to insta ll new shoes, springs 
and other hardware that come in the 
typical drum-brake repair kit? Don't 
use a screwdriver or your neighbor's 
1S-year-old set of brake-spring pliers

to check with the car dealer-he may 
have a substitute lining (with a lower 
metal content) that's less affected by 
the cold weather. 
If pre-disassembly checks indicate 
a warped backing plate, don't try to 
bend it back into position-i nstall a 
new one. On many rear-drive Genera l 
Motors cars built from the late 1970s 
through the early 1990s, there may be 
another problem: wear in the cutout 
for the clip-held wheel cylinder. The 
resul t is a loose cylinder. If you can 
force it to rotate even slightly-say, 
by moderate prying on each end of 
the cylinder with a large screw-
driver-that's reason enough to install 
a new backing plate. 
The " by-the-book" method of 
replacing a brake backing plate on a 
rear-drive car is to remove the axle 
shaft. This is a tough job, so if you 
need a new plate, it's a lot easier to 
install an aftermarket 2-piece plate 
(ava ilable for many GM cars) (Fig. 5). 
Just loosen and cut the old one with a 
hacksaw and you can bolt on the new 
one without breaking a sweat. 
If the platforms on which the 
shoes slide are burred or rusty, 
they're probably a contributor (along 
with weak springs) to the shoes fa il-
ing to retract quickly- not to men-
tion overheating or premature wear. 
Smooth off the platforms using fine 
sandpaper, wipe clean and apply a 
coat of silicone dielectric grease. 
Also, you should sand smooth the 
edges of the new brake shoes where 
they ride on the platforms. 
If you saw a lot of road film on the 
inside of the backing plate, or evidence 
of water/snow entry in winter, seal up 
the back of the plate. If any inspection! 
adjustment covers are missing, buy and 
install replacements. And if you can see 
any light coming through the wheel 
cylinder cutout in the backing plate, 
seal it. 
Finally, bolt on the wheels and 
tighten them to specifica tion with a 
torque wrench, using a crisscross pat-
tern . T his is not only important for

EASY 
Solving Steering·Pull Problems 
Y
our personal trainer mentions 
that the diameter of yo ur left 
forearm is tw ice that of your 
right, unusual for a righthanded 
individua l. Popeye would be proud. 
And your spouse nags yo u constantl y 
to keep to the right lane of the free-
way, because you're always brushing 
the edge of the sho ulder in the fast 
lane at 5 under. Guess it's time to 
find out why your car pulls so hard 
to the left. 
The tire pressures are correct. You 
haven't bounced the front end into a 
concrete embankment or over a rocky 
road lately, so there's probably noth-
ing bent in the suspension/steering 
underbody. Is it just something you'll 
have to li ve with? Probably not. The 
sources of most pulls are pretty easy 
to pinpoint if you define the basic 
problem and systematically check the 
possible causes. 
First question: What kind of pull 
is it? That calls for a road test, made 
under precise conditions: correct tire 
pressures when the tires are cold, no 
wind and a smooth, level road (no 
crown). Drive at a steady speed 
(somewhere between 30 and 45 
mph), then shift into Neutra l. Next, 
when there's no traffic around, 
remove your hands from the steeri ng 
wheel. Note whether the pu ll occurs 
in gear and also in Neutral, and if 
your hands on the steering wheel 
make any difference. 
If the pull is most noticeable under 
acceleration and goes away when you 
shift into Neutral, it's called torque 
steer. And, yes, torque steer also can 
occur at steady speeds. If it occurs 
with the transmission in Neutra l, it's a 
typical pull. Still no pull or torque 
steer? Make a turn and allow the car 
to return to facing straight ahead. 
Then, repeat the test to see if the car 
pulls in the same direction as the turn 
that was made. This is called memory

steer, and you'll see that it's most 
obvious when you take your hands 
off the steering wheel. 
Torque Steer 
Torque steer results from more possi-
ble causes than any other source of 
pull, so it's tougher to isolate. If you 
have a powerful engine and you mash 
the throttle, some torque steer-par-
ticularly on acceleration-is normal. 
Transverse-engine front-drive cars 
with high-performance engines are par-
ticularly prone to torque steer, although 
proper suspension design helps mini-
mize it. When significant torque steer is 
evident, something is wrong and you 
should be able to trace it. 
Checking for brake drag is a good 
first step. Even slight differences in

drag or between the front tires can 
compound any tendency toward 
torque steer. A second check should be 
for a difference in looseness of the 
front suspension or tie-rod ends from 
one side to the other. You can feel

In addition, eyeball 
any rubber bushi ngs, pa r-
ticula rl y at the control 
a rm s (Fig. 2). When these bushings 
a re bad, they look it- cracked, dis-
torted. Also, pry the co ntro l arm s to 
feel for any looseness (Fig. 3). 
ext, measure the front suspen-
sion ride height (Fig. 4). Factory ser-
vice manuals detail the many possible 
measurement points, but the object is 
to compa re readings between a pair o f 
fixed points- one on the suspension 
and the other on the chassis. You'll 
need an absolutely dead-flat piece of 
pavement for this, and bou nce the car 
up and down on the suspension a 
couple of times after you park. 
One wa y to check for sY I11J11etry-
or the lack thereof-in the suspension 
is to tie a stri ng between the bottoms 
of the lower contro l arms (such as 
from the ball-joint grease fi ttings) . 
The string should be very tight (a nd 
"straight as a string") . M easure from 
(Fig. 4) With the car on a dead-level 
surface, check for correct symmetry in 
the suspension ride height. Stretch a 
string between a pair of convenient 
points on the shocks or ball joints, and 
measure to the frame rails. It should be

the string to the underside 
of the fram e rail to which 
the control arm mounts, and 
the distance should be the 
same from side to side, 
within less than a half-inch. 
If it's greater, there's front 
spring sag, a common major 
contributor to torque steer. 
Replace the springs to fix 
this problem. 
Badly sagged rear springs 
can cause a vehicle to pull as 
well, but you'll be able to see 
the height difference visuall y 
before the pull gets bad 
enough to notice while driv-
ing. Just look carefully at 
your car or truck from the 
rea r when it's parked on that 
level patch of pavement. 
Good springs? Check the engine 
mounts for deterioration, as weak 
mounts allow the powertrain to shift 
unevenly on acceleration, and that 
can move the car in one direction or 
the other. If the rear (transaxle) 
mount is an air-gap type and it's bad, 
the engine will rock back-
ward, mashing the metal of 
the mount against the rub-
ber center section. To check 
for this, have a helper hit the 
gas pedal while in Neutral. 
Also check to see if the 
transaxle is level, which 
you can do with a carpen-
ter's level. It doesn't ha ve to 
be absolutely, perfectly 
level, but within a quarter-
inch or so. 
If it's not, try loosening 
the transaxle mount, running 
the engine at idle (have the 
parking and service brakes 
applied, once more) and, if 
you have an automatic trans-
mission, shifting the trans-
mission back and forth 
between Reverse and Drive 
several times. With a manual 
236 
box, you can try prying the powertrain 
fore and aft a few times. This should 
resettle the powertrain. 
Retighten the bolts and recheck 
the level. If it's still on a tilt, you can 
try shimming up the low end of the 
powertrain, using suspension shims. 
•• I 
Still looking for answers? 
It's certainl y possible that 
problems with the front 
tires, such as misaligned 
belts-under the tread and 
out of sight-are a factor. 
Normally, tire problems are 
going to cause pull even 
when you're not accelerat-
ing, but it is possible that 
you are more sensitive to it 
only during acceleration. 
So let's look at the ti res, 
and talk about a straightfor-
ward pull. 
Tire-Related Pull 
Hopefu ll y, you had your 
alignment checked at a shop 
that uses first-rate electronic 
eq uipment, one that even 
checks caster and camber 
on " net-build' (nonad-
justable) front suspensions. 
A good alignment shop 
knows what is acceptable as 
a suspension ages and springs sag 
slightl y. And it can slant the ca mber 
readings ever so slightly to minimize 
pull in one direction. 
Tires are the first do-it-yourself 
items to check, even if the pressures 
are the same and right at specifica-
tions. Are they exactly the 
same size and type, and 
worn about the same? If not, 
\ 
they're probably at least 
contributors to any pull. 
Even if they look exactly the 
same, the tread belts of one 
or more may have been 
damaged. 
Get the front end of the 
car up in the air on proper 
jackstands for the remainder 
of these tests. Put the stands 
under the frame, not the 
suspension members. 
Rotate each front wheel 
and feel for more than light 
drag. If you get much more 
drag at one front wheel 
than the other, yo u have a 
brake-system problem-
either a bad caliper or 
something wrong wi th the 
CHASSIS 

hydraulic system, such as a crimped 
tube or even a bad master cyl inder. 
Equal or no drag on both front 
tires? Switch them left to right. If the 
pull is in the opposite direction, get 
new tires. Even if the pull changes 
somewhat, but not necessarily all the 
way in the opposite direction, the tires 
still are the most probable cause of 
the pull, and a new pair might be 
worth a try if nothing else pans out. If 
you're lucky, however, the pu ll will go 
away and you can pat yourself on the 
back for a cheap fix. Stop here if 
you're checking for a cause of torque 
steer. Let's try one more thing for a 
tire-related pull. 
If there's no change after the front-
tire swap, next switch the wheel on 
the driver's-side front with the one on 
the driver's-side rear. If that makes a 
significant change, get a replacement 
for the tire now at the driver's-side 
rear (the one originally at the passen-
ger's-side front). If the tread pattern 
SOLVING STEERING PULL PROBLEMS 
or amount of wear is significan tl y dif-
ferent between new tires and the rest 
that you have, you may have to sim-
ply replace all four tires. 
Memory Steer 
When toe is correct, and th e car 
pulls in the same direction as the last 
turn , you're dealing with memory 
steer-almost a lways caused by 
binding in the suspension on that 
side of the car. 
On a MacPherson-strut suspension, 
it's a good bet that the binding is in the 
upper strut mount bearing. Sometimes, 
you can feel roughness in the mount by 
reaching up from underneath and rest-
ing your fingers on it, while a helper 
cranks the wheel back and forth (front 
end up on safety stands). 
More often, you'll have to pull the 
strut for a better test of the bearing. 
Check for binding in the bearing after 
you've pulled the strut (Fig. 5). 
No luck? It might be a binding 
tie-rod end, but that's not likely-
th ey generall y get slo ppy rather than 
bind up. Give the tie rods a shake 
and a twist to check. Also unlikely 
but possible is a binding ball joint. 
You may need to disconnect it to 
confirm this. 
It's possible that the binding is in 
the steering gear. As a fin al test, yo u 
can disconnect the tie rods. With 
them connected and then discon-
nected, yo u sho uld be able to feel the 
difference by turning the steering 
wheel in each direction with the 
engine off. 
Unfortunately, not all a lignment 
shops are as meth odica l as they 
could be. And some shops wi ll tell 
yo u that "a ll front-wheel-drive cars 
do th at. " But unless the pulling 
problem has been there since the day 
you received the vehicle, it isn 't 
generic and you should conduct a 
careful road test and underbod y 
inspection. (I

for the fi rst time in weeks yo u can

It's a vibra tion that isn't even percep·

cure the pro blem-or if it cropped 
up suddenl y within a reasonable time 
after a wheel balance- yo ur prob-
lems may go deeper. 
Begin by cranking the wheels over 
to the steering stop and looking at 
the inside of the rim. It's customary 
to split the amount of the balance 
weights between the inside and out· 
side of the rim. If a weight (even an 
old one) has come off, that could be 
the problem. The weight shou ld 
leave a clear outline, so you' ll know 
exactly how much is missing (Fig. 1).

ca use" category. 
Nothing o bvious? Take the car for 
a test drive. When the vibration 
occurs, is it while yo u're accelerating

torque and speed sensitive. When 
you pull back to your garage, inspect

intact, the clamps are holding them 
at each end, and there's been no loss 
of lubricant and no intrusion of road 
film, then they' re pro bably in good 
condition. 
If the vibration is not related to 
torque, shift into Neutral and let the 
vehicle coast at the problem speed.

sitive pure and simple. This could be 
the source of your troubles, even if 
the wheels are balanced and the tires 
are good. It's not a powertrain or dri -
veline iss ue. 
Keeping Your Bearings 
Jack up th e front wheels by the con-
trol arms, so they're off the ground, 
and support them with safety stands. 
Grasp each wheel, ho lding it first at 
the sides, then at the top and bottom. 
See if you ca n rock the w heel in and 
o ut and if you can feel any looseness,

worn wh eel hub bearings (Fig. 2). To 
replace wheel bearings on front-drive 
cars, you've got to 
remove the wheel hub.

ha mmer puller, a tool

the rental Peg-Board of 
many auto parts stores, 
and a torque wrench

torque usually required 
for the retain ing nut

the wheel bearing nut to about

new cotter pin. 
Steering Your Way 
You may not feel free play in a fro nt 
wheel (front- or rear-drive), but try 
rocking it in and out with a bit more 
effort, but not enough to move the 
steering linkage. That could demon-
strate free play from wear in the tie-
rod ends or ball joints. If you're not 
sure where the free play is, pry up on 
the bottom of the tire and watch the 
ball joint to see if it has free play-Y< 
in . is a lot. To check a tie-rod end 
joint for looseness, try to flex it by 
hand. A good tie-rod end should feel 
snug, but not immobile or stiff. 
On rack-and-pinion steering, it's a 
good idea to check the tie rods' inner 
sockets. They're covered by the steer-
ing rack boots, but you can squeeze 
the boots to hold the inner joint. Jack 
Rack-and-Pinion Steering 
There are several types of steering systems, but the 
rack- and-pinion has become the most popular because 
of its simplicity and precise response. It's used primarily 
on passenger cars and also on late-model sport utility 
vehicles. The rack is a shaft with gear teeth, and it 
meshes with the pinion, a gear at the end of the steering 
wheel shaft. The rack is horizontally installed between 
the front wheels and is connected by a tie rod at each 
INNER SOCKET 
side to a steering knuckle, the pivoting structure to 
, ~ 
which each front wheel is attached. The tie rod has a flex 
joint at each end that allows it to flex and pivot in trans-
ferring steering wheel motion from the rack to the knuck-
les. As the steering wheel is turned to either side, the 
pinion rotates and moves the rack to that side, pivoting 
the front wheels in the same direction.

up the front end to take the weight 
o ff the front wheels. Ha ve a fri end 
slowl y turn the steering wheel a par-
tial turn to each side, while you feel 
for looseness. 
Look Out for Runout 
Just because you can't feel a lot of free 
play or "wobble" in a wheel doesn't 
mean there isn't enough to cause vibra-
tion. It doesn't take a lot to be respon-
sible for objectionable vibration at 
speeds of 60 to 70 mph and above-
any deviation from a truly circular spin 
is called runout. It can be vertical (up-
down ) or horizontal (in-out). 
The only practical way to check 
fo r runout-front or rear-is with a 
dial indicator, another tool you can 
rent at many parts stores. T here are 
several different checks to make to 
pinpoint the source of the runout. 
Mount the indicator on something 
heavy that won't move, such as an 
anchor plate or wheel hub/knuckle. 
Position the plunger for the specific 
runout check. Exa mple: For a radi al 
runout test, rest it aga inst a good ti re 
tread groove. Slowly turn the tire and 
measure the amount of runout, ignor-
ing jumps in the plunger that result 
from the shape of the tread or minor 
imperfections in it. If there are factory 
specifications for runo ut, use those. 
If you don't have specs, see if the 
runout is about .050 to .060 in.-this 
measurement is considered rule of 
thumb (Fig. 4). The tire almost surely 
isn't the issue, although there is preci-
sion equipment that can check a tire 
for heavy spots. We know-
you don't 
have it and can't rent it. Most profes-
sionals don't have it either, which 
tells yo u how common it is. 
To isolate the source of the runout, 
check it at the wheel w ith the plunger 
on an underside horizontal surface. 
Ignore minor imperfections in the 
wheel finish (paint, weld, tiny dings) 
that cause the plunger to jump instan-
taneously. If the runout is over .045 
in., the wheel should be replaced. 
If radial runout isn't bad, check lat-
eral run out with the plunger against 
the sidewall, even if the in-out rocking 
didn't show anything. O bviously, 
" ~ 
.. . 
" 
~ . ~

ignore any plunger movement from 
raised lettering, etc. If the J'L1I10ut is 
over .045 in., it's too much . Here 
aga in, isolate the runout by checking 
at the wheel with the plunger against a 
vertical surface. The rule-of-thumb 
specs are the same as for radial runout. 
When the runo ut at the wheel is 
excessive, a new wheel normally is the 
answer, but not always. Remove the 
wheel and check runout on the wheel 
hub (Fig. 5). M aking a lateral runo ut 
check is an obvious procedure 
beca use there's a hub face aga inst 
which you can rest the plunger. For a 
radial check, it may be more difficult 
if the top surface of the hub isn't rea-
sonabl y smooth because you have to 
use the threaded edges of the studs, 
and, typica lly, there are onl y four or 
fi ve of those studs. So it does take 
some careful measuring to see if 
there's a significant amount. You have / 
to look for the pea k reading at each

stud to be sure you're measuring at 
the outermost point. Unless almost all 
th e radial runout is in the bolt circle, 
and that amount is at least .030 in., 
go for a new wheel. Replacing the 
hub and bearing on a front-dri ve is 
not a quick and easy job. 
It can take a couple of hours to 
check out the possible causes of high-
speed vibration, and you may be 
tempted to take the car in for wheel 
alignment to see if that helps before 
you spend time on all these other 
things. Sorry. Unless there's some evi-
dence of wheel misa lignment (such as 
irregular tire wea r), a wheel alignment 
is not going to help at all. In fact, until 
you first isolate and correct the cause 
of the vibration, alignment would be a 
waste of time and money. tI

ReplaCing A Steering Rack

t's a crisp morning as you ca re-

slowly on cool da ys has so-ca lled 
"morning sickness." It won't go away. 
It's caused by wear inside the steer-
ing assem bly (a.k.a. the "rack"). The 
fluid 's black, metallic look is a resu lt 
of metal worn from the inside of the 
housing. The fluid is abrasive, and the 
wea r will worsen with time. The rack 
is shot-replace it and use the oppor-
tunity to flush the jun k from the 
pump and lines. 
Can I Do It? 
Swapping a rack is simple in some 
cars, nasty in others. For example, a 
rear-drive car's rack, if bolted in fro nt 
of the front crossmember, is usua ll y 
easy to change. But it's more challeng-
ing in a front-driver with the rack 
bolted to the subframe behind the 
L
wertrain or against the firewall. 
242 
(Fig. 1) Disconnect the rack's pinion 
shaft from the steering column. 
Should you do it yourself? A shop 
manual may tell yo u how tough the 
job will be, but not always. O ne Gen-
eral Motors manual says you have to 
lower the front subframe 3 in . to get 
enough clearance to slip out the rack. 
Maybe, maybe not. Legions of techni-
cians just twist and wiggle it through 
the existing space with no problem. 
But you should still check the ser-
vice manual. For one thing, it'll let you 
know if there are nuts and bolts that 
must be replaced with new ones, fo r 
safety's sake, when changing the rack. 
You will also want to know the torque 
values for all fasteners. Are there any 
O-rings involved? They' ll need replac-
ing. T he manual will tell you. 
Before chickening out, look at a 
replacement rack. Yo u'll see the loca-
tion of bolt holes and the fluid pres-
sure and return line ports- the only 
fluid lines you' ll need to disconnect 
and reattach at the rack. Safely sup-
port the car and check clearances. If

you find you can't grasp everything 
you need to work on from under the 
car or by reaching around the engine, 
yo u may opt to send the job out. 
Lastly, before deciding, talk with peo-
ple who know the job, such as the 
front-end pro who'll align the car 
after you've swapped the rack, or a 
dismantler at a loca l salvage yard. 
They may know legitimate shortcuts. 
Doing It 
Ready to go? It will help if you 
remove the front wheels for better 
access to the wheel wells. Break all 
the lug nuts free before using the jack. 
Lift the car and support it safely on 
stands. T hen, unbolt the clamp that 
connects the steering column to the 
pinion shaft (Fig. 1). 
Detach the outer tie rod ends. You 
may need to use a special tie rod end 
pu ller to get the tapered bolt to relin-
qu ish its grip on the steering upright 
(Fig. 2). If you're reusing the old ourer

knuckles with a fork-type remover-it 
could damage the grease sea ls. Use a 
puller-type remover. Better yet, you 
pro bably can leave them in the 
uprights. Just loosen the jam nuts and 
turn the tie rods with a pipe wrench. 
The rods will unscrew from the 
ends-clockw ise on one side, counter-
clockw ise on the other. Unbolt the 
rack from th e chassis. Now you ca n 
disconnect the fluid lines and ca pture 
the power steering hydraulic fluid as 
it drains.

able amounts of crud , many power

Disconnect the return line to the 
fluid tank and let it dra in into a sma ll 
container through the return hose. 
This is the low-pressure side, usua lly 
secured with a hose clamp. T hen 
block the hole. Vin yl vacuum caps 
work well. 
Next, disconnect the pressure line 
from the rack and aim it into a 
bucket. Refill with fresh fluid and tap 
the starter-it may require pumping a 
quart or more to clean the line. Cap 
or plug any loose ends. 
Now it's time to twist, wiggle and 
snake the old rack out of the vehicle 
(Fig. 3). Expel any minors from the 
ga rage, as they may find the language 
necessary to persuade the rack clea r

need to unbolt and slightl y move 
some other components to get the

w rench to swing on a fluid line 
attachment once you've unbolted the 
rack and moved it a bit. Also, rea t-
taching the lines may be easier before 
the new rack is bolted in place. 
Use a tape measure to check the

by twisting the tie rod ends on their

HOW IT WORKS 
Power Rack-and-Pinion Steering 
As you turn the steering wheel, a spool valve on the pin-
ion shaft moves relative to ports in the housing. The 
ports connect to chambers on either side of a piston on 
the rack shaft. Steer left and the port connected to the 
chamber on the right side of the piston opens while the 
other port closes. This lets fluid pressurize the right 
side of the piston, helping push the rack shaft to the 
left and pointing the wheels in 
that direction. (This description 
assumes the rack assembly is 
ahead of the axle. If it were 
behind it, moving the shaft right 
would point the wheels left.) 
Wear allows fluid to bypass the 
piston, wasting steering assist. 
"Morning sickness" results from 
light wear that closes up as heat 
expands the parts. As wear wors-
ens, expansion will no longer take 
up the slack. 
Intense competition has dri-
ven remanufactured rack prices down. A "reman" unit 
may be your best bet, since many originals wore out 
because their shafts bore directly on the inside of their 
aluminum housings. In remanufacturing, the housings 
are bored, then hardened-steel inserts are installed in 
areas subject to wear. You may be able to get a recently 
installed new or reman rack at a salvage yard.

EASY 
Servicing Brake Discs 
Y
Ou're up to highway speed and 
suddenly a car cuts across your 
lane to make an exit. You man-
age to slow enough to avoid a nasty 
accident, but the brakes definitely 
don't feel right. The brake pedal has 
had this kind of vibration fo r a couple 
of weeks, but onl y at low speeds. 
Now it feels like you're stepping on a 
running chain saw, and the front 
wheels don't want to go where you 
want them to. 
Forget The Guesswork 
Pull the wheels for a closeup look. 
With the wheels off, you can inspect 
the rotor-lining contact surfaces. First 
look for a crack that goes all the way 
through a vented rotor-or at least 
through one of its two surfaces. A 
cracked rotor causes severe pulsation, 
and the onl y cure is replacement. 
Rust at the rotor edges is meaning-
less, as are moderate scores in the 
disc's surface, or a few off-color spots 
on the shiny areas swept by the pads. 
Be sure to check both sides of the

rotor, however. W hen you pull the 
wheels, there should be an accessible 
area on the back side (even if there's a 
dust shield ) where you can inspect the 
surface. Severe rusting of the lining 
contact surfaces is a problem. So are 
thick, deep scores, uneven thickness 
and lateral runout (warping). 
If the rotors have never been resur-
faced, it is theoretica lly possible to 
have them machined to remove signif-
icant rust and deep scores (a bout .060 
in . deep ). H owever, many late-model 
rotors are not very thick to start with, 
and can't take more than a .030-in. 
resurfaci ng. Unless the rotor is at least 
.060 in. thicker than the minimum 
thickness stamped somewhere on the 
rotor, forget trying to save it. Buy new 
rotors. How can you test the depth of 
a score? If it's thick enough, insert the 
head of a dime into it. If the dime 
---J 
goes in beyond the top of the presi-
dent's head, the score is too deep. If a 
score is too thin for the dime to slip 
in, it's harmless. Another test is to run 
your fingernail across the surface 
radially. If your nail catches, the rotor 
needs to be resurfaced (Fig. 1). If not, 
you're probably okay, provided 
there's enough thickness left on a 
true-running rotor. 
Uni fo rm thickness is critical. Mea-
sure each rotor with an o utside 
micrometer at a number of evenl y 
spaced points around the lining con-
tact surface. A va riation of .005 in. 
or more is enough to cause the pulsa-
tion you feel. 
l ateral runout is caused by a rotor 
that's unifo rm in thickness, but is 
wavy. Uneven thickness and excessive 
run out often go together. That is, the 
runout causes the uneven wear on the 
rotor. So if you catch it early, the 
rotor may pass a thickness check, but 
it still could have excessive lateral 
runout. The high heat (then rapid 
cooling) from ha rd braking is a pri-
mary cause of runout, but close 
behind is uneven tightening of wheel 
lug nuts. Dirt or rust buildup 
between the rotor and hub also can 
produce runout (Fig. 2) . 
To check for excessive runouti 
warping, you need a dial indicator, 
which you can rent from many auto 
parts stores. When you pull the 
wheels, the rotors might be loose on 
the studs, so refit the lug nuts and 
tighten them securely. Install the dial 
indicator, and mount it on the suspen-
sion. Then, aim the indicator plunger 
at the middle of the lining contact sur-
face, at as close to a 90' angle as pos-
sible. Set the plunger so it presses 
lightly aga inst the rotor-lining contact 
surface, then zero out the dial. Slowly 
rotate the rotor and watch the dial. If 
it exceeds .005 in., the rotor is not 
running true (Fig. 3). 
245 

You may not have to replace or 
resurface the rotor. With the rotor off, 
you can look for and remove dirt or 
rust buildup. If that's not the problem, 
you can try re-indexing the rotor. That 
is, just remove it, rotate it one or two 
stud holes, install and tighten the lug 
246 
The brake rotor, the disc in disc 
brakes, mounts on the hub with the 
wheel, and both rotor and hub are 
held by the same studs and lug 
nuts. When you apply the brakes, 
the hydraulic device called the 
caliper clamps the brake shoes 
(also called pads) against the rotor, 
and the friction material on the 
shoes stops the spinning of the 
rotor (and therefore the wheel). 
The friction material on the shoes 
causes the energy of wheel and 
rotor motion to be converted to 
heat, and the rotor temperature 
can soar to over 1000
0 F in a hard 
stop. That heat has to be 
dissipated very quickly so that the 
rotor can cool down for the next 
nuts and recheck. Although the typical 
rotor just slides off the studs with the 
wheel removed (some advance spraying 
with penetrating solvent may be neces-
sary), the caliper has to come off first. 
First, remove the bolts that hold 
the caliper itself to its anchor frame or

Brake Rotor

brakes, remove any dirt or 
rust that might get between

to the suspension. Then pry 
the caliper up, lift it off the 
frame and wire it to the sus-
pension. This will relieve 
any stra in on the brake 
hose. Many vehicles have 
"flip up" ca lipers. Remove 
one lower retaining bolt, flip 
up the caliper and slide it off 
a stud. If the brake shoes 
stay in the anchor frame, 
perhaps held by a retaining 
clip, remove those next. 
Finally, unbolt the anchor 
fra me, lift it out and the 
rotor should slide off. But 
first, if the rotor is not neces-
sarily being replaced, make 
alignment marks on the hub 
section and the stud, so you can rein-
stall it in the same location. If it binds 
on the hub, that's normal rust buildup. 
Just spray the studs and holes and 
hub/rotor joints with penetrating sol-
vent, rock the rotor with a pulling 
motion and it should walk off. Clean

stop. Because front brakes do 
about 75 percent of the work in a 
front-drive car (over 50 percent in a 
rear-drive), the front rotors have to 
be able to dissipate a lot more heat 
than the rear brakes, drum or disc. 
As a result, the front rotors on vir-
tually all cars today have two con-
tact layers separated by a vent 
area, which resembles a paddle 
fan, to scoop up air. This design not 
only gives each brake shoe a sepa-
rate disc, but the airflow through 
the center provides greater cooling. 
Some high-performance cars also 
have vented rear discs.

rust off the hub with ultrafine 
sandpaper or a wire brush. 
Clean the mating face of the 
rotor as well. 
If you're working on rear 
discs, they're likely to have a 
mechanical actuator for a park-
ing-brake function or a drum-
type parking brake built into 
the hub. With the drum type, 
the rotor itself will have a deep 
"hat" section to fit the hub, and 
the inside of that hat is the 
drum for the parking brake. 
Normally, with the parking 
brake off, the rotor just slides off, but if 
the parking brake has a self-adjusting 
linkage, it's possible that it's overad-
justed and the drum shoe linings are 
locked against the inside of the hat. In 
that case, you can reach in from the 
back through an access hole (in the hub 
and also possibly through a dust shield ), 
and back off the adjuster (Fig. 4). With 
the type that uses an actuator on the 
disc brake lining pads, you may be able 
to just lift the caliper off. At worst, 
PARKING BRAKE SHOES

you'll first have to disconnect the brake 
cable from the actuator on the caliper. 
Installation 
If you need a new rotor, insta ll it 
straight out of the box. Some of the 
lightweight rotors, made of a stamped 
steel hub with a cast-iron braking sur-
face, co uld test as warped unless you 
check them with all lug nuts installed 
and tightened. 
Note: There are some rotors that are 
a real bear to remove, so if the vehicle 
manufacturer indicates special tools or 
if a press is necessa ry, a rotor ca n be 
machined on the vehicle. You're best off 
leaving this to a properly equipped pro. 
Both Sides, Please 
Norma lly, what happens to one wheel 
happens to the other. If one rotor is 
gone and the other is marginal for 
machining, replace both. However, if 
one is particularly bad, perhaps the 
vehicle has been pulling, leaving the 
other side pristine. There may be 
uneven brake application, perhaps from 
a hydraulic or mechanical problem at 
the wheel. Trace the cause in addition to 
correcting the rotor problem. 
Clean lug nuts and stud threads 
with a mild solvent and wipe dry. 
Don't lubricate them if the torque 
specifications are based on clean, dry 
threads. But a thin film of anti-seize 
compound normally is beneficial. One 
of the most important tools you can 
use is a torque wrench. When you're 
re-indexing a rotOt; be sure to reinstall 
the lug nuts and torque them to specifi-
cations in at least three stages. Use a 
crisscross pattern for each stage until 
all are tight. (I

Fixing Suspension 
Clunks And Rattles 
I

road. Potholes compete with ruts 
for the privilege of knocking your 
Freedom Fries out of the bag and 
OntO the floor. It's worth it, however, 
for the great weekend of backwoods 
hiking and knocking around. Heading 
back to civilization without the heavy 
load of refreshment and food seems 
easier on your car and your fresh ly 
relaxed psyche. At least until you hit 
the pavement and the rattling starts. 
Maybe you couldn't hear it on the 
unpaved road, but every expansion 
strip on the interstate makes your car 
sound like a tin can full of bolts. 
Something's loose in your suspension. 
While there's little chance that 
your car is going to lose something 
essential wh ile you're going down the 
248 
road, chassis and suspension noises 
definitely have to be checked out for 
safety's sake. Plus, who wants to drive 
a vehicle that sounds like it's about to 
drop to the pavement? 
If your car has lots of miles on it-
or even if it doesn't, but is "chrono-
logically gifted"-don't be surprised 
if some portion of the heavy metal 
that supports it over terra firma starts 
complaining. Unfortunately, finding 
the ca use of the noise isn't so easy. 
The dynamics of a rolling vehicle, the 
complex nature of modern suspen-
sions, and the way sounds can be 
telegraphed through the chassis and 
body make it hard to pinpoint the 
location of a problem. 
If you hear a clunk when the sus-
pension works over bumps, the prob-
able cause is excessive clearance in a 
joint due to wear. It might be as sim-
ple as a loose strut gland nut, or 
something more subtle such as a 
shrunken, dried-out rubber bushing. 
Research, Then Bounce 
As a first step, consult whatever litera-
ture you have avai lable to see if you 
can find a Technical Service Bulletin 
(TSB) that perta ins to the noise. 
Apparently, suspension clatter is a 
popular problem industrywide 
because it generates quite a few TSBs. 
Some of these alert you to redesigned 
replacement parts, while others say 
the noise is simply a characteristic of 
the vehicle and should be accepted as 
norma I.

time to go hands-on. It'll be helpful if 
you can get a friend, preferably a 
hefty one, to assist. For front-end 
noises, pop the hood, and have your 
comrade press down on the bumper 
or fender, then release and lift repeat-
edl y until the suspension is rea ll y 
working. Whi le he does this, listen 
carefu lly and use a good light to 
examine the upper strut or shock 
mounts and the control arm joints. If 
you hear anything untoward, but 
can't pinpoint the source, place the 
end of a broomstick aga inst your ear 
and touch the other end to suspected 
areas. This works almost as well as a 
mechanic's stethoscope. Nothing 
obvious? Then lie down and look 
underneath with your light, even 
though your friend's stamina may be 
taxed by this time. 
The "dry park check," which wi ll

Have your helper sit in the dri ver's 
seat, turn the key to unlock the col-
umn, then rock the steering w heel vig-
orously from side to side w hile you 
watch the steering components. There 
should be next to no visible lash. 
By the way, if you raise the car by 
the frame, the suspension and steering 
parts will be hanging at an unnatural 
angle, w hich may mask the looseness 
you're looking for. So, place your jack 
and jackstands under the control 
arms or the rear axle to keep the 
weight on the suspension compo-
nents. 
You ca n uncover the shortcomings 
of upper A-frame or control arm 
bushings by having a helper hold the 
brakes firmly with the engine idling 
while shifting from Dri ve through 
Neutral to Reverse repeatedl y. Look 
down over the fender as your helper 
does this. 
Some vehicles have substantial 
horizontal struts that position the 
lower control arms fore and aft. 
These are mounted in large rubber 
bushings, and any clearance here will 
make itself heard . Also, their mou nt-
ing points on the frame have been 
known to rust away, but this causes 
steering symptoms far more notice-
able and worrisome than a mere 
nOise.

may have what's called a " panhard 
rod" that runs diagonally from the 
chassis to one side of the axle hous-

source of a clunking noise. 
Worn-out shocks or struts are 
common culprits here. When the 
intern al hydraulics wear out, the pis-

you hit a bump. With

definitely have some steering issues. 
CURING STEERING WANDER 
Vehicle-to-pavement interface 
Before you start thinking about 
expensive repairs, make sure the 
basic vehicle-to-road interface is 
okay, meaning the tires. First, check 
inflation pressures. (Don 't trust the 
gauge on the quarter-eating pump at 
the loca l station-those are often off 
by as much as 5 pounds. Drop 10 
bucks on a good ga uge and keep it in 
your glovebox.) You should check 
your tire pressures once a month. 
And that's first thing in the morning, 
cold. The correct pressure is on a 
sticker- check your owner's manual 
for its exact location. A low tire on 
one side will make a car pull in that 
direction. This is because its rolling 
diameter will be smaller than that of 
its mate on the other side. Also, 
there' ll be more tread-to-pa vement 
drag on the low side, pulling the car 
in that direction. 
If the problem persists, try switch-
ing the positions of the right and left 
tire/wbeel assemblies. If tbe car pulls 
in tbe opposite direction after you've 
done this, you've fou nd tire trouble. 
251 

PSSST!: Low tire pressure will cause a 
wheel to pull. 
Check your tires' tread-wear pat-
terns. For example, if a front tire's 
tread tends to disappear along the 
outboard edge, it's likely that the 
camber setting at that corner is too 
positive, and any pull probably will 
be toward that side. 
Geometrical considerations 
Camber refers to the tilt of the tire 
from the vertical, and this has a pro-
found effect on directional tendencies. 
Zero camber means the centerline of 
the tire is perfectly perpendicular to a 
level surface. If tbe top of the tire tilts 
outward from the body, camber is 
said to be positive. Going too far in 
this direction wi ll cause a pull to that 
side because the tire itself forms the 
shape of a cone. 
Don't run to the alignment shop 
just yet. You can get a pretty good 
idea of camber by using a carpenter's 
level, although you'll need to be 
parked on a perfectly level space. We 
used two 35mm film canisters held to 
the edge of the level with rubber 
bands. The canisters served as feet 
that we placed at the top and bottom 
of the wheel's rim. Keep in mind that 
most vehicles will have a degree or 
two of negative camber. 
Here's where ride height comes in. 
As springs or torsion bars sag with 
age, camber changes. Replacing coil 
springs or adjusting torsion bars can 
bring alignment back into specs. 
Woof! 
Even if the front wheels are perfectly 
aligned and tires properly inflated, you 
may still have to steer constantly in 
one direction or the other to keep the 
vehicle going straight up the road. The 
problem is that the rear wheels are 
also trying to steer the vehicle and 
overtake the fronts. This condition is 
commonly referred to as dog tracking. 
Technically this occurs when your 
vehicle's "thrust line" and centerline 
are too far apart. On vehicles with 
solid rear axles, the thrust line is per-
pendicular to the rear axle. On vehicles 
with an independent rear suspension 
252 
(IRS ), the thrust line is determined by 
splitting the toe-in angle of the rear 
wheels. For example, if the left rear 
wheel is toed in at 4' and the right is 
toed at zero, the thrust line is 2' to the 
left of the centerline. 
In an ideal world the two lines 
coincide. But given a vehicle's size,

can be done with a level and two sim-
ple spacers. 
manufacturing tolerances, wear and 
abuse of daily driving, they often do 
not. If the deviation between the two 
is great, your vehicle will dog track. 
Besides having a steering wheel that's 
not at center when you're going 
stra ight, another obvious clue to dog 
tracking is if you see four distinct 
tracks in the snow or rain when dri-
ving straight. 
This is just about impossible to 
correct without professional 4-wheel-
CHASSIS 

alignment equipment. O n IRS cars, 
tapered shims are typica ll y installed 
under the rear stub axles to reconcile 
the thrust line and centerline and to 
restore harmony. With solid rear 
axles, the repair will require replacing 
the rear links or straightening the 
frame. 
Wanderlust 
If your car doesn't have a definite pull 
to one side, but instead a sloppy, 
undisciplined tendency to wa nder all 
over the place, the first thing to think 
about is wear in the steering and sus-
penSIOn. 
Direct observation is the best way 
to find this, but you'll need a helper. 
With the car sitting with all wheels 
solidly on the pavement, have him or 
her unlock the steering column, then 
rock the wheel vigorously back and 
forth while you stick your head 
underneath and inspect with a light. 
(Needless to say, do this with the 
engine off. ) 
With a parallelogram steering sys-
tem-the kind with a Pitman arm 
coming out of the steering box- you 
may see the idler or Pitman arm mov-
ing up and down. Or you may notice 
slop in the tie-rod ends or perhaps 
more rotational action going into the 
steering box than coming out. W ith 
rack-and-pinion steering, pay specia l 
attention to the inner tie-rod ends, 
and make sure the rack housing itself 
is firml y mounted. 
Another way to inspect is to 
slightly raise one tire off the ground 
(place the jack under the lower con-
trol arm, then have your assistant 
rock that tire side to side, then top to 
bottom, while you take a look). 
Steering bag? 
With the recirculating-ball steering 
boxes typically found on big domestic 
rwd cars, pickups and SUVs, lash will 
gradually develop between the worm 
and sector gears. You can eliminate 
this problem by doing an "over-center 
adjustment." You'll find an adjusting 
bolt or screw sticking out of the top 
of the steering box . With the wheels 
as close to the straight-ahead position 
LOOSE: Minor adjustment to the clearance of a high-mileage steering box can 
tighten up the steering. 
LOOSER: Worn tie-rod ends let the wheels wander, making steering vague. 
as you can get them, loosen the lock-
nut, then turn the screw clockwise to 
reduce lash. Do not overdo this or 
you can reduce interior tolerances too 
much, causing damage. You'll know 
you've gone too far if the steering 
wheel stays where you put it instead 
of returning to a stra ight-ahead posi-
ti on under normal road forces, espe-
cially when coming out of a rurn. 
Lash may exist in the joints that 
allow the steering column to transmit 
the helmsman's commands to the 
gearbox. T he uni versal variety typi-
ca lly lasts fo rever, but the rubberized 
textile type, fondl y known as a "rag 
joint," often deteri orates to the point 
at which there's excessive play. 
Deteriorated upper control arm 
bushings can ca use serio us steering 
problems, and proba bly a lot of 
clunking to boot. Look down on 
them while your helper holds the 
brakes and shifts from Drive to

MODERATE 
Re-Covering Your Seats 
I
t's Saturday night, and you're tak-
ing the in-laws out to dinner. 
Unfortunately, the dog has been 
digging-unbeknownst to you-for 
bones he thinks are hidden under the 
back seat. The ens uing divot leaves 
your spouse's mother sitting at a con-
siderable angle all the way to Denny's. 
Morning finds you duct-taping 
large and sI11all chunks of foam rub-
ber back into place. Late morning 
finds you ca lling upholstery shops, 
followed by a qu ick ba lancing of the 
checkbook to see if you can afford it. 
Rolling Your Own 
The one-size-fits-all covers you've 
seen at the discount department stores 
are certainly inexpensive, but they 
look like covers more suitable for 
lawn furniture. And you know that 
going to the local car upholstery shop 
is likely to cost you a minor fortune . 
"Basically, you have three choices, " 
says Randy Smith of Brougham Seats 
Inc., "slipcovers, re-covers or getting 
the damaged seat panels replaced at 
an upholstery shop." A fo urth choice 
also exists: Get replacement seats of 
an acceptable cover from a wrecking 
yard. If all seats have been damaged, 
consider this possibility. 
Slipcovers, which are designed to 
slide over the car's original seating 
material, range in price from $25 for 
the discount store cheapos to $400 
for custom-fit covers designed specifi-
cally for each vehicle. O ne company, 
Performance Products, even sells slip-
covers for Toyota trucks and Ford 
Explorers that are made from scuba-
diving wet-suit neoprene. 
As the name implies, slipcovers sl ip 
over the existing cover. They're typi-
ca ll y held in place on back-seat and 
front-seat bottom cushions with flex 
cords that attach to both sides of the 
cover under the cushion. The covers 
for front-seat back cushions snap on

or are held by Velcro at the bottom 
where the seams can't be seen. Head-
rest covers attach sim ilarly. Caution: 
If your vehicle seats have side airbags, 
covers could affect their deployment. 
Re-covers are designed to com-
pletely replace the original factory 
seat coverings. "It's not a do-it-your-
self project," says Smith, whose com-
pany makes them. "They can only be 
purchased by upholstery shops, and 
they're normally installed in fairly 
new cars and trucks for customers 
who want to upgrade their car's in-
terior, say from vinyl to leather." The 
cost? Typical installation prices range 
from $1500 to $3000, depending on 
the vehicle. 
The third option-having an 
upholstery shop repair a vinyl, cloth

or leather panel on a 
seat-might actua lly yield 
the most attractive result 
and may even be the least 
expensive option, if the 
damage or tearing is lim-
ited to a single panel on a 
bottom seat cushion or 
seatback. You can save 
add itional money by tak-
ing the seat out yourself, 
removing the hard-plastic 
skirrs, splitting the back 
from the bottom cushion 
and delivering the dam-
aged cushions to the shop for repair. 
Of course, the drawback is th at 
your car will be out of commission 
for a while if the work needs to be 
done to the driver's sear. 
If you're planning to go this route, 
check with the upholstery shop first 
so it can order matching material 
ahead of time, then make an 
appointment to have the work done 
to reduce your vehicle's downtime. 
Seat Removal 
and Disassembly 
Repa iring an upholstery panel is not 
easil y tackled at home, bur you can 
remove and disassemble the seats. 
And while you don't necessaril y 
ha ve to remove the front seats to 
install the slipcovers, the finished job 
wi ll look better and smoother if you 
take them out and then separate the 
cushions before putting on the covers. 
If you're doing all the seats, remove 
the front seats first so you'll have 
room to maneuver the rear-seat cush-
ions from the car. Doing it this way is 
especially critical on 2-door vehicles. 
Most front seats are bolted to the 
floor pan at all four corners. Begin by 
removing any plastic covers (Fig. 1) 
and then remove the bolts (Fig. 2). On 
power seats, disconnect the wires to 
the seat motor before lifting out the 
(Fig. 4) Disconnect the seatback recliner 
mechanism from the seat carefully. 
RE-COVERING YOUR SEATS 
seats. Caution: If your vehicle has side 
airbags in the seats, refer to a factory 
service manual for instructions on 
how to disable them safely, as well as 
how to reconnect the system. 
Typica ll y, rear-seat bottom cush-
ions must be removed before the back 
cushion can be removed. 
Most bottom cushions are 
" hooked " to the floor pan in front 
(Fig. 3). Firmly pushing the seat cush-
ion rearward and then lifting upward 
disengages the cushion from the hooks 
so the cushion can be lifted our. 
The back cushion is usuall y bolted 
to the rear bul khead near the bottom 
of the cushion, while the top of th e 
back hooks to the top of the bulk-
head. Remove the bolts and li ft 
upward to remove the rear cushion. 
With the seats missing, you'll want 
REAR-SEAT 
BOTTOM CUSHION 
to pick up loose change, petrified 
food and other materials. Now is also 
a good time to give the carpet a thor-
ough vacuuming and even a sham-
pooing if it's gotten rea lly disgusting. 
To disassemble the front seat, 
remove the headrest by sliding it from 
the seatback. You'll probably unbolt 
the seat top at the hinge pin. First, 
remove any hard-plastic skirting. If 
the seat has a reclining lever near the 
bottom cushion, you'll also have to 
disconnect the reclining mechanism 
from the seatback (Fig. 4). After that, 
unbolt and separate the two cushions. 
Installing Slipcovers 
If the foam cushions are damaged, 
this is the time to patch or replace 
them. If there are chunks missing, you 
can simply carve matching pieces

from upholstery foam to fit, gluing 
them to the existing foam in the cush-
ion with contact cement. 
Because durable materials are 
thicker and a tight fit makes for a bet-
ter look, the more expensive the slip-
covers, the harder they are to install. 
Begin by sliding the cover onto the 
bottom cushion first (Fig. 5). You may 
need an assistant with strong fingers 
to help you pu ll on the cover and get 
it aligned on the seat. Once the cover 
is in place, move to the underside of 
the cushion where you can draw the 
flex cords to the other side. Attach

them to the eyelets in the cover with 
the S-hooks that are provided with 
the cover (Fig. 6) . To ensure that the 
flex cords stay in place, crimp the S-
hooks closed with pliers (Fig. 7). 
Next, slide the slipcover for the 
back cushion into place and snap or 
Velcro the bottom. 
Insta ll the headrest covers and any 
fo ld-down armrest covers. Before 
reassembling the seat's back and bot-
tom cushions, make sure the slip-
covers are properly fitted with no 
gaps or loose corners. If there are any, 
readjust the covers on the cushions 
until the gaps disappear. 
After the seat cushions are 
reassembled, reattach the 
recliner mechanism and rein-
stall the plastic skirt. 
The rear-seat slipcovers for 
both the bottom and back cush-
ions install with flex cords in a 
manner similar to the front-seat 
bottom cushion. After the cords 
are in place, crimp the S-hooks 
with pliers and reinsta ll the 
cushions in the car.

When reinstalling the rear seats, make

When reinstalling the front seat, 
be sure to torque the mounting bolts 
to the proper specifications. Properly 
route the seatbelts and then make 
sure that both the sliding track and

EASY 
Replacing Your Cabin Air Filter 
I
t's Sunday and the big basketball 
game is this afternoon, but you can 
forget about getting tickets. So it's 
time to gather the crowd and drive to 
the sports bar. Minutes into the ride, 
the windshield is so foggy, you've got 
to hit the Defrost button. But why? 
The panel is set to outside air for 
heater operation, and there are no 
smokers in the car. You put your hand 
over the defroster outlets and there's 
hardly any airflow. When you turn the 
blower switch to high, the noise level 
goes up but the airflow is still weak. 
M aybe you need to change the 
cabin air filter. If it's plugged, the pas-
senger compartment might as well be 
a sealed cabin- and with a carload of 
friends the glass will fog in minutes. 
260 
Filter life depends on the air quality in 
your area, but a year, or 12,000 to 
15,000 miles, typica lly is the recom-
mended replacement interva l. 
Ca bin air filter? In the late 1980s 
and earl y 1990s, onl y some Europea n 
luxury cars had them. It's more com-
mon on newer cars. In many premium 
cars, there may be two filters, even 
three. Sometimes they're para llel (side 
by side), sometimes they're in series 
(one after the other, with some space 
in between). Sometimes they're 
nowhere near each other. 
Locating the Filters 
A cabin air filter may be in the outside 
air intake, visible with the hood up 
and perhaps a cover lifted. O r it will

often held in place with plastic button 
fasteners, which need to be pried up 
carefully. 
be under the dash in one or both of 
two general locations: 
• Above the blower in the back sec-
tion of the outside air intake, a loca-
tion well protected from moisture. 
• Between the blower and the rest of 
the HVAC case. 
If the owner's manual doesn't tell 
you the location, and you can't see it 
with the hood open, check behind the 
glovebox-perhaps you'll see an obvi-
ously remova ble (with a spring-tab or 
similar retainer) rectangular plastic 
cover. Next, look under the dash (on

both the driver's and pas-
senger's sides) for a remov-
able plastic cover in the 
HVAC case. If you can 
remove its cover, look 
inside the HVAC case. 
Still no answer? Buy the 
fi lters, something you ha ve 
to do anyway. You've got 
two choices: 
• Buy the factory filters at 
the dea lership at full price. 
T his way, you'll know for sure what 
they look li ke and get some idea 
about how they have to be installed. 
You' ll also find out how man y your 
vehicle has. The parts department 
sho uld have a diagram to show you 
where the filters are located in the ca r. 
• Buy aftermarket filters that come 
with step-by-step instructions from an 
auto parts store. The odds of the orig-
inal equipment parts coming with 
instructions are extremely slim. Do all 
aftermarket filters have them? No, 
but if you're shopping at a parts store, 
you should be able to check in the 
boxes on the shelves. Also, these parts 
probably will cost less. 
Replacing the Filters 
in the Air Intake 
The filter in the outside air intake 
(even if there are other filters) 
takes care of most of the dust and 
REPLACING YOUR CABIN AIR FILTER 
pollen, so it's likely to plug first. 
T he typical procedure begins with 
removing the air intake screen, which 
is held by "Christmas tree" plastic 
fasteners. If the "tree" has a center 
pin, pry it up with a thin-blade screw-
driver and then wiggle the tree out of 
the hole (Fig. 1). If the tree is a single-
piece design, you'll have to pry it out. 
Most of the time, it will break and 
you'll have to replace it (blister packs 
of replacements are sold in most auto 
parts stores). 
If there's a rain/snow deflector 
over the fi lter, remove it, then extract 
the element. The fi lter element may 
be held by a plastic tab, or it may 
slip into a retainer ho using th at yo u 
will reuse w ith the new element. 
Some dust may have gotten around 
o r through the filter. Use a vacuum 
cleaner to clean the outside air intake 
duct (Fig. 2). Be careful when you 
reinstall the a ir intake 
screen, as well as any 
cover over the fi lter ele-
ment. If the gasket surface 
aro und the screen does not 
seal, or if the cover (actu-
a lly a shield, in most 
cases) is not reinstalled, 
rainwater can flow into 
the fi lter, saturating it. 
In the Case, 
above the Blower 
If the filter is in the case 
above the blower, most 
likely it is behind the 
glovebox. Removing the 
glovebox may be easy, but you may 
not have to remove it at all. 
Ma ny filters (such as on most 
Hondas and Toyotas) are just above 
the blower behind the glovebox, and 
you'll have to drop it for access. In the 
best of cases, you can flex the sides of 
the box so the pins clear the dash, 
then pivot the box down for clear-
ance. In others, the entire glove box 
assembly has to come out, wh ich 
means removing a number of retaining 
screws, not all of which are visible. 
Replacing 
Midcase Filters 
T he midcase filters may not always be 
easy, but remember, the setup was 
designed to allow filter replacement, 
so don't assume the worst. 
There are pull tabs taped in place in 
GM sedans that have two or three fil-
ters in the same HVAC case located 
261 

above the gas pedal. Pull a 
tape to release the tab, then 
pull the tab to withdraw the 
filter. Ditto for the others. 
All filters need perimeter 
sealing, so air flows only 
through the filter element. 
With side-by-side filters, the 
sealing may be a simple 
foam rubber strip. Or there 
may be interlocking guides. 
O n many cars the filter will 
come straight down and hit 
the floor without clearing 
the HVAC case. Nothing'S 
wrong. Most of these filters 
are flexible, and you have to 
bend them to get them out 
and the new ones in. 
How to Buy 
Even if the filter location is 
accessible, the toughest job 
may be getting the right replacement 
filter. One of the most common 
complaints among professionals is 
that the aftermarket catalogs haven't 
kept up with the year-to-year 
changes, particularly with filters that 
fit under the dash where the space 
provided may have changed. 
The cabin filter is a type of air fil-
ter that in some respects-such 
as pleating to provide a lot of 
surface area in a small pack-
age-may resemble an engine air 
filter. However, it usually is made 
of different materials, the main 
one being a charcoal layer in 
many elements. Like some 
engine air filters, the dust and 
pollen filtering element is elec-
trostatically charged, which 
means it's made with fiber parti-
cles that have been given either 
a positive or negative static elec-
If a vehicle has more than one fil-
ter, you may not find both in the same 
box, especially if they are in different 
locations. And they may have totally 
different part numbers. This is partic-
ularly true if one filter is in the air 
intake and others are in the HVAC 
case. The one in the air intake is more

Cabin Filter 
likely to be a simple par-
ticulate filter, one that just 
traps small particles. The 
one under the dash is more 
likely to have a charcoal 
layer for odor control. 
No matter what the 
original equipment element 
is, the aftermarket one is 
more likely to be a partiCll-
late filter, rather than the 
more sophisticated type 
with a charcoal layer. 
Should you get the char-
coal filter, which may cost 
a lot more? If you're in a 
densely populated area 
with slow-moving traffic, 
or your carpool partner 
fancies Mexican food, the 
extra cost is worth it. 
If you're not facing an 
odor problem, you may 
save money with a low-cost particu-
late-only replacement for an original-
equipment filter with a charcoal layer. 
An aftermarket particulate element 
does fi lter finely enough to remove 
pollen as well as dust particles, so if 
pollen and dust are your major con-
cerns, save your money. G 
This means that fiber material 
with pores of a specific size will 
trap particles larger than the size 
of the pores. The charcoal filtra-
tion layer removes odors. 
The charcoal is "activated," 
which means it is treated with 
chemicals and heat to give it 
specific odor-control properties. 
Each manufacturer has its own 
recipe, based on tests with indi-
viduals who have "sensitive 
noses," including people who 
work as perfume testers. Char-
coal traps odor-causing gases by 
trical charge. Airborne particles are negatively or posi-
tively charged, so they are attracted to the opposite-
charge fibers. 
In addition, the filter performs "mechanical filtration." 
adsorption (not absorption), holding them on the sur-

he traffic seems unusually 
light th is morning. In fact, you 
haven't seen another car to 
the rear for 10 miles. Time to make 
a little time. 
But then there's a strange noise fol-
lowing you. Sounds like a siren. 
Hmmm. No lights behind you, so 
where is that sound coming from? 
It's coming from the police car 
that's riding your tail. You didn't see 
it because your glued-on rearview 
mirror isn't on the wi ndshield. It's 
lying on the floor under the seat 
where your 4-year-old has hidden it 
after discovering he couldn't do chin-
ups on it. Tell that one to the judge.

IMAGEr! 
GLASS 
Most cars and trucks come with a manually dimmable 
day/night prismatic rearview mirror. You toggle a little 
lever from the day position to the night position. And the 
mirror glass is not flat, but rather beveled. The top edge 
is thicker than the bottom edge. Here's how the 
day/night function works. 
In the day position, the image you see is reflected off 
the silvered surface on the back face of the mirror glass. 
The image is crisp and bright, because the silver provides 
an almost total reflection (80%) of the object. 
In the night position, the toggle mechanism tilts the 
mirror glass upward slightly. Now, the bright day image 
is deflected off the silvered surface and up into the 
vehicle's headliner. And the front (plain glass) surface of 
the mirror takes over, providing a 5% reflective image. 
Everything appears very dark, but you can still monitor 
t raffic behind you. 
Many carmakers offer an automatically dimming elec-
trochromic rearview mirror that provides an infinite num-
ber of brightness levels. These darken automatically 
according to ambient light conditions and the amount of 
headlight glare. Sensors feed input to electronics that 
determine how much voltage to apply to a special gel 
sandwiched between thin layers of reflective glass in the 
rear and clear glass up front. The more glare present, the 
more voltage is applied, and the darker the gel becomes. 
263 

Reattachment 
Luckil y, gluing your rearview mirror 
back on is one of the easiest jobs for a 
Saturday mechanic. What you need 
most is patience and a clean working 
environment. Warm weather helps, 
too, but it isn't mandatory. 
Start by running down to your 
local auto parts store and picking up 
a rearview-mirror ad hesive ki t. It'll 
come with a vial of superstrong glue 
and a vial of accelerant to help the 
glue cure very quickly. There are usu-
all y instructions on the back of the 
cardboard packaging, too, should you 
need some guidance. You'll also need 
a razor-blade-type scraper, a small 
Allen wrench that fits the lockscrew 
on your mirror's baseplate, a grease 
pencil or some masking tape and, 
depending on your particular circum-
stances, a tape measure and a heat 
gun or hair dryer. 
Ready? 
Prepare to work outside with the win-
dows open, as the adhesive kit wi ll 
probably contain acrylic acid, 
methacrylic ester and trichloroethyl-
ene, which you don't want to breathe 
in large quantities. 
Because the adhesive cures faster in 
warm ambient temperatures, plan on 
using the heat gun or hair dryer to 
warm the glass if you're forced to do 
this job on a cold day. But use coml11on 
sense. Ice-cold glass will not appreciate 
being blasted by intense heat. You'll 
almost definitely crack the windshield 
this way. To avoid this, hold the heat 
gun or hair dryer about 12 to 18 in. 
away from the glass and waft the warm 
air back and forth to gradually increase 
the glass temperature. And make sure 
to scrape off the old glue before warm-
ing the glass or you'll create a gooey 
mess (Fig. 1). An alternative is to park 
the car facing the sun for a few hours 
before beginning the job. 
If the old mirror left behind an 
obvious amount of residue on the 
inside of the glass, you won't need the 
tape measure to locate the midpoint 
of the windshield. But if you, say, for-
got to mark the spot before you 
cleaned the glass completely, simply

measure halfway across the top of the 
window and about 3 to 4 in. down 
fro m the headliner, and that wi ll be 
your new mounting point. 
You can begin the remounting 
process by marking the outside of the 
window with a grease pencil over the 
area where the old glue is. Or you can 
cordon off the area on the inside with 
masking tape. (Some sort of mark is 
useful should you get interrupted 
after removing the old glue.) The lat-
ter is the neater way to work, but 
leave adequate room around the work 
area for scraping and cleaning. Now, 
go at the old glue with your scraper. 
INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR 

Once you're down to smooth glass 
again, wipe the spot down with iso-
propyl alcohol to get it squeaky clea n. 
Do the same thing on the back of the 
mirror baseplate so that you have 
clean metal to work with. Don't 
touch either surface once it's cleaned 
or the oil that comes off your fingers 
will contaminate it. 
The Acceleration Phase 
The accelerant (primer) vial wi ll have 
a double wa ll of plastic. The inside 
wall is designed to crack open when 
you bend the tube. The outside wa ll 
simply flexes. This allows the acceler-
ant to drench the felt tip of the vial 
without leaking out all over your 
hands. Appl y the accelerant libera ll y 
to the mounting point on the glass. It 
needs 5 minutes to dry. 
In the meantime, use your Allen 
wrench to undo the lockscrew and 
release the mirror from its baseplate. 
It's much easier to glue the baseplate 
onto the windshield first and install 
the mirror later. Working with the 
whole assembl y is too awkward. 
Once the baseplate is free, goop up 
its flat mounting surface with the 
accelerant and let it dry, as well (Fig. 2). 
Don't touch either of the treated areas 
as they're now ready to accept the 
adhesive, which will cure faster because 
of the accelerant. 
Adhesive Time 
Now you're ready to apply the adhe-
sive. Neatly goop up the back of the 
baseplate and carefully press it onto 
the glass. Squoosh it around just a lit-
tle bit to get good adhesion-and 
keep applying pressure. Don't let go 
for at least 2 minutes while the adhe-
sive begins to set up (Fig. 3). Then let 
it dry for at least another 15 minutes. 
If it's really cold out, a little warm air 
from the heat gun or hair dryer

(Fig. 4) After gluing the baseplate onto 
the glass, mount the mirror and tighten 
its lockscrew with an Allen wrench. 
should speed up the curing process. 
Remember, 15 minutes is a minimum. 
It's best to let the adhesive cure as 
long as it is convenient- even 
overn ight-before reattach ing the 
mirror to the baseplate and tightening 
the lockscrew (Fig. 4). 
If you're a neatnick, trim the excess 
glue around the baseplate with a knife 
or one of the corners of your scraper 
blade. Then reattach the mirror and 
readjust it for a safe rearward view. 
Oh. And don't pull on the mirror 
to see how tightl y it's mounted. With 
Murphy's Law always in effect, you 
just might rip it off the window again. 
Just leave the mirror be-and keep 
your kid out of the front seat. The 
mirror will probably stay up tbere for 
the life of the car. tI

EASY 
Repairing Your 
Rear-Window Defroster 
I
t was a dark and stormy night. 
Snow has covered the entire car 
to a depth of several inches. It 
takes a few minutes to clear the snow, 
and by then the engine has warmed 
up enough to melt the frost clinging 
to the inside of the windshield, and 
has actually made inroads to the frost 
on the side windows. But the rear-
window defroster clears onl y a nar-
row strip near the top and bottom of 
the window, leaving a wide strip of 
glass as translucent as a barrister's 
door, and absolutely no visibility to 
the rear. 
A worse scenario: The rear-win-
dow defroster grid has packed it in 
completely, requiring you to either 
drive blind (bad idea), or resort to 
scraping the rea r wi ndow clear with 
your trusty plastic scraper. 
Danger! 
Let us make this perfectly clear: 
The resistance wires are silk-screened, 
essentially painted, onto the glass. 
They are very easy to scratch, and will 
not work properly if the scratch 
breaks the continuity along the wire. 
This means that it's possible for 
boxes, furniture or any other hard 
object one might place in a car to 
scratch the wire. Even a credit card 
can damage it. Don't cram stuff into 
the back, and don't let the load shift 
backward in your mini van so that it 
touches the glass. If your window has 
a defroster grid, the onl y thing that 
should ever touch the glass is a soft 
cloth dampened with window cleaner. 
If you must clean the rear glass, scrub 
gently, and in the direction of the grid, 
not across it. 
You don't want to have to replace 
the glass to effect this repair. The 
compound-curve style of rear win-
dow is several hund red dollars, and a 
large hatchback's backlite on, say, a 
Camaro, can easily top a grand or

rear of the car are intact. 
more. Add the price of insta llation at 
the dealership or a glass shop-it's 
definitely not covered by insurance. 
No Heat at All 
Suppose your defroster grid doesn't 
work at all. First, check the obvious: Is 
the fuse okay? Defroster grids draw a 
lot of current (10 to 20 amps), and if 
the fuse is undersize, it won't last. If 
the fuse doesn't look blown, check 
with your voltmeter- with the key on 
and the defroster on, you should see 
12 volts at both grid terminals (Fig. 1). 
If the voltage is fine, the problem is 
somewhere in the wiring or at the grid. 
Check the connections from the wiring 
harness to the grid. It's easy for the 
terminals at the grid to become dam-
aged. Genera lly, the tab that's attached 
to the glass breaks off, leaving you 
with a dangling wire and no way to 
reattach it. You have two repair 
options here: soldering and gluing. 
If you know how to solder and 
have a high-capacity soldering iron 
or gun, solder the tab back on 
(Fig. 2). It may take a third hand to 
hold the tab against the grid wh ile 
you solder it. There's usually a metal 
strip laid on the glass under the silk-
screening. Clean the surfaces with 
alcohol and use 60-40 rosin-core sol-
der. Work fast, because excess heat 
may crack the glass. 
If yo u aren't confident a bout yo ur 
soldering skills, or aren't ready to 
take a chance on cracking an expen-
sive piece of glass, there's another 
way. The dealership and most auto 
parts stores can sell you a special 
electrically conductive epoxy to bond 
the tab back on (Fig. 3). If it's win-
tertime, you'll need to work in a 
heated garage, and ha ve the vehicle 
inside long enough for it to warm up 
to at least 65
0 F. Again, clean the 
area with alcohol. Mask the glass 
with tape to keep from getting epoxy 
smeared on it. Mix up a sparing

full strength. The repa ir will never be 
as strong as the original w ire, so 
you'll need to be particularly careful 
not to damage it in th e future. 
Deeper Problems 
Fuse okay ? G rid attached to the glass 
everywhere, but simply no defrosting 
action at all? Look for a bad switch, 
relay or timer. For this you'll need a 
schematic diagra m, or considera ble 
experience in tro ubleshooting wiring 
for the grid's operation. This mayor 
may not be integra l with the timer. A 
di agnostic procedure would be to 
jumper the relay'S terminals to see if 
the relay is bad. You can either jump 
12 volts to the relay'S coil to make it 
pull in, or bypass the relay with a 
large-gauge jumper to see if the grid's 
wiring is intact between the relay and 
the window. A separate relay should 
be inexpensive and ava ilable at any 
auto parts store, but if it's in the same 
package with the timer you' ll pay as 
much as a hundred bucks. 
Don't try to bypass the timer. Rear-
window defrosters draw a substantial 
amount of current-10 to 20 amps 
depending on the applica tion. Most 
modern cars use a timer circui t to 
turn the grid off after a reasonable 
length of time. T here are two reasons 
for this. T he fi rst is to reduce the elec-
tricalload on the alternator, which 
(especiall y du ring the wintertime) also 
supplies electricity for the headlights,

heater fa n and windshield wipers. 
Couple that with the extra demands 
on the battery for starting in cold 
weather, and there may simply not be 
enough alternator capacity to keep 
the battery charged adequately. 
T he second reason is simpler-the 
grid may overheat if it's left on too 
long. Imagine accidentally leaving it 
on during a long trip on a summer 
day. The heat from the grid added to 
the heat of the sun may crack the 
glass o r contribute to deterioration of 
the window's rubber gaskets. 
If you need to replace the timer or 
switch, you' ll probably have to go to 
the ca r dea ler fo r the parts. 
Easy Fixes 
Suppose your grid has several lines 
that don't heat. You may be able to 
find the brea k by simply inspecting 
the silk-screened grid along its length . 
T his will be easier on hatchbacks, 
mini va ns and SUVs because you can 
open the back up and look at the lines 
aga inst the sky. Sedans will require 
you to crawl into the back and poke 
your head into the area above the rear

deck. Otherwise, you' ll need to drag 
out the trusty DC voltmeter and hunt 
for it electrica lly. 
Set your voltmeter for the 20-volt 
scale, and attach a couple of postage-
stamp-size pieces of aluminum foil to 
the leads (Fig. 4). This will prevent 
the probes from scratching the grid. 
Yo u can simply lay the aluminum-
268 
fo il tabs on the glass and press 
lightly with one finger to make con-
nection with the grid. If the window 
is large, it may help to have another 
pair of hands. 
Start by measuring the voltage 
across the enti re length of the grid. 
W ith the key on and the defroster 
turned on you should see 12 volts on 
the meter with one tab at either end 
of the grid. Now move one tab to 
the center of the grid and measure 
agai n. The voltage should read 12 
volts if the break is between the 
ta bs, less if the break is outside of 
the tabs. Similarly, measure the volt-
age on a grid line that is working 
properly, and you should see 
approximately 6 volts at the center, 
because yo u've just turned your 
defroster grid into a giant rheostat. 
By moving the ta b along the dam-
aged line, yo u'll see 12 volts on the 
meter until you reach the break, 
where the voltage will drop consid-
erably a ll at once. This should allow 
you to pinpoint the break . 
Repa iri ng the grid is simple. Many 
auto departments in large stores, and 
almost any dedicated auto parts 
store, can sell you a repair kit. Clean 
the area of the break with alcohol 
and a fres h, untinted paper towel. 
Don't use window cleaner, as it may 
leave a residue of wax or silicone. 
The kit will have an adhe-
sive template to stick over 
the break, but you can 
use ordinary masking 
tape just as easily. The 
masking tape can be used 
to make a new line that 
exactly matches the width 
of your old grid, if the 
mask in the kit is too 
wide or narrow. Paint a 
stripe of the kit's conduc-
tive paint across the 
break (Fig. 5). Allow it to 
dry for 10 to 15 minutes 
and remove the mask. 
If you have severa l grid 
li nes that are damaged, 
simply repeat the process. 
If the lines are damaged in 
more than one place along 
their length, you'll have to 
go back to step one and 
fi nd the next break. S

breaks in the continuity of

Every drop of rain that splatters on

good wipers won't remove this kind 
of mess. It takes a cleaner with a 
super-fine abrasive that won't scratch 
the glass, and, although there are 
household cleaners in that category, 
auto parts stores now carry ones 
made specifica lly fo r windshields. 
When a windshield is clean, water 
from a garden hose should "sheet"-
flow across it, not bead up. 
For winter-freeze protection, fill 
the washer reservoir with a cleaning 
solution with washer antifreeze, not 
just a mixture of water and alco hol or 
ordin ary antifreeze. And never use an 
abrasive windshield cleaner in the 
washer reservoir. 
Check the spray pattern of the 
washer nozzle. Although some are 
nonadjusta ble, individual tube-type 
nozzles can be bent slightly to 
improve the spray position, and the 
base of the nontubular type ma y be

permit chatter to get started. Pans 
replacement is in order here. 
Lift the arm. If it feels weak, com-
pare it with another car, or measure it 
on a fish scale. The typical arm, lifted 
from the blade end, should take 
about 30 ounces. (Note, however, 
that fish scales aren't much more 
accura te than afisherma n's esti ma te 
of the length of the big one that got 
away.) If the arm spring is weak, 
replacements could set you back 
more than $70. Instead, insta ll helper 
springs-they're sold in auto parts 
stores for just a few dollars (Fig. 1). 
Inspect the wiper blades' rubber 
inserts (the sq ueegees) for cracks or 
other deterioration. It's best to remove 
the blade, hold it in from of you and 
see if the rubber squeegee tip is 
absolutely straight down the center of 
the blade. If it's wavy or tilted notice-
ably to one side, replace it (Fig. 2). If 
the blade is good, only the squeegee 
need be replaced. 1£ the squeegee itself 
is good, apply a lubricant made for 
KEEPING YOUR WINDSHIELD CLEAR 
natural rubber to both sides. A quick 
smear of lube once every week or two 
should not only extend the squeegee's 
life, bur improve its everyday perfor-
mance (Fig. 3). Again, look in the auto 
parts store for rubber lubricant. Don't 
use silicone. 
Fogged In 
If the inside of the windshield has a 
permanent "fog," it may be caused by 
interior air pollution, including 
tobacco smoke and fumes from plas-
tic trim. Vinegar does a good job of 
removing it, but be sure to wash the 
glass to help clear away the odor. 
Another opti on is to clean the glass 
with an antifog formula, which leaves 
an in visible coating that retards inte-
rior fogging. Unfortunately, the for-
mulas we've seen are not recom-
mended for tinted windows, so watch 
where you apply it, or simply stick 
with vi negar. 
When you use the defroster, many 
cars' venti lation systems automatic-
a lly turn on the alc compressor, even 
(Fig. 4) If the blower isn't up to

in winter (temperatures 
above 50° F), to condense the 
interior moistu re. If yo ur sys-
tem has a separate alc com-
pressor control, you may 
have to push the alc button 
to get the desired effect. And 
if your control panel has a 
separate button or lever fo r 
outside air versus recircu-
lated air, choose outside 
air-it' ll help purge the in-
terior moisture that you an d 
yo ur passengers re lease, 
which is a majo r ca use of the 
fog that mars a norma ll y 
clean windshield. This prob-
a bly sounds counterintu-
itive-isn't there plenty of 
moisture coming in with the 
fresh air from the cowl vent? 
Trust us. Fresh air will evaporate 
more mist. 
Just because you hear the blower 
fan doesn't mean the air is blowing 
against the windshield, so put your 
hand over the defroster outlets. If the 
airflow is weak, either the venrilati on-
control system is misbeha ving, a 
cabin air filter is plugged, or there's a 
dashboard duct unplugged, ca using 
the airflow to leak out before it gets 
to the windshield. If there's strong air-
flow from another duct when you 
select defrost, the control panel is 
probably at fault. 
1£ the blower doesn't seem to come 
up to speed but is turning, there's a 
fair chance that the high-blower relay 
used on many cars is faulty. Inspect 
the area around the blower motor, and 
if there's a relay wired to it, check the 
connection (Fig. 4). And look around 
for an inline fuse-wired to the 
relay-to inspect. It could be blown.

swabs, a toothbrush and a plethora of 
cleaning, conditioning and dressing 
products. By the time you've dried off 
the body, slapped a coat of wax on the 
finish and buffed it out, your neighbor 
is only up to square two. So you move 
on to the other Great American Rit-
ual-the backyard barbecue, leaving 
your neighbor elbow-deep in his 
bucket of soapsuds. 
Later, after scarfing down your 
fifth hot dog and third ear of corn, 
you sa unter over to your neigh bor 
on the pretext of offering him a bar-
becued chicken thigh. But you rea lly 
want to see the kind of job he's 
doing. His vehicle is about the same 
vintage and in the same condition as 
yours, but his car gleams like a jewel. 
Yours just looks clean. 
272 
What's your neighbor's secret? He 
went the detailing route-a process 
that goes beyond the ordinary wash-
and-wax job. Detailing is just that-
paying close attention to sma ll details. 
Sure, it takes a lot more time and 
effort, but the results can be nothing 
short of eye popping. 
Professional detailers have devel-
oped their own tricks of the trade for 
everything from vehicle washing to 
cleaning windows to getting ventila-
tion grilles looking supercrisp. To get 
their results, use products designed 
for specific areas- wheels, trim, win-
dows, etc. Name-brand products are 
a safe bet. Be sure to read labels to get 
the best finish. 
Where to Start 
The interior is a good starting point, 
so the dust and dirt you brush out 
won't settle on a pristine exterior. 
Remove any floor mats and give the 
cai:peting and upholstery a good vac-
uuming. Also vacuum the dash and 
rear parcel shelf. Move the front seats 
full fore and aft to get to all the accu-
(Fig. 1) Use a Q-tip to scour interior 
recesses that have collected dust. 
mulated dirt and loose change. If the 
carpets are clean except for a minor 
stain or two, use a foaming cleaner to 
get them out. Saturate the stain with 
cleaner, working it in with a damp 
sponge. Let it sit awhile and then blot 
it out with paper towels or a dry cot-
ton cloth. Repeat if necessary, and 
then go over the area with a damp 
sponge before final blotting. Don't 
oversaturate the carpet and risk get-
ting mildew. 
You can repair burns and holes in 
your carpet by cutting out the offend-
ing area with a razor blade or scissors. 
Then cut a similar-size piece from a 
hidden spot, such as underneath the 
seat, and cement it in place using a 
water-resistant adhesive. Blend in the 
repair by brushing the nap. 
Wash the floor mats, if they're 
rubber, and apply a dressing that 
does not leave a slippery finish, for 
obvious reasons. 
Clean interior hard surfaces with a 
damp cloth and a mild all-purpose 
cleaner such as Simple Green, diluted 
about 10:l. If you have vinyl-covered 
seats, use a conditioner made for that 
material. Avoid products that give a 
high-gloss, slippery surface, so pas-
sengers won't feel like they're on a 
roller coaster. If you have leather 
upholstery, dress the surfaces with a 
leather conditioner. Never use a vinyl 
product on leather. 
Worn or torn areas of vinyl can be 
repaired using kits made for this pur-
pose that are available at auto supply 
stores. Repairs are made with a patch 
that lets you match the color and 
grain of your upholstery. Worn areas 
of leather can be touched up with 
dyes or a high-grade shoe polish. Just 
make sure you match the color as 
closely as possible. 
The dash presents a special chal-

lenge, with buttons, 
crevices and bezels that you 
can't get to with a cleaning 
rag. You can blast dust and 
dirt from these areas by 
using small cans of com-
pressed air made for clean-
ing camera and computer 
equipment. Cotton swabs 
also work well here (Fig. 1). 
Pay attention to the clean-
ing products you use on 
your dash. If your dash has 
a flat finish, don't use a 
product on it that will leave 
you facing a shiny gloss. 
Clean air vent grilles with 
cotton swabs and brighten 
them up by misting on some 
spray-on vinyl/rubber dress-
ing or accent spray-just a 
touch. You can also use 
these products to cover up 
light scuff marks on wood 
trim. Spray the stuff on a 
soft towel and then apply it 
to the wood. 
Clean glass or plastic 
gauge lenses with a glass or 
plastic cleaner, not wax. Pull 
off any removable knobs to 
clean the bezels underneath. 
Ever wonder where the haze on the 
inside of your windshield comes from,

worry- a good glass cleaner or vinegar 
should remove it. If your windows are 
really cruddy, you may have to resort 
to stronger measures, such as scrub-
bing with 4-ought steel wool. 
HOW IT WORKS 
Clearcoat Paint 
A Word of Caution 
If you have aftermarket window 
tint film, it may be degraded by 
cleaners that contain ammonia 
or vinegar. Factory tinting is in 
the glass and is not affected by 
these cleaners. One trick used by 
some detailers for the final 
touch on window glass is to 
rinse it down with seltzer and 
do a final wipe with a ball of 
crumpled newspaper. 
When it comes to first impres-
sions, nothing makes a hit like a 
jewel finish. But this is possible 
only after any paint problems 
are corrected. Just about all fin-
ishes today are a 2-step (color) 
basecoat and a protective 
clearcoat. The top clearcoat is 
only about 2-3 mils thick, and 
when it gets scratched or 
abraded it refracts light and the 
color coat underneath doesn't 
shine through clearly. It's like 
looking through a scratched or 
foggy lens. 
To evaluate your paint, first 
wash your vehicle. Work in the 
shade and make sure the surface 
is cool. Use a carwash soap, not 
a household detergent, and 
work in sections, from the top down. 
The lower panels tend to accumulate 
more abrasive dirt. To do a final rinse, 
remove the spray head from the hose 
and flood the finish. The water will 
Most modern cars use a clearcoat paint system. The pig-
mented layer of paint, whether a solid color, metallic or 
pearlescent, is covered with a layer of clear paint to pro-

more clearcoat. The recommended procedure for oxidation 
and haze is to use a chemical cleaner or cleaner wax. Look 
for products that specifically say they are appropri-
ate for clearcoat paint on the label. Light 
scratches can be buffed out with very 
mild polishing compound. Do not use 
rubbing compound on a clearcoat fin-
ish. Scratches that go through the 
clearcoat layer cannot be polished 
out, although some "color in polish" 
But the surface of any paint, even clearcoat, is 
vulnerable to scratches and oxidation. In 
the past, abrasive rubbing compound 
could be used to polish out these imper-
fections. Clearcoat is thinner, and using 
abrasives is trickier. Removing too much 
paint will leave the pigment layer 
exposed, necessitating a respray with

mizing spotting. Dry with a 
good-quality chamois or a soft 
thick-nap terry cloth towel. 
Don't forget the wheel wells. 
Get the crud our with an all-
purpose cleaner and a good 
high-pressure dousing. After 
you've finished washing your 
car, apply a vinyl dressing to 
add some snap to the wells. 
Wash the wheels (make sure 
they're cool) with a brush made 
for this purpose, but do not use 
acid-based cleaners on polished 
alloy wheels or w heels that are 
c1ea rcoated. You can use these 
cleaners on rough-textured 
alloy w heels. Chrome w heels 
can be gleamed up with metal 
polish or glass clea ner. 
After washing the cal; inspect the 
paint. Stains and scratches can be 
attacked with a good c1earcoat-safe 
cleaner. The worse the problem, the 
more aggressive the cleaner needed. 
Starr off with the least abrasive 
product and gradually move to 
coarser cleaners as required. Then 
machine buff (Fig. 2). 
Polishing and/or waxing is 
next. Be sure to include door-
jambs, and the areas beneath 
door hinges and behind 
bumpers. Minor blemishes may 
be neutralized by wrapping a 
cotton cloth around your index 
finger and burnishing the polish 
into the finish. Polish not only

the paint with oils to prevent it fro m

in min ute scratches in the c1earcoat 
layer, restoring its clarity. If you 
machine-buff the polish/wax to a high 
luster, go with an orbital rather than a 
rotary model, w hich would be more 
likely to burn the paint. Treat the 
plastic chrome on today's cars as if it 
were a painted surface and protect it 
with a light coat of wax. 
274 
Avoid getting wax or polish on 
rubber and flat black plastic areas 
(clean them with a nongloss prod-
uct), door handles and em blems. If 
you do get a wax stain on rubber 
trim, spray it with a mist-and-wipe 
prod uct and wipe it down with a 
terry cloth towel. If that doesn 't do 
the trick, this usually works: 
Microwave some peanut butter and 
apply it to the stain with a soft 
toothbrush. Peanut butter's oils dis-
solve the wax and it's a brasive 
enough to lift the sta in (but it ca n 
stick to the roof of yo ur car). 
If you get a polish/wax residue 
around emblems or in crevices, break 
our the cotton swa bs and tooth-
brushes (Fig. 3). It's important that 
you first wet the area with a mist-and-
wipe product such as Meguiar's Q uick 
Deta iler. Never brush on a dry surface. 
Moving underhood, protect elec-
tronic components by wrapping them 
in plastic. T hen spray on a diluted all-

alignments, however, often can be 
minimized with little more than sim-
ple hand tools and a careful eye. 
Hoods and Trunks 
The simplest misalignment, and the 
one most often seen while cruising 
parking lots, is a vertical misalignment 
of the corner of a hood or trunk. The 
corner of these opening panels is nor-
mally held at the correct height, even 
with the lip of the fender that abuts it, 
by a simple rubber snubber. This snub-
ber is usually threaded into a hole in a 
corner of the panel. Rudimentary 
threads in the sheetmetal allow the 
snubber to be screwed in and out by 
hand. On some vehicles, the snubber is 
in the hood or trunk panel, sometimes 
in the bodywork below the panel. Sim-
ply screw the snubber in or out until 
the offending panel is flush (Fig. 1). 
Some older cars may use a snubber 
with a threaded rod and jam nut on a 
steel stud. You'll need to loosen the 
jam nut, adjust the snubber, and then 
tighten the jam nut with a wrench to 
keep it from shifting. Genera lly, a half-
turn or so is sufficient. 
More severe misalignment may 
make the panel's latch either too loose 
or too tight to open and close prop-
erly. Loose latches will rattle. Latches 
that are too tight will break finger-
nails, and will eventually break the 
cable to the interior handle. Fortu-
nately, most hood and trunk latches' 
are adjustable. You may need nothing 
more than an open-end wrench, or 
perhaps an Allen wrench (Fig. 2). 
Sometimes the latch assembly itself is 
adjustable. Occasionally, the catch on 
the mating panel can be adjusted 
instead of the latch assembly. Loosen 
the appropriate hardware slightly, 
and tap the assembly just enough to 
move it almost as far as you moved

the snubber. Tighten the hardware, 
and try closing the hood or trunk. 
The latch release should pop easily, 
and the latch shouldn't rattle. Try for

snubber on a hood. On a trunk you 
are likely to find rubber gaskets to 
compress, and there may be more 
resistance before the latch pawl snaps 
home.

strength to pop the latch 
open. If you've painted your-
self into a corner and can't 
open the trunk, try having 
someone else hit the trunk 
release while you push down 
on the trunklid. This should 
release enough pressure on 
the pawl to let it move. 
Fore and Aft 
Maybe the hood or trunklid 
is aligned vertically, but the 
panel is sitting crooked, or is 
just too close to the window glass. 
You'll need to adjust the hinges. Use a 
felt-tip pen or a pencil to mark the 
location of the hinges on the inside of 
the panel. Loosen the attaching hard-
ware just enough to be able to slide 
the panel to a new position. Do only 
one side at a time (Fig. 3). Tighten a 
little, then close the panel and check 
its alignment. It' ll probably take a few 
iterations, but you should be able to 
get the panel to center in its intended

space. After all is said and 
done, it may not be possible to 
get the gaps in the panel to be 
symmetrical. It's not unusual 
for the gaps to change their 
width from the front to the 
rear of the panel. You may 
need to strike a compromise 
between getting the panel to 
sit square in its intended recess 
both fore and aft, and making 
all the gaps symmetrical. 
If the gaps are square and 
the panel is sitting so that it's 
symmetrical, but the gap is

other, there is a fix. With the

shove back in the other direction. The 
first time you try this, close the panel

Don't loosen both hinges together

a small amount of wear by raising the 
hinges on the pillar. You'll need a

EASY 
Prepping Your Car For Paint 
J
unior has asked to borrow the 
keys for his big date on Friday. 
So you reach into your pocket 
for the keys to your pickup, tradition-
ally his weapon of choice for cruising 
with the big guys. But this time he 
demurs-Betty Sue thinks the truck is 
too nasty-looking, and he'd prefer to 
use Mom's car. 
After the shock of rejection 
wears off, you stroll out and exam-
ine the pickup. After all, when a 
teenager thinks your truck needs 
cosmetic improvement, it's time to 
pull off the blinders and think abo ut 
a little bodywork. 
Painting Is For Pros 
Prep work aside, automotive painting 
couldn't be easier. With a little experi-
ence, spraying an entire car should 
only take about 20 minutes. 
All you need is an air compressor 
and a spray gun. Oh yea h, you'll also 
need a $30,000 downdraft spray 
booth (with baking cycle), a supplied-
air respirator and a real knack for 
smoothly flowing on pa int without 
runs, sags or orange peel. 
There's the rub. You may have a 
compressor and spray gu n, but even 
large body shops can barely afford 
the other stuff. And when you con-
sider that chain refinishers such as 
Earl Scheib and Maaco can do an 
adequate job of painting your current 
ride for $150 to $300, it makes sense 
to leave paint work to the pros. 
Besides, for absolutely optimum 
results, 90% of a good paint job is 
not in the painting anyway, it's in the 
pre-painting preparation. And you 
can do that yourself. 
As you might guess, budget paint 
jobs don't include a whole lot of prep 
work. For $149.95, Earl Scheib's 
preparation includes machine sand-
ing, chemically cleaning the body, 
spot priming areas that need it and

masking over things that aren't sup-
posed to be painted-basica ll y the 
windows. At some cut-rate shops, 
chrome and badges are negotiable. 
Any necessary bodywork costs extra . 
Doing your own light bodywork 
such as fixing small dents and door 
dings or repairing rusty areas can save 
you a lot of money and help ensure 
the quality of the finished job. You 
can also greatly improve the quality 
of a budget paint job by removing 
and sanding under items that the 
painters would normally mask over, 
such as badges and assorted trim (Fig. 
1). But don't start sanding and dis-
mantling your car first. A body shop 
will be much more receptive to your 
plan if you let them know what 
you're going to do ahead of time.

your vehicle, you'll save yourself

work and aggravation if you plan to 
keep it the same color. Among other 
things, you can avoid the hours of 
prep work and extra expense of 
painting doorjambs and the underside 
of the trunklid and hood.You also 
avoid the chance of unpainted spots 
rearing themselves unexpectedly. A 
paint match costs extra over the few 
standard colors of the " basic bar-
gain" price. It's worth the investment. 
Start your paint prep by taking 
your vehicle to a do-it-yourself car 
wash. Pressure washing the engine, 
doorjambs, wheel wells and other 
under-body areas wi ll help to ensure a 
dust-free paint job later. Cleaning the

the paint comes loose. After th at, 
pa int-peel is just a ca r wash away. 
The onl y effecti ve way to keep paint 
from peeling is to remove each part and 
sand under it. To have a body shop 
remove all these pieces can cost hun-
dreds of dollars in labor- which is why 
the discount shops mask off all those 
parts (maybe). You can remove them 
yourself, however, and make a discount 
paint job look like a top-dollar custom 
paint job and have the paint finish last 
years longer. It's not practical to 
remove the windshield, rear window 
and door glass. But you can remove 
items that are common starting points 
for peeling problems, such as lock 
cylinders, door handles, luggage racks, 
radio antennas and side mi rrors. 
Take It All Off 
To remove these parts, it's best to 
consult your vehicle's factory shop 
manual, but here are some general 
procedures. Ma ke sure the window 
is ro lled up, then remove interi or 
door hardware such as th e armrest, 
window cra nk and inner handle, 
then pry (or unscrew ) the inner panel 
off the door. Lock cylinders are 
usually held in place with a spring 
clip. Door handles and mi rrors are 
usuall y held by small bolts. The 
radi o antenna, hood emblems and 
body badges are other places where 
pa int can peel. Us ua ll y, it's not neces-
sary to completely remove the 
antenna. Simply loosen the top 
retaining nut that holds the antenna

remove all traces of paint and primer, 
and to also help prepare the surface

Mix the filler and hard-
ener according to the 
instructions on the can, 
then, working in one direc-
tion, apply the filler to low 
areas using a plastic

hardens in two stages. 
First, it hardens to a consis-
tency approximating that

remains that way for a few 
minutes-exactly how long 
depends on how much 
hardener you've added and 
the ambient temperature 
and humidity. During this

Don't waste your time

the paint can easily pass

that primer buildup is 
minimal. Two-part poly-

use and give the best surface 
buildup. Mix the hardener 
and primer according to the 
directions, then spray on two 
or three coats (Fig. 5). Once 
the primer hardens, machine-
sand the primer with ISO-grit 
sandpaper to remove heavy 
scratches and small waves in 
the body. Then wet-sand the 
repair with 400-grit paper. 
Sand,Sand, Sand 
After all dents and dings are 
repaired, the whole body 
should be sanded. The object 
here is exactly the opposite of 
what you normally try to do to your 
car's finish-you want to remove every 
trace of shine from the body. To do that, 
wet-sand the entire vehicle using 400-
grit waterproof sandpaper. Flood the 
area with plenty of water while you 
sand, and don't forget to sand all the 
areas from where you removed parts. 
Feather-edge nicks and scratches, pay-
ing particular attention to chipped areas 
around door edges and rocker panels. 
Once there's no more shine on the 
body, wash the vehicle with warm 
soapy water, rinse it and let it dry. 
You'll be amazed at how much shine 
there still is. 
Before you hit these areas with the 
sandpaper again, spot prime any 
feather-edged areas as well as any 
areas where you've sanded through to 
the metal. After the primer has hard-
ened, wet-sand these areas and the 
leftover shiny areas with 400-grit 
paper, then repeat the wash and rinse. 
Still have some shiny spots? Guess 
what? Do it again! 
Getting to the Shop 
While the body shop can mask the large 
areas that shouldn't be painted, like the 
windshield and the rear window, it pays

rea lly close look at your new chip. It 
just might be possible to repair the 
chip instead of replacing the entire 
windshield (Fig. 1). T he technique is 
to inject an epoxy or acrylic adhesive 
or fi ller into the chip. 
Even if yo ur chip isn't in your 
direct line of sight, it's a good idea to 
try and repair it. Water will find its 
way into the chip, pulled in by surface 
tension. If the chi p goes all the way 
through the top lamination, any mois-
ture that gets that deep can delami-
nate the glass from the center mem-
brane. Eventuall y, the membrane will 
fog, ca using a larger blemish. Water 
also can freeze in the chi p, causing a 
larger fla w or even a crack. Also,

Let's Go Shopping 
Windshield crack repa ir kits can be

Sears and Wa l-Mart, as well as more 
trad itional auto parts stores li ke Pep 
Boys and AutoZone. Fai ling that, the

stores that cater to professional 
mechanics can supply you. 
In the New York area, we found 
two different types of repair kits and 
there may be others. Expect to pay 
INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR 

around 12 bucks. Procedures differ 
marginall y, but the principle is the 
same. We fi xed a couple of wind-
shields, and the resu lts were excellent. 
How Dry I Am 
Start with an absolutely dry wind-
shield that's somewhere near room 
temperature. Tough on a rain y or 
wintery day, so you may need to park 
your car indoors for a wh ile to equili-
brate. Dry is rea lly essential-you 
don't want to trap any water in the 
repa ir. Use a hair dryer if the window 
is wet. If the surface is dirty, don't use 
any detergents or window cleaner. 
Lighter fluid or acetone ca n help dry 
and clean the surface, but don't use so 
much that it dribbles down the glass 
and peels the paint, or worse. 
Chips Ahoy 
We first used a simp le kit from 
Loctite with a one-part ad hesive and 
an uncomplicated syringe to apply 
it. Start by peeling off the backing 
fi 1m on one side of the precu t 
adhesive strip and applying it to the 
precleaned glass, centered over the 
chip. Burnish with the back of your 
thumbnail or a blunt o bject (Fig. 2) . 
Now peel the remaining fi lm. Orient 
the plastic adapter so that the fittin g is 
as close to vertical as possible and 
stick it [Q the fi lm. Burnish again . 
Pull the cap off the syringe, keeping 
it pointy-end up so the adhesive doesn't 
wind up on the fender. Attach the 
syringe to the adapter. Now here's the 
tricky part-lay your watch down 
somewhere so you can see the second 
hand. Grasp the syringe body with 
one hand to stabilize it, and pu ll the 
handle of the syringe out as far as it 
wi ll go. Because you've taken your 
watch off, you can hold the handle in 
th is position for a full minute. This 
pulls a partial vacuum in the syringe-
and in the crack. While you're holding 
this vacuum, the air in the crack bub-
bles up through the adhesive in the 
syringe, while adhesive creeps down 
toward the glass and chip. 
Now let go of the handle. Don 't 
fo ll ow the handle, let it go a bruptly. 
The press ure wave from the handle 
slam ming down wi ll force adh esive 
into the crack. Repeat this suck-and-
HOW IT WORKS 
slam operation a half-dozen times or 
so, forcing the crack virtua ll y full of 
ad hesive (Fig. 3). 
Now remove the syringe, adapter 
and ad hesive sheet. There will be a 
film of adhesive on the surface of the 
glass. You can chase that back with 
an alcohol-dampened paper towel, 
but leave the pimple of adhesive right 
above the crack undisturbed until it 
cures for a few hours. 
With the pimple hardened, simply 
take a single-edge razor blade and 
shave the protruding adhesive off. Use 
a sharp blade, and you' ll be able to do 
this in a single pass. 
The Other Path 
We tried a different crack repa ir kit as 
well. This differed in that it used a 
two-part ad hesive. Th is required us to 
mix two sma ll vials of adhesive and 
hardener in the syringe before start-
ing, which was simple. The adhesive 
disc and syringe adapter were similar 
(if not identica l) to the simpler kit's, 
and were applied in an identica l fash-
ion. The syringe, however, was more 
complex. It used a wi re latch arrange-
Laminated Safety Glass 
Ordinary window glass, like you have 
around the house, is pretty amazing 
stuff. It's clear, strong and cheap. But 
it's also brittle, shattering into long, 
dangerous, wickedly sharp shards 
when overstressed. Plastics would be 
as strong, but not nearly hard enough 
to resist scratching and remain clear 
enough for a car window-just look at 
any plastic-glazed outdoor bus stop 
or phone booth, with its patina of fine 
scratches. For the side windows of 
cars, automakers have come up with 
a good compromise: tempered glass. It's stronger than 
standard, but more importantly, when it does shatter it 
breaks up into small granules. These granules are still 
sharp, but should do less damage than the long shards 
of untempered glass. However, for a windshield, con-
stantly bombarded by pebbles, tempered glass would 
have a short life span. 
REPAIRING WINDSHIELDS 
So, many years back, the car manu-
facturers switched to a laminated 
glass sandwich for the windshield. It's 
a simple process. Two thinner sheets 
of glass are fused to a rubber inner 
layer. The tempered-glass outer layers 
are then independent of each other. 
The rubbery center sheet provides 
damping to any shock waves from 
errant stones, reducing the probability 
of breakage. And if the glass is hit by 
an object smartly enough, odds are 
that only the outer sheet will break, as 
is the case with most stone chips. If a really big piece of 
debris hits the glass hard enough to break both inner 
and outer layers, the tough membrane prevents it from 
winding up in your lap. Even better, the shards of glass 
from the inner lamination wind up stuck to the mem-
brane, keeping them from spalling away from the wind-
shield at a high velocity, causing great havoc. 
283 

ment on the body that dropped into 
two notches on the handle when nec-
essary. A simple pushpin stuck into 
the body was used as a very crude 
va lve to let air in and out of the body. 
Once the syringe is attached to the 
ada pter (the adapter already being 
stuck airtight to the glass), the push-
pin is removed. Now bottom the 
syringe plunger, pushing the air out. 
Insert the pin, and pull the handle out 
until the clip clicks into the slot. This 
will hold the plunger out, and the par-
tia I vacuum under it for the desig-
nated time. 
Now, rather th an rapidly releas-
ing the pressure li ke we did with the 
earlier kit, remove the pin, admitting 
air into the syringe barrel. Now 
replace the pin, seali ng the hole. 
284 
Release th e clip, and push the ha ndle 
in, lightly pressurizing the barrel and 
forcing ad hesive into the chip for a 
minute or so. The second slot will 
trap th e clip as soon as yo u've 
pushed in far enough. Repeat this 
"vent, suck , vent, sq ueeze" opera-
tion severa l times to force adhesive 
into th e crack. 
While the ingenious clip-and-slot 
and vent business relieves you of the 
necessity of constantl y grasping the 
syringe barrel li ke it's the last beer at 
the picnic, there are caveats. T he vac-
uum pulled isn't as good, purging less 
air on every iteration. And the simpler 
kit seemed to force the adhesive 
deeper into the crack faster by Llsing 
the plunger as a piston to rapidly 
pressurize the system. 
ADHESIVE 
AIR BUBBLES 
(Fig. 3) Alternating cycles of vacuum 
and pressure will push adhesive into 
the chip, and evacuate air from the 
bottom of the chip. 
Having said that, both kits did a 
bang-up job. After shaving the excess 
adhesive off, both cracks are barely 
visible. T he adhesive is clear, and has 
the same refracti ve index as the glass 
so that it renders the crack invisible 
from almost any angle. 
O ne warning: Don't get cute and 
try to depress the plunger by hand 
and sq ueeze the ad hesive deeper into 
the glass with either kit. The adhesive 
patch might become unglued and 
sq uirt adhesive all over your wind-
shield and fender and shirt. Don't ask 
how we know this. tI

A
s you fini sh your 
morning coffee, you 
wait for the weather 
forecast. And it's what 
you've been dreading: rain. 
For most people, rain dur-
ing rush hour means little 
more than annoyance and 
perhaps increased driving 
stress and travel time. But 
for you, driving in the rain 
means a misera bly wet ride, 
a ruined suit and possibly 
ruined shoes as well, unless 
you take precautions and 
change into your wet-
weather driving clothes. 
You, like many other fo lks 
on the road, have a car that 
suffers from a water leak. 
(Fig. 1) A gasket loose enough to let a dollar slide easily 
might leak air at speed. Tug firmly, but don't tear the bill. 
Replace torn or missing 
weatherstrips, but do not 
use a generic weatherstrip 
intended for storm doors to 
replace the carefully engi-
neered ru bber seal-unless 
you're desperate. The deal-
ership should be able to 
order the correct part for 
you, or you may be able to 
find what you need on a 
similar car in a junkyard. 
It's also possible to repair 
torn sections of weather-
strip with silicone seal or 
strong, quick-drying glue. 
But first c1ea n the pieces 
with alcohol or lacquer 
thinner. Don't be afraid to 
piece short lengths together. 
You're all too fam iliar 
with that cold rainwater 
steadily dripping from 
under the dash and flowing 
down your left leg. Your 
discomfort is exacerbated 
by the piercing whistle orig-
inating at the source of the 
leak. 
You contemplate simply 
phoning in sick, but then 
you gird your resolve. 
Before heading out to the 
garage, you decide that 
you're going to find the 
source of those leaks and 
squelch them once and for 
all-even if you have to 
tear the entire car apart. 
(Fig. 2) Wind can slide under trim pieces and whistle. Use 
tape to find the culprit, then seal the leak with trim adhesive 
or silicone seal. 
In addition, many firms 
make replacement gaskets 
for older cars at very rea-
sonable prices-although 
you may need to buy an 
entire kit.].C. W hitney 
and other companies also 
sell weatherstrip by the 
yard in an array of differ-
ent profiles. 
Wind Noise 
As you drive, air surrounding the car 
creates large pressure differentials 
between the inside and outside of the 
body. The greatest differential occurs 
along the sides of the car between the 
roof and belt line where outside pres-
sure is much lower than the pressure 
in the passenger compartment. 
Weatherstripping and window 
seals are supposed to keep passenger-
compartment air in and outside air 
out. When they are damaged, how-
ever, whistles, hissing and other 
annoying noises occur. 
Therefore, the place to start look-
ing for air leaks is the weatherstrip-
FINDING AND FIXING WATER AND AIR LEAKS 
Distorted sections often can be 
repaired simply by heating them wi th 
a heat gun or a hair dryer and then 
reforming them by hand. 
A quick way to check for air leaks 
is to rub chalk on the surface of the 
weatherstrip. When you shut the 
door, chalk dust will transfer from the

strip to the door on areas that seal 
properly. You can also check for leaks 
in small areas by placing a dollar bill 
between the weatherstrip and the 
door (Fig. 1). After closing the door, 
pull the dollar bill. If it moves too eas-
il y, you've found a ga p. 
Air leaks can also be caused by a 
misadjusted door or worn door 
hinges that allow the door to sag. To 
check door alignment, make sure 
there are even gaps between the 
closed door and the body. The outer 
surface of the door should also be 
flush with the surrounding sheet-
metal. To check for worn hinges, 
open the door and lift it up and down 
to see if the hinges allow movement. 
If they do, they'll have to be replaced. 
Pressure Me 
You can simulate inside/outside 
press ure differentials in a parked 
vehicle using the heater or air-condi-
tioning blower to pressurize the 
passenger compartment w hile yo u 
look for leaks. 
To do this, begin by blocking all 
interior exhaust vents (they're usually 
found on the C pillars) with duct 
tape. Also make sure that any dash-
mounted fresh-air vents are closed. 
Next, start the engine so the vacuum-
operated vent controls will operate, 
then set the HVAC controls to draw 
in outside air on the highest blower

You may need to remove some trim to find the spot. 
setting. Shut off the engine and turn 
the key to the accessory position so 
the blower still operates, and then 
close the doors. 
In a short while, pressure will build 
in the passenger compartment. Check 
for air leaks by moving your hand 
slowl y around window glass and 
wea therstripping to feel for air leaks. 
Mark suspect areas with tape so you 
can correct them later. 
Instead of feeling for leaks, you 
can listen for them by using a stetho-
scope or by placing one end of a piece 
of small-diameter tubing at the seal 
and listening at the other end. 
Repair small gaps between the 
body and the weatherstripping by 
shimming it with vinyl foam tape. On 
doors with frames, leaks can also 
occur around window seals. If the 
seals are not torn or missing, you can 
. often adjust the window track behind 
the door panel so the window rides 
more tightly aga inst the seal. 
Wind noise can also be ca used by 
loose driprail covers, molding, the 
grille and external accessories. If you 
suspect a noise is coming from one of 
these areas, cover it or modify its 
shape with tape to see if the noise 
disappears (Fig. 2). If it does, you 've 
fo und the problem. 
Water Leaks 
You ma y not rea lize it, but when it 
rains, water may flow all over the 
inside of a car body. Depending on 
the car's design, water can run down 
the insides of C pillars, the insides of 
doors and through the cowl. Fortu-
nately, cars also have systems that 
channel the water to places that serve 
as drains. If the drain holes are 
plugged, water backs up and, before 
you know it, water is inside the car. 
To keep this from happening, make 
sure cowling shields and trunk and 
hood weatherstripping are in place 
and in good shape. You should also 
periodically inspect door- and rocker-
panel drainage holes to make sure 
they are clea r of debris that would 
prevent them from draining freely. 
In addition to leaking through 
weatherstripping and window seals, 
water can drip through body welds, 
seams, pinholes, plugs and other 
INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR 

areas where gaps or holes exist. 
Un like air, water is affected by 
gravity, so no matter where th e lea k 
originates, the water will eventuall y 
wind up in a lower part of the vehicle 
(Fig. 3). Water can also travel far 
from its original entry point. For 
example, it's not unusual for water to 
enter nea r the roofline and travel 
down the inside of the passenger com-
partment between the trim and body. 
Whether it becomes visible before it 
gets to the floor depends on its course. 
How do you tell if a water lea k 
starts at a floor-pan seam or the 
moon roof? Start with common 
sense: If the floor pan gets wet onl y 
w hen yo u drive through deep pud-
dl es, assume the water is coming 
from a rust hole, a missing body 
plug, body-seam leak or other open-
ing down low. The floor pan, fender 
wells and the lower portion of the 
engine bulkhead are 
prime lea k areas. If the 
floor is wet when it 
rains, but yo u ha ven't 
dri ven the car, assume 
that the water is enter-
ing at a higher point, 
such as a moon roof, 
roof pillar or the win-
dow sea ling areas. A 
drip from under the 
dash might be traced 
to the cowling below 
the windshield.

Repairs 
You'll want to replace or repair all 
defecti ve seals, weatherstrips and 
guards (Fig. 5). There are many types 
of material for filling and sealing 
body lea ks. Consult the box to the left 
to determin e the best material for 
repairing a leak. 
If yo u want to have a lea k repaired 
by a professional, take your car to a 
technicia n who is certified by the 
inter-industry conference on collision 
auto repair (I-CAR). I-CAR techni-
cians ha ve been trained in the proper 
methods of sealing bodies. 6 
(Fig. 5) Sometimes fixing 
a leak is as simple as reinstalling a 
misplaced rubber gasket. An auto parts 
store will have the proper trim adhe-
sive. Clean all the old adhesive off the 
doorframe and gasket first.

OU pu ll into your driveway, take 
a loving look at the new con-
vertible and realize: Buying it 
was the fu lfillment of a dream. It's 
been great fu n driving it this summer 
and fall, but winter is approaching 
and there's no way you're going to 
drive it on snow and subject it to cor-
rosive road salt-so you face the prob-
lem of storing it until late next spring. 
A 2- to 4-month driving season fo l-
lowed by eight to 10 months of stor-
age is somethi ng many car enthusiasts

INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR 

go through every year. Maybe you're 
a snowbird with a pair of vehicles 
that go into 6-month storage at both 
your wa rm- and cold-weather loca-
ti ons during the away season. 
Even more traumatic: You've got a 
work assignment or a military posting 
far from home and can't bring the car. 
Whatever the vehicle, the reason and 
the season, you wa nt to be able to 
store the vehicle without big expense, 
yet with minimum deteriorati on and 
an easy return to operation. 
The Basics 
Indoors is always better, particularl y 
for an older vehicle, even if the stor-
age period is summer in the South. If 
you're going to be away for up to a 
couple of years, it definitely has to be 
kept inside. If you don't ha ve the 
place, find an indoor storage facil-
ity-it wi ll be money well spent. In 
fact, you also should get someone to 
take out the car periodica ll y for an 
"exercising" dri ve. If you can't afford 
to do long-term storage right, you 
might have to pay a lot for restoration 
when you return. 
If outdoor "storage" is your only 
choice, don 't give up. There's still a 
lot you can do to minimize the dam-
age, particularly for seasonal storage. 
Prepping the Vehicle 
The cleaner the vehicle the better, and 
that goes beyond wash, wax and 
shine. Pick a warm, dry day to do the 
cleaning. Fill the gas tank, then add 
an adeq uate amount of gasoline stabi-
lizer (also made for lawn mowers, 
snowblowers, etc.) to prevent gum 
and varn ish forma ti on. Drive the car 
long enough to rea lly warm up the 
engine and mix the stabilizer wi th the 
fuel-at least 30 to 40 miles. Remove 
dirt from the underbody, particularly 
from the wheel wells. Dirt holds mois-
ture, and the com bination of moisture 
and air ca uses iron and steel to rust. 
Rea ll y, rea lly clean the interior and 
trunk of the vehicle with a household 
vacuum cleaner, using those little 
attachments that reach into nooks and 
crannies (Fig. 1). The battery-powered 
car vacuum just doesn't have the suc-
STORING YOUR CAR 
tion. The object is to remove all pizza 
crusts, jellybea ns, dog biscuits- any-
thi ng that could nourish a critter. 
Indoor Storage 
Allow the car to air-dry. If the garage 
or shed has a concrete or earth floor, 
create a floor vapor barrier wi th plas-
tic sheeting or tarps. With an earth 
floor, make a drive-along "path" fro m 
strips cut from a sheet of plywood 
and place them over the vapor barrier. 
Remove the spark plugs and spray 
some oil into the cylinders to prevent 
rust and corrosion. You can use con-
ventional engine oil with a spray-type 
squirt can or aerosol fogging oil 
designed for boat storage (Fig. 2). Turn 
the crankshaft (with a socket and 
ratchet wrench on the crank pulley 
bolt) about four to six times to circu-
late the oi l. Reinstall the 
ings and set up residence. Stuff thick, 
clean rags into the tailpipe, engine air 
intake and the fresh air intake in front 
of the windshield, un less it's covered 
by mesh (or a ca bin air fi lter). If you 
know you have mice in the area that 
may enjoy making nesting material 
out of your cloth rags, use aluminum 
foil instead (Fig. 5). If the vehicle is to 
be left for six months or longer, the 
iss ue of flat-spotting the tires is worth 
considering. Prevention is straightfo r-
ward if you have a set of four jack-
stands. Jack up each end of the vehi-
cle so that it's high enough to slip a 
jacksta nd, in the lowest position, 
under each lower arm. Jackstands will 
eventually sink into dirt floors-use 
pl ywood squares under them. 
Stuff clean rags between the wiper 
arms and windshield to hold the 
spark plugs and recon-
nect the plug wires.

ta in a battery charge for long periods. 
Removing the battery also gives you 
the chance to inspect the battery box 
for any corrosion, and to clean it out. 
Lubricate the hood release latch, 
hood and door hinges to protect them 
from moisture (Fig. 4). 
Brake fluid absorbs moisture, 
which can ca use rust and corrosion in 
the brake system. Flush the old fluid 
with new. Check the freeze point of 
the engine coolant with a hydrometer 
to make sure it's low enough for the 
ambient temperatures. 
Protecti on from rodents and other 
critters is important. T hey not onl y

wires, but they can crawl into open-

blades off the glass (or remove the 
blades) . This will keep them from 
sticking to the glass, which could 
both leave marks and ruin the rubber 
(Fig. 6). Apply a film of rubber lubri-
cant to the squeegees. 
Empty a large container of moth-
ba lls on the floor all around and under 
the vehicle to discourage critters. 
Outdoor Storage 
If you must store outside on an earth 
surface, the best you can do is park 
the car on a layer of plywood over a 
continuous layer of heavy-duty plas-
tic. The combination won't keep all 
windblown moisture from snow and 
rain off the underbody. However, to 
289 

do any better in a windy area you'd 
have to make the plastic layer over-
size. As a fin al step before placing any 
cover, lift the ends up and tuck them 
into the body (trap them in bottom 
door openings, tape and tie to 
unpainted trim, etc.) to create a sort 
of underbody diaper. This is not easy 
because you don't wa nt plastic sheet-
ing against painted metal body parts, 
where it could trap moisture and 
cause rust and paint damage. 
O utdoor storage prep, like indoor, 
starts with a clean, dry vehicle. Put 
mothballs in the passenger cabin, lay-
ing them on sheets of aluminum foil. 
Leave each window open a half-inch, 
so the interior can breathe, but cut 
some strips of fi ne screening to cover 
the openings and tape the strips to 
glass and molding with masking tape. 
Be careful not to tape to the car body 
paint surfaces. 
Perform a ll the other indoor prep, 
including insect- and rodent-proof-
ing and rust and corrosion preven-
tion. Also remove the battery and 
store it indoors, connected to a 
trickle cha rger. 
We've sa ved the toughest topic for 
last: body covering. The plain fact is 
that you have to cover the body, and 
there's no perfect way to do so. That's 
why we say that indoors is No.1, and 
outdoors is No. 2- beca use it's all 
that's left. 
There are more choices in body 
covers than we can count, ra nging 
from $20 to more than $300. At the 
lowest price, you're likely to get just a 
plastic cover that's made in a few sizes

to fit all vehicles in a specific category 
(car, SUY, truck). It may not fit well 
and it can trap moisture underneath, 
damaging the vehicle finish. It's 
intended as a dust and rain cover for 
a day or two- at best. 
Fit is very im portant, even if the

cover is a " breather" (just porous 
enough to allow air to pass through, 
but able to restrict moisture). Wind 
can whi p the inner surface of a loose-
fitting cover against the paint and 
when you peel off the cover, the body 
may look as if the paint had been 
sanded. As the prices go up, so does 
the quality of the fit of the covers-
and the materials will be more body-
friendl y. 
For sunn y areas, pick a cover 
material that keeps out ultraviolet 
rays to protect the car's finish . But 
also prep the interior surfaces with 
suitable protectants such as leather 
conditioner and plastic treatment. 
If you're in a wet 'n' windy area, 
you can get extra protection by fi rst 
covering the body paint with soft 
blankets, tied down with bungee 
cords. T he blankets not only will 
wick up moisture that gets through, 
bur also provide a protective layer 
under the vehicle cover. 
A premium, breathable custom-fit 
cover that extends down to cover the 
wheel wells, and is secured with 
straps, is your best bet for outside. 
Getting Ready to Drive 
It's driving season, you've opened the 
garage door and you're eyeing the car. 
In addition to unpacking, refitting the 
battery and so forth, sand most of the 
rust off the brake rotors with some 
100-grit sandpaper on a rubber block, 
and change the engine oil and filter. 
You should be ready to roll. 
Exercising the Car 
Back after an away-from-home work 
assignment? If you did not opt for the 
"exercise program," you'll need to take 
your beloved for a serious drive. Just 
starting the engine and letting it reach 
operating temperature is not what we 
mean. That actually can be harmful, 
allowing oil dilution by fuel and mois-
ture. A 30-mile drive every 60 days, 
with brakes, transmission, steering and 
air conditioning all operating, is what 
the car rea lly needs. If you don't stint 
on this, the car will feel every bit as 
good as you remember. 9 
INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR 

EASY 
Drying Out Your Flooded Car 
W
e've all seen it on TV: rain-
storms of biblical propor-
tions sweeping entire villages 
into the sea, and damp, devastated 
flood victims being interviewed in 
front of a pile of sodden furnishings 
and clothing. Bur then it happens 
closer to home-only this time it's 
your car, not the entire village. There's 
a high-water line halfway up the wind-
shield, and several inches of mud in the 
interior and the trunk. It smells like a 
swamp, and it's only getting worse in 
the hot sun. And the insurance adjuster 
says he'll be by in a few days. 
How Dry I Am 
Don't wait for the adjuster to arrive. 
M old and corrosion are setting in 
now. You need to clean out as much 
liquid and mud as you can and dry out 
your car as soon as possible. Don't try 
to start the car. If there's water in the 
engine, transmission or fuel system, 
you'll just compound the damage. 
D isconnect the battery ground 
strap first-you must do this, other-
wise you'll fry something. 
Next, begin assessing just how 
deep the water got. Frankly, if the 
waterline is as high as the dashboard, 
you will probably be better off talking 
the adjuster into totaling the car and 
getting another. Double that for salt 
water. The mechanical systems and 
the interi or can be dried o ut or 
cleaned with a lot of labor, but the 
electrica I systems on modern ca rs are 
extremely complex. These systems 
rely on a lot of low-voltage signals 
from sensors in the engine manage-
ment system and ABS. These low-
voltage signals are extremely sensitive 
to corrosion on connectors, and prob-
lems can crop up for years. 
Look for a high-water mark. That 
can be easy-if the water was muddy 
or there was a lot of floating grass 
and leaves. But clean water may leave

doors and the taillights, and da mp-
ness in the carpets and interior trim. 
This will a llow you to eliminate clean-
ing some areas or systems on the car 
unnecessarily. Let's go through those 
systems. 
Drivetrain 
Check the dipsticks for the engine and 
transmission. If there are water 
droplets clinging to the end of either 
dipstick, you absolutely, positively 
need to change the oil and filter 
before even thinking about starting 
the engi ne (Fig. 1). If the water was 
muddy, it's probably wisest to remove 
the oil pan from the engine and wash 
the mud out. Change the oi l and filter 
aga in in a few hund red miles, too. 
Late-model cars have sealed fue l 
systems, and probably won't get any 
water in them. But that classic '55 
T-Bird probably ingested some water 
if it was deep enough and lingered 
long enough. Siphon the fuel out into 
a conta iner and look for water. If you 
find any, it's probably best to drop the 
tank and get it cleaned professionally. 
Blow out the fuel line, and you may 
need to get water out of the carbure-
tor float bowls as well. If you find evi-
dence of water in a fue l-injected car 
or truck's tank, replace the fue l fi lter 
as well. That paper element may dete-
riorate if it gets waterlogged. It's not 
that a few drops of clean water are 
bad, but floodwater is usuall y pretty 
fou l with silt and sludge. 
Muddy water can infiltrate its way 
past engine seals within a few hours 
(Fig. 2). Crankshaft seals, transmis-
sion seals and axle and CY joint seals 
are adequate to keep lubricants in, but 
they are not designed to keep standing 
(Fig. 2) Engine seals are better at 
keeping oil inside than in keeping water 
and mud outside.

water from creeping in. Before you 
start the engine, or tow a car with the 
wheels on the ground, dra in and 
change the oil, transmission fluid and 
final-drive lube. Check the dipstick for 
water droplets. And then change those 
fluids again in a thousand miles or so 
if there was evidence of muddy water. 
And don't forget wheel bearings and 
constant velocity joints, which will 
need to be cleaned and repacked. 
Some front-drive cars have sealed-for-
life front axle bearings, and you'll sim-
ply have to wait for those to fail, 
because it's nearly impossible to clean 
and relube them. 
292 
Down Under and In 
If the water came up onl y to the door-
sills, you may be in luck. Aside from 
mud or salt water on the brakes, 
there's little to damage on the under-
side of the car. Use fresh wa ter to hose 
everything down. If the ca lipers or 
bra ke drum cylinders were submerged 
for more than an hour or two, flush 
and bleed the brake fluid, in case 
water seeped backward past the sea ls. 
If the exhaust system was sub-
merged and is full of water, just start 
the engine after you've determined 
there's no wa ter in the oil. 
Water get high enough to get the 
interior wet? If the water was clear, 
fresh rainwater, just vacuum the car-
pets and let everything air-dry with 
the windows open in the sun. Odds 
are that the water was muddy, and 
that the seats are wet, too. You may 
not be able to rescue the sponge rub-
ber seat cushions, but it's worth try-
ing. If the seat cushions are wet, rinse 
with fres h wa ter, and wet-vacuum as 
much wa ter out as possible. Leave 
them in the sun to dry. If mildew or 
mold starts to get a foothold before 
things dry, use a commercial disinfec-
tant spray to knock it down. Remove 
as much of the interior as you can, 
rinse it in fresh water and hang it up 
to dry. That includes the door panels, 
and stuff like the interior panels and 
fi berboard glovebox. 
Rinse the inside of the car with 
clean water and dry it out. This 
includes the inside of the doors and 
fenders. Don't forget the trunk. 
There's one critical piece of gear 
you need to deal with immediately if 
the interior was flooded: the computer. 
The engine management computer is 
often mounted behind the passenger 
kick panel or under the seat, and it's 
not weatherproofed at all (Fig. 3). Pull 
the kick panel, remove the computer

although it may be more diffi-
cult to find and remove than 
the engine computer. Check a 
repair manual to find it, if 
necessary. Rinse and lubricate

there's evidence of moisture, rinse in 
clean water. Then rinse aga in in dem-

0 F. 
Clean the electrical contacts on the 
wiring harness, and lubricate with 
electrical contact grease. Don't rein-
stall it until everything is dry. 
It's not uncommon to see a high-
water mark inside the light housings 
(Fig. 4), especially if the flood lasted for 
more than an hour or two. Dampness 
or water/mud inside the head- and tail-
light fixtures needs to be dried. Remove 
the wet assembly, pull the bulb and 
rinse the light housing thoroughly so 
the chrome-plated reflector doesn't 
discolor. Dry in the sun . Remember, if 
you have quartz-halogen bulbs in your 
head lights, clean the quartz glass with 
alcohol and don't touch the bulb while 
reinstalling it or it'll burn out within a 
few hours. 
Brake fluid is soluble in water, so 
you won't find any wet evidence of 
contamination. Water can backtrack 
past ca liper and wheel cylinder seals, 
so prompt flushing is ca lled for. Suck 
most of the old fluid/water out of the 
master cylinder reservoir, and refill 
with fresh fluid (Fig. 5). Flush one cor-
ner of the brake system until you see 
fresh fluid at the bleeder by pushi ng

cracks the bleeder, and then hold the 
HOW IT WORKS 
Salvage Titles 
As incredible as it may seem, it's possible for a dealer or an individual to 
acquire, legally, a title for a car that's been flood-damaged and totaled that 
doesn't reflect the damage. In most states, totaled cars' titles bear a sal-
vage tag on the title. But a dealer can wholesale the car out to a state that 
issues the fresh title without tagging the car as salvage. Which states? It 
doesn't matter because once the title has been laundered, it can be reti-
tled in any state, clean as a whistle. And I'd rather not say, so nobody gets 
any ideas about laundering the title to a damaged car. 
So caveat emptor (let the buyer beware). Always examine any potential 
used car or truck purchases with a jaundiced eye. Look carefully for evi-
dence that the vehicle has been wet: i.e., mud in unusual places in the 
trunk, water marks inside the instruments, an owner's manual that looks 
like it's been wet, warped fiberboard door panels or glove box interiors. 
DRYING OUT YOUR FLOODED CAR 
sors, so you can expect problems 
down the line, especially if your car 
was immersed in salt water. 
Electrical 
As mentioned earlier, modern cars 
have lots of critica l, low-voltage, low-
current circuits-the kind that are 
most sensitive to resistance caused by 
corrosion in the connectors. Fortu-
nately, these connections are pretty 
well weatherproofed. But it will still 
pay to dry them out. Systematicall y 
disconnect every electrical connector 
you can find. Do this one at time so 
you don't wind up reconnecting them 
to the wrong place, of course. If you 
find water or contamination, clean 
with demineralized water to remove 
sa lt or mud, and air-dry. Some con-
nections should be lubed with silicone 
spray or dielectric grease, while oth-
ers, usuall y ones with sealed connec-
tors, should be air dried and reassem-
bled dry and clean. Be sure this type is 
rea ll y dry, as any leftover moisture 
will be trapped inside the connector 
forever. 
On the Road Again 
Finally, after everything has been 
dried out and lubed, put it all back 
together and give 'er the smoke test-
hook up the battery and fire it up. 
Won't crank? Guess what-the raging 
floodwaters may have diluted your 
battery electrolyte. The only fix is a 
new battery. tI

Repairing Paint Chips 
A
s always, you've parked your 
new, expensive, shin y car at 
the far end of the parking lot, 
several rows away from the nearest 
vehicle of any sort. You've even been 
careful to park at the top of the lot's 
drainage pitch so any errant shop-
ping carts will roll away from, not 
toward, your car. 
But nobody said li fe was fair. 
Returning to your car 3 minutes later 
with a $50 bag of chocolate 
apoleons, sushi and okra for your 
pregnant wife, you find that the 
unthinkable has happened-there's a 
294 
rusted, sagging minivan parked only 
inches from your car. And, yes, the 
careless driver has managed 
to chip the paint on your wheel 
well arch in two places. 
Getting It Fixed 
The body shop wants $250 to begin 
repa iring it. And the shop foreman 
says something about c1earcoat and 
not guara nteeing an exact match for 
your pearlescent mica paint. 
Unfortunately, that's about the 
size of it. It's frustrat~ngly difficult to 
match many of today's high-tech fin-

the nick is small, but large enough to 
go th rough the c1earcoat and into the 
pigmented paint, your best bet may 
be a simple touchup, which you can 
do in the driveway. It won't be per-
fect, but it may be far less noticea ble. 
Paint by Number 
This method is best for small

edges-for example, near trunk and 
door openings. Work indoors in a 
heated garage during the cooler 
months, or outdoors out of the wind 
and sun . If you live in Truth or Con-
sequences, N.M., or Las Vegas, you 
may want to work ea rly in the da y, 
before the heat builds up, to keep the 
paint fluid enough to flow properly. 
Go to the car dea lership or auto 
parts store and acquire touchup paint 
in the appropriate color, c1earcoat 
and, if yo u've got bare meta l show-
ing, primer. Do not use primer 
intended for lawn furniture or naval 
vessels-it should be automotive 
primer, preferably of the same brand 
as the touchup paint. 
Start by using masking tape to 
isolate the area around the chip, to 
prevent you from damaging other 
parts of the finish. Allow about !I; in. 
around the damaged spot. Next, 
clean road grime and wax away from 
the inside of the chipped area with a 
cloth moistened with lacq uer thinner. 
(If your car is painted with a lacquer-
based paint-which is possible if it 
REPAIRING PAINT CHIPS 
dates to the '70s or earlier, or has 
been repainted-the paint will dis-
solve in lacq uer thinner. Use dena-
tured alcohol instead.) If the paint is 
chi pped down to the metal, use a 
sharp knife point or some 40-grit 
sandpaper to ro ugh up the surface, 
particularly if there's any rust. With 
the applicator brush in the bottle or 
with a toothpick, prime any bare 
meta l. Flow primer in a thin coat, but 
be careful nOt to lap any primer onto 
the paint surrounding the chip. Your 
job at this point is to lay a smooth 
layer of primer down without any 
lumps or bumps-
just enough to 
cover the bare metal. Let this dry for 
a t least 24 ho urs. 
Now comes the tricky part. Using 
the brush or toothpick, fill the chip 
with paint in a nice, even layer (Fig. 1). 
Don't try to fill it up, just be sure you 
get to all the corners. Don't let it sag 
or bulge. If you get a little overlap, 
use a cotton swa b lightly moistened 
with lacquer thinner to mop up any 
excess paint. If the paint is too thin, 
leave the appl icator brush out in the 
open for a minute o r two and the 
paint will thicken. If it's too gooey, a 
few drops of lacquer thinner wi ll fix 
that. Thin sparingly, if you must. 
Allow the layer of paint to dry for

24 hours. It will shrink substantially 
as it dries, and you don't want too 
much pa int. If it gets lumpy, yo u can 
try sa nding it with 600-grit or 800-
grit waterproof sandpaper and water 
(Fig. 2). Don 't sand the paint sur-
rounding the chip-you want that to 
remain undisturbed .

EASY 
Polishing Your Car 
I
nmost parts of the 
country, the winter 
brings with it some 
road sa lt or sand and all 
types of precipitation. All 
of the above are less than 
good for your car's or 
truck's finish. So spring 
cleaning not only makes 
your veh icle look sharper, 
but it also helps restore and 
preserve the quality of its 
finish. Your car wi ll be 
worth more at trade-in or 
resale time if it looks good. 
You can help ensure that 
it looks good by regularly 
shining it up after you've 
washed it. Before you 
shine, though, be sure to 
match the type of polish or 
wax you use with your car's 
or truck's paint finish. 
Polishing your clean car 
entails more than simply 
laying down a thin layer of 
wax or polish over the 
paint. The process also involves 
removing the very fi ne layer of du ll, 
oxidized and weathered finis h on the 
surface. This dull layer ca n either be 
removed chemica lly or with a fine 
polishing abrasive. W ith the oxidized 
layer removed, the fresh finish 
beneath it will shine. T he wax or sili-
cone in the polish then adds luster 
and protection to that clean paint. 
If your car or truck has a 
clearcoat/basecoat fini sh, you must use 
a wax or polish that's specially 
designed for it. The wrong prod uct 
may actua ll y dull rather than shine the 
fin ish. If you use a nonabrasive product 
made for a clearcoat fin ish on an 
acrylic nonclearcoat finish, the results 
will be disappointing at best. Be sure to 
use a product designed for a non-
clearcoat paint. 
If you opt to shine your car with a 
POLISHING YOUR CAR 
wax, use a quality one that lists car-
nuba wax among its active ingredi-
ents. Or use a synthetic that contains 
si licone resins or amino-acti ve si li-
cones. (Most products have silicone 
fluids or oils that will make them eas-
ier to apply.) 
Regard less of the type of fi nish 
your vehicle has and the finish-care 
product you use, the actual task of 
shining up the ca r is pretty much the 
same. Work in the shade, but not 
beneath the birds' fa vorite sap-bearing 
tree. Begin polishing early enough to 
avoid having to work in the heat of 
day, and finish the job ea rly enough to 
let the wax cure before the dew begins 
to settle. 
roof. Use a soft, damp 
applicator to put down a 
layer of wax. Sma ll house-
hold sponges make excel-
lent, disposable wax appli-
cators. Don't be alarmed if 
your applicator removes 
some paint along with the 
polish on a nonclearcoat 
fini sh. T his is the dull, oxi-
dized layer coming up. 
Avoid getting wax or pol-
ish on any matte black 
plastic parts, r ubber trim 
or molding, or on a vin yl 
roof. Allow the wax to dry 
to a haze accord ing to the 
prod uct's instructions. 
To get a show-car shine, 
buff off the wax or polish 
in a linear rather than a cir-
cular motion. This takes 
more time but it leaves the 
car's finish with a uniform-
looking luster. 
If you're using a tota ll y 
nonabrasive wax or polish 
and don 't mind swirl marks, you can 
finish the job using a power buffer. 
Make sure that the power buffer's 
lamb's-wool bonnet is clean. Change 
or rinse the bonnet frequently to 
avoid scratching the finis h. Use the 
bonnet as a mitten to buff in the 
crevices and other areas that the 
power buffer ca n't reach. 
To help maintain the shine on your 
ca r after you've restOred it, try to 
keep your parked car covered-in the 
garage or carport or beneath a cover. 
Also, periodica ll y hose grit and dust 
off the fi nish, but avoid the tempta-

Repairing Plastic Bumpers 
A
f.ter you drove inro the mall 
parking lot and saw how 
packed it was, you couldn't 
believe your luck when you spotted a 
space right next ro the building. So 
you hurried into the space without 
noticing the extra-high concrete 
curb- until you heard your flexible 
plastic bumper strike it. To make mat-
ters worse, backing up in a panic put 
a nice tear in the bumper. 
Oh well, there's no use crying 
over spilled milk. Thankfully, you 
don't have ro cry over a split bumper, 
either. The 3M Co. makes a repair 
system designed to fi x cuts, tears and 
abrasions in flexible bumpers. Once 
repaired, the bumper can then be 
painted its original color with an 
automotive paint that has a flexib le 
agent so it won't crack when the 
bumper flexes. 
Velvet Glove 
All right, technica lly it's not really 
the bumper-it's the bumper's cos-
metic cover. The true bumperlimpact 
absorbing system is probably a metal 
beam that is intended ro do the rea l 
work . And if it's damaged, you'll 
need ro replace the components with 
new ones ro provide your vehicle 
with the correct crash protection. 
And don't skimp there. However, the 
p lastic skin isn't structural, despite 
the fact that it's the most expensive 
part of both the front and rear 
bumpers. Odds are that most low-
speed mishaps affect only the cover, 
and tbose can be repaired if you fo l-
low our directions. 
The 3M P.R.O. flexible-parts repair 
system consists of a 2-part flexible 
filler that is mixed rogether (like 
epoxy), a flexible putty and a flexible 
coating that covers and seals the 
repair before painting. There's also an 
adhesion promoter that must be used 
on plastic parts made with polyolefins.

80- and 120-grit sandpaper, a couple

method of spraying the coating. While 
a compressed-air spray gun is ideal, 
we've illustrated a small aerosol 
sprayer you can fill with liquid your-
self. Pre-Val is one popular brand. 
Stocking up 
If you've done bodywork in the past, 
yo u'll be in good shape ro repair 
these plastic parts. Most of the rools 
and the style of work is the same, but 
don't try to use the same materials ro 
repair these flexible parts. The plas-
tic is quite different in its ad hesion 
characteristics fro m steel or fiber-
glass. Unless the part is prepped 
carefully, the repa ir materials will 
peel off within a few months, if not 
sooner. Because the plastic is quite 
flexible, ordinary body fiberglass 
resins, plastic body fillers and glaz-
ing putty wi ll crack. Permatex and 
3M are the major manufacturers 
who sell appropriate repair materi-
als. The car companies all recom-
mend these products for their war-

Plastic Primer 
It's possible to repair small cuts, holes, 
abrasions and other light damage 
without removing the bumper from 
the vehicle. H owever, if the cut is 
longer than an inch, or it extends to 
the edge of the part, you'll have to 
remove the da maged component so 
you can reinforce the back side of 
the repair with fiberglass cloth. 
As noted earlier, most flexible 
bumpers are nothing more than 
bumper covers backed up by other 
plastic components, a steel struc-
ture and collapsible bumper 
mounts. [f you are unsure how to 
remove the bumper o r how to 
remove the flexible cover from the 
bumper structure, consult a service 
manual. 
A special adhesion promoter 
must be used between all the sa nd-
ing steps on parts made with poly-
olefin . T herefore, you' ll have to 
determine if the part you're work-
ing with is a polyolefin plastic 
before you begin. In many cases, 
the letter symbols TPO, PP, E/P or 
EPDM will be clearly marked on 
the inside surface of the plastic. Any 
of these indicate that it is a polyolefin 
plastic. If you can't find letter symbols 
on the part, sand the plastic with a 
36-grit, 3-in. disc using a drill motor. 
If the p lastic melts or smears, it's a 
polyolefin plastic. If it sands cleanly, 
it isn't. 
Don't confuse plia ble plastic

with the sheet-molding 
compound (SMC) or fiber-
glass-reinforced polyester 
(FRP) parts commonly used 
on fenders and doors. These 
rigid, composite materials 
are identifiable by the fiber-
glass strands visible at tears 
or holes, and they require a 
different repair method. 
Getting Started 
Once you've determined the 
type of plastic you're work-
ing on, wash all the dirt and 
grime from the inside and 
outside of the part with soap and 
water. After the part dries, clean the 
area to be repaired with a specially 
formulated adhesive-cleaning solvent 
to remove any grease or tar. Be 
absolutely certain the area is com-
pletely clean-don't even touch the 
area with your fingers after it's 
cleaned. Use clean white paper tow-
els, without any printed pattern, to 
apply the cleaner and to dry it off. 
Greasy shop towels, or any other 
source of contamination or oil, will 
prevent adhesion between the repair 
materials and the base plastic of the 
bumper, giving you at best a short-
lived, sloppy-looking repair. 
To reinforce the back side of rips, 
cuts, holes and tears, grind the back 
side of the area surrounding the dam-
age with a 36-grit disc, making sure to 
leave a rough area of at least l!h in. 
surrounding the damage. Don't grind 
all the way through the part. Just 
rough up the surface (Fig. 1). Next, 
cut a piece of fiberglass cloth tape to 
fit over the area. Again, keep the area 
and your hands squeaky clean. Leave 
the fiberglass cloth in its original 
packaging until you need it. Cut the 
cloth with clean scissors on a clean, 
grease-free countertop. Then, thor-
oughly mix together equal amounts of 
300 
. .---
the 2-part repair filler. (If you're 
working with polyolefin plastic, spray 
the repair area with adhesion pro-
moter and let it dry. ) Next, use a plas-
tic spreader to apply the filler to the 
area before applying the fiberglass 
tape. Once the tape is pressed down, 
apply filler to the top of the tape, 
using the spreader to force filler into 
the cloth (Fig. 2). 
It takes about 30 minutes for the 
filler to set thoroughl y at 70· F, but 
temperature and humidity affect 
setup time considerably. If you need 
to work in the winter, take the parts 
and repair materials into a heated 
area hours ahead of time to let them 
warm up. If you're forced to work 
outside, the temperature should be at 
least 65· F. At lower temperatures, the 
resins will take longer to harden, 
and they may never develop their full 
strength. If the part is badl y dam-
aged-say you're reassembling a 
bumper cover that's been broken into 
two or more pieces-it may be neces-
sary to repeat the grinding/ squeegee-
ing/cloth routine several times to 
achieve adequate strength. You may 
need to fasten the bumper cover 
down to something to hold the cor-
rect shape and alignment while the 
resins cure. Once they're set, there's 
no chance of rea ligning them-so 
work carefully. Because you're work-
ing on the back of the part, 
be thorough. You also need to take 
care while worki ng around the areas 
where the bumper is bolted to the 
mounting to be sure it fits properly 
when you're finished. 
Once the reinforced area has set 
completely, check the stiffness of all 
the repaired areas and make sure the 
cover fits over the bumper. It may be 
necessary to repeat the preceding 
steps, adding one or more additional 
layers of fiberglass cloth to build up 
sufficient strength. Just be sure to 
roughen the surface with sandpaper to 
get good grip. Allow adequate time 
for each layer to cure before adding 
the next. Flip the part over, and use 
the 36-grit disc to grind about l!h in. 
arou nd the damaged area to remove 
paint and create a rough, tapered low 
area for the filler to adhere to (Fig. 3). 
After grinding, featheredge the paint 
around the damage using the random-
orbit sander and a ISO-grit disc or a 
rubber-block sander. Featheredge for 
several inches surrounding the repair. 
Blow dust and debris away with an air 
hose. Squeeze out equal parts of the 
filler and mix it thoroughly. Use adhe-
sion promoter (Fig. 4) on the poly-

olefin parts and then spread the filler 
on the repair, taking care to leave it 
slightly higher than the surrounding 
area. If you've ever applied polyester 
body filler or glazing putty to a 
repaired steel body panel, you'll feel 
right at home (Fig. 5). 
Going for the finish 
After the filler has cured, use 240-grit 
discs to sand the fi ller flush with the 
undamaged surface. Fill any pinholes 
or other imperfections by applying 
putty with a plastic spreader (Fig. 6). 
After waiting at least 15 minutes for 
the putty to cure, sand the surface with 
your rubber block and SO-grit paper to 
achieve a smooth contour. Sand out 
the SO-grit scratches with 120-grit 
paper. Then, apply a double wet coat 
of the coating material, and wait 10 
minutes for the coating to " flash" dry. 
Then, apply a second coat. After 45 
minutes of drying time, lightly scuff 
sand the area by hand with 320-grit 
paper, being careful not to break 
through the coating. The bumper is 
then ready to paint using color coats 
recommended for plastic body parts. 
The painting opera tion will proba-
bly have to be done at a body shop, 
but you can prep the part by sanding 
its entire paintable surface with 400-
grit wet sandpaper. Minor imperfec-
tions can be filled with more repair 
putty. The body shop wi ll then have 
to prime it and spray it with a paint 
that has a special additive to make it 
slightly flexible. 
If you're tempted to just touch 
up the panel in the affected areas 
with a spray can of aerosol touch up 
paint from the auto parts store, fine. 
Just remember that the panel is flexi-
ble, and the touch up paint won't 
last. In addition, it wi ll be very diffi-
cult to feather into the existing flexi-
ble paint without leaving an ugly, 
low-gloss edge. 6

H atches on minivans, SUVs 
and hatchbacks can drive you 
crazy. They are big parts of the 
vehicle structure and naturally 
make noise as the body twists

Likely Suspects 
Latches, say, for the glove compart-
ment or console lid, usua lly can be 
adjusted. Move the latch in the direc-
tion that makes the fi t as tight as pos-
sible while still being locka ble. 
Those overhead storage compart-
ments for glasses and garage door 
openers are sure convenient, but 
they're made of hard plastic and are 
likely to generate an excruciating 
buzz. Unfort unately, the catches on 
these aren't ad justa ble. Press various 
spots whi le driving to isolate the 
304 
movement? What kind of shape 
are they in ? The sliding doors of vans 
also can be noisy. Many versions use 
steel rollers riding on steel tracks-the 
potential for trouble is obvious. Try 
to take up excess clearance by loosen-
ing the roller-bracket bolts, then mov-
ing the bracket down. 
Most doors latch onto striker bolts 
that are surrounded by thin plastic or 
nylon wear tubes. W hen these disinte-
grate, there'll be excessive clearance 
in the latching mechanism and a good 
chance of a heavy rattle. For most 
vehicles, you can buy replacement 
striker bolts fro m the aftermarket, but 
anything exotic wi ll require a trip to 
the dealer. 
Sometimes there's a noise that is 
not so much a squeak as a crea k, 
which may be the result of torsional 
flexing in the unibody caused by 
undulations in the road, You can try 
jacking each of the corners one at a 
time and bouncing your own weight 
around inside until you hear the noise 
(sometimes you can actually fee l it). 
See if the screws or push-in fasteners 
that hold the trim panel over the area 
in question are tight. If that's not the 
problem, remove the panel and try to 
duplicate the sound . Can't do it? 
Then cut foa m strips or use foa m tape 
to insulate the panel from the sheet-
metal. 
Stuffing And Strapping 
What materials make sense for insu-
lating one component from another? 
W hatever will fi t easily and stand up

automotive weatherstrip adhesive is 
the standard. Fina lly, get an assort-

mankind's great inventions- with 
which you can keep things away from

Most stickers should peel off with 
the aid of a hair dryer or just plain 
sunshine. 
Bumper Stickers 
Peel 'em off. This is easiest to do on a 
sunny day. Just park so the offending 
sticker is in the sun, wait a half-hour 
or so for things to get hot, and pry up 
a corner with a fingernail. Go slowly. 
Very slowly if the sticker is old and 
fragile. Sometimes it helps to bend the 
sticker back nearly flat-by doing it 
this way, rather than pulling at right 
angles, you're less likely to rip the 
film. 
It's the dead of winter and you 
don't want that Grateful Dead danc-

the panel with a hair dryer or a heat 
gun for a couple of minutes to soften 
the sticker's vinyl film and the adhe-
sIve. 
Still getting off no more than dime-
size shreds of vinyl film? You might 
try to soften the sun-damaged film 
and its dried-out adhesive with sol-
vent. We like to use citrus-based 
cleaners like Goo Gone first-they're 
less likely to damage 
paint. Use full-strength 
and let it soak in for a few 
minutes. If it's hot, you 
may need to cover the 
area with a plastic bag to 
keep the solvent from 
evaporating. More stub-
born cases might benefit 
from a lacquer thinner or 
another serious solvent.

Add a couple of spoonfuls of house-

ammonia will stink-do this outdoors

stick the bag to the film. If needed, 
add some more spra y between the bag 
and the film to keep things wet and

should be able to peel off the tint

Freshening Up Your Musty Interior 
S
aturday night, and you're 
ready to prowl. Actually, it's 
time to take your potential in-

Smell Patrol 
We know a man who was getting 
ready to sell his beloved vintage 
Corvette because the interior reeked. 
Then he found the cause: A slim pack-
age of meat had fallen out of a gro-
cery bag and ended up under the 
spare tire. While your car may not 
present such an extreme example, the 
first step in deodorizing is to remove 
everything from the interior that's not 
bolted down or welded in place. 
Besides the floor mats, that means all 
the flotsam and jetsam under the 
seats, the fast-food wrappers from the 
console and the odd dead chipmunk 
from the glove compartment. Then, 
do the same w ith the trunk. 
Now feel around for dampness. If 
any area is wet, a repair is called for. 
(We'll get to that.) But that still doesn't 
relieve you of the task at hand, which 
is to get the inside of that car as clean 
as possible.

Another means of keeping the

sweet is an afterblower, such as the 
type sold by AirSept 
(www.airsept.com ). It·s an electronic 
module that you wire into the blower 
circuit. It keeps the fan running for a

for long periods-the busy little devils 
can make themselves right at home in 
one night, typically in the glove com-

O nce yo u've located and vacu-

The most likely source for the odor of 
gasoline inside your car is the evapo-

co llects the fuel that eva porates from 
the tank, and stores it in a charcoal 
canister to be metered into the engine 
intake while the engine is running. 
The vapor hose from the tank can be 
cut or become disconnected. The 
result is fum es escaping into the inte-

which likely will req uire that you pull 
up the trunk mat, then follow the 
hoses that run from it. (I

Fixing Hood And Trunk Latches 
The plastic arm on this electrical tail-

Mechanic. 
Slap and tickle 
O ur most common scenario: Pull the 
hood release and the hood doesn't 
budge. But pull the inside release 
w hile someone presses the hood 
down, and the latch tri ps. There are 
usuall y a couple of things, happening 
concurrently, that cause this. 
• The latch mechanism is sticky 
311 

from corrosion and/or dirt. Some-
times all it takes to loosen things up is 
a healthy hosing down with penetrat-
ing oil while the mechanism is worked 
back and forth. Follow up the pene-
trating oil with spray lithium grease 
to keep things moving. Don't use sili-
cone spray, which can wind up sucked 
into your air cleaner, contaminating 
your 02 sensors. 
• The cable that leads back to the 
interior release ma y be stretched or 
frayed. Sometimes the stop on the end 
of the cable is adjustable-it may 
have slipped a few millimeters. Read-
just it appropriately. Then consider 
why the cable is stretching. What's 
binding up and making you pull too 
hard and overstress things? If the 
cable feels gritty on operation, try 
lubricating it. Use an aerosol spray 
lubricant-not penetrating oil, which 
is too light-with a straw-style noz-
zle. Perch the straw so the end butts 
against the end of the cable sheath 
and right alongside the inner cable. 
Fold a clean shop rag over the conflu-
ence of the straw and cable, and pinch 
tightly with your fingers. When you 
depress the nozzle on the aerosol can, 
lubricant will be forced between the 
cable and sheath, making the action 
of the cable much smoother. If you 
have compressed air ava ilable, you 
can use a blast of it to force the lube 
deeper into the sheath. This technique 
works for almost any Bowden-style 
cable, including heater-control cables, 
the throttle on your lawnmower and 
the brake cable on little Suzy's metal-
lic purple banana-seat bicycle. 
• If the cable is starting to corrode 
and has little steel threads poking out, 
it has already started to fai l. Swap it 
out for a new one immediately. Splash 
the new one with some lubricant now 
and then to keep this from happening 
down the road. 
Failure is not an option 
Another scenario is that you pull on 
the release and it moves freely-
because the cable is already broken. 
Now you're screwed. You have no 
easy way to open the hood, which can 
make for a long time between tune ups 
312 
CHECK FIT HERE 
and oil changes. If the cable has come 
adrift at the handle inside the passen-
ger compartment, you may be able to 
reattach it. Or, perhaps you can grab 
the cable with a pair of pliers and 
yank on it to open the hood. Then 
you'll be able to access the other end 
of the cable and replace it. If the fail-
ure is at the hood end, check with a 
flashlight and a small mirror. (We use 
a small mirror with a swiveling, 
extendible handle.) Looking through

the grille, you may be able to see the 
lever that the ca ble pulls on in the 
latch mechanism. If this is the case, 
try inserting a long screwdriver or 
other implement into the gap and 
tripping the latch. I've even resorted 
to fabricating a special tool from a 
piece of flat steel. Find a similar car, 
open the hood, and figure out how to 
bend the steel and then how to thread 
it into the latch and trip it. Practice on 
your example vehicle to make it easy. 
INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR 

Try to loosen or remove 
the gri lIe to ma ke access eas-
ier. Try not to do this where 
the local police might take an 
interest in your activities 
unless you have your ID and 
the registration handy, espe-
cially late at night. 
• If all else fails, it may be 
necessary to drill a hole in 
the hood sheetmetal to trip 
the latch, but this is a last 
resort. Check the vehicle's 
shop manual for insight into 
opening the hood in the 
event of a cable failure. 
Trunk line 
Like the hood, the trunk 
should be adjusted on its 
hinges and rubber stops to 
close with a proper fit. (See 
"Fitness Training," page 
116.) The latch mechanism 
can then be tweaked to

achieve proper function. If the 
mechanical pushbutton or key tum-
bler is hard to actuate, start with 
adjustments and lubrication. 
Many vehicles use electrical actua-
tors for the trunk or hatch. If the elec-
trical actuator is kaput, you'll need to 
troubleshoot that with a digital volt-
meter (rated at 5 megohm, to be safe) 
and a schematic. But if you can hea r 
the actuator clicking and the latch 
doesn't open, you've got a hardware 
problem. 
If there's a keyhole, you should be 
able to open the lid or hatch with a 
key. There's an urban legend about 
the owner of the high-priced luxury 
car who got a flat tire and was unable 
to open the trunk and access the spare 
because the remote-control trunk key 
fob had dead batteries. After waiting 
2 hours for the tow truck to arrive, 
the owner then watched the truck dri-
ver easily open the trunk-by turning 
the key in the lock-and then change 
the tire. Moral: Don't make this any 
harder than necessary.

or remove the rear seat to get any-
where near the mechanism. Check the 
owner's manual for hints about emer-
gency access to the trunk-there may 
be a simple cable to pull in case of 
major failures. All new cars have an 
emergency cable release meant to pre-
vent a child from getting trapped 
inside a locked trunk. If you can reach 
that release by getting around the rear 
seatback, you can pop the trunk. 
Once the hatch or trunk is open, you 
can clean and lube the parts to free 
things up. 
Trunks and hatches often respond 
to proper fitting and adjustment, just 
like hoods. Get the sheetmetal to fit 
properly, and then adjust the latch 
and striker for proper function. Don't 
forget to lu bricate the out-of-sight 
part of the latch mechanism. One 
important part of a tuneup is to lubri-
cate the door, hood and trunk hinges 
and latches. If your mechanic is 
neglecting this, you should take 5 
minutes and lu bricate these parts 
yourself. 
Most of the time, when there is a 
failure of the latch mechanism, it's a 
plastic component that has broken. 
You'll need to go to the dealer for a 
replacement part. Sticky or hard-to-
operate latches usually need nothing 
more than lubrication and adjust-
ment. 
FiII'erup 
Fuel doors usually have a simple bolt-
based latch, with a simple ca ble to 
operate it. If the cable is gritty or 
sticky, try lubing it with the shop 
towel/spray lube trick mentioned ear-
lier. If the bolt doesn't retract enough, 
look for an adjustment for length at 
one end of the cable or the other. 
Lube the hinges as well, and make 
sure the spring isn't broken or 
loose. t;

Tools of the Trade 
To a mechanic, "tools" fall into two important categories: " hardware" tools, the implements that 
actually do the job, and "software" tools, the books and other publications that provide the infor-
mation necessary to do the job. To work on your own car with any measure of success, you'll have 
to stock your garage with some of both. 
STRATEGIES AND INSTRUCTIONS 
There's no good excuse for a driveway mechanic to be without the factory service manual for 
his automobile. General auto repair manuals that cover a variety of makes are less expensive than 
several factory manuals if you have more than one car to work on. You can usually buy the factory 
manual through your car dealer's parts counter. For some cars, more than one instruction book is 
necessary to fully cover drivetrain as well as body and electronics. The service manuals for all late-
models (since 1996) are on websites maintained by the vehicle makers. So instead of a paper man-
ual, you can gain access when you want, typically for about $15 a day. Manuals for older cars are 
sold by specialty distributors with toll-free numbers. 
THE SERVICE MANUAL 
Most factory service manuals begin with a general information section, usually with charts that 
tell you how to interpret your car's VIN number. You'll be able to pinpoint the specs of the engine 
installed, the plant at which the car was built, and similar data. Other chatts interpret body ID 
plates with paint and interior color codes as well as trim levels. Other general information will 
include overall specs, fluid capacities of the various systems, and even data on bolt ID and torgue. 
This chapter should also show the correct jack and lift points for raising and supporting your car. 
The general information section is often followed by a maintenance and lube chapter. Use this 
material in conjunction with our car care plans to tailor the maintenance routines to your specific 
vehicle. 
The rest of your service manual is divided into chapters, each of which covers one specific system, 
such as heating and ventilation, or a group of systems, such as emissions controls. 
Most manual chapters include three types of information. First, where applicable, many chapters 
begin with a short explanation on how a particular system operates. This information can help 
when it comes to making logical decisions about the possible causes of a given problem. 
Next comes diagnostic information. This troubleshooting material can be very general and some-
what brief or it can be incredibly specific and detailed. Typical of the first kind of diagnostic direc-
tions are those for engine mechanical diagnosis. Here you'll find lists of possible causes that relate 
to a symptom. For example, in the 1985 Celebrity manual there are eight potential problem areas 
listed under the heading "Excessive Oil Loss." 
Much more complicated are the diagnostic procedures for driveability problems. Some makers, 
such as GM, instruct you to begin the diagnosis of a driveability problem by triggering the diagnos-

tic mode of the computer system. You progress from there to troubleshooting individual systems 
with test lights, ohmmeters, and the like, and sometimes finish up by checking symptom-organized 
lists of possible causes. 
Other manufacturers, notably Chrysler, begin diagnosis of computer-controlled engine driveabil-
ity problems with visual checks. In either case, you have to read the manual material carefully and 
do things in the right order. The procedures work on a process-of-elimination basis. If you don't 
begin at the beginning, you throw the whole diagnostic plan out of whack. 
At some point, the troubleshooting of complex systems is sure to include a diagnostic "tree dia-
gram." You begin by performing the test in the box at top, then depending on the results of that 
first test, you will be led through a series of steps to diagnose your problem. You'll notice that every 
path eventually concludes with a repair or with a "system OK." 
The third type of information, usually at the end of a service manual chapter, is on repairs. It 
often doesn't include tasks considered simple by professional mechanics. 
THE TOOLBOX 
How many tools do you need to service your car? Frankly, as many as you can afford. But you can 
get by with a fairly basic set if you intend to do only maintenance jobs. But if you're going to per-
form complicated repairs you'll need a lot of special tools, many of them designed to do just one 
specific job. Check auto parts stores in your area for tool rental peograms. 
PLIER TOOLS 
From among the vast number of plier tools, you'll need at least three basic types: a conventional 
slipjoint plier, a pair of side-cutters for cutting and stripping wire and-among many other uses-
prying out cotter pins, and a pair of long-nose or needle-nose pliers. 
Once you have the basic three you'll eventually want to expand your plier drawer. You might first 
add a locking plier; the most common type is sold under the Vise-Grip trademark. Among many 
other possible uses, this tool can be clamped tightly around a stripped bolt for removal or it can be 
used to hold parts in place for welding. Lineman's pliers with insulated handles are useful for vari-
ous electrical-system chores. Water-pump pliers offer nearly parallel jaws and lots of leverage. A 
second pair of long-nose pliers can be sharpened for service on snap rings, or special snap-ring pli-
ers are available as well. Small side-cutters can be of use when working with delicate components. 
Hose-clamp pliers are grooved to grab the spring-type hose clamps that are standard equipment on 
many cars. Wire strippers/terminal crimpers are very useful pliers with a row of split circles on the 
jaws for stripping wires of various gauges and a special crimping area behind the jaws for attaching 
solderless wire terminals. Tin snips, available for cutting left-hand curves, righthand curves, and 
straight cuts, are a necessity if you're going to do serious bodywork. 
SCREWDRIVERS 
For servicing today's cars, you'll need an assortment of flat-blade and Phillips screwdrivers in vari-
ous sizes. You'll ruin a lot of screwheads if you use the wrong-size driver. In addition to various-
sized tips, you'll need some variety in handle lengths. Cheap screwdrivers are not well suited to dri-
ving screws, so buy high-quality tools that will not distort the screwheads. 
317 

318 
TOOLS OF THE TRADE 
------
For most cars you'll also need a couple of Torx-style screwdrivers, distinguished by their six-point dri-
ves. On some cars, you'll need this type of screwdriver to replace a headlight bulb or seatbelt housing. 
Our favorite screwdriver is a high-quality, flexible-shaft ratchet job with interchangeable bits of 
tool steel. The extra bits fit in the handle, and are available in every size and style you might need. 
Angle screwdrivers, with a tip mounted perpendicular to the shaft, are useful for screws that can't 
be reached with anything else. 
SOCKET TOOLS 
Square-drive tools are probably the most important for someone who intends to service automo-
biles. To begin, you'll need both 3/8-in.-drive and 1I2-in.-drive ratchets and breaker bars, at least 
one short and one long extension for each drive, and a complete set of standard sockets for each. If 
your car is fully metric, you may want to purchase only metric sockets at first. If your car includes 
both metric and inch sizes, you'll need a set of each. 
You'll need a spark-plug socket of either 13/1 6-in. or S/8-in. size. Don't just use a deep socket for 
this purpose. Spark plug sockets have a special rubber insert to hold the insulator, helping prevent 
breakage while giving you a means to lift the plug away from the engine without dropping it. 
A torque wrench is also a necessity, as it should be used for everything from installing wheels to 
tightening cylinder head or manifold bolts. The most common and least expensive type has a pointer 
attached to the drive head that rests against a scale near the handle. More expensive types replace the 
scale and pointer with a dial. A style used by many mechanics has a rotating handle with a scale of 
torque figures on the tool. You dial in the torque figure you want by turning the handle. Then, when 
you tighten the bolt, the wrench will click to signal you when you reach the specified figure. 
Eventually, you'll want to add universal joints, which can be fitted at the end of an extension; 
speed handles; T-handles; additional extensions; and a l/4-in. ratchet, extension, and screwdriver 
handle for smaller capscrews. Adapters that allow the use of 3/8-in.-drive sockets on 1I2-in.-drive 
ratchets (or various other combinations) can also be handy at times. You'll want to expand your 
socket set to include hex or Allen drive sockets, sockets for large slotted screws, deep-well sockets, 
universal-joint "swivel" sockets, and 1I4-in.-drive sockets, all in both inch and metric sizes. 
You'll also want to supplement your standard twelve-point sockets with some eight-, six-, and 
fourpoint sockets (Fig. 4). Six-point sockets are needed when you have to loosen a bolt with 
rounded corners where the twelve-point might slip. Our 3/8-in.-drive deep-well sockets are of the 
six-point type. Thickwall six-point sockets (usually black for identification) are available for use 
with impact wrenches. Eight- and four-point sockets are for removal of square plugs. If you have 
the eight-pointers, you really don't need the fours. 
If you can't reach the spark plugs on your engine with a conventional plug socket, extension, and 
ratchet, you may need either a swivel-head plug socket or a 3/8-in.-drive ratchet with a jointed hand 
that can be rotated to a different angle in respect to its handle. 
WRENCHES 
A basic set of combination wrenches-box at one end and open end on the other- will get you 
started in this department. Use a box wrench when you don't have clearance for a socket. Open-end 
wrenches are really only suited to running down a bolt or backing it out, as they slip quite easily, 
ruining both the bolthead and your knuckles. 

TOOLS OF THE TRADE --------- --
An open-end wrench should be used with the handle angled away from the direction of rotation . 
Once the bolt is rotated, the wrench is slipped off, slid around in a counterclockwise direction and 
reinserted. O nce you've practiced this technique, an open-end can be used to turn a bolt very 
quickly. When loosening a fastener with a combination wrench, break it loose with the box end, 
then flip the wrench around and run out the bolt with the open end. 
Once you have a basic wrench set, you'll want to expand with some other types. Those that have 
a box on both ends generally have a greater offset than the combos, making them useful for certain 
problem areas. Both box and open-end wrenches are available in a variety of lengths. You'l l also 
find box wrenches shaped like a crescent for inaccessible bolts, box wrenches that ratchet, and 
sockets attached to a handle with an open-end opposite. We frequently use a very thin open-end 
"tappet" wrench for any double-nutted bolt or stud or in tight spots. 
You'll also want tubing wrenches, which are like a six-point open-end with one side missing. 
Once slipped over a tube, the five remaining points of the wrench can loosen the soft nut on the end 
of the tube without rounding it off. Special L-shaped box wrenches that can be driven with a 
ratchet are available for loosening hard-to-reach distributor clamp bolts. 
You might be better off without adjustable crescent wrenches, as these tools are most likely 
to round off a hexhead. But it's good to have a couple of them around in different sizes for 
those times when you have to turn a simple-to-reach, not-very-tight bolt, the size of which yo u 
are not sure. 
HAMMERS 
Hammers must be used with great restraint when working on a complicated machine like an auto-
mobile. But you will need one from time to time. Begin with a ball-peen for tapping your drift or 
making a center-punch mark, and supplement it with a rubber mallet for driving things into posi-
tion. Eventually, you'll want to add a brass hammer for driving lugs into hubs and similar tasks. A 
plastic-head hammer is useful for dislodging somewhat delicate parts. Finally, you'll want a good 
hand sledge to drive a large chisel into a large rusty nut. 
You'll want to have some chisels, punches, and drifts that you can hit with your hammers. If you 
work on cars regularly, you'll undoubtedly have to chisel off a rusted nut or bolt before long, prob-
ably on a shock absorber. Drifts are used for removing pins from shafts, studs, or hubs. A center 
punch is necessary to provide a spot to start a drill bit in steel or aluminum. 
You'll need only a couple of files at first. A small ignition-point fi le is good for cleaning up spark 
plugs or even repairing the threads on a small screw. One medium-size flat file will also come in 
handy for smoothing rough edges or flattening slightly distorted surfaces. Later, you'll want to add 
a rattail for smoothing out holes and a threesided file for getting into corners. A hacksaw and a 
couple of high quality, fine-tooth blades will come in handy if you have to shorten a bolt or fabri-
cate a bracket. 
An assortment of tool-steel high quality drill bits and a 112-in. or 3/8-in. chuck electric drill is also 
necessary. 
PULLERS AND PLUCKERS 
Hub pullers, nut splitters, gear pullers, pickle forks, and other devices of this ilk probably won't be 
purchased until you need them. Sooner or later you will undoubtedly want them, however. 
319 

TOOLS OF THE TRADE 
A good three-pronged gear puller can be used for removing a variety of hubs and gears. This tool 
is available in several sizes to suit various applications. A puller with slots through which bolts can 
be inserted is useful for removing any type of hub with threaded holes, such as a steering wheel hub 
or engine damper pulley. Various other pullers, including slide-hammer devices for removal of rear-
drive axles, are also available. Some of them can be rented for one-time use. 
A nut splitter is a good substitute for a chisel when you have to remove a rusted nut. A ball-joint 
spreader and rod-end separator, commonly known as pickle forks, are necessary for suspension-
system work. The ball-joint spreader has the wider slot between its prongs. 
OIL CHANGE AND LUBE TOOLS 
An oil filter wrench is, of course, an absolute necessity for any driveway mechanic. Before you buy, 
make sure you get one that will work on your car, as there are numerous types available. 
Most of the long-handled metal-band jobs work great where there's room for them, but on most 
cars there isn't. The best of these are adjustable for different type filters. 
A handy oil filter wrench is the type that has a sturdy nylon strap attached to a piece of square 
tubing with a 1/2-in. hole down the center. The strap is placed over the filter and the tubing is 
rotated counterclockwise until the strap snugs up. Then a 1/2-in. square drive extension and ratchet 
are used to continue rotating the tubing until the filter is loosened. 
PRECISION TOOLS 
Every home mechanic should have at least a good pair of vernier calipers for determining the size 
of pins, bolts, and other similar items as well as a set of feeler gauges and a wire gauge for check-
ing spark plugs. If you're going to rebuild engines, you'll need much more, including microme-
ters, snap gauges, a dial indicator and magnetic base, a depth micrometer, and-ideally-a dial-
bore ga uge. A good ring compressor will also be needed for engine work. The best type is a 
tapered sleeve for each bore size. If you plan on assembling cylinder heads, you'll need a valve-
spring compressor that will work on your engine. Those for pushrod engines won't work on 
overhead cam engines, some of which require specific adapters. 
The dial indicator and magnetic base are probably worth having even if you never touch the 
inside of an engine as they are useful for gauging a lot of different things, such as ball-joint wear 
and even wheel-bearing adjustment. 
OTHER GOOD STUFF 
Sooner or later you'll want to invest in a battery charger. A small, IO-amp job can bring a partially 
discharged battery to full charge in a few hours. You'll need at least a 6-amp model for decent per-
fOl·mance. In addition, you'll need a battery post and terminal cleaning tool. You can use a knife for 
this job, but the special cleaning tool is inexpensive and does a better job. You'll need a timing light 
to perform tune ups, but be aware many late-models do not require it (no timing marks) . If you're 
willing to suffer, you can use the cheap kind that attaches only to the plug wire. A power timing 
light, which provides much more illumination and is immeasurably easier to use, costs about three 
times as much.

TOOLS OF THE TRADE 
And you can't get by without a miniature analyzer, which includes a tachometer, ohmmeter, volt-
meter, ammeter, and dwell meter on older cars. Use it for tuneups, charging-system troubleshooting, 
general electrical-system troubleshooting, and a wide variety of other jobs. On late-models, a scan 
tool is essential to read trouble codes and engine operating data, including much of the information 
provided by the tachometer. A volt-ohmmeter, or volt-ohm-ammeter, continues to be useful. 
A good set of taps and dies is expensive but necessary when you have to straighten out the 
threads on a mangled bolt or clean the threads in a rusty cylinder block. Finally, don't forget to be 
nice to your tools. You don't have to get into public displays of affection, but you should wipe off 
the grease each time you use one. And you should have an organizational plan for keeping every-
thing in its place, whether you have a twelve-drawer top-and-bottom tool chest or a two-drawer 
mini toolbox. Knowing where something is when you need it can cut your creeper time in half. It 
also makes it easier to tell when something is missing.

the camshaft and crankshaft so the valves for each cylinder open and close at the right time for proper 
engine operation, a factor called camshaft timing. 
CARBON CANISTER: a canister filled with activated charcoal. When the engine is off, it absorbs vapors from 
the fuel system that would otherwise cause air pollution. These vapors are drawn into the engine and 
burned when the engine is running. 
CARBON DEPOSITS: the residue of carbon from burning fuel, which can clog grooves in pistons, combustion 
chambers, and valves, and cause engine hesitation and other operational maladies. 
CARBON TRACKS: fine lines from burned carbon (such as from oil film) that may be found in a distributor 
cap. Carbon tracks may cause engine misfire.

TAILPIPE : a pipe that follows the muffler and is the end of the exhaust system. 
TEMPERATURE-SENSITIVE BIMETAL COIL: a part made of dissimilar meta ls that cause the coil to flex with 
changes in temperature. The flexing bimetal can operate a temperature-sensitive device, such as a carbure-
tor choke, or the hydraulic circuit in most non-electric radiator fans. 
TEST LIGHT: a device used to test electrical circuits. It contains a bulb or electronic equi valent, such as a 
light-emitting diode (LED), that goes on when a circuit is complete and carrying electricity. 
THERMODYNAMICS: the science that dea ls with heat and heat transfe r. 
THERMOSTAT: a temperature-sensitive valve that regulates the flow of coolant between radiator and engine. 
THERMOSTATIC AIR CLEANER: an air cleaner housing with a flap valve that is controlled by a thermostatic 
device. In one position, it ducts hot air from the area of the exhaust system into the engine for smooth 
operation when the engine is cold. In the other position, it ducts cool, more dense air from the front of the 
car into the engine when it is warm for more power. It was used on engines with carburetors. 
THERMOSTATIC SWITCH: a switch that opens or closes at a certain temperature. 
THROTTLE BODY: the part of the fuel system that holds a flat, generally round plate (the throttle valve) that 
regulates the flow of air into the cylinders in response to how much the driver steps down on the accelera-
tor. The throttle body may be part of a fuel injection or carburetor fuel system. Regulating the air flow con-
trols the speed of the engine and therefore the amount of power it produces. 
THROTTLE-BODY FUEL INJECTION: a simp lified fuel injection system with one or two fuel injectors positioned 
above the throttle valve. 
THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR: a sensor that determines how far the gas pedal has been depressed, and deliv-
ers that information to the engine control module. 
THRUST ANGLE: a locational relationshi p between the front and rear sets of wheels. 
TIE ROD: a rod which is part of the steering system and links the steering knuckles to the steering rack or a 
center lin k. 
TIME: the state of timing. See JUMPED TIME. 
TIMING: the regulation of the ignition system such that it produces a spark at the spark plug at the correct 
instant for combustion; the regu lation of the camshaft such that it opens and closes the valves to admit air-
fuel mixtu re and a llow exhaust gases to exit the cylinder. 
TIMING GUN: see TIMING LIGHT. 
TIMING LIGHT: a special type of light that when aimed at a mark on a rotating part lights only when a spark 
337

GLOSSARY 
plug is triggered, so the mark seems to stand still. The instantaneous alignment of this mark with a fixed 
mark on the engine permits a check of ignition timing, and adjustment if necessary. See TIMING MARKS. 
TIMING MARKS: a fixed mark on the engine and a second mark on a part that turns with the crankshaft 
(such as a belt pulley in front or the engine flywheel in the rear). When these marks align (as checked with a 
timing light) is an indication of the adjustment of the ignition system. Many late-model vehicles, with com-
puter controls of timing, do not have these marks. 
TOE: a measurement of whether the wheels at front or rear point toward each other (called toe-in) or away 
(called toe-out). 
TOP DEAD CENTER (TDC): when the piston is at the very top of its upward movement. 
TORQUE CONVERTER: a fluid-filled device with fanlike members that couples an engine to an automatic 
transmission. 
TORQUE WRENCH: a wrench with a dial that reads in a measurement of twisting force, such as pound-feet or 
ounce-inches, or their metric equivalent, such as Newton-meter, abbreviated N-m. 
TORSION BAR: a spring in the shape of a bar. It has been used in the suspensions of many cars. 
TORX: a type of screwhead that requires a specific size Torx wrench to be loosened or tightened. 
TRANSAXLE: a transmission/axle combination, most often found in front-wheel drive cars, in which the 
clutch, gearbox, and differential are all housed in a single unit. 
TRANSMISSION: a component with gears and shafts that takes the power of the engine and transmits it, 
through external shafts, to the wheels to move the car. The gears have different ratios to move the car at 
different speeds. 
TRIGGER WHEEL: in the ignition system, a wheel with flat, square "teeth," operated by a shaft in the distrib-
utor. It often is used to trigger a Hall-effect pickup to produce a signal to the engine control module. 
TROUBLE CODE: see DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODE. 
TVRS WIRE: a type of resistance wire used for spark plug wires. It minimizes ignition system interference 
with the radio and other electronic components on the car. 
UNIVERSAL JOINT (U-JOINT, ALSO CALLED CARDAN JOINT): a flexible coupling using a double yoke and a fouf-
point cross. It is used most commonly to connect the driveshaft to the transmission and the differential in a 
front-engine rear-drive car. 
VACUUM: pressure that is lower than atmospheric, produced by the engine or a pumping device, mea-
sured in inches or millimeters (mm) of mercury. The engine produces about 17-22 inches (approximately 
430-560 mm) at engine idle speed. Engine vacuum normally is measured at a hose neck on the intake 
manifo ld. 
VACUUM GAUGE: a gauge that measures vacuum, such as that produced by an engine. 
VACUUM HOSE: a hose that connects a source of vacuum, such as on the engine's intake manifold, to a 
device that uses it, such as a power brake unit. 

GLOSSARY 
VACUUM LEAK: a loss of vacuum from a leaking hose or defective gasket. 
VALVE CLEARANCE: an air gap that exists between the tip of a valve and the part that opens it when the valve 
is fully closed. In some engines this gap is adjustable and must be set to specifications. 
VALVE LIFTER: a valve train component. In OHV (overhead valve) engines, the lifter is positioned between the 
cam lobe and the pushrod. In some overhead camshaft engines, the lifter is positioned between the cam 
lobe and the valve stem. 
VALVE SEAT: a surface in the combustion chamber, against which a valve seats when closed. 
VALVE SPRING: a spring that keeps an engine valve closed until pushed open by a rocker or by the valve lifter. 
VALVE TRAIN: the system of parts that operates (and includes) the intake and exhaust va lves. 
V-BELT: a drivebelt with the cross-sectional shape of the letter V that rides in a similarly shaped pulley. Also 
see DRIVEBELT. 
VOLTS (OR VOLTAGE): a measurement of electrical pressure. The automobile today uses an electrical system 
that operates on approximately 12 volts. Most engine control modules and their associated parts contain 
both 5-volt and 12-volt circuits. A car's ignition system typically develops about 10,000-50,000 volts. Also 
see AMPS and OHMS. 
VOLTMETER: a test meter that measures volts. 
V-TYPE ENGINE: an engine with two banks of cylinders set at an angle, such as a V4, V6, V8, VI0, V12, and 
V16. The number following the V is the total number of cylinders, such as two banks of two cylinders in a 
V4. 
WATER JACKET: passages in an engine through which coolant is circulated. 
WATER PUMP: a small pump, driven by a pulley, which circulates coolant through the cooling system; it can 
be driven by the fan belt, alternator belt, or overhead cam timing belt or chain. 
WHEEL ALIGNMENT: adjustment of the suspension and steering of a car so it rides straight down the road and 
responds predictably in turns. The measurements adjusted or checked include TOE, CASTER, CAMBER, and 
THRUST ANGLE. 
WHEEL BEARING: a ball or roller bearing assembly that supports whatever part to which the wheel is 
mounted, so the wheel can spin freely as the car rolls down the road. See BEARING. 
WHEEL CHOCK: a triangular piece of metal or wood that can be wedged between a tire and the ground to 
keep the car from rolling. 
WHEEL SPINDLE: a flange that holds the wheel bearing assembly. It may be the end of a driveshaft. 
WIRING DIAGRAM: a diagram that shows how the wires in the car, or an individual circuit, are connected to 
components and to one another. 
WIRING HARNESS: a group of wires bundled together and covered by a protective jacket. 
WIRING HARNESS CONNECTOR: a single connector with many terminals for electrical wiring connections.
