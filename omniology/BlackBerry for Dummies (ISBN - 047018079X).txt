BlackBerry For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Introduction
H
i there, and welcome to the second edition of BlackBerry For Dummies.
If you already have a BlackBerry, this is a great book to have around
when you want to discover new features or need something to slap open and
use as a quick reference. If you don’t have a BlackBerry yet and have some
basic questions (such as “What is a BlackBerry?” or “How can a BlackBerry
help me be more productive?”), you can benefit by reading this book cover 
to cover. If you bought the first edition of our book and recently got a new
BlackBerry, this second edition bridges the gap and gets you up-to-date on
the latest innovations added to your device. No matter what your current
BlackBerry user status — BUS, for short — we’re here to help you get the
most out of your BlackBerry.
Right off the bat, we can tell you that a BlackBerry is not a fruit you find at
the supermarket but rather is an always-connected handheld device that has
e-mail capabilities and a built-in Internet browser. With your BlackBerry, you
are in the privileged position of always being able to receive e-mail and
browse the Web.
On top of that, a BlackBerry has all the features you expect from a personal
organizer, including a calendar, to-do lists, and memos. Oh, and did we men-
tion that a BlackBerry also has a built-in mobile phone? Talk about multitask-
ing! Imagine being stuck on a commuter train: With your BlackBerry by your
side, you can compose e-mail while conducting a conference call — all from
the comfort of your seat.
That’s not all. BlackBerry goes a step further to make it more fun for you to
own this device. You can snap a picture with its camera, listen to your music
collection, and enjoy watching that video on YouTube.
In this book, we show you all the basics but then go the extra mile by high-
lighting some of the lesser-known (but still handy) features of the BlackBerry.
Your BlackBerry can work hard for you when you need it, as well as play hard
when you want it to. (Need we say that we’re ready, willing, and able to show
you where to get great games for your BlackBerry?)

About This Book
BlackBerry For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is a comprehensive user guide as well
as a quick user reference. This book is designed so that you certainly can
read it cover to cover if you want, but you don’t need to read one chapter
after the other. Feel free to jump around while you explore the different func-
tionalities of your BlackBerry.
We cover basic and advanced topics, but we stick to those that we consider
the most practical and frequently used. If you use or want to use a certain
function of your BlackBerry, we likely cover it here.
This book is also targeted to the latest models as of this writing. Without
going into the many model numbers, if you see a trackball in your device, 
this book is intended for you. If you own a BlackBerry that uses a trackwheel
instead of a trackball, you should get the first edition of this book.
Who Are You?
In this book, we tried to be considerate of your needs, but because we’ve
never met you, our image of you is as follows. If you find that some of these
images are true about you, this might just be the book for you:
 You have a BlackBerry, and you want to find out how to get the most
from it.
 You don’t have a BlackBerry yet, and you’re wondering what one could
do for you.
 You’re looking for a book that doesn’t assume that you know all the
jargon and tech terms used in the PDA industry. (PDA stands for 
personal digital assistant, by the way. Take that, you jargon, you!)
 You want a reference that shows you, step by step, how to do useful and
cool things with a BlackBerry without bogging you down with unneces-
sary background or theory.
 You’re tired of hauling your 10-pound laptop with you on trips, and you’re
wondering how to turn your BlackBerry into a miniature traveling office.
 You no longer want to be tied to your desktop system for the critical
activities in your life, such as sending and receiving e-mail, checking
your calendar for appointments, and surfing the Web.

BlackBerry For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

What’s in This Book
BlackBerry For Dummies, 2nd Edition, consists of five parts, and each part
consists of different chapters related to that part’s theme.
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry
Part I starts with the basics of your BlackBerry. You know: What it is, what
you can do with it, and what the parts are. We describe the differences
between owning a BlackBerry with SureType versus a QWERTY keyboard. 
We also show you how to personalize and express yourself through your
BlackBerry. This part wraps up with must-knows about security and where 
to go for help when you get into trouble with your BlackBerry.
Part II: Getting Organized 
with Your BlackBerry
Part II deals with the fact that your BlackBerry is also a full-fledged PDA. We
show you how to get your BlackBerry to keep your contacts in Address Book
as well as how to manage your appointments and meetings in Calendar. We
also show you how to create a to-do list and have Calendar manage your to-
do’s for you so you don’t miss a task. As you’ll see, most BlackBerry applica-
tions interconnect, working hard for you.
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia
with Your BlackBerry
Part III shows you how you can use the true strengths of the BlackBerry — its
always connected e-mail and its Web surfing functionality — but it doesn’t
stop there. We also point out how you can use other forms of messages on
the BlackBerry that you might not have known about, such as PIN-to-PIN mes-
sages. We also describe the fun features of your BlackBerry, such as using its
camera, listening to music, and watching videos. You also find tricks on how
to take advantage of your broadband connection and use it for your laptop.
And rest assured that your BlackBerry will be a good companion when you’re
traveling because we also show you how to use its GPS.

Introduction

Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager
In Part IV, we detail BlackBerry Desktop Manager and show you some of the
hoops you can put it through with your BlackBerry, including making back-
ups and installing BlackBerry applications from your PC to your BlackBerry.
You also find out how to port data from your older devices — BlackBerry or
not — to your new BlackBerry. And we didn’t forget to cover important stuff
such as data syncing your appointments and contacts with desktop applica-
tions such as Outlook and Lotus Notes.
Part V: The Part of Tens
All For Dummies books include The Part of Tens, and this book is no different.
In Part V, we show you where to get cool BlackBerry accessories, download
useful applications, visit useful mobile Web sites, and (of course) get great
games to play on your BlackBerry. In addition, we keep this list up-to-date on
our Web site at www.blackberryfordummies.com.
So Many Models, So Little Time
When you first visit the Web site for Research In Motion (RIM, the brains
behind the BlackBerry device), you might be overwhelmed by the many vari-
ations of BlackBerry. There are black ones, blue ones, some with colored
screens, monochrome ones, ones with QWERTY keyboards, some with a
QWERTY-like keyboard (which RIM calls SureType). Whew!
Don’t worry, it isn’t as complicated as it seems; let us break it down for 
you. We generally don’t like to generalize, but you can pretty much divide
BlackBerry into two categories: the SureType and the QWERTY. And why did
we make such a separation? You operate the two models a bit differently. But
that doesn’t mean the functions underneath are different. Beneath the sur-
face, they are quite similar. For example, both models can do e-mail, but how
you get to your e-mail application is a bit different in each. It’s that simple. Of
course, there are other small (yet important) differences, which we denote in
this book with a Pearl icon (see the following section).
This book is written with the latest model of the SureType and QWERTY
models in mind. If you have a slightly older model, not to worry; you’ll find
this book useful because the functionality is still similar. You just might dis-
cover, however, that some of the newer functions we cover may not be avail-
able on your particular (older) BlackBerry. Of course, you can always refer to
the first edition of the book.

Icons in This Book
If a paragraph sports this icon, it means we’re talking about BlackBerry
devices that are provided by your employer.
Text marked with this icon applies only to the BlackBerry Pearl, which uses
the SureType technology. Other BlackBerry models use a full QWERTY key-
board. On the Pearl’s SureType keyboard, many keys share letters.
This icon highlights an important point that you don’t want to forget because
it just might come up again. We’d never be so cruel as to spring a pop quiz on
you, but paying attention to these details can definitely help you.
This book rarely delves into the geeky, technical details, but when it does,
this icon warns you. Read on if you want to get under the hood a little, or just
skip ahead if you aren’t interested in the gory details.
Here’s where you can find not-so-obvious tricks that can make you a
BlackBerry power-user in no time. Pay special attention to the paragraphs
with this icon to get the most out of your BlackBerry.
Look out! This icon tells you how to avoid trouble before it starts.

T
he road to a happy and collaborative relationship 
with your BlackBerry starts here. Chapter 1 covers all
the nuts and bolts: how the BlackBerry works, its look and

B
ecause you’re reading this book, you probably have a BlackBerry (um, and
we’re pretty sure that you’re not eating it). We’re just curious, though —
what actually convinced you to buy this particular handheld mobile device?
Was it the always-connected e-mail? Or the wireless calendar sync? Was it the
QWERTY keyboard? Or was it the really good sales pitch? We know; the list
could go on and on — and we might never hit on the exact reason why you 
got yours. In fact, for some of you, your company simply handed you one. For
whichever reason you bought or acquired your BlackBerry, congratulations;
you made an intelligent choice.
The same smarts that made you buy or obtain your BlackBerry are clearly at
it again. This time, your native intelligence led you to pick up this book, per-
haps because your intuition is telling you that there’s more to this BlackBerry
than meets the eye.
Your hunch is right. Your BlackBerry can help you do more things than you
could ever think of. For example, your BlackBerry is a whiz at making phone
calls, but it’s also a computer that you can use to check your e-mail and surf
the Web. We’re talking World Wide Web here, so the sky’s the limit. Help is
always at your fingertips rather than sitting on some desk at home or at the
office. Need to check out the reviews of that restaurant on the corner? Need
to know (right now) what’s showing in your local movie theaters, or what the
weather will be later tonight, or the best place to shop? Need to get direc-
tions to that cozy bed and breakfast, or news headlines, or stock quotes?

Want to do some online chatting or view some pictures online? You can do 
all these things (and more) by using your BlackBerry.
BlackBerry is also a full-fledged personal digital assistant (PDA). Out of the
box, it provides you with the organizational tools you need to set up to-do
lists, manage your appointments, take care of your address books, and more.
Being armed with a device that’s a phone, an Internet connection, and a PDA
all built into one makes you a power person. With your BlackBerry (along
with this resourceful book), you really can increase your productivity and
become better organized. Watch out, world! Person bearing a BlackBerry
coming through!
If you stick with us throughout this book, you find out all you need to get the
most out of your device or maybe even stave off (or save) a troubled relation-
ship. (Well, the last one is a bit of an exaggeration, but we got your attention,
right?)
Know Your BlackBerry History
Your BlackBerry is truly a wondrous thing, boasting many features beyond
your ordinary mobile phone. And its “sudden” popularity didn’t happen
overnight. Like any other good product out there, BlackBerry has come a
long way from its (relatively humble) beginnings.
In the days when the PalmPilot ruled the PDA world, Research In Motion (RIM,
the maker of the BlackBerry) was busy in its lab, ignoring the then-popular
graffiti input method to design its own device with a QWERTY keyboard — the
kind of keyboard people were already used to from working on their PCs. RIM
didn’t stop there, however. It added an always-connected e-mail capability,
making this device a must-have among government officials as well as profes-
sionals in the finance and health industries.
To meet the needs of government officials and industry professionals, RIM
made reliability, security, and durability the priorities when manufacturing its
devices. Today, the BlackBerry comes from the same line of RIM family prod-
ucts, inheriting all the good genes while boosting usability and adding more
functions to its core BlackBerry applications. As a result, BlackBerry is popu-
lar among not only prosumers (professional customers) but also consumers.
RIM is also blurring the line between prosumers and consumers with new
models such as the BlackBerry 8300 model, which sports both a QWERTY
keyboard and 2 mega-pixel camera. Essentially, 8300 is the marriage between
the BlackBerry Pearl and the BlackBerry 8800 model.
10
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

Throughout the book, you see sections that apply to prosumers/enterprise
users, indicated by the icon you see here in the margin. If your BlackBerry
was given to you by your employer and your device is set up so that you can
use only your company e-mail address for e-mailing, you can consider your-
self an enterprise user.
On the other hand, if you bought your BlackBerry on your own from a net-
work service provider, such as T-Mobile or Cingular or Vodafone, consider
yourself a consumer.
Why the division? It’s simple. A few features, such as the wireless address
book lookup or wireless calendar sync, need the BlackBerry Enterprise
Server to be connected to a central e-mail server. Such a connection is often
available in large corporations, but no individuals that we can think of would
have their own private BlackBerry Enterprise Server. (Although anything’s
possible, we suppose.)
How It All Works: The 
Schematic Approach
For those who always ask, “How do they do that?” you don’t have to go far;
this little section is just for you.
The role of the network service provider
Along with wondering how your BlackBerry actually works, you might also be
wondering why you didn’t get your BlackBerry from RIM rather than from a
network service provider such as Cingular or T-Mobile. Why did you need to
go through a middle-person? After all, RIM makes BlackBerry.
Those are excellent questions — and here’s the quick-and-dirty answer. RIM
needs a delivery system — a communication medium, as it were — for its
technology to work. Not in a position to come up with such a delivery system
all by its lonesome, RIM partnered (and built alliances across the globe) with
what developed into its network service providers — the usual suspects
(meaning the big cellphone companies). These middle-providers support the
wireless network for your BlackBerry so that you have signals to connect to
the BlackBerry Internet Service — and get all those wonderful e-mails (and
waste so much valuable time surfing the Internet). See Figure 1-1 for a
schematic overview of this process.
11
Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is Not an Edible Fruit

Network service providers don’t build alliances for nothing, right? In return,
RIM gave them the right to brand their names on the BlackBerry they offer for
sale. For example, a T-Mobile BlackBerry looks different from a similar model
you get from Vodafone. Which leads to another question: Do BlackBerry func-
tionalities differ from phone model to phone model? Quick answer: On the
core BlackBerry applications (such as Tasks and Address Book), you find no
major differences. Other features, such as Instant Messaging, might or might
not be supported by the network service provider. (See Chapter 9 for more
details on Instant Messaging.)
Just to keep the score card straight, when we talk about features available
from one network service provider that aren’t available from others, we point
that out.
Connecting to your personal computer
Nowadays, a personal computer is a household necessity. We spend so much
time on them, and so much information is stored in them. No surprise that
BlackBerry works hand-in-hand with your PC. The USB cable that comes 
with your BlackBerry does more than just charge your device. Part IV guides
you in making use of this important connection with the help of BlackBerry
Desktop Manager and all the utilities that come with it. You find discussions
in Chapter 16 on how to sync your device with the Personal Information
Manager data that you keep in your PC. Chapter 17 talks about installing new
Web servers

applications to your BlackBerry with the help of your PC. You can also read
Chapter 18 for directions on how to make the switch from another device
(even a non-BlackBerry device) to a new BlackBerry. For example, you find
out how to import your contact list into your new BlackBerry. Last, Chapter
19 guides you on how to back up almost anything in your BlackBerry.
Connecting to the Enterprise
Down, Trekkies! We’re not talking about hooking up with Captain Kirk. RIM’s
initial markets were enterprises and governments, and e-mail was the key to
RIM’s success. And yet, BlackBerry is so much more than simply e-mail capa-
bility, and enterprises and governments quickly figured that out. A company
that uses BlackBerry service has the option of integrating e-mail service, as
well as calendar service, to its own enterprise software: Microsoft Exchange,
Lotus Domino, or whatever. Such software likely existed on the company net-
work before it started using BlackBerry, so the company was already heavily
invested in it. RIM’s decision to enable integration of its service within the
framework of existing enterprise servers made good business sense.
BlackBerry Enterprise Server
To integrate corporate e-mails and calendaring, RIM provides a connector 
to its service to and from a corporate network. This software is BlackBerry
Enterprise Server (BES), which is the glue that connects the RIM network with
a corporate network. Using BES, a company can have full control over what
its employees can and cannot do with their devices. For example, a com-
pany’s BES administrator could opt to disable PIN-to-PIN (personal identifica-
tion number) messaging. This messaging system is supposedly more private
than sending messages between e-mail accounts because PIN messages are
sent directly from one device to another without going through a central cor-
porate server. (See Chapter 9 for more details about PIN-to-PIN messaging.) 
A company’s administrator can also enable or disable the downloading and
installation of applications to your device. Such control provides important
flexibility for a corporation when security is an integral part of day-to-day
operation.
One of the most important features of BlackBerry Enterprise Server is its
Mobile Data Service (MDS). MDS answers the challenge of extending corpo-
rate data within the corporate network without jeopardizing security. MDS
allows companies to make all BlackBerry browsers follow the existing con-
straints of Internet browsers inside a corporate network. For example, if the
firewalls on your corporate network prevent you from going to potentially
malicious sites, you’re not going to be able to use your BlackBerry browser
to go to said sites — the same rules apply, in other words. With MDS, your
BlackBerry can be considered part of your corporate network, following all
the rules that your network firewalls are set up to enforce.
13
Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is Not an Edible Fruit

Connecting wirelessly
From the get-go, e-mail is always connected to your e-mail server wirelessly.
Then comes calendaring, where your appointments are synchronized to your
company’s calendaring system. RIM did not stop there. Version 4.0 of BES is 
a leap forward for the BlackBerry platform. It supports wireless everything
sync, allowing you to sync all your PIM data (including notes, tasks, and
address book) wirelessly. Most of the utilities you found on the desktop side
can now be accomplished wirelessly.
Connecting through a desktop computer
In addition to the wireless side of BlackBerry, there’s the wired side of con-
necting to enterprise data. The same utilities and functions that are available
to you if you have a personal device are available to you when you have a
BlackBerry from your company. But there’s more in version 4.0 of your
device’s OS and version 4.0 of BES. RIM deployed Handheld Manager for the
desktop. This application allows the device to use the network connection in
your PC for any communication to the BES. If your device is connected to
your company’s PC and Handheld Manager is running, e-mails do not go
through the phone provider’s network. They go straight from your e-mail
server to the BES server and to your device.
Doing the BlackBerry world-traveler thing
If you received your BlackBerry from T-Mobile or Cingular, chances are that
your BlackBerry will continue to work when you travel to, say, London or
Beijing. All you need to worry about is turning on your BlackBerry (and maybe
the extra roaming charges). Because your BlackBerry is quad band, it will
work in more than 90 countries. What is quad band? Basically different cell-
phone networks in different countries operate in different frequencies. For
example, the United States operates 850 and 1900 MHz; Canada operates 850
and 1900 MHz; and Europe and Asia Pacific operate 900 and 1800 MHz. Your
BlackBerry is designed to work in 850 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 1900
MHz, so you are covered no matter where you go — well, almost. Check with
your network service provider before you hop on a plane, just to be sure.
Two dominant technologies compete in the worldwide cellphone industry
today:
 Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA): This is available in the United
States through Verizon Wireless.
 Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM): This is a tad older
than its CDMA rival.
14
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

Nothing stands still in this world, and this saying is proven by the fact that
GSM has spawned Global Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Enhanced Data
rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), next-generation technologies that have been
growing in popularity because they work on the same GSM phone infrastruc-
ture. This combo GSM/EDGE is available in the U.S. through most of the
major network service providers. As you might have guessed, GSM/EDGE
competes in the marketplace against CDMA.
Why is this a factor? Or to put this more bluntly, what’s it to you? Well, because
CDMA and GSM/EDGE aren’t compatible — which is what happens when you
have competing technologies going for all the marbles in the marketplace —
your phone works on only one technology. When you travel outside North
America, you face the burning question: “CDMA or GSM/EDGE?” (The
nonacronym version of this question is “Will my BlackBerry work on this 
country’s network or won’t it?”) If you currently work with GSM/EDGE, you
should be okay because most non-North American countries are on GSM/EDGE
networks. If you’re a CDMA kind of person, you might have some “issues,” as
they say. When in doubt, talk to your network service provider.
Oh, the Things You Can Do!
Always-connected e-mail is still what makes BlackBerry very attractive and 
is likely first in the long list of reasons why you got your BlackBerry in the
first place. And, if you need to go global, you can use your BlackBerry in
more than 90 countries. Just hop off your flight, turn on your BlackBerry, 
and voilà: You can receive and send e-mails whether you are in Hong Kong,
London, Paris, or New York. Your significant other can get in touch with you
wherever you are — just to say hi or to remind you that you promised Aunt
Edna a case of Chanel No. 5. (One caveat here — you need to make sure that
your network service provider has the technology to go global. See the pre-
ceding section, “Doing the BlackBerry world-traveler thing,” for more info.)
Generally speaking, you can receive and send e-mails just like you do when
you’re home.
Although e-mail is BlackBerry’s strength, that’s not the only thing it can do.
This section goes beyond e-mail to point out some of the other major benefits
you can get from your device.
All-in-one multimedia center
Previously, many consumers were hesitant about purchasing a BlackBerry 
due to the lack of multimedia functions such as a camera and audio and video
playback. The BlackBerry Pearl changed all that and has more features than
the typical consumer expected. Not only does the Pearl have a high-resolution
camera, 1.3 mega-pixels to be exact, but it also has a memory slot for a
15
Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is Not an Edible Fruit

microSD chip (see Chapter 2). Since the BlackBerry Pearl, RIM has added the
multimedia features (except the camera, which isn’t part of the 8800 model) to
all BlackBerry models, including the BlackBerry Curve. What does that mean?
Well, it means that your BlackBerry can function as an mp3 player, a portal
video player, a portable flash drive, and your personal photo collection. It’s
like having an iPod and then some. Can your iPod do the following?
Internet at your fingertips
Yup, you can browse the Web with your BlackBerry. Even better, you can 
continue chatting with your friends through Instant Messenger, just as if you
never left your desktop computer. You can also get up-to-the-minute informa-
tion when you want it, when you need it. Just imagine getting an alert when
your stock is tanking. True, that’s not a good thing to happen, but this is
information you want as fast as possible.
If you’re not into stocks, how about getting sports and weather information?
Or maybe traffic alerts? Say you want to know the best restaurants in town
for that special evening — birthday, anniversary, or first date. Many services
that are available on the Internet are also available to you on your
BlackBerry.
Intrigued? Your questions about how your BlackBerry can take advantage of
the Web are answered in due time (in Chapter 10, to be precise).
Me and my great personal assistant
You might be saying, “But I’m really a busy person, and I don’t have time to
browse the Web. What I do need is an assistant to help me better organize my
day-to-day tasks.” If you can afford one, by all means go ahead and hire a per-
sonal assistant. If not, the next best thing is a personal digital assistant (PDA).
Many PDAs are on the market, and the most popular ones are those marketed
by Palm and WinCE. Getting a PDA can be a big help — and mucho less
expensive than hiring a secretary.
So, are we telling you to go out and buy a PDA? No way! Put away that credit
card because you don’t need to go that route. Whip out that BlackBerry of
yours and take a closer look. That’s right, your BlackBerry is also a full-fledged
PDA, able to help you remember all your acquaintances (see Chapter 4),
manage your appointments (Chapter 5), keep a to-do list (Chapter 6), and
much more.
In Chapters 4–7, you can read up on all the tricks and tips for managing your
life by using your BlackBerry. Heck, we even show you how BlackBerry
16
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

Calendar can be wirelessly synced with Outlook Calendar (Chapter 5). Talk
about an informational cornucopia!
A computer in the palm of your hand
A remarkable communication device? Check. A full-fledged PDA? Check. A
BlackBerry is a pretty sophisticated product, but what we’ve described so 
far is just the tip of the iceberg. Don’t underestimate the device because of 
its size: Your BlackBerry is also a powerful computer.
Need convincing? Here goes. Out of the box, it comes with a great set of orga-
nizational as well as productivity tools. These tools are programs developed
by RIM to run on this device’s firmware (its operating system, or OS). You can
find out more about these tools in the rest of the book: Chapter 5 talks about
managing your appointments; Chapter 6 details how to keep track of your
tasks and keep your password safe in a central location; Chapter 7 guides you
in using your BlackBerry for taking notes and making calculations. In Chapter
9, you also find more on messaging tools for enhanced collaborations. With
the growing popularity of the device, software developers outside of RIM are
taking advantage of this growing market — which means hundreds of applica-
tions are now out there for you to download.
Download? Absolutely! BlackBerry supports the downloading of applications
through BlackBerry Browser. And of course, it’s wireless (see Chapter 10).
For example, you can download more productivity tools such as spreadsheet
applications or applications to view and edit office documents written in
Word or other word processing programs. The number of BlackBerry applica-
tions is growing — and growing fast.
To be honest, there’s no way to foresee how many applications will be on the
market when this book is published. And the price of an application varies,
depending on how sophisticated the program is, so we can’t really give firm
numbers. But if you’re curious, check out Chapter 16 and the Part of Tens,
where we describe some of the best business applications out there. You
should be able to find some treasures suited to your field of work.
Does all this talk about productivity tools make your eyes glaze over? Well, “All
work and no play” does something or other, so we have no qualms about shift-
ing toward the more fun topics, such as games. BlackBerry comes out of the
box supplied with a number of games, but you should look upon these merely
as appetizers (or at least the free candy that gets you wanting more). If you do
find yourself wanting more, go to the candy store — that is, the Web — to find
an infinite variety of games designed for your BlackBerry. Chapter 22 highlights
some of the more fun games out there, all available for downloading.

Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is Not an Edible Fruit

Look Dad, no hands!
Your BlackBerry is equipped with an earphone that doubles as a mike for
hands-free talking. This accessory is your doctor’s prescription for prevent-
ing the stiff neck that comes from wedging your BlackBerry against your ear
with your shoulder. At the very minimum, it helps free your hands so you can
eat Chinese takeout. And, if you happen to be a New York resident, you’re
required by law to use an earphone while driving when you use a cellphone.
(Not that we recommend using your cellphone while driving, but if you really
need to make that call, going hands free is better and safer.)
But RIM didn’t stop with just your standard (wired) earphones. BlackBerry
also supports cool, new wireless earphones/mikes — the ones based on
Bluetooth technology. “But how could a bizarrely colored tooth help me
here?” you might ask. Fooled you! Bluetooth is the name for a (very) short-
distance wireless technology first used to connect simple devices such as
computer accessories, but now becoming more common on cellphones,
specifically wireless earphones/mikes. See Chapter 11 for how to connect
your BlackBerry to a Bluetooth headset.
Final BlackBerry Tidbits!
The main concerns most of us have when buying a product are quality and
reliability. Will the product last? Will it perform as the flier says? Will I regret
having bought this item six months down the road? This section looks at
some of the hardware features that make buying the BlackBerry device a 
wise purchase.
Power efficiency
Now, anyone who has had an ear to the ground regarding BlackBerry knows
its reputation as a highly efficient little machine when it comes to power con-
sumption. If you had the old 6000 series, you know that the device could run
for two weeks without recharging. At the onset, RIM designed its devices to
consume power effectively.
With the addition of colored and high-resolution screens, the much-vaunted
power efficiency has gone down somewhat, especially with newer models
such as the 8800 series that features a GPS. Power requirements on these
devices have increased to such an extent that you need to recharge roughly
every two to three days. Realizing that this is a bit of a hassle, we offer a sec-
tion in Chapter 3 where we spell out some tips on prolonging the life of your
battery, especially when you’re traveling.

Memory management
We know that memory is the last thing on people’s minds when they buy a
BlackBerry. Not many know the role ample memory plays for a device because
you definitely have ample free memory on your device when you first receive
it. The thing is, though, that this memory does not grow as you use the
BlackBerry. You’re stuck with a fixed amount of memory, which can prove lim-
iting over time. As you install more and more applications, this free memory
gets used up. In fact, you could eventually run out of memory altogether.
Does your device die when you run out of memory? No, thank goodness.
Your BlackBerry is capable of monitoring free memory. If your BlackBerry is
ever in danger of reaching the upper limits, it has a memory management
program that cleans house to free this limited resource.
BlackBerry applications right out of the box are capable of figuring out what
data just isn’t that important. For example, BlackBerry Browser caches data
to enhance your experience when browsing the Web. Caches use local copies
of Web pages to speed up the reloading of previously visited Web sites, so
they are generally good things to have around. However, this cache also takes
up space. When the OS tells Browser that the device is reaching its upper
memory limit and it needs to do some housecleaning, Browser deletes this
cache. This is also true for Message, which deletes e-mails you’ve already
read, starting from the oldest and working its way backward.
Curious about how much available space your device has? Using your track-
ball, scroll to highlight the options (wrench) icon on the BlackBerry Home
screen, and then press the trackball. Scroll through the list and click Status.
On the Status screen, File Free tells you how much space is available.
A sentry is always on duty
Throughout the history of human existence, we’ve seen some nasty things
that human beings are capable of doing. Unfortunately, the virtual world is
not exempt; in fact, every day a battle is fought between those who are trying
to attack a system and those who are trying to protect it. Included among
those attacking the system are those who are trying to steal corporate data
for their advantage, as well as individuals trying to steal personal data to
carry out identity theft.
A computer connected to the Internet faces an extra risk of being hacked or
becoming infected by a computer virus intent on simply annoying the heck
out of you or (even worse) wreaking havoc on your computer. Fortunately,
security is one of the strong points of the BlackBerry. RIM has features 
built into its software that allow companies to curtail activities for their
19
Chapter 1: Your BlackBerry Is Not an Edible Fruit

BlackBerry users that they deem risky, such as installing or running a third-
party application. Data transmitted on and from the device is encrypted 
so that possible snooping is prevented. RIM also has a Signature process 
for application developers, which forces developers to identify themselves
and their programs if they are developing any applications running on the
BlackBerry platform that need to integrate with either BlackBerry core appli-
cations or the OS.
Remember the I love you and Anna Kournikova viruses? These are virtual evils
transmitted through e-mail, a script, or sets of instructions in the e-mail body
or attachment that can be executed either by the host e-mail program or, in
the case of an attachment, by the program associated with the attached file.
Fortunately, BlackBerry’s Messages does not support scripting languages. 
As for attachments, out of the box, BlackBerry supports very few file types,
mostly images and text documents. BlackBerry’s viewer for such files doesn’t
support scripting either, so you won’t be facing threats from e-mails having
these attachments.
The security measures RIM implemented on the BlackBerry platform have
gained the trust of the U.S. government as well as many of the Forbes Top 500
enterprises in the financial and health industries.

 Understanding general navigating guidelines
R
egardless of whether you previously owned a BlackBerry or not, you
might have heard that the new BlackBerry is totally different. You might
be asking, how do you spot a new BlackBerry? Looks aren’t deceiving in this
case. From the outside, the new BlackBerry is a lot slimmer than the older
BlackBerry handhelds. It has a brighter and higher resolution screen. But
what makes it fundamentally different is the fact that it has a trackball.
What? No more trackwheel? Where is the trackball? What can you do with it?
How can you navigate your BlackBerry better with the trackball? Those are
some of the questions that we answer in this chapter. Bear with us and you
will be master of your BlackBerry in no time.
Anatomy 101: The Body and 
Features of Your BlackBerry
In this section, we show you all the keys and features on your BlackBerry.
The three models are shown in Figures 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3.

First, the major features:
 Display screen: The graphical user interface (GUI) on your BlackBerry.
 QWERTY keyboard: The input for your BlackBerry, very 
straightforward.
 SureType keyboard: The input for your BlackBerry Pearl. We cover how
to type with the SureType keyboard.
 Escape key: This key is used to cancel a selection or return to a previ-
ous page within an application. If you hold it down, it returns you to the
Home screen from any program.
 Menu key: This key displays the full menu of the application you are
using.
 Trackball: You navigate the display screen of your BlackBerry with the
trackball. It allows you four directional movements. When you press the
trackball, the short menu of the application you are using appears.

 Convenience keys: Depending on the BlackBerry model you have, you
have one or two convenience keys. By default, the convenience keys are
preprogrammed to open an application. In Chapter 3, we show you how
to reprogram the convenience keys so they display the programs you
use the most.
 microSD slot: Although it is hidden inside your BlackBerry and can be
revealed only by removing the battery, the microSD slot is a crucial ele-
ment to your BlackBerry media experience.
 Send key: Because your BlackBerry can also function as a cellular phone,
this key allows you to go straight to the Phone application, regardless of
which application you are currently using. When you are already in the
Phone application, the send key starts dialing the number you entered.
 End key: While on a phone call, use this key to end your call. If not on a
phone call, this key allows you to jump straight back to the Home
screen, from wherever you are.
 Power key: Press and hold the Power key to turn your BlackBerry on or
off. On the 8800, pressing Power also turns on extra backlight. This key
is very useful when you’re in direct sunlight.
 Mute key: Mutes a call when on a call.
If you owned an older BlackBerry (one with a trackwheel), the menu key basi-
cally replaces the trackwheel click. With the new BlackBerry, you can also
click the trackball to confirm selection choices.
Two types of context menus can appear on your BlackBerry, as shown in
Figure 2-4.
 Full menu: This menu lists all the options and features you can perform
(Figure 2-4, left).
 Short menu: This is an abbreviated list of the full menu list (Figure 2-4,
right).

Display screen
When you first turn on your BlackBerry, the display screen displays the
Home screen, which is your introduction to the graphical user interface (GUI)
of your BlackBerry. The different icons represent the different applications
found in your BlackBerry. See Figure 2-5 for examples of what your Home
screen might look like.
Depending on the theme you’re using, you might see your applications listed
in text form rather than as icons. Remember that how your GUI looks
depends on how you want it to look because the font and theme are cus-
tomizable. For more on personalizing your BlackBerry, see Chapter 3.
QWERTY keyboard
For those non-BlackBerry Pearl owners, this section is for you.
Unlike some PDA manufacturers out there — they know who they are — RIM
chose as the input method for the BlackBerry the same QWERTY keyboard
you know and love from your personal computer. We think that was a great
decision because it means that we don’t have to master some new way of
writing — graffiti or whatever — to get data into our BlackBerry. All we have
to do is type on a keyboard — and we already know how to do that.
Whether you use your pinky or your index finger, how you type on your
BlackBerry is up to you. However, most people find that typing with two
thumbs is the most efficient way to type on a BlackBerry.

Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry

SureType keyboard
If you have the BlackBerry Pearl, this section is for you. The Pearl doesn’t
have a full QWERTY keyboard; rather, it works with a QWERTY-based key-
board known as the SureType keyboard. The idea here is that many keys
share letters (refer to Figure 2-2 to see how this looks) and that the SureType
technology is smart enough to find what key combinations come up with the
words you want. Basically, with SureType, you can now type with only one
thumb, and your BlackBerry Pearl learns the words that you frequently use.
Here are tips to speed up the learning curve when using SureType technology:
 Always finish typing a word before correcting it. This way, SureType
learns what you want to type next time.
 If SureType gets the word you’re typing right on the first try, simply
use the Space key to move on instead of clicking the trackball or
pressing enter.
 Take advantage of Custom Wordlist, which is a list of words that you
define. More on this later in this section.
 Type! Type! Type! Because SureType learns how you type, the more
you use it, the smarter it becomes in adapting to your style.
SureType versus multitap
On your Pearl, you can type in another mode: multitap. The regular way — at
least we think of it as the regular way — is the multitap approach. The best
way to explain multitap is by example: Say you want to type an h character
on the Pearl. You search out the h on your keyboard but then notice to your
dismay that the h shares a key with the letter g. What’s a person to do? Do
you really want to go through life writing GHello for Hello?
Actually, there’s a perfectly easy solution to your problem. To get the letter g,
you tap the GH key once. To get the letter h — the second letter in the key’s
pair — you tap the key twice — hence, the term multitap.
What about SureType? When you are in SureType mode, your Pearl tries to
help you do the communication thing by figuring out what word you are
typing. For example, if you want to type the word hi, you start by pressing
the GH key and then the UI key. Doing so prompts SureType to display a list
of words it thinks might be what you’re aiming for, as shown in Figure 2-6. If
the first listed word is what you want, simply press the Space key. The word
is automatically selected, and you can continue to type. If what you really
wanted to type appears a little later in the list, simply scroll to it by using the
trackball and press the trackball to select it. Over time, SureType learns the
words you’re most likely to use and sticks those at the front of the list. Yup,
that’s right — it gets smarter the more you use it.
26
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

Custom Wordlist
SureType keeps all the words it has learned in a safe place — a Wordlist, to
be precise. It turns out that you can review your SureType Wordlist — and
even add to it — using the Custom Wordlist option. (Using this option to add
words or proper names to the list means that SureType doesn’t have to learn
them when you are in the act of typing.)
To see or add words by using the Custom Wordlist option, follow these steps:
1. From the Home screen, press the menu key and then select the
options (wrench) icon.
2. Select Custom Wordlist.
This opens Custom Wordlist. This is where you can see all the words
that SureType has learned. (If you purchased your BlackBerry recently,
there might be only a few words or even no words in this list, depending
on how often you’ve used SureType mode to type.)
3. From within Custom Wordlist, press the menu key and then select New.
Doing so brings up a dialog box prompting you to type in a new word, as
shown in Figure 2-7.
4. To save your changes, press the menu key and then select Save.

Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry

Getting people’s names right is tough with SureType, but thankfully, you can
make sure that SureType automatically learns all the names in Address Book
as follows:
1. From the Home screen, press the menu key and then select the
options icon.
2. Select Language.
You now see the Language option screen, where the handy Input Option
button makes its home.
3. Scroll to the Input Option button and select it.
This displays the Fast Options screen with the following options:
• Frequency Learning: If turned on, the word used most frequently
appears first in the SureType Wordlist while you type.
• Auto Word Learning: If turned on, SureType learns as you type.
• Use Address Book as Data Source: If turned on, SureType learns all
the names in your Address Book.
4. Make sure the Use Address Book as Data Source option is turned on.
If it isn’t, scroll to this field, press the trackball, and then select On from
the drop-down list.
5. To save your changes, press the menu key and then select Save.
Escape key
Simple yet useful, the escape key allows you to return to a previous screen or
cancel a selection. The escape key is the arrow key to the right of the trackball.
Trackball
You can perform two functions with the trackball: scrolling and pressing
down. When you scroll with your trackball, you can navigate the display
screen in four directions. In a text-filled screen such as the body of an e-mail,
you can usually navigate through the text in four directions.
Depending on where you are on the BlackBerry’s screen, different situations
determine what happens when you press the trackball, also called the trackball
click:
28
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

 Display a drop-down list: When you are in a choice field, pressing the
trackball displays a drop-down list of choices for that field.
 Confirm a choice: The trackball can also function as a confirmation key.
For example, when you need to select a choice in a drop-down list, you
can press the trackball to confirm the highlighted choice.
 Display a short menu: When you are in a text-filled screen (e-mail body
or Web page), pressing the trackball displays a short menu (refer to
Figure 2-4, right), which is just an abbreviated version of the full menu.
You get the full menu by pressing the menu key.
Menu key
The menu key brings up the full menu for the application you are using.
When you are on the Home screen, pressing the menu key displays a list of
applications installed on your BlackBerry. If you want to change the order of
the applications in the list, see Chapter 3.
The behavior of the menu key when you are on the Home screen depends on
the BlackBerry theme. The behavior just described is based on the default
theme. See Chapter 3 for more on changing themes.
The microSD slot
Your BlackBerry comes with some internal memory, 64MB to be exact, but a
good chunk of that is taken up by applications that came with your BlackBerry.
If you are a music or video fan, you know that 64MB is not going to hold any-
thing entertaining. But no need to worry. The folks at Research in Motion have
incorporated a microSD slot into your BlackBerry so you can add extended
memory and store all the media files you want in your BlackBerry.
You can purchase a microSD card separately for a relatively low price these
days. At the time of this writing, a 2GB microSD card costs $25.
To insert a microSD card, remove your battery cover and then remove your
battery. At this point, you can open the microSD door and insert your
microSD card, and then close the microSD door. Figure 2-8 shows the slot on
the BlackBerry Pearl and Figure 2-9 shows the one on the BlackBerry.

General Navigation Guidelines
In the cheat sheet at the front of the book, as well as throughout the book, we
show you shortcuts that are applications specific. In this section, however,
we go over general shortcuts and navigation guidelines. On a Web page or an
e-mail full of text, you can perform the following tasks:
 Move to the top of the page: Press the t key.
 Move to the top of the bottom of the page: Press the b key.
 Move to the top of the next page: Press the Space key.
 Select a line: Press and hold the Shift key and scroll the trackball 
horizontally.
 Select multiple lines: Press and hold the Shift key and scroll the trackball
vertically.
 Copy selected text: Press and hold the Shift key and press the trackball.
 Cut selected text: Press and hold the Shift key and press the delete key.
 Paste text: Press and hold the Shift key and press the trackball.
 Insert an accented character: Hold down a letter key and scroll the
trackball.
 Insert a symbol: Press the Sym key and press the letter below the
symbol.
 Cap lock: Press the Alt and right Shift keys.
 Num lock: Press the Alt and left Shift keys.
Here are the keys for the BlackBerry Pearl:
 Num lock: Press Shift and Alt.
 Move to the top of the page: Press the ER key.
 Move to the top of the bottom of the page: Press the CV key.
 Move to the next page: Press the M or Space key.
 Move to the previous page: Press the UI key.
 Move to the next line: Press the BN key.
 Move to the previous line: Press the TY key.
 Switch between multitap and SureType mode: When typing in a text
field, press and hold the * key.
31
Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry

Switching applications
When you are navigating in an application, an option called Switch Application
appears when you press the menu key. Switch Application, which is similar 
to Alt+Tab under Windows, lets you multitask between applications (see
Figure 2-10).
Another way to switch applications is to press the Alt and escape keys. (The
Alt key is located to the left of the Z key, and the escape key is the arrow key
to the right of the trackball.)
If you always use a particular application, such as the Tasks application, you
can program the convenience key so you can get to your favorite application
even more quickly than by using the Switch Application function.
Changing options
Throughout this book, you see examples of an options field being changed to
a different value. The easiest way to change the value in a field is to first use
the trackball to scroll to the field. Then press the trackball to display a drop-
down list of choices (see Figure 2-11), and finally press the trackball again on
your choice.

General Keyboard Shortcuts
If you have a BlackBerry Pearl, this section does not apply to you. All the
shortcuts described here are for QWERTY-based BlackBerry models only.
In many instances in this book, when we ask you to go to a BlackBerry applica-
tion (Profile, for example), you have to first scroll to it from the Home screen and
then click the trackball. You might be thinking “Hey, there must be a shortcut for
this,” and you’re right. This section covers such general keyboard shortcuts, all
in the name of making your life easier. (Shortcuts that are more application spe-
cific are covered in the chapter dealing with the particular application.)
Before you get all excited about shortcuts, there’s one bit of housekeeping
you need to take care of. To use some of these general keyboard shortcuts,
you first have to make sure that the Dial from Home Screen setting — buried
deep within the Phone application — is turned off.
Enquiring minds want to know, so we’ll tell you. The Dial from Home Screen
option is designed for users who make frequent BlackBerry phone calls. If
you are not a frequent phone user and want to access all applications with a
press of a button, get ready to ditch Dial from Home Screen:
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, highlight the Phone application
and then press the trackball.
2. Press the menu key and then select the options icon.
A screen listing a range of options appears.
3. Select General Options.
The General Options screen appears.
4. Highlight the Dial from Home Screen field and then select No.
Doing so shuts down the Dial from Home Screen option, enabling you to
use Home screen shortcuts.
5. To confirm your changes, press the trackball and then select Save
from the menu that appears.
33
Chapter 2: Navigating the BlackBerry
Other Pearl shortcuts
 Switch between current profile and vibrat-
ing profile: From the Home screen, press
and hold the # key. If you don’t know what a
profile is, refer to Chapter 3.
 Key lock your Pearl: From the Home screen,
press and hold the * key.

If you’re a frequent phone user on your BlackBerry, as opposed to an e-mail
or Internet user, you might not want to turn off the Dial from Home Screen
feature.
Using Home screen shortcuts
After you disable the Dial from Home Screen feature, you are free to use any
Home screen shortcut. (The name for these shortcuts is actually a pretty
good fit because you can use these shortcuts only while you are on the Home
screen.)
Okay, here goes. To call up the application listed in the first column of Table
2-1, press the key listed in the table’s second column.

Other (non-Home screen) shortcuts
The following shortcuts can be used at any time, regardless of which screen
you’re currently in — or whether you have Dial from Home Screen enabled,
for that matter:
 Device Reset (also known as the 3-Button Salute): Pressing
Alt+cap+Del forces a manual reset, which is just what you need when
your BlackBerry has crashed or when you install an application and it
needs a manual reset. You can achieve the same result by pulling out the
battery from the back of the BlackBerry.
 HelpME: In the BlackBerry world, SOS is actually spelled Alt+cap+H. Use
it when you’re on the phone with technical support. (It gives them info
such as your BlackBerry PIN, memory space, and BlackBerry version
number so they have information about your BlackBerry when they try
to troubleshoot your problems.)
Note: Your BlackBerry PIN isn’t a security password; rather, it is a unique
number that identifies your BlackBerry, sort of like a serial number. But
unlike a serial number, you can message another BlackBerry by using
PIN-to-PIN messages. For more on PIN-to-PIN messages, please see

egardless of how long you’ve had your BlackBerry — one week, one
month, one year, or five years — you’ll want to have it around for as
long as you possibly can. (Or, at least until you have the bucks for that 
way-cool new model that’s surely coming down the pike.) And, for the 
duration that you do have your device, you’ll want to trick it out so that 
your BlackBerry doesn’t feel and sound exactly like the millions of other
BlackBerry devices out there. (C’mon, admit it — your BlackBerry is defi-
nitely a fashion statement, so you better feel comfortable with what that
statement is saying.)
In addition to customizing your BlackBerry so that it expresses the inner you,
you want to make sure that you keep your BlackBerry in tip-top shape by
watching out for things such as your BlackBerry battery life and information
security. Luckily for you, this chapter puts any and all such worries to rest by
filling you in on all you need to know to keep your BlackBerry a finely tuned
(and yet quirkily personal) little PDA.
Making Your BlackBerry Yours
BlackBerry devices are increasingly popular, so much so that close to eight
million BlackBerries are out there serving the needs of people like you.
Because of this fact, we’re certain that finding ways to distinguish your
BlackBerry from your colleagues’ BlackBerries is high on your list of priorities.

Your wish is our command. Follow the tips and techniques outlined in this
section and you, too, can have your very own personalized BlackBerry.
Color-code your Pearl
This little section is for BlackBerry Pearl only. Ever wonder whether you can
change the color of the trackball to your color? Well, now you can. A free util-
ity program called ColorPearl allows you to change the color of the trackball.
You can download the ColorPearl application by pointing your BlackBerry
browser to http://www.geekandproud.net/blackberry/colorpearl/
colorpearl.jad. Follow the on-screen downloading instructions. After
installation, follow these steps on your Pearl:
1. Press the menu key (the key to the left of the trackball), scroll to the
options (wrench) icon, and then press the trackball.
2. Select ColorPearl.
The ColorPearl configuration screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.
3. Highlight the Color field and select your favorite color.
4. Press the menu key and then select Save.
You should now see the color of your trackball changed. Sweet!
Branding your BlackBerry
Like any number of other electronic gadgets that you could possibly own,
your BlackBerry comes to you off the shelf fitted with a collection of white-
bread factory settings. This section helps you put your name on your
BlackBerry, both figuratively and literally. You can start by branding your
name on your BlackBerry:

the Information field.
The idea here is to phrase a message (like the one shown in Figure 3-2)
that would make sense to any possible Good Samaritan who might find
your lost BlackBerry and want to get it back to you.
If you lock or don’t use your BlackBerry for a while, the standby screen
comes on, displaying the owner information that you entered. Read how
to lock your BlackBerry, either manually or by using an auto setting, as
described in the later section, “Keeping Your BlackBerry Safe.”
4. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackball and then choosing
Save from the menu that appears.
Choose a language, any language
Branding your BlackBerry with your own John Hancock is a good start, but
setting the language to your native tongue so you don’t need to hire a transla-
tor to use your BlackBerry is equally important — and equally easy. You can
also set your input method of choice here, which can affect whether AutoText
shows up. Don’t worry. We explain what that means in the next section.
Here’s how you choose a language:
1. Press the menu key, scroll to the options (wrench) icon, and then
press the trackball.
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find the Language setting
and then press the trackball.
Here you can choose the language and input method of your choice.
Figure 3-2:

3. Select the Language field and then scroll the drop-down menu to
select your native tongue.
Depending on your network provider, as well as what region (North
America, Europe, and so on) you’re in, the language choices you have
vary. Most handhelds sold in North America default to English or English
(United States).
If your network provider supports it, you can install more languages into
your BlackBerry by using Application Loader in BlackBerry Desktop
Manager. For more information on Application Loader, please see
Chapter 17.
4. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackball and then choosing
Save.
Isn’t it great when you can actually read what’s on the screen? But don’t
think that you’re finished quite yet. You still have some personalizing 
to do.
Typing with ease using AutoText
Even the most devoted BlackBerry user has to admit that typing on a full 
keyboard is easier than thumb-typing on a BlackBerry. In an attempt to even
the score a bit, your BlackBerry comes equipped with an AutoText feature,
which is a kind of shorthand that can cut down on how much you have to
type. Even if you have the BlackBerry Pearl with SureType technology, you
can still benefit by using the AutoText feature. (For more on SureType tech-
nology, see Chapter 2.)
AutoText basically works with a pool of abbreviations that you set up — 
you then just type an abbreviation to get the word you associated with 
that abbreviation. For example, after setting up b/c as an AutoText word for
because, anytime you type b/c, you automatically get because on-screen.
The whole AutoText thing works only if you set up your own personal code,
mapping your abbreviations to their meanings. (This is why we’re discussing
AutoText as part of our personalization discussion.) To set up your own
code, do the following:
1. From the Home screen, press the menu key, scroll to the options icon,
and then press the trackball.
2. Scroll to the AutoText option, and then press the trackball.
Here, you can choose to see (or search for) existing AutoText words or
create new ones.
3. Press the menu key, scroll to New, and then press the trackball.
The AutoText screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-3.
40
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

4. In the Replace field, enter the characters that you want to replace (in
this example, b/c). In the With field, type what replaces your charac-
ters (in this example, because).
5. In the Using field, choose between the SmartCase and Specified Case
options.
• SmartCase capitalizes the first letter when the context calls for
that, such as the first word in a sentence.
• Specified Case replaces your AutoText with the exact text found in
the With field.
For example, say you have the AutoText bbg set up for the term
blackberryGoodies.com, and you want it to appear as is, in terms of letter
cases (the first b is not capitalized). If you were to choose SmartCase for
this particular AutoText, it would be capitalized as the first word in a
sentence, which is not what you want. On the other hand, if you use
Specified Case, your AutoText always appears as blackberryGoodies.com
no matter where it is in the sentence.
6. Scroll to the Language field and then select All Locales from the list 
of options.
Our preference for this setting for any self-created AutoText is All
Locales. What this means is that regardless of the language input
method (for example, English UK or English US or French), any self-
created AutoText is available for you to use. So, in the case of the
AutoText bbg (blackberryGoodies.com), whether you are typing in
French or Chinese, you can use this AutoText. On the other hand, if you
select only the French input method for bbg as the Language field, you
would be able to use this only if your input method is set to French in
the Language option.
You can choose the input method of your choice in the Language
options. We go over choosing a language input method next.
7. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackball and then choosing Save.
Figure 3-3:
Create
AutoText
here.
41
Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry — and Keeping It Happy

If you specify a language input method other than All Locales, your input
method setting in the Language option must match the Language field in Auto
Text to use your newly created AutoText:
1. Press the menu key, scroll to the options icon, and then press the
trackball.
2. Scroll through the list of options until you find the Language setting,
and then press the trackball.
Here you can choose the language and input method.
3. Select the Input Method field and then select the input method you
need from the list.
For your new AutoText setting to work (assuming that you didn’t choose
All Locales as the language for your AutoText), this option needs to
match the input method set in your Language option.
4. Confirm your changes by pressing the trackball and then choosing Save.
Inserting macros
If you frequently give out your BlackBerry phone number or PIN in e-mails,
you’ll appreciate macros. Basically, you can use the AutoText feature to add a
customized word for preset items — things such as your BlackBerry number,
PIN, or just the date — so you don’t have to type them all the time.
Keep in mind that we’re talking about your BlackBerry PIN here — your
device’s unique identifying number — and not the PIN someone would use to
empty out your checking account with the help of one of those automated
tellers. For more on BlackBerry PINs, see Chapter 9.
To add a macro for your phone number, for example, first call up the
AutoText screen. (AutoText is an option in Options.) Type an appropriate
word in the Replace field (mynum would work nicely), scroll to the With
field, press the menu key, and then select Insert Macro. You’re prompted 
with a popup to select from a list of preset items; be sure to select the Phone
Number (%p) option.
After saving your setting, you can test your AutoText by drafting a simple e-mail.
Getting your dates and times lined up
Having the correct date, time, and time zone is important when it comes to
your BlackBerry for, we hope, obvious reasons. Many of the fine features that
make up the BlackBerry core experience, as it were, depend on the time,
date, and time zone being accurate.
42
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

Need an example? How about your BlackBerry calendar events? Imagine, if
you will, that you have set up a make-or-break meeting for 9 a.m. (in your
time zone) with a client in Paris, France, which is in who-knows-what time
zone. You definitely want to be on time for that appointment, but you proba-
bly won’t be if you’re planning on your BlackBerry to remind you — that is, if
you haven’t set up the appropriate date, time, and time zone. So go ahead
and do the necessary things.
1. Press the menu key, scroll to the options icon, and then press the
trackball.
2. Scroll to the Date/Time setting and then press the trackball.
The Date/Time screen appears.
3. Scroll to your time zone and press the trackball.
The Date/Time screen confirms the time zone that you chose.
4. Scroll to the Time field and use the trackball to adjust the proper hour
and minutes.
5. Scroll to the Date field and use the trackball to adjust the date 
appropriately.
6. Scroll to the Date/Time Source field and press the trackball.
This sets your date and time source to your service provider’s server
time. See Figure 3-4.
7. To confirm your changes, press the menu key and then select Save.
Doing so saves your date and time settings in perpetuity — a really long
time, in other words.
You may know that the United States Congress changed the daylight saving
time (DST) in 2007. If you got your BlackBerry around March 2007, you can
check to see whether your DST is updated. From the Home screen, go to
Options. On the very top, you should see 2007 DST Patch. Why do you care?
Well, if your BlackBerry hasn’t been updated, the next time the DST changes,
there is a good chance that you will be either an hour behind or an hour
ahead of all your appointments. Yep, not good.

Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry — and Keeping It Happy

Customizing your screen’s look and feel
Right up there with making sure that your date and time settings are accurate
is getting the display font, font size, and screen contrast to your liking. Now we
know that some of you don’t give a hoot if your fonts are Batang or Bookman
as long as you can read the text, but we also know that some of you won’t stop
configuring the fonts until you get them absolutely right. For all you tweakers
out there, here’s how you play around with your BlackBerry’s fonts:
1. Press the menu key, scroll to the options icon, and then press the
trackball.
2. Scroll to the Screen/Keyboard setting and then press the trackball.
The Screen/Keyboard screen appears with various customizable fields,
as shown in Figure 3-5.
3. Highlight the Font Family field and then select a font from the drop-
down list.
You can choose from three to ten fonts, depending on your provider.
4. Continuing down the Screen/Keyboard screen, highlight the Font Size
field, and then select a font size.
One thing to keep in mind is that the smaller the font size, the more you
can see on-screen; however, a smallish font is harder on the eyes.
Note: As you scroll up and down the list of fonts and font sizes, notice
that the text “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” in the back-
ground takes on the look of the selected font and size so that you can
preview what the particular text looks like.
5. Confirm your changes by pressing the menu key and choosing Save.
Figure 3-5:

Keyboard

Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

Similar to setting Font Size, you can also play with Font Style to set it to Bold,
Italic, or None. At this point, you are probably wondering what Antialias
Mode is for. Think of antialias as a way your BlackBerry renders alphabet
characters. With No Antialiasing set, your fonts will have round edges. With
Antialiasing set, you fonts will have sharp edges. The difference between the
two settings is subtle.
With fonts out of the way, it’s time to change the brightness of your screen 
as well as a few other viewing options, including how to program the conve-
nience key to exactly what is convenient to you:
1. Press the menu key, scroll to the options icon, and then press the
trackball.
2. Scroll to the Screen/Keyboard setting and then press the trackball.
The Screen/Keyboard screen appears with its various customizable
fields. (Refer to Figure 3-5.)
3. Highlight the Backlight Brightness field and then select the desired
brightness from the drop-down list.
You can choose from 0 to 100, where 0 is the darkest and 100 is the
brightest.
4. Highlight the Side Convenience Key Opens field and then select what
you want your left side key to open when you press it.
If you have a BlackBerry Pearl, you see Left Side and Right Side
Convenience Key options. Perform Step 4 for both the left and right 
side convenience keys.
5. Select the Backlight Timeout field, press the trackball, and choose 
the amount of time for the backlight timeout.
You can choose from ten seconds up to two minutes. The lower this set-
ting, the less time you’ll have backlighting (after you press each key).
However, a low setting helps you conserve battery life.
When you’re outdoors with a bright sun on your BlackBerry, you’ll prob-
ably have difficulty reading your BlackBerry screen. Press and quickly
release the Power button (on the top-left corner of your BlackBerry).
This brightens your BlackBerry screen so you can see it even under a
bright sun.
6. Highlight the Trackball Horizontal Sensitivity field and then select
how sensitive you want the trackball to be horizontally.
You can choose from 20 to 100, where 20 is the least sensitive and 100 is
the most sensitive.
45
Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry — and Keeping It Happy

7. Highlight the Trackball Vertical Sensitivity field and then select how
sensitive you want the trackball to be vertically.
Again, 20 is the least sensitive and 100 is the most sensitive. Keep in
mind that if your trackball is too sensitive, it will be hard to control.
8. To confirm your changes, press the menu key and select Save.
Choosing themes for your BlackBerry
Your BlackBerry is preloaded with different themes, which are predefined
sets of looks (wallpaper, fonts, menu layout) for your BlackBerry. You can
download themes from BlackBerry’s mobile Web site.
Regardless of what BlackBerry model you have, follow these steps to change
your theme:
1. Press the menu key and then select the options icon.
2. Select the Theme setting.
You see a list of available themes.
3. Scroll to and select the theme you want.
You see a preview of the theme you’ve selected. See Figure 3-6.
4. Press the menu key and then select Activate.
You should be able to see the change immediately.
You can download other themes. Just remember that you have to use your
BlackBerry, not your PC, to access the following URLs:
 http://mobile.blackberry.com
 http://blackberrywallpaper.com
Figure 3-6:

Wallpaper for your BlackBerry
Like your desktop PC, you can customize the BlackBerry Home screen with
personalized wallpaper. You set an image to be your BlackBerry Home screen
background by using the BlackBerry Media application:
1. From the Home screen, press the menu key and then select the Media
application.
This opens the Media application, where you see different categories:
Music, Video, Ringtones, and Pictures.
2. Scroll to and select the Picture category.
Doing so brings up two folders: The Preloaded Media folder stores pic-
tures that came with your BlackBerry, and the Device Memory folder
stores pictures that you took with your camera.
3. Scroll to and select one of the folders.
This lists all the pictures in the folder.
4. Select the picture you want to use for your Home screen background.
The selected picture appears in full-screen view.
5. Press the menu key and then select Set as Home Screen Image.
The picture is now your new Home screen wallpaper.
6. Press and hold the escape key (to the right of the trackball) to return
to the Home screen and see the result.
You can download free wallpaper here (as long as you use your BlackBerry,
not your PC, to access the URLs):
 http://mobile.blackberry.com
 www.blackberrywallpapers.com
 www.blackberrygoodies.com/bb/wallpapers
After you have your BlackBerry’s look and feel just the way you want, there’s
just one thing left to do before you can move on. You need to get your
BlackBerry to sound the way you want it to.
Let freedom ring
The whole appeal of the BlackBerry phenomenon is the idea that this little
electronic device can make your life easier. One of the ways it accomplishes
this is by acting as your personal reminder service — letting you know when
an appointment is coming up, a phone call is coming in, an e-mail has arrived,
47
Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry — and Keeping It Happy

and so on. Basically, your BlackBerry is set to bark at you if it knows some-
thing it thinks you should know too. Figure 3-7 lists the kinds of things your
BlackBerry considers bark-worthy, ranging from browser alerts to Tasks
deadlines.
Different people react differently to different sounds. Some BlackBerry barks
would be greatly appreciated by certain segments of the population, whereas
other segments might react to the same sound by pitching their BlackBerry
under the nearest bus. The folks at Research In Motion are well aware of this
fact and have devised a great way for you to customize how you want your
BlackBerry to bark at you — they call it your profile.
You can jump right into things by using a predefined profile, or you can
create your own profile. The upcoming sections take a look at both
approaches.
Whether you create your own profile or customize a predefined profile, each
profile is divided into seven categories that represent the application for
which you can define alerts:
 Browser: Alerts you when you receive a new channel push, which is just
a Web page sent to your BlackBerry.
 Calendar: Alerts you when you have upcoming appointments.
 Level1 Messages (urgent e-mail messages): Alerts you with a special
tone when you have an urgent e-mail. What’s considered an urgent mes-
sage? E-mail can be defined as urgent by your sender. Also, a BlackBerry
PIN-to-PIN message can be considered urgent. For more on PIN-to-PIN,
please see Chapter 9.
 Messages: Alerts you when a new e-mail message is in your inbox.
 Phone: Alerts you if there is an incoming call or a new voice mail.
 SMS: Alerts you when you have an SMS message.
 Tasks: Alerts you of an upcoming to-do deadline.
Figure 3-7:

Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

You can personalize all the listed applications according to how you want to
be alerted. Because the way you customize them is similar, we use one appli-
cation, Messages, as an example in the text that follows, as we customize a
predefined profile that comes with your BlackBerry.
After this, we go over creating a profile from scratch. You might be wonder-
ing: Why do I need to create a profile if I can personalize the predefined ones?
Well, for those of you who like to keep the predefined settings the way they
are, creating a profile is the way to go.
Using factory settings
If you’re okay with customizing a predefined, factory-loaded profile, just do
the following:
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select the Profile application.
A popup screen appears, listing different profiles (quiet, vibrate, normal).
2. Scroll to the end of the list and select Advance.
A screen appears listing different profiles.
3. Scroll to the Normal profile in the list, press the menu key, and then
select Edit.
The Normal screen appears, listing the applications with alert capabili-
ties that we mention in the preceding section. (Refer to Figure 3-7.)
4. Select the Messages [Email] application.
You’re faced with the Messages for Normal profile, which is divided into
an Out of Holster section and an In Holster section, as shown in Figure 3-8.
A holster (in this context) is simply the belt clip or case that houses your
BlackBerry while you’re not using it. BlackBerry is smart enough to know
when it is in a holster.
5. Highlight the Out of Holster field and then select a tone from the
drop-down list of alert options.
Doing so enables sound in the Out of Holster mode.
Figure 3-8:
Choose a
tone to 
alert you
when your

holster.
49
Chapter 3: Turning On Your BlackBerry — and Keeping It Happy

6. Highlight the Tune field and then select the tune you like from the
drop-down list.
As you scroll through the tunes and pause, BlackBerry plays the tune so
you know what it sounds like before you change it.
7. Press the menu key and then select Save.
As you might have guessed from how Messages in the Normal profile is
divided, your BlackBerry can notify you in different ways based on whether
your BlackBerry is in plain view (Out of Holster) or tucked away next to your
belt (In Holster). To set up a different sound for In Holster mode, just put the
necessary info in the fields for the In Holster section — and be sure to choose
a different tune this time. (Choosing the same tune kind of defeats the pur-
pose, doesn’t it?)
As we mention, you can do the same to personalize other applications listed
in each profile.
If you’re like us and you get more than 200 e-mails daily, you probably don’t
want your BlackBerry sounding off 200 times a day. What you can do is set up
your BlackBerry so that it notifies you only if an e-mail has been marked as
urgent, requiring your immediate attention. You can do this by setting the
notification for your Messages application to None for both In Holster and
Out of Holster. Then in the Level1 Messages option (refer to Figure 3-7), you
can set your desired notification for both In Holster and Out of Holster. That
way, you have conveniently filtered out any unnecessary e-mail notifications,
leaving just the urgent stuff to sound off to you.
Creating your own profile
You need to know which applications on your BlackBerry have alert capabili-
ties because you can then personalize each “Hey, you!” to your liking. You can
have your BlackBerry so personalized that you can tell whether you have a
phone call or an incoming message just by how your BlackBerry sounds.
If you’re already familiar with the different applications and are clear how
you want each one to alert you, go on and create your own profile. As we
mention before, you can achieve the same result by personalizing the prede-
fined profiles that come with your BlackBerry. But if you are one of those who
like to keep the predefined profiles the way they are, go ahead and create a
new profile:
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select the Profile application.
A popup screen appears, listing different profiles (quiet, vibrate, normal).
2. Scroll to the end of the list and select Advance.
A screen appears listing different profiles.
50
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

3. Press the menu key and then select New, as shown in Figure 3-9.
A new Profiles screen appears, prompting you to name your profile.
4. In the Name field, enter a name for your profile.
For this example, just type My Profile.
5. Configure your new profile.
Refer to Steps 3 and 4 of the “Using factory settings” section to cus-
tomize each one of the seven applications.
6. Press the menu key and then select Save.
Your newly created Profile appears listed in the Profiles screen.
7. Select My Profile, as shown in Figure 3-10.
Doing so allows you to start using your newly created profile.
Regardless of whether the ring tone is for an incoming call or an incoming
e-mail, you can download more ring tones to personalize your BlackBerry.
Also, you can use any mp3 files in your Media application as your personal-
ized ring tone:
1. From the Home screen, press the menu key and then select the Media
application.
This opens the Media application, where you see different categories:
Music, Video, Ringtones, and Pictures.

2. Select the Music category.
Doing so brings up folders named Preloaded Media and Device Memory.
If you have microSD card inserted, you also see the Media Card folder.
3. Select one of the folders.
This lists all the music in this folder.
4. Highlight the music file you want to use for your ring tone.
5. Press the menu key and then select Set as Phone Tune.
This sets the music file as your new phone tune.
6. Press and hold the escape key (to the right of the trackball) to return
to the Home screen.
You can also download free ring tones at mobile.blackberry.com — just
be sure to call up this URL with your BlackBerry, not your PC.
Keeping Your BlackBerry Safe
The folks at Research In Motion take security seriously, and so should you.
Always set up a password on your BlackBerry. If your BlackBerry hasn’t
prompted you to set up a password, you should immediately do so. Here’s
how it’s done:
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select the options (wrench) icon.
2. Select Security Option.
3. Select General Settings.
4. Highlight the Password field and then select Enabled.
All this does for now is enable the Password feature. You won’t be
prompted to type a password until you save the changes you just made.
5. Press the menu key and then select Save.
At this time, you should be prompted for a password, as shown in 
Figure 3-11.
6. Type a password, and then type it again for verification.
From this point on, whenever you lock your BlackBerry and want to use
it again, you have to type the password. How to lock your BlackBerry?
Good question. Keep reading.
52
Part I: Meet and Greet Your BlackBerry 

Remember that when you set your password on a BlackBerry Pearl, make
sure you know what letter your password is and not just which key you
pressed. You need the same password if you link your BlackBerry with
BlackBerry Desktop Manager for synchronization. For more on BlackBerry
Desktop Manager, refer to Chapters 17–20.
Setting up your password is a good first step, but just having a password
won’t help much if you don’t take the further step of locking your BlackBerry
when you’re not using it. (You don’t want people at the office or sitting at the
next table at the coffee shop checking out your e-mails or phone history
when you take a bathroom break, do you?) So, how do you lock your
BlackBerry? Let us count the ways . . . we came up with two.
You can go the Autolock After Timeout (also known as Security Timeout) route:
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select the options icon.
2. Select the Security option.
The Security screen appears.
3. Highlight the Security Timeout field and then select the desired minutes.
The preset times range from 1 minute to 1 hour.
4. Press the menu key and then select Save.
If you’re more the hands-on kind of person, you can go the Manual Lockout
route by scrolling to the keyboard lock icon on your Home screen and press-
ing the trackball. (Pressing K while at the Home screen does the same thing.
Make sure you turn off the Dial from Home Screen option. See Chapter 2 for
more info on using Home screen shortcuts.)
To lock a Pearl model, just press the asterisk (*) key.
No matter what route you take to lock your Blackberry, you use your (newly
created) password to unlock it when you get back from wherever you’ve been.

Getting Organized
with Your
BlackBerry

In this part . . .
T
his part covers how to use your BlackBerry to its
fullest to get you — and keep you — organized.
Peruse the chapters here to find out how to use your
Address Book, keep appointments, keep on track with 
to-do lists, and make notes.

Chapter 4
Remembering Your Acquaintances
In This Chapter
 Exploring BlackBerry Address Book
 Adding, viewing, editing, and deleting contacts
 Finding a contact in Address Book
 Organizing Address Book
 Sharing BlackBerry contacts
 Transferring contacts from cellphones to your BlackBerry
T
he idea of an address book was around long before the BlackBerry was
conceived. Address Book on the BlackBerry serves the same function as
any address book: It is an organizational tool that gives you a place to record
information about people. This tool gives you a central place from which you
can retrieve information so that you can reach your contacts by phone, cell-
phone, e-mail, snail-mail or the speedy messaging of PIN, SMS, MMS, or
BlackBerry Messenger. Depending on the type of work you do, an address
book is likely an essential tool, and your BlackBerry is there at the ready.
You can benefit from using your BlackBerry Address Book if any of the follow-
ing fits you and your lifestyle:
 Do you travel?
 Do you meet clients frequently?
 Do you spend a lot of time on the phone?
 Do you ask people for their phone number or e-mail address more 
than once?
 Do you carry around the old-fashioned paper day planner with a section
allocated for recording contacts? Or do you write phone numbers of
acquaintances on the back of business cards?
 Is your wallet or purse full of these “important” business cards, but you
can never seem to find the ones you need when you need them?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, you need an address book.
Regardless of how you keep your contact information, it’s time to get down to
business and organize your contacts by using your BlackBerry. In this chapter,
we show you how to make your BlackBerry a handy, timesaving tool for manag-
ing your contacts’ information. Specifically, you find out how to add, change,
and delete contacts as well as how to locate them later. You’ll also be amazed
at how well Address Book is integrated with all the other BlackBerry features
you’ve come to know and love — phoning contacts, adding invites to your
meetings, adding contacts to BlackBerry Messenger, and composing e-mails.
If you’re one of those um, stubborn, folks who insist that they don’t need an
address book — “I’m doing just fine without one, thank you very much!” —
think of it this way. You’ve been using a virtual address book all the time —
the one buried inside your cellphone. And that address book often isn’t even
a very good one! When you’re ready to join the rest of us in this millennium,
read this chapter to see how to transfer all that good contact info from an old
phone into your new BlackBerry-based Address Book.
Accessing Your Address Book
The good people at Research In Motion make it easy for you to distinguish
Address Book. Start by taking a look at the BlackBerry Home screen. The
Address Book icon looks like an old-fashioned Rolodex. (Remember those?) If
you have a hard time locating it, Figure 4-1 shows what it looks like in both
BlackBerry incarnations. (For more about the BlackBerry models and their
differences, check out the Introduction.) To describe Address Book in this
chapter and for most of the illustrations throughout this book, we use the

Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Opening Address Book couldn’t be simpler:
1. Use the trackball to highlight the Address Book icon.
2. Click the trackball.
Alternatively, you can press enter.
Your BlackBerry Address Book is accessible from a number of applications,
including Phone, Messages, and Calendar. For example, say you’re in Calendar
and you want to invite people to one of your meetings or appointments. Look
no further — Address Book is in the menu, ready to lend a helping hand.
You can also get to Address Book by pressing A while at the Home screen. Go
to Chapter 3 for more on Home screen shortcuts.
Working with Address Book Names
Getting a new gizmo is always exciting because you just know that your
newest toy is chock-full of features you’re dying to try out. Imagine having a
new BlackBerry, for example. The first thing you’ll want to do is try to call or
e-mail someone, right? But wait a sec. You don’t have any contact information
yet, which means you’re going to have to type in someone’s e-mail address
each time you send an e-mail — what a hassle.
Time to get with the plan. Most of us humans — social creatures that we are —
maintain a list of contacts somewhere, whether in an e-mail program such as
Outlook or Lotus Notes, in an old cellphone, or maybe on a piece of paper kept
tucked away in a wallet. We’re pretty sure you have some kind of list some-
where. The trick is getting that list into your BlackBerry device so that you can
access the info more efficiently. The good news for you is that the “getting con-
tact info into your BlackBerry device” trick isn’t a hard one to master. Stick
with us, and you’ll have it down pat by the end of this chapter.
Often the simplest way to get contact information into your BlackBerry is to
enter it manually. However, if you’ve invested a lot of time and energy in main-
taining some type of address book application on your desktop computer, you
might want to hot sync that data into your BlackBerry. (For more on synchro-
nizing data, check Chapter 16. It gives you details on how to synchronize some
of your desktop application data — the address book, e-mail, appointments,
and memos stuff.) You can also transfer your old cellphone contacts into your
BlackBerry. Intrigued? Then check out the “Transferring Contacts from
Cellphones” section, later in this chapter. Do you have an address book in
another PDA, such as a PalmPilot or a PocketPC? No problem. Most of these
devices allow you to sync to a desktop computer application such as Outlook.
But this is not a book about other PDAs, so please refer to your other device’s
instructions on how to sync it to your desktop. After the data is in the desktop,
you can check Chapter 16 for details on synchronizing it to your BlackBerry.

Chapter 4: Remembering Your Acquaintances

Creating a contact
Imagine you’ve just run into Jane Doe, an old high school friend you haven’t
seen in years. Jane is about to give you her number, but you don’t have a pen
or pencil handy to write down her information. Are you then forced to chant
her phone number to yourself until you can scare up a writing implement?
Not if you have your handy BlackBerry device on you.
With BlackBerry in hand, follow these steps to create a new contact:
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select the Address Book application.
Address Book opens. You can also access Address Book from different
applications. For example, check Chapter 8 on how to access Address
Book from Messages.
2. Press the menu key and then select New Address.
The New Address screen appears, as shown in Figure 4-2.
3. Scroll through the various fields, stopping and entering the contact
information that you feel is appropriate.
Use your BlackBerry keyboard to enter this information. For an overview
of the different keyboard types, see Chapter 2. Note, however, that all
BlackBerry keyboards look (and work) alike. When entering an e-mail
address, press the Space key to insert an at symbol (@) or a period (.).
We don’t think you can overdo it when entering a person’s contact infor-
mation. You should strive to enter as much info as you possibly can.
Maybe the benefit won’t be obvious now, but in the future when your
memory fails you or your boss needs a critical piece of info that you just
so happen to have at the ready, you’ll thank us for this advice.
To create another new blank e-mail field for the same contact, press the
menu key and then select Add Email Address. You can have up to three
e-mail addresses per contact.
Figure 4-2:
Create 
a new
contact
here.
60
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

If a contact has an extension for his or her phone number, no problem.
When calling such a contact from your BlackBerry, you can instruct
BlackBerry to dial the extension after the initial phone number. When
entering the phone number into the New Address or Edit Address
screen, type the primary phone number, press the trackball, select Add
Pause from the menu that appears, and then add the extension number.
4. When you finish entering the contact information, press the trackball
and then select Save.
At this point, you should see your Jane Doe added to the list, as shown
in Figure 4-3.
The menu is always available through the menu key, but just for convenience
we prefer to use the trackball when a menu is available through it. Also, when
a menu is available through a press of a trackball, it’s always a shortened
menu list. The application is smart enough to figure out which menu items to
display based on where you are.
Taking notes
The Notes field in the New Address screen (you might need to scroll down a
bit to see it) is useful for adding a unique description about your contact. For
example, use the field to jog or refresh your memory with tidbits such as
Knows somebody at ABC Corporation or Can provide introduction to a Broadway
agent. Or perhaps your note is something personal, such as Likes golf; has 2
children: boy, 7 & girl, 3; husband’s name is Ray. It’s up to you. Again, the more
useful the information, the better it will serve you.
Adding your own fields
Perhaps your contact information doesn’t fit into any of the available fields.
Although you can’t really create additional fields from scratch, you can com-
mandeer one of the User fields for your own purposes.
Figure 4-3:
The
Address
Book
screen after
adding 
Jane Doe.
61
Chapter 4: Remembering Your Acquaintances

The User fields are located at the bottom of the screen; you have to scroll
down to see them. Basically, you can use these fields any way you want (which
is great), and you can even change the field’s name. (Face it, User field is not
that helpful as a descriptive title.) For example, you can rename User fields to
capture suffixes (such as MD, PhD, and so on). Or how about profession, birth-
date, hobbies, school, or nickname? When it comes down to it, you decide
what information is important to you.
Keep in mind, though, that changing the field name for this particular contact
changes it for all your contacts.
To rename a User field:
1. Scroll to the bottom of the screen to navigate to one of the User fields.
2. Press the menu key and then select Change Field Name.
Note: The Change Field Name selection on the menu appears only if the
cursor is in a User field.
3. Use the keyboard to enter the new User field name.
4. Press the trackball or the enter key to save.
You’re all set.
Adding a picture to a contact
Most phones these days have the ability to display a picture of the caller. And
BlackBerry is no stranger to this neat feature. For this to work, you need the
obvious first, a picture of your friend or acquaintance. After you have the pic-
ture in a digital format that your device supports, you can get it to your
BlackBerry through e-mail or copy it to the microSD card. There’s not a
chance we’ll leave you helpless if you don’t know how to get media to that
microSD; Chapter13 is your gateway to media satisfaction.
After a picture is inside the BlackBerry, adding it to one of your contacts is a
snap:
1. On a contact’s Edit Screen, press the menu key and then select Add
Picture (see Figure 4-4).
Figure 4-4:
Add a
picture
here.
62
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

2. Use the trackball to navigate to the drive and folder containing the
picture.
You can use multiple locations for storing media files such as pictures.
Chapter 13 gives you the scoop.
3. Select the picture you want.
The picture you choose is displayed in full on the screen.
4. Press the trackball and then select Crop and Save.
You’re all set. All you need to do is save this contact to keep your changes.
5. Press the menu key and select Save.
Assigning a tone
Oh no, you’ve been awakened with your BlackBerry ringing in your night-
stand. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could tell who’s calling? Ring tones help you
decide whether to ignore the call or get up. Hopefully, you can easily switch
to sleep mode if you decide to ignore.
Follow these steps to assign a ring tone to one of your contacts:
1. Press the trackball and then select Add Custom Phone Tune from the
menu (refer to Figure 4-4).
2. Press the trackball.
A list of tones is displayed for you to choose. You can also select Browse
to navigate to the drive and folder containing the tone. You can use mul-
tiple locations for storing media files such as tones. Chapter 13 gives
you the scoop.
3. Select the tone you want.
The tone appears in the Custom Phone Tune field. To save these
changes, all you need to do is save this contact.
4. Press the menu key and select Save.
Adding contacts from other 
BlackBerry applications
When you receive an e-mail message or get a call from someone, you have
contact information in Messages or Phone. (RIM makes this easy for you
because Messages and Phone can recognize phone numbers or e-mail
addresses and then highlight that information for a quick cut and paste.)
Maybe that info isn’t complete, but you definitely have at least an e-mail
address or a phone number. Now, if you’re pretty sure you’ll be correspond-
ing with this person and he or she isn’t yet listed in your Address Book, it’s
just logical that you’d want to add the information.
63
Chapter 4: Remembering Your Acquaintances

If you have a sharp eye, you might have noticed that Phone lists only outgo-
ing numbers. That’s half of what you need. Oddly enough, you can access the
history of incoming phone calls inside Messages. In Messages, press the
trackball and click View Folder on the menu that appears. Scroll and click
Phone Call Logs.
Like e-mail, a call log entry stays in the list as long as you have free space in
your BlackBerry. This could mean months or years depending on your model
and usage. When BlackBerry runs out of space, it starts reclaiming space a
chunk at a time by deleting read e-mails and phone call logs, starting from the
oldest.
When you have an e-mail or a phone log open, just scroll to an e-mail address
or a phone number and press the trackball while that piece of information is
highlighted. An Add to Address Book option pops up on the menu. (This par-
ticular menu item is located at the bottom of the list, so you might have to
scroll to see it.) Select Add to Address Book, and a new New Address screen
appears, prefilled with that particular piece of information. All you need to do
now is enter the rest of the information you know about the person, and it’s
ready to be saved to Address Book. This is just one more sign of BlackBerry’s
ongoing attempt to make your life easier.
Viewing a contact
Okay, you just entered your friend Jane’s name into your BlackBerry, but you
have this nagging thought that you typed the wrong phone number. You want
to quickly view Jane’s information. Here’s how you do it:
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select the Address Book application.
Address Book opens.
2. Scroll to and highlight the contact name you want and then press the
trackball.
Pressing the trackball or the enter key while a name is highlighted is the
same as opening the menu and choosing View — just quicker.
View mode displays only information that’s been filled in, as shown in
Figure 4-5. (It doesn’t bother showing fields in which you haven’t
entered anything.)
Editing a contact
Change is an inevitable part of life. Given that fact, your contact information
is sure to change as well. If you want to keep the information you diligently
put in your Address Book current, you’re going to have to do some updating
now and then.
64
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

To update a contact, follow these steps:
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Address Book.
Address Book opens.
2. Scroll to and highlight a contact name, press the menu key, and then
select Edit.
The Edit Address screen for the contact name you selected makes an
appearance.
In Address Book (or any BlackBerry application, for that matter), 
displaying a menu involves a simple press of the menu key. You see 
the Edit option in the menu right below View.
3. Scroll through the various fields of the Edit Address screen, editing
the contact information as you see fit.
If you want to replace only a few words or letters located in the middle
of a field (instead of replacing all the text) scroll the trackball while
pressing and holding the Alt key (located to the left of the Z key) to posi-
tion your cursor precisely on the text you want to change. Then make
your desired changes.
4. Press the menu key and then select Save.
The edit you made for this contact is saved.
When you’re editing information and you want to totally replace the entry
with a new one, it’s much faster to first clear the contents, especially if the
old data is long. When you are in an editable field (as opposed to a selectable
field), just press the menu key and then select Clear Field. This feature is
available in all text-entry fields and for most BlackBerry applications.
Deleting a contact
When it’s time to eradicate somebody’s contact information in your Address
Book (whether its a case of duplication or a bit of bad blood — yes, we admit
to have occasionally stricken somebody from our Address Books in a fit of
pique), the BlackBerry OS makes it easy to delete a contact.
Figure 4-5:
View mode
for a
contact.
65
Chapter 4: Remembering Your Acquaintances

Here’s how:
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Address Book.
Address Book opens.
2. Scroll to and highlight a contact name you want to delete, press the
menu key, and then select Delete.
(If you don’t initially see the Delete option, scroll down to the bottom part
of the screen.) A confirmation screen appears, as shown in Figure 4-6.
3. On the confirmation screen, select Delete.
The contact you selected is deleted and disappears from your contact list.
Sometimes dealing with the confirmation screen can be a pain if you want to
delete several contacts in a row. If you are 100 percent sure that you want to
ditch a number of contacts, you can suspend the Confirmation feature by set-
ting the Confirm Delete option to No in the Address Book Options screen.
Check the “Setting preferences” section later in this chapter for more on
Address Book Options.
Transferring Contacts from Cellphones
Suppose you have an old cellphone that has served you well for many years.
Most likely you’ve accumulated contacts on that phone by painstakingly
typing them each time in the past. You’d really like to have the same contacts
on your BlackBerry as you have on your cellphone, but you just cannot bear
the thought of typing them all again. You think to yourself, “There has to be a
way.” Good news: You’re right, there is.

Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Copying contacts from a SIM card
We’ve copied contacts from Nokia, Ericsson, Motorola, and Samsung cell-
phones — and in theory, our method should also work on other phones. The
trick is to use the SIM card as an external storage device — sort of like a floppy
disk. What exactly is a SIM card? The acronym stands for Subscriber Identity
Module. The non-head-scratching definition describes an electronic chip that is
capable of storing information such as your phone numbers and Address Book.
Basically, you store your old phone’s contact list on the SIM card, insert that
SIM card into your BlackBerry, and then upload the contacts from your SIM
card. (For all the gory details, check out the steps later in this section.)
This sounds easy to do, but it might be tricky depending on the type of phone
you have. A caveat: You can do this only on a GSM phone. (GSM is short for
Global System for Mobile Communications, probably the most popular stan-
dard for mobile phones in the world.) To tell whether you have a GSM phone,
first check whether you have a SIM card. To do that, take out the battery of
your cellphone. Behind it, you should see a SIM card, looking (we hope) like
the one you see in Figure 4-7. If you don’t, your phone is not a GSM phone.
If your cellphone is a GSM phone and you’re determined to forge ahead and
transfer your cellphone contact info to your BlackBerry, we’re here to help.
Obviously, we can’t give instructions for all the types of phones out there. For
the purpose of showing you what’s what, we assume that you want to transfer
the address book on a Nokia 7210 phone to your BlackBerry. (Why the Nokia
7210? That’s the one the dartboard told us to use.) We also have instructions
for other phones on the Web site associated with this book, so feel free to get
online and check whether your particular phone is covered there.
No more digressions! If you want to know the steps for copying contacts from
a Nokia phone to a BlackBerry by using a SIM card, here they are:
1. Take out the SIM card buried inside your BlackBerry and put it in the
Nokia phone.
Figure 4-7:
Transfer
phone info
from your
cellphone
with a

67
Chapter 4: Remembering Your Acquaintances

Most people are uncomfortable doing this, but taking out a SIM card and
putting it back in is no big deal. The SIM card is usually behind the bat-
tery, so you have to slide or take off the back cover of the phone to get to
it. On the BlackBerry, the back cover has a groove where you can put your
thumb and push the cover out. A Nokia phone has a simple locking mech-
anism — a notch that protrudes in the back of the phone — which you
slide to take off the back cover. When the cover is off, remove the battery
and you can see the SIM card. Slide the SIM card’s plastic enclosure; it
should pop open. You can then remove the SIM card from the enclosure.
Because this step requires you to remove the batteries from both your
BlackBerry and your Nokia phone, both devices are gong to power off
(obviously).
We’re going to resuscitate both, starting with the Nokia. After you put
the phone’s battery on the Nokia phone, it resets, and you should see
the display come up.
2. On the Nokia phone, press the top of the rightmost top button.
A Phone Book menu appears, as shown in Figure 4-8. Note the Copy
menu item.
There is no trackball for scrolling and selecting, but you can use the top
middle button with the arrow pointing up and the button below it with the
arrow pointing down for scrolling. To select, press the leftmost top button.
3. Select Copy from the menu.
Another menu appears, displaying two options: From Phone to SIM Card
and From SIM Card to Phone.
4. Select From Phone to SIM Card from the menu.
5. Select All from the menu and then select Keep Original from the menu
that follows.
A confirmation screen appears.
6. Select OK to confirm the copy.
Your phone starts copying the contents of the Phone Book to the SIM
card. While it’s doing the copy, the screen displays a bar that moves
back and forth. If you have many contacts on your phone, this process
Figure 4-8:
The Nokia
7210 Phone
Book.
68
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

can take some time, so just be patient. When the contacts are loaded to
the SIM card, the screen displays the number of contacts that were
copied. You can proceed with the next step.
7. Take out the SIM card from the Nokia phone and put it back into your
BlackBerry.
Reinserting the SIM card resets your BlackBerry.
8. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Address Book.
Address Book opens.
9. In Address Book, press the menu key, and then select SIM Phone Book.
It might take some time to load the contacts from your SIM card; how
long depends on how many contacts you’ve saved to the card. (You’ll
see a progress bar on the screen.) After the contacts are loaded, they are
listed on the screen, and you can start browsing or copying them to
your Address Book.
The SIM Phone Book menu item is located toward the bottom of the
menu, as shown in Figure 4-9. Depending on your model, you might need
to scroll down to see it.
10. To copy a contact to Address Book, just highlight the contact, press
the menu key, and then select Add to Address Book.
Your contact has now found its way to the BlackBerry Address Book.
You can repeat this step for all the contacts you want copied. Although
this is a tedious process, it’s still a lot better than trying to type each
one on your BlackBerry.
Keep in mind that SIM cards do have a limited capacity. If all your contacts
don’t fit on the SIM card on your first try, here are two ways you can add left-
over contacts to your BlackBerry:
 One by one: If only one or two contacts are not included, you might be
better off just typing them into your BlackBerry.
Figure 4-9:
The
Address
Book menu
showing the
SIM Phone
Book option.
69
Chapter 4: Remembering Your Acquaintances

 In batches: If you have many more contacts left, you probably should try
doing multiple saves. The trouble here is that you have to figure out what
contact info was saved on your first try — which, of course, lets you know
what you still have to copy over. We recommend loading such contacts in
batches. To do that, first delete the names from the SIM card after they are
loaded onto your BlackBerry. (That gives you a clean slate.) Repeat Steps
3 and 4 from the preceding list, but when you get to Step 5, select One by
One from the menu rather than All. This allows you to select the remain-
ing contacts to copy to the SIM card one at a time, instead of copying the
whole shebang one more time. When the remaining contacts are in the
SIM card, you can copy the second batch of names and load them to your
BlackBerry by using the preceding steps. Repeat as needed.
Copying a contact to a SIM card
You can reverse the info-import process, too. That is, you can copy from your
BlackBerry Address Book to a cellphone. “Can this be done?” you implore. To
which we reply, “Why, certainly, with a little help from two BlackBerry experts.”
For, truth be told, this feature of Address Book is probably one of the most diffi-
cult tricks to figure out unless somebody shows you how it’s done:
1. Start by viewing the contact information.
Follow the steps in the “Viewing a contact” section, presented previ-
ously in the chapter.
2. On the view screen, scroll to a Phone Number field, press the menu
key, and then select Copy to SIM Phone Book.
The Copy to SIM Phone Book feature (see Figure 4-10) shows up only
when you position the cursor in a Phone Number field.
In versions prior to 3.8 of the BlackBerry OS, this step saves the entries
to the SIM card right away. However, in version 3.8 or later, a confirma-
tion screen shows up. It displays the phone book entry you want to add
to the SIM card. If you see this screen, proceed to Step 3 to continue
with the saving.
Figure 4-10:
Copy
BlackBerry
info to a
cellphone.
70
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

3. On the Phone Book Entry screen, press the menu key, and then select
Save.
This operation is a snap, and the screen immediately returns to the view
contact screen shown as a result of Step 1.
If your phone doesn’t recognize your BlackBerry SIM card, perhaps the phone
is locked. Phone providers do this all the time: They lock the phones to their
network, making it unusable in other networks. If this is the case, please call
your phone provider and ask for instructions on how to unlock your phone.
Copying Contacts from 
Desktop Applications
Most of us have desktop applications that we use to maintain our network —
you know, Microsoft Outlook, IBM Lotus Notes, or Novell GroupWise. A word
to the wise: You do not want to maintain two address books — one in your
BlackBerry and one on your desktop computer. That’s a recipe for disaster.
Luckily for you, RIM makes it easy to get your various address books —
BlackBerry, desktop, laptop, whatever — in sync. Your BlackBerry comes
with BlackBerry Desktop Manager (BDM), a collection of programs, one of
which is Intellisync. Intellisync allows you to sync between your device and
the PC software. It also allows you to set up and configure the behavior of the
program, including how the fields in the desktop version of Address Book
map to Address Book fields in your BlackBerry. But you’re not going to read
about it here. For that, check out Chapter 16, which has complete details on
how you can use the Intellisync feature of BlackBerry Desktop Manager to
synchronize with the applications in your device — including, of course, your
Address Book.
Looking for Someone?
Somehow — usually through a combination of typing skills and the shuttling
of data between various electronic devices — you’ve created a nice long list
of contacts in your Address Book. Nice enough, we suppose, but useless
unless you can find the phone number of Rufus T. Firefly at the drop of a hat.
That’s where the Find screen comes in. In fact, the first thing you see in
Address Book when you open it is the Find screen, as shown in Figure 4-11.
71
Chapter 4: Remembering Your Acquaintances

You can conveniently search through your contacts by following these steps:
1. In the Find field, enter the starting letters of the name you want to
search for.
Your search criterion is the name of the person. You could enter the last
name or first name or both. The list is usually sorted by first name and
then last name. As you type the letters, notice that the list starts shrink-
ing based on the matches on the letters that you enter. Figure 4-12 illus-
trates how this works.
2. Scroll and highlight the name from the list of matches.
If you have multiple matches, use the trackball to scroll through the list
to find the person’s name.
If you have a long list in your Address Book and you want to scroll down
a page at a time, just hold down the Alt key (it’s located to the left of the
Z key) and scroll. You get where you need to go a lot faster.
3. Press the menu key and select from the possible actions listed on the
menu that appears.
After you find the person you want, you can select from these options,
as shown in Figure 4-13:
• Email: Starts a new e-mail message. See Chapter 8 for more infor-
mation about e-mail.
Figure 4-12:

Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

• PIN: Starts a new PIN-to-PIN message, which is a messaging feature
unique to BlackBerry. With PIN-to-PIN, you can send someone who
has a BlackBerry a quick message. See Chapter 9 for more details
about PIN-to-PIN messaging.
• Call: Uses Phone to dial the number.
• SMS: Starts a new SMS message. SMS is short for Short Messaging
Service, which is used in cellphones. See Chapter 9 for more
details about SMS.
• Send to Messenger Contact: Adds this contact to your contacts list
in BlackBerry Messenger.
• MMS: Starts a new MMS message. MMS is short for Multimedia
Messaging Service, an evolution from SMS that supports voice and
video clips. See Chapter 9 for more details about MMS.
If you have a finger-fumble and press a letter key in error, press the escape
key (the arrow key to the right of the trackball) once to return to the original
list (the one showing all your contacts), or press the trackball once and
select View All.
If you think you’re hallucinating when you notice that sometimes the menu
item Email <contact name> or Call <contact name> appears on the
menu and sometimes not, just relax. There’s nothing wrong with your eyesight
or your mind. Address Book is smart enough to know when it’s appropriate to
show those menu options. If a contact has a phone number, Call <contact
name> and SMS <contact name> show up, and the same is true for e-mail
and the personal identification number (PIN). In fact, this list of actions is a
convenient way to find out whether you have particular information — a
phone number or an e-mail address — for a particular contact.
In a corporate environment, your BlackBerry Enterprise server administrator
might disable PIN-to-PIN messaging because it doesn’t go to the corporate
e-mail servers and, therefore, can’t be monitored. If this is the case, the menu
option PIN<contact name> won’t appear even though you entered PIN
information for your contacts. Note that you’ll still be able to receive a PIN-to-
PIN message, but you won’t be able to send one.

Chapter 4: Remembering Your Acquaintances

Organizing Your Contacts
You’ve been a diligent boy or girl by adding your contacts to your Address
Book, and your list has been growing at a pretty good clip. It now has all the
contact information for your business colleagues, clients, and (of course)
family, friends, and relatives. In fact, your Address Book has grown so much
that it holds hundreds of contacts, and you start to notice that it now takes
you more time to find somebody, especially when you can’t remember the
name right away and are trying to explore the list knowing that when you see
the name you’ll recognize it.
Imagine that you’ve just seen an old acquaintance, a sales rep for XYZ, Inc.,
and you want to greet the person by name. His name is on the tip of your
tongue, but you just can’t put your finger on it. However, if you saw his name
on a list, it would jump right out at you. The trouble is that your list has 300-
plus names, which would take you forever to scroll through — so long, in
fact, that the person would surely come right up to you in the meantime, and
you’d have to fake the fact that you can’t remember his name. (How embar-
rassing.) In this scenario, the tried-and-true Find feature wouldn’t be much
help. What you need is a smaller pool of names to search though so that you
can stumble across the needed name much more quickly.
This isn’t rocket science. You’re going to want to do one of the following:
 Organize your contacts into groups: Using groups (as every kinder-
garten teacher could tell you) is a way to arrange something (in your
case, contacts) to make them more manageable. How you arrange your
groups is up to you because the organizing principle should be based on
whatever makes sense (to you, at least) and fits the group you set up.
For example, you can place all your customer contacts within a Clients
group and family members and relatives in a Family group. Then instead
of searching for names of individuals within one humongous list, you
can search within a smaller, more manageable group.
 Set up your contacts so that you can use some kind of filter on them:
Another way to organize and streamline how your BlackBerry Address
Book lists your contacts is to use the Filter feature in combination with
BlackBerry’s Categories. (Categories is just another way that Address
Book helps you filter contacts.) Using the Filter feature narrows the
Address Book list to such an extent that you have to use only the track-
ball to scroll down and find your contact — no need to type search key-
words, in other words.
Whether you use the Group or Filter feature is up to you. You find out how to
use both methods in the next sections of this chapter.

Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Creating a group
A BlackBerry group in Address Book — as opposed to any other kind of
group you can imagine — is just a simple filter or category. In other words, a
group just arranges your contacts into subsets without affecting the content
of your contact entries. In Address Book itself, a group shows up in the con-
tact list just like any other contact. The only wrinkle here is that when you
select the group, the contacts associated with that group — and only the con-
tacts associated with that group — appear on-screen.
Need some help visualizing how this works? Go ahead and create a group, 
following these steps:
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Address Book.
Address Book opens.
2. Press the menu key and then select New Group.
A screen similar to that in Figure 4-14 appears. The top portion of the
screen is where you type the group name, and the bottom portion is
where you add your list of group members.
3. In the New Group field, enter the name of the group.
You can name the group anything, but for the sake of this example, go
ahead and name the group Friends. After entering the name of the group,
you’re ready to save it. But hold on a sec — you can’t save this group
until you associate a member to it. To satisfy such a hard-and-fast rule,
proceed to the next step to add a member.
4. Press the trackball and then select Add Member from the menu that
appears.
The main Address Book list shows up in all its glory, ready to be pilfered
for names to add to your new Group list.
Figure 4-14:

Chapter 4: Remembering Your Acquaintances

5. Select the contact you want to add to your new Group list, press the
trackball, and then select Continue from the menu that appears.
Everybody knows a Rob Kao, so go ahead and select him. You’ll notice
that doing so places Rob Kao in your Friends group list, as shown in
Figure 4-15. (Rob Kao, a coauthor of the book you’re holding in your
hands, is a very popular fellow.)
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 to add more friends to your list.
After you’re satisfied, save your group.
7. Press the trackball and then select Save Group from the menu that
appears.
Your Friends group is duly saved, and you can now see Friends on your
main Address Book list.
Using the Filter feature on your contacts
Are you a left brainer or a right brainer? Yankees fan or Red Sox fan? An Innie
or an Outie? Dividing up the world into categories is something everybody
does (no divisions there), so it should come as no surprise that BlackBerry
divides your contacts into distinct categories as well.
By default, two categories are already set for you on the BlackBerry: the
Business category and the Personal category. But why stop at two? BlackBerry
makes it easy to create more categories. In this section, you first find out how
to categorize a contact, and then you see how to filter your Address Book list.
Finally, you find out how to create categories.
Categorize your contacts
Whether you’re creating a contact or editing an existing contact, you can 
categorize a particular contact as long as you’re in Edit mode.
If the trick is getting into Edit mode, it’s a pretty simple trick. Here’s how
that’s done:
Figure 4-15:
Your new

76
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Address Book.
Address Book opens.
2. Highlight the contact, press the menu key, and then select Edit.
Address Book is now in Edit mode for this particular contact, which is
exactly where you want to be.
3. Press the menu key and then select Categories.
A Categories list appears, as shown in Figure 4-16. By default, you see
only the Business and the Personal categories.
4. Press the Space key or the trackball to select the check box next to
Personal.
5. Press the menu key and then select Save.
You are brought back to the Edit screen for this particular contact.
6. To complete your changes, press the trackball and then select Save
(again) from the menu that appears.
You now have one — count ’em, one — contact with Personal as its category,
which means you can filter your Address Book list by using a category. 
Here’s how:
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Address Book.
2. Press the menu key and then select Filter.
Your Categories list makes an appearance. If you haven’t added any 
categories in the meantime, all you see here are the default Business 
and Personal categories.
3. Press the Space key or the trackball to select the Personal check box.
Your Address Book list shrinks to just the contacts assigned to the
Personal category, as shown in Figure 4-17.
Figure 4-16:
Default
categories.
77
Chapter 4: Remembering Your Acquaintances

As you add more contacts to a category, you can also use Find and enter the
first few letters of the name to further narrow the search for a contact. If you
need a refresher on how Find works, see the “Looking for Someone?” section,
earlier in this chapter.
Adding a category
Whoever thought the default categories — Business and Personal — were
enough for the complexities of the real world probably didn’t have many
acquaintances. BlackBerry makes it easy to add categories, so you can divide
your world as much as you like. Just do the following:
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Address Book.
2. Press the menu key and then select Filter.
You get a view of the default categories. (Refer to Figure 4-16.)
3. Press the menu key (again) and then select New.
A pop-up screen appears, asking you to name the new category you
want to create.
4. In the Name field, enter a name for your category and then press enter.

Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 
You can quote me on this one
The purpose of groups is to easily scroll through
your contacts, right? Assuming that you have a
long list, your Family group could be buried in
the middle of it — given where F falls in the
alphabet. Or you might not even remember one
of the group names you used. One simple tech-
nique to make a group appear at the top of your
contact list is to enclose it in single quotes. For
example, instead of naming your group Friends,
you can name it ‘Friends’. The single quote
serves a double purpose:
 A visual aid to quickly tell you that the con-
tact listing is a group
 A way to force groups to always be listed at
the very top
Just make sure that none of your contact names
are enclosed in single quotes.

After you enter the name of the category, it’s automatically saved and
you see the Filter screen, which lists all the categories, including the one
you just created. Just press the escape key (the arrow key next to the
trackball) to get back to the Address Book main screen.
You might not be able to see special characters, such as a single quote, on
the keyboard. To enter a single quote, press the Alt key (it’s to the left of the
Z key) and the Sym key to display the list of symbols. On the screen that fol-
lows, scroll and click the quote.
Note that the Address Book application won’t allow you to add a contact to a
group if that contact does not have an e-mail address. (It’s very strict on this
point.) If, however, you don’t have an e-mail address for someone you’d like
to add to a group, skirt this roadblock by editing that contact’s information
and putting in a fake (and clearly inactive) e-mail address such as
notareal@emailaddress.no.
Setting preferences
Vanilla, anyone? Some days you’ll wish that your Address Book list were
sorted differently. For example, there’s the day when you need to find the guy
who works for ABC Company but has a foreign name that you can hardly pro-
nounce, let alone spell. What’s a body to do?
You’re in luck. Once again, the good people at RIM have anticipated this sce-
nario and have made available to you Address Book Options, which is a
palette of tricks that you can use to navigate some out-of-the-ordinary situa-
tions. Address Book Options sports a very simple screen, as Figure 4-18
makes clear, yet it provides you with three important options that change
how Address Book behaves:
 Sort By: Allows you to change the way the list is sorted. You can change
the sort field criteria from First Name, Last Name, or Company from the
menu choices. You can use the Space key to toggle among the choices.
Remember that guy from ABC Company? You can use the Sort By option to
sort by Company. By doing that, all contacts from ABC Company are listed
next to each other and with any luck the guy’s name will jump out at you.
Figure 4-18:
Choose your
sort type
here.
79
Chapter 4: Remembering Your Acquaintances

 Confirm Delete: Allows you to display a confirmation screen for all con-
tact deletions. You should always keep this feature turned on for normal
usage. Because there are many ways you could accidentally delete
somebody from your Address Book, this feature is a good way of mini-
mizing those accidents.
 Allow Duplicate Names: Self-explanatory. If you turn this on, you can
have multiple people who happen to share the same name in your
Address Book. If it’s off, you get a warning when you try to add a name
that’s identical to someone who already exists on your list. Maybe you
are just tired and mistakenly try to add the same person twice to your
list. Then again, sometimes people just have the same name. We recom-
mend keeping the default value of Yes, allowing you to have contacts
with the same names.
How do you change any of these options? The fields behave like any other
fields on a BlackBerry application. You simply highlight the field, press the
trackball, and select Change Option from the menu that appears. You then
see a menu screen that allows you to select the possible option values. For
example, Figure 4-19 shows the possible Sort By fields.
Sharing a Contact
Suppose you want to share your contact information with a friend who hap-
pens to have a BlackBerry as well. A vCard — virtual (business) card — is
your answer and can make your life a lot easier. In BlackBerry Land, a vCard
is a contact in your Address Book that you send to someone as an attach-
ment to an e-mail. (Keep reading for more on sending vCards.) At the receiv-
ing end, the BlackBerry device (being the smart device that it is) recognizes
the attachment and informs the BlackBerry owner that he or she has the
option of saving it, making it available for his or her viewing pleasure in
Address Book.
Figure 4-19:
The Sort By
field
options.
80
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Sending a vCard
Because a vCard is nothing more than an Address Book contact attached to
an e-mail, sending a vCard is a piece of cake. (Of course, you do need to make
sure that your recipient has a BlackBerry device to be able to receive the
information.)
Here’s how you go about sending a vCard:
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select the Messages application.
The messages icon may differ from theme to theme, but most themes
use an image of a mail envelope, as shown in Figure 4-20.
2. Press the menu key and then select Compose Email.
The new message screen appears, allowing you to compose a new
e-mail. Your next step is to enter the name of the recipient of this e-mail.
3. In the To field, start typing the name of the person you want to
receive this vCard. When you see the name in the drop-down list,
highlight it and press the trackball.
You are now presented with an e-mail screen with the name you just
selected as the To recipient.
4. Enter the subject and message.
5. Press the menu key and then select Attach Address.
Address Book opens.
6. Highlight the name of the person whose contact information you want
attached and then press the trackball.
The e-mail composition screen reappears, and an icon that looks like a
book indicates that the e-mail now contains your attachment. Now all
you have to do is send your e-mail.
Messages
Figure 4-20:

81
Chapter 4: Remembering Your Acquaintances

7. Press the trackball and then select Send from the menu that appears.
You just shared the specified contact information. (Don’t you feel right
neighborly now?)
Receiving a vCard
If you’re the recipient of an e-mail that has a contact attachment, here’s how
you go about saving it to your Address Book:
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Messages.
2. Select the e-mail that contains the vCard.
The e-mail with the vCard attachment opens.
3. Scroll down to the attachment. When the cursor is hovering over the
attachment, press the trackball and select View Attachment from the
menu that appears.
The vCard makes an appearance on-screen. Now all you have to do is
save the contact in your Address Book.
4. Press the menu key and then select Add to Address Book.
The vCard is saved and is now available in your BlackBerry Address Book.
Searching for Somebody Outside 
Your Address Book
Does your employer provide your BlackBerry? Do you use Outlook or Lotus
Notes on your desktop machine at work? If your answer to both of these
questions is yes, this section is for you. BlackBerry Address Book has a fea-
ture that allows you to search for people in your organization, basically
through Microsoft Exchange (for Outlook), IBM Domino (for Notes), or Novell
GroupWise. Exchange, Domino, and GroupWise serve the same purposes:
namely, to facilitate e-mail delivery in a corporate environment and to enable
access to a database of names.
For you techies out there, these person databases are called Global Address
Lists (GAL) in Exchange; Notes Address Books in Domino; and GroupWise
Address Books in GroupWise.
82
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

If you want to search for somebody in your organization through a database
of names, simply follow these steps:
1. On the BlackBerry Home screen, select Address Book.
2. Press the menu key and then select Lookup.
Some corporations might not have the Lookup feature enabled. Please
check with your IT department for more information.
Although you access the Lookup feature inside Address Book, it really is
going beyond your device and into your company’s Exchange, Domino,
or GroupWise database, depending on which e-mail server your com-
pany uses.
3. In the screen that appears, enter the name you’re searching for and
then press the trackball.
You could enter the beginning characters of either a person’s surname
or first name. You are not searching on your Address Book but on your
company’s database, so this step might take some time to complete
depending on the criteria you entered.
For big organizations, we recommend being more precise when doing
your search. For example, searching for Dan yields more hits than
searching for Daniel. The more precise your search criteria, the fewer
hits you’ll get and the faster the search will be.
While the search is in progress, you’ll see the word Lookup and the cri-
teria you put in at the top of the list. For example, if you enter Daniel,
the top row reads Lookup: Daniel. After the search is finished,
BlackBerry displays the number of hits or matches: for example, 
20 matches: Daniel.
4. Select the matches count to display the list of matches.
A screen displaying the matching names based on your criteria appears.
A header at the top of this screen details the matches displayed in the
current screen as well as the total hits. For example, if the header reads
something like Lookup Daniel (20 of 130 matches), 130 people
in your Organization have the name Daniel, and BlackBerry is displaying
the first 20. You have the option of fetching more by pressing the track-
ball and choosing Get More Results from the menu that appears.
You could also add the name or names listed in this result to your
Address Book by using the Add command (for the currently highlighted
name) or the Add All command for all the names on the list. (As always,
press the trackball to call up the menu containing these options.)
When you think you’ve found the person you’re looking for, the next
step is to check the information to make sure you have the right person.
83
Chapter 4: Remembering Your Acquaintances

5. Select the person whose information you want to review.
The person’s contact information is displayed on a read-only screen.
Information might include the person’s title, e-mail address, work,
mobile, and fax numbers, and the snail-mail address at work. Any of that
information gives you confirmation about the person you’re looking for.
Of course, what shows up depends on the availability of this information
in your company’s database.
This is one of the longest chapters in the book, but you’ve just explored a
core application that you are going to use with your BlackBerry many times.
If you’ve skipped some topics, you can always go back and refer to this chap-
ter in the future whenever an Address Book question comes to mind.

T
o some folks, the key to being organized and productive is mastering time
management and using their time wisely (and we’re not just talking about
reading this book while you’re commuting to work). Many have discovered
that there is no better way to organize their time than to use a calendar — a
daily planner tool. Some prefer digital to paper, so they use a planner soft-
ware program on their PC — either installed on their hard drive or accessed
through an Internet portal (such as Yahoo!). The smartest of the bunch, of
course, use their BlackBerry handheld because it has the whole planner thing
covered in handy form with its Calendar application.
In this chapter, we show you how to keep your life (personal and work) in
order by managing your appointments with your BlackBerry Calendar. What’s
great about managing your time on a BlackBerry versus your PC is that your
BlackBerry is always with you to remind you. Just remember that you won’t
have excuses anymore for forgetting that important quarterly meeting or
Bertha’s birthday bash.
Accessing BlackBerry Calendar
BlackBerry Calendar is one of the BlackBerry core applications, like Address
Book or Phone (read more about the others in Chapter 1), so it’s easy to get
to. From the Home screen, press the menu key and then select Calendar.
Voilà! You have Calendar.

Choosing Your Calendar View
The first time you open Calendar, you’ll likely see the Day view, which is a
default setting on the BlackBerry, as shown in Figure 5-1. However, you can
change the Calendar view to a different one that works better for your needs:
 Day: This view gives you a summary of your appointments for the day.
By default, it lists all your appointments from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Week: This view shows you a seven-day summary view of your appoint-
ments. By using this view, you can see how busy you are in a particular
week.
 Month: The Month view shows you every day of the month. You can’t
tell how many appointments are in a day, but you can see on which days
you have appointments.
 Agenda: The Agenda view is a bit different from the other views. It isn’t
a time-based view like the others; it basically lists your upcoming
appointments. And in the list, you can see details of the appointments,
such as where and when.
Different views (like the ones shown in Figure 5-2) offer you a different focus
on your schedule. Select the view you want based on your scheduling needs
and preferences. If your life is a little more complicated, you can even use a
combination of views for a full grasp of your schedule.
Figure 5-2:
Change

Calendar
view to fit

Figure 5-1:

86
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

To switch between different Calendar views, simply follow these steps:
1. From the Home screen, press the menu key and then select Calendar.
Doing so calls up the Calendar application in its default view — more
than likely Day view.
2. Press the menu key and then select the view of your choice from the
menu that appears (shown in Figure 5-3).
If you start from Day view, your choices are View Week, View Month, and
View Agenda.
Moving between Time Frames
Depending on what view of Calendar you’re in, you can easily move to the
previous or next day, week, month, or year. For example, if you’re in the
Month view, you can move to the next month (um, relative to the currently
displayed month). Likewise, you can also move to the previous month. In
fact, if you like to look at things long term, you can jump ahead (or back) a
year at a time. (See Figure 5-4.)

dialog box that lets you choose the date you want. To change the date, scroll
the trackball to the desired day, month, and year, as shown in Figure 5-5.
Customizing Your Calendar
To change the initial (default) view in your Calendar — from Day view to
Month view, for example — Calendar Options is the answer. To get to Calendar

menu that appears. You see choices similar to the ones shown in Table 5-2.

All Things Appointments: Adding,
Opening, and Deleting
After you master navigating the different Calendar views (and that should
take you all of about two minutes), and you have Calendar customized to
your heart’s content (another three minutes, tops), it’s time (pun intended)
to set up, review, and delete appointments. We also show you how to set up a
meeting with clients or colleagues.
Creating an appointment
Setting up a new appointment is easy. You need only one piece of informa-
tion: when your appointment occurs. Of course, you can easily add related
information about the appointment, such as the meeting’s purpose, its loca-
tion, and whatever additional notes are helpful.
In addition to your standard one-time, limited-duration meeting, you can also
set all-day appointments. The BlackBerry can assist you in setting recurring
meetings as well as reminders. Sweet!
Creating a one-time appointment
To add a new one-time appointment, follow these steps:
1. Open Calendar.
2. Press the menu key and then select New.
The New Appointment screen appears, as shown in Figure 5-6.
Figure 5-6:
Set an
appointment
here.
90
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

3. Fill in the key appointment information.
Type all the information regarding your appointment in the appropriate
spaces. You should at least enter the time and the subject of your
appointment.
4. Press the menu key and then select Save.
This saves your newly created appointment.
Your new appointment is now in Calendar and viewable from any Calendar
view. Also, keep in mind that you can have more than one appointment in the
same time slot. Why? Well, the BlackBerry Calendar allows conflicts in your
schedule because it lets you make the hard decision about which appoint-
ment you should forgo.
Creating an all-day appointment
If your appointment is an all-day event — for example, if you’re in corporate
training or have an all-day doctor’s appointment — mark the All Day Event
check box in the New Appointment screen, as shown in Figure 5-7. You can do
so by scrolling to the check box and pressing the trackball. When this check
box is checked, you will not be able to specify the time of your appointment —
just the start date and end date (simply because it doesn’t make sense to spec-
ify a time for an all-day event).
Setting your appointment reminder time
Any appointment you enter in Calendar can be associated with a reminder
alert — either a vibration or a beep, depending on how you set things up in
your profile. (For more on profiles, see Chapter 3.) You can also choose to
have no reminder for an appointment. From the New Appointment screen,
simply scroll to the Reminder field and select a reminder time anywhere from
none to 1 week before your appointment time.
Figure 5-7:
Set an 
all-day
event here.
91
Chapter 5: Don’t Miss Your Appointments

Profile is simply another useful BlackBerry feature that allows you to cus-
tomize how your BlackBerry alerts you when an event occurs. Examples of
events are an e-mail, a phone call, or a reminder for an appointment.
By default, whatever reminder alert you set goes off 15 minutes before the
event. But you don’t have to stick with the default. You can choose your own
default reminder time. Here’s how:
1. Open Calendar.
2. Press the menu key and then select Options.
Doing so calls up the Calendar Options screen.
3. Select Default Reminder.
4. Choose a default reminder time anywhere from none to 1 week
before your appointment.
So from now on, any new appointment has a default reminder time of what
you just set up. Assuming that you have a reminder time other than none, the
next time you have an appointment coming up, you see a dialog box like the
one shown in Figure 5-8, reminding you of an upcoming appointment.
Creating a recurring appointment
You can set up recurring appointments based on daily, weekly, monthly, 
or yearly recurrences. Everyone has some appointment that repeats, such 
as birthdays or anniversaries (or taking out the trash every Thursday at 
7:30 a.m. — ugh).
For all recurrence types, you can define an Every field. For example, say you
have an appointment that recurs every nine days. Just set the Recurrence
field to Daily and the Every field to 9, as shown in Figure 5-9.
Figure 5-8:
You get a
reminder
dialog box if
you want.
92
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Depending on what you select in the Recurrence field, you have the option to
fill in other fields. If you enter Weekly in the Recurrence field, for example,
you have the option of filling in the Day of the Week field. (It basically allows
you to select the day of the week on which your appointment recurs.)
If you enter Monthly or Yearly in the Recurrence field, the Relative Date
check box is available. With this check box checked, you can ensure that
your appointment recurs relative to today’s date. For example, if you choose
the following, your appointment occurs every two months on the third
Sunday until July 31, 2010:
Start: Sunday, June 17, 2007 at 12 p.m.
End: Sunday, June 17, 2007 at 1 p.m.
Recurrence: Monthly
Every: 2
Relative Date: Selected
End: Saturday, July 31, 2010
On the other hand, if all options in our example remain the same except that
Relative Date is not selected, your appointment occurs every two months, on
the 18th of the month, until July 31, 2010.
If all this “relative” talk has you dizzy, don’t worry: The majority of your
appointments won’t be as complicated as this.

Opening an appointment
After you set an appointment, you can view it in a couple of ways. If you’ve
set up reminders for your appointment and the little Reminder dialog box
appears on-screen at the designated time before your appointment, you can
view your appointment by clicking the box’s Open button (refer to Figure
5-8). Or you can open the appointment from Calendar by going to the exact
time of your appointment and viewing it there.
While looking at an appointment, you have the option of making changes 
(a new appointment time and new appointment location) and then saving
them.
Deleting an appointment
Deleting an appointment is straightforward. When in Day or Week view,
simply scroll to the appointment that you want to delete, press the menu key,
and select Delete from the menu that appears.
If the appointment that you’re deleting is part of a recurring appointment, a
dialog box pops up asking whether you want to delete all occurrences of this
appointment or just this particular occurrence, as shown in Figure 5-10. After
you make your choice, your appointment is history.

Appointments versus Meetings
Technically, any event in your Calendar counts as an appointment, whether
it’s a reminder for your best friend’s birthday or a reminder of a doctor’s
appointment for a checkup. However, when you invite people to an appoint-
ment or you get invited to one, regardless of whether it’s a face-to-face meet-
ing or a phone conference, that appointment becomes a meeting.
Sending a meeting request
Sending a meeting request to others is similar to creating a Calendar 
appointment:
1. Open Calendar.
2. Press the menu key and then select New.
3. Fill in the key appointment information (subject, location, and time).
4. Press the menu key and then select Invite Attendee.
You’re taken to Address Book to select your meeting attendee.
5. From Address Book:
• If you have contacts in your Address Book: Highlight the contact you
want and press the trackball.
• If you don’t yet have contacts or the one you want isn’t in your
Address Book: Use the Use Once option to enter the appropriate
e-mail address and press the enter key to finish and return to
Calendar.
6. After returning from Address Book, you see the attendees in your
Calendar meeting notice.
7. Press the menu key and then select Save.
This action actually sends an e-mail to your meeting attendees, inviting
them to your meeting.
95
Chapter 5: Don’t Miss Your Appointments

Responding to a meeting request
If you’ve ever worked in an office, you’ve likely received a meeting request by
e-mail, asking you to respond to the meeting by choosing one of three
options: Accept, Tentative, or Decline. (If it’s from your boss for an all-staff
meeting and you just can’t afford to decline again because it’s so close to
Christmas bonus time, that’s an Accept.)
You can accept any meeting request from your managers or colleagues on
your BlackBerry just as you would on your desktop PC. In the PC world, you
respond to an e-mail request for a meeting by clicking the appropriate button
in your e-mail client (Microsoft Outlook, for the vast majority of you out
there). In the BlackBerry world, a meeting request also comes in the form of
an e-mail; upon reading the e-mail, just choose Accept, Tentative, or Decline
in the Messages application, as shown in Figure 5-11. Your response is sent
back in an e-mail. We go into more detail about the Messages application in
Chapter 8.
After you respond to the meeting request, the meeting is added to your
Calendar automatically. If you have a change of heart later, you can change
your response (yes, you can later decline that useless meeting) in Calendar,
and the declined event disappears from your Calendar.

U
sing your BlackBerry as an organizational tool is one of the key themes
in this book. And speaking of organization, what better proof of your
impressive organizational skills could exist than the fact that you use task, or
to-do, lists? Knowing what you need to do today, tomorrow, the entire week,
or perhaps the whole month makes you more efficient on your job and in
your personal life. The fact is that you not only need to know what your tasks
are, but you also need to prioritize them — and reprioritize them, if neces-
sary. And with your BlackBerry as your able assistant, you can.
In this chapter, we introduce you to your Blackberry device’s Tasks applica-
tion. Stick with us as we explore this valuable tool, jumping from creating and
maintaining your to-do list to setting alerts for a recurring task in a single
bound. We also throw in a few tips and tricks to make maintaining and
searching your Tasks list easier and faster. Of course, we can’t advise you on
how to actually do the task after your BlackBerry calls your attention to it,
but with your BlackBerry in your palm, you’re at least a step closer to clear-
ing your desk. Finally, we also give you the scoop on keeping your passwords
safe by using the Password Keeper application.
Even if you keep a to-do list on your desktop (Outlook, anyone?), consider
switching to all BlackBerry, all the time. You’ll love the greater flexibility that
comes with greater mobility. Or, if you just can’t give up your desktop appli-
cation, you have the option of using both applications and just synchronizing
them. (More about that later in the chapter.)

The Tasks application we describe here is the latest version as of this writing.
Some earlier models don’t have features such as Filter, but the core function-
ality hasn’t changed. When we describe a feature not on earlier models, we
point that out. If you have an older model of BlackBerry, you can avail your-
self of the latest version of Tasks by upgrading your OS, because core
BlackBerry applications, including Tasks, are bundled with the OS. (See
Chapter 17 for details on how to upgrade your OS.)
Accessing Tasks
Depending on your BlackBerry theme, launching Tasks is just a press of the
trackball. If you are using the BB Dimension Icon theme, Tasks is visible at
the onset on the Home screen, as you can see in Figure 6-1. Just look for the
icon of a notepad with check marks.
On other themes such as Cingular, Tasks is accessible through the Application
icon, as shown in Figure 6-2. Locating Tasks is easy — just highlight Applications
and press the trackball. On the screen that follows, you should find Tasks. Note
that the display may vary depending on the theme you use.

Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

The number of themes installed on your device can vary from service
provider to service provider. For example, take a look at Figure 6-3 to see the
difference between RIM and T-Mobile themes:
 RIM: The left screen in Figure 6-3 is a Cingular theme. Here the Tasks
icon is similar to the one used in BB Dimension Today.
 T-Mobile: The right screen in Figure 6-3 is the T-Mobile Zen theme.
(Depending on your service provider, the device might be set to the
provider’s theme, like the one we have here for T-Mobile.) On the T-
Mobile Zen theme, you can customize five application icons to appear
on the Home screen. Other applications are accessible by pressing the
menu key, which lists all applications, and then using the trackball to
scroll and select from the list.
For the BlackBerry Pearl, the icons used by other providers might be differ-
ent from what you see presented here for your delight by Cingular and 
T-Mobile. If this is the case for your BlackBerry, just remember that Tasks 
is always in Applications. If you can locate the Applications icon, it’s just a
matter of pressing the trackball to locate the Tasks icon.
Recording a New Task
The first step when building a to-do list is to start recording one. Don’t groan
and roll your eyes, dreading how long this will take. This is easy, so just relax
and you’ll be finished in a snap.
Follow these simple steps:
1. Select Tasks.
The Tasks application opens. Similar to Address Book and MemoPad,
the screen that appears is divided into two parts: The top shows the
Find field, followed by the list of tasks or *No Tasks*.

Chapter 6: Your To-Do List and Keeping Your Password

2. Press the menu key and then select New (as shown on the left in
Figure 6-4).
The New screen appears, as shown on the right side of Figure 6-4, ready
and willing to document your new task. This simple screen features
easy-to-understand fields that describe the task you’re about to enter.
3. Use the trackball to move to each field and enter information for 
your task.
Some fields are for text that you enter yourself, and some fields hold
items you select from a menu specific for that field. In other words, for
text fields, you have to type the stuff you want; but for nontext fields,
you select the field, press the trackball again, and then select your
choice from the selection that appears. (Pretty convenient, huh?) We
explain all these fields in the next section, “Navigating the Tasks Fields.”
To update a field from a list of choices, select that field and then press
the trackball.
4. After filling in the relevant fields, press the menu key and then 
select Save.
Doing so saves your task, and you should see the task added to the
Tasks list.
Navigating the Tasks Fields
The New task screen (refer to Figure 6-4) is straightforward and contains few
fields. Although the few fields there are self-explanatory, we (being the thor-
ough guys that we are) describe each one here.
Figure 6-4:
Select New
and an

appears.
100
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Task field
Use this field to log the subject or a short description of your task. Make this
field as descriptive as you can: The subject you type here should be specific
enough that you can differentiate this task from the rest on your list. For
example, if you make several presentations to clients, you don’t want to call
your task Prepare Presentations. You want to be specific so that you can dis-
tinguish it. Perhaps name it Product X Benefit Forecast to XYZ CFO. You can
search on this field from the main Tasks screen.
Status field
Fill in the Status field to indicate the current state of your task. Status is a
selection field — that is, after highlighting the field, you press the trackball
and select a value from the list.
The choices you see give you a good idea of the field’s purpose. The follow-
ing are the possible values you can choose from:
 Not Started: You haven’t started this task yet. Because this choice is the
most common, Not Started is the default choice when creating a task.
 In Progress: You are in the midst of the task.
 Completed: You are finished with the task.
 Waiting: Your task is ongoing and dependent on another task or another
event. For example, you’re waiting for Joe in Accounting to get you a
spreadsheet so that you can include it in your report and complete the
task.
 Deferred: Your task is on hold. Maybe you just don’t need to work on
this task at the moment, or you want more information before you
decide whether this task is worth doing. Either way, you want to keep
the task listed so that you can track it or resurrect it. Perhaps this task
isn’t a big deal today, but could become important in a month or two. By
tagging a task as Deferred, you keep yourself aware of a task that might
or might not ramp up.
Priority field
In the Priority field, you can specify the timeliness or urgency of the task.
Like the Status field, the choices here are selections you make from a menu.
You can choose from one of the following values:
101
Chapter 6: Your To-Do List and Keeping Your Password

 High: This is the highest possible setting. You should consider the most
urgent task to be of high priority.
 Normal: This is the default value, which applies to most tasks. In reality,
a Normal task can jump to become a High priority when it’s not finished
in time, but you have to decide and assign that yourself.
 Low: Just like you’d surmise, a Low rating tags a task as being not that
critical — you can put this one off until you’re finished with the High and
Normal tasks. You can rate all your nice-to-have tasks with this priority.
Hint: When you’re finished with your High and Normal tasks, reprioritize
your Low tasks.
Due field
Consider the Due field as your task completion deadline. Here, you can enter
a due date for your task. The default here is None; to change the value to a
specified due date, follow these steps:
1. Select the field.
A pop-up menu appears on-screen offering two options: None and 
By Date.
2. Select the By Date option.
A date field appears on the next line, as shown in Figure 6-5. The value of
the date defaults to the current date. If the current date is not your
intended due date, proceed to Step 3 to change the value of this date.
3. Select the specific portion of the date that you want to change.
The portion of the date that you highlighted is now editable. The date
portions that you can change are year, month, day, and time. Although
this is a date field — like any date field in Tasks, for that matter — 
setting its value will not create an entry in Calendar.
Figure 6-5:
Set a task’s
due date
here.
102
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

4. Using the trackball, scroll to the specific date value you want and then
press the trackball to accept the change.
At this point, you should have the right value of the date component 
you want.
Note: Say you modified the day but you want a specific time on that day.
Repeat Steps 3 and 4 but this time highlight (and edit) the time component of
the date.
While you are specifying the due date, you might see the Recurrence and No
Recurrence fields. These fields show up only when you select By Date in the
Due field. Intrigued? Check the “Creating Recurring Tasks” section, later in
this chapter, for details about these fields.
Time Zone field
The Time Zone field holds the time zone related to the date fields used for
this task: Due (preceding section) and Reminder (following section). If these
fields have values of None, this field is irrelevant.
You can specify a time zone different from your locale. For example, if you
live in New York and you anticipate completing this task in Mexico City, you
can specify the Mexico City time zone. Then all the times in this task become
relative to Mexico City.
Reminder field
From the Reminder field (a date field), you can set an alarm or a notice on the
date and time you specify. You can set it just like you would set the Due field.
(See the earlier section, “Due field.”) Setting a reminder is useful, especially
for those important tasks that you can’t afford to forget (such as buying a
birthday gift for your significant other).
Again, just like any date field in Tasks, setting its value will not make it show
up in your Calendar. The type of reminder you get is based on your active
profile. (Please check Chapter 3 for details on how to customize notifications
in your profile.)
When the reminder date is met, BlackBerry notifies you and displays a
reminder screen. On this screen, you will see the name of the task and possi-
ble actions: Open (opens the task), Mark Completed (shows up for a task
with a status other than Completed), and Dismiss (closes the screen).
103
Chapter 6: Your To-Do List and Keeping Your Password

Categories field
Use the Categories field to assign a specific category that you can use to filter
your Tasks list later. Note: This feature is available only on BlackBerry
devices with OS version 4.0. By default, this field is blank. However, you can
easily assign a value to it from the Categories screen available through the
context menu. We find that using the Categories field is important for organiz-
ing your list, so we describe it fully in the separate section, “Organizing Your
Tasks List.”
Notes field
The Notes field is a free-for-all text field. You can put anything here you want,
such as a detailed description of the task or any other info that relates to 
this task.
Updating Your Tasks
When it’s time to update your Tasks list — say, after finishing a high-priority
task or when you want to change the due date for a specific task — the Tasks
application won’t stand in your way. You can quickly go back to your Tasks
list and update those records.
To update a specific task, follow these steps:
1. Select Tasks.
The Tasks application opens to the Find screen, which displays your
current Tasks list.
2. In the Tasks list, select the task you need to edit.
The screen that opens is the same one you used to create the high-
lighted task, although obviously this display has fields filled with the
information you already entered.
3. Update the fields.
Go through each of the fields that you want to edit.
The Task and Notes fields are text fields that you can edit from here. To
update the other fields, you have to highlight the field and then press
the trackball to make those fields editable.
4. Press the menu key and then select Save.
This saves your task, and you can see the updated task in the Tasks list.
104
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Deleting a Task
Just like folks make a ritual of spring-cleaning when winter fades, the same is
true for your tasks. When a task is completed and keeping it just takes up
space, simply delete it through your Tasks application.
In simple steps, here’s how:
1. Select Tasks.
The Tasks application opens, displaying your Tasks list.
2. Using your trackball, highlight the task you want to delete.
3. Press the menu key and then select Delete.
You see the standard Confirmation screen.
4. If you’re sure that this task is doomed for the dustbin, highlight Delete
on the Confirmation screen and press the trackball.
The task is deleted, and your Tasks list is updated.
Organizing Your Tasks List
As time goes by, your Tasks list is sure to grow — which means that the time
it takes to find a task in your List is sure to grow as well. One way to stay
organized is to make it a habit to delete finished tasks from your list, as we
detail in the preceding section. (The shorter the list, the better, as we always
say.) We recommend weeding out your Tasks list every time a project or a
goal is completed. After all, when a particular project is completed, you prob-
ably don’t need to go back to the tasks you did for it.
If you’re someone who just loves to document everything you accomplish (or
you work in an environment where you’re expected to keep a listing of tasks
completed — can you say quarterly employee review?), you might not relish
the idea of deleting any entry from your Tasks list. In that case, regularly
archive a copy of your entire Tasks list before you do any weeding, and you’ll
have a complete record of every stitch of hard work you contributed to a pro-
ject. To archive, synchronize your BlackBerry with your desktop and store
the data in whatever time-management software you use on your desktop.
BlackBerry can synchronize to personal as well as enterprise time-management
software. (For details on how to synchronize, see Chapter 16.)
After synchronization, you can print the Tasks list related to this completed
project (via your desktop application), which you can file. Having a hard
copy of those completed tasks can give you peace of mind as you delete
tasks from your BlackBerry. The best of both worlds, right? You clean up
105
Chapter 6: Your To-Do List and Keeping Your Password

your Tasks list (making it easier for you to do a search), and you have an
archive (in case you need a historical reference).
Another way to stay organized is to sort your Tasks list. Even after you weed
out tasks you’ve completed, you may still have difficulty finding a task from
your list. Fear not; help is available. Chances are that when you look for a task,
you know something identifiable about it, such as its priority or due date.
Because you assign information about your task when you create it (see the ear-
lier sections, “Navigating the Tasks Fields” and “Updating Your Tasks”), you can
use that information as part of a Task sort in your BlackBerry. By default, your
Tasks list is sorted by the name or subject of your task, but you can also sort by
priority, due date, or status. For example, if you know the due date of your task,
you can sort your list by due date and thus quickly find the task at hand.
“Sounds great,” you say, “but how do I change the sort criteria?” We’re glad
you asked. Because changing how you sort basically involves customizing
your BlackBerry device, we’re going to stick that discussion in the next sec-
tion, entitled, appropriately enough, “Customizing tasks.”
Customizing tasks
You can make two — count ’em, two — Tasks customizations through the
Options screen: sort by criteria and deletion confirmation. Locating the
Options screen from the Tasks application is easy. Just press the trackball,
and select Options. The Tasks Options screen appears, displaying your two
choices, as shown in Figure 6-6:
 Sort By: Here you can change how the list is sorted. The default task list-
ing is the alphabetical order of the subject from A to Z (no reverse). To
change to a different sort field:
a. In the Tasks Options screen, highlight the Sort By field and then
press the trackball.
A list displays your sorting options. You can choose from Subject,
Priority, Due Date, or Status.
b. Highlight your choice and then press the trackball.
Figure 6-6:
Change
your Tasks
sort options

106
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

 Confirm Delete: This option allows you to control whether you want the
application to display a confirmation screen upon deleting an item from
your list. In other BlackBerry applications, this option is common. These
confirmations appear as a safety feature so you don’t accidentally press
Delete and lose something you really didn’t want to lose. It’s true that
you can always turn this feature off in any one of your BlackBerry appli-
cations, but we generally recommend that you keep the value of this
field set to Yes, meaning that it prompts you for every delete.
There are exceptions to every rule, however. When you begin to weed
out a bunch of outdated tasks from your Tasks list, toggle this feature off
so that you don’t get 27 prompts in a row when you’re deleting 27 items.
(But toggle the feature back on when you’re finished weeding.)
To turn off this feature, just do the following:
a. In the Tasks Options screen, select the Confirm Delete field.
The screen shows your two choices: Yes and No (See Figure 6-7).
No means you want to toggle off the Confirmation screen.
b. Select No.
The Tasks Options screen updates to show No in the Confirm
Delete field.
c. Press the trackball and then select Save.
The Tasks application applies the change you made.
Another field you can see from the Tasks Options screen is Number of
Entries. This field is just informational, showing you how many tasks you
have in your Tasks application.
Creating a category
Sometimes sorting on a specific criterion such as Subject or Due Date still
might not give you a quick answer to what you’re looking for. For example, if
you want to know how many more personal tasks you still have to do as
Figure 6-7:
Toggle
delete
confirmation
here.
107
Chapter 6: Your To-Do List and Keeping Your Password

opposed to the more business-oriented stuff you’ve got going, sorting is of no
help, right? What you really need is a way to filter your list based on certain
groups that you define. (Personal versus Business would be a good start.)
The good people at RIM anticipated such a need and introduced categories.
So what exactly is a category, and why is it important? A category is a way for
you to group your tasks in a manner that you can come back to. The grouping
is the category, and the listing with a certain category is a filter. To make a
task part of a group or category, you simply assign it a category when you
record a task, or you can update the task and assign it a category then. 
(See earlier sections in this chapter for how to do both.)
To make use of this feature, start by creating a category by using the follow-
ing steps:
1. Select Tasks.
The Tasks application opens, displaying your Tasks list in the Find screen.
2. Press the menu key and then select Filter.
The Select Category screen appears (see Figure 6-8), listing all the avail-
able categories. The two default entries on the list are Business and
Personal. By all means, feel free to use these default categories.
Consider, though, that these categories are broad and might not be help-
ful if you have a lot of tasks. (Imagine going to a grocery store with only
two sections: perishable and nonperishable.) Our advice to you: Go the
extra mile and create some categories to work with.
Strive to define groups or categories that are meaningful in your line of
work and not so broad.
3. Press the menu key and then select New.
The New Category screen appears, allowing you to define a new 
category. Imagine that.
4. In the New Category screen, enter your category name in the text
field and then press the trackball.
Figure 6-8:
Organize
with
categories.
108
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Doing so establishes your category and lists it as an option in the Select
Category screen. Refer to Figure 6-8.
You can define as many categories as necessary upfront. This way, you won’t
have to go back and create them. After you have the categories you want,
assign your tasks to those categories.
One important aspect of categories you should be aware of is that they are
shared among applications: specifically, among Address Book, MemoPad, and
Tasks. This sibling relationship might sound trivial at first, but don’t make the
common mistake of assuming that what you change in Tasks does not affect
other BlackBerry apps. The case of categories would show you how wrong
such assumptions are. The importance of this comes into play when you
delete a category in an application. For example, if you’re working in Tasks
and you decide to delete a category, you’ll soon discover that you’ve lost that
category in Address Book as well — with all its assignments. (The Address
Book contact is still intact but will be missing the category assignment.)
Assigning categories to your tasks
Here’s how to assign a category to an existing task while you’re in the Tasks
application:
1. Select the task in the Tasks list.
The Edit Task screen appears, ready for any changes you’d like to make.
2. Select the Category field.
3. In the list that appears, select the category.
The category you selected is entered into the field.
4. Press the menu key and then select Save.
The task is now associated with the category you selected.
Filtering the list
As you can read in the preceding section, you create categories and assign
them to your tasks. To see the tasks associated with a certain category, just
filter the list, which is way easy. Like all other options, Filter is available
through the menu while you are in the Tasks application. Selecting that menu
option gives you a screen that allows you to select any category listed. After
you choose a category, the list is filtered so that only those tasks assigned to
the chosen category are visible.
109
Chapter 6: Your To-Do List and Keeping Your Password

So much for the overview. Here are the nitty-gritty details:
1. Select Tasks.
The Tasks application opens, displaying your Tasks list.
2. Press the menu key and then select Filter.
The Select Category screen appears, listing all the available categories
(refer to Figure 6-8).
3. Select the category you want.
A filtered list appears, containing just the tasks associated with the
chosen category. Note that the list has the category name as the head-
ing, as shown in Figure 6-9.
After you have the necessary categories, divide your tasks into appropriate
categories to make running a task sort easier.
Creating Recurring Tasks
A more advanced feature in Tasks is to create a recurring task — you know,
one that repeats periodically. Maybe the recurring task is deadline driven,
such as filing your taxes or paying bills, or buying presents for your signifi-
cant other for his or her birthday, Valentine’s day, or anniversary. (Other
times, a recurring task might be something a bit more mundane, such as turn-
ing in a weekly status report to your boss.)
Making a task recur is simple, although it might not be obvious at first. (Rest
assured; we show you the trick.) Basically, you either create a task from
scratch or you use an existing task.
If you don’t see the Recurrence field while looking at your existing task, the
task doesn’t have a due date — and it has to have a due date to make it a
recurring task.
Figure 6-9:
A filtered
task list.
110
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Say you want a task to repeat every year. With the Tasks application running,
do the following to make the task recur on a yearly basis:
1. In the Tasks list, select the task you want to recur.
The Edit Task screen for the specified task appears.
2. If the Due field in the Edit Task screen reads None, highlight the field,
press the trackball, and then select By Date from the menu.
The screen displays a Date field — short for Due Date. The default date
is the current date, so if you haven’t yet changed the default date to
your due date, do that now. (The “Due field” section, earlier in this chap-
ter, has all the details on how to do this.)
If you scroll down the screen, notice that the Recurrence field appears
with a default value of None. Recurrence always appears after a due date
is specified, so you will see it the next time you open this task.
3. Select the Recurrence field.
Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly selections appear. These designate
when your task recurs. For our current example, we want the task to
repeat yearly.
4. Select Yearly from the list.
At this point, your task recurs yearly, beginning on the date you speci-
fied in the Due field (Step 2).
Note: The End field below the Recurrence field is the end of the recurrence
and comes in handy when you specify a relative reminder. For example, con-
sider the following:
Due: Thu, Dec 15, 2007 5:00 p.m.
Reminder: Relative
15 Min.
Recurrence: Yearly
Every: 1
End: Mon, Dec 15, 2010
Relative Date: (Checked)
Occurs every year until Dec 15, 2008
Your task will recur every December 15 of each year until 2010. You won’t 
see any difference in the behavior of this task versus a nonrecurring task.
However, at 4:45 p.m. every December 15, you’ll get a reminder. By default,
your BlackBerry will vibrate to alarm you (check Chapter 3 for details on cus-
tomizing your Tasks notification in Profiles).

Also, after the End field is a Relative Date check box field. To check/uncheck
this field, use the trackball to scroll and highlight the field and then press the
Space key. Mark the Relative Date field if the date is not exact but relative on the
day: For example, you want the task to recur every third Thursday of December
rather than every December 15. This field is associated to Recurrence and will
appear only when it’s appropriate. In fact, you will not see this field for daily or
weekly — only for monthly and yearly recurrence.
Using Password Keeper
Suppose you’re in front of an Internet browser, trying to access an online
account. For the life of you, you just can’t remember the user name that
matches your password. It’s your third login attempt, and if you fail this time,
your online account is locked. Then you have to call the customer hotline and
wait hours before you can speak to a representative. Argghh. We’ve all done it.
Luckily, the folks at RIM created an application just for people like you (and
us) so you never get locked out of your own online accounts again — and yet
can keep intruders at bay.
Password Keeper is the simple yet practical BlackBerry application that
makes your life that much easier.
Accessing Password Keeper
Whether it’s the BlackBerry Pearl, 8800, or Curve, the location of Password
Keeper depends on the theme. For example, in the AT&T theme, Password
Keeper is filed in Application (as shown in Figure 6-10, left). If you’re using
the BB Dimension Icon theme, Password Keeper is visible right on your Home
screen (see Figure 6-10, right).
Figure 6-10:

Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Not all BlackBerry devices come with Password Keeper out of the box. You
may need to specifically request that your service provider install it on your
BlackBerry. It is free, though.
Setting a password for Password Keeper
The very first time you access Password Keeper, you’re prompted to enter a
password. Please be sure to remember the password you choose because this
is the password to all your passwords. In addition, you are prompted to enter
this master password every single time you access Password Keeper.
We know it sounds perverse to set up yet another password to help you
manage your passwords, but trust us. Having to remember just one password
is a lot easier than having to remember many.
Creating credentials
Okay, so you’re ready to fire up your handy-dandy Password Keeper applica-
tion. Now, what kinds of things does it expect you to do for it to work its
magic? Obviously, you’re going to need to collect the pertinent info for all
your various password-protected accounts so that you can store them in the
protected environs of Password Keeper. So, when creating a new password
entry, be sure you have the following information (see Figure 6-11):
 Title: This one’s straightforward. Just come up with a name to describe
the password-protected account — My Bank Account, for example.
 Username: This is where you enter the user name for the account.
 Password: Enter the password for the account here.
 Website: Put the Web site address (its URL) here.
 Notes: Not exactly crucial, but the Notes field does give you a bit of
room to add a comment or two.
Figure 6-11:
Set your
password
here.
113
Chapter 6: Your To-Do List and Keeping Your Password

The only required field is Title, but a title alone usually isn’t of much use to
you. We suggest that you fill in as much other information here as possible,
but at the same time be discreet about those locations where you use your user
name and password — so don’t put anything in the Website field or use My
eBay Account as a title. That way, if someone does somehow gain access to
your password to Password Keeper, the intruder will have a hard time figur-
ing out where exactly to use your credentials.
Random password generation
If you’re the kind of person who uses one password for everything but knows
deep in your heart that this is just plain wrong, wrong, wrong, random pass-
word generation is for you. When creating a new password for yet another
online account (or when changing your password for an online account you
already have), fire up Password Keeper, press the trackball, and then select
Random Password from the menu that appears. Voila! A new password is
automatically generated for you, as shown in Figure 6-12.
Using random password generation makes sense in conjunction with
Password Keeper because you don’t have to remember the randomly gener-
ated password that Password Keeper came up with for any of your online
accounts — that’s Password Keeper’s job.
Using your password
The whole point of Password Keeper is to let your BlackBerry’s electronic
brain do your password remembering for you. So, imagine this scenario: You
can no longer live without owning your personal copy of the A Chipmunk
Christmas CD, so you surf on over to your favorite online music store and
attempt to log in. You draw a blank on your password, but instead of
seething, you take out your BlackBerry, open Password Keeper, and do a
search. Like Address Book (see Chapter 4), you just type the first letters of
your account title in the Find field to search for the title of your password.
Figure 6-12:
A randomly
generated
password.
114
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

After you find (and highlight) the title, you press the trackball and the screen
for your account appears, conveniently listing the password. All you have to
do now is enter the password into the login screen for the online music store
and Alvin, Simon, and Theodore will soon be wending their way to your
address, ready to sing “Chipmunk Jingle Bells.”
Yes, you do have the option of copying and pasting your password from
Password Keeper to another application — BlackBerry Browser, for instance.
Just highlight the password name, press the trackball, and select Copy to
Clipboard from the menu that appears. Then navigate to where you want to
enter to password, press the trackball, and select Paste from the menu. Keep
in mind, for the copy-and-paste function to work for passwords from Password
Keeper, you need to enable the Allow Clipboard Copy option in the Password
Keeper options (see the upcoming Table 6-1). You can copy and paste only
one password at a time.
After you paste your password in another application, clear the Clipboard by
pressing the trackball and choosing Clear Clipboard. The Clipboard keeps
your last copied password until you clear it.
Password Keeper options
The Password Keeper’s Options menu, which is accessible by pressing the
menu key while in Password Keeper, allows you to control how Password
Keeper behaves. For example, you can set what characters can make up a
randomly generated password. Table 6-1 describes all these options.

In This Chapter
 Using MemoPad
 Managing your notes
 Printing your notes
 Using Calculator and its shortcuts
 Converting from metric to English measurement systems
You know what a memo pad is. Most people take them to meetings. Yes,
you take them to those looong meetings. Bored and need to stay awake?
Your memo pad is the answer. You can draw faces, doodle fanciful designs, or
even write a poem, all the while pretending to listen to the blabbering of your
colleagues or boss. Why do people like to call for meetings? Let’s get every-
body in a room and talk about something that doesn’t concern them. Just
lovely, isn’t it?
Well, we got distracted there. What we describe in this chapter is your e-memo
pad for taking notes — the aptly named MemoPad — on your BlackBerry.
Your BlackBerry has another handy application that saves you from having to
stuff yet another gizmo in your pocket or purse: its built-in Calculator, which
we talk about in this chapter as well.
MemoPad
MemoPad on your BlackBerry can prove handy, indeed. If nothing else, use it
to jot down important notes and ideas you might forget. How many frustrat-
ing times do we have to endure for not remembering a fleeting thought? Like
when we call somebody to ask about something but after the hello and the
weather talk, we can no longer remember why we called in the first place. We
forget small things, and sometimes we forget important ones. It is natural;
writing down your thoughts is the best way. Or as you might expect us to say,
use your handy-dandy BlackBerry.

In upcoming sections, we explore how to jot down notes by using MemoPad
as well as how to effectively organize your notes and come back to them
quickly by using filters. We also throw in tips on how to print your notes.
Accessing MemoPad
Accessing MemoPad is a snap. Depending on the theme you are using, you
can get to it right from the Home screen or through the Applications link.
With the Cingular theme (Figure 7-1, left) you access MemoPad through the
Applications icon. Figure 7-1, right, shows the link from the Home screen to
MemoPad on the 8800 model sporting a BB Dimension Icon theme. 
Jotting down notes
After MemoPad is open, recording notes is a breeze. Simply press the menu
key to display the MemoPad menu you see on the left of Figure 7-2. Selecting
the New option in this menu gets you an empty memo screen, as shown on
the right of Figure 7-2. A line divides the screen; the top field is for the title of
your memo; and the bottom part is where you enter the memo. There is no
limit on the size of the memo as long as your BlackBerry has the capacity to
store it.
Figure 7-2:
Start a new
note here.
MemoPad
Figure 7-1:
Open
MemoPad
here.
118
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

When entering the note title, briefly describe the subject. If you use long
words, four words are about the optimum; otherwise, five words can fit.
Of course, you can enter more than five words — or as many as you want —
but remember that the BlackBerry screen isn’t wide. MemoPad displays the
title as one line in the main MemoPad screen, which is the Find list. If your
note title is longer than the width of the screen, the title is truncated with an
ellipsis (...) at its end.
Because your MemoPad list is sorted alphabetically, pay special attention to
choosing a helpful first word when entering the title. Use descriptive words
and refrain from starting with A, An, The, This, and similar words.
Just like jotting down new memos, you can access all your memos easily in
the MemoPad list and act on them by using the menu. Remember that just
like in other applications, the menu is always available by pressing the menu
key. The menu that appears is in context with the currently selected memo,
as shown in Figure 7-3. From this figure, you can see the link to View, Edit,
and Delete.
Viewing your notes
Obviously, you jot a memo for future reference. Viewing the memo is the next
logical step. After MemoPad is open, use the trackball to select the memo you
want to view, and a read-only screen displaying your memo shows up.
If you’re not happy with the font size, whether it’s too small or too big, see
Chapter 3 for details on how to customize display fonts. MemoPad is using
the global preferences defined in Options (Screen/Keyboard).
View is the default action for a highlighted memo. By pressing the enter key
or the trackball, the highlighted memo displays in view, or read-only, mode.
Figure 7-3:

menu.
119
Chapter 7: Making Notes and Calculations

Updating your notes
Change is inevitable — or perhaps you made a mistake in your note taking.
No problem. Updating your memo is easy. Just as when viewing a contact,
highlight the memo you want to edit from the MemoPad list. Press the menu
key and select Edit from the menu that appears. An editable screen similar to
the screen you used to add a memo shows up. Make your edits and then save
them by pressing the trackball and choosing Save.
Deleting your notes
Face it, half of the sticky notes you find around your desk are no longer rele-
vant. Your MemoPad is no different. Delete what you don’t need. Highlight
the memo you want to delete from your MemoPad list, press the menu key,
and click Delete from the menu that appears. Ready to say goodbye?
Highlight and select Delete from the confirmation screen. Your memo is gone.
The confirmation screen you see when deleting a memo is a feature common
to all out-of-the-box BlackBerry applications such as Address Book, Tasks,
and Calendar. It diminishes the accidental deletion of records. You can enable
or disable this feature. The ability to disable it is useful when you’re getting
rid of lots of memos and don’t want to be bothered with a confirmation
screen for every memo to be deleted. (But be sure to toggle the feature back
on when you’re finished deleting.)
To turn off this feature, just do the following:
1. On the MemoPad Options screen (see Figure 7-4), select the Confirm
Delete field.
The screen shows your two choices: Yes and No. No means you want to
toggle off the Confirmation screen.
Figure 7-4:
Toggle

120
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

2. Select No.
The MemoPad Options screen updates to show No in the Confirm Delete
field.
3. Press the menu key and then select Save.
The MemoPad application applies the changes you made.
Another field you can see from the MemoPad Options screen is Number of
Entries. This field is just informational, showing you how many memos you
have in your MemoPad application.
Quickly finding a note
Take another look at the left-hand screen in Figure 7-2. See the Find field?
You’ll soon discover that this Find field is always present on the main
MemoPad screen. Next to Find is an entry field. Just like Address Book (see
Chapter 4), you can use this feature to find a note. (Ah, the importance of
good note naming becomes clearer all the time.) Start typing in this Find field
and the note list below shrinks, based on matches. A match is simply a hit,
based on the starting letters of the subjects — from the Title field, as dis-
cussed in the preceding section — in your list. As you type more letters in
the Find field, your MemoPad note list is filtered more. For example, if you
type bi, Find filters the list for those notes with subjects having words that
start with bi, such as birthday, as you can see in Figure 7-5.
Organizing your notes
Although using MemoPad is indeed easy and helpful, you can make using it
more effective by organizing your notes list according to your needs. Like in
Address Book and Tasks, you can group your notes and then filter your notes
list based on a grouping. Simply define a group — a category — and then
assign that category to a note.
Figure 7-5:
Search
notes here.
121
Chapter 7: Making Notes and Calculations

Creating a category
Creating a category is simple. Categories are common to most BlackBerry appli-
cations such as Address Book and Tasks — and, of course, MemoPad. In addi-
tion, categories you create in any of these applications are shared. Whatever
category you see in MemoPad is the same category you see in Tasks or Address
Book. You can access a category from the menu of any of these BlackBerry
applications. To create a category from MemoPad, follow these steps:
1. From the Home screen, select MemoPad.
When MemoPad opens, you see the list of your notes.
2. Press the menu key and then select Filter.
A screen appears that lists all the available categories. By default,
BlackBerry gives you Personal and Business categories. Assuming you
created the Project Phoenix category from Tasks (in Chapter 6), you see
a list, as shown in Figure 7-6.
3. To define a new category, press the menu key and then select New.
A New Category screen appears with a text field.
4. Enter the category name in the text field and then press the trackball.
The new category name appears in the list of category names.
5. Close the screen by pressing the escape key (the arrow key next to the
trackball).
Assigning a category
You can assign categories to your notes when you create a new memo, or you
can edit an existing memo. Either way, the steps are the same. Follow these
steps on editing a memo to assign a category:
1. In MemoPad, highlight the memo you want to edit.
2. Press the menu key, and then select Categories.
Figure 7-6:
Select a
category
here.
122
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

3. From the list of categories that appears, select the category you want.
The highlighted category is checked, which means your memo will be
associated to this category. You can check as many categories as you
want.
4. Press the menu key and then select Save.
The Note screen returns. Although the assignment is now in your memo,
it doesn’t stay until you save the note itself.
5. Press the menu key and then select Save.
Your note is saved, attached to the category you chose.
If you’re working in MemoPad and decide to delete a category, remember that
you also lose that category and all its assignments in the other applications,
such as Address Book. (The Address Book contact is still intact, but it is
missing the category assignment.)
Filtering the list
Time to see just how easy MemoPad can make your life. Finding a note that
belongs to a category (see the preceding section on assigning a note cate-
gory) is just a trackball press away. To filter your notes list for a certain cate-
gory, follow these steps:
1. From the Home screen, select the MemoPad application.
MemoPad opens.
2. Press the menu key and then select Filter.
A screen appears with the available categories.
3. Select the category you want.
Your filtered list appears. Note that the list now has the category name
as the heading, as shown in Figure 7-7.

123
Chapter 7: Making Notes and Calculations

Printing notes
Okay, you got us. Out of the box, you can’t exactly print notes directly from
BlackBerry. However, there is a way. Many companies answered the call to fill
the need; and if you search for a BlackBerry printer online, you see hit after
hit. Following are some solutions:
 Third-party applications (Bluetooth): You install a commercial applica-
tion such as Content Beamer from www.thinprint.com to your
BlackBerry. Such applications use a Bluetooth connection to a printer
that also works with Bluetooth.
 Third-party applications (Internet/e-mail based): A server-based appli-
cation that connects to your e-mail server, it prints any e-mail attach-
ment. In your BlackBerry, you have to install an application allowing you
to send the command to print. A sample of such an application is
PocketWhere for BlackBerry at www.printeron.net.
 Through your desktop PIM software: Even if you buy an application
that allows you to send a command that prints from your BlackBerry,
you still need a computer somewhere to process that command. Having
the Bluetooth option for printing is convenient. If you’re cost conscious,
however, and don’t want to spend more, the best way is to sync your
device with an application such as Outlook or Outlook Express, which
feature an equivalent MemoPad-type application that you can sync with
BlackBerry MemoPad. From that desktop application, you can then print
your notes. In Chapter 16, we describe in detail how to connect your
BlackBerry to a desktop computer and sync information between your
BlackBerry and your desktop application.
Calculator
Sure, calculators are everywhere and readily accessible. You can find them
on day planners, wristwatches, cellphones, and a variety of gizmos. However,
how many devices do you want to tote? If you had to choose just one, you’d
likely choose your cellphone or (because you’re reading this book) your
BlackBerry. Always at the ready, BlackBerry has Calculator.
Of course, Calculator performs just like you expect a calculator to, but stick
with us to see how easily you can use Calculator to convert between metric
and English measurement systems. And finally, we introduce shortcuts that
make using the BlackBerry Calculator a breeze.
124
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Accessing Calculator
Locating the BlackBerry Calculator is easy. For most of the themes,
Calculator is filed in the Applications folder (Figure 7-8, left). In a few themes,
however, such as BB Dimension Icon, Calculator is accessible right on the
Home screen. You can easily pick it out because it looks like an old-fashioned
calculator, as shown on the right of Figure 7-8 in the Cingular theme.
Just like other BlackBerry applications, opening Calculator is a simple matter
of highlighting its name or icon and pressing the trackball or the enter key.
Using Calculator
Calculator has that standard number pad look that you’re used to, as shown in
Figure 7-9. Of course, you can do basic arithmetic operations. Use the trackball
to navigate or highlight the displayed keys in Calculator. Turning the trackball
moves the highlighted keys left or right, depending on the direction you’re
turning. Turning clockwise moves left to right; after you reach the far-right key
on that row, you jump to the far-left key on the row below it. On the bottom-
right key, navigating like this takes you to the topmost row. The opposite
behavior happens when you turn the trackball counterclockwise. Go figure.

125
Chapter 7: Making Notes and Calculations

Turning the trackball while pressing the Alt key (located to the left of the 
Z key) makes the direction of the scroll vertical instead of horizontal. 
(This behavior is common to most BlackBerry apps.)
To do a simple arithmetic operation, such as dividing 24.5 by 3, follow along:
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select Calculator.
Calculator opens.
2. Select the first digit of the first numeral.
In this case, select 2. The numeral appears in the numeral field of the
Calculator screen.
3. If necessary (for a numeral with more than one digit), select the num-
bers for the remainder of the numeral.
To follow along with the example, highlight and press 4, a period, and 5.
The complete numeral appears in the numeral field of the Calculator
screen (24.5).
4. Select the operator sign you want.
For the example, select the division sign, ÷. You won’t see any changes
on-screen. At this point, you’re only telling Calculator that the next
number you’re going to enter is an operand.
5. Select the individual digits of your second numeral.
The second numeral (here, 4) appears in the numeral field.
6. Select the equal sign (=).
You see the results of the operation — 1.5, for this example.
You’ll undoubtedly note some nonnumeric keys in Calculator. Of course,
there are the standard C (Clear) and CE (Clear Entry) keys, but here’s the
scoop on the others:
 MC: Memory Clear; clears the contents of the register
 MR: Memory Recall; reaches to the register and uses the number stored
there
 MS: Memory Save; saves to the register
 M+: Memory Plus; adds a number to the register
 1/x: Invert multiplication (1 divided by the entered number)
126
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

Converting between English 
and metric systems
When you’re faced with an unfamiliar measurement system — say liters
versus gallons or miles versus kilometers — you’ll probably need help con-
verting from one measurement system to another. Conveniently enough, your
BlackBerry Calculator can help you. From its menu, you can quickly convert
measurements from English to metric or vice versa.
Display the conversion menu by pressing the menu key (refer to Figure 7-9).
As an example, to convert 20 kilometers to miles, follow these steps:
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select Calculator.
Calculator opens.
2. Highlight the first digit of the first numeral (2, in this example) and
press the trackball; highlight each remaining digit (0, in this example)
and press the trackball.
Your first numeral (20, here) appears in the numeral field of the
Calculator screen. This is the number you want to convert (from kilo-
meters to miles for this example).
3. Press the menu key and then press the trackball.
The menu screen appears, as shown in Figure 7-10.
4. Select the From Metric menu item.
The menu screen with the conversion choices appears, as shown in
Figure 7-11. Table 7-1 displays these conversion units.
How the arrows point tells you the direction of the conversion. If you
select To Metric compared with From Metric (as in this example), the
arrow direction is reversed.
Figure 7-10:

Using Calculator shortcuts
If you use the BlackBerry Calculator, you’re likely exasperated from the
tediousness of using the trackball to enter numbers and operators. We under-
stand, and we feel your pain. And we’re here to help by letting you in on our
little secret — Calculator keyboard shortcuts.
Most of the keys you see on the Calculator screen — numbers and operators
or the equal sign — have a one-key shortcut. By spending a little bit of time
practicing and familiarizing yourself with these shortcuts, you can use
Calculator with ease. Table 7-2 gives you a detailed mapping as to what these
Figure 7-11:
You can
convert
these 
units in
Calculator.
128
Part II: Getting Organized with Your BlackBerry 

are. Note: These shortcuts are applicable on the classic Calculator screen,
which is common on most models of the BlackBerry. From Table 7-2, you
should have a pretty good idea how to do an arithmetic operation with the
same speed as on a traditional calculator. The first column is the key you
enter, and the second column is the shortcut. The third column gives you a
tip on how to remember the shortcut. In Calculator, you don’t have to press
Shift to produce a number.

Chapter 7: Making Notes and Calculations

On the BlackBerry Pearl, the Calculator screen is probably not the classic
screen, but the shortcuts are much easier to deduce. The Calculator screen
actually looks exactly like the layout of the keys, and each key maps to the
actual key on the screen based on its location.
Just to give a quick demonstration of shortcuts, suppose you want to multi-
ply 35 by 25.7. Instead of using the trackball, use the one-key shortcuts.
Follow these steps:
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select Calculator.
Calculator opens.
2. On your BlackBerry keyboard – not the Calculator number pad —
press the digits of your first numeral (3 and then 5, for this example).
You see the first numeral (35) at the top of the screen.
3. Press the operator shortcut key (refer to Table 7-2).
In this case, press A (the * key on the BlackBerry keyboard, not the
times sign of Calculator).
4. Press the digits of the second numeral, using M as the decimal point if
necessary.
Pressing M enters the decimal point. For this example, you press 2, 5, M,
and 7 to enter 25.7. You see the second numeral (25.7) on-screen.
5. Press enter.
This tells Calculator to do the arithmetic operation you specify. After
pressing enter, you see the result (here, 899.5).
As you can see, using Calculator keyboard shortcuts is a simple one-key oper-
ation, just like using a traditional calculator. Try checking out the other short-
cuts; they’re easy to remember after you try them a few times.

You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail
In This Chapter
 Linking your e-mail accounts to your BlackBerry
 Mastering e-mail basics
 Spell checking your messages
 Searching your e-mail
 Saving messages
Your BlackBerry brings a fresh new face to the convenience and ease of
use that we associate with e-mail. You can direct mail to your BlackBerry
from up to ten e-mail accounts from the likes of Yahoo! and AOL. You can set
up an e-mail signature, configure e-mail filters, and search for e-mails.
In this chapter, we show you how to use and manage the mail capabilities 
of your BlackBerry to their full potential. From setup to sorts, we have you
covered here.
Getting Up and Running with E-Mail
Regardless of your network service provider (such as T-Mobile, or Rogers, or
Vodafone), you can set up your BlackBerry to receive mail from at least one of
your current e-mail accounts. Thus, with whatever address you use to send
and receive e-mail from your PC (Yahoo!, Gmail, and so on), you can hook up
your BlackBerry to use that same e-mail address. Instead of checking your
Gmail at the Google site, for example, you can now get it on your BlackBerry.
Most network service providers allow you to connect up to ten e-mail accounts
to your BlackBerry. This provides you with the convenience of one central
point from which you get all your e-mail, without having to log into multiple
e-mail accounts. Such convenience!

In an enterprise environment, you can’t access the BlackBerry Internet
Service site to link your personal e-mail accounts into your BlackBerry, but
you can still configure e-mail settings (such as the BlackBerry e-mail filter
and BlackBerry e-mail reconciliation) to make your e-mail experience that
much better. If you’re an enterprise user, please skip to the parts where you
see the Enterprise icon for configuring your e-mail settings. If you haven’t set
up e-mail on your company-owned BlackBerry, see the upcoming section,
“Setting up e-mail in an enterprise environment.”
Using the BlackBerry Internet 
Service client
You can pull together all your e-mail accounts into one by using the
BlackBerry Internet Service client (formerly known as the BlackBerry Web
client). The BlackBerry Internet Service client allows you to
 Manage up to ten e-mail accounts: You can combine up to ten of your
e-mail accounts onto your BlackBerry. See the next section, “Combining
your e-mail accounts into one.”
 Use wireless e-mail reconciliation: No more trying to match your
BlackBerry e-mail against e-mail in your combined account(s). Just turn
on wireless e-mail reconciliation and you’re good to go. For more on this,
see the upcoming section, “Enabling wireless reconciliation.”
 Create e-mail filters: You can filter e-mails so that you get only those
messages that you truly care about on your BlackBerry. See the
“Filtering your e-mail” section, near the end of this chapter.
Think of the BlackBerry Internet Service client (Service client) as an online
e-mail account manager, but one that doesn’t keep your e-mails. Instead, it
routes the e-mails from your other accounts to your BlackBerry (because it’s
directly connected to your BlackBerry).
Combining your e-mail accounts into one
To start aggregating e-mail accounts (such as Gmail) onto your BlackBerry,
you must first run a setup program from the BlackBerry Internet Service
client. You can access the Service client from your BlackBerry or from your
desktop computer.
To access the Service client from your PC, you need the URL that is specific
to your network service. Contact your network service provider (T-Mobile,
Verizon, and so on) directly to get that information.
134
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

After you’ve logged into the Service client, you should see a screen similar to
Figure 8-1. If your network provider has activated your BlackBerry, you should
see one e-mail address, the default address of your BlackBerry.
From the Service client, you should see three options on the left navigation bar:
 E-mail Accounts: Here, you can add, edit, and delete e-mail accounts. In
addition, for each e-mail address, you can set up filters and an e-mail 
signature.
 Change Handheld: This option isn’t used frequently. We don’t cover 
it here.
 Service Books: This option isn’t used frequently. We don’t cover it here.
As mentioned, your BlackBerry already has a default e-mail address with
which you can receive and send e-mail. If you don’t have any other e-mail
account that you want to meld into your BlackBerry e-mail account, simply
skip to the upcoming “Customizing Your E-Mail” section.
Adding an e-mail account
You can have up to ten e-mail accounts on your BlackBerry. To add an e-mail
account to your BlackBerry account, follow these steps:
1. From the BlackBerry Internet Service client (refer to Figure 8-1), click
Setup Account.
You see the Add e-mail account screen.
2. Enter the e-mail address and login credentials for that e-mail address.
• The e-mail address is the address from which you want to receive
e-mail, for example, myid@yahoo.com.
Figure 8-1:
Set up an
e-mail
account
here.
135
Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

• The account login is the one you use to log into this particular
e-mail account.
• The password is the one you use with the login.
3. Click the Next button.
You’re finished. It’s that easy!
You can also manage your accounts from your BlackBerry. From the Home
screen, press the menu key and select Set Up Internet E-mail. The rest is
pretty much the same on the BlackBerry as it is on a PC.
We suggest that you first register and create your account by using your PC.
Then for subsequent visits to the BlackBerry Internet Service client, you can
use your BlackBerry. This way, you can minimize any errors or out-of-network
coverage issues while setting up your account.
Setting up e-mail in an 
enterprise environment
This section is intended for those whose BlackBerry can’t receive and send
e-mail yet — like when you first get your BlackBerry or you swap an old one
for a new one. If your e-mail function works properly on your BlackBerry, you
can skip this section.
To activate your BlackBerry for enterprise use:
1. From the Home screen, press the menu key and select Enterprise
Activation.
The Enterprise Activation screen opens, with two fields for you to fill in:
• Your corporate e-mail, for example,
myaccount@abcCompany.com
• The password for that e-mail account
2. Type your corporate e-mail account along with the appropriate 
password.
If you don’t know these pieces of information, contact your corporate
system administrator.
3. Press the menu key and select Activate.
Your BlackBerry attempts to activate your BlackBerry with your 
corporation.
136
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

Some corporations don’t allow any employee-purchased BlackBerries to
be activated with corporate e-mail. Check with your system administra-
tor for corporate BlackBerry policies.
Customizing Your E-Mail
In this section, we go over the details of the following e-mail configurations:
 Configuring an e-mail signature: If you’re tired of writing Regards, 
John Smith over and over to close an e-mail, set an e-mail signature.
 Enabling wireless e-mail reconciliation: After enabling e-mail reconcili-
ation, whatever you see on your BlackBerry is what you get in your
e-mail account(s). You no longer have to double-delete a message in
both your BlackBerry and your e-mail account(s).
 Configuring auto-replies: Whether you are out of the office or just want
a quick response message sent to your senders, this is where you can
specify the message they see. This feature is for enterprise users only.
Configuring your e-mail signature
By default, your e-mail signature is something like “Sent via My BlackBerry,”
which can be cool in the first week, showing off to people that you are a la
mode with your BlackBerry. But sooner or later, you might not want people
to know that you are out and about while answering e-mail. Or you might
want something more personal. Follow these steps to configure your e-mail
signature by using the Service client:
1. Log into Service client on your PC.
The BlackBerry Internet Service client appears (refer to Figure 8-1). 
2. Click the Edit icon for the desired e-mail account.
The edit screen appears, as shown in Figure 8-2.
3. In the Signature field, type the desired text for your e-mail signature.
4. Click Save.
If you work in an enterprise environment, you might need to perform these
steps directly on your BlackBerry. Keep in mind that you can set up an e-mail
signature on your BlackBerry only if your company is using BlackBerry
Enterprise Server (BES) 4.0 or later. Check with your BlackBerry system
administrator to see what version of BES your company uses.
137
Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

Here’s how:
1. Open the Messages application.
You see a list of e-mails (the message list).
2. Press the menu key and select Options.
3. From the Options screen, select Email Settings.
Here you see a list of e-mail setting options.
4. Highlight the Use Auto Signature field, press the trackball, and 
select Yes.
Doing so enables your e-mail signature.
5. In the text box at the bottom of the screen, type your e-mail signature
(see Figure 8-3).
6. Confirm your changes by pressing the menu key and selecting Save.
Enabling wireless reconciliation
With wireless reconciliation, you don’t need to delete the same e-mail in two
places. The two e-mail In Boxes reconcile with each other, hence the term
wireless reconciliation. Convenient, huh?

Enabling wireless e-mail synchronization
You can start wireless e-mail synchronization by configuring your BlackBerry:
1. From the Home screen, press the menu key and select Messages.
This opens the Messages application. You see the message list.
2. In the message list, press the menu key and select Options.
The Options screen appears, with two option types: General Options
and Email Reconciliation.
3. Select Email Reconciliation.
This opens the Email Reconciliation screen, which has the following
options:
• Delete On: Configures how BlackBerry handles your e-mail 
deletion.
• Wireless Reconciliation: Turns on or off the wireless sync function.
• On Conflict: Controls how BlackBerry handles any inconsistencies
between e-mail on your BlackBerry and the BlackBerry Internet
Service client.
You can choose who “wins” via this option: your BlackBerry or the
BlackBerry Internet Service client.
4. Select Delete On, and then select one of the following from the drop-
down list:
• Handheld: A delete on your BlackBerry takes effect on your
BlackBerry only.
• Mailbox & Handheld: A delete on your BlackBerry takes effect on
both your BlackBerry and your inbox on the BlackBerry Internet
Service client.
• Prompt: This option prompts your BlackBerry to ask you at the
time of deletion.
5. Select Wireless Reconciliation, and then select On from the drop-
down list.
6. Select On Conflict, and make a selection from the drop-down list.
If you choose Handheld Wins, the e-mail messages in your e-mail
account will match the ones on the handheld.
Unfortunately, some e-mail accounts might not work well with the e-mail 
reconciliation feature of the BlackBerry, so you might have to delete an 
e-mail twice.
139
Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

Permanently deleting e-mail from your BlackBerry
When deleting e-mail on your BlackBerry, the same message in that e-mail
account is placed in the Deleted folder. You can set up your BlackBerry to
permanently delete e-mail, but use this option with caution — after that
e-mail is gone, it’s gone. 
To permanently delete e-mail on your Service client from your BlackBerry,
follow these steps:
1. Open the Messages application. 
2. In the message list, press the menu key and select Options.
3. In the Options screen, select Email Reconciliation.
4. In the Email Reconciliation screen, press the menu key and select
Purge Deleted Items.
You see all your e-mail accounts.
5. Choose the e-mail account from which you want to purge deleted
items.
A screen appears, warning that you are about to purge deleted e-mails
on your Service client.
6. Select Yes.
Deleted e-mails in the selected e-mail account are purged.
Unfortunately, some e-mail accounts might not work with the purge deleted
items feature. 
Automating replies and out-of-office 
messages (for enterprise users)
Setting an auto-reply for your e-mail is easy on the BlackBerry. Whether you
need to acknowledge incoming e-mail to senders or establish an out-of-office
reply, you can set it up via this feature:
1. Open the Messages application.
You see a list of e-mails (the message list).
2. Press the menu key and select Options.
140
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

3. From the Options screen, select Email Settings.
You see a list of e-mail setting options.
4. Highlight the Use Out of Office Reply field, press the trackball, and
select Yes.
Auto Reply is enabled.
5. In the text box at the bottom of the screen, type your auto-reply 
message.
6. Confirm your changes by pressing the menu key and then 
selecting Save.
Accessing Messages
From Messages, you send and receive your e-mails and also configure wire-
less e-mail reconciliation with your e-mail account(s). 
To access Messages, press the menu key from the Home screen and select
Messages. The first thing you see after opening Messages is the message list.
Your message list can contain e-mail, voice mail messages, missed phone call
notices, Short Messaging Service (SMS) messages, and even saved Web pages.
Receiving e-mails
Whether you’re concerned about security or speed of delivery, with
BlackBerry’s up-to-date secured network, you’re in good hands when receiv-
ing e-mail on your BlackBerry.
And whether you’ve aggregated accounts or just use the plain-vanilla
BlackBerry e-mail account, you receive your e-mail the same way. When you
receive an e-mail message, your BlackBerry notifies you by displaying a
numeral next to a mail icon (an envelope) at the top of the screen. This
number represents how many new (unread) e-mails you have. See Figure 8-4.
The asterisk next to the envelope indicates that there is new mail and you
haven’t opened the Messages application yet. 
Your BlackBerry can also notify you of new e-mail by vibration or a sound
alert or both. You can customize this from the Profile application, as we
detail in Chapter 3.
141
Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

Retrieving e-mail
Retrieving your e-mail is simple:
1. From the Home screen, press the menu key and select Messages.
Doing so allows you to view your message list.
2. In the message list, scroll to any e-mail and press the trackball.
You can tell whether an e-mail is unopened by the small unopened enve-
lope icon on the left side of the e-mail. A read e-mail bears an opened
envelope icon, a sent e-mail has a check mark as its icon, and a docu-
ment icon represents a draft e-mail.
3. After you finish reading the message, press the escape key to return
to the message list.
Sorting the message list
The BlackBerry lists items in order by the date and time they were received,
but you can sort by different criteria. For example, to see only incoming
e-mail, press Alt+U (Alt+I on 72xx models). 
Sorting and searching are closely related on your BlackBerry. In a sense,
searching is really sorting your e-mail based on your search criteria. On the
BlackBerry, you can search your e-mail by the name of the sender or by key-
words. Or you could run a search as broad as looking through all the e-mail
that has been sent to you. See the later section, “Searching through Messages
Like a Pro,” for more on searching and sorting. For more predefined hot keys,
see the upcoming section, “Reusing savedsearches.”
Saving a message to the saved folder
You can save any important e-mail in a folder so you can find it without sort-
ing through tons of e-mail. To do so, simply scroll to the e-mail you want to
save, press the menu key, and select Save from the menu. A pop-up message
confirms that your e-mail has been saved. Note: Your saved e-mail still
remains in the message list.
Figure 8-4:
You’ve got
(3) e-mails!
142
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

To retrieve or view a saved e-mail, follow these steps:
1. Open the Messages application. 
2. In the message list, press the menu key and select View Saved Messages.
You see the list of all the messages you saved.
3. Select the message you want and press the trackball to open it.
Viewing attachments
Your BlackBerry is so versatile that you can view most e-mail attachments
just like you can on a desktop PC. And we’re talking sizeable attachments,
too, such as JPEGs (photos), Word docs, PowerPoint slides, and Excel spread-
sheets. Table 8-1 has a list of supported attachments viewable from your
BlackBerry.

Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

However versatile your BlackBerry is, you can’t create certain types of
attachments (MS Word, Excel, PDF) without help from third-party software.
Please refer to Chapter 21 for a productivity program that can help you
create Word docs and Excel spreadsheets right from your BlackBerry and
attach them in an e-mail for you to send. To find out how to attach pictures
stored on your BlackBerry, see Chapter 12.
To tell whether an e-mail has an attachment, look for the standard paperclip
icon next to your e-mail in the message list.
You retrieve all the different types of attachments the same way. This makes
retrieving attachments an easy task. To open an attachment, follow along:
1. While reading an e-mail, press the menu key and select Open
Attachment.
You see a screen containing the name of the file, a Table of Contents
option, and a Full Contents option. For MS Word documents, you can see
different headings in outline form in the Table of Contents option. For
picture files, such as a JPEG, you can simply go straight to the Full
Contents option to see the graphic.
For all supported file types, you see Table of Contents and Full Contents
as options. Depending on the file type, use your judgment on when you
should use the Table of Contents option.
2. Scroll to Full Contents, press the menu key, and select Retrieve.
Your BlackBerry attempts to contact the BlackBerry Internet Service
client to retrieve your attachment. This retrieves only part of your
attachment. As you peruse a document, BlackBerry retrieves more as
you scroll through the attachment. 
Sending e-mail
The first thing you probably want to do when you get your BlackBerry is to
write an e-mail to let your friends know that you’ve just gotten a BlackBerry.
Follow these steps:
1. Open the Messages application. 
2. In the message list, press the menu key and select Compose Email.
You are prompted with a blank e-mail that you just need to fill out as you
would do on your PC.
3. In the To field, type the recipient’s name or e-mail address.
As you type, you see a list of contacts from your Address Book matching
the name or address that you’re typing. You can make a selection from
this list.
144
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

4. Type your message subject and body.
5. When you’re finished, press the menu key and select Send.
Your message has wings.
Forwarding e-mail
When you need to share an important e-mail with a colleague or a friend, you
can forward that e-mail. Simply do the following:
1. Open the e-mail.
For information on opening e-mail, see the previous section, “Retrieving
e-mail.”
2. Press the menu key and select Forward.
3. Type the recipient’s name or e-mail address in the appropriate space,
and then add a message if needed.
When you start typing your recipient’s name, a drop-down list of your
contacts appears and you can choose from it.
4. Press the menu key and select Send.
Your message is on its way to your recipient.
Sending e-mail to more than one person
When you need to send an e-mail to more than one person, just keep adding
recipient names as needed. You can also add recipient names to receive a CC
(carbon copy) or BCC (blind carbon copy). Here’s how:
1. Open the e-mail.
For information on opening e-mail, see the previous section, “Retrieving
e-mail.”
2. Press the menu key and select Compose Email.
3. Specify the To field for the e-mail recipient and then press the 
return key.
By pressing the return key, another To field is added automatically
below the first. The Cc field works the same way. 
4. To add a Bcc recipient, press the menu key and select Add Bcc:
You see a Bcc: field. You can specify a Bcc recipient the same way you
do To and Cc recipients.
Whether you are composing a new e-mail, replying, or forwarding an e-mail,
the way you add new Cc and Bcc fields is the same.
145
Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

Saving a draft e-mail
Sometimes the most skillful wordsmiths find themselves lost for words to
express the message they want. Don’t fret, fellow wordsmith, you can save
that e-mail composition as a draft until your words come back to you. You
only need to press the menu key and select Save Draft.
This saves your e-mail as a draft. When you’re ready to send your message,
choose the draft from the message list. You can tell which messages are
drafts because they sport a tiny document icon; finished messages have an
envelope icon. 
Spell checking your outgoing messages
Whether you are composing an e-mail message or an SMS text message (see
Chapter 9), you can always check your spelling with the built-in spell checker.
Simply press the menu key and select Check Spelling. When it finds an error,
the BlackBerry spell checker makes a suggestion, as shown in Figure 8-5. If
you want to skip the spell check for that word and go on to the next word,
press the escape key.
If you don’t see Check Spelling in the menu, your BlackBerry doesn’t have
this feature. Refer to Chapter 21 for info on how to get a third-party spell
checker.
Adding a sender to your Address Book
You can add a message sender’s contact info to your BlackBerry Address
Book directly from Messages. You don’t even have to copy or write down the
person’s name and e-mail address on paper.
Figure 8-5:
The
BlackBerry
spell
checker 
in action.
146
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

To add a sender to your Address Book, follow these steps:
1. From the Home screen, press the menu key and select Messages.
2. In the message list, scroll to an e-mail and press the trackball.
3. From the open e-mail, scroll to the sender’s name, press the trackball,
and then choose Add to Address Book.
The New Address screen opens. The sender’s first name, last name, and
e-mail address are transferred automatically to your Address Book.
4. If needed, add any additional information (such as phone number and
mailing address).
5. Press the menu key and select Save.
Deleting e-mail
Keeping your message list tidy can help you stay organized and reduce the
amount of memory your e-mail takes. Cull those messages you no longer
need by following these steps:
1. From the Home screen, press the menu key and select Messages.
2. In the message list, highlight the e-mail you want to delete, and then
press the Delete key.
A deletion confirmation window appears.
3. Select Delete to confirm your deletion.
The deleted e-mail is toast.
To delete more than one e-mail, press the cap key and scroll to highlight as
many e-mails as you want. After you make your deletion selections, press the
Delete key.
You can delete anything listed in the message list (such as an SMS or a voice
mail) in the same way you delete an e-mail message.
If you want to really clean up your old e-mails and you don’t want to scroll
through tons of messages, you can do the following.
1. Open the Messages application.
2. From the message list, highlight a horizontal date mark, press the
menu key, and choose Delete Prior.
147
Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

The date mark is simply a horizontal bar with dates. Just like you can
highlight e-mails in the message list, you can also highlight the date mark.
A pop-up appears, prompting you for delete confirmation.
Before you take the plunge, remember that going ahead will delete all 
the e-mails before the particular date mark. There is no way to retrieve
deleted items from your BlackBerry.
3. Select Delete to confirm your deletion.
All your e-mails prior to the date mark are history.
Filtering your e-mail
Most of us get e-mail that isn’t urgent or doesn’t really concern us. Instead of
receiving them on your BlackBerry — and wasting both time and effort to
check them — you can filter them out. While in the BlackBerry Internet
Service client, set up filters to make your BlackBerry mailbox receive only
those e-mails that you care about. (Don’t worry; you’ll still receive them on
your main computer.)
We’ll create a simple filter that treats work-related messages as urgent and
forwards them to your BlackBerry. Follow these steps:
1. Log into the BlackBerry Internet Service client (refer to Figure 8-1).
2. Click the Filter icon for the desired e-mail account.
The Filter screen that appears shows a list of filters that have been 
created. See Figure 8-6. 
3. Click the Click here link.
The Add Filter screen appears, as shown in Figure 8-7.
Figure 8-6:
Filter list
screen.
148
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

4. Enter a filter name.
The filter name can be anything you like. We entered WorkUrgent.
5. In the Apply Filter When drop-down list, choose the condition to place
on the filter:
• A high-priority mail arrives: Select this option if the filter applies
only to urgent e-mail.
• Subject field contains: When selected, the Contains field is enabled
(you can type text in it). You can specify what keywords the filter
will look for in the subject field. Separate each entry with a semi-
colon (;).
• From field contains: When selected, the Contains field is enabled
(you can type text in it). You can type full addresses or part of an
address. For example, you can type rob@robkao.com or just kao.
Separate each entry with a semicolon (;).
• To field contains: Similar to From field contains.
• CC field contains: Similar to From field contains. 
For our example, select From field contains.
6. Specify the text in the Contains field.
See details in the preceding step for what to enter in the Contains field.
Continuing our example, type the domain of your work e-mail address.
For example, if your work e-mail address is myName@XYZCo.com, enter
XYZCo.com.
Figure 8-7:
Create 
a filter 
for your
e-mail here.
149
Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

7. Select one of the following options:
Forward Messages to Handheld: You can select either or both of the 
following two check boxes:
• Header Only: Choose this if you want only the header of the e-mails
that meets the condition(s) you set in Steps 3, 4, and 5 to be sent
to you. (A header doesn’t contain the body of the e-mail — just
who sent it, the subject, and the time it was sent.) You would
choose this if you get automated alerts, where receiving only the
subject is sufficient.
• Level 1 Notification: Level1 notification is another way of saying
urgent e-mail. When you receive a Level1 e-mail, it is bold in
Messages.
Do Not Forward Message to Handheld: Selecting this means that any
e-mail that meets the conditions you set in Steps 3, 4, and 5 are not sent
to your BlackBerry.
8. Confirm your filter by clicking the Add Filter button.
You return to the Filter screen, where you can see your newly created
filter in the list.
If you have a hard time setting the criteria for a filter, just take a best guess
and then check it by having a friend send you a test e-mail. If the test e-mail
doesn’t get filtered correctly, set the conditions until you get them right.
As mentioned, in an enterprise environment, you don’t have access to
BlackBerry Internet Service, but that doesn’t meant you can’t perform func-
tions such as e-mail filtering. In fact, in an enterprise environment, you can
conveniently configure e-mail filters directly from your BlackBerry:
1. Open the Messages application.
You see a list of e-mails (the message list).
2. Press the menu key and then select Options.
3. Select Email Filters.
You are prompted with the Email Filters screen, which lists current
e-mail filters. (If you haven’t set up any filters, you see an empty list.)
4. From the Email Filters screen, press the menu key and then 
select New.
A new e-mail Filter screen opens, as shown in Figure 8-8, from which you
can specify how you want your e-mails filtered.
150
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

5. Fill in the new Filter screen.
You can either type the name of the person or make a selection from
Address Book. To retrieve a contact from Address Book, highlight the
From or Sent to field, press the menu key, and select Select Name.
This takes you to Address Book, where you can select your contact. 
• If you have contacts in your Address Book: Highlight the contact you
want and then press the trackball.
• If you don’t have contacts or if the one you want isn’t in your Address
Book: If you know the name of the contact, you can simply type the
info in the From or Sent to field on the Filter screen.
After you make this selection, press the menu key and select Continue.
You return to the Filter screen.

you are CCed on.
 BCC to Me: Select this check box to specify the condition of an e-mail
that is BCCed to you.
 Importance: Choose Normal or Urgent from this drop-down list.

If you choose Forward, you have two more check boxes:
• Level1 Notification: Level1 notification is another way of saying
urgent e-mail. When you receive a Level1 e-mail, it is bold in
Messages.
• Header Only: Choose this if you want only the header of the e-mail
that meets the condition(s) you set to be sent to you. You would
choose this if you get automated alerts, and receiving only the 
subject is sufficient.
If you choose Do Not Forward, e-mail message that meet the conditions
you set are not forwarded to your BlackBerry.

Searching through Messages Like a Pro
Searching is one of those functions you probably won’t use every day — but
when you do run a search, you usually need the information fast. Take a few
minutes here to familiarize yourself with general searching. 
The BlackBerry Messages application provides three ways to search through
your messages. Two of the three ways are specific, and one is a broad search:
 Search by sender or recipient: Specific. This method assumes that you
already know the sender or recipient.
 Search by subject: Specific. This approach assumes that you already
know the subject.
 Search by keyword: Broad. You don’t have a specific assumption.
You can search through anything listed in the messages list. This means you
can search through SMS and voice mail as well as e-mail.
Searching by sender or recipient
Search by sender or recipient when you’re looking for a specific message
from a specific person. For example, suppose your brother constantly sends
you e-mail (which means your message list has many entries from him).
You’re trying to locate a message he sent you approximately two weeks ago
regarding a fishing trip location. You’ve scrolled down the message list, but
you just can’t seem to find that message. Or maybe you want to find a mes-
sage you sent to Sue but can’t lay your hands on it.
152
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

To find a message when you know the sender or recipient, follow these steps:
1. Open the Messages application.
2. In the message list, highlight a message that you sent to or received
from that particular person.
The choice you get in the next step depends on whether you highlighted
a sent message or a received message.
3. Press the menu key and then select one of these options:
• From someone specific: Because that certain someone sent you the
message, choose Search Sender.
• To someone specific: Because you sent that certain someone the
message, choose Search Recipient.
This starts the search. Any results appear on-screen.
Searching by subject
Search by subject when you’re looking for an e-mail titled by a specific sub-
ject that you already know. As is the case when running a search by sender or
recipient, first scroll to an e-mail bearing the same subject you’re searching
for. Then follow these steps:
1. Open the Messages application.
2. In the message list, highlight an e-mail titled by the specific subject
you’re searching for.
3. Press the menu key and then select Search Subject.
The search starts, and the results appear on-screen.
Running a general search
A general search is a broad search from which you can perform keyword
searches of your messages. To run a general search:
1. Open the Messages application.
2. In the message list, press the menu key and then select Search.
3. In the Search screen that appears, fill in your search criteria 
(see Figure 8-9).
153
Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

The search criteria for a general search follow:
• Name: This is the name of the sender or recipient to search by.
• In: This is related to the Name criterion. Use this drop-down to
indicate where the name might appear, such as in the To or Cc
field. From the drop-down list, your choices are From, To, Cc, Bcc,
and any address field.
• Subject: This is where you type some or all the keywords that
appear in the subject.
• Message: Here you enter keywords that appear in the message.
• Service: If you set up your BlackBerry to receive e-mail from more
than one e-mail account, you can specify which e-mail account to
search.
• Folder: This is the folder in which you want to perform the search.
Generally, you should search all folders.
• Show: This drop-down list specifies how the search result will
appear, namely, whether you want to see only e-mails that you sent
or e-mails that you received. From the drop-down list, your choices
are Send and Received, Received Only, Sent Only, Saved Only, Draft
Only, and Unopened Only.
• Type: This drop-down list specifies the type of message that you’re
trying to search for: e-mail, SMS, or voice mail. From the drop-
down list, your choices are: All, Email, Email with Attachments,
PIN, SMS, Phone, and Voice Mail.
From the Search screen shown in Figure 8-9, you can have multiple
search criteria or just a single one (up to you).
4. Press the menu key and then select Search to launch your search.
The search results appear on-screen.
Figure 8-9:
The Search
screen in

Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

You can narrow the search results by performing a second search on the ini-
tial results. For example, you can search by sender and then narrow those
hits by performing a second search by subject.
You can also search by sender or recipient when you’re looking for a specific
message from a specific person. To do so, scroll to an e-mail bearing the spe-
cific sender or recipient. Press the menu key and select Search Sender or
Search Recipient. If the e-mail that you highlighted is an incoming e-mail,
you’ll see Search Sender. If the e-mail is outgoing, you’ll see Search Recipient.
Saving search results
If you find yourself re-searching with the same criteria over and over, you
might want to save the search and then reuse it. Here’s how:
1. Follow Steps 1 through 3 in the “Running a general search” section
for an outgoing e-mail search. 
2. Press the menu key and then select Save.
The Save Search screen appears, from which you can name your search
and assign it a shortcut key. See Figure 8-10.
3. In the Title field, enter a name.
The title is the name of your search, which appears in the Search Result
screen.
4. Scroll to the Shortcut Key field, press the trackball, and select a letter
from the drop-down list.
You have ten letters to choose from.
5. Confirm your saved search by pressing the menu key and 
selecting Save.

Chapter 8: You’ve Got (Lots of) E-Mail

Reusing saved searches 
Right out of the box, your BlackBerry comes with five saved search results.
Any new saved result will make your search that much more robust.
To see all saved search results:
1. Open the Messages application.
2. In the message list, press the menu key and select Search.
3. Press the menu key and then select Recall.
The recall screen opens, and you can see the five preloaded search
shortcuts, as shown in Figure 8-11.
To reuse one of saved search results, simply select a desired search from the
list in Figure 8-11, press the menu key, and select Search.
Long Live E-Mail
No closet has unlimited space, and your BlackBerry e-mail storage has limits,
too. You’ve likely pondered how long your e-mails are kept in your BlackBerry.
(The default is 30 days. Pshew.) You can choose several options: from 15 days
to forever (well, for as long as your BlackBerry has enough space for them).
Because any message you save is kept for as long as you want, a good way to
make sure you don’t lose an important message is to save it.
Figure 8-11:

Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

To change how long your e-mails live on your BlackBerry, follow these steps:
1. Open the Messages application. 
2. Press the menu key and select Options.
3. Select General Options. 
4. Scroll to the Keep Messages option and then press the trackball.
5. From the drop-down list that appears, choose the time frame that you
want and then press the trackball.
• Forever: If you choose Forever, you’ll seldom need to worry about
your e-mails being automatically deleted. On the downside,
though, your BlackBerry will eventually run out of memory. At that
point, you must manually delete some e-mail so that you have
space to accept new e-mail.
A good way to archive your e-mail is to back up your e-mails by
using BlackBerry Desktop Manager. See Chapter 19 for more on
backing up your BlackBerry on your PC.
• Time option: If you choose a set time option, any message older
than that time frame is automatically deleted from your BlackBerry
the next time you reboot your BlackBerry. However, it will be
deleted only on your BlackBerry — even if you turn on e-mail 
reconciliation — because these deletions are not completed 
manually by you.

 Sending PIN-to-PIN messages
 Using Short and Multimedia Messaging Service (SMS)
 Setting up and using Instant Messenger (IM)
 Figuring out messaging etiquette
Your BlackBerry is primarily a communication tool, with e-mail messages
and phone conversations as the major drivers. Being the social creatures
that we are, however, we constantly come up with new ways to communicate —
ever more ways to overcome the distance barrier, as it were. You shouldn’t be
surprised that the folks at RIM have moved beyond e-mail and phoning in their
search for other ways to communicate. (And we’re not talking semaphore or
stringing together two tin cups.)
Not that we’re dismissing the power of phones and e-mail. Both are wonder-
ful technologies, but you might find yourself in a situation where other means
of communication would be more appropriate. For instance, e-mail isn’t the
tool of choice for instant messaging/chatting — most people would find that
method slow and cumbersome. Nor is e-mail the best tool to use when you
want to alert someone.
“What might be a better fit?” you ask. Read this chapter to find out. You 
can familiarize yourself with some less obvious ways you can use your
BlackBerry to communicate — ways that might serve as the perfect fit for a
special situation. You get the inside scoop on PIN-to-PIN messaging and text
messaging (also known as Short Messaging Service, or SMS). We also give you
tips on how to turn your BlackBerry into a lean (and not so mean) instant
messaging machine.
A Little Bit of RIM Prehistory
Time for a history lesson. Sometime during the last millennium, Research In
Motion (RIM) wasn’t even doing phone. Before BlackBerry became all the
rage today with SmartPhone features, RIM was doing a tidy little business

with its wireless e-mail. Back then, RIM’s primitive wireless e-mail service was
served by network service providers on a radio bandwidth, namely DataTAC
and Mobitex networks. These were separate from the bandwidth that a typi-
cal cellphone infrastructure would use. RIM devices at that time already had
PIN-to-PIN messaging (more about that later). This type of messaging is akin
to a pager, where a message does not reside in a mailbox and is instead sent
directly to the BlackBerry without any delay, so it’s fast. (No one wants a
paging system that moves at turtle speed when they can get jack rabbit
speed, right?)
Several interesting facts followed from RIM’s initial decision here. Of note,
most cellphone users in New York City were left without service during the
9/11 disaster. As you can understand, the entire cellphone infrastructure in
New York and surrounding areas was overwhelmed when faced with too
many people trying to use the bandwidth available. However, one communi-
cation device continued to work during that stressful time — RIM’s PIN-to-PIN
messaging kept the information flow going.
Now, this may sound like ancient history, but the point here is that the back-
bone RIM built during that time is still used in your BlackBerry today. When you
send a PIN-to-PIN message, it makes its way to its destination pretty darn fast.
But enough with the history lesson. Time to take a look at how PIN-to-PIN
messaging can help you today.
Sending and Receiving 
PIN-to-PIN Messages
What happens when you use PIN-to-PIN messaging? First and foremost, get
the acronym out of the way. PIN stands for personal identification number
(familiar to anyone who’s ever used an ATM) and refers to a system for
uniquely identifying your device. PIN-to-PIN, then, is another way of saying
one BlackBerry to another BlackBerry.
As for the other details, they’re straightforward. PIN-to-PIN messaging is
based on the technology underpinning two-way pager systems. Unlike send-
ing a standard e-mail, when you send a PIN-to-PIN message, the message
doesn’t venture outside RIM’s infrastructure in search of an e-mail server and
(eventually) an e-mail inbox. Instead, it stays solidly in the RIM world, where
it is shunted through the recipient’s network provider until it ends up on the
recipient’s BlackBerry.
160
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

Here’s the neat part. According to RIM, the message isn’t saved anywhere in
this universe except on the one device that sends the PIN message and the
other device that receives it. Compare that with an e-mail, which is saved in
at least four separate locations (the mail client and e-mail servers of both
sender and recipient) not to mention all the system’s redundancies and back-
ups employed by the server. Think of it this way: If you whisper a little secret
in someone’s ear, only you and that special someone know what was said. In
a way, PIN-to-PIN messaging is the same thing, with one BlackBerry whisper-
ing to another BlackBerry. Now, that’s discreet.
If you tend to read the financial newspapers — especially the ones that cover
corporate lawsuits extensively — you’ll know that there’s no such thing as
privacy in e-mail. PIN-to-PIN messaging, in theory at least, is as good as the
old Code of Silence. Now, is such privacy really an advantage? You can argue
both sides of the issue, depending on what you want to use PIN-to-PIN mes-
saging for. Basically, if you like the idea that your communications can be
kept discreet, PIN-to-PIN messaging has great curb appeal. If you don’t care
about privacy issues, though, you still might be impressed by PIN-to-PIN mes-
saging’s zippy nature. (It really is the Ferrari of wireless communication —
way faster than e-mail.)
Getting a BlackBerry PIN
When trying to call somebody on the telephone, you can’t get far without a
telephone number. As you might expect, the same principle applies to PIN-to-
PIN messaging: No PIN, no PIN-to-PIN messaging. In practical terms, this
means you need the individual PIN of any BlackBerry device owned by
whomever you want to send a PIN message to. (You also need to find out
your own PIN so you can hand it out to those folks who want to PIN-message
you.) The cautious side of you might be thinking, why on earth would I give
my PIN to somebody? This PIN is really not the same as your password. In
fact, this PIN doesn’t give anybody access to your BlackBerry or do anything
to compromise security. It’s simply an identification; you treat it the same
way as you treat your phone number.
RIM makes getting hold of a PIN easy. In fact, RIM even provides you with
multiple paths to PIN enlightenment, as the following list makes clear:
 From the Help screen: You can find the PIN for any device right there 
on its Help screen. On most BlackBerry models, you can call up the Help
screen by pressing Alt+Num+H. This shortcut to the Help screen is not
available on BlackBerry Pearl.
 From the Message screen: RIM also makes it easy for you to send your
PIN from the Message screen with the help of a keyword. A keyword is a
neat feature with which you type a preset word, and your BlackBerry
replaces what you type with a bit of information specific to your device.
161
Chapter 9: Too Cool for E-Mail

Sound wacky? It’s actually easier than it sounds. To see what we mean,
just compose a new message. (Chapter 8 gives you the basics on the
whole e-mail message and messaging thing, if you need a refresher.) On
the subject or body of your message, type mypin and add a space. As
soon as you type the space, mypin is miraculously transformed into
your PIN in the format pin:your-pin-number, as shown in Figure 9-1.
Isn’t that neat?
mypin isn’t the only keyword that RIM predefines for you.
 From the Status screen: You can find your PIN also on the Status screen.
On most BlackBerry models, you display the Status screen by choosing
the following links starting from the Home screen: Settings, Options, and
Status. Use the trackball to highlight and click the link. Figure 9-2 shows
a typical Status screen. (The PIN is fifth on the list of items shown.)
Assigning PINs to names
So, you convince your BlackBerry-wielding buddies to go to the trouble of
finding out their PINs and passing said PINs to you. Now the trick is finding a
convenient place to store your PINs so you can use them. Luckily for you, you
have an obvious choice: the BlackBerry Address Book. And RIM, in its infinite

162

wisdom, makes storing such info a snap, just like the following steps show. To
add a PIN to someone’s contact info in Address Book, do the following:
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select Address Book.
Address Book opens.
2. Highlight a contact name, press the menu key, and then select Edit.
The Edit Address screen for the contact name you selected makes an
appearance.
3. On the Edit Address screen, scroll down to the PIN field (as shown in
Figure 9-3).
4. Enter the PIN by pressing letters and numbers on the keyboard.
5. Press the menu key and then select Save.
The edit you made for this contact is now saved.
It’s that simple. Of course, it’s even easier if you think ahead and enter the
PIN information you have when you set up your initial contact info (by using
the New Address screen), but we understand that a PIN isn’t usually the kind
of info your causal acquaintances carry around with them.
If all this talk about New Address screens and Edit Address screens doesn’t
sound familiar, check out Chapter 4, which covers the Address Book applica-
tion in more detail.
Sending a PIN-to-PIN message
Sending a PIN-to-PIN message is no different than sending an e-mail. Here’s how:
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select Address Book.
Address Book opens.
Figure 9-3:
Add a
contact’s
PIN info
here.
163
Chapter 9: Too Cool for E-Mail

2. Highlight a contact name and then press the menu key.
If a contact has a PIN, you see a menu item titled PIN <contact name>.
Say, for example, you have a contact named Dante Sarigumba. When you
highlight Dante Sarigumba in the list and then press the menu key, the
menu item PIN Dante Sarigumba appears as an option, as shown in
Figure 9-4.
3. Select PIN <contact name> from the menu.
The ever-familiar New Message screen, with the PIN of your buddy
already entered as an address, makes an appearance.
4. Treat the other e-mail-creation stuff — adding a subject line, entering
the body of your message, and then signing off — just as you would
with a normal e-mail.
Alternatively, if you know the PIN, you can also type it directly. Here’s how:
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select Messages.
The Messages application opens.
2. Press the menu key and then select Compose PIN.
The ever-familiar New Message screen makes an appearance.
3. In the To field, enter the PIN and then press the trackball.
You just added a recipient in the To field.
4. Add a subject line, enter the body of your message, and sign off just
like you would in a normal e-mail.
Because of the nature of PIN-to-PIN messaging (the conspicuous lack of a
paper trail, as it were), RIM has set it up so that companies can disable PIN-
to-PIN messaging on your BlackBerry device. (No paper trail can mean legal
problems down the road — can you say Sarbanes-Oxley?) If your BlackBerry
Figure 9-4:
Send a PIN
message 
via your
Address
Book.
164
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

is from your employer and you don’t see the PIN menu item allowing you to
send PIN-to-PIN messages, you can safely assume that your employer has dis-
abled it. Contact your BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) administrator to
make sure. (See Chapter 1 for an explanation of BES.) Keep in mind that even
if your company has disabled PIN-to-PIN messaging, folks can still PIN you —
you just won’t be able to PIN them back in response.
Receiving a PIN-to-PIN message
Receiving a PIN-to-PIN message is no different than receiving a standard
e-mail. You get the same entry into your Messages list for the PIN-to-PIN 
message that you receive, and the same message screen appears when you
open the message. By default, your BlackBerry will vibrate to alert you, but
this behavior can be customized in Profiles. In Profiles, PIN-to-PIN is a Level1
Message. (Check Chapter 3 for more details on changing your profile.) When
you reply to the message, the reply is a PIN-to-PIN message as well — that 
is, as long as your BlackBerry is set up to send PIN-to-PIN messages. Again,
because this involves a BlackBerry-to-BlackBerry communication, you won’t
see a PIN message show up on your desktop’s e-mail client’s inbox.
Regardless of whether your BlackBerry is enabled for sending PIN-to-PIN 
messages, you can always receive a PIN message. BES administrators can
mandate that you can’t send PIN messages, but that can’t stop you from
receiving them.
Keeping in Touch, the SMS/MMS Way
Short Messaging Service (also known as SMS, or simply text messaging) is 
so popular these days that you see it used in many TV shows, including the
Fox Network’s American Idol, which lets you vote for the show’s contestants
by using SMS. Moreover, SMS is an established technology (not a new and
unproven thing, in other words) that has been popular for years in Europe
and Asia, where the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) is the
technology of choice among cellphone network providers. How short is
short? The maximum size per message is about 160 characters. If you send
more than that, it gets broken down into multiple messages.
Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is the latest evolution of SMS. 
Rather than a simple text message, you can also send someone an audio 
or a video clip.
165
Chapter 9: Too Cool for E-Mail

Whether you call it SMS, Short Messaging Service, or just plain text messag-
ing, your BlackBerry makes it simple. But before we go over the details, we
want to point out to all you BlackBerry Pearl owners that text messaging
does pose a challenge for beginners. It’s not that it’s a difficult task; it’s just
that it’s cumbersome to type the letters by using the limited keypad.
Also, you need to be aware of the trends and options for text messaging.
There is a growing SMS subculture among teenagers and those who jumped
onto the bandwagon early. These in-the-know folks use abbreviations that
might be difficult for you to understand in the beginning, so don’t dive in with-
out your oxygen tank. A quick preparation goes a long way toward avoiding
being labeled uncool when it comes to your SMS syntax. The upcoming sec-
tions help smooth your path a bit by filling you in on the basics of SMS-speak.
Using shorthand for speedy replies
From the get-go, text messaging sprang up from the wild and crazy world 
of cellphone users. And those of you who’ve used a phone lately probably
know that phone design revolves around entering phone numbers rather
than entering the text to War and Peace. Time for a reality check: On a regular
cellphone, three letters share a single key. As you can imagine, trying to bang
out even a single paragraph can be a real pain.
166
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 
SMS is a smash!
In the early days of SMS, phone providers gave
away their text messaging services for free. It
caught on like wildfire, especially in developing
countries where folks are a tad more cost con-
scious. In those countries, it didn’t take long
before lots of folks started carrying a cellphone
just to avail themselves of the free text messag-
ing. Adding to the appeal was the fact that many
network service providers didn’t even force you
to pay for a plan; you could walk into any conve-
nience store and buy a prepaid SIM card, no
questions asked. By the way, Subscriber
Identification Module, or SIM, is a tiny electronic
chip found in the back of a GSM phone. This chip
is your gate to using the phone network.
In the United States, however, it took some time
for SMS to catch up. For one thing, network ser-
vice providers in the U.S. are divided between
CDMA and GSM/GPRS technology. (See Chapter
1 for more on that divide.) GSM/GPRS phones
have allowed for SMS since 1991; CDMA phones
did not until about 2000. (Competing innovations
do have a downside, right?) The second reason
is that most American homes are wired for reg-
ular phone service, so cellphones are not nec-
essarily seen as something you just gotta have.
Eventually, though, the convenience of using
cellphones will make them more and more
attractive — and, of course, SMS is the next log-
ical step.

Human ingenuity prevails. People have found ways to circumvent the fact
that cellphones have such a limited number of keys at their disposal. One
strategy that we highlight here involves using abbreviations that allow you to
cut down on the amount of text you need to enter. These shorthand words
are quickly becoming quite hip, especially among the 14–18-year-old set.
Veteran text messagers (the hip ones, at least) can easily spot someone who
is new to SMS technology by how they don’t use the right lingo — or use
such lingo incorrectly.
Proud owners of a BlackBerry Pearl who are beginners to SMS might be
tempted to rely on BlackBerry’s default SureType feature when text messag-
ing. SureType is a technology used initially in BlackBerry 7100 series and 
carried on in the BlackBerry Pearl. SureType’s purpose is to compensate for
the limited keys at your disposal on this type of BlackBerry. The software is
smart enough to predict what you want to type. It also has the capability to
learn and become smarter as you use it. The technology is neat, making it
possible for you to type words faster and more easily on the BlackBerry
Pearl. However, you might find yourself in a situation in which you receive
text from buddies who use cool, with-it, hip, shorthand lingo, and you
respond with white-bread, uncool, complete words provided for you by
SureType technology. To preserve (or create) your cool image, we recom-
mend disabling SureType when you do any text messaging. (Chapter 2 fills
you in on how to toggle SureType on and off.) That way, you can master
shorthand without any interference from SureType and transform yourself
into a text-messaging fool.
Awhfy?
In text messaging, the challenge lies in using abbreviations to craft a sentence
with as few letters as possible. Because text messaging has been around for a
number of years, plenty of folks have risen to this challenge by coming up
with a considerable pool of useful abbreviations. Don’t feel that you have to
rush out and memorize the whole shorthand dictionary at once, though. As
with mastering a new language, start out with the most commonly used
words or sentences. Then when you become familiar with those, slowly
gather in more and more terms. In time, the whole shorthand thing will be
second nature.
And what are the most commonly used terms out there? Funny you should
ask. Table 9-1 gives you our take on the most common abbreviations, which
are enough to get you started. With these under your belt, you can at least
follow the most important parts of an SMS conversation. Feel free to check
out the Web site associated with this book (www.blackberryfordummies.
com) for a more comprehensive list of shorthand abbreviations.

Showing some emotion
One aspect of written communication that has gotten a few folks in trouble
now and then is that the very same words can mean different things to differ-
ent people. A simple example is the phrase, “You’re such a clueless individ-
ual.” When you speak such a phrase (with the appropriate facial and hand
gestures), your conversational partner knows right off the bat (we hope) that
you’re teasing and that it’s all a bit of fun. Write that same phrase in a text
message and, well, you might get a nasty reply in return — which you then
have to respond to, which prompts another response, and soon enough
you’ve just ended that seven-year friendship.
Because SMS is meant for quick and short messages akin to chatting —
rather than long and drawn-out debates about what you actually meant when
you said what you said — a quick-and-dirty system for characterizing what
you’ve just written (I’m joking! I’m happy! I’m mad!) has sprung up. Known as
emoticons, these cutesy typographical devices let you telegraph your mean-
ing in sledgehammer-to-the forehead fashion.
Yes, we’re talking smileys here — those combinations of keyboard characters
that, when artfully combined, resemble a human face. The most popular
example — one that you’ve probably encountered in e-mails from especially
chirpy individuals — is the happy face, which you see used (usually at the
end of a statement) to convey good intentions or imply a happy context, 
like this : ).
Table 9-2 shows you the range of smiley choices. The trick to recognizing
what each smiley conveys lies in your ability to view them sideways (hope-
fully without developing a crick in your neck). Just remember that smileys
are supposed to be fun. They could be the one thing you need to make sure
that your “gently teasing remark” isn’t misconstrued as a hateful comment.
Sending a text message
After you have the shorthand stuff as well as the smileys under your belt, get
your fingers pumped up and ready for action: It’s message sending time!
Whether its SMS or a richer audio/video (MMS) message, here’s how it’s done:
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select Address Book.
Address Book opens.

2. Highlight a contact who has a cellphone number, press the menu key,
and select SMS (or MMS) <contact name> from the menu that appears.
The menu item for SMS or MMS is intelligent enough to display the name
of the contact. For example, if you choose John Doe, the menu item reads
SMS John Doe or MMS John Doe, as shown to the left in Figure 9-5.
(Note the space for entering your text message, right underneath the
screen heading.)

Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

3. If you chose MMS, Browse from your multimedia folders and select
the audio or video file you want to send.
When choosing MMS, this extra step allows you to choose the multi-
media file. This is the only difference between SMS and MMS with
regards to sending a message.
4. Type your message.
Remember that shorthand business? You should start taking advantage
of it the first chance you get. (Practice makes perfect.)
5. Press the trackball and then select Send from the menu that appears.
Your message is sent on its merry way.
Viewing a message you receive
If you have an incoming SMS or MMS message, you get notification just like
you do when you receive an e-mail. Also, like e-mail, the e-mail icon on the
top of the Home screen indicates a new message. In fact, everything about
viewing SMS and MMS messages is pretty much the same as what you do
when reading an e-mail; so if you have Chapter 8 loaded into your memory,
you know how to read SMS messages. The basic run-through is as follows:
1. Open Messages.
2. Scroll to the unread message.
3. Press the trackball.
4. Bob’s your uncle: The message appears on-screen.
You can customize how your BlackBerry notifies you when you receive an
SMS message. Chapter 3 has the scoop on all the customization options for
your BlackBerry, including options for SMS notification. (Look for the section
about customizing your profile.)

Always Online Using Instant Messaging
Real-time conversation with your friends or buddies over the Internet is
easier with the advent of Instant Messenger. This technology allows two or
more people to send and receive messages quickly with the use of software
that uses the Internet as the wire. It all started with pure text messages and
evolved into a rich medium involving voice and even video conversation in
real time.
You may not find Instant Messenger in your BlackBerry. That’s because it’s a
service provider’s prerogative to include it or not on the BlackBerries they
sell. (Most providers, however, do support it for the BlackBerry Pearl and the
older 7100 series.) Also, your company has the option of not including Instant
Messenger. Here’s the deal: You can add Instant Messenger to your BlackBerry
even if it didn’t come as a default. Now, for those who already have Instant
Messenger installed, you’re in luck. You can go on your merry IM way.
However, for those of you out there lacking an IM application, don’t despair.
See the upcoming section that provides step-by-step instructions on how to
get Instant Messenger installed on your BlackBerry.
Chatting using IM rules
When America Online (AOL) came out with Instant Messenger (IM) in the
mid-1990s, it was an overnight hit. What made it successful was that it could
provide quick (instantaneous) responses to any messages you sent out. In
addition, the service introduced many simple (yet clever) functions that offer
you a new way of communicating. For example, you can chat with multiple
people at the same time. You can tell whether someone is trying to type a
message to you. You can even tell whether your buddies are online, away
from their computers, or simply too busy to be interrupted at the moment.
IM adds up to a totally different slant on long-distance communication, open-
ing a wide array of possibilities — possibilities that can be used for good
(team collaboration) or ill (mindless gossip), depending on the situation.
As you might expect, IM is great for both personal and business applications.
In the business world, IM provides the link so that employees can be always
connected with their colleagues, no matter how distant they might be,
making working collaboratively far easier. On the personal side, this new way
of keeping in touch has been embraced by a pretty broad swath of the popu-
lation — and not just the teen set. Whether you’re busy maintaining friend-
ships or busily working to create new ones, Instant Messenger is definitely
one powerful tool to consider adding to your social skills toolbox.

Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

Instant messaging on a BlackBerry Pearl
Lucky you! IM comes standard with your BlackBerry Pearl. Most network
providers dish out the four most popular IM services on this planet to their
Pearl customers: the ubiquitous AOL Instant Messenger (also know as AIM),
the familiar Yahoo or Y! Messenger, MSN Messenger from the giant Microsoft,
and last but not least, ICQ Instant Messenger. ICQ is the first IM program that
can run on a PC. These four preloaded IM programs are definitely not the
only popular ones — some of you might be using Google Talk or iChat AV,
which runs on the Macintosh. There’s also Jabber, which is favored by the
Open Source community (collaborative efforts of individuals to create free
software). If you are using an IM network that isn’t preloaded, check out the
173
Chapter 9: Too Cool for E-Mail
Messaging etiquette and a few words of caution
Here are some commonsense messaging rules
as well as a few words of caution. Even if you’re
new to messaging, being a neophyte doesn’t
give you free license to act like a jerk. So
remember, play nice and take the following
pointers to heart:
 Use smileys to avoid misunderstandings.
Read more about emoticons and smileys
earlier in this chapter.
 Do not ever forward chain letters. We mean
it. Never.
 If you need to forward a message, check
the entire message content first. Make sure
nothing offends the recipient.
 Some things in this world need to be said
face to face, so don’t even think of using
messaging for it. Ever try dumping your girl-
friend or boyfriend over the phone? Guess
what. Using messaging is a far worse idea.
 Keep your tone gender neutral. Some mes-
sages that are forwarded through e-mails
are inappropriate to the opposite sex.
 Capital letters are like shouting, so DON’T
DO IT.
 Know your recipient. A newbie may not
easily grasp smileys and shorthand at first,
so act accordingly. (Read more about short-
hand earlier in this chapter.)
 Don’t reply to any message when you’re
angry. You can’t unsend a sent message.
Better to be prudent than sorry.
 Don’t spread gossip or make personal
remarks about other people. Beware! Your
messages can end up in the wrong hands
and haunt you in the future.
 Easy does it. There is no documented evi-
dence of the deleterious effects (physical or
psychological) of too much text messaging.
However, don’t text message as if you
wanted to enter the books as the first
recorded case of Instantmesssagingitis. As
your great-grandma would tell you, too
much of anything is bad for you. It’s easy to
lose track of time doing IM.
 Drive safely. Tuck away your BlackBerry
whenever you’re in the driver’s seat.

upcoming sections “Instant Messaging on a non-Pearl model” and “Taking
control of your IM app,” where we discuss programs you can install to run
the IM networks you’re using.
With so many choices, you could never go wrong, right? Not so fast, good
buddy. If you’re not careful, you’ll find yourself contributing more moolah to
your network service provider’s bottom line than you expected. All IM appli-
cations use SMS behind the scenes. And what does that have to do with the
price of tea in China? Well, without an SMS plan, you’ll be suckered into high
per-message cost for SMS access. Before you proceed, make sure that you
understand the finer points of your current plan. And remember: Sometimes
words on these plans can be misleading. For example, your plan might state
that you have unlimited data and Internet access — but then the plan doesn’t
define SMS as either data or Internet access.
Bottom line here: Don’t assume that SMS is part of the unlimited data plan.
Scour your plan contract for sections that deal specifically with SMS, paying
particular attention to whether unlimited SMS is included. If not — and if
you’re considering using IM heavily — consider getting a plan that allows for
unlimited SMS; otherwise, be prepared to shell out some real dough. Or, if it’s
possible, simply add SMS to your current plan. If you have any doubts about
what your plan covers, call your network service provider.
Any other options? Now that you mention it, you can jump ship and go with
another IM application — one that connects directly to an IM network on the
Internet rather that relying on SMS. In the upcoming section, “Taking control
of your IM app,” you find out about some of your options.
IM basics: What you need
Assuming that your plan covers a good deal of SMS, all you need to start
using any of the standard four IM applications are a user ID and a password.
If you don’t have a user ID/password combo yet, getting one is a breeze. Just
go to the appropriate registration Web page (listed next) for the IM applica-
tion(s) you want to use. Use your desktop or laptop machine for signing up.
It’s easier and faster that way.
 AOL Instant Messenger (AIM): aim.aol.com/aimnew/Aim/register.

Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

Given the many IM network choices available, all your friends probably won’t
be registered on the same network. You may end up having to sign up for
multiple networks if you want to reach them all by using IM.
If you’re an avid user of Google Talk, don’t be dismayed because you don’t
see it in the preceding list; RIM has a separate program that you can use. Just
point Browser to www.blackberry.com/GoogleTalk/index.do. The
page that appears gives you step-by-step instructions on how to download
and install Google Talk on your BlackBerry.
Going online with IM
After you obtain the user ID/password combo for one of the IM services, you
can use your BlackBerry to start chatting with your buddies by following
these steps:
1. From the BlackBerry Home screen, select Instant Messaging (Figure 9-6,
left).
A screen displaying the four popular IM services appears (Figure 9-6,
right). You can choose from any of the four IM application icons, based
on where your ID is valid.
2. Select the IM application icon of your choice.
An application-specific login screen shows up for you to sign on, similar
to the one shown in Figure 9-7. It’s straightforward, with the standard
screen name or ID line and password line.
3. Enter your screen name/ID and password.

Chapter 9: Too Cool for E-Mail

4. If you want, select the Save Password box. Also if you want, select the
Auto Sign In box.
When the Save Password check box is enabled, it allows you to keep the
ID/password information preentered the next time you come back to this
screen. (Um, you don’t have to type this stuff every time you want to
IM.) We recommend that you mark this check box to save time but also
set your handheld password to enabled so that security is not compro-
mised. Refer to Chapter 3 if you need a refresher on how to enable pass-
words on your BlackBerry.
The Auto Sign In check box allows you to toggle the feature of signing in
automatically when your BlackBerry is powered up. This is helpful if you
have a habit of turning off your BlackBerry periodically.
5. Press the trackball and then select Sign In.
At this point, IM tries to log you in. This can take a few seconds, during
which the screen reads Sending request to AOL or Sending
request to Yahoo! or Sending request to ICQ while it’s in this
phase. After you’re logged in, a simple listing of your contacts, or bud-
dies, appears on the screen.
6. Select the contact or buddy whom you’d like to chat with, and then
select the action you’d like from the menu that appears.
Your menu options include sending a message and adding or deleting a
contact.
Adding a contact/buddy
Before you can start chatting with your buddies, you need to know their user
IDs as well:
 For AIM, you need to get it from your friend or search AOL’s directory.
 For Yahoo! users, the ID is in their Yahoo! e-mail addresses. It’s the text
before the @ sign.
 ICQ uses an ICQ number as a user ID. You can have your friend e-mail
the ID to you or you can search the ICQ Global Directory.
 On MSN, the user ID is the MSN passport ID.
Figure 9-7:

screen 
for Y!
Messenger.
176
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

Luckily for you, you don’t need to search around for IDs every time you want
to IM someone. You can store IDs as part of a contact list so you can grab an
ID whenever you need one. To add the ID of a contact to your contact list,
just do the following:
1. Starting within the IM service of your choice, press the menu key, and
then select Add Contact, as shown in Figure 9-8.
The Add Contact screen appears.
2. Enter the user ID of your contact in the Add Contact screen and then
press the trackball.
IM is smart enough to figure out whether this contact is a valid user ID
or not. If the ID is valid, the application adds the ID to your list of con-
tacts. The buddy goes either to the Online or Offline section of your list,
depending on whether your buddy is logged in.
Doing the chat thing
Suppose you want to start a conversation with one of your contacts (a safe
assumption on our part, we think). Just log in to the IM application, as
described in the previous section, “Going online with IM,” and send a mes-
sage to your buddy. By sending a message within the IM application, you’re
initiating a conversation. Here are the details on how to do it:
1. In the contact list of the IM application of your choice, select the con-
tact to whom you want to send a message, and then select Send a
Message from the menu that appears.
A typical online chat screen shows up. The top portion of the screen lists
the sequence of previous messages sent to and received from this con-
tact. The bottom portion of the screen is where you type your message.
2. Enter your message.
Figure 9-8:
The Y!
Messenger
menu.
177
Chapter 9: Too Cool for E-Mail

3. Press the trackball, and then press the enter key.
Your user ID plus the message you just sent shows up in the topmost
(history) section of the chat screen. When you receive a message, it’s
appended to the history section as well so that both sides of your e-
conversation stay in view.
Sending your smile
The IM application provides you with a quick way of adding emoticons to
your message without you remembering all the character equivalents in
Table 9-1. While you’re typing your message, press the trackball and select
Insert Emoticon from the menu that appears. A listing of all the icons
appears, as shown in Figure 9-9. Select the one you want and press the 
trackball. The emoticon you selected is appended to your message.
Are you there?
Would you be interested in predefined text to reply quickly to a message? You
may call it laziness but we prefer productivity. While you are on the conversa-
tion screen and on your way to type the message, press the trackball and
select Insert Quick Text from the menu that appears. A list of predefined text
similar to the one shown in Figure 9-10 appears on the screen. Highlight the
one you need and press the trackball. That text is copied to the message
screen and all you need to do is press the enter key.

Notification settings
At times you might want your BlackBerry to alert you when a new message
arrives. Other times you might want the notification off when you’re actively
conversing with someone. Either way, the IM application allows you to switch
this setting quickly. Here’s the rundown:
1. Starting within the IM service of your choice, highlight one of the
main folders such as Conversations, press the menu key, and then
select Notification Settings.
The Notification Settings screen appears, as shown in Figure 9-11.
2. Select the notification options you want.
3. Press the menu key and then select Save.
Instant messaging on a non-Pearl model
You can get IM applications right out of the box with a Pearl and the older
7100 models, but what’s a person to do if her BlackBerry is a different model?
The good news here is that where there’s a will, there’s a way. You’ll need to
do a little bit of work to get IM rolling for you, but we break down the process
so that it won’t be too hard to follow. In a matter of minutes, you’ll have your
IM application installed.
Before you continue with the rest of this section: If you have a company-
provided BlackBerry, make sure that your company policy allows you to use
IM. Otherwise, you might not be able to upgrade and install applications on
your BlackBerry.
Depending on which network service provider you’re signed up for and 
what IM services you want to use, your choices of IM services can vary. 
We describe a sample of what’s available in the following list. (For updated
listings, check out the Web site associated with this book, at www.black
berryfordummies.com.)

Chapter 9: Too Cool for E-Mail

 VeriChat for BlackBerry: http://www.pdaapps.com/verichat_bby.
This IM application is a one-stop shop for anyone using multiple IM net-
works. It supports Yahoo!, ICQ, MSN, and AOL.
VeriChat works well on GPRS and EDGE networks. You might have prob-
lems running the application on a CDMA network, however, if your
BlackBerry is not under BES. (Read about CDMA and GPRS in Chapter 1.)
You may avail hosted BES for best performance under a CDMA network.
Hosted BES means your BlackBerry is connecting through a BES pro-
vided by a vendor (see Chapter 1 for more on BES). Some third-party
vendors offer their BES server for you to host BlackBerry services for 
a monthly fee. One of these companies, MailStreet (www.mailstreet.
net/wireless/default.asp), charges $9.95 per month. You also
need to use its e-mail server, which can be an additional cost. MailStreet
also charges a one-time activation fee of $39.95 U.S.
 Ramble IM: wireless.sra.com/ramble. You can’t beat the price —
it’s freeware — but it supports only AOL.
 BlackChat ICQ: sourceforge.net/projects/blackchat. Again, the
price is good — freeware — but it works only on the ICQ network.
Installing an IM application is easy. You can
 Download directly to your device through a browser download
 Download to your desktop machine and then sync it to your device
If you’re willing to wait a bit and are in a good signal area, we recommend
that you use the browser download method because the steps are easy.
Make sure that you don’t move to an area with no network signal while the
download is progressing. You don’t want to interrupt the download because
you would be forced to start all over again.
Follow these steps to install an IM application directly to your BlackBerry:
1. Point your BlackBerry Browser to the application developer’s Web
site as follows:
a. In the Browser’s main menu, click the Go To button.
b. Enter the URL in the screen that appears.
For example, to install Ramble IM, enter http://wireless.sra.com/
ramble.
c. Select OK.
For more on how to use BlackBerry Browser to surf the Internet, check
out Chapter 10.

Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

2. In the Web page that appears, select the Download link.
Your download begins. After all the files are downloaded to your
BlackBerry, a dialog box appears, prompting you to run the application.
3. Select OK to start the application.
You are now ready to rumble, or ramble, or whatever.
For tips on installing applications to your device from your desktop com-
puter by using BlackBerry Desktop Manager, please see Chapter 17.
Using BlackBerry Messenger
RIM itself has entered the IM application horse race in the form of a spirited
filly named — you guessed it — BlackBerry Messenger. This application is
based on the PIN-to-PIN messaging technology described earlier in this 
chapter, which means that it is mucho fast and quite reliable. However, with
BlackBerry Messenger, you can chat with only those buddies who have a
BlackBerry and also have PIN-to-PIN messaging enabled. The application sup-
ports IM features common to many of the other applications, such as group
chatting and the capability to monitor the availability of other IM buddies.
Running BlackBerry Messenger
You can access BlackBerry Messenger in the Applications folder from the
Home screen, as shown on the left in Figure 9-12. The very first time you run
BlackBerry Messenger, the application throws up a dialog box asking you for
your display name, as shown on the right in Figure 9-12. The application also
asks you to define a password in case you need to restore your contact list at
some point in the future.

Chapter 9: Too Cool for E-Mail

The next time you open the application, you see an IM-style contact list, as
shown on the left in Figure 9-13. (Okay, we know it looks empty right now, but
we show you how to populate it in a minute.) To customize the groupings,
add a contact, set your availability, start a conversation, or change your
options, just press the trackball to call up the BlackBerry Messenger menu,
as shown on the right in Figure 9-13.
Adding a contact
With nobody in your contact list, BlackBerry Messenger is a pretty useless
item. Your first order of business is to add a contact to your list — someone
you know who has a BlackBerry, is entered in your Address Book, has PIN-to-
PIN messaging enabled, and has a copy of BlackBerry Messenger installed on
his or her device. If you know someone who fits these criteria, you can add
that person to your list by doing the following:
1. In BlackBerry Messenger, press the menu key and then select Add a
Contact.
A listing of all the contacts in your BlackBerry Address Book shows up
on-screen.
2. Select the name you want to add to your BlackBerry Messenger con-
tact list.
A Message dialog box appears, displaying the Permission Request 
message the application sends to the potential contact, as shown in
Figure 9-14. Before adding someone to the BlackBerry Messenger con-
tact list, the application, like most IM applications, sends a message to
the other party asking for permission. You have the option of editing the
message that gets sent.
3. Enter your message.
4. Select OK, and then select OK again in the screen that follows.
Figure 9-13:
The
BlackBerry
Messenger
contact list
(left) and
menu (right).
182
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

The application sends your request for the contact to be added to your
BlackBerry Messenger contact list. As long as the person has not
responded to your request, his or her name appears as part of the
Pending group, as shown in Figure 9-15. When your contact responds
positively to your request, that name is moved from the Pending group
to the official contact list.
Starting a conversation
You can easily start a conversation with any of your contacts through the
BlackBerry Messenger main menu. Just highlight a name in your contact list
and press the trackball. A Start Conversation option appears on the menu.
Choosing that option opens a traditional Chat interface, with a historical list
of messages at the top and a text box for typing messages at the bottom.
After typing your message, just press the enter key to send it. Any messages
you send (as well as any responses you get in return) are appended to the
history list at the top.
Starting a group conversation
Whenever you’re conversing with someone via your BlackBerry Messenger,
you can easily invite others in. Just press the trackball while conversing to
call up the BlackBerry Messenger main menu. This time you see that an Invite
Figure 9-15:
To-be-
approved
contacts 
are in the
Pending
group.
Figure 9-14:
Potential
contacts

183
Chapter 9: Too Cool for E-Mail

option has been added. Clicking this option allows you to select any number
of people from your contact list, one at a time, from the Select a Contact
screen that follows. Use the trackball to select the contact and then click OK.
After clicking OK, you’re back to the previous conversation screen, but this
time the history list text indicates that the name of your contact has been
added to the conversation. The newly selected contact can now join in the
conversation.
Taking control of your IM app
If you use IM frequently — and you tend to chat with many contacts simulta-
neously — you might find that the physical limitations of your BlackBerry
cramp your instant messaging style. No matter whether you use AIM, Y!
Messenger, ICQ, MSN Messenger, or BlackBerry Messenger, it’s still slower to
type words on the tiny keypad than it is to type on your desktop or laptop.
So, do you just give up on the dream of instant messaging on-the-go? Not nec-
essarily. This section shows you how you can power up your BlackBerry IM
technique.
Less is more
If you can’t keep up with all your buddies, your best bet is to limit your expo-
sure. Take a whack at your contact list so that only your true buddies remain
as contacts whom you want to IM from your BlackBerry. Trimming your list is
easy — to delete a contact from your IM application, use the Delete option
from your BlackBerry Messenger main menu.
A word of caution before you start pruning your contacts: Deleting a contact
or buddy from an IM application on your BlackBerry also deletes it from the
desktop or laptop computer version of the app. That’s because the list of
contacts is maintained at a central location — an IM server, to be precise —
and not on your BlackBerry. A simple workaround here is to set up two
accounts of your favorite IM application — one for your BlackBerry and one
for your desktop. By using these accounts separately, you can limit the
number of contacts you have on your BlackBerry and still maintain a full-
blown list of contacts on your desktop.
Lesser typing and emoticons
Cut down your typing time. Don’t forget the shorthand described previously.
It’s widely used in IM as well, so refer to Table 9-1 whenever you can so that
you can quickly respond. Before you know it, you’ll have the abbreviations
memorized and be using them with ease. The emoticons also can make your
conversation more interesting. Always take them out of your toolbox. Refer
to Table 9-2 for the list of the most common ones.

SMS versus connecting via the Web
SMS messages are short messages designed for cellphones. IM is a step up,
evolving from the Internet where bandwidth is no longer a concern. It pro-
vides a better real-time conversation experience across distances. These two
technologies evolved in parallel. As more people use IM, it becomes apparent
that this technology has a place in handheld devices, where mobility is an
advantage. Some of the IM programs developed and used in the BlackBerry
use SMS behind the scenes. And because your BlackBerry is also capable of
connecting to the Internet, other programs use the Internet directly. These
differences can affect your monthly bill as well as your messaging experience.
Read on.
The IM applications that come preloaded with the BlackBerry Pearl use Short
Messaging Service (SMS) as the medium to communicate with the IM net-
works. Aspects of SMS use might interest you, especially if you’re concerned
about the costs associated with IM on your BlackBerry. First, if you have
unlimited SMS in your plan, the IM applications on your Pearl are definitely
going to be less costly. Comparatively, if you don’t have unlimited SMS but
have an unlimited data plan, you’re better off purchasing IM software that con-
nects directly to the IM network from your BlackBerry. Direct connection is
faster than using SMS, so you will have a better experience. Direct connection
does mean heavy wireless use, however, which quickly drains your battery.
On non-Pearl models, IM programs are not preloaded as of this writing. If you
install IM programs, make sure that you understand what the program uses
behind the scene to communicate. Again, if it uses SMS, review your plan and
make sure it includes SMS. If it uses the Internet, make sure you have an
unlimited data plan.
Another feature you might find appealing about some of the third-party IM
software is that it allows for group conversations. This is not available on the
IM software that comes preloaded with the Pearl.
Other IM recommendations
If you’re using only AIM for messaging, your best option is to download
Ramble IM. This is a freeware program (available from wireless.sra.
com/ramble) that connects directly to the Web instead of using SMS. If
you’re not on an unlimited SMS plan, going with Ramble IM can save you
some bucks.
For multiple IM network support, one of the best options available is VeriChat
(available for download from www.pdaapps.com/verichat_bby). VeriChat
does have one downside: It requires an annual subscription fee. A standard
one-account-per-IM subscription costs $34.95 for the first year and $24.95 for
succeeding years. If you don’t want to pay annually, consider IM+ (available
185
Chapter 9: Too Cool for E-Mail

for download at www.shapeservices.com/eng/im/BLACKBERRY). IM+
only asks for a one-time fee of $44.95 and also supports Yahoo!, MSN, AOL,
ICQ, Google Talk and Jabber networks. Two versions are available: the
Regular version and the WAP version. The Regular version connects to BES.
(Please read Chapter 1 for details on BES.) BES is used by companies as a
way of connecting the BlackBerry platform to the corporate network and
e-mail server. The WAP version of IM+ allows a personal BlackBerry to use
the network provider’s WAP gateway to connect to the Internet. The Shape
Services Web site has a comprehensive FAQ (frequently asked questions) sec-
tion for details about the software. The best thing about IM+ is that it sends
messages by using the Internet rather than SMS, which is best suited for
people who have the unlimited data plan.
Please check out the Web site associated with this book for updates regard-
ing these (and other) recommendations.

I
t’s hard to believe that just over 12 years ago, more folks did not have
access to the Internet than did. Today, you can surf the Web anytime, any-
where, and you can do it by using a traditional desktop or laptop computer, or
even a tiny mobile device such as a PDA or a SmartPhone. Having said that, it
should be no surprise that your BlackBerry has a Web browser of its own.
In this chapter, we explore ways to use BlackBerry Browser effectively. We
offer shortcuts that improve your experience browsing the Web. We also
throw in timesaving tips, including the coolest ways to customize your
browser to make pages load faster and a complete neat-freak’s guide to 
managing your bookmarks.
Your network service provider might also have its own custom browser 
for you to use. We compare these proprietary browsers with the default
BlackBerry browser so that you can decide which best suits your needs.
Getting Started with BlackBerry Browser
BlackBerry Browser or Internet Browser is preloaded on your BlackBerry and
accesses the Web by a cellphone connection. When you run your BlackBerry
on BlackBerry Enterpriser Server (BES; see Chapter 1 for BES info), the appli-
cation is called BlackBerry Browser; otherwise, it’s called Internet Browser. We
just use Browser to make things easier.

The BlackBerry supports two browsers: one that’s connected to your BES
server and one that goes directly to your service provider’s network. If you
are a corporate BlackBerry user, your company administrator might turn off
or not install the browser provided by the network service provider. The
browser that comes with your network service provider might be called by
its brand name.
The following sections get you started using Browser. After you get your feet
wet, we promise that you’ll be chomping at the bit to find out more!
Accessing Browser
Browser is one of the main applications of your device, with its Globe icon
visible right on the Home screen, as shown in Figure 10-1. In most cases, you
open Browser by scrolling to this icon and then pressing the trackball.

Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 
Small screen, small images
Like other similar devices, the BlackBerry has
limited screen real estate and should not be
compared with personal computers in terms of a
Web-browsing experience. The screen is just too
small to accommodate a normal Web page. Also,
remember that your connection is through a cell-
phone network, so your connection speed varies
from location to location. Although cellphone
networks are slowly catching up in providing
broadband speed, they are still not as speedy as
a Wi-Fi or cable connection. Pictures and images
won’t look the same, and pages might take
longer to load depending on the size of the Web
page. The good news is that you don’t have to
endure nasty pop-ups. Still, despite this limited
capacity (compared with a traditional Web
browser), when you really need information and
you’re away from a computer, your BlackBerry is
there for you.

If Browser is your default browser, you can access it from the any application
that distinguishes a Web address. For example, from Address Book, you can
open Browser by opening the link on the Web Page field. If you get an e-mail
containing a Web address, just scroll to that link. The link is highlighted, and
you can open the page by pressing the trackball.
When you access Browser from another application, you don’t have to 
close that application to jump to Browser. Just press the Alt key (to the 
left of the Z key) and the escape key (to the right of the trackball) at the 
same time to bring up a pop-up screen with application icons. Use your 
trackball to highlight the Browser icon and then press the trackball to 
launch Browser.
By default, accessing Browser by clicking a Web address within another 
application opens the Web page associated with that address. (In Figure 10-2,
we’re opening Browser from the Messages application.) Opening Browser by
clicking its icon on the Home screen gives you a list of bookmarks.
If you haven’t yet added bookmarks, the opening Browser screen looks 
like Figure 10-3. You can find out more about adding bookmarks later in 
this chapter.

Chapter 10: Surfing the Internet Wave

Hitting the (air) waves
After you locate Browser, you’re ready to surf the Web. Here’s how:
1. Open Browser.
More recent versions of the BlackBerry OS display your bookmarks
when you open Browser; older versions display the home page.
2. Press the menu key and then select Go To.
3. In the screen that appears, enter a Web address, as shown in Figure 10-4.
4. Select OK.
The Web page appears.
When you see a phone number or an e-mail address on a Web page, you can
scroll to that information to highlight it. When the information is highlighted,
pressing the trackball initiates a phone call or opens a new e-mail message
(depending on which type of link you highlighted).
Navigating Web pages
Using Browser to navigate to a Web page is easy. Note that hyperlinks are
highlighted on-screen. To jump to a particular hyperlink, scroll to the high-
lighted link and press the trackball.
Here are few shortcuts you can use while navigating a Web page:
 Quickly move up and down one full display page at a time by pressing 9
(down arrow) or 3 (up arrow).
 Quickly switch between full-screen mode and normal mode by pressing
the exclamation point (!) key. Think of full-screen mode simply as another
way to view the same Web page on your BlackBerry, but the BlackBerry
doesn’t show anything extra (for example, signals level) on the top por-
tion of the display screen. Normal mode is what you get by default.
Figure 10-4:
Opening a
Web page is
simple.
190
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

 To stop loading a page, press the escape key.
 After a page fully loads, go back to the previous page by pressing the
escape key.
And don’t forget the Browser menu (press the menu key). It has some useful
shortcuts, as shown in Figure 10-5.
Here are the Browser menu options:
 Page Overview: Displays a compressed version of the Web page, allow-
ing you to see the entire Web page by using fewer scrolls. The com-
pressed version is also broken down into sections, where each section
represents a single displayable page. You can use this feature to navigate
quickly to the section of the Web page you want; then press the trackball
while the section is highlighted to display that portion of the Web page.
The Page Overview can differ depending on what type of view you are
using in Browser. In the Desktop View, the compressed version of the
Web page occupies the entire screen. In the Mobile View, the com-
pressed version of the Web page is displayed in the right portion of 
the screen. The compressed version of the page is the only one active,
meaning you can scroll up or down on this portion of the screen by
using your trackball.
 Desktop View: Appears only if you are currently in the Mobile View. This
view allows you to see the layout of the page as you would normally see
it on your PC’s Internet browser. Having a small screen, you can see only
a portion of the Web page. To see the rest of it, you use the trackball to
scroll left, right, up, and down.
 Mobile View: This is the default view and normally does not appear as a
menu option. It shows up only if you are currently in the Desktop View.
With this view, the Web page is displayed vertically, meaning a wide Web
page wraps down and you can use the trackball to scroll up and down
the page.
Figure 10-5:
The
Browser
menu has
lots of good
stuff.
191
Chapter 10: Surfing the Internet Wave

 Find: Finds text within the current page. Like any other basic Find tool,
choosing this option displays a prompt to enter the text you want to
find. After the initial search, a Find Next menu appears for finding the
next matching text.
 Copy: This menu item appears if you have currently highlighted text.
Selecting Copy will copy the highlighted text into memory so that you
can use it later for pasting somewhere else, such as in your MemoPad.
 Get Link: This menu item appears if you have a currently highlighted
link. Choosing this menu item opens that page of the link. Hint: The
faster way to open a link is to press enter.
 Home: The shortcut to your home page. The default home page can
vary from carrier to carrier, but you can change it by bringing up the
Browser menu and choosing Options➪Browser Configuration. From
there, you can change the Home Page Address field.
 Go To: Allows you to open a Web page by entering the Web address 
and pressing the trackball. As you enter more addresses, the ones you
entered before are listed and stored for possible future use so that you
don’t have to type them again. To find out how to clear that list, see the
“Cache operations” section.
 Back <Esc>: Goes back to the previous page you viewed.
When you see <Esc>, you can achieve the same function by pressing the
escape key.
 Forward: If you’ve gone back at least one Web page in your browsing
travels, use Forward to progress one page at a time.
 Recent Pages: Browser can track up to 20 pages of Web addresses
you’ve visited, which you can view on the History screen. From there,
you can jump to any of those Web pages by highlighting the history page
and pressing the enter key twice.
 Refresh: Updates the current page. This is helpful when you’re viewing a
page with data that changes frequently (such as stock quotes).
 Set Encoding: Specifies the encoding used in viewing a Web page. This 
is useful when viewing foreign languages that use different characters.
Most of us don’t have to deal with this and probably don’t know what
type of encoding a particular language could display.
When you try to open a Web page, indicators appear at the bottom of the
screen that tell you the progress of your request. The left screen in Figure 10-6
shows that Browser is requesting a page. The right screen of Figure 10-6
shows that you’ve reached the page and that the page is still loading.
192
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

At the upper-right corner of both screens in Figure 10-6 are several icons. The
rightmost arrow icons appear only when Browser is actively processing data
and is not waiting for a server response. The icon to the left of the arrows
shows the strength of the network signals (it’s the same signal indicator for
phone and e-mail). The type of connection you currently have also appears; 
in Figure 10-6, the connection is EDGE. (Chapter 1 gives you the scoop on con-
nection types.) Going to the left, the next icon (the lock) indicates whether
you’re at a secure Web page. In this case, it’s a normal page. Whether a page 
is secure or not depends on the Web site you’re visiting. If you’re accessing
banking information, you most likely see the secured icon (a closed lock). On
the other hand, most informational pages need not be secure, so you see the
unsecured icon (an open lock). Hint: The Web address of a secure page starts
with https rather than http.
If you lose patience waiting for a page to load and want to browse somewhere
else, press the escape key to stop the page from loading.
Saving a Web page address
Entering a Web address to view a page can get tedious. Fortunately, you can
return to a page without manually entering the same address. While you’re
viewing a Web page, simply use the Browser menu (shown in Figure 10-7) to
save that page’s address.

Browser
menu to

Figure 10-6:

193
Chapter 10: Surfing the Internet Wave

You can save a Web page address in a couple of ways:
 Page Address: This option allows you to view the Web address of the
current page through a pop-up screen, which presents you with two
options. Copy Address saves the page’s address on your BlackBerry’s
Clipboard and allows you to paste it somewhere else. Send Address 
presents you with another screen that allows you to choose whether 
to send the address by using e-mail, MMS, PIN, or SMS. If you select 
the Email option, the Messages Compose screen appears with the Web
address pasted in the body of the e-mail. If you choose MMS, PIN, or 
SMS Text, you’re taken to Address Book to select your recipient; the rest
is the same as sending a regular MMS, PIN, or SMS text message. See
Chapter 8 for more on sending e-mail messages and Chapter 9 for MMS,
PIN, and SMS.
 Save Page: Use this option to save the Web address of the current page
to Messages. A message appears with the Browser globe icon to indicate
that it’s a Web link, as shown in Figure 10-8. Scrolling to that entry and
pressing the trackball launches Browser and opens the page for your
viewing pleasure. Saving a page to your message list has a different pur-
pose than bookmarking a page. When you save a page to your message
list, you can mark the page as unread, like an e-mail message, to remind
yourself to check back later.
Note: When you do not have network coverage and you try to access a Web
page, you’re prompted to save your request. When you do, your request is
automatically saved in the message list. When you do have coverage later,
you can open the same Web page from the message list, with the content
loaded already!
Pressing a letter key while a menu appears selects the first menu item that
starts with that letter. Pressing the same letter again selects the next menu
item that starts with that letter.

Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

Sending an address by e-mail
You can send a Web address to any recipient via an e-mail by using the Page
Address option in the Browser menu. For a more direct way, simply select
Send Address from the Browser menu while the Web page is displayed. If you
know right away that you’re going to send an address to someone, use the
more direct method. It saves you a couple of clicks.
Saving Web images
If you have a BlackBerry with a color screen, you can view and save pictures
or images from a Web page. You can save images of JPEG, PNG, GIF, and BMP
formats. Any saved image is kept in the Pictures application, which enables
you to view it later, even when you are out of coverage. To save it from the
Web page, click the image you want to save and then select Save Image from
the menu that appears.
Bookmarking Your Favorite Sites
You don’t have to memorize each address of your favorite sites. BlackBerry
Browser allows you to keep a list of sites you want to revisit. In other words,
make a bookmark so you can come back to a site quickly.
Adding a bookmark
On the page you want to bookmark, select Add Bookmark from the Browser
menu. Remember that the menu is always accessible by pressing the menu key.
Enter the name of the bookmark and then select the folder where you want to
195
Chapter 10: Surfing the Internet Wave
Changing your Home screen background
This is a neat trick. You can use an image that
you have saved on your pictures list as the
background on your Home screen. Here’s how:
1. From the Home screen, select the Media
icon, and then select Pictures.
The Pictures application opens.
2. Scroll to and select the image you want to
set as your background.
3. Press the menu key and then select Set As
Home Screen Image.

save the bookmark in the Bookmark dialog box (as shown in Figure 10-9). The
default folder is BlackBerry Bookmarks, but you can save the bookmark in fold-
ers that you create. To see how to create a bookmark folder, skip to the section,
“Adding a bookmark subfolder.”
The next time you want to go to a bookmarked page, return to the Bookmarks
screen by choosing Bookmarks from the Browser menu. From this screen,
you can find all the pages you bookmarked. Just highlight the name of the
bookmark and press the enter key to open that page.
Available offline
The Add Bookmark dialog box includes an Available Offline check box, which
you might be wondering about. If that check box is checked, you not only
save a page as a bookmark, you are also caching it so you can view it even
when out of network coverage (like when you’re stuck deep in a mountain
cave). So next time you click the bookmark, that page comes up very fast.
We recommend that you make bookmarks to search engines (such as Google)
available offline because the content of the initial search page is not likely to
change from day to day.
If you’re working with version 3.8 or later of the BlackBerry OS, the
Bookmarks screen appears by default when you open Browser.
Modifying a bookmark
Changing a bookmark is a snap:
1. Go to the Bookmarks screen.
To open the Bookmarks screen, select Bookmarks from the Browser menu.
2. Highlight the name of the bookmark you want to modify, press the
menu key, and then select Edit Bookmark.
Figure 10-9:
Specify the
name and
the folder in
which to
store the
bookmark.
196
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

3. On the screen that follows, you can edit the existing name, or the
address the bookmark is pointing to, or both.
4. Select Accept to save your changes.
Organizing your bookmarks
Over time, the number of your bookmarks will grow, and having a tiny display
screen can make it tough to find a certain site. To mitigate this problem, orga-
nize your bookmarks by using folders. For example, you can group related
sites in a folder, and each folder can have one or more folders inside it (sub-
folders). Having a folder hierarchy narrows your search and allows you to
easily find a site.
Adding a bookmark subfolder
Unfortunately, you can only add subfolders to folders that are already listed
on the Bookmark page. Nevertheless, you can still get organized by using
subfolders.
Suppose that you want to add a subfolder called Favorites within your
BlackBerry Bookmarks folder. Here are the quick and easy steps:
1. On the Bookmarks screen, highlight BlackBerry Bookmarks.
The initial folder you highlight is the parent of the new subfolder. So in
this case, the BlackBerry Bookmarks folder will contain the Favorites
subfolder.
2. Press the menu key and then select Add Subfolder, as shown in 
Figure 10-10.
You see a dialog box where you can enter the name of the folder.
3. Enter the name of the folder (as shown in Figure 10-11) and use the
trackball to select OK.
We named our folder Favorites. The Favorites folder appears on the
Bookmarks screen (as in Figure 10-12), bearing a folder icon.
Figure 10-10:
Add a folder
here.
197
Chapter 10: Surfing the Internet Wave

Renaming a bookmark folder
Renaming a bookmark folder is as easy as editing a bookmark. On the
Bookmarks screen, highlight the name of the folder, press the menu key, 
and select Rename Folder from the menu that appears. On the screen that 
follows, you can edit the name of the folder. After renaming, use the trackball
to select OK to save your changes.
Moving your bookmarks
If you keep going astray looking for a bookmark that you think exists in a par-
ticular folder but is instead in another, move that bookmark where it belongs:
1. Highlight the bookmark, press the menu key, and select Move
Bookmark.
2. Use the trackball to move the bookmark to the location in the list
where you want it to appear.
3. After you find the right location, press the trackball.
Your bookmark is in its new home.
Cleaning up your bookmarks
Cleaning up your bookmarks list can help you keep organized. On the
Bookmarks screen, highlight the name of the bookmark you want to delete,
press the menu key, and select Delete from the menu that appears.

You can clean up bookmarks wholesale by deleting an entire folder. However,
if you delete a folder, you delete the contents of that folder as well, so purge
with caution.
Browser Options and Optimization
Techniques
On the latest version of BlackBerry OS (version 4.2, as of this writing), you
may find that Web browsing is slow because Research In Motion (RIM) added
many improvements to the application. That sounds like an oxymoron —
slow is an improvement? Hold on a second so we can explain.
From version 4.0 and later, Browser supports much better HTML (HyperText
Markup Language) tables, JavaScript, and Cascading Style Sheets. It also 
supports more image formats. With every new feature RIM adds, more pro-
cessing time is required, which can result in performance degradation. To
compensate for this slowdown, RIM allows you to control which features 
are active through the Browser Options screen, which is accessible via the
Browser menu. (Just press the trackball to open the menu and select
Options.) If you still feel speed-greedy after adjusting the options, see the
upcoming sidebar, “Speeding up browsing.”
The Browser Options screen offers three main categories to choose from, as
shown in Figure 10-13.
Configuring Browser
You can define browser-specific settings from the Browser Configuration
screen, which you access from the Browser Options screen. The list of cus-
tomization items you can amend (shown in Figure 10-14) are as follows:
Figure 10-13:
The
Browser
Options
screen.
199
Chapter 10: Surfing the Internet Wave

 Support JavaScript. A Web page might not behave normally when this
option is off.
 Enable or suppress of JavaScript pop-ups.
 Support of Cascading Style Sheets.
 Use of foreground and background colors.
 Use of background images.
 Support of embedded media such as SVG. SVG stands for scalable
vector graphics. Think of it as Flash for mobile devices such as the
BlackBerry. SVG can be a still image or an animated one.
 Support of stylesheets.
 Set the content mode you want viewed to WML, or HTML, or both.
Think of WML pages as Web pages made just for mobile devices such as
the BlackBerry. We recommend that you leave this as WML or both.
Browser supports other variants of HTML such as cHTML and xHTML,
but selecting HTML covers cHTML and xHTML as well.
 Control the display of images depending on the content mode.
 Turn on and off the display of image placeholders if you opt to not
display images.
 Specify which browser type your browser emulates. The default is
BlackBerry, but Browser can emulate Microsoft Internet Explorer,
Openwave (WAP), Openwave Gateway, Microsoft Pocket IE, or Netscape.
We don’t see much difference in their behavior, so we recommend that
you stick with the default BlackBerry mode.
 Set your starting page when you open Browser.
 Set your home page.
General Browser properties
The General Properties screen has the same function as the Browser
Configuration screen (see the preceding section) in that you can customize
Figure 10-14:

Configuration
screen.
200
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

some behaviors of Browser. This screen, however, is geared more toward the
features of the Browser content. As shown in Figure 10-15, you can configure
or turn on and off more features.
From this screen, you use the Space key to change the value of a field. You
can configure the following features by selecting from the provided choices:
 Set the default browser.
 Change the default font and font size. You can change these settings 
by first highlighting them one at a time, then pressing the trackball, and
then making a selection.
 Set the default view. You can toggle the default view between Mobile and
Desktop. Desktop makes Browser display the page in a layout you normally
see in your PC’s Internet browser. You use the trackball to scroll left, right,
up, and down. Mobile view wraps all Web page elements vertically, and
navigation is just scrolling up and down by using the trackball.
 Set the quality of images. The higher the quality, the slower the page
loads. The default quality is medium. You have three options; low,
medium, or high.
 Set the number of times an animation repeats. The default is 100 but
you can change this setting to Never, Once, 10, 100, or as many as the
image specifies.
 Enable or disable prompting when closing the browser. You can be
notified before you do the following actions as a precaution:
• Closing Browser on Escape: Notified right before you exit
BlackBerry Browser.
• Closing Modified Pages: Notified right before you exit a modified
Web page (for example, some type of online form you fill out).
• Running WML Scripts: Notified right before a WML script runs.
 Support of HTML tables. A page with HTML tables might look different
when this is disabled.

Cache operations
At any given time, your BlackBerry uses a few cache mechanisms. A cache
temporarily stores information used by Browser so that the next time the info
is needed, Browser doesn’t have to go back to the source Web site. The cache
can speed up displays when you want to view the Web page again and is also
useful when you’re suddenly out of network coverage. When you visit a site
that uses cookies (think of a cookie as a piece of text that a Web site created
and placed in your BlackBerry’s memory to remember something about you),
Browser caches that cookie.
Browser also caches pages and content so that you can view them offline —
which is handy when you’re out of range. Some content publishers have 
services that push content to BlackBerry devices. If you subscribed to this
202

Speeding up browsing
On a wireless network, many factors can affect
the speed with which Web pages display. If you
find that browsing the Web is extremely slow, you
can make your pages load faster in exchange for
not using a few features. Here are some of the
techniques you can use:
 Don’t display images. You can see a big
performance improvement by turning off
the display of images. From the Browser
menu, select Browser Options➪Browser
Configuration, scroll to Show Images, and
change the value to No.
 Make sure your BlackBerry is not low on or
out of memory. When your BlackBerry’s
memory is very low, its performance
degrades. The BlackBerry low-memory man-
ager calls each application every now and
then, telling each one to free up resources.
Hint #1: Don’t leave many e-mail messages
unread. When the low-memory manager
kicks in, Messages tries to delete old mes-
sages, but it can’t delete those that are
unread.
Hint #2: You can also clean up the
BlackBerry event log to free up needed
space. Enter the letters LGLG while holding
the shift key. This brings up an event log,

service, your device will have Web pages stored in the cache. Also, the
addresses of the pages that you visited (or your latest 20 in your history 
list) comprise a cache. The Cache Operations screen, shown in Figure 10-16,
allows you to manually clean your cache.
The size for each type of cache is displayed on this screen. If the cache has
content, you also see the Clear button, which you can use to clear the speci-
fied cache type. This is true for all types of cache except for history, which
has its own Clear History button. There are four types of cache:
 Content Cache: Any offline content. You might want to clear this out
whenever you’re running out of space on your BlackBerry and need to
free some memory. Or maybe you’re tired of viewing old content or tired
of pressing the Refresh option.
 Push Content: Any content that was pushed to your BlackBerry from
Push Services subscriptions. You might want to clear this out to free
memory on your BlackBerry.
 Cookie Cache: Any cookies stored on your BlackBerry. You might want
to clear this out for security’s sake. Sometimes you don’t want a Web
site to remember you.
 History: This is the list of sites you’ve visited by using the Go To function.
You might want to clear this for the sake of security if you don’t want
other people knowing which Web sites you’re visiting on your BlackBerry.
Installing and Uninstalling 
Applications from the Web
You can download and install applications on your BlackBerry by using
Browser, providing that whoever published the application on the Web has a
link that enables you to download the appropriate files and install them. The
downloading and installing part is easy — just click the link from Browser, and
it displays a simple prompt that looks like the screen shown in Figure 10-17.
Click the Download button to start the download.
Figure 10-16:
The Cache
Operations
screen.
203
Chapter 10: Surfing the Internet Wave

As long as you stay within network coverage while the download is progressing,
your BlackBerry can finish the download and install the application for you. If it
finishes without any problems, you see a screen similar to Figure 10-18.
As with a desktop computer, the download might or might not work for a vari-
ety of reasons. Sometimes the application requires that you install libraries,
and sometimes the application works only on a certain version of the
BlackBerry OS. These issues can be prevented, depending on the sophistica-
tion of the site where the link is published. With most reputable sources, these
issues are considered — and successful downloading and installation is a snap.
Installing applications from nonreputable sources can cause your BlackBerry
to become unstable. Before you download an application from the Web, be
sure to read reviews about that particular application. Most of the time, other
people who tried the software provide reviews or feedback. Don’t be the first
to write the bad review!
You BES administrator can disable the feature in your BlackBerry to down-
load and install an application. This is mostly the case for a company-issued
device. If you have problems downloading and installing an application,
check your company policy or contact the BlackBerry support person in
your company.
If you download an application that turns out to be a dud, you need to unin-
stall it. See Chapter 17 for more on uninstalling an application from your
BlackBerry.

Browser’s Behavior in an 
Enterprise Environment
Getting a device from your employer has both a good and an ugly side. On
the good side, your company foots the bill. On the bad side, your company
foots the bill. Because your company pays for the bill, the company has a say
in what you can and can’t do with your BlackBerry device. This is especially
true with respect to browsing the Web.
Depending on your company’s policy, you might or might not get a browser
that comes with the network service provider. Two scenarios come into play
when it comes to your browser. In an Enterprise environment, a browser might
be running under your company’s BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES). With
this setup, your BlackBerry Browser is connecting to the Internet by using your
company’s Internet connection. It’s like using your desktop machine at work.
The second scenario is where your browser is connected not to your com-
pany’s BES but through a network service provider. Most of the time, a
provider has a version of the browser branded to its name. In most cases,
your device fits in only one scenario, which is the case where your browser is
connected through your company’s BES server. Some lucky folks might have
both. Whatever scenario you’re in, the following sections describe the major
differences between the two and what you can expect.
Using Browser on your company’s BES
In an Enterprise setup, your BlackBerry Browser is connected through your
company’s BES server. With this setup, the browser is actually named
BlackBerry Browser. BES is located inside your company’s intranet. This
setup allows the company to better manage the privileges and the functions
you can use on your device.
For the BlackBerry Browser application, this setup allows the company to
use the existing Internet infrastructure, including the company’s firewall.
Because you are within the company’s network, the boundaries that your net-
work administrator set up on your account apply to your BlackBerry as well.
For example, when browsing the Web, your BlackBerry won’t display any
Web sites that are blocked by your company’s proxy server. The good thing,
though, is that you can browse by using the company’s intranet.
Pay attention to your company’s Web browsing policy. Most companies keep
logs of the sites you view on your browser and might even have software to
monitor usage.
Also, if your company’s proxy settings don’t allow downloading from the 
Web, your device can’t download and install anything coming from the Web.
205
Chapter 10: Surfing the Internet Wave

Remember that installation of software into your device depends not only on
your download privileges but also on the IT policy and software configuration
assigned to your ID on the BES console by your company’s BES administrator.
Using your network provider’s browser
Any new device coming from a network service provider can come with its
own branded Web browser. It’s the same BlackBerry Browser, but the behav-
ior might differ from the standard one. For one, the name is different, and the
default home page usually points to the provider’s Web site. This is not nec-
essarily a bad thing. Most of the time, the network provider’s Web site is also
rich with links that you might not find on RIM’s portal. But this is just a minor
difference. The major difference is that because this browser is not on your
company’s BES but on your provider’s network, you have more freedom on
what sites to browse. You’re not limited by your company’s policy on brows-
ing. In this case, privacy is king.
Most of the time, if your browser is through BES, surfing the Web is much
faster. This is not true in all cases, however, because the network bandwidth
of your BES affects the speed.
Setting the default browser
If you have two Web browsers on your device, you have the option to set the
default browser. This comes into play when you view a Web address by using
a link outside the browser application. For example, when you view a contact
with a Web page in Address Book, the Address Book menu contains a Get
Link option. Clicking Get Link launches the default browser.
To set up the default browser, from the Home screen, navigate to
Settings➪Options-->Advanced Options-->Browser. (If you have a Pearl, the
Settings option is located in Tools.) Use the Space key to change the value of
the default browser. Figure 10-19 shows the Browser Settings screen with the
default browser selected.

T
he BlackBerry phone operates no differently than any other phone you’ve
used. So why bother with this chapter? Although your BlackBerry phone
operates like any other phone you’ve used, it has capabilities that far out-
reach those of your run-of-the-mill cellphone. For example, when was the last
time your phone was connected to your to-do list? Have you ever received an
e-mail and placed a call directly from that e-mail? We didn’t think so. But with
your BlackBerry, you can do all these things and more.
In this chapter, we first cover phone basics and then show you some of the
neat ways BlackBerry Phone intertwines with other BlackBerry applications
and functions.
Using the BlackBerry Phone Application
Accessing the Phone application from the BlackBerry is a snap. You can press
the green send button located right below the display screen to get into the
Phone application.
You can get to the Phone application also by pressing any of the numeric
keys. To do this, however, you have to make sure that the Dial from Home
Screen option is enabled in Phone Options. If you’re a frequent phone user,
we recommend that you enable this option.

On a BlackBerry Pearl, you don’t need to go through the following steps.
Because Pearl is designed for heavy phone use, Dial from Home Screen isn’t
an option.
To enable dialing from the Home screen:
1. From the Home screen, select the Phone application.
Phone opens, showing the dial screen as well as your call history list.
2. Press the menu key and then select the options (wrench) icon.
3. Select General Options.
4. Highlight the Dial from Home Screen option, press the trackball, and
then select Yes from the drop-down list.
This enables you to make a phone call by pressing the numeric keys
when at the Home screen.
5. Press the menu key and then select Save.
Throughout this section, we assume that you have Dial from Home Screen
enabled if you’re using a non-SureType model.
Making and Receiving Calls
The folks at RIM have created an intuitive user interface to all the essential
Phone features, including making and receiving calls.
Making a call
To make a call, start from the Home screen and type the phone number you
want to dial. As soon as you start typing numbers, the Phone application opens.
When you finish typing the destination number, press the green send key.
Calling from Address Book
Because you can’t possibly remember all your friends’ and colleagues’ phone
numbers, calling from Address Book is convenient and useful. To call from
Address Book, follow these steps:
1. Open the Phone application.
2. Press the menu key.
The Phone menu appears, as shown in Figure 11-1.
3. Select Call from Address Book.
208
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

Address Book opens. From here, you can search as usual for the contact
you’d like to call.
4. From Address Book, highlight your call recipient, press the trackball,
and then select Call.
This makes the call.
Dialing letters
One of the nice features of BlackBerry Phone is that you can dial letters, and
BlackBerry will figure out the corresponding number. For example, to dial
1-800-11-LEARN, do the following on your BlackBerry:
1. From the Home screen or the Phone application, dial 1-8-0-0-1-1.
As you type the first number, the Phone application opens (if it isn’t
open already) and displays the numbers you dialed.
2. Press and hold the Alt key and then dial (press) L-E-A-R-N.
The letters appear on-screen as you type.
3. Press the green send key.
The call is initiated.
Receiving a call
Receiving a call on your BlackBerry is even easier than making a call. You can
receive calls in a couple of ways. One is by using your BlackBerry’s auto-
mated answering feature, and the other is by answering manually.
Automated answering is triggered whenever you take your BlackBerry out of your
holster; in other words, just taking out the BlackBerry forces it to automatically
Figure 11-1:
The Phone
menu.
209
Chapter 11: Calling Your Favorite Person

pick up any call, so you can start talking right away. The disadvantage of this is
that you don’t have time to see who is calling you (on your Caller ID).
Note: To disable auto-answering, be sure your BlackBerry isn’t in its holster
when an incoming call arrives.
What’s the advantage of disabling auto-answering? Well, manual answering
prompts you to answer a call or ignore a call when you receive an incoming
call, as shown in Figure 11-2. This way, you can see on your Caller ID who is
calling you before you decide to pick up or ignore the call.
Phone Options While on a Call
When you’re on the phone, situations might arise where you’d want to mute
your conversation or change the call volume. No problem. BlackBerry makes
such adjustments easy.
Muting your call
You might want to use the mute feature while on a conference call (see the
upcoming section, “Arranging Conference Calls”) when you don’t need to
speak but do need to hear what is being discussed. Maybe you’re on the bus
or have kids in the background, making your surroundings noisy. By using
mute, these background noises are filtered out from the conference call.
To mute your call. follow these steps:
1. While in a conversation, press the menu key.
The Phone menu appears in all its glory.
Figure 11-2:
Answer or
ignore with
manual
answering.
210
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

2. Select Mute.
You will hear a tone sound, indicating that your call is on mute.
To un-mute your call:
1. While a call is on mute, press the menu key.
The Phone menu makes another appearance.
2. Select Turn Mute Off.
You will hear a tone sound, indicating that your call is now un-muted.
Placing your call on hold
Unlike muting a call, placing a call on hold prohibits both you and your caller
from hearing one another. To put a conversation on hold:
1. While in a conversation, press the trackball.
The Phone menu appears yet again.
2. Scroll to Hold and press the trackball.
Your call is now on hold.
To un-hold your call:
1. While a call is on hold, press the trackball.
A new menu appears.
2. Scroll to Resume and press the trackball.
You can continue your conversation again.
Adjusting the call volume
Adjusting the call volume, a simple yet important action on your BlackBerry
phone, can be performed by simply pressing the volume up or down key on
the side of your BlackBerry.
Customizing the BlackBerry Phone
For your BlackBerry Phone to work the way you like, you have to first set it
up the way you want it. In this section, we go through some settings that can
make you the master of your BlackBerry Phone.
211
Chapter 11: Calling Your Favorite Person

Setting up your voice mail number
This section shows you how to set up your voice mail access number.
Unfortunately, the instructions for setting up your voice mailbox vary, depend-
ing on your service provider. However, most service providers are more than
happy to walk you through the steps to get your mailbox set up in a jiffy.
To set up your voice mail access number:
1. Open the Phone application.
2. Press the menu key and then select the options (wrench) icon.
A list of phone options appears.
3. Select Voice Mail.
This opens the voice mail configuration screen.
4. Scroll to access the number field and enter your voice mail access
number.
If this field is empty and you don’t know this number, contact your 
service provider and ask for your voice mail access number.
5. Press the menu key and then select Save.
Using call forwarding
On the BlackBerry, you have two types of call forwarding:
 Forward all calls: Any calls to your BlackBerry are forwarded to the
number you designate. Another name for this feature is unconditional
forwarding.
 Forward unanswered calls: Calls that meet different types of conditions
are forwarded to different numbers as follows.
• If busy: You don’t have call waiting turned on, and you’re on the
phone.
• If no answer: You don’t hear your phone ring or somehow are
unable to pick up your phone (perhaps you’re in a meeting).
• If unreachable: You’re out of network coverage and cannot receive
any signals.
Out of the box, your BlackBerry forwards any unanswered calls, regardless of
conditions, to your voice mail number by default. However, you can add new
numbers to forward a call to.
212
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

You need to be within network coverage before can you change your call for-
warding option. After you’re within network coverage, you can change your
call forwarding settings by doing the following:
1. Open the Phone application, press the menu key, and select Options.
A list of phone options appears.
2. Select Call Forwarding.
Your BlackBerry now attempts to connect to the server. If successful,
you’ll see the Call Forwarding screen.
If you don’t see the Call Forwarding screen, wait until you have network
coverage and try again.
3. From the Call Forwarding screen, press the menu key and then select
Edit Numbers.
A list of numbers appears. If this is the first time you’re setting call for-
warding, mostly likely only your voice mail number is on this list.
4. To add a new forwarding number, press the menu key and then select
New Number.
A pop-up menu appears, prompting you to enter the new forwarding
number.
5. In the pop-up window, enter the number you want to forward to and
then press the trackball.
The new number you entered now appears on the call forward number list.
You can add this new number to any call forwarding types or conditions.
6. Press the escape key.
(The escape key is the arrow key to the right of the trackball.) You are
returned to the Call Forwarding screen.
7. Scroll to the If Unreachable field and press the trackball.
A drop-down menu appears, listing numbers from the call forwarding
number list, including the one you just added.
8. Select the number you want to forward to and then press the trackball.
Doing so places the selected number into the If Unreachable field. You
can see this on the Call Forwarding screen.
9. Confirm your changes by pressing the menu key and then 
selecting Save.
213
Chapter 11: Calling Your Favorite Person

Configuring speed dial
Speed dial is a convenient feature on any phone. And after you get used to
having it on a phone system, it’s hard not to use it on other phones, including
your BlackBerry phone.
Viewing your speed dial list
To view your speed dial list:
1. Open the Phone application.
2. Press the menu key and then select View Speed Dial List.
This displays a list of speed dial entries, as shown in Figure 11-3. If you
haven’t set up any speed dials, this list will be empty.
Adding a number to speed dial
Setting up speed dial numbers is as easy as using them. It takes a few sec-
onds to set them up, but you benefit every time you use this feature.
To assign a number to a speed dial slot, follow these steps:
1. Open the Phone application.
2. Press the menu key, select Options, and then select View Speed Dial List.
This displays your list of speed dial numbers .
3. Scroll to an empty speed dial slot, press the menu key, and then select
New Speed Dial.
The BlackBerry Address Book appears so you can select a contact’s
phone number.
Figure 11-3:
The speed
dial list.
214
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

4. Select a contact, and then press the trackball.
The number appears in the speed dial list.
If more than one number is associated with the selected contact in Address
Book, you’re prompted to select which number to add to the speed dial list.
Using speed dial
After you have a few speed dial entries set up, you can start using them. While
on the Home screen or in the Phone application, press a speed dial key. The
call is initiated to the number associated with that particular speed dial key.
Arranging Conference Calls
To have two or more people on the phone with you — the infamous 
conference call — do the following:
1. Use the Phone application to place a call to the first participant.
2. While the first participant is on the phone with you, press the menu
key and then select New Call.
This automatically places the first call on hold and brings up a New Call
screen, as shown in Figure 11-4, prompting you to place another call.
3. Place a call to the second participant by dialing a number, pressing
the trackball, and then selecting Call.
You can dial the number by using the number pad, or you can select a
frequently dialed number from your call log. To place a call from your
Address Book, press the trackball from the New Call screen and select
Call from Address Book. Your BlackBerry then prompts you to select a
contact to dial.
Figure 11-4:
A meeting
participant
is on hold.
215
Chapter 11: Calling Your Favorite Person

The call to the second meeting participant is just like any other phone
call (except that the first participant is still on the other line).
4. While the second participant is on the phone with you, press the
menu key and then select Join, as shown in Figure 11-5.
This reconnects the first participant back with you, along with the
second participant. Now you can discuss away with both participants at
the same time.
Another name for having two people on the phone with you is three-way 
calling, which is not a new concept. If you want to chat with four people or
even ten people on the phone at the same time, you certainly can. Simply
repeat Steps 2 through 4 until all the participants are on the phone.
Talking privately to a conference 
participant
During a conference call, you might want to talk to one participant privately.
This is called splitting your conference call. Here’s how you do it:
1. While on a conference call, press the menu key and then select Split.
A pop-up screen appears, listing all the participants of the conference
call, as shown in Figure 11-6.
2. From the pop-up screen, select the participant with whom you want to
speak privately.
This action places all other participants on hold and connects you to the
participant you selected. On the display screen, you can see to whom
you are connected — this confirms that you selected the right person to
chat with privately.
Figure 11-5:
Join two
people in a
conference
call.
216
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

3. To talk to all participants again, press the menu key and then 
select Join.
Doing so brings you back to the conference call with everyone.
Alternate between phone conversations
Whether you’re in a private conversation during a conference call or you’re
talking to someone while you have someone else on hold, you can switch
between the two conversations by swapping them. Follow these steps:
1. While talking to someone with another person on hold, press the
menu key and then select Swap.
Doing so switches you from the person with whom you’re currently talk-
ing to the person who was on hold.
2. Repeat Step 1 to go back to the original conversation.
Dropping that meeting hugger
If you’ve been on conference calls, you can identify those chatty “meeting
huggers” who have to say something about everything. Don’t you wish that
you could drop them off the call? Well, with your BlackBerry, you can (as long
as you are the meeting moderator or the person who initiates the call).
1. While on a conference call, press the menu key and then select 
Drop Call.
A pop-up screen appears, listing all conference call participants.
Figure 11-6:

217
Chapter 11: Calling Your Favorite Person

2. Select the meeting hugger you want to drop.
That person is disconnected.
3. Conversation can continue as usual.
Communicating Hands Free
Because more and more places prohibit the use of mobile phones without a
hands-free headset, we thought we’d go through the hands-free options you
have on your BlackBerry.
Using the speaker phone
The Speaker Phone function is useful under certain situations, such as when
you’re in a room full of people who want to join in on your phone conversa-
tion. Or you might be all by your lonesome in your office but are stuck root-
ing through your files — hard to do with a BlackBerry scrunched up against
your ear. (We call such moments multitasking — a concept so important we
devote an entire upcoming section to it.)
To switch to the speaker phone while you’re on a phone call, press the 
OP key or press the menu key and then select Activate Speaker Phone.
Pairing your BlackBerry with a 
Bluetooth headset
Because BlackBerries come with a wired hands-free headset, you can start
using yours by simply plugging it into the headset jack on the left side of the
BlackBerry. You adjust the volume of the headset by pressing up or down on
the volume keys, the same as you would adjust the call volume without the
headset.
Using the wired hands-free headset can help you avoid being a police target,
but if you’re multitasking on your BlackBerry, the wired headset can get in
the way and become inconvenient.
This is where the whole Bluetooth wireless thing comes in. You can purchase a
BlackBerry Bluetooth headset to go with your Bluetooth-enabled BlackBerry.
For a list of BlackBerry-compatible Bluetooth headsets, see Chapter 20.
After you purchase a BlackBerry–compatible Bluetooth headset, you can pair
it with your BlackBerry. Think of pairing a Bluetooth headset with your
218
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

BlackBerry as registering the headset with your BlackBerry so that it recog-
nizes the headset.
First things first: You need to prep your headset for pairing. Now, each head-
set manufacturer has a different take on this, so you’ll need to consult your
headset documentation for details. With that out of the way, continue with
the pairing as follows:
1. From the Home screen, press the menu key and then select Bluetooth.
2. Press the menu key to display the Bluetooth menu.
You see the Enable Bluetooth option. If you see the Disable Bluetooth
option instead, you can skip to Step 4.
3. Scroll to Enable Bluetooth and then press the trackball.
This enables Bluetooth on your BlackBerry.
4. Press the menu key to display the Bluetooth menu and then select
Add Device.
You see the Searching for Devices progress bar, um, progressing, as
shown in Figure 11-7 (left). When your BlackBerry discovers the headset,
a Select Device dialog box appears with the name of the headset, as
shown in Figure 11-7 (right).
5. From the Select Device dialog box, select the Bluetooth headset.
A dialog box appears to prompt you for a passkey code to the headset.
6. Enter the passkey and press the trackball.
Normally, the passkey is 0000, but refer to your headset documentation.
After you successfully enter the passkey, you see your headset listed in
the Bluetooth setting.
Figure 11-7:

219
Chapter 11: Calling Your Favorite Person

7. Press the menu key to display the Bluetooth menu and then select
Connect.
Your BlackBerry now attempts to connect to the Bluetooth headset.
8. When you see a screen similar to Figure 11-8, you can start using your
Bluetooth headset.
Using voice dialing
With your headset and the Voice Dialing application, you can truly be hands
free from your BlackBerry. You may be thinking, how do I activate the Voice
Dialing application without touching my BlackBerry? Good question. The
majority of hands-free headsets (Bluetooth or not) come with a multipurpose
button.
Usually, a multipurpose button on a hands-free headset can mute, end, and
initiate a call. Refer to the operating manual of your hands-free headset for
more info.
After your headset is active, press its multipurpose button to activate the
Voice Dialing application. You will be greeted with a voice stating, “Say a 
command.” At this point, simply say “Call name of person or number.” The
Voice Dialing application is good at recognizing the name of the person and
the numbers you dictate. However, we strongly suggest that you try the voice
dialing feature before you need it.

Multitasking While on the Phone
One of the great things about the BlackBerry is that you can use it for other
tasks while you’re on the phone. For example, you can take notes or make a
to-do list. Or you can look up a phone number in the BlackBerry Address
Book that your caller is asking you for. You can even compose an e-mail while
on a call.
It makes sense to multitask while you’re using a hands-free headset or a
speaker phone. Otherwise, your face would be stuck to your BlackBerry, and
you couldn’t engage in your conversation and multitask at the same time.
After you have donned your hands-free headset or have turned on a speaker
phone, you can start multitasking by doing the following:
1. While in a conversation, from the Phone application, press the menu
key and then select Home Screen.
Alternatively, you can simply press the escape key (the arrow key to the
right of the trackball) while in the Phone application to return to your
Home screen. This returns you to the Home screen without terminating
your phone conversation.
2. From the Home screen, you can start multitasking.
Although you can compose e-mails during a phone conversation, you can’t
send the e-mail until you finish the phone conversation. In addition, you can’t
surf the Web while on the phone.
While on the phone and multitasking, however, you can still access the Phone
menu from other applications. For example, from your to-do list, you can end
a call or put a call on hold.
Taking notes while on the phone
To take notes of your call:
1. During a phone conversation, press the menu key and then select
Notes.
This displays the Notes screen.
2. Type notes for the conversation, as shown in Figure 11-9.
When the call ends, the notes are automatically saved for you.
221
Chapter 11: Calling Your Favorite Person

Accessing phone notes
From the call history list (see Figure 11-10), you can access notes that you’ve
made during a call or a conference call. In addition, you can also edit and add
new notes.
Forwarding phone notes
You can forward your phone notes just like any e-mail. While in the Call
History screen (refer to Figure 11-10), press the menu key and then select
Forward.
You can add notes not only while you’re on the phone but also afterwards.

 Using the camera on the BlackBerry Pearl or Curve
 Saving, viewing, organizing, and sharing your photos
 Understanding memory limits
P
earl is the first BlackBerry with a built-in camera, a sleek-looking device
that gains praise that traverses age boundaries. Suddenly, BlackBerry 
is no longer a handheld for stiff hardworking professionals. It’s now cool
enough for teenagers to chug along. Then here comes Curve, a merger
between the size of Pearl and the QWERTY 8800 — and with the 2 mega-
pixel camera, it’s so tempting to renew that two-year plan.
If you are already holding a Pearl or Curve, this chapter is for you. So, hold
your breath as we go to the depths on how you can take advantage of this
great feature. This will be a fun chapter. Not only do we describe in great
detail the features of your camera, we walk you through the steps in captur-
ing that funny pose. Plus, we advance your knowledge of the tricks for taking
the best shots and show you how to store those shots and share them with
your buddies.
Are you holding a BlackBerry that doesn’t have a camera? We’re sad to say
that this chapter is not for you. However, if you have pictures you want to
store and view in your BlackBerry, check out Chapter 13, which describes
working with media files, including a discussion of the Picture application.
Say Cheese
Before you ask someone to pose, let’s examine your BlackBerry first. Your
finger is not blocking the lens, check (the lens is located on the back side of
your BlackBerry). The camera is active, check. It’s not? You see the bottom key
on the right side of your BlackBerry? That’s the key to the kingdom; let’s calls it
the camera key. Press it and you’ll see the Camera application. Alternatively,
you can press the menu key from the Home screen and select Camera.

C’mon, try it! After the camera is active, you should see the image in the
screen that the camera is going to capture. Pressing the camera key again will
capture that image. Ready? Press the camera key. You should hear a funky
sound emulating the shutter of a regular camera. Neat and easy, isn’t it?
Hey, you can take a picture of yourself as well. Turn that BlackBerry back and
you should see a mirror right below the lens. Whatever you see in that mirror
is what the camera captures.
Itching to take more pictures? Hold those snapping fingers of yours. If you
take a few moments first to familiarize yourself with the camera’s features,
the effort could go a long way.
The screen indicators
When you open the Camera application, the first thing you see is the screen
shown in Figure 12-1. The top portion of this screen shows you the image
you’re about to capture. The bottom part contains icons (starting from the
left) that indicate the number of pictures you can capture, focusing, and
flash. Prepare to dissect.
Choosing the picture quality
BlackBerry Pearl can capture up to 1.3 megapixels and the Curve up to 2
megapixels of resolution. You probably don’t need this much resolution
because it also requires a bigger space to save your image. This is why 
your BlackBerry allows you to set three picture qualities: Normal, Fine, 
and SuperFine. The default setting is Normal, which is the lowest quality 
but gives you the largest number of pictures you can save — 200.
The trade-off with using Normal is that the picture quality won’t be as
smooth or fine compared to the Fine and SuperFine settings. You should
choose a setting based on how you plan to use the picture. If you’re taking a
shot of a breathtaking landscape in which you want to capture every possible
detail and print it later, you’ll want the SuperFine setting. On the other hand,
if you’re just taking pictures of your friends’ faces so you can attach them as
Caller ID, Normal is appropriate.
Changing picture quality is a snap. Here’s how:
1. Open the Camera application.
2. Press the menu key and then select Options.
224
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

3. Highlight Picture Quality and then press the Space key.
Pressing the Space key toggles the picture quality value between Normal,
Fine, and SuperFine. You may have to press the Space key twice to select
the setting you want.
4. Press the menu key and then select Save.
The picture quality you’ve chosen is now active.
Zooming and focusing
Focus! We mean your camera. You need to be steady to get a good focus
while taking the shots. Although it’s convenient to use one hand while taking
pictures, you would soon discover that most of the time you’ll get a blurry
image. Our advice is to use both hands, one holding the BlackBerry steady
and the other clicking the button. This is even more important if you’re
zooming in. Yes, your camera is capable of up to 5x digital zoom. Use the
trackball for this; scrolling up zooms in and scrolling down zooms out. While
using the zoom, the value in the indicator changes from 1x, 2x, up to 5x and
vice versa, depending on the direction of your scroll.
When zooming, your thumb is already on the trackball. What a convenient
way to take the picture — just press.

Setting the flash
The rightmost indicator on the Camera screen is the flash. The default is
Automatic, which shows an arrow with the letter A. Automatic means it
detects the amount of light you have at the moment you capture the image.
Where it’s dark, the flash fires; otherwise it will not. You can also turn the flash
on or off. When set to off, the arrow image is encircled with a diagonal line,
just like you see on the Don’t Walk traffic signal. You can toggle the settings 
in Camera’s Options screen, which is accessible by pressing the menu key.
Working with Pictures
You’ve amassed pictures and you want to view, delete, or perhaps organize
them. No problem.
Viewing
Viewing a picture is one of the common functions you’re going to do with
your camera. And it’s also one of the default behaviors. After taking a picture,
right then and there, the screen changes to view mode, allowing you to see
the image you just captured, as shown in Figure 12-2. If you’re browsing
through your picture folders, you can view an individual picture by highlight-
ing it and pressing the trackball.

Creating a slide show
While viewing the list of pictures in a folder, press the menu key and select
Slide Show. Voilà! Your BlackBerry displays your pictures one at a time at a reg-
ular time interval. The default interval between each picture is two seconds; if
you’re not happy with this interval, change it in the Options screen. Again, the
Options screen is available by pressing the menu key and selecting Options.
Trashing
If you don’t like the image you captured, you can delete it. Just highlight the
picture you want trashed and press the Del key, and then select Delete from
the confirmation screen that follows. Note that you can do the same right
after taking the picture; just click the trash can icon (refer to Figure 12-2).
Listing file names versus thumbnails
The default setting when you open a folder packed with pictures is a listing of
thumbnails, which is a small preview of your pictures. A preview is nice, but
if you’re trying to search for a picture file and know the file name, wouldn’t it
be nice if you just saw a listing of names instead of thumbnails? While you’re
in a folder, press the trackball and select View List. That’s exactly what you
get: a list of all the pictures in the folder. What’s neat is that the option also
displays the size of the file.
Picture properties
Curious about the amount of memory your picture is using? Or maybe you
just want to know the time you took it. While highlighting the picture from a
list or viewing it, press the menu key and select Properties. What you see
next is a screen similar to Figure 12-3. This screen displays the location of
your picture, the size of the file, and when it was last modified.

Chapter 12: Photos on Your BlackBerry

Organizing your pictures
You might be interested in putting some order into where your pictures are
stored and how they are named. Organization is all about time and the best
use of it. After all, you want to enjoy looking at your pictures — not looking
for them. BlackBerry enables you to rename and move pictures to different
folders. Plus, you can create folders too. With those capabilities, you should
be on your way to organization nirvana.
Renaming a picture
While capturing a picture, the image is saved in your BlackBerry. However,
the name of the picture is generic, something like IMGxxxx, where the x is a
number. You should make it a habit to rename it as soon as you’ve finished
capturing it. It is easier to recognize Dean blows birthday candles than
IMG0029. Renaming is a snap. Here’s how:
1. While the picture is displayed on the screen or highlighted in the list,
press the menu key and select Rename.
A Rename screen appears, as shown in Figure 12-4.
2. Enter the name you want for this picture and then select OK.
Your picture is renamed.
Creating a new folder
Being the organized person you are, you must be wondering about the fold-
ers we mentioned. Don’t fret; it’s simple to create one. Here’s how:
1. In the Camera screen, press the menu key and then select View Pictures.
The screen displays the list of pictures in the current folder and an Up
icon for you to navigate up to the folder above this folder.
Figure 12-4:
Rename
your picture
here.
228
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

2. Select the Up icon to navigate to the main folder where you want your
new folder to be created.
You should be within the folder where you want your new folder to be
created. If not, repeat this step and use your trackball to navigate to 
that folder.
3. Press the menu key and then select New Folder.
4. Enter the name of the folder and then select OK.
Your folder is created.
Moving pictures
There are many reasons for moving pictures between folders. The most obvi-
ous reason is to organize your pictures. Want to try it? Follow these steps:
1. In the Camera screen, press the menu key and then select View
Pictures.
The screen displays the list of pictures in the current folder. If the pic-
ture you want to move is not in this folder, click the Up icon to navigate
up to other folders.
2. Highlight the picture you want to move, press the menu key, and then
select Move.
The screen that follows allows you to navigate to the folder where you
want to move this picture.
3. Click the Up icon and use the trackball to navigate to the folder where
you want to move this picture.
4. Press the menu key and then select Move Here.
Your picture is moved.
Sharing your pictures
There’s no joy in taking great pictures if you’re the only one seeing them,
right? Your BlackBerry has several options for sharing your bundle of joy.
Highlight one of those pictures, and then press the menu key. You should see
the following options:
 Send As Email: This option goes directly to the compose e-mail screen,
with the currently selected picture as an attachment.
 Send to Messenger Contact: This option displays a screen with a list of
your BlackBerry Messenger contacts. This allows you to choose the con-
tact to whom you want to send the selected picture.
229
Chapter 12: Photos on Your BlackBerry

 Send As MMS: Similar to Send As Email, this opens a compose MMS
screen with the currently selected picture as an attachment. The only
difference is that it will first display Address Book, letting you select the
person’s phone number to receive the MMS before proceeding to the
compose screen.
 Send Using Bluetooth: This allows you to send the picture to any device
that is capable of communicating through Bluetooth. See Chapter 14 for
details on how to enable and pair Bluetooth devices.
Setting a picture as Caller ID
Wouldn’t it be nice if when you received a call from someone, his or her 
picture appeared on the screen? Yup, you can do that. If you have the face 
of your buddy inside your BlackBerry, view it (see the previous section on
viewing pictures), press the menu key, and select Set as Caller ID. (If you
don’t have pictures of your friends, now is the time to show off your gem 
and start clicking.)
Setting a Home screen image
Suppose you have a stunning picture that you want to use as the background
image for your BlackBerry. Just view the picture (see the previous discussion
on viewing pictures), press the menu key, and select Set as Home Screen
Image. You can always reset the Home screen image by going back to the
same menu screen and selecting Reset Home Screen Image.
Setting Camera Memory Options
The camera in your BlackBerry is a piece of hardware and a computer pro-
gram. It is therefore within the bounds of your BlackBerry’s available
memory. As such, the good people at RIM incorporated some parameters
that you can set so that you’ll enjoy the use of your camera fully while not
affecting other important features that share the same memory resource.
Following are two important option settings you need to know:
 Device Memory Limit: The amount of device memory your camera can
use. The values are 12M, 15M, 20M, and 25M (1M is 1000K). To get a feel
for how many pictures this is, look at the properties of an existing pic-
ture and note its file size.
230
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

 Reserved Pictures Memory: The amount of memory BlackBerry
reserves for the camera to store pictures. Possible values are 0M, 2M,
5M, 8M, 10M, and 12M. This value can’t be set greater than the Device
Memory Limit.
If you open the Camera application and see “Could not start the camera.
Close other applications and try opening the camera again,” your BlackBerry
is running out of memory for the camera to run smoothly. One solution is to
follow what the message says. Press the Shift and the escape keys at the
same time and a list of applications appears. (The escape key is to the right
of the trackball and has the curving arrow symbol.) Go through these appli-
cations and close them. If this doesn’t work, the all-reliable reset (taking the
battery out and putting it back in) is your ultimate solution.

I
f there’s a word to describe today’s phone market trends, it’s convergence.
Your BlackBerry is one of the latest participants in this convergence race.
We probably don’t have to tell you this, but in addition to sending and receiv-
ing e-mail and being a phone, a camera (Curve and Pearl), and a PDA device,
your BlackBerry is a portable media player. In the palm of your hand, you can
listen to music, watch video clips, sample ring tones, and view pictures. These
media capabilities are all bundled into an application with a name you would
recognize even after sipping a couple of pints of strong ale — Media. This
chapter is all about Media and how you can take advantage of its capabilities.
Accessing Media
To run Media, simply press the menu key from the Home screen and select
Media. Or if you have Media chosen as one of the five applications you dis-
play in the Home screen, you can select it directly by clicking its icon.
Media is a collection of media types: Music, Video, Ringtones, and Pictures.
And each one is represented with an icon upon opening Media, as shown in
Figure 13-1. You don’t need to be Einstein to figure out what each one of these
media types is for. Ready to have some fun?

Folder navigation
Whether you want to play music, watch a video clip, test a ring tone, or view
pictures from your BlackBerry, you have to navigate to the location of your
media files. If you select one of the Media types (such as Pictures), it will 
display the locations where you can navigate. Media files are stored in 
three types of memory locations, namely Media Card, Device Memory, and
Preloaded Media. You have the option to read and write to the Media Card
and the Device Memory locations. The Preloaded Media location can be only
read and not written to.
These memory locations are organized in folders, as shown in Figure 13-2. To
navigate inside, simply select the folder. If a folder contains subfolders, keep
opening folders until you find the files you want. To move back up the folder
hierarchy, select Up.
Let the music play
To play music on your BlackBerry, you don’t need a quarter. Just select Music
from the Media screen and a folder structure similar to the one shown on the
right in Figure 13-2 appears, with Music as the heading of the screen rather
than Pictures. Navigate through this folder structure to find the music file
you want.

234
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

After you find the file, simply select it and it will begin playing, with a screen
as shown in Figure 13-3. BlackBerry supports many music formats (with file
extensions), including
 ACC: Audio compression formats AAC, AAC+, and EAAC+ (aac and m4a)
 AMR: Adaptive Multi Rate-Narrow Band (AMR-NB) speech coder standard
(mmr and 3gp)
 MIDI: Polyphonic MIDI (mid, midi, and smf)
 MP3: MPEG Part 1 and Part 2 audio layer 3 (mp3 and mp4)
 WAV: Wave files (wav)
Selecting each file to play sometimes can be a hassle — and not even a sensi-
ble thing to do if you’re in a gym or jogging. Fret not. You would have asked
for this feature in the first place, so RIM added an option for you to play all
songs in a folder or even in all subfolders. While you are in a folder, press the
menu key and select Play All to play every song in the current folder and all
subfolders, or select Play Folder to play songs in the current folder.
Note that there is no fast forwarding or rewinding in a traditional way, but
you can position where to start playing by moving the progress slider. Just
use the trackball to select the progress slider, and then scroll the trackball to
change the slider’s position. Press the trackball again and the music starts
playing from that position.

The earpiece mike combo that comes with your BlackBerry is only for one
ear. This might be an issue when you are in a noisy area. To improve your
experience, you can buy a stereo headset. And yes, a Bluetooth headset is a
good option.
Now showing
To play video clips, the general steps are no different than playing music files.
Just select Video from the Media screen and again a screen similar to Figure 13-2
appears, but with Video as the heading rather than Pictures. Navigate to the
video file you want, select it, and a contender for the funniest home video plays.
Video format supported are 3gp, avi, mov, and mp4. Start collecting now.
If you press the menu key in one of the folders containing video files, you can
select Play All to play every video file in the current folder and all its subfold-
ers, or select Play Folder to play every video file in only the current folder.
Lord of the ring tones
Ah, the proliferation of ring tones; that’s history. Nothing beats hearing a
loud funky ring tone while you’re sleeping on a bus or a train. Whether you
want a real Matchbox Twenty’s “3 A.M.” song or the old-fashioned digital
repercussions or anything that would annoy the guy sitting next to you, you
have that flexibility. Give a toast to your BlackBerry. Of course you want to
hear ring tones that come with your BlackBerry. There’s a bunch, so enjoy.
Simply select Ringtones from the Media screen. What you see next is the
same navigation screen that Music and Video use (refer to Figure 13-2).
Again, your BlackBerry comes with a decent selection of ring tones, stored in
Preloaded Media. You can select this folder or a folder where you’ve stored
any ring tones you’ve acquired. After you are in a folder showing a list of ring
tones, select one from the list and it will start playing. You can also play all
the ring tones in a folder by pressing the menu key and selecting either Play
Folder or Play All. Play All includes the ring tones in the subfolders as well.
If you find a ring tone you like, you can make it the default ring by highlight-
ing it, pressing the menu key, and selecting Set As Phone Tune. A ring tone is
similar to a music file and includes the following music formats: aac, m4a,
midi, mmr, and mp3.
236
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

Picture this
Folks who upgraded from an older BlackBerry may know Pictures. It’s one of
the intuitive applications RIM kept in BlackBerry Pearl, 8300, 8800, and Curve
and probably in the newer models that come out after this writing. Pictures
allows you to view images, with zoom and rotate capabilities.
Select Pictures from the Media screen and what you see next is the familiar
folder structure. Navigate to this folder until you find the picture you’re look-
ing for. After you find the picture file, just select it. Easy does it, right?
Check out Preloaded Media. Your BlackBerry comes with nice pictures you
can use as the background image of the Home screen. There are also some
cartoon images that you can temporarily assign to your contacts as Caller IDs
until you get a chance to take their pictures.
Zoom to details
Is that a pimple? No, it’s not. Let’s zoom in. While viewing an image, press the
trackball and select Zoom. A tiny nonobtrusive slider bar appears on the left
side of the image. Now, use your trackball: Scrolling up zooms in and scrolling
down zooms out. While scrolling, the slider bar indicates the degree of zoom.
The exact center of this bar is the original image (no zooming applied). You
can easily go back to the original zoom size by pressing the menu key and
selecting Zoom All.
Rotate it
Want to view yourself upside down? Not really. But sometimes your pictures
may be best viewed sideways. While you’re viewing an image in Pictures,
press the trackball and select Rotate. The image rotates 90 degrees clock-
wise. By repeating the same steps, you can keep rotating it; each time is an
additional 90-degree clockwise rotation.
Turn it down or blast it
Whether you’re listening to music or watching a video, adjusting the volume
is easy because your BlackBerry comes with dedicated volume buttons.
They’re located on the top right side of the device. The top button with the
plus sign turns the volume up and the one with the minus sign turns the
volume down. The volume slider you see in the screen reflects any presses
you made on the volume buttons.
237
Chapter 13: Getting Entertained with BlackBerry Media Center

Commonly used navigation
Whether you’re viewing a picture, listening to music, or watching a video clip,
you can easily jump forward or backward to the next item in the list. Press
the menu key while you are viewing an image, listening to songs, or watching
a video clip. On the menu that appears, you see the following items:
 Next: Jumps to the next item in the list. This item appears only if there’s
an item after this media file in the current folder.
 Previous: Jumps to the previous item. This item appears only if there’s a
previous item in the current folder.
 Delete: Deletes the media file.
 Move: Moves the file to a different folder.
 Rename: Renames the media file.
 Properties: Displays a screen showing the location of the media file, its
size, and the time it was last modified.
Working with Media Files
Are you always on top of the new gizmo trends? Nowadays, methods of
acquiring media files are evolving. Ten years back, who would have thought
that we’d be buying music from a tiny SD card from Best Buy or downloading
music from an “all you can eat” monthly subscription?

Sure, technologies are exciting, but most of us are happy maintaining a music
collection in one form or another, be it CDs or a digital format on our com-
puter. Some day, we’ll wake up with a technology that doesn’t require us to
deal with constantly copying media files from this collection to our handheld
music players. But for now, enjoying music while on the move means manag-
ing these files. Media is a great music player, but without music files it’s as
useless as a guitar without strings. Enough with chitchat, let’s get on with it.
Introduction to BlackBerry 
Desktop Media Manager
Heard of Roxio? Roxio is known for their CD ripping software. But that’s not
all; the software allows you to integrate media files to your SmartPhone. And
just recently, RIM licensed Roxio and incorporated it into their BlackBerry
Desktop Media Manager. (We’re going to refer to it here as Media Manager.)
That’s good news for you because you can now avail yourself of fantastic fea-
tures such as ripping CD songs, converting media files for optimal playback on
your BlackBerry, and managing these files and syncing them to your device.
If you have an old version of Media Manager, it’s not a problem. Point your
desktop Internet browser to na.blackberry.com/eng/services/
desktop for directions on downloading the latest version for free and
installing it on your PC.
As we mention, this new Media Manager has a lot to offer, and we cannot
describe it fully here. But we do describe the necessary features to get you
started. What we do in this section is familiarize you with the interface and
then show you how to copy a video file into your BlackBerry. On the way,
you’ll see how easy the process is and get your media files converted for
optimum playback on your device.
Accessing Media Manager
Media Manager is accessible through BlackBerry Desktop Manager, which 
is described in detail in Chapter 16. To get to Desktop Manager on your PC,
click the Windows Start icon, select All Programs, select BlackBerry and then
select Desktop Manager. BlackBerry Desktop Manager appears, as shown in
Figure 13-4. From this screen, you can run Media Manager by double-clicking
its icon.
The Media Manager screen
The Media Manager screen may look intimidating at first glance, as you can
see in Figure 13-5. But it’s really an intuitive interface — plus, it follows the
same interface as Windows Explorer. As on the Windows Explorer screen, the
left side is where you navigate to your folders and files, and the right side dis-
plays the files in the folder that’s currently selected on the left.
239
Chapter 13: Getting Entertained with BlackBerry Media Center

The screen is divided not only into left and right portions but also into top
and bottom sections. The top section looks the same as the bottom section
and they behave the same, just as you would expect in Windows Explorer. So,
why two sections? Having two allows you to move or copy files easily. On a
copy operation, for example, one section can behave as the source and the
other section can be the destination. By simply dragging the files between
the two sections, you can copy them to the location you want without leaving
the same screen. Neat, right? So, start locating those media files and copying
them to Media Manager.
Importing media files to Media Manager
A quick and easy way to import media files is to use Windows Explorer to
navigate to the media files you want, and then drag and drop them into Media
Manager. You can drag and drop them to the folder in the left part of the
screen, where the folder tree appears, or the right part, where the files are
listed. Just make sure that when you are doing the latter, the current folder in
the tree view is the folder where you want the media files to be imported.
Without using Windows Explorer, you can also use Media Manager itself to
locate the files you want. The trick is to change the left-side view in one of the
sections to Folders. You can choose from either the top or bottom section. If

Figure 13-4:

240
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

you look closely on the top of any of the sections, you should see four tabs. The
first tab, My Media, is the default view. The Folders tab has the icon of — guess
what? — a folder. Click the folder icon and you see a tree view, but this time, it
looks exactly as you see it in Windows Explorer, as shown in Figure 13-6.
The files can be in your local hard drive or a network folder accessible by
your desktop computer.
Remember that you have two Explorer-type sections, top and bottom. Use the
top in the Folders view to locate the media files, and leave the bottom section
in the My Media view to import the files. After you find your files, it’s just a
matter of dragging and dropping.
Adding a media file to the BlackBerry
On the Media Manager screen, the fourth tab, My Devices — the one with the
cellphone icon — is used to navigate your BlackBerry, as shown in Figure
13-7. When viewing this tab, make sure that your BlackBerry is connected to
your desktop computer with the USB cable that came with the device. Upon
establishing a connection, Desktop Manager prompts you to enter a pass-
word if your BlackBerry has one.
The My Devices view displays the folder structure inside your BlackBerry. The
top two folders are the type of storage device: Device Memory and Media Card.
We recommend that you don’t touch the Device Memory folder because it is
limited in size and this memory is used by your device to do necessary oper-
ations such as storing e-mails.

Chapter 13: Getting Entertained with BlackBerry Media Center

The Media Card folder is your microSD storage. When you click its plus sign,
you should see a folder named blackBerry and under blackBerry the four
media folders (music, pictures, ringtones, and video). To copy files, drag and
drop your media files from the My Media view to any one of the folders here
in My Devices. You can also drag and drop an entire album. After dropping a
media file, you are prompted to convert the file into a format viewable by
your BlackBerry, as shown in Figure 13-8.
Not sure which one to choose? The safest bet on this screen is the default
selected option, which is Convert for Optimal Playback. If you choose Advanced
Conversion Options, you see another screen that allows you to downgrade the
quality of the conversion to minimize the required memory. For video files,
Advanced Conversion Options allows you to crop the video so that the entire
screen is filled instead of seeing dark margins that can result due to aspect ratio
differences between the BlackBerry screen and the original video format.
Of course, you can also select Copy with No Conversion, which copies the file
faster. The file will be copied to your BlackBerry as is, but it might not play in
your BlackBerry.

Other features of Media Manager
We recommend that you spend some time
exploring Media Manager because it has inter-
esting features to discover that you might find
useful. Here’s a quick rundown of what to
expect:
 Import media files
 Create albums
 E-mail media files
 Share media files by using the Internet
 Set audio tags
 Share files on your home network by using
MediaSpace
 Enhance photos and apply special effects
to photos by using PhotoSuite
 Create panoramic images from multiple
photographs
 View or play media files in succession by
using QuickShows
 Record audio
 Customize the printing of photos

Creating an album
Having the ability to locate your media files, be it on your local drive or your
network, is nice. But you might find a need to organize your media files fur-
ther, perhaps as a playlist or a birthday party album. Not a problem. Media
Manager gives you the ability to create an album, which is another way of
grouping files into a folder.
Here’s how you go about creating an album:
1. On the Media Manager screen, click the My Media tab to switch to My
Media view.
The My Media tab is the first tab on the screen.
2. Right-click My Albums and select New Album from the menu that
appears (see Figure 13-9).
New Album is added to the My Albums folder. Because My Album is not
a descriptive name, we recommend that you rename it. The next step
shows you how.
3. Expand My Albums by clicking the plus sign beside it.
4. Right-click My Album and select Rename from the menu that appears.
5. Type the name you want for this album.
Having an empty album is not your ultimate goal, right? You want your files in
there. So go ahead and follow the same steps described in the previous sec-
tion, “Importing media files to Media Manager.”
Synchronizing with iTunes
If you have an iPod, it’s likely that you’re using iTunes and maintaining a
playlist and perhaps a subscription to podcasts. Would you like to sync your
BlackBerry with iTunes? Well, don’t we all. Unfortunately, this can’t be done
out of the box. After all, iTunes is not a RIM product. However, for only $9.95,
you can buy software called PearlTunes (http://pocketmac.net) that
bridges iTunes to your BlackBerry and allows you to copy iTunes media files
to your device.

Chapter 13: Getting Entertained with BlackBerry Media Center

Sharing media files by using Bluetooth
We love sharing, especially if we’re at the receiving end, right? You can send
your media files to any Bluetooth-capable device. Here’s how:
1. From the Media screen, select the media type.
2. Select a media folder.
You may have to drill down to the folder to find the media file you’re
looking for.
3. Press the menu key and then select Send Using Bluetooth.
At this point, Bluetooth displays all paired Bluetooth devices. (Refer 
to Chapter 14 more on Bluetooth enabling and pairing devices.)
4. Select the Bluetooth-enabled device.
5. Select Send.
BlackBerry starts sending the file.
Downloading tunes
RIM has set up a Web site where you can download new ring tones. Simply
point Browser to http://mobile.blackberry.com/mss/ringtone_
catalog and you get a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 13-10. From
this page, you can sample and download alarms, notifiers, and tunes. And did
we mention that it’s free?
Just select the ring tone you want from the three categories and it will begin
playing. After the tune plays, you can save it by pressing the menu key and
selecting Save. RIM isn’t the only site where you can find ring tones. The Web
is a wonderful place, so go hunting.

Chapter 14
Getting around with 
BlackBerry GPS
In This Chapter
 Using GPS safely
 Preparing to use GPS on your BlackBerry
 Choosing a GPS application
A
few years back when some of the network carriers in North America
introduced GPS on their version of the BlackBerry, we were quite
impressed . . . until we tried it. The response time was slow, and it wasn’t
accurate. On top of that, the network carriers charged users an arm and a 
leg for this inferior service. As it turns out, those GPS functions were imple-
mented by using the network. What does that mean? There wasn’t an actual
GPS embedded in the BlackBerry. How low tech!
Today, the BlackBerry 8800 model comes with a GPS and works quite 
well. Even if you don’t have the 8800, there are still ways to pair up your
BlackBerry with an external GPS through Bluetooth. No matter how you 
look at it, it’s hard to be lost with a BlackBerry in your hands.
Putting Safety First
Some GPS features are useful not only while you’re walking on the street 
but also while you’re driving a car. Although you’ll be tempted to use your
BlackBerry GPS while driving, we strongly suggest that you not adjust it while
you’re driving.
Before you start using BlackBerry GPS in your car, you need to get a
BlackBerry car holder (preferably a car kit with a car charger) and resolve
the BlackBerry backlight timeout issue.

You can buy a car kit on the Internet by doing a simple search for BlackBerry
car kit. Or go to one of the following links:
 www.shopblackberry.com
 www.blackberrystuff.com/blackberry_car_kit.htm
By default, the longest your BlackBerry’s backlight can stay on is two min-
utes, so you need something to allow your BlackBerry’s backlight to stay on
as long as you need GPS. A free utility called BBLight does just that. You can
get it by going to www.blackberryfordummies.com/bblight.html.
Now that you have all you need to keep you safe, keep on reading.
What You Need
For GPS to work on your BlackBerry, it needs navigation maps, which are usu-
ally downloaded in little pieces as required. And because these maps are
downloaded, you must be subscribed to a data plan and have a radio signal.
If you did not subscribe to an unlimited data plan from your network carrier,
be aware that the more you use your GPS as you move about, the more data
(map pieces) you’ll download, which means the more charges you’ll incur.
You also need a GPS, which can be built in or external. The BlackBerry 8800
model has an internal GPS. The BlackBerry Curve (8830) and the BlackBerry
Pearl (8100) support an external GPS connected through Bluetooth.
In summary, for your BlackBerry GPS to work, you need
 A BlackBerry with a built-in GPS or a BlackBerry with an external GPS
and a Bluetooth connection
 A data plan from your network carrier (an unlimited data plan is 
recommended)
 To be in an area where you have a radio signal (so you can download 
the maps)
We won’t cover the exact steps on how to pair up a Bluetooth-enabled
BlackBerry to an external GPS, because we probably don’t have the same
external GPS as you have. But the general steps are as follows:
1. Make sure your external GPS is ready for pairing.
Please refer to your external GPS for more information on how to pre-
pare it for “discovery.”
246
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

2. From the Home screen, press the menu key and then select the
options (wrench) icon.
3. Select Bluetooth.
4. Press the menu key and then select Enable Bluetooth.
You see a screen of paired Bluetooth devices or, if you’ve never paired
with a device, you see a blank screen.
Pairing with a Bluetooth device simply means to connect with another
Bluetooth device, such as a hands-free headset.
5. Press the menu key and then select Add Device.
Your BlackBerry starts scanning for a nearby device, as shown in 
Figure 14-1. Make sure your external GPS is next to you.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions on your BlackBerry to finish pairing
with your external GPS.
This step usually involves entering a 4-digit password to pair up with the
GPS. Refer to your GPS manual for further information.
Garmin sells an external GPS that works with your BlackBerry. Find out more
by visiting this link on your PC: http://www.garmin.com/garmin/cms/
site/us/onthego/.
Your GPS Application Choices
We have identified three GPS applications that you can use on your
BlackBerry. They are
 BlackBerry Map
 Google Maps
 TeleNav GPS Navigator
Both BlackBerry Map and Google Maps are free. The icons for all of them are
pictured in Figure 14-2.
Figure 14-1:

Chapter 14: Getting around with BlackBerry GPS

BlackBerry Map
Out of the box, your BlackBerry comes with the BlackBerry Map application
(refer to Figure 14-2).
If you have a BlackBerry 8800 model with Cingular as your network carrier,
you have to pay extra to get BlackBerry Map installed on your BlackBerry. 
No worries, we show you alternatives to BlackBerry Map that still use your
BlackBerry GPS.
With or without GPS (built-in or external), you can use BlackBerry Map to do
the following (see Figure 14-3):
 Find a location by typing an address or by using Address Book
 Get point-to-point directions
 E-mail or SMS a location to colleagues and friends
 Turn GPS on or off
 Zoom in and out of the map
Of course, with GPS turned on, you can track where you are and follow point-
to-point directions.

Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

Google Maps
Google Maps is the mobile version of map.google.com. It has most of the
features of the online version, including satellite imaging and traffic informa-
tion. Best of all, it’s free.
Like BlackBerry Map, you can use Google Maps even without a GPS, but it
gets better. You can search for businesses and landmarks, just as youdo on
map.google.com. It’s like having the ultimate 411 (with a map) at the tip of
your fingers.
Because Google Maps does not come with your BlackBerry, you need to
download it. To do so, go to www.google.com/gmm. After it downloads, its
icon appears on your Home screen (refer to Figure 14-2).
After Google Maps is loaded, press the menu key to display the menu shown
in Figure 14-4.
From the menu, you can do the following:
 Find businesses and landmarks, including phone numbers, address
information, and Web addresses
 Find and map exact addresses
 Get step-by-step directions from point A to point B
 View satellite images of the current map (Figure 14-5, left)
 Get traffic information for major highways
With GPS on, you can see your current location as a blue blinking dot on
screen (Figure 14-5, right).
Here are some keyboard shortcuts for Google Maps:
 Zoom in: I key or JK key on the SureType keyboard
 Zoom out: O key or DF key on the SureType keyboard
 Go to the current location: 0 key
Figure 14-4:

249
Chapter 14: Getting around with BlackBerry GPS

You need to have a radio signal to download maps to your BlackBerry. In
addition, we recommend that you have an unlimited data plan if you are a fre-
quent user of the GPS feature on your BlackBerry.
TeleNav GPS Navigator
TeleNav GPS Navigator is a full-featured GPS solution. It’s meant as a GPS
device replacement, which means the folks at TeleNav want you to use your
BlackBerry in the car. At the time of this writing, they did not have a fix for
the issue of BlackBerry backlight timeout — this means that about every two
minutes, you must press a key on your BlackBerry so that the light remains
on. This can be dangerous while driving.
TeleNav’s feature list is extensive. From 3-D maps (see Figure 14-6), to a real-
time compass, to finding Wi-Fi spots, the list goes on and on. The feature we
like the most is the human-voice step-by-step driving directions.
The extensive features come at a price. Depending on your network carrier,
TeleNav costs about $10 a month. They do offer a 60-day free trial. Visit
www.telenav.com for more information. After the product is downloaded,
an icon appears on your screen (refer to Figure 14-2).

Wi-Fi and Using BlackBerry 
as a Laptop Modem
In This Chapter
 Setting up your laptop
 Making the first connection 
 Setting up Wi-Fi
A
s amazing as your BlackBerry already is, you might find this chapter a
bit unbelievable. On top of all those other BlackBerry features is the
capability of using your BlackBerry as a laptop modem to connect to the
Internet from anywhere (well, almost). If you have a long commute, this chap-
ter will not only make your traveling time more productive but also save you
money on wireless broadband (if you have an unlimited data plan). 
The steps required to use this feature are more technical when compared to
those in other chapters. Also, depending on your network service provider,
the setup to use your BlackBerry as a laptop modem might not be exactly as
described here. We chose to write the steps for BlackBerry from T-Mobile
(North America) as an example. We also provide online resources for you to
get more information regarding other carriers at www.blackberryfor
dummies.com/laptopmodem.
We would like to give credit to the BlackBerry enthusiast who discovered this
hidden feature. Although we don’t know who figured this out first, the folks at
www.blackberryforums.com provide extensive documentation on how to
set up your laptop and BlackBerry to connect to the Internet. 
In addition, we want to point out that this chapter serves only as starting
point for using your BlackBerry as a laptop modem rather that as an authori-
tative source. 
Finally, for those of you who have a BlackBerry equipped with Wi-Fi capabil-
ity, we end this chapter with how to set up your BlackBerry to use a nearby
wireless access point.
Now that the disclaimers and credits are out of the way, here we go!

Preparing for Connection
Before you connect your BlackBerry, have the following ready:
 A laptop with Windows XP installed. We didn’t test this on Vista, but it
should work similarly.
 A USB cable.
 A BlackBerry with a data plan. If you don’t have an unlimited data plan
with your service provider, keep track of how much time you spend on
the Internet while connected via your BlackBerry.
 BlackBerry Desktop Manager installed on your laptop. To make sure Black-
Berry Desktop Manager is installed, choose Start➪Programs➪BlackBerry.
If BlackBerry Desktop Manager is installed, you’ll see it under the
BlackBerry menu. If BlackBerry Desktop Manager isn’t installed, use 
the CD that came with your BlackBerry to install it. Check with your 
network carrier for details.
Next, you need to make sure that the modem driver on your laptop is working:
1. On the laptop, choose Start➪Settings➪Control Panel.
The Control Panel window appears, listing various options.
2. Click Phone and Modem Options.
The Phone and Modem Options screen appears.
3. Click the Modems tab.
If BlackBerry Desktop Manager is installed properly, you see the words
Standard Modem on the screen, as shown in Figure 15-1.

4. Highlight Standard Modem and then click the Properties button.
The Standard Modem Properties screen appears.
5. Click the Diagnostics tab (see Figure 15-2).
6. Click the Query Modem button.
Depending on your BlackBerry model, you should see a string of text
similar to Figure 15-3. It’s okay if you don’t see exactly the same text as
that shown in the figure. 
If you see a warning message when you click the Query Modem button,
try to restart your laptop. Then connect your BlackBerry with your
laptop and retry Step 6.
7. Click the Advanced tab.
A screen similar to Figure 15-4 appears.
8. In the Extra Initialization Commands box, type one of the following,
depending on your network carrier:
Carrier
Type this
T-Mobile USA
+cgdcont=1,”IP”,”wap.voicestream.com”
Verizon
Leave it blank
Cingular

11. Still in the Internet Account Information screen, uncheck both check
boxes, and then click Next.
You should see the Complete screen at this point.
12. Click the Add a Shortcut check box and then click Finish.
Your connection is added to the desktop.
We know you’ll be tempted to try the connection right now, but you need to
make sure a few settings are correct:
1. From the desktop, double-click the connection you just made. 
You see a screen similar to Figure 15-6. The connection should be named
BlackBerry Modem (unless you named it something else). 
2. In the connection window, click the Properties button.
3. Click the Networking tab.
4. Select Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), and then click the Properties button.
5. Click the Advanced button.
6. Uncheck the Use IP Header Compression check box.
7. Click the OK buttons to close all dialog boxes.
Before you click the Dial button, make sure that your BlackBerry is con-
nected to your laptop and you have opened BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
The last thing (we promise): Whenever you connect, make sure that your
BlackBerry has a radio signal and you are not in a bad coverage area. 
256
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

After you’ve done all that, give it a shot! If all is well, you get a confirmation
as shown in Figure 15-7.
Using Wi-Fi on Your BlackBerry
What’s Wi-Fi? Well, without getting too technical, Wi-Fi networks use radio
waves over the IEEE 802.11 protocol to provide a connection to the Internet.
There are open Wi-Fi networks and secured ones. What do you need to know
about open versus secured Wi-Fi networks? Simply remember that open net-
works allow you to connect without a security password but could be unse-
cured (think identity theft and people snooping on what you are browsing).
Secured Wi-Fi networks are protected by a security password, so you need to
set up a password. Wi-Fi networks can also be referred to as access points or
hotspots, which you’ve probably seen it at airports, coffee houses, or libraries. 
How does a Wi-Fi network benefit your BlackBerry experience? For starters, if
you do not have an unlimited data plan, you’ll probably save a few bucks
while browsing the Net if you’re connected to a free Wi-Fi network. If you
have an unlimited data plan, you can still benefit from the overall connection
speed for fast Internet browsing and chatting on your BlackBerry. If you’re an

enterprise user, you can VPN into your corporate network to access sensitive
information inside the corporate firewall. (Ask your network administrator
for more info.)
If your network carrier supports it, you can even make calls over your net-
work carrier’s Wi-Fi hotspots (T-mobile hotspots), but that still costs you
minutes because you are making a regular phone call on your BlackBerry. 
What about making free calls over Skype or VoIP calls using your BlackBerry?
Well, at the time of writing, none of this is possible. But check our Web site,
www.blackberryfordummies.com, or ask us questions at www.Blackberry
goodies.com.
To turn on Wi-Fi capability:
1. From the Home screen, select the Manage Connection icon.
You see a popup screen listing various connections on your BlackBerry.
2. Highlight the Wi-Fi check box, and then press the trackball.
If the check box next to Wi-Fi is already checked, that means Wi-Fi 
capability is already turned on and you are ready to connect to available
Wi-Fi connections.
To get started with a Wi-Fi network, follow these steps:
1. From the Home screen, select the Set Up Wi-Fi icon.
You see a welcome screen, as shown in Figure 15-8.
2. Highlight the Next button and then press the trackball.
You then see a screen with three choices:
• Scan for Networks: Allows the BlackBerry to automatically scan
airwaves for available networks.
Figure 15-8:
Wi-Fi Setup
welcome
screen.
258
Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

• Manually Add Networks: Allows you to add your own networks.
Why would you choose this? Well, some secure networks do not
broadcast their name, so you won’t be able to scan for them. So, if
you know the name of a secure network, you can add it to your
BlackBerry using this choice.
• Get Security Key: Allows you to connect to a carrier-brand hotspot
by retrieving a password that allows you to connect.
3. Select Scan for Networks.
At this time, your BlackBerry scans and lists all available networks
around your current location. You can see the result in a list like the one
shown in Figure 15-9. The little lock represents a secured network.
4. Select a network to connect to. If you are connecting to a free Wi-Fi 
network, you are connected automatically. If you are connecting to a
secured network, enter a password at the prompt.
Success! You are now connected to a Wi-Fi network. 
When you connect to a Wi-Fi network successfully, you have the option to
name it what you like and save it, as shown in Figure 15-10 left. Why save?
The next time you are near the same Wi-Fi network, your BlackBerry can
automatically connect to the network without all the hassle of scanning the
network and entering a password.

Chapter 15: Wi-Fi and Using BlackBerry as a Laptop Modem

To save the connection, select Yes for Save this Wi-Fi Network as a Profile
field, and then select the Next button. 
The default name for any connection is the SSID name, but you can change it
to whatever you like.
You can now enjoy Wi-Fi on your BlackBerry. See Figure 15-10 right.
If you want to connect to a network manually, follow these steps:
1. From the Home screen, select the Set Up Wi-Fi icon.
You will see the welcome screen shown in Figure 15-8.
2. Highlight the Next button and then press the trackball.
You then see a screen with three choices described in the preceding list,
Scan for Networks, Manually Add Networks, and Get Security Key.
3. Select Manually Add Networks.
You are prompted for a network name.
4. Enter the name of the network you want to connect to and select Add.
You see another screen asking for the type of security the Wi-Fi network
is using, as shown in Figure 15-11. Check with the administrator of the
Wi-Fi network for more info. 
5. Select the wireless security protocol and then select Connect.
If all is well, you are now connected to a Wi-Fi network.
If you are really curious, SSID stands for Service Set Identifier. It is simply the
name that identifies a Wi-Fi network.

Part III: Getting Online and Multimedia with Your BlackBerry 

Tuning Your Wi-Fi Settings
If you have different Wi-Fi networks at different locations, you can prioritize
your Wi-Fi connection order. For example, if you have three Wi-Fi settings for
home, work, and them coffee shop, you can prioritize them according to how
often you are at each location. Why? This way, when you move about between
networks, your BlackBerry will pick up the proper Wi-Fi networks quickly.
To prioritize your Wi-Fi connections, follow these steps:
1. From the Home screen, select the Option (wretch) icon.
2. Select the Wi-Fi Connections option.
You see a screen similar to Figure 15-12.
3. Highlight a desired Wi-Fi network and then press the menu key.
4. Using the trackball, scroll the selected Wi-Fi network to the desired
order.
The topmost Wi-Fi network is the one that BlackBerry will try to connect
to first.
5. Press the menu key and select save.
As you can see in Figure 15-12, there is a field called Wi-Fi Selection Mode.
Other than prioritizing Wi-Fi networks, you can also choose to turn off auto
Wi-Fi selection. You can do this by selecting Manual for the Wi-Fi Selection
Mode field.

W
hat better way to keep your BlackBerry updated than to synchronize
it with your desktop application’s data? Arguably, most of the data
you need to synchronize is from your PIM (personal information manager)
applications. PIM info includes notes, appointments, addresses, and tasks.
The crucial piece for data synchronization to and from your device and 
desktop computer is Synchronize, a product of Puma Technologies that is
licensed by RIM to work inside BlackBerry Desktop Manager. This software
allows you to synchronize your PIM data as well as upload and download
media files between your PC and BlackBerry.
In this chapter, we introduce Synchronize. We show you how to manually and
automatically synchronize your BlackBerry with your desktop computer. We
also offer tips on which data synchronization options you might want to use.
Before we get into all that, however, we include a section on BlackBerry

Introduction to BlackBerry 
Desktop Manager
The centerpiece of the desktop activities that you can do with your BlackBerry
is BlackBerry Desktop Manager (BDM), which is a suite of programs that
include the following:
 Application Loader: Installs BlackBerry applications and updates the
BlackBerry OS.
 Backup and Restore: Backs up your BlackBerry data and settings. Check
out Chapter 19 for details.

 Synchronize: Synchronizes BlackBerry data to your PC (the topic of this
chapter).
 Media Manager: Uploads media files to your BlackBerry from your PC
and vice versa (another topic in this chapter).
BDM is the software included on the CD that comes with your handheld
device. Your BlackBerry’s packaging provides instructions on how to install
BDM on your desktop computer. For corporate users, check with your
BlackBerry system administrator for more details.
Launching BDM
In most Windows installations, you find the shortcut to launch BDM through
the Start menu of your computer; choose Start➪All Programs➪BlackBerry➪
Desktop Manager. Connect your BlackBerry to your desktop computer using
the USB cable that came with your device and launch BDM. The BDM opening
screen appears (see Figure 16-1).
Because BDM is a separate application, its installation might vary from phone
provider to provider. At the very least, you should see at least three icons, 
or applications: Application Loader (see Chapter 17), Backup and Restore
(Chapter 19), and Synchronize. Most phone providers don’t include
Redirector Settings unless your BlackBerry is connected to BlackBerry
Enterprise Server (BES). The Redirector Settings application works only for
devices that run under BES.
Connecting BDM to your BlackBerry
You establish a connection between your BlackBerry and BDM through the
USB cable that comes with your device. Plug in your device to your desktop.
After BDM is running, it will try to find a BlackBerry on the type of connec-
tion specified. The default connection is USB, so you shouldn’t need to con-
figure anything.
Figure 16-1:
BlackBerry
Desktop
Manager.
266
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

If your device has a password, BDM prompts for the password. Enter the
password, and then you should see Connected as the screen heading. If for
some reason you see Disconnected and no password prompt, either BDM
can’t find the device being connected via the USB cable or the connection
setting is not set to use USB.
To make sure that the connection setting uses USB, choose Options➪
Connection Settings at the top of the BDM screen. The screen shown in
Figure 16-2 appears. In the Connection drop-down list, select the USB connec-
tion having the PIN of your BlackBerry.
Running BDM for the first time
If you’re running BDM for the first time, the process can take a while. BDM
tries to make the initial configuration on your machine, including finding 
the default e-mail client and the e-mail account that it will assign for the
Intellisync software. It asks you to confirm the e-mail account during this
time. If you have multiple e-mail accounts set up on your desktop computer,
be sure to select the one you want your BlackBerry to use.
BDM also checks what applications you have on your device and what
required applications need to be installed. If it cannot find a required applica-
tion on your device, it prompts you to install it. Of course, you have the
option to cancel and install later.
After checking for applications, BDM looks at the settings you have for your
Intellisync software. If auto-synchronization is turned on, BDM attempts to
run synchronization for your PIM. This is discussed later, in the “Automatic
synchronization” section.

Chapter 16: Synching the Synchronize Way

Setting Up Synchronize
Synchronize is the part of BDM that allows you to synchronize your data
between your desktop computer and your BlackBerry. Synchronize is one of
the icons on the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen. To launch Synchronize,
simply double-click the Synchronize icon. A screen like the one shown in
Figure 16-3 appears.
The Synchronize screen is divided into two tabs: Synchronize (see Figure 16-3)
and Configuration (see Figure 16-4). The Synchronize tab allows you to manu-
ally trigger synchronization, and the Configuration tab is where you can set up
configuration and rules for reconciling data. The first thing you need to figure
out is the Configuration tab.
Configuring PIM synchronization
One important item in the Configuration section of Figure 16-4 is the
Configure Synch button, which you use to configure PIM (personal informa-
tion manager) synchronization. PIM info includes notes, appointments,
addresses, and tasks. Clicking the Configure Synch button displays the 
screen shown in Figure 16-5.
This screen is the entry point of the entire synchronization configuration for
applications that are part of PIM. As you can see in this screen, the PIM hand-
held application is paired with a desktop application; Outlook in this example.
Figure 16-3:
The
Synchronize
screen.
268
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

If you’re curious as to what other applications the PIM Configuration option
supports, click the Choose button to see a screen similar to Figure 16-6,
which lists other possible applications. The list depends on the context of
the highlighted PIM application. These other desktop applications are also
popular; you’re probably currently using one of them. Isn’t it nice to know
that you don’t have to dump the application you’re already familiar with?
Mapping fields for synchronization
For all four PIM applications, Synchronize knows which fields from the desk-
top applications map to your device application fields. But not all fields
found on the desktop side exist on the handheld (and vice versa). For exam-
ple, in the BlackBerry Address Book application, a Nick Name field doesn’t

tion screen.

Chapter 16: Synching the Synchronize Way

exist but is available on Exchange (Outlook) Address Book. In some
instances, Intellisync provides you with an alternate field and gives you a
choice to map or not. So, if you ever find the need to change the default map-
ping, you have the facility to do so. The interface is the same for all PIM appli-
cations. To illustrate how to map and un-map fields, we use Address Book.
The following steps lead you to the screen that allows you to map the fields
for Address Book:
1. From BDM, double-click Synchronize.
2. Click the Configuration tab.
The PIM Configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 16-5). At this
point, Address Book is highlighted, so the next step is based on the
Address Book application. If you want to go to the Confirmation tab of a
PIM application other than Address Book, you have to click that applica-
tion from the list at this point.
3. Click the Configure button, which is in the lower-right corner.
4. From the drop-down list that appears, choose Advanced Settings.
The screen shown in Figure 16-7 appears.
5. Click the Field Mapping button.
If you’re not careful, you can inadvertently unclick Job Title mapping, and
suddenly titles are no longer in sync. The Synchronize application recog-
nizes this risk and gives you a warning screen, as shown in Figure 16-8. If
you think you made a mistake, you can cancel from this point to save
yourself from having to do a lot of extra work to restore settings.

6. To proceed, click OK.
The Field Mapping screen for the Address Book application appears (see
Figure 16-9). To map or un-map, click the arrows.
7. Click OK to save your changes.

Chapter 16: Synching the Synchronize Way

Confirming record changes
Face facts: Doing a desktop synchronization is not a very interesting task,
and few people perform it on a regular basis. If you’re one of those folks, you
won’t have any clue as to what changes to expect on either side. Well, not to
worry. You can tell Synchronize to prompt you for any changes it’s trying to
do or perhaps undo on either side of the wire. This is where the Confirmation
tab of the Advanced Settings screen comes in. To get to this view, follow
these steps:
1. From BDM, double-click Synchronize.
2. From the Synchronize screen that appears, click the Configuration tab.
The PIM configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 16-5). Notice the
Configure button in the lower-right corner. At this point, Address Book is
highlighted. So, the next step is based on the Address Book application.
If you want to go to the Confirmation tab of a PIM application other than
Address Book, click that application from the list.
3. Click the Configure button and then choose Advanced Settings from
the drop-down list that follows.
The Advanced Settings for Address Book screen appears (refer to 
Figure 16-7). 
4. If the Confirmation tab is not active, click it.
The Confirmation tab comes into view (refer to Figure 16-7). This screen
gives you two options:
• Display a prompt screen to confirm deletions.
• Display a prompt screen to confirm updates and additions.
Regardless of whether you select the first option, Synchronize displays a
prompt to confirm the deletion of all records.
Resolving update conflicts
If you don’t synchronize your device frequently, you will get into a situation
where you must make an update to a particular record on your BlackBerry as
well as on your desktop application. Synchronize needs to know how you
want this handled. The interface to define how to resolve these conflicts is
the same for all PIM applications. Again, for illustration, we use Address Book
as an example:
272
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

1. From BDM, double-click Synchronize.
2. From the Synchronize screen that appears, click the Configuration tab.
The PIM configuration screen appears (refer to Figure 16-5). Address
Book is highlighted, so the next step is based on the Address Book appli-
cation. If you want to go to the Confirmation tab of a PIM application
other than Address Book, click that application from the list.
3. Click the Configure button; from the drop-down list that appears,
choose Advanced Settings.
The Advanced Settings for Address Book screen appears (refer to 
Figure 16-7). Note that this screen has three tabs, and the second tab 
is titled Conflict Resolution.
4. Click the Conflict Resolution tab.
The Conflict Resolution tab comes into view, as shown in Figure 16-10.
You can tell Synchronize to handle conflicts in a few ways. Here are the
options shown in the Address Book Advanced Settings screen:
• Add All Conflicting Items: Tells Synchronize that when a conflict
happens, a new record should be added to the BlackBerry for the
changes on the desktop, and a new record should be added to the
desktop side for the changes on the BlackBerry.
• Ignore All Conflicting Items: Just ignores the fact that there has been
a change to the record and keeps the data the same on both sides.
• Notify Me When Conflicts Occur: This is the safest option. Synchronize
displays a message screen with the details of the record that has a
conflict and gives you the ability to resolve the conflict.
Figure 16-10:
Manage
conflicts
here.
273
Chapter 16: Synching the Synchronize Way

• Handheld Wins: Unless you are sure that this is the case, you
shouldn’t choose this option. It basically tells Synchronize to disre-
gard the changes in the desktop application and use handheld
changes every time it encounters a conflict.
• MS Outlook Wins: If you’re not using MS Outlook, this option is
worded based on the application you’re using. This option is oppo-
site to the Handheld Wins option in that it tells Synchronize to
always discard changes on the handheld and use the desktop
application change whenever it encounters a conflict. Again, we
don’t recommend this option because there’s no telling on which
side you made the good update.
5. Click the option you want and then click OK to save the settings.
Ready, Set, Synchronize!
Are you ready to synchronize? Earlier in this chapter, we show you how to
define synchronization filters and rules for your e-mail and PIM data. Now it’s
time to be brave and push the button. Your two choices are manually (by
using the Synchronize Now button) or automatically.
Synchronize Now
Synchronize Now is a feature of Synchronize that enables you to run synchro-
nization manually. The basic rundown is that you choose the data you want
to synchronize, click the Synchronize Now button, and that’s it. Without
delay, here are the steps:
1. From BDM, double-click Synchronize.
The Synchronize screen appears (refer to Figure 16-3). The four check
boxes in the Synchronize area give you the option to selectively syn-
chronize your data. You can choose from e-mail, PIM, add-in, and date
and time.
2. Check the check boxes of the data that you want to synchronize and
then click the Synchronize Now button.
Synchronize starts running the synchronization; you see a progress
screen. If you set up rules to prompt for conflicts and if Synchronize
encounters one, you see a screen to resolve it. After synchronization is
finished, the progress screen disappears and the Synchronize screen
reappears.
274
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

If you have automatic synchronization turned on (see the next section),
the items you check here are automatically synched every time you con-
nect your BlackBerry to your PC.
3. Close Synchronize by clicking the Close button.
Automatic synchronization
How many times do you think you reconfigure your Synchronize setup?
Rarely, right? After you have it configured, that’s it. And if you’re like us, the
reason you open BlackBerry Desktop Manager is because you want to run
Synchronize. So, opening Synchronize and clicking the Synchronize Now
button is somewhat annoying. In this case, if you’d like to make Synchronize
run automatically every time you connect your BlackBerry to your PC, simply
make sure the very last check box in Figure 16-3 — Synchronize the items
selected above automatically — is checked. You might be asking what items
will auto-synchronization synch? Good question. It will auto-sync the items
you’ve checked in the top portion of Figure 16-3. Simple.

Installing Applications
In This Chapter
 Getting started with Application Loader
 Installing a BlackBerry application
 Uninstalling an application
 Upgrading your operating system
T
oward the end of this book, we point out a few great applications that
make your BlackBerry that much more productive as well as a few games
that make your BlackBerry more entertaining than ever. Rest assured,
though, that installing an application on your BlackBerry is a snap.
Think of your BlackBerry as a minilaptop where you can run preinstalled
applications as well as install new applications. You can even upgrade your
BlackBerry’s OS. (Yup, that’s right, your BlackBerry even has an operating
system.)
We start this chapter by introducing Application Loader, which allows you to
load applications onto your BlackBerry — hence its name. Then we show you
how to both install and uninstall an application from your BlackBerry. Finally,
we show you how to use Application Loader to upgrade your OS.
If you got your BlackBerry from your company, they might impose guidelines
on what applications (if any) can and cannot be installed and uninstalled
from your device. Be sure to familiarize yourself with your IT department’s
policy before attempting to install or uninstall software from a company-
owned BlackBerry.
Accessing Application Loader
In this chapter, as with other chapters in Part IV, you work closely with your
PC and your BlackBerry. On your PC, you use an application called BlackBerry
Desktop Manager (BDM), which comes on a CD along with your BlackBerry.
For an introduction to BlackBerry Desktop Manager, see Chapter 16.
Application Loader is a miniapplication within BlackBerry Desktop Manager.

After BlackBerry Desktop Manager is installed on your PC, do the following to
access Application Loader:
1. On your PC, select Start➪Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
BlackBerry Desktop Manager opens.
2. Connect your BlackBerry to your PC via your USB cable.
Doing so connects your BlackBerry to your PC. If successful, you see the
password dialog box shown in Figure 17-1. If not, check to see whether the
USB cable is connected properly to both your PC and your BlackBerry and
then try again. If all else fails, contact your service provider. Or contact
your system administrator if you are an enterprise user.
3. Enter your password.
This completes your BlackBerry-to-PC connection.
4. On your PC, double-click the Application Loader icon in BlackBerry
Desktop Manager.
The Application Loader Wizard welcome screen opens (see Figure 17-2).
At this point, you are ready to use the functions of Application Loader.

278
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

Installing an Application
To install an application onto your BlackBerry from your PC by using
Application Loader, you first have to install that application on your PC. The
installation onto your PC varies, depending on which application you choose
to install, so be sure to refer to the manual that comes with the application
you choose.
After you get the application onto your PC, you need to locate the applica-
tion’s ALX file (a file with the .alx extension). The ALX file isn’t the file that
gets installed on your BlackBerry; rather, it tells Application Loader where
the actual application file is located on your PC. You can usually find an appli-
cation’s ALX file in the folder where you installed the application on your PC.
In this chapter, we use BlackChat as a sample application to install on your
BlackBerry. BlackChat is a free ICQ messaging application that connects to
the Web directly and does not use SMS. You can download this application at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/blackchat/.
The steps for installing an application are the same, so you can use the fol-
lowing steps as a guide to installing the application of your choice.
After you download the application (in our case, BlackChat) on your PC, you
can install it on your BlackBerry by using Application Loader as follows:
1. Launch Application Loader from BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
The Application Loader Wizard welcome screen appears. (Refer to
Figure 17-2.)
2. Click the Next button.
The screen shown in Figure 17-3 appears.
Figure 17-3:
Enter your
password.
279
Chapter 17: Installing Applications

3. Enter your password, and then click Next.
If your handheld isn’t connected properly, you see the Communication
Port Selection screen (Figure 17-4). Connect your BlackBerry to the USB
cable and make sure that the USB cable is connected to the PC. Then
click Next.
The Handheld Application Selection screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 17-5. This screen lists the applications that are already installed
on your BlackBerry.

280
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

4. Click the Add button.
An Open file dialog box appear, which you use to locate the ALX file of
the application you want to install.
5. Locate the ALX file and then click Open.
You return to the Handheld Application Selection, where you can see
BlackChat as one of the applications in the list, as shown in Figure 17-6.
6. Click Next.
Doing so brings up the confirmation screen, listing the application to be
installed.
7. Click Finish.
The installation process starts, and a progress window appears. When
the progress window disappears — and if all went well — the applica-
tion is on your BlackBerry.
Encountering an invalid signature error
If you encounter an invalid signature error when installing an application (see
Figure 17-7) and your employer gave your BlackBerry to you, you do not have
permission to install applications on your BlackBerry. Permissions on your
BlackBerry are controlled by IT policy and the software configuration
assigned to your device through the BlackBerry Enterprise Server.
Using alternatives to Application Loader
Although this chapter covers installing an application by using Application
Loader through your PC, another way to install applications is wirelessly
through an OTA (over the air) download. See Chapter 10 for more on wireless
installations.
Figure 17-6:
We found
the ALX file.
281
Chapter 17: Installing Applications

Another way for an application to be installed on your BlackBerry is through
a BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) wireless install. In this case, you have
no control over the installation process. Your company’s BlackBerry system
administrator controls which applications are and are not on your
BlackBerry.
Uninstalling an Application
You can uninstall an application in two ways: using Application Loader or
using your BlackBerry handheld.
As in the preceding section on installing, we use BlackChat as an example and
assume that you already installed the BlackChat application. Of course, you
can follow the same steps for uninstalling other applications.
Uninstalling by using Application Loader
The steps to uninstalling a BlackBerry application are similar to the steps for
installing:
1. On your PC, launch Application Loader and then click Next.
2. Enter your password (refer to Figure 17-3).
If your handheld isn’t connected properly, you see the Communication
Port Selection screen (refer to Figure 17-4). Connect your BlackBerry to
the USB cable and connect the USB cable to the PC.
Figure 17-7:
The invalid
signature
error.
282
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

After entering your password, you see the Handheld Application
Selection screen, which lists the applications on your BlackBerry. 
(Refer to Figure 17-5.)
3. Use the mouse to scroll to the application you want to delete
(BlackChat, in this example) and clear its check box.
Notice that the Action column for BlackChat is Remove, as shown in
Figure 17-8.
4. Click Next.
A confirmation screen appears, confirming that Application Loader will
uninstall what you selected.
5. Click Finish.
The uninstall process starts, and a progress window appears. When the
progress window disappears, you have uninstalled the application from
your BlackBerry.
Uninstalling by using your 
BlackBerry handheld
When you’re on the run and don’t have access to your PC, you can still unin-
stall an application from your BlackBerry handheld.
Figure 17-8:

283
Chapter 17: Installing Applications

Follow these steps to uninstall BlackChat (or an application of your choice)
from your BlackBerry handheld:
1. Select the options (wrench) icon from the BlackBerry Home screen.
Doing so opens the Options application.
2. Select Advanced Options, and then select Applications.
You see a list of applications installed on your BlackBerry, as shown in
Figure 17-9.
3. Scroll to the application you want to delete (BlackChat, in this exam-
ple) and then press the trackball.
4. Scroll to Delete on the menu that appears (see Figure 17-10), and press
the trackball again.
A confirmation dialog box appears.
5. Select Delete to confirm the deletion.
You are given a choice to restart now or at a later time. After restarting,
the deleted application is uninstalled.

Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

Upgrading Your BlackBerry OS
The latest BlackBerry OS update comes from software called BlackBerry
Handheld Software, which is available from your network service provider or
your BlackBerry system administrator. The handheld software may differ
from provider to provider, so it’s important that you get it from the service
provider’s Web site. We compiled a location of the download pages for differ-
ent service providers at www.blackberryfordummies.com/bhs.html.
In this section, we assume that the latest BlackBerry Handheld Software 
for your BlackBerry model is already installed on your PC. For help with
installing BlackBerry Handheld Software, refer to the instructions that come
with it.
Although this section is about upgrading your BlackBerry OS, we want to first
let you know that you should upgrade your BlackBerry OS only when you
have to or are told to by your network service provider or your corporate
BlackBerry system administrator. We (slightly) discourage you from upgrad-
ing your BlackBerry OS because we believe that when it comes to BlackBerry
OS, why ruin a good thing? Only when the good thing turns bad or a better
thing comes along should you attempt to upgrade your OS.
Don’t get us wrong: The folks at RIM have made upgrading your OS as simple
as can be. But like upgrading the OS on any other computing device (includ-
ing your PC), the risk of losing data is always there — as well as the risk that
things that won’t work as well as before.
To address the risk of information loss, RIM designed Application Loader to
automatically back up for you as part of the OS upgrade. However, our expe-
rience has taught us to perform a full backup manually as an extra precau-
tion. There have been times where the backup by Application Loader didn’t
achieve a full backup; see Chapter 19 for more on backing up data manually.
Now that we’re finished with our disclaimer, it’s upgrade time!
After you finish a manual backup of your BlackBerry, you can start the
upgrade process by doing the following:
1. After entering your BlackBerry password into BlackBerry Desktop
Manager on your PC, double-click Application Loader on the Desktop
Manager screen.
Doing so opens the Application Loader Wizard welcome screen (refer to
Figure 17-2).
285
Chapter 17: Installing Applications

2. Click the Next button.
A list of software appears, as shown in Figure 17-11.
3. Using your mouse, you can opt out of the OS upgrade by unchecking
the OS portion (BlackBerry 4.1 System Software in Figure 17-11),
which is listed in the top portion of the screen.
The OS is listed only if you need an update — it means that your
BlackBerry OS is out of date. If the OS doesn’t appear in the list, the
handheld software you installed on the desktop machine is the same as
the one installed on your device, or a prior version compared to the one
installed on your device.
4. Click the Next button.
The Application Device Backup screen appears, as shown in Figure 17-12.
This is where you decide whether you want to back up your BlackBerry
content before upgrading your OS.
We recommend that you do select the Automatically Backup option even
if you already backed up your BlackBerry information manually.
5. Select the top radio button to run an automatic backup, and then 
click Next.
A summary page appears to confirm your actions. See Figure 17-13.
6. Click the Finish button.
The BlackBerry OS upgrade starts, complete with a progress window
showing a series of steps and a progress bar. The entire process takes
ten minutes or more, depending on your BlackBerry model and the OS
version you are upgrading to.
Figure 17-11:

Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

At times during the BlackBerry OS upgrade, your BlackBerry display will
go on and off. Don’t worry; this is normal.
When the progress window disappears, the OS upgrade is complete.
Perform a full manual backup yourself before attempting to upgrade your
BlackBerry OS.

W
ouldn’t it be nice if you could just tell one device to make its data
available to another? That’s the future. But right now, RIM wants your
experience of switching devices as painless to be as possible. That’s why
they’ve added an application called Switch Device Wizard to the suite of
applications in BlackBerry Desktop Manager.
This chapter makes it easier for you to switch your device and will give you
the scoop on using Switch Device Wizard.
Most companies don’t want their employees running Switch Device Wizard,
especially when they have BlackBerry Enterprise Server taking care of synch-
ing data from an older BlackBerry. So, if you are holding a company-owned
BlackBerry, it’s likely that you won’t find Switch Device Wizard on your instal-
lation of BlackBerry Desktop Manager. In that case, you can skip this chapter.
Switching between BlackBerries
Switching from a BlackBerry to a BlackBerry is no big deal. Let’s say you just
got a new BlackBerry and want to jump-start it with the programs and data
you have on your older BlackBerry. Basically, you just back up your old
BlackBerry and then load that backup to your new device. If you’ve done a
backup and restore, the following steps should be familiar, only this time you
do it through Switch Device Wizard:
1. On your PC, choose Start➪Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
This takes you to the Desktop Manager screen, where you can find
Switch Device Wizard, as shown in Figure 18-1.

290
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
2. From the Desktop Manager screen, double-click the Switch Device
Wizard icon.
The Switch Device Wizard screen appears, displaying an option for you
to choose whether to switch from BlackBerry to BlackBerry or from non-
BlackBerry to BlackBerry. In this case, you are interested in BlackBerry
to BlackBerry.
3. Click the image next to Switch BlackBerry devices.
A screen appears, telling you to connect your current (old) BlackBerry
to your PC.
4. Connect your old BlackBerry to your PC with the USB cable, and then
click the Next button.
The next screen lets you verify that your old BlackBerry is connected
properly, as you can see in Figure 18-2. The Connection setting on this
screen should display the PIN of your old BlackBerry.
5. Click the Next button.
6. Decide whether to include user data and third-party applications.
If you want all the data, leave the screen untouched, because this will
back up everything. Third-party applications are all the programs you
installed (that is, the ones that did not come with the device originally).
7. Click the Next button.
A status screen appears, showing the progress of the backup operation.
When the backup is finished, the next screen instructs you to connect
your new BlackBerry.
8. Connect your new BlackBerry and then click the Next button.
The next screen, which is similar to Figure 18-2, lets you verify that your
new BlackBerry is connected properly. The Connection setting on this
screen should display the PIN of your new BlackBerry.
Figure 18-1:

here.

9. Click the Next button.
This takes you to a screen similar to Figure 18-4, which tells you what will
be restored to the new device. Nothing has been done to your new device
yet, and this is the last opportunity for you to cancel the operation.

Chapter 18: Switching Devices

Switching from a Non-BlackBerry Device
Switch Device Wizard supports two types of non-BlackBerry devices: Palm
and Microsoft Windows Mobile. This doesn’t mean that you won’t be able to
import your old data if you have another device. The Switch Device Wizard
just makes it simpler for these two types of devices. You may want to check
Chapter 16 for synchronization options to your Desktop PIM application if
your old device is neither Palm nor Microsoft Windows Mobile.
Palm device requirements
For Switch Device Wizard to port data from Palm to BlackBerry, there are
three prerequisites:
 Your PC must be running Windows 2000 or later.
 Palm Desktop software version 4.0.1, 4.1, 4.1.4, or 6.0.1 must be installed
on the desktop.
 The Wizard uses the Palm Desktop software, so make sure that it is still
synchronizing properly with the Palm device.
Windows Mobile device requirements
The following list gives a rundown of the things you need for the Wizard to
work properly with a Windows Mobile device:
Figure 18-4:

292
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

 Your PC must be running Windows 2000 or later.
 Microsoft ActiveSync version 4.0.1, 4.1, 4.1.4, or 6.0.1 must be installed
on your PC.
 The Mobile device should be running one of the following operating sys-
tems: Microsoft Windows Mobile 2000, 2002, 2003, 2003SE, or 2005/5.0
for Pocket PC or Microsoft Windows Mobile SmartPhone software 2002,
2003, or 2003 SE.
Running the Wizard
Before you run the Wizard, make sure that all the requirements for your
device are in place. We also recommend that you hot-sync your Palm or
Windows Mobile device to make sure that the data you’re porting to your
BlackBerry is current.
Although the following steps migrate Palm data into the BlackBerry, the steps
are similar for Windows Mobile as well. We indicate at what point the steps
vary. Do the following to get your other device’s data migrated over to your
new BlackBerry:
1. Connect both the Palm device and the BlackBerry to your desktop
computer.
2. On your PC, choose Start➪Programs➪BlackBerry➪Desktop Manager.
The Desktop Manager screen appears (refer to Figure 18-1).
3. Double-click the Switch Device Wizard icon.
The Switch Device Wizard screen appears.
4. Click the image next to Switch from Another Device to BlackBerry
Device.
The welcome screen appears, shown in Figure 18-5, describing what the
tool is capable of doing.
Figure 18-5:

data from a
non-
BlackBerry
device.
293
Chapter 18: Switching Devices

5. Click the Next button.
This will take you to the screen where you choose whether you are
migrating from Palm or Windows Mobile, as shown in Figure 18-6. Note
that the Wizard is intelligent enough to enable the option associated to
the connected device, which in this case is the Palm device.
6. Click the Next button.
A message screen appears, shown in Figure 18-7, reminding you that the
process will try to hot-sync Palm. This shouldn’t do anything if you
already performed a hot-sync before running the Wizard.
7. Click the OK button.
A progress screen appears. Before the data is applied to your new
BlackBerry, the Wizard lets you confirm it. An example for Address Book
entries is shown in Figure 18-8. You may click the Details button if you
want to know the records that the Wizard is trying to apply. Or if you
just want the data migrated, click the Accept button.

Protecting Your Information
In This Chapter
 Performing a full backup of your BlackBerry information
 Scheduling automatic backups
 Restoring from backups
 Selectively backing up information
I
magine that you left your BlackBerry in the back of a cab or on the train.
You’ve lost your BlackBerry for good. Okay, not good. So what happens to
all your information? Have you lost it forever? What about information secu-
rity? Can anyone have unauthorized access to your personal information?
One thing that you don’t need to worry about is information security —
assuming that you set up a security password on your BlackBerry. With secu-
rity password protection, anyone who finds your BlackBerry has only ten
chances to enter the correct password; after those ten chances are up, it’s
self-destruction time. Although it’s not as smoky and dramatic as what you
see on Mission Impossible, your BlackBerry does erase all of its information in
such a scenario, thwarting your would-be data thief. Therefore, set up a pass-
word for your BlackBerry! For information on how to do so, refer to Chapter 3.
What you do need to worry about is how to get back all your information on
your BlackBerry. If you’re like us and you store important information on your
BlackBerry, this chapter is for you. Vital information such as clients’ and friends’
contact information, notes from phone calls with clients — and, of course, those
precious e-mail messages — should not be taken lightly. Backing up this infor-
mation is a reliable way to protect it from being lost forever.
In this chapter, we show you how you can prevent losing information on your
BlackBerry by backing it up on your PC. Then we show you how to restore
and recover the information you’ve backed up.

298
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 
Accessing Backup and Restore
Backup and Restore is a mini-application within BlackBerry Desktop Manager
(BDM). For instructions on installing BDM, see Chapter 17. After BlackBerry
Desktop Manager is installed on your PC, you can connect your BlackBerry to
your PC by using the USB cable that came with your BlackBerry. If everything
is set up properly, you see a pop-up window on your PC prompting you to
type your BlackBerry security password. After you enter your correct pass-
word, the BlackBerry is connected to the PC.
To access Backup and Restore, double-click the Backup and Restore icon on
the BlackBerry Desktop Manager screen on your PC. Doing so opens the
Backup and Restore screen (see Figure 19-1). At this point, you’re ready to
back up or restore information from or to your BlackBerry.
Backing Up BlackBerry Style
We all know that backing up your data provides tremendous peace of mind.
So do the folks at RIM, which is why they made backing up your information
quite easy. Your BlackBerry can be backed up manually or by autopilot.
Backing up your BlackBerry manually
To back up your BlackBerry manually, follow these steps:
1. From the BDM screen, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
The Backup and Restore screen appears (refer to Figure 19-1).
Figure 19-1:
The Backup
and Restore
screen.

2. Click the Backup button.
The dialog box shown in Figure 19-2 appears so that you can name the
backup file and determine where you want it saved on your PC.
3. Name your backup file and choose a place to save it.
4. Select Save.
BlackBerry Desktop Manager automatically starts backing up your
BlackBerry information onto your PC. You can follow the backup progress
in the Transfer in Progress window that appears (see Figure 19-3).
Figure 19-3:
A backup is
in progress.
Figure 19-2:
Set where
to save your
backup file.
299
Chapter 19: Protecting Your Information 

Do not unplug your BlackBerry from the PC until the backup process fin-
ishes! Depending on how much information you have on your
BlackBerry, the backup might take five to ten minutes to finish.
5. When the Transfer in Progress window disappears, you are finished
with the BlackBerry backup process and may unplug the device from
the PC.
Setting up automatic backups
What is better than backing up your information once? Remembering to back
up regularly! What’s better than regularly backing up? You guessed it —
having your PC and BlackBerry run backups automatically. After you sched-
ule automated backups of your BlackBerry, you can really have peace of mind
when it comes to preventing information loss.
To set up an autobackup:
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
The Backup and Restore screen appears.
2. Click the Options button.
The Backup and Restore Options screen appears, shown in Figure 19-4,
where you can schedule automatic backups.
3. Select the Automatically Backup My Handheld Every option.
This enables you to configure more options (check boxes and options
become active), such as how often Desktop Manager should back up
your BlackBerry.
Figure 19-4:
Set
autobackups
here.
300
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

4. In the numeric Days field, select a number of days between 1 and 99.
This interval sets how often your BlackBerry will be backed up. For exam-
ple, if you enter 14 days, your BlackBerry is be backed up every 14 days.
5. Select the Backup All Handheld Application Data option.
This backs up all the data on your BlackBerry each time autobackup
runs.
Although you have the option to exclude e-mail messages and information,
such as from Address Book, to-do’s, and memos, we recommend that you
back up everything each time without any exclusion.
6. Confirm your settings by clicking OK.
Now you can go on with your life without caring too much about backing
up information on your BlackBerry.
To run a backup, you need to connect your BlackBerry to your PC. Thus, if
you travel often or just don’t link your BlackBerry to your PC often, make
sure you plug your BlackBerry into your PC once in a while so autobackup
has a chance to back up your information.
A Full Restore from Backup Information
We hope that you never have to read this section more than once because
every time you perform a full restore from a backup, it probably means
you’ve lost information that you had hoped to find from the backup you cre-
ated on your PC.
The steps to fully restoring your backup information are simple:
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
The Backup and Restore screen appears.
2. Click the Restore button.
Doing so brings up a typical Open file dialog box, asking you where the
backup file is located on your PC.
3. Choose a backup file and then click Open.
A Warning window appears (see Figure 19-5), alerting you that you’re
about to overwrite existing information.
301
Chapter 19: Protecting Your Information 

4. From this Warning window, click OK to proceed with the full restore.
A progress bar similar to the one in Figure 19-3 appears, showing the
progress of the full restore.
It might take a while for the full restore to finish. Do not unplug your
BlackBerry from your PC during this time!
5. When the progress bar disappears, you’re finished with the restore
process and may unplug the device from the PC.
Protecting Your Data, Your Way
A certain burger joint and BlackBerry have in common that you can have it
your way with their products. Just like you can get your burger with or with-
out all the extras (such as pickles and onions), you can choose to not back
up and restore things that you know you won’t need.
For example, say you’ve accidentally deleted all your Browser bookmarks
and now you want them back. The thing not to do is to restore all the infor-
mation from your last backup, which could potentially be more than 90 days
old (depending on how often your autobackup runs, if it does). Doing so
might overwrite other information, such as e-mail or your Address Book con-
tacts. The easiest thing to do is to use the selective backup and restore func-
tion in BlackBerry Desktop Manager and restore only Browser bookmarks.
Figure 19-5:
Be careful
when
overwriting
existing info.
302
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

The same idea goes with backing up. If you are a big e-mail user and your
mailbox is constantly growing, you can choose to back up just your e-mails
and nothing else.
In this section, we use the term databases. Don’t worry; this isn’t as technical
as you think. Think of a database as an information category on the
BlackBerry. For example, saying, “backing up your Browser bookmarks data-
base” is just a fancy way of saying, “backing up all your Browser bookmarks
on your BlackBerry.”
We start with a selective backup and then describe a selective restore.
Backing up, your way
To show you how to perform selective backups, we back up just e-mails and
Browser bookmarks. To back up selectively, follow these steps:
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
The Backup and Restore screen appears.
2. Click the Advanced button.
The advanced Backup/Restore screen appears, as shown in Figure 19-6.
On the right side of the screen are the different information categories,
or databases, of your BlackBerry.
Figure 19-6:
The
advanced
Backup/
Restore
screen.
303
Chapter 19: Protecting Your Information 

3. In the left list, Ctrl+click Browser Bookmarks and Browser Messages
as the databases you want to back up. Then click the left-facing arrow
(the backup arrow).
A progress bar moves while your BlackBerry is backed up selectively.
This step merely transfers the databases onto your PC; it does not save
them. When the backup transfer is finished, you can see the two data-
bases on the left side of the window.
4. Choose File➪Save As.
5. Name your file and specify where you want to save it on your PC.
You still need to manually save the backup file on your PC even after you
choose a location for the file in Step 3. A selective backup does not automati-
cally save your backup on your PC.
Restoring, your way
Selective restoring works in a similar way to a selective backup. However,
when restoring, you need to already have a backup file to restore from.
Although this might sound obvious to you, the point we are making is that
you can selectively restore from any backup, auto or manual. For example,
say you have autobackup running every other day, and you want to restore
only your e-mail messages from two days ago. You don’t need to do a full
restore because that might overwrite some of the new contacts in your
Address Book. Rather, you can use the selective restore method and get back
only your e-mail messages.
To restore your way, follow these steps:
1. From the BDM, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
The Backup and Restore screen appears.
2. Click the Advanced button.
The advanced Backup/Restore screen appears (refer to Figure 19-6). The
right side of the screen displays your BlackBerry’s different information
categories, or databases.
3. Choose File➪Open.
This opens an window where you can choose which backup file you
want to restore from.
A BlackBerry backup file has an .ipd suffix.
4. Select a backup file and then click the Open button.
The different information categories, or databases, appear on the left
side of the screen. You are now ready for a selective restore.
304
Part IV: Working with Desktop Manager 

5. Select the categories, or databases, of your choice. 
You can select multiple databases by Ctrl+clicking the databases you
want.
6. Click the right-facing arrow (the Restore arrow).
You will likely see a Warning window asking whether you want to replace
all the information with the data you are restoring (refer to Figure 19-5).
If your BlackBerry has the same categories as the ones you are restoring
(which is likely), you will overwrite any information you have on your
BlackBerry.
You can confidently click OK if you know that the database you’re restor-
ing has the information you’re looking for.
7. From the Warning window, click OK.
A progress bar similar to the one in Figure 19-3 appears while the selec-
tive restore is in progress. When the progress bar window disappears,
the information categories that you’ve selected are restored on your
BlackBerry.
Clearing BlackBerry information, 
your way
You can also selectively clear, or delete, information on your BlackBerry from
BlackBerry Desktop Manager. And when would you use selective deletion?
Suppose you want to clear only your phone logs from your BlackBerry. One
way is to tediously select one phone log at a time and press Delete, and then
repeat that until all phone logs are deleted. However, a faster way is to use
selective deleting. The idea is to delete a database from the advanced
Backup/Restore screen by using the Backup and Restore function.
305
Chapter 19: Protecting Your Information 
Perusing backup BlackBerry files
Whether you use the one-button-push backup
method or you manually back up your file, the
file is saved on your PC as an .ipd file. For
those curious readers out there, you might be
asking, “Can I read these backup files without a
BlackBerry?” The answer is yes! With a third-
party product called ABC Amber BlackBerry
Converter, you can view any .ipd file. You
might be asking, “What is the purpose?” Well,
if you somehow lost your BlackBerry but need
to read an old e-mail or get contacts out of your
backup files, this tools allows you to convert
anything in your backup file (e-mails, SMS mes-
sages, PIM messages, and contacts) into PDF
or Word documents. For more information and
to try out ABC Amber BlackBerry Converter for
free, go to www.processtext.com/abc
blackberry.html.

To selectively delete databases on your BlackBerry, follow these steps:
1. From BDM on your PC, double-click the Backup and Restore icon.
The Backup and Restore screen appears.
2. Click the Advanced button.
The advanced Backup/Restore screen appears (refer to Figure 19-6). The
right side of the screen displays your BlackBerry’s different information
categories, or databases.
3. Ctrl+click the database(s) you want to delete.
This highlights the database(s).
4. Click the Clear button on the right side of the screen.
A Warning window appears, asking you to confirm your deletion.
5. Click OK.
A progress bar appears, showing the progress of the deletion. When the
progress bar disappears, the information categories you selected are
cleared from your BlackBerry.

 Belt clip
 Screen protector
 Extra battery
 Charger
 Bluetooth hands-free headset
 Full keyboard
 External speakerphone
 Car mount
T
he BlackBerry retail box contains a few essentials: a battery, a charger,
and a belt clip. If you’re like us, though, you’re not satisfied with what is
included in the box. In this chapter, we present the accessories that we think
supplement your BlackBerry well — and also where to shop for them. Please
check our companion Web site, www.blackberryfordummies.com, for an
updated list.
A microSD Card
Your new BlackBerry normally doesn’t come with external memory, or a
microSD card. And we bet that is the first thing you’ll be looking for after you
get your BlackBerry. Many electronic gadgets use microSD cards, so they’re
easy to find.
A normal price range at the time of this writing is $5 to $25 for a 1G capacity,
and $12 to $50 for a 2G capacity. A wide price range, right? Your best bet of

finding a good deal is on the Internet. We found a 1G card for $6.14 on
Amazon and $5 at Buy.com. Special promotions come and go, but we noticed
that there’s always a good deal somewhere. So, instead of listing a specific
site to go to, our best advice is to just shop around. And for any purchase on
the Internet, take into consideration the shipping and handling costs plus the
return policy of the vendor. Any brand will do, as long as you make sure that
you are purchasing a microSD card.
Stereo Headphones
Although your new BlackBerry is a stereo music player, it doesn’t come with
stereo headphones. You will definitely yearn for stereo sound the moment
you listen to or watch video clips on your BlackBerry. A quick search on the
Internet for your BlackBerry model and stereo headphones will yield many
results. The key is to make sure that the headphones support your BlackBerry
model and have good reviews. You could spend $30 to $200. Here are several
that we liked:
 BlackBerry Stereo Headset for the BlackBerry 8800 and Pearl
 Motorola HT820 Bluetooth Stereo Headphones for the BlackBerry 8300
 Seidio 2-in-1 Foldable Headphones for the BlackBerry 8800 and Pearl
 Motorola S805 Bluetooth DJ Headphones with A2DP and AVRCP for the
BlackBerry 8300
 Sony Ericsson HBH-DS970 Bluetooth Stereo Headphones for the
BlackBerry 8300
 Nokia BH-601 Bluetooth Stereo Headphones for the BlackBerry 8300
A Belt Clip
Regardless of which BlackBerry model you have, the belt clip that comes with
it does the job, even if lacks that personal touch. If you want a new case, you
have plenty to choose from, with looks ranging from sporty to professional.
These cases will set you back anywhere from $20 to $40, which isn’t too bad
for looking hip.
Here’s where you can buy a new belt clip:
 www.bberry.com
 www.blackberryden.com
310
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 www.blackberrysource.com
 www.blackberrystuff.com
When you buy a new belt clip, buy one made specifically for your 
BlackBerry model.
A Screen Protector
If the protector case described in the preceding section is a bit stressful 
for your wallet, try Screenguardz, which costs about $10. Screenguardz 
protects your screen from scratches. Go to the Screenguardz Web site, at
www.screenguardz.com.
An Extra Battery
An extra battery for your BlackBerry will come in handy if you are a 
daily BlackBerry user. We recommend that you buy your battery only from
Research In Motion (RIM), the maker of BlackBerry, and not from some other
manufacturer because a faulty battery can damage your BlackBerry beyond
repair.
Make sure the battery you buy is for your BlackBerry model.
You’ll spend around $40 for the extra battery. You can buy one from the 
following sites:
 www.blackberrysource.com
 www.blackberrystuff.com
 shopblackberry.com (RIM’s official store)
A Charger
If you watch video often on your BlackBerry, you know that the battery needs
to be charged every couple of days. And if you’re always on the go, you better
have a portable charger on hand. The charger included with your BlackBerry
is great to carry around town (and the world) because it has multiple adapters
for different countries’ electric plugs.
311
Chapter 20: Ten Great BlackBerry Accessories

If you are a road warrior, we recommend the BlackBerry car charger. It will
set you back around $30.
Make sure that the charger you buy is for your BlackBerry model.
You can get a BlackBerry car charger from the following:
 www.blackberrysource.com
 www.blackberrystuff.com
 shopblackberry.com (RIM’s official store)
A Bluetooth Hands-Free Headset
If you’re a frequent phone user, we definitely recommend that you pick up 
a Bluetooth hands-free headset. Even though a wired hands-free headset comes
with your BlackBerry, the convenience of a wireless Bluetooth hands-free head-
set is hard to live without.
Plenty of Bluetooth headsets are on the market for you to choose from. Here
are some with good reviews from people who bought them:
 Aliph Jawbone Noise Shield
 BlackBerry HS-655
 Jabra BT5020
 Motorola H700
 Plantronics Discovery 655
 Plantronics Explorer 320
 Sony Ericsson HBH-IV835
You probably need to spend anywhere from $50 to $140 for a Bluetooth
hands-free headset. The best place to get one is good ol’ Amazon:
www.amazon.com.
A Full Keyboard
If you compose long e-mails or draft long proposals on your BlackBerry, a full-
sized keyboard is perfect for you. You’ll save typing time, and also save your
thumbs from blistering.
312
Part V: The Part of Tens 

You have your choice of Bluetooth and non-Bluetooth connection options.
A Bluetooth keyboard is the most convenient option for the obvious reasons
that you don’t have to carry cables and your BlackBerry can be positioned
any way you want. For less than $100, you can own the cool Freedom
Universal Bluetooth Keyboard, available at www.bberry.com.
Or you can buy the ThinkOutside Stowaway Shasta Bluetooth Keyboard 
for BlackBerry 7100, 8100, 8300, 8700, or 8800 series, available at 
blackberrystuff.com for $124.95.
For a non-Bluetooth connection option, you connect the keyboard by using
the USB cable. Ranging from $130 to $240, you can get this type of keyboard
from Man & Machine at www.man-machine.com.
An External Speakerphone
BlackBerry comes with a speakerphone, but if the sound quality from a small
speaker just isn’t good enough for you to comprehend the phone conversation
while in a car, check out a wireless Bluetooth speakerphone:
 Blueant Blue Sonic Bluetooth for the BlackBerry 8300
 Com One Bluetooth Speakerphone for the BlackBerry 8300
For about $100, you can get either of them from blackberrysource.com.
A Car Mount
To complete your BlackBerry car experience, you need a place to mount 
your BlackBerry in your car with the Auto PDA Holder Kit. For about $30,
your BlackBerry will be securely fastened to the Auto PDA Holder so that your
BlackBerry is in your sight at all times. You can get an Auto PDA Holder Kit
from blackberrysource.com.

Ten Productive BlackBerry
Applications
In This Chapter
 MyUtils 2.0
 WorldMate for BlackBerry
 BerryDialer
 Litefeeds
 eOffice
 VeriChat for BlackBerry
 bbSpell
 MidpSSH Mobile SSH Client
 Idokorro Mobile Desktop
 TrafficEdge
U
p to this point in the book, we’ve shown you how you can be productive
by multitasking with your BlackBerry. If you ever need help to be even
more productive, here are ten applications that can help you get that extra
squeeze. Please check our companion Web site for this book at www.
blackberryfordummies.com for an updated list.
MyUtils 2.0
MyUtils 2.0 is a collection of utility tools, hence the name. You get MyClock,
which is a beautiful rendition of a clock that you can program as a timer or a
stopwatch. There’s also the Holidays 2007 edition, which gives you public 
holidays from 39 countries and religious holidays from major religions. 

You also get MyUnits, which is an advanced unit converter. MyTips quickly
computes how much you have to tip after a meal, and conveniently splits the
bill for you. Other tools include making your BlackBerry a flashlight, a cur-
rency converter, and an international dialing code finder. For about $15, you
can use your PC to download MyUtils 2.0 from www.handango.com. Future
upgrades are free.
WorldMate for BlackBerry
If you’re a frequent flier, WorldMate is the application for you. You can get
updated flight information on your BlackBerry for more than 800 airlines, so
if your flight is delayed, you’ll know in advance. You can also get local infor-
mation about your destination, but the features don’t stop there. WorldMate
also has up-to-date weather forecasts, a currency converter, and world time.
For about $75, you can buy WorldMate from Handango, and there is a trial
version in case you want to check it out first. Use your PC to download
WorldMate at www.handango.com.
BerryDialer
Nowadays, you have many options for lowering the cost of international 
calling. You could use Skype or other VOIP providers. Sometimes phone
cards are cheaper for select countries and may also be convenient to use.
With BerryDialer, you can store up to 100 phone card numbers. It also inte-
grates with Address Book. When you want to call someone, BerryDialer gives
you a convenient option to dial any one of those phone card numbers first.
Check it out. For about $20, you can use your BlackBerry to download
BerryDialer at www.mobilesoftmarket.com.
Litefeeds
Litefeeds is an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) reader that keeps you up-to-
date on the information you care about — and you can add as many RSS feeds
as you want. Think of RSS as a way to get many forms of information via a PC —
316
Part V: The Part of Tens 

or in this case, your BlackBerry. Getting to your RSS feed is easy; you can syn-
chronize with your online reader, post articles to your blog from your
BlackBerry, and e-mail articles to friends. Not only that, you can receive
e-mail alerts for important subscriptions, synchronize with Bloglines, view
secure feeds such as your Gmail or corporate feeds, and bookmark articles to
your del.icio.us account. You can read more about Litefeeds and how to
download the reader at www.litefeeds.com.
eOffice
Your BlackBerry can view Microsoft Office documents, but it doesn’t allow
you to edit them — until now. Having eOffice is like having Office on your
BlackBerry. Along with a full-size keyboard (see Chapter 20), your BlackBerry
can be your office when you’re away from the office. With eOffice, you can
compose and edit Word, Excel, and other Office-compatible documents right
from your BlackBerry. For about $200 (other pricing available), you can
download eOffice from DynoPlex at www.dynoplex.com.
VeriChat for Blackberry
If you have accounts with more than one instant messaging application, such
as AOL Messenger and Yahoo! Messenger, you can use VeriChat to log onto all
of your instant message accounts by using just one application. What’s even
better is that this application uses an Internet connection, not SMS, so you’re
covered if you have an unlimited data plan. For about $35, you can use your
PC to download VeriChat at www.handango.com.
bbSpell
BlackBerry Curve has a built-in spell checker, but if you own another
BlackBerry model, did you ever wish you could proofread your e-mails for
spelling errors? Well, with bbSpell you can. After installation, the spell
checker is built into the Messages application. For about $35 per year, you
can download bbSpell at www.somedevelopers.com/download.htm.

ho says BlackBerry is all work and no play? True, you can get tons
accomplished on your BlackBerry, but what you get accomplished
doesn’t necessarily need to be work related. Yes, you do have the BrickBreaker
game that comes with your BlackBerry, but you can only beat it so many
times before you get bored.
As the BlackBerry becomes increasing popular, numerous BlackBerry game
companies are making more and more decent titles. For example, you can
play a couple of holes on the Pebble Beach golf course, or you can play a
game of online Texas Hold ’em with other BlackBerry users. Whatever you
play, you can find a huge selection of games out there. What’s even better is
that some great games are free.

After this chapter, you might play so many games on your BlackBerry that
you’ll have to watch your productivity level. Please check our companion
Web site — www.blackberryfordummies.com — for an updated list.
Sudoku
What would a handheld device be nowadays without Sudoku? Yes, it’s the
Sudoku people love. Be it in a paper or digital format, folks are getting
addicted to this number puzzle. Many game publishers sell Sudoku games,
but you don’t have to spend a dime if you download one from RIM’s site at
mobile.blackberry.com. On the Fun & Games section, select Super
Games, and then select Free Games.
Bookworm
A warning: The Bookworm word game is addictive. It is part crossword puzzle
and part word jumble and part arcade puzzler. Your job is to make Lex, the
hungry bookworm, well fed with words. If you are up to the challenge, you 
can buy it for $7.95 or download a free trial version. Point your BlackBerry 
to bb.magmic.com/game?show=Bookworm.
Bass Assassin
Ever want to catch a 10-kilogram fish while on the subway? Well, now you can
with Bass Assassin from Magmic. To catch the big one, you need to master the
skill of casting the bait and reeling in the bass with just the right line tension.
After catching a few, you can view them all in the Trophy Room.
You can buy Bass Assassin for $5.95 or download a trial version. Use your
BlackBerry to go to bb.magmic.com/game?show=BassAssassin2.
Raging Rivers
With the Raging Rivers game, you travel around the world to conquer different
raging rivers in your kayak. Using the controls is easy, but the river is harder
to predict with each course you beat, so controlling your kayak isn’t easily
320

mastered. Show off to your friends by posting your fastest time online right
from your BlackBerry.
You can buy Raging Rivers for $5.95 or download a trial version. Use your
BlackBerry to go to bb.magmic.com/game?show=RagingRivers.
Texas Hold ’em King
Crave a game of Texas Hold ’em while away from your buddies? Practice your
bluff with Texas Hold ’em King. We like this game because you can even play
an online tournament right from your BlackBerry. You can buy the game for
$7.95 or download a trial version. Point your BlackBerry to bb.magmic.com/
game?show=THK2.
Klondike
If you’re into card games, you’ve likely seen Klondike in other forms elsewhere.
Well, Magmic brings Klondike to your BlackBerry. You can buy Klondike for
$4.95 or download a trial version. From your BlackBerry, go to bb.magmic.
com/game?show=Klondike.

your BlackBerry, go to bb.magmic.com/game?show=SpiderSolitaire.

Chapter 22: Ten Fun Games on Your BlackBerry 

Blockazoid
Do you love a game of Tetris, but you’re tired of the same old thing every
time? How about Tetris with a twist — with Blockazoid. Not only do you have
to control falling blocks, you also have to combine blocks with like colors. You

T
he industry of BlackBerry software is growing at a dizzying rate. In
Chapter 21, we describe ten programs that should help increase your
productivity — and in Chapter 22, another ten programs to entertain you. 
In this chapter, we introduce ten more applications that aren’t necessarily
designed to make you more productive or entertain you. However, these are
great programs; whether you will like them depends on your personality.
There are no specific reviews to quote, but these choices are the results of
our quest to find programs that people use, discerned from either postings on
message boards or commentaries in the public domain. Some of this software
is free, but never underestimate the freebies; those that we include here are
useful and neat.

The applications we feature here are just the tip of the iceberg. By all means,
feel free to surf the Internet because by the time this book is published, more
software will likely be available. And don’t forget to visit our Web site at www.
blackberryfordummies.com.
Handmark Pocket Express
If we have to recommend one application, Pocket Express is it. This is a
handy and reliable tool to get news and other important information such 
as weather, sports updates, maps, and stocks. This application is one of the
best information aggregators out there. The user interface is intuitive. You
can even buy and install other applications from within Pocket Express. And
the best part is, it’s free. Well, not everything. They charge a fee for accessing
their premium channels. Download Pocket Express from your BlackBerry at
express.handmark.com.
BBWeather
BBWeather allows you to subscribe to weather updates for a specified 
location. The data comes from weather.com, and you can set it up by using
locator identification. This is different from the weather forecast presented 
in BBToday (see later in this chapter) because BBToday gives you a summa-
rized view whereas BBWeather gives you more detailed information, such as
UV index, wind speed, humidity, barometric pressure, dew point, visibility,
times for sunrise and sunset, and the phase of the moon. You can configure
the forecast screen for a number of days. The forecast screen includes the
usual weather information plus precipitation, wind speed, and humidity. 
To download BBWeather from your PC, go to the following Web site: 
sourceforge.net. This is another freebie, so there’s no reason 
to not get it.
Beyond411
Another free program for your arsenal is Beyond411. This evolution of
Berry411 works the same as your local 411 information source, but you don’t
have to pay for the service. You get yellow pages as well as white pages. We
find this program useful for getting movie times for local theaters. It’s a 
location-based application, so if you have GPS on your BlackBerry, this 
324
Part V: The Part of Tens 

works great because it gives you local information based on your current
location. To download, go to thebogles.com from your BlackBerry.
Digby
For those online shoppers who need to shop all the time, Digby is the program
for you. You can download it for free to start browsing their growing selections.
What we don’t like is that you have to enter your personal information on the
BlackBerry instead of having the option to enter it on the PC first. To try it,
point your BlackBerry browser to www.digby.com/download.
Google Talk Mobile and Yahoo!
Messenger Mobile
If you currently use Google Talk or Yahoo! Messenger on your PC, both
mobile versions are a must-download to keep up with your buddies no matter
where you are. To download, point your BlackBerry browser to
 Google Talk Mobile: www.blackberry.com/GoogleTalk
 Yahoo! Messenger Mobile: www.blackberry.com/YahooDownload
iSkoot Skype Client
If you are a big fan of Skype, now you don’t have to sit on your computer 
to use the service. The folks at iSkoot make it possible for you to fully 
utilize Skype functionality from your BlackBerry. Calling a Skype buddy? 
No problem. Chatting with your Skype friends? That’s what this program 
is for. Plus, it’s free! To download it from your PC, go to www.iskoot.com.
bbTV
TV on your BlackBerry? That’s right. The caveat is that at the time of this
writing, bbTV is available only in Canada through Rogers Wireless. A fee of $5
Canadian a month is added to your wireless bill if you use the service. To get
started, go to www.canada.com/bbtv/rogers.html.

Chapter 23: More than Ten Must-Have BlackBerry Programs

AskMeNow
Stop scratching your head. When you have a pressing question, you don’t
need to look for answers anywhere other than your BlackBerry. After you
install AskMeNow, a guru is ready to answer that nagging question in your
head. If your query can possibly be answered by a human being, you can ask
it here. If you don’t know what to ask, AskMeNow has precanned questions
such as directions, weather, sports updates, and flight information. The
answer is sent to you through e-mail, usually within two minutes. For pricing,
visit their Web site at askmenow.com. To download the program from your
BlackBerry, go to askmenow.com/applications.aspx.
Stock Ticker
In the world of stocks, timing is everything. For those of you who are actively
trading — if you can’t enjoy your latté without worrying about what’s going
on with your stocks — Stock Ticker will help. You get the latest quotes and
stock information, even when you’re not looking at your three stock-monitor
terminals. It features a scrolling interface with minute-by-minute news and
commentaries. For about $25 for six months, you can download Stock Ticker
from your PC by going to www.handango.com.
Ascendo Money
Ascendo Money is one of the best-selling, best-rated, and most comprehensive
personal finance managers for BlackBerry. You can manage your checkbook,
track your expenses, sync with your PC, and integrate with popular finance PC
applications such as Quicken and MS Money. It costs $29.95 but there is also a
free trial. You can download Ascendo Money from your PC by going to
www.handango.com.
Ascendo Fitness
For the health conscious among us, here is award-winning software for your
BlackBerry. Ascendo Fitness tracks the calories you’re eating and the calories
you’re burning in exercise. It presents your progress by displaying easy-to-
understand graphs. Based on your personal data, Ascendo has calculators
326
Part V: The Part of Tens 

that provide your ideal weight, body mass index (BMI), maximum heart rate
based on age, and basal metabolism ratio (BMR). We have heard many good
comments from those who use this product. For $29.95, you can download
Ascendo Fitness from your PC by going to www.handango.com.
BBToday
If you’re experiencing information overload, you’re not alone. BBToday 
helps you make sense of all this information without so much hair pulling. 
In a nutshell, BBToday tries to give you a tear sheet on a daily basis. The 
nice thing about BBToday is its capability to show up every time you unlock 
or open your BlackBerry. It appears full screen with the following information
in a summarized format:
 Current date and time
 E-mail summary
 Remaining battery strength
 Signal strength
 Appointments scheduled for the day
 Tasks scheduled for the day
 Current weather information and five-day forecast
 Phone call summary
 Stock quotes
This is like having an assistant tell you what your day will be like, organizing
your PIM (personal information manager) information and presenting it in such
a way that you don’t have to spend time viewing each of your PIM applications.
You can configure the weather to point to your local area. You can also add the
stock ticker for the stock quotes section.
You can download BBToday for free from your BlackBerry by going to 
blackberrytools.sourceforge.net.

W
eb surfing with a BlackBerry has improved dramatically with the
newer models. With the introduction of the trackball, RIM added the
ability for you to view Web pages in a desktop format. The caveat is that you
have to scroll left to right to see the width of a page. For convenience, you
could always go back to using the mobile format where everything fits top to
bottom and no scrolling to the right is needed.
However, not all Web sites are designed for mobile devices, so even with all
the improvements RIM made to Browser, some pages still do not display
properly. We’re sure that you’ve been to Web sites that take a long time to
display, and when the page does finish loading, the images and text are all
bunched together. For BlackBerry users, this lack of readability on some Web
pages is a disappointment and might have led you to believe that your
BlackBerry Browser is the problem.

Guaranteeing a good surfing experience on your BlackBerry is simple: Where
you surf is what matters. So what does that mean? Psst: Many popular Web
sites have two versions — one for a PC Web browser and another for mobile
device browsers, such as BlackBerry Browser.
In this chapter, we show you some Web sites that are specifically made to be
viewed on mobile devices. So the next time you need information from the
Web, you don’t need to run to your PC. Rather, get it instantly from your
BlackBerry. Please check our companion Web site for this book —
www.blackberryfordummies.com — for an updated list.
You have to access all links in this chapter from your BlackBerry for them 
to work.
Weather
Weather changes quite often, but you can keep up with the changes with the
sites in this section.
AccuWeather.com
www.accuweather.com
AccuWeather.com provides the local weather forecast.
 Pros: Simple and easy to use. Enter a location and it gives you the local
weather forecast for that location. The site uses cookies, so it will save
the location for you and use it the next time you return. You can enter
up to five locations.
 Con: It displays only one location at a time, so you need to define a default
location if you enter more than one location in the list.
Weather.com
http://www.weather.com
Weather.com is smart enough to know that you are using a mobile device and
displays a cut-down version of their page with few links to nonweather-related
information.
330
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Pros: Displays not only the local weather forecast but also local weather-
related news, plus it gives out any delays in the surrounding airports.
 Cons: Displays the forecast for only a single location and also displays
advertisements.
If these two sites are not good enough for you, check out the “Portals” section,
later in this chapter. Major portals have weather information as well as traffic
alerts and airport delays.
News
Most major news companies have mobile versions of their sites. This section
is just a sampling of what’s out there.
Mobile New York Times
mobile.nytimes.com
This is the New York Times mobile-friendly Web site.
 Pros: You get a decent amount of news from this site. Pages load fast
and there are no advertisements, so the site is clean and easy to read.
 Con: News article are cut down to multiple pages, so you have to click 
to the next page multiple times to read an entire article.
Mobile Newsweek
mobile.newsweek.com
This is Newsweek’s mobile-friendly Web site.
 Pros: Pages load fast and you can view the whole article in a single page.
There are no advertisements, so the site is clean and easy to read.
 Cons: Limited to major headlines and doesn’t have breaking news.
331
Chapter 24: Ten Web Site Categories for BlackBerry Browsing

BBC News
www.bbc.com
You can read news from the BBC News right from your BlackBerry, even if
you’re not in the UK.
 Pros: The site is very BlackBerry friendly with a good deal of world
news. There are no advertisement banners or annoying images to load.
 Con: The weather, traffic, and other information are UK-centric, which
isn’t so great if you’re not a UK resident.
USA Today
www.usatoday.com
USA Today, one of the most popular newspapers, is now available for free
from your BlackBerry.
 Pros: We like the listing of news in different categories on the very first
page, where you can browse through all the news before choosing to read
one particular article. Also, news articles are presented on one page, so
there is no need to load multiple pages to keep reading, which is great if
you know you’re about to lose your signal (like in a subway).
 Con: The first page always displays a picture related to the current head-
line and, depending on your network coverage at the time of loading, this
can take a while to load.
ABC News
www.abcnews.com
Get ABC News on TV on your BlackBerry.
 Pros: Very similar to USA Today, this site features a simple layout, with no
advertisement banners to load. It’s well organized and easy to navigate
based on news categories.
 Cons: It takes a decent amount of time to load even on the EDGE network.
The first page also displays a picture related to the latest headline and,
depending on your network coverage, this picture may take a long time
to load.
332
Part V: The Part of Tens 

All sites in this chapter must be accessed from your BlackBerry directly for
them to work.
PR Newswire
www.prnewswire.com/tnw/tnw.shtml
If you’re out of the office but want to keep up with the latest news, you can by
accessing this site.
 Pro: This site is great for up-to the-minute news.
 Con: This site isn’t great for news browsing because it doesn’t break
down the news by category.
Wired News
mobile.wired.com
Wired News is the mobile version of this tech news Web site.
 Pro: This site is easy to navigate from your BlackBerry.
 Con: It’s not updated often.
Google
www.google.com/xhtml
The king of search engines does not disappoint with a mobile version of 
its power search engine. This version of Google search displays shortened
descriptions of search results and has an option that you can set to trans-
form regular Web sites to make them mobile-device friendly.
 Pro: We like the option to format Web pages for phone viewing.
 Cons: Because the search result descriptions are shorter, you will some-
times miss important information that you would have seen if you used
their regular Web site. The transformed Web sites don’t always work
properly; it depends on the sites you search for.
333
Chapter 24: Ten Web Site Categories for BlackBerry Browsing

Portals
The sites in this section are Web portals, which are sites that contain various
information or links to other sites.
RIM’s Mobile Homepage
mobile.blackberry.com
This is the default home page setting for most BlackBerry Browsers. The 
service provider has the option to customize it, though, so it’s likely that
your BlackBerry Browser may be pointing to your service provider’s home
page. RIM’s home page is definitely a place to start browsing the Web.
This site should definitely be bookmarked.
 Pros: Great directory. You can get freebies here for your BlackBerry.
Check out the Fun & Games section because RIM provides links to free
games from time to time.
 Cons: None at the moment.
Yahoo! Mobile
www.yahoo.com
Yahoo! is a smart portal because it detects that you are using a mobile device
and formats the page accordingly, meaning a smaller page with no advertise-
ments. The portal site allows BlackBerry users to employ regular Yahoo! func-
tions, such as Yahoo! Mail, Messenger, Finance, and Games, as well as driving
directions and weather.
This site should definitely be bookmarked.
 Pros: Yahoo! does a great job with the mobile version of its original site.
It loads quickly, and navigation is user friendly. After you sign in with
your Yahoo! user name and password, you can get the same personal-
ized content as you would on your PC. If you are outside the U.S., check
out the International link from their home page. It allows you to choose
your country and then customizes the pages based on your locale.
 Cons: None at the moment.
334
Part V: The Part of Tens 

MSN Mobile
http://mobile.msn.com
The MSN Mobile portal is similar to the Yahoo! Mobile site. As a BlackBerry
user, you can access MSN Hotmail, MSN Messenger, and an online calendar. 
It has all the other features that you can find in a Web portal, such as Web
search, weather lookup, sports information, and news. Plus you get their
finance-related pages, which give you up-to-the-minute stock quotes.
 Pro: Unlike Yahoo!, MSN provides a local search, which you can use to
search for lodging, food, and movie theaters near a location that you
provide. This definitely can come in handy when you are on the go.
 Cons: Unfortunately, MSN has annoying pictures and commercial banners
on its site.
Business
While on the go, you can keep up with the latest news of the finance world
from your BlackBerry. Visit the sites in this section for finance-related articles
and news.
Yahoo! Finance
wap.oa.yahoo.com/raw?dp=quote
finance.yahoo.com
The first link is a mobile version of Yahoo! Finance, and the second one is
their regular site. Our experiences with both have been good.
 Pros: This is the best free finance-related site we’ve found. You get com-
prehensive information about your stocks. News and investment articles
are updated frequently.
 Con: The mobile version is designed for phones, meaning little informa-
tion is displayed at a time. Although the page loads fast, you’ll end up
navigating more to get the information you need.
335
Chapter 24: Ten Web Site Categories for BlackBerry Browsing

Fidelity Anywhere
www.fi-w.com/fiw/FiwHome
Fidelity Anywhere is the mobile version of Fidelity.com, an online investment
brokerage firm.
 Pros: You can sign on and view your portfolio and balances. You can
even access your stock-watch list and buy and sell stocks and funds
right from your BlackBerry. User navigation is simple and easy.
 Cons: None at the moment.
BusinessWeek Online
http://www.businessweek.com
The link is smart enough to display the mobile version of Business Week
when opened in the BlackBerry. You can get great finance information here.
 Pros: You don’t need a subscription to read articles. Also, the site is rich
in finance information.
 Cons: None at the moment.
Travel
The sites in Table 24-1 all feature flight status and gate numbers. Some allow
you to log on if you are part of their frequent-flier program to access fre-
quent-flier benefits.

age of sports-related news, team standings, game schedules, and results.

 Pros: FedEx’s mobile site offers a simple user interface and even allows
you to log on and arrange shipment.
 Cons: None at the moment.
UPS tracking

Like FedEx, UPS also has a mobile version of its Web site that allows you to
