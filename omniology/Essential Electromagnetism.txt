Preface
Preface
“Essential Electromagnetism” and “Essential Electrodynamics” (also to be published by Ven-
tus) are intended to be resources for students taking electromagnetism courses while pursuing
undergraduate studies in physics and engineering. Due to limited space available in this series,
it is not possible to go into the material in great depth, so I have attempted to encapsulate
what I consider to be the essentials. This book does not aim to replace existing textbooks
on these topics of which there are many excellent examples, several of which are listed in the
bibliography. Nevertheless, if appropriately supplemented, this book and “Essential Electro-
dynamics” could together serve as a textbook for 2nd and 3rd year electromagnetism courses
at Australian and British universities, or for junior/senior level electromagnetism courses at
American universities/colleges.
The book assumes a working knowledge of partial diﬀerential equations, vectors and vector
calculus as would normally be acquired in mathematics courses taken by physics and engineering
students. However, very brief introductions to vectors, vector calculus and index notation are
given in the appendices.
Some of the mathematical derivations have been relegated to the
appendices, and some of those are carried out using index notation which is brieﬂy introduced
in Appendix D, but elsewhere in the book manipulation of equations involving vector diﬀerential
calculus is done using standard vector calculus identities (also given in the appendices).
The presentation of the subject material in this book is conventional, starting with forces
between charges, electric ﬁeld, Coulomb’s law, electric ﬂux, Gauss’ law and the electrostatic
potential. Chapter 2 is on Poisson’s and Laplace’s equations, and their solution. The method
of images is applied to simple examples in plane, cylindrical and spherical geometry. Laplace’s
equation is solved analytically in Cartesian coordinates for the cases where the boundaries
are orthogonal planes, and in spherical coordinates where the boundary surface is a sphere;
these being the most commonly-encountered problems involving Laplace’s equation. Solution of
Laplace’s equation in cylindrical coordinates is not included, but may be found in most applied
mathematics texts.
A numerical ﬁnite-diﬀerence method is described for solving Laplace’s
equation. This method is applicable whether or not the boundary conditions allow analytic
solutions.
Chapter 3 is on the multipole expansion of the electrostatic potential, up to and including the
quadrupole term. Chapter 4 is on macroscopic and microscopic dielectric theory, starting with
the polarisation ﬁeld, polarisation charges, Gauss’ law and the displacement ﬁeld, susceptibility
and permittivity, and the boundary conditions on the electric and displacement ﬁelds. Orien-

Preface
tational polarisability of molecules, electronic polarisability of non-polar molecules and ionic
polarisability of crystals are discussed. Finally, the Clausius-Mossotti formula which connects
the microscopic and macroscopic theories is derived.
Chapter 5 deals with the magnetic ﬁeld, its causes, magnetic forces and the magnetic ﬂux. The
magnetic vector potential is derived from the Biot-Savart law, and a derivation of Ampère’s
law follows, together with examples of its use in solving problems in magnetostatics. Finally
the multipole expansion of the vector potential up to the dipole term is performed, and mag-
netic dipoles are discussed together with their magnetic ﬁeld and the torques and forces they
experience in a magnetic ﬁeld.
Chapter 6 focuses on the magnetism of materials, starting with the magnetisation ﬁeld, mag-
netisation currents and their inclusion in Ampère’s law, and the introduction of the auxiliary
ﬁeld H. Next, susceptibility and permeability are deﬁned, and the boundary conditions on the
magnetic and auxiliary ﬁelds are derived. Finally, the causes of magnetisation are discussed,
namely orientational polarisability of atomic magnetic dipoles associated with unpaired electron
spins causing paramagnetism, and the quantum mechanical exchange interaction in some ma-
terials giving rise to unpaired electron spins lining up in the same direction as in neighbouring
atoms, and leading to ferromagnetism.

1.1
Electric charge, field and flux
In 1785 French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1736–1806) published his law, which
may be stated as: the force exerted on point charge Q by point charge q a distance R away
has magnitude proportional to Qq/R2 and is directed along the line between the two charges.
American statesman and scientist Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) was responsible for naming
the charge we now associate with electrons “negative” and the charge we now associate with
protons “positive”, and was the ﬁrst to state the law of conservation of charge. Electric charge
is measured in coulombs (C).
We may consider the force on charge Q as being due to the electric ﬁeld E of charge q acting
on charge Q, i.e. F = QE. The electric ﬁeld is deﬁned as the force per unit test charge (unit:

ﬁeld is to be evaluated. From Coulomb’s law, the electric ﬁeld of a point charge is
E(r) =

(1.1)
where R = (r −r′), r′ is the source point and r is the ﬁeld point as in Fig. 1.1(a), and
ε0 = 8.85418782 × 10−12 C2 N−1 m−2 is the permittivity of free space; more usually its units
are given as (F m−1) where F stands for the farad which is the unit of capacitance, and is
named after English chemist and physicist Michael Faraday (1791–1867).

Since the electric ﬁeld is the force per unit test charge, it obeys the principle of superposition
just like forces do. Hence, for a continuous charge distribution with volume charge density ρ(r)
(C m−3) the electric ﬁeld is (Fig. 1.1b)

We may think of the electric ﬁeld of, for example, an isolated positive point charge (Fig. 1.2a),
in terms of ﬁeld lines which emerge isotropically from positive charges (Fig. 1.2b). The number
of ﬁeld lines per unit area crossing a concentric sphere of radius r is then n/(4πr2) ∝1/r2 where
n ∝q is the number of ﬁeld lines originating at q. At any location, the electric ﬁeld’s direction
is tangential to the ﬁeld line at that location.

all charges present. Note that in these, and subsequent, ﬁgures the point charges are located
at the centres of the white discs on which their charge is written. (The ﬁeld line tracing for all
the images in this book which show electric or magnetic ﬁeld ﬁeld lines has been done using
a numerical scheme based on the 2nd order Runge-Kutta method for initial value problems
described in Appendix F.)

surface, i.e. dS ≡n dS. In the case of a closed surface the direction of dS is always deﬁned to
be outward from the volume, but otherwise there is an ambiguity and the direction must be
speciﬁed.
For a spherical surface of radius r centred on the origin as illustrated in Fig. 1.3(a)
dS = (r dθ)(r sin θ dϕ) = r2 sin θ dθ dϕ = r2 |d(cos θ)| dϕ
(1.4)
and n = r. Thus, for charge +q at the origin, the ﬂux outward through the sphere of radius r
centred on the origin is

Of course, we could obtain this result more easily by exploiting the spherical symmetry of the
problem — the surface integral is simply the product of E = q/(4πε0r2) with the total area of
the sphere S = 4πr2.

Figure 1.3: (a) Surface element dS of a sphere of radius r centred on the origin, illustrating
spherical coordinates (r, θ, ϕ). (b) Surfaces dS1, dS2 and dS3 subtend the same solid angle dΩ
at point P. (c) Surfaces dS2 and dS4 are parts of the closed surface of a tetrahedron, with dS2
subtending solid angle dΩat point P, whereas dS4 subtends solid angle −dΩat point P.
Another way of considering the electric ﬂux through a spherical surface is in terms of the solid
angle subtended by surface element dS at the centre of the sphere. The solid angle can be
deﬁned in an analogous way to an ordinary angle. An arc of length ℓwhich is part of a circle
or radius r subtends angle θ = ℓ/r radians (rad) at the centre, so that if the arc were closed
(i.e. a circle) the angle would be θ = 2πr/r = 2π rad. In a similar way area dS which is part
of a spherical surface of radius r subtends solid angle dΩ= dS/r2 steradians (sr) at the centre,
so that if the surface were closed (i.e. a sphere) the solid angle would be Ω= 4πr2/r2 = 4π sr.
Hence the solid angle subtended at the centre by surface element dS in Fig. 1.3(a) is
dΩ= dS
r2 = sin θ dθ dϕ = |d(cos θ)| dϕ.
(1.6)
In Fig. 1.3(b) the solid angles subtended at point P by small surfaces dS1, dS2 and dS3 are
obviously the same – it is the solid angle dΩwithin the cone which has its apex at P. Notice
that only dS1 could be part of a spherical surface centred on P, in this case having radius R1,
whereas dS2 and dS3 are not centred on P. However, what counts is the projected area, so that

where R1, R2 and R3 are separation vectors from P to dS1, dS2 and dS3. For dS1, dS2 and

Supposing dS1, dS2 and dS3 are parts of closed surfaces S1, S2 and S3 of arbitrary shape

= 0; notice that the contributions from dS2 and dS4 cancel each
other out as dΩ4 = −dΩ2.
Returning to Fig. 1.3(b), the electric ﬂuxes due to charge q at P out through surrounding closed
surfaces S1, S2 and S3 (of which dS1, dS2 and dS3 are surface elements) are

, (1.9)
and this is the same for all closed surfaces surrounding charge q.
We can also think of this in terms of the number of ﬁeld lines leaving a charge per unit solid
angle being isotropic (the same in all directions), and the electric ﬂux through a suface being
proportional to the number of ﬁeld lines which in turn is proportional to the charge. Then the
electric ﬂux out through a closed surface is proportional to the solid angle it subtends, which
is 4π if the charge is inside the closed surface, or zero if the charge is outside. If we double the
charge the ﬂux would double, or if we add additional positive charges inside the closed surface
the electric ﬂux would always equal the sum of the charges inside, divided by ε0.
Since the direction along a ﬁeld line is identical to that of the ﬁeld direction, ﬁeld lines must
start on positive charges. Similarly, they must end on negative charges (or extent to inﬁnity).
Examples of ﬁeld lines for diﬀerent charge conﬁgurations were already shown in Figs. 1.2(d)–(f).
Consider closed surface S surrounding all of the charge in Figs. 1.2(d)–(f). For Fig. 1.2(d) the
net number of ﬁeld lines leaving S is zero as is the net charge inside, so ΦE = (q −q)/ε0 = 0.
For Fig. 1.2(e) ΦE = (q +q)/ε0 = 2q/ε0, while for Fig. 1.2(f) for which twice as many ﬁeld lines
leave surface S as enter it ΦE = (2q −q)/ε0 = q/ε0.

Where the symmetry permits, Gauss’ law in integral form (Eq. 1.10) gives a powerful method of
ﬁnding the electric ﬁeld. The trick is to ﬁnd a volume satisfying: (i) surfaces are either normal
to or parallel to the electric ﬁeld, (ii) where the electric ﬁeld is normal it is constant over that
surface, (iii) the charge inside can be easily calculated. In the case of surface charges it is useful
to construct a Gaussian pillbox with narrow sides and top and bottom surfaces parallel to the
surface containing the charge. Classic examples include the inﬁnite plane with uniform surface
charge density σ (C m−2) shown in Fig. 1.4(a), and the line charge density λ (C m−1) of inﬁnite
length shown in Fig. 1.4(b).

For the case of the inﬁnite plane, from symmetry arguments the direction of the electric ﬁeld
must be normal to the plane, and for positive charge, E must be pointing away from the plane.

valence electrons, which are potentially free to move in the quantum well of the volume of the
solid which has embedded in it a 3D periodic potential due to the ions in the crystal lattice.
As a result, the discrete energy levels of the atoms in the solid merge into separate bands of
closely spaced energy levels, possibly with a substantial energy gap between bands.
The energy levels are populated with all the electrons in the solid starting with the lowest levels,
but with a maximum of two electrons per level (one with spin up and the other spin down) as
allowed by the Pauli exclusion principle. As one level is ﬁlled, remaining electrons go in the
next level, and so on. The energy of the highest ﬁlled level is called the Fermi energy, EF . Of
course, at ﬁnite temperature there is a spread of electron energies above and below the Fermi
energy, except when the band is completely ﬁlled and the energy band gap is too large. Where
EF is within a band determines whether the material is a conductor, semiconductor or insulator
(Fig. 1.5).

Electronic band structure of insulators, semiconductors and conductors.
Red
represents ﬁlled levels, and yellow represents vacant levels.
Materials with only one valence electron per atom typically half ﬁll the valence band, whereas
materials with two valence electrons per atom ﬁll the valence band. If the Fermi energy is in the
middle of the band then lots of electrons with energies near the Fermi energy are able to move to
nearby vacant levels in response to an electric ﬁeld, as this takes only a tiny amount of energy,
and are therefore able to move freely throughout the solid, making the material a conductor.
Also, if there are exactly enough electrons to ﬁll the valence band but the conduction band
overlaps it, then electrons can easily move to the conduction band and the material is also a
conductor.
In contrast if the Fermi energy is at the top of a band, i.e. the band is full and there are no
electrons in the next band, the material is an insulator. In insulators electrons are trapped in
their energy levels; it takes a lot of energy (the band gap energy) to jump to the next level.

Electrostatics
In semiconductors the band gap is suﬃciently small that a few electrons are able to jump
the band gap as a result of thermal excitation and/or in response to an electric ﬁeld. In the
process they leave behind vacant levels in the valence band or “holes” which act like positive
electrons and contribute to conduction, just as the electrons that jumped to the conduction
band, thereby causing the material to become semiconducting. Semiconductors used to make
electronic components are typically “doped” with impurity ions which introduce energy levels
within the band gap.
In a conductor, electrons move in response to an electric ﬁeld, which in electrostatics is due to
other charges, and will keep moving until they reach the surface where they will redistribute
themselves until the electric ﬁeld inside the conductor vanishes. Thus, in electrostatics the
entire conductor has the same potential, and its surface is an equipotential surface.
Early experiments involved rubbing glass with silk, or rubbing amber with fur. What is going
on here is that ruptured chemical bonds on the surface of one material leave a charge imbalance,
and when that material is in contact with a diﬀerent material with a diﬀerent charge imbalance
electrons will ﬂow from one material to the other. It is the contact area that is important in
charge transfer, rubbing just increases the contact area. The consequent displacement of

electrons from the glass to the silk leaves the glass positively charged, and from the fur to
the amber leaves the amber negatively charged.
Touching the charged glass to an isolated
conductor would cause some electrons to ﬂow from the conductor to the glass leaving the
conductor positively charged, whereas touching the conductor with charged amber would cause
some electrons to ﬂow from the amber to the conductor leaving it negatively charged.

The electrostatic potential
The work done, W, in moving a particle of charge Q from point A to point B along an arbitrary
path in the electric ﬁeld of charge q located at rq is

where R = (r −rq), and we have used an identity for ∇R−1 (see Appendix B.1). Because
(
∇R−1)
· dr is an exact diﬀerential, W is independent of the path taken from A to B. Ap-
plying the principle of superposition for electric ﬁelds, we see that this would be true for any
distribution of charges, and so for any electrostatic ﬁeld.
We have just shown that E is conservative in electrostatics. A conservative ﬁeld is one for
which its curl is zero, or equivalently it’s line-integral around a closed loop is zero. Thus, we

does not eﬀect the value of E(r). It is often chosen to be “at inﬁnity”. If we set r0 = ∞we get

Imagine plotting equipotential surfaces – if V only depends on say x and y you could plot a
contour map and think of high values of V corresponding to hills, and low values as valleys.
Then E at a particular location points down the steepest gradient, and is perpendicular to the
contour lines. This also means that the electric ﬁeld (and ﬁeld lines) are normal to equipotential
surfaces.

Consider charge, q1 located at r1. The work done to move a second charge q2 from inﬁnity to

This formula cannot be used for point charges as the potential would be inﬁnite at the locations
of the charges. In nature this is not a problem as point charges (e.g. electrons) become fuzzy

1–1 The surface of a non-conducting sphere of radius a centred on the origin has surface charge
density σ(a, θ, ϕ) = σ0 cos θ and is uniformly ﬁlled with charge of density ρ0. Find the

everywhere.
1–3 The electric ﬁeld is given by E(r) = E0 cos(z/z0) exp(−r/r0)r, where z0 and r0 are con-
stants. Find the charge density.
1–4 If we had a point charge q at the origin we might choose the reference point to be some
point at an arbitrary distance r0 (usually inﬁnity) from the origin. Then if we wish to
ﬁnd V (r, θ, ϕ) it would be convenient to have the reference point at r0 = (r0, θ, ϕ). Al-
though obtaining the potential in this case is trivial, and one would usually just write it
down, obtain the potential by carrying out explicitly the line integral for an appropriately
parameterised curve.

Poisson's and Laplace's equations
Learning objectives
—
To be able to derive Poisson’s equation from Gauss’ law, and know that Laplace’s equation
is a special case of Poisson’s equation which applies in charge-free regions.
—
To know that the method of images for solving Poisson’s equation works by substitut-
ing appropriate image charges for conducting boundaries, and to be able to obtain the
potential for simple cases where there is plane, spherical and cylindrical symmetry.
—
To be able to solve Laplace’s equation in Cartesian coordinates in 3D for the potential
inside a rectangular box where the potential or surface charge density is speciﬁed on all
surfaces, and also for the case where the potential only depends on two of the coordinates.
—
To be able to solve Laplace’s equation in spherical coordinates inside and outside a spher-
ical surface where the potential or surface charge density is speciﬁed, using the Legendre
polynomials in the case of no azimuthal dependence of the boundary conditions, and using
spherical harmonics for the general case.
—
To learn how to use a ﬁnite-diﬀerence numerical method for solving Laplace’s equation.
2.1
Poisson's equation

by taking the divergence of E = −∇V ,
∇· (−∇V ) = ρ(r)

giving Poisson’s equation

Poisson's and Laplace's equations
As an aside, we can use Poisson’s equation and the potential due to a point charge to check
an identity involving the 3D Dirac delta function δ3(r) which is described in Appendix C.7. A
point charge q located at rq is represented by charge density ρ(r) = q δ3(r −rq). But for this
case the potential is given by Eq. 1.19, so

(2.4)
∴
∇2

|r −rq| = −4πδ3(r −rq),
(2.5)
in agreement with Eq. C.38.
Often the boundary conditions diﬀer from V (r →∞, θ, ϕ) = 0, and we will need to solve
Poisson’s equation or Laplace’s equation taking account of boundary conditions determined by
the problem. The usual types of boundary condition are Dirichlet boundary conditions for which
V is speciﬁed at a boundary (e.g. a system of conductors held at various known potentials),
and Neumann boundary conditions for which ∂V /∂n|boundary is speciﬁed at a boundary. Note
that ∂V /∂n represents the rate of increase of V with distance in the direction normal to the
surface, and that E· n = −∂V /∂n. From Gauss’ law, this is equivalent to specifying the surface
charge density at the boundary surface. In Appendix E it is shown that the solution of Poisson’s
equation is unique if V is speciﬁed anywhere on the boundaries, or is unique up to an additive
constant potential if E · n is speciﬁed on the boundaries.
2.2
Method of images
2.2.1
Point charge above a grounded plane conductor
The method of images is a powerful way of solving Poisson’s equation where the symmetry of
the problem permits. The simplest case is that of a charge −q, say, some distance away from a
grounded plane conductor as shown in Fig. 2.1(a). If we have two equal but opposite charges in
empty space then the potential in the plane midway between the charges will be zero (Fig. 2.1b),
giving the same electric ﬁeld above that plane as above the grounded conductor with the single
charge −q. It is as if at the mirror-image point below the conducting plane there is another
charge, the image charge, qi, which in the case a plane conductor is the same magnitude but
opposite sign to the real charge.

As an example, consider the case of a grounded conductor in the xy plane with charge −q
located at (0, 0, +z0). The potential and electric ﬁeld for z > 0 can be calculated as the sum of
those due to the real charge −q and image charge +q at (0, 0, −z0),

The resulting ﬁeld lines and equipotential surfaces (equipotentials for short) are plotted in
Fig. 2.1(a). Notice that at the surface of the conductor the electric ﬁeld lines (and E) are
normal to the surface. The reason for this is that electric ﬁeld lines start or end on charges,
and that if E was not normal to the surface at some location, the charges on the surface
would experience sideways forces redistributing them across the surface until E became normal
everywhere on the surface.
Surface charge will be present on the conducting surface, as we can easily show using Gauss’ law.
Imagine a Gaussian pillbox similar to that in Fig. 1.4(a) but with the important diﬀerence that
the plane is the surface of a conductor and the volume below the plane (where the lower part
of the pillbox is) is inside the conductor. Because in electrostatics E = 0 inside a conductor,
there is only a contribution to
∮
E · dS from the upper surface of the pillbox, and the surface
charge density on a conductor must therefore be in general

E(x, y, 0) =

where s = (x2 + y2)1/2. Notice that the induced surface charge density in this case is positive
everywhere, and this is because the charge near the conductor which induced the surface charge
is negative.

Point charge outside grounded spherical conductor
The method of images may be used to ﬁnd the potential due to a point charge q outside a
grounded conducting sphere of radius a (as in Fig. 2.2a) by replacing the sphere by a ﬁctitious
image charge, qi, inside the conductor. From symmetry arguments, the image charge qi must
be on the line from sphere’s center to charge q, and the sum of the potentials due to the real
charge and image charge must be zero on the surface of the sphere, e.g. at point P,

Notice that the equipotential surfaces for this case are of circular cross section. This tells us
immediately that for the case of a line charge and a parallel grounded conducting cylinder we
can use the method of images with an equal but opposite image line charge inside the conducting
cylinder and parallel to the real line charge.
In Fig. 2.3 The line charge density λ (C m−1) is parallel to the conducting cylinder’s axis and
distance d from it. We have just seen that we can use an image line charge −λ which from
symmetry must be parallel to to and in the plane containing the cylinder axis and the real line
charge λ. One can show (Exercise 2—3) that the cylinder’s surface is an equipotential if
di = a2/d.
(2.24)
Equipotential contours and electric ﬁeld lines are shown in Fig. 2.4(b). The result above may
also be applied to the case of two parallel conducting cylinders, e.g. a twin wire transmission
line having equal but opposite charges (Fig. 2.4c) in order to work out the capacitance per unit
length (Exercise 2–4); the capacitance of two conductors with potential diﬀerence V and having
charge +q on one and −q on the other is C = q/V and will be discussed further in Chapter 4.

Laplace's Equation

2.3.1
3D Laplace's equation in Cartesian coordinates
Using the method of separation of variables we will ﬁnd the general solution for the potential
inside a rectangular box where the potential is speciﬁed to be zero on all but one of its surfaces.
The particular solution can then be obtained by applying the boundary condition that the
potential must be that speciﬁed on the surface which has V ̸= 0. Having solved for this case,
we can do the same for V being non-zero on each of the other ﬁve sides, and then use the principle
of superposition to get the full solution. The geometry to be used for solving Laplace’s equation
is shown in Fig. 2.5(a) together with a cartoon (Fig. 2.5b) indicating how the full solution may
be built up from six solutions, each being for when the potential is speciﬁed on one of the
surfaces and is zero on the other ﬁve.

(2.29)
∴
X′′(x)
X(x) + Y ′′(y)
Y (y) + Z′′(z)
Z(z) = 0.
(2.30)
Note that the 1st term depends only on x, the 2nd only on y and the 3rd only on z. The
only way that the equation can hold as x, y or z are varied independently is if each term is a
constant, and the three separation constants add to zero,
X′′(x)
X(x) = S1,
Y ′′(y)
Y (y) = S2,
Z′′(z)
Z(z) = S3,
where
S1 + S2 + S3 = 0.
(2.31)
At least one of the three separation constants must be positive and at least one must be negative.
For our hollow rectangular box (Fig. 2.5) let’s choose the surface with non-zero potential to be
that at z = c, on which the potential is speciﬁed to be V (x, y, c) = V0(x, y). It makes sense to
have S1 and S2 negative so that the equations in x and in y will have periodic solutions, making
it easy to satisfy their boundary conditions. Then the three equations to solve are
X′′(x) = −α2X(x),
Y ′′(x) = −β2Y (y),
Z′′(x) = γ2Z(z),
(2.32)
where γ2 = α2 + β2. These equations have well-known solutions
X(x) = a1 sin(αx) + a2 cos(αx),
(2.33)
Y (y) = b1 sin(βy) + b2 cos(βy),
(2.34)
Z(z) = c1 exp(γz) + c2 exp(−γz),
(2.35)
as can easily be checked by substitution. For Eqs. 2.33 and 2.34 the boundary conditions, i.e.
V (0, y, z) = V (a, y, z) = 0 and V (x, 0, z) = V (x, b, z) = 0, require a2 = b2 = 0 and that
α = αk ≡kπ

β = βl ≡lπ

and so
γ2 = γ2
kl ≡α2
k + β2

(2.36)
where k and l are integers. For Eq. 2.35 the boundary condition V (x, y, 0) = 0 requires c2 = −c1,

and so Z(z) ∝(eγz −e−γz)/2 = sinh(γz); actually, we could equally well have written the
general solution of Eq. 2.35 in terms of the hyperbolic sine and cosine functions (Fig. 2.6), i.e.
Z(z)

A useful property of the hyperbolic sine and cosine functions is that
d

and
d
dz cosh(z) = sinh(z).
(2.38)
Then, the general solution to Laplace’s Equation for the case where V (x, y, c) ̸= 0 with the
potential on all other surfaces being zero is

Poisson's and Laplace's equations
2.3.2
2D Laplace's Equation in Cartesian Coordinates
If there is no dependence on z, we need only to solve Laplace’s equation in 2D for the region
inside a rectangular cross-section pipe. Again the method of separation of variables can be used
together with the principle of superposition to break down a problem with V ̸= 0 on all four
sides to 4 simpler problems with V ̸= 0 only on one side. We need to decide after examining
the problem whether it is sensible to have the periodic solution for X(x) or for Y (y). Keep the
negative sign for the equation for X(x) if the boundary conditions suggest it would be simpler
to solve if we have a periodic solution in x, e.g. if V =0 at both boundaries in x.
The general solutions are then of the form
V (x, y) = (A cos(kx) + B sin(kx))
(
Ceky + De−ky)
,
(2.44)
or equivalently
V (x, y) = (A cos(kx) + B sin(kx))
[
C′ cosh(ky) + D′ sinh(ky)
]
.
(2.45)
Finally, the boundary conditions are applied, as for the 3D case, to ﬁnd allowed values of k and
the coeﬃcients in the Fourier series for the potential on the side where V ̸= 0, and so the full
solution. For example, inside the rectangular region corresponding to 0 < x < a and 0 < y < b
with V (x, b) = V0(x), and V =0 on the other 3 sides,
V (x, y) =
∞
∑
n=0

and the boundary condition at y = b determines the coeﬃcients An in this Fourier sine series

other three sides. Then,

(2.55)

(2.57)
which is known as Legendre’s equation. This equation can be solved by a power series method,
and the series converges for −1 ≤cos θ ≤1 for integer values of α = ℓ≥0. Since Legendre’s
equation is 2nd order, there are two linearly-independent solutions for each value of α, of which
one is inﬁnite for cos θ = ±1.
The ﬁnite solutions are are called “Legendre polynomials”,
Pℓ(cos θ), and the ﬁrst 6 Legendre polynomials are
P0(cos θ) = 1,
(2.58)
P1(cos θ) = cos θ,
(2.59)

and are plotted in Fig. 2.8. Notice that Pℓ(cos θ) are normalised to 1 at cos θ = 1, and that
Pℓ(cos θ) is an even function if ℓis even, and an odd function if ℓis odd.

∑

(2.66)
The coeﬃcients in the series are obtained from the boundary conditions. If the region inside
the boundaries contains r = 0 then all Bℓwill be zero, but if the region inside the boundaries
contains r = ∞then (usually) all Aℓwill be zero. At the boundary (often a spherical surface
with radius r = a) where the potential is speciﬁed, we can use the orthogonality of Pℓ(cos θ)
to ﬁnd the coeﬃcients. Hence, for the region inside a spherical surface of radius r = a, where
V (a, cos θ) = V0(cos θ), we have

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Finite-difference method for Laplace's equation
Numerical ﬁnite-diﬀerence methods may be used when analytic methods are impractical. They
can be motivated by the equation of heat conduction in solids, which becomes Laplace’s equation
for heat-source free regions in equilibrium.
The equation of heat conduction in solids in a region where there are no heat sources is
∇2T = 1
α
∂T
∂t
(2.84)
where T(r, t) is the temperature and α is the thermal diﬀusivity. If the boundaries are held at
ﬁxed temperatures then for any initial temperature distribution the temperature distribution
evolves to a steady state at t →∞at which time
∇2T = 0,
(2.85)
which is Laplace’s equation.
By analogy, in electrostatics we can solve Laplace’s equation by numerically “evolving” an initial
potential in “time” to t →∞using
∂V
∂t = ∇2V,
(2.86)
or, in practice, until V (r) stops changing. The potential will then have “relaxed” to a steady-
state and obey Laplace’s equation. This equation does not represent the time-dependence of
V (r) — we are still discussing electrostatics !

(2.93)
The “time step” δt is arbitrary, and so we can choose whatever we like for it. The method is
simpliﬁed by setting δt = L2/4 (for 2D) or δt = L2/6 (for 3D), and so in 2D and 3D problems
the iteration procedure is simply
V n+1
i,j

i,j,k−1
)
.
(2.95)
Thus, for each iteration we replace the potential on each non-boundary grid point by the average
of the potentials at its nearest neighbours.
As an example, we solve the 2D problem of the potential inside a pipe of square cross section
(1 m by 1 m) where the potential is speciﬁed on each of the four sides: V (0, y, z)=0, V (1, y, z)=0,
V (x, 0, z)=0 and V (x, 1, z)=1 V. This is the same problem we used as an example for analytic
solution (Fig. 2.7).
We choose a grid spacing L=0.01 m, i.e. 100×100 cells (101×101 grid
points), and after each iteration reset the outer grid points to the potentials on the boundary
surfaces. At the two corners where V changes discontinuously from V =0 to V =1 V we set the
potential to be the average value, i.e. V (0, 1, z)=V (1, 1, z)=0.5 V. The result is contoured in
Fig. 2.10 after 100, 1000, and 10,000 iterations.
Since the information on the potential can propagate from one boundary to another at a rate no
faster than one cell per iteration, the number of iterations required to approach a steady-state
must be much larger than the maximum number of grid points in any coordinate direction (101
in this example). In the present example we see that the number of iterations required, ∼10,000,
exceeds this by a factor of 100. Because of the large number of iterations required, very eﬃcient
codes are needed, and should use array manipulation methods available in modern programming

Find the work done in bringing the charge from inﬁnity to its current location (a) by using
the method of images to ﬁnd the potential at the location of the real charge, and (b) by
considering the force on the charge as it is brought from inﬁnity.

a long parallel line charge +λ at distance d is identical to the potential of the line charge
and a parallel image line charge −λ at distance di from the cylinder’s axis towards the real
line charge (see diagram below). [Hint: draw lines to point P from the two line charges.
Use the cosine rule of triangles to write the two distances in terms of a, di, d and ϕ and use
the formula the for potential due to a line charge, and superposition, to write a formula
for the potential at P. Finally require that V does not change if ϕ changes.]

Point charge on z axis
Consider the potential due to a point charge q on the z axis a distance r′ from the origin
(Fig. 3.1a). We can obtain the expression for the potential V (r) for r > r′ as a solution of
Laplace’s equation in spherical coordinates with azimuthal symmetry. For this problem we can
use Coulomb’s law for the potential due to point charge as the boundary condition (Exercise 2–
8). The result is found to be
V (r, θ, ϕ) =
q

Since the monopole and dipole terms are zero, the quadrupole moment tensor is independent of
choice of origin. The potential calculated using the quadrupole moment is plotted in Fig. 3.2,
where it is compared with the potential calculated for the four charges directly using Coulomb’s
law. Another example of the quadrupole moment tensor is given in Exercise 3–4.

Electric dipoles
Electric dipoles are important because, as we shall see in the next chapter, when dielectrics are
subject to an electric ﬁeld they acquire an electric dipole moment. Also, oscillating dipoles are
eﬃcient radiators of electromagnetic waves, and are discussed in the 2nd book in this series
“Essential Electrodynamics”.

While a physical dipole comprises two charges, +q and −q, separated by distance d and has
dipole moment p = qd where d extends from −q to +q, a pure dipole can be thought of as a
physical dipole with dipole moment p = qd, with q = p/d, in the limit that d →0. Field lines
of a physical dipole and a pure dipole are shown in Fig. 3.3. If we were to zoom out so that the
scale was very much larger than the separation between the two point charges in part (a) the
two ﬁelds would then appear to be identical.

Learning objectives
—
To understand that dielectric materials when placed in an electric ﬁeld acquire an electric
dipole moment per unit volume described by the polarisation ﬁeld, and that this leads to
polarisation volume and surface charge densities.
—
To learn how Gauss’ law must be modiﬁed to include polarisation charges, and that it
may be written in terms of a new ﬁeld called the electric displacement.
—
To learn that for many dielectrics the polarisation is proportional to the electric ﬁeld
with the constant of proportionality being the electric susceptibility, and to learn how the
susceptibility is related to the permittivity.
—
To be able to calculate the capacitance of capacitors having a simple geometry.
—
To know and be able to apply the boundary conditions on the potential, electric ﬁeld and
displacement ﬁeld at an interface between two dielectrics.
—
To understand, on a microscopic level, the causes of polarisation, including the orien-
tational polarisability of polar molecules, electronic polarisability of non-polar molecules
and the ionic polarisability of crystals.
—
To know that the electric ﬁeld at the atomic scale responsible for aligning or stretching
atomic or molecular dipoles is diﬀerent to the macroscopic electric ﬁeld in the dielec-
tric, and that the Clausius-Mossotti formula accounts for this in relating the molecular
polarisability to the permittivity.
4.1
Dielectrics
Electrons in dielectrics or insulators are attached to speciﬁc atoms or molecules. This is very
diﬀerent to in conductors where some fraction of electrons are free to move throughout the
material. Some molecules have permanent electric dipoles. If an electric ﬁeld is applied to a
dielectric, molecules rotate or atoms become stretched, and the material becomes polarised. A
polarised material has a net dipole moment per unit volume called the polarisation ﬁeld, P(r)
(units: C m−2).

Figure 4.1 is a cartoon which attempts to illustrate how surface and volume polarisation charges
occur at an atomic level in a dielectric material. In Fig. 4.1(a) we show a microscopic rectangular
slab of dielectric of length L containing an array of atoms which have been stretched to form
tiny dipoles in the presence of an applied electric ﬁeld. The material is uniformly polarised,
with P(r) = P0x. On the right hand side of the dielectric σpol(L, y, z) = P · x = +P0 (positive
surface charge), whereas on the left hand side σpol(0, y, z) = P · (−x) = −P0 (negative surface
charge). There is no surface polarisation charge present on the top and bottom surfaces as
P · n = 0 there. Also, because P is uniform, ρpol(r) = −∇· P(r) = 0 and so there is no volume
polarisation charge either.
In Fig. 4.1(b) the dielectric has been polarised non-uniformly and in the rectangular slab shown
P(r) = (P0 + ax) x. There is still negative surface charge on the left hand side and positive
surface charge on the right hand side, but they have unequal magnitudes: σpol(0, y, z) = −P0
and σpol(L, y, z) = (P0 + aL). Inside the slab ∇· P(r) = a and so the polarisation volume
charge density is negative, ρpol(r) = −a. This can be expected as, although there are equal

than the positive charges (compare the two boxes in Fig. 4.1b) giving rise to a net volume
polarisation charge density which is negative. If the slab has cross-sectional area S, then the
total polarisation charge is qpol = S[(−P0) + (P0 + aL) + (−a × L)] = 0.

Capacitors
A capacitor is a device for storing charge, typically comprising two conductors separated from
each other by air or a dielectric, the simplest being the parallel plate capacitor comprising
two parallel conducting plates separated by a small gap. The potential diﬀerence between two
conductors, “a” and “b”, say, is

where σ(r) is the surface charge density on the conductors. If the charge on each conductor is
doubled, E is doubled and V must also be doubled, and so the charge stored q is proportional
to V . The constant of proportionality is the capacitance C, such that q = CV . The unit of
capacitance is the farad, and is named after Michael Faraday.
To charge a capacitor, you must transport electrons from the positive plate to the negative
plate. If the capacitor has charge q′, the potential diﬀerence is V = q′/C, and so the work done
to add a small additional charge dq′ to a capacitor which already stores charge q′ is
dW

A schematic diagram of a parallel plate capacitor is shown in Fig. 4.2(a) where the plate
separation is greatly exaggerated. The capacitance can be calculated as follows: (i) neglecting
fringing ﬁelds (bulging out around the edges of the plates) the electric ﬁeld is located solely
between the plates and is perpendicular to the plates, (ii) using Gauss’ law the surface charge
density is σ0 = ε0E, (iii) the total charge is
q = Sσ0 = Sε0E = Sε0

∴
C = Sε0
a .
(4.23)
If a dielectric is placed between the plates, E is unchanged (it depends only on V and a), but the
dielectric becomes polarised P = ε0χeE and acquires surface polarisation charge (see Fig. 4.2b)
σpol = P · n = χeε0E · n.
(4.24)
To keep E the same, more charge (shown in red) must ﬂow onto the plates to cancel the
polarisation charge such that
σ = (σ0 + σpol) = (ε0E + ε0χeE) = (1 + χe)ε0E = εE.

Boundary conditions on V , E and D
The boundary condition on V at the interface between two materials is simply that V must
be continuous across the interface; otherwise at the interface the electric ﬁeld would be inﬁnite
there.
To obtain the boundary conditions on E and D at the interface between two materials we split
up the problem into ﬁnding the conditions on the components normal to and parallel to the
interface. We obtain the boundary conditions on the normal components by applying Gauss’
law to an inﬁnitessimally-thin Gaussian pill-box spanning the interface between two materials
as in Fig. 4.3(a). Since both the surface polarisation charge and the free surface charge will
enter into Gauss’ law for E, whereas only the free surface charge enters into Gauss’ law for D,
the boundary condition on the normal component of D is much more useful. Then,
∮

D(r) · n dS = Qf, encl,
D1 · n1S1 + D2 · n2S2 = S1 σf.
(4.26)
∴
(D1 −D2) · n1 = σf,
(4.27)
since S2 = S1, and so the normal component of D is unchanged across the interface between
two materials, unless there is free surface charge on the boundary.

Microscopic dielectric theory
In the presence of an electric ﬁeld, atoms become stretched or molecules rotate thereby acquiring
on average a dipole moment p = αpolE where αpol is the polarisability.
4.5.1
Orientational polarisability of polar molecules
Molecules having a permanent electric dipole are called polar molecules. A common example
is the water molecule illustrated in Fig. 4.4(a), but there are many other examples including
carbon monoxide and ozone. In the presence of a uniform electric ﬁeld the net force on an
electric dipole is zero, but a permanent electric dipole such as a water molecule will experience
a torque tending to align its dipole moment with the electric ﬁeld (Fig. 4.4b),
N =
(L
2
)
× (qE) +
(
−L
2
)
× (−qE) = qL × E,
∴
N = p × E.
(4.31)
At a ﬁnite temperature, collisions with other molecules regularly mis-align individual molecules
such that, on average, only partial alignment is maintained.
The lowest energy state of a polar molecule in an electric ﬁeld corresponds to when p is aligned
parallel to E, and the work done to rotate p so that it is oriented at angle θ to the electric ﬁeld

Ionic polarisability of crystals
Consider a tiny piece of a salt crystal sketched in Fig. 4.7(a) comprising Na+ and Cl−ions in
a face-centred cubic structure. In the absence of an applied electric ﬁeld the crystal has zero
net dipole moment. Within the crystal, physical dipoles are associated with pairs of Na+ and
Cl−ions but they cancel out over the volume of the crystal as shown (there are equal numbers
of dipoles pointing to the left as there are to the right). This might look a bit suspicious, as
you could draw all the dipoles to point to the right as in Fig. 4.7(b). However, for this rather

rise to an overall polarisation in the direction of the applied ﬁeld. Usually for crystals (NaCl is
an exception) the direction of E relative to crystal planes matters, and p is related to E by the
polarisability tensor, rather than the (scaler) polarisability.

Clausius-Mossotti formula
In an amorphous substance made of non-polar molecules, or an isotropic crystal such as NaCl,
placed in an external electric ﬁeld Eext a molecule located at rmol will acquire an induced dipole
moment
p = αpolEmicro(rmol)
(4.39)
where Emicro(rmol) is the microscopic electric ﬁeld at the location of the molecule.
In a slab of dielectric in a uniform external electric ﬁeld Eext, perpendicular to the slab, the
macroscopic ﬁeld inside the slab will be
Emacro = ε0
ε Eext.
(4.40)
But this is not the electric ﬁeld we need for Eq. 4.39 — we need the ﬁeld that would be at rmol
if the molecule weren’t there.
For amorphous substances we can approximate the microscopic electric ﬁeld by the ﬁeld at the
centre of a spherical hole of radius a and volume ∼1/N surrounding the molecule, where N is
the number density of molecules (Fig. 4.8). At the centre of the hole, “O”, we need to add the
ﬁeld due to the surface polarisation charge of density σpol(θ) on the surface S of the hole,

Magnetism
Magnets have been known since antiquity – pieces of lodestone (magnetised magnetite Fe3O4)
attract pieces of iron, and when suspended freely point to the magnetic North Pole. Magnetite is
a ferromagnetic mineral which became magnetised by strong magnetic ﬁelds, possibly associated
with lightning strike. Compasses were invented in China in the 2nd Century B.C. and were
being used by European navigators by the 12th Century A.D. A compass points in the direction
of the magnetic ﬁeld.

Magnetic field and vector potential
Magnetic ﬁelds occur throughout the Universe – the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is probably produced
by electrical currents associated with magnetohydrodynamic ﬂows within the Earth’s core.
Similarly, the Sun and the stars have magnetic ﬁelds, pulsars being extreme examples, with
some varieties known as magnetars having ﬁelds as high as 1014 times that on the Earth’s
surface. Magnetic ﬁelds also pervade the Solar System, interstellar space and, at some level,
everywhere in the Universe with the possible exception of giant voids in cosmic structure.
Apart from permanent magnets, the main sources of magnetic ﬁelds are electrical currents. In
the case of a current along a long straight wire, the magnetic ﬁeld circulates around the current
as shown in Fig. 5.1(a). The unit of magnetic ﬁeld, B, is the tesla (T) which is named after
Serbian-American electrical engineer Nicola Tesla (1856–1943).
5.2
The magnetic field and forces
As well as producing magnetic ﬁelds, electrical currents experience a force in the presence of
a magnetic ﬁeld. For example, the current in one wire produces a magnetic ﬁeld which causes
the current in another wire to experience a force. Historically, this magnetic force between two
wires carrying currents was investigated in the 1820’s and 1830’s by Gauss and French physicist
André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836). A formulation giving the force on a particle with charge Q
moving with velocity v through an electric ﬁeld E and magnetic ﬁeld B is the Lorentz force
(see Fig. 5.1b),
F = Q(E + v × B),
(5.1)
named after Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1853–1928), of Lorentz transformation
fame.
5.2.1
Forces on currents
We can consider the force between two parallel wires using the Lorentz force law as in Fig. 5.1(c).
We deﬁne a line current I as the net charge per unit time ﬂowing along a ﬁlamentary wire, and
so the net charge ﬂowing past some point in time dt is dQ = Idt. The unit of current is the
amp (A) and is named after Ampère. Note that 1 A = 1 C s−1.
If the eﬀective current ﬂow speed is v then charge dQ is located over length dr = v dt of wire,

This is one version of Ampère’s force law.
Currents can also ﬂow across a surface as “current sheets” and are described by the surface
current density K (amps per metre). Currents ﬂowing through a volume are described by the
volume current density J (amps per square metre).
The latter two cases are illustrated in

develops perpendicular to the current direction. This phenomena, due to the Lorentz force on
electrons or holes carrying the current, is called the Hall eﬀect. The geometry for calculating
the Hall voltage is shown in Fig. 5.3.
Note that the direction of the current I in the diagram is that of the conventional current, so
that the motion of electrons is in the opposite direction. The current is
I = J h d = (nc q v) h d,
(5.5)
where J is the current density, nc the number density of charge carriers of change q, and v their
eﬀective velocity. The Lorentz force qv × B acts on the charge carriers deﬂecting them towards

In equilibrium, the Lorentz force of magnitude qvB is opposed by the electrostatic force of

The ratio of the Hall voltage to the product of the current and the magnetic ﬁeld divided by
the element thickness is known as the Hall coeﬃcient,
RH =

(5.7)
It is a characteristic of the material from which the semiconductor is made, as its value depends
on the type, number and properties of the charge carriers: electrons in a conductor (q = −e),
electrons in a “n-type semiconductor” (q = −e), and holes which act like positive electrons in
a “p-type semiconductor” (q = +e).
The Hall eﬀect can be used to measure magnetic ﬁelds with a “Hall probe”. The quantum
Hall eﬀect which occurs for a two-dimensional electron gas in high magnetic ﬁelds and low
temperatures was discovered by in 1980 by Klaus von Klitzing (b. 1943) and has led to a new
standard for measurement of electrical resistance.

The magnetic vector potential
From Biot and Savart’s law we can ﬁnd a potential which is a vector ﬁeld, called the magnetic
vector potential A(r), from which we can obtain the magnetic ﬁeld B(r) in an analogous (but
diﬀerent) way to obtaining the electric ﬁeld from the electrostatic potential. We start with the
Biot-Savart law, and use an identity for ∇R−1 (Eq. B.7),

Exercise 5–2 is to use Eq. 5.21 to ﬁnd the vector potential of an inﬁnite straight wire along the
z axis carrying current I, although we can actually ﬁnd this in a simpler way from the magnetic
ﬁeld which we know to be µ0I/2πρ ϕ (Eq. 5.16), and we will do so now.

Exercise 5–3 is to show that
∇· A(r) = ∇2U(r).
(5.27)
The “gauge” is determined by the value of ∇· A, and in magnetostatics, it is convenient to
choose ∇· A = 0 (Coulomb gauge).

Note that in the last line the Laplacian operator has moved to the right of J(r′) because the

which is Ampère’s law in diﬀerential form. We can use Stokes’ theorem (Appendix C.6) to ﬁnd
Ampère’s law also in integral form

Ampère’s law in integral form can be exploited in a similar way to Gauss’ law in integral form if
the symmetry of problem allows. An “Ampèrian loop” plays an equivalent role to the “Gaussian
surface” when using Gauss law. As an example, consider the magnetic ﬁeld of a long straight
wire carrying current I. There is cylindrical symmetry, and we can for convenience deﬁne the
z axis to be along the wire. Then the magnitude of the ﬁeld must depend only on cylindrical
coordinate ρ and the ﬁeld must be in the ϕ direction as in Fig. 5.1(a).

Magnetic field and vector potential
Another example is the long solenoid as depicted in Fig. 5.7(b). For a circular Ampèrian loop Γ1
concentric with the axis, Iencl = I if Γ1 is outside the solenoid (ρ1 > a), and Iencl = 0 if it is inside
(ρ1 < a). Hence, outside the solenoid, the azimuthal component is Bϕ(ρ > a, ϕ, z) = µ0I/2πρ,
whereas inside Bϕ(ρ < a, ϕ, z) = 0. It is widely stated that the magnetic ﬁeld outside a long
solenoid is zero, which appears to contradict this result. It is true that the magnetic ﬁeld outside
is very much less than inside, and one can design a solenoid with B = 0 outside by having a
double coil with current ﬂowing out in the +z direction in one coil, and back in the −z direction
in the other, such that the net current through the circular loop Γ1 is zero.
From the symmetry of the problem, if there were a component of B in the ρ direction it would be
the same everywhere over the surface of a concentric cylinder, and this would give
∮
B · dS ̸= 0
which is not allowed if, as it appears, magnetic charge doesn’t exist (as is discussed in the next
section). We have already found Bϕ inside and outside the cylinder, so now we examine Bz
using rectangular Amperian loop Γ2 with two sides parallel to the solenoid’s axis, one of which
is inside the solenoid. The current enclosed is Iencl = NI, for all ρ2 values, so that Ampère’s
law implies that BzL, and thus Bz, is the same for all ρ > a. But Bz(ρ = ∞, ϕ, z) must be zero,
so that Bz(ρ > a) = 0. Similar arguments show that Bz(ρ < a, ϕ, z) = B0, i.e. Bz is constant
inside the solenoid. Ampère’s law for loop Γ2 is then
∮
B · dr = µ0Iencl,
BzL = µ0NI,
(5.38)
giving
B(ρ, ϕ, z) =
{
µ0nI z

outside solenoid (usually neglected)
(5.39)
where n = N/L is the number of coils (or “turns”) per unit length.

∇× A(r) · dS,
(5.40)

Magnetic field and vector potential
and using Stokes’ theorem we ﬁnd that
ΦB =
∮
Γ
A(r) · dr
(5.41)
where loop Γ bounds surface S. This result is very useful for ﬁnding the vector potential from
the magnetic ﬁeld in cases where we can exploit the symmetry of the problem, in a similar way
to ﬁnding the magnetic ﬁeld from the current density using Ampère’s law.
We shall now use Eq. 5.41 to ﬁnd the vector potential due to current I ﬂowing in a long solenoid
(Fig. 5.7b). From Eq. 5.21, one expects there to be a z component of A outside the solenoid due
to the net current I ﬂowing along the solenoid, but we will neglect this here. Since the current
in the solenoid circulates in the ϕ direction, from symmetry arguments we should expect that
A will have a ϕ component. Applying Eq. 5.41 to loop Γ1 for a solenoid of radius a as shown,
2πρ1Aϕ(ρ1, ϕ, z) =
{
πρ2
1µ0nI
inside solenoid (ρ1 < a),
πa2µ0nI
outside solenoid (ρ1 > a).
(5.42)
Hence,
A(ρ, ϕ, z) =
{
(µ0nIρ/2)ϕ
inside solenoid (ρ < a),
(µ0nIa2/2ρ)ϕ
outside solenoid (ρ > a).
(5.43)
5.5.1
No magnetic charge law
We can derive this very important law from
B(r) = ∇× A(r),
(5.44)
and then using the second-derivative rule ∇· (∇× c) = 0 we obtain,
∇· B = 0.
(5.45)
Comparing this with Gauss’ law in diﬀerential form ∇· E = ρ/ε0 we see that Eq 5.45 implies
that magnetic charge does not exist. Some particle theories predict the existence of massive
magnetic monopoles, but so far none have been found. Magnetic dipoles do exist however, and

are very important in discussing magnetic materials.
As we shall see later in this chapter, Eq 5.45 given in integral form below (as can be found by
applying Gauss’ theorem to the diﬀerential form),
∮
B · dS = 0,
(5.46)
is important in determining the boundary condition on B between two materials.
5.5.2
Mutual inductance
A current ﬂowing around a loop of wire (e.g. Coil 1 in Fig. 5.8) produces a magnetic ﬁeld, and
some of the ﬁeld lines may pass through a second loop of wire (e.g. Coil 2). If we double the
current I1 the magnetic ﬁeld will double, as will the number of ﬁeld lines through Coil 2. The
way to quantify this threading of Coil 1’s ﬁeld through Coil 2 is by the mutual inductance M
deﬁned as the magnetic ﬂux through Coil 2 due to current I1, divided by I1

note that M only depends on the geometry (separation, shapes and sizes) of the two coils. The

Consider the current loop in the x–y plane shown in Fig. 5.9(a). The cross product of the two
vectors r ′ and dr ′ generates a parallelogram of area |r ′ × dr ′|, with half its area corresponding

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Magnetic field and vector potential
5.6.1
Dipole magnetic field
The magnetic ﬁeld of a magnetic dipole resembles the electric ﬁeld of an electric dipole (Fig. 3.3).
The Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld outside the Earth’s surface can be approximated by that of a dipole
of moment |m| = 8.2 × 1022 A m2 at the centre of the Earth (Fig. 5.9b). The dipole moment
m is directed at an angle of about 168.5◦to Earth’s spin direction, so that the “real” magnetic
North Pole is actually 11.5◦from the geographic South Pole! The magnetic ﬁeld of a bar magnet
is sketched in Fig. 5.9(c) showing the magnet’s north and south poles – by convention magnetic
ﬁeld lines leave the magnet at its north pole and enter the magnet at its south pole.
We derive the magnetic ﬁeld of a dipole here using vector identities. A derivation using index
notation is carried out in Exercise 5–7. Taking the curl of the vector potential in Eq. 5.55,
B(r) = µ0
4π∇×
(
m × r
r3
)
.
(5.60)
Using the product rule for the curl of a cross product,
∇× (a × b) = (∇· b)a −(∇· a)b + (b · ∇)a −(a · ∇)b,
(5.61)
we have

(5.63)
where we have used ∇· (r/r3) = 0 (r > 0) for the 1st term, and that m is a constant vector in
the 2nd and 3rd terms on the right. Then

(5.71)
This has identical form to the electric ﬁeld due to electric dipole of moment p (Eq. 3.19).

Torques on magnetic dipoles
The net force on a current loop (or dipole) in a magnetic ﬁeld is
Fmag = I
∮
(dr × B),
(5.72)
which for a uniform magnetic ﬁeld is
Fmag = I
(∮
dr
)
× B = 0,
because
∮
dr = 0.
(5.73)
Although there is no net force, a dipole does experience a torque tending to align its dipole
moment with the magnetic ﬁeld direction. To ﬁnd the value of the torque consider a rectangular
current loop, with sides of length a and c, carrying current I in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld as shown

of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld (a) looking in the y direction, and (b) looking in the −x direction.
From Fig. 5.10(a), we see the top and bottom sections of the loop are perpendicular to B, and so
FT = −IcB x and FB = IcB x = −FT and these two forces cancel each other. Similarly, looking
at Fig. 5.10(b), we see that the forces on the left and right sections are FL = −Ia sin(π −θ)B y
and FR = Ia sin(π −θ)B y = −FL, and so also cancel each other such that the net force is zero
in agreement with Eq. 5.73.

Magnetic field and vector potential
From Fig. 5.10(a), we see that there will be a torque on the current loop due to forces FT and
FB equal to N = −|FT|a sin θ y = −IacB sin θ y, and this tends to align m parallel to B. Given
that B = B z and m = Iac(cos θ z + sin θ x) we ﬁnd that
N = m × B.
(5.74)
Such current loops in a magnetic ﬁeld form the basic design of the galvanometer at the heart of
all analogue current, voltage or charge measuring devices (Fig. 5.11), and also electric motors.
Similarly, these torques also tend to align electron magnetic moments (associated with spin)
parallel to B causing paramagnetism, to be discussed in the next chapter.

Figure 5.11: A simple galvanometer to measure current I has coils through which the current
ﬂows, a permanent magnet with shaped pieces to provide the same ﬁeld conﬁguration with
respect to the coils at all deﬂection angles, a spring to provide a torque to balance the torque
on the magnetic moment of the current through the coils, and a needle pointer.
To rotate the dipole moment, work must be done against the torque, and so the potential energy
of a dipole in a magnetic ﬁeld is

(5.76)
where, for convenience, we have chosen the reference angle to be θref = π/2.
As an aside, although for a uniform magnetic ﬁeld there is no net force on a magnetic dipole,
in a non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld there is. The force on the dipole is
F = −∇W = ∇(m · B).

If the dipole is aligned with B, it will experience a force in the direction of increasing B.
Actually, the result in Eq. 5.77 glosses over a number of issues including whether the dipole
is due to a current loop, electron orbital motion or spin. Nevertheless, Eq. 5.77 explains why
paramagnets and ferromagnets are attracted to strong magnetic ﬁelds whereas diamagnets are
repelled.

the vector potential of an inﬁnite straight wire along the z axis carrying current I.
5–3 We can add the gradient of a scalar ﬁeld U(r) to A(r) without changing B(r). This is

Magnetism of materials
Learning objectives
—
To learn that a material placed in a magnetic ﬁeld acquires a magnetic dipole moment
per unit volume described by the magnetisation ﬁeld, and that magnetisation results in
surface and volume magnetisation currents.
—
To be able to calculate the magnetisation currents, magnetic ﬁeld and the magnetic dipole
moment of a permanently magnetised object.
—
To understand that the magnetisation currents must be added to any free currents present
when applying Ampère’s law, and that this leads to the introduction of a new ﬁeld H.
—
To be able to apply the boundary conditions on B and H at an interface between two
materials.
—
To learn that for many materials the magnetisation is proportional to H, with the con-
stant of proportionality being the magnetic susceptibility, which in turn is related to the
permeability.
—
To understand the causes of paramagnetism, and how a semi-classical treatment leads to
Curie’s law.
—
To understand the causes of ferromagnetism, and that it requires no applied magnetic
ﬁeld to sustain it.
—
To know how the magnetisation of a ferromagnetic material changes with applied magnetic
ﬁeld or H, and to be able to calculate the work done as a ferromagnetic material is brought
around a hysteresis loop.
—
To understand the concept of magnetic circuits, and to be able to calculate magnetic ﬁelds
in simple magnetic circuits.
6.1
Magnetic materials
While in an external magnetic ﬁeld, a paramagnetic substance becomes magnetised with a
net dipole moment parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld. Paramagnetism occurs if, for a particular
substance, the atomic electrons have unpaired spin allowing the electron magnetic moments

Magnetism of materials
of those unpaired electrons to experience a torque aligning them with B. Ferromagnetism is
due to the quantum mechanical exchange interaction causing long-range ordering of electron
spins within a “domain” — a concentration of aligned magnetic dipoles. If a material is neither
paramagnetic nor ferromagnetic, it will show (usually weak) diamagnetism. This is due to the
eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld acting on orbiting electrons and changing the magnetic moment
associated with their orbital motion in such a way that the net dipole moment becomes anti-
parallel with B. Diamagnetism occurs for all atoms, but in paramagnetic and ferromagnetic
materials is masked by the typically stronger paramagnetism and ferromagnetism.
6.2
Magnetisation field
In the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld matter becomes magnetised in an analogous way to that in
which matter becomes polarised in the presence of an electric ﬁeld. Magnetic dipole moments
due to electron spin or orbital motion get partially or fully lined up in some direction giving
the material a net magnetic dipole moment. To describe this we deﬁne the magnetisation ﬁeld
M(r) in a similar way to the polarisation ﬁeld in electrostatics, namely the magnetisation ﬁeld
is deﬁned as the magnetic dipole moment per unit volume. The magnetisation ﬁeld M has
units of magnetic dipole moment (A m2) divided by those of volume (m3), i.e. its units are (A
m−1). In the same way that in electrostatics the electric ﬁeld of a polarised object is identical
to that due to its polarisation charges, the magnetic ﬁeld of a magnetised object is identical to
that of its magnetisation currents, also known as “bound currents”.
6.3
Magnetisation currents and Ampère's law
The vector potentials of a magnetic dipole with moment m at the origin, of a magnetic dipole
with moment m located at r′, and of a magnetised object are given by

where, as usual, R = r −r′.
To derive the magnetisation currents of a magnetised object we will need the following: an
identity for ∇′R−1, the product rule for ∇× (aF), and a corollary to Gauss’ Theorem, all
of which are obtained in Exercise 6–1. The derivation of magnetisation currents proceeds as

Hence, the ﬁeld of a magnetised object is the same as would be produced by “magnetisation
currents”
Jmag(r) = ∇× M(r)
(volume),
Kmag(r) = M(r) × n
(surface).
(6.7)
To visualise these magnetisation currents, consider a rectangular block of material uniformly
magnetised in the −x direction as in Fig. 6.1(a). We can imagine the magnetisation ﬁeld as
being due to the tiny current loops shown. If M is constant throughout the material then each
of these ﬁctitious current loops carries an identical current, such that inside the material the
current on one side of a loop is in the opposite direction to the current on the nearest side of an
adjacent loop and cancels it out (see inset in Fig. 6.1a). So, Jmag(r) = 0 inside the uniformly
magnetised material, as it must be since ∇× M = 0.
There is no magnetisation surface current density in the surfaces perpendicular to M (with
darker shading), i.e. parallel to the yz plane in Fig. 6.1(a), because M × n = 0 there. However,

for the loops which have one side next to the surface, the currents on that side of the loops have
no opposing currents to cancel with. The result is a magnetisation surface current Kmag(r) =

Magnetism of materials
If M varies with position inside the material, as well as the surface magnetisation currents
there will also be a volume magnetisation current density provided ∇× M(r) ̸= 0.
One
example is is shown in Fig. 6.1(b) where M(r) depends only on y and varies linearly with y,
i.e. M(r) = Mx(y) x = −(M0 + ay) x such that J(r) = ∇× M(r) = −dMx/dy z = az. The
resulting surface and volume current densities are illustrated in Fig. 6.1(c) where on the top
surface Kmag(r) = Mx(y) y which varies with position, while on the sides parallel to the x–z
plane the magnetisation surface current densities are constant with the values Kmag(x, 0, z) =
−Mx(0)z = M0 z and Kmag(x, d, z) = Mx(d)z = −(M0 + ad)z.
6.3.1
Cylindrical magnets
As an example of magnetisation currents, we consider a permanent magnet in the form of a
short cylinder with uniform magnetisation M along its axis as in Fig. 6.2(a). The magnetisation
surface current Kmag(r) = M(r) × n is zero on the two ends, but on the cylindrical surface
Kmag(r) = M ϕ (Fig. 6.2b). This surface magnetisation current distribution would give an
identical magnetic ﬁeld to a free surface current density K = nI ϕ where I = M/n is the
current in a tightly-wound solenoid of the same size as the magnet (Fig. 6.2b), and n is the
number of turns per metre.

to its axis, and (b) a solenoid of identical size with n coils per unit length and carrying current

Ampère's law in magnetised materials
For magnetic materials we must include Jmag as well as the “free current” Jf, i.e. J used
previously must be replaced by the total current density as free currents and magnetisation
currents are equally good at producing magnetic ﬁelds. Hence,
∇× B
=
µ0(Jf + Jmag)
=
µ0(Jf + ∇× M).
(6.8)
Hence, Ampère’s law in magnetised materials is
∇× H = Jf,
where
H = B

(6.9)
H is sometimes called magnetic intensity but more often simply “H”. It has units A m−1. Using
Stokes’ theorem we obtain Ampère’s law in integral form

H · dr = If, encl,
(6.10)
where If, encl is the free current enclosed by loop Γ.
6.4.1
Boundary Conditions on B and H
We obtain these boundary conditions from the no-magnetic-charge law and Ampère’s law in
integral form.
Consider the Gaussian pillbox shown in Fig. 6.3(a) but with inﬁnitesimally
narrow sides. The surface integral of B over the pillbox with identical top and bottom surface
areas S1 = S2 is given by
∮
S

(B1 · n1S1 + B2 · n2S2) = 0.

Magnetic susceptibility and permeability
For linear materials, M = χMH where χM is the magnetic volume susceptibility, and so
B = µ0(H + M) = µ0(1 + χM)H = µH
(6.16)
where µ is the permeability of the material, and µ0 is the permeability of free space. Since the
magnetic dipoles are at the atomic/molecular level, with M depending on the number density
of atoms/molecules (which varies by orders of magnitude between gases and solids), it makes
sense when comparing the magnetic properties of materials to divide the magnetic volume
susceptibility by the density. This quantity, called the magnetic mass susceptibility is tabulated
in Table 6.1 for several elements, compounds and substances.

Paramagnetism
Pierre Curie discovered that for ordinary temperatures and magnetic ﬁelds paramagnetic ma-
terials obey χM ≡(M/H) ∝1/T. Paramagnetism is analogous to orientational polarisability
of permanent molecular electric dipoles. Magnetic torques on atomic dipole moments cause
paramagnetism, and it is the magnetic moments associated with unpaired spin that are respon-
sible. Unpaired electron spin will occur where there is an unﬁlled atomic sub-shell. However,
in metals only those electrons with energies near the Fermi energy can respond in this way and
so paramagnetism in metals is weak and does not follow the Curie law.
For a particle of mass Mp and charge q in a circular orbit of radius R with speed v (Fig. 5.4)
the magnitudes of the magnetic dipole moment mdip and angular momentum L are
mdip = 1
2qvR,
and
L = MpvR,
(6.17)
where the dipole moment is the product of the current (q divided by orbital period 2πR/v) and
the area of the orbit (πR2). The gyromagnetic ratio is deﬁned as
mdip
L
=
q
2Mp
,
and
mdip = qL
2Mp
.
(6.18)
For atoms we need to take account of quantum mechanics, in which the quantum of angular
momentum is ℏ≡h/2π where h is Planck’s constant. The natural unit of mdip is therefore the
“Bohr magneton”
µB = e ℏ
2me
.
(6.19)
The total angular momentum J = L+S is the sum of the orbital angular momentum of electrons
and their spin. For B = B z the quantum number M for the z-component of J is relevant here,
such that the z-component of the magnetic dipole moment mdip is
mdip,z =
−gJµBM,
gJ = 1 + J(J + 1) + S(S + 1) −L(L + 1)
2J(J + 1)
,
(6.20)
where gJ is the “Landé g-factor”. Note that if L = 0 (no orbital angular momentum) then
J = S and gJ = 2 for electron spin, and that if S = 0 (no spin angular momentum) then J = L
and gJ = 1 for electron orbital angular momentum.

Magnetism of materials
As an aside, the Zeeman eﬀect is the atomic energy-level splitting in a magnetic ﬁeld
∆E = −mdip · B = +gJµBMB
(6.21)
and this provides an important method for radio astronomers to determine the magnetic ﬁeld
present in some astrophysical sources.
6.6.1
Derivation of susceptibility
Paramagnetism is due to partial alignment of permanent atomic magnetic dipoles. For a full
treatment, a quantum statistical mechanical approach is required, taking account of the quan-
tum numbers for total angular momentum J, orbital angular momentum L, and spin S. How-
ever, the problem is simpliﬁed for the case atoms with zero orbital angular momentum, as we
then have gJ = 2 and only two possible spin states Ms = ± 1

dipole moments are

Using the Boltzmann distribution, for temperature T the probabilities of the electron magnetic

Ferromagnetism
Ferromagnetism is non-linear, and no external ﬁelds are needed to keep a ferromagnet magne-
tised. Ferromagnetism is due to long-range ordering of unpaired electron spins causing then to
line up parallel to each other. Anti-ferromagnetism is similar, except that neighbouring dipoles
point in opposite directions. Ferrimagnetism has oppositely pointing neighbouring dipoles of

in Fig. 6.4.

Figure 6.4: Arrangement of dipoles in crystal lattice planes of ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic
and ferrimagnetic materials.
Alignment occurs in microscopic “domains” with the magnetisation direction of each domain
usually being random, and giving an overall unmagnetised state. When placed in an external
magnetic ﬁeld, domains with magnetisation aligned partially with B grow at the expense of less
favourably aligned ones so that the average magnetisation is in the direction of B. Torques N =
m × B try to align individual dipoles with B, but they like to stay parallel to their neighbours,
and a lot of work is needed to shift the domain boundaries to achieve greater alignment. For
ferromagnetic materials, the magnetic ﬁeld BM = µ0M due to the resulting magnetisation M is
typically much larger than the applied ﬁeld B0 = µ0H. In ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism
the material becomes paramagnetic above a critical temperature at which a phase transition
occurs called the Curie temperature (after Pierre Curie) and in anti-ferromagnetism above the
Néel temperature (after French physicist Louis Néel 1904–2000). Practical applications of this
phase transition occur in electro-optical devices and hard disk drives when heat is used to erase
and write data.
Typically one would examine the magnetic properties of a ferromagnetic material by placing
the sample inside a solenoid and varying the current (and consequently H) sinusoidally, often
at mains frequency (50 Hz or 60 Hz), and displaying BM vs. H on an oscilloscope or computer
screen. An example is shown in Fig. 6.5(a) for a magnetically-soft iron-based amorphous alloy.
What is found is that BM remains positive even when H returns to zero following its maximum
positive value, and that BM reaches zero only after a time lag when H is suﬃciently negative.
Provided Hmax is not too large BM vs. H is approximately linear. Such a material would be
used mainly for magnetic cores in transformers. For larger applied ﬁelds, M saturates when all
domains having spins partially aligned with H have grown as much as is possible.
This type of non-reversible process is called hysteresis. To bring the sample through one cycle
of the “hysteresis loop” work must be done per unit volume of the ferromagnetic material equal

has “low hysteresis” (area of hysteresis loop is small), and is termed “magnetically soft” (good
for magnetic cores for transformers and for electromagnets), or one which has “high hysteresis”
and is termed “magnetically hard” (good for permanent magnets), or one which has the right
shape of the hysteresis loop for the job in question.
The hysteresis loop of a magnetic material is characterised by its remanence BR (T), its coerciv-
ity HC (A m−1) and its saturation BS (T), and these three quantities are labelled in Fig. 6.5(a).
For this particular amorphous alloy: BR = 0.1 T, HC = 10 A m−1 and BS = 1 T. Again, de-
pending on the application, the shape of the hysteresis loop is important – it depends not only
on the material but also on whether it has been annealed, i.e. heated and cooled in the presence
of a magnetic ﬁeld aligned in a particular direction. An example of a hysteresis loop with a
very diﬀerent shape to that of the magnetically-soft amorphous alloy is shown in Fig. 6.5(b),
in this case for a magnetically hard alloy of iron, aluminium, nickel and cobalt ”Alnico”, which
would be used for permanent magnets.
A recent development allows us to image ferromagnetic domains using scanning electron micro-
scopes (SEM). These microscopes work by having a beam of keV to multi-keV energy electrons
scan across the surface of the electrically conducting sample in a raster scan pattern. If the
object is non-conducting it must be coated with a thin layer of a good conductor such as gold.
Some of the scanning electrons are absorbed and the resulting current depends on the local
surface height and material properties, and is used to construct an image of the surface which
is displayed on a computer screen. Electrons scattered oﬀthe surface can also be collected in
real-time, as can X-rays emitted as a result of the surface bombardment, and are also used in
construction of the image in some SEMs.
Recently, a detector was developed to collect and analyse the spin state of the scattered elec-
trons, which in turn depends on the magnetisation direction of the patch of surface being
imaged. This scanning electron microscope with polarisation analysis (SEMPA) technique en-
ables images of the domain structure on the surface of a ferromagnetic material to be made.
Figure 6.6 shows images of magnetic domains and domain wall dynamics in Metglas® ribbons.
SEMPA measurements of the magnetic domains are shown at four points on the hysteresis loop
(centre) showing the magnetic state corresponding to each image.

Magnetic circuits
Consider two rods made of plastic, each of which is heated in order to bend it into a horseshoe
shape. The two plastic horseshoes are placed end-to-end almost touching but leaving two short
air gaps between them. Wires are wrapped around part of one of the horseshoes to form a
short solenoid as shown in Fig. 6.7(a). A current passing through the solenoid will produce a
magnetic ﬁeld which, because the magnetic susceptibility of plastic is tiny, will be only slightly
diﬀerent to the ﬁeld the solenoid would produce in air.

ferrite core will be dramatically diﬀerent to that in the plastic horseshoes as can be shown
using the boundary condition on H at the boundary between the ferrite core material and the
air. Since there are no free surface currents in the ferrite, the component of H parallel to the
surface, H∥, must be continuous across the boundary between ferrite and air

Hence, B∥

air as µferrite ≫µ0, and the magnetic ﬁeld will be largely conﬁned to the
ferrite core, with the ﬁeld lines making loops as shown. Using the boundary condition on the
normal component of B, the magnetic ﬁeld in the two air gaps between the two horseshoes
must be unchanged across the boundaries as the air gap surfaces are normal to B inside the
ferrite core.
As the ferrite core eﬀectively channels the magnetic ﬁeld, eﬀectively we have a magnetic circuit.
As an example, we shall calculate the magnetic ﬁeld in the air gaps for a permeability of
µ1 = 5, 000µ0 for the horseshoe on the left and µ2 = 3, 000µ0 for the horseshoe on the right –
strictly speaking ferromagnetic materials are non-linear, but we shall assume these values apply
to initial magnetisation before the ﬁeld saturates. The other values we shall use in this example
are I = 0.2 A, N = 50, the lengths around the two horseshoes being L1 = 30 cm and L2 = 20

Ferromagnetism
—
Ferromagnets are non-linear due to long-range ordering causing unpaired electron spins
to line up parallel with each other.
—
Alignment occurs in microscopic domains with the direction of M in each domain being
random, and giving overall unmagnetised state.
—
When a magnetic ﬁeld is applied, torques N = m × B try to align individual dipoles with
the applied ﬁeld.
—
Work is done to shift the domain boundaries to cause overall magnetisation.
—
This non-reversible process is called hysteresis – a plot of BM vs. applied H shows the
hysteresis loop.
—
The area of the loop gives the work done to take the sample around one cycle of the loop.

Due to limited space available in this series, it is not possible to go into the material in great
depth, so I have attempted to encapsulate what I consider to be the essentials of electrostatics
and magnetism. In a separate volume to be published by Ventus Publishing ApS, “Essential
Electrodynamics”, I cover in similar depth Maxwell’s equations, electromagnetic waves and
radiation. Both books contain student exercises, and I give the solutions to these exercises in
separate volumes also to be published by Ventus: “Essential Electromagnetism - Solutions” and
“Essential Electrodynamics - Solutions”.
My aim with the present book is not to replace existing textbooks in these subjects of which
there are many excellent examples, but rather to supplement the textbook speciﬁed by the
professor teaching the course — I have always found the need to read about a particular topic in
at least two books to improve my understanding. Nevertheless, if appropriately supplemented,
this book together with “Essential Electrodynamics” could serve as a textbook for 2nd and 3rd
year electromagnetism courses at Australian and British universities, or for junior/senior level
electromagnetism courses at American universities/colleges.
A few of the books that I found helpful over many years of teaching electromagnetism are listed

Vectors
Vectors have both a magnitude and a direction. In print they are represented by a letter in
bolface type, e.g. the magnetisation might be written M, or by an arrow over the symbol when
handwritten, e.g. −→
M. In three-dimensional space we can have vectors such as the velocity of a
particle at time t, say v(t), and vector ﬁelds such as the ﬂow velocity within a ﬂuid v(x, y, z, t)
at position (x, y, z) at time t. One can also have scalars such as the charge q of a particle, and
scalar ﬁelds such as charge density ρ(x, y, z, t) at position (x, y, z) at time t. What scalars and
scalar ﬁelds have in common is that they have just one component (it takes only one number
to deﬁne them), whereas both vectors and vector ﬁelds have a magnitude and a direction, and
so it takes three numbers to deﬁne them.
Perhaps the simplest vector to describe is the position vector r of some point in space deﬁned
by its Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z), or the vector r′ being the position vector corresponding
to the point (x′, y′, z′). The position vector r′ is represented by a an arrow extending from the
origin (0, 0, 0) to (x′, y′, z′) as in Fig. A.1(a). Its magnitude is just the length (measured in m)
of the arrow which, using Pythagoras’ theorem, is r′ =
√
x′2 + y′2 + z′2. The vector’s direction
is represented by three direction cosines, cos θ′
x, cos θ′
y and cos θ′
z, which are the cosines of the
angles the vector makes with the three Cartesian axes as shown in Fig. A.1(b).

just seen one example — the direction cosines of r′ are the Cartesian components of the unit
vector in the direction of r′, i.e. r′ = (cos θ′
x, cos θ′
y, cos θ′
z). Note that the “hat” above vector r′
indicates that it is a unit vector, i.e. in this case
r′

|r′|
=
(x′, y′, z′)
√
x′2 + y′2 + z′2
=
(cos θ′
x, cos θ′
y, cos θ′
z).
(A.1)
A unit vector r′ pointing in the direction of r′ has been added to Fig. A.1(b). Unit vectors in
the x, y and z directions are written x, y and z (in some books they are written i, j and k).
These three unit vectors form an orthogonal set of basis vectors (Fig. A.1c).
The force F on a particle has a magnitude F (measured in N) and acts in the direction deﬁned
by its direction cosines. Multiplying the magnitude of the force by the three direction cosines
gives the three Cartesian components of the force, Fx, Fy and Fz, each of which is a scalar,
and these three numbers (together with the vector’s dimensions) completely specify the vector.
Multiplying the three components of F by the corresponding unit vectors we can reconstruct
the original vector by vector addition,
F = Fxx + Fyy + Fzz,
(A.2)
where the rule for vector addition may be stated as: “Put the 2nd vector so that its tail is at
the head of the 1st arrow, then the 3rd arrow so its tail is at the head of the 2nd, and the vector
sum of the three vectors is the vector extending from the tail of the 1st vector to the head of
the 3rd vector” (see Fig. A.2). Notice that we obtained each of the three vectors that we added
by multiplying a vector, e.g. x, by a scalar, Fx, to get a new vector Fxx parallel to the x and
having magnitude equal to the magnitude of x (1 because it is a unit vector) multiplied by the
value of the scalar (Fx).

Dot and cross products
Multiplying vectors by vectors is a little more complicated as there are diﬀerent types of mul-
tiplication to consider. We have just now implicitly used the scalar product or “dot product”
of two vectors, written
A · B = AB cos θ
(A.3)
where θ is the angle between the directions of the two vectors. Taking the dot product of vector
F with a unit vector gives the component of F in the direction of the unit vector, e.g.
Fx = F · x = F cos θx,
Fy = F · y = F cos θy,
Fz = F · z = F cos θz.
(A.4)
The vector product or “cross product” of two vectors, written A×B, is a vector whose magnitude
is
|A × B| = AB sin θ
(A.5)
where θ is the angle between the directions of the two vectors, and its direction is given by the
right hand rule (Fig. A.3). Hence, the Cartesian unit vectors obey the following
x × y = z,
y × z = x,
z × x = y,
x × z = −y,
y × x = −z,
z × y = −x,
(A.6)
and x × x = y × y = z × z = 0. We can use these relations to obtain a formula for the cross
product of two vectors in terms of their components
A × B = (Axx + Ayy + Azz) × (Bxx + Byy + Bzz),

In one dimension the diﬀerential operator d/dx operating on a function f(x) gives df/dx, i.e.
the gradient at x of a plot of f vs. x. In three dimensions the gradient operator ∇operating on
a scalar ﬁeld f(x, y, z) gives a vector ﬁeld whose magnitude is the steepest gradient, i.e. highest
rate of increase of f with distance, and is pointing in the direction of the steepest gradient. The
gradient operator is

Line integrals
A line integral (or path integral) is an integral of some quantity along some speciﬁed path
in space. A path is one-dimensional and so locations along the path r(λ) may be uniquely
speciﬁed by a single parameter, in this case λ. As one moves along the path increasing λ by dλ
the position vector changes from r to (r + dr) where dr = (dr/dλ)dλ. For example, the quarter
circle shown in Fig. C.1(a) may be parameterised in terms of the angle ϕ,
r(ϕ) = a cos ϕx + a sin ϕy.
(C.1)
As one moves along the path increasing ϕ by dϕ the position vector changes from r to (r + dr)
where
dr = dr

)
dϕ = (−a sin ϕx + a cos ϕy + 0)dϕ.
(C.2)
The line integral may be of several diﬀerent types. For example
∫r2
Γ, r1 |dr| would simply give the
distance along path Γ (from r1 to r2), and
∫r2
Γ, r1 A · dr would give the integral of the tangential
component of A along the path Γ. For example, the line integral of A = bx x around the

Surface Integrals
The most common type of surface integral encountered in electromagnetism is the ﬂux integral
which is of the form
∫
S F · dS and gives the ﬂux of the vector ﬁeld F through the surface.
For example if F represented the ﬂow velocity (m s−1) of an incompressible ﬂuid then the ﬂux
integral would give the rate at which the ﬂuid pass through the surface (m3 s−1).
We need two parameters, say u and v to parameterise a surface S, r = r(u, v). Then the surface
element can be written dS = A × B, as in Fig. C.1(b), where
A = ∂r
∂udu,
B = ∂r
∂vdv,

Hence, for S corresponding to u1 < u < u2 and v1 < v < v2
∫
S
F · dS =
∫u2
u1
∫v2
v1
F(u, v) · ∂r
∂u × ∂r
∂v dv du.
(C.6)
There are two directions perpendicular to any surface, so the direction must be speciﬁed – by
deﬁnition it is outward from the volume for integrals over closed surfaces, which are written as
∮
S F · dS. One must always make sure that dS points in the right direction for the problem (i.e.
into or out of the surface).
As an example, we shall consider a simple ﬂux integral over the surface of the cone shown in
Fig. C.2. For points in the surface
r = r sin θc cos ϕx + r sin θc sin ϕy + r cos θcz.
(C.7)
and so it makes sense to use as parameters r (0 < r ≤R) and ϕ (0 < ϕ ≤2π).

Volume Integrals
For volume integrals we need three parameters, u, v, and w. The volume element is dV =
|C · (A × B)| as in Fig. A.4(b) with

When symmetry permits one can often use cylindrical or spherical polar coordinates for which
the Jacobian determinants are J = ρ (cylindrical coordinates ρ,ϕ,z), and J = r2 sin θ (spherical
coordinates r,θ,ϕ).

Gauss’ Theorem (Divergence Theorem) states
∫
V
∇· F d3r =

S
F · dS

where dS is the surface normal which is directed outwards from the volume, and surface S
bounds volume V . So we could in fact deﬁne the divergence of F as

Conservative fields and exactness
If for a vector ﬁeld F(r) one ﬁnds that ∇×F = 0, then F is said to be conservative, and Stokes’
theorem implies that
∮
Γ
F · dr = 0
(C.22)
for any closed loop such as (Γ1 + Γ2) or (Γ1 + Γ3) in Fig. C.3(b). Hence, if F is conservative
∮
(Γ1+Γ2)
F · dr =
∮
(Γ1+Γ3)
F · dr = 0
(C.23)
Since Γ1 is common to both these closed loops
∫r2
r1, Γ2
F · dr =
∫r2
r1, Γ3
F · dr
(C.24)
and so the integral must be independent of path. This allows us to deﬁne a potential
Φ(r) = −
∫r
r0
F(r′) · dr′
(C.25)
such that F(r) = −∇Φ. Then
−
∫r
r0
F(r′) · dr′
=
∫r
r0
∇Φ(r′) · dr′
=

dΦ
=
Φ(r) −Φ(r0),
(C.26)
and we see that if ∇×F = 0 then F·dr is exact because ∇Φ(r)·dr = dΦ is an exact diﬀerential.
Before moving on, a word of caution is necessary. The result above is true only for simply-
connected regions, i.e. regions without holes in them.
An example of a multiply-connected
region is shown in Fig. C.4(a). Everywhere along loop Γ1 we have ∇× E = 0 and so we might

Basics of index notation
The components of the vector A are denoted Ai, where i is its index, i.e. A1 ≡Ax, A2 ≡Ay
and A3 ≡Az. Similarly, for a matrix, Bij represents the component in ith row and jth column.
The Kronecker delta is deﬁned
δij =
{
1,
if i = j
0,
otherwise
(D.1)
The Levi-Civita tensor is deﬁned
εijk =





1,
if i j k = 1 2 3 or 3 1 2 or 2 3 1
−1,
if i j k = 1 3 2 or 2 1 3 or 3 2 1
0,
otherwise
(D.2)
Note that εijk is 1 for cyclic permutations of 123, and −1 for anti-cyclic permutations, e.g. 321,
and 0 otherwise.
In matrix multiplication [A] = [B][C]
Aij =
3
∑
k=1
BikCkj.
(D.3)
In the Einstein summation convention if an index appears twice (dummy index) then the re-
peated index is summed over for all three values of that index — there is no need to write the
summation sign — so that
Aij = BikCkj
(D.4)
is entirely equivalent to Eq. D.3. We see that the dummy index k has disappeared while the
free indices i and j remain.
In index notation the dot product is
A · B = AiBi.
(D.5)

Appendices
Following each summation the number of indices is reduced by one (in the dot product above
it is reduced from 1 to 0); this is called contraction. Another example of contraction is
δijAik = Ajk
(D.6)
where this time the number of indices goes from 3 to 2.
Symmetric tensors obey
Cij = Cji
or
Cijk = Ckji
(D.7)
and are unchanged when any two indices are swapped. Anti-symmetric tensors obey
Dij = −Dji
or
Dijk = −Dkji
(D.8)
and when any two indices are swapped they changes sign. The Levi-Civita Tensor, εijk, is
anti-symmetric. The Kronecker Delta, δij, is symmetric. When you sum over all elements of
the product of two tensors one of which is symmetric and the other anti symmetric the result
is zero, e.g. if Aij is symmetric and Bij antisymmetric, then AijBij = 0.
The gradient operator is
∇=
( ∂
∂x, ∂
∂y, ∂
∂z
)
,
so that in index notation it is ∇i = ∂/∂ri.
The divergence of a vector ﬁeld D is
∇· D = ∇iDi.
(D.9)
The cross product of F and G, and its ith component are
F × G = εijk ei Fj Gk,
[F × G]i = εijk Fj Gk,
(D.10)
where e1, e2 and e3 are the unit vectors in the x, y and z directions.

A useful Levi-Civita Identity is

indices of one of them.

Uniqueness of solutions of Poisson's equation
We will prove by contradiction that the solution of Poisson’s equation is unique.
Consider
the possibility that there could be two diﬀerent solutions V1(r) and V2(r) for the same charge
density ρ(r) and boundary conditions. The corresponding electric ﬁelds E1(r) = −∇V1(r) and
E2(r) = −∇V2(r) must satisfy Gauss law,
∇· [−∇V1(r)] = ρ(r)
ε0
and
∇· [−∇V2(r)] = ρ(r)
ε0
.
(E.1)
∴
∇· [∇(V2 −V1)] = 0.

Using product rule Eq. I.8 we may write
∇· [(V2 −V1) ∇(V2 −V1)] = ∇(V2 −V1) · ∇(V2 −V1) + (V2 −V1)∇· [∇(V2 −V1)] .
∴
∇· [(V2 −V1) ∇(V2 −V1)] = |∇(V2 −V1)|2
+ 0.

Integrating over volume V inside the boundary surface S,
∫
V
∇· [(V2 −V1) ∇(V2 −V1)] d3r =
∫
V
|∇(V2 −V1)|2d3r,
(E.4)
∴
∮
S
(V2 −V1) ∇(V2 −V1) · ndS =
∫
V
|∇(V2 −V1)|2d3r
(E.5)
where we have used Gauss’ theorem on the left hand side.
If V is speciﬁed on the boundary surface then on that surface V2(r) = V1(r), or if E · n is
speciﬁed on the boundary (∇V2) · n = (∇V1) · n. In either case the surface integral is zero, and
we are left with
∫
V
|∇(V2 −V1)|2d3r = 0.
(E.6)
Since the integrand is everywhere greater than or equal to zero, this equation can only be
satisﬁed if ∇(V2 −V1) = 0, in other words if E2(r) = E1(r). So, we have just have proved that
the solution for the electric ﬁeld is unique, and consequently that V2(r) = V1(r) + Vconst where
Vconst is an arbitrary constant potential. If the potential is speciﬁed anywhere on the boundary
then V2(r) = V1(r) everywhere inside the boundary.

Field line tracing as an initial value problem
For solving an ordinary diﬀerential equation, dy/dx = f(x), given initial conditions y(x0) = y0,
one can use Euler’s method with “steps” of length ∆in x,
xn+1 = xn + ∆;
yn+1 = yn + f(xn)∆.
(F.1)
Similarly for tracing ﬁeld lines of vector ﬁeld F(r) one could use a scheme motivated by Euler’s
method, as illustrated in Fig. F.1(a)
rn+1 = rn + F(r)∆.
(F.2)
A scheme motivated by the 2nd order Runge-Kutta Method for solving initial value problems
gives greatly improved accuracy, as illustrated in Fig. F.1(b)
rn+1/2 = rn + F(rn)∆
2 ;
rn+1 = rn + F(rn+1/2)∆.

Figure F.1: Comparison of (a) Euler’s method and (b) the 2nd order Runge-Kutta method of
solving initial value problems as applied to ﬁeld-line tracing.
This straightforward technique has been used for producing all the images in this book which
show electric or magnetic ﬁeld lines. The best example to show the accuracy of this method is a
magnetic ﬁeld line of an inﬁnite straight current, whose ﬁeld is given by B = (µ0I/2πρ)ϕ. The
ﬁeld lines should therefore be circles in the x–y plane, and the two methods discussed above
are compared for the same step size in Fig. F.2.

sides: V (0, y, z)=V (1, y, z)=V (x, 0, z)=0 V, and V (x, 1, z)=1 V. We choose a grid spacing
L=0.01 m, i.e. 100×100 cells (101×101 grid points). After each iteration, the potentials at
the outer grid points are reset to the potentials on the boundary surfaces.
At the corners
where V changes discontinuously from V =0 to V =1 V we set the potential to be the average
value, i.e. V (0, 1, z)=V (1, 1, z)=0.5 V. The result is contoured in Fig. 2.10. The code uses array
manipulation methods available in modern programming languages rather than using do loops
when computing the average potential around each grid point, and in resetting the boundary
potential.
The IDL code contains numerous comments, but I will explain some of the procedures called
which are speciﬁc to IDL.
FINDGEN(n) declares a ﬂoating-point array with n elements which have the values: 0,1,2,…n-1.
FLTARR(n,m) declares a 2D a ﬂoating-point array with n×m elements.
NAME(i:j,*) means the array made up of the elements of the 2D array NAME having the 1st
index in the rangle i to j and all values of the 2nd index.
SHIFT(NAME,k,l) means the array constructed from 2D array NAME by shifting the 1st index
by k and the 2nd by l.
CONTOUR, together with some other formatting statements (not shown), contours the result.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!
