Digital Signals
The Binary or base-2 numbers are just 0 and 1.
The word “bit” is a contraction of “binary digit”.
A digital signal is any binary sequence (of finite or
infinite length); that is, any sequence of 0s and 1s.

Combinational Digital Systems
A combinational digital system is a digital system such
that each output can be expressed as a proposi-
tional logic formula in terms of the inputs (using
only AND, OR and NOT).
.

Exercise: Combinational Digital Systems
A car alert is to be activated exactly when the ignition is turned
on and either a door is open or an occupied seat does not have a
seat belt buckled.
Let the output signal for the alert be z, with z taking value 1
when the alert is active. Input signal p is 1 when the ignition is
turned on; input q is 1 when all car doors are closed; and input
r is 1 when all occupied seats have their seat belts buckled.
Which (one or more) of these propositional formulas correctly
describe z as a function of p, q and r:
(a)
z ≡(p & (q ∨r))
(b)
z ≡(p & (∼q ∨∼r))
(c)
z ≡((p & q) ∨(p & r))
(d)
z ≡((p & ∼q) ∨(p & ∼r))

Exercise Solution: Combinational Digital Systems
A car alert is to be activated exactly when the ignition is turned
on and either a door is open or an occupied seat does not have a
seat belt buckled.
Let the output signal for the alert be z, with z taking value 1
when the alert is active. Input signal p is 1 when the ignition is
turned on; input q is 1 when all car doors are closed; and input
r is 1 when all occupied seats have their seat belts buckled.
Solution:
(b)
z ≡(p & (∼q ∨∼r))
(d)
z ≡((p & ∼q) ∨(p & ∼r))

Example: Combinational Digital Systems
Alternative task: from the word description of the system
functionality, complete the truth table for the output z as a
function of p, q, r.

Combinational vs. Sequential Digital Systems
Combinational digital systems: memoryless.
The current value of each output signal is a function of the
current values of the input signals – and does not depend on
past values of input signals.

Combinational vs. Sequential Digital Systems
Combinational digital systems: memoryless.
The current value of each output signal is a function of the
current values of the input signals – and does not depend on
past values of input signals.
Sequential digital systems: contain memory via
combinational and delay components in feedback loops, plus
digital clock.
Memory registers are used to keep track of past values of input
signals, with values in memory recorded by internal state
signals, together with clock input signal to keep time.

Jobs done by combinational systems
▶Encoding and Decoding of digital signals. Tech term:
codec = encoding-decoding. E.g. of encoding: buttons
on mobile phone: press button “9”on keypad, and 4-bit
encoder produces 1001 as output.
▶Selecting and Distributing digital signals. Tech term: a
multiplexer (MUX) is a data selecter, and a demultiplexer
(DEMUX) is a data distributer.
▶Binary arithmetic: operations of addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and more, with binary coding of negative
numbers and finite-precision real numbers.
▶Comparison and classification: E.g. input two 4-bit
binary numbers a = a3 a2 a1 a0 and b = b3 b2 b1 b0, and
output 0 or 1 to questions “a > b?”, “a = b?” or “a < b?”.
