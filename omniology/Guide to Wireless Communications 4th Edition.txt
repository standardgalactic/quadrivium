Introduction
We live in a wireless world! All the technologies and standards that have been
released in the past five years, along with the ones that will be released between now and
2020, means that almost everything we do—every aspect of our lives—has a wireless com-
ponent. In fact, wireless data communication is omnipresent today—in the cordless phones
we use in our homes and offices, in the over 6 billion cellular phones that roam the world,
even in warehouses, where wireless is used to keep track of inventory. Today, we can pur-
chase nearly all types of products or board a flight with our cellular phones and tablets,
thanks to wireless. Furthermore, homes, businesses, and even whole towns are now
equipped with wireless networks that allow residents, employees, and visitors to access the
Internet from anywhere using laptop computers, mobile phones, and tablets.
Whether you are a manager who needs a better understanding of the impact of wireless
communication devices, an IT professional looking to enhance your understanding of the
field by learning more about wireless data communications, or a student taking an introduc-
tory course in this topic, Guide to Wireless Communications, Fourth Edition, will help you
in that journey and prepare you for more in-depth learning.
Approach
Since the introduction, in mid-1995, of infrared data interfaces in laptop computers, which
allowed two computers to communicate without wires, along with the publication, in 1997,
of the first IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network standards, the field of wireless data

communications has continued to expand at a dramatic pace. This book provides the reader
with an in-depth introduction to wireless data communication technologies that are based on
standards, along with others that are important components of today’s wireless world. The
text covers the basics of radio frequency transmissions, transmitters, receivers, antennas,
IEEE 802.15.1 and Bluetooth, IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee standards for low-rate wireless per-
sonal area networks, IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ad and the upcoming /ax and /ay standards for
wireless local area networking (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) and Free Space Optics (infra-
red) wireless metropolitan area networks, the evolution of cellular technology all the way to
5G and satellite wireless wide area networks, and, finally, radio frequency identification
(RFID) and near field communication (NFC). Many aspects of coexistence (the ability of
two or more of these technologies to work in the same physical space) are also discussed, as
are the basics of implementation and security issues for each of the mentioned technologies,
along with a comprehensive tour of the various business and residential applications of wire-
less technologies in Chapter 12.
Using straightforward language, this text introduces the most important technical aspects of each
technology and can be used in classroom settings in technical colleges, early year university
courses, or for distance education. It features extensive linking to websites where the reader can
find additional materials. Please note, however, that although the URLs for some of these sites
were accurate at the time this book was printed, these web resources can change frequently.
This text’s pedagogical materials include Real-World Exercises, which further your learning
outside the classroom setting, and Hands-On Projects, which take you through the often
step-by-step process of performing tasks relevant to working in wireless communications. The
Hands-On Projects, which can be performed in the lab or at home, use inexpensive,
consumer-class equipment as well as freeware and demo versions of popular software. Finally,
there are Challenge Case Projects, team-based research projects that help expand the students’
knowledge of the technologies discussed and direct them to additional learning resources.
Intended Audience
Guide to Wireless Communications, Fourth Edition, is designed to meet the needs of students
and professionals who want to gain a better understanding of the fundamental concepts, scope,
and issues surrounding the implementation of wireless data communications technologies. The
text assumes a basic knowledge of computers and networks at CompTIA A+ and Network+
levels. The pedagogical features provide a realistic, interactive learning experience to help pre-
pare students for the challenges of working in the field of wireless data communications.

try, which is important knowledge for anyone working in the industry.
Chapter 4, How AntennasWork, takes a simplified but in-depth look at antennas and the
important role they have in the successful implementation of a wireless data communica-
tions system.
Chapter 5, Wireless Personal Area Networks, looks at the first two technologies
developed for short-range wireless data communications, Bluetooth and ZigBee (IEEE
802.15.4).
Chapter 6, Introduction to Wi-Fi WLANs, provides essential knowledge of the basics of
Wi-Fi LANs by taking an in-depth look at the early design and implementation of IEEE
802.11, Wi-Fi, and prepares the reader to learn about the more complex enhancements
to the standard covered in later chapters.
Chapter 7, Enhancing WLAN Performance, details all of the IEEE 802.11 amendments
that have helped make WLAN performance competitive with wired LANs, from
802.11a/g to 802.11ac and introduces 802.11ax and ay.
Chapter 8, Expanding WLANs and WLAN Security, covers implementation enhance-
ments that have been created to expand WLANs and make them easier to manage. It
also introduces core WLAN security concepts.
Chapter 9, Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks, is an introduction to Free Space
Optics, microwave, and WiMAX, wireless technologies that can interconnect LANs, pro-
vide last-mile connectivity, and also make it possible to deploy data networks in remote
areas, across and in between cities and even covering entire continents.
Chapter 10, Wireless Wide Area Networks, takes a look at the evolution, design, and the
basics of implementation of cellular networks, as well as satellite technologies and how
these are used to extend the reach of wireless data communications networks across the
entire world.
Chapter 11, Radio Frequency Identification and Near Field Communication, describes
the RFID technology that is being used today to help identify, count, and track everything
from small packaged products to the entire contents of large warehouses automatically
and without wires. It then introduces NFC, the technology that enables wireless payments
such as Apple Pay, enables tap-to-pay using credit and debit cards, and can simplify the
establishment of connections between devices like cellular phones, tablets, wireless speak-
ers, cameras, and other devices.
Chapter 12, Wireless Communications Everywhere, takes learners on a comprehensive
tour of how wireless data communication technologies are being used today and intro-
duces some potential future applications.

Lab Requirements
To the User
This book is intended to be read in sequence, from beginning to end. Each chapter builds on
preceding chapters to provide a solid understanding of wireless data communications. How-
ever, you may find it useful to follow Chapter 1 with Chapter 12 as a means of sparking
additional interest in learning about all the technologies mentioned throughout the book.
For additional information on hardware, software, and specialized requirements, as well as
extra labs, or to exchange ideas and suggestions for lab exercises, please visit the author’s
website at http://faculty.georgebrown.ca/~jolenewa.
Hardware and Software Requirements
Here are the hardware and software requirements needed to perform the end-of-chapter
Hands-On Projects:
●Built-in or USB Bluetooth 2.1 or 4.X adapter (supported by Windows 7 or Windows 10)
●Any consumer-class wireless residential gateway or access point, such as Linksys or
DLink, and preferably a dual-band router compatible with 802.11ac. If possible, try
to acquire a few new or used enterprise-class access points (APs) to provide learners
with a higher-end perspective on the available configuration options. In my opinion,
the standards supported by the AP are not as important as the differences between
configuring a home wireless router and an enterprise AP.

We all know that wireless communications technologies have had a huge impact
around the world. Today, wireless communications affects almost everything we do,
from using our ever-present smartphones to make voice calls, to access information on the
Internet, shop, keep up with friends and family, watch videos and play games, listen to
music, buy movie and event tickets, and thousands of other applications, to business uses
such as counting inventory using handheld wireless scanners and using portable credit or
debit card readers that communicate over the cellular phone network and can also read the
cards simply by having them placed near the device. There should be no question that the
use of wireless devices will continue to expand into virtually every aspect of our lives.
Wireless communications has completely revolutionized the way we live, just as personal com-
puters forever altered how we worked in the 1980s and the Internet dramatically changed
how we obtained and accessed information in the 1990s. The Internet has also changed how
we communicate around the world. Using wireless devices to send and receive messages
through a variety of apps, as well as to connect to the Internet and access corporate applica-
tions and databases from any location in the world is now an integral part of our daily lives.
And numerous devices—laptop computers, tablets, digital still picture and video cameras,
printers, portable digital music players, even refrigerators, washers and dryers, watches, and
electricity meters—are equipped with the ability to communicate without wires.
Today, we can all be in touch with the digital resources we need, no matter where we may
find ourselves. Nearly everyone has experienced dramatic changes based on wireless technol-
ogies, to the extent that, without even thinking about it, we expect devices to be connected
at all times, without using wires or cables.
Wireless Communications Technologies
Before we continue, let’s define precisely what we mean by wireless communications. The term
wireless is often used to describe all types of electronic devices and technologies not connected
by a wire. A garage door opener and a television remote control can be called “wireless
devices,” and although they do transmit data, they have little in common with the technologies
discussed in this book. Because the term wireless is sometimes used to refer to any device that
has no wires, people can sometimes be puzzled about the exact meaning of wireless communica-
tions. A home or office cordless phone can also be considered a wireless communications device
—for communicating with the human voice, that is. But for the purposes of this book, wireless
communications is defined as the transmission of digital data while connected to some type of
data network, without the use of wires. Smartphones, for example, can be used to make a sim-
ple voice call, but these devices have capabilities that extend far beyond that, and are also able
to connect to data networks. Digital data in this case may include email messages, spreadsheets,
and short messages transmitted to or from a digital cellular phone.
The next sections discuss the various forms that wireless data communications can take. You
will read about Wi-Fi-based wireless LANs, Bluetooth, ZigBee, WiGig, radio frequency identi-
fication (RFID) and near field communication (NFC), as well as satellite, cellular, and fixed
broadband wireless communications technologies. The specific details of each of these technol-
ogies are covered in later chapters. Let’s first take a look at a few examples of technologies
and what it is like to use a variety of wireless data devices.

Wi-Fi (Wireless LAN)
We begin with Wi-Fi, because it is the most common and most recognizable of all the
different technologies discussed in this book. Imagine that you are getting ready to leave
home for a busy workday. While you are getting ready, using your smartphone’s connection
to the Wi-Fi network or wireless local area network (WLAN), which enables you to access
all the digital-data-enabled devices in the house, you play music from your smartphone
through wireless speakers. These Wi-Fi-enabled speakers can play music from any of the
devices connected to the Wi-Fi network and can be installed anywhere in the house without
the need for wires, except for power cords. You then open your tablet and print a spread-
sheet on your Wi-Fi printer to take to work, and place a call to your office to pick up your
messages using your smartphone with a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) app, which
allows you to make calls over the Internet.
Figure 1-1 illustrates a home wireless network.
Because you are inside your home using the Wi-Fi network, your smartphone can automati-
cally connect and access the Internet. Using VoIP over your wireless network and the Internet
instead of your cellular provider can help you save money on your bills. In fact, many people
no longer have or use traditional telephone lines, preferring to have only a mobile phone.
Some carriers offer a service that makes the phone automatically switch the call between
your wireless network and the cellular network when you are out of range and not connected
to a Wi-Fi network. This also helps the cellular carriers by reducing the amount of voice call
traffic on their expensive cellular networks.

While you are having breakfast, a short beep sounds and you notice that a shopping list has
been emailed to your smartphone from the refrigerator. A computer system installed in the
refrigerator door lets you share a family schedule, make shopping lists, as well as exchange
information through text messages or email with your computers, smartphones, and tablets.
Because the refrigerator is also connected to the Internet through your Wi-Fi network, you
can access this information even when you are not at home.
To watch a video demonstration of a smart refrigerator in action,
search the web or YouTube using the keywords “Samsung Internet
fridge.”
Now let’s take a look at some of the technology behind using your home WLAN.
A WLAN is an extension of a wired LAN. Wireless devices connect to it through a wireless
access point (wireless AP or just AP). The AP relays data signals between all the devices on
the wired network, including file servers, printers, and even other access points and the wire-
less devices connected to the AP itself. The AP is fixed in one place, although it can be moved
when necessary, whereas the devices that connect to an AP are usually portable and have the
freedom to move around the office area or sometimes an entire business or school campus.
In your home, each device that is connected to the Wi-Fi WLAN is equipped with a wireless
network interface card (wireless NIC), which communicates with your wireless residential
gateway (often called a wireless router), and some have more than one NIC, to allow con-
nection to different types of wireless networks. A wireless NIC performs the same function
as a wired NIC and looks very similar, except that it has one or more antennas instead of a
socket for a cable connection. The gateway includes an AP that enables every Wi-Fi-capable
device in your home to be interconnected without the trouble and expense of installing
cables; this wireless network also enables these devices to share any kind of data that they
can process and also allows devices to share an Internet connection.
The devices that can be part of your home or office wireless network include not only com-
puters but also VoIP cordless telephones, home entertainment systems, game consoles, porta-
ble digital music players, tablet computers, printers, the home security system, lighting and
environment (HVAC) controls, and many other devices.
WLANs operate based on networking standards established by the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The IEEE has published and is continuing to work on a series
of standards used in WLANs. One of the latest standards provides for data transmission
speeds of over 1 Gigabit per second or Gbps, that is, over 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) bits per
second at distances of up to 375 feet (114 meters). The maximum transmission speeds that
can be achieved in WLANs is dependent on the number of radios used simultaneously as
well as on the maximum distance. You will learn more about this in the chapters that cover
WLANs.
Throughout this book, “IEEE 802.11,” “802.11,” and “Wi-Fi” are
used interchangeably, with or without a letter after the standard
number, IEEE 802.11. If there is a letter after the number, it indicates
an amendment to the standard.

To get a better idea of the data transmission speed of a Wi-Fi network,
consider that each alphanumeric character transmitted typically uses
16 bits of data. This means that at only 300 Mbps, which is the speed
of a typical home wireless network today, a computer can transmit
about 9,000 letter-sized pages per second, with approximately 2,000
letters and spaces in each. Can you read that fast?
Virtually all smartphones, tablets, and laptop computers today are able to connect to a Wi-Fi
network, and most of the latest home security, environmental control systems (heating and
air conditioning), a few of the newer home appliances like refrigerators, washers and dryers,
door locks, and garage doors now include the ability to connect to the Internet. This enables
you to control an ever-growing number of devices in your home from wherever you may be.
You can also add wireless NICs to desktop computers that may not be equipped with Wi-Fi
when you purchase them and eliminate the need for network wires.
Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a wireless technology that is part of standards designed to transmit data at
typically very short ranges, from a few inches to 33 feet (10 meters). The main purpose of
technologies, such as Bluetooth, is to eliminate the cables between devices such as smart-
phones and computers, which allows data to be transmitted wirelessly between, say, a com-
puter and a printer, as well as to synchronize your smartphone and computer. Bluetooth
communicates using small, low-power transceivers called radio modules, which are built
into tiny circuit boards and contain very small microprocessors. Bluetooth devices use a link
manager, which is a software that helps it identify other Bluetooth devices, create a link
between them, and send and receive digital data, including music and voice. Bluetooth can
also be used to share many other types of data.
Bluetooth headphones and headsets are popular because they avoid annoying wires that can
get caught on clothing, door handles, other people, etc., and can easily be damaged. There
are also portable speakers that use Bluetooth to connect to your smartphone or tablet so
you can play and share music, and some of these wireless speakers are equipped with a
microphone, which allows you to use them to make hands-free phone calls.
Bluetooth is now also common in many other devices, such as smart TVs, which have web
browsers and can be connected to the Internet. For example, you could connect a Bluetooth
keyboard to a smart TV set and enter a web addresses from the comfort of your couch. Blue-
tooth is also used for connecting many other types of devices, such as a keyboard and mouse
to your computer, which eliminates cables and the need to use USB interfaces for these
devices. Tablets running on the Google Android operating system can also use Bluetooth to
transfer pictures and files and you can use Bluetooth to transfer other types of files between
two computers. Bluetooth is also extensively used to connect smartphones to car audio
systems. This provides support for hands-free cellular phone calls as well as for playing and con-
trolling music stored in Bluetooth-equipped smartphones and other types of music players.
Bluetooth is named after the tenth-century Danish King Harald
Blåtand (or in Old Norse Bláo˛ tnn, which means Bluetooth) who was
responsible for unifying Scandinavia. You can read more of his story
on the web by searching for the king’s name.

Among other technologies that use Bluetooth is iBeacon. Originally developed by Apple,
iBeacon-enabled apps can not only be used in shopping malls and stores to deliver coupons
and direct regular customers of a store to sale items, but it can also be used to help visually
impaired persons to more easily find their way around a subway station. iBeacon uses
small, inconspicuous, usually battery-powered Bluetooth transmitters that can be installed
on walls and issue voice instructions from an app. Most Bluetooth devices can transfer a
maximum of between 1 and 3 Mbps at distances of up to 33 feet (10 meters), but one
of the latest versions of this technology is capable of transmitting data at rates of
20+ Mbps. Bluetooth is also used to connect smartwatches to smartphones and laptops.
Most smartwatches can display notifications, who is calling, and email messages right on
your wrist, so you do not have to always take your smartphone out of your pocket or
purse to check it. Wearable fitness and sleep tracking devices also connect to smartphones
via Bluetooth.
Take a look at some iBeacon applications at www.iBeacon.com or by
searching for “iBeacon” on the web.
Search the web for more information on smartwatches such as those
from Pebble, Apple, Motorola, Samsung, and Asus. Even a few of
the traditional watch manufacturers such as Breitling are now pro-
ducing smart versions that can give you notifications via your smart-
phone over a Bluetooth connection.
The automatic connection between various Bluetooth devices creates a piconet, also called a
wireless personal area network (WPAN). A piconet consists of two or more Bluetooth
devices that are exchanging data with each other. Up to seven devices can belong to a single
Bluetooth WPAN. Although Bluetooth can send data through physical barriers like walls, its
limited range is more suitable for replacing cables and wires at short ranges. More than
15,000 different computer, smartphone, peripheral, and other equipment vendors today cre-
ate products based on the Bluetooth standard.
The IEEE standards with the numbering beginning with 802.15 cover
WPAN technologies.
ZigBee
Over the past few decades, several home automation or “smarthome” technologies have
appeared on the market. Most of them were implemented as systems that depended on
house electrical wiring. Later, wireless capabilities were added in the form of devices that
bridged between wireless and the house’s power wires. Practically none of these legacy sys-
tems are based on standards ratified by organizations like the IEEE, and although there are
many compatible devices on the market that support these technologies, they will not be cov-
ered in this text.

A notable exception is ZigBee, a wireless communications specification based on IEEE
standard 802.15.4, which is also intended for short-range transmissions. The ZigBee
Alliance is the organization that creates and maintains the specification covering the
upper protocol communication layers. The ZigBee Alliance also certifies compatible
products.
The ZigBee specification is designed for applications that require devices with long battery
life and can transmit data at distances of between 33 and 50 feet (10 to 15 meters). To pass
certification, the battery life on ZigBee devices must be at least 2 years. Devices can reach
others that are located farther than the maximum 50 feet (15 meters) by making use of a
mesh network where devices can pass or “route” data through other devices, similar to how
a router in a TCP/IP network can pass data to other routers. The maximum data rate for
ZigBee is 250 Kbps (kilobits per second).
When ZigBee-enabled devices are not being used (e.g., think of a typical house light switch),
they can save power by turning off their transmitters for long periods of time and only wake
up periodically to check the status of the network.
Most smart LED light bulbs being produced today by large manufacturers like General Elec-
tric, Philips, and others support the ZigBee protocol and can be controlled by central hub (a
kind of wireless AP), which is accessed from a smartphone app.
In addition to home automation, ZigBee is used for automating entire commercial buildings,
dramatically reducing the need for control wires from every office to a central control room
on the ground level or basement. This can represent major cost reductions for builders and
lower maintenance expenses for the building management or owners, in addition to the
potential energy savings that can be realized by making it easier for lights to be turned off at
night and during holidays and weekends.
The ZigBee specification covers several other applications in addition to home and building
automation. Among these are environmental sensors, medical data collection devices, smoke
detectors, and security systems as well as controlling industrial equipment.

automation, visit www.wink.com or search the web for “home automation.”
WiGig
WiGig is another short-range wireless technology designed for use primarily in the home; it
can transmit larger quantities of data at much higher speeds. WiGig can send and receive
CD- and DVD-quality audio and video as well as Blu-ray high-definition movies from enter-
tainment equipment, computers, or mobile devices to a TV, for example. WiGig can transfer
video and sound at speeds of up to 7 Gbps (much slower from mobile devices that need to
conserve battery power), using a technology called Ultra Wide Band (UWB). However,
WiGig can transmit up to a distance of only 2 meters at these high speeds. Thus, its use is
confined to the space within a room with few or no obstacles between transmitter and

receiver devices, which is similar to using a TV remote control that uses infrared light, and
cannot be used from a different room than the TV because light does not go through walls.
In addition, the more obstacles, including people, that there are in a room, the shorter the
transmission range of WiGig.
WiGig products are just beginning to be introduced into the home entertainment market.
Wireless routers that support WiGig also include Wi-Fi and are able to switch automatically
between the two types of connection when the devices are out of the 2-meter range of each
other. You will learn more about radio frequency and WiGig in later chapters.
WiGig was originally created by the WiGig Alliance. In 2013, this
organization merged with the Wi-Fi Alliance. You can visit the Wi-Fi
Alliance website to search for the latest information about WiGig
and compatible products at www.wi-fi.org.
RFID and NFC
Radio frequency identification (RFID) is another short-distance wireless technology, devel-
oped primarily to replace the barcodes you see on nearly every product sold today. Barcodes
can only store a limited amount of information, the long numbers, and sometimes letters,
that are usually printed below the black and white vertical bars of the code. A key advan-
tage of RFID over barcodes is that the information can be read from the tag regardless of
whether it is visible, unlike barcodes, which require the vertical bars to be exposed to a
laser beam to be read. RFID tags are small chips containing a CPU, memory, and other elec-
tronic circuitry plus an antenna. RFID tags offer a way to store and access additional infor-
mation right on the product or the packaging, which makes it easier to identify the product
type, serial number, where it was manufactured and when, as well as other information. An
RFID reader or RFID interrogator emits electromagnetic waves that produce a small amount
of current in the tag antenna. This current powers the chip in the tag, which in turn trans-
mits the information stored in the tag’s memory back to the reader. You will learn more
about RFID technology in Chapter 11.
RFID tags are available in a large variety of types and sizes, from self-adhesive labels to
key fobs, in plastic nails that can be driven into trees to help identify and track them dur-
ing their lifetime, in buttons that can be sewn on clothes, and in many other forms. Auto-
mobiles that can be started by simply pressing a button on the dashboard incorporate an
RFID tag in the key fob and only require the key to be inside the car for the engine to
start. Some RFID tags, called active tags, are battery-powered and have a longer range.
These tags can include sensors that measure and record environmental parameters that
can be used to track if perishable products have been exposed to damaging temperatures
or humidity, for example.
Some airports use RFID to identify luggage, a system that vastly reduces the possibility
of bags being lost or redirected. As shipments are unloaded from a truck and carried
into a warehouse, boxes that include an RFID tag can be read right at the loading
dock, updating inventory and also directing the forklift operator where to place the
products. It is also possible to tag each individual product and have inventory counted
automatically.

One of the most common uses for RFID today is for inventory control. Instead of employees
counting inventory manually, an extremely time-consuming and often inaccurate task, RFID
readers can be installed throughout the building and inventory can be counted automatically
by a computer operator located in an office, as frequently as desired.
Tags can be read at varying distances depending on the type of tag and reader, from less than
1 inch (2.54 centimeters) up to about 330 feet (100 meters). Data rates are usually only few
kilobits per second, but this is more than enough for the small amount of data contained in
the typical tag.
Near field communication (NFC) is very similar to RFID and, in fact, some RFID equipment
is also able to read NFC tags. NFC is intended to work at an average distance of about 2 to
4 inches (about 5 to 10 centimeters) between a single tag and a device or between two capa-
ble devices. The transmission speed is approximately 250 Kbps, so it is suitable for reading
items like credit or debit cards and for some types of wireless communications between two
NFC-enabled devices. The NFC communication protocols allow battery-powered devices to
exchange information and, if authorized, both read and write data to each other using
secure, encrypted communications. While most RFID tags are passive and designed to store
fixed numbers in a predetermined format, NFC tags can include more flexible information
like web addresses, commands, or instructions. This technology has been incorporated in
many smartphones and tablets today. When two NFC-equipped devices are brought close to
each other, they can read data containing instructions, like how to automatically configure a
Bluetooth connection between them or set up a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi network to transfer larger
amounts of data.
Search the web for “NFC enabled Bluetooth speakers” to view an
example of devices that use NFC to configure a connection.
Smartphones and tablets equipped with NFC are sometimes able to write on the tags. For
example, you could configure an NFC tag to open your email app on your tablet, so that
you would not have to search for the tag icon on the screen and tap it to access your email
account. Payment systems like Google Wallet and Apple Pay use NFC to read information
from an app on your phone that allows you to pay for purchases without needing to access
your wallet and use a credit or debit card. Tap-to-pay debit and credit cards also use NFC to
enable you to pay for purchases, usually up to a small value, often without needing to insert
a card or swipe the magnetic strip, and enter your PIN code on a keypad, which helps speed
the transaction.
As early as 2004, runners in the Boston Marathon covered the
26.2-mile course with tiny wireless chips clipped to their shoe-
laces. The chips transmit an identification code that is detected
at several stations along the marathon course, and the code is
used to track the runners’ times as well as to email updates to
the runners’ friends and relatives regarding their locations and progress. For a full descrip-
tion of the technology employed, search the web using the keywords “Boston marathon
wireless.”

Wireless Metropolitan Area and Wide Area Networks
The technologies in this section are used for communications over a much wider area than
the ones discussed so far. These wireless technologies can cover areas ranging from an entire
city all the way to the entire planet. We begin with a look at satellite networks and also cover
cellular and microwave links.
Satellite Networks Companies that have offices and stores in locations where a wired
connection to the Internet is not easily available can use satellite communications to connect to
the Internet. Isolated communities, away from the major cities in many countries, frequently
make use of satellite communications for Internet access. International airlines offer Wi-Fi con-
nections in flight and use a satellite connection to enable travelers to access the Internet. Passen-
gers can use this connection to connect to corporate networks, especially during long overseas
flights. Courier companies making deliveries in remote locations can use satellite-based Internet
and phone connections to track and update deliveries and pick-ups, as well as update truck
routes and track the location and status of their delivery vehicles in real-time. News organiza-
tions use satellite phones to establish a private connection to their data networks in remote and
disaster areas, as well as in war-torn locations that lack a reliable cellular phone or other type of
Internet connection. This enables news to be delivered live from virtually any place on the planet
via a data connection. Scientists and people working in remote areas such as the Arctic or Ant-
arctic, for example, use portable satellite antennas for Internet connectivity.
Figure 1-2 shows a how a satellite retransmits the signal between points on the surface of
the planet.
In satellite communications, a device called a repeater is located in the satellite itself. An
Earth station transmits to the satellite on one frequency band, and the satellite regenerates

and retransmits (repeats) the signal back to Earth on a different frequency. The transmis-
sion time needed to repeat a signal from one Earth station to another can be up to
250 milliseconds, depending on the type of satellite used and its distance from the surface
of the planet.
Satellite communications are often handled through third-party, dedicated providers, instead
of the usual land-based communications companies.
The first satellite to orbit Earth successfully, called Sputnik, was
launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. Today, there are more than
900 operational satellites in orbit around the planet and reportedly
over 5,000 that are no longer functional. It’s only due to some truly
amazing mathematical calculations that they don’t crash into one
another, but on February 10, 2009, a nonoperational Russian satellite did crash into the
Iridium 33 communications satellite, which is used for satellite phones.
Global Positioning System (GPS), used for determining the location of GPS receivers on the
surface of the Earth, is also based on satellite technology. Dedicated satellites containing an
atomic clock send timing signals to both GPS devices and Earth-based receivers, which use
the timing information from multiple satellites to triangulate their position on the surface,
with reference to the position of the satellites in orbit. GPS receivers can also provide traffic
information to moving vehicles. The traffic information is transmitted from Earth stations,
not the satellites, usually via the same type of signal that is transmitted by FM radio stations.
GPS is not strictly a data communications technology, in the sense that GPS receivers are sim-
ilar to in-car audio and do not communicate back to the satellites. Some after-market GPS
receivers are also equipped with Bluetooth technology and use this to transmit turn-by-turn
directions through the vehicle’s audio system, instead of tiny speakers in the GPS device itself.
Satellite radio, such as SiriusXM in North America or Astra in Europe, is another example
of a technology that is not strictly data communications. Satellite receivers do not communi-
cate back to the satellites. Detailed coverage of GPS and satellite radio is beyond the scope
of this text.
Cellular Networks Cellular digital technology is widely used today to maintain connec-
tivity while out of range of a Wi-Fi network. Cellular communications today spans not only
cities but can cover an entire country, as well as a continent, enabling users to travel very
long distances while being able to make voice calls and access the Internet. A modern cellu-
lar telephone network is built around the concept of low-power transmitters, with each
“cell” handling a number of users. How many users can connect to a cell depends on the
type of cellular technology. With transmission towers spread throughout a city, as well as
along major highways, the same radio frequency channel can be used by towers located a
few miles from each other, thereby avoiding interference. The issue is that there is only a
limited range of radio frequencies available. The concept of cells maximizes the use of the
available frequency channels by reusing the same frequency two or more antenna towers
away from each other. This is also made possible within major urban centers by using low-
power digital transmission technology, which permits another transmitter to use the same
frequency a relatively short distance away without causing interference problems. This topic
is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 10.

Tablet computers can also be equipped with cellular technology, which can be used to keep
a user connected regardless of the location, so long as you can connect to a carrier’s net-
work. Most smartphones also allow wireless tethering, meaning that you can use them to
create a Wi-Fi hotspot and wirelessly connect a tablet or laptop computer to the smart-
phone, which then lets you access the Internet. People who work in the field, such as in
heating and ventilation service, computer service, and many other types of service, often
carry tablets or other dedicated data terminal equipment that enables them to connect to
the main office, download and edit service orders, view schematic diagrams, send and
receive email messages, access maps and get directions via the Internet, and connect to wire-
less printers so they can provide receipts to customers. Many restaurants are now equipped
with portable terminals that enable you to use a credit card to pay and get your receipt right
at your table.
Courier companies were one of the first types of business to use dedicated terminals to read
the barcode information on package labels, allow the customer to electronically sign on an
LCD screen, and transmit this information immediately to the main office via the cellular
network. Many passenger cars today offer connectivity to the Internet via the cellular net-
work and some cars even offer Wi-Fi so that all passengers (but hopefully not the driver,
for safety reasons) can connect and access the Internet. Public transportation such as buses
and trains also offer Wi-Fi capability, even on some intercity routes frequently used by com-
muters and businesspeople.
The data is actually transmitted to a cellular tower, which retransmits it to the destina-
tion via the cellular carrier’s central office. This cellular technology is based on a stan-
dard commonly known as 4G (fourth generation) technology, which uses 100 percent
digital transmission for data and, in the most advanced versions, voice calls are also
transmitted through the same data network that is used for Internet access. Using a 4G
cellular phone, dedicated mobile data terminal, tablet computer, or laptop, cellular tech-
nology allows the user to make a voice call at the same time as data is being transmitted
or received.
The range of cellular-enabled data terminal equipment that can be
connected to the Internet using cellular technology is always expand-
ing. You can get an idea about what is available today by searching
the web for “Mobile Data Terminal (MDT).”
Fourth generation or 4G sends data to mobile devices at rates that can theoretically
reach well over 100 Mbps when the devices are not moving and located in an area with
few concurrent users, 50 Mbps for slow-moving pedestrians, and over 20 Mbps in a fast-
moving vehicle. LTE Advanced, a newer version, has theoretical downstream speeds of
1 Gbps and upstream speeds of up to 500 Mbps. 4G technologies are today being
deployed worldwide and are expected to eventually harmonize all the different digital
cellular specifications around the world into a single standard. In most cases, when you
are outside of the reach of a 4G cellular network, a mobile device can switch to 3G
(third generation) cellular technology. The 3G or third generation data speeds will be
much lower, but should be able to maintain a data connection at speeds between 3 and
11 Mbps.

Many Wi-Fi home routers and even some enterprise-class APs can have cellular capability
added. Should the wired Internet connection fail, the devices can switch to a cellular data
connection automatically. A digital cellular network is illustrated in Figure 1-3.
One of the most recent and innovative uses of cellular technology
combined with Bluetooth is luggage tracking. Because of the large
volume of lost luggage by airline customers, a few companies have
introduced small, battery-powered devices that you can simply turn
on and throw inside bags that will be checked in. If your bag is mis-
directed, the devices will attempt to connect over the cellular network available at airports.
Upon arriving at your destination, if your luggage does not arrive, you can use an app on
your mobile phone to find its location and inform the airline, which should then be able to
retrieve it. The devices also use Bluetooth technology to send a message via the app to your
smartphone when your luggage has arrived at the carousel, assuming, of course, that it made
it to same destination as you and on the same flight. This device can reduce your time and
frustration in tracking your luggage. Search the web for “luggage tracking” to find a range of
products.
Using cellular technologies, companies can create a wireless wide area network (WWAN)
that enables their employees to access corporate data and applications from virtually
anywhere—across the country, an entire continent, and from anywhere around the
world.
Fixed Broadband Wireless In areas where wired Internet connectivity may not
be available and where the installation of cables may be difficult, the solution often is to
deploy wireless links based on microwave data equipment or WiMAX. These technologies
are commonly called fixed broadband wireless, because they were originally intended for

communications between fixed points like buildings or towers, although the WiMAX
specification and the related IEEE 802.16 standard include an amendment for mobile
communications as well. Even in cities, traditional high-speed land-based digital phone
lines such as T1 or faster, or the more modern optical fiber cables, can be very expensive
to rent and cost far too much to install and maintain. These types of wired connections
are usually installed by and leased from telephone and other utility companies, who already
own most of the communication infrastructure. Technologies such as cable modems, which
1use a television cable connection to provide Internet access, are generally available only
in or near residential areas. Digital subscriber line (DSL), which uses either regular or spe-
cial telephone lines, is sometimes available, but the speed is dependent on the distance
between a company’s office and the nearest telephone switching office (CO, for “central
office”).
The best and lowest-cost way for companies to link their office locations is to use a
wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN). A single WMAN link can cover an area
of about 25 square miles (40 square kilometers), and it can be used to carry data,
voice, and video signals.
Some WMANs today are based on the IEEE 802.16
(WiMAX) fixed broadband wireless standard and use radio waves for data communica-
tions. Longer distance links of 35 miles (56 kilometers) are usually installed by carriers
and similar types of service providers using microwave data transceivers that can trans-
mit at 400+ Mbps. Some companies, such as those in the petroleum drilling and
extraction industry, install their own dedicated networks in remote areas to ensure the
data they collect is made available at their central offices as quickly as possible. For
shorter distances, fixed broadband networks use small antennas on the roof of each
building in urban centers to create a dedicated WMAN.
WiMAX can transmit at speeds as high as 75 Mbps at distances of up to 4 miles
(6.4 kilometers) and 17 to 50 Mbps (depending on link quality) at distances over 6 miles
(10 kilometers) in a straight line. A recent amendment to WiMAX (IEEE 802.16m) can
achieve speeds of up to 100 Mbps and up to 1 Gbps in a point-to-point link. The use of anten-
nas substantially reduces the cost of WiMAX when compared to traditional wired connec-
tions, which require installation under city roads, are more prone to damage, and are more
expensive to repair and maintain.
Ironman triathlons, which can encompass a wide geographical area,
can now be viewed live online using an IEEE 802.16 WMAN to con-
nect cameras along the race route to the event’s website. Several
channels of video are sent out, allowing enthusiasts to check what
is happening at different race checkpoints simultaneously.
The Wireless Landscape
Most of what we do in terms of data access in a typical day could not be attempted—much
less completed—without wireless technology. As new wireless communications technologies
are introduced, they will continue to be a part of our lifestyle and will continue to change
how we live. Figure 1-4 provides a visual comparison of the range of different wireless data
technologies discussed in this chapter.

The speed of wireless networks varies greatly, depending on the number of users connected,
the amount of data traffic, the amount of interference present at the time, and many other
factors that will be discussed in later chapters.
Just as the number of wireless devices will dramatically increase, so will the number of job
opportunities to support these new technologies. The demand for professionals such as wire-
less engineers, wireless network managers, and wireless technical support personnel, the peo-
ple who build and maintain the networks, will continue to grow for many years to come.
Digital Convergence and Future Trends
Users are constantly demanding more functionality from their computers, and as a result, wire-
less devices such as cellular phones and tablets are being combined into single devices, what we
today call smartphones or phablets. These devices have also continued to add capabilities.
Whereas they were initially used only as appointment calendars, contact lists, and phones,
today they can play computer games with sophisticated graphics, play short- and full-length
movies, and play music as well as provide web access and run business and utility software
while connecting via the cellular network or WLAN. Some carriers even provide users with the
ability to watch live television programs and full-length movies on their smartphones.

Digital convergence refers to the power of digital devices—such as desk and laptop computers
and wireless handhelds like smartphones—to combine voice, video, and text-processing capa-
bilities as well as to be connected to business and home networks and to the Internet. The
same concept applies to the development of VoIP networks, which use the same protocols
and media (both wired and wireless) that once carried only data to carry two-way voice con-
versations. Wireless networks in general play an important part in digital convergence as users
demand to be connected to their data and voice networks at all times, wherever they may be.
Cellular providers worldwide are making it possible to watch TV programming and even
access on-demand movies and Internet radio. Video calls, using Apple’s FaceTime app and
many others, are also commonplace today, finally realizing a long-standing ambition of
major telephone companies worldwide to provide this capability.
The recent and upcoming advances in wireless technology and standards discussed in this
book will enable an ever-wider range of applications for wireless devices. There are now
smartphones that incorporate all voice and data communications in addition to providing
entertainment functions and allowing the user to make payments and debits directly from a
bank or prepaid account, and many more devices with these same capacities will be intro-
duced in the near future. Today, people in many parts of the world can book a hotel, pay
for a bus or streetcar ride, buy a snack from a vending machine, order movie tickets, and so
forth just using their smartphones. They don’t need to carry a wallet.
Digital wireless communications has expanded almost beyond human imagination and this
trend is likely to continue at a very fast pace. Wireless networks have overcome most of the
speed limitations since the original WLAN and other standards were approved. At one time,
paperless tablet devices like the ones you may have seen in old Star Trek movies were practically
unthinkable. Today, they are commonplace in homes and offices and are being used for a very
wide range of applications. Patients can swallow tiny wireless cameras installed in capsules that
enable doctors to conduct examinations inside a person’s body without the need for exploratory
surgery. It is virtually impossible to make predictions or to cover every single application here.
Every day, a new application for wireless data transmission is thought of or implemented.
Wireless Advantages and Challenges
As with any technology, wireless communications offers both advantages and challenges.
Advantages of Wireless Networking
There are many advantages to using wireless technology compared to wired networks. These
include mobility, easier and lower-cost installation, increased reliability, and more rapid
disaster recovery.
Mobility The freedom to move about without being tethered by wires is certainly the
principal advantage of a wireless network. Mobility enables users to stay connected to the
network no matter where they roam within the network’s range. Many workers who can’t
stay tied to a desk—such as police officers who need to access vehicle registration and
infraction records or inventory clerks who work in large stores or warehouses—are finding
that wireless data communications has become vital to the performance of their jobs.

Wireless technology also enables many industries to shift toward an increasingly mobile work-
force. Many employees spend large portions of their time away from a desk—whether they are
in meetings, working on a hospital floor, or conducting research. Laptop computers—and,
more recently, tablet computers, smartphones, and other portable devices—allow these
employees to enjoy added convenience, including access to the company network and
business applications.
One characteristic of today’s business world is “flatter” organizations, meaning there are
fewer management levels between top executives and regular employees. Much of the work
is done in teams that cross both functional and organizational boundaries, requiring many
team meetings away from the employees’ desks. The need for immediate access to network
resources exists while these meetings are taking place and video conferencing is a popular
way for staff in different locations around the world to get together, watch presentations,
and view different types of information via screen sharing. Instead of sending staff on long
trips, companies can save time and travel expense with video conferencing, which also
helps reduce their carbon footprint. WLANs are again here the solution to the problem.
They give team-based workers the ability to access the network resources they need while
collaborating in a team environment from their home offices or virtually anywhere.
Easier and Less Expensive Installation Installing network cabling can be a diffi-
cult, slow, and costly task, especially in older buildings. Facilities constructed prior to the
mid-1980s were built without any thought given to running computer wiring in each room.
Thick masonry walls and plaster ceilings are difficult, messy, and loud to drill holes through
and snake cabling around. Some older buildings have asbestos—a potentially cancer-causing
insulation material—that has to be completely removed before cabling can be installed. And
there are often restrictions on modifying older buildings that have historical value.
In all these instances, a WLAN is the ideal solution. Historical buildings can be preserved,
dangerous asbestos doesn’t need to be disturbed, and difficult drilling can be avoided by
using a wireless system. And, of course, eliminating the need to install and reinstall cabling
can result in significant cost savings for companies.
WLANs also make it easier for any office to be modified with new cubicles or furniture. No
longer does the design for a remodeled office first have to consider the location of the com-
puter jack in the wall when relocating furniture. Instead, the focus can be on creating the
most effective work environment for the employees.
The amount of time required to install network cabling is generally significant. Although the
cable itself is not very expensive, installers must pull wires through the ceiling and then drop
cables down walls to network outlets. This can usually take days or even weeks to complete,
and in countries where labor costs are high, this can make it very expensive. And except in the
case of brand-new buildings, employees must somehow continue their work in the midst of the
construction zone, which is often difficult to do. Using a WLAN eliminates any such disruption.
To find interesting articles about installing data networks in very old
buildings, search the web for “installing wireless in a castle.”
Wireless Advantages and Challenges

Increased Reliability Network cable failures may be the most common source of net-
work problems. Moisture in the air, a leak during a stormy season, or something as simple
as a coffee spill can erode metallic conductors. A user who shifts the computer on her desk
might break the network connection. When cables are installed in the ceiling or behind
walls, a cable splice that is done incorrectly can result in unexplainable errors that are very
difficult to locate and troubleshoot. Using wireless technology eliminates these types of cable
failures and increases the overall reliability of the network.
Disaster Recovery Accidents happen every day. Fires, tornados, and floods can occur
with little, if any, warning. Any organization that is not prepared to recover from such dis-
asters will find itself quickly out of business. A documented disaster recovery plan is vital to
every business if it is to get back to work quickly after a calamity.
Because the computer network is such a vital part of the daily operation of a business, the
ability to have the network up and working after a disaster is critical. Many businesses are
turning to WLANs as a major piece of their disaster recovery plans, in addition to using
IEEE 802.11n or IEEE 802.11ac wireless networking as the main connectivity solution.
Savvy planners keep laptop computers with wireless NICs and access points in reserve
along with backup network servers. Then, in the event that an unfortunate disaster such as
a flood, fire, hurricane or tornado destroys the facilities, managers can quickly relocate the
office without needing to install new network wiring. Instead, the network servers are
installed in the building along with the access points, and the laptop computers are distrib-
uted to the resettled employees.
Challenges of Wireless Networking
Along with the many advantages of wireless technology, there are challenges and concerns,
including radio signal interference, security issues, and possible health risks.
Radio Signal Interference Because wireless devices operate using radio signals, the
potential for two signals to interfere with each other exists. Virtually any wireless device
can be a source of interference for other devices.
Several common office devices emit signals that may interfere with the receivers in a WLAN.
These devices include microwave ovens, elevator motors, and other heavy electrical equip-
ment, such as manufacturing machines, photocopiers, certain types of outdoor lighting sys-
tems, theft protection systems, and cordless telephones. These may cause errors to occur in
the transmission between a wireless device and an access point. In addition, Bluetooth,
WLAN 802.11b/g/n, and ZigBee devices can all operate in the same radio frequency, poten-
tially resulting in interference between such devices in spite of efforts to design these radios
to automatically avoid interference.
Interference is nothing new for a computer data network. Even when using cables to connect
network devices, interference from fluorescent light fixtures and electric motors can some-
times disrupt the transmission of data. The solution for wireless devices is the same as that
for standard cabled network devices: locate the source of the interference and eliminate it.
This can usually be resolved by moving a photocopier or microwave oven across the room
or to another room. Most wireless devices can identify that an error has occurred in the
transmission and retransmit the data as necessary.

Outside interference from AM or FM radio stations, TV broadcast
stations, or other large-scale transmitters is not an issue because
they operate on vastly different frequencies and power levels. How-
ever, global positioning system (GPS) and satellite transmissions can
sometimes affect Bluetooth and WLAN transmissions outdoors.
Security Because a wireless device emits radio signals that can cover a wide area, security
becomes a major concern. It is possible for an intruder to be lurking outdoors with a laptop
computer and a wireless NIC with the intent of intercepting the signals from a nearby wire-
less network. Because much of a business’s network traffic may contain sensitive informa-
tion, this is a real concern for many users.
However, some wireless technologies can provide added levels of security. A special coded
number can be programmed into an authorized wireless device, which must then transmit
this special number prior to gaining access to the network; otherwise, it is denied access.
Network managers can also limit access to a wireless network by programming it with a
list of approved wireless devices. Only those devices on the list will be allowed access. As a
further protection, data transmitted between the access point and the wireless device is often
encrypted in such a way that only the recipient can decode the message. If an unauthorized
user were to intercept the radio signals being transmitted, he or she could not read the mes-
sages being sent.
Wireless networks are subject to jamming attacks that are difficult to locate and deal with
without the proper troubleshooting tools. Rogue APs can be connected to a wired network
by employees and can represent a significant security risk for companies. Fortunately,
enterprise-class wireless equipment today provides many options for detecting and dealing
with these types of threats.
Health Risks Wireless devices contain radio transmitters and receivers that emit radio
frequency (RF) energy. Typically, these wireless devices emit low levels of RF energy while
being used. Scientists know that high levels of RF can produce biological damage through
heating effects (this is how a microwave oven is able to cook food). However, it is not
known if lower levels of RF can cause adverse health effects. Although some research has
been done to address these questions, no clear picture of the biological effects of this type
of radiation has been found to date.
Most wireless devices also emit very low levels of RF energy when in
stand-by mode. These levels are considered insignificant and do not
appear to have health consequences.
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Communica-
tions Commission (FCC) set policies and procedures for some wireless devices, such as cellu-
lar telephones. However, only the World Health Organization (WHO) currently conducts
and sponsors research on this topic. In May 2011, the WHO issued a warning that wireless
devices can be “carcinogenic” but also included a statement that no clear adverse health
effects had been directly linked to cancer or other biological problems in human beings.
The announcement was more specifically directed at users of cellular handsets, which place

the transmitter antenna very close to the head during a call. One of the ways to alleviate
this danger is to always use a headset when talking on a cellular device.
The FCC and FDA, along with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), established RF
exposure safety guidelines for wireless phones back in 1996. Before a wireless phone is
available for sale to the public, it must be tested by the manufacturer and certified that it
does not exceed specific limits. One of the limits is expressed as a Specific Absorption Rate
(SAR). SAR relates to the measurement of the rate of absorption of RF energy by a wireless
phone user. The FCC requires that the SAR of handheld wireless phones not exceed
1.6 watts per kilogram, averaged over 1 gram of tissue.
Science today does not yet permit us to draw a definitive conclusion about the safety of
wireless mobile devices. Although there is no proof that using mobile wireless devices has
adverse health effects, it is wise to be aware of the possibility and monitor ongoing scientific
research.
Chapter Summary
■Wireless communications has become ubiquitous today and is quickly becoming the
standard in the business world. Remote wireless Internet connections and entire wire-
less computer networks are making many network-based business activities faster and
more convenient.
■There are many different types of wireless networks and devices. Home users can
implement WLANs to connect different devices. Bluetooth and WiGig are being
implemented on consumer devices, making it possible to connect many different types
of home audio and video equipment over short distances. WLANs are also becoming
the standard in business networks. Fixed broadband wireless is used to transmit data
at various distances, and satellite transmissions can send data around the world. Digi-
tal cellular networks are used to transmit data at speeds over 100 Mbps.
■Wireless wide area networks enable companies of all sizes to interconnect their offices
without the high cost charged by telephone carriers for their landline connections.
■RFID and NFC short-range wireless technologies have revolutionized counting inven-
tory, item identification, and payment systems, using electronic tags that can store and
transmit far more information than the traditional barcode systems. NFC enables two
NFC-equipped devices to communicate with each other for a wider range of functions
than what is provided by reading a tag.
■Digital convergence refers to the fact that data networks today carry digitized audio
(voice and music), video, and graphics in addition to other types of data. Many of
today’s wireless communications technologies play an important part in enabling digi-
tal convergence, with smartphones, tablets, and computers being able to provide VoIP
(voice) and video calls, as well as stream music, movies, and TV programs from the
Internet over many types of wireless connections.
■Mobility—the ability to move around without being connected to the network by a
cable—is the primary advantage of a WLAN. Other advantages include easier and less
expensive installation, increased network reliability, and support for disaster recovery.

■There are some challenges to a WLAN. Radio signal interference, security issues, and
health risks may slow down the growth of these technologies for a while, but there are
so many advantages that use of wireless data will very likely continue to grow and to
be an integral part of our lives.

Real-World Exercises
Tenbit Wireless Inc. (TWI) is a company consisting of 50 wireless networking specialists who
assist organizations and businesses with network planning, design, implementation, and prob-
lem solving. You have recently been hired by TWI to work with one of its new clients,
Vincent Medical Center (VMC), a large healthcare facility, concerning their wireless needs.
Each day, doctors and nurses throughout VMC’s facility attend to patients, update medical
records, issue prescriptions, and order medical exams. VMC has deployed a sophisticated
suite of medical software that stores all patient records, exam results, and diagnoses. The sys-
tem is also fully integrated with VMC’s pharmacy and can process purchase orders, payments,
and receipts as well as inventory and shipments, and it meets the tightest patient information
protection regulations established by the federal government.
Exercise 1-1
VMC is interested in learning about the possibilities of upgrading its infrastructure and
deploying a wireless network to allow doctors, nurses, and all staff members to access infor-
mation from anywhere within the medical facility (two buildings). VMC does not want to
spend money installing additional network cabling connections to every patient room.
VMC has asked you to make a presentation to its administrator regarding the use of a
WLAN. Create a presentation to deliver to the staff about WLANs. Be sure to cover the fol-
lowing points:
●
Greater mobility for doctors and nurses
●
Ease and cost of installation
●
Easier network modifications
●
Increased network reliability
●

Exercise 1-2
VMC would like to know about potential interference that medical equipment such as X-ray
machines and CT and MRI scanners might cause on the WLAN, or vice versa. Prepare a
report to present to the hospital administrators addressing their concerns.
Exercise 1-3
After your presentation, the physicians and nurses seem very interested in the potential of
the WLAN. However, VMC also has an outdated telephone system that provides mobile
cordless handsets but is no longer supported by the manufacturer. Without the ability to
use voice communications from anywhere in the facility, the staff cannot see how a wireless
network alone will solve their dilemma. Create a presentation that expands on your first one
and proposes a solution based on the existing WLAN.
Exercise 1-4
Although some doctors have laptop computers already equipped with wireless NICs, VMC
is also interested in providing other staff members with portable data communication equip-
ment, but at a lower cost than laptops. The devices should be able to transmit prescriptions
directly to the central system. The pharmacy would then deliver medications to patients
right away. VMC would also like to be able to check on the status of these pharmacy
orders. VMC administrators have asked your opinion regarding using smartphones on the
WLAN or tablet computers, and they have told you that their software can handle these
requirements through a web server. Prepare to present your recommendations to VMC’s
management team.

Consider the cell phone or smartphone that may now be in your pocket or sitting on
your desk. If you were to take that phone apart, you would find an array of pieces: chips, a
microphone, a speaker, resistors, capacitors, and other parts. Yet much more than just the
phone hardware is needed to complete a call. Some of the other elements involved are the
cellular towers, the equipment that manages your call as you move from one cell to another,
and all the equipment at the telephone company’s central office that directs your call to the
correct recipient. Moreover, if you’re calling someone overseas, additional equipment, such
as satellites or underwater cables, may be used to complete the international connection.
Trying to make sense of a modern communications system is truly mind-boggling because of
the sheer number of components that are involved. How can we begin to understand how it
all works?
One approach is the bottom-up method, which looks first at the individual elements or com-
ponents that make up a system, then ties them all together to show how the system works.
This chapter uses the bottom-up approach to set the foundation for our exploration of wire-
less communications and networks. You will apply the concepts covered in this chapter to
the technologies that will be discussed in later chapters. If you are studying or working in
the IT field, you already know how data is represented inside a computer or digital device.
In this chapter, you will learn how the various types of wireless signals are used to transmit
data. Finally, we’ll delve a little deeper into how data is transmitted using radio waves.
To keep things simple and short, we will use the American Standard Code for Information
Interchange (or ASCII code), which uses only 8 bits to represent all the letters of the alpha-
bet, all the numerals, and several symbols. You can easily find ASCII tables on the web
showing the hexadecimal value for all the characters and symbols.
Recall that all numbers—such as street-address numbers or any other numbers that are not
intended to be used by the computer in calculations—are stored as text (i.e., as character data,
without numerical value). In this case, the number is stored in a computer’s memory in binary,
using ASCII code. For example, the decimal value 47 is normally stored as its binary equivalent
(00101111) in the computer memory. When using ASCII code, a decimal number 4 is stored as
hexadecimal 34 (0x34), which uses 1 byte (00110100 in binary); and the number 7 is stored in
another byte in the computer memory using the ASCII code 0x37 (00110111 in binary).
A limitation of ASCII is that there are not enough unique codes for
all the symbols used by international languages. When 1 bit out of
every byte is used for error control (parity), the ASCII code can only
represent 128 different characters. Another coding scheme, called
Unicode, is the standard that is used today. Unicode can represent
65,535 different characters because it uses 16 bits, or 2 bytes, instead of 8 bits, or a single
byte, to represent each character. This means that Unicode covers all of the different lan-
guages and scripts, such as Arabic, Japanese, and Chinese characters.
Wireless Signals
Wired communications use either copper wires or fiber-optic cables to send and receive
data. Wireless transmissions, of course, do not use these or any other visible media.
Instead, data signals travel on electromagnetic waves. All forms of electromagnetic

energy—gamma rays, radio waves, even light—travel through space in the form of waves.
The light from a flashlight or the heat from a fire also moves through empty space as
waves. These waves, known as electromagnetic (EM) waves, don’t require any special
medium (such as air) or any type of conductor (such as a copper wire or optical fiber).
Instead, wireless signals travel freely through empty spaces at the speed of light, or about
186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second.
Practically everything in the universe either emits or absorbs electromagnetic radiation.
Figure 2-1 illustrates the electromagnetic spectrum and compares each of the properties of
electromagnetic radiation—such as the length of an electromagnetic wave—with the sizes
of some common objects and items. The middle portion of the figure shows the commonly
used names for these waves, and the bottom portion shows the range of frequencies—that
is, how many waves occur in 1 second—along with where these waves usually originate.
For example, in the visible light emitted by a light bulb, the number of waves that occur
in 1 second is higher than 1013, and each wave is about the size of a bacteria—that is,
3.281  10–6 feet (0.000001 meters). In this chapter, you will learn about the properties
of electromagnetic waves and the significance they have in wireless data communications.
There are two basic types of waves by which wireless data is sent and received: infrared
light and radio waves.

Many people, when asked what type of medium is used to send and
receive wireless transmissions, answer “airwaves.” If this were the
case, radio signals would not propagate in space, where there is no
air. Wireless transmissions use electromagnetic (EM) waves as the
medium, not air or empty space.

Infrared Light
For centuries, flashes of light have been used to transmit information. Bonfires set on top
of hills were once used to relay messages. Ocean vessels sent signals from ship to ship or
from ship to shore using light. In 1880, Alexander Graham Bell demonstrated an inven-
tion called the photophone, which used light waves to transmit voice information. Trans-
mitting modern computer or network data using light follows the same basic principle.
Because computers and data communications equipment use binary code, it is easy to trans-
mit information with light. Just as binary code uses only two digits (0 and 1), light has only
two properties (off and on). Sending a 1 in binary code could result in a light quickly flashing
on; sending a 0 could result in the light remaining off. For example, the letter A (ASCII 0x41
or 01000001) could be transmitted by light as off-on-off-off-off-off-off-on. This concept is
illustrated in Figure 2-2.

Transmitting a message using visible light
What type of light should be used to transmit these signals? Transmitting data using visible
light flashes, such as a strobe light, would be very unreliable because other sources of light
could be mistaken for the transmission signal or very bright light could wash out the light
flashes. In addition, some types of light can be invisible to the human eye and can be blocked
by various kinds of obstacles—fog, heavy rain, walls, etc.—and are therefore not a reliable
medium for data transmissions.
Visible light is only one type of light. All the different types of light that travel from the Sun to
the Earth make up the light spectrum, and visible light is just a small part of that entire spec-
trum. Some of the other forms of energy on both sides of the visible light portion of the spec-
trum, such as ultraviolet rays, are invisible to the human eye. Infrared light, some of which is
also invisible, has many of the characteristics that visible light has because it is adjacent to vis-
ible light on the light spectrum. Yet, it is a much better medium for data transmission because
it is less susceptible to interference from other sources of light, except for infrared light itself.
Each wavelength within the spectrum of visible light represents a
particular color. Differing wavelengths of light waves bend at differ-
ent angles when passed through a prism, which in turn produces dif-
ferent colors. The colors that visible light produces are red (R),
orange (O), yellow (Y), green (G), blue (B), indigo (I), and violet (V).
Visible light is sometimes referred to as ROYGBIV.

Infrared wireless systems require that each device have two components: an emitter,
which transmits a signal, and a detector, which receives the signal. (These two compo-
nents are almost always combined into one device.) An emitter is usually a laser diode
or a light-emitting diode (LED). Infrared wireless systems send data by the intensity
of the light wave instead of whether the light signal is on or off. To transmit a 1, the
emitter increases the intensity of the electrical current and, consequently, the intensity
of the infrared light, which indicates a pulse to the receiver. The detector senses the
higher-intensity pulse of light and produces a proportional electrical current (see
Figure 2-3).

Infrared wireless transmission can be either directed or diffused. A directed transmission
requires that the emitter and detector be directly aimed at one another and not blocked by
a solid object. This is called the line of sight principle and is shown in Figure 2-4. The emit-
ter sends a narrowly focused or thin beam of infrared light. The detector has a small receiv-
ing or viewing area. A television remote control, for example, uses directed transmission,
and this is the reason that most of us point the remotes at TV sets or other remote-
controlled devices.

Although TV remote controls generally use directed transmission,
with a fresh set of batteries you should be able to point the remote
at a white or light colored wall directly across from the TV set and
use it to change channels, increase the volume, etc.—as long as
nothing else is blocking the path of the invisible infrared light.
A diffused transmission relies on reflected light. With diffused transmissions, the emitters
have a wide-focused beam instead of a narrow beam. For example, the emitter might be
pointed at the ceiling of a room and use it as a reflection point. When the emitter transmits
an infrared signal, the signal bounces off the ceiling and fills the room with the signal. The
detectors are pointed at the same reflection point as the emitter and can detect the reflected
signal, as shown in Figure 2-5.

Diffused infrared transmission
Infrared wireless systems have several advantages. Infrared light neither interferes with other
types of communications signals (such as radio signals) nor is it affected by other signals,
except light. In addition, because infrared light does not penetrate walls, the signals are con-
fined to the inside of a room that is surrounded by walls. This makes it impossible for some-
one elsewhere to listen in on the transmitted signal.
However, there are several serious limitations to infrared wireless systems. The first limitation
involves the lack of mobility. Directed infrared wireless systems use a line-of-sight principle,
which makes it challenging for mobile users because the alignment between the emitter and
the detector would have to be continually adjusted. The second limitation is the range of cov-
erage. Directed infrared systems, which require line of sight, cannot be placed in an environ-
ment where there is the possibility that anything could get in the way of the infrared beam
(such as someone standing in front of your remote control while you are trying to change
TV channels). This means that devices using infrared transmissions must be placed close
enough to one another to eliminate the possibility of something moving between them. Due

to the angle of deflection, diffused infrared can cover a range of only about 50 feet
(15 meters), and because diffused infrared requires a reflection point, it can only be used
indoors. These restrictions limit the range of coverage.
Another significant limitation of an infrared system is the speed of transmission. Diffused
infrared can send data at maximum speeds of only 4 Mbps. This is because the wide angle
of the beam loses energy as it reflects and spreads around the room (this is called attenua-
tion). The loss of energy results in a weakening of the signal. The weak signal cannot be
transmitted over long distances, nor does it have sufficient energy to maintain a high trans-
mission speed, resulting in a lower data rate.
Infrared also shares the limitations of visible light and heat. Light waves, for example, cannot
penetrate through most materials like wood or concrete, and heat rays are absorbed by most
objects, including human skin (we feel infrared waves as heat). Solid, opaque objects, and
even dust and humidity (water molecules in the atmosphere) can limit the distance that light
and infrared waves can travel (see Figure 2-6).

Limitations of light and heat waves
Because of these limitations, infrared wireless systems are generally used in specialized appli-
cations, such as data transfers between laptop computers, digital cameras, handheld data col-
lection devices, and other similar mobile devices. In the past, laptop computers were almost
always equipped with infrared interfaces, which often made it easy to connect to a printer
without using cables; sadly, this is no longer true. (Wireless printer connections are now
implemented primarily via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, both radio wave technologies.)
A new system of transmitting data with light is Li-Fi. Created by
Prof. Harald Haas at the University in Edinburgh, it has achieved
data transmission speeds of 100 Gbps in laboratory experiments.
You will look at Li-Fi again in Chapter 12. In the meantime, you can

Some specialized wireless local area networks are based on the infrared method of transmit-
ting data signals. These are used in situations where radio signals would interfere with other
equipment, such as in hospital operating rooms, or when security is a concern, such as in
some government and military installations.
Is there a wave in the electromagnetic spectrum that does not have the distance and line-of-sight
limitations of light or infrared? The answer is yes: radio waves.
Radio Waves
The second means of transmitting a wireless signal is by using radio waves (sometimes called
radiotelephony). Radio waves provide the most common and effective means of wireless
communications today.
To get an idea of how radio waves behave and begin to understand many of their properties,
imagine the surface of a smooth pond of water. If you press down on the water with the palm
of your hand, or throw a rock in the middle of the pond, you will cause a disturbance that will
result in a series of continuously expanding circles. As the water moves up and down at the
point where your hand pushed it down or the rock hit the surface of the water, more circles
will appear, until the water stabilizes and the waves stop. As the waves expand away from the
point where the water is moving up and down, the energy of the waves is dispersed into grow-
ing rings of waves, and the waves become smaller, lower than the waves at the center of the
disturbance, where the rock or your hand hit the water (see Figure 2-7). This loss of energy
and its result are also important concepts that you will learn more about later in this chapter.

The waves created in a pond have a shape that is similar to that of electromagnetic waves.
Although when you throw a rock in a pond you can only really see the top, or high peaks

of the waves created, in reality the waves extend below the surface of the water as well. At
the top of Figure 2-7, you see a graphic representing what the waves in the pond would
look like, if you could see them from the side. Recall that radio signals travel through empty
space or air in electromagnetic waves. Infrared light, visible light from a flashlight, and heat
from a fire also move through empty space or through the air in the atmosphere as waves.
With radio waves, an electric current passes through a wire, creating both magnetic and elec-
tric fields in the space around the wire. These fields radiate or move away from the wire and
produce electromagnetic waves. Radio waves, like light and heat waves, are electromagnetic
waves that occur in a particular range of frequencies. They move outward, away from the
wire, much like the waves you see when you throw a rock in a pond.
Radio waves, however, are free from some of the limitations that affect light and heat
(see Figure 2-8). Unlike heat waves, radio waves can travel great distances. Radio waves can
also penetrate most solid objects (with the exception of metallic ones), whereas light waves
cannot penetrate opaque or solid objects. We “see” visible light waves when they illuminate
something, and we can feel heat waves, but radio waves are invisible. You cannot see, feel,
touch, or smell them.

How Data Is Transmitted Using Radio Waves
Radio waves can be used to transmit data over long distances without the need for wires. The
method by which radio waves transport data involves several concepts that will help you to
better understand the technologies described in later chapters, how interference can affect
transmissions, about speed of transmission and reliability issues, and how it may be possible
to troubleshoot and resolve some of these problems. Understanding how radio waves transmit
data will also give you a basis for learning about more advanced wireless data transmission

technologies. We start by discussing the ways that analog and digital data can be transmitted
over radio waves.
Analog and Digital
Waves are continuous, meaning that their up and down movement keeps happening so long
as there is enough energy in the wave. An analog signal is one in which the waves vary
continuously—in other words, the waves have no breaks in them. Figure 2-9 illustrates an ana-
log wave. Audio, video, voice, and even light are all examples of analog signals. An audio
signal that contains a tone or a song is continuously flowing and doesn’t start and stop until
the tone is turned off or the song is over. Sound can also vary in pitch and intensity.
Figure 2-9
Analog wave (continuous signal)
Now, suppose that instead of throwing a rock in a pond, you were to press a momentary
switch on a flashlight to turn it on and off, as if you were transmitting a message in Morse
code. Ignoring for a moment that light is a wave, the resulting on-off pattern of light is similar
to a digital signal. A digital signal consists of discrete or separate pulses, as opposed to an ana-
log signal, which is continuous. A digital signal has numerous starts and stops, on and off—
like Morse code, for example, with its series of dots and dashes. Figure 2-10 illustrates a digital
signal.
Figure 2-10
Digital signal (discrete or separate pulses)
Computers operate using digital signals. If analog data, such as a video image or an audio
sound, needs to be stored on the computer, it must be converted into a digital format before
it can be stored and processed or interpreted by a computer.
There are various techniques used to convert the different types of
analog data to digital data. For CD-quality stereophonic music (two
channels), the analog signal is measured (sampled) at the rate of
44,100 times per second; each sample is then stored in a digital for-
mat, using a minimum of 16 bits per sample. Using a number of
other techniques, computers also compress digitized signals to minimize the total amount of
storage space or the amount of data that needs to be transmitted.

To transmit a digital signal over a telephone line or TV cable, which are analog media and
were not designed to carry a purely digital signal, a device known as a modem (MOdulator/
DEModulator) is used. A modem takes the distinct pulses of electricity that make up digital
signals from a computer and encodes them onto a continuous analog signal for transmission.
The process of encoding the digital signals (bits) onto an analog wave is called modulation.
The modem at the other end of the connection then reverses the process by receiving an ana-
log signal, demodulating it, which means extracting the bits from it, to convert them back
into a digital signal.
Frequency and Wavelength
The way in which a radio transmission circuit produces analog waves results in a different
number of radio waves happening each second. This is a property of radio waves called
frequency, that is, the number of times a complete wave cycle occurs each second. Each com-
plete wave cycle is composed of one top (positive) peak and one bottom (negative) peak, as
shown in Figure 2-11.
Voltage

Cycle 2
Cycle 3
1 Hz = 1 cycle per second

Figure 2-11

Although frequency is a measure of the number of complete wave cycles that occur in one sec-
ond, the shorter form hertz (Hz) is used when referring to the frequency of a wave, instead of
cycles per second. A radio wave that has 710,000 Hz means that its frequency is 710,000
cycles per second. Because of the high number of cycles in typical radio waves, metric prefixes
are always used when referring to their frequency. A kilohertz (KHz) is 1,000 hertz, a mega-
hertz (MHz) is 1,000,000 (1 million) hertz, and a gigahertz (GHz) is 1,000,000,000 (1 bil-
lion) hertz. The wave measured as 710,000 Hz is referred to as 710 KHz.
Depending on how many wave cycles happen in 1 second (the frequency), the positive and
negative peaks of the waves will be closer together or farther apart. This illustrates another
property of waves, called the wavelength, or the length of a wave. The wavelength is the dis-
tance between any point in one wave cycle and the same point in the next wave cycle. The
amplitude is the height of the wave from the starting point of the wave cycle to the maxi-
mum height of one of the peaks, either positive or negative. Figure 2-12 shows examples of
two waves with different frequencies but the same amplitude.

Two different frequencies; same amplitude
The top wave in Figure 2-12 has one cycle per second and the bottom one has three cycles
per second. Note how the peaks of the top wave are farther apart than the ones in the bot-
tom wave.
It is important to also notice that both the lower frequency waves and the higher frequency
ones alternate to the same maximum and minimum voltage (amplitude), and that a change
in voltage does not create a change in the frequency of a wave.
The wavelength is inversely proportional to the frequency, which
means that when the frequency is high, the wavelength is short and
the peaks are closer together, and when the frequency is low, the
wavelength is long and the peaks are farther apart.
Frequency applies to music as well, since sound is an analog wave of air
disturbances, in the form of air pressure. The frequency of the musical
note A4, for example, is 440 Hz. This means that when the note A4 is
played, 440 air pressure waves impact your eardrum each second.
To transmit information, radio transmitters use what is known as a carrier wave. When you
want to listen to a radio station, you tune the receiver to the frequency of the carrier wave.
The carrier wave has a fixed frequency, and the data to be transmitted is modulated onto it
40
Chapter 2

before the signal is transmitted. In Chapter 3, you will learn more about transmitters and
receivers. Before the information is modulated onto the carrier, it is simply a continuous
wave (CW) of constant amplitude (measured in volts) and frequency. The CW is also com-
monly called an oscillating signal or sine wave. A CW carries no useful information by itself.
Technically speaking, only after data, such as music, voice, or digital signals, is modulated
onto a wave can we correctly refer to it as a carrier. However, when discussing waves used
in radio transmission, it is common to refer to them as a carrier waves, even though they
may not have any information modulated onto them.
In electrical terminology, a continuously varying sine wave produces
what is known as an alternating current (AC) because it flows
between negative (−) and positive (+). AC is the type of current that
runs to the electrical outlets in a house, and in North America it has
a frequency of 60 cycles per second. Direct current (DC) is found in
batteries. With DC, the current flows only in one direction, from the negative terminal (−) to
the positive (+), and its voltage is static. The lack of up and down movement in DC also
means that the power in a battery, for example, cannot be transmitted through empty space
or a vacuum and because of this, DC cannot carry any information.
As you may know, radio waves are usually transmitted and received using an antenna. An
antenna is a length of copper wire, or other electrically conductive material, with one end
free and the other end connected to a receiver or transmitter. When transmitting, the radio
waves created by the electronic circuit of the transmitter are fed to this antenna wire. This
sets up an electrical pressure (voltage) along the wire, which causes a small electrical current
to flow into the antenna. Because the current is alternating, it flows back and forth in the
antenna at the same frequency as the radio waves. When the electricity moves back and forth
in the antenna, it creates both a magnetic field and an electrical field around the antenna,
perpendicular to each other, as illustrated in Figure 2-13. The continuous (analog) electrical
pressure, the signal coming out of the transmitter, generates more waves, which move away
(propagate) from the antenna the same way that water waves move away from the point of
impact when you throw a rock in a pond. The result is an electromagnetic (EM) wave.

Antennas are also used to “pick-up” transmitted radio signals. An extremely small amount of
electricity moves back and forth in the receiving antenna in response to the radio signal (EM
wave) reaching it. This results in a very small amount of current flowing from the antenna
into the receiver, as shown in Figure 2-14. In Chapter 3, you will learn what needs to be
done to this small current so that the receiver can demodulate it and retrieve the data that
was encoded onto the wave when it was transmitted.

Transmission Speed
Several different terms are used when referring to the transmission speed of radio waves. The
electromagnetic waves themselves always travel at the speed of light, which is 186,000 miles
(300,000 kilometers) per second. When digital information is transmitted using radio waves,
the speed of transmission is usually shown in bits per second (bps), since the primary concern
is how efficiently the data can be moved from one place to another.
Another term used in measuring the speed of radio transmission is baud rate. Recall that
radio transmissions send out a carrier signal and that this signal can be changed or modu-
lated with some kind of information. A baud is a change in that signal, and every time the
signal changes, as you will learn later in this chapter, it defines the boundary of a signal
unit. Baud rate, then, refers to the number of signal units (changes) per second that are
required to represent the bits transmitted. The fewer signal units required per second the eas-
ier it will be to demodulate it and retrieve the information stored in the wave. However, this
usually also means that fewer bits can be transmitted every second.
Sometimes the terms bps and baud rate are used interchangeably, although they are not syn-
onymous. This confusion originated with early computer modems. The first modems, for
example, had speeds of 300, 600, and 1,200 baud. These early modems used a simple modu-
lation technique and were capable of transmitting one signal unit per bit transmitted; there-
fore, their speed in bps was the same as the baud rate, or 300, 600, and 1,200 bps. For exam-
ple, to transmit the letter U (0x55 ASCII or 01010101), it would take eight signal changes,
one for each bit. Thus, the number of bits transmitted per signal unit (baud) was 1.
However, with later modems, it became possible to have a change in signal (a baud) repre-
sent more than 1 bit. A signal can be changed in several different ways, as described later in
this textbook. In Table 2-1, each different change represents a combination of two bits.

Table 2-1
Bit representation of four signal changes
The letters in Table 2-1 are simply used to differentiate between four types of signal changes.
As an example, the most advanced telephone line modems transmit at a maximum rate of
4,800 baud (4,800 changes per second), which is the maximum number of signal changes
that a typical phone line can support. However, because each change represents more than 1
bit, along with compression of the data, these modems can transmit data at speeds of up to
33,600 bps and receive data at up to 56,200 bps (56 Kbps modems).
56 Kbps capable modems are a little different from 33.6 Kbps modems
in that one end of the connection must be a digital connection. To
achieve 56 Kbps download speed, the signal conversion from analog
to digital or from digital to analog must only happen at one end of the
phone line. Because of this limitation, these modems achieve a down-
stream speed of 56 Kbps. The maximum speed from the modem side, or upstream, is 33.6 Kbps.
A signal change—that is, the change that is made to the signal that represents 2 bits—is
known as a dibit. When a signal change can represent 3 bits, it is called a tribit. If 16 differ-
ent signal changes are used, then 4 bits per signal unit can be represented (known as a
quadbit). These characteristics are summarized in Table 2-2.

Another term used when referring to transmission speed is bandwidth. Although this term is
used to refer to the maximum data transmission capacity in digital systems, this is accurate
only when referring to purely digital systems. Strictly speaking, in analog systems, bandwidth
is defined as the range of frequencies that can be transmitted by a particular system or medium.
In simple terms, bandwidth is the difference between the higher frequency and the lower
frequency. Consider that the human voice, both male and female, falls between the range of
300 and 3,400 Hz. The difference between the two frequencies (3,400 Hz minus 300 Hz) is

3,100 Hz, which happens to be the bandwidth of human voice that is transmitted in a tradi-
tional telephone system, which is analog.
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) modems usually transmit at speeds ranging
from a few hundred Kbps to 25 Mbps and higher on a telephone line,
at a distance of up to 2.5 miles (4 kilometers). The usable bandwidth of
the pair of copper wires in a modern phone line is about 1 MHz. DSL
takes advantage of the higher frequencies that can be transmitted on a
phone line but that are not used for voice (above 4,000 Hz); it divides these into a large number of
separate frequencies and transmits data bits at a few bps over several of them at the same time,
resulting in the higher data rates described earlier. Full coverage of DSL technology is beyond the
scope of this book, but later chapters cover technologies that work in a very similar fashion.
Analog Modulation
Recall that the carrier signal sent in analog radio transmissions is simply a continuous electri-
cal signal. It carries no information and is more correctly referred to as a CW. Only after
information is added to it by modulation should it be called a carrier. Analog modulation is
the representation of analog information by an analog signal. There are three basic types of
modulation that can be applied to an analog signal to enable it to carry information: the
height of the signal, the frequency of the signal, and the relative starting point, or phase, of
the signal. Let’s look at each type of modulation separately.
The height, frequency, and relative starting point of a signal (phase)
are sometimes called the “three degrees of freedom.”
Amplitude Modulation (AM) The height of a wave, known as the amplitude, can be
measured in volts (electrical pressure). This is illustrated in Figure 2-15 with a typical sine
wave. In amplitude modulation (AM), the height of the wave is changed in accordance
with the height of another analog signal, called the modulating signal. In the case of an
AM radio station, the modulating signal is the voice of the announcer or the music, which
are also analog signals. The carrier wave’s frequency and phase remain constant.

Amplitude modulation is used by AM broadcast radio stations. Because pure AM is very
susceptible to interference from outside sources, such as lightning, it is not generally used
by itself for data transmissions. Figure 2-16 shows a modulating wave, a carrier wave, and
the resulting waveform after the modulation process, on the bottom. Note that the shape
of the top of the modulated signal is the same as that of the modulating wave. At the bot-
tom, the shape is also the same but is inverted (upside down) forming a kind of “envelope”
or channel. In addition, note that there is no change in the frequency of the carrier wave.

Amplitude modulation
Frequency Modulation (FM) In frequency modulation (FM), the number of waves
that occur during 1 second undergoes change based on the amplitude of the modulating sig-
nal, while the amplitude and the phase of the carrier remain constant. Figure 2-17 illustrates
an FM signal and a simple modulating sine wave (top graphic). The bottom portion of the
figure shows the result of modulating the FM carrier in frequency. Note how the frequency
of the modulated wave changes proportionally, based on the change in amplitude of the
input signal, which effectively allows the receiver to reproduce the modulating signal with
the correct amplitude (or the volume) of the sound. The rate of change of the modulated sig-
nal (the frequency) follows the rate of change of the input, or modulating signal, which, in
turn, allows the receiver to reproduce the frequency (pitch or tone) at the output. The last
characteristic of the wave that also needs to be encoded in the modulated wave is the

polarity (positive or negative) of the input signal. This is represented by the change in the
frequency of the carrier. As you can see in the figure, when the polarity of the modulating
signal is positive, the frequency of the modulated wave is high. Conversely, when the polar-
ity of the modulating signal is low, the frequency of the modulated wave is low.

Frequency modulation
Like amplitude modulation, frequency modulation is often used by broadcast radio stations.
However, FM is not as susceptible to interference from outside sources and is most commonly
used to broadcast high fidelity (Hi-Fi) music. In addition, an FM carrier has a wider band-
width, which allows it to carry stereophonic signals, with two separate sound channels.

Phase Modulation (PM) In contrast to AM, which changes the amplitude of a wave,
and FM, which changes the frequency of a wave, phase modulation (PM) changes the start-
ing point of the wave cycle, relative to or with reference to the starting point of the previous

wave cycle, while the amplitude and frequency of the carrier remain constant. Phase modu-
lation is not generally used to modulate analog input signals.
A signal composed of sine waves has a phase associated with it. This phase is measured in
degrees, and one complete wave cycle spans 360 degrees. A phase change is always mea-
sured with reference to the wave cycle that happened immediately before. PM systems
always use the previous wave cycle as the reference signal. Figure 2-18 shows an example
of four different phase shifts with respect to a reference signal shown at the top of the fig-
ure, to illustrate changes in phase.

Although radio broadcasts use either amplitude modulation (AM) or
frequency modulation (FM), television broadcasts actually use AM,
FM, and phase modulation (PM). Analog television transmissions use
amplitude modulation, the sound uses frequency modulation, and
the color information uses phase modulation.
Digital Modulation
How can digital data be transmitted by an analog carrier signal when the medium used for
transmission cannot be used with digital signals? The simple answer is that it can be done
by modulating the analog signal or changing it to represent a 1 bit or a 0 bit.

Modern wireless systems use digital modulation, which is the method of encoding a digital
signal onto an analog wave for transmission over a medium that does not support digital sig-
nals, such as the atmosphere or the vacuum of space. In an analog system, the carrier signal
is continuous, and amplitude, frequency, and phase changes also occur continuously because
the input or modulating signal is still analog and therefore continuous. However, in a digital
system that uses binary signals, the changes are distinct, which results in one of two states: a
1 or a 0, a constant positive or a constant negative voltage, on or off. For a computer to be
able to understand these digital signals, each bit must have a fixed duration to represent a
1 or a 0 (more on digital signals later). Otherwise, the computer would not be able to deter-
mine when one bit ends and another one begins.
There are four primary advantages of digital modulation over analog modulation:
●
It makes better use of the bandwidth available.
●
It requires less power to transmit.
●
It performs better when the signal experiences interference from other signals.
●
Its error-correcting techniques are more compatible with other digital systems.
With digital modulation, as with analog modulation, there are three basic changes that can be
made to the signal to enable it to carry information: the height, the frequency, and the relative
starting point (phase) of the signal. However, with the never-ending demand for faster trans-
mission speeds, more bits have to be crammed into the same number of wave cycles. Wireless
communication uses many different types of modulation. For the most sophisticated modula-
tions, it is practically impossible to show a graphic example of what the signals look like,
because of how complex the signal looks. This chapter covers a few basic methods of digital
modulation; these methods serve as the basis for more sophisticated modulation techniques.
Binary Signals Recall that with an analog signal the carrier wave alternates between
the positive and negative voltage in a continuous cycle—that is, it doesn’t stop. A binary
signal can alternate between positive and zero volts or between a positive and a negative
voltage. Data transmissions are typically sent in bursts of bits, meaning that some bits are
transmitted, then the transmission stops, then more bits are transmitted. The best way to
visualize this is that digital information sometimes has long strings of 0s and 1s and when
there are no bits to be transmitted, nothing is transmitted at all. In analog systems, even
when a radio station is not transmitting any sound, the carrier wave continues to be trans-
mitted; in this case, your radio receiver simply does not detect any modulation of the car-
rier and therefore does not extract the original signal. Consequently, the receiver does not
reproduce any sound even though the continuous carrier signal is still being transmitted
and received.
Three basic types of binary signaling methods are used to represent digital data. The return-
to-zero (RZ) technique calls for the signal to rise (the voltage to increase), for example, to
represent a 1 bit. In this case, a 0 bit is represented by the absence of voltage, or 0 volts.
This is illustrated in Figure 2-19. Notice that the voltage is reduced to 0 before the end of
the period for transmitting a 1 bit. The signal shape does not quite “fill” the bit period;
this transition of the signal in the middle of a bit period is used to synchronize the transmit-
ter and receiver.

Return-to-zero
The second method is known as the non-return-to-zero (NRZ) technique. With non-
return-to-zero, the voltage of the signal does not change for the entire length of the bit
period. When the next bit to be transmitted has the same binary value as the previous bit,
the signal does not change, remaining high for a 1 and low (0 volts or no voltage) for a 0.
This effectively reduces the number of signal transitions (baud) required to transmit the
message. As with RZ, there is no voltage when transmitting a 0 bit (see Figure 2-20) in this
particular example.

The final method, polar non-return-to-zero (polar NRZ), uses a positive voltage to represent
a 1 bit and changes the voltage to a negative value to represent a 0 bit. This technique is
more commonly referred to as non-return-to-zero-level (NRZ-L) because the signal never
returns to the 0 volts level. NRZ-L is illustrated in Figure 2-21.

The difference between NRZ and polar NRZ is that polar uses two
voltage levels, positive and negative.
A variation of NRZ-L is non-return-to-zero, invert-on-ones (NRZ-I). NRZ-I is used to
reduce the baud rate required to transmit a digital signal. In NRZ-I, a change in voltage
level represents a 1 bit, whereas no change in voltage level indicates that the next bit is a 0.
NRZ-I is illustrated in Figure 2-22.

Why are there so many binary signaling methods? Here are two important reasons:
●
Transmitters and receivers have a tendency to get out of synchronization with each
other. If the transmitter sends a long string of 1s or a long string of 0s, the lack of
transitions makes it difficult to keep both devices in sync. The transitions act like a
clock pulse that helps the two radios stay synchronized.
●
Digital electronic circuits tend to average the level of a signal that exhibits a lot
of transitions. The result is that the more transitions the signal has, the greater
the tendency of the circuit to average the amplitude of the signal, lowering it and
making it harder for a receiver to detect the voltage change and understand it as
a 0 or a 1. Using bipolar signals helps but does not eliminate the problem
completely.
While trying to minimize the number of transitions, we must also be concerned with having
enough of them to ensure good synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver.
The methods just described are the most basic ones that are employed when transmitting at
lower speeds. Several more sophisticated and complex methods of transmitting digital sig-
nals over wires and cables exist, but they are beyond the scope of this book. You will cer-
tainly learn about them in later, more advanced courses and books.
In digital modulation, there are three types of changes that can be made to the carrier to
enable it to carry information: the height of the signal (amplitude shift keying), the fre-
quency of the signal (frequency shift keying), and the relative starting point of the signal
(phase shift keying).
Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) Amplitude shift keying (ASK) is a binary modulation
technique similar to amplitude modulation in that the height of the carrier signal can be
changed to represent a 1 bit or a 0 bit. When a 1 bit and a 0 bit are transmitted, as with
amplitude modulation, ASK employs NRZ encoding. The presence of a carrier signal repre-
sents a 1 bit (positive voltage), whereas the absence of a carrier signal represents a 0 bit
(zero voltage). Figure 2-23 illustrates the letter A (ASCII 0x41 or 01000001) being transmit-
ted using ASK.

The signals for transmission using digital binary modulation are shown in Figure 2-23 as sine
waves because wireless transmissions use a medium (electromagnetic waves) that can only
support analog signals. Recall that the direct transmission of purely digital signals (discrete
pulses) can only be done using a medium that conducts electricity, such as copper wiring.
Transmitting in ASK as shown in Figure 2-23 is not common, because the presence of an
interference signal when there is no carrier being transmitted could be misinterpreted by the
receiver as a bit with a value of 1. ASK systems typically use two amplitude levels, so there
will always be a carrier wave present, making it easier for the receiver to differentiate between
the two bit values. The absence of a carrier needs to be understood by the receiver as no data
being transmitted at all, instead of a string of 0 bits. You will learn more about this in a later
chapter that discusses RFID and NFC.
Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) Similar to frequency modulation, frequency shift
keying (FSK) is a binary modulation technique that changes the frequency of the carrier
signal to represent different bit values. Because it is sending a binary signal, the carrier
signal does start and stop when the data transmission stops. As an example, when
using FSK, more wave cycles are needed to represent a 1 bit and, respectively, fewer
wave cycles represent a 0 bit. Figure 2-24 illustrates the letter A (ASCII 0x41 or
01000001) being transmitted using FSK. In this example, the number of wave cycles
used to represent a 1 bit is double that of the number of wave cycles used to represent
a 0 bit.

Phase Shift Keying (PSK) Phase shift keying (PSK) is a binary modulation technique,
similar to phase modulation, in which the transmitter varies the starting point of the wave.
The difference between PSK and phase modulation is that the PSK transmission starts and
stops, because the signal being encoded onto it is binary. Figure 2-25 illustrates the letter A
(ASCII 0x41 or 01000001) being transmitted using PSK.

Phase shift keying (PSK)
Notice that whenever a bit being transmitted changes from 1 to 0 (or 0 to 1), the starting
point (i.e., the direction of the wave) changes. For example, after the first 0 bit is represented
by a “normal” carrier wave cycle, the next bit is a 1 bit. However, instead of this being indi-
cated by another normal carrier wave cycle in which the signal goes into the positive range
(goes up on the sine wave), it starts by going into the negative range. The change in starting
point (going down instead of up) represents a change in the bit being transmitted (0 to 1).
In the preceding example, the change in the starting point of the wave means that the wave
will start moving in the opposite direction—in this case, 180 degrees from the original direc-
tion. Note that phase modulation can change the starting point at various points (angles), as
shown in Figure 2-26.

In this case, there are eight possible starting points for a signal (0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees,
135 degrees, 180 degrees, 225 degrees, 270 degrees, and 315 degrees), with each dot in the fig-
ure representing a different starting point. You will recall that to transmit a tribit (3 bits per sig-
nal change or baud), eight different signals are needed. Using phase modulation with 45-degree
angle changes results in eight different signal changes. In wireless communications today, phase
modulation is combined with amplitude modulation, which is easier for receivers to detect than
very small angles of phase change and this can provide 16 or more different signal changes.
In Figure 2-27, each dot represents a different signal change, for a total of 16 different
combinations that can be used to transmit quadbits. This technique of combining
amplitude and phase modulation is called quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).
Due to the potential complexity of the resulting signal, most graphical representations
of QAM only show the starting point of each wave with a dot. This representation is
called a constellation diagram.

In the presence of background electromagnetic noise (interference), receivers can detect a
phase change much more reliably than a frequency or amplitude change. Noise (inter-
ference) usually occurs as a spike or sudden change in the amplitude of the signal and can
also occasionally be detected as a change to a higher frequency at a particular point in the
wave, although the latter happens less frequently. Because the phase of a signal is always
referenced to the phase of the last wave cycle that was correctly detected, it is much less likely

that noise will occur at the same time in a wave and at an amplitude level that would make
the receiver detect it as a phase change; that’s because noise is random. These benefits make
PSK-based systems more attractive for high-speed digital wireless communications.
Figure 2-28 shows an approximate representation of the resulting waveform of this modu-
lation technique for sending a series of 10 bits. It would be practically impossible to visual-
ize this signal with any kind of electronic instrument, such as an oscilloscope. The graphic
in Figure 2-28 is only an approximation of what this type of signal would look like.

Spread Spectrum
Radio signal transmissions are, by nature, narrow-band transmissions. This means that each
signal transmits on one radio frequency or on a very narrow range of frequencies. An FM
broadcast radio station, for example, would require you to “tune the receiver to 90.3 MHz”
because this is the frequency at which it transmits. The next-lower frequency that listeners
would be able to tune to would be 90.1 MHz; and 90.5 MHz would be the station with the
next-higher frequency. This ensures that the station at 90.3 MHz can broadcast roughly
between 90.2 and 90.4 MHz without interfering with other stations. The actual bandwidth
used by FM stations is less than the difference between 90.2 and 90.4 MHz, allowing for some
unused “frequency space” between the highest frequency used by the next-lower station on the
FM band, the station you are tuned to, and the next station operating at a higher frequency.
Narrow-band transmissions are vulnerable to outside interference from another signal.
Another signal that is transmitted at or near the broadcast frequency—90.3, in this case—can
easily render the radio signal inoperable or make it difficult to detect and decode the informa-
tion contained in the signal.
Broadcast radio stations work effectively with narrow-band transmis-
sions because each station is allowed to transmit on only one
frequency in a specific area. Radio stations broadcast using high-
powered transmitters and use frequencies that are licensed by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States. In
contrast, Wi-Fi devices, for example, use the same frequency band but transmit at very low
power levels. This means that the signals have a short-distance useful range, helping to ensure
that minimum interference occurs.
An alternative to narrow-band transmission is spread spectrum transmission. Spread spec-
trum is a technique that takes a narrow-band signal and spreads it over a wider range of
Spread Spectrum

frequencies, as shown in Figure 2-29. Spread spectrum transmissions are more resistant to out-
side interference because any noise is likely to affect only a small portion of the signal instead
of the entire signal. As an analogy, although an accident in one lane of an eight-lane highway
slows down traffic and is very inconvenient, there are still seven other lanes that traffic can
use. Likewise, spread spectrum is more “resistant” to interference and consequently spread
spectrum transmission experiences fewer errors due to interference. Two common methods
used in spread spectrum transmissions are frequency hopping and direct sequence.

Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)
Instead of transmitting on just one frequency, frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) uses
a range of frequencies and changes the frequency of the carrier several times during the trans-
mission. With FHSS, a short burst of data is transmitted in one frequency, and then another
short burst is transmitted at another frequency, and so on until the transmission is completed.
Hedy Lamarr, a well-known film actress during the 1940s, and George
Antheil, who had experience synchronizing the sounds of music scores
with motion pictures, conceived the idea of frequency hopping spread
spectrum during the early part of World War II. Their goal was to keep
the Germans from jamming the equipment that guided U.S. torpedoes
against German warships. Lamarr and Antheil received a U.S. patent in 1942 for their idea.
Figure 2-30 shows how an FHSS transmission starts by sending a burst of data at the
2.44 GHz frequency for 1 millisecond. Then the transmission switches to the 2.41 GHz
frequency and transmits for the next millisecond. During the third millisecond, the trans-
mission takes place at the 2.42 GHz frequency. This continual switching of frequencies
takes place until the entire transmission is complete. The sequence of changing frequen-
cies is called the hopping code. In the example shown in Figure 2-30, the hopping code is
2.44–2.41–2.42–2.40–2.43. The receiving station must also know and follow the same hop-
ping code in order to correctly receive the transmission. The hopping codes are predefined
and are usually part of the standard that defines how the radio circuit will be designed and
56

implemented. Hopping codes can change so that multiple radios can each use a different
sequence of frequencies within the same area and never interfere with one another, but the
transmitter and receiver have to agree beforehand on which sequence to use.
Here is an analogy that may help you understand how FHSS works. Imagine that you and a
friend both speak the same five languages and you want to have a conversation that would be
difficult for other people around you to understand, since they do not speak the same lan-
guages, except possibly one of them. You agree before starting the conversation that you will
use a particular sequence of languages and will speak in each one of them for a few words at
a time. However difficult this may be to do, it would certainly accomplish your goal of not
allowing anyone else around to understand the entire conversation.

Frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)
If interference is encountered while transmitting with FHSS on a particular frequency, only a
small part of the message is lost. Figure 2-31 shows an example in which the second transmis-
sion has been affected by interference. Each block of data transmitted in FHSS is only about
400 bytes long. Typical FHSS systems can detect errors at the lower protocol layers and
request retransmission before passing the data to higher protocol layers. Transmitter and
receiver swap roles with each change of frequency, meaning that the transmitter becomes a
receiver and vice-versa. When an error is detected by the receiver, it informs the transmitter
during the next “slot” when it transmits back to the original transmitter. The original trans-
mitter will retransmit the same data that was received in error when they switch roles again,
using the next frequency, thus hopefully avoiding the interference from causing errors again.

FHSS error detection and retransmission
Some technologies make use of forward error correction
(FEC), a technique that sends redundant data to minimize the need
for retransmission of the messages. Error handling and error detec-
tion and correction at the lower protocol layers are discussed in
greater detail in later chapters.
Frequency hopping can reduce the impact of interference from other radio signals. An
interfering signal will affect the FHSS signal only when both are transmitting at the same
frequency and at the same time. Because FHSS transmits short bursts of data and switches
frequency, the extent of any interference will be very small, the error can be detected, and
the same portion of the message can be retransmitted quickly. FHSS signals also cause
minimal interference with other signals. To an unintended receiver, FHSS transmissions
appear to be of a very short duration (similar to noise), and unless the receiver knows the
exact hopping sequence of frequencies, it is also extremely difficult to eavesdrop on the
message.
A variety of devices use FHSS. Several of these devices are consumer-oriented products,
because FHSS devices are relatively inexpensive to manufacture. Cordless phones, including
multi-handset units, typically use FHSS. Bluetooth, which is covered in Chapter 5, also uses
FHSS.

Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)
Another type of spread spectrum technology is direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS).
DSSS uses an expanded redundant code to transmit each data bit and then a modulation
technique such as quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK). This means that a DSSS signal is
effectively modulated twice. The first step before transmission is shown in Figure 2-32. At
the top of the figure are two original data bits to be transmitted: a 0 and a 1.

Encoding before modulation in a DSSS transmission
Instead of simply encoding these two bits over a carrier wave for transmission, the value of
each data bit is first added to each individual 1 and 0 in a sequence of binary digits called a
Barker code. A Barker code (or chipping code) is a particular sequence of 1s and 0s that has
properties that make it ideal for modulating radio waves as well as for being detected cor-
rectly by the receiver. These 1s and 0s are called “chips” instead of bits to avoid confusing
them with the actual data bits. The chipping code is sometimes called a pseudo-random
code because it is usually derived through a number of mathematical calculations as well as
through practical experimentation.
The term Barker code is correctly used only when referring to 802.11
transmissions at 1 and 2 Mbps. When referring to most other
spreading codes used in DSSS-based systems—such as CDMA cellu-
lar phones—the terms pseudo-random code, PN code, spreading
code, and chipping code may be used interchangeably.
The result of the addition is the actual set of 1s and 0s (the chips) that will be modulated
over a carrier wave and transmitted (as seen in the bottom line of Figure 2-32). Let’s take
another look at how this sequence of chips is created. If a 1 bit is to be transmitted, then a
1 is added to each bit of the chipping code:

The adding of the chipping code and the specific value to be added
are arrived at by the Boolean operation of “exclusive or” (XOR) on a
bit-by-bit basis, which is equivalent to a modulo 2 addition. In mod-
ulo 2 addition, there is no carryover, which means that 1 + 1 5 0
and 1 is not carried over to the next digit to the left. Other than
that, a modulo 2 addition works exactly like a normal sum of two digits. See “Boolean Opera-
tions, XOR (Exclusive Or)” at www.cplusplus.com/doc/papers/boolean.html.
Instead of transmitting a single 1 or 0, a DSSS system transmits these combinations of chips.
The 11 chips are transmitted at a rate 11 times faster than the data rate; in other words, the
data rate does not change. However, the result of transmitting at a higher rate is the spread-
ing of the signal over a much wider bandwidth than that of the frequency channel being
used. In the case of Wi-Fi, to continue with the example given earlier, the signal is spread
11 MHz to each side of the center frequency of the channel and ends up occupying a total
bandwidth of 22 MHz. Figure 2-33 illustrates the results.

This spread signal has three important characteristics:
●
The frequency of the signal’s digital component (or chipping rate) is much higher than
that of the original data.
●
A plot of the signal’s frequency spectrum looks similar to random noise to narrow-
band receivers.
●
All the information contained in the original signal (a 0 bit or a 1 bit) is still there.
The most important aspect of this, however, is not the spreading of the signal but the fact
that the power level (amplitude), at any given frequency, has dropped significantly as a result
of spreading by using a chipping code at a higher rate than the data. In similar fashion to
FHSS, a DSSS signal appears to an unintended narrow-band receiver to be low-powered
noise, which is one major advantage of this method of transmission.
At the intended receiver, the signal is first demodulated and then de-spread. One of the tech-
niques the receiver uses to detect which bit was transmitted is to count the number of 0
chips. If the pattern of chips received contains six 0s, the value of the data bit is 1. Con-
versely, if the pattern contains six 1s, the value of the data bit is 0.
Another major advantage of using DSSS with a chipping code is that in conventional narrow-
band transmissions, any interference, even if it caused the loss of only 1 bit, would require
the entire message to be resent, which takes time. In DSSS, if there is any noise or other type
of narrow-band interference that may cause some of the chips to change value, the receiver
can employ statistical calculations—mathematical algorithms that are used to recover the
original data bit, thus avoiding the need for retransmission.
Devices that use DSSS are typically higher-end products because they are more expensive to
manufacture than FHSS systems, but they also have many advantages over FHSS, as previ-
ously described. Wi-Fi WLANs use DSSS along with products that interconnect networks
located in several buildings that comprise a campus setting, such as a school, a large corpora-
tion, a manufacturing plant, or a convention center.
FHSS and DSSS are not the only transmission techniques used for spread spectrum transmis-
sion. There are other techniques that are even more resistant to interference and to different
kinds of phenomena that can cause data loss or reduce the performance of this type of wire-
less transmission. Some of the techniques are based on variations of DSSS; others are
completely different. Later chapters of this book discuss some of the more sophisticated tech-
niques as well as the types of problems that can affect wireless transmissions.
Chapter Summary
■One of the character coding schemes, which uses the numbers from 0 to 127, is called
the ASCII. A character that will be stored in or transmitted by the computer is repre-
sented by its ASCII equivalent, then that number is stored as a hexadecimal value in
binary.
■Whereas traditional wired communications use copper wires or fiber-optic cables to
send and receive data, wireless transmissions do not use a visible medium. Instead,
they travel on electromagnetic waves. There are two basic types of waves by which
wireless signals are sent and received: infrared light and radio waves.

■Infrared light, which is next to visible light on the light spectrum, has many of the same
characteristics as visible light. Infrared wireless transmission can be either directed or
diffused. A directed transmission sends a narrowly focused beam of infrared light from
the emitter to the detector. A diffused transmission relies on reflected light.
■The second means of transmitting a wireless signal is by using radio transmission.
Radio waves provide the most common and effective means of wireless communica-
tions today. Radio waves have fewer limitations than light waves. Light does not go
through solid objects, whereas radio waves are able to penetrate most objects.
■Radio transmissions use a carrier signal, which is a continuous wave (CW) of constant
amplitude (voltage) and frequency. This signal is essentially an up-and-down wave
called an oscillating signal or sine wave. The carrier signal sent by analog radio trans-
missions is simply a continuous electrical signal that carries no information.
■The carrier signal can undergo three types of modulation (i.e., change) to enable it to
carry information: the height (amplitude) of the signal, the frequency of the signal,
and the relative starting point. Amplitude modulation (AM) changes the signal height.
Frequency modulation (FM) changes the number of wave cycles that occur in one
second. Phase modulation (PM) changes the starting point of the cycle.
■In digital modulation, there are also three types of changes that can be made to the
carrier to enable it to carry information: the height (amplitude) of the signal, the fre-
quency of the signal, and the relative starting point. Amplitude shift keying (ASK)
changes the height of the carrier to represent a 1 bit or a 0 bit. A carrier is transmitted
for a 1 bit, and no signal is transmitted for a 0 bit. Frequency shift keying (FSK) is
a modulation technique that changes the frequency of the carrier signal. Phase shift
keying (PSK) is a modulation technique similar to phase modulation. The difference
is that the PSK signal starts and stops because it is a binary signal.
■Radio station signals are by nature a narrow-band type of transmission, which
means that they transmit on one radio frequency or a narrow range of frequencies.
An alternative to narrow-band transmission is spread spectrum transmission. Spread
spectrum is a technique that takes a narrow signal and spreads it over a broader
portion of the radio frequency band.
■Spreading the signal over a wide range of frequencies and reducing the amplitude has
the advantage of making the signal look like noise to an unintended narrow-band
receiver, reducing the effects of interference.
■A common spread spectrum method is frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS).
Instead of sending on just one frequency, frequency hopping uses a range of frequencies
and changes frequencies during the transmission. Another spread spectrum method is
direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS). DSSS uses an expanded redundant code to
transmit each data bit.

Hands-On Projects
Project 2-1
In this project, you will write your name in both hexadecimal and binary.
1.
Search the web for an ASCII chart, then look up the hexadecimal ASCII value for each
of the letters of your last name. (Note that the ASCII table contains codes for both
uppercase and lowercase letters.) Here is what the author’s last name looks like in hexa-
decimal, with a dash placed between successive letters, to make it easier to read:
O–l–e–n–e–w–a ¼ 4F–6C–65–6E–65–77–61
2.
Convert each hexadecimal value to binary. The easiest way to do this is to break the
hexadecimal code for each character into two separate digits. In the case of an uppercase
O, this would be 4 and F. Each digit represents 4 bits out of 1 byte (also called a nibble).
3.
Convert each digit to its binary equivalent in the range 0000 (0x0) to 1111 (0xF). Put
the two groups of 4 bits together into a byte. For the purposes of this project, the most
significant bit, which is generally used for parity, will always be a 0.
4.
Write your full last name in binary. Again, use a dash between each group of 8 bits to
make it easier to read. Here is what the author’s last name looks like:
01001111–01101100–01100101–01101110–01100101–01110111–01100001
You will use these results in the following projects.

Project 2-2
This project helps you develop an appreciation for the topic of modulation
and what it takes to transmit data—analog or digital—over the wireless
medium. As you know, this book introduces many different wireless technolo-
gies that use various modulation techniques. In this project, you perform
amplitude modulation.
1.
In Figure 2-34, an analog input signal is shown at the top of the grid. To draw a wave
that is modulated in amplitude, begin by copying the input signal to the top two rows of
the grid shown in Figure 2-34. The goal is to create an “envelope” to guide you and
make it easier to draw the carrier wave, showing what it will look like after it is modu-
lated. Use a dashed line to draw the input signal.

2.
Complete the envelope by drawing a mirror-image (vertically inverted) version of the
input signal in the bottom two rows of the grid. Again, use a dashed line.
3.
You are now ready to draw the modulated carrier. Considering a carrier with a fre-
quency of 4 Hz, so that it will be easier to draw and visualize, draw a sine wave with
four complete cycles for each second. The wave must fit inside and follow the contour
of the envelope you created in the previous two steps. The frequency of the modulated
carrier must remain constant at 4 Hz for each 1-second interval on the grid. The high
and low peaks of the modulated carrier must reach all the way to the upper and lower
guides you just drew, the envelope.
4.
Check your results with your instructor, or see Figure 2-16 to make sure you got it right.

Project 2-3
As you have learned, digital modulation makes it possible to transmit a digital
signal using an analog medium such as an electromagnetic wave. In this proj-
ect, you draw a waveform to show how a digital signal can be encoded onto a
carrier using 1 bit per phase change (PSK).
1.
In Figure 2-35, a grid and an analog reference wave are shown without an input signal.
Input the binary ASCII code for the first letter of your last name in the spaces provided
at the top of the grid.
2.
The modulated carrier wave should have the same amplitude as the original carrier.
Begin at the 0 level indicated on the left side of the grid and draw a 4 Hz carrier to rep-
resent the first bit, a 0.
3.
At the end of the first second, continue drawing the carrier but change the phase if the
second most significant bit is a 1. If not, continue drawing the carrier at the same phase.
4.
Keep drawing the 4 Hz carrier wave, changing phase as required to show a change from
a bit with a value of 1 or 0.
5.
After you have drawn the carrier wave for all 8 bits of the ASCII code, compare your
results with Figure 2-35 to make sure it looks correct.

Exercise 2-1
Woodruff Medical has been approached by a vendor who is trying to sell it an infrared
WLAN for its office. Because the equipment is proprietary, the cost is quite high, and this
is one of their main concerns. Although none of the networking equipment will be placed
around sensitive medical equipment, the office manager prefers infrared because he believes
that other types of wireless networking equipment could interfere with the medical equip-
ment in another hospital campus building that is located about 125 meters away.
Exercise 2-2
Prepare a PowerPoint presentation outlining how infrared and radio wireless transmissions
work. This will be presented to the office manager, who is not technically inclined, and the
LAN manager, who has a strong technology background. Be sure to list the advantages and
disadvantages of both. The presentation should contain at least 10 slides. You will only
have 20 minutes to explain both technologies.
Exercise 2-3
After listening to your presentation, the office manager has several questions. One of the
questions involves wireless transmission speeds. The office manager wants to know how the
transmission speed compares between infrared and RF WLANs. For this, he wants a written
report instead of a presentation. Write a one-page summary regarding different transmission
speeds and the advantages and challenges of each technology. He also remembers the time
when he used a telephone modem to access the Internet and is very curious about the differ-
ence between bits-per-second and baud rate, so be sure to write a brief explanation for him.
Challenge Case Project
A local community college has contacted The Baypoint Group for information
about modulation for a networking class, and TBG has passed this request on
to you. Form a team of two or three consultants and research AM, FM, PM,
ASK, FSK, and PSK. Specifically, pay attention to how they are used, as well
as their strengths and weaknesses. Provide your conclusions regarding which of
these methods, or combination of methods, is now the dominant player in wireless data transmission
and why you think this is the case.

As you already learned, radio frequency (RF) communications is the most common
type of wireless communications. It comprises all types of radio communications that use
radio frequency waves, from radio broadcasting to wireless computer networks. In this
book, we focus primarily on wireless data communications.
Unlike light-based communications, which is also wireless and is briefly discussed in this
chapter, RF communications can cover long distances and is not always blocked by objects
in the path of the signal, as light-based communications can be. RF is also a mature commu-
nications technology, the first radio transmission having been sent well over 100 years ago.
RF communications can be very complex, but this chapter attempts to demystify the subject
to provide a very generic and simplified introduction to how RF transmitters and receivers
work. First, we explore the basic components of RF communications. Then, we look at the
issues regarding the design and performance of an RF system. Next, we explore the national
and international organizations that create, regulate, and promote standards, which are so
important, especially in the RF data communications field. These standards help ensure that
we can travel all over the planet and are able to maintain wireless data communications vir-
tually anywhere. Finally, we examine some of the issues around RF spectrum allocation.
Components of a Radio System
Several basic hardware components are common to all radio systems, even though the func-
tions of the radio systems themselves may vary. These components include filters, mixers,
amplifiers, and antennas. The first three are covered in this chapter. The fourth component,
antennas, is important enough to warrant a chapter of its own (Chapter 4), especially given
the accelerated growth of the wireless data communications field.
Filters
A filter does exactly what its name indicates: it filters RF signals to get rid of all the ones that are
not wanted. The world around us is filled with RF signals that cover virtually every frequency in
the electromagnetic spectrum (refer back to Figure 2-1). Most of these signals are generated by
transmission equipment, such as cellular phones, communications satellites, and radio and televi-
sion station transmitters; some reach us from outer space. After radio receivers have picked up
these RF waves that are “flying” around us, a filter sifts out the frequencies that we do not want
to receive. Think of a home-based water filter that removes particles and other impurities, or an
automotive oil filter that prevents large contaminants from reaching the engine while allowing
the oil itself to pass through. An RF filter either passes or rejects a signal based on the signal’s fre-
quency or range of frequencies. The block diagram symbol for a filter is shown in Figure 3-1.
Figure 3-1
Filter symbol
The block diagram symbols shown here are universal and are com-
monly used to illustrate radio frequency as well as microwave
components.

There are three basic types of RF filters: low-pass, bandpass, and high-pass. With a low-pass
filter, a maximum frequency limit or threshold is set and all signals below that value are
allowed to pass through, as shown in Figure 3-2.
Maximum threshold: 900 MHz
617 MHz

A high-pass filter has a minimum frequency threshold. All signals above this minimum
threshold are allowed to pass through, whereas those below the minimum threshold are
blocked. A high-pass filter is shown in Figure 3-3.

A bandpass filter, instead of having either a minimum or maximum frequency threshold, has
a range called a passband, which includes both a minimum and a maximum threshold. Only
those RF signals that fall within the passband are allowed through the bandpass filter. This is
shown in Figure 3-4.
Passband: 300 Hz to 3,400 Hz

Bandpass filter
Some of the figures depicting filters show multiple inputs, but a filter
typically has only a single input.
Filters are also found in transmitters, where they are used to eliminate unwanted harmonics.
This is because the process of modulating a signal generates additional oscillations that fall
outside of the range of frequencies that are going to be transmitted, called harmonics. The
way a filter functions in a transmitter is shown in Figure 3-5, which is a partial block dia-
gram. The input is the information that needs to be sent; it can take the form of audio,
video, or data. The transmitter takes the input data and modulates the signal (using either
analog or digital modulation) by changing the amplitude, frequency, or phase of the sine
wave, or in some cases, a combination of these modulation methods (see Chapter 2 if you
need to refresh your memory about RF signal modulation). The output from the modulation
process is known as the intermediate frequency (IF) signal; in the example shown in
Figure 3-5, this output includes the frequencies between 8 and 112 MHz. The IF signal is

then filtered through a bandpass filter to remove any undesired high-frequency or low-
frequency signals and produce an output with a frequency range of between 10 and
100 MHz, which is the signal to be transmitted. This is also done to prevent frequencies
that fall outside the transmission range from interfering with other transmitters operating in
an adjacent frequency range.

Mixers
The purpose of a mixer is to combine two frequencies, the input signal and the transmission
carrier frequency, and create a single output. The mixer symbol is shown in Figure 3-6. The
single output of a mixer is in the range of the highest sum and the lowest difference of the
two frequencies. In Figure 3-7, the input signal—the information to be transmitted—is
between 300 and 3,400 Hz, and the carrier frequency is 20 KHz (20,000 Hz).

In this example, 23,400 Hz is the highest sum. The mixer also determines the lowest differ-
ence between the input frequencies and the mixed-in frequency, for example:
20,000 Hz

300 Hz

In this example, the lowest difference frequency would be 16,600 Hz. Therefore, the output
from the mixer would be a signal with a frequency range between 16,600 and 23,400 Hz.
The sum and the difference are known as the sidebands of the frequency carrier because
they fall above and below the center frequency of the carrier signal.
One way to think about sidebands is by considering AM radio signals. AM broadcast radio
is confined to a frequency range of 535 to 1,605 KHz. In an AM broadcast radio signal, the
sidebands are typically 7.5 KHz wide, so a radio station on the AM dial uses a total of about
15 KHz of bandwidth to transmit a single audio channel or voice. An example of sidebands
is shown in Figure 3-8. In addition, there is always an unused range of frequencies below and
above the sidebands, which are used to further prevent interference between two adjacent
radio stations. These unused frequency spaces are called guard bands.

Mixers are used to convert an input frequency to a specific desired output frequency. For exam-
ple, let’s say that you wish to transmit data using an 800 MHz carrier. Figure 3-9 illustrates how
a mixer functions in a radio transmitter. The transmitter takes the input data and modulates the
signal to produce an IF signal. In this example, the output from the modulator is a range of
frequencies from 8 to 112 MHz, which also includes some undesirable harmonic frequencies.
This signal is then put through a bandpass filter to produce the desired IF signal range of 10 to
100 MHz. This IF signal then becomes the input to the mixer along with the desired carrier fre-
quency of 800 MHz. The output of the mixer is a signal with a frequency range between 698 and
903 MHz, which is finally run through another bandpass filter to remove any frequencies outside
the transmission range—in other words, those that fall outside the intended sideband limits.

Amplifiers
An amplifier increases the amplitude, or strength of an RF signal. Figure 3-10 shows the symbol
for an amplifier. The amplifier is one of the first stages in a radio receiver circuit and one of the
last stages in a transmitter (shown in Figure 3-9). Its function is to boost the power of the signal
received from the last filter stage before it is transmitted. Amplifiers are critical components in a
radio system because RF signals tend to lose intensity (amplitude) when they move through fil-
ters and mixers as well as when they travel through empty space in the form of electromagnetic
waves. Filters and mixers are passive devices, meaning that they do not add power to a signal;
instead, they take power away from the signal. Likewise, when an electromagnetic wave carry-
ing a modulated signal leaves the antenna and travels from the transmitter to the receiver
antenna, a large portion of its power is lost or attenuated (reduced in amplitude) when it is
absorbed by water particles in the air, walls, trees, and so on.
Figure 3-10
Amplifier symbol
The amplifier is called an active device, because unlike filters and mixers, it must be supplied
with electricity. Amplifiers use this electricity to increase the input signal’s intensity or
strength and then output an exact copy of the input signal at a higher amplitude.
Antennas
Finally, for an RF signal to be transmitted or received using electromagnetic waves, the trans-
mitter and receiver must have an antenna, the symbol for which is shown in Figure 3-11.
Table 3-1 shows the list of radio system components along with their functions and block
diagram symbols. Antennas will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4.

Design of a Radio System
Filters, mixers, amplifiers, and antennas are necessary components of all radio systems, but
designers also need to consider how the systems will be used. In radio signal broadcasting,
this may be as straightforward as determining the size and location of the antenna as well as
a signal that will be strong enough to cover a very large area. However, in a radio system that
incorporates two-way communications—for example, cellular phones connected via a wireless
network—there are other considerations, including multiple user access, transmission direc-
tion, switching, and signal strength.
Multiple Access
Because the number of frequencies available for radio transmission is limited, conserving the use
of frequencies is important. One way to do this is by sharing a particular frequency among mul-
tiple users, which reduces the number of frequencies needed. In Figure 3-12, a group of people is
using walkie-talkies, with everyone using the same frequency channel. If the three people on the
left transmit at the same time, the three on the right will not be able to understand the messages,
because the transmitters will interfere with each other and the people on the right will only
hear noise. The only way for all the users to share a channel is if they take turns transmitting.

Multiple access
Another example of multiple access is when employees of a company send multiple envelopes
or packages from one office to another office. All the envelopes and packages are shipped at
the same time and share space in the same courier truck on the same trip (multiple access).
When the courier truck arrives at the destination, the envelopes and packages are sorted and
delivered to their respective recipients.
Several methods allow multiple access. The most significant, in terms of wireless communica-
tions, are Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access
(TDMA), and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA).

Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) Frequency Division Multiple Acc-
ess (FDMA) divides the bandwidth of a frequency channel (a range of frequencies) into several
smaller frequency bands (narrower ranges of frequencies, or channels). For example, a transmis-
sion channel with 50 KHz of bandwidth can be divided into 100 channels, each with a band-
width of 500 Hz. Each channel can then be dedicated to one specific user. This concept is illus-
trated in Figure 3-13. FDMA is most often used with analog transmissions.

Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)
Another example of FDMA is analog cable television, although most
cable TV today is digital. In analog cable TV, all channels were trans-
mitted using FDMA over coaxial cable. Each analog television chan-
nel uses about 6 MHz of the 500 MHz bandwidth of the cable. All
of the TV channel signals, each in its own frequency, are transmitted
simultaneously on the same cable. At the TV receiver end, a user would select (or tune) the TV
set to a particular channel in order to view the programming (the TV tuner was essentially an
adjustable bandpass filter).
Think back to the example in Figure 3-12. If each of the three people on the left uses a dif-
ferent portion of the same frequency band by selecting a different channel on the walkie-
talkie and if each of the three people on the right select the same channel as the person
they want to speak with, the people on the left can transmit simultaneously and each of the
people on the right will receive the different transmissions intended for them.
One of the drawbacks of FDMA is that when signals are sent at frequencies that are
grouped closely together, occasionally signals from one frequency may encroach on its
neighbor’s channel frequency. This phenomenon, known as crosstalk, causes interference
on the other frequency channel and, in extreme cases, crosstalk can even cause image pro-
blems or you can hear sounds from a different frequency channel. Crosstalk was very com-
mon in old analog radios using FDMA, such as the early cellular phones. The digital tech-
nology used today has practically eliminated this type of problem.

Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) To overcome the problem of crosstalk,
Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) was developed. Whereas FDMA divides the band-
width into several frequencies, TDMA divides the transmission time into several slots. Each
user is assigned the entire frequency channel for a fraction of time on a fixed, rotating basis.
Because the duration of each time slot is short, the delays that occur while others are using
the frequency are seldom noticeable. Figure 3-14 illustrates TDMA for six users. TDMA is
most often used with digital transmissions.

Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
In traditional TDMA, if a user has no data to transmit during his or
her assigned time slot with TDMA, the frequency remains idle—in
other words, no one else uses that frequency. In more modern sys-
tems, the unused time slots can be assigned to users that are cur-
rently communicating.
Cellular phones based on GSM technology, which until recently was
the most common cellular technology used outside of North America,
transmit and receive voice using the TDMA method and use FDMA to
exchange control information with the tower base stations.
TDMA has two significant advantages over FDMA. First, it uses the bandwidth more effi-
ciently. Studies indicate that when using a 25-MHz bandwidth, TDMA can achieve over
20 times the capacity of FDMA, meaning it can handle a much larger number of transmit-
ters sharing the same frequency band. Second, TDMA allows data and voice transmissions
to be mixed using the same frequency. However, one of the disadvantages of TDMA is that
when all channels are being used simultaneously by different users, the quality of the
voice calls can degrade very quickly, which can be very annoying.

Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
is another transmission method used in cellular telephone communications. Rather than sep-
arate RF frequencies or channels, CDMA uses direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) tech-
nology with a unique digital spreading code (called a PN code) to differentiate the multiple
transmissions in the same frequency range. Before transmission occurs, the high-rate PN
code is combined with the data to be sent; this step spreads the signal over a wide frequency
band, lowers the amplitude of the signal, and is more resistant to interference.
What is different between the CDMA and the DSSS techniques discussed in Chapter 2 is
that to implement multiple access, the transmission to each user begins on a different chip.
Recall that, in DSSS, the 1s and 0s of the spreading code are referred to as “chips” to
avoid confusing them with the data bits; this imprints a unique address on the data. Each
“address” is then used only by one of the receivers sharing a frequency. Figure 3-15 illus-
trates the concept of the spreading code.

The unique-address concept works this way:
Channel 1:
1 0 0 1 1 0 1
Channel 2:
0 0 1 1 0 1 1
Channel 3:
0 1 1 0 1 1 0
and so on, until the sequence of chips wraps around.
Note that each of these codes starts on a different chip of the same sequence of 1s and 0s. In
the above example, the code for channel 2 begins on the second chip of channel 1. The code
for channel 3 begins on the second chip of channel 2, and so on, until there are no more
unique codes available and the sequence of chips wraps around. The longer the code is, the
larger the number of different PN codes, and consequently the larger the number of users
who will be able to share a channel. In the previous unique-address example, there are
seven chips per code, which allows for a maximum of seven unique PN codes.

The number of chips in the code determines the amount of spreading or bandwidth that the
transmitted signal will occupy. Because the amount of spreading is limited by the bandwidth
allocated to the system, the length of the spreading code also determines the number of
unique code sequences and, consequently, the number of users that can share that frequency
band.
In CDMA technology, the spreading code is called a pseudo-random code (PN code),
because the code appears to be a random sequence of 1s and 0s, but it actually repeats itself
over and over.
The spreading process is reversed at the receiver, and the code is de-spread to extract the
original data bit transmitted. Because all receivers are on the same frequency, they all receive
the same transmission. The PN code is designed so that when a receiver picks up a signal
that was spread with the PN code that’s being used by another receiver and then attempts
to recover the original data, the decoded signal still looks like a high-frequency signal
instead of data, so it is ignored. Figure 3-16 illustrates the decoding of the data in CDMA,
and Figure 3-17 shows an example of what happens when a receiver attempts to de-spread
another receiver’s signal and recover the data bits. Note that the bits of the decoded data
signal in Figure 3-17 are not long enough to match the minimum size of a data bit as
shown in Figure 3-16.

Attempting to de-spread another receiver’s CDMA signal with wrong PN code
To understand CDMA, imagine a room with 20 people in it who are having 10 simulta-
neous one-on-one conversations. Now suppose that all the pairs of people are talking at the
same time but in different languages. Ignoring the issue of the noise level in the room,
because none of the listeners understands any language other than that of the individual
with whom they are speaking, the other nine conversations don’t bother them.
There are several advantages to CDMA:
●
It can carry up to three times the amount of data as TDMA.
●
Transmissions are much harder to eavesdrop on, because the would-be eavesdropper
would have to know how many chips and the exact sequence of chips used to encode
the original digital signal.
●
A would-be eavesdropper must also know the exact chip in which a particular
transmission starts and, in the case of cellular telephony, the PN code changes if the
user is moving, when his cellular phone connects to a different tower, thus making
eavesdropping extremely difficult.
CDMA-based cellular technology is extremely complex. Because this book is not specifically
focused on CDMA technology, the preceding description is included merely to provide an
overview of this multiple access method.
Transmission Direction
In most wireless communications systems, data must flow in both directions, and the flow
must be controlled so that the sending and receiving devices know when data will arrive or
when it needs to be transmitted. There are three types of data flow: simplex, half-duplex, and
full-duplex.
Simplex transmission occurs in only one direction, from device 1 to device 2, as shown in
Figure 3-18. A broadcast TV station is an example of simplex transmission: The signal goes
from the TV transmitter to the viewer’s TV, but the viewer has no way of communicating
82

with the station using the same TV signal. Except for broadcast radio and television, simplex
is rarely used in wireless data communications today. That’s because the receiver is unable to
give the sender any feedback regarding the transmission, such as whether it was received cor-
rectly or if it needs to be resent. Such reliability is essential for the successful and correct
exchange of data.
Figure 3-18
Simplex transmission
Half-duplex transmission occurs in both directions, but only one way at a time, as shown in
Figure 3-19. This type of communication is typically used in consumer devices such as citi-
zens band (CB) radios or walkie-talkies, emergency services, and aircraft radio. In order for
User A to transmit a message to User B, he must hold down the “talk” button while speak-
ing. While the button is being pressed, User B can only listen and not talk. User A must
release the “talk” button before User B can press his “talk” button. Both parties can send
and receive information, but only one at a time.
User A
User B
Figure 3-19
Half-duplex transmission
Full-duplex transmission occurs in both directions simultaneously, as shown in Figure 3-20.
A telephone system is a type of full-duplex transmission. Both parties in a telephone call can
speak at the same time, and they are able to hear each other throughout the call. Modern
wireless communications systems, such as cellular and satellite telephones, also use full-
duplex transmission.

Figure 3-20
Full-duplex transmission
Both cellular and satellite full-duplex communications require the use
of two separate channels, regardless of whether they use FDMA,
TDMA, or CDMA.
If the same antenna is used for wireless transmission and reception, a filter can be used to
handle full-duplex transmissions. RF communications equipment that works in full-duplex
mode using FDMA sends and receives on different frequencies. A transmission picked up by
the antenna on the receiving frequency passes through a filter and is sent to the receiver,
while the transmission signal on the sending frequency is passed on to the same antenna,
but on a different frequency. The frequency channels are selected so as to cause minimal sig-
nal interference with each other. An example is shown in Figure 3-21, but not using “real”
frequency channels.

Switching
The concept of switching is essential to all types of telecommunications, wireless as well as
wired. Switching involves moving the signal from one wire or frequency to another. Consider
for a moment the landline telephone in your home. You can use that one telephone to call a
friend across the street, a classmate in another town, a store in a distant state, or anyone else
who also has a phone number anywhere in the world. How can one single telephone be used

to call any other telephone in the world? This is accomplished through a switch at the tele-
phone company’s central office. The signal from your phone goes out your telephone’s wire
all the way to a telephone company’s switching office and is then switched or moved to the
wire of the telephone that belongs to your friend across the street, as shown in Figure 3-22.

Telephone call switching
The first telephone switches were not automatic. Human operators
connected (switched) each two lines manually. Today, the telephone
system is known as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN),
and the collection of equipment used in this network, including the
home telephone sets, is commonly referred to in the data communi-
cations field as the Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS).
To better understand why switches are necessary, imagine a telephone network in which
each telephone must be wired to every other telephone without using switches. If this net-
work had 500 telephones, each telephone would require 499 cables to connect to all the
others, and a total of 124,750 cables would be needed to connect all the telephones to one
another. If you draw a simple network of five telephones on a piece of paper, you’ll notice
that you need 10 cables to interconnect all of them. This type of connection is called a “mesh
network.”

You can quickly calculate how many cables would be required to
interconnect several telephones or computers in a mesh network by
using the formula n(n-1)/2, where n is the total number of devices
you want to connect. Of course, this is not a very practical solution.
To connect all the telephone sets in a city with 100,000 telephones
would require that each set be connected to an enormously large number of wires.
The type of switching used by telephone systems today is known as circuit switching. When a
telephone call is placed, a direct physical connection is made, through the switch, between the
caller and the recipient of the call. While the telephone call is taking place, the connection is
“dedicated” and remains open only to these two users. Ignoring, for the moment, some of the
advanced features available in today’s telephone networks, such as call waiting and conference
calling, no other calls can be made from or received by the two connected phones while this
conversation is taking place, and anyone who calls that phone will receive a busy signal. This
direct connection lasts until the end of the call, at which time the switch drops the connection
and makes the two telephone lines available once more to receive or make calls.
Circuit switching is ideal for voice communications. However, it is not efficient at transmit-
ting data, because data transmission occurs in “bursts,” with periods in between, when noth-
ing is transmitted. These periods with nothing being transmitted result in wasted connection
time in a circuit switched network, since the connection is dedicated to the two devices and
another connection cannot be made. As an example, imagine that you called a friend and nei-
ther of you said anything for long periods of time. No one else would be able to use the
phones until you both hung-up the call.
Instead of using circuit switching, data networks use packet switching. Packet switching
requires that the data transmission be broken into small units called packets. Each packet is
then sent independently through the network to reach a specific destination device, based on
an address contained in the packet, as shown in Figure 3-23.

Packet switching has a couple of important advantages for data transmissions. One advan-
tage is that it allows better utilization of the network, that is, the connections are not tied
up by any two devices. In Figure 3-23, if PC-A does not have any data to send, PC-B and
PC-C can use the available bandwidth on the network to send more data. Any PC can send
data to any other PC at any time. Each packet will be sent on the medium (cable), when the
medium is available (is not being used by another PC). Packets can be sent from any PC to
any destination PC. Circuit switching ties up the communications line until the transmission
is complete, whereas packet switching allows multiple computers to share the same line or
frequency, if this is a wireless transmission. Another advantage of packet switching has to
do with error correction. If a transmission error occurs, it usually affects only one packet.
Only those packets affected by errors must be resent, not the entire message.
Circuit switching is currently used for both wired telephone systems
and most wireless cellular telephone networks. Modern cellular tech-
nologies, currently being deployed in many parts of the world, use
packet switching even for voice calls.
Signal Strength
In a radio system, a signal’s strength must be sufficient for it to reach the receiver(s) with
enough amplitude for the signal to be picked up by the antenna and amplified so that the
information can be correctly extracted from it. Managing signal strength is much more com-
plicated in a wireless system than in a wired network. Because the signal is not confined to
wires, many types of electromagnetic interference can wreak havoc with the transmission. In
addition, many types of objects, both stationary and moving, can negatively impact the sig-
nal. Some examples of electromagnetic interference include high-voltage power lines, various
types of radiation emitted by the sun, other transmissions using the same frequency, and
lightning (see Figure 3-24).

Sources of EMI (or noise) that can cause interference in RF transmissions
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is also called noise. Consider a room with 20 people in it
who are having 10 one-on-one conversations. If everyone talks freely, there is a great deal of
“racket” or background noise, which interferes with all conversations. With radio waves,
background electromagnetic “noise” of various types can negatively affect a signal and
reduce the receiver’s ability to reliably receive the transmission.
A measurement called signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compares the signal strength with the
background noise (see Figure 3-25). When signal strength falls close to or below the level of
noise (low SNR), interference can take place. However, when the strength of the signal is
well above the noise, interference can be easily filtered out. Consider again the example of
the room with 20 people having 10 conversations. Someone who moves closer to her partner
so she can be heard above the background noise is trying to increase the SNR, so the other
person can better and correctly understand what she is saying.

Signal-to-noise ratio
There are various ways to reduce the interference caused by noise, thereby creating an accept-
able SNR. You can use more powerful amplifiers to boost the signal strength, you can better
filter the signal on the receiving end, or you can use transmission techniques such as fre-
quency hopping or direct sequence spread spectrum.
With a highly complex and expensive device, such as an extremely
sensitive radio telescope receiver, the temperature of the circuits is
lowered to −459 degrees Fahrenheit to maximize the performance
and minimize the noise and loss of signal strength caused by the cir-
cuits themselves. Recall that filters and mixers are passive devices
that tend to reduce the amplitude or strength of the signal. Cooling these circuits down to
–459 degrees Fahrenheit virtually eliminates the losses of signal strength and dramatically
reduces the noise. However, it is not practical to do this in a handheld transmitting device.
Loss of signal strength, or attenuation is caused by various factors, but objects in the path of
the signal, including man-made objects such as walls, are what cause the most attenuation.
Table 3-2 shows examples of different building materials and their effect on radio transmis-
sions. Amplifying a signal both before it is transmitted (to increase the power level) and
after it is received helps to minimize the effects of attenuation.

As a radio signal is transmitted, the electromagnetic waves spread out like the waves in a
pond, and lose strength. Some of these waves may also reflect off surfaces and continue
toward the receiver. This results in the same signal reaching a receiver’s antenna at different
times. Since it takes longer for reflected waves to reach a receiver (see Figure 3-26), the waves
that arrive at different times can interfere with each other.

This phenomenon, known as multipath distortion, can happen indoors as well outdoors, and
can negatively affect the strength of signal, preventing a receiver from picking up a signal
strong enough for reliable reception (see Figure 3-27).

Effect that multipath distortion can have on a signal
Multipath distortion gets its name from the fact that some of the waves get reflected, travel
different paths between the transmitter and the receiver, and arrive at the receiver antenna at
different times and out of phase with a signal that travels a more direct path. The resulting
signal at the input of the receiver gets distorted because the peaks of the waves of both
signals—one positive and one negative, for example—get added to each other. The result
can be a reduction or an increase in the amplitude of the signal at the receiver’s antenna,
both of which can cause problems. Multipath distortion is a very complex topic, and a full
discussion of it is beyond the scope of this book. Newer wireless standards—such as
802.11n and 802.11ac—actually take advantage of multiple signals arriving at the receiver
at different times to improve reception.

There are various ways to minimize multipath distortion, including using a directional
antenna, using multiple receiver radios and antennas, or changing the height of the transmitter
antenna to provide a stronger signal with a clear line of sight to the receiver’s antenna. Direc-
tional antennas radiate the electromagnetic waves in one direction only and can help reduce
or eliminate the effect of multipath distortion if there is a clear line of sight between the
receiver and transmitter antennas. Other methods include using a more powerful amplifier in
front of the receiver circuit to help increase the SNR or transmitting the same signal on sepa-
rate frequencies. Multipath distortion is particularly problematic in cities with large buildings
and structures where the receiver is in constant motion, such as in cellular telephony.
Multipath distortion affects FM reception as well, particularly in the
downtown districts of metropolitan areas. FM stations are usually
free from noise; however, while moving through the downtown
area of a large city you may have noticed occasional static-like noise
while listening to an FM station. This noise is caused by the signal
reflecting off large buildings and reaching the receiver out of phase, sometimes canceling the
signal for very brief moments.
Multipath distortion in RF communications works very similarly to the
way an echo affects sound. A good way to simulate multipath distor-
tion is to use an audio editor such as Audacity (on a computer run-
ning Windows) or GarageBand (on an Apple Macintosh running OS
X) to record a sentence like “This is what happens when multipath
affects a wireless transmission,” then add an echo effect to the recording. Experiment with dif-
ferent degrees of echo. When you play the recording with a lot of echo, try to pick out only
the individual words in the middle of the sentence.
Understanding Standards
As you continue to learn about the various wireless communications technologies discussed in
upcoming chapters, you will find many references to standards and regulations that play a
part in how they work and how they are used. In place almost from the beginning of the tele-
communications industry, standards have also had an important role in its growth. A knowl-
edge of which standards apply and how they apply to the wireless communications systems
you work with will enhance your ability to read and understand industry news, technical arti-
cles, and system specifications as well as help you design and deploy multivendor systems that
offer excellent compatibility and scalability.
The Need for Standards
Some IT people believe that the standards set for computer technologies stifle growth in this
fast-paced field today and that waiting for standards to catch up with their needs slows
everything down. Nevertheless, standards ultimately benefit both manufacturers and consu-
mers. The very nature of the telecommunications industry, in which pieces of equipment
from one manufacturer interact with equipment from other manufacturers, requires that stan-
dards exist for the design, implementation, testing, and operation of the equipment. For
92

example, using your laptop computer on virtually any network worldwide would be next to
impossible without standards.
The world’s first telecommunications standard was published by the
International Telegraph Union (ITU) in 1885. The standard originated
from a desire by the governments of many countries to have a com-
patible telegraph operation. It took 20 years for the first telegraph
standard to be created and published.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Standards
There are pros and cons to developing and applying standards in the telecommunications
industry. The advantages have to do with interoperability and corporate competition,
whereas the disadvantages are primarily political in nature.
Advantages of Standards One advantage of telecommunications standards is the
guarantee that devices from one vendor will interoperate with those from other vendors.
Devices that are not based on standards may not be able to connect and communicate with
similar devices from other vendors. Standards ensure that a transmitter purchased from Ven-
dor A can be seamlessly integrated into a communications network that contains a receiver
from Vendor B.
A second advantage of standards is that they create competition. Standards are open to
everyone; any vendor who wants to enter a marketplace can do so by manufacturing their
equipment to comply with standards. Thus, standards can result in competition between
vendors; and competition has several benefits. It results in lower costs for consumers and
better-developed products. A vendor who has created a proprietary device gains no benefit
from reducing prices because there is no competition. Instead, with a captive market, the
vendor may raise prices at will. However, vendors making products based on the same stan-
dards may reduce their prices in order to compete in the marketplace. The competition usu-
ally results in lower costs to consumers.
Competition also results in lower costs for manufacturers. Because standards have already
been established, manufacturers do not have to invest large amounts of capital in research
and development. Instead, they can use the standards as a blueprint for their manufacturing.
This reduces start-up costs as well as the amount of time needed to bring a product to the
market. Also, because standards increase the market for products that follow those stan-
dards, manufacturers tend to employ mass production techniques and gain economies of
scale in manufacturing and engineering. As a result, production costs may be lower, and
these savings are usually passed on to the consumers.
A third advantage of standards is that they help consumers protect their investments in equip-
ment. It is not uncommon for a manufacturer of a proprietary device to phase out a product
line. Businesses that purchased that line are left with two choices. They can continue to sup-
port this now-obsolete legacy system, although the costs will dramatically escalate as replace-
ment parts (and support specialists) become more difficult to locate. Or, they can get rid of
the equipment and buy an up-to-date system. Both choices are usually very expensive.
Standards can help create a migration path. The organization that creates the initial standards
continues to incorporate new technologies by regularly revising its standards. Generally, these
Understanding Standards
93

revisions are backward-compatible, which reduces the risk of obsolete “orphan” systems that
are incompatible with newer technologies.
One example of a standard that has helped consumers is IEEE 802.11
that is used in Wi-Fi. Even if your equipment is compatible with IEEE
802.11n, it can usually be configured to support older Wi-Fi equip-
ment that is only compatible with IEEE 802.11b or earlier.
Disadvantages of Standards International standards can be perceived as a threat to
the economies of some countries because their domestic markets become subjected to over-
seas competition. Manufacturers in countries where labor costs are lower may be able to
produce a device more cheaply. Standards allow those manufacturers to produce and sell
their products abroad, often threatening a domestic manufacturer’s market share.
Another disadvantage of standards is that although they are intended to create unity, they
can have the opposite effect. Periodically, a country will create a standard and offer it to
other countries as a global standard. However, for political reasons having nothing to do
with technology, other countries may reject the standard and attempt to create their own.
Television broadcasting standards provide an example of this. Countries around the world
have created various standards as a way of protecting their internal markets as well as their
cultural heritages. With the advent of the Internet and global commerce, this type of protec-
tionism appears to be on the way out, but multiple TV standards continue to be in effect,
forcing many manufacturers to design and produce television sets and video recorders that
support multiple standards. The consumer ultimately has to pay the cost of maintaining
these more complex devices.
Most experts agree that the advantages of standards far outweigh the disadvantages and
that standards are vital, particularly for the telecommunications industry.
Types of Standards
There are two major types of standards in the telecommunications industry: de facto stan-
dards and de jure standards. A third type, consortia standards, is increasingly influencing
how standards are set.
De Facto Standards De facto standards are not official standards. They are simply
common practices that the industry follows for various reasons—because they’re easy to
use, perhaps, or because they’ve traditionally been used or they’re what the majority of
users have adopted. For the most part, de facto standards are established by their success in
the marketplace. For example, most industry experts would agree that Microsoft Windows
today is still the de facto standard for personal-computer operating systems. No organiza-
tion proclaimed Windows the standard; its widespread use created what amounts to a
standard.
The term de facto comes from Latin and means “from the fact.” As
it applies to computer and communications technologies, those tech-
nologies that are adopted by the market voluntarily become known
as de facto standards.

De Jure Standards De jure standards, also called official standards, are those that are
controlled by an organization or body that has been entrusted with that task. Each stan-
dards group has its own rules regarding membership. You will read about some of these
groups in the next section.
The process for creating standards can be very involved. Generally, the organization devel-
ops subcommittees responsible for specific technologies. Each subcommittee is composed of
different working groups, which are teams of industry experts given the task of creating the
initial draft of a standard’s documentation. The draft is then published to the members, both
individuals and companies, and requests for comments (RFCs) are solicited. These members
are developers, potential users, and other people with an interest in the field. The original
committee reviews the comments and revises the draft. This final draft is then reviewed by
the entire organization and is usually put to a vote before the final standards are officially
published and made available to the public.
De facto standards sometimes become de jure standards by being
approved by a committee. The TCP/IP network communications pro-
tocol that is so widely used today is an example of a de facto standard
that later became an official standard, when the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) became an official standards body.
Consortia One of the major complaints against de jure standards is the amount of time it
takes for a standard to be completed. For example, the initial standard for wireless LANs
took 7 years to complete. In the telecommunications and IT industries, this represents an
extremely long period of time before products can be brought to the marketplace; in some
cases, manufacturers release products long before the standards are approved, as was the
case with the latest high-speed WLAN standard.
Responding to this criticism, consortia are often used today to create standards. Consortia
are industry-sponsored organizations with the goal of promoting a specific technology.
Unlike with de jure standards bodies, membership in consortia is not open to everyone.
Instead, specific high-profile companies create and serve on consortia. The goal of consortia
is to develop a standard that promotes their specific technology in a shorter period of time
than what official standards organizations take.
One of the most well-known consortia is the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C at www
.w3.org), which is composed of industry giants such as Microsoft, Google, IBM, and hun-
dreds of other companies. The W3C is responsible for creating the standards that are widely
used on the Internet today, including hypertext markup language (HTML), cascading style
sheets (CSS), and the Document Object Model (DOM).
Telecommunications Standards Organizations
In the telecommunications field, standards organizations exist at the national, multinational,
and international levels. The following sections discuss each of these levels.
National Standards Organizations In the United States, there are several standards
organizations, each of which plays a role in setting telecommunications standards. The
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) functions largely as a clearinghouse for all
Understanding Standards
95

kinds of standards development in the United States. Most ANSI standards are developed by
one of its over 270 affiliated organizations, which include diverse groups such as the Water
Quality Association and the Telecommunications Industry Association, as well as the group
that originally created the ASCII code for use in computers and data communications. ANSI
represents the interests of over 125,000 companies and 3.5 million professionals worldwide.
One of the ANSI-affiliated organizations is the Telecommunications Industries Association
(TIA). It is made up of industry vendors from telecommunications, electronic components,
consumer electronics, and electronic information. Working with vendors, the TIA publishes
Recommended Standards (RS) for the industry to follow. For example, the TIA developed
and published a standard that defines how a computer’s serial port, connector pin-outs,
and electrical signaling should function. This standard is generally known as TIA RS-232.
More information on the TIA can be found at www.tiaonline.org.
The TIA represents more than 600 companies that manufacture or supply the products and
services used in global communications. The function of the TIA is to advocate policies to
legislative bodies and to establish standards in five areas: user-premises equipment, network
equipment, wireless communications, fiber optics, and satellite communications.
Two other organizations play roles in establishing national standards for telecommunica-
tions technology. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is a large, open (to anyone
interested in joining) community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers
concerned with the evolution of the Internet’s architecture and the smooth operation of the
Internet. Although it is a U.S. organization, it accepts members from any country in the
world and focuses on the upper layers of telecommunications protocols; it is the organiza-
tion that designs and develops practically all of the protocols used on the Internet. The
IETF existed informally for many years, and it was not an official standards body until
1986, when it was formalized by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB).
The IAB is responsible for defining the overall architecture of the Internet; it also serves as
the technology advisory group for the Internet Society (ISOC), a professional-membership
organization of Internet experts that comments on policies and practices and oversees a
number of other boards and task forces dealing with network policy issues. You can find
out more about the IETF and its parent organizations at www.ietf.org.
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), like the IETF, establishes stan-
dards for telecommunications. However, it also establishes a wide range of other IT stan-
dards. The IEEE’s most well-known standards include IEEE 802.3, which covers local area
network Ethernet compatible equipment, and IEEE 802.11, which covers the lower protocol
layers of wireless LANs.
You can learn more about the IEEE at www.ieee.org. You can also
obtain a no-cost copy of the IEEE 802 standards that relate to net-
working and wireless networking, provided that these have been
published for longer than 6 months, at the following website:
standards.ieee.org/getieee802/portfolio.html.
Multinational Standards Organizations Multinational standards organizations
span more than one country; many of them are based in Europe. For example, the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) develops telecommunications standards for
96

use throughout Europe. Its membership consists primarily of European companies and
European government agencies, but they also interface with organizations in other countries,
including the United States. You can learn more about ETSI at www.etsi.org.
International Standards Organizations Because telecommunications technology is
truly global, there are also global organizations that set industry standards. The best known
is the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), an agency of the United Nations that
is responsible for telecommunications. The ITU is composed of over 200 governments and pri-
vate companies that coordinate global telecommunications networks and services. Unlike
other organizations that set standards, the ITU is actually a treaty organization. The regula-
tions set by the ITU are legally binding on the nations that have signed the treaty.
Two of the ITU’s subsidiary organizations prepare recommendations on telecommunications
standards. The ITU-T focuses on telecommunications networks, and the ITU-R focuses on
RF-based communications, including the radio frequencies that should be used and the
radio systems that support them. Although these recommendations are not mandatory and
are not binding on the countries that have signed other treaties, almost all of the countries
elect to follow the ITU recommendations, and these essentially function as worldwide stan-
dards. You can learn more about the ITU at www.itu.int.
ITU-T replaced a standards body known as the CCITT, whose origins
date back to work on standards for telegraphs in the 1860s.
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is based in Geneva, Switzerland.
(Note that it uses the acronym “ISO” instead of “IOS.” That’s because “iso” means
“equal” in Greek, and the organization wanted to use the same acronym worldwide,
regardless of language.) Started in 1947, the ISO promotes international cooperation and
standards in the areas of science, technology, and economics. Today, groups from over
190 countries belong to the ISO. You can learn more about it at www.iso.org.
Several of the groups that belong to the ISO are actually national
standards bodies. For example, the TIA interfaces with the ISO.
It might seem like there are too many standards organizations, but all these organizations,
including the ones in the United States, cooperate with one another, seldom stepping over
one another’s authority or geographical jurisdiction. You will read more about this coopera-
tion in the upcoming chapters.
Regulatory Agencies
Although setting standards is important for telecommunications, enforcing telecommunica-
tions regulations is equally important. In a sense, the nature of national and international
commerce enforces some standards. A company that refuses to abide by standards for cellu-
lar telephone transmissions will find that nobody buys its products. Telecommunications reg-
ulations, however, must be enforced by an outside regulatory agency, whose role is to ensure
that all participants adhere to the prescribed standards. These regulations typically involve
Understanding Standards

defining who can use a specific frequency when broadcasting a signal. Almost all countries
have a national organization that functions as the regulatory agency to determine and enforce
telecommunications policies. Some small countries without a regulatory agency simply adopt
the regulations used by another country.
In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) serves as the primary
regulatory agency for telecommunications. The FCC is an independent government agency
that is directly responsible to Congress. It was established by the Communications Act of
1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio,
television, wire, satellite, and cable. The FCC’s jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District
of Columbia, and U.S. territories.
In order to preserve its independence, the FCC is directed by five
commissioners who are appointed by the President of the United
States and confirmed by the Senate for 5-year terms. Only three
commissioners may be members of the same political party, and
none of them can have a financial interest in any FCC-related
business.
The FCC’s responsibilities are very broad. In addition to developing and implementing regu-
latory programs, it processes applications for licenses to use a particular frequency or band
and similar filings, analyzes complaints, conducts investigations, and takes part in congressio-
nal hearings. The FCC also represents the United States in negotiations with foreign nations
about telecommunications issues.
The FCC plays an important role in wireless communications. It regulates radio and televi-
sion broadcast stations as well as cable and satellite stations. It also oversees the licensing,
compliance, implementation, and other aspects of cellular telephones, pagers, and two-way
radios. The FCC regulates the use of radio frequencies to fulfill the communications needs
of businesses, local and state governments, public safety service providers, military, aircraft
and ship operators, as well as individuals.
The RF spectrum is a limited resource, meaning that only a certain range of frequencies can be
used for radio transmissions. Because of this limitation, frequencies are almost always licensed
by regulatory agencies in the different countries around the world. In the United States, the reg-
ulatory agency is the FCC, which has the power to allocate portions of the spectrum. Broad-
casters are required to transmit only in the frequency or frequencies for which they obtained a
license. Commercial companies such as radio and television stations must pay fees (which are
sometimes quite large) for the right to use a frequency; naturally, they do not want anyone
else to be allowed to transmit on the same frequency within their coverage area. The FCC and
other countries’ agencies continually monitor transmissions to ensure that no one is using a fre-
quency without a license or is transmitting with more power than their license allows.
Radio Frequency Spectrum
The radio frequency spectrum is the entire range of all radio frequencies that exist, from
10 KHz to over 30 GHz. The spectrum is divided into 450 different sections, or bands.
Table 3-3 lists some of the major bands, their corresponding frequencies, and some typical uses.

The United States is obligated to comply with the international spectrum allocations estab-
lished by the ITU. However, the United States’ use of its domestic spectrum may differ from
the international allocations as long as those uses do not conflict with international regula-
tions or agreements.
Until 1993, the ITU held conferences at 20-year intervals to review
the international spectrum allocations. Since then, ITU conferences
are convened every 2 to 3 years.

The U.S. Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and
Information Administration (NTIA) serves as the principal advisor to
the President on domestic and international communications and
information issues. It also represents the views of the executive
branch before Congress, the Federal Communications Commission,
foreign governments, and international organizations.
Although a license from the FCC is required to send and receive on a specific frequency, there
is a notable exception. This is known as the license exempt spectrum, or unregulated bands.
Unregulated bands are, in effect, the parts of the radio frequency spectrum that are available
to any users nationwide without charge and without a license. Devices that use these bands
can be either fixed or mobile. The FCC designated the unregulated bands to promote the
development of a broad range of new devices and stimulate the growth of new industries.
The FCC does impose power limits on devices using the unregulated
bands, which in effect reduces their range and helps prevent
interference.
Table 3-4 outlines a subset of the unregulated bands used by many of the technologies dis-
cussed in this book. The ITU-R has published recommendations for many additional unregu-
lated bands; but as you learned earlier, not every country’s domestic market follows all of the
ITU-R’s recommendations. One unregulated band is the Industrial, Scientific and Medical
(ISM) band, which was approved by the FCC in 1985. Today, devices such as WLANs that
transmit at speeds of 1 Mbps and above use this band. Another unlicensed band used in Wi-
Fi is the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII), approved in 1996. The U-
NII band is intended for devices that provide short-range, high-speed wireless digital commu-
nications. U-NII compatible devices are also widely used in Wi-Fi WLANs today.

A recent development that has had an impact on the crowded radio frequency spectrum
involves transmitting radio signals directly to a device without the use of special directional
antennas. When radio signals leave the sender’s antenna, they spread or radiate out (the
word radio comes from the term radiated energy) and can be picked up by multiple recipients.
A new technique known as adaptive array processing replaces a traditional antenna with an
array of antenna elements. These elements deliver RF signals with increased strength to one
specific user or device, instead of sending signals out in a broad pattern. This allows more
transmissions to take place in a given range of frequencies, in a particular location.
Chapter Summary
■Several hardware components are essential for communicating using radio frequencies
(RF): filters, mixers, amplifiers, and antennas. A version of each of these components
is found on all radio systems.
■A filter is used to either accept or block a radio frequency signal. With a low-pass
filter, a maximum frequency threshold is set. All signals that are below that
maximum threshold are allowed to pass through. Instead of having a maximum fre-
quency threshold, as with a low-pass filter, a high-pass filter has a minimum frequency
threshold. All signals that are above the minimum threshold are allowed to pass
through, whereas those below the minimum threshold are turned away. A bandpass
filter has a passband, which is both a minimum and maximum threshold, thus allow-
ing all frequencies that fall in between both, to pass.
■The purpose of a mixer is to combine two inputs to create a single output. The single
output is the highest sum and the lowest difference of the frequencies.
■An amplifier increases a signal’s intensity or strength, whereas an antenna converts an
RF signal from the transmitter into an electromagnetic wave, which carries the infor-
mation through the air or empty space.
■Although filters, mixers, amplifiers, and antennas are all necessary components for a
radio system, there are other design considerations that must be taken into account
when creating a radio system. Because there are only a limited number of frequencies
available, conserving the use of frequencies is important. One way to conserve is by
sharing a frequency among several individual users.
■Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) divides the bandwidth of the frequency
into several narrower frequencies. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) divides the
bandwidth into several time slots. Each user is assigned the entire frequency band for
his transmission but only for a small fraction of time on a fixed, rotating basis. Code
Division Multiple Access (CDMA) uses spread spectrum technology and unique digital
spreading codes called PN codes, rather than separate RF frequencies or channels, to
differentiate between the different transmissions.
■The direction in which data travels on a wireless network is important. There are three
types of data flow. Simplex transmission occurs in only one direction. Half-duplex
transmission sends data in both directions, but only one way at a time. Full-duplex
transmission enables data to flow in both directions simultaneously.

■Switching involves moving the signal from one wire or frequency to another. Tele-
phone systems use a type of switching known as circuit switching. When a telephone
call is made, a dedicated and direct physical connection is made between the caller and
the recipient of the call through the switch. Instead of using circuit switching, data
networks use packet switching. Packet switching requires that the data transmission be
broken into smaller units called packets, and each packet is then sent independently
through the network to reach the destination.
■Managing a signal’s strength is much more complicated in a wireless system than in a
wired system. Electromagnetic interference (EMI), sometimes called noise, comes from
a variety of man-made and natural sources. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) refers to
the measure of signal strength relative to the background noise. A loss of signal
strength is known as attenuation. Attenuation can be caused by a variety of factors
(such as objects) that can decrease the signal’s strength as the RF waves pass through.
As a radio signal is transmitted, the electromagnetic waves spread out. Some of these
waves may reflect off surfaces and slow down. This results in the same signal being
received not only from several different directions but at different times. This is known
as multipath distortion.
■Telecommunications standards have been in place almost since the beginning of the
industry and have played an important role in the rapid growth of the field. There are
several advantages of having standards, including interoperability, lower costs, and a
migration path. De facto standards are not standards per se, just common practices
that the industry follows. Official standards (also called de jure standards) are those
that are controlled by an organization or body that has been entrusted with that task.
Consortia are often used today to create standards. Consortia are industry-sponsored
organizations that have the goal of promoting a specific technology.
■Some standards organizations span more than one country. And because telecommu-
nications is a truly global phenomenon, there are also multinational as well as
international organizations that set standards. In the United States, the Federal Com-
munications Commission (FCC) serves as the primary regulatory agency for telecom-
munications. The FCC is an independent government agency that answers directly to
Congress.
■The radio frequency spectrum is the entire range of all radio frequencies that exist.
This range extends from 10 KHz to over 30 GHz and is divided into 450 different
bands. Although a license from the FCC is normally required to send and receive on
a specific frequency, unregulated bands are available for use without a license in the
United States and most other countries. Two unregulated bands are the Industrial,
Scientific and Medical (ISM) band and the Unlicensed National Information
Infrastructure (U-NII).
■A recent development that has had an impact on the crowded radio frequency spec-
trum is adaptive array processing. Systems that use adaptive array processing replace a
traditional antenna with an array of antenna elements. Use of this technique can
deliver RF signals with increased strength to one specific user or device, instead of
sending signals out in a broad pattern.

Leave the application open for the next project.
You will use Acrylic Wi-Fi Home in the following project as well as in
other chapters of this book.
As an alternative to Acrylic Wi-Fi, if you have an Android smart-
phone, there are many similar free Wi-Fi utilities available from the
Google Play store.
Project 3-5
In this project, you use Acrylic Wi-Fi Home to monitor the signal strength of
your AP.
1.
The graph at the bottom of the Acrylic Wi-Fi window (see Figure 3-31) displays the
strength of the signal that your computer is receiving from the access points (APs)
or Wireless Residential Gateways. The line will appear near the top of the graph if
the signal strength is high and near the bottom of the graph if the signal strength
is low.
Don’t worry about the meaning of the numbers on either side of the
Acrylic Wi-Fi time graph window for now. You will learn what they
mean and how to use them in later chapters.
2.
Monitor the strength of the signal while roaming away from the access point with the
computer. Try to determine how far you can move from the access point before the sig-
nal is too weak for the connection to work reliably. To do this, you will need to
attempt to open a webpage or download a file.
You can estimate the distance between you and the AP by any
method available to you, such as counting tiles on the floor and mul-
tiplying by the size of the tiles or measuring your stride and counting
the number of paces between the laptop computer and the AP.
3.
As you move away from the AP, record all the obstacles between the computer and the
AP, such as walls, doors, windows, and partitions. While monitoring the signal
strength, record which items appear to have the greatest impact on the strength of the
signal.

4.
Record the distance at which the connection to the AP drops or becomes too slow or
unreliable, such as when you can no longer access webpages or when a file download
appears to stop for a minute or longer.
5.
Monitor the strength of the signal while standing between 50 feet (15 meters) and
100 feet (30 meters) from the AP and covering the antenna of the network interface
card with the following items:
●
Your hand (for a short period of time)
●
A piece of aluminum foil
●
A sheet of paper
●
A sheet of plastic (like a shopping bag)
●
A purse or briefcase with some metallic objects inside
If the NIC is built into the laptop computer, try using both hands to
cover the back of the screen or the bottom of the computer until
you see a definite reduction in the strength of the signal.

that does not follow any current standards. The price given for the product and its installation
is low and is therefore attractive to the center. However, managers at the center have asked
TBG for advice.
Exercise 3-1
Use PowerPoint or a similar presentation tool to create a slide presentation that outlines the
different types of standards, the advantages and disadvantages of standards, and why they
are needed. Include examples of products that did not follow standards and have vanished
from the marketplace. Because the Good Samaritan Center is on the verge of buying the
product, TBG has asked you to be very persuasive in your presentation. You are told that
presenting the facts is not enough at this point; you must convince them why they should
purchase a product that follows standards before you leave the room.
Exercise 3-2
Your presentation casts a doubt on the vendor’s proprietary product, but the Good
Samaritan Center is still not completely convinced it should go with a standard product.
TBG has just learned that the vendor’s proprietary product uses a licensed frequency that
will require the center to secure and pay for a license from the FCC. TBG has asked you to
prepare another presentation regarding the advantages and disadvantages of unregulated
frequency bands. Because an engineer who sits on the Board of the Good Samaritan Center
will be there, this slide presentation should be detailed and technical in its scope. Avoid
focusing on the disadvantages of the vendor’s proposal. Be prepared to answer questions
related to potential interference by other wireless network users in nearby offices and what
measures can be taken either to avoid such interference altogether or to deal with any pro-
blems that may arise.
Challenge Case Project
A local engineering user’s group has contacted The Baypoint Group requesting
a speaker to discuss multiple access technologies (FDMA, TDMA, and
CDMA). Form a team of two or three consultants and research these technolo-
gies in detail. Specifically, pay attention to how they are used, and address their
strengths and weaknesses. Provide an opinion about which technology will become the domi-
nant player in the future of wireless.

So far, we have looked at the properties of radio frequency signals, most of the
components that are required to generate these signals, and how to modulate RF signals
with some kind of meaningful information to be transmitted, whether analog (like music or
voice) or digital data (which is what this book is about). The last component required for
transmission of these signals is an antenna, and this is such a vast topic that it deserves its
own chapter.
Antennas mystify even some RF engineers and technicians, for they are responsible for the
marvelous “magic” of RF communications. The purpose of an antenna is to convert electricity
into electromagnetic (EM) waves, which then radiate or move away from the antenna at the
transmitter end. At the receiver end, antennas “pick up” the EM radiation, which induces a
tiny amount of electrical current into the antenna. It is this minute amount of electrical cur-
rent, carrying the information, that is then amplified and demodulated by the receiver.
The field of wireless communications is growing at a very fast pace, with new standards and
technologies being introduced seemingly every week. Wireless service providers, retailers,
and in fact all kinds of businesses are beginning to deploy wireless networks everywhere—
at airports, hotels, train stations, restaurants, cafes, shopping malls, and even in public
parks or entire city blocks. The use of cellular telephones has exploded in ways that few
people could imagine. Employees in all types of industries are being equipped with smart-
phones and tablet computers, so they can stay in touch through voice and email at all times
from anywhere in the world, and also so they can access applications and corporate data.
Wireless networks and wireless Internet hotspots are becoming commonplace in locations
catering to businesspeople and the general public alike. No matter which type of RF com-
munications, none of it could happen without antennas.
Antennas play a key role in the successful deployment of any kind of wireless connection.
Proper design, planning, and installation of antennas is required to ensure good signal cov-
erage, to permit user mobility, minimize or eliminate interference, and in some cases to
enhance security. Cellular service providers spend a great deal of time and effort planning
and analyzing utilization and traffic patterns in order to maximize the number of customers
that can use the system in a given area and allow for continuous connectivity for both data
and voice. In the rush to get wireless networks installed today, many are being deployed
with little thought about where the signals originate or how far they reach.
This chapter takes you on an introductory technical tour of antennas—their types, sizes, and
applications as well as some of the implementation issues. First, you learn about power gain
and loss, then about the physical aspects of antennas. Mostly, this chapter discusses anten-
nas used in a limited range of wireless communications technologies. However, the basic
concepts cross over to other RF communications technologies, and the information provided
here can be easily extended to other types of antenna systems.
Gain and Loss
Understanding RF signal transmission involves knowing:
●
The strength or the power with which the transmitter is sending the signal
●
The amount of reduction in signal strength caused by cables, connectors, and other
components
114
Chapter 4

●
The transmission medium (electromagnetic waves)
●
The minimum strength of the signal required by the receiver to be able to properly
recover the data sent by the transmitter
These requirements mean that we need to know how much power the signal loses or gains at
various points. For example, an analysis of the signal would determine the power level that
was fed into the antenna and how much signal strength was lost in transit from the transmit-
ter to the receiver, due to obstacles and other impediments.
Consider a wireless cable/DSL router for home networking, which typically sends out a signal
with approximately 32 milliwatts (0.032 watts) of power. The router is on the lower level of
the house, and by the time the signal reaches the wireless NIC in a laptop computer in the
second-floor bedroom, it may only have a strength of about 0.000000001 (109) watts, or
1 nanowatt. With received signals being sometimes several million times smaller than the
signals that were transmitted, performing calculations with many digits to the right of the dec-
imal point is challenging. It is easy to make a mistake reading, writing, or typing these long
numbers, even with a calculator. Fortunately, engineers have had the same kind of difficulty
with very large or very small numbers, which is why Bell Labs, in the 1920s, came up with a
system to simplify these calculations.
Recall from the previous chapter that an amplifier boosts the power of a signal; when this
happens, the effect is called a gain. Conversely, cables and connectors offer a resistance to
the flow of electricity and therefore tend to decrease the power of a signal. Humidity, dust,
and obstacles like walls and human bodies also cause the signal to lose strength. This effect is
called a loss. Knowing how much gain or loss occurs in an RF system composed of radio
transmitters, receivers, cables, connectors, and antennas is necessary to assist RF engineers
and technicians in selecting the appropriate components and properly installing them for reli-
able signal transmission and reception.
It is also important to understand that a signal’s power does not usually change in linear fash-
ion. Instead, it changes logarithmically. Figure 4-1 shows a graph of two values: one that
changes in linear fashion and one that changes in logarithmic fashion.

Gain and loss are relative concepts, which means that you need to know the power level of
the signal at two different points, such as at the transmitting antenna and at the receiving
antenna. Relative concepts are best quantified with relative measurements, such as percen-
tages. To calculate the signal loss, using percentages, for our sample wireless cable/DSL router
used in a home network, you would still have to deal with numbers that are difficult to read,
write, or type. Let’s take a look at a much easier way to work with gain and loss, without
using long numbers.
Decibel
Decibel (dB) is a ratio between two signal levels—a relative measurement (i.e., one in which a
value is dependent on another value) that makes it much simpler to express and calculate
power gain or loss. Here is how it’s done.
The decibel is named in honor of Alexander Graham Bell, the inven-
tor of the telephone. That is why the “B” in “dB” is written as a
capital letter.
To calculate gain, all you need to remember, in practically all cases, is that:
●
A gain of 3 dB (+3 dB) means the signal is two times bigger (twice the power).
●
A gain of 10 dB (+10 dB) means the signal is 10 times bigger (10 times the power).
Loss is the opposite of gain, hence:
●
A loss of 3 dB (3 dB) means the signal is two times smaller (half the power).
●
A loss of 10 dB (10 dB) means the signal is 10 times smaller (1/10th the power).

To say “a loss of minus 3 dB” (3 dB) is incorrect. The correct form
is to say “a loss of 3 dB.”
These rules are known as the tens and threes of RF mathematics. As you will see in the
examples that follow, you can easily and quickly calculate the gain or loss with a reasonable
amount of accuracy, without using a calculator, just by following these simple rules.
Using dB to represent gains and losses means that the only types of calculations required are
simple additions and subtractions. There is no need for multiplication, division, or any kind
of complex calculation to convert the values to the same unit in order to get a meaningful
result. For example, if a transmitter is connected to a cable that has a loss of 4 dB and each
connector—one on the transmitter end of the cable and one on the antenna end of the cable—
has a loss of 1 dB, you can simply add the losses together like this: (4 dB) + (1 dB) +
(1 dB) ¼ 6 dB, for a total loss of 6 dB.
Although dB is a relative measurement, at some point we have to make a “connection” or refer-
ence between dB and a linear, absolute measurement. One example of this is dBm (decibel-
milliwatt), which is a relative way to indicate an absolute power level in the linear watt scale:
1 mW ¼ 0 dBm
You can add or subtract any value represented in dB (dBm, etc.) using the “tens and threes”
rule; you can also convert a dBm value directly to milliwatts of power. Let’s look at some
examples:
●
+3 dB (3 dB of gain) will double the power: 10 mW + 3 dB ¼ approximately 20 mW
●
3 dB (3 dB of loss) will halve the power: 10 mW  3 dB ¼ approximately 5 mW
●
+10 dB will increase the power 10 times: 10 mW + 10 dB ¼ approximately 100 mW
●
10 dB will decrease the power 10 times: 10 mW  10 dB ¼ approximately 1 mW
Converting to mW does not change the relative measurement char-
acteristic of decibels. It simply means that you have a reference
point for the values used in the calculations; you can still add or sub-
tract any dB values as if they were all represented in the same units.
Therefore, if you want to know the absolute power level of a particular signal that is sup-
plied by a transmitter and you know from the specifications for this particular unit that the
strength of the output signal is +36 dBm, you can calculate the absolute power by breaking
down this number like this:
36 dBm ¼ 10 dBm + 10 dBm + 10 dBm + 3 dBm + 3 dBm
Because 0 dBm is equal to 1 mW, it follows that:
●
Adding 10 dB makes the signal power 10 mW or 1 mW multiplied by 10.
●
Adding another 10 dB multiplies the signal power by 10, making it 100 mW.
●
Adding another 10 dB multiplies the signal power by 10 again, making it 1,000 mW
or 1 W.

●
Adding another 3 dB doubles the signal power, making it 2 W.
●
Adding another 3 dB doubles the signal power again, making it 4 W.
In the rare instances in which using the “tens and threes” rule does
not work, the formula for converting milliwatts (mW) to dBm is PdBm ¼
10logPmW. Conversely, the formula for converting dBm to mW is:
PmW ¼ log1(PdBm/10) ¼ 10 dBm, where PmW is power in milliwatts,
and PdBm is the equivalent figure in dB. These formulas are provided
here for your reference only.
When assigning a dB factor to the gain of an antenna, the measurement must relate to some
absolute value. The most perfect radiator of electromagnetic waves is an isotropic radiator, a
theoretically perfect sphere that radiates energy equally in all directions. It is not possible to
build a real isotropic radiator because it would need a power and a signal cable connected to it
at some point on the surface of the sphere. The cable connection means that the sphere would
no longer be perfect and would not be able to radiate with equal intensity in all directions.
An antenna does not transmit a signal where the cable is connected to it; however, the signal
being fed into the antenna from the transmitter circuit does not change. That energy will still
result in an electromagnetic wave, as well as a slight increase in the energy that did not prop-
agate from the point where the cable is connected to the antenna. This is why antennas
exhibit a gain (more on this later in this chapter).
As a reference point, an isotropic radiator has a theoretical gain of 0 dBm. Antenna gain is
expressed using dB isotropic (dBi), a relative measurement of the gain of an antenna as com-
pared to the gain of an isotropic radiator.
The closest thing to an isotropic radiator is the sun. However, even the
sun is not perfect because of a phenomenon called sunspots, which
are dark areas on the surface of the star that change periodically and
radiate energy levels different from the rest of the sun’s surface.
For microwave and higher frequency antennas, antenna gain is usually expressed in dB
dipole (dBd). A dipole is the smallest, simplest, most practical type of antenna that can be
made and exhibits the least amount of gain. A dipole has a fixed gain of 2.15 dB over that
of an isotropic radiator. Therefore, if the gain of an antenna is 5 dBd, to convert to dBi, you
simply add 2.15 to the 5 and get 7.15 dBi. Table 4-1 shows a summary of the decibel mea-
surements used in RF communications.

Antenna Characteristics
Now that you have an understanding of gain and loss, it is time to get acquainted with
antenna types, sizes, and shapes.
Antennas are reciprocal devices, which means that an antenna that
works well for transmitting a signal on a particular range of frequen-
cies is also effective at receiving signals in the same range of
frequencies.
Antenna Types
Antennas used in wireless communications can be characterized as either passive or active.
Each type of antenna can be constructed as either passive or active; however, most antennas
are passive.
Passive Antennas Passive antennas are the most common type and are constructed of
a piece of metal, wire, or similar conductive material. A passive antenna does not amplify
the signal in any way; it can only radiate a signal with the same amount of energy that
appears at the antenna connector minus any losses introduced by the antenna cable and
connector. However, as you will learn, certain shapes of passive antennas radiate the RF
energy supplied by the transmitter in one direction and consequently exhibit an effective
gain that is similar to amplification of the signal and is called directional gain. Consider the
two lamps in Figure 4-2. The light bulb on the left emits light energy all around it, except
from the base, much like an omnidirectional antenna. Conversely, if you put a reflector
around the light bulb, all of the light energy will be concentrated and emitted in one direc-
tion only, much like a directional antenna does.

Active Antennas Active antennas are essentially passive antennas with built-in ampli-
fiers. The amplifier is connected directly to the piece of metal that forms the antenna itself.
Most active antennas have only one electrical connection. The RF signal and the power for
the amplifier are supplied on the same conductor. This is intended to reduce the cost and
make active antennas easier to install. Active antennas are not common, due to their much
higher cost.
Antenna Sizes and Shapes
Antennas come in many sizes and shapes, depending on the following three characteristics:
●
The frequency that the antenna is designed to transmit and receive
●
The direction of the radiated electromagnetic wave
●
The power with which the antenna must transmit or how sensitive it needs to be to
receive very weak signals
The size of an antenna is inversely proportional to the frequency of the signal it is designed to
transmit or receive. Lower frequency signals require larger antennas. Conversely, higher fre-
quency signals require shorter antennas. For example, the antenna for an AM radio station
transmitting at the frequency of 530 KHz (530,000 Hz) is 566 feet (172.5 meters) long,
whereas that of a cellular telephone operating at a frequency of 900 MHz (900,000,000 Hz)
is just over 13 inches (33.33 centimeters) long. Antenna shapes vary according to their spe-
cific applications.
Omnidirectional Antennas Omnidirectional antennas are used to transmit and
receive signals from all directions with relatively equal intensity. Figure 4-3 shows two
examples of omnidirectional antennas for use in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. On the
left is a magnetic mount antenna, with an integrated cable designed for use in WLAN appli-
cations. These antennas are useful for improving signal reception over antennas that are
built inside laptop computers or permanently attached to a wireless NIC. Magnetic mount
antennas can be used in office environments, where they can be easily attached to any
metal surface, or they can be attached to the roof of a car or a truck for mobile applications.
On the right of Figure 4-3 is a “blister”-type ceiling mount antenna. Blister antennas are
typically used to hide the antenna or to make it blend with the decor.

Longer omnidirectional antennas usually have higher gain but are more difficult to mount
and hide. Later in this text, you will learn how the size of an antenna can affect its gain.
Figure 4-4 shows an example of a high-gain antenna of this type.
Figure 4-4
High-gain omnidirectional antenna
Omnidirectional antennas exhibit passive gain because they emit a signal in two dimensions
only, not in three dimensions, like an isotropic radiator. When viewed from the side, the RF
waves from an omnidirectional antenna propagate from the sides or the length of the antenna,
forming a doughnut-shaped pattern around it and are therefore somewhat focused.
Directional Antennas The shape of an antenna also affects the intended direction of
the radiated RF waves. A directional antenna is used to transmit a signal in one direction
only. Although this may sound obvious, it represents an important difference between omni-
directional and directional antennas. Directional antennas, by focusing the RF waves mostly
in one direction, concentrate the energy in one direction at the transmitter, or receive more
energy, in the case of a receiver antenna, from one direction. This means that they exhibit
more gain than an omnidirectional antenna.
Some types of directional antennas focus the RF energy more or less than others. A yagi
antenna emits a wider, less-focused RF energy beam, whereas a parabolic dish antenna emits
a narrow, more concentrated beam of RF energy. Yagi and dish antennas are both used for
longer distance outdoor applications, and dish antennas are typically used for links of
16 miles (25 kilometers) or more. Dish antennas are used in point-to-point links, each aimed
at one other dish antenna, but yagi antennas, in addition to being used in point-to-point
links, are also sometimes used to enhance the signal quality and extend the distance of links

to and from an omnidirectional antenna. One common application of a dish antenna is to
receive satellite signals. Figure 4-5 shows two different models of yagi antennas. Note that it
is not always easy to tell what type of antenna it is just by how it looks. Figure 4-6 shows a
typical parabolic dish antenna. In a dish antenna, the parabolic surface of the dish is used to
reflect the received signal onto the antenna element. At the transmitter end, the signal leaving
the antenna element is reflected by the dish and leaves the antenna in one direction only.

Patch antennas emit an RF energy beam that is horizontally narrow but vertically wider, or
taller, than that of a yagi antenna. Considered a semidirectional antenna, it is often used to
send RF energy down a long, narrow corridor, although some varieties are designed for
installation on the walls of buildings—for example, to send an RF signal in one direction
away from the structure where they are mounted. Cellular telephony antennas are also
designed to emit signals away from the tower or side of a building, where they are usually
mounted. Figure 4-7 illustrates an example of antennas used in a cellular telephone tower,
and Figure 4-8 shows a small patch antenna for use indoors.

Signal Strength and Direction
The distance between the transmitter and receiver determines the strength of the signal you
need to send, which in turn determines what size and shape of antenna you need for your
application. Recall that most antennas are of the passive type and that transmitters can only
produce finite amounts of RF energy. For most applications, active antennas can be
extremely expensive, and frequency-licensing restrictions limit the amount of power with
which signals may be transmitted.
What is the best solution? An omnidirectional antenna installed high and in a central location
works well for sending a signal in all directions, but the strength of the signal is divided more
or less equally in a 360-degree circle around the antenna. A directional antenna, on the other
hand, sends most the energy in the direction the antenna is pointed; therefore, the RF wave
travels farther than a signal sent from an omnidirectional antenna because the power is con-
centrated in one direction, an effect similar to the light bulb example shown in Figure 4-2.
Signals also lose energy as the electromagnetic wave travels away from the antenna. This
behavior is primarily the result of free space loss. Free space loss happens because RF waves
tend to spread away from the source of the signal (the antenna) similar to a circular wave
created by throwing a stone in a pond. The farther the waves move away from the stone’s
impact point, the smaller they get because the amount of energy the wave originally had
when the stone hit the water is distributed over an ever-growing and wider area. Eventually
the wave fades to the point that you can no longer detect much movement on the surface
of the water. If you place two floating objects on the water’s surface—one near the point
where the stone hits the water and another farther away—the one closer to the center point
will move more than the one farther away because less of the wave’s energy reaches the far-
ther object. This energy loss means that a receiver gets less of the energy sent by the transmit-
ter because the RF wave is spreading and its energy is dispersed over a wide area. However,
if you experiment with dropping a stone into water in a confined space, such as a bathtub,
124
Chapter 4

the movement of the wave is contained by the sidewalls of the tub, and the waves will travel
back and forth within the confines of the tub several times before they fade, the result is simi-
lar to multipath distortion, with waves getting affected by interacting with the reflected waves.
Free space loss can be calculated based on the strength of the signal coming out of the trans-
mitter, the loss caused by cables and connectors, the gain of the antenna, and other objects in
the path of the signal including, but not limited to, molecules of water (humidity) in the air.
You can find many free space loss calculator tools on the Internet by using your favorite
search engine to look for “free space loss calculator.”
When discussing passive antennas, remember that antenna gain is
directional gain (not power gain) due to focusing of the energy in
one direction.
Radio stations transmit their signals in all directions to reach the largest number of listeners.
Although they transmit with a lot of power, as you travel away from the city where the sta-
tion’s antenna is located, the signal gets weaker and weaker until your receiver can no longer
detect it and all you may be able to hear are intermittent fragments of the transmission mixed
with noise.
Some AM stations in the United States transmit with as much as
50,000 watts of power, and FM stations may send a signal with as
much as 150,000 watts of power. Higher-frequency signals need
more power to reach the same distance. In comparison, a typical
enterprise-class

transmits
with

(0.1 watts) of power, and a typical home wireless gateway (router) transmits with only about
30 milliwatts of power.
How Antennas Work
Designing antennas and understanding how they perform the magic of sending RF signals out
into air or space requires in-depth knowledge of physics, mathematics, and electronics. The
details of the science behind how antennas work are beyond the scope of this book and are
probably best left to higher-level courses in RF electronics. However, some general coverage
of basic antenna functionality should help you develop a better appreciation of the science
behind antennas. This section explains how antennas work as transmitters (radiators) and
receivers of radio frequency signals.
Wavelength
The length of a single RF sine wave, known as the wavelength, is what determines the size of
an antenna. An antenna transmits and receives a signal most efficiently at a specific frequency
when it is as long as the full length of the wave; this is called a full-wave antenna. In most
cases, this is not practical. For example, a full-wave antenna for an AM station might be
about 1857 feet (over 566 meters) long, whereas a typical cellular telephone antenna would
have to be just over 13 inches (33.33 centimeters) long. For practical reasons, antennas are
more commonly designed to be as long as an exact fraction of the wavelength, and these are
How Antennas Work
125

called half-wave antennas, quarter-wave antennas, and eighth-wave antennas. Though not as
efficient as full-wave antennas, these smaller antennas work well enough to ensure reliable
transmission and reception. The AM station antenna, for example, could be built as a
quarter-wave antenna at about 464 feet (141 meters), which is still quite large, and the cellu-
lar antenna, using the same ratio, would only be about 3.25 inches (8.25 centimeters) long,
which is about the size of one of today’s smartphones.
When antennas with a higher gain are required, you can increase the size of the antenna to
the next bigger fraction. A larger antenna exhibits a higher gain than a shorter antenna.
Almost any metallic object or any object that conducts electricity can act as an antenna, but
if you use an antenna that is much shorter than the wavelength of a particular frequency, it
will not radiate any significant amount of RF. Alternatively, if the antenna is much longer
than the wavelength, it will send out some RF energy, just not very efficiently, and this may
affect the reliability of the transmitter circuits as well.
The wavelength of an RF signal is usually given in metric values. The
formula for calculating the length of the wave, given that RF waves
travel through air or space at the average speed of light (300,000
kilometers per second) is: wavelength ¼ speed of light/frequency.
Using a value in feet-per-second or inches-per-second for the speed
of light will yield a result in feet or inches, respectively, for a particular wavelength. The aver-
age speed of light in miles-per-second is 186,000.
Antenna Performance
Antenna performance is a measure of how efficiently an antenna can radiate an RF signal.
The design, installation, size, and type of antenna can affect its performance.
Radiation Patterns
In antenna design, certain items such as fasteners, brackets, and support structures can affect
the way the antenna emits RF waves. During the testing phase of an antenna, engineers
develop a graphic called an antenna pattern by measuring the signal radiating from the
antenna. The antenna pattern indicates the direction, width, and shape of the RF signal
beam coming from the antenna. An antenna pattern is usually drawn as if you were looking
at it from the top. In the case of directional antennas, sometimes you will see an arrow indi-
cating the direction in which the RF signal is being emitted. Figure 4-9 shows examples of
antenna patterns.

Antenna Polarization
When a signal leaves an antenna, the waves have a particular orientation; in other words, the
oscillations are oriented either horizontally or vertically. The orientation of the wave leaving
the antenna is called antenna polarization. If you hold a cellular phone straight up in your
hand, the antenna is usually positioned vertically. The signal leaving the antenna in this case
will be vertically polarized, meaning that the sine waves will travel up and down when leav-
ing the antenna. If you are lying down when talking on the cellular phone, the signal leaving
the antenna is horizontally polarized, which is to say that the sine waves travel from side to
side on a horizontal plane. Cellular base station (tower) antennas are mounted vertically and
send out signals that are also vertically polarized. Antenna polarization is important because
the most efficient signal transmission and reception is experienced when the sending and
receiving antennas are equally polarized—that is, they are both either vertically or horizon-
tally polarized. Figure 4-11 illustrates this concept.

Antenna polarization
Most add-on USB wireless NICs used in laptop computers that stick out the side of the com-
puters are horizontally polarized, provided that the laptop computer is on top of a desk or
on your lap. The wireless residential gateways that the wireless NIC is transmitting to or
receiving from usually have their antennas mounted in a vertical position, which means that
the signal is not polarized the same direction as the signals emitted or received by the laptop
computer. Conversely, the built-in wireless NICs in laptops usually have the antennas
mounted on the back of the screen. Different polarization between devices can cause poor
communication between them. The utility software supplied with wireless NICs can show
the strength of the signal. If you experience poor reception, try placing the computer on its
side (carefully, of course) while monitoring the strength of the signal. You will most likely
see a small increase in signal strength due to the antennas having the same polarization.
Figure 4-12 shows a laptop computer with an add-on wireless NIC (horizontally mounted
antenna) and an AP with the antennas mounted vertically.

Antenna Dimensions
The design and construction of an antenna dictates whether it is one-dimensional or two-
dimensional.
One-Dimensional Antennas One-dimensional antennas are basically a length of
wire or metal. They can be built as a straight piece or bent in some shape, such as the old
“rabbit ear” antennas that used to be placed on top of television sets.
A monopole antenna is basically a straight piece of wire or metal, usually a quarter of the
wavelength, with no reflecting or ground element. As you learned earlier, dipole is the smal-
lest, simplest, most practical type of antenna. Dipoles are commonly built as two monopoles
mounted together at the base (the place where the cable(s) connect(s) to the antenna) and
laid out in a straight line, with the two ends facing away from each other. Figure 4-13
shows an example of a dipole antenna.

A monopole antenna is less efficient than a dipole. Dipoles can be built larger because they
are usually laid out horizontally. To work properly, monopole antennas are mounted in
such a way that they are practically sticking out of the ground (or very close to it) or some
other type of large structure that reflects the electromagnetic energy. Because the ground
reflects the waves, it acts as a reflector, and this makes the monopole antenna behave like a
dipole, rendering it more efficient. Alternatively, a monopole can be equipped with a large
metal base called a ground-plane to simulate the signal-reflecting effect of the ground and
increase its efficiency. The most common application of ground-planes is on boats that
have fiberglass hulls. Fiberglass is nonconducting and does not reflect radio waves; there-
fore, antennas for nautical radios usually have either a horizontal metal plate near the base
or, alternatively, four lengths of wire sticking out horizontally from the base, to act as the
ground-plane.
Two-Dimensional Antennas Antennas organized in a two-dimensional pattern, with
both height and width, are known as two-dimensional antennas. Examples include patch
and satellite dish antennas. A satellite dish works like a signal collector, scooping up any sig-
nal that comes in a straight line with the center axis of the antenna. A patch antenna is usu-
ally a flat piece of metal, with different heights and widths, depending on the desired vertical
and horizontal radiation angles. Another type of two-dimensional directional antenna is a
horn antenna, such as the one shown in Figure 4-14, which resembles a large horn with the
wide end bent to one side, in a parabolic curve. These antennas are common in telephone
networks and are used to transmit high-power microwave signals between two very distant
towers, usually over 18 miles (30 kilometers).

Smart Antennas
A newer development in antenna technology is the smart antenna. Used primarily in cellular
telephony and WiMAX, smart antennas use the strength of the signal coming from a mobile
device and “learn” where it is located, track it, and focus the RF energy in the device’s direc-
tion to avoid wasting energy, which also prevents interference with other antennas. Instead of
sending signals with wide beams, or spreading the energy over 360 degrees like omnidirec-
tional antennas, smart antennas send narrow beams of energy toward the receiver.
Figure 4-15 illustrates this concept. The illustration on the left shows a regular directional
antenna. The one on the right shows a smart antenna tracking a mobile receiver.

There are two classes of smart antennas:
●
A switched beam antenna uses several narrow beam antennas pointing in different
directions and turns each one on or off as the receiver moves across the path of the
beams, as shown in Figure 4-15.
●
An adaptive or phased array antenna is similar to a patch antenna but, instead of
being just a single piece of metal, is divided into a matrix of radiating elements.
A computer-based signal processor controls circuits in the antenna system, turning
elements of the matrix on or off as well as adjusting the phase of the transmission
signal supplied to each one as the mobile user moves across the front of the antenna.
This has the effect of sending the energy beam in a particular direction and is
sometimes called “beam forming.” The signal processor is also able to determine the
relative position of a mobile device by calculating its position based on the time
difference of receiving the signal in different antennas as well as the strength of the
signal.
Phased array antennas are used extensively in ultramodern radar systems. For example, you
may have noticed that newer warships have far fewer rotating radar antennas than older
ones. Phased array antennas are also used in aircraft nose radar systems. Because there are
no moving parts to wear out or break, this also makes these antennas a lot more reliable
and long lasting. This, in turn, helps to justify the higher cost of the smart electronics in
these antennas. Figure 4-16 shows an example of a large land-based phased array radar
antenna. Note the multiple antenna elements that make up the array.

Figure 4-18 shows how a transmitter varies the phase when transmitting the same signal
from different elements in an array. This makes the signal arrive in phase at a particular
physical location where the waves from different elements cross, which maximizes the sig-
nal’s strength at the receiver.

Phased array and switched beam smart antenna systems can be used for other applications as
well, such as cellular telephony and even for radio stations in areas where interference from
nearby radio transmitters operating in the same frequency range is very high. This can hap-
pen where large cities are relatively close to each other and the limited frequency spectrum
in the area is very crowded. However, due to the very high cost of these smart antenna sys-
tems, they are not very common.

Antenna System Implementation
The proper installation of antennas requires knowledge of the user’s requirements as well as
an ability to deal with various challenges, including physical obstacles, municipal building
codes, and other regulatory restrictions.
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, cellular providers spend a great deal of time
and effort designing and testing their antenna networks in order to provide the best signal
coverage and, hence, the best service to their customers. They also need to know what the
user traffic patterns are in a given area, and they need to obtain the proper permissions for
installation of antenna towers and atop buildings. In North America, obtaining permits from
the government or from private land or building owners takes longer and is more expensive
than in other countries around the world. As a result, cellular providers also need to be smar-
ter and more thorough at both maximizing coverage and minimizing interference.
The purpose of a single RF antenna or a system consisting of multiple antennas is to allow a
group of users to communicate reliably without wires. The system’s performance and reliabil-
ity are major concerns for the RF technician, and so is security. This is especially true today,
when unlicensed frequencies are often accompanied by maximum signal power restrictions, a
lack of support from regulatory agencies in case of conflict or interference, and easy access to
a wide range of equipment and software by untrained and inexperienced users and hackers.
When implementing wireless communications—such as when setting up a WLAN—using the
antennas supplied with the wireless devices limits you to placing the transmitters and receivers
where you can achieve a good connection. If you need to go beyond the standard setup, how-
ever—if, for example, you purchase several different external antennas to ensure good signal
reception in a difficult area or to create a long-distance outdoor link—there are a few addi-
tional things to consider.
You should not attempt to install towers or antennas outdoors with-
out proper training and insurance. Instead, you should always hire a
professional, insured installer for outdoor antennas, whether you are
installing them in towers, on the sides of buildings, or on the roofs
of houses or buildings.
Antenna Cables
Most antennas are connected to the transmitter or receiver using coaxial cable. This type of
cable is built in layers of wires (conducting) and insulators (nonconducting). Figure 4-19
illustrates the construction of a coaxial cable.

Coaxial cable construction
Coaxial cable is also used for audio, cable television, and a variety of
other applications. It is very important to always use the cable with
the right specifications for the intended application in order to avoid
problems that are difficult to troubleshoot.
Coaxial cables come in many sizes (thicknesses) and specifications. In an RF system, it is very
important to use the correct type of cable, per the equipment and antenna manufacturer spe-
cifications. Among the specifications is the impedance of the cable, which is the opposition to
the flow of alternating current in a circuit. Represented by the letter Z and measured in
ohms, impedance is the combination of the circuit’s resistance, inductance, and capacitance.
The cable’s impedance must match that of the transmitter circuit as well as that of the
antenna. When you need to connect an external antenna and it is not possible to attach it
directly to the transmitter output, you must consider the signal loss caused by the connectors
and by the cable itself. Almost all conducting materials add a resistance to the flow of elec-
tricity on a wire. This is particularly important in antenna cables and more so in equipment
that transmits at very low power—such as those used in IEEE 802.11 WLANs.
Cable loss is measured in relation to the length of the cable. The longer the cable, the more
loss occurs. In RF antenna applications you should use special low-loss antenna cables to
minimize signal loss. Table 4-2 lists LMR low-loss cables of varying thicknesses along with
the losses that occur at 2.4 GHz for every 100 feet (30 meters) of cable.

required length of your cable. For example, if you needed to install the antenna about

10 feet (3 meters) away from the transmitter, LMR-100 cable will introduce a loss of 3.9 dB
(39 dB/100 ¼ 0.39 dB per foot  10 ¼ 3.9 dB), which means that significantly more than
half of the energy produced at the transmitter output is lost, and that is before adding the
connector losses! Using LMR-400, the loss introduced by the cable will be only about 0.7 dB.
To keep loss at a minimum, you may have to use a cable that is too thick for the connector
type used in your transmitter, antenna, or both. The first consideration when deciding to
change the manufacturer-provided or equipment-mounted antennas should be the locations
of the transmitter and antenna(s). In addition, you should be aware that LMR cable is signif-
icantly more expensive than regular coaxial cable, easily costing over 10 times the price.
LMR cable is also difficult to add connectors to and difficult to bend, often making its instal-
lation a challenge.
RF Propagation
The way that radio waves propagate, or move, between the transmitter and the receiver
through the atmosphere of our planet depends on the frequency of the signal. RF waves are
classified in three groups, as shown in Table 4-3. Ground waves follow the curvature of the
Earth. Sky waves bounce between the ionosphere and the surface of the Earth. RF waves
transmitted in frequencies between 30 MHz and 300 GHz require a line-of-sight path
between the transmitter and the receiver antennas.

Point-to-Multipoint Links
In most wireless communications applications, one transmitter communicates with several
mobile clients. This is called a point-to-multipoint wireless link. If the receiver is installed in
a fixed location, as in the case of a central building in a campus with wireless links to other
buildings, it is possible to maximize the performance of an RF link by using an omnidirec-
tional antenna at a central location and directional, higher-gain antennas at the remote loca-
tions. Figure 4-21 illustrates this type of application.

Building 3
Building 2

Figure 4-21

Point-to-Point Links
Two computer networks in different buildings can be connected by a point-to-point wireless
link. In this case, directional antennas provide the most reliable method of transmitting RF
waves. Their narrow beams and high gain ensure that most of the energy of the RF wave
will be used between the two antennas. The cost is often much lower and the performance
comparable to or higher than that of a digital telephone company line. Telephone companies
make extensive use of point-to-point microwave links, instead of cables, for long-distance
voice and data communications. Although repeater towers are required, the cost of maintain-
ing a wireless link is usually much lower than the cost of installing and maintaining cables,
which can be easily damaged and are harder to troubleshoot. Figure 4-22 shows an example
of a point-to-point link.

Fresnel Zone
Although the transmission path for point-to-point links is usually represented by a straight
line, recall that RF waves have a tendency to spread out. This means that the space between
the two antennas would be more accurately represented by something similar to an ellipse
(see Figure 4-23). This elliptical region is called the Fresnel zone, and its shape is an impor-
tant consideration in wireless links. When planning a wireless link, at least 60 percent of the
Fresnel zone must be kept clear of obstructions, which may affect the height of the antenna
tower. If any obstruction, such as a tree or building, blocks more than 40 percent of the RF
signal, it blocks the radio signals completely. The Fresnel zone is sometimes referred to as RF
line of sight, and it is far more critical than visual line of sight, meaning that although a per-
son standing next to an antenna may be able to see the other antenna, the transceivers at
either end of a point-to-point wireless link may not be able to communicate.

The name “Fresnel” (pronounced Fray-nel) comes from the French
physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel, who studied the polarization of light
waves.
Link Budgets
Once you have considered the cables, antenna types, link type, and Fresnel zone of your
transmission, you still need to calculate whether you will have enough signal strength to
meet the receiver’s minimum requirements. This calculation is called a link budget and is
used in every type of outdoor wireless link, whether across the road or between a satellite
and an earth station.

The process involves all the variables that you have read about in this chapter. The calcula-
tions are not very complex, but there are many factors to consider. One of the simplest
ways to calculate a link budget is to download a spreadsheet or tool that is available on the
Internet at little or no cost. To calculate your link budget, you will need information from the
equipment specifications, including the gain of the antennas, cable, and connector losses for
the receiver and the transmitter, receiver sensitivity, and the free space loss figure.
Search the web for “Link Budget Calculator” and download one of
the spreadsheets. If you do not have access to Microsoft Excel or a
compatible spreadsheet application, you can also use one of the
online link budget calculators.
Antenna Alignment
One of the challenges of implementing a point-to-point link is to position the antennas at the
same height and point them toward one another to maximize the strength of the signal.
Recall that you must ensure that a minimum of 60 percent of the Fresnel zone is not blocked
by obstructions. The height at which the antenna will be mounted can be affected by trees,
buildings, and the curvature of the Earth. Some transmitters and receivers are equipped with
tools designed to assist the installers in aligning the two antennas. Others may require the
rental or purchase of additional tools to ensure perfect alignment. Some basic tools are essen-
tial, such as:
●
A compass to position the antenna in the correct direction
●
A spotting scope or binoculars, if the other antenna site is within visible range
●
A means of communication, such as a walkie-talkie or a cellular phone
●
A light source such as a flashlight or laser pointer, if the distance is reasonably short
●
A topological map that shows ground elevations in the area
●
Some way of determining the height of the building or tower where the antenna is to
be mounted
Technicians who often perform long-distance link installations and who need to align anten-
nas with a great degree of accuracy to ensure maximum reliability (as is the case with dish
antennas) are usually equipped with a spectrum analyzer, such as the one shown in
Figure 4-24. This tool displays the signal amplitude and bandwidth used by the signal, show-
ing a graphic of a signal in the frequency domain, instead of an oscilloscope which displays a
signal in the time domain (real-time wave graph). Spectrum analyzers can also display inter-
ference happening in a particular frequency channel, offer multiple display options, and are
expensive instruments, ranging in price from about $10,000 to over $100,000, depending
on usable frequency range and other features.

Antenna system implementation, including alignment and troubleshooting, demands hours of
practical training. Although it is beyond the scope of this book, this overview is included here
to give you a sense for the complex issues involved. Before moving on to other more practical
aspects of wireless communications, we will discuss some of the other challenges that affect
implementation, particularly of outdoor links.
Other Challenges of Outdoor Links
Recall that radio waves can reflect off, diffract, or be absorbed by various materials. Weather
phenomena (such as heavy fog, rain, dust, or snowstorms), air disturbances (such as air
masses rising quickly from the ground because of the sun heating up the surface in deserts
and other very hot areas), and significant drops in temperature that occur in deep valleys
during the course of a day—all can affect the performance and reliability of wireless links.
Seasonal changes can also impact a wireless link. For example, say it was set up in the win-
ter, when there were no leaves on the trees; when spring arrives, and the leaves grow, a tree
can block more than 40 percent of the Fresnel zone, absorbing most of the RF waves.
When planning an outdoor link, you should always consider the possibility that the link per-
formance will be seriously affected or the link will go down completely as a result of one or
more of the environmental conditions described. Check the history of the region’s weather.
Contact the municipal planning, parks, and building permit departments to identify short-
and long-term plans that may interfere with your intended link. And always take into
account how the positioning of an antenna may be affected by vegetation growth.
The possibility of another company or person setting up a link in which the RF wave beam
interferes with the one you set up is an additional concern. If you are using unlicensed fre-
quencies, such as the ISM or U-NII bands, you cannot count on assistance from regulatory
agencies or authorities. Of course, you should always be a good citizen and make sure you
are not interfering with anyone else’s signal before you set up an outdoor link.

Chapter Summary
■By the time an RF signal reaches the receiver, it can be a billion times smaller than
when it left the transmitter. Cables, connectors, antennas, and the distance between the
transmitter and receiver are all factors that affect how much energy a signal has when
it is transmitted and when it is received. A gain occurs when a signal power is
increased—for example, when most of the signal’s energy is focused in one direction
or when it is put through an amplifier before being routed to the antenna. A loss
occurs when the energy of a signal is decreased.
■The decibel (dB) is a relative measurement used by engineers and technicians to sim-
plify the calculations of gain and loss as well as to indicate the strength of a signal.
A gain of 3 dB doubles the signal’s power. A loss of 3 dB halves the signal’s power.
A gain of 10 dB increases the signal strength 10 times, and a loss of 10 dB decreases
the signal strength 10 times. Gains and losses expressed in dB can simply be added or
subtracted together.
■An isotropic radiator is a theoretically perfect sphere that radiates power equally in all
directions. The two most basic types of antennas are the theoretical isotropic radiator,
which is only used as a reference (given that it is not possible to build a working one),
and the dipole.
■The most common type of antenna is a passive antenna, which is basically a piece of
wire or metal that can only radiate a signal with as much power as is provided by the
transmitter. An active antenna has a built-in amplifier to boost the signal power and
compensate for the losses caused by cables and connectors.
■The size of an antenna depends primarily on the frequency or range of frequencies that
it is designed to transmit or receive, and this is directly proportional to the wavelength
of the signal and inversely proportional to the frequency—that is, a longer antenna is
required for lower frequencies, and a shorter antenna is used for higher frequencies.
To keep antennas at a manageable size, most are built as half-wave (half the wave-
length), quarter-wave (a quarter of the wavelength), or eighth-wave (an eighth of the
wavelength).
■Omnidirectional antennas transmit and receive signals from all directions. Directional
antennas focus the signal energy in one direction only, which has an effect (called
directional gain) in passive antennas that is similar to the gain provided by an ampli-
fier, only without adding any additional electrical power.
■Yagi, patch, and dish are different types of directional antennas.
■Free space loss is caused by the natural tendency of RF waves to spread out and is a
measure of the amount of loss of signal strength between the transmitter antenna and
the receiver antenna.
■Larger antennas have a higher gain; conversely, smaller antennas have lower gain.
■Antennas have a horizontal and a vertical radiation pattern. Antennas also emit a sig-
nal that is either vertically polarized or horizontally polarized. The most efficient com-
munications link is when the transmitter and the receiver antennas have the same
polarization.

■There are two basic types of one-dimensional antennas: monopole and dipole. The
dipole antenna is more efficient than the monopole antenna. Monopoles that are not
mounted at or near the ground can make use of an artificial ground-plane. Patch,
phased array, and dish antennas are examples of two-dimensional antennas.
■Smart antennas, used mostly in cellular telephone applications, can track a mobile user
and send a narrower, more efficient beam of RF energy directed at the user, which
also prevents interference with other transmitter antennas. A switched beam antenna
uses several narrow beam antennas pointing in different directions. An adaptive array
(or phased array) antenna has a matrix of radiating elements and uses a signal proces-
sor to enable or disable elements in order to send a focused beam of RF energy in the
direction of the mobile user.
■Special LMR antenna cables are used to reduce the signal loss between the transmitter
and the antenna.
■RF waves propagate differently depending on the frequency of the signal. Ground
waves follow the curvature of the Earth. Sky waves bounce between the ionosphere
and the surface of the Earth. RF waves transmitted in frequencies between 30 MHz
and 300 GHz require line-of-sight path between the transmitter and the receiver
antennas.
■Directional antennas build point-to-point links that connect two buildings using a
wireless link; they are also used by telephone carriers for long-distance microwave
communication links. Point-to-multipoint links can also be set up using an omnidirec-
tional antenna and multiple directional antennas.
■A Fresnel zone is an elliptical area between two directional antennas. When setting up
a wireless link in this way, maintaining a reliable connection requires that no more
than 40 percent of the Fresnel zone be blocked by obstructions.
■Directional antennas must be aligned with each other to maximize the strength of the
signal between the two. Although some wireless equipment manufacturers include
built-in tools to facilitate the alignment of antennas, technicians also use spectrum
analyzers to ensure high reliability, accuracy, and for troubleshooting wireless links.
■RF waves can be blocked, partially or completely, by weather phenomena and condi-
tions such as heavy rain, dust, or snowstorms. When designing a long-distance wireless
link, you should always check with the local authorities to make sure no buildings or
trees are planned for the area, because that could interfere with your connection.

transmitter is capable of generating a signal with a maximum signal strength
of +36 dBm at its output, and it will be installed indoors, whereas the antenna will be
installed on the roof. The cable provided is 50 feet of LMR-400 at both ends, which is
about 10 feet longer than what you need to connect between the antenna and the transmit-
ter. The receiver has a sensitivity of 86 dBm. Use an online or spreadsheet-based Link Bud-

Project 4-4
Many people have Wi-Fi reception issues in large houses or in apartment build-
ings where there may be a lot of interference. You may be able to improve the
signal quality significantly by building a simple parabolic reflector. Search the
web for “home-made Wi-Fi (or wireless) signal booster” and you should be able to find print-
able templates as well as videos that will guide you on how to make reflectors for a wireless
router that is equipped with external antennas or a portable reflector if you have an external
USB Wi-Fi NIC. Which one you decide to build will depend on the materials and tools you
have available, but the cost to build one is either very low or free. Test your setup with a lap-
top or other mobile device that can display the signal strength, and record the results. To test
for signal strength, you can use Acrylic Wi-Fi Home that was also used in Project 3-4, in
Chapter 3. Start the application, right-click to the left of the SSID column, click Selection in
the pop-up context menu, and then click Invert. Point to the SSID (or the name of your Wi-
Fi network) and left-click to the left of your Wi-Fi network name to show only the signal
graph for your network on the bottom part of the screen. Write a brief report showing the
strength of the signal you detected with and without the reflectors installed on the antennas
of the router or access point. Make sure your PC is at least 20 feet (6 meters) away from the
transmitting device while measuring. You should also test the speed of data transfer with and
without the reflector and report on any changes.
Real-World Exercise
Exercise 4-1
The Baypoint Group (TBG), a company of 50 consultants who assist organizations and busi-
nesses with issues involving network planning and design, has again requested your services
as a consultant.
Triangle Farms is a cooperative that grows vegetables and has two greenhouse locations
within 6 miles of each other on the outskirts of Bennington, Vermont. It wants to install a
wireless network in both locations but also wants to interconnect the two facilities. The
local telephone company has proposed to install a dedicated digital line to link Triangle’s
two locations and has argued that wireless links are not reliable and that they will end up
costing more than the $1,500 per month that the dedicated line will cost. Triangle has asked
TBG for an opinion. TBG has asked you to become involved because you are the expert they
always call upon to discuss and recommend antenna systems for wireless links.
TBG is providing the network design and implementation, along with all the wireless net-
working equipment required for the connection, except for the antennas linking the two
sites. The location of the warehouses allows for line-of-sight access to each other, and the
building codes do not allow tall buildings or towers in the area, as they are located near an
airport.
Each Triangle location has an office with about 10 staff members. The office area is large
and fairly open. Each of the greenhouses has two 500-foot corridors that require wireless
access because staff members perform periodic checks on the plant beds. The staff members
would like to be able to upload the updates and harvest predictions directly to the central
server using the wireless network.

For many years, there were few options for connecting and synchronizing your
smartphone with your laptop or desktop computer without carrying around a collection of
cables that matched each of the devices used. Each new type of device usually required con-
sumers to use a different type of cable. Controlling lights, security systems, heating, and
cooling was limited to the existing wiring in the home, and could only be done from inside
the house, even with some innovative systems that allowed control from a central location
within the house.
One of the first wireless technologies that appeared on the market used infrared light (IR).
Although infrared interfaces had been available for quite a long time in TV remotes, IR’s
original maximum speed of 115,200 bps limited the ability of a person to use it for transfer-
ring large amounts of data to or from wireless devices. The IR specification was later
enhanced, and speeds of 4 Mbps and even up to 16 Mbps were reached—comparable to
Fast Ethernet at the time. Despite being secure and extremely easy to use, however, IR
required close-range, point-to-point connectivity, and the lack of mobility eventually forced
manufacturers to abandon an interface technology that had dominated the world of porta-
ble devices for a few decades.
Since the late 1990s, many alternative technologies have appeared on the market, with the
primary goal of eliminating cables and allowing data devices and peripherals to communi-
cate without wires. This chapter discusses the now-popular Bluetooth, which is available on
computers, keyboards, mouse devices, smartphones, portable speakers, and many other pro-
ducts. It also discusses some of the latest developments in short-range, personal area net-
working, especially those products that are designed to eliminate some of the wires neces-
sary in homes and buildings for lighting, environmental controls, and home security.
What Is a Wireless Personal Area Network?
A wireless personal area network (WPAN) is a group of technologies used for short-range
communications—from a few inches or centimeters to usually about a maximum of 33 feet
(10 meters), but occasionally up to 100 feet (30 meters). Most of these technologies were
designed to eliminate the need for the large number of wires and cables to interconnect devices
such as computers, smartphones, and even room lights and security systems, and smoke and
fire detectors. The WPAN technologies discussed in this chapter are typically designed to sup-
port applications in which high-speed data transmission is not required and are thus known as
low-rate WPAN technologies. A large number of Bluetooth devices support a maximum data
rate of only 723.5 Kbps, for example. This is sufficient to handle up to three simultaneous
voice channels, but it is not enough to handle applications such as high-definition video.
Current Applications
Current and future applications for WPAN technology with low data rates include:
●
Home control systems (smarthome)
●
Connecting headsets to computers, smartphones, and other audio devices for voice
communications or listening
●
Portable device data exchange
●
Industrial control systems

●
Real-time location services—smart tags used to track the location of people and
equipment around the home or office
●
Security systems
●
Interactive toys
●
Keyboard and mouse connection to computers and portable devices
In addition to helping eliminate wires and cables, WPANs offer three other key advantages:
●
Because they are designed to communicate at short ranges, they generally use very little
power to transmit. Devices can be small and powered by batteries that usually last a
long time.
●
The short-range nature of transmissions, along with the fact that they seldom carry
sensitive personal data, helps provide a small amount of security and privacy.
●
Short-range transmissions also cause very little interference with other nearby RF
systems.
Existing Standards
The IEEE 802.15 group of standards discussed in this chapter covers the standards for two
wireless technologies: IEEE 802.15.1 for Bluetooth and 802.15.4 for ZigBee.
The IEEE 802.15.x standard covers all the different Working Groups
for WPANs. The last digit in the standard (indicated by the “x” above)
identifies a specific working group, such as “1” for Bluetooth, and
“4” for ZigBee.
As with the majority of other wireless standards created by the IEEE, they apply to both the
physical layer (PHY) of the OSI, which is responsible for converting the data bits into an elec-
tromagnetic signal and transmitting it on the medium, and the Media Access Control (MAC)
sublayer of the data link layer, which is responsible for the hardware addressing and control-
ling medium access and transfer of data between nodes in the same network segment and also
provides basic error detection. With a few exceptions, the Logical Link Control (LLC) sub-
layer of the data link layer, which is responsible for establishing and maintaining logical con-
nectivity to the local network, and all layers above it are usually defined in the specifications
for each technology.
Although the OSI model is most often associated with local area net-
works, it is actually used as a model for most types of network
communications.
Relationship Between the OSI Model and IEEE Project 802
At about the same time the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) was creat-
ing the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, the IEEE started working on Project
802, which is intended to ensure interoperability among data networking products at the
Existing Standards

two lower layers of the OSI. As you know, the seven-layer OSI is a theoretical model of how
data communication networks function, whereas IEEE 802 sets actual standards for the
implementation of hardware and software at the two lower layers. The IEEE used the OSI
model as a framework for its Project 802 specifications, but with some important differences
(see Figure 5-1).

OSI model versus IEEE Project 802 layers
IEEE 802 divides the data link layer of the OSI model into two sublayers: the Logical Link
Control (LLC) and the Media Access Control (MAC). The PHY layer in IEEE 802 is also
divided into two sublayers: the Physical Layer Convergence Procedure (PLCP) and the Physi-
cal Medium Dependent (PMD) sublayers. The PLCP formats the data received from the
MAC for transmission by adding a header and a trailer appropriate to the medium to be
used, creating what is called a frame—the same way an envelope “frames” a letter. A frame
is a string of data link layer bits that include the header and trailer required by the physical
medium for transmission by the PMD. It is at the PMD that the precise method for transmit-
ting and receiving data, such as frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS), for example, is
implemented.
RF WPANs
The remainder of this chapter discusses RF WPANs, beginning with IEEE 802.15.1 and
Bluetooth and continuing with IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee.
IEEE 802.15.1 and Bluetooth
Bluetooth is an industry specification that defines small-form-factor, low-cost, short-range
wireless radio communications operating in the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical
(ISM) band. In spite of how simple Bluetooth may be for users, it is a vast and complex tech-
nology. More than 14,000 companies, including hardware and software manufacturers, are
members of the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG). This introductory text covers some
of the most important aspects and functionality of Bluetooth.
Because Bluetooth works in the same 2.4 GHz frequency band as Wi-Fi and other wireless
technologies, the IEEE used a portion of the original Bluetooth specifications as the base
material for creating the 802.15.1 standard. This standard was designed to ensure that
154

Bluetooth networks can operate reliably in the same area as other technologies using the
2.4 GHz band, with a minimum of interference. The IEEE 802.15.1 standard received final
approval on March 2, 2002, and was then incorporated into version 1.2 of the Bluetooth
specification. Previous versions of Bluetooth had significant issues when working in the
vicinity of Wi-Fi networks.
You can find out more about Bluetooth technology and compatible
products by visiting www.bluetooth.com.
Practically all smartphones sold today are Bluetooth compatible, which means you can use
wireless headsets, synchronize the smartphone’s phone book with a computer, download
pictures from a camera-equipped phone, and connect to external speakers for playing and
sharing music. You can also find printers, print servers, GPS devices, computer keyboards,
computer mouse devices, tablets, medical equipment, gaming consoles, and even cooking
stoves that connect with microwave ovens using Bluetooth. Current laptop models already
include Bluetooth interfaces, and even if they don’t, adding Bluetooth capability is as easy as
plugging in a tiny, low-power USB adapter. Many other devices will likely incorporate
Bluetooth in the future, as an alternative to cables.
Bluetooth Protocol Stack
To help you learn how Bluetooth works, let’s begin with a tour of its protocol stack.
The functions of the lower layers of the Bluetooth protocol stack are implemented in the
hardware, whereas the functions of the upper layers are implemented in software. These
functions are discussed in the sections that follow. Figure 5-2 illustrates the Bluetooth proto-
col stack and compares it to the OSI and overall IEEE 802 protocol models.

Bluetooth RF Layer At the lowest level of the Bluetooth protocol stack is the RF layer.
It defines how the basic radio hardware controls the transmissions. At this level, the data
bits (0 and 1) are converted into radio signals and transmitted. As shown in Figure 5-2,
this layer is equivalent to the OSI Physical layer.
Radio Module At the heart of the Bluetooth RF layer is a single radio transmitter/
receiver (transceiver) called a Bluetooth radio module. (See Figure 5-3 to get a sense of its
size when compared to the tip of a pencil.) This device includes a tiny Bluetooth chip,
which houses the radio module. Except for the antenna, which is part of the printed circuit
board where the chip is mounted, this chip is the only hardware required for Bluetooth to
work. Power is provided via a USB interface chip that is also included in the device shown
in Figure 5-3. Bluetooth was designed so that the transceiver that performs all the MAC
and PHY functions would fit into a single chip, be as generic or “mainstream” as possible,
be low cost, require a minimum of off-chip supporting components, and consume a very
small amount of power.
Figure 5-3
Bluetooth transceiver (transmitter/receiver)
Bluetooth can transmit at a data rate of up to 1 Mbps under Bluetooth specification versions
1.1 and 1.2. The actual maximum data rate is only approximately 721 Kbps because of the
overhead bits used in frame headers. Version 2.1 adds two new modulation schemes that
can increase data rates of 2.1 or 3 Mbps. The higher speeds are called enhanced data rate
(EDR). Version 3.0 introduced four other enhancements designed to resolve issues related
to power consumption in EDR that could cause momentary loss of headset connections, a
connectionless data streaming feature, as well as an optional add-on radio that can achieve
data transmission rates of up to a maximum of 24 Mbps, but at the cost of adding more
hardware and consuming a considerably larger amount of power. Version 4.0 adds a low-
energy transmission capability to extend battery life. All these versions of Bluetooth main-
tain full backward compatibility with versions 1.1 and 1.2.
Bluetooth Power Classes and Transmission Ranges Bluetooth has three
power classes that determine the communication range between devices; the classes are sum-
marized in Table 5-1. Keep in mind that because Bluetooth is based on RF transmission,
objects such as walls as well as interference from other RF signal sources (such as Wi-Fi net-
works) can reduce the range of transmission.

Modulation Techniques Versions 1.x of Bluetooth use a variation of frequency shift
keying (FSK) that uses two different carrier signal frequencies (nothing is modulated onto
the carriers). Bits transmitted at a higher frequency have a value of 1, and those sent at a
lower frequency have a value of 0. The variation of FSK used by Bluetooth is known as
two-level Gaussian frequency shift keying (2-GFSK). This is illustrated in Figure 5-4.

The two new modulation schemes in Bluetooth version 2.x are pi/4-DQPSK (for 2 Mbps
transmission) and 8-DPSK (for 3 Mbps transmission). Figure 5-5 shows a pi/4-DQPSK
waveform. As for 8-DPSK, it can only be used when the signal quality between two devices
is robust—in other words, when there is very little or no interference. In fact, it may only be
possible to achieve 3 Mbps in Bluetooth when there are no other transmissions of any kind
nearby, especially in the same frequency range.

The Bluetooth version 3.0 less power-hungry modes of operation allow batteries to last lon-
ger by detecting the signal quality and reducing the transmit power when possible. Version
3.0+HS (also referred to as version 3.1) added an alternate MAC/PHY (AMP). AMP uses
a separate radio module that transmits using a method that is similar to Wi-Fi (discussed in
the next chapters). Once devices establish a normal Bluetooth connection, if both devices
support AMP, then they can switch to the alternative radio module for faster data transfers.
Due to the simpler Bluetooth protocol stack when compared to Wi-Fi, it may be possible to
achieve data rates as high as 24 Mbps. In this case, all control communications continue to
be handled by the RF layer that is compatible with Bluetooth version 1.x, which also
ensures backward compatibility with previous versions of the specification.
Bluetooth version 4.0, ratified on June 30, 2010, introduced Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
BLE was based on Nokia’s Wibree specification, which was developed in 2001, and BLE-
capable devices are designed to transmit at a maximum rate of 270 Kbps (although typically
128 Kbps). This also has the effect of increasing the transmission range to approximately
50 feet (15 meters) while reducing power consumption from tens of milliamps to an average
of just a few microamps. As a comparison with non-BLE devices, this could make a button-
sized battery last up to one year before needing to be replaced. The technology is partially
aimed at competing with near-field communications (NFC, discussed in Chapter 11) and
can be implemented by simply enhancing existing Bluetooth radios, thus avoiding costly
design and deployment of additional devices to support NFC. BLE can also compete with
ZigBee (discussed later in this chapter).
Most current smartphones and tablet computers already support Bluetooth Smart Ready, the
marketing brand for BLE. As early as March 2011, the Apple iPhone 4S and iPad 2 included
support for BLE and were compatible with a number of devices—heart monitors, smartwatches
that display emails and caller ID information, and several others. Bluetooth specification version
4.1 also allows devices such as a smartwatch to act as a data collection hub, gathering informa-
tion off line from sensors such as a heart rate monitoring belt and other similar types of sensors.
This means that the user does not need to have a smart device such as a phone turned on or
even be near it while gathering data. The information will be transferred to the smartphone at
a later time, when the user turns the phone on or is near the phone again.
Bluetooth Baseband Layer The Baseband layer lies on top of the RF layer in the
Bluetooth stack. This layer manages physical connection channels and links, handles packets,
and performs the functions required to locate and connect to other Bluetooth devices in the area.

Radio Frequency The part of the spectrum in which Bluetooth operates is the 2.4 GHz
ISM band. Bluetooth divides the 2.4 GHz frequency into 79 frequencies, each 1 MHz wide,
and uses the FHSS technique to transmit data. The specific sequence of frequencies used in
FHSS—the hopping sequence—is called a channel. In other words, the frequency used
for transmitting data could be said to hop (i.e., change rapidly) through the 79
different frequencies during transmission. The FHSS technique is shown in Figure 5-6. In
just 1 second of a Bluetooth transmission, the frequency changes 1,600 times, or once
every 625 microseconds.
Normally, the term channel would refer to a frequency range in RF.
In FHSS, the term is also used to refer to a group of 79 frequencies
that form the hopping sequence in a Bluetooth piconet.

Bluetooth FHSS
The Bluetooth hopping sequence is significantly faster than that of
most residential cordless telephones that also work in the 2.4 GHz
band and that usually switch frequencies approximately 100 to
150 times per second. The interference to a Bluetooth transmission
that is caused by cordless phones can result in data errors or signifi-
cant breakups in the voice stream. This interference is caused by the wider frequency channels
used by cordless phones.

Because they use the same frequency band as IEEE 802.11b/g/n WLANs, Bluetooth trans-
missions can interfere with 802.11 WLANs and vice versa. However, after the ratification
of IEEE 802.15.1 and subsequent inclusion of this standard in Bluetooth version 1.2 specifi-
cation, Bluetooth networks coexist with 802.11 WLANs with a minimum of interference
and disruption. That is because version 1.2 added a feature called adaptive frequency hop-
ping (AFH), which greatly enhances compatibility with 802.11 WLANs operating in the
2.4 GHz band. Bluetooth accomplishes this by allowing the master device in a Bluetooth
network to change the hopping sequence so that devices will not transmit in the RF channel
occupied by 802.11 in the piconet area.
Coexistence with other wireless devices operating in unlicensed fre-
quency bands is covered under the IEEE 802.15.2 standard. For more
information, see http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/index.html.
Bluetooth Network Topologies A Bluetooth device can scan the wireless medium,
discovering and connecting to devices in its transmission range, which varies depending on
the power class of device used. A Bluetooth network, called a piconet, can have up to one
master and seven slave devices. The master device initiates the discovery of slave devices
within RF range.
When two Bluetooth devices come within range of each other, they can automatically con-
nect with one another. The master controls all communications in the piconet and slaves
can only communicate with the master, never with each other. A Bluetooth network that
contains one master and at least one slave, and that uses the same FHSS channel, forms a
piconet. Examples of piconets are shown in Figure 5-7.

Piconet radio module addresses
All devices in a piconet must change frequencies at the same time and in the same sequence
in order for communication to take place. The timing in the hopping sequence, called the
phase, requires that each active slave be synchronized with the master’s clock. The hopping
sequence is unique for each piconet and is determined by the master’s Bluetooth device
address combined with the master’s clock.
In a Bluetooth piconet, the master and slaves alternately transmit.
The master transmits in odd-numbered time slots, and the slaves
transmit in even-numbered time slots.
Bluetooth Connection Procedure Before two devices communicate using Bluetooth,
the first thing that needs to happen is they need to be paired to each other. For security
reasons, pairing requires user intervention to make the devices discoverable. Each Bluetooth
device has its own way of accomplishing this task, and that is listed in the device’s docu-
mentation. Pairing is a two-step process:
1. The first step is performed by the Bluetooth devices without user intervention. This is
known as the inquiry procedure, and it enables a device to discover which other Blue-
tooth devices are in range and determine the addresses and clocks for those devices.
When a Bluetooth device enters the range of other devices, it first attempts to find
other Bluetooth devices in the area.
2. The second step is known as the paging procedure, and it is when an actual Bluetooth con-
nection between two devices is established. During this step, a user must enter a pairing code
in at least one of the devices. The pairing code is usually preset by the manufacturer for smal-
ler devices such as headsets or speakers. To connect smartphones and computers, a random
pairing code is usually generated by one of the devices and entered by the user on the other
one. Once a Bluetooth device is paired with another it receives a 3-bit active member address
and communication can begin. The master periodically sends out a page in an attempt
to establish a connection with known or paired devices, so that when they are turned on
and in range, they will reconnect automatically. The device that carries out a paging proce-
dure and establishes a connection will automatically become the master of the connection.
Multiple piconets can be active in the same area. Because each piconet has a different master
and hop sequence, the risk of collisions between two devices attempting to transmit at the
same time on the same frequency is slim.
It is possible for a Bluetooth device to be a member of two or more overlapping piconets.
This is called a scatternet (see Figure 5-8). To communicate in each piconet, the device

must use the master device address and clock of that specific piconet; these are supplied by
the master of each piconet.

A Bluetooth device can be a slave in several piconets, but it can be a master in only one pic-
onet. A master and slave can switch roles in a piconet, but only devices, such as smart-
phones or computers, are usually capable of becoming a piconet master. Most headsets and
similar smaller devices can only be paired to one master, although a few are capable of con-
necting to more than one.
Bluetooth Packets Because Bluetooth transmissions are limited to very small networks,
they use a very simple packet structure. The basic packet format for Bluetooth transmissions
is shown in Figure 5-9. Each packet consists of three parts:

Bluetooth Link Manager Layer
The Link Manager layer of the Bluetooth stack can be divided into two broad functions:
managing the piconet and security.
Managing Links Between Bluetooth Devices Managing the piconet involves
regulating the steps for attaching and detaching slaves from the master as well as overseeing
the master-slave switch. To accomplish this, different types of links have to be established
between Bluetooth devices. There are three basic types of physical links between devices:
●
A synchronous connection-oriented (SCO) link is a bidirectional, symmetric point-
to-point link, meaning that the data rate is the same between a master and a single
slave in both directions, using 1, 2, or 3 reserved time slots. This link functions like a
circuit-switched link by using reserved time slots at fixed intervals and is used to send
user data only. A master and slave can each support up to three simultaneous SCO
links. A SCO link carries mainly voice transmissions at a speed of 64 Kbps. This type
of link is typically used for a full-duplex connection, such as when using a headset
connected to a smartphone during a phone call. To reduce latency, packets are never
retransmitted in a SCO link.
●
An extended synchronous connection-oriented link (eSCO) link is similar to a SCO
link. It is also bidirectional, but can be symmetric or asymmetric (different data rates
for master to slave and slave to master), and is used for point-to-point, constant rate
data, but with limited retransmissions in case errors should happen.
●
An asynchronous connectionless (ACL) link is a reliable packet-switched link used for
data transmissions. In case of errors data is retransmitted, but Bluetooth can use three
different methods to reduce retransmissions (discussed later). A master can use ACL
links to transmit data to a single slave (point-to-point) or to a group of slaves at the
same time (point-to-multipoint). In the time slots not reserved for the SCO links, the
master can establish an ACL and transfer data to any slave. A slave already engaged in
an SCO link can also have an ACL link. ACL links are used to exchange control
information or for user data.
There are also two other types of Bluetooth links that are used for sending unreliable, unidi-
rectional (master to slaves), connectionless broadcast messages to all slaves in the piconet.
These are discussed in the Bluetooth Power Usage section that follows.
Table 5-3 shows a summary of the basic types of link configurations in a piconet for both
ACL and SCO links.

If an error occurs on an ACL packet, that packet is retransmitted. A
SCO packet is never retransmitted.
Error Correction Another management function of the Link Manager layer is error cor-
rection. There are three kinds of error-correction schemes used in the Bluetooth protocol:
●
1/3 rate Forward Error Correction (FEC)—Repeats every bit three times for
redundancy. The maximum data rate is effectively divided by 3, hence “1/3 rate.”
●
2/3 rate Forward Error Correction (FEC)—Adds extra bits that are examined by the
receiving device to determine if an error took place in the transmission. The extra bits
reduce the maximum data rate that can be achieved for a transmission but allows the
receiver to detect multiple bit errors and correct single bit errors, avoiding the need to
retransmit the data.
●
Automatic retransmission request (ARQ)—If a Bluetooth packet is not using one of
the above FEC schemes and is not acknowledged, the transmitting device will
continuously retransmit a data-only or data-voice packet until an acknowledgment is
received or until a timeout value is exceeded. Recall that this applies only to reliable
ACL links. ARQ is not used in unreliable SCO links.
Bluetooth Power Usage Because most Bluetooth devices are designed to be mobile
and because they consume power from what is often a very small battery, conserving
power is essential. The power consumption of Bluetooth devices varies depending on their
connection modes and the size and type of battery used. Voice transmissions through a
headset use only 10 milliamps (mA). Data transmissions use only 6 mA and when not trans-
mitting, Bluetooth uses only 0.3 mA, which means a battery charge can last from days to
months if the device is left on but not used. The only way to know how long a battery will
last is to consult the manual for a specific Bluetooth device.
Although amps and watts can sometimes be confusing, think of
watts as a measure of the actual power used to push the radio signal
out, and think of amps as a measure of the power that is needed to
make that push.
Once connected to a piconet, a Bluetooth device can be in one of four power modes:
●
Active—In active mode, the Bluetooth device actively participates on the channel and
consumes an amount of power that corresponds to the type of data being transmitted.
Over a period of time, this averages out to 2.5 mW in a Power Class 2 device.
●
Sniff—In sniff mode, a slave device turns off its transmitter and only listens to the
piconet master so that it uses less power. The interval is programmable and depends
on the application. It is the least efficient of the power-saving modes.
●
Hold—The master device can put slave devices into hold mode, in which only the
slave’s internal timer is running. Slave devices can also demand to be put into hold
164

mode to conserve power. In this mode, devices are still active in the piconet and will
turn their receivers on periodically to listen to the master.
●
Park—In park mode, the most efficient of the power-saving modes, a device is still
synchronized to the piconet but are not active in the piconet. These slaves occasionally
listen to the traffic of their master in order to resynchronize and check for broadcast
messages but cannot transmit unless the piconet has less than seven active slaves and
they request permission from the master to rejoin. Power consumption in this mode is
a mere 0.3 mA. There can be up to 255 parked slaves in a piconet.
A piconet master sometimes needs to send a broadcast message to parked slaves. This is the
other type of logical link discussed previously, that can happen in a Bluetooth network, and
it is used by the master to “unpark” a slave if there are packets waiting to be sent.
Other Bluetooth Protocol Layers and Their Functions
The Logical Link Control Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP; refer to Figure 5-2) is the layer
responsible for segmenting and reassembling data packets, which are then sent through stan-
dard data protocols such as TCP/IP for transmission, multiplexing, and quality of service
information. The Radio Frequency Communications (RFCOMM) protocol layer provides
serial port emulation for Bluetooth data. This layer emulates a computer’s serial port and
packages the data so that it appears as if it were sent through the computer’s standard serial
port, which is another feature of Bluetooth.
Control information is also transmitted between devices, such as an instruction for a device
to switch from master to slave. This control information comes through the Link Manager
layer but then bypasses the L2CAP layer, which is only used when transmitting data
streams.
Bluetooth Profiles The ability of a Bluetooth device to perform certain types of func-
tions is defined by a series of profiles that are located at the Application layer of the
Bluetooth protocol stack. These are implemented in the software driver used with Bluetooth
devices. Profiles define the interactions required between the Bluetooth protocol stack layers
to accomplish a certain task, such as playing music and being able to control the music
using buttons located in a headset or speaker. As an example, for a Bluetooth device to oper-
ate as a remote control—to control a slide show using Microsoft PowerPoint, for example—
it must support the AVRCP (Audio/Video Remote Control) profile. A headset, on the other
hand, would typically implement the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP).
A comprehensive list of Bluetooth profiles currently adopted by the
Bluetooth SIG can be found on the bluetooth.com website. Once
you open the main page, use the search box to locate “Profiles.” At
the bottom of the page you should see a link to the most up-to-date
list of Bluetooth profiles.
IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee
Another WPAN technology designed to replace cables and wires is ZigBee. Based on the
IEEE 802.15.4 standard, ZigBee is primarily aimed at providing wireless connectivity
between simple stationary devices or mobile devices—such as remote controls—that require
RF WPANs

very low data rates (between 20 and 250 Kbps), consume minimal amounts of power, and
connect at distances from 33 feet (10 meters) to about 300 feet (100 meters). There are a
couple of other specifications promoted by different organizations to perform similar
smarthome monitoring and control functions like Insteon and ZWave, but ZigBee is the
only truly global standard at this writing.
The ZigBee Alliance, formed in 2002, created a set of specifications for monitoring and con-
trolling devices over a wireless link. At the time, there was no global, open standard that
enabled manufacturers to build low-cost devices that could interoperate with those of other
countries. The requirements for monitoring sensors and for control systems are different from
those for other wireless computer networks. Although several manufacturers have implemented
devices designed for control and monitoring functions using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, these tech-
nologies were originally designed for the transmission of either large amounts of data, for
cable replacement, or for voice and video. Unlike ZigBee, Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 were
also not originally designed to support mesh networking. The ZigBee specification is also far
more open, and this helps reduce implementation costs.
The ZigBee specification uses the 802.15.4 standard for the PHY and
MAC layers. ZigBee covers all of the layers above IEEE 802.15.4. You
can access the ZigBee specifications at www.zigbee.org. The IEEE
802.15.4 standard is located at http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802
/index.html.
The ZigBee Alliance has expanded its specifications to include several industry-specific sets of
interoperable standards, including ZigBee Health Care, ZigBee Home Automation, ZigBee
Smart Energy, ZigBee Telecom Services, and the ZigBee Building Automation and ZigBee
Retail Services specifications, among others.
IEEE 802.15.4 can operate in the 868 MHz range in Europe, 915 MHz in North America,
and the 2.4 GHz range that is also part of the ISM band. Applications for ZigBee-compliant
devices include:
●
Lighting controls
●
Automatic meter readers for natural gas, electricity, water, and similar systems
●
Wireless smoke and carbon monoxide detectors
●
Home security sensors for doors and windows
●
Environmental controls for heating and air-conditioning systems
●
Controls for window blinds, draperies, and shades
●
Equipment for wireless patient monitoring, such as heart-rate and blood pressure
monitors
●
A universal remote control for televisions and set-top boxes, including home control
functions—such as lighting and temperature
●
Industrial and building automation controls for remote machine monitoring
●
Location-based services; calculates distances and determine locations indoors, without
using GPS
●
And many others

The ZigBee specification is based on the relatively low-level performance requirements of sen-
sors and control systems, such as light switches. ZigBee-compliant devices are designed to
remain quiescent (without communicating) for long periods of time.
When a ZigBee device is connected to the network but is no longer needed, it can turn itself
off, thereby consuming much less power. As a result, ZigBee battery-powered devices are
capable of operating for several years before their batteries need to be replaced. Devices can
wake up any time they need to communicate, follow the network access protocol, and then
transmit on the specific network’s channel, which is already known, from when the device
first connected to the network. Once they have performed their functions, they can return to
sleep mode by turning themselves off again. Their average duty cycle, the percentage of time
they transmit or receive data, is between 0.1 percent and 2 percent of the time, which means
that ZigBee-compliant devices use very little power. For example, if a ZigBee device wakes
up every 60 seconds and turns on its radio for about 60 milliseconds while it communicates
on the WPAN, its batteries can last for several years.
Although ZigBee transmissions are designed to be short in range, the specification includes
full mesh networking. This means that ZigBee devices that are powered from an electrical
outlet can route packets to other devices, which allows them to reach beyond their radio
ranges. In fact, given that each network can simultaneously support 64,000 nodes, a ZigBee
network can cover a large area, such as an entire house, conference center, office building, or
manufacturing plant. This makes ZigBee technology ideal for sensors and control applica-
tions even in tall office buildings.
Mesh networking is supported, but not included, as part of the
IEEE 802.15.4 standard. This means that other technologies that use
IEEE 802.15.4 may or may not support mesh networking. However,
mesh networking is an integral and important part of the ZigBee
specification.
There are three basic classes of devices in a ZigBee network:
●
Full-function device (FFD)—A full-function device can connect to other full-function
devices and route control and data frames in addition to connecting to endpoint
devices in a parent-child relationship. Full-function devices can maintain connections
to multiple devices.
●
PAN coordinator—The first full-function device that is turned on in an area usually
becomes the PAN coordinator, and it starts and maintains the network. Coordinators
are always plugged in to electricity and never turn themselves off, which allows the
ZigBee network to remain available to all other devices. They can also be equipped
with a backup battery.
●
Reduced-function device (RFD)—This is an endpoint device—such as a light switch or
a lamp—that can only connect to one full-function device on the network and can only
join the network as a child device. Child devices do not connect to other child devices.
ZigBee Network Topologies There are three basic topologies for ZigBee networks:
star, tree, and mesh, as shown in Figure 5-10. Topologies are an important part of learning
about ZigBee networks since many of its capabilities are dependent on the topology sup-
ported and implemented.

Topologies supported in ZigBee networks
In both tree and mesh topologies, alternate paths may be available for packets to reach an
endpoint device. However, in tree and cluster tree networks, alternate paths may only be
available to a child or to an FFD if another FFD is within its radio range. If a full-function
routing device loses the connection to another full-function device, it will automatically use
one of its alternate connections, if available, so that it can still route frames to other parts
of the network. These are important considerations when installing a ZigBee network.
The IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines only two topologies: star and
peer-to-peer, given that a cluster tree network essentially consists of
multiple star topology networks.
Figure 5-11 shows multiple paths for packets that are routed in a ZigBee mesh network.
Note that the mesh network itself is made up of full-function devices connected in a peer-
to-peer fashion, although each of these can have other RFD child devices connected to
them. Provided that all full-function routing-capable devices are able to connect to one
another, forming a mesh-like topology, packets can be routed along the network to other
devices.
In a star or hub-and-spoke topology, a single device, the PAN coordinator, controls the net-
work. All other devices are known as end-nodes, regardless of whether they are FFDs or
not. Because all devices are connected to a coordinator, they only communicate directly
with the coordinator, which will in turn transfer commands and data to all other devices.

Routing of data packets in a ZigBee mesh network
Cluster tree topologies are made up of two or more tree topology networks that are inter-
connected by FFDs. Cluster tree networks have a slight advantage over mesh networks. In
a mesh network, performance is diminished because each FFD must maintain a routing
table and make decisions on the best route to use when forwarding the packets. However,
the reliability of a cluster tree network is not as high as that of a mesh network, because
the failure of an interconnecting device can prevent an entire tree from communicating with
other trees and other devices on the network, perhaps preventing a light switch from turning
on a lamp located at the other end of the room or building. Figure 5-12 shows an example
of a larger cluster tree network. Notice the connections between trees; also notice that each
cluster tree uses a different channel to communicate between devices. Each ZigBee router
(FFD) must be able to communicate on both channels in order to act as an interface between
two trees of a cluster tree topology.

ZigBee Protocol Stack The ZigBee protocol stack is based on the OSI seven-layer
model but defines only those layers that are relevant to achieving the specific functions
required in the ZigBee specifications. Shown in Figure 5-13, the ZigBee protocol stack has
the following characteristics:

●
It has two options for the PHY layer. Each one operates in a different frequency range.
The lower-frequency PHY layer covers both the 868 MHz band used in Europe and
the 915 MHz band used in North America and Australia. The higher-frequency PHY
layer uses the 2.4 GHz ISM band; it is used worldwide.
●
The MAC sublayer controls access to the radio channel. Its responsibilities include
synchronization and providing error checking for the reliability of communications.
●
The Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer complies with the IEEE 802.2 LLC and is
responsible for managing the data-link communication, link addressing, defining
service access points, and frame sequencing. A second LLC sublayer is included in the
specification to support alternative protocols and functionality.
The upper layers of the ZigBee protocol stack include specific procedures that devices use to
join a network (called an association), leave a network (called a disassociation), apply secu-
rity to frames, and perform routing. These layers are also responsible for device discovery,
maintaining routing tables, and storing information about neighbor devices.
The PHY layer in a ZigBee device is responsible for turning the radio transceiver on and off,
detecting the presence of an RF signal in the currently selected channel, analyzing and report-
ing link quality for received packets, assessing whether the channel is clear before initiating a
transmission, selecting a frequency channel for operation, and transmitting and receiving data.
Altogether, there are 27 channels across the various frequency bands that can be used in
IEEE 802.15.4. A single channel that is 600 KHz wide is available in the 868 MHz band;
10 channels that are 2 MHz wide are in the 915 MHz band; and 16 channels that are
5 MHz wide (although it only uses 2 MHz for transmission) in the 2.40 GHz band.
Table 5-4 presents the frequency bands and data rates for 802.15.4 WPANs.

You may recall from Chapter 2 that binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation uses two
different starting points of an analog wave—typically at 0 degrees and 180 degrees—to
encode a digital signal onto an analog wave. However, since DSSS transmission spreads
the signal over the bandwidth of the channel, the carrier is modulated with a sequence of
15 chips, instead of the data bits themselves, in both the 868 and 915 MHz bands. To send
a binary 1, the sequence 000010100110111 is transmitted at the chip rates indicated in
Table 5-4; to send a binary 0, the sequence 111101011001000 is transmitted.
In the 2.4 GHz band, transmissions use 16 different 32-chip sequences called symbols. Each
of the 16 different 32-chip sequences in this band transmits a different combination of
4 bits.

These 32-chip sequences are then modulated using a technique called offset quadrature
phase shift keying (O-QPSK), which uses two carrier waves, at different frequencies, that
are exactly 90 degrees out of phase and therefore do not interfere with each other. It modu-
lates some of the chips on one carrier and some on the other. Finally, the two signals are
combined and transmitted. Figure 5-14 illustrates the modulation of each signal separately;
one is called I-Phase, for “in-phase,” and the other is called Q-Phase, for “quadrature
signal.” The resulting waveform, after combining the two carriers, is similar to QPSK, dis-
cussed in Chapter 2.

●

Most of the time, access to the wireless medium in a ZigBee network is contention-based,
which means that all devices, before transmitting, listen to the medium to determine if the
frequency channel is free. If the channel is busy, the devices will back off and not transmit
for a random amount of time and then repeat the process of sensing if there are any trans-
missions, at which point they will wait for the channel to be clear before transmitting. This
process is called carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). Because
a collision during a wireless transmission can only be detected if a packet is not understood
by the intended receiver and acknowledgement is not sent back to the transmitting device,
wireless transmissions can avoid, but not actually detect, collisions.
In Ethernet, collisions are detected by using a voltage sensor on the
cable, but in wireless there is no way to know what the amplitude
of the signal will be, at the receiver end, due to variations in attenu-
ation that can be caused by distance-related loss or by obstacles in
the path of the signal. In addition, wireless devices typically use a sin-
gle radio, which means that they cannot receive and transmit simultaneously. Consequently,
devices assume that there must have been a collision—or some other phenomenon that
destroyed the frame—if they do not receive an ACK from the intended receiver.
ZigBee and IEEE 802.15.4 Communication Basics When a ZigBee device needs
to determine if a channel is clear, it can do it in one of two ways. The first way is by
enabling the receiver to detect and estimate the amount of RF signal energy in the medium.
In this case, the devices do not attempt to receive or decode any data—that is, they do not
look for an IEEE 802.15.4 transmission; they only try to estimate the energy level in the
wireless medium, which would indicate that another device is transmitting in the same
frequency channel. (Note that in energy detection this could be any other type of device
transmitting in the same frequency range—such as a laptop computer transmitting using
Wi-Fi—and not necessarily another ZigBee device). This procedure is called energy detection
(ED).
The second way for a ZigBee device to decide if a channel is clear is to perform a carrier
sense. In this case, the device looks for a specific 802.15.4 signal, and it attempts to decode
the data transmission before deciding that the channel is busy. If the channel is not clear of
transmissions, the device backs off—does not transmit—for a random amount of time. The
process is repeated until the frequency channel is clear of other 802.15.4 transmissions.
Beacon-Enabled vs. Non-Beacon Communications There are two types of net-
work access used in IEEE 802.15.4: Beacon-enabled networks in which the frames contain
contention-based periods for network access and may contain contention-free periods called
guaranteed time slots (GTSs), which are used for data transfer to specific devices. Beacons
are a special type of frame transmitted by the coordinator only in star topology networks,
or transmitted by routers to other devices, on request from a child device.
RF WPANs

In contention-based communications, all devices that want to transmit in a particular fre-
quency use CSMA/CA to determine if the channel is busy. In beacon-enabled networks, the
PAN coordinator can transmit control information about which devices are allowed to
transmit and when, and it will also inform devices about timing periods in which all devices
can contend for access to the medium. Beacons can be transmitted at fixed intervals, during
which devices will normally wake-up and turn on their receivers so they can find out if any
messages are being held for them at the coordinator or a parent device.
In beacon-enabled networks, IEEE 802.15.4 can optionally use a superframe concept. The
superframe is a mechanism for managing transmission time in the network. It consists of a
continuously repeating set of time slots, bounded by beacon frames. The timing periods
between two beacons will always include some contention access periods but may also con-
tain GTSs for critical devices to transmit data between two beacons. If no devices need to
transmit anything, the time slots are not used. A superframe always begins and ends with a
beacon. A beacon signals the beginning of a superframe and contains information about the
type and number of time slots contained in the time periods between beacons. The beacon is
also the time synchronization frame for the network and is required for association when
the network is using superframes. The ZigBee coordinator allocates GTSs but always leaves
time slots available for use as contention access periods between two beacons. Figure 5-16
shows an example of an 802.15.4 superframe.

Beacon frames are not required for device-to-device communications. In nonbeacon-enabled
networks, the PAN coordinator will send beacons in response to beacon request frames from
other devices. Beacons contain addressing and timing information required for new devices to
associate with the network. The only exception to this is in ZigBee mesh networks, where bea-
cons are not permitted and every device communicates in peer-to-peer fashion.
Network Association In 802.15.4, all the procedures for associating with and joining
a network require only minimal configuration or interference by the user, the first time they
connect. Installing a ZigBee network is limited to configuring the initial PAN address and
then configuring which switch turns on a particular light or group of lights. Typically, the
only field troubleshooting task in ZigBee networks is determining whether the RF signal
from one device is within the range of another device so that they can communicate reliably
or if interference may be causing problems with the PAN.
ZigBee devices are designed to automatically associate with and join or rejoin a PAN that
has already been established by a coordinator, once they are powered on. The network
174
Chapter 5

topology is defined during initial installation, depending on the specific needs of the system
being installed. When a ZigBee device is powered on for the first time, it will listen for traf-
fic on the network and scan the medium in an attempt to identify which RF channel is being
used. Then it will send a request to join the network.
ZigBee devices can query the coordinator or other FFDs to identify the number of devices
that are connected to the network and their locations in a process called device discovery.
Once the devices are associated with the PAN, they have the option of performing a service
discovery to identify the capabilities of specific devices.
Coexistence with Other Standards Relatively wideband interference, such as that
generated by IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) networks in the 2.4 GHz band, appears like white noise
to an IEEE 802.15.4 receiver because only a fraction of the 802.11 transmission falls within
the 802.15.4 receiver bandwidth. This is because 802.15.4 transmissions only use 2 MHz of
bandwidth, whereas 802.11 transmission use between 20 and 25 MHz, as you will learn in
Chapter 6. Likewise, the impact of interference from Bluetooth (802.15.1) devices should
be minimal due to the fact that Bluetooth changes the transmission frequency every
625 microseconds.
802.15.4 devices should only interfere with approximately three out of the 79 hops of a
Bluetooth transmission, or approximately 4 percent. To an IEEE 802.11 receiver, the signal
from an 802.15.4 transmitter looks like narrowband interference. The low duty cycles of
802.15.4 transmissions—the result of infrequent transmissions—further reduce the impact of
interference.

control hubs for smarthomes and offices. Search the web for: GE
Link®, Cree Connected®, TCP Connected®, Philips Hue®, and

to get more information on hubs used to control lighting and other devices. Be sure to also

comparison.
Network Addressing The ZigBee specification defines four levels of addresses for
identifying devices within a PAN: IEEE address, network (PAN) address, node address, and
endpoint address. The IEEE address, also called an extended address, is a 64-bit static hard-
ware address that is embedded in every radio transmitter. The PAN address is a unique
16-bit identifier for each PAN in an area. It is assigned by the PAN coordinator and is only
used for a single network or cluster. The node address is a 16-bit address assigned by the
PAN coordinator or parent device; this address comes from a group of addresses distributed
by the coordinator and is unique for each radio on the network. The node address is used
for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of ZigBee transmissions, given that the IEEE
address is 64 bits long. The endpoint address uniquely identifies each endpoint device or ser-
vice controlled by a single radio—a light bulb, for example.
To understand multiple levels of addressing, see Figure 5-17, in which two switches control
three lights connected to a single ZigBee radio. Switch A, on the left, controls the bottom
light. Switch B, on the right, controls the two top lights. The ZigBee module controlling the
RF WPANs

switches can be physically located far from the lamp. In this case, for either switch to send a
command to the lamp, it needs the PAN address, the node address (to identify the radio
module in the lamp), and the endpoint address (to identify the individual light bulbs). The
process of creating a relationship between a light and a switch is called binding; this needs
to be performed only when the WPAN is being set up, but can be reconfigured at any time.

Note that not all addresses are used in every frame; which address is used depends on which
two devices are communicating in the piconet. Although the example in the figure is
extremely simple, imagine the same process applied to endpoint devices in a tall office build-
ing or a large factory. With ZigBee, if the office layout changes, it is possible to reconfigure
all the light switches. As a comparison, in a traditional installation, this would require a sig-
nificant amount of rewiring, which is often prohibitively expensive.
Power Management in ZigBee Networks Packet routing requires a lot of pro-
cessing overhead and additional packet traffic, which diminishes the power-saving effect of
ZigBee devices and also reduces the data throughput. In addition, ZigBee devices are
designed to be very small—such as a light switch—and for this reason they are more likely
to be equipped with low-speed, power-efficient CPUs. In a ZigBee PAN, only the devices
that perform routing or are coordinators incur processing overhead and, consequently, con-
sume more power. The 802.15.4 standard favors battery-powered devices but does not pre-
vent devices from being connected to another power source, such as an electrical outlet.
There is also no limitation on devices having additional data-processing power. Most FFDs,
which are routing-capable ZigBee devices, typically connect to external power sources like
an electrical outlet, although they can run on battery power as well. One example is an
FFD that includes a temperature sensor and is configured to transmit every 30 seconds,
such as those monitoring critical machinery.
The ZigBee specification includes a number of parameters that must be maintained by
devices in case of localized or network-wide power failures or resets. These include the
PAN ID, the network address, the address of every associated child device, and the channel
in use. In addition, if there are alternate paths, FFDs must also maintain a routing table that

lists all routing-capable neighbor devices, along with the length of the path or cost, to reach
every other device in the PAN.
Other Technologies Using IEEE 802.15.4
There are two other technologies that take advantage of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC and PHY:
6LoWPAN and WirelessHART.
6LoWPAN is a protocol that implements IPv6 on WPANs. It makes interfacing a WPAN to
the Internet much simpler because it uses an adaptation layer between the MAC and Net-
work layers of IPv6 to translate the IP information into a format that can be transmitted
using the MAC frame format of 802.15.4-compliant hardware.
6LoWPAN supports mesh networking and is designed to be used in nodes that have limited
memory space and processing capabilities and, like ZigBee, the Adaptation layer uses a com-
pression algorithm to reduce the size of the 40-octet IPv6 header. It also uses fragmentation
to allow the minimal-size IPv6 packets (1,280 octets) to be transmitted in a 802.15.4 pay-
load, which has a maximum size of 127 octets. This makes it possible to access and manage
a network node just like any other IP device.
WirelessHART is based on the Highway Addressable Remote Transducer (HART) protocol,
designed for industrial-automation applications such as process control, equipment and pro-
cess monitoring, and advanced diagnostics in wired networks. HART supports both a bus
topology, in which several instruments are attached to the same cable, and a point-to-point
connection that allows both digital and analog signals to be sent on the same cable. In
2007, the HART Communications Foundation (HCF) approved WirelessHART to protect
process manufacturing companies’ investment in the over 30 million HART devices installed
while permitting their use over a wireless link.
WPAN Security
Although you might think that security shouldn’t be a concern with WPANs, given that most
of the transmissions are restricted to a short physical range, and no sensitive personal data are
transferred, there is still the danger that hackers will try to break into devices or entire net-
works and access sensitive or critical controls, especially in industrial environments. Malicious
hackers could break into WPANs to open smart door locks and gain access to homes and
businesses. In this section, you will learn about the security models for each of the WPAN
technologies discussed in this chapter.
Designing security for WPANs can be more difficult than for other networking technologies.
A single solution is not likely to meet all the security requirements, for one thing. Users like
to roam free while remaining connected, but they do not want anyone to eavesdrop on their
telephone conversations, access their homes or offices, or interfere in any way with their sys-
tems. However, small battery-powered devices tend to have limited processing capabilities,
and this makes it difficult to implement security measures like complex encryption, which
tends to use a lot of processing cycles and consequently consumes a lot of battery power.
Banking and electronic funds transactions present even more difficulties for WPANs. To keep
the transactions secure, both the user’s identity and the transaction itself have to be verified.
This is often done using public key infrastructure and a certificate authority. Public key
WPAN Security
177

infrastructure (PKI) uses a unique security code, or key, provided by an independent certifi-
cate authority. A certificate authority is a private company that verifies the authenticity of
each user in order to discourage fraud. This kind of authentication will have to be in wide-
spread use before financial institutions will adopt WPAN technology.
The data transmission must also be protected to prevent tampering; otherwise, hackers can
intercept a packet, make changes to it, and then forward the changed packet, which by now
may contain data that enables the hacker to access other network traffic. This is called a
man-in-the-middle attack, and the process to prevent it uses both sequential packet freshness
information and a message integrity check (or message integrity code). Both of these security
mechanisms are discussed later in this chapter.
Security is an extensive and complex topic that is largely beyond the scope of this text. Never-
theless, you will find, on a chapter-by-chapter basis, a list of the security options that are
available for each technology as well as a brief discussion of the security issues faced by each
technology.
Security in Bluetooth WPANs
Bluetooth provides security through authentication or encryption. Authentication is based on
identifying the device itself, not who is using the device. To accomplish that, Bluetooth uses a
challenge-response strategy to determine whether the new device knows a secret key. If it
does, it is allowed to join the piconet. Bluetooth data transmissions are “whitened,” meaning
that the data is scrambled according to a pattern determined by the clock and address of the
master that is also used to synchronize all devices on the piconet. Although this is not a per-
fect security method, it does make Bluetooth data extremely difficult to capture (sniff) and
decode in its entirety.
Encryption services are also available for Bluetooth networks, but because Bluetooth devices
tend to be powered by very small batteries and have slower CPUs, encryption is seldom a
good idea, except in government or military applications, where it often cannot be avoided.
Encryption is the process of scrambling the data using mathematical algorithms so that the
transmission, if intercepted, still has to be decoded into the original data, which discourages
many hackers. The Bluetooth specification supports three encryption modes:
●
Encryption Mode 1—Nothing is encrypted
●
Encryption Mode 2—Traffic from the master to one slave is encrypted, but traffic
from the master to multiple slaves (broadcasts) is not encrypted
●
Encryption Mode 3—All traffic is encrypted
The pairing key and the encryption key in Bluetooth are two very different things. The rea-
son for separating them is to allow the use of a shorter encryption key without weakening
its strength with a pairing key that may be extremely simple and common to different devices
of the same type.
There are three levels of Bluetooth security:
●
Level 1: No security—A Bluetooth device does not initiate any security steps.
●
Level 2: Service-level security—Security is established at the higher levels of the
protocol stack after a connection is made.
178

●
Level 3: Link-level security—Security is established at the lower levels of the protocol
stack before a connection is made.
Note that due to the difficulties in sniffing Bluetooth data, very few manufacturers implement
security beyond the pairing key in Bluetooth. When transferring data other than voice or
video, another option that Bluetooth users have is to encrypt the data before it is transmitted.
However, you should consider that encryption usually increases the byte count significantly
and therefore reduces the speed and efficiency of the piconet, in addition to needing far
more processing and therefore consuming extra battery power.
A lot has and is being written about Bluetooth and RF WPAN security threats. Bluetooth
threats have even been named Bluesnarfing, Bluebugging, and Bluejacking, along with a few
others. However, keep in mind that once devices are paired and connected, unless they are
again put into discoverable mode by the users, other devices cannot “see” them. If Bluetooth
users are conscientious and do not approve pairings that they did not initiate themselves, it
remains very difficult for would-be attackers to sniff data from Bluetooth wireless transmis-
sions. In most cases the kind of data transmitted in a Bluetooth piconet or other RF
WPANs, with few exceptions, does not demand a much more sophisticated degree of security
than what is already available. While security attacks against Bluetooth piconets can poten-
tially be very annoying, they are seldom dangerous to people or property.
To learn more about Bluesnarfing, Bluejacking, and other Bluetooth
security threats, search the web for “Bluetooth security threats.”
Security in ZigBee and IEEE 802.15.4 WPANs
ZigBee WPANs use a process called symmetric key for both authentication and encryption. A
symmetric key is a sequence of numbers and letters, much like a password, that must be
entered by the authorized user on all devices. No automatic key distribution or key rotation
is included in the standard, although these options can be implemented at the higher protocol
layers. The length of the key can be 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, or 16 octets, with longer keys providing
more security than shorter ones.
In addition to symmetric key security, the IEEE 802.15.4 standard provides frame integrity,
access control, and security services. Frame integrity is a technique that uses a message integ-
rity code (MIC), a sequence of bits based on a subset of the data itself, the length field, and
the symmetric key. This code is used by the receiving device to verify that the data has not
been tampered with during transmission from the sender to the receiver. In access control, a
device maintains a list of other devices with which it is permitted to communicate. This list is
called an access control list (ACL). This technique allows ZigBee devices in a large building,
for example, to communicate only with devices belonging to their own network and not with
devices in other networks. Sequential freshness is a security service used by the receiving
device that ensures that the same frames will not be transmitted more than once. The net-
work maintains a sequential number that is continually incremented and tracked by the
devices to verify that the arriving data is newer than the last data transmitted. This prevents
a frame from being captured and replayed on the network by a hacker who does not have
access to the encryption key.
WPAN Security

There are three security modes in the 802.15.4 standard: unsecured mode, ACL mode (which
uses access control), and secured mode (which uses full authentication and encryption). In
secured mode, the MAC layer may optionally provide frame integrity and sequential
freshness.
Whenever ZigBee devices and networks are used to control critical equipment in manufactur-
ing, residential, or commercial buildings, security concerns must be addressed by a combina-
tion of the techniques discussed here, as well as encryption. In these cases, most critical
ZigBee devices are not likely to be powered by batteries, except for backup purposes, and
can make use of more powerful processors that are able to handle sophisticated encryption.
Manufacturers of these types of control systems are aware of these concerns and their equip-
ment is designed with security and safety in mind. End users should always be aware that
security is not, and will likely never be, “set-and-forget.” Instead, security is likely to always
be a work-in-progress.
Chapter Summary
■Bluetooth is a wireless technology that uses short-range radio frequency (RF) trans-
missions, enabling users to connect to a wide range of devices without using cables.
Bluetooth can also be used to create a small network.
■Bluetooth is supported by over 14,000 hardware and software vendors who make up
the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG). The IEEE used a portion of the Bluetooth
specifications as the base material for its 802.15.1 standard. The standard is fully
compatible with Bluetooth version 1.2 and higher.
■The Bluetooth protocol stack’s functions can be divided into two parts based on how
they are implemented: the lower levels and the upper levels. The lower-level functions
are implemented in hardware, whereas the upper-level functions are implemented in
software. At the lowest level of the Bluetooth protocol stack is the RF layer. It defines
how the basic hardware that controls the radio transmissions functions. At the heart of
Bluetooth is a single radio transmitter/receiver (transceiver) that performs all the nec-
essary functions. Bluetooth can transmit at a speed of 1 Mbps and has three different
power classes for transmitting.
■Up to version 1.2, Bluetooth uses two-level Gaussian frequency shift keying (2-GFSK)
modulation and operates in the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM)
band. Bluetooth uses the frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) technique to send
a transmission. Version 2 of Bluetooth added two modulation methods that help it
achieve speeds of 2 Mbps and 3 Mbps. Version 3 added power-saving modes of oper-
ation, an alternative MAC, and PHY layers that use a second radio and Wi-Fi, all of
which help it achieve transmission rates as high as 24 Mbps.
■When two Bluetooth devices come within range of each other, they automatically con-
nect with one another. One device is the master and the other device is a slave. A
Bluetooth network that contains one master and at least one slave using the same
channel forms a piconet. A Bluetooth device can be a member of two or more piconets
in the same area. A group of piconets in which connections exist between different
piconets is called a scatternet.

■There are three kinds of error-correction schemes used in the Bluetooth protocol:
1/3 rate Forward Error Correction (FEC), 2/3 rate FEC, and the automatic retransmis-
sion request (ARQ).
■Devices in a piconet can be in active, hold, sniff, or park modes; device activity is
lowered during the power-saving modes.
■ZigBee, created by the Zigbee Alliance, is a specification for low-rate WPANs. It offers
a global standard for monitoring and controlling small, low-power, cost-effective,
wirelessly networked products.
■ZigBee technology is geared toward devices such as lighting controls, wireless smoke
and carbon monoxide detectors, thermostats and other environmental controls, medi-
cal sensors, remote controls, and industrial and building automation.
■The ZigBee specification includes full mesh networking to allow networks to encom-
pass large buildings. Full-function devices can route frames across the network to
remote devices. Reduced function devices are an endpoint device, such as a light switch
or lamp.
■There are three ZigBee network topologies: star, tree, and mesh.
■The IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines three frequency bands: 868 MHz, 915 MHz, and
the 2.4 GHz ISM band. The protocol stack has two PHY layers. One supports
868/915 MHz, and the other supports 2.4 GHz. There are 27 channels across the
three bands. Modulation is BPSK for 868/915 MHz. For 2.4 GHz, it uses O-QPSK
modulation with a fixed set of 16 chipping codes, each representing a 4-bit data pat-
tern (also called a symbol).
■802.15.4 is designed to coexist easily with other WPAN and WLAN technologies
transmitting in the same frequency range. Access to the medium is contention based,
but support for guaranteed time slots is also provided through the use of superframes.
■Security in Bluetooth supports only device authentication and limited encryption.
Secure key distribution is not provided in the standard. ZigBee supports message
integrity at the MAC layer and can also check for the freshness of the message to
ensure that the same frame will not be transmitted more than once in a piconet.

Project 5-1
Different Bluetooth interfaces may have different software and procedures. For
this project, you will need two computers equipped with Bluetooth interface
adapters. The project instructions and illustrations below are based on a Dell
laptop with Windows 7 that uses a built-in Dell 365 Bluetooth module. If
you are not using a Dell laptop or are using an external Bluetooth adapter, you may need
to adjust the specific steps to fit your hardware.
1.
First, you need to make at least one of the computers discoverable. In Windows 7, if
you don’t see the Bluetooth icon in the system tray, click the up arrow at the bottom
right-hand corner of the screen to show the hidden icons. Now, click the Bluetooth
icon, then click Open Settings. You will see the arrows shown in Figure 5-18.
Figure 5-18
Opening Bluetooth settings from the Windows 7 system tray
2.
In the Bluetooth Settings dialog box, click the Options tab and ensure that all the
options in this dialog box are checked by clicking the boxes next to them. Your config-
uration dialog should look like what is shown in Figure 5-19. Click OK to set the con-
figuration and close the page.

Next, you need to pair the two computers. Once you have made the first one discov-
erable, click the up arrow in the system tray of the second computer and then click
Add a device. Windows will now search for devices and display the ones that it dis-
covers (see Figure 5-20).

4.
Once an icon for the other computer appears in the Window, click it once to select it,
then click Next. Remember that the two Bluetooth devices must be placed within a
maximum of 33 feet (10 meters) of each other. Windows will now display a dialog
page containing an automatically generated number. On the other computer, an infor-
mation bubble will appear at the bottom right-hand side of the screen. Click the bubble
to open a dialog box (see Figure 5-21) that asks you to verify that the pairing code is
the same. Click Next to accept it. After Windows installs the necessary drivers, it will
display a message indicating that the pairing was successful. If not, you may need to
turn the Bluetooth device off and on again before attempting to pair.
Figure 5-21
Bluetooth pairing
5.
Open the Windows system tray on the second computer and click the Bluetooth icon. In
the context menu, click Show Bluetooth Devices. You should see the other computer
identified by name. Double-click it to open the dialog box shown in Figure 5-22.

Click Send files to your computer <Name of the other Computer> Windows will open a
dialog page that allows you to select the files to send. Click the Browse Files button on
this page and select a sample picture from the Windows Pictures folder. Click Open and
then click Next.
7.
Windows will open a dialog page that asks you to Select the destination folder and shows
the other computer’s name. Click Send. On the other computer, Windows will display a
bubble confirming that the connection was successful and another bubble requesting
authorization for the sending computer to copy a file over Bluetooth. Click the bubble to
open the Bluetooth Image Push Service Access Authorization dialog page, and then ensure
that Allow access for the current request only is checked. Then click OK.
8.
Windows will now transfer the image using the image push profile mentioned in Step 7.
Once the file has been transferred, the receiving computer will display another bubble
for File Transfer notification. Click the bubble to open the containing folder and verify
that the file was transferred correctly.
9.
Experiment with Bluetooth by transferring other images and other types of files.
Blue-tooth networking is somewhat complex and also sometimes clumsy. Devices must
be able to support the right Bluetooth profiles; otherwise, you may not be able to trans-
fer some types of files.
10. To verify which profiles are supported by your Bluetooth hardware and drivers, go to
the Show Bluetooth devices page again, right-click the icon for the other computer or
device with which you are trying to communicate, and click Properties. Click Services
and check the list of Bluetooth services offered by the other device. If some of the

options are not checked and you had problems transferring a file, click all the services
offered, click OK, and then attempt your file transfer again.
If you have an older laptop equipped with an infrared port (IrDA),
you may wish to attempt a file transfer using this technology and
compare the steps required with performing the same action on
Bluetooth. In spite of its distance limitations and the requirement to
have the computers’ IrDA ports pointed at each other, the technol-
ogy is much simpler to use and allows all types of data transfer between computers, usually
at 4 Mbps.
Real-World Exercises
The Baypoint Group (TBG) has once again requested your services as a consultant. One of its
clients, DeLuxe Builders, is interested in making sure that all their future construction projects
include wireless control systems for lighting, heating and cooling, and energy management
that are based on standards. DeLuxe Builders is aware that ZigBee is a global standard and
would like TBG to advise them on how to proceed.
TBG will be in charge of evaluating the right type of technology and making recommenda-
tions to DeLuxe.
Exercise 5-1
Create a PowerPoint slide presentation that outlines how ZigBee technology works. Be sure
to include information about the standards used, the advantages and disadvantages, and
why ZigBee would be the best solution for DeLuxe.
Exercise 5-2
Your presentation convinced DeLuxe’s management that using ZigBee would be a good
solution. However, DeLuxe’s management is concerned about the reliability of the system
because it transmits using 2.4 GHz and this frequency band is also used by Wi-Fi and cord-
less phones. TBG has asked you to be involved in a demonstration to the client of both these
technologies. Prepare a three-page paper discussing how ZigBee can coexist with other sys-
tems using the same frequency band and how ZigBee devices can also make use of other fre-
quency bands.
Challenge Case Project
Microsoft has included full Bluetooth support in from Windows 7 on. Manufac-
turers of Bluetooth devices usually list the capabilities of their hardware but sel-
dom tell you exactly which profiles are supported. If you have many Bluetooth
devices or need specific information about your devices and you cannot locate
this information on the Internet, sometimes it is useful to be able to obtain this
type of information directly from your devices.

The
following
link
at
Softpedia
(www.softpedia.com/dyn-search.php?search_term¼
bluetooth) has several utilities that can help you identify Bluetooth devices. Search the avail-
able utilities on the Softpedia site, and download and install one of the utilities (you may
have to try more than one) on a computer equipped with a Bluetooth adapter. Most Blue-
tooth adapters should be supported, but some are limited to only certain manufacturer’s
adapters.
Now turn Bluetooth on in as many devices as you have available and use the utility to identify
as many as you can. Remember that you may need to place the devices in discoverable mode.
The utility should be able to identify cellular phones, headsets, etc. Some devices, such as the
Apple iPhone, do not report their capabilities.
If you have a device that is already paired with another, such as a headset to a smartphone,
do any of the utilities find the paired device? How might some of these utilities be useful to
you in the field for identifying devices and capabilities or to troubleshoot? Write a short report
answering these questions and outlining your approach for completing this project.

WLANs are probably the technology that has attracted the most attention since the
introduction of personal computers to the consumer market. The explosive growth of wireless
networks all over the world was initially driven by home and small-office sales, but after the
ratification of the latest wireless networking standards—IEEE 802.11n in 2009 and 802.11ac in
2014—more companies are deploying wireless networks to allow staff and customers to connect
their own devices and benefit from more flexible, mobile access. Globally, public Wi-Fi hotspot
access continues to grow steadily, and the Wireless Broadband Alliance (www.wballiance.com)
predicts that mobile phone carriers will continue to deploy Wi-Fi calling to offload some of
the traffic from their networks. Total mobile data traffic is forecast to reach 30.6 exabytes
(30.6  1018) per month by 2020. This figure includes both smartphones and WLANs.
As a comparison, 5 exabytes (5  1018) is estimated to be equal to
all words ever spoken by human beings, so far. You can search the
web for “global mobile data traffic” for additional statistics.
WLAN technology supports a very broad range of applications. Practically all laptop com-
puters, tablets, and smartphones are equipped with Wi-Fi today. Popular coffee shops and
restaurants, hotels, planes, trains and even some automobiles now offer Wi-Fi Internet
access today.
This chapter begins by reviewing the basic concepts of how Wi-Fi WLANs work, focusing
on low-speed WLANs (up to 11 Mbps). This background knowledge will help you better
understand the higher-speed technologies, new standards, and compatibility issues covered
in Chapter 7. Today, the widespread use of these wireless technologies means that working
in this field requires a more in-depth understanding of how Wi-Fi works and how you can
install and troubleshoot WLANs.
WLAN Components
The hardware needed to enable devices to connect to WLANs is surprisingly minimal. In addi-
tion to a mobile device and an Internet service provider, only wireless network interface cards
(WNICs) and access points (APs) are needed for communications to take place.
Wireless Network Interface Card
The hardware that allows a computer to be connected to a wired network is called a network
interface card (NIC) or a network adapter. A NIC is the device that connects the computer to
the network so that it can send and receive data to other devices, either locally or via the
Internet. A wired NIC has a port for a cable connection. The cable connects the NIC to the
network, thus establishing the link between the computer and the network.
A wireless NIC (WNIC) performs the same functions as a wired NIC, with one major excep-
tion: There is no port for a wire connection to the network. In its place, there is an antenna
to send and receive RF signals. Specifically, when WNICs transmit, they:
●
Modulate the data onto RF carrier waves
●
Determine when to send the packet
●
Transmit the packet

Wireless NICs are available in many different formats. For desktop computers, WNICs are
available as a card to be installed in an internal expansion slot or as an external wireless
adapter that can be connected to a computer’s USB port.
For laptop computers, WNICs are available as USB devices or Mini PCI cards. A Mini PCI is
a small card that is functionally equivalent to a standard PCI expansion card for a desktop
computer, but significantly smaller. The antenna is usually embedded in the part of the lap-
top that surrounds the screen. Today, the WNIC in laptops, smartphones, and other mobile
devices consists of a set of chips mounted directly on the motherboard. These chips are the
result of the development of components that consume a very small amount of power to
allow handheld devices to operate longer on power supplied by relatively small batteries.
Access Points
As you learned in Chapter 1, an AP provides wireless LAN devices with a point of access into a
wired network. APs consist of three major parts: (1) a radio transmitter/receiver to generate the sig-
nals that are used to send and receive wireless data, (2) an antenna to radiate these signals, and (3)
an RJ-45 wired network interface port that is used to connect the AP to the wired network.
It is possible to use a PC as a wireless residential gateway or AP by
using a WNIC, a standard NIC (which connects to the wired net-
work), and special software that allows the PC to function as an AP.
You can find free versions of this kind of software at: www.microtik
.com as well as other websites.
The AP also acts as the wireless communications base station for the wireless network. With
few exceptions, all the wireless devices that connect to the AP use the AP to transmit to other
wireless devices that are connected to the same AP. The AP also acts as a bridge between the
wireless and wired networks, as shown in Figure 6-1.

The range of an AP acting as the base station is a maximum of 375 feet (115 meters) in an
unobstructed office environment, in which there is little interference. However, the data rate will
drop as the signal strength, quality, or both begin to degrade due to distance or interference. The
exact point at which the data rate begins to drop depends on the specific environment, the type and
number of obstructions, and any sources of interference. The AP will automaticallyselectthehighest
possible data rate for transmission, depending on the strength and quality of the transmissions it
receives from mobile devices with which it is connected. This process is called dynamic rate
selection (DRS). Because the connection speed is so dependent on the environment, testing the
signal before implementation of a WLAN is an extremely important part of the installation process.
This preinstallation test is called a wireless site survey.
The largest number of devices that a single AP can be connected to varies, but is usually over
100. However, because the wireless medium is shared among all the connected devices, most
vendors recommend one AP per maximum of 50 users if the network is lightly used—that is,
for email, occasional web surfing, and occasional transferring of medium-sized files. On the
other hand, if users are mainly working with large or time-sensitive data—such as digital
pictures, video, or voice—the maximum number of users should be kept to between 20 and
25 per AP.
When the antennas are directly attached to the AP, the AP itself is usually mounted near the
ceiling or in a similar area high off the ground to ensure the clearest possible path for the RF
signal. However, electrical power outlets are generally not found in these locations and, due to
building code restrictions, and installing these outlets near the ceiling can be very expensive.
The IEEE has published two enhancements to the 802.3 Ethernet standard for wired networks
—namely, 802.3af and 802.3at—that define how manufacturers may implement the distribu-
tion of power over Ethernet (PoE). Instead of receiving power directly from an AC outlet, DC
power is delivered to the AP through the same twisted pair Ethernet cables that connect the AP
to the wired network. This makes the installation of APs much easier and more flexible.
WLAN Operating Modes
In an RF WLAN, data can be exchanged between devices in one of the two connection
modes: ad hoc and infrastructure mode.
Ad Hoc Mode
Ad hoc mode is also known as peer-to-peer mode, although its formal name in the IEEE
802.11 standard is Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS). In ad hoc mode, wireless devices
communicate directly among themselves without using an AP, as shown in Figure 6-2. This
mode is useful for a quick and easy setup of a wireless network anywhere that a network
infrastructure, wired or wireless, does not already exist or is not permanently required.
Examples of locations that use ad hoc mode WLANs include hotel meeting rooms or conven-
tion centers. The drawback is that the wireless devices can only communicate among them-
selves; there is usually no access to a wired network. Recent versions of PC, Mac, and Linux
operating systems may support a feature called Wi-Fi Direct. This feature enables sharing of
an Internet connection if one PC is connected to the wired network or to a cellular network
through an embedded software-based AP into the operating system.

Most smartphones also allow you to set up the phone as a wireless hotspot, which permits
other devices to connect to it, so they can share a cellular connection to the Internet when
not in range of a Wi-Fi network. Keep in mind that an IBSS can only effectively connect a
maximum of 10 devices, depending on the processing capacity of the device that is sharing
the Internet connection.
Infrastructure Mode
The second wireless network mode is infrastructure mode, also known as a Basic Service Set
(BSS). Infrastructure mode consists of at least one wireless device connected to a single AP. If
the coverage area needs to be increased beyond the range of a single AP, or if you need to
support more users, additional APs can be added to the network. When an infrastructure
WLAN has more than one AP using the same Service Set Identifier (SSID), it is called an
Extended Service Set (ESS). An ESS is simply two or more BSS wireless networks installed
within the same area, providing users with uninterrupted mobile access to the network, as
shown in Figure 6-3. The SSID is an alphanumeric character string that uniquely identifies
each WLAN and is essentially the human-readable name of the network. In an ESS, each AP
is tuned to a different frequency channel, but all APs are connected to the same wired LAN,
creating a virtually seamless wireless connection. In an IEEE 802.11 WLAN, the MAC
address of each AP is called the basic service set identifier or BSSID, and in the case of an
ESS, where the alphanumeric SSID is the same for several different APs, Wi-Fi devices use
the BSSID to identify which AP they are connected to.

When multiple APs are used, they create areas of coverage, much like the individual cells in a
beehive. However, unlike in a beehive, these cells overlap to facilitate roaming. When a
mobile user carrying a wireless device enters into the range of more than one AP, his wireless
device chooses an AP with which to associate based on signal strength and quality. Once the
AP accepts the connection from that device, the device changes to the radio frequency used
by that particular AP.
Whenever a wireless device is not communicating on the WLAN, it monitors all the radio
frequency channels on the network to determine if a different AP can provide a better-
quality or stronger signal. If the device finds one (perhaps because the user has moved to
another area of the building), it then associates with the new AP, changing to the radio fre-
quency of the new AP. In an ESS, this transition is called a handoff. To the user, a handoff
in an ESS is seamless, because the connection between the wireless device and the wired net-
work is never interrupted. The device remains connected to the same WLAN.
A challenge of ESS WLANs is that all wireless devices and APs must be part of the same net-
work segment for users to be able to roam freely between one AP and the other. Sometimes,
it is difficult to manage one large network. Because of this, network managers usually subdi-
vide large networks into units known as subnets that contain fewer computers. An ESS is
almost always set up using a dedicated VLAN that spans all of the network switches in a
building or campus. This way all APs can be part of the same network segment (IP addresses
belonging to the same subnet) allowing users to roam freely around the building or campus
while maintaining connectivity at all times.

First WLAN Standards
In this section, you will learn about the first IEEE standards for wireless LANs. All Wi-Fi
WLANs are based on the original IEEE 802.11 standards, and even the latest standards still
follow the same basic principles, albeit with a number of enhancements. These standards
implement specific transmission technologies based on differences in the PHY and MAC
layers.
IEEE 802.11
The original IEEE 802.11 standard, ratified in 1997, defines a local area network that pro-
vides cable-free data access for devices that are either mobile or in a fixed location, at a rate
of either 1 or 2 Mbps using either diffused infrared light or RF. In addition, when using RF
technology, this standard defines the implementation of WLANs using FHSS or DSSS (dis-
cussed in Chapter 2).
The standard specifies that the features of a WLAN be transparent to the upper layers of the
TCP/IP protocol stack or the OSI protocol model. That is, all differences between Ethernet
LANs and WLANs are implemented in the PHY and MAC layers, so that no modifications
are needed to any other OSI protocol layers, as shown in Figure 6-4. Because of this, any net-
work operating system or LAN application will run on a WLAN without modifications.
Because no IEEE 802.11 equipment has ever been introduced in the consumer market using
either IR or FHSS, this book does not cover these technologies. Instead, this chapter focuses
on the basics of 802.11 as it is available in the market today.
The slow maximum bandwidth of only 2 Mbps for the original 802.11 standard is not suffi-
cient for most network applications. As a result, the IEEE revisited the 802.11 standard
shortly after it was released to determine what changes could be made to increase the speed.
In 1999, the 802.11b standard was published, increasing the speeds to a maximum of
11 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. Even the IEEE 802.11n amendment to the standard is
still backward compatible with the original maximum data rates from 1997 of 1 or 2 Mbps

in the 2.4 GHz band, as well as with 802.11b. This backward compatibility makes it possible
for older models of devices to connect to WLANs, which protects the user’s investment in
equipment.
IEEE 802.11a, 802.11ac, and 802.11ad are not mentioned in this
chapter because they are not compatible with 2.4 GHz. They will be
discussed in later chapters.
IEEE 802.11b
The IEEE 802.11b amendment, ratified in 1999, was originally called Higher Speed Physical
Layer Extension in the 2.4 GHz band by the IEEE. Today, it is generally referred to as High-
Rate (HR). It added two higher speeds to the 1997 standard, 5.5 and 11 Mbps, and specified
RF and direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) as the only way to encode and modulate bit
streams for transmission. 802.11b also became known as Wi-Fi shortly after the establish-
ment of the Wi-Fi Alliance.
Physical Layer Remember that the purpose of the PHY layer is to transmit and receive
signals. The IEEE 802.11b PHY layer is also divided into two sublayers, as shown in
Figure 6-4: the physical medium dependent (PMD) sublayer and the physical layer conver-
gence procedure (PLCP) sublayer. The 802.11b standard made changes only to the PHY
layer of the original 802.11 standard.
Physical Layer Convergence Procedure PLCP standards for 802.11b are based on
direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS). The PLCP must reformat the data received from
the MAC layer (when transmitting) into a frame that the PMD sublayer can transmit. An
example of an 802.11 PLCP frame is shown in Figure 6-5.

The PLCP frame is made up of three parts: the preamble, the header, and the data. The pre-
amble allows the receiving device to prepare for the rest of the frame. The header provides
information about the frame itself, and the data is the information to be transmitted. The
fields of the PLCP frame are:
●
Synchronization—Consists of alternating 0s and 1s to alert the receiver that a
transmission is about to begin; the receiving device then synchronizes with the
incoming signal.
●
Start frame delimiter—Always the same bit pattern (1111001110100000); it defines
the beginning of a frame.
●
Signal data rate—Indicates how fast the data is being sent.
●
Service—Most of the bits in this field are reserved for future use and must be set to 0.
Bits 2, 3, and 7 are used in combination with the Length field for data rates higher
than 5 Mbps.
●
Length—Indicates how long, in microseconds, the data portion of the frame (the MAC
frame) is. The value of the Data field ranges from 16 to 65,535 and it is measured in
time slots, not bits or bytes. Approximately two pages of the 802.11b standard are
devoted to calculating the length of the data. These details are beyond the scope of this
book.
●
Header error check—Contains a value that the receiving device can use to determine if
the data was received correctly.
●
Data—Can be up to 4,095 bytes (the maximum length of an IEEE 802.11 MAC
frame).
The 802.11b PLCP frame preamble and header are always transmitted at 1 Mbps to allow
slower devices to be able to “understand” the transmission, which is the key to avoiding
frame collisions. The slow PLCP preamble and header transmission speed also means that
a slower transmission, that uses a simpler modulation scheme, can be more easily “under-
stood” by devices farther away. The disadvantage of using the lowest common denomina-
tor speed is that faster devices must still fall back to the 1 Mbps transmission rate for the
preamble and header, and this affects the overall performance of the WLAN. However, the
data portion of the frames can be transmitted at the faster rates, if supported by the
devices.
Physical Medium Dependent Standards Once the PLCP has formatted the frame, it
then passes the frame to the PMD sublayer of the PHY layer. Again, the job of the PMD is to
translate the binary 1s and 0s of the frame into RF signals that can be transmitted via EM
waves.
The 802.11b standard uses the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band (an unregulated
band that you learned about in Chapter 3) for its transmissions. For use in 802.11 and
802.11b, the standard specifies 14 available frequencies, beginning at 2.412 GHz and

incrementing by 0.005 GHz (or 5 MHz) of bandwidth per channel, except for channel 14.
The frequencies for each channel are listed in Table 6-1.
The United States and Canada use channels 1–11; Europe permits
channels 1−13, with the maximum power limited at 10 mW
between 2,454 and 2,483 MHz; and Japan permits the use of all
14 channels but limits the use of channel 14 to 802.11b only.
Bear in mind that these frequencies and their associated limitations may change over time, as
a result of the work of the ITU-T with the governments of various countries.
By employing dynamic rate selection, the PMD on an AP adjusts the transmission rate auto-
matically from 1 to 2, 5.5, or 11 Mbps and down again depending on the latest signal
strength and quality received from a device. For transmissions at 1 Mbps, two-level differen-
tial binary phase-shift keying (DBPSK) is specified as the modulation technique and encodes
1 bit per signal change (or symbol). For transmissions at 2 Mbps, differential quadrature
phase-shift keying or DQPSK is specified and encodes 2 bits per symbol.
You may remember that DSSS uses an expanded redundant code, called the Barker code, to
transmit each data bit. The Barker code is used when 802.11b is transmitting at 1 or 2 Mbps.
However, to transmit at rates above 2 Mbps, Complementary Code Keying (CCK), a table
containing 64 8-bit code words, is used instead. As a set, these code words have unique, math-
ematically calculated properties that allow them to be correctly distinguished from one another
by a receiver. The 5.5 Mbps rate uses four of these code words to encode 4 bits per signal unit,
whereas the 11 Mbps rate uses all 64 code words to encode 8 bits per symbol.

Keep in mind that because all 802.11 transmissions use a single fre-
quency channel, they are half-duplex, which means that the maxi-
mum throughput achievable in an 802.11b network is only between
5 and 6 Mbps.
Media Access Control Layer The 802.11b Data Link layer consists of two sublayers:
Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC). The 802.11b standard spe-
cifies no changes to the LLC sublayer (the LLC remains the same as for IEEE 802.3 wired
networks); therefore, all the changes required for 802.11b WLANs to work are confined to
the MAC sublayer.
Coordinating Communications in the Shared Wireless
Medium
Because all devices in the same 802.11 WLAN must share the medium by transmitting on the
same frequency channel, if two computers start sending messages at the same time, a collision
results, the data becomes corrupted and cannot be correctly decoded by receivers. Figure 6-6
shows an example of a collision in a wired network. To prevent this, wireless network devices
must use a variety of methods to access the frequency channel. One way to prevent network colli-
sions, for example, is for each device to listen to the medium first, to make sure no other device is
transmitting. In addition, after a device transmits a frame, it must wait to receive an acknowledg-
ment from the receiving device. If it does not receive an acknowledgment (ACK), it assumes there
has been a collision. This process is called distributed coordination function (DCF).

CSMA/CA
In Chapter 5, you learned about a channel access method called carrier sense, multiple access
with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). In this chapter, we will explore CSMA/CA further to
better understand how 802.11 networks work. This method of detecting collisions is based
on the one used in IEEE 802.3 Ethernet. When Ethernet devices are connected using a shared
medium, such as a coaxial cable, or when they operate in half-duplex mode using hubs and
only two wires to communicate, they use a method to access the medium called carrier
sense, multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD). CSMA/CD specifies that before a
computer starts to send a message, it should listen on the cable to see if any other computer
is transmitting. If it hears traffic, it should wait until that traffic is finished. If it hears no traf-
fic, then the computer can send a packet. However, what if two computers simultaneously
listen for traffic and hear nothing on the cable and both start to send at exactly the same
time? A collision would result. CSMA/CD also specifies that each computer must continue
to listen while sending its message. If it detects a collision, each computer stops sending data
and broadcasts a jam signal over the network, which tells all other computers not to send
any messages for a random period of time (the backoff interval) before attempting to resend.
CSMA/CD in Ethernet uses voltage sensors on the NIC. Whenever they detect a voltage
higher than 5 volts, it means that more than one device is transmitting at the same time. This
method of detecting a collision cannot be used in a wireless system. Collision detection is vir-
tually impossible with wireless transmissions when the signals are transmitted and received in
the same frequency. While a device is transmitting on a particular frequency, it cannot detect a
collision. In addition, the amount of attenuation of an EM signal sent by another device is
dependent on the environment in which it is being transmitted, as well as on reflected signals
and other types of interference, and is therefore not predictable. Consequently, measuring the
strength or voltage of an RF signal is not practical for detecting collisions in wireless systems.
The maximum length of an Ethernet cable in wired networks is lim-
ited to about 300 feet (100 meters). Due to tight Ethernet cable spe-
cifications, this makes the signal attenuation in Ethernet networks
predictable.
The entire family of 802.11 standards uses DCF or variations of it to avoid collisions.
Whereas CSMA/CD is designed to handle collisions when they occur, CSMA/CA attempts
to avoid collisions altogether.
When using a contention-based channel access method, the time at which the most collisions
occur is immediately after a device completes its transmission. This is because all other
devices wanting to transmit have been waiting for the medium to clear so they can send
their messages. Once the medium is clear, they may all try to transmit at the same time,
which results in collisions.
CSMA/CA in DCF handles the situation by making all devices wait a random amount of
time (the backoff interval) after the medium is clear, which significantly reduces the occur-
rence of collisions. The amount of time that a device must wait after the medium is clear is
measured in time slots. All devices must wait a random number of time slots as their backoff
interval. Each time slot in a DSSS 802.11b WLAN is 20 microseconds. If a wireless device’s
backoff interval is three time slots, then it must wait 60 microseconds (20 microseconds times
three time slots) before attempting to transmit, in an attempt to prevent collisions.

As a comparison, each time slot for an 802.3 Ethernet 10 Mbps
transmission is 51.2 microseconds; for 100 Mbps Ethernet, it is
5.12 microseconds.
CSMA/CA also reduces collisions by using an explicit acknowledgment (ACK). An ACK
frame is sent by the receiving device back to the sending device after each frame transmission
to confirm that the frame arrived intact. If the sending device does not receive the ACK
frame, either the original data packet sent was not received correctly or the ACK was not
received correctly. In either case, the sending device assumes that a problem has occurred
and retransmits the frame. Other devices are not allowed to transmit until after this process
is completed. This explicit ACK mechanism can also handle interference and other radio-
related problems, such as one device being able to hear the transmission from an AP but not
being able to hear another device that may be too far away from it. Devices may be too far
away from each other, but when connected, they should all be able to “hear” transmissions
from the AP. Figure 6-7 shows a graphic example of the acknowledgment process.
CSMA/CA reduces potential collisions, but it does not eliminate them altogether. The
802.11b standard provides two additional methods for reducing potential collisions. The
first is known as the request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) protocol (also called virtual
carrier sensing). A graphic example of the RTS/CTS protocol is shown in Figure 6-8. The
device wishing to transmit sends an RTS frame to the AP. This frame contains a “Duration”
field that defines the length of time needed for both the transmission and the returning ACK

frame. The AP then alerts all other wireless devices that device B needs to reserve the medium
for a specific number of time slots by responding back to device B with a CTS frame. The
CTS also tells all devices that the medium is now being reserved and that they should there-
fore suspend any transmissions. Once the device that sent the RTS to the AP receives the CTS
frame, it can proceed with transmitting its message.
The RTS/CTS protocol imposes additional overhead, which reduces network performance,
and is not used unless there are excessive collisions. The second method of reducing collisions
is fragmentation. Fragmentation involves dividing the data to be transmitted from one large
frame into several smaller ones. Sending many smaller frames instead of one large frame
reduces the amount of time that the wireless medium is being used to transmit each frame,
and because of this, it can also reduce the probability of collisions.
In fragmentation, if the length of a data frame to be transmitted exceeds a configurable value,
the MAC layer will divide, or fragment, that frame into several smaller frames. Each frag-
mented frame is given a fragment number (the first fragmented frame is 0, the next frame is
1, and so on). After a frame is received and verified to be free of errors, the receiving device
sends back an ACK and then is ready to receive the next fragment. After all the fragments
are received at their destination, they are reassembled, based on their fragment numbers,
back into the original frame by the MAC layer.

Fragmentation is an alternative to RTS/CTS; however, it does create additional overhead in
two ways. First, more frames imply additional MAC and PLCP headers. Second, the receiving
device must send a separate ACK for each smaller fragment received. Fragmentation does not
always have to be used separately from RTS/CTS; in a busy WLAN, they may have to be
combined to reduce collisions. The standard allows both methods to be used simultaneously.
Point Coordination Function
Another type of channel access method is polling. With this method, each device is sequen-
tially “asked” by the AP if it has anything to transmit. After associating with the AP, devices
cannot transmit unless they are polled. If the device has something to transmit, it will send a
positive response to the AP. The AP then grants the device permission to transmit. If the
device does not have anything to transmit, it will send a null data frame to the AP, and then
the next device in sequence will be polled. It is a very orderly way of allowing each device to
transmit a frame. Each device is given a turn, as shown in Figure 6-9. Polling effectively elim-
inates collisions because every device must wait until it receives permission from the AP
before it can transmit.

This optional polling method is known as point coordination function (PCF). With PCF, the AP
serves as the polling device. When using PCF, the AP (the point coordinator) first listens for
wireless traffic. This is because in order to allow other devices to associate with the AP and join the
WLAN, PCF must still allow some time slots for contention access, in which case the WLAN uses
DCF. If the AP hears no traffic on the wireless medium, it sends out a beacon frame to all devices.
One field of this frame contains a value that indicates the number of time slots that will be used for
PCF (polling), as well as the number of time slots that will be used for DCF (contention). Devices
that are not yet associated with the AP but that receive the beacon will take advantage of the DCF
period to contact the AP and join the WLAN.
Delays in transmission can result in a video that freezes on the screen or a voice conversation
that has gaps of dead space. Data transmissions, on the other hand, are not time sensitive.
DCF cannot distinguish between voice, video, and data frames. Although PCF was never
actually implemented in any 802.11 APs or wireless residential gateways, a hybrid of this
method and DCF is part of later amendments to the standard, so it is still important to
understand the basics of how PCF works.
Association and Reassociation
Before a device can communicate in a WLAN, it must first join the network. The MAC layer
of the 802.11 standard provides the functionality for a device to join a WLAN. The process
for joining is known as association. In the case of an ESS, devices also have to connect to dif-
ferent APs when the user is roaming. This means that devices must connect to another AP in
an ESS and must disconnect from the AP to which they were previously connected. The latter
process is called reassociation. Remember that there are two different modes in RF WLANs:
ad hoc and infrastructure. Regardless of which mode is being used, a device must first associ-
ate with the WLAN.
Association begins with a device scanning the wireless medium to discover an AP or
ad hoc devices within RF range. The device that wants to join the WLAN must first
listen or scan the medium for the information that it needs to begin the association
process.
There are two types of scanning: passive and active. Passive scanning involves a device
“listening” to each of the channels for a set period of time (usually 10 seconds). The
device listens for beacon frames transmitted by APs or by other devices in an ad hoc net-
work within a range. The information contained within the beacon frame includes how
often beacon frames are sent, the supported transmission rates of the network, and the
AP’s SSID and BSSID. The transmission of the SSID can be disabled on the AP to attempt
to hide the network from scanning devices. This hiding of the SSID is discussed in Chapter
8, under “WLAN Security.”
SSIDs are case sensitive. For example, if you set the SSID on an AP as
“AP1” and set the SSID on the device as “ap1,” the device will not
be able to associate with the AP using this configuration. The same
is true for ad hoc networks. All devices must use the same SSID.

The second type of scan, active scanning, involves the device first sending out a special frame,
called a probe frame, on each available channel. It then waits for an answer called the
probe response frame, from the AP to which it sent the frame. Like the beacon frame, the
probe response frame contains information the device needs to begin a dialog with the AP.
According to the IEEE 802.11 standard, the probe response frame must always be sent
back and must also include the SSID, regardless of whether the AP is configured to trans-
mit it by default in the beacon or not. Devices do not normally perform active scans of the
wireless medium, but every device is capable of sending probe frames. Some WLAN apps,
such as those used for war driving, include this feature. War driving is the practice of dis-
covering and recording information about WLANs in a neighborhood or around a city
while driving or walking. In the early days of Wi-Fi, when WLANs were not so common,
war drivers even used chalk on outside walls or sidewalks to mark the existence of
WLANs at each location.
After devices receive the network information in the beacon, they can begin to negotiate a
WLAN connection. To join the WLAN, the device will send an associate request frame to
the AP that includes the device’s own capabilities and supported transmission rates. The AP
then returns an associate response frame, containing a status code and a device ID number
that will be used as long as it remains connected to the same AP. At this point, the device
becomes part of the WLAN and can begin communicating.
A device can be preconfigured to connect to a specific WLAN. In this case, the device is
already configured with the SSID of the WLAN. Likewise, some APs can be configured to
accept or reject a connection from certain devices, usually based on a device’s MAC
address. As it receives beacon frames from the different APs, the device compares its pre-
configured profile’s BSSIDs with the BSSID of the preferred AP. The device will not
attempt to connect to APs until it finds a match, at which time it will send an associate
request frame to that AP. If a device has not been preconfigured to connect with a specific
AP, it will attempt to connect with the AP from which it has received the strongest
radio signal. User intervention is required at the device to create a profile to connect to
WLANs.
Devices can only be associated with one WLAN at a time. Reassociation happens when
mobile devices roam beyond the coverage area of one AP in an ESS and are receiving a stron-
ger signal from a different AP in the same ESS, in which case the device reassociates with the
new AP. Reassociation can also occur when the signal from one AP weakens because of inter-
ference, but there is another AP using a different channel, within range.
When a device determines that the link to its current AP is poor, because it has been scanning
the medium and maintaining information related to the various APs in an ESS, it will switch
to the frequency of the AP with the strongest signal and send a reassociate request frame. If
the new AP accepts the reassociation request, it will send a reassociate response frame to the
device. The new AP will then send a disassociate frame to the previous AP that the device was

connected to, via the wired network. This process is shown in Figure 6-10. The only time a
device sends a disassociation frame to an AP is when it is made to disconnect from the
WLAN by user intervention.
In the 802.11 standard, multiple APs can only communicate with one
another over the network cabling. In other words, they cannot commu-
nicate over a wireless connection. As you will learn in Chapter 8, there
are two separate enhancements to the 802.11 standards that permit
APs to communicate with each other over the wireless medium.
Power Management
Most devices in a WLAN are laptop computers, smartphones, or tablets, giving the users the
freedom to roam without being tethered to the network by wires. When these devices are
mobile (and consequently not connected to a power outlet), they depend on batteries as their
primary power source. To conserve battery power, wireless NICs can go into sleep mode.
When a device is participating in a WLAN, it must remain fully powered up to receive net-
work transmissions. Missing transmissions because the NIC is in sleep mode may cause an
application running on the device to drop a connection-oriented TCP session. The answer to
the issue of a battery-powered device being able to shut down its radios to save energy is
known as power management. In the 802.11 standard, power management allows the mobile
device’s NIC to turn off its radios as often as possible to conserve battery but still not miss out
on data transmissions. Power management in 802.11 is transparent to all protocols and appli-
cations so that it does not interfere with normal network functions. Note that in 802.11 the
power management function can only be used when devices connect in infrastructure mode.
A NIC going into sleep mode is not the same as when a laptop or
other mobile device goes into sleep mode. As defined in 802.11, a
NIC in sleep mode must remain powered up. When a laptop, for
example, goes into hibernate or standby mode, the NIC also shuts
down completely and the laptop is unable to maintain TCP sessions.

The key to power management is synchronization. Every device on a WLAN has its own local
timer. At regular intervals, the AP sends out a beacon signal that contains a time stamp.
Devices will turn on their radios during every beacon transmission to receive these frames
from the AP and synchronize their local timers with that of the AP.
When a wireless device goes into sleep mode by turning off its wireless NIC radios, it first
informs the AP of the change in its status. The AP keeps a record of those devices that are
awake and those that are sleeping. When the AP receives frames from the network destined
for devices that have the radios off, it will temporarily store the frames that are destined to
the devices that are in sleep mode (this function is called buffering).
Since the AP has only a limited capacity to buffer frames, in the next beacon, it will add a
traffic indication map (TIM) containing the IDs of the devices for which it has buffered
frames. All devices that have been sleeping must awaken (by turning on their wireless radio)
and go into an active listening mode during beacon transmissions. If a device learns that it
has buffered frames waiting at the AP, it will send a request to the AP for those frames. If
the TIM does not include the device ID of a particular device, signaling that it has no buffered
frames, the device can return to sleep mode. This process is shown in Figure 6-11.
The typical sleep time for a battery powered device is usually set to
about 100 milliseconds, which is the amount of time between bea-
con frames.

MAC Frame Formats
To understand many of the intricacies of how CSMA/CA works, how backward compatibility
with legacy devices is handled by the latest amendments to the standard (covered in the next
chapter), as well as some of the challenges of troubleshooting WLANs, it is important to
understand the MAC frame formats. The 802.11b standard specifies three types of MAC
frames. The first type of MAC frame is known as the management frame. These frames are
used to set up the initial communications between a device and the AP. The association, reas-
sociation request, the reassociation response frame, and the disassociation frames are all
examples of management frames.
The format of a management frame is shown in Figure 6-12. The Frame control field indicates
the current version number of the standard and whether encryption is being used. The Dura-
tion field contains the number of microseconds needed to transmit. This value will differ
depending on whether the PCF or DCF modes are being used. The Sequence control field is
the sequence number for the frame and, if necessary, the fragment number.
Control frames are the second type of MAC frame. After association and authentication
between the devices and the APs are established, the control frames provide assistance in deliv-
ering the frames that contain the data. RTS and ACK frames are examples of control frames.
The format of a control frame is shown in Figure 6-13.

Data frames are the third type of MAC frame. They carry the information to be transmitted
to the destination device. The format of a data frame is shown in Figure 6-14. The fields
Address 1 through Address 4 contain the destination MAC address, the source MAC address,
and the transmitter MAC address and the receiver MAC address, depending on how the net-
work is configured. The number of address fields varies depending on the type of MAC frame
transmitted.
A full discussion of the use of the address fields is beyond the scope
of this book, but the reason for having four address fields, instead of
the two used in Ethernet, has to do with the use of a wireless
repeater, sometimes called a signal booster in consumer product ads.
As you know, in a wired network, switches transfer frames at layer 2
and do not change the MAC address field. Conversely, routers must change the source and des-
tination MAC addresses (but not the IP addresses) every time they forward a frame. Even though
APs are not routers, they also use and change the source and destination MAC addresses when-
ever they forward frames in a WLAN. Note that only one repeater per AP is allowed by the
802.11 standard. For additional information regarding the content of the address fields, see
the 802.11-1999 standard. You can find it at http://standards.ieee.org/about/get. Copies
of the IEEE standards are usually available at no cost 6 months after the publication of a
standard or amendment.
Interframe Spaces
To understand the message exchange process in a WLAN, you need to understand the colli-
sion avoidance mechanism in DCF that APs and wireless devices use to communicate. For
CSMA/CA to work properly in DCF, the 802.11 standard defines a number of interframe
spaces (IFS) or time gaps between frames in a WLAN. These are designed to handle the con-
tention for the medium among several devices attempting to communicate.
To keep this explanation as simple as possible, we will only review the procedure and rules
associated with using DCF. We will not look at the procedure or rules associated with RTS/
CTS or PCF. For additional information, refer to the 802.11-1999 standard.
In 802.11, interframe spaces perform various critical functions:
●
The Short Interframe Space (SIFS) is a time period used to allow all transmitted signals
to arrive and be decoded at the receiving device, including multipath signals that take a

longer trajectory and arrive later at the receiver. A SIFS occurs immediately after the
transmission of each frame, regardless of type. No devices are allowed to transmit during
the SIFS. If a frame has been transmitted to one specific device, and provided there were
no errors, the receiving device will send an ACK immediately after the SIFS time.
●
The DCF Interframe Space (DIFS) is a time period during which all devices must wait
between transmissions of data frames. The DIFS occurs after the transmission of an
ACK or right after the SIFS if the frame transmitted was a broadcast (no ACKs are
transmitted in response to broadcast frames). A device waiting to transmit will listen to
the medium during the DIFS. If it does not hear any transmissions during the DIFS, it
will be allowed to transmit a frame, otherwise it will defer the transmission.
The times of these space intervals are measured in microseconds, as shown in Table 6-2.
The basic rules of communication in an 802.11 network are as follows (see Figure 6-15):
●
A device that wants to transmit begins listening for an RF signal on the medium,
which indicates the presence of frame traffic on the network, during the DIFS.

●
If no RF signal is detected at the end of the DIFS and the device’s backoff interval has
counted down to 0, it can begin transmitting a frame.
●
The size of a frame includes both the length of time necessary to send the data and the
SIFS time, and every device that receives this information will not transmit for the
duration or a frame transmission by another device, assuming it “heard” and
understood its transmission. When the transmission is over, the sending device begins
listening for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiving device.
●
The receiving device must send the ACK immediately after the SIFS. After receiving an
ACK, the transmitting device begins to wait for a random number of time slots, its
backoff interval.
●
If the transmitting device does not receive an ACK after the SIFS, it is allowed to
maintain control of the medium and begin retransmitting the frame that was not
acknowledged immediately after the DIFS time. It will try to do this a few times and
then indicate an error to the upper protocol layers.
●
If the frame was acknowledged correctly, the transmitting device listens to the medium
and counts down while waiting its random backoff interval, except during the SIFS or
DIFS or during a transmission by another device. Once the backoff interval ends, the
device checks for traffic at the end of the next DIFS and the process repeats itself from
the first point above.
In the case of two devices having frames to transmit, the process works as follows (see
Figure 6-16):

●
Device A has a frame to transmit. Its backoff period counter is 0. It senses the carrier
during the DIFS (the one on the left in Figure 6-16) and finds no traffic on the
medium. At the end of the DIFS, it begins transmitting a frame.
●
Device B had two time slots left to count down, but it can only do so during a
contention access period.
●
After Device A finishes the transmission of its data frame, it sets its random backoff
counter to 3.
●
The network enters a contention access period, and both Device A and Device B begin
counting down their respective backoff time slots.
●
After two time slots, Device B’s backoff counter reaches 0 and it has something to
transmit. Device B finds the medium free during the DIFS and transmits the frame
immediately after.
●
Like Device B before, Device A does nothing, except count down, after a DIFS and
when the medium is free. Once Device B has received an ACK for its most recent
transmission, the process described above starts over.
The process just described is what actually occurs in an IEEE 802.11 WLAN, and it is the
essence of the DCF collision avoidance method. However, collisions may still happen. One
of the most common causes is what is called the “hidden node” problem, when two (or
more) devices are able to communicate with the AP but may be too far away or blocked by
an obstacle and cannot “hear” each other. This is when RTS/CTS solves the problem. When
an AP sends out a CTS frame, all devices are able to receive it. The CTS frame includes the
amount of time required for a particular device to transmit its frame, so all other devices
will refrain from transmitting until after they “hear” an ACK frame.
Chapter Summary
■The wireless technology that attracts the most attention today is wireless local area
networks (WLANs). WLAN deployments continue to grow, and usage is increasing at
a dramatic pace, all because WLANs allow users to access networks such as the Inter-
net from a wider range of locations than was ever possible before.
■A wireless NIC performs the same functions as a wired NIC, except instead of a port
for a cable connection to the network, the wireless NIC uses an antenna to send and
receive RF signals. Wireless NICs are available in many different formats.
■An AP’s main function is to interconnect the wired network and the WLAN. The AP
acts as the base station for the wireless network and also serves as a bridge between
the two networks. An AP consists of three major parts: an antenna, a radio transmit-
ter/receiver, and an RJ-45 wired network interface that allows it to connect by cable to
a standard wired network.
■An RF WLAN has two operating modes, ad hoc or infrastructure. In ad hoc (or peer-
to-peer) mode, the wireless devices communicate directly with each other without
using an AP. Ad hoc mode is known in the 802.11 standard as an IBSS. Infrastructure
mode, also known as the Basic Service Set (BSS), consists of wireless devices and an
AP. If more users need to be added to the WLAN or the range of coverage needs to be

increased, more APs can be added using the same network name, or SSID. This creates
an Extended Service Set (ESS), which consists of two or more BSSs.
■The original IEEE WLAN standard was 802.11. The IEEE 802.11 standard defines a
local area network that provides cable-free data access at a rate of up to 2 Mbps for
devices that are either mobile or in a fixed location. The 802.11 standard also specifies
that the features of a WLAN be transparent to the upper levels of the OSI protocol
model. However, the slow bandwidth of only 2 Mbps for the 802.11 standard proved
insufficient for most network applications. IEEE 802.11b was the first amendment
to the original standard and it added two faster transmission speeds, 5.5 and
11 Mbps. The IEEE 802.11b amendment also removed both infrared and frequency
hopping as technologies for implementing WLANs. (Later standards are covered in
later chapters.)
■The 802.11 standard uses a medium access method known as the distributed coordi-
nation function (DCF). DCF specifies that a modified procedure known as carrier
sense, multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) be used. CSMA/CA
attempts to avoid collisions. The CSMA/CA process ensures that all devices wait until
the medium is clear of all other transmissions in an attempt to reduce collisions.
CSMA/CA also reduces collisions by using explicit packet acknowledgment (ACK).
Although CSMA/CA reduces the potential for collisions, it does not eliminate them
altogether. The 802.11 standard provides two other options that may be used to
reduce collisions. The first is known as the request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS)
protocol. RTS/CTS reserves the medium for a single device to transmit. The second
option to reduce collisions is fragmentation. Fragmentation involves dividing the data
to be transmitted from one large frame into several smaller ones.
■The MAC layer of the 802.11 standard provides the functionality for a device to join a
WLAN. This functionality is known as association and reassociation. Association is
the process of communicating with the other wireless devices in ad hoc WLANs or
with the AP in order to become accepted as part of the network. To associate with a
WLAN, the device first scans the wireless medium and listens for beacons from the
APs. There are two types of scanning: passive scanning and active scanning. A device
may drop the connection with one AP and reestablish the connection with another,
which is known as reassociation.
■Mobile WLAN devices often depend on batteries as their primary power source. To
conserve battery power, they can go into sleep mode after a period of time. Power
management, as defined by the 802.11 standard, allows the mobile device to be off as
much as possible to conserve battery life but still not miss out on data transmissions
by waking up and listening to beacons. The beacon may contain a Traffic Information
Map (TIM) that indicates whether there is data waiting at the AP to be transmitted to
the device. If so, the device will then remain awake and request the data from the AP.
■The 802.11 standard specifies three different types of MAC frame formats. Manage-
ment frames, the first type, are used to set up the initial communications between a
device and the AP. Control frames, the second type, provide assistance in delivering
the frames that contain the data. Data frames, the third type, carry user the informa-
tion to be transmitted. The 802.11 standard also defines two different types of inter-
frame spaces (IFS), or time gaps, which are standard spacing intervals between the

transmissions of frames. Instead of being just dead space, these time gaps are used to
allow enough time for a device to finish receiving transmissions, checking for errors,
and sending an ACK. They form part of DCF to help prevent collisions.
■In 1999, IEEE approved the 802.11b standard. IEEE 802.11b added two higher
speeds, 5.5 and 11 Mbps, to the original 802.11 standard. With the faster data rates,
the 802.11b quickly became the standard for WLANs.
■The physical layer convergence procedure (PLCP) for 802.11b is exclusively based on
RF and direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS). The PLCP must reformat the data
received from the MAC layer (when transmitting) into a frame that the PMD sublayer
can transmit. The frame is made up of three parts, which are the preamble, the header,
and the data. The 802.11b standard uses the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medi-
cal (ISM) band for its transmissions and can transmit data at 11, 5.5, 2, or 1 Mbps.

Hands-On Projects
These Project assumes you are using Windows 7. Instructions for
using Windows 10 are included in Appendix A.
Project 6-1
In this project, you will configure a wireless network connection in Microsoft
Windows 7. As usual, there is more than one way to accomplish this task. Win-
dows 7 provides a built-in tool called WLAN AutoConfig, which is designed to
make it much simpler for the average computer user to connect to a wireless network. WLAN Auto-
Config can be used to connect to WLANs in most homes, offices, hotspots, as well as hotels. The pro-
cedure presented in this project is generic and can be used regardless of the type or make of computer
you have, provided that you are running the Windows 7 operating system. Setting up a connection to

an Enterprise network, which typically uses a separate authentication server, is more complex and will
not be covered in this exercise.
Manufacturers almost always provide WLAN utilities with their hardware, and in Windows you can
choose to configure a WLAN with either the WLAN AutoConfig tool or the WLAN NIC manufac-
turer’s utility. The manufacturer’s utility often has additional features, but it can be more complex to
use. For this project, you will be configuring an ad hoc WLAN. You will need two computers
equipped with wireless NICs.
1.
Log in to both computers as administrator or to an account with administrator privi-
leges. Windows will not allow you to complete any of the following steps unless you
are the system administrator or your account has administrator privileges.
2.
Click the Windows Start button on the lower-left corner of the Windows taskbar, and
then click Control Panel on the right-hand side of the Start menu.
3.
In Control Panel, search for and click Network and Sharing Center.
4.
When you set up an ad hoc network, your computer is not connected to a router or
DHCP server that can provide you with an IP address. Because of this, you will need
to configure a static IP address. You will also not have access to the Internet, only to
shared files on the other computer(s) connected to the same ad hoc WLAN.
5.
Once you have configured unique IP addresses on the WLAN NIC of each computer,
return to the Network and Sharing Center window. Click Manage wireless networks on
the menu in the left column of the window. If you have WLAN connections already con-
figured and your NIC is enabled, you will see a list like the one shown in Figure 6-17.

6.
Click Add in the toolbar above the network list area, then click Create an ad hoc
network in the pop-up window.
7.
Read the information on the “Setup a wireless ad hoc network” window that opens,
then click Next. Type a unique name for this network, one that is not being used by
any other students working on this project at the same time. Remember that the net-
work name is the SSID of the network and is case sensitive.
8.
Under Security type, click the drop-down box and select No authentication (Open).
9.
Click the check box next to Save this network, then click Next. Check the parameters of
your network, then click the Close button. You should now see your network at the top
of the list in the “Manage wireless networks” window. On the right-hand side of the ad
hoc network entry you just created, you will see that the network is configured to
“Manually connect.” Perform the same steps on the other computer(s) you want to con-
nect to your ad hoc WLAN.
10. If your ad hoc WLAN appeared at the top of the list in Step 9, once you finish configur-
ing the second computer, they should connect automatically. To check this, click the
Windows network icon located on the far right-hand side of your Windows taskbar. (If
your taskbar is located at either side of your computer screen, the icon will appear at
the bottom.) This is shown in Figure 6-18.
11. You will see a list of the networks available. Your ad hoc network name should be at
the top of the list, and it should say “Connected.” If it is not connected, click the ad
hoc network entry and click the Connect button. The connected ad hoc network should
look similar to the one highlighted by the ellipse in Figure 6-19, but with your own
SSID.

12. To test the connection to the other computer, click the Windows Start button on the left-
hand side of the taskbar and type cmd in the “Search programs and files” text box to open a
command window. At the command prompt, type ping and the IP address of the WLAN
NIC of the other computer you are using for this project, then press Enter. You should
receive three or four successful ping replies from the other computer, as shown in
Figure 6-20. (Remember that your IP addresses must be unique and may be different than
the one shown in the figure.)

and delete the ad hoc entry you just created from the “Manage wireless networks”
window.
Project 6-2
In this project, you will manually configure a wireless residential gateway,
which is more commonly known as a wireless router or broadband router, to
create a WLAN. The device used in this project is a Linksys WRT54G, but
you can use any model available to you and adapt the following instructions. The settings
you will configure are very similar among different manufacturers’ products, and even
when different names are used for the parameters, they are usually easy to figure out.
Remember that a wireless residential gateway includes an AP, a router, firewall, and a net-
work switch, and in some cases it also includes a built-in DSL or cable modem.
1.
Obtain a wireless residential gateway from your instructor, or you can use your own.
2.
If the device has external antennas, make sure they are positioned vertically; and if
they use a screw-in connector, make sure the antennas are finger-tight and do not
fall to the horizontal position again. Never turn on a wireless device equipped with
external antennas without first having them connected and tightened up. The absence
of a proper load at the output of the transmitter can damage the circuit. In addition,
despite the very low power levels of most WLAN devices, you are strongly advised to
never touch the antennas when the device is turned on as this may represent a health
risk.
3.
Connect an RJ-45 Ethernet crossover patch cable to one of the switch ports in the back
of the device. Note that one port is separated from the others and is usually marked
“WAN.” Do not connect anything to the WAN port. Plug the other end of the cable
into an Ethernet port on your computer.
4.
Plug in the power adapter and connect it to the back of your AP or broadband router.
5.
Make sure the Ethernet adapter on your computer is configured to obtain an IP address
automatically.
6.
Open a web browser. In the address line, type http://192.168.1.1 for a Linksys device.
Other manufacturers’ devices may use a different address. Consult the manual or down-
load it from the Internet for the device you have.
7.
At the login prompt, leave the user name blank and type admin in the password field.
The Linksys setup page will appear. For this project, you will not use an Internet

connection. You can leave all the fields in the main Setup page in their default settings
(see Figure 6-21).
8.
Click the Wireless tab to display the wireless setup page.
If you are setting up more than one Linksys AP or wireless router in
the same or an adjacent lab or classroom, make sure you select a
different channel for each of the devices. Recall that to avoid inter-
ference, you can only use channels 1, 6, and 11.
9.
Leave “Mode” as Mixed. Change the SSID to the same one you used in Project 6-1.
Click Save Settings. A page should appear indicating that your settings are successful.
Click Continue and you will be returned to the Wireless setup page (see Figure 6-22).

10. On the computer, click the network icon on the right-hand side of the taskbar to view
the wireless networks detected.
11. Click the SSID you set up on the gateway and then click the Connect button. Windows
may display an information dialog box stating that you are connecting to an unsecured
network. If so, click Connect Anyway. Windows will display a dialog box with a prog-
ress bar and the text “Connecting to <your SSID>.” If the connection is successful, Win-
dows 7 will close the dialog box and not give you any additional indication other than a
tiny icon on the taskbar that shows five bars.
12. You can verify the connection using the same procedures described in Steps 11 and 12
of Project 6-1.
Real-World Exercises
Exercise 6-1
A hotspot is a public place—such as a train, bus station, coffee shop, or restaurant—that offers
(usually) free Internet access to its customers. Using the Internet, search for hotspots by acces-
sing the websites for various nationwide cellular phone companies, such as AT&T or Sprint.
Alternatively, you can search the local media websites and local Internet service provider (ISP)
sites. If you have access to a laptop computer, wireless-enabled smartphone, or tablet com-
puter, and it is equipped with a WLAN interface, once you locate a hotspot, try to visit the
site and get a connection to the Internet. If you do not have access to the Internet, but you
can either telephone the provider or visit the hotspot location, interview the staff at the location
and write a one-page report describing how the wireless access is provided. What steps did you
have to go through to get a connection? For how long was the connection available? Was there
a cost associated with accessing the Internet? How many people use the service daily? Were
there any limitations? Who provides technical support for the site?
Exercise 6-2
Using the Internet, research wireless LAN applications. Compile a list of at least five WLAN
applications that you had not thought about before, and write a one-paragraph description

for each one. The paragraph should mention the challenges that you might face if you were
asked to provide support for such an implementation. If possible, contact users of the new
application and ask them about their particular experiences with the WLAN implementa-
tion. Add this information to your report.
Challenge Case Project
How do you measure a wireless network’s performance? In this project, you
will test your network and determine its speed of data transfer. Keep in mind,
though, that most wireless networks communicate in half-duplex mode, so the
data rate reported by the operating system does not reflect the maximum data
rate the network is capable of.
There are many network performance-testing tools available on the web. One of the most
popular is QCheck from www.ixiacom.com. You may be able to find others by opening
your favorite browser and, using the search engine of your choice, typing in the question
“How do you measure a wireless network’s throughput?” Browse the results that appear,
then download and install a free or trial version of one or more network-testing tools. Run
as many of the following tests as possible, using Wi-Fi-enabled devices that are available to
you, while copying a large file (over 10 MB) from one device to another:
●
Create and test an ad hoc link between two devices.
●
Test from a wired to a wireless device, and vice versa.
●
Test with more than one pair of devices transmitting via the same AP.
●
Run the tests in both directions.
●
Try to test with both a clear channel and one that is already in use in the same area.
You can use Acrylic Wi-Fi Home from www.acrylicwifi.com to view
available channels and signal strength.
Carefully record your results for each test, then write a one-page report detailing each of the
results, the tools and devices you used, and your conclusions.

Faster data rates and increased reliability have made 802.11 WLANs very competitive
with wired networks, and corporations continue to deploy WLANs as a viable alternative to
Ethernet. In terms of speed, WLANs have come a long way since the original IEEE 802.11
WLAN standard, established in 1997, offered speeds of only 1 and 2 Mbps. Today’s
WLANs can operate at data rates of 1 Gbps and higher.
At about the same time as the IEEE ratified 802.11b, they also released another specification
for WLANs operating in the 5 GHz unlicensed national information infrastructure or U-NII
band and could operate at up to 54 Mbps. These WLANs quickly became very attractive to
users because the speed of transmission represented a significant increase over that of
802.11b systems. In addition, wider bandwidth available in U-NII meant that 802.11a
offered an additional five channels, which gave it a clear advantage over the three usable
channel limit of 802.11b, for ESS deployments.
IEEE 802.11g
The main drivers for the development of the IEEE 802.11g standard were the demand for
higher Internet access speeds and the significantly higher throughput of wired networks. This
amendment was published in June 2003. IEEE 802.11g operates in the same 2.4 GHz ISM
frequency band as 802.11b, but supports data transmission rates of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and
54 Mbps in addition to the 802.11b rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps. This 802.11g amend-
ment is called Extended Rate PHY (ERP) in the standard.
The IEEE 802.11b amendment is called High-Rate (HR).
802.11g PHY Layer
The PHY layer for 802.11g introduced a transmission technology called orthogonal fre-
quency division multiplexing (OFDM) to the 802.11 standard. Instead of serializing the
data and modulating bits onto a single carrier using DSSS or CCK as in 802.11 or 802.11b,
respectively, OFDM divides 20 MHz of bandwidth in each of the three usable channels in
the ISM band into 52 subcarriers and modulates the bits of data onto 48 of them, then trans-
mits multiple bits and multiple copies of the same data at the same time at a slower data rate
than 802.11 or 802.11b. The extra four carriers are used to monitor the strength and quality
of the RF signal. The subcarriers are orthogonal to the adjacent subcarriers (on both sides),
meaning that the bandwidth used by each of them overlaps as shown in Figure 7-1. When
frequency channels overlap like this in the frequency domain, they do not interfere with each
other.

A full discussion of OFDM and why orthogonal frequencies do not
interfere with each other is an advanced topic that is beyond the
scope of this text.
In Chapter 3, you learned about multipath distortion, which occurs when the receiving device
gets the same signal from several different directions at different times, due to signal reflec-
tions, diffraction, or scattering. Even though the receiving device may have already received
the complete transmission, it must still wait until all reflections are received. If the receiver
does not wait until all reflections are received, some of the signals that arrive later may
spread into the next transmission because the reflected signals traveled a longer path and, as
a result, have been delayed. This type of problem is called intersymbol interference (ISI).
Using more complex modulation schemes that increase data transmission speed through hav-
ing more bits modulated onto each signal change—that is, making the transmission denser—
tends to make multipath distortion worse and force the receiver to wait even longer before it
gets the reflected signals. The required waiting time effectively puts a limit on the overall
speed of the WLAN.
OFDM avoids problems caused by multipath distortion by sending the bits slowly enough
that any delayed copies (multipath reflections) are late by a much smaller amount of time
than those sent in 802.11b transmissions. This means that the network does not have to
wait as long for the reflections to arrive at the receiver, thus the total throughput is actually
increased. With OFDM, in other words, the total amount of data sent in parallel over a given
unit of time is greater and the time spent waiting for reflections to arrive is less than with a
single-carrier transmission. A comparison between the two systems is shown in Figure 7-2.

Although the slower data transmission rate in OFDM may appear counterintuitive, the fact
that multiple bits of data are being transmitted at the same time in parallel means that
802.11g is able to achieve nearly five times the data rate of 802.11b. These transmissions
also use simpler modulation methods that are easier for the receivers to detect and decode.
Transmission Modes
The 802.11g amendment specifies two mandatory transmission modes along with two
optional modes. The first mandatory transmission mode is the same one used by 802.11 and
802.11b; it supports data rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps. The second mandatory transmis-
sion mode uses OFDM and supports 802.11g only.
Optional modes do not have to be implemented in a device, but will usually be tested for
compatibility by the Wi-Fi Alliance, if they are implemented. The first optional transmission
mode uses PBCC (packet binary convolutional coding) to transmit at either 22 or 33 Mbps.
To transmit at 22 Mbps, PBCC is essentially a more complex version of CCK used in
802.11b that changes the modulation from QPSK to 8PSK and is optimized to increase the
signal-to-noise ratio of the channel by 3 dB. To achieve the data rate of 33 Mbps using
PBCC, the 802.11g standard specifies a change in the clock rate used to transmit the chips
from 11 to 16.5 MHz. The preamble is transmitted with an 11-MHz clock (at 1 or 2
Mbps), and the change is accomplished in a 1-microsecond-long clock switch section of the
PLCP frame, as shown in Figure 7-3.

sion at 22 or 33 Mbps is binary phase shift keying (BPSK), which you learned about in
Chapter 2. PBCC was an effort by some chip manufacturers to increase the performance of
802.11b before the ratification of the 802.11g amendment.
The second optional transmission mode, known as DSSS-OFDM, also uses the standard
DSSS preamble of 802.11 and then switches to OFDM. Most manufacturers implement the
latter optional mode as a minimum, since it allows a mix of 802.11, 802.11b, and 802.11g
devices on WLANs. In both optional transmission modes, older devices are able to “under-
stand” the beginning of the transmissions as well as most control frames that are transmitted.
Recall that the length of the data portion of a frame is transmitted in the PLCP frame. When
non-802.11g devices receive the PLCP header they will remain quiet while an 802.11g frame
is being transmitted, even though they cannot decode an OFDM transmission. This is used to
prevent non-802.11g devices from transmitting because they are not able to “understand” an
OFDM signal, assume that there are no 802.11 communications at the moment, and trans-
mit, thereby causing interference in the form of signal corruption, which amounts to a colli-
sion, and reduces the performance of the network. When older devices are present on the
WLAN, control frames are transmitted using DSSS. This support for older devices that are
not compatible with 802.11g means that companies do not need to upgrade all of their
equipment, such as wireless barcode readers, when they deploy newer APs and devices, thus
protecting their investment. The downside of it is a reduction in WLAN performance due to
the slower transmission of PLCP headers and control frames.
Another important change incorporated at the PHY layer of 802.11g to allow compatibility
with legacy devices is related to signal timing. First, 802.11g specifies that any time a device
is transmitting at a higher rate than 802.11b, a 6-microsecond quiet time (no transmission) is
included at the end of every frame to allow additional processing time for all the reflected sig-
nals to arrive at the receiver and for the receiver to decode the data, but this also decreases
the performance of the WLAN. This has the effect of increasing the Short Interframe Space
(SIFS) duration from 10 to 16 microseconds. The PLCP frame format for 802.11g, used
when supporting 802.11 and 802.11b devices, is shown in Figure 7-4. The PLCP frame for-
mat used in 802.11g is essentially the same as for 802.11b, with the exception of the added
6-microsecond quiet time at the end.

802.11g MAC Layer
There is a significant performance penalty for 802.11g WLANs operating in mixed mode
(with 802.11 or 802.11b legacy devices) because every PLCP header is transmitted at
1 Mbps. The 802.11g amendment includes a change to the MAC layer for compatible
devices to slightly increase performance in this case by transmitting the entire PLCP frame
using OFDM, while still preventing collisions. To accomplish this, some changes were incor-
porated in MAC layer. Devices wanting to transmit in 802.11g can ensure the medium is
free, and then send a special control frame called CTS-to-Self using DSSS. A CTS-to-Self
frame is transmitted with a destination MAC address of the same station that is transmitting
the frame. Its purpose is to act as a protection mechanism notifying legacy devices (802.11
and 802.11b) to not attempt to “understand” or transmit during the entire frame exchange
that follows. The issue is that legacy devices cannot decode OFDM frames, so while they
may detect EM energy in the medium, they may attempt to transmit anyway and cause a col-
lision due to corruption. After transmitting a CTS-to-Self, 802.11g devices can then complete
the entire frame exchange using only OFDM.
To be fully compliant with the 802.11g amendment and 802.11a
(discussed in the next topic), devices must be able to transmit at 6,
9, 12, 18, and 24 Mbps. Data rates of 36, 48, and 54 Mbps are not
required for compliance with the IEEE standard.
Note that when the network is supporting only 802.11g devices, a setting that can be config-
ured in APs and residential wireless routers, the standard allows each time slot to be reduced
to 9 microseconds instead of 20 microseconds, which improves the performance of the
802.11g WLAN significantly.
IEEE 802.11a
The IEEE ratified and released 802.11b and 802.11a at roughly the same time in 1999.
802.11a products came to the market later because of technical issues and, at least initially,
the high cost of implementation.
The 802.11a standard maintains the same medium access control (MAC) layer frame formats
as 802.11g WLANs, with practically all differences confined to the Physical layer. It achieves

its increase in speed and flexibility over 802.11b through the use of OFDM and through a
more efficient error-correction scheme than 802.11b. The major difference is that, unlike
802.11b and 802.11g, 802.11a works in the 5 GHz U-NII band only.
This book refers to the amendments to the standards by the lower-
case letter appended to the end of the standard number (e.g., IEEE
802.11n). Every few years, the IEEE incorporates the content of sev-
eral amendments into one document, publishes a new standard doc-
ument and appends the year in which the work was completed (e.g.,
IEEE 802.11-2009, which includes the 802.11n amendment), but it is still important to know
and be able to refer to each amendment, since some of them are optional in the published
versions of the standard and are not implemented in every wireless NIC used in APs or
devices.
U-NII Frequency Band
Recall that the 802.11b standard uses one part of the unlicensed Industrial, Scientific, and
Medical (ISM) band for its transmissions and specifies 14 frequency channels that can be
used. The U-NII band is intended for devices that provide short-range, high-speed wireless
digital communications. Table 7-1 compares ISM and U-NII bands used in WLANs. Note
that part of the ISM band overlaps with U-NII in a portion of the 5 GHz spectrum. In the
ISM band these frequencies are not used for WLANs, but can cause interference. An example
of this is 5 GHz cordless phones, some of which are still in use.
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has segmented the total 555 MHz of
the U-NII spectrum into four bands. Each band has maximum power limits.
Usable frequencies, channels, and power limits in the U-NII band
have changed significantly over the years, vary among different
countries around the world, and may continue to change. The best
way to stay up to date is to search the web for this information,
looking for a link to your country’s regulatory agency that provides
this information. One example of this is that in 2008, the IEEE ratified the 802.11y amend-
ment, which extended operation of 802.11a to the licensed 3.7 GHz band. This band offers
increased power limits, which allows transmissions to achieve a maximum range of up to
16,400 feet (5,000 meters), but an FCC license is required to use it.

Although the U-NII band is segmented, the total bandwidth available for IEEE 802.11a
WLANs using U-NII is almost seven times that which is available for 802.11b. The ISM
band offers only 83.5 MHz of spectrum in the 2.4-GHz range, whereas the U-NII band offers
555 MHz.
Channel Allocation in 802.11a
The larger number of channels available is another reason for the better performance of
802.11a. Figure 7-5 shows a comparison of channel allocation with 802.11b/g and 802.11a.
In some countries, 802.11a has a total of 23 channels available. Each frequency channel is
20 MHz wide, and for 802.11a, as in 802.11g, each channel is divided into 52 subcarrier fre-
quencies, with each subcarrier being 300 KHz. This is shown in Figure 7-6.

The channel numbers in the 5 GHz band are the result of a mathe-
matical formula, whereas in the 2.4 GHz band, channel numbers 1
to 14 are arbitrarily assigned.
With only three channels available in the ISM band, it follows that a maximum of three APs
can be installed within a radius of roughly 300 feet. Using 802.11g APs, for example, this
would provide a maximum data throughput of only 162 Mbps (54 Mbps  3) spread evenly
across the three APs. Because there are more available channels than in the ISM band, addi-
tional APs can be installed in the same physical space, so more users can be supported simul-
taneously. A comparison of co-locating three APs in 802.11b versus co-locating, for example,
eight APs in 802.11a is shown in Figure 7-7.

This makes it easier to balance the user load per AP and increases WLAN performance as a
result. Another advantage of having more channels available is that if a nearby WLAN is
using the same channel as you are, you have more options and can set your AP to use a dif-
ferent channel to eliminate the interference.
OFDM is also the technology used for consumer-based digital sub-
scriber line (DSL) service, which can provide Internet access over stan-
dard telephone lines at speeds ranging from 256 Kbps to over
100 Mbps in some areas.
802.11a PHY Layer
The modulation techniques used to encode the data vary depending on the speed. At 6 Mbps,
binary phase shift keying (BPSK) is used (see Chapter 2). BPSK can encode 125 Kbps of data
per each of the 48 subcarriers, resulting in a 6,000 Kbps (125 Kbps  48), or a 6 Mbps data
rate. (You may wish to review the waveform shown in Figure 2-28.) Note that this section
describes only a few of the transmission rates and modulations used.
Whereas PSK has only two possible changes in the starting point of a wave, allowing 1 bit to
be transmitted at a time, quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) has four possible changes in
the starting point of a wave, allowing it to transmit 2 bits per symbol (see Chapter 2), as
shown in Figure 7-8. QPSK can double the amount of data encoded over PSK to 250 Kbps
per subcarrier, which produces a 12 Mbps (250 Kbps  48) data rate.
Transmitting at 24 Mbps uses 16-level quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM).
16-QAM has 16 different signals that can be sent, as shown in Figure 7-9. Each group of
bits modulated into one signal change in a carrier is called a symbol. Whereas QPSK trans-
mits 2 bits per symbol, 16-QAM can transmit 4 bits per symbol. For example, to transmit
the bits 1110, QPSK would send two symbols, a 11 and then a 10 by changing the phase.
16-QAM would only send one symbol (1110). 16-QAM can encode 500 Kbps per subcarrier
for a data rate of 24 Mbps.

A data rate of 54 Mbps is achieved by using 64-level quadrature amplitude modulation
(64-QAM), which can transmit at a rate of 1.125 Mbps over each of the 48 subcarriers (see

Hardware designers cannot increase the complexity of the modulation on the subcarriers
beyond the maximum 54 Mbps rate because of the maximum amount of noise or the mini-
mum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) allowed, unless they use a more complex modulation.
However, that would also make it harder for the receiver to decode the signal and the trans-
mission would be less reliable. As you will see in the section on 802.11n, reliable transmis-
sions at higher speeds requires a wider bandwidth and more subcarriers.
The IEEE made only minor changes to the PCLP frame format in 802.11a, as shown in
Figure 7-11.
The differences between the PLCP frame for 802.11a, as compared to 802.11g, when it is
transmitting in 802.11g-only mode, are outlined below.
●
Parity—This single bit is used to check for errors in the previous fields.
●
Tail (Header portion of the frame)—Indicates the end of the header. All six bits are set to 0.
●
Service—The first seven bits are used to initialize part of the transmitter and receiver
circuits and are set to 0; the remaining nine bits are reserved for future use and are
also set to 0. The Service field is part of the header but is transmitted at the same rate
as the Data field.
●
Tail (Data portion of the frame)—Indicates the end of the Data field. All six bits are set to 0.
●
Pad—The IEEE standard specifies that the number of bits in the Data field must be a
multiple of 48, 96, 192, or 288. If necessary, the length of the Data field may need to
be extended with padding bits to match this requirement.
Error Correction in 802.11a/g
IEEE 802.11g and 802.11a also handle errors differently than 802.11b. Because transmissions
are sent over parallel subcarriers, interference from other signal sources is minimized. Instead

of the interference impacting the entire data stream, it generally affects only one subcarrier.
IEEE 802.11a/g uses a technique called forward error correction (FEC), which transmits extra
bits per byte of data, in addition to multiple copies of the same data. The extra bits allow the
receiver to recover (through sophisticated algorithms) bits that may be lost during the trans-
mission. This can eliminate a lot of retransmissions when errors occur, which saves time and
increases the total throughput of the WLAN. A full discussion of FEC is beyond the scope of
this book, but it is widely employed in many modern digital communications systems.
The extra bits transmitted when using FEC means that transmission
overhead is increased, but because of the higher data transmission
rate, 802.11a/g can accommodate the FEC overhead with a negligi-
ble impact on WLAN performance.
IEEE 802.11n
As you have realized by now, work on dynamic standards such as those for WLANs has not
stopped. User demand for faster and more reliable WLANs suggests that the IEEE will con-
tinue to enhance these technologies for the foreseeable future.
The IEEE began working on the 802.11n amendment in 2004, shortly after the ratification of
802.11g in 2003. By then, it was clear that 54 Mbps was not enough for the 802.11 standard
to compete effectively with wired networks. The work on 802.11n became the most widely
discussed enhancement to this WLAN technology. A few consumer equipment manufacturers
began introducing devices based on the first draft of the standard. Before we continue discuss-
ing this technology, it is important for you to understand that 802.11n is an extremely com-
plex topic that could easily fill a book on its own, so this section provides an overview of the
differences between 802.11n and the amendments discussed above, but it is not intended to
offer complete coverage of 802.11n.
The excitement about this new technology reached a high point when the Wi-Fi Alliance began
certifying equipment based on the second draft of the amendment in 2007, roughly 2 years
before the members of the IEEE ratified the standard. The 802.11n amendment is called high
throughput (HT), and it was finally ratified and published by the IEEE near the end of 2009.
In Chapter 3, you learned about multipath interference and how it can degrade the quality of
a signal to the point where the SNR is so low that the data can easily become corrupted and
no longer understood by a receiver. HT utilizes a completely new approach to implementing
the PHY layer. The 802.11n amendment uses multiple antennas along multiple radios in each
device. This allows it to take advantage of multipath interference to actually increase the SNR,
which results in an increase in the range and reliability of WLAN transmissions. Additional
enhancements to the MAC layer, together with the changes to the PHY layer, help 802.11n
achieve data rates that were not possible before.
Although the transmission techniques are somewhat different than those of previous versions
of the standard, HT-capable devices are required to maintain backward compatibility with all
previous amendments and published versions of 802.11. IEEE 802.11n was also a bit of a
compromise, in that it works in both the 2.4 GHz ISM band as well as in the 5 GHz U-NII
IEEE 802.11n

band. When operating in the U-NII band, it is also required to maintain backward compatibil-
ity with 802.11a.
MIMO and Beamforming
Multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technology is based on using multiple radios,
both transmitters and receivers, as well as multiple antennas. Until its introduction in
802.11n, most WLAN devices employed a single radio with two antennas and supported a
technique called antenna diversity. With antenna diversity, the receiver senses which one of
its two antennas is getting the strongest signal from the transmitter, and when it sends a
response frame—an ACK, for example—it uses the antenna that received the strongest
signal.
Instead of antenna diversity, 802.11n MIMO-capable devices use multiple radios, each with
its own antenna, and they can employ a technique called beamforming to virtually direct a
transmission back to the device from which they just received a frame, thus increasing the
transmitted signal’s range. Beamforming works very much in the same way that phase array
antennas work, which you learned about in Chapter 4, by changing the phase of the signal
transmitted by different radios to maximize the strength of the signal at the receiver end.
There are several videos available on YouTube that show how beam-
forming works. A good one from Cisco can be found at this link:
http://youtu.be/8rMtqRObvvU.
Multiple radios can also increase the throughput. Instead of transmitting a frame via a single
radio, 802.11n MIMO-capable devices break up a frame into multiple parts and transmit
each part via a different radio. This is called spatial multiplexing. At the receiver end, the
data is reassembled into a full PHY frame before being passed back to the MAC layer.
Figure 7-12 shows a graphical example of this concept. Note how different part of the frames
may travel different paths and be detected first by different receiver antennas, which is one of
the ways that 802.11n uses to take advantage of multipath and increase the effective range of
Wi-Fi signals.

The 802.11n amendment specifies radio configurations using multiple transmitters and recei-
vers called radio chains, using up to four transmitters and four receivers, for a maximum
transmission speed of 600 Mbps, or 150 Mbps per radio. No 802.11n equipment has yet
been manufactured with four transmitters. Instead, equipment designers waited until the
next amendment, discussed later in this chapter, to produce chipsets that support larger
radio chains. To pass the Wi-Fi Alliance and be certified as 802.11n compatible, devices
must support a minimum of two spatial streams, which is also the only way to achieve a
data rate of 150 Mbps.
A 2  3 (two-by-three) device has two transmitters and three receivers, whereas a 3  3
device has three transmitters and three receivers, and so on. The number of transmitters
must always be equal to or higher than the number of spatial streams supported. Consumer-
class device specifications seldom list these capabilities in their specifications, on the box or in
the user guide. Enterprise-class AP specifications often show how many spatial streams are
supported by adding a colon and a digit to the end of the number of transmitters and recei-
vers, such as 2  3:2, which means two transmitters and three receivers, and is capable of
transmitting two spatial streams, for example.
Figure 7-13 shows examples of 2  3 and 3  3 MIMO APs. To take advantage of spatial
multiplexing, the receiver needs to have the same number of radios as the transmitting device.
If, for example, a device is only capable of receiving two streams, the transmitter will only
send the maximum number of spatial streams that the receiving device can handle. The
more radios a device has, the higher the cost as well as the higher the power consumption.
Because of these two factors, practically no manufacturers have implemented devices beyond
a 3  3 configuration in 802.11n.

Consumer-class residential Wi-Fi routers are often listed as N900,
suggesting that it can achieve 900 Mbps. This can be misleading.
What it actually means is that this equipment is capable of operating
in both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands and is capable of transmitting at up
to 450 Mbps in each band. However, keep in mind that no wireless
device, other than the router itself, can transmit or receive in both bands at the same time.
The N900 designation means that the device is MIMO-capable, has three transmitters and
three receivers for each frequency band, and supports three spatial streams. An N300 device
in comparison, has only two transmitters, but may have three receivers, would support up to
two spatial streams, and 40 MHz of bandwidth.
Spatial multiplexing and beamforming can be combined to increase both the range and reli-
ability of transmission. Both of these techniques rely on feedback information from the
receiver, meaning that any two devices need to be able to somehow evaluate each other’s
capabilities and wireless medium information, such as signal quality. Information about spa-
tial multiplexing capabilities is usually advertised by devices during association with the
WLAN. Beamforming capability can be learned by the devices monitoring the pilot carriers
or by an exchange of information using special wireless medium sounding frames. There are
two different ways APs can establish a device’s capability to support beamforming, which
requires multiple radios. Most 802.11n devices either estimate the beamforming from the
frames received from a device or infer the capabilities of the devices based on frames that
are lost. The amendment also specifies an explicit way of determining a device’s capabilities
using special frames that devices reply to, and the reply is used by the transmitter to establish
what method to use when transmitting data to the device. Explicit beamforming requires that
both devices support this capability. Older 802.11a/g devices cannot participate in this type
of frame exchange, so most APs determine a device’s capabilities only via the implicit
method.
Channel Configuration
One of the ways 802.11n is able to achieve higher data rates is by using more bandwidth in
both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. IEEE 802.11a and 802.11g each consume 20 MHz of band-
width to transmit using OFDM; 802.11b uses about 22 MHz of bandwidth.
HT radios can support both DSSS and OFDM in the ISM band, which means they can be
configured to automatically use 22 or 20 MHz of bandwidth respectively, and support com-
munications with 802.11b and 802.11g devices. However, the higher speeds of up to 300 or
600 Mbps can only be achieved if the radios are configured to utilize 40 MHz of bandwidth.
In the ISM 2.4 GHz band, this means that HT will use either channels 1 and 6 or channels 6
and 11, and this can result in excessive interference in channel 6 if more than one AP is in
use or if channel 6 is already being used nearby, whether in an office building, a public hot-
spot network—such as a coffee shop—or in a residential neighborhood.
The kind of interference that happens when two devices are using the same channel on a dif-
ferent BSS is called co-channel interference. Depending on how close the WLANs or the BSSs
are, interference on channel 6 may prevent 802.11n devices from achieving their maximum
data rates in the ISM band. The only viable solution in this case is to deploy equipment that
works in the 5 GHz U-NII band.

When communicating with other HT devices, 802.11n radios divide the frequency space into
56 subcarriers for 20 MHz of bandwidth and use four of them as pilot subcarriers. When
using 40-MHz-wide channels and communicating with other 802.11n devices that are also
capable of using the wider bandwidth, the radios divide the frequency space into 114 subcar-
riers and use six of them as pilot subcarriers. In essence, HT combines two 802.11 channels
in either the 2.4 or 5 GHz frequency band to allow it to carry more data. Figure 7-14 shows
a graphical example of the channel bonding in 802.11n. Note how the channels overlap on
channel 6 in the 2.4 GHz band when using 40-MHz-wide channels.
Keep in mind that the only way 802.11n can use 40 MHz channels in the 2.4 GHz band is
when there are no other WLANs within range that are either not capable or are also using
the
wider
bandwidth.

all
802.11n-capable devices to use only 20 MHz and the maximum data rate will therefore be

Guard Interval As was discussed in the “IEEE 802.11a” section, to transmit digital sig-
nals, data is modulated onto a carrier in either single-bit streams or groups of bits called
symbols. The more bits that are encoded in each symbol, the higher the data rate. In non-
HT transmissions (compatible with 802.11a/g), because of multipath, a certain amount of
delay is required at the end of every frame to allow all reflected signals to arrive at the recei-
vers. This is called a guard interval (GI), and it prevents a new symbol from arriving at the

receiver before the last multipath signal reaches the receiver’s antenna, which can cause data
corruption. As mentioned earlier, this kind of data corruption is called intersymbol interfer-
ence (ISI). Although it normally takes a maximum of 200 nanoseconds for all the multipath
signals to arrive at the receiver’s antenna, the GI, in order to prevent data corruption,
should always be two to four times larger than that. In 802.11a/g, the GI is set at
800 nanoseconds.
The 802.11n amendment specifies an 800-nanosecond GI for compatibility with 802.11a/g,
but it optionally specifies a 400-nanosecond GI to reduce the symbol time and increase data
rates by about 10 percent. When using the shorter GI, ISI can still occur, and the resulting
data corruption means that frames would have to be retransmitted, which has the effect of
reducing throughput.
Modulation and Coding Sets Because of the multiple factors involved in determining
the data rate in 802.11n—the type of modulation, the number of spatial streams, the GI, the
FEC coding, and so on—802.11n uses a combination of nine different factors to define
the data rates. These combinations are referred to as modulation and coding sets (MCSs).
The 802.11-2012 version of the standard lists 77 different definitions that apply to both
20-MHz-wide and 40-MHz-wide channels, each specifying a different data rate. There are
eight mandatory MCSs supporting data rates of up to 72.2 Mbps. All the other data rates, up
to those for a 4  4 device supporting up to 600 Mbps, are optional. Some 802.11n MCSs sup-
port the use of unequal modulation in the same frame transmission from different radios and to
the same destination device. Many of the MCSs specified in the amendment are seldom used
and have never been implemented by manufacturers. One example of these is the unequal mod-
ulation MCSs. In comparison, 802.11a and 802.11g support only 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and
54 Mbps, and the only mandatory rates, as discussed before, are 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 Mbps.
HT PHY Layer The 802.11n HT PHY layer supports three different frame formats. The
first frame format is used to transmit in non-HT mode when communicating with 802.11a/g
devices. The second frame format is used in mixed environments, with both HT and non-
HT (legacy 802.11a/g devices). This allows non-HT devices to decode the beginning of the
preamble, which contains information about the duration of the frame, so that legacy
devices will not attempt to communicate until the transmission ends, thereby avoiding colli-
sions. The third frame format is used when the WLAN is exclusively supporting 802.11n
devices. This mode of operation is called greenfield and is not compatible with non-HT
devices. Though optional in 802.11n, it is the most efficient way to communicate with
other HT devices if legacy support is not required. Greenfield mode is also not possible
when there are legacy devices either present or within range of the WLAN, in an overlap-
ping frequency channel.
HT MAC Sublayer The 802.11n MAC sublayer includes enhancements designed to
address the increase in throughput and power management. Power management becomes
really important in 802.11n because of the optional use of multiple radios. The more radios
a device has, the faster it can communicate, but the more power it will consume, and this is
particularly problematic for small handheld devices. The amendment addresses this issue by
allowing devices to turn off all radios except one when they are not transmitting or receiving
frames addressed to them.

Another enhancement deals with frame aggregation, a method of combining multiple MAC
frames into one PHY frame to reduce frame transmission overhead, which contributes to
increased WLAN throughput and reduced collisions.
There are two variations of frame aggregation. The first combines multiple MAC frames
into one PHY frame, removing the individual headers. When using this method, all MAC
frames must be of the same type, meaning that voice frames cannot be combined with
video frames. The aggregated frames must also have a single destination—in other words,
they must be unicast frames. As you know, in 802.11 the receiver must acknowledge each
transmitted MAC frame, but in this case a single ACK is transmitted for the entire group of
aggregated frames, which saves time and overhead, increasing throughput. The disadvantage
of this method is that, should an error occur, the entire group of aggregated frames must be
retransmitted.
The second method of frame aggregation combines individual MAC frames, including the
headers, body, and trailers. Here again, the frames must all be unicast. In this case, the
receiver sends an ACK for each individual MAC frame. However, if the receiving device is
802.11e compliant (discussed in the next section), then a block ACK frame is transmitted
back to the sender acknowledging the multiple MAC frames transmitted. In case of an
error, only the frames following the one in which an error was detected must be
retransmitted.
Because of the higher power consumption of 802.11n devices with multiple radios, the stan-
dard defines two new power management methods. In Spatial Multiplexing Power Save
(SMPS) mode, a MIMO device can shut down all but one of its radios. Beacons are trans-
mitted on the primary channel only, when using 40 MHz of bandwidth. If the TIM in the
beacon indicates that there is data waiting, the device turns on the other radios and informs
the AP, which will then transmit the buffered data using MIMO and spatial multiplexing if
the receiver is capable. In the second new power management method, called Power Save
Multi-Poll (PSMP), the devices also turn off all but one radio. When there is data to be
transmitted to the device, the AP informs the devices by transmitting an RTS frame using
DSSS. The destination device informs the AP when all of its radios are operating again, in
preparation for receiving the data using HT.
The Wi-Fi Alliance website offers several resources on the topic of
Wireless Multimedia (WMM) power management, especially for
mobile devices. For more information, visit wi-fi.org and search for
“WMM power save.” Note that to download some of these
resources you may need to register as a guest.
Reduced Interframe Space (RIFS) In greenfield mode, the 802.11n amendment
allows for a Reduced Interframe Space (RIFS)—a shorter (2-microsecond) interframe space
that can be used instead of a SIFS at the end of each transmitted frame, resulting in far less
timing overhead and helping further increase the overall throughput of 802.11n. Remember
that the SIFS interval in 802.11 is 10 microseconds long; in 802.11a/g, the SIFS is extended
by 6 microseconds at the end of each frame to allow the receiver to process the OFDM
signals.

HT Operation Modes To allow 802.11n WLANs to coexist with non-HT devices
(both APs and clients) and to allow devices that can only support 20 MHz channels (maxi-
mum data rate of 150 Mbps) to participate in the WLAN, 802.11n can operate in one of
four different modes, depending on the presence or absence of different types of devices.
Here are brief descriptions of these four modes of operation:
●
Mode 0, the greenfield mode, supports only HT-capable devices using either 20 or
40 MHz channels but not both in the same WLAN.
●
Mode 1 is an HT mode, but if the AP detects stations that are not HT-capable and
transmitting in a 20 MHz channel that interferes with either the primary or secondary
channel in a 40 MHz channel, the AP will employ the CTS-to-Self protection
mechanism to reduce or eliminate interference.
●
Mode 2 supports either 20 or 40 MHz channels. If the AP detects a device that cannot
communicate using a 40 MHz channel, it will employ protection mechanisms to allow
20-MHz-only devices to associate and communicate on the network.
●
Mode 3, also called non-HT Mixed Mode, is used when one or more non-HT devices
are associated with an HT AP. Mode 3 supports HT devices at 20 or 40 MHz and
employs protection mechanisms to allow non-HT devices to participate in the BSS. Of
all the modes, this is the one most commonly used and implemented by AP
manufacturers, because many networks have to support non-HT devices.
When operating in mixed modes and 40 MHz of bandwidth, 802.11n transmits the headers
in DSSS on the primary channel, to maintain backward compatibility with legacy devices as
well as with other 802.11n devices using 20 MHz-wide channels. It also does this if a legacy
device joins a WLAN operating in greenfield mode or if a legacy AP is detected within
range.
IEEE 802.11ac
IEEE 802.11n introduced higher transmission speeds by using a wider 40 MHz channel, but
the performance enhancement stretches the limit of the 83.5 MHz of bandwidth of the
2.4 GHz band, because it has only three usable channels for data transmission. One alterna-
tive to further increase the data rates would be to use more complex modulations and encode
more bits per symbol, but that would also negatively affect the reliability and range. A better
solution, introduced in the 802.11ac amendment, was to limit transmissions to the 5 GHz
band, which offers far more bandwidth and uses even wider channels with more subcarriers
to transmit more data than 802.11n. The U-NII band is also less crowded, and there is no
interference from Bluetooth, ZigBee, and other technologies.
The 802.11ac amendment increases data rates through the use of 80 and 160 MHz channels.
In addition to using the same channel widths and subcarriers as 802.11n, 802.11ac includes
80 MHz channels divided into 242 subcarriers with 8 pilot subcarriers and 234 usable for
data. A 160 MHz channel is divided into 484 subcarriers with 16 pilots and 468 usable. The
amendment also specifies the use of 256-QAM modulation, although this requires an extra
5 dB of SNR to ensure reliable communications. However, it does away with the unequal
modulation MCSs specified in 802.11n. With these channel configurations and 256-QAM
252

modulation, 802.11ac can increase the data rates from 433 Mbps to roughly 6.9 Gbps,
in addition to those data rates that can be achieved with 802.11n.
As of this writing, not all frequency ranges in the U-NII band are available in every country. The
FCC in the United States has been working closely with international regulatory agencies to open
up more of the band, but this process takes time. Note that 802.11ac continues to maintain
backward compatibility with all previous standards in the 5 GHz band. However, because in
some countries it may be difficult to bond eight channels for 160 MHz of bandwidth, the
802.11ac amendment does allow the use of two, nonadjacent 80 MHz channels, but in this
case the data rates will be limited to the maximum achievable with the narrower channel.
In 802.11ac, the theoretical maximum data rate for a single spatial
stream, using 160 MHz of RF bandwidth is 780 Mbps. When using
two, nonadjacent 80 MHz channels, the theoretical maximum data
rate is 866.7 Mbps. Data rates of 6.9 Gbps can only be achieved
when using eight spatial streams. You can check out all of the
MCSs for 802.11ac by searching for “802.11ac MCS rates” on the Cisco support forums at:
https://supportforums.cisco.com.
To achieve the higher speeds, 802.11ac, named very high throughput (VHT), can use
between two and eight radios to transmit a maximum of eight spatial streams per AP. If all
eight radios are present in an AP but not all are being used to communicate with a single cli-
ent device, the additional spatial streams can be used to communicate with multiple client
devices simultaneously. This feature is called multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO), and it will be
implemented in the second wave of the amendment. Figure 7-15 shows a graphical compari-
son between MU-MIMO and single-user MIMO.

IEEE 802.11ac simplifies the MCSs defined in 802.11n, most of which were never implemen-
ted, and trims the number down to only 10 MCSs. As more people purchase and install
802.11ac-capable devices, one of the drawbacks will no doubt be the increase in interference
due to overcrowding and the use of wider channels.
IEEE 802.11ad
The IEEE 802.11ad amendment was spawned by the Wireless Gigabit (WiGig) Alliance speci-
fication, which is discussed in the next chapter. The goal was to expand the 802.11 standard
to work in the 60 GHz portion of the ISM band. Using the 60 GHz band comes at the cost of
transmission range. At these high frequencies, even molecules of oxygen in the air absorb a
large portion of the EM energy of the signal and this limits the range to an average of about
6 feet (2 meters). Although the maximum range is about 33 feet (10 meters), this can only be
practically achieved in an environment with very few obstructions or other energy-absorbing
items, such as human bodies.
One of the key advantages of the 60 GHz band is that it has approximately 2 GHz of spectrum
available. This means that it can support very wide channels, carrying vast amounts of data
such as, for example, multiple 4K ultra-high-definition television signal streams, without suffer-
ing from adjacent or co-channel interference. It can support data rates of 7+ Gbps per second.
At this writing, IEEE 802.11ad-compatible residential wireless routers are available from a
few manufacturers and a few laptop computers support this amendment. The amendment spe-
cifies the ability of equipment to automatically switch to 802.11ac in the 5 GHz band when
devices move out of range of the 60 GHz signal.
PLCP frame formats get progressively more complex as a new
amendment is introduced. Coverage of advanced amendments
quickly falls out of the scope of this introductory text. More informa-
tion can be obtained by downloading a copy of the standard or
amendments from standards.ieee.org/about/get.
IEEE 802.11e
The IEEE 802.11e amendment was approved for publication in November 2005. It defines
enhancements to the MAC layer of 802.11 to expand support for LAN applications that
require Quality of Service (QoS), and it provides for improvements in the capabilities and effi-
ciency
of
the
protocol.
When
combined
with
enhancements
to
the
PHY
layer
in
802.11a/b/g/n/ac, it promises to increase overall system performance and expand the applica-
tion space for 802.11.
Unlike the 802.11a and 802.11g standards, which require that each frame be acknowledged
before a transmission can continue, 802.11e allows the receiving device to acknowledge after
receiving a burst of frames (i.e., after several frames are transmitted), which is also called
delayed acknowledgement. Figure 7-16 shows a diagram comparing the two methods.

The 802.11e standard enables prioritization of data frames, which is essential to support voice
streams over WLANs. In addition to delayed or burst acknowledgements, 802.11e implements
two new coordination functions: enhanced DCF (EDCF) and hybrid coordination function
(HCF), discussed later in this chapter.
All APs that comply with the 802.11e amendment must implement both modes, although the
network administrator has different levels of control over how these are configured. Both
modes include a traffic class (TC) definition. Emails, for example, would be assigned a low
priority, whereas voice communications would be assigned a higher-priority class. In EDCF,
a station with higher-priority traffic class waits less time to transmit and therefore has a better
chance of getting its traffic through, which is essential for Voice over IP (VoIP).
HCF is a combination of DCF and PCF. The interval between beacon frames is divided into a
contention-free period and a contention period. During the contention-free period, the hybrid
coordinator (the AP) controls access to the medium and, based on information about the

traffic received from a client, allocates more time slots to the station with higher-priority traf-
fic—such as VoIP frames. During the contention period, all stations work in EDCF mode.
This prioritization aspect is an important development for the 802.11 group of standards. The
802.11e standard enables voice, audio, and video to be transmitted reliably over WLANs by
supporting traffic prioritization based on QoS (quality-of-service). As you know, QoS is a net-
work resource reservation mechanism that allows certain types of network traffic—voice and
video, for example—to be transmitted with a higher priority than traffic that is not time sensi-
tive, such as copying a data file. QoS also adds improved security features for both mobile
and nomadic applications. A nomadic user is one who moves frequently from one location
to another, but does not use the equipment while in motion.
IEEE 802.11r
The amount of time required by 802.11 devices to associate with one AP and disassociate
from another in an ESS is in the order of hundreds of milliseconds. For 802.11 devices to be
able to support mobile phones used for voice calls, the reassociation time cannot exceed
50 milliseconds; otherwise, the human ear will sense a break in the continuity of the voice
stream. This will make users unhappy with the quality of the call, and they may stop using
that phone service. To support Voice over WLAN (VoWLAN), which enables organizations
to implement and use VoIP in their ESSs, the 802.11 standard needs a way to provide quicker
handoffs. As discussed previously, handoffs in a WLAN happen when a portable device con-
nects with a new access point and disconnects from the previous one. Another issue is that the
current 802.11 MAC protocol does not allow a device to find out if the necessary QoS
resources, such as the required number of time slots and security features, are available on an
AP before a telephone handset associates with it, which can affect the quality and reliability of
a voice call.
The 802.11r standard is designed to resolve these issues as well as security concerns regarding
the handoff. It does so by refining the MAC protocol and providing a way for the mobile
devices to communicate with multiple APs within range, on different channels, to establish all
the necessary parameters, including security and available processing resources, before a hand-
off occurs. This amendment to the standard is designed to enhance the convergence of wireless
mobile voice, data, and video.
IEEE 802.11s
Imagine that you need to deploy a WLAN over the entire downtown area of a medium-sized
city and provide seamless connectivity to all city employees for events and functions. Though
theoretically possible, connecting each of the APs to a wired network and configuring the sys-
tem would be a monumentally expensive and complex undertaking because of the need for
interconnecting all the different locations. Installing network cabling outdoors is not an
option, so the only way to address this would be to lease communications lines from a local
utility. Not only would this make the cost prohibitively high, but achieving high data rates
might also be difficult, depending on the types of communications lines available.

The ideal solution would be to connect the wireless APs to each other over the wireless
medium. However, as you recall from previous sections of this chapter, the original 802.11
standard did not provide a way for APs to communicate with each other over the wireless
medium, much less forward wireless data frame traffic.
The 802.11s amendment provides the solution. Figure 7-17 shows an example of a wireless
mesh network. In this figure, AP 5 provides a single connection to the Internet to keep the land-
line connection costs low. The laptop associated with AP 3 and the smartphone connected to
AP 7 would be able to access the wired network or the Internet because with 802.11s the APs
can communicate with each other over the wireless medium and forward the frames to AP 5.
Other Amendments and Amendments Currently
Under Development
As you have likely gathered from your reading of this introductory text, work on new amend-
ments to 802.11 is ongoing and shows no sign of slowing down in the near future. The
amendments mentioned in this book are by no means the only ones implemented in the pub-
lished versions of the 802.11 standard. For example, work has been completed on the
802.11ae amendment, which enables the prioritization of management frames to improve

access for applications other than voice, and the 802.11af amendment, which uses the recently
released analog over-the-air television frequency spectrum (Television White Spaces) to trans-
mit at sub-1 GHz frequency, at lower data rates but at much greater distances.
Additional work is being done by the IEEE (802.11ah) to develop standards for wireless com-
munications in other sub-1 GHz frequency bands (not TV White Space) to support Internet
connectivity for low-duty-cycle devices including a wide variety of data collection devices and
sensors that are part of the Internet of Things (IoT).
The IEEE is also working on the 802.11ax amendment, an enhancement that will enable
simultaneous communication with multiple devices (multiple access) within a single OFDM
transmission. It differs from MU-MIMO in the sense that instead of using one or a group of
radio chains to transmit to different devices, different subcarriers transmitted by the same
radio chain will be assigned to different devices. This technology is already being tested and
developed for cellular communications and is expected to reach data rates of over 10 Gbps.
This work is expected to be completed in July 2018 and be ratified by March 2019.
Also under development is the IEEE 802.11ay amendment, an improvement of 802.11ad that
is expected to enable 60 GHz transmissions at 20 to 40 Gbps at distances of between 300 and
500 meters. This amendment is expected to be completed in 2017.
Chapter Summary
■IEEE 802.11g provided a significant improvement in performance over 802.11b and
sparked the phenomenal expansion in WLANs, both at home and in the enterprise.
This amendment preserved the features of 802.11b but increased the data transfer
rates up to 54 Mbps. It also laid the foundation for future amendments with its use of
OFDM and protection mechanisms.
■IEEE 802.11a networks use the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure
(U-NII) band. The total bandwidth available for IEEE 802.11a WLANs using U-NII is
555 MHz, almost seven times what is available for 802.11b networks using the ISM
band. This amendment, published at approximately the same time as 802.11b, also
has a maximum rated speed of 54 Mbps, but it had a slow start due to technical diffi-
culties, as well as the initial cost of equipment. Like 802.11g, it achieves its increase in
speed and flexibility over 802.11b through a higher frequency, more transmission
channels, and a new multiplexing technique, along with greater reliability, despite its
decreased range due to using higher frequencies. The availability of more channels
allows the deployment of more APs per area, supporting a larger number of simulta-
neous users. IEEE 802.11a also uses OFDM and is less sensitive to multipath distor-
tion of the signal because it divides each channel into multiple subcarriers and uses
simpler modulation methods.
■IEEE 802.11n, in practice, increases the data rate in WLANs to 450 Mbps in each of
the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands by bonding two channels and using 40 MHz of bandwidth
as well as a larger number of OFDM subcarriers to transmit more bits simultaneously.
This includes a number of necessary enhancements to the MAC and PHY layers and
continues to maintain backward compatibility with 802.11a/b/g. This amendment uses
multiple transmitters and multiple receivers (MIMO) to increase both the range and
258

reliability of WLANs through the use of beamforming and can use spatial multiplexing
to transmit multiple streams of data from each radio, further increasing performance.
■IEEE 802.11ac enhances WLAN performance even further, adding data rates from
433 Mbps up to 6.9 Gbps to the rates supported in 802.11n. It is limited to the 5 GHz
band and bonds either four channels or eight channels to achieve bandwidths of 80
and 160 MHz, respectively. It also allows a 160 MHz channel to be split into two
nonadjacent 80 MHz channels.
■The IEEE 802.11ad amendment works in the 60 GHz portion of the ISM band and
supports data rates of 7+ Gbps. It allows multiple 4K television signal streams over
short ranges of an average of 6 feet (2 meters) and can automatically switch to
802.11ac if devices move out of range.
■The 802.11e amendment adds QoS to the original 802.11 standard. In addition, it
helps improve performance through burst acknowledgements and two new wireless
medium coordination functions: enhanced DCF (EDCF) and hybrid coordination
function (HCF). This amendment also supports QoS for prioritizing data frames,
which is important to support voice communications in WLANs.
■The 802.11r amendment enables fast roaming and reduces the time required for a
device to associate with a new AP from hundreds of milliseconds to less than 50 milli-
seconds. This permits WLANs to effectively support voice communications in ESS
environments. It also allows a client device, prior to establishing a connection, to
obtain information from multiple APs regarding bandwidth availability and security
features.
■The 802.11s amendment enables APs to communicate and pass traffic from one to the
other over a wireless connection, supporting cost-effective deployment of extensive
mesh WLANs over a larger geographical area without the need to connect every AP to
the wired network.
■The IEEE continues to work on further enhancements to the 802.11 standard. One of
them is 802.11ax, which will allow independent communications with multiple devices
within a single frame transmission. IEEE 802.11ay will improve 802.11ad with trans-
missions at 20 to 40 Gbps, at distances of between 300 to 500 meters.

Hands-On Projects
Project 7-1
This Project assumes you are using Windows 7. Instructions for using
Windows 10 are included in Appendix A.
This project covers the basic configuration of an 802.11n- or 802.11ac-compatible residen-
tial gateway (wireless router) or AP. You can do this project using any manufacturer’s
device. The brand of the equipment is not important, because in the real world you will
likely be configuring a variety of different equipment makes and models. Although the con-
figuration screens may be different than the ones shown in the figures, the point of the exer-
cise is for you to understand which configuration items to modify and how these will affect
the speed and performance of the wireless links.
The device used to create this exercise are a DLink DIR-825 simultaneous dual-band (2.4
and 5 GHz) wireless residential gateway and a Dell Latitude E4300 Notebook PC, but virtu-
ally any type of N300, N600, or N900 wireless residential gateway and PC compatible with
802.11n will work. The project covers only those settings that are relevant and assumes you
already know (from Chapter 6) how to perform the basic configuration steps and connect a
computer with a wireless NIC to the gateway.
1.
Connect your computer to the gateway for configuration purposes. Whenever possible,
you should use a wired connection to change settings on a gateway or access point.
Hands-On Projects

Some of the settings, such as security, will cause your computer to disconnect until you
reconfigure it to use the new settings.
2.
Consult the documentation for your gateway on how to configure the wireless set-
tings manually. Even if a configuration wizard is available, it often does not pro-
vide you with enough control over the parameter settings, so you will want to fol-
low the procedures for manual configuration. Figure 7-18 shows an example of the
settings you need to access to fully configure the 2.4 GHz wireless settings for
802.11n.
3.
Configure a unique SSID for your WLAN. Consult your instructor in case there are
other devices being used in the same room.
4.
It is usually better, especially in 802.11n, to allow the gateway to automatically select the
channel, but you can select the channel manually, if you prefer, keeping in mind that,
with more than two gateways in the same room, there are really only two usable channels,
1 and 6, and that interference will affect the overall performance of your wireless link.
5.
To achieve data rates of up to 300 Mbps, you need to configure the gateway to use
Auto 20/40 MHz. Most gateways do not allow you to configure them for 40 MHz
operation only. Make sure you turn off any devices in the room—cellular phones,
and so on—that only support 802.11g and therefore can only use 20 MHz of
bandwidth. Otherwise, you may find that the WLAN will perform slower and only

use 20 MHz of bandwidth, limiting your data rates to approximately 150 Mbps. This is
because every time a broadcast frame is transmitted, the gateway needs to send it in a
way that is compatible with non-802.11n devices if they are connected to the gateway.
6.
You do not need to transfer any files to determine the maximum data rate (only to if
you wish to determine the throughput) for the connection. Microsoft Windows provides
this information in the Wireless Network Connection Status dialog box. To get to this
dialog box in Windows 7, click the wireless network icon on the bottom-right-hand
side of the taskbar and click Open Network and Sharing Center. On the right-hand
side of the window, click Wireless Network Connection. Figure 7-19 shows the Wireless
Network Connection Status dialog box.
7.
You will see the data rate beside the label, Speed. If your data rate is showing anything
less than 300 Mbps, you may need to modify the configuration of the NIC. To do this,
click the Properties button at the bottom of the Wireless Network Connection Status
dialog box (not the Wireless Properties button). This will open the Wireless Network
Connection Properties dialog box.
8.
Click the Configure button next to the name of your wireless NIC. Click the Advanced tab.
Note that some NIC manufacturers do not provide you with the ability to configure
advanced NIC parameters from this dialog box, in which case you may need to use the
manufacturer’s utility, which should have been installed when you set up your NIC. There

is no industry standard for configuring these parameters, so each manufacturer’s adapters
may use different parameter names. Figure 7-20 shows an example of the dialog box dis-
played for the Dell Wireless 1510 WLAN Mini-Card. Make a note of all the current set-
tings for your card before changing any values, and then make sure that it is configured for
802.11n and for 20/40 MHz. Try changing some of the settings that appear to be related to
bandwidth or standard support and observe the results as outlined in step 7 above.
9.
Use Acrylic Wi-Fi Home, which you installed and learned about in Chapter 6, and
check for interference from other networks using the same configuration you just com-
pleted. If your gateway device supports the 5 GHz band, perform the same configura-
tion steps on the gateway, but configure the 5 GHz band instead. Check the interference
with Acrylic Wi-Fi again and compare with the results you obtained for the 2.4 GHz
band. What differences did you notice? How much bandwidth is being used in the 2.4
and in 5 GHz bands? Note that Acrylic Wi-Fi also shows the maximum data rate possi-
ble in your WLAN in the column labeled, Max Speed.

WLAN data rates. Be sure to look at previous chapters in this book as required.
Create a table that lists what MAC and PHY layer enhancements were made to the standard
from 802.11 to 802.11ad that helped increase the data rates to those achievable today in
802.11ac. Be sure to include bandwidth, MCSs and modulation types (BPSK, QAM, etc.),
along with any changes introduced in the MAC layer.
Real-World Exercise
Exercise 7-1
The Baypoint Group (TBG) needs your help to prepare a presentation for Academic Com-

with technology issues. ACS would like to learn more about the differences and similarities
between 802.11n and 802.11ac.
Prepare a Power Point presentation that outlines the features and functionality of both
amendments to 802.11 and makes recommendations about which technology ACS should
recommend to its customers in a variety of situations, such as when equipment is used for
office applications and when wireless laptop computers are used by students. Your presenta-

Higher data rates and lower costs have made 802.11 WLANs very popular and
competitive with wired networks. WLANs continue to be deployed, expanded, and
enhanced at a very fast pace, especially in enterprises, as an alternative to wired Ethernet
networks. This chapter wraps up everything you learned so far about Wi-Fi. It provides a
review of the equipment, planning, and deployment of enterprise wireless networks, a task
that is very different from installing a WLAN in a home or small office.
Since the early days, the design of enterprise WLAN equipment has changed significantly.
The main reason behind this was to make it easier to plan, design, deploy, and manage
large wireless networks in manufacturing plants, large offices, entire corporate campuses,
educational institutions, hospitals, conference centers, and other large venues. Each of these
environments demands careful planning and design to ensure user satisfaction, reliability,
and security.
Wireless Bridges and Repeaters
Let’s begin by looking at different types of equipment designed to address issues that are
unique to enterprise-class environments.
Wireless Bridges
Wireless bridges can be used to interconnect wired or wireless networks between two
campus buildings that are beyond the range of the Wi-Fi signal, especially when there
are obstacles such as roads that need to be crossed, which can make using a wired con-
nection either impractical or too expensive to install. Opening up a road to install fiber-
optic cables can easily cost a few million dollars. Using existing wired technology
deployed by telephone carriers or other kinds of providers often means paying high
monthly fees. Instead, 802.11 bridges using directional antennas can be a good alterna-
tive. Multiple bridges and antennas can be combined in a single link to increase the
throughput. For example, the combined data rate of three bridged connections at
300 Mbps each would be 900 Mbps. Even when you consider all of the transmission
overhead in 802.11, the effective throughput of such a link might be enough to link two
networks and support a significant number of users. Interference is usually not an issue
because of the point-to-point nature of the connection; however, when deploying bridged
links using unlicensed RF bands, it is up to the users to ensure that no other RF trans-
missions intersect the directional signal between the bridges. A bridge connection
between two-wired LANs is illustrated in Figure 8-1.

For long-distance links, in which the signal takes longer to arrive at the receiver, transmitting
wireless bridges can extend the SIFS time, thereby allowing the receiver enough time to
acknowledge a frame. (Recall that the ACK is always sent after the SIFS.) Extending the
SIFS means that wireless bridges operate without fully conforming to the 802.11 standard,
but it is an acceptable practice in a bridged, point-to-point configuration. Bridged connec-
tions can be up to 16 miles (25.7 kilometers), but the longer the distance, the slower the
data rate. If you need to set up this type of connection, check your bridge specification care-
fully, and use the equipment vendor resources and expertise to test the connection before
implementing and supporting users.
WLAN Range Extenders (Repeaters)
Wireless bridges as well as some APs and wireless routers can be configured as repeaters to
extend the range of a WLAN. A bridge can often be configured to act as a repeater and connect
to an AP. Devices that are out of the range of the access point can associate with the bridge,
which will then forward the traffic between the devices and the AP. Some residential wireless
routers and enterprise-class APs can also be configured as repeaters. Before purchasing an AP
for this purpose, you should carefully check the user manual to make sure it meets your require-
ments. Figure 8-2 shows a WLAN with a repeater. The laptop in the figure is too far away to
connect directly to the AP. Note that the 802.11 standard protocols allow only one repeater
per AP. The same is true for home wireless routers. Note also that the repeater is not connected
to the wired Ethernet network (see also the coverage of WIDS that follows). Because the laptop
is out of range of the AP, it associates with the repeater instead. The laptop must follow all the
DCF rules to transmit to the repeater, which must also acknowledge the frames. Then the
repeater must go through the same process to forward the frames it receives from the laptop to
the AP. The process is reversed when the AP transmits frames to the laptop.

Wireless repeaters are also available as stand-alone devices. In the
consumer market, they are usually called Wi-Fi signal boosters or
extenders.
Network designers should be aware of the extra delay introduced by a repeater in a WLAN.
Certain kinds of business applications that connect to databases in client-server mode
might not be able to tolerate the additional transmission delay, which could result in
application issues. You also need to remember that this increased delay reduces the overall
throughput of the link even further than if the laptop was communicating directly with the AP.
This means that in a WLAN operating at a data rate of 300 Mbps, the maximum throughput
will normally be about 150 Mbps or less. When you add a repeater to the WLAN, the through-
put will be reduced by half again to about 75 Mbps due to the additional overhead.
Some APs and wireless routers (wireless residential gateways) can also be configured to
extend the range of a WLAN. This feature is called Wireless Distribution System (WDS),
and it allows APs and wireless routers to communicate with each other without an
Ethernet wired infrastructure. Devices can connect wirelessly to the WDS APs or routers
that are not connected to the wired infrastructure, or they can use Ethernet cables as well.
The WDS APs or routers act as repeaters or bridges, but also allow wired connections to cli-
ent devices.

less router such as the ASUS RT-AC68U. Download the PDF of the
manual, open it, and search for WDS to get an overview of how to
configure a WLAN with WDS.
Wireless Controllers
When a large number of APs need to be deployed throughout a building or campus, manag-
ing the WLAN by managing each individual device becomes a challenge. Configuration set-
tings can be distributed and administered remotely, but problems such as wireless connectivity
and hardware failures usually demand that a technician be sent to the location—an expensive
way to provide support.
In addition, APs often need to be deployed in branch offices, which increases support delays
and cost when no technicians are stationed on-site. The more features an AP has, the more
complex it can be to configure and manage. Signal coverage of APs is also difficult to monitor
in remote locations.
An alternative way to simplify the management of a wireless network is to use a wireless
controller. Wireless controllers include most of the functionality of an AP and include
switch ports that can be used to connect to less complex APs. With a few exceptions, wireless
controllers do not usually have any Wi-Fi radios. In the case of remote office locations,
the controllers connect to the remote APs via a logical OSI Layer 2 or Layer 3 network
connection. The simplified APs, usually called lightweight APs (LWAPs), consist of PHY-layer
devices (radios) with some MAC-layer functionality. The wireless controller handles the interface
and communications with the wired LAN and most of the MAC-layer functionality.
Using a wireless controller and LWAPs, the management of a WLAN can be effectively central-
ized. The administrator configures the WLAN on the wireless controller, including the para-
meters of the radios, and the configuration is then pushed to the APs automatically. If an AP
fails, the controller can be configured to adjust the transmit power on two other nearby APs to
restore Wi-Fi coverage to the area previously served by the failed AP. Extra APs can be set up
as monitoring devices to detect the presence of unauthorized APs, as well as to monitor the qual-
ity of the wireless signals, and even to detect possible WLAN intrusions and security attacks.
Quality-of-service (QoS) features incorporated into the wireless controllers can make it easier
to deploy Voice over WLAN (VoWLAN), transmitting voice calls on WLANs. Wireless con-
trollers can greatly simplify the deployment and continuous management of large WLANs.
A new breed of controllers, consisting of cloud-based software that is used to configure and
manage the WLANs, employs APs that handle all of the MAC-layer functionality and forward
traffic directly to the wired network, without involving the software-based controllers. These
products make it very easy and simple to deploy and manage a WLAN.
For additional information on wireless controllers, see www.cisco.com,
www.arubanetworks.com, and meraki.cisco.com and search for
their wireless products. Meraki is among a few WLAN equipment
manufacturers that do not make a hardware-based controller.
Instead, its APs are managed exclusively over the Internet, using
cloud-based software controllers.

WLAN Design Considerations
When designing and deploying enterprise WLANs, there are some considerations that must be
taken into account. As discussed earlier, the size of the office or campus, the number of APs,
security aspects, etc., must be taken into account. The design of enterprise networks usually
follows a hierarchical structure including the core layer that includes servers and the main
Internet connection, a distribution layer that functions as the main interconnection for all net-
working nodes, and finally the access layer where the switches, APs, user computers, and
wireless devices reside. Figure 8-3 shows a hierarchical network design. Note the APs at the
access layer, connected to switches that are also wireless controllers, and the wireless devices
that communicate with the APs.

Bridged connections between buildings are normally treated as a distribution layer technology.
The limited data throughput and range of a Wi-Fi WLAN means that this technology would
never be deployed at the core layer, the backbone of a network that usually employs fiber-
optic technology to support very high data throughput.
The diagram in Figure 8-3 shows an example of an access layer network diagram using wireless
controllers and LWAPs. Note the branch office connection, using wireless controllers and
LWAPs. These are managed by the controller located at the head office, through the distribution
layer. The connection to the branch offices can be made via dedicated communications lines or
via the Internet using a VPN (see the section on VPN later in the chapter). Remote, branch office
APs can also be managed using a cloud-based controller, if compatible.
Wi-Fi Direct
Although it has been possible to set up an ad hoc Wi-Fi network since the introduction of the
802.11 standard, configuring laptops, smartphones, printers, or other devices to connect to
the WLAN has always required a certain amount of technical skill. This is true in spite of
Windows Zero Configuration, Universal Plug and Play, WDS, and other methods that were
created in an attempt to simplify configuration tasks for users.
Wi-Fi Direct is a Wi-Fi Alliance specification intended to make it simpler and more convenient
for end users to share printers, share files, synchronize devices, play networked games, and
display video and picture camera images and information without the need to join a WLAN
in a home, hotspot, or office. With Wi-Fi Direct, devices can connect to each other at the
press of a button, or by touching two devices that are near field communication (NFC) capa-
ble, as well as by entering a PIN number to automatically configure and connect two devices
in peer-to-peer or ad hoc mode. Wi-Fi Direct employs a pre-defined set of configuration para-
meters, including security, and pre-defined services, depending on the type of device, that lets
users “discover” other capable devices and eliminates the need to manually configure a con-
nection between the two. With Wi-Fi Direct, a connection between two compatible devices
can be established even when there is not a wireless router or AP.
Many new photo and video cameras, as well as several other types of devices, now include
Wi-Fi Direct and make it quite simple for users to connect them to their smartphones or
tablets, wherever they may be. In photo and video cameras, this feature allows users to view
the image that the camera will produce, control the camera, and shoot remotely.
WLANs and Multimedia Distribution
The explosive growth in the WLAN market originally spawned a new range of software and
equipment for media distribution in the wirelessly connected home, such as PCs that were
dedicated to playing media. High-speed and higher-capacity WLAN standards, coupled with
the WMM specification from the Wi-Fi Alliance, have made many of the products created
specifically for distributing media or connecting computers and media projectors unnecessary.
Instead of dedicated standards, media player devices like Apple TV, Western Digital WDTV,
Roku, Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire, and others simply take advantage of an existing
WLAN to accomplish the same task. This section looks at a previous standard and a couple

of specifications developed to support multimedia distribution, compares them, and looks at
what might happen as a result of the development of the recent IEEE 802.11ad standard.
IEEE 802.15.3c
IEEE 802.15.3c is an amendment to the 802.15.3-2003 personal area network standard. The
original standard specified operation in the 2.4 GHz band and the amendment, introduced in
2009, was developed to support high-rate transmissions for multimedia distribution in
homes, businesses, hotels, conference centers, etc. The amendment defines operation in the
60 GHz band and includes support for:
●
Superframe operation
●
Contention access periods to allow devices to connect and communicate on the PAN
●
Guaranteed time slots that allow video and audio transmissions to be prioritized
●
Omnidirectional and quasi-omnidirectional transmission using beamforming in the
60 GHz band, to increase the gain at the receiver, and enhance the range
●
Frame aggregation to support high-throughput transmission in the 60 GHz band
●
Channel probing to allow devices to determine the best modulation and coding (MCS)
to be used under the current RF channel condition
Since 2003, two industry associations were formed by several well-known manufacturers of
TVs, video, and audio equipment. These organizations created specifications for transmitting
HDMI audio and video signals wirelessly to a compatible device.
The WirelessHD specification transmits video and audio on the 60 GHz band and has a
range of 30 feet (10 meters). Some add-on equipment is available in both the business and
consumer markets that support the WirelessHD and WHDI (discussed below) specifications,
but although many of the same TV and audio manufacturers are members of the organiza-
tions that are behind these technologies, their market penetration has been limited, so far.
To date two models of Dell Alienware laptops have been produced and sold that incorporate
WirelessHD interfaces. In addition to the laptop, users must also purchase a receiver device
to connect to their TV sets in order to play PC games using a wireless connection to large
TV screens or monitors. Dell also offers a dock for PCs or laptops that allows wireless con-
nection to desktop monitors. The Wireless Home Digital Interface (WHDI) association’s
specification utilizes the 5 GHz band and can transmit signals to a 1080p-compatible televi-
sion from laptops or desktop PCs, game consoles, and even mobile devices with a maximum
range of 100 feet (30 meters). Neither of these technologies is compatible with 802.11.

You can view videos about some WHDI devices available on the mar-
ket today, on the main page of the WHDI organization website at

As you learned in Chapter 7, the IEEE introduced the 802.11ad amendment, along with the
Wi-Fi Alliance’s specifications, which make it possible for devices to switch seamlessly
between 60 GHz and the 5 GHz bands using 802.11ac, when transmission at the higher-
frequency band is not possible due to obstacles or distance. This feature of 802.11ad is likely
to eventually make WirelessHD and WHDI equipment redundant, but this might not happen
until 802.11ad is included with video monitors and business audio equipment. In the mean-
time, WHDI and Wireless HD equipment will likely continue to be available as upgrades to
audio and video devices. In the future, it appears to make more sense for everyone to stan-
dardize on 802.11ac/ad. A few manufacturers already provide residential wireless routers
and laptops with 802.11ad-compatible wireless NICs.
WLAN Security
No discussion of WLANs would be complete without considering the topic of security. Broad-
casting network traffic over EM waves has created an entirely new set of issues for keeping
data transmissions secure. It is no secret to IT professionals that the security provisions of the
original IEEE 802.11 standard were seriously flawed and, as a result, businesses were initially
reluctant to deploy WLANs. The security measures originally defined in 802.11 were “bro-
ken” within a matter of minutes. Since then, both the IEEE and Wi-Fi Alliance have done a
lot of work to improve the security of WLANs, and it has improved to the point where
WLANs are widely deployed in businesses everywhere today.
Because the 802.11 standard defines how data is transmitted at the PHY and MAC layers,
the security implementations are similar to those used in an Ethernet network. However,
because WLAN transmissions utilize a medium (EM waves) that is not confined to wires,
information transmitted on a WLAN is far more exposed to intrusion, jamming, and
hijacking.
No security measure can prevent all potential breaches. Security must always be viewed as
a work in progress and be constantly monitored. Network administrators must check sys-
tems and logs regularly to ensure that security has not been compromised. For example, a
user who frequently travels with a laptop computer often needs to configure his system to
connect to other WLANs. Some types of unsecured connections, such as hotspots, can
expose a company’s LAN or WLAN to security attacks and breaches unless certain mea-
sures are taken to prevent this and protect the company. In addition to discussing security
concepts, this section provides an introduction to some common types of network attacks
as well as measures that have been engineered by the IEEE and Wi-Fi Alliance to improve
WLAN security.
The IEEE 802.11 standard defines several steps for securing WLANs, along with support for
keeping data private through the use of encryption.
Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying that the devices have permission to access the
WLAN or the wired network through an AP. The authentication process only verifies that
the device is allowed to access the wired network via the AP. A wireless device only

“knows” that it is connecting to a WLAN using the SSID and password provided by the
user, but it cannot determine if the AP is actually part of the enterprise WLAN; in other
words, it could be a rogue AP set up by an unscrupulous person to impersonate the correct
WLAN (more on this in the 802.11i section later in the chapter).
In a BSS or ESS, a device can be configured with the SSID of the WLAN, or in most cases, a
user can simply select the SSID from a list because, by default, APs automatically transmit the
SSID of the WLAN in every beacon frame. The SSID of a WLAN is also included in beacon
frames transmitted in an ad hoc WLAN.
An administrator can configure the APs to “hide” (not transmit) the SSID in beacon
frames. However, if an AP receives a probe request frame from an active scanning device,
the 802.11 standard specifies that the AP must send a probe response frame that includes
the SSID of the WLAN.
Data Privacy
Privacy is different from authentication. Authentication ensures that the device has permis-
sion to be part of the network. Privacy is part of a group of processes that attempts to ensure
that unauthorized persons who may be able to capture the wireless transmissions will not be
able to decode and understand the data. This is accomplished with encryption, which scram-
bles the data, according to complex mathematical formulas, in a way that it cannot be read.
The data can only be decoded (unencrypted) by the intended recipient device, which also has
access to an encryption key and can decode the message. The strength of encryption rests not
only on keeping the keys secret but also with the length of the key itself. The longer the key,
the stronger the encryption, because longer keys are more difficult to break. The trade-off is
that stronger encryption increases the number of bits of data transmitted, which in turn
decreases the overall throughput of the WLAN.
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was the only optional encryption feature introduced in
the 802.11-1997 standard. WEP was used to encrypt the data between wireless devices to
prevent eavesdropping. WEP encryption is a shared key that must be entered on the AP
and all devices allowed to connect to the WLAN, and WEP encryption comes in two ver-
sions: 64-bit encryption and 128-bit encryption. The former uses a 40-bit key (5 bytes or
10 hexadecimal digits) plus a 24-bit initialization vector (IV), which is part of the encryp-
tion key, but is transmitted as clear text (unencrypted) before the encrypted data. Likewise,
the 128-bit encryption uses a 104-bit key plus a 24-bit IV. Some vendors offered 256-bit
encryption, which was not part of the 802.11 standard, and could cause compatibility
issues among equipment from different manufacturers. Even 256-bit encryption still used
the same 24-bit IV.
In 2001, researchers at various universities outlined just how an attacker could collect
the necessary data for breaking WEP encryption. By late 2001, they were able to
“break” the 128-bit WEP key used in a WLAN transmission in less than 2 hours. In
2005, the time to break WEP encryption was reduced to less than 2 minutes when the
attacker was able to capture around 200,000 frames. WEP uses a weak implementation
of an encryption algorithm (RC4) that was developed by Ron Rivest for RSA Data Secu-
rity, Inc.; except in the case of some older home networks, it should not be used today to
secure any WLAN.

Some manufacturers designed their equipment to use up to four different WEP keys, which
could be rotated regularly, based on a timer, depending on certain configuration parameters,
but this was also considered very weak security.
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is a standard for encryption introduced by the Wi-Fi Alliance
in response to the weaknesses of WEP. WPA uses a 128-bit pre-shared key (PSK), also
known as WPA Personal, which needs to be manually added to the configuration of every
device that will be connected to the WLAN. Unlike WEP, WPA-PSK uses a different encryp-
tion key for each client device, for each packet, and for each communications session.
WPA-PSK is not suitable for larger companies with many client devices because the pass-
phrase has to be created by the user and manually entered on both the AP and devices.
Strong passphrases should be longer than 8 bytes and should include a mixture of letters,
numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters. The passphrase is used by the hardware to gen-
erate an encryption key. This key is rotated, based on a user-configurable timer that is often
set to 300 seconds (5 minutes) by manufacturers. This mode does not offer the same level of
protection as enterprise-class systems that rely on an authentication server installed some-
where else on the network.
WPA employs the temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP), which provides per-packet and
per-session key-mixing; in other words, each packet and each webpage requested uses a differ-
ent security key for encryption. In addition, TKIP also includes message integrity check
(MIC), which uses a combination of variable and static data items, such as the current net-
work uptime (not based on current clock time) and other data items, to ensure that the
encrypted data has not been tampered with. With WEP, it was possible to intercept a frame
and tamper (or change) the encrypted data to serve the needs of an attacker, with little possi-
bility of detection. MIC verifies that an attacker has not modified the data sent by the source
device.
TKIP uses a 48-bit hashed (scrambled) initialization vector, and WPA also includes the meth-
ods necessary for the AP to change the keys and transmit the new key to all client devices.
WPA2 is an enhancement to WPA that can use much stronger encryption. The IEEE also cer-
tified WPA2 as compatible with IEEE 802.11i, which is described in the next section. Both
add support for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), established by the U.S. National
Institute of Standards and Technology in 2001, to meet the U.S. government security require-
ments. However, because AES requires additional processing power, it often cannot be sup-
ported by older, slower WLAN hardware. When using AES encryption, TKIP is not used.
The Wi-Fi Alliance has certification programs for WPA and WPA2.
Vendors use these programs to verify that their equipment complies
with these security methods and to ensure that it will interoperate
with equipment from other vendors.
Introduction to Enterprise WLAN Security
The IEEE 802.11i amendment, ratified in June 2004, was the result of a series of efforts by
the IEEE to deal with the security weaknesses of the original WLAN standard. 802.11i is a
grouping of several security functions that protects WLAN data frames by providing mutual
authentication between wireless devices and access points, controlled access to the network,

establishment of security keys, and key management. Together with 802.1X, a series of
recommendations for implementation of a grouping of security functions, 802.11i defines a
Robust Security Network Association (RSNA), which is the end result of using the 802.1X
recommendations and 802.11i amendment to secure an enterprise WLAN. Full coverage
of 802.11i and 802.1X is a topic for advanced security courses and is beyond the scope
of this text.
802.1X is part of the IEEE 802.1 group of network standards and
applies to wired as well as wireless networks. However, 802.1X is
not an amendment to any standard; it is a set of recommendations
for implementation of RSNA.
In 802.11i, a client device must be authenticated on the network by an external authenti-
cation server—such as a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS), a popular
method of authenticating users on a network—before completing its association with an
AP. Some APs offer an option to authenticate devices on the AP itself, using an internal
RADIUS server, but this is not considered as secure as using an external server. All com-
munications between the mobile device and the wired network are blocked until the
authentication process is completed, after which data protection through encryption and
MIC are enabled. Only then communication between the wireless devices and the wired
network is allowed. Figure 8-4 shows a diagram of a typical network employing an exter-
nal RADIUS authentication server.

RADIUS software is available from many different vendors and also in
a free version called FreeRADIUS. The “Dial-In” portion of RADIUS
is a holdover from the old telephone line modem days. RADIUS is
applicable to wired as well as wireless networks. FreeRADIUS is avail-
able for download from many Internet sites and is supported by a
variety of networking devices, including APs, wireless routers, and so on.
802.1X uses the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) for relaying access requests
between a wireless device, the AP, and the RADIUS server. There are several variations of
EAP, each supporting a different authentication method and its associated network-security
policies. For EAP to work, all three devices must support the same authentication method.
When EAP is used, the network administrator does not need to configure a WPA passphrase
or WEP key in each computer or device. The RADIUS server provides the key to the AP,
which then provides it to the wireless devices. This saves configuration effort and time both
initially and when the key is periodically changed. This method of authentication also indi-
rectly verifies to the client device that it is communicating with an authorized AP, instead of
a hacker’s computer impersonating an enterprise AP.
Wi-Fi Protected Setup (Push-Button Wireless Security)
Because many home users who install wireless networks fail to set up proper security, leaving
their networks exposed to potential attackers, most vendors today implement a method spec-
ified by the Wi-Fi Alliance of securely connecting mobile devices to wireless residential rou-
ters. Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) simplifies the process of securing a WLAN for nontechni-
cal users. Although each vendor’s method may have a different name or acronym, all of them
provide either a physical button on the front panel of the wireless router or a graphical
software-defined button in the configuration software that can automatically configure the
security settings in both the wireless router and the mobile device called WPS. Keep in mind
that to take advantage of this type of push-button wireless security, both the wireless NIC
and the AP or router must support the feature. The button needs to be activated once on
each router, and once on each mobile device, one at a time. The feature transfers the security
key to the wireless NIC, then automatically establishes a connection with the wireless device.
If you are using wireless NICs and gateways from different vendors, check first to make sure
this feature is compatible.
Virtual Private Networks
Virtual private networks (VPNs) use specialized protocols that create a virtual “tunnel”
between two points across a public network such as the Internet. Packets from each network
are encrypted and encapsulated in VPN PDUs that can only be unencapsulated and decrypted
at the destination network, hence the virtual “tunnel” concept. VPNs use strong encryption
algorithms such as AES and are the most secure method that can be used to access a corpo-
rate network from a remote location.
There are basically two types of VPN implementation:
●
Site-to-site VPNs are used to interconnect two LANs across a public network. This
type of connection is typically set up between two company routers to interconnect the

main office with a branch and remains in place indefinitely. Encryption is almost
always done by dedicated hardware in the routers.
●
Client-to-site VPNs are temporary connections from a remote office or from a public
network such as a hotspot, using mobile devices. In this type of VPN, encryption is
usually done by the VPN software running on the devices.
Security specialists and VPN users must keep in mind that encryption in client-to-site VPNs
tends to consume a large amount of processing resources; therefore, certain time-sensitive
client-server applications might not perform acceptably in a VPN environment. Most public
wireless networks are not secured at all, and using them can expose corporate data to an
attacker—such as emails and application data, including customer information—if the data
is not encrypted. In fact, if VPNs are not implemented properly, the entire corporate network
can be exposed to attacks.
Full coverage of VPNs, protocols, and techniques is beyond the scope
of this text. For more information on VPNs, start with this Wikipedia
article: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network.
Figure 8-5 shows a diagram of the two basic types of VPNs.

Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention
Most business networks implement one or more methods of detecting when an intruder
attempts to “hack” into their wireless networks. A Wireless Intrusion Prevention System
(WIPS) is a stand-alone wireless device or a feature of some advanced APs that can be
deployed to monitor the RF spectrum and detect the presence of unauthorized APs. For
example, a company employee can purchase a consumer-type wireless router and connect it
to the wired network, hidden from view. Because such consumer devices cannot be set up
by the employee to use the company’s authentication server, they can expose the wired net-
work to security attacks. When a WIPS detects an unauthorized wireless router, it can be
configured to automatically force wireless devices to disconnect from the unauthorized router
or AP, rendering it useless.
A Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS) differs from WIPS in that it sends a notifica-
tion to system administrators, instead of acting automatically when it detects an intrusion. It
is then up to the WLAN administrator to locate and remove the unauthorized AP using other
types of wireless networking tools.
Additional WLAN Security Tactics
In addition to the security strategies discussed in the previous section, you can increase
WLAN security by reducing WLAN transmission power. However, keep in mind that an
attacker equipped with a high-gain directional antenna would still be able to detect the RF
signal. Changing the default security settings on the APs is probably the first and most
important step in WLAN security. Don’t forget antivirus and antispyware software. Mobile
wireless clients are exposed to more of these threats when operating outside company offices
and can introduce those threats into your corporate network once they are connected to the
office wired network again.
For highly secure WLANs, administrators usually separate WLAN traffic from wired net-
work traffic by placing a firewall between the WLAN and the wired LAN and use virtual
local area networks (VLANs) to redirect traffic from the WLAN to the wired network via
the firewall. This is especially important in corporate networks if you allow guest wireless
devices to connect to your WLAN for Internet access.
Attacks Against WLANs
A variety of attacks can be employed against WLANs. Some of the more dangerous are hard-
ware loss or theft, AP impersonation, passive monitoring, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
The theft or loss of a mobile device is one example of a serious threat, because such devices
are often configured to automatically connect to the corporate WLAN. Whoever ends up
with the device might be able to use it to gain access to the corporate network and
resources.
AP impersonation takes advantage of a problem with legacy 802.11 WLANs, which is that
devices authenticate themselves with the APs, but unless an external authentication server is
being used, devices do not know whether they are communicating with an authorized AP or
not. When a rogue AP or AP impersonation software is installed on a mobile computer, it
WLAN Security
285

can trick clients into associating with it, allowing information from the devices to be
monitored and allowing attempts to break the security keys. AP impersonation software on
a laptop can spoof a corporate AP’s MAC address and other parameters to make devices
“think” that they are connecting to an authorized AP. This type of attack is called
man-in-the-middle.
Passive monitoring, in which an attacker simply captures data transmissions, can also be
used to acquire information, such as the MAC and IP addresses of APs and wireless cli-
ents. Over time, the attacker can build a profile of the WLAN and may be able to use
this information to break into the network. An attacker can use a wireless sniffer to cap-
ture enough frames to decode the security key. Although this requires capturing perhaps
several million frames (depending on the type of security key used) and can consume a
huge amount of computer processing power, it can be done, especially if an attacker is tar-
geting a particular company and has plenty of time (and computer power) to spare.
Because management and control frames are not always encrypted, they can be intercepted
and important data collected to help create an attack. An attacker can, for example, use
this information to flood the network with transmissions directed at one or more devices.
This is one example of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that can effectively deny other
devices access to the WLAN. DoS attacks against WLANs can take other forms as well,
such as RF jamming of the frequency channel to prevent devices and APs from being able
to receive frames correctly.
DoS attacks and AP impersonation can be easily detected and avoided through the use of
intrusion detection and prevention equipment and software. Although this can cost thou-
sands of dollars, it can prove a worthwhile investment if the company is subject to an attack
that could end up costing a lot more in lost productivity or failure to comply with privacy
laws (in cases where information is stolen).
Using MAC Filters to Enhance Security
In addition to the earlier discussions about hiding the SSID of the WLAN, APs and resi-
dential wireless routers also offer WLAN administrators the ability to limit access to the
network by filtering the connections at the AP or wireless router based on the MAC
address, allowing only devices with specific MAC addresses to associate and authenti-
cate. Although this feature can be useful in large office areas to force devices to connect
only with specified APs to control the maximum number of devices that connect to each
AP, it is considered a weak security method because MAC addresses can be easily
spoofed using an application like Technitium MAC Address Changer for Microsoft
Windows, for example. Some manufacturers also allow an alternate MAC address to
be configured directly in the NIC driver. Both of these methods are useful for testing
and troubleshooting purposes, to enable a technician to use a single computer instead
of multiple ones.
Technitium MAC Address Changer is a free utility available for
download from several websites, or directly from technitium.com
/tmac/index.html. SMAC is another example of utility software that
can be used to change the MAC address on Windows computers.

Chapter Summary
■Wireless bridges are used to interconnect two-wired networks across distances of up to
16 miles (25 kilometers) using directional antennas. Multiple bridge connections on
the same link can be combined to increase the data rate and effective throughput.
Longer-distance connections require that the SIFS time be extended to allow the
receiving bridge to acknowledge frames without generating a timeout error at the
transmitting bridge.
■Wi-Fi range extenders or repeaters, sometimes erroneously called Wi-Fi signal boosters
in consumer devices, can extend the range of a WLAN; however, the maximum data
rate of the device or AP is effectively cut in half when communicating via a repeater,
since transmissions must follow the DCF rules.
■Wireless controllers are devices designed to simplify the implementation and manage-
ment of enterprise WLANs that use many APs. Using wireless controllers, administra-
tors can also more easily deploy VoWLAN. Lightweight APs can be connected directly
to Ethernet ports on the controller or remotely at OSI Layers 2 or 3, depending on the
manufacturer. Cloud-based software controllers, as opposed to hardware-based, make
it very easy to deploy and manage WLANs.
■WLANs are usually deployed as an access layer technology in hierarchical network
designs, but bridged connections typically fall under the distribution layer.
■Wi-Fi Direct simplifies the connection between two wireless devices, without the need
for an AP or wireless router. It can automatically configure a direct connection as well
as security settings. Wi-Fi Direct can use near field communication to configure a
direct connection to Bluetooth speakers or configure Wi-Fi between a camera and a
smartphone.
■Dedicated wireless technologies and standards have been created to distribute voice,
audio, and video in offices, homes, hotels, etc., in both the relatively quiet 5 GHz fre-
quency band, as well as in the 60 GHz band. WirelessHD and WHDI have been sup-
ported by several consumer and office equipment manufacturers, but adoption by
manufacturers and availability of equipment has been limited, so far. The introduction
of the IEEE 802.11ac and 802.11ad amendments makes it possible to distribute multi-
media using the same Wi-Fi technology that is used for home and office WLANs. The
ability to switch frequency bands automatically between 802.11ac and 802.11ad could
generate more interest and faster adoption.
■WLAN security in the original 802.11 standard was too weak to convince corpora-
tions to deploy Wi-Fi networks. Since then, the security of WLANs has been signifi-
cantly improved and now supports authentication methods that have been in use by
businesses for decades.
■Data privacy in WLANs today uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which
meets the U.S. government requirements, to prevent attackers from being able to
access user information.
■Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) makes it easy for nontechnical users to configure strong
security for residential WLANs.

■There are several types of security attacks that can create problems for WLANs. IEEE
802.11 WLANs require enhanced security measures because the signal can be captured
by a would-be attacker from anywhere nearby, without access to the physical infra-
structure. WLAN security has been greatly enhanced through the introduction of Wi-
Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2).
■WLANs can also be protected against attacks through the use of VPNs, 802.11i
authentication, and 802.1X security measures. Authentication is a process for verifying
that the user has permission to access the network and ensuring that the client device
is communicating with an authorized AP. Privacy is a collection of data-encryption
processes for ensuring that unauthorized persons do not read transmissions.
■Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS) and Wireless Intrusion Detection System
(WIDS) are methods that can be used to prevent the use of unauthorized APs and alert
WLAN administrators to a potential breach of security.

Hands-On Projects
Project 8-1
This project is intended to provide you an overview of the configuration pro-
cess and management features of a web-based soft controller and APs. Config-
uration of a hardware-based controller is very similar, but requires the pur-
chase of wireless controllers and APs.
1.
Either you or your instructor can go to meraki.cisco.com, click the DEMO link at the
top right of the page, then click Start Demo under Start Instant Demo.
2.
Running the demo requires that you register on the site. If you do not have all of the infor-
mation required to register, your instructor can register and run the demo for the class.
3.
Take this opportunity to become more familiar with the available products and write a
short, one-page report outlining your findings about using controllers to setup Wi-Fi in
an enterprise environment.
Project 8-2
This project covers the basic security configuration of an 802.11 residential
gateway. An AP would be configured in a similar way. You can do this
project using any manufacturer’s device. The brand of the equipment is not
important, because in the real world you will likely have to configure a variety of different
equipment makes and models. Although the configuration screens will be different than the
ones shown in the figures, the point of this exercise is for you to explore and understand
which configuration items to modify and how these will affect the security of the wireless
links.
The device used to create this exercise is an ASUS RT-AC68U 802.11ac compatible wire-
less residential gateway. (It is a wireless router, but we will call it a gateway from now
on, since routers are the gateways to other networks, which in the case of a home WLAN
is usually the Internet.) The gateway supports simultaneous dual-band (2.4 and 5 GHz),
and a PC running Windows 7 Professional, but virtually any type of wireless residential
gateway and PC or Mac will work. The project covers only those settings that are relevant
to security and assumes you already know (from Chapters 6 and 7) how to perform the
basic configuration steps and connect a computer with a wireless NIC to the gateway.

1.
Connect your computer to the gateway using an Ethernet cable. You should always
use a wired connection to change settings on a gateway or access point. Some of
the settings, such as security, will cause your computer to disconnect from the
wireless link until you reconfigure it to use the new settings, which can waste a
lot of time. Figure 8-6 shows a configuration page and the parameters you need
to access to configure security on the 5 GHz band. The configuration steps for the
2.4 GHz are the same.
2.
Ensure that you configured a unique SSID for each of the bands. You do not want
to have the same SSID for both, or your devices will not know which radio to use,
since they can only connect to one radio at a time. Consult with your instructor in
case there are other gateways being used in the same classroom, to make sure you
do not have duplicate SSIDs being used by someone else. Recall that the SSID is
case sensitive.

3.
The wireless security configuration can appear on a separate tab, or under a security menu
setting. Each manufacturer’s configuration user interface might be different than the screen
shown in Figure 8-5, but it is usually not difficult navigate and find what you need.
4.
Be sure to select WPA2-PSK (pre-shared key) or WPA2-Personal with AES encryption.
You can use the same key, sometimes also called a password or passphrase, for both
the 2.4 and 5 GHz radios, but you will need to configure two different connection pro-
files on your wireless devices, one for each SSID and frequency band.
5.
Once you have configured your security settings, click OK or Apply to save your set-
tings. The gateway usually reboots, which can take a minute or two, but the browser
page should open automatically after the reboot and display your new settings. Now
repeat Steps 1 through 5 for the other radio or frequency band. Note that sometimes
you can configure both radios in a single step.
6.
Configure the wireless network connection profile on one or more wireless devices to
connect to the now secure WLAN.
7.
Most gateways are able to display how many and which devices are connected to it. If
the MAC address of the devices is displayed, compare it with the MAC address of your
devices.
8.
Now you can challenge yourself and experiment with other settings, such as hiding the
SSID, deleting and trying to re-create the connection profile on your wireless devices,
and setting up MAC filters to prevent certain devices from connecting, allowing only
the devices you want to connect to the gateway.
9.
Be sure to click OK or Apply to enable any of the functionality you just changed.

demonstration for ACS, you will need to download and install the Technitium
MAC Address Changer software, and set up MAC filters on your gateway or AP
to block a certain device. You can also use the software to hide the SSID of the
WLAN, then try to capture some unprotected wireless management frames using Wireshark.
Once you have identified the SSID of the WLAN and the MAC address of at least one device
that is allowed to connect to the WLAN, in other words, one that is not being blocked by a
MAC filter, use Technitium to manually change the MAC address of your blocked device and
connect to the WLAN. Deliver a presentation to your classmates and instructor showing all of
the steps you went through to spoof the MAC address and connect to the WLAN.

By now, you understand the tremendous impact that wireless communications have
had, and will continue to have, on the world around us. Wireless networks allow users to be
connected as they move about, freeing them from cables and phone lines. However, the
WPANs and WLANs you have learned about thus far have restricted user mobility to
homes, offices, or campuses, allowing them to roam from only a few feet to a few hundred
feet from the source of the RF signal. Limits on the strength of the RF signals, mandated by
the regulatory authorities and designed to prevent interference in the unlicensed bands, are
the main reason for this restriction. Users have also been subject to line-of-sight limitations.
Therefore, except for voice communications and data over cellular networks, user mobility
has remained largely confined to homes, offices, and hotspots that offer wireless access,
which include coffee shops and airports as well as the core downtown areas of a few cities
that have deployed Wi-Fi networks.
In small towns and remote areas, the relatively small number of wireless network users
might not make it economically viable to implement hotspots and mobile access. In fact, in
areas with low user density, the cost of installing cables to provide high-speed communica-
tion channels over long distances often prevents telephone companies or small ISPs from
offering high-speed Internet access at all.
In this chapter, you learn about technologies and standards that allow wireless access to
expand beyond a few hundred feet—to connect buildings several miles apart, for example,
or to provide Internet connectivity across an entire city, where cabling infrastructure or an
extensive cellular network might not exist. The chapter begins with coverage of infrared
(IR)-based short-distance and medium-distance technologies and concludes with standards
for medium- and long-distance RF-based WMAN technologies.
What Is a WMAN?
As you learned in Chapter 1, a wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN) is a wireless
network that covers a large geographical area such as an entire city or all its suburban areas.
WMANs have two primary goals:
●
To extend the reach of existing wired networks beyond a single location without
the expense of deploying and maintaining high-speed copper or optical cable
infrastructure.
●
To extend user mobility throughout a metropolitan area. An important additional
benefit of a WMAN is that it can provide high-speed connections, including Internet,
to areas not serviced by any other method of connectivity. Such connectivity can
encompass metropolitan areas, expanding to small towns nearby, as well as to rural
areas and remote locations not usually serviced by high-speed communications lines.
Last Mile Wired Connections
A last mile connection is usually the link between an end-user and an Internet service
provider (ISP) or telephone company, but the term is sometimes used to refer to a connection
to an entire community that was not previously serviced by telecommunication lines. Even
today, most last mile connections are still based on some type of copper wiring, such as

telephone cable, or, more recently, optical fiber cables directly to users’ homes. As of April
2016, only about 25 percent of homes in the United States were directly connected to fiber
networks (See http://broadbandnow.com/Fiber), and only a very small number of office
buildings are wired for cable TV. In spite of its exceptional reliability for data communica-
tions, fiber optics is slow and expensive to install; most important of all, it is costly to main-
tain, especially in regions where the ground freezes and thaws every year, which can damage
buried cables. Figure 9-1 shows an example of an overhead-wire last mile connection.
Today, home users in large metropolitan areas can take advantage of both DSL at up to
100 Mbps and cable TV connections at up to 150 Mbps. However, these types of connections
are usually not available in small, remote communities. Business users do have a few other
options beyond basic copper wiring. However, traditional wired technologies, which offer high
data rates and are widely available in larger metropolitan areas, are typically quite expensive to
lease, costing several thousands of dollars per mile, per month. Table 9-1 summarizes some of
the traditional and historical connection options and speeds for homes, office buildings, and
Internet service providers, to provide a perspective for the remainder of this chapter.

For long-distance connections between cities and states, copper-based digital communications
lines, such as T1, require the signal to be regenerated every 6,000 feet (1.8 kilometers). In
addition to the challenges of cable installation and maintenance, regenerating the signal
requires electrical power at each repeater location. Maintenance costs for this type of connec-
tion are extremely high, especially where the geography or the environmental conditions
(e.g., mountainous or desert areas) are challenging.
Last mile delivery of telephone and data lines has long been a
problem for the carriers (i.e., the providers and operators) of the
networks, who must be able to justify the cost of installing wired
connections in remote areas. In previous chapters, you learned
that carrier refers to the RF signal that carries data. In the telecom-
munications field, the term carrier also refers to telephone, cable TV, and other
communications-provider companies that own the wires and transmission towers that carry
voice and data traffic.
Since the early 1980s, fiber-optic technology has largely replaced all other technologies for
connections between major metropolitan centers, mainly because it has a higher capacity for
carrying voice and data transmissions, lower maintenance requirements, and is much more
reliable than copper wiring. However, the higher costs of the fiber-optic medium and in-
ground installation often preclude its use in remote and less-populated areas. Fiber-optic
cables are also used to carry voice and data traffic across the world’s oceans. Submarine
fiber-optic cables span the entire globe and are laid and maintained by specialized ships and
crews. The cost of deploying and maintaining these cables is extremely high, but today our
world is heavily dependent on them for Internet and phone connectivity. For more informa-
tion, search for “submarine cable” on the web.
Last Mile Wireless Connections
Most of the technologies used in WMANs and last mile wireless connections are based on
microwave signals, but they also include infrared light. Microwaves are higher-frequency RF
waves that use the 3- to 30-GHz and 30- to 300-GHz frequency ranges of the electromag-
netic spectrum. Microwaves were introduced in the early 1950s by AT&T and the technol-
ogy brought about a new era in voice communications. Originally, microwaves were used to
transmit in point-to-point fashion. The conventional thinking in the early days was that the
lower-frequency, high-powered approach was the only way in which microwaves could be
used for communication. High-frequency microwave technology was ignored for many
years, and the section of the RF spectrum between 27.5 and 29.5 GHz went virtually
unused.
Microwave towers today are installed between 35 miles (56 kilometers) and up to 50 miles
(80 kilometers) apart from each other. A microwave link operating at 4 GHz can carry
about 1,800 voice calls simultaneously. In comparison, a T1 link can carry only 24 simulta-
neous voice calls. Improvements in microwave technology have reduced the cost of the equip-
ment and have made telephone and data communications services available in many remote

locations worldwide that were previously out of range of high-capacity, high-speed
connections.
The first transcontinental microwave link was completed in 1951, con-
necting New York and San Francisco. It used 107 towers spaced about
30 miles (48 kilometers) apart, covering a distance of about 3,200 miles
(5,140 kilometers). The same link using T1 digital copper-based lines
would require over 2,850 repeaters to regenerate the signal.
The current alternatives for WMANs and last mile connections include Free Space Optics,
microwave, cellular data (discussed in the next chapter), and WiMAX. A few legacy technol-
ogies such as Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) and Multichannel Multipoint
Distribution Service (MMDS) have been replaced, or are quickly being replaced, by other
technologies and are not discussed here. Instead, this chapter covers microwave links, which,
although not based on standards, have been and continue to be a very popular way of inter-
connecting cellular communication towers, buildings, and cities. Microwave is also used in a
host of other permanent and temporary communications infrastructure setups. The clear
advantage of wireless connections is that they can cost less, can be installed relatively quickly,
offer greater flexibility, are easier and less costly to maintain, and have better long-term reli-
ability. Using wireless as the last mile connection or to interconnect buildings is called fixed
wireless because these are permanent setups fixed in one location that do not normally sup-
port mobile users.
Fixed wireless networks have been used for several years for both voice and data communi-
cations in backhaul networks operated by telephone companies, cable TV companies, utili-
ties, railways, and government agencies. A backhaul connection is defined as a company’s
internal infrastructure connection. For example, a telephone company backhaul network
might be a connection from one central switching office to another. Cellular towers along
highways and areas where fiber connections are not available are usually interconnected
using a wireless backhaul link.
Fixed wireless systems can be used to transmit the same type of data that is sent over a wired
system. However, point-to-point long-distance microwave links, such as those employed by
telephone carriers, use high-power beams that are not always suitable or safe for use in
crowded city skylines. In addition, high-speed microwave links often use licensed frequencies
for reliability purposes, so that no one else will interfere with the connection, but the cost of
licensing is high and needs to be economically justifiable. RF spectrum availability may also
be very limited in crowded metropolitan areas.
In Chapter 8, you learned that WLAN equipment such as 802.11 wireless bridges can be set
up to connect two buildings provided the installation does not interfere with other wireless
links using the same unlicensed RF bands. Installation of longer-distance connections with
this technology—beyond the range of Wi-Fi (375 feet/114 meters)—is possible but can sel-
dom achieve the high data rates required to interconnect busy data networks. In addition
to loss of speed as the distance increases, the 802.11 standard is designed to support only a
single repeater link, which means that a maximum of three bridges can be used between two

destination points. Achieving RF line of sight between two directional antennas in metropoli-
tan areas is difficult or may not be possible due to tower height limitations, tall buildings, etc.
Additionally, the throughput of a single 802.11 frequency channel is typically only enough to
carry a limited amount of data, such as email, web browsing, and moderate file transfers,
mainly due to the half-duplex characteristic of wireless bridges. Although using multiple
bridge links to increase bandwidth can alleviate the problem, it tends to make antenna instal-
lation far more complex because you would have to align multiple pairs of directional anten-
nas instead of just one.
Baseband vs. Broadband
Another point to consider when designing wireless links is that there are two ways in
which digital signals can be transmitted over a wireless medium. The first is called broadband
transmission, in which multiple signals are simultaneously sent over the medium at different
frequencies. An example of broadband transmission is cable TV, in which multiple entertain-
ment channels are sent on a single cable. When you pick a channel to watch, the TV set filters
out all other frequencies and decodes and displays a single channel.
The second transmission mode is called baseband transmission. Baseband treats the entire
transmission medium as if it were only one channel and transmits only one data signal at a
time over a single frequency. An example of baseband transmission is Ethernet, in which
digital signals are sent over a cable. Ethernet 100BaseT, for example, refers to 100 Mbps
baseband signaling using twisted pair cabling. As you learned in Chapter 2, digital signals
use a change in voltage to represent a 1 or a 0. You can change the voltage differential
between two wires on a cable, but you cannot transmit this change over an analog medium
such as an EM wave, which is an analog medium. To transmit digital signals over an analog
medium, as you learned, you need to modulate an analog carrier wave to represent a change
between a 1 and a 0.
These examples illustrate the differences between broadband and baseband transmissions
over a cable, but keep in mind that transmissions over an analog medium (such as EM
waves) can be sent as broadband or baseband. Purely digital signals can only be transmit-
ted over a wire as baseband, because mixing multiple voltage changes on a cable would
create different bit patterns and corrupt the data, given that there is no way to separate
one signal from the other. However, if you modulate multiple digital signals over differ-
ent carrier frequencies, they can be transmitted over any analog medium. The receiver
can then separate each frequency using filters and decode each of the digital signals
individually.
Note also that there is no predefined frequency bandwidth separating baseband from broad-
band. For example, the wider the bandwidth, the more frequencies are available to transmit
separate channels of data using frequency division multiplexing. Alternatively, broadband trans-
missions can be made using time division multiplexing. Both methods can be considered broad-
band transmission. In comparison, a baseband transmission consists of only one data channel.
Figure 9-2 shows a rough conceptual comparison between baseband and broadband
transmissions.

Land-Based Fixed Broadband Wireless
The data communications industry has developed a few different solutions for last mile con-
nections over the past few decades. Some have proven too costly and were hard to justify.
Others have proved to be less than totally reliable for implementation in all locations. Some
RF-based solutions are proprietary, and some require licensed frequency bands. Until 2001,
RF-based fixed broadband systems operated at frequencies and with modulation techniques
that limited implementation to line of sight only. In addition, most fixed broadband systems
could only send from one site to another—in other words, they are set up in point-to-point
fashion. As a comparison, in cellular telephone systems, a single base station can communicate
with several mobile devices simultaneously. However, cellular technology was originally
designed to carry multiple voice conversations and not high-capacity data transmissions,
although this is changing rapidly today with the latest versions of cellular standards.
Due to the high cost of land-based communications lines from telephone and cable TV car-
riers, many companies have chosen to deploy their own building-to-building wireless connec-
tivity solutions. This section begins by describing an IR-based solution called Free Space
Optics. Later in the chapter, you will learn about IEEE 802.16 and WiMAX wireless technol-
ogies, which are in use in many fixed wireless networks and are also used for Internet connec-
tivity applications. Enhancements to the 802.16 standards also promise to help solve the chal-
lenges of user mobility and compete with DSL, cable TV, and even telephone carriers where
cabling infrastructure is not available, such as in Africa.
Free Space Optics
Free Space Optics (FSO) is an optical, wireless, point-to-point, line-of-sight broadband tech-
nology. Although it was originally developed over 30 years ago by the military, FSO has
become an excellent alternative to high-speed fiber-optic cable for shorter distances. Currently,
FSO can transmit at speeds comparable to lower-end fiber-optic transmissions, reaching up to

1.25 Gbps at a distance of 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) in full-duplex mode. Future improvements
in the technology will likely push the top speed to 10 Gbps and possibly beyond.
FSO uses infrared (IR) light transmission instead of RF. The light technology is similar to
that used with a fiber-optic cable system. A fiber-optic cable contains a very thin strand of
glass called the core, which is only as thick as a human hair. Instead of transmitting electrical
signals, fiber-optic cables use light impulses. A light source, usually created by a laser or
light-emitting diodes (LEDs), flashes a light at one end of the cable that is detected at the
receiving end. Light travels at 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second, so fiber-optic
cable systems can transmit large amounts of data at high speeds. In addition, these transmis-
sions are immune to electromagnetic interference and cannot be easily intercepted without
breaking the cable, which makes them relatively secure.
FSO is an alternative to fiber-optic cables. Sometimes called “fiberless optical,” FSO does not
use a medium, like a fiber-optic cable, to send and receive signals. Instead, low-powered
invisible infrared beams carry the data. These beams, which do not harm the human eye,
are generated by transceivers, as shown in Figure 9-3. Because FSO is a line-of-sight technol-
ogy, the transceivers are mounted in the middle or upper floors of office buildings to provide
a clear transmission path. However, unlike other technologies that require the units to be
located on an open roof (which sometimes requires leasing roof space from the building’s
owner), FSO transceivers can even be mounted behind a window in an existing office.

Under perfect conditions, such as environments free of fog, dust,
and high heat and humidity, FSO can transmit at distances of up to
6.2 miles (10 kilometers).
Recall that the lower-frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is the area in which
RF EM waves travel. IR waves fall into the area above 300 GHz. FSO uses the invisible light
part of this spectrum region. The only limitation on its use is that the radiated power must
not exceed specific limits in order to avoid harming the human eye.
FSO equipment works at either of two wavelengths. A single world-
wide wavelength will likely be standardized for these devices.
Advantages of FSO The advantages of FSO include lower cost, speed of installation,
transmission rate, and security.
FSO installations cost significantly less than installing new fiber-optic cables or even leasing
lines from a local carrier. One recent project compared the costs of installing fiber-optic
cables to FSO to interconnect three buildings. The cost to install the fiber-optic cables was
almost $400,000, compared to less than $60,000 for FSO.
FSO can be installed in days, compared to months—or sometimes years—for fiber-optic
cables, which require a series of permits from city authorities, whether installed under-
ground or strung along lampposts. In some instances, installers can set up FSO systems
over a weekend without disrupting the users.
The transmission speed for FSO can be scaled to meet users’ needs—anywhere from
10 Mbps to 1.25 Gbps.
Security is a key advantage in an FSO system. IR transmissions cannot be as easily inter-
cepted and decoded as some RF transmissions.
Disadvantages of FSO The primary disadvantage of FSO is that atmospheric condi-
tions can have an impact on FSO transmissions. Scintillation is the temporal and spatial var-
iation in light intensity caused by atmospheric turbulence. Turbulence caused by wind and
temperature variations can create pockets of air with rapidly changing densities. These air
pockets can act like prisms and lenses that distort an FSO signal. Inclement weather is also
a threat. Although rain and snow can distort a signal, fog does the most damage to light-
based transmissions. Fog is composed of extremely small moisture particles that act like
prisms, scattering and breaking up the light beams.
Scintillation is readily observed in the twinkling of stars in the night
sky and the shimmering “mirage” effect that you see in the distance
on the surface of a road on a hot sunny day.

FSO overcomes scintillation by sending the data in parallel streams from several separate
laser transmitters. These transmitters are all mounted in the same transceiver but are sepa-
rated from one another in such a way it is unlikely that while traveling between the trans-
mitter and the receiver, all the parallel beams will encounter the same pocket of turbulence,
given that scintillation pockets are usually quite small. At least one of the beams will arrive
at the target node with adequate strength to be properly received. This solution is called
spatial diversity because it exploits multiple regions of air space. An example of spatial
diversity is shown in Figure 9-4, with parallel light beams coming from an FSO transmitter.
In dealing with fog, there are several potential solutions. One solution is simply to increase
the transmit power of the signal (the intensity of the light). In regions of heavy and frequent
fog, it may be necessary to choose FSO systems that transmit at the highest available fre-
quency because these devices can also emit light at higher power levels. Several vendors
also claim to customize their distance and product recommendations based on weather sta-
tistics for particular cities. Some vendors use a backup connection with FSO to ensure that
transmissions go through in foggy weather.
In order to prove that FSO can send transmissions through fog, one
vendor ran trials in some of the foggiest cities in the United States.
In San Francisco, one of the worst cities in the country for fog, one
vendor has proven that FSO can maintain carrier-class transmission
speeds (1.25 Gbps) over 90 percent of the time.
Some experts recommend that the distance between FSO transceivers in regions of heavy
and frequent fog should be limited to 650 to 1,640 feet (200 to 500 meters).

Signal interference can also be a problem for FSO, such as when birds fly through the IR
beam and block it. If the signal is temporarily blocked, the beam automatically reduces its
power, then raises itself to full power when the obstruction clears the beam’s path.
Another potential problem is that storms and earthquakes can cause tall buildings to move
enough to affect the aim of the beam. This problem can be handled in two ways. In the
first method, known as “beam divergence,” the transmitted beam is purposely allowed to
spread, or diverge, so that by the time it arrives at the receiving device, it forms a fairly
large optical cone. If the receiver is initially positioned at the center of the beam, divergence
can compensate for any movement of the building. The second method, known as “active
tracking,” is based on movable mirrors that are controlled by gyroscopes that, in turn, con-
trol the direction in which the beams are sent. A feedback mechanism continuously adjusts
the mirrors so that the beams stay on target.
FSO Applications There are a variety of applications for FSO. More common ones
include:
●
Last mile connections—FSO can be used in high-speed links that connect end-users
with Internet service providers or other networks.
●
LAN connections—FSO devices are easily installed, making them a natural
solution for interconnecting LAN segments that are housed in buildings separated
by public streets or other obstacles, such as in a university campus spanning
several city blocks.
●
Fiber-optic backup—FSO can be deployed in redundant links to back up fiber-optic
cables in case of a break in the cable.
●
Backhaul—FSO can be used to carry cellular telephone traffic from antenna towers
back to facilities wired to carrier-provided high-speed communications lines.
Most experts agree that FSO holds great potential for fixed wireless communications as well
as for other wireless applications. In spite of other technology advances, FSO has remained
a stable player in the wireless field to this day.
Microwave Wireless Links
As indicated at the beginning of this chapter, microwave is a group of wireless technologies
that, although not based on standards such as those from IEEE, is a very common way of
interconnecting buildings, cellular towers, intercity telephone networks, and so on. Micro-
waves are essentially EM waves, but the “micro” in microwave is not meant to imply that
the wavelength is in the micrometer range. It is simply meant to suggest that the wavelength
is smaller than the wavelength of radio waves that were common at the time microwave
technology began to be installed. AM broadcast radio stations at the time operated, and
still do, mostly in the 535- to 1,605-KHz range, which have wavelengths varying from
approximately 1,839 feet (561 meters) to 613 feet (187 meters), respectively. Microwaves
have been used to transmit telephone calls (voice), since the mid- to late 1950s across
North America and can operate in the range of 300 MHz to 300 GHz, which have wave-
lengths ranging from 3.28 feet (1 meter) to 0.00328 feet (0.001 meters or 1 millimeter).
Microwave transceivers today operate on a variety of frequency bands, from the ISM
5.8 GHz up to 80 GHz.

Permanent Microwave Links Most microwave links installed by carriers today are
point-to-point line-of-sight, permanent links that typically operate in the 18 GHz licensed fre-
quency band. This helps carriers to avoid potential interference and ensure the reliability of
their networks. Because of the lack of standardization and interoperability testing, such as the
ones conducted by the Wi-Fi Alliance, each carrier’s link must use equipment from the same
vendor. Data rates can range up to 2 Gbps for single transmitters to 4 Gbps for aggregated
transmitter setups (two transmitters) and use between 256- and 1,024-QAM modulation with
parabolic dish antennas, which are highly directional and very high gain, as you learned in
Chapter 4. Carrier microwave links use frequency division duplexing (FDD), transmitting on
one frequency and receiving on another, for full-duplex operation, and practically all micro-
wave links in use today carry 100 percent IP traffic. Orthogonal frequency division multiplex-
ing (OFDM) encoding is also used to transmit more than one data channel simultaneously,
which means that these links are broadband communications channels. Non-carrier, private
microwave links typically transmit in many different frequency bands from 24 to 80 GHz.
In the past, microwave transmitters were large and needed to be installed on the ground at
the base of communications towers, with waveguides, rectangular cavity metal tubes that
carried the transmitter signal from the ground to the antennas installed high up in the trans-
mission towers. With either copper antenna cables or waveguides, the main issue was the
signal loss between the transmitters and antennas. Today the transmitters are very compact
and are installed on the towers right next to the antennas, which minimizes or eliminates
signal loss, and some products are available with integrated dish antennas. Figure 9-5
shows an example of a compact microwave transmitter. Some products are also available

as a split-architecture with the data circuits installed at the bottom of the tower and the
radios installed on the tower, next to the antenna.
Many businesses also use compact microwave equipment working in the unlicensed 60 and
80 GHz bands to deploy private high-speed links. In one example, a college campus wanted
to interconnect five buildings, two of which were across a public street. The college originally
leased fiber-optic lines from a local utility, but because of the location, the optical lines ran
from one side of the street to the downtown core and back from the downtown core to the
other side of the street. The total length of the leased fiber-optic lines was approximately
5 miles (8 kilometers) and the cost of the 1 Gbps link was about $8,000 per month. The col-
lege looked at the maximum data rates required to interconnect the buildings, then decided
to install two separate 66 Mbps links, one to each building across the street, at a cost of
approximately $60,000 to link the wired and Wi-Fi networks in the two buildings across the
street to the main data center, to support both data and VoIP. This meant that the cost of the
wireless links was paid for in just over seven months when compared to the leased optical lines.
Gas and oil companies frequently deploy private links from drilling and production sites to
the head offices of companies to provide real-time, high-speed access to information. These
sites are often located in remote areas where the environment is quite harsh or on ocean
platforms where wired infrastructure is not available and the data rates provided by satellite
links or other means are simply not good enough.
You can watch some videos about wireless technology in oilfields
and other remote locations at this link: http://rdlcom.com/videos.
Temporary Links Microwave equipment is currently available to support temporary
installations in, for example, sports venues such as the Olympic Games or the Pan American
Games. These mobile links typically use the 5.8 GHz ISM band and create small microwave
“cells” that can be used to transmit multiple 100 to 200 Mbps, non-line of sight to each of
three other points (point-to-multipoint), or to a single point with an aggregate data rate of
up to 600 Mbps. These links use smart antennas, beamforming, time division duplexing
(defined below), and OFDM with subcarrier modulations of 128- and 256-QAM.
IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX)
IEEE 802.16 is an open-standard, broadband MAN technology that can work in either line-
of-sight or non-line-of-sight mode, depending on the frequency used, and is designed to sup-
port a large variety of fixed or mobile digital data communications services for MANs. The
term WiMAX stands for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access. The IEEE intro-
duced 802.16 in 2000, with the goal of standardizing fixed broadband wireless connections
as an alternative to wired access networks such as fiber-optic links, cable TV modems, and
DSL. IEEE 802.16 supports enhancements and extensions to the MAC protocols so that it is
possible for a base station (BS) (the transmitter connected to the carrier network or to the
Internet) to communicate with another BS as well as directly with subscriber stations (SSs),
which can be either a laptop computer or a device that attaches to a LAN. FSO cannot sup-
port mobile communications because of its directional requirements.

Figure 9-6 shows a WiMAX lab setup that includes two BS controllers (top) and four SSs
(bottom). Each two SSs in the photo are connected to one of the BS radios (middle, vertical).
The flat areas in the front of the SSs are integrated antennas. The SSs in the photo are nor-
mally installed on the outside wall of a house or building facing the antenna of the nearest
BS. For safety reasons, the lab equipment is interconnected using cables and attenuators,
instead of antennas, because of the high-power RF signals.
In January 2006, Samsung introduced a laptop computer and mobile
telephone handset that were both 802.16-compliant. Several other
PC manufacturers followed shortly after by offering built-in WiMAX
connectivity options in their mobile device product lines.
A group of manufacturers established the WiMAX Forum (see www.wimaxforum.org) in
June 2001 to promote the implementation of 802.16 by testing and certifying equipment for
compatibility and interoperability. The IEEE 802.16 standard offers multiple RF interfaces
(PHY layers), depending on the frequencies used and associated regulations for different coun-
tries, but they are all based on a common MAC protocol.

Just as the 802.11 standards became popularly known as Wi-Fi based
on the name of the industry organization, so the 802.16 standard
has become popularly known as WiMAX based on the forum name.
South Korea was one of the first countries to implement wireless
broadband networks based on the nation’s WiBro standard. The
IEEE subsequently made the 802.16 standard fully compatible with
the Korean standard.
WiMAX Applications
With data rates of up to 70 Mbps in the 2 to 11 GHz bands and up to 120 Mbps at short
distances in the 10 to 66 GHz bands, WiMAX is suitable for backhaul business applications
as well as last mile delivery applications that replace T1, DSL, and cable TV modems for
Internet connectivity. WiMAX can support simultaneous voice, video, and data transmission
with QoS. This makes it particularly suitable for voice-over-IP (VoIP) connections, which has
enabled small companies to enter the telecommunications market and compete with major
carriers in providing telephone services to consumers in infrastructure-poor areas of the
world. The convergence of voice, video, and data on IP networks is what the industry calls
triple play.
WiMAX enables vendors to create many different types of products, including various con-
figurations of base stations and customer premises equipment (CPE), which are the devices
that are installed in a customer’s office or home. In addition to supporting the point-
to-multipoint applications just mentioned, WiMAX can be deployed as a point-to-point net-
work to provide broadband access to rural and remote areas.
Search for “WiMAX CPE” and “WiMAX base station” to locate
WiMAX product manufacturers’ websites.
Manufacturers can design and build standards-based equipment that can be employed by
wireless operators using licensed frequencies and also by business users using both
licensed and unlicensed frequencies. Compared to other technologies, the cost of WiMAX
equipment is very attractive. For example, the cost of WiMAX CPEs has dropped to below
$100 each. Some CPE devices can support TV (video), telephone (voice), and data (Internet)
simultaneously.
The WiMAX MAC layer includes features designed to make it easy for carriers to deploy the
network. Once the BSs are in place, an end-user can connect to a WiMAX network by sim-
ply taking the CPE device out of the box, placing the antenna near a window or mounting
the CPE on an outside wall facing the nearest BS, and turning it on. In contrast to configur-
ing a Wi-Fi wireless residential gateway, for example, little or no configuration is required by
the customer to install a WiMAX CPE. This process also has the effect of dramatically reduc-
ing the installation costs for the service provider, who will no longer have to send a techni-
cian to the customer’s site for installation. By remotely managing the device, the provider

also reduces ongoing maintenance costs. The range of a WiMAX network is measured in
miles or kilometers, unlike Wi-Fi, which is measured in hundreds of feet or meters.
In December 2005, Nortel deployed the first commercial WiMAX
network, which covers 8,000 square miles (20,720 square kilometers)
in the southeast region of Alberta, Canada. The network, which
began serving both the public and the provincial government in
2006, operates in the 3.5 GHz band and provides Internet access to a
large rural area at speeds between 1 and 3 Mbps. This article on Wikipedia lists a number of
WiMAX networks deployed worldwide: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WiMAX_networks.
WiMAX Standards Family
IEEE 802.16 covers a wide range of functionality and has a number of variations that
address
specific
applications.
It
defines
the
interface
specification
for
fixed,
point-
to-multipoint broadband wireless metropolitan area networks. The 802.16-2001 standard
includes a PHY-layer specification for systems operating in the 10- to 66-GHz range and
forms the basis for all the other standards in the family. IEEE 802.16-2004 is a revised ver-
sion of the initial standard that adds support for systems operating in the 2- to 11-GHz
range.
The 802.16e amendment to the standard, ratified in December 2005, defines the specifica-
tions for a mobile version of WiMAX. This enhancement can enable data rates of up to
2 Mbps for portable devices that are slow moving or stationary, and speeds of up to
320 Kbps in fast-moving vehicles. IEEE 802.16m, an amendment that the WiMAX Forum
calls Release 2, raises the data rate to 100 Mbps and makes it possible to combine MIMO,
multiple frequency channels, and spatial multiplexing to achieve rates of up to 1 Gbps.
The 802.16m amendment has been incorporated in the IEEE 802.16-2012 standard
document.
WiMAX Protocol Stack
As with many of the technologies you have learned about in this book, the PHY and MAC
layers are the only ones that change between different networking standards. WiMAX is
unique in that, in addition to the PHY layer supporting multiple frequency bands, its PHY
layer is able to adapt on the fly. The modulation techniques and access mechanisms can
change dynamically from a BS to the SSs as well as to other BSs, depending on distance, the
existence of any interference, or the requirements of the particular device itself.
Unlike Ethernet, the MAC layer for WiMAX is connection oriented and includes service-
specific convergence sublayers that interface to the upper OSI layers. Remember that in the
OSI protocol model, only the Transport layer (Layer 4) is connection oriented. The conver-
gence sublayers of the MAC layer in WiMAX can map a particular service to a connection,
which allows WiMAX to offer multiple simultaneous services through the same link and to
carry a mix of communications protocols, such as IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet, VLANs, and others,
all in the same link and on the same network. The MAC layer in WiMAX also includes
a privacy sublayer that is used to secure the link (discussed in the security section of this
chapter). The 802.16 WiMAX protocol stack is shown in Figure 9-7.

PHY Layer There are several variations of the PHY layer in 802.16. Determining which
variation to use for a particular implementation depends on the frequency range and
whether it is a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint setup. The first two are based on the
modulation of a single carrier signal. Remember that when transmitting on a single fre-
quency, all transmitters have to work in half-duplex mode because they cannot transmit
and receive at the same time. In this case, each transmission is divided into fixed duration
frames that are 5 milliseconds long. Each frame is subdivided into one uplink subframe and
one downlink subframe. The BS transmits to the SSs during the downlink subframe, and the
SSs transmit to the BS during the uplink subframe.
The PHY frames can be 0.5 milliseconds, 1 millisecond, or 2 milliseconds long and are
divided into a variable uplink subframe and downlink subframe. The subframes are divided
into a series of time slots. Because the uplink and downlink subframe is variable, the BS can
allocate more time slots for the uplink or downlink, as required. The number of uplink or
downlink time slots allocated depends on the amount of data being transmitted in either
direction. A data transmission to or from a single device using multiple time slots is called
a burst. A burst can also be a broadcast transmission from the BS to all SSs. A transmission

includes commands or network management information that is sent prior to the transmis-
sion of the frame’s data portion. The BS allocates time slots for specific SSs in both the
downlink frame and the uplink frame. The amount of data contained in a burst depends on
the number and length of the time slot as well as on the modulation and coding scheme used
for that particular burst. This transmission method is called time division duplexing (TDD)
and is shown in Figure 9-8.
WiMAX also allows the use of two different frequency channels (FDD). The structure of the
frame in FDD is similar to that for TDD, except that one frequency is used exclusively for
the downlink and the other is used exclusively for the uplink.
WiMAX can support less-expensive half-duplex equipment as well as full-duplex stations
simultaneously, using different frequencies on the same network and at the same time. The
adaptive characteristic of the uplink and downlink, coupled with support of both TDD and
FDD, allows 802.16 to use the frequency spectrum more efficiently.
When half-duplex transmitters are connected to an FDD network, the BS needs to make
sure that it does not schedule time for those devices to transmit and receive simultaneously,
given that these are half-duplex-only stations.
In a point-to-multipoint architecture, the BS transmits using time division duplexing. The
SSs are each allocated a time slot in sequence. Note that because only the BS transmits in
the downlink direction, it does not have to be concerned with contention and can simply
address information in different time slots to different SSs.
Access in the uplink direction (from the SSs to the BS) uses time division multiple access
(TDMA), in which one or more time slots are allocated to each SS depending on the
TDD frame structure

requirements of the type of data being transmitted. Some of the time slots are also
allocated for contention access, which enables SSs that are not currently members of
the network to communicate with the BS for the purpose of establishing a connection to the
network.
In the 10 to 66 GHz licensed bands, 802.16-2009 supports one transmission mode:
WirelessMAN-SC (single carrier). It is used for fixed point-to-point connections using either
TDD or FDD. At these higher frequencies, line of sight to the transmitter and directional
antennas are required.
All the other transmission modes in WiMAX are designed to work in the 2 to 11 GHz
licensed or unlicensed bands. The 802.16 standard also supports non-line-of-sight applica-
tions. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) occurs when the transmitter antenna cannot be “seen”
(RF) from the receiver end or vice versa because of the geography of the area or obstruc-
tions such as buildings and trees that block the Fresnel zone by more than 40 percent.
Outdoor, tower-mounted antennas for homes can be expensive to purchase and install, espe-
cially in areas subject to high winds or ice accumulation, and significant multipath distortion
is likely to occur. Remember that when using directional antennas in line-of-sight applications,
multipath distortion can safely be ignored; however, in point-to-multipoint applications, the
BS will typically use an omnidirectional antenna. Examples of LOS and NLOS are shown in
Figure 9-9.

To support NLOS applications, additional PHY-layer functionality is required. The introduction
to WiMAX in this book discusses only the generic functionality because there are far too many
options, and to cover all of them would require an entire chapter dedicated to WiMAX. For
NLOS
applications,
802.16
supports
three
additional
PHY-layer
transmission
modes:
WirelessMAN-OFDM, WirelessMAN-OFDMA, and WirelessHUMAN. Each of these is defined
and discussed briefly in the next paragraphs.
WirelessMAN-OFDM can be used for fixed, mobile, or mesh applications. It uses TDD or
FDD in licensed bands below 11 GHz. This mode divides the frequency band into a number
of data subcarriers, pilot subcarriers, and null subcarriers to make it resistant to multipath
problems. The radio does not transmit during null subcarriers; the null subcarriers are used
as guard bands to prevent adjacent channel interference. The number of subcarriers is
dependent on the bandwidth of the RF channel. For example, in a 1.25 MHz-wide channel,
there can be up to 256 subcarriers, of which 192 are used for data, 8 are used as pilot sub-
carriers, and 55 are used for guard bands. Conversely, for a 20 MHz-wide channel, there
can be up to 2,048 subcarriers.
WirelessMAN-OFDMA uses orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), a
technique based on OFDM that divides the available frequency channel into 1,536 orthogo-
nal data subcarriers and allows the transmission of frames to different destination devices
and from different source devices. These subcarriers are then grouped into subchannels and
each SS is allocated a subchannel, allowing multiple stations and the BS to communicate in a
single transmission. Here again, the number of data subcarriers is dependent on the channel
width. OFDMA is also extremely resistant to multipath problems and is used in licensed
bands below 11 GHz.
A third transmission mechanism, Wireless High-Speed Unlicensed Metro Area Network
(WirelessHUMAN), is also based on OFDM and is specifically designed for use in the unli-
censed 5 GHz U-NII band.
In 802.16, OFDMA is also scalable, meaning that the number of subcarriers allocated to an
SS for the uplink can vary, depending on the QoS requirements of the transmission, the sig-
nal quality, or the distance between the SS and the BS. However, to accommodate channel
aggregation (multiple contiguous channels used to increase data rates) in 802.16m, the num-
ber of UL and DL frames is fixed and asymmetric, meaning that there are more DL frames
than UL frames.
Another key characteristic of the 802.16 PHY is that it supports adaptive modulation. In
simple terms, this means that for each SS, 802.16 can dynamically change the modula-
tion, increasing or decreasing the data rate based on signal quality. In addition, in order
to meet the regulatory requirements in different countries as well as to optimize the use
of the spectrum, the 802.16 standard allows transmitters to use frequency bandwidths
of a minimum of 1.25 MHz up to a maximum of 20 MHz. Table 9-2 summarizes the
WiMAX specification’s nomenclature, frequencies used, applications, and duplexing
alternatives.

Modulation and Error Correction In 802.16, modulation and forward error cor-
rection (FEC) are directly linked. In addition to FEC, 802.16 uses automatic repeat
requests (ARQ) to ensure the reliability of the transmissions. In other words, sometimes it
is necessary to resend the frame. IEEE 802.16 was designed to achieve 99.999 percent reli-
ability—“five nines,” as this level of reliability is commonly referred to in the computer
industry. FEC improves the chances of receiving the data correctly and thus reduces the
number of retransmissions, which increases the performance of the link. However, the
additional bits add overhead to the transmissions, increasing the total amount of data
and therefore reducing the overall performance of the link. By dynamically changing the
modulation, 802.16 can achieve an optimum balance of speed and transmission for a
given signal quality.
Table 9-3 lists the types of modulation supported in 802.16 and the associated mandatory
FEC coding. The coding rates are listed here for informational purposes only; as stated
before, a full explanation of the FEC is beyond the scope of this book. However, it is
important to know that the different FEC coding rates are used for increasing the reliabil-
ity of the transmission.
The ability of 802.16 to dynamically change modulations is also what makes it possible for
WiMAX to reduce latency and improve QoS. Latency is the amount of time delay it takes a
packet to travel from source to destination device. Figure 9-10 shows and example of how
WiMAX can use different modulations. Adaptive modulation also helps WiMAX use the
channel bandwidth more efficiently.

The BS sends information to the SSs about which modulations it will use for a particular
burst and for a particular SS in the first few data frames at the beginning of the transmis-
sion. The SSs respond by sending information to the BS at the beginning of their assigned
bursts.
WiMAX Profiles IEEE 802.16 defines certain profiles, which are sets of predefined
parameters that can include the frequency channel, bandwidth of the channel, and transmis-
sion modes (OFDM, OFDMA, etc.). These profiles also help to reduce or eliminate the need
for truck-rolls, which are support-technician visits to the site, given that they can be changed
remotely when a user signs up for a new type of service. WiMAX also specifies basic pro-
files: point-to-multipoint (P2MP) and point-to-point (PTP) as well as an optional mesh net-
working profile. A WiMAX system profile is a combination of the basic profile and one of
the transmission profiles; it is preset on the equipment by the operator companies (carriers)

before it is shipped to an end-user site. Burst profiles are negotiated between BSs and SSs for
the allocation of time slots required to maintain QoS.
Each truck-roll to install a single broadband network device at an
end-user’s site can cost a carrier or communications operator up
to $500.
Range and Throughput The maximum distances achievable in a WiMAX network
depend on the frequency band used. Recall that the higher the frequency, the shorter the
range of the signal at a given power setting. Conversely, higher-frequency signals allow for
higher data rates.
In general, higher frequencies are used for metropolitan-area line-of-sight, point-to-point
applications at very high data rates for carrier networks using licensed frequencies. Lower-
licensed frequencies—below 11 GHz—are typically used for private, line-of-sight network
connections of up to 10 miles (16 kilometers) as well as for long-distance links of up to
35 miles (56 kilometers). Frequencies below 11 GHz are also used for non-line-of-sight
networks with a maximum range of up to 5 miles (8 kilometers).
WiMAX base stations and subscriber stations perform ranging (distance) calculations based
on signal quality. This process occurs when a subscriber station initially joins the network
and periodically thereafter, and it helps the equipment establish the modulation and FEC
coding to use for data transmissions.
As you already learned, the maximum achievable data rates in WiMAX depend on the mod-
ulation, channel bandwidth, and FEC coding used. Table 9-4 shows a summary of some of
the data-rate combinations that are possible.
Note that a wider channel bandwidth combined with more complex modulation also means
that more data can be sent per signal unit (symbol), as you learned in Chapter 2, hence the
higher data rates that can be achieved with wider channels. Realistic throughput will be
lower than the rates shown in Table 9-4. One reason for this is that the WiMAX channel
bandwidth is shared among BSs and SSs, and therefore the number of simultaneous devices
actively communicating affects the maximum throughput at any given time. Another reason

for the lower throughput is that some of the overhead, such as MAC layer framing, is not
included in the rate calculations shown in the table.
MAC Layer WiMAX is typically implemented on a point-to-multipoint basis, with one BS
and potentially hundreds of SSs, including mobile users. The 802.16 MAC dynamically
allocates bandwidth to individual SSs for the uplink; this is the key to the high data rates
possible in WiMAX networks. In addition to supporting a large number of SSs, the MAC
convergence sublayers allow WiMAX to be implemented as an efficient transport in
point-to-point systems for backhaul applications and support such line protocols as
ATM and T1.
A point-to-multipoint WiMAX network usually operates with a central BS that can be
equipped with either an omnidirectional or a smart antenna, which is also called an
advanced antenna system (AAS). An AAS can transmit multiple simultaneous signals in dif-
ferent directions to stations that fall within the range of each of the antennas. It also helps to
maximize the amount of RF energy sent in each direction.
WiMAX can also take advantage of multiple-in and multiple-out (MIMO) antenna systems
to reduce interference with other systems (see the next section on WiMAX coexistence) and
the impact of multipath distortion. In addition, 802.16m enables support for multiple radios
and spatial multiplexing to increase data rates for mobile devices.
To address a burst to a particular SS, the BS uses a 16-bit number called a connection iden-
tifier (CID), which is used to identify both the device and the connection after it connects to
the WiMAX network. Recall that the WiMAX MAC layer is connection oriented. Each sta-
tion also has a 48-bit MAC address, which is only used during connection establishment.
When the stations receive a transmission from the BS, they check the CID and keep only
the MAC frames that contain data addressed to them.
Stations can request additional dedicated bandwidth (for QoS) if this is required to sup-
port a particular service, such as the transmission of telephone calls or a video stream.
The BS polls the SSs periodically to identify their bandwidth needs, granting bandwidth
as required. Except in the case of connections that require a guaranteed bit rate, such as
T1, most data connections cannot tolerate errors but can tolerate latency and jitter. Jitter
is the maximum delay variation between two consecutive packets over a period of time.
Web browsing, transmitting email messages, and downloading files are latency-tolerant
and jitter-tolerant activities. Video and voice, on the other hand, can tolerate a certain
amount of errors but not latency or jitter. Video streams tolerate the loss of image frames,
so long as the user still sees at least 15 images per second. However, voice streams do not
tolerate losses or delays greater than 50 milliseconds, which seriously degrade the quality
of a call to human ears.
The WiMAX MAC protocol maintains a consistent bandwidth by using a self-correcting
mechanism for granting more bandwidth to SSs. This creates less traffic on the network,
given that there is no need for SSs to acknowledge the grant. Instead, if an SS does not
receive the bandwidth grant or the BS does not receive the request, the SS will simply
request it again. The requests from the SSs are cumulative, but they will also periodically
inform the BS of their total bandwidth needs. This method is far more efficient than those
used by other networking standards, which makes WiMAX a very elegantly designed
technology.

The scheduling services in WiMAX that map the connections in the
uplink direction for allocating channel bandwidth to the SSs are based
on the scheduling services defined for cable modems in the Data Over
Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) standard. For more infor-
mation, go to: http://www.cablelabs.com/specs/specification-search and
enter “DOCSIS” in the search box.
A MAC frame includes a fixed-length header, an optional and variable-length payload
(data), and an optional cyclic redundancy check (CRC). Header-only MAC frames are used
to send commands and requests between the BS and the SSs. The generic MAC frame for-
mat is shown in Figure 9-11.
WMAN Security
As with other types of networks, security in WMANs is a major concern. Because FSO and
microwave security for WMAN installations use proprietary technology, most of this section
focuses on security measures for WiMAX.
FSO Security
Despite using multiple beam technology (which could allow an attacker to attempt to
capture information by interrupting a single beam), FSO systems are generally considered
secure. Anyone trying to sniff information from an FSO system would have difficulty
accessing the equipment and blocking only a portion of an invisible beam. In addition,
such interference would affect the performance of the network, immediately alerting the
user or operator.
Microwave Security
Each microwave vendor implements its own security protocols, because most of the technol-
ogy is proprietary, but 128- and 256-bit AES encryption is the norm. Using AES encryption
means that systems meet not only the minimum security requirements established by the
U.S. federal government but also the requirements of privacy laws.

WiMAX Security
As you learned in the section on the WiMAX protocol stack, the MAC layer includes a pri-
vacy sublayer. Unlike 802.11 and Bluetooth, the WiMAX standard was initially designed to
include very powerful security measures. These features make it extremely difficult—if not
impossible—for a would-be hackers to steal information from WiMAX transmissions.
The privacy sublayer provides a client/server authentication and key management proto-
col, with the BS controlling the distribution of security keys to the SSs. In addition, the
standard encrypts all the data transmitted between the BS and SSs and makes use of digital
certificates, which are messages digitally signed by a certification authority, as well as
public-key infrastructure embedded in the BS, to ensure privacy and protect against infor-
mation theft. Manufacturers install a unique digital certificate that includes a serial num-
ber in every device. The digital certificate can be verified with the manufacturer as being
valid and unique by sending a copy of the certificate encrypted with the manufacturer’s
public key over the Internet (a connection to the Internet is required). This is a require-
ment of the 802.16 standard.
The privacy sublayer has two protocol components: the encapsulation protocol and the pri-
vacy key management protocol. The encapsulation protocol is used for encrypting packet
data and includes a set of cryptographic suites (the encryption and authentication mechan-
isms) used to apply encryption to the transmitted data. The privacy key management proto-
col is used for securing key distribution from the BS to the SSs; it is used for synchronizing
the security keys between the BS and SSs as well as for preventing unauthorized stations
from associating with a WiMAX network.
Once a device is authenticated with the BS using the digital certificate, a traffic encryption
key (TEK), which is the security key used to encrypt the data, is exchanged between the
BS and SS for each service connection that’s being carried over the wireless interface.
Remember that the 802.16 MAC is connection oriented and can carry multiple types of
service. TEKs expire, and the SS must periodically renew the keys with the BS. The
default TEK lifetime is 12 hours. The minimum value is 30 minutes, and the maximum
value is 7 days.
Only the headers are not encrypted in WiMAX, to allow SSs to associate with the network.
All data sent across the wireless medium is encrypted using one of the following algorithms:
●
3-DES (Triple-DES)—Data is encrypted three times with a 128-bit key, using the U.S.
Data Encryption Standard (DES).
●
RSA with 1,024-bit key—RSA was developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and
Leonard Adleman. The algorithm uses a large integer, composed of smaller numbers
that are multiplied by each other. It is based on the idea that it will be difficult to
figure out each of the smaller numbers that are used to arrive at the large integer.
●
AES—Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) was developed by the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) to replace DES. It is still considered unbreakable
and is used to protect all unclassified U.S. government material. Today, AES
encryption has practically replaced all others, including the two mentioned above.
The security methods designed into WiMAX should be sufficient to allay any concerns that
end-users may have.

The high reliability and high security of WiMAX, together with its long
distance and NLOS characteristics, make it an excellent candidate for
use by, for example, security companies providing burglar alarms
for homes and businesses. WiMAX makes it viable to secure a building
or home using a live video link and IP-based security cameras.
Chapter Summary
■WMANs are a group of technologies that provide wireless connectivity throughout an
substantial geographical area, such as a city, without cable infrastructure. WMANs
also extend user mobility throughout a metropolitan area.
■Last mile wired connections are the links between the customer’s premises and an ISP.
Most last mile connections today are still based on copper wiring.
■There are two ways in which a WMAN signal can be sent. The first technique, called
broadband, sends multiple data signals simultaneously on the same medium. The
second technique, called baseband, treats the entire transmission medium as if it were
only one channel, sending only one stream of data. Until 2001, RF-based fixed broad-
band systems were limited to connecting with only one other device at a time and
could only transmit using a line-of-sight link.
■Free Space Optics (FSO) has been an excellent alternative to costly high-speed fiber-optic
connections. FSO transmissions are sent by low-powered infrared beams in point-
to-point fashion. Because FSO is a line-of-sight technology, the transceivers must be
mounted in high locations to provide a clear transmission path.
■Microwave is the most common way used to implement both short- and long-distance
WMANs. Microwave is not based on standards, meaning that equipment is proprie-
tary and users must purchase all of it from a single vendor to ensure interoperability.
■Microwave links can be either permanent or temporary and use frequencies ranging
from 3 to 80 GHz and achieve data rates of up to 4 Gbps. This technology is used
extensively by carriers to implement intercity links, as well as to link cellular telephone
towers where wired infrastructure is not available. Today’s microwave links carry
voice, video, and data traffic over IP.
■The IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) standard was introduced in 2000 with the goal of stan-
dardizing fixed broadband wireless services and as an alternative to wired networks. A
single WiMAX base station (BS) can communicate with hundreds of subscriber stations
(SSs) simultaneously in point-to-multipoint mode, or with another BS in point-to-point
mode. IEEE 802.16 equipment can transmit in either the 10- to 66-GHz range or in the
2- to 11-GHz range and can use licensed or unlicensed frequency bands. A BS can also
connect directly with a laptop computer equipped with a WiMAX wireless interface.
■WiMAX can transmit at speeds of up to 70 Mbps in the 2 to 11 GHz bands and can
achieve 120 Mbps at short distances in the 10 to 66 GHz bands. The 802.16m amend-
ment allows the use of multiple radios and spatial multiplexing and can potentially
increase the data rates to 1 Gbps when aggregating multiple 20-MHz-wide frequency
channels. QoS support makes WiMAX suitable to carry simultaneous voice, video, and

data (triple play) at a much lower cost than older LMDS and MMDS networks.
WiMAX equipment is relatively easy and inexpensive to install and maintain.
■The range of a WiMAX network is measured in miles or kilometers, as opposed to the
range of WPAN and WLAN technologies, which is measured from inches/centimeters
to a few hundred feet/meters.
■The 802.16e amendment brings full support of mobile devices to WiMAX technology.
Mobile WiMAX can achieve data rates of up to 2 Mbps for portable devices that are
slow moving or stationary and up to 320 Kbps in fast-moving vehicles.
■The WiMAX MAC layer is connection oriented and includes convergence sublayers
that allow a WiMAX network to carry a variety of different frame formats from other
technologies. There are five variations of the 802.16 PHY layer. The first two are
based on the modulation of a single carrier signal. All devices work in half-duplex.
The PHY frames can be 0.5 milliseconds, 1 millisecond, or 2 milliseconds long and are
divided into a variable uplink subframe and downlink subframe. The subframe is
divided into time slots that carry the payload. A single time slot or multiple time slots
can be allocated to a specific station. The mechanism is called time division duplexing
(TDD). WiMAX also supports the use of two frequency channels, one for the uplink
and another for the downlink. This is called frequency division duplexing (FDD).
■The BS can support both half-duplex and full-duplex devices simultaneously on the
network and is the only device transmitting on the downlink. The BS transmits using
time division multiplexing (TDM). The stations transmit using time division multiple
access (TDMA). The BS allocates time slots for contention access in the uplink sub-
frame in order to allow stations to establish a connection and join the network.
■The WiMAX 802.16 standard defines three PHY layers for line-of-sight (LOS) and
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) implementations in the 2 to 11 GHz licensed or unlicensed
frequency bands: WirelessMAN-OFDM, WirelessMAN-OFDMA, and WirelessHU-
MAN, the last which is intended for use in the 5 GHz U-NII band.
■OFDM and OFDMA in 802.16 are scalable, meaning that the number of subcarriers
allocated to an SS for the uplink can vary depending on the QoS requirements of the
SS, the distance between the SS and BS, and the signal quality. The WiMAX PHY
layer uses adaptive modulation. It can dynamically change modulation techniques
depending on the distance and signal quality. WiMAX transmitters can transmit using
frequency bandwidths from 1.25 MHz up to 20 MHz. Through the use of error-
correction techniques and adaptive modulation, WiMAX makes efficient use of the
spectrum and achieves high performance.
■WiMAX profiles specify the frequency channel, bandwidth, and transmission mecha-
nism. A basic profile specifies whether the network is point-to-point or point-
to-multipoint. A system profile is the combination of a basic profile and transmission
profile. The use of profiles helps make WiMAX installations simpler and reduces
the cost of implementation for the operators.
■The MAC layer is the key to the intelligence and security behind WiMAX networks.
Efficient bandwidth-saving protocols and QoS help WiMAX reduce latency and jitter
and maintain a consistent bandwidth. WiMAX includes a number of features that help
operators and end-users reduce interference problems.

■The security features of WiMAX were designed to offer operators and end-users the
peace of mind that other wireless technologies have failed to provide so far. WiMAX
uses verifiable digital certificates, the most advanced encryption mechanisms (3-DES,

As part of your job as a wireless technologist, one of your important
tasks is to keep up-to-date on the hardware available. Identify a few man-
ufacturers of FSO, microwave, and WiMAX technology discussed in this
chapter and familiarize yourself with their equipment, their capabilities, and some of
their customers. Prepare a brief on each technology, showing a list of manufacturer’s
company names what type of equipment they supply (such as transmitters, antennas,
BSs, CPEs, wireless adapters). Create a one-page or two-page list that includes the fre-
quencies that the equipment is capable of operating on, some of their existing custo-
mers and locations.

Project 9-2
Research news media websites like Forbes, Tech Republic, and others, and try
to locate a current or historical article that discusses the deployment or expan-
sion of one of the wireless technologies you have just learned about. Don’t
limit yourself to North America. Create a short slide presentation that shows the purpose
and the extent of the deployment as well as the expectations of the project, such as what
types of services are offered (i.e., Internet access, video, and telephone). How is it expected
to benefit a company or the people in the area? One example of this is using WiMAX to
connect oil-drilling platforms that are located near the coast.
Real-World Exercise
The Baypoint Group (TBG) is once again calling on you, their wireless expert. A customer,
Advancomms Inc., plans to deploy smart (advanced) antenna systems for a mobile WiMAX
network it wants to install in your area, and your task is to locate possible deployment sites.
The ideal location would be a building at least eight stories high, which avoids the high cost
of erecting towers and supplying power. Another important factor in selecting the site is trying
to avoid other wireless antenna systems that might already be deployed in the area.
Exercise 9-1
Use Google Earth or another similar satellite and 3D map system to help you narrow down
the area you want to investigate. Then drive, take public transportation, or walk around the
downtown area and spot as many wireless antennas as you can, marking on a map the loca-
tion and positioning of each. If there are antennas already installed on top of the buildings
or in towers in your area, you will need to consider whether there is enough vertical space
where Advancomm can mount smart antennas. If there are no tall buildings in your area,
try to identify possible tower locations while ensuring that the antenna signals will not be
blocked by any other structures or terrain, such as hills and mountains.
Use Google Maps or a similar application to display and print a map of your local down-
town area, then edit the map to show all the antenna locations.
Produce a short (5–8 slides) PowerPoint presentation that includes the maps and locations of
all the potential sites. Include photos of the sites if possible. Remember to indicate whether
you think there might be any potential problems.

A wireless wide area network (WWAN) spans a geographical area as large as an
entire country or even the entire world. WWANs can use the cellular phone network to
span a country or an entire continent. Where cellular phone networks are not available, sat-
ellite technology can enable users to make telephone calls or access the Internet from remote
areas. These two technologies complement each other in many ways and make it possible
for users to enjoy connectivity to the Internet and even run business applications from
almost any location on the planet.
This chapter first explores how cellular phones work and some of the issues surrounding
implementation of digital cellular phone technology. It then takes a look at how satellite
wireless communications work, some of the issues surrounding the use of satellites for data
transmission, and how satellites complement cellular telephony to help provide a truly
global wireless wide area network.
Cellular Telephony
Although the browsers on cellular phones sometimes lack the full capabilities of desktop or
laptop computer browsers, a cellular phone can be connected (tethered) to a laptop using a
cable or Wi-Fi, and the resulting data connection to networks like the Internet can be used to
run applications that might otherwise not work from a smartphone. Practically all smart-
phones include a hotspot feature that enables them to act as Wi-Fi APs, allowing users to con-
nect a laptop computer to the Internet using two different, nonconflicting wireless technologies
simultaneously, Wi-Fi and digital cellular telephony.
From the user’s perspective, cellular phone technology today is as ubiquitous as the wired tele-
phone was just a decade or two ago. With some exceptions in remote areas where cellular net-
works are not available, people use smartphones to make and receive calls, send and receive
short text messages, send and receive emails, access the web, upload and download all types
of data files and pictures, and even watch TV and full-length movies. In many parts of the
world, especially where the traditional wired telephone infrastructure is either outdated or
nonexistent, cellular phones are making voice and data connections available to users who
never before had access to a private telephone line, let alone the Internet. In fact, cellular
phones are quickly replacing traditional land-based telephone lines for large groups of
people.
Cellular phones literally change lives! By the time fishermen tie their boats to the dock, the
catch is often already sold to the highest bidder. Farmers in remote communities can sell their
products directly to retailers while on their way to the market. Cellular phones enable produ-
cers and small manufacturers to bypass middlemen and enjoy higher profits, something that in
the end benefits both the producers and consumers.
From a technological point of view, there is nothing simple about digital cellular telephony.
On the contrary, cellular telephony is probably one of the most complex of all wireless com-
munications technologies. Today, cellular phone users expect their phones to perform as well
for data as they do for voice calls. Over the past four decades, developments in cellular phone
technology have been driven by user demand for high data rates and high-quality voice con-
nections. Cellular phone technology is marketed by the carriers and better known by users by

the generation number, such as 2G, 3G, and 4G. The cellular phone business, from the manu-
facturer to the carriers, is one of the most fiercely competitive businesses anywhere in the
world. Governments also take advantage of the growth in the cellular business by auctioning
off parts of the wireless spectrum, and in the process, they collect billions of dollars in leasing
fees.
Cellular Telephone Technology
Cellular telephony technology continues to grow at what can only be described as warp
speed. The ever-expanding range of uses and features that digital cellular networks can pro-
vide to mobile users is one of the main reasons for this growth. Today, practically all cellular
phone networks are based on digital instead of analog transmission technology. Cellular
phones transmit data at ever-increasing speeds and are no longer limited to primarily voice
communications. As you no doubt know, smartphones can do much more than what a tradi-
tional telephone or the mobile phones of a decade ago could do. Today’s smartphones can be
used for many sophisticated applications beyond simply browsing the web or sending and
receiving messages and email.
In 2013, the number of cellular phone subscriptions worldwide
reached 6.8 billion. In 2015, the number of people in the world
with a smartphone subscription reached 2.6 billion and it continues
to grow. For more information, check some of the statistics pages
available at mobiforge.com.
How Cellular Telephony Works
The key to understanding how cellular telephony works is that the coverage area is divided
into smaller individual sections, called cells, as shown in Figure 10-1. A typical cell ranges
from a few thousand feet in diameter to approximately 10 square miles (26 square kilo-
meters). At the center of each cell are a transmitter and a receiver with which the mobile
devices near that cell communicate, via RF signals. These transmitters are connected to a
base station, and each base station is connected to a mobile telecommunications switching
office (MTSO). The MTSO is the link between the cellular phone network and the wired
telephone world, commonly referred to as public switched telephone network (PSTN) or
sometimes plain old telephone system (POTS). The MTSO “controls” all transmitters and
base stations in the cellular phone network. A large city may have multiple MTSOs, each
controlling a group of cells.

Cells are drawn as hexagons simply because it makes it easier to
show adjacent cells without the use of overlapping lines, which can
be confusing. In reality, a cell’s shape is closer to a circle, although
buildings and other geographic features can affect the shape.
Today’s digital transmitters and digital cellular phones operate at low power levels, which
enables carriers to install more cells closer together and support more users. Using low-
power mobile devices enables the signal from a cell transmitter or from a single phone to
stay confined to a smaller area and cause little or no interference with nearby cells.
Because the signal at a particular frequency does not go far beyond the cell area, that
same frequency can be used in nearby cells at the same time, though not in adjacent cells.
This is called frequency reuse, and a simplified example of it is shown in the diagram in
Figure 10-2.

Cellular phones have special codes associated with them. These codes are used to identify
the phone, the phone’s owner, and the carrier or service provider (such as AT&T or Sprint).
Some of these codes are preprogrammed when the phone is manufactured, whereas
others are associated with the user’s account. Most cellular phones today require a SIM card
to be installed on the phone before they can be used. A SIM (subscriber identity module) card
is a very small electronic card used to associate the phone with the user’s account and with the
carrier. Figure 10-3 shows three sizes of SIM cards used in different mobile phones today.

SIM cards can have between 64 KB and 512 KB of ROM, between 1 KB and 8 KB of
RAM, and between 64 KB and 512 KB of EEPROM. The user’s phone number is stored
on the SIM card, and users have a choice of storing contact numbers on the phone’s
memory or on the SIM card. Users can often move the card between one phone and
another and use different phones without reprogramming. An example of this is when a
user is travelling in an area where the frequency bands used are different than those she
uses in her home area. She may be able to rent a phone that is compatible with the local
cellular phone service but still use her home account simply by moving the SIM card to a
different phone.
Table 10-1 summarizes the codes used in cellular telephony along with their respective sizes
and purposes. Note that although these codes are usually present on practically all cellular
phones, some of them are no longer used by all carriers.
An ESN number is permanently assigned to a specific cellular phone
when it is manufactured. The carrier or reseller programs the MIN
into the phone at account-activation time. The SID code is pro-
grammed into the carrier’s system and associated with the SIM card
at account-activation time. The IMEI number also identifies the SIM
cards. As you know, cellular phones can be “locked” to a particular carrier, in which case it
cannot be used with another carrier unless it is first unlocked.
When a cellular phone user moves around within a particular cell, the transmitters at the
base station for that cell handle all the communications. As the user moves toward the next
cell, the cellular phone automatically communicates and associates with the base station of
the cell that is closer to it, without interrupting the call or data connection. The process of
the new cell taking over the user’s call is called a handoff. However, what happens if a cellu-
lar phone user moves beyond the coverage area of the entire cellular phone network—for

example, if he goes from Nashville to Boston? In this case, the cellular telephone would
connect with the cellular phone network in Boston, which will then communicate with the
network in Nashville to verify that the user has a valid account and can make calls. This con-
nection to a cell outside a user’s home area is known as roaming. A comparison between
handoff and roaming is shown in Figure 10-4.
A cellular phone user’s home area is the location where he lives or works and where he has
an account with the cellular phone carrier. When connected to the home area, the user pays
local, per-minute call rates. When roaming, the per-minute rates tend to be higher, and a
roaming fee might also apply. Per-minute rates and roaming rates depend on the carrier
with which the user has an account, and some carriers have been phasing out roaming fees
within their national coverage area.
The steps (shown in Figure 10-5) that a cellular phone uses to receive a call are as follows:
1. When the cellular phone is turned on, it scans the frequencies that it is programmed
to use and listens for a broadcast from the nearest base station on a selected fre-
quency known as a control channel. This broadcast contains information about the

network, the frequencies used in a particular cell, etc. If the phone cannot detect a
control channel, it might be out of range of a compatible network, in which case it
displays a message to the user such as “No Service.” The broadcast also contains the
SID of the carrier.
2. If the cellular phone receives the broadcast information correctly, it compares it with
the SID of the carrier that was programmed into the phone or the SIM card. If the
information on the phone or the SIM card matches the broadcast, the cellular phone
is in a network owned by its carrier. The cellular phone then transmits a registration
request number to the base station that the MTSO uses for tracking the cell(s) in
which the phone is located.
3. If the SID does not match, then the phone is roaming. The MTSO of the remote net-
work contacts the MTSO of the home network, which confirms that the SID of the
phone belongs to a valid account. The MTSO of the remote network then tracks the
phone and sends the call information (including length of call and the call’s status as
a roaming connection) back to the home MTSO.
4. When a call comes in, the MTSO locates the phone through the registration
request and then selects a frequency that will be used for communication.

5. The MTSO sends the frequency information to the phone over the control channel.
Both the phone and the transmitter switch to that frequency, and the connection is
then completed.
6. The phone and transmitter change frequencies as required.
The process of making an outgoing call is similar to the one for receiving a call.
Although the U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 makes it illegal
to intercept cellular transmissions, callers should remember that their
conversations are being broadcast across a public wireless network.
The way today’s cellular phones work, however, makes it extremely
difficult and expensive to intercept a cellular call, but not impossible.
Evolution of Cellular Technology
Because cellular technology is available worldwide, it is useful to learn about how it evolved
and where it might be going in the future. All carriers in the world today appear to be moving
toward a common system. Cellular phones have been available since the early 1980s in the
United States. Since that time, cellular phone technology has changed dramatically. Most
industry experts talk in terms of several generations of cellular telephony. This section sum-
marizes the evolution of cellular technologies.
1G (first generation) cellular telephony used analog transmission and modulated voice
using FM. It was based on a standard called Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS)
using circuit switching, and operated in the 800 to 900 MHz frequency spectrum, using
30 KHz wide channels, with a 45 KHz passband (7.5 KHz guard bands on either side)
and frequency division multiple access (FDMA, shown in Figure 10-6), allocating two
frequencies to each user (one for transmit and one to receive). There were 832 frequen-
cies available for transmission. Out of those frequencies, 790 were used for voice traffic
and the remaining 42 were used for control channels. Because two frequencies were
used for each full duplex cellular telephone conversation (one to transmit and one to
receive), there were actually 395 voice channels, 21 of which were used for control chan-
nel functions. The total number of frequencies available might also need to be divided
among multiple carriers in same area. This severely limited the maximum number of
users that could make a call at any given time, and it was a common occurrence to
attempt a call and get a fast busy signal indicating that there were no channels available.
Although data transmission was possible, it required the use of modems and the speed
was limited to 9.6 Kbps.
AMPS frequency channels provided voice quality comparable to a
standard wired telephone transmission, except in the presence of
interference, where voice quality degraded significantly.

2G (second generation) cellular telephony was first deployed in the early 1990s to replace
AMPS. Most 2G networks are being or have been phased out by now. Second generation
networks were capable of transmitting data at between 9.6 and 14.4 Kbps in the
800 MHz and 1.9 GHz frequency bands, but they were still circuit switched for both
voice and data and so could provide only limited data services. 2G systems use digital
instead of analog transmissions, which improved voice quality because digital signals can
be regenerated and the interference removed. Digital transmissions use the frequency
spectrum more efficiently, in a variety of ways, so the carriers are able to support a larger
number of users per cell. Digital transmissions also use less power and, as a result, they
enabled manufacturers to make smaller and less expensive mobile devices, tower trans-
mitters and receivers.
Carriers deploying 2G cellular networks built their networks around various kinds of
access technologies. Three technologies were used in 2G: TDMA, CDMA, and GSM.
Time division multiple access (TDMA) cellular divides each 30 KHz radio frequency
channel into six unique time slots, and each caller uses two time slots (one for transmit-
ting and one for receiving). This means that TDMA could handle three times as many
calls over a single frequency channel as FDMA, but it still used circuit switching for
both voice and data, and it could not transmit both simultaneously. TDMA is shown in
Figure 10-7.

With code division multiple access (CDMA), each user is allocated the entire spectrum all of
the time, as shown in Figure 10-8. CDMA uses direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and
unique digital pseudo-random codes (PN codes), rather than separate RF frequencies, to dif-
ferentiate between users. A CDMA transmission is spread across the frequency, and the digital
codes are applied to the individual transmissions. When the signal is received, the codes are
removed from the signal in the way described in Chapter 3.
Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), developed in the 1980s as the European
standard for public mobile communications, uses a combination of FDMA and TDMA tech-
nologies. It divides a 25 MHz wide channel into 124 frequencies of 200 KHz each. Each 200
KHz channel is then divided into eight time slots using TDMA. The modulation employed is a
variation of frequency shift keying (FSK) called Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK),
which uses filters to help reduce interference between adjacent channels. GSM systems can
transmit data at speeds up to 9.6 Kbps.

In 1989, the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA)
chose TDMA over FDMA as the technology of choice for digital cellu-
lar networks. However, with the growing technology competition
posed by CDMA and the fact that Europe was using GSM for mobile
communications, the CTIA reconsidered and decided to let carriers
make their own technology choices.
Until the migration to the next generation technology (3G) was completed, an interim step
known as 2.5G (2.5 generation) cellular telephony was widely deployed throughout North
America. 2.5G can transmit data at a theoretical maximum data rate of 384 Kbps, and it
was also widely deployed in many nations, such as China, Japan, and Korea.
The primary difference between 2G and 2.5G networks is that in 2.5G networks data was
transmitted over a packet-switched connection, while voice still used circuit switching.
Packet switching allows always-on data connections, and it becomes practical to keep the data
connection at all times. Each packet is transmitted independently through the network to the des-
tination and only uses the channel for the time required to transmit it, so other devices can use the
channel to send and receive data, with each device taking turns sending packets, in each cell.
The ability to maintain a data connection on at all times, along with
higher transmission speeds, also made digital cable modems and
DSL connections more popular than dial-up connections for home
use. You can watch TV, talk on the phone, and access the Internet
all at the same time, and you don’t have to wait for a connection to
be reestablished when you want to browse the web, send or check your emails, chat, etc.
There were three 2.5G network technologies. Which one was used by a carrier depends on
which 2G-network technology the carrier was migrating from. From TDMA or GSM 2G net-
works, the upgrade path was a 2.5G technology known as general packet radio service
(GPRS). GPRS uses eight time slots in a 200 KHz spectrum and four different coding techni-
ques to transmit data at theoretical maximum speeds of 114 Kbps. The next upgrade step
beyond GPRS was Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), which boosts data
transmission speeds up to 384 Kbps. It is based on 8-PSK modulation, in which the phase of
the carrier is shifted in 45-degree increments and 3 bits can be transmitted per phase change.
EDGE-based networks can coexist with standard GSM networks.
For carriers migrating from a 2G CDMA network, the transition was to CDMA2000 1xRTT
(“1xRTT” stands for “1-times Radio Transmission Technology”), which operates on a pair of
1.25-MHzwide frequency channels and is designed to support up to 144 Kbps packet data
transmission as well as to double the voice capacity of CDMA networks.
3G (third generation) cellular telephony was designed to be a uniform and global standard for
cellular wireless communication. The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) listed the
following maximum data rates for a wireless cellular digital network:
●
144 Kbps for a mobile user
●
386 Kbps for a slowly moving user
●
2 Mbps for a stationary user

Converting from a 2.5G network to a 3G network depends on the 2.5G technology that was
employed by the carrier. If the transition is being made from CDMA2000 1xRTT, the path
would be to CDMA2000 1xEVDO (“EVDO” is short for “Evolution Data Optimized”).
This technology can transmit at up to 2.4 Mbps. However, EVDO can only send data and
must be coupled with 1xRTT to handle both voice and data. EVDO uses a pair of separate
dedicated channels for data, often in new frequency bands being added to the bands available
for use with CDMA2000 technologies. EVDO radios measure the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
in each channel pair every 1.667 milliseconds to determine which cellular phone device to ser-
vice next. By using dedicated data channels and continually optimizing transmissions to the
devices that have the best signal at any given time, EVDO can achieve higher data rates. The
successor to CDMA2000 1xEVDO was CDMA2000 1xEVDV (“EVDV” is short for “Evolu-
tion Data and Voice”), which can send both data and voice transmissions simultaneously over
a packet-switched network. EVDV can reach data transfer speeds of up to 3.09 Mbps down-
stream. Release D of EVDV supports up to 1.0 Mbps upstream.
In 2005, Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel Corporation in the
United States as well as Bell Canada and TELUS in Canada initiated
nationwide deployment of 1xEVDO. Alaska Communications Systems
(ACS) deployed 1xEVDO in Alaska’s main population centers.
If a network is transitioning from EDGE 2.5G technology, Wideband CDMA (W-CDMA) is
the migration path to 3G. W-CDMA adds a packet-switched data channel to a circuit-switched
voice channel. It can send at up to 2 Mbps to a stationary user and 384 Kbps when mobile.
The upgrade path from W-CDMA is to High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA),
another interim technology that can transmit at 8 to 10 Mbps downstream. HSDPA uses a
5 MHz W-CDMA channel along with a variety of adaptive modulations, multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) antennas, and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) techniques,
all grouped together to potentially achieve very high data rates. Several carriers in North
America that were supporting GSM moved quickly to update their equipment to HSDPA.
But the changes do not end there. As the number of subscribers increases, carriers are under
pressure to support more users with a limited amount of frequency bandwidth. Most, if not
all, of the carriers that had deployed CDMA found themselves under pressure to move to a
technology that was proposed in 2005 and could support theoretical peak download data
rates as high as 300 Mbps and upload rates of 75 Mbps. CDMA carriers needed to match
these speeds, which could not be accomplished with EVDV, so they began deploying and test-
ing the immediate successor to HSDPA, which is HSPA+ (Evolved High-Speed Packet Access).
This technical standard provides theoretical data rates of up to 168 Mbps on the downlink
(a realistic maximum is around 42 Mbps) and 22 Mbps on the uplink and combines two
HSDPA transmitters into one, using MIMO, 64-QAM modulation (downlink; 6 bits per sym-
bol) and 16-QAM modulation (uplink; 4 bits per symbol). Two parallel transmission channels
form a spatially multiplexed channel, but keep in mind that higher data rates are also depen-
dent on the processing capacity of the cellular phones themselves.
HSPA+ allows the carriers to move to an all-IP, packet-only architecture in which the base
stations can bypass the legacy infrastructure of cellular networks, connecting directly to a
gateway and using IP routing technology to forward packets to and from a mobile user.
HSPA+ can handle up to five times more users per cell on the downlink and twice the
Evolution of Cellular Technology

number of users on the uplink than previous-generation systems. All of this reduces the cost
per bit for the carrier, and the savings eventually flow through to the end users.
HSPA+ also provides an upgrade path to the latest-generation technology, Long Term Evolu-
tion (LTE), also known as 4G (fourth generation), which many carriers worldwide have
adopted or moved toward. LTE expands the MIMO/Spatial Multiplexing beyond the 2  2
radio configuration of HSPA+ and allows the use of wider bandwidth RF transmission chan-
nels, up to 20 MHz to achieve maximum data rates of up to 100 Mbps on the downlink.
Carriers have the option of using narrower channels, 1.4, 3, 5, 10, and 15 MHz, which, of
course, reduces the maximum achievable data rates.
LTE uses OFDM on the downlink (tower to mobile device) and a technique called orthogonal
frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). The tower equipment can transmit an OFDM
signal with up to 2048 subcarriers (only 72 are used by each mobile device), which enables
the tower to connect to multiple devices at the same time. Each of the subcarriers is then
modulated using QPSK (2 bits per symbol), 16-QAM (4 bits per symbol), or 64-QAM (6 bits
per symbol). Which modulation is chosen by the transmitters depends on the SNR at any
given time.
For the uplink (mobile to tower) LTE uses single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA), which essen-
tially assigns a single subcarrier in the same OFDM stream to each user communicating with
the same tower. This not only allows carriers to increase the number of simultaneous users on
the uplink and reduce peak RF traffic issues, but it also reduces the power requirements for
mobile devices to help the battery charge last longer. The tower still uses at least two antennas
per receiver, so the design of system is still essentially MIMO based.
LTE simplifies the cellular network infrastructure for the carriers and makes deployment eas-
ier. This is one of the reasons why a large number of cellular networks worldwide have been
upgraded or are being upgraded to LTE as well as to the latest evolutions of cellular technol-
ogy, LTE Advanced and Voice over LTE (VoLTE). The original version of LTE was intro-
duced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in 2009 (see http://www.3gpp.org
/about-3gpp/partners). 3GPP is a group of six standards organizations from Asia, Europe,
and North America that proposed standards for GSM, GPRS/EDGE, HSDPA, HSPA+, and
LTE. LTE Advanced expands on LTE by allowing carriers to combine up to five
20-MHz-wide frequency channels and raise the maximum downlink data rate possible for
mobile cellular devices to 1 Gbps, albeit realistically a lot lower in urban centers, due to the
shared access nature of the technology. In addition, LTE Advanced standardizes the use of
very small, low-power cells called microcells and femtocells to further optimize frequency
reuse and allow more carriers to share the available frequency spectrum.
LTE was marketed as 4G, but was not originally considered a “true
4G” technology. Only LTE Advanced (LTE-A) is considered “true
4G.” However, the ITU bowed to pressure from North American car-
riers and now classifies LTE as 4G, but only when the definition
includes WiMAX and HSPAþ as well.
With the implementation of VoLTE, carriers will finally move from circuit-switched voice calls
and packet-switched data to a totally packet-switched network, further simplifying infrastruc-
ture deployment for the carriers. Once this happens, all cellular traffic will be IP based, similar

to VoIP, and the quality of voice calls will also improve dramatically, due mainly to more effi-
cient use of the available frequency bandwidth.
LTE itself was designed and developed for digital data transmission
only. VoLTE encapsulates digitized voice in an IP datagram in the
same way that VoIP does.
New frequency bands such as 3.5 GHz are also being made available in China and Japan. In
North America, the upper and lower portions of the 700 MHz band, originally used for over-
the-air television, is now dedicated to LTE with approximately 450 MHz of total bandwidth
available. The 500 to 800 MHz band is used in Europe. Figure 10-9 summarizes the technol-
ogy paths to 4G and beyond.
5G (fifth generation) cellular technology, while still not fully approved, is already being tested
by some carriers, as of this writing. The drive behind 5G is, once again, to enable carriers to
support an ever-increasing number of users per cell, and the first deployments are expected to
be as early as in 2020.
The FCC in combination with the ITU-R as well as other regulatory
organizations around the world are currently working to make more
frequency
spectrum
available
for
LTE
and
the
upcoming
5G
standard.
5G technology employs a blend of GSM, HSPA+, WiMAX, and Wi-Fi to make use of as
much spectrum as possible and in the most efficient way. This also means that 5G will be
able to offer a wider diversity of services to cellular subscribers and use higher frequency
bands that are not currently available to cellular carriers.
Current RF systems are limited to certain parts of the EM spectrum, and parts of it are only
used infrequently, so the designers of 5G are working with the ITU and several other organi-
zations, which in turn work with the regulatory authorities of all countries, to develop radios
that can take advantage of these additional seldom used parts of the spectrum by unlicensed
users, when the licensed users are not using their allocated frequencies.
One way to accomplish this is to use a new breed of software-defined radios, called cognitive
radios, that can “learn” and adapt to the RF environment; change their mode of operation
and frequency bands dynamically, dramatically increasing their spectral efficiency; and take
advantage of the flexibility and interoperability of the various wireless communication systems

they are able to use. Another key point in the design of 5G cellular networks is the ability of
many devices to communicate with each other, distributing the responsibility for processing
information and decision-making around the RF environment. The use of a much larger num-
ber of antennas, MU-MIMO, 256-QAM in small cells to ensure reliability, and the ability of
the radios to differentiate between indoor and outdoor environments by detecting signal
strength, along with integration of different technologies, will also help increase the efficient
use of the spectrum. As a result, 5G systems will be able to support a much larger number of
users per area, and is expected to support 4K and even 8K video in the future. When using
the cellular network, data rates should be comparable to those of LTE Advanced and VoLTE
but, of course, data rates will vary depending on which wireless system the mobile devices are
using at any given time. Table 10-2 summarizes the evolution of cellular technologies.

Digital Cellular Challenges and Outlook
Having one standard available worldwide and the steady growth in the number of users
eventually will lower costs for carriers, allowing them to deliver more competitive pricing and
services.
For more information on 3G, 4G, and 5G cellular technologies, visit
www.3gpp.org and www.umts-forum.org.
Carriers spend billions of dollars to build and continually upgrade their cellular networks.
The cost of leasing the necessary RF spectrum alone can be astronomical. In early 2001, for
example, carriers in Germany paid over $46 billion for licenses to use the spectrum. Carriers
in other nations face similar costs, and that’s just one element in building a modern cellular
network. Networks must be deployed, tested, managed, and maintained to keep customers
satisfied with the service. In addition, the cost associated with high-volume data connections
to the Internet runs into the millions of dollars per month. If 5G’s ambitious design is suc-
cessful, it might reduce the need for the wired telephone infrastructure, thereby saving car-
riers the cost of deploying and maintaining much of the cable infrastructure. The integration
of technologies will likely change the landscape for telephone and data users worldwide yet
again. The technologies you have learned about in previous chapters are definitely worth
keeping a close eye on in the upcoming years.
Satellite Broadband Wireless
Another WWAN technology that has been around for several decades is satellite communica-
tions. Satellites provide the world with global positioning systems (GPS), communications to
the remotest of areas on the planet, and radio transmissions and TV signals that can reach vir-
tually anyone anywhere on the planet in real time. Satellites have also played an important
role in WWAN data networks because they can deliver signals to any point on the oceans
that cover most of Earth’s surface, to the Arctic and Antarctic continents, and to remote and
mountainous areas where electricity and cellular phone transmission tower infrastructure
might not yet exist. Because of the complexity and cost of launching satellites into space and
placing them in the correct orbit, this is the most expensive of all wireless communications
technologies.
Although the use of satellites for personal wireless communications is fairly recent, satellites
have been used for worldwide communications for the past 50 years. Satellite use falls into
three broad categories. The first use is acquiring scientific data (e.g., measuring the radiation
from the sun) and performing research in space (e.g., gathering data from space telescopes).
The second use is looking at Earth from space. This includes weather and surface mapping
satellites as well as military satellites. The third category of satellites are those that are used
as reflectors to relay signals from one point on the surface of the Earth to another. This
includes communications satellites that reflect telephone and data transmissions, broadcast
satellites that reflect television signals, as well as navigation satellites. The three types of satel-
lites are compared in Figure 10-10.

Wireless communications falls under the third use of satellites.
Satellite Transmissions
Satellites generally send and receive on one of four frequency bands, which are known as the
L band, the C band, the Ku band, and the Ka band. These bands are summarized in
Table 10-3.
As you already know, frequency band affects the size of the antenna. Figure 10-11 compares
the typical sizes of antennas used for the four satellite bands. Note that in addition to the fre-
quency band, the size of the antenna would depend on the footprint of the satellite and its
signal strength at the sending/receiving location.

Class and Type of Service Satellites provide two classes of service: consumer class
and business class. Consumer class service shares the available bandwidth among the users;
business class service, the more expensive of the two, offers dedicated channels with dedi-
cated bandwidth.
Satellites that reflect signals back to Earth offer different types of service. They may be
designed for point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, or even multipoint-to-multipoint communi-
cations, as shown in Figure 10-12.

Modulation Techniques Satellites use a variety of common modulation techniques,
most of which were discussed in Chapter 2. Here are brief descriptions of them:
●
Binary phase shift keying (BPSK)—Shifts the starting point of a carrier wave by
180 degrees, depending on whether a 1 or a 0 is being transmitted
●
Quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)—Shifts the starting point of the carrier wave
by 90 degrees; transmits 2 bits per symbol
●
Eight-phase shift keying (8-PSK)—Like QPSK but transmits 3 bits per symbol
●
16-level quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM)—Primarily used for sending
data downstream; considered very efficient but less reliable, so it is not generally used
for upstream transmissions
Multiplexing Techniques Satellite systems employ two common multiplexing tech-
niques, FDMA and TDMA, along with some specialized techniques designed to maximize
utilization of these very expensive communications channels. Detailed coverage of these
specialized techniques is beyond the scope of this book, but here are brief descriptions of
them:
●
Permanently Assigned Multiple Access (PAMA)—One of the oldest techniques, in
which a frequency channel is permanently assigned to a user
●
Single channel per carrier (SCPC)—Assigns a frequency channel to a single source;
used for broadcasting radio stations, which are always transmitting
●
Multiple channel per carrier (MCPC)—Uses time division multiplexing (TDM) to
consolidate traffic from different users on to each carrier frequency; it is used for the
European digital video broadcasting standard and typically used in point-to-multipoint
applications
●
Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA)—Allocates bandwidth on a per-call or
per-transmission session between two or more Earth stations; can efficiently share the
pool of available frequency and time resources and permits full mesh routing, similar
to how a telephone company’s switch works, but requires more complex and costly
hardware
For TV broadcasting directly to the user (satellite TV), the set-top box
at the user’s home or office includes a utility that enables the instal-
lation technician to align the dish antenna with the satellite
antenna. The antenna needs to be initially positioned in a certain
direction and at a certain angle, then the technician uses the TV set
and set-top box and fine-tunes the antenna position until the strongest possible signal is
achieved.
Satellite Classification
Satellite systems are classified according to their type of orbit. The three orbits are low earth
orbit (LEO), medium earth orbit (MEO), and a class of high orbit satellites known as
352
Chapter 10

geosynchronous or GEO. MEO satellites also include the subclass of highly elliptical orbit
(HEO) satellites.
Low Earth Orbit Low earth orbit (LEO) satellites circle the Earth at altitudes between
200 and 900 miles (321 and 1,448 kilometers). Because they orbit so close to Earth, LEO
satellites must travel at high speeds so that the Earth’s gravity does not pull them back into
the atmosphere. Satellites in LEO travel at an average of 17,000 miles (27,359 kilometers)
per hour, circling the Earth in about 90 minutes.
Because LEOs are in such a low orbit, their area of coverage (called the footprint) is small,
as shown in Figure 10-13. This means that more LEO satellites are needed to provide cover-
age to larger areas, compared with MEO and GEO satellites. One LEO system calls for over
225 satellites for total coverage of the Earth.
LEO systems have a low latency (delays caused by signals that must travel over a long
distance) and use low-powered terrestrial devices (RF transmitters). It takes 20 to
Figure 10-13

40 milliseconds for a signal to bounce from a station on Earthbound station to a LEO, then
back to another Earth station.
LEO satellites can be further divided into Little LEO and Big LEO groups. Little LEO satel-
lites usually provide pager, satellite telephone, and some navigation. Using a Little LEO sat-
ellite, a user can make a satellite phone call from anywhere on Earth. In contrast, cellular
telephone services require the user to be within RF range of a transmission tower. Big
LEOs usually carry voice and data broadband services, such as wireless Internet access.
Some satellite Internet services provide shared downstream data rates of up to 400 Kbps
but require a telephone connection for upstream data to an ISP. Another LEO wireless Inter-
net service provides two-way data services with speeds of up to 500 Kbps. Two-way satellite
Internet users need a two-foot by three-foot dish antenna and two modems (one each for
uplink and downlink).
In the future, LEOs are expected to be in demand for three markets: remote rural conven-
tional telephone service, global mobile digital cellular service, and international broadband
service. The speeds for wireless access are expected to exceed 100 Mbps.
Today, many companies use satellite technology to reduce line costs. National drugstore and
supermarket chains, which usually have stores located in remote towns, sometimes use LEO
satellites to link remote stores with the head office and download sales and inventory infor-
mation at the end of each day.
Medium Earth Orbit Medium earth orbit (MEO) satellites orbit the Earth at altitudes
between 1,500 and 10,000 miles (2,413 to 16,090 kilometers). Some MEO satellites orbit in
near-perfect circles, have a constant altitude, and travel at a constant speed.
Because they are farther from the Earth, MEOs have two advantages over LEOs. First, they
do not have to travel as fast; a MEO can take up to 12 hours to circle the Earth. Second,
MEOs have a bigger Earth footprint; thus, fewer satellites are needed, as shown in
Figure 10-14. On the other hand, the higher orbit also increases the latency, which means
that the signal takes from 50 to 150 milliseconds to make the round trip between Earth to
the satellite and back down to the surface.

Highly Elliptical Orbit Highly elliptical orbit (HEO) satellites are a type of MEO satel-
lite, but with elongated orbits. The average orbit characteristics of a HEO satellite are about
the same as other MEOs; however, HEO satellites have a high apogee (maximum altitude)
and a low perigee (minimum altitude). In addition, HEO orbits can provide good coverage
for extreme latitudes. The orbits also typically have a 24-hour period, which means the
satellites dwell for a long time at a fixed point over the Earth. This means that with just
two satellites in the same orbit, one is always “visible” from any point on the ground.
Geosynchronous Earth Orbit These high-orbit satellites are stationed at an altitude
of 22,282 miles (35,860 kilometers). When a satellite reaches this altitude at a given speed,
it enters a kind of “sweet spot” and its orbit matches the rotation of the planet. This means
that it remains virtually fixed over a given location on the surface of the Earth and appears
to “hang” motionless in space. A few somewhat rare satellites orbit the planet above 63,333
miles (101,925 kilometers). Because of their great distance from the surface of the Earth,
geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) satellites can provide continuous service to a very large

footprint. In fact, only three GEO satellites are needed to cover the entire Earth (except for
the polar regions). Their high altitude causes GEO satellites to have high latencies of about
250 milliseconds and require high-powered terrestrial transmitting devices along with very
sensitive receiving equipment. GEO satellites are typically used for global communications
—such as TV broadcasting and weather forecasting. However, today GEO satellites are not
normally used for telephony or computer communications because of the one-quarter sec-
ond delay in round-trip transmissions, which is unacceptable to users. The distance of the
satellite from the surface of the planet causes this delay, and it affects the performance of
computer communications protocols like TCP/IP. However, GEO satellites can be used as
backup communication links in case major disasters affect the undersea optical cable com-
munications infrastructure anywhere on the surface of the planet. Figure 10-15 shows how
three GEO satellites can cover the entire planet. GEO satellites have also been used to moni-
tor compliance with the nuclear test ban agreements; they are also used by Russia to provide
satellite services to the polar regions.
Although GEO satellites are much more expensive to launch, they are an attractive option
because of their lifespan of 12 to 15 years. (The average lifespan of a LEO satellite is only
5 years.) Also, because their footprints are so large, they are much more efficient compared
to LEO satellites. LEO satellites spend a portion of their orbit over sparsely populated areas
where continuous coverage might not be needed. The ITU regulates GEO usage.
Some satellites, like the ones used for Sirius satellite radio (Radiosat),
follow a highly elliptical orbit called Tundra. This orbit is chosen
because it allows the satellites to provide better coverage at higher
latitudes. Geostationary orbits are only possible around the equator,
which would make it difficult to provide service across Canada and
the northern part of the United States.

Experimental Technologies
Satellites are vulnerable to disturbances on the surface of our sun and other outer-space phe-
nomena such as meteorites that can cause interruptions in communications or incapacitate a
very expensive satellite. The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
has experimented with solar-powered aircraft flying at extremely high altitudes, Google (Proj-
ect Loon) has launched experimental balloons that travel around the planet on the jet stream
(a weather phenomenon), and Facebook is experimenting with solar-powered drones. The
Google and Facebook projects are an effort to bring Internet connectivity to as many people
around the world as possible, at little or no cost to the users.

Satellite Technology Outlook
The fact that satellites can provide wireless communication service in areas not covered by
other WWAN technologies means that end-users and companies will continue to rely on this
technology, probably indefinitely. Today’s satellites enable airlines, merchant shipping com-
panies, and tourism operators to offer Internet access and voice calls to passengers and
crews across large oceans as well as near the poles and remote corners of the Earth where a
communications infrastructure does not exist. As with other wireless technologies, it is likely
that satellite technology will evolve, along with the experimental technologies just discussed,
to increase reliability and lower costs.
Chapter Summary
■The two main wireless wide area network (WWAN) technologies are cellular tele-
phony and satellite communications. These two technologies complement each other in
many ways and make it possible for users and businesses to connect to the Internet
and other networks from almost any location on the planet.
■In cellular telephone networks, the coverage area is divided into sections called cells.
Each cell includes one or more transmitters with which the mobile devices communicate.
■The transmitters and cellular phones operate at a low level of power, which allows the
signals to stay confined to one cell and not interfere with other cells. This means the
same frequency can be used in other, nonadjacent cells at the same time. Cellular
phones have special codes associated with them that identify the phone, the phone’s
owner, and the carrier or service provider.
■Some cellular phones use SIM cards to store the user account information and some-
times other information such as the user’s contacts. SIM cards can be moved among
different cellular phones, and the phones do not have to be reprogrammed to use the
same account and phone number.
■When a cellular phone user moves from a cell to an adjacent cell, the cellular phone
automatically associates with the base station of that cell. This is called a handoff. If a
cellular user moves beyond the coverage area of his cellular network, the cellular
phone automatically connects with whatever cellular network is in place in the remote
area. The cellular network in the remote area communicates with the one in the home
area and verifies that the user has a valid account and can make calls. This connection
to a cell outside a user’s home area is known as roaming.
■1G (first generation) cellular technology uses analog signals, is based on the AMPS stan-
dard, operates in the 800 to 900 MHz frequency spectrum, and uses FDMA. 1G networks
use circuit-switching technology and can transmit data at a maximum speed of 9.6 Kbps.
■2G (second generation) cellular technology can transmit data between 9.6 and
14.4 Kbps in the 800 MHz and the 1.9 GHz frequency bands and uses circuit-switched
networks. 2G systems use digital instead of analog transmissions. 2G systems employ
three different multiple-access technologies: TDMA, CDMA, and GSM. GSM, devel-
oped in Europe, uses a combination of FDMA and TDMA technologies.
■2.5G (2.5 generation) cellular networks transmit data at a maximum speed of
384 Kbps. The primary difference between 2G and 2.5G networks is that 2.5G
358

networks use a packet-switched technique to transmit data instead of a circuit-
switched technique. Voice calls still use circuit switching. Circuit switching is ideal for
voice communications but is not efficient for transmitting data.
■3G (third generation) cellular networks provide new and expanded capabilities and
data applications features to mobile users. Because 3G networks are based on purely
digital rather than analog technology and can transmit data at much higher speeds,
they allow always-on data connections.
■4G (fourth generation) cellular networks achieve data rates that are competitive with
wired communications. Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology can achieve data rates
as high as 1 Gbps. Many carriers worldwide are upgrading their networks to LTE and
beyond at an accelerated pace.
■5G (fifth generation) cellular technology is currently under development and is slated
to be approved in 2018. 5G is expected to be able to take advantage of multiple tech-
nologies, such as Wi-Fi and WiMAX, to support a significantly larger number of users
and higher realistic data rates. 5G is also expected to be able to support 4K and even
8K video over wireless links.
■Satellites used for wireless data connectivity employ simple modulation and multiplex-
ing techniques. Satellite systems can transmit point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and
multipoint-to-multipoint.
■LEO satellites orbit the Earth at a low altitude and at high speeds. They have a limited
footprint and low latency and use low-powered terrestrial transceivers.
■MEO satellites orbit the Earth at higher altitudes than LEOs but do not travel as fast
as LEOs and have a bigger Earth footprint, requiring fewer satellites. MEOs have
higher latency than LEOs.
■HEO satellites are a type of MEO satellite with a highly elliptical orbit, with a
high apogee and low perigee, and can provide good coverage in extreme latitudes.
A HEO satellite takes approximately the same amount of time to orbit the planet as
other MEOs.
■GEO satellites orbit at much higher altitudes than MEOs, and their orbits match the
rotation of the Earth, so they stay in the same position with reference to a point on
the ground. GEO satellites have high latencies and require high-powered terrestrial
transceivers. GEO satellites are used for global communications.

Real-World Exercises
The Baypoint Group (TBG), a company of 50 consultants who assist organizations and
businesses with issues involving network planning and design, has again requested your
services as a consultant. Telecom Argentina is a company that is licensed to provide
wired telecommunications services in the northern part of Argentina. The company has
contracted TBG to assist it with the selection and implementation of a new field service
system. The goal is to provide service technicians with wireless access to the corporate
network and a vast electronic library of technical manuals and schematic diagrams,
which would reduce or eliminate the need for staff to carry a large number of books and
drawings, especially while servicing equipment underground or when climbing on trans-
mission towers. In addition, this means that the technicians would be able to immediately
read and update the records for all the equipment, thereby avoiding massive amounts of
paperwork as well as potential errors and omissions. However, the company is having
trouble deciding on which technology to adopt—handheld cellular, tablets with 3G or
4G access, or laptops equipped with cellular cards. Provide a one-page report outlining
your recommendations for TBG.
Exercise 10-1
Create a presentation outlining the advantages for Telecom Argentina of using digital cellular
handsets or cellular wireless cards. Determine the ability of the smaller cellular handsets (as
opposed to notebook computers, which may be difficult to carry everywhere) to display standard
documents such as Word, Excel, and PDF files, and evaluate how this could help the company.
Because the group you will be presenting to is composed of nontechnical managers, be sure your
presentation is not too technical. Limit yourself to a maximum of 15 PowerPoint slides.
Exercise 10-2
Jose Riveras, one of the senior executives at Telecom Argentina, was convinced by your pre-
sentation. However, he recently heard about 4G cellular and wants to know how this tech-
nology will affect the company’s plans to purchase equipment now. TBG has asked you to
create another presentation for Jose that explains the different generations of cellular tech-
nology. Use the information you obtained in the Hands-On Projects above and also visit
mobiforge.com and search for “mobile user behavior statistics” to help you gather more
data to prepare your presentation.
Challenge Case Project
Telecom Argentina is unsure about investing in cellular phones, so it is considering
alternatives, including Wi-Fi tablets and laptop computers with the data preloaded
onto the devices. Working with three other students, form two teams of two peo-
ple, with each team selecting one of these technologies. Research in depth the
advantages and disadvantages of these respective technologies and how they
work. Hold a friendly debate in which each two-person team gives a 5-minute talk about the
advantages of its technology. After the talk, allow time for the others to ask questions.

Imagine that you are just making a quick stop at a local supermarket to pick up a
few grocery items. As you enter the store, you obtain a bag near the door. Then you walk
through the aisles and load the bag with the products you need. When you are finished,
you simply walk through an arch-like structure where the cash register should have been,
and then you exit the store. There’s no need to stop and pay for the products or even to
show anyone which products you purchased. You reach for your smartphone when it
beeps, and find that the grocery store just sent you a receipt by email.
While driving back home, you stop at a self-serve gas station to fill up the tank. You
reach for your smartphone again, activate an app, and bring the phone near the front of
the pump. The gas pump beeps and authorizes your purchase. When you are finished
pumping and replace the gas nozzle, your smartphone beeps again and displays the
receipt for the fuel.
Arriving home, you put your purchases in the refrigerator. A display screen outside the
refrigerator door is automatically updated with the contents, the expiration date of each
individual product, and the quantities of each product.
Although this example might sound like a futuristic dream, the standards and technology
that make it work are already in use. In fact, there is a huge number of potential applica-
tions for this technology in our everyday lives. In this chapter, you learn about how radio
frequency identification and near field communications work. You also learn about some of
the challenges related to the implementation of such systems.
What Is RFID?
As you learned in Chapter 1, radio frequency identification (RFID) is a technology developed to
identify “things” in a similar way that barcode labels are used to identify almost every single
off-the-shelf product anywhere in the world today. The difference between barcodes and RFID
is that RFID uses RF waves instead of laser light to read the product code. RFID stores product
information in electronic tags, which are devices that contain an antenna and an integrated cir-
cuit chip. RFID tags can store significantly more information than the barcode system. This
data, held in read-write or read-only memory, can include the date, time, and location where
the product was manufactured; the manufacturer name; and product serial number. In compari-
son, barcode labels typically include only an item’s stock-keeping unit or product number. Any
additional data about the product must be stored in a computer.
RFID technology is not new; it has been in use around the world, in one form or another, for
many years. In the late 1930s, the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy introduced a system designated
IFF (Identification Friend-or-Foe), which was implemented and used for the first time in the
Second World War, to distinguish Allied forces aircraft from enemy aircraft by use of special
codes that could be read by a friendly aircraft at a distance. Likewise, for many years, micro-
chips and antennas inside tiny capsules have been implanted under the skin of household pets.
These tags contain a numeric code that is registered in a centralized database by the company
that supplies the tags.
You might also be familiar with another type of RFID that is frequently used in retail stores to
prevent theft. After you pay for an item, a small tag attached to the product is run through a
368

powerful magnet at the checkout; the magnet disables the tag, preventing it from activating
the alarm as you pass near an antenna located at the store entrance.
What is new about RFID has to do with the standardization efforts of the International Orga-
nization for Standardization (ISO) and EPCglobal Inc. EPCglobalInc. is an organization
entrusted by industries worldwide to establish RFID standards and services for real-time, auto-
matic identification of products in the supply chain of any company anywhere in the world.
By publishing a single worldwide set of standards, it is possible for RFID to be implemented
and utilized in a global context. EPCglobal adopts the ISO 18000 series of standards for
RFID; these define the operating frequencies of the equipment and tags and include all of the
other relevant PHY and MAC layer specifications. The EPCglobal specifications concentrate
on defining services and higher-layer functions of the standards. In this section, you learn
about the hardware, software, and services that are required to implement RFID. For more
information about EPCglobal, visit www.gs1.org/epcglobal.
RFID System Components
Several components are required to implement an RFID system, connect it with a corporate
network, enable integration with existing business software, and ultimately connect with the
services that enable worldwide integration of a company’s suppliers, manufacturers, distribu-
tors, and transportation providers, that is, the supply chain. This section describes the most
common components required to implement an RFID system—the tags, antennas, readers,
software, and the EPCglobal network services.
Electronic Product Code (EPC) RFID systems make use of product codes and data
formats standardized by EPCglobal. The mission of EPCglobal is to make organizations
more efficient by making information about any kind of product available anytime and
anywhere. The standards published by GS1 enable users to track products from
manufacturing through to the end-user and beyond—in some cases products can be
tracked all the way to the recycling depot or trash heap, at the end of their usable life.
The Electronic Product Code (EPC) is a standardized numbering scheme that can be pro-
grammed in a tag, which in turn can be attached to any physical product. Think of EPC
as the evolution of the barcode or Universal Product Code (UPC), which you can find
today on most products.
Each EPC is a unique number or code that is associated with an individual product—a case,
box, or pallet, depending on how the owner or the customer wishes to identify products, so
that the items can be identified electronically. EPCs are usually represented in hexadecimal
notation. A sample EPC is shown in Figure 11-1.

The EPC is either 64 or 96 bits long. The 96-bit tags, the most common type, include the
following fields:
●
Header—This 8-bit field identifies the EPC version number.
●
Domain manager—This 28-bit field identifies the manufacturer of the product; it can
represent almost 268.5 million different companies.
●
Object class—This 24-bit field identifies a product’s stock keeping unit (SKU); it can
represent over 16 million different products for each company (e.g., each brand or size
of shampoo bottle produced by the same company as a different product).
●
Serial number—This 36-bit field identifies each instance of a product; it can represent
over 68.7 billion unique serial numbers.
A 256-bit version of the EPC might be defined in the future. All the
EPCglobal specifications for the PHY layer allow for the EPC to be
expanded without any changes in the protocol.
The structure of 64-bit and 96-bit EPCs is shown in Figure 11-2. Whether a manufacturer
elects to use a 64-bit or a 96-bit EPC code is dependent on the company’s individual needs
and that of its clients, but most tags produced today are 96-bit. The Header field identifies
which EPC format is being used, and the software (discussed later in this chapter) reformats
the tag’s data so that it will be compatible with the end-user’s business applications. Please
note that the diagram in Figure 11-2 is only intended to show that there can be different for-
mats; it does not go into specific details. Also, these illustrations are not drawn in the correct
scale based on the number of bits in each field.
RFID Tags RFID tags are also commonly known as transponders. The word is a combi-
nation of transmitter and responder. A typical RFID tag includes an integrated circuit that
contains some nonvolatile memory and a simple microprocessor. These tags can store data
that is transmitted in response to an interrogation (a transmission) from a reader or interro-
gator, the device that actually captures the data transmitted by the RFID tags.

There are two basic types of tags: passive and active. Passive tags are the most common
type; they are small, can be produced in large quantities at low cost, and do not require bat-
tery power. Passive tags use the electromagnetic energy in the RF waves transmitted by the
reader’s antenna to power the built-in chip so that it can transmit the information stored in
its internal memory back to the reader. Animal-tracking microchip implants, tags for asset
management, and access cards for security controlled doors and parking lots are examples
of passive tag applications. Figure 11-3 shows an example of a passive tag.
Active tags are equipped with a battery to power the microprocessor chip and memory.
Having their own power source means that these tags can transmit the signal farther away
than passive tags can; however, active tags have a limited life because of the battery. They
are also far more expensive than passive tags and therefore are used to track only high-
value items, such as an entire pallet, a vehicle, or a shipping container. An example of the
application of active tags is to track military supplies shipped around the world; they can
also be used for commercial applications. Some active tags are called beacons because they
can transmit on a periodic basis without receiving an interrogation from a reader.
A variation of active tags is the semi-active tag. This type of tag, also called a semi-passive
tag, uses a built-in battery to power the circuit only when a reader first energizes or excites
(powers) the tag. The energy transmitted by the reader activates the tag, which then uses the
internal battery to power its circuits and respond to the reader. The best example of this
type of tag is the device mounted in vehicles and used for electronic highway toll collection.
The batteries in semi-active tags usually last several years, given that they are only used
when the tag is activated by the reader’s electromagnetic field.
The size of the memory in a tag varies with the manufacturer and application, but is usually
between 16 bits (for storing temporary operation parameters) and hundreds of kilobits. The
tags are initially programmed with a unique identification code obtained from EPCglobal.
Any extra memory space in the tags can be used to record historical information about the
product to which the tag is attached, such as the health and vaccination records of cattle,
the temperatures that a product has been exposed to during shipping (using a sensor
attached or built in to the tag), manufacturing and testing dates, and calibration records for
test equipment.

Passive tags can be produced in flexible packages, also called smart labels. Smart labels
include an adhesive backing and can be attached to a box, the underside of a product cas-
ing, or a pallet. Smart labels can be used to track luggage in airports and trains, for exam-
ple. Because they use RF, the tags are not limited to being placed in a visible area or on the
outside packaging of a product. They can be read regardless of their position or orientation,
which is one of the major advantages of RFID over barcodes. The ability to read the tags in
any position avoids the difficulty store clerks sometimes have of getting the equipment at the
counter to read the barcode labels on products.
Yet another type of tag, called 1-bit tags, are passive devices used in some retail stores. They
do not contain a unique identification code, a chip, or any memory. They are simply used to
activate an alarm to prevent theft. Figure 11-4 shows a 1-bit tag and a passive tag applied to
the inside of a product package. These can be used for anti-theft or security, but the passive
tag can also be used for inventory control.
An emerging form of RFID is chipless tags, also known as RF fibers. Chipless tags do not
contain an integrated circuit or memory. Instead, they use fibers or other types of materials
that reflect a portion of the reader’s transmission signal back; the unique return signal can
be used as an identifier. The fibers are made of thin threads, fine wires, or laminates that
affect the propagation of RF waves. Chipless tags are typically used in applications in
which the tag needs to be hidden and very difficult to reproduce. One sample use is the
card invitations used for high-end events such as the Academy Awards (Oscars).
Chipless tags can be used to identify specific paper-based documents inconspicuously, which
means that a person handling the document is not necessarily aware that it is “tagged.” Chip-
less tags also perform better than other types of tags when attached to a metal surface or to a
container of liquid. Both cans and bottles present significant problems for most RFID systems

because metal surfaces can affect the propagation of RF waves and because most liquids atten-
uate the signal. Chipless tags can be read at greater distances than 1-bit or passive tags.
Sensory tags, as their name indicates, can be equipped with thermal, gas, smoke, pressure, tem-
perature, and a variety of other kinds of sensors to monitor and record environmental conditions,
liquid volume levels, or attempts to tamper with a product. Most sensory tags are considerably
more expensive than other types of passive tags, come in larger packages, and are usually
equipped with replaceable batteries that allow them to be used for longer periods of time.
To learn more about RFID and its applications, including sensory
tags, search YouTube for “RFID applications.”
The cost of a tag can vary greatly, depending on the type and number of tags purchased
over a period of time. In general, passive tag prices range between about $0.07 and $0.25
each. As the technology develops and the volumes increase, RFID manufacturers and users
expect the cost to fall well below $0.05 per tag. Sensory tags can cost between $25.00 and
$100.00 each, depending on the battery life and tag capabilities.
Table 11-1 compares the tag classes specified by EPCglobal.
Class-0 tags, which are not mentioned in the table, may still be in use in a few locations
around the world, but are generally considered obsolete. Class-0 tag communication proto-
cols are not compatible with the tag classes listed in Table 11-1, and not all tag classes can
be mixed and used in the same system.
Readers In addition to interfacing with the tags, RFID readers (or interrogators) connect
to the company’s network and transfer the data obtained from the tags to a computer. Some

readers can also write data onto tags. Readers that work with passive tags also provide the
energy that activates the tags. The read distance is determined by the size and location of the
tag and the reader antennas as well as the amount of power transmitted. The reader specifi-
cations are generally limited by regulations in different countries that specify how much
power can be transmitted in each frequency. Variations in regulations can result in incom-
patibilities between the equipment manufactured and licensed for use in different countries.
It is important to keep international standards and regulations in mind when designing and
implementing an RFID system that will be used to identify products worldwide; these are
generally available from the ISO and EPCglobal.
The frequency ranges and common applications of RFID systems are shown in Table 11-2.

RFID readers come in as many sizes and types as there are applications for this technology.
From left to right, Figure 11-6 shows three examples of RFID readers, each with its own anten-
nas. There is a fixed reader designed to be installed at a retail store entrance, a handheld reader
designed to be plugged into a computer’s USB port, and a self-contained, computer-based RFID
reader (top right) with tag examples.
Antennas In Chapter 4, you learned that antennas are responsible for converting the RF
energy from the transmitter into electromagnetic waves. The design and location of an
antenna can significantly affect the range of the signal and the reliability of the communica-
tions. RFID antennas used in tags are limited in size due to the dimensions of the tag itself.
Most tags are small, which allows them to be placed in a variety of different products and
packaging.
There are two main types of tag antennas: linear and circular. Linear antennas offer greater
range but less accurate reads. Circular antennas have greater read accuracy, especially in
applications in which the orientation of the antenna varies due to positioning of the pro-
ducts, but have a more limited range.
Larger antennas allow the tags to be read at greater distances than smaller antennas. How-
ever, remember that, as the frequency increases, the wavelength gets smaller and, conse-
quently, so does the antenna. Higher-frequency antennas can be made relatively small and
still allow the tags to be read at greater distances than lower-frequency tags with the same
antenna size. Conversely, to detect a higher-frequency signal and minimize attenuation, the
tag antenna needs to be approximately 10 to 20 microns thick (10 microns ¼ 0.0003937
inches). Lower-frequency antennas can be 2 microns thick. RFID tag design can be quite
complex, due to antenna size and thickness, and this can significantly affect read perfor-
mance. In passive tags, the antenna itself acts as the energy storage device, which supplies
electricity to the tag and allows it to respond to a reader. Figure 11-7 shows additional
examples of RFID tags.

Reader antennas have to be designed for the specific type of application. Whether the antenna
will be located at a retail store entrance for security reasons, near a warehouse shelf, or on a
refrigerator door, the type, size, shape, and location of the antenna are critically important to
ensure good readability and accuracy. No “typical” style of RFID antenna exists; the variety is
huge. For many applications, RFID antennas are custom designed and built.
To see examples of different RFID reader antenna types, visit www
.intermec.com/products/rfid/antennas/index.aspx or search the web
for “RFID antennas.”
Software The type of software used in an RFID implementation depends on the specific
application. Nevertheless, there are three basic categories of software components present in
every RFID system: system software, middleware, and business application software.
System software is usually stored in read-only memory (ROM) or flash memory and is pres-
ent in both the tag and the reader. It is executed by the microprocessor in each device and is

used to control hardware functions, implement communication protocols (including collision
control, error detection and correction, authorization, authentication, and encryption), and
control the flow of data between tags and readers.
Middleware is responsible for reformatting the data from the readers to comply with the
format required by the business applications used by the customer. It usually runs on a com-
puter that is implemented as a gateway between the readers and the other data-processing
equipment at the end-user company. Because each company likely uses different types of
business software, RFID middleware allows users to ensure that they can communicate
with the RFID equipment. Keep in mind that middleware is not usually sold as prepackaged
software, like Microsoft Office or Adobe Acrobat, for example. Instead, each company in
the business of providing RFID solutions usually writes its own middleware application soft-
ware or uses a customizable software package provided by the reader manufacturer.
Business application software is responsible for processing orders, inventory, shipments,
invoices, and so on. These types of applications usually rely on database software to store
and manage all the transaction records in a typical business.
EPCglobal Network Services To use barcodes, every retail business has to record in
a database the item’s UPC (barcode), the company’s internal product number (SKU) for
inventory management, a product description, the manufacturer’s name, the price, and the
quantity of items in stock. It then has to cross-reference the barcode and SKU so that this
information can be accessed by the barcode readers at the cash register. With RFID, because
the EPC already contains a reference to the manufacturer along with a product code, the
need for manually entering data for cross-referencing is reduced; the potential for human
beings introducing errors when manually entering this information into the database is less-
ened as well.
The manufacturer name is used to reorder products when the stock is low or depleted. With
EPCs, companies are able to acquire the manufacturer’s name over the Internet using a ser-
vice from EPCglobal called Object Name Service (ONS). Modeled after the Internet’s
Domain Name System (DNS), ONS is a mechanism for discovering information about a
product and related services. When a reader gets the EPC from a tag, it passes it to the com-
pany’s servers, which send it to ONS via the Internet. Upon identifying the manufacturer,
ONS responds with the URL of the Internet server where the product information is stored.
The company’s servers can then retrieve all the information about that particular product
and can use this for additional data processing.
If you are not familiar with how the Domain Name System (DNS)
works, read the information at http://computer.howstuffworks.com
/dns.htm.
Eventually, trillions of products from millions of companies will likely be included in the
ONS database. Like DNS, ONS is a worldwide-distributed database.
An additional component that enables companies around the world to exchange informa-
tion regarding their trade transactions is EPC Information Services (EPCIS). Similar to the
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) specifications that many large companies used to

complete paperless transactions, EPCIS will eventually enable large organizations to
purchase, invoice, and track product orders over the Internet, eliminating the need to send
paper documents by mail or fax. Figure 11-8 shows the five fundamental components of an
EPCglobal RFID system—tags, readers, middleware, business applications, and EPCglobal
services—and how they are logically connected.
How RFID Works
Describing how the different RFID tags and readers work would require an entire book, given
that these devices use different transmission techniques in each frequency band. This section
introduces you to the technical details of how two of the most common types of passive tags
and readers transmit and communicate with each other at the PHY and MAC layers: UHF
(400 to 900 MHz) and HF (13.56 MHz).

PHY Layer
A passive tag, the most common type, transmits only when it receives a signal from the
reader. The connection between a tag and a reader is called a coupling. RFID primarily uses
two types of coupling, depending on the application:
●
Inductive or magnetic coupling—This type is designed for tags that either touch
the surface of the antenna or are inserted in a slot in the reader’s case. In these
systems, the tags are typically used at a maximum distance of half an inch (just
over 1 centimeter) from the antenna. The basic difference between inductive and
magnetic coupling is the shape of the antennas.
●
Backscatter coupling—This type is designed for tags that can be read at distances
greater than 3.3 feet (1 meter) and up to 330 feet (100 meters) in some cases.
Backscatter is a reflection of radiation. Recall that passive tags are powered by an RF signal
sent by the reader. After the reader transmits data (the reader transmission itself supplies
power to the tag, so it can receive and decode the reader’s transmission), it then begins to
transmit a continuous wave (CW), which is an unmodulated sine wave. The CW is captured
by the passive tag’s antenna, and the tag uses the energy from the CW to supply power to the
chip so that the tag can respond to the interrogator. The tag essentially reproduces (reflects)
the same wave it receives from the reader, but it modulates this signal with the data by
changing the electrical properties and consequently the reflection coefficient of its own
antenna. This means that the antenna will transmit with more or less power, affecting the
amplitude of the signal reflected.
Backscatter modulation is based on variations of amplitude shift keying (ASK) or a combina-
tion of ASK and phase shift keying (PSK), both of which you learned about in Chapter 2.
The data is also digitally encoded to ensure that there will be enough transitions between
0 and 1 and vice versa to assist the devices in maintaining synchronization during trans-
mission. (In Chapter 2, see the section titled “Binary Signals.”)
The reader has separate transmitter and receiver circuits and antennas; and because it is a
powered device, it transmits a much stronger (higher-amplitude) signal than the tags. In
order to detect the modulated signal from the tag, the receiver in the reader compares its
own strong CW signal with the backscatter. The difference between the two is the data
sent by the tag.
Both reader and tag modulate the signal in amplitude by as much as 100 percent or by as
little as 10 percent. Ten percent modulation is more sensitive to interference and noise, but
the signal can travel farther. One hundred percent modulation is easier for the reader to
detect; but during the periods without a CW, the tags are not being powered, so the dis-
tance between tag and reader must be significantly reduced. In practice, the signal is mod-
ulated somewhere between 10 percent and 100 percent, given that neither of the extremes
is very usable. The modulated signal is a result of the amount of power generated by the
reader and the size of the antenna. Figure 11-9 shows a signal modulated at 10 percent
and at 100 percent. Note that the signals in the figure are not drawn to scale, in amplitude
or in frequency.

Communications between tag and reader are always half-duplex. Interrogators and tags do not
transmit and receive data simultaneously. To prevent interference issues from affecting the reli-
ability of RFID systems, and to allow for environments in which multiple readers are installed
in the same area (also called dense interrogator environments), the EPCglobal standards also
specify the use of frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) and direct sequence spread spec-
trum (DSSS) transmission. The latter systems are generally only used for advanced active tags.
HF Tag Communication
HF RFID passive tag communication uses a protocol called Slotted Terminating Adaptive
Collection (STAC), in which the tags reply within randomly selected positions or time intervals,
referred to as slots, which are the reply intervals used in the STAC protocol. The interrogator
transmits signals to mark the beginning and end of each slot, depending on the amount of data
requested from each tag. Figure 11-10 shows the concept of slots. Note that the slots are not
equal in size (the figure is not to scale). The number of slots is regulated by the interrogator
and is always a power of two. Some shorter slots may exist when there is no reply from any
tags, in which case the interrogator terminates the slot. The maximum number of slots available
is 512. The STAC protocol is used to prevent tag collisions in HF, and it is described further in
the section titled “Tag Collision Handling in HF.” Note that slot F is always present and signals
the beginning of the reply intervals. Slot F is the only one with a fixed size. It also ends automat-
ically, meaning that the interrogator does not signal the end of slot F.

UHF Tag Communication
UHF readers today support what is called Generation 2 (Gen2) protocols. Generation 1
(Gen1) protocols might still be used for tags and readers, but support for Gen1 RFID tech-
nology is quickly being discontinued.
The Gen2 protocol defines three techniques for communication between tags and readers. In
the first technique, a reader can select tags by transmitting a bit mask that isolates a tag or
group of tags. The bit mask works very similarly to the way network masks work in IP
addressing, by isolating subnets. In the second technique, a reader can inventory tags by iso-
lating them using a repetitive process (described later in this chapter). In the third technique,
once the EPC for a particular tag is known to the system, a reader can alternatively access
each tag individually. Gen2 readers can transmit with a lot more power and UHF systems
are designed to work at greater distances than HF.
Tag Identification Layer
When an interrogator initiates communication in an RFID system, there must be a way to
prevent every tag within range of the reader’s signal from responding at the same time. The
tag identification layer defines three methods that allow an interrogator to manage the popu-
lation of tags within reach of its signal: select, inventory, and access.
With the select method, an interrogator sends a series of commands to select a particular seg-
ment of the population of tags within its reach. This is done in preparation for an inventory
or for the purpose of accessing a specific tag. The selection is based on user-specified criteria,
such as a particular category of products from one manufacturer. Tags do not respond to
these commands. They simply set internal flags (bits) for responding to later transmissions. In
UHF, with the inventory method, an interrogator sends out a series of query commands to get
information from one tag at a time. As each tag receives an acknowledgment from the interro-
gator, it resets the inventory flag and does not respond to further inventory commands in the
same round. In HF, the interrogator simply waits for each tag to reply in a different slot. With
the access method, the interrogator sends one or more commands to multiple tags or
exchanges data with a single tag at a time after uniquely identifying the tag with a command.
The minimum amount of information contained in a tag’s memory is the EPC, a 16-bit cyclic
redundancy check (CRC), and a destroy password. The destroy password is a code pro-
grammed into the tag during manufacturing. After the destroy password is transmitted by
the reader, the tag is permanently disabled and can never be read or written to again. This
tag information structure is shown in Figure 11-11.

Tag and Reader Collisions
With a potentially very large population of tags, all tags could respond to a reader at the
same time. Depending on whether each product is tagged or not (in warehouses, only boxes
or pallets may be tagged), this would result in collisions and would prevent the reader from
identifying individual tags. LF tags and readers do not support any collision-handling mecha-
nism; therefore, LF systems can only read one tag at a time. This is not an issue when the
application is reading an access card used to open a door or reading cattle tags as the ani-
mals pass through a narrow corridor one at a time. However, for RFID to work in a ware-
house, in a store, or inside a refrigerator, the ability to read multiple tags is required, hence
the use of the following tag anticollision mechanisms.
Tag Collision Handling in UHF Because the reader initially might not know which
tags are present within the range of its signal, and because new tags could enter the reader’s
signal field from time to time, the reader can send a VerifyID command. However, if you
consider how shelves in a store or warehouse are typically organized, the tags within a cer-
tain reader’s field belong to certain groups of products. All tags within the reader’s field that
are the intended recipients of the verification command will reply with their EPC, CRC, and
destroy password. If the reader can identify at least one of these tags, it can proceed to select
a range of tags by sending a series of commands that instruct the tags about an upcoming
inventory. The process repeats until the reader has identified every group of tags within
range of its signal. The reader can also tell a tag or a group of tags to be quiet by sending
a special command.
This selection process can be compared to a teacher that meets her class for the first time at
the beginning of a semester and does not have a list with the names of all the students. To
identify each student, the teacher might begin by asking all students to call out their full
names. Initially, several students might reply at the same time. The teacher can then ask the
students whose last names begin with the letter A to call out their names. Again, she might
get more than one reply and not be able to single out a student. Next, she can request that
only those students whose last names begin with the letters AA call out their names. This
time, the chances of getting multiple simultaneous replies will be much smaller.
By repeating this process and refining the query, eventually the reader will have enough
information to be able to communicate with all the tags within a group. It then sends a com-
mand to an entire group to set an inventory flag. The next command instructs the tags that
the reader will begin an inventory round. During the inventory round, the reader sends an
inquiry to each individual tag. Once a tag has replied to an inventory query, it resets its
inventory flag and does not reply again until the reader announces the next inventory
round.
Tag Collision Handling in HF In HF systems, the reader selects groups of tags based
on the STAC protocol. Each tag uses its EPC, CRC, and destroy password to calculate a
number that becomes the slot number in which each particular tag will reply. The calcula-
tion uses the above parameters along with a random number generator in each tag. The
reader then begins an inventory round and waits for each tag to reply in its own time slot,
which prevents collisions. The ISO standard assumes that the number of potential collisions
in these cases will be less than 0.1 percent. If a collision does occur, thereby preventing the
382

inventory process from finishing correctly, the reader selects a smaller group of tags using
the process described earlier, under HF tag communication, and repeats the inventory
process.
Reader Collisions Reader collisions can also happen in dense reader environments. If a
reader does not receive any replies, it assumes a reader collision has occurred, which means
that the tags could not understand the last reader transmission, and backs off for a random
period of time before listening for network traffic and attempting to transmit again. In the
meantime, the tags can communicate with another reader.
MAC Layer
The RFID MAC layer is responsible for establishing and communicating the transmission
parameters—such as transmission bit rate, modulation type, operating frequency range, and
frequency hop channel sequence—that are used for communications at the PHY layer. The
reader sends commands to the tags establishing the communication parameters for each com-
munications session. The MAC layer parameters for different types of tags—HF, UHF, and
others—differ. These variances usually don’t pose a problem because it is unlikely that an
end-user company will use multiple types of tags in a single environment or application.
Data Rates
As you learned earlier, the amount of data stored in a typical passive RFID tag is relatively
small. The lack of a power supply along with low processing power, both of which help
keep the tag cost low, means that the resulting data transmission rates for the tags are also
low. Some of the EPCglobal standards specify a minimum number of tags per second that a
reader should be able to access rather than a specific data rate.
The specifications for HF tags call for readers to be capable of reading 200 tags per second.
For tags containing just an EPC, the actual rates will likely be between 500 and 800 tags per
second.
The UHF specifications define the tag-to-reader data rate as twice that of the reader-to-tag
rate. In North America, the allowed tag-to-reader data rate can be up to 140.35 Kbps. In
Europe, due to the RF signal power limitations, the maximum data rate is only 30 Kbps.
Conversely, reader-to-tag data rates are 70.18 Kbps in North America and 15 Kbps in
Europe. The Gen2 protocol specifications support much faster tag isolation, which results in
tag read rates as fast as 1,600 per minute in North America and 600 per minute in Europe.
Near Field Communication
Now that you have a pretty good understanding of RFID, it’s time to find out about near field
communication technology. Near field communication (NFC), as you learned in Chapter 1, is
a technology that provides short-range wireless connectivity between devices such as smart-
phones and tablet computers. NFC is based on the ISO 18092 RFID technology standard
and ISO 21481, also called NFCIP-2, which was prepared by Ecma International, a not-
for-profit standards organization for information and communication systems, such as the
Ecma-352 standard.

Ecma International was originally called the European Computer
Manufacturers Association. In 1994 it changed its name to Ecma
International to reflect its global scope and activities, and “Ecma” is
no longer considered an acronym.
As an introductory text, this book aims to discuss only the most well-
known protocols used in NFC communications. There are several
other ISO standards that apply to the wireless interface and proto-
cols. For more information, visit www.iso.org and search for “NFC.”
You may also wish to visit the NFC Forum at nfc-forum.org.
NFC requires little or no configuration by users, and devices connect automatically as soon as
they are brought to within a minimum of 1.6 inches (4 centimeters) of each other. This tech-
nology is able to transfer data between devices or read passive NFC tags at rates of between
106 and 424 Kbps.
NFC originated from and is compatible with FeliCa, a smart card protocol created by Sony
that is still in use in parts of Asia, and the MIFARE protocol developed by Philips; both
protocols were designed for payment systems. The NFC Forum, founded in 2004 by Nokia,
Philips, and Sony, created a set of specifications that builds on HF RFID and also enables con-
tactless two-way data transfer between two powered devices—beyond the typical one-way
communication that happens between a smart card and a reader.
NFC can be used with a handheld device or card, for the following purposes:
●
MasterCard PayPass transactions, Visa payWave, and other types of payment card
transactions
●
Electronic discount coupons and prepaid or gift cards
●
Exchanging business cards, schedules, and maps between handheld devices
●
Transferring images, videos, and other types of files between devices or between a
device and a printer
●
Debit card or prepaid card transactions
●
Electronic public transport system tickets
●
Airline tickets
●
Automatic pairing of Bluetooth devices without entering a PIN number
●
Automatic Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi Direct configuration
●
Storing and using secure, encrypted identification numbers, electronic signatures,
access codes, and passwords
●

tocols, and security and other notable implementations of NFC.

NFC Operation Modes
Many different models of Android smartphones and tablets today are NFC-capable and are
typically equipped with a low-power interrogator that can read tags. Some Android devices,
such as Google Nexus tablets, are also able to write to NFC tags. Apple iPhone 6 and newer
models require an NFC-compatible SIM card to enable the use of Apple Pay. The technology
uses inductive coupling between two loop antennas. An NFC-capable device can operate in
the following modes:
●
Listen mode—The initial mode of an NFC device, in which the device essentially acts
as a passive tag.
●
Poll mode—When an NFC device generates a CW and probes for other devices within
its communication range of 1.6 inches (4 centimeters).
●
Reader/writer mode—When an NFC device in Poll mode behaves like an interrogator.
In this mode, devices can transmit commands to other devices.
●
Card emulator mode—When an NFC device in Listen mode behaves like a smart card.
●
Initiator mode—When an NFC device in Poll mode changes the communication
protocol to talk to another device that only supports half-duplex communications,
using the NFC-Data Exchange Protocol (NFC-DEP).
●
Target mode—When an NFC device is the target of an initiator that can only
communicate in half-duplex mode, using NFC-DEP.
The Initiator and Target modes are unique characteristics of NFC that differentiates it from
RFID in the sense that NFC-capable devices are able to exchange many different types of
information with other NFC-capable devices. RFID, on the other hand, is limited to commu-
nications between readers and tags.
NFC Tags and Devices
The NFC specifications currently define four types of tags. Each type of tag is designed for
a different purpose and has slightly different capabilities, including the amount of memory.
Different tag types also communicate using slightly different frame formats, at different
speeds, and use different digital encoding (NRZ, NRZ-I, etc.) and different synchroniza-
tion and modulation methods. Thus, the first thing an NFC-capable device in Poll mode
needs to do is identify the type of tags or devices that are within range of its magnetic
field.
Some tags can be written to only once; others can be protected by a password so that they
cannot be written to again unless they are unlocked. The memory on the tag can be used to
store URLs, business cards, pictures, brochures in PDF files, etc. This makes NFC far more
flexible, useful, and accurate than the Quick Response (QR) codes that are very popular
today. Depending on the type, NFC tags can store anywhere from 48 bytes to 32 KB of
information. Virtually everyone can purchase NFC tags and, with the right type of app
loaded on their phones or tablets, might be able to program the tags using a smartphone or
a tablet (see www.tagstand.com). You can find more information about NFC tags at kimtag
.com/s/nfc_tags.

The best way to stay up-to-date with which smartphones and tablets
currently support NFC, along with the latest news of the industry, is
to browse the NFC World website at www.nfcworld.com.
NFC Communications
NFC-capable devices transmit in the 13.56 MHz unlicensed frequency band (the same as for
HF RFID) and modulate the signal using ASK or a combination of ASK and PSK over a
range of approximately 7 to 14 KHz of RF bandwidth. Modulation varies between 10 per-
cent and 100 percent, depending on the type of tag. The digital signal is encoded using a
method similar to the return-to-zero (RZ) technique you learned about in Chapter 2, which
provides enough signal transitions to help ensure good synchronization between wireless
devices and between devices and tags.
To transfer data between two smartphones or tablet computers, NFC employs the Data
Exchange Protocol (NFC-DEP). A DEP message consists of one or more records. Each record
is encapsulated in an RF frame that contains a header and a payload. The header includes the
following fields:
●
Identifier—This optional field is used to define the type of payload carried by the
record.
●
Length—This field can be one octet long for short records but is normally four octets
long. A payload length of 0 is used to indicate an empty message (no payload field)
and signals the end of the current NFC-DEP communication session.
●
Type—This field indicates what type of data is carried within the payload and will be
used by the receiving device to decide which application will process the data.
For example, pictures are automatically stored in the photo app and URLs are sent to the
browser app on the receiving device. An error is generated if the device cannot support the
data type specified in this field.
Because data transfer between two smart devices like a digital
camera, tablet, or smartphone using NFC-DEP is limited to a few
hundred Kbps, when transferring large amounts of data such as pic-
tures or music, NFC is used only to configure and initiate a Bluetooth
or Wi-Fi Direct connection, which is then used to transfer the data.
Figure 11-12 shows the components of a DEP message and how they relate to one another.

RFID and NFC Challenges
It is easy to imagine a thousand other applications for RFID that have the potential for mak-
ing life and business easier, safer, and simpler. However, the technology does face some chal-
lenges, as you learn in this section.
RFID Impact on Corporate Networks
One of the major challenges for the implementation of RFID systems is the impact of the vol-
ume of data on a company’s network. With manual or barcode-based inventory control sys-
tems, the amount of data that is collected and transmitted across a company’s network is
usually limited to the on-hand quantities of particular products along with the UPC code for
each product. However, RFID systems are usually implemented so that inventory can be
counted by simply activating the readers. To ensure that the shelves in a large retail store
are always fully stocked with products, for example, the system can direct the readers to
interrogate all of the RFID tags every 5 minutes or so. This scanning can add a lot of traffic
to an organization’s network.
To get a sense of the amount of increased traffic on a company’s network, consider a sce-
nario in which a large national retailer tags each of the 10,000 individual items in each of
its 1,000 stores and then interrogates all of its readers from a central head-office location
every 15 minutes. At 17 bytes per EPC code alone (remember that with the 96-bit EPC, the
minimum information from a tag is about 136 bytes), this would generate 170 MB of data
for a single read. It would fill a CD-ROM in 1 hour and create 5.44 gigabytes of network
traffic in a typical 8-hour business day. In only 1 month, the total volume of traffic would
swell to 1.632 terabytes of data. Although most of this data will be processed and the dupli-
cate data discarded, we are still talking about a significant increase in the volume of data on
the network.

Network Availability in RFID Assume that such a system is eventually implemented
and that a company relies on it to replenish inventory automatically. In this case, network
availability becomes a serious factor in the store’s ability to serve its customers. As retailers
become dependent on RFID systems to enhance service and reduce costs, greater network
bandwidth must be available. The retailer’s network must also be reliable—that is, it must
remain functional. (Recall that 99 percent availability means that the network is expected
to be down for about 80 hours per year, which is usually an unacceptable amount of time
for most businesses.) Any downtime that occurs during business hours can quickly become
a serious problem. For most companies, these demands will translate to expanding and add-
ing redundant equipment and communications capabilities to their existing networks, a
costly undertaking at best.
In grocery stores and large retail establishments, products are out of stock 7 percent of the
time, and some popular items are unavailable 17 percent of the time. This inventory short-
fall can represent significant losses for retailers. To combat this problem, many retailers
order more products than they need or can sell out of one location. As a result, supermar-
kets in particular often are forced to discard perishable products, which leads to higher
costs for consumers. Item-level tagging for product tracking is a means to reduce or elimi-
nate these types of problems.
Storage Requirements for RFID Large banks and corporations already are saddled
with archiving tremendous amounts of historical data—potentially, tens or even hundreds of
terabytes of data for each company. In addition, new laws designed to protect consumers
and investors, such as the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, require companies to accumulate and
securely store even more information, in some cases indefinitely. The huge volume of data
that can be generated by RFID systems significantly increases the need to store information
accurately and reliably.
Since 2003, cattle producers in Canada and Europe have been using
RFID to track their animals’ histories. As of January 1, 2005, each
head of cattle in Canada must have an RFID tag that stores such
information as any health issues, vaccinations, movement (locally or
to a new herd), and production of milk and offspring. Records must
be kept, even on slaughtered cattle, for many years afterward.
RFID Device Management Even without RFID in place, businesses are finding it a
challenge to manage the huge numbers of devices on their networks. Network management
software does not come at a low price. Even for small networks with fewer than 1,000
devices, the cost of network management software can easily escalate to well over half a
million dollars. As networks expand, the need to remotely monitor and manage servers,
routers, switches, and RFID readers from a central location becomes a critical factor in a
company’s ability to ensure greater network availability. Add to this the task of managing
and tracking hundreds, thousands, or even millions of RFID tags, and you can imagine the
security issues related to wireless RFID transmissions. Managing RFID systems can quickly
become a very complex and costly job.

Security Considerations for RFID and NFC
The growth of RFID and the development of relevant worldwide standards have given rise to
a large number of security and privacy concerns. There are solutions for RFID-related secu-
rity issues, but they are not perfect fixes, and challenges still exist. For example, the growth
of NFC is still being driven by its application as an electronic wallet that can be used in
place of credit and debit cards as well as by its applications in public transportation tickets,
passwords, and so forth, and concerns from users are increasing. Recent developments in
multicore processors will no doubt enable the use of more sophisticated encryption algo-
rithms that can help ensure the security and privacy of device users. NFC transmissions are
harder to interfere with or capture, due to the short distance between devices; nevertheless,
it is theoretically possible to access information from a user’s smartphone or tablet if you
have a reader that is sensitive enough to capture information from a greater distance.
To see how an attacker could exploit security flaws in RFID, search
YouTube for “RFID hacking.”
It is possible to read the information from a tag or RFID/NFC-enabled credit card, but finan-
cial organizations would not allow these systems to be used by their customers unless there
were enough security mechanisms in place to prevent financial loss. Ultimately it is the finan-
cial organizations and the retailers that have to absorb any losses that might result from
someone stealing your credit card number and name. The financial organizations employ a
large variety of tactics to prevent theft. Users are not made aware of these tactics for the sim-
ple reason that making this information available would invite additional attempts to defeat
the security measures.
Debit and credit card agreements clearly state that customers are not responsible for the
charges if their card information is stolen. No personal information other than the person’s
name and credit card number, which are already displayed on the front of the card, is stored
in the RFID chip. Keep in mind that additional personal information may be stored in a tab-
let or NFC-enabled cellular phone. This is one of the reasons why when using a smartphone
app such as Google Wallet or Apple Pay for payment, the user must first verify who she is,
either by entering a password or fingerprint scan. Financial institutions worldwide have
deemed RFID and NFC safe enough to be used by the general public, and we should remem-
ber that these institutions are not in the business of losing money. Nevertheless, it remains
the responsibility of the users to monitor their bank accounts for suspicious transactions,
even though it is likely that your bank will block your cards and call you before you have a
chance to notice anything wrong.
In the United States, some of the concerns about RFID are centered on privacy. Tag data
used for a product after it is purchased could be linked to the consumer and used for targeted
marketing. Businesses could collect that data about a person’s purchases and use it for a
number of applications that would potentially interfere with the consumer’s privacy. This is
not that different from data being captured from the use of debit and credit cards; the differ-
ence is that RFID-generated data could possibly be captured without the user being aware of
it. However, to associate this data with a particular person would require obtaining informa-
tion from debit and credit cards or by following the user home. Most of the privacy concerns

that people have regarding RFID are due to not having enough information about the
technology.
Security related to RFID readers falls under the wired network security policy. Reader-to-tag
and tag-to-reader communications have the same vulnerabilities as any wireless network, the
only exception being that capturing the tag-to-reader communications can be very difficult.
Tag transmissions occur at very low power levels; readers are also transmitting a CW during
tag-to-reader communications. Once a tag is installed on a product or packaging, it usually
cannot be removed without permanently damaging the tag; however, it is still possible to
tamper with the data in a Class-1 (read/write) tag by recording over the existing tag data or
by adding new data. Powering a mobile reader capable of emitting a high-power signal
would require heavy batteries. This could be done from inside a vehicle, but then the mobility
of the reader would be severely limited.
Most passive tags do not support authorization or encryption security methods because they lack
their own power supply, use chips with low processing power, and are low in cost. Shielding
stores and warehouses to prevent RF signals from coming in or going out might solve some of
the problems associated with unauthorized access from outside the building, but that can be a
very expensive proposition. In addition, once consumers take the products to their homes or
workplaces, someone using an interrogator nearby could still expose them to privacy violations.
RFID tags do not carry the type of information that would be so critical and useful as to
require drastic measures to prevent anyone from capturing the information contained in the
tags’ memory storage. In the case of credit and debit cards, there are far easier, but no less
criminal, ways to capture the information contained in RFID/NFC chips, so the use of remote
sensing equipment, which requires a very complex setup, is unlikely. Nevertheless, both
financial institutions and users should continue to be aware of the need to protect against
losses and identity theft.
Data in tags can be locked and require a password for the tag to be used again. By using a
combination of the EPC, CRC, and built-in destroy password, tags can also be permanently
disabled. Locking the tags would make it very difficult to use the information from the tag
throughout the distribution channels. Permanently destroying the tag, either by issuing a kill
command or by physically damaging it, would prevent a retailer from using the tag again if
the customer returned the product, limiting the functionality of the RFID system. Physically
destroying tags would also prevent the consumer from taking advantage of features like the
smart refrigerator application described at the beginning of this chapter.
A blocker tag is a device that can be used to simulate the presence of a virtually infinite number
of tags. Blocker tags can be used to disable unauthorized readers from accessing the information
from a selective group of tags by sending so many responses that an unauthorized reader cannot
differentiate between the blocker tag and a legitimate tag. Blocker tags also offer an alternative
solution that minimizes some of the issues described earlier in this section, and at a much lower
cost. After getting his purchase home, the consumer can optionally destroy the blocker tag so he
can continue to use the legitimate tags in, say, his smart refrigerator.
Security for RFID and NFC systems is a complex topic, and there is no single solution that
addresses all possible situations. Applications of RFID and NFC far outweigh the potential
problems, however. RFID and NFC usage will continue to expand, and eventually these tech-
nologies will be present in nearly every aspect of our lives. Educating users and implementing

legislation related to data collection and privacy will play a big part in raising consumers’
comfort level with the technology, just as similar measures have increased their comfort with
the Internet.
Chapter Summary
■Radio frequency identification (RFID) stores information about an item’s manufac-
turer and the date and location of production in electronic tags that include an
antenna and a chip.
■Standards being published by EPCglobal Inc. allow RFID to be used worldwide.
■RFID systems are composed of electronic tags, readers, antennas, software, and EPC-
global network services. The format of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) is defined
by the EPCglobal standards. The EPC is either 64 or 96 bits long and includes a code
that refers to the manufacturer, a stock-keeping unit number, and a serial number.
■RFID tags are also known as transponders. Typical tags include a microprocessor and
memory. Tags are accessed by a reader device that captures and processes the data.
There are two basic types of tags: passive and active. Passive tags are the most com-
mon type. They do not have a power source and rely on the electromagnetic energy in
the RF waves transmitted by the reader to power their microprocessors. Active tags
are equipped with a battery and can cost upward of $20 per tag. The battery usually
limits the life span of active tags. Semi-active tags also include a battery. However, the
battery is used only when the tag is activated by a transmission, which helps the bat-
tery last many years.
■Tags can be produced in flexible packages called smart labels with an adhesive back-
ing. They can be affixed to product packaging, pallets, or to the product itself. They
are also used to track passenger baggage. Tags are not limited to being placed in a
visible area and can be read in virtually any position.
■Retail stores sometimes use 1-bit tags to prevent theft. These tags do not include a
unique identification, a chip, or any memory; they are only used to activate an alarm.
Chipless tags use fibers or materials that reflect a portion of the reader’s signal with a
unique pattern that can be used as an identifier.
■Sensory tags are equipped with thermal, smoke, or other type of sensors used to mon-
itor environmental conditions to which a product may have been exposed during ship-
ping and storage. The cost of a tag can vary, depending on the type. Most passive tags
cost between $0.07 and $0.25. Class-1 tags are read/write. Some tags can be written
to, whereas others are read-only.
■A reader, also called an interrogator, communicates with both the tags and the corpo-
rate network. Some readers have the ability to write data to the tags. Readers also
provide the energy to activate and power passive tags. Readers and tags operate in one
of four frequency bands: 135 KHz (LF); 13.56 MHz (HF); 433 MHz and 860–930
MHz (UHF); and 2.5 and 5.8 GHz (ISM).
■There are two types of tag antennas: linear and circular. Linear antennas have a better
range, but circular antennas achieve more reliable reads.

■RFID software includes system software, which controls the functions of the tag and
reader hardware; middleware, which is responsible for reformatting the data to meet
the requirements of the business applications; and the programs that companies use to
process business transactions.
■The connection between a reader and a tag is called a coupling. Inductive coupling
tags need to be placed within a half-inch of the antenna. Backscatter coupling allows
tags to be read at distances of 3.3 to 330 feet (1 to 100 meters). Backscatter is a
reflection of the reader’s signal modulated with the tag data. In order to power the
tags, the reader, when not transmitting, sends out a continuous wave. Backscatter
modulation is based on variations of ASK and PSK. Communication between tags and
readers is always half-duplex.
■In HF RFID, the tags use time slots to communicate with the reader. The number of slots
is always a power of two, and the communication is always controlled by the reader.
Most RFID tags are passive and are not able to initiate communications with the reader.
■RFID has the potential for significantly increasing the amount of traffic and storage
requirements in the corporate network. With the implementation of RFID systems,
network availability and device management become even more critical.
■NFC is a wireless communication technology, based on RFID, that allows enabled
devices to communicate at short distances. Unlike RFID, NFC allows devices to trans-
fer files, pictures, videos, URLs, and business cards between smartphones and tablet
computers. NFC-enabled devices can also read and write to passive tags. NFC tags
typically have greater storage capacity than RFID tags.
■With the implementation of wireless technologies such as RFID and NFC, there are
many security and privacy concerns. A tag can be locked or destroyed (electronically
or physically), but doing so can limit its functionality. Blocker tags may offer an alter-
native solution. User and consumer education, along with government legislation,
should help raise the comfort level and allow RFID usage to expand.

done about increasing security and privacy protection. Write a report focused
on one of the issues you have identified.
Project 11-3
Many manufacturers and retailers of nonperishable goods already use RFID
technology. Several products come already tagged, and if you have recently
purchased a high-value product in a computer store, you may find some
tags in the box. Go to several large stores located in a local shopping area
and ask the stores’ staff whether they are currently using RFID to protect
against theft. Do they use it for security only or do they also use it for inven-
tory control? Be conscious of some of the security issues with RFID and
identify yourself as a wireless communications student before you ask any
questions regarding their use of RFID. Keep in mind that some job opportu-
nities might be available through contacts that you initiate through this
project; therefore, be sure to present yourself in a professional manner. If
possible, make a list of the types of tags used, such as passive semi-active,
etc. Write a report on your findings.
Real-World Exercises
Exercise 11-1
Instrument Rentals Inc. (IRI) rents electronic test instruments to a variety of heavy indus-
tries. The instruments are usually rented for a period of 1 week to 1 year. IRI offers a
customer guarantee that its instruments will always be available and calibrated to factory
specifications. With 120 locations across the country, the company ships the instruments,
checks their calibration upon arrival, and recalibrates them if necessary. It also often services
the instruments at the customer’s site, which can be in an oil field or inside a mine, to main-
tain them in top working condition. Finally, it checks every instrument when it is returned at
the end of its rental period.
To prevent delays, minimize errors, and avoid Internet access problems, IRI would like to
store each instrument’s calibration records, its technicians’ names, the rental/travel log,
and other relevant information stored with the instrument itself. Toward this end, the
service-call software that the technicians have in their notebook computers needs to be able
to automatically read a record, display it on the screen, and update it on the instrument
record storage device. All the instruments are leased by IRI from the manufacturers for a
period of 3 years. When a lease expires, IRI wants to be able to look at the records for that
particular instrument and make a decision whether to replace it with a new model or extend
the lease to prevent interruption of service to its customers. As a well-known RFID and NFC
expert, you have been asked to recommend which of these two technologies would be the
right solution for its needs.
Prepare a PowerPoint presentation (consisting of 10 to 15 slides) that lists the advantages
and disadvantages of RFID and NFC for this type of application, and specify the type of
tags and devices that IRI should acquire, should it decide to go ahead with this project.

Exercise 11-2
IRI has decided to go ahead with the project and has asked you to provide a proposal (five
pages maximum) specifying all the equipment that will be required to add this technology to
1,000 of its most expensive test instruments. There are two technicians per location, but
only one will be equipped to service the equipment in the field. The other technician will be
servicing equipment in the office.
Your proposal should include pricing for the tags (including about 100 replacement tags), a
portable reader, a fixed reader, middleware, and other equipment. If required, IRI’s IT staff
will be in charge of reprogramming the middleware to interface with the company’s
in-house database. Keep in mind that if the project is successful, it may be expanded within
6 months to a year to cover IRI’s entire instrument asset base, which consists of more than
10,000 instruments.
Challenge Case Project
The trade union to which the technicians at IRI belong has sent a letter to the
company expressing concerns about the privacy of its members, given that the
company intends to include the name of the technician who last serviced a par-
ticular instrument in its RFID tag. Now, the company has asked you to become
involved. A team of three people from IRI will research the union’s concern, including check-
ing state regulations. It will then organize a meeting so that all the parties can discuss the
matter.
In groups of six, form two teams of three members each—one team representing the union
and the other representing IRI. Research the issues just outlined and engage in a friendly
debate regarding the union’s concerns. The union team may need to do added research so
that it is prepared to defend its members’ rights.

Predicting how an idea or technology can be used requires vision, but it is not without
its challenges. When Alexander Graham Bell made the first-ever telephone call between two
Canadian cities about 22 miles apart, many people dismissed it as an interesting yet useless
technology, because the regular post office worked so well at the time. Likewise, when the
first handheld cellular phone call was made, some people questioned who would want to
make and receive calls while moving around. We all know what happened to both of these
technologies, as well as others that did not “make it.”
Even with vision, predicting how technologies might be used is a challenging task. Many
wireless technologies are being used today in ways that surprise even the original developers.
Wireless communications have grown so much and so fast that frequency bands are becom-
ing overcrowded and the standards organizations are always looking to develop new ways
to solve these challenges. There is an ever-growing demand for technologists and RF engi-
neers with solid knowledge, who can design, install, troubleshoot, and find solutions for
wireless issues, regardless of how technically advanced and automated the hardware and
software might be. Wireless data communication continues to expand into new areas, creat-
ing new challenges, users are constantly demanding more wireless freedom and mobility,
and standards organizations continue to work on creating new open wireless standards.
Short-range technologies like Bluetooth for headsets and portable speakers, and ZigBee for
lighting and environmental control, can be relatively simple to install and operate and
require little user intervention or technical support after initial setup and configuration.
Cellular and WiMAX demand a higher level of involvement from designers and field tech-
nologists to ensure users enjoy a reliable, secure, and stable environment. Although residen-
tial Wi-Fi installations usually do not require specialized skills, deployment in large-business
environments is often far more complex. For example, wireless signal propagation presents
specific challenges to office buildings, sports stadiums, cruise and merchant ships, passenger
aircraft, and manufacturing environments. Security can also be a constant challenge.
This chapter begins with an introduction to the Internet of Things (IoT), and then provides
an overview of the ever-expanding ways wireless technologies are being deployed and used
in different fields. Although it does not attempt to predict future uses for wireless data com-
munications, the aim of this chapter is to provide a broad perspective of where wireless is
today and a glimpse of where it might go from here.
The Internet of Things
Wireless technologies coupled with powerful single-board computers (SBCs) and microcontrol-
lers the size of a credit card (and often smaller), are enabling a large number and variety of
sensors to be installed in a multitude of devices and locations and connected to the Internet
via WLANs or cellular technology. This Internet of Things has actually been around for
some time, and its expansion to cover a larger variety of sensors and devices is probably inev-
itable. Wireless technologies are set to become one of the major enablers of this phenomenon.
Contrary to what some people believe, the Internet of Things (IoT) does not refer solely to
small “smart devices.” It is really about the type and amount of data that can be collected
from a multitude of smart sensors, transmitted to servers, and analyzed in real time or saved

for historical analysis. The IoT has the potential of providing us with far more in-depth
knowledge of the world around us, so we can better manage it and take any necessary or cor-
rective actions sooner. IoT applies to virtually all the topics discussed in this chapter.
Estimates vary, but between 50 and 100 billion “things” could be connected to the Internet by
the year 2020. Consider the simple case that most water, electrical, and natural gas meters in
homes today still need to be read once a month by a person physically accessing the meters in
each house. Data on total electricity consumption for a particular distribution area can be eas-
ily obtained at the utility company, but more detailed information requires individual meter
readings. If these meters can be read in real time and the information transmitted and updated
automatically, the power utility companies would have a much better idea of where and when
consumption is changing, and this would lead to better planning, as well as potentially lower-
ing costs and benefitting everyone. Utility companies in many cities are already upgrading to
wireless systems that transmit the readings automatically, but widespread deployment will
probably wait until the industry selects one standard and wireless IoT network connections
are more widely available.
Check out the wide assortment of tiny, low-power SBCs, microcon-
trollers, and sensors available today. Start at www.adafruit.com, and
search for “IoT,” then you can expand your search to explore micro-
controllers at www.arduino.cc and SBCs at www.raspberrypi.org and
search the web for “Intel Edison.” The assortment is so large that
this book would have to devote an entire chapter to list all of the available choices.
Recent IoT Developments
LoRa is a wireless technology that enables low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) for
machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, that is, devices that communicate with other
devices instead of with human beings. LoRa consists of a mix of long-range, low-power con-
sumption and secure data transmission devices and gateways. Due to the low duty cycle of
sensors, meaning that most collect data at lower rates, LoRa gateway devices that receive
transmissions from multiple sensors can be powered by batteries that last between 5 and 10
years. LPWAN equipment can be added much like a new IP network switch to a carrier’s cel-
lular network, but LoRa alone is not expected to be able to handle all IoT applications and
the volume of data. For example, within a home, Wi-Fi and ZigBee might be used instead,
and in remote areas, WiMAX, satellite, and cellular networks can cover a much wider
range. For reliability reasons, sensors can also connect to multiple LoRa gateway devices
and the servers that manage the network can filter redundant transmissions. LoRa devices
can also be bidirectional and incorporate actuators to control devices such as traffic lights
and parking lot gates, for example.
To learn about LoRa equipment that is already available, start at
www.semtech.com or check the products page at www.lora-alliance
.org.
LoRa networks operate at lower, usually license-exempt, frequencies. In North America,
LoRa transmits in the 902 to 928 MHz ISM band using sixty-four 200 KHz downlink

channels and eight 500 KHz uplink channels, plus an additional eight 500 KHz downlink
channels. In Europe LoRa uses the 867 to 869 MHz band with a total of 10 channels. The
LoRa specification covers OSI Layer 1 only and currently specifies the use of chirp spread
spectrum (CSS) modulation, which has been used in military applications for several decades,
because CSS supports long-range communications, as well as being resistant to interference
and to multipath distortion.
Chirp spread spectrum modulation is based on FSK. Each bit is transmitted as a frequency
that sweeps from the lowest to the highest in the allocated channel. CSS supports data rates
from 0.3 to 50 Kbps in LoRa, which should be enough for the majority of IoT devices.
Figure 12-1 shows a typical LPWAN.
Although Cisco, IBM, HP, and others are members of the LoRa
Alliance (www.lora-alliance.org), which was founded in early 2015
and is a promising technology, a more detailed discussion of this tech-
nology is beyond the scope of this book. For more information, check
the white papers available at the Alliance’s website and on the web.

Applications of Wireless Data Communications
Because of the well-known advantages of using wireless technologies, such as productivity
increases in corporate networks and Internet access from virtually anywhere and at any time,
and in spite of the challenges of RF interference and security, wireless communication is now
a part of almost every aspect of our daily lives. It is helping to improve access to services pro-
vided by practically all types of businesses and areas of endeavor, so let’s look at some of
them in more detail.
Healthcare
Wireless technologies are being used to enhance the ability of healthcare providers to monitor
patients, as well as vastly improving the quality of life of the patients themselves.
Administering the correct medication is a major concern in the healthcare industry. It is esti-
mated that incorrectly administered medication results in hundreds of thousands of medical
emergencies annually. Typically, printouts of prescriptions are posted in the pharmacy area
of a healthcare facility. As the medications are dispensed for delivery to a patient, they are
crossed off the list. However, because the paper record cannot always be updated immedi-
ately, there is a possibility that a patient could get an extra dose of medication before an
order for a new or changed medication has been processed. This potential problem necessi-
tates duplicate documentation, with nurses first checking the printout to determine the medi-
cation and dosage to be given, then noting on paper that the medication was actually given,
and later entering the data into the hospital’s database.
Wireless point-of-care computer systems based on smartphones, tablet computers, or
wireless-equipped computers mounted on movable carts allow medical staff to access
and update patient records immediately. Hospitals are using portable devices with bar-
code scanners or RFID and a wireless connection. Healthcare professionals can immedi-
ately document a patient’s medication administration in the computer while moving
from room to room. The patient’s barcoded or RFID-enabled armband is scanned, and
all medications that are currently due for that patient are brought up on the screen. The
medications to be administered are sealed in pouches that can be read by a barcode or
RFID device connected to the computer. Nurses identify the medications before opening
the package. An alert immediately appears on the screen if the wrong medication or
incorrect amount is selected. After administration, the nurse indicates through the wire-
less network that the medication has been given, electronically signing the distribution
form.
The system immediately verifies that medication is being administered to the correct patient
in the correct dosage, which eliminates potential errors and documentation inefficiencies.
The documentation process now takes place at the bedside, where care is delivered, which
improves accuracy. In addition, all hospital personnel have real-time access to the latest med-
ication and patient status information.
Gone are the days when doctors and patients had to wait for photographic X-ray film to be
developed and sent to the right office or patient room. Doctors can view full patient diagnos-
tic tests and results while at a patient’s bedside, using a mobile device.

In 2004, Baycrest, a center for geriatric care in Toronto, Canada, was
one of the first hospitals in North America to implement a computer-
ized physician order entry system. The system lets doctors order tests,
exams, and medications directly from a patient’s bedside using the
WLAN from a handheld device and has helped dramatically reduce
errors and omissions. Physicians can also check the patient’s records and charts in the hospi-
tal’s health information system, in addition to viewing MRIs, X-rays, etc.
Mental health patients can be fitted with Wi-Fi monitoring devices or RFID tags, and their
movements can be tracked within the healthcare center, increasing patient safety. A real-time
location system (RTLS) can be used to detect if a patient wanders outdoors or falls on the
floor and alert the hospital staff immediately. In addition, RTLS can be used to monitor the
location of doctors and nurses, as well as medical equipment, such as blood pressure and heart
rate monitors, making access to everyone and everything much quicker, especially in case of an
emergency, in addition to tracking assets and preventing equipment theft. RTLS systems can
also be used to monitor staff and patient movement throughout a hospital to monitor and help
prevent the spread of infectious diseases, one of the most serious problems faced by hospitals.
Doctors and nurses no longer have to be paged over a PA system, nor do they have to be in
an office or nursing station to access lab results. Doctors can also consult with specialists while
at a patient’s bedside, and the specialists can be more easily reached, no matter where they are
in the hospital or elsewhere. Figure 12-2 shows examples of patient and staff RTLS tags.
For more information on RTLS systems, see www.airistaflow.com,
www.sonitor.com, and www.aeroscout.com or search the web for
other companies.
At the Pan American games in Toronto in 2015, a Cisco Telepresence
system was deployed to allow specialists to examine injured athletes
remotely, while another doctor was present on location to assist. This
dramatically reduced the amount of time it would take if the patient
had to wait for the specialist to travel sometimes dozens of miles to
reach the venue where the athlete was injured during competition. Although the system
installed was not wireless, similar deployments can use an 802.11ac wireless connection.

Patients can also be outfitted with monitoring devices and their vital stats can be accessed by a
doctor from a mobile phone or tablet, regardless of the time of day or location of the patient
or doctor. The data can be transmitted via the cellular network or Wi-Fi. Non-critical-care
patients who need to be checked periodically are then free to move around a hospital or even
go home and resume their daily activities, or maybe even travel, while being remotely moni-
tored by their own healthcare provider. For an example, see www.airstrip.com.
The elderly or patients who have vision challenges can use mobile devices or their own
smartphones equipped with RFID readers to identify medications fitted with RFID tags. This
might also prevent people from taking the wrong medicine or incorrect dosage, which is a
frequent challenge. When a patient simply touches the medication package with a reading
device, the device reads the tag and tells the patient (using simulated speech) the name, dos-
age, and time when the medication should be taken.
People who are at risk for falls and living on their own can wear devices that are activated if
they fall or if they simply press a button. The device connects to a gateway attached to the
WLAN in the home, which immediately notifies emergency services via the Internet or tele-
phone. The emergency services attendant can then attempt to speak directly with the client
before sending help, if necessary.
For tracking a patient’s critical medication intake, pills are being fitted with wireless transmit-
ters that send a signal to a home wireless router to notify a healthcare provider when the pill
has been swallowed by the patient. Tiny cameras fitted inside a pill can wirelessly transmit
images from inside the patient’s body, helping doctors diagnose some types of health pro-
blems and avoid exploratory surgery. Although the cost of some of these items may be high,
it is still significantly lower than the cost of exploratory surgery and hospital stays for the
patients.
Visually challenged individuals can use a cane that is equipped with GPS, cellular, and Wi-Fi
connectivity. This has the potential to assist these folks in gaining more independence and
freedom to move around; more easily locate transit stops, offices, and retail locations; these
smart canes can also notify relatives of their location at any given time, via cellular networks.
Disposable surgery supplies and medication containers are also tracked using RFID. The item
is scanned when used during surgery and a “smart” disposal container reads the tags when
the supplies or tools, such as needles, are disposed.
Education
Wireless technology is ideal for schools. An instructor can create a classroom presentation on
a laptop at home, then carry it right into the classroom. The instructor does not necessarily
have to plug and unplug cables to attach to the campus network. Instead, the device connects
to the school’s WLAN and can even connect to multimedia display projectors wirelessly,
using 802.11ac or WiGig. Teachers can also distribute handouts directly to students’ wireless
devices and conduct pop quizzes in which students submit their answers directly on their
devices. This can reduce or eliminate the need for paper tests and enable instant results for
both students and teachers.
The wireless connection also frees students from having to go to a specific computer lab or
the library to get on the school’s computer network. They can access the school network

wirelessly from practically any location on campus or from anywhere they can connect to the
Internet.
Wireless technology translates into a cost savings for colleges. Traditional classrooms become
fully accessible computer labs without the expense of additional wiring and infrastructure.
Colleges no longer have to consider the expense of adding open computer labs for students
because everyone can access the resources from any building on campus, indoors or out-
doors. Collaboration tools are also being used to allow students to attend live lectures
remotely, using a mobile device. Students can attend classes and even interact with the tea-
chers from virtually anywhere in the world, at any time, via the Internet.
The Connected North project is a very good example of a remote
classroom application. Working with Cisco Canada and satellite com-
munication providers, Connected North provides isolated northern
communities in Canada with access to classroom resources and tea-
chers that students in these communities would seldom, if ever,
have access to, using Cisco’s Telepresence. For more information, visit www.connectednorth
.org and explore the site and video about its work.
Much more can and will be done with wireless technologies in schools. For example, large
campuses can be difficult to navigate. Bluetooth devices such as Apple’s iBeacon can be used
to direct students to the right location on campus. Small, inconspicuous, low-power iBeacon
devices installed throughout the campus transmit information to Bluetooth-equipped smart-
phones, which is then used by an app to display the right location map and directions, via
the campus WLAN. The app on the smartphone provides the location and directions as the
person passes near each iBeacon device.
Search YouTube for “Classroom of the Future” to watch a few
videos and get a new perspective on some of the technology ideas
being envisioned for education. Note that some of the collaboration
technology shown in the videos for sharing files and documents is
already a reality today from Cisco and other vendors.
Government
Many cities have deployed broadband and Wi-Fi wireless networks to let residents, city
employees, contractors, visitors, and utility staff access the Internet, as well as collect and
transmit data to central databases. For example, building inspectors can look up drawings
and update permits and other data from the construction sites. City employees can locate
and monitor municipal vehicles. Visitors to the city can access the Internet in key areas,
which promotes tourism and stimulates the local economy.
Allegany County in western Maryland saved millions of dollars by deploying an IEEE 802.16
network instead of fiber optics. The county’s AllCoNet2 project uses 16 radio towers to pro-
vide Internet connectivity to schools, libraries, and government buildings in remote county
areas where a cable infrastructure was not readily available. To avoid conflict with Internet
service providers, the excess capacity of the county’s broadband network is sold at a reduced
rate to commercial users, which further stimulates economic development in the region.

The city of Fredericton in New Brunswick, Canada, deployed a system called “Fred-eZone”
that covers the entire downtown business district and uses a mix of technologies. An IEEE
802.16 wireless broadband backhaul network connects all the major points, and an IEEE
802.11 WLAN is available in the major downtown streets as well as in restaurants, bars,
and many other retail businesses. These options provide free Internet access from laptops,
tablets, and smartphones. In 2005, the city won a major award for innovation as a result of
this project.
Similar city-wide 802.11 deployment projects have been decommissioned and abandoned due
mainly to the high cost of keeping the technology up-to-date. However, other cities are begin-
ning to deploy wireless mesh networks to interconnect cameras, public transportation sys-
tems, and other services.
Search YouTube for “City of Mississauga: Transforming with the
Internet of Everything” for a perspective on how this town is using
wireless networks to improve services to its residents.
In Lima, the capital of Peru, city authorities are using an innovative method to deal with
problems of illegal dumping of garbage. They are equipping vultures with GPS tracking
devices and GoPro cameras. The birds are attracted to garbage; when they fly over an
area where garbage should not be dumped, the GPS identifies the location and the GoPro
cameras are used to attempt to identify the culprits. The program is being partially funded
by USAID.
Home Automation
Several manufacturers today offer wireless products that enable control of lighting, heat-
ing, ventilation, air conditioning, drapes, security systems, door locks, and a variety of
home appliances from a smartphone or tablet while in the home or from anywhere in the
world where a Wi-Fi or cellular connection to the Internet is available. The newer systems
use ZigBee or Wi-Fi to enable remote control of light switches, wall sockets, as well as
environmental controls such as the Nest system. Lighting and alarm controls can help
keep the home secure by turning lights on and off at preset times to make the home look
“lived-in.” Door locks connected via ZigBee or Wi-Fi networks can be opened, locked,
and monitored from anywhere via the cellular network. Family members or contractors
can be given temporary or permanent access to the home and eliminate the potential dan-
gers of a lost key. No need to leave a spare key under the carpet, the flower pot, or in a
lock box.
Home control systems are also more “green,” given that lights, etc., can be automatically or
remotely turned off and the environment can be adjusted even when no one is home. Appli-
ances such as ovens, slow-cookers, pool heaters, and others are already available that can be
controlled from your smartphone. Other wireless devices are available that can display your
energy consumption and enable utility meters to be read remotely, saving carbon emissions
by eliminating the need for a person to go from house to house to read the meters. What
the future will bring in this area is dependent upon consumer demand, but it will certainly
be interesting to follow.

(see www.schlage.com) and Weiser (see www.weiserlock.com) to
learn more about smart electronic locks.
Home Entertainment
A number of manufacturers have introduced wireless products designed to enhance the home
entertainment experience. From wireless speakers to media players, game consoles, DVD
players, televisions, digital video recorders (DVRs), and multimedia personal computers,
wireless networking capability is enabling people to distribute all forms of digital media
throughout the home. It is now possible to locate a TV set anywhere and stream video and
audio from other locations around the house. Current and upcoming wireless technologies
such as 802.11ad have the potential to eliminate the cables required to interconnect multime-
dia devices. If movies or music are stored in your mobile devices, it is possible to transmit
them wirelessly to your audio system or TV using Apple AirPlay, Google Chromecast, and
other similar systems. Many devices like the Amazon Echo are voice-enabled, allowing you
to use voice control for entertainment functions as well as home automation.
IEEE 802.11ad promises to bring many more innovations in connectivity for home entertain-
ment devices. It is the only technology able to support 4K and the future 8K video casting
between devices and, even though its maximum distance is limited to 30 feet (10 meters) or
less, its compatibility with 802.11ac makes it the ideal technology for video and audio cast-
ing applications within a room in the home or school.
IEEE 802.11ay, which you learned about in Chapter 8, could provide even greater support for
wireless TV broadcasting and might even eventually reduce or eliminate the need for fiber to
the home, which is very expensive to install. 5G cellular and the latest microwave technology
supporting 2 Gbps or higher will also play a significant part in this wireless ultra-high defini-
tion TV availability, particularly in areas where fiber infrastructure does not yet exist.
Search the web for more information about devices like Google
Chromecast, Amazon Fire, Apple TV, Roku, and similar devices.
Transportation
Private passenger cars, buses, trains, and commercial airlines already offer Wi-Fi connectivity
using the cellular networks and satellite communications. Transport trucks using GPS are now
being monitored using cellular and satellite technologies, increasing safety and reducing losses.
The next technology frontier, currently under research and development, is vehicle-to-vehicle
communications. Tesla cars are already using cellular networks and Wi-Fi to connect and
update the software used to control all the car systems. Vehicle-to-vehicle communications is
expected to make transportation safer. Vehicles will be able to communicate with other nearby
vehicles, detect and communicate road and driving conditions, and warn nearby vehicles to
prevent accidents and even to help save fuel and reduce carbon emissions. Research on these
technological advances is currently being conducted at several universities and companies
around the world.

Visit the www.rfidjournal.com website and search for “Transit” to
read about how RFID is being used to track vehicle maintenance as
well as for electronic fare collection.
Cities are beginning to deploy systems that can warn drivers about traffic conditions and sug-
gest alternative routes that can reduce congestion for passenger cars, buses, and transport
vehicles. The system can also suggest alternate routes for public transit riders.
In the recent past airlines moved from a few displays along the passenger cabin to individual
flat screens offering on-demand content. More recently, many airlines are modifying their
equipment and offering on-demand content over Wi-Fi on a passenger’s own tablet or smart-
phone, via dedicated free apps. Tablets can be rented by passengers who do not have or
carry their own devices. This has the added benefit of saving a significant amount of weight
and complexity of wiring in each aircraft, which, in turn, saves the airlines money.
You can check out the details of the in-flight entertainment system at
www.westjet.com as an example.
Smartphones are quickly becoming an integral part of automobiles and light trucks. Manu-
facturers are replacing CD drives, which are mechanical and prone to failures, with Bluetooth
connections to smartphones, because a large percentage of people today carry their media
library on their mobile devices. Vehicles equipped with rear-seat entertainment systems also
offer owners the ability to simply connect their own iPads and Android tablets. GPS and
maps on smartphones are more powerful and frequently more up-to-date than dedicated
GPS systems, so maps and favorite locations saved on the owner’s smartphone can also be
displayed in the vehicle’s console screen.
A Bluetooth adapter can be plugged into the vehicle’s On Board Diagnostic II (OBD II)
connector to display diagnostic and performance information the vehicle’s engine and other
sensors. Connected vehicles with Internet access can transmit information about location,
how much fuel you have, and if the car is locked. An OBD II system can also be used instead
of a key or remote key fob to open the vehicle’s doors. Industry experts expect that your
smartphone will be able to detect a distracted pedestrian’s smartphone and warn the driver
to prevent accidents. Smartphones will also assist in vehicle-to-vehicle communications to
help increase safety.
Many cities now provide vehicle owners with the ability to pay for parking spots via a dedi-
cated app. If your parking time is about to expire, the app will send you a warning, so if nec-
essary you can pay again, to extend your time.
Office Environments
Thanks to wireless technologies, employees in all lines of work today have access to the data
they need to help them be productive and make decisions from anywhere around the office.
In addition to data accessibility, wireless technologies allow businesses to create an office
where the traditional infrastructure doesn’t exist. Typically, an office space must be wired
Applications of Wireless Data Communications

with computer cables for network connections and telephone wires. With wireless technolo-
gies such as Wi-Fi, that expensive cabling infrastructure, which is expensive to install and
difficult to troubleshoot and modify, is no longer required. This means that an office can be
created in a very short period of time with minimum expense. For example, a hotel confer-
ence room that might not have the infrastructure to support a wired network can be quickly
turned into a wireless networked environment. During office renovations or reorganization,
employees can move to another location in the building or to a completely different place
and can be connected immediately, saving businesses the expense of rewiring the entire
office.
Online collaboration is one of the keys to office productivity today. Many vendors now offer
a range of sophisticated collaboration tools that allow people to share documents or their
device screens, as well as a nearby video display, easily and simply. Meeting rooms can detect
the presence of a participant’s mobile device and automatically turn on displays and voice
links to initiate a meeting, greatly simplifying and speeding up the connection.
Search the web for “Cisco Intelligent Proximity” to learn about what
can be done with collaboration technology today.
Event Management
Managing spectators attending a sporting event or concert can be a daunting task. Each
attendee has a ticket, and there are special passes for the press and team officials. However,
tickets can be lost, stolen, or counterfeited. Attempting to identify a stolen or counterfeit
ticket as thousands of spectators are waiting to be admitted has until now been almost
impossible. But several large arenas and stadiums are now turning to wireless systems to
facilitate this process.
Event tickets are printed with a unique barcode and have an RFID tag embedded that is then
scanned at the venue’s point of entry using handheld or integrated turnstile hardware, which
in turn is connected to a wireless network. The network instantly validates the ticket and
then sends a signal back to the turnstile that permits the patron to have access to the venue.
This technology is made very difficult to reproduce, can prevent the use of counterfeit tickets,
and can also be used to identify stolen or duplicated tickets.
The wireless point-of-entry turnstiles can provide organizers with a real-time look at traffic
flow, thus helping a venue to more effectively manage its staff and determine where addi-
tional people might be needed. Advertisers can also tailor their marketing based on who is
entering at which gate on wireless display screens installed near the entry points. Figure 12-3
shows an example of a concert attendee scanning an RFID-enabled ticket.

In addition, wireless technologies are changing the entertainment experience itself. In several
major stadiums, wireless transmissions of in-progress game statistics are available to fans in
the stadium with a smartphone or tablet computer. Fans can also view instant replays of the
event they are attending or watch segments and results from other games around the country.
In the Arizona Cardinals’ football stadium, fans can use their wireless devices to play fantasy
football or order concessions and have them delivered to right to their seats.
Event tickets can often also be loaded on to Apple Wallet and, as of the release of the iPhone
6, together with an NFC-enabled SIM card, be used to scan at turnstiles to access certain
events. Industry shows and conferences are making almost exclusive use of RFID-enabled
passes for attendees. These passes can be scanned by a wireless device at each exhibitor’s
booth so you can receive more information via email, instead of carrying paper brochures.
Travel
Because wireless technology creates mobility, the travel industry was one of the first to embrace
it widely. Wireless global positioning systems (GPS) that tie into emergency roadside assistance
have become standard features on many automobiles sold today. Satellite radio transmission of
over 150 music and talk stations solves the problem of losing a station outside its transmission
range. Satellite radio is a subscription service, meaning that users pay a monthly fee for the priv-
ilege of listening to the stations without any commercial interruptions. The OnStar roadside
assistance service uses GPS and cellular technology to link the vehicle and driver to a central

service center. Users can also use the system to make phone calls using the cellular network. The
OnStar system was originally available only for GM vehicles, but electronics and auto acces-
sory retailers now sell it to the general public as OnStar FMV (For My Vehicle), with a user
interface built into the rearview mirror (see Figure 12-4).
Verizon and other carriers, as well as some automobile associations,
also offer roadside assistance plans supported by cellular networks. See
www.verizonwireless.com/solutions-and-services/roadside-assistance/.
Airport terminals are likewise turning to wireless technologies. Most large airport terminals in
North America are equipped with Wi-Fi that passengers can use while waiting for their flights.
For a nominal fee (or at no cost in some airports, such as Pearson International in Toronto,
Canada), they can also surf the Internet or read email as well as check in or view flight schedules.
Many airlines have installed WLANs on their planes, offering wireless Internet capabilities to
passengers on cross-country or long-haul flights, supported by satellite communications and
even on short-haul flights, using 4G cellular networks. Like their Earth-bound counterparts,
these passengers can access the Internet or view their corporate data and email from their
seats while in flight.
City transit systems are also “going wireless.” People in Finland can purchase bus, train, and
movie tickets (not to mention a can of soda) without ever needing to show a piece of paper or
any cash money. They can pay for the ticket from their phones and the cost is debited automat-
ically from their bank accounts or credit cards, and in most cases they simply present a two-
dimensional barcode or QR code on their phone screens when entering a cinema or bus. Tram
tickets in Amsterdam, Holland, and monthly passes in Toronto, Canada, are other examples.
To use them you simply wave the ticket by a box placed near the doors when you board and
when you exit the vehicle. The units make a sound to indicate that your ticket is still valid or
to let you know that you need to purchase a new one if your current one has expired.

Passports are currently being issued with embedded RFID tags, which speeds up the trip
through immigration. You can also now check in via smartphone, before arriving at the air-
port, especially if you only have carry-on luggage, which helps save time standing in-line at
airline check-in counters. The boarding pass, including the departure gate and seat number,
along with its associated QR code can be displayed on the smartphone screen and read by
desktop or wireless handheld devices at security checkpoints and prior to boarding the air-
plane. Most people can usually find their smartphones but might more easily misplace a
paper or card boarding pass.
Delta Airlines recently spent $50 Million US Dollars to install 4,600
RFID readers and 3,800 bag tag printers to better handle and track
the 120 million items of passenger luggage it checks each year at air-
ports around the world. In addition, for frequent flyers, Delta has also
issued an estimated 1.5 million permanent tags in the past two years.
These tags can be programmed with the passenger’s flight destination at the check-in counters.
Sports and Fitness
Sports equipment such as baseball bats, golf clubs, basketballs, and soccer balls are now
being outfitted with sensors that can help players improve the way they play the game and
help coaches analyze the motion and effectiveness of a bat swing, for example. This equip-
ment can provide immediate feedback to the player through a smartphone or nearby com-
puter. Apps and attachments are readily available in Google Play and the Apple store.
You are, no doubt, familiar with the large number of smart fitness tracking bracelets, apps,
and gizmos that people can purchase to track their exercise routines, prompt them to exercise
more, track sleep patterns, etc. Most of the apps communicate with smartphones and upload
the data via cellular or Wi-Fi to a website. If you choose, you can then compare your perfor-
mance with that of your friends.
Many sports and fitness devices today are based on an ultra-low-power 2.4-GHz wireless
technology that is proprietary, supported by a special interest group, and openly accessible
to manufacturers, called ANT. Originally created in 2003, the ANT protocol is currently
used in hundreds of cycling and fitness devices and has also been incorporated in medical
equipment and IoT devices. ANT-compatible devices are typically designed for a maximum
range of about 100 feet (30 meters), but this can be easily extended by combining ANT
with other technologies such as 4G.
For more information about ANT-compatible technology, check
www.thisisant.com.
People who practice yoga now have a tool to help them achieve the correct form and alignment
by wearing smart fitness pants. The pants guide the person by providing gentle vibrations, as
well as transmitting data to a smartphone that displays an image of the body position along
with an indication of which areas of the body need to be adjusted to achieve the perfect
results. The clothing can be machine washed several times before it needs to be replaced.

Construction
Although at first glance the construction industry might not seem to be a prime candidate for
wireless technologies, in reality it benefits greatly. Special rugged tablet computers allow engi-
neers and architects to review drawings and plans at the job site. One challenge for builders
is that each construction phase must be completed before the next one can begin. For exam-
ple, if the concrete footings for a new building cannot be poured, then the entire project must
be put on hold. This series of events often means idle construction employees and last-minute
schedule adjustments. Information from the job site, such as a tardy subcontractor or a prob-
lem with materials, could be relayed back to the main office for rescheduling of workers to
other sites to prevent idle time.
Because foremen are often at multiple sites during a day’s work, filing daily payroll paper-
work can be a challenge. Payroll clerks often wrestle with scrawled or illegible notes and are
unable to contact the foreman on the job for clarification. The paperwork problems can be
eliminated when foremen enter time sheet information on a tablet computer and transmit it
to the main office.
Construction equipment such as bulldozers and earth graders also participate in wireless
networks by being fitted with wireless terminals, turning them into “smart” equipment.
A GPS on a bulldozer or digger can provide very accurate location information. The exact
location of the dig coordinates can be transmitted to a terminal on the bulldozer, which dis-
plays a color-coded map to guide the operator. Smart equipment can be connected through
wireless transmissions back to the home office, which tracks engine hours and equipment
location. Wireless terminals in the engine’s diagnostic system can send an alert when the oil
needs to be changed or other maintenance operations are due.
Site engineers can consult drawings, make any necessary adjustments, and have access to
updated plans without having to wait until new drawings are copied and shipped to the site.
In addition to building construction on land, undersea pipeline and bridge construction, as
well as ocean-based wind generator farms, were among the first businesses to take full advan-
tage of wireless technologies to ensure accuracy and reduce problems.
RFID and Wi-Fi is also being used on construction sites to check contractors in and out, as
well as to direct them where and what work to do at different locations. Engineers no longer
need to check with contractors on a day-to-day basis. An RFID tag at the location where the
work needs to be done is read by an app and the specifications for the work, drawings, and
any special instructions are displayed right from the app. This process can improve speed and
accuracy and prevent errors, which can be costly and require work to be redone. It can also
improve safety.
Warehouse Management
Managing a warehouse stocked with inventory can be a nightmare. New products arrive con-
tinually and must be counted and stored. When products are shipped out of the warehouse,
they must be located and then transferred to the correct loading dock so they can be placed
on the right truck. Then, employees must update the stock database to reflect the outgoing
shipment. A mistake in any one of these steps can result in a warehouse stocked with pro-
ducts that it cannot locate, irate customers receiving the wrong items, or a store running out
of goods to sell.

Implementing wireless technology is essential in many warehouse operations. By equipping
all of the warehouse’s machinery and personnel with wireless networking devices, managers
can use warehouse management system (WMS) software to supervise all the activities, from
receiving through shipping. And because this network is tied into the front-office computer
system, managers can have statistics that are always current.
Pallet loads arriving from locations outside the receiving warehouse come with barcoded labels
or RFID tags. The RFID tags can include product identification numbers, product code dates
or expiration dates, manufacturing location, and sequentially assigned serial numbers. As pal-
lets arrive at a warehouse, RFID or barcode readers can identify it and the documentation can
be matched to the database. A forklift operator scans the RFID or barcode with his portable
wireless device. This device sends the data to the wireless network, where the warehouse soft-
ware immediately designates a storage location for the pallet and relays the information back
to the computer on the forklift. The forklift operator then transports the pallet to the desig-
nated storage location. The operator scans the pallet again, as it is placed on a shelf, to confirm
that it is the correct location before depositing the load.
In the front office, orders for merchandise to ship out are received and entered into the
computer that connects to the WLAN in the warehouse. The WMS software manages
order picking, balances workloads, and selects pick sequences for forklift operators. The
dock control module of the WMS then releases orders for picking. A forklift operator
locates the correct storage location, scans the barcode of the pallet, and then ferries it to
the shipping dock to be loaded onto a truck. Some highly sophisticated warehouses are
operating with fully automated pallet machines and forklifts that can process the storing
and retrieving of products completely without human intervention.
Checkout how RFID can improve the accuracy and speed of shipping
on YouTube. Search for a video called “RFID Shipping with FedEx.”
Retail Stores
In the near future, most barcode functions, including inventory counting, will be replaced by
RFID tags. Large retailers already have instructed their suppliers to implement RFID in all
the products they purchase, some at the pallet level and some at the individual item level.
RFID will greatly simplify inventory counting and it will eventually benefit the customers as
well. Some stores, like clothing retailer Old Navy in Canada, already tag each item. RFID is
used mainly to prevent losses due to theft at these stores.
Apple retail stores and several others are making use of iBeacon technology to promote their
products and increase sales by offering specials and discounts to loyal customers. As you
enter the store or while you are looking at products on a particular shelf, a dedicated store
app on your smartphone or tablet is activated by an iBeacon device. The app can generate a
sound and provide you with more information, discount coupons, etc., via the store’s Wi-Fi
WLAN. iBeacon is a short-distance, one-way transmission technology.
Checkout lines at supermarkets and other large retailers can become far more efficient or can
even be completely automated by the use of RFID tags at the individual item level. As you
learned in Chapter 11, you may soon be able to simply walk out of the store with your

purchases and smartphone without ever stopping at a cash register. Many stores already have
self-checkout machines. In the small town of Viken, Sweden (population, 4,200), the first
unstaffed grocery store opened its doors recently. Customers register for the service and then
use their smartphones to open the door, pick items from the shelves and scan them, and then
receive an invoice once a month for their purchases.
Apple Pay and Android Pay, which use NFC, are considered much more secure than using
credit or debit cards. When you scan your credit or debit card at a retail store, your card
information is stored, albeit temporarily, on the retailer’s system. With Apple Pay and similar
systems, the retailer does not have access to your card information at all. A number is gener-
ated by the phone and used as confirmation of the purchase. Only Apple has a record of
your actual card information, which it uses to transmit to your financial institution, and this
helps keep your card information safer than ever before.
Environmental Research
One of the most challenging aspects of documenting research while in the field is that it is
difficult and dangerous to extend long cables or install heavy equipment inside, say, deep
caves or at the tops of trees. Earthquake and Tsunami monitoring on land or at sea also ben-
efits from real-time data collection. Today, in places that were previously difficult to access
and monitor, scientists are using small, battery-powered or solar-cell-powered sensors that
can connect to satellites and cellular networks. For example, small wireless sensors located
at the tops of tall trees monitor the effects that ultraviolet rays are having on our forests due
to holes in the ozone layer. The heavier computer equipment that records the sensor readings
can be installed in a much more accessible location nearby, along with large, heavy batteries
or generators, and it can communicate with the sensors using a WLAN. The data collected
can then be transmitted to a research or monitoring facility via cellular or satellite. This capa-
bility has proven to be a major breakthrough in many scientific fields and has helped collect
data that, until recently, was very difficult—if not impossible—to record.
Drones are also being used extensively to survey crops, examine fauna and flora, survey
ground features and stability in areas such as vertical cliffs or under bridges or other places
difficult for a human being to reach. Small, highly maneuverable remote-controlled drone air-
planes or multi-rotor helicopters can be equipped with cameras that can transmit live video
over Wi-Fi to a computer, tablet, or smartphone, as well as recording both video and still
images, for later analysis.
In the past, scientists had to be content with placing a radio collar on wild animals to learn
more about their movements and habits, and they often had to spend time in the environ-
ment and track the animals from a distance. Today they can attach a GPS-enabled collar
and cameras to mammals, birds, and even insects and monitor them from a remote location.
Scientists are also monitoring the health of flora and fauna in the oceans by placing sensors
deep below the water surface as well as sensors and cameras on the sea creatures themselves.
The sensors record a variety of data for a specified period of time, then detach themselves
automatically, float to the surface, and can either transmit their GPS location to be collected
by boat or transmit the data via satellite. Figure 12-5 shows an example of an animal with a
GPS tracking collar.

tracking collars.
Industrial Control
Because of their size and complexity, large manufacturing facilities often find that it is a chal-
lenge to install a full-featured network using very long cables, such as in automotive assembly
plants. If machines need to be monitored, it can take hours or even days for a technician to
access every machine and record or download the status of each piece of equipment. Wireless
networking solves the problem. Remote sensors can connect to a WLAN, then collect data and
transmit it to a central location, via the Internet or the enterprise network. Manufacturing man-
agers can monitor their equipment from an office or from any location, detecting potential pro-
blems instantly. Technicians in a control room can monitor the status of every machine or device
and dispatch a technician to perform maintenance work on the equipment when necessary.
Components and tools used in the manufacturing process can also be tracked using RFID.
Learn more about RFID tags for challenging manufacturing applica-
tions, search YouTube for “Confidex” and watch the videos about
two of their tag products, X-Bolt and Corona.
Industrial applications can be very demanding. The environment can be corrosive, dusty,
damp, too hot or too cold, etc. Specialized sensors and systems have been available for some
time, but recent advances in size and cost of sensors, together with low-cost, low-power, and
compact wireless devices is set to revolutionize industrial control applications.
Chapter Summary
■In addition to computers, smartphones, tablets, and servers connected to the Internet,
today we have a large number and variety of devices equipped with sensors, actuators,
and built-in single-board computers and microcontrollers that are able to collect

and relay data to a central database. This Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to grow
by a staggering amount within the next decade or two, and is already on its way to
being as much a part of our lives as the Internet itself. Technologies such as LoRa may
give a boost to the IoT.
■Every day wireless technologies are being applied in new and creative ways. The
demand for technicians, technologists, and RF engineers is growing and will likely
continue to grow as new technologies are invented and standardized. The need is for
skilled people who can design, implement, manage, and support wireless networks.
Each technology requires a different set of skills.
■Healthcare is one area in which the use of wireless technologies is expanding dramati-
cally. From monitoring the movements of patients in a hospital to tracking their intake
of medication with wireless transmitter-equipped pills, to saving the lives of elderly
people who live alone, or allowing a doctor to monitor the vital signs of a patient
from the other side of the world using a smartphone, wireless health applications have
seen tremendous growth in the recent past.
■Students in remote areas of the world can now have interactive access to teachers from
many other parts of the world via satellite. Teachers can connect to wireless displays
and share lecture slides or display video from a tablet. Students can find any location
on campus with the aid of iBeacons, a Bluetooth technology.
■Cities are taking advantage of Wi-Fi and broadband to attract visitors and business-
people and to let residents, city employees, contractors, and utility staff access the
Internet, as well as collect and transmit data to central databases.
■Home owners can increase the safety, security, and convenience of their properties using
Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and cellular networks to control lighting, heating, and air conditioning.
Wireless door locks connected to the Internet can be monitored, opened, and closed
from any remote location with access to Wi-Fi or cellular. Using a smartphone, children
and trusted contractors can have a temporary key to access the home when necessary.
■Devices attached to a TV can be used to send music or video to any location in the
home, from a smartphone, tablet, or computer. Wireless ultra-high definition TV
might make a comeback with the introduction of the IEEE 802.11ay standard in the
future. IEEE 802.11ad can support wireless transmission of 4K TV, and in the future,
even 8K TV.
■RFID-enabled fare tickets are used to pay for public transit, and Wi-Fi Internet access
is available from passenger cars to airplanes. Airlines are saving a lot of weight and
complexity by moving to the delivery of in-flight entertainment via Wi-Fi on the
passengers’ own devices.
■RFID is being used to manage access to entertainment events. RFID-enabled tickets
that are very hard to reproduce have to be scanned at the entrance so that turnstiles
will allow attendees into the venue. This can prevent fake and duplicate tickets from
being used to access the events and provides management with real-time information
on the number and location of people entering the venues.
■Transportation systems also benefit from wireless. The safety of trucks and drivers
increases with the use of real-time tracking using GPS technology. The OnStar system
can detect accidents, open vehicle doors when the owner locks the keys inside, and
allow the vehicle owner to make cellular phone calls.

■Athletes and coaches make use of smart equipment to monitor and improve their
performance. Wireless transmitters installed in golf clubs, baseball bats, clothing, and
other types of sports gear transmit information in real time to an app on a smartphone
or to a computer nearby that helps the athlete or coach analyze their movements and
performance.
■Construction sites are being made safer and the jobs more accurate through the use of
RFID and Wi-Fi. Contractors can check in and out using a wireless device and RFID and
can be also more accurately directed to the place where the work is to be done. Engineers
can update drawings from the job site, and changed drawings can be accessed faster using
tablets without having to wait for updated drawings to be shipped to the site.
■RFID and Wi-Fi are being used for inventory counting and to improve accuracy
for warehouse management. Readers installed at the loading docks can check the
shipments against orders and can also help place items on the correct shelves in
warehouses.
■Retail stores can increase sales using apps and iBeacon devices to offer coupons and
discounts to loyal customers when they visit the store. RFID is also used to increase
security and prevent theft.
■Scientists can track animals remotely, on a map, instead of following them physically.
The health and habits of sea animals and the ocean flora can be monitored and
tracked with GPS and camera-equipped devices that collect data for a period of time
and then float to the surface, transmitting the data via satellite or their GPS location so
they can be picked up.
■Factories use wireless devices to monitor machines and RFID to track parts and tools.
Managers can monitor all machines, tools, and components used from a central
location instead of having to send a technician to collect the data from each machine
on the factory floor. Wireless technology also solves the challenges of installing long
cable connections in large plants.

Chapter 6—Configuring an Ad Hoc WLAN
Project 6-1
Microsoft has removed the ability for users to create an ad hoc
WLAN in Windows 10, except for (currently) a very limited number
of WLAN adapters that can be used for Internet Connection Sharing
(ICS). To find out if you have one of the adapters that still support ad
hoc networks perform the following steps.
1. Right-click the Start button and click Command Prompt (Admin). Note that you will
need to be logged in to an account that has system administrator privileges. Type the
following command at the CMD window prompt: netsh wlan show drivers and press
Enter.
2. Click Yes if the system asks you if you wish to allow this program to make changes to
your system.
3. Look for the line “Hosted network supported.” If you see No after the colon, then skip
to the next project, because you will not be able to create an ad hoc WLAN.
4. If you see Yes after the colon, then search the web for “How to create an ad hoc
WLAN in Windows 10” and follow the instructions to create a hosted network. Note
that you will need to have a second network adapter connected to the Internet, since
this process will create a shared Internet connection.
If you find that your adapter supports this feature, search for
instructions on how to configure ICS at the following website:
