1. Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Gonad Axis and Follicle 
Maturation 
 
The Common Axis 
There are many similarities 
between the hypothalamus-
pituitary-gonad axis in males 
and females. The process of 
producing sperm or ova is 
coordinated by the 
hypothalamus which secretes 
GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone) in a pulsatile manner. 
In turn, GnRH stimulates the 
anterior pituitary to secrete both 
FSH (follicle-stimulating 
hormone) and LH (luteinizing 
hormone) (Fig. 1). In both males 
and females, androgens (like 
testosterone) produced in the 
gonad are needed for 
development of the ovum or 
sperm. Production of inhibin B 
by cells in the testis or ovary 
decreases FSH secretion while 
sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen regulate GnRH, LH, and FSH secretion. 
 
The Axis in Females 
In the female, the cyclic pattern of hypothalamic secretion controls the menstrual cycle. Starting 
at puberty, the hypothalamus secretes GnRH which leads to LH and FSH secretion from the 
anterior pituitary. LH acts on the theca cells of the ovary to secrete androgen. FSH acts on the 
follicles in the ovary and specifically on the granulosa cells which surround the ovum. These 
cells contain the enzyme aromatase which converts local androgen (from the theca cells) to 
estrogen. Estrogen exerts a negative feedback blocking secretion of GnRH, LH and FSH (Fig. 
1). Granulosa cells also secrete inhibin which selectively suppresses FSH secretion.  
 
The Ovary 
The ovary has two primary functions. In oogenesis, the ovum and its surrounding granulosa 
cells mature in a structure called a follicle. The other role of the ovary is the secretion of 
estrogen and progesterone which develops and maintains female secondary sex characteristics 
and prepares the uterine surface for the initiation of pregnancy (implantation of embryo).

Oogenesis  
The ovarian germ cell population changes in number over time. The peak stem cell population 
occurs at about the fifth month of gestation and is followed by a very rapid fall in numbers such 
that at birth the germ cell population is about 10-20 million cells. During the prepubertal and 
reproductive periods there is a further reduction in oocyte number such that only about 400-500 
oocytes actually mature to ovulation (i.e., leave the ovary). The others are lost to cell death 
(called atresia). The loss of oocytes is the fundamental basis of menopause.  
 
Follicle growth 
Each oocyte is surrounded 
by one to several layers of 
granulosa cells. This 
structure is called a follicle. 
The menstrual cycle in the 
ovary can be divided into 
follicular and luteal phases 
(Fig. 2). The follicular phase 
extends from day 1 
(beginning of menses) to day 
14. The follicle develops in 
response to FSH. Granulosa 
cells of the follicle continue 
to secrete increasing 
amounts of estrogen which 
feeds back in a negative 
manner to regulate FSH. 
Plasma FSH levels decline. 
FSH levels are also 
regulated by a second 
hormone, inhibin, secreted 
by the granulosa cells. 
Inhibin negatively regulates 
FSH secretion from the 
pituitary.  
 
Each month several follicles 
start to mature but only one 
is chosen to be ovulated 
(i.e., expelled from the ovary) for transport to the uterus. This chosen follicle expresses the 
highest number of FSH and LH receptors. It survives and the others die (atresia). 
 
Between days 12-14, there is a rapid rise in estrogen secretion by the granulosa cells. Now 
estrogen acts in a positive manner resulting in an increase in kisspeptin within the 
hypothalamus (Figs. 2 and 3). The surge of LH production in response to increased estrogen is 
unique to females. Male brains develop in the presence of testosterone which is converted to 
estrogen. Increased levels of estrogen in the male brain prevent development of a certain group 
of neurons in the anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) nucleus of the hypothalamus. However, 
under conditions of low estrogen during prenatal development as is seen in females, neurons 
gather in the AVPV which synapse with the cell body of GnRH producing neurons and stimulate 
GnRH release under increased estrogen levels as occurs during follicular development (Fig. 3).

This local rise in kisspeptin 
increases GnRH secretion and 
consequently a surge in LH 
secretion. Thirty six to forty eight 
hours after the LH surge, ovulation 
of the chosen ovum occurs.  
 
Luteal phase 
The luteal phase of the ovary 
extends from days 14-28 (Fig. 2). In 
the ovary, the now empty chosen 
follicle converts to a hormone 
secreting tissue called the corpus 
luteum. The corpus luteum secretes 
both estrogen and progesterone 
(Fig. 2). In the luteal phase, 
estrogen inhibits FSH and LH 
secretion from the pituitary, as well 
as GnRH.  If fertilization does not 
occur, then 12-14 days after 
ovulation, the corpus luteum degenerates and ceases estrogen and progesterone production 
(Fig. 2). The decrease in estrogen and progesterone allows for increased GnRH production to 
begin the cycle all over again. 
 
2. The Menstrual Cycle 
During the menstrual cycle the 
hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, 
and uterus interact to cause a 
follicle to mature, egg to be 
released, and provide a uterus 
suitable for pregnancy. This is 
accomplished by the 
hypothalamus and pituitary 
exerting control over the ovary 
while the steroids of the ovary 
feedback to regulate the 
hypothalamus and pituitary. The 
steroids of the ovary are also 
responsible for initiating and 
controlling changes that occur in 
the endometrium of the uterus 
(Fig. 4). 
The Uterus 
The menstrual cycle of the ovary causes the uterus to be either proliferative or secretory   
The uterus proliferative phase (growth phase) is regulated by estrogen during days 1-14 of the 
menstrual cycle (Fig. 2). During this time the uterine wall thickens and uterine glands develop.  
 
The secretory phase of the uterus is regulated by progesterone during days 14-28 of the 
menstrual cycle (Fig. 2). Progesterone prepares the uterus for the possibility of embryo

implantation. In the absence of fertilization and implantation, progesterone levels decline late in 
the menstrual cycle so that by day 28, the uterine glands atrophy and the uterine surface 
sloughs off. This is due to vascular constriction and enhanced uterine smooth muscle activity. 
Menses ensues. 
 
Successful implantation and pregnancy requires a continuous production of progesterone. If 
fertilization and pregnancy occurs, then the newly formed embryo (blastocyst) secretes the 
hormone, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), which stimulates the corpus luteum to 
produce estrogen and progesterone during the first trimester of pregnancy (Fig. 4). hCG is used 
to assess the viability of the fetus and is the basis of the at home pregnancy test. If there is not 
successful implantation, there is no hCG produced and the corpus luteum degenerates and 
ceases estrogen and progesterone production. hCG levels increase and peak at 10-12 weeks of 
pregnancy. Once the hCG levels decrease, 3 months into the pregnancy, the corpus luteum 
regresses. However, estrogen and progesterone levels continue to increase throughout the 
pregnancy because the placenta produces them. 
 
Mechanisms of action for estrogen 
Steroid hormones act as transcription factors in their target tissues. In the uterus and breast, 
estrogen up-regulates estrogen receptors. In addition, estrogen primes the tissue for 
progesterone action by increasing the numbers of progesterone receptors expressed. The 
continual exposure to unopposed estrogen can result in pathological stimulation of these target 
tissues (cancer of the uterus).  
 
In contrast, progesterone-dependent transcription down-regulates the estrogen receptor 
(decreases its numbers) thereby facilitating differentiation. Remember that the tissue is sensitive 
to the hormone only if it expresses the receptor for that hormone. 
 
Oral Contraceptives 
Oral contraceptive pills are usually a combination of synthetic estrogen and progesterone. The 
doses are lower than would be normally found in the body due to a prolonged half-life (4-8 hours 
versus 20 min). This is accomplished by adding groups such as acetyl or methyl groups which 
slow metabolism of the synthetic hormones by the liver. They act by inhibiting pituitary secretion 
of LH (negative feedback) which often prevents ovulation. Some pills, such as progesterone-
only pills, are not as effective at preventing ovulation. However, they prevent pregnancy by 
affecting cervical mucus which prevents sperm from entering the uterus or by making the 
endometrium unable to facilitate implantation. Periodic withdrawal of steroids is used to allow for 
a sloughing of the uterine wall (menstrual flow).
