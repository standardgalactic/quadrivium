Analysis of Loops 

Alex Aiken 
Analysis of Loops 
• To understand why we need z, look at a loop 
X := 3 
B > 0 
Y := Z + W 
Y := 0 
A := 2 * X 
A < B 

Alex Aiken 
Analysis of Loops 
• Consider the statement Y := 0 
• To compute whether X is constant at this point, we need 
to know whether X is constant at the two predecessors 
– X := 3 
– A := 2 * X 
 
• But info for A := 2 * X depends on its predecessors, 
including Y := 0! 

Alex Aiken 
Analysis of Loops 
• Because of cycles, all points must have values at all 
times 
 
• Intuitively, assigning some initial value allows the 
analysis to break cycles 
 
• The initial value z means “So far as we know, control 
never reaches this point”

Analysis of Loops 
After running the constant propagation algorithm to 
completion, choose the correct dataflow information 
for X, Y, and Z at the program point labeled at right.
