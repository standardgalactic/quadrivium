About the Author
Greg Velm has been teaching college and graduate-school students for more than 25 years.
Greg is the Chair of the History Commission in Sacramento and is the author of the rip-
roaring book True Gold: History and Adventure in the Gold Country from Indians to Arnold.
American Indians were around for thousands of years before Arnold Schwarzenegger made
all of California his movie set, but Greg has studied just about every minute of history from
there to here. If the dinosaurs had written books, Greg would probably read them.
By the time he got through his own graduate education at the University of California,
Berkeley, Greg had puzzled through thousands of pretty fiendish multiple-choice questions
and written miles of essays. As he struggled to survive the Exam Inquisitors, he usually
reflected on two lofty thoughts: “Why didn’t I study more?” and “How can I psych up enough
to survive this test?” Therefore, with his own students, he emphasizes test-taking skills as
well as history smarts. If you want to become rich and famous, it helps to pass the tests.
Greg thinks that history is an exciting adventure, so in addition to appearances on television
and radio, he’s an in-demand speaker. He’s been in the New York Times, Time, Youth, and Via
Magazine. Greg has lectured at Berkeley, the University of San Francisco, and St. Mary’s
College. Because he wants human history to have a future, Greg serves on the boards of two
environmental organizations.
Greg lives with his beloved wife near the American River in northern California. He tries to
make sure that his three grown sons have good jobs so that maybe someday they’ll send
money home. When he’s not living in the past, Greg rides mountain bikes through the Sierra
foothills and tries to outsurvive other old dudes in the shortest triathlons he can find.


Dedication
To my mother, Miriam Berry, for teaching me that I was worthy of an exciting life. To my
father, Don Velm, for showing me the glowing spirit that shines throughout history.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Nobody ever writes a book by himself; his work is held up by the dedication of great people
who came before him. Historians who have made the past an enlightening adventure include
Will and Ariel Durant, Allan Eckert, Kevin Starr, Winston Churchill, H. W. Brands, Howard
Zinn, Robert Bucholz, David Kennedy, Lizabeth Cohen, Eric Foner, Barbara Tuchman, and
Alton Pryor.
I get by with a little help from my friends and fellow thinkers Mike Tucker, George Rosenfeld,
Albert Lowey-Ball, Bob Greeley, P. K. Agarwal, Kendall Meredith, Terry Taylor, Mary Ann
McDonnell, John Azzaro, Irick Collins, Bodhi Garrett, Katherine Blank, Eric Warp, Stuart Bair,
Craig Lovell, Dan Egerter, Rick Kraus, Noel Neuburger, Erich Ryll, and Terry and Mo Burton.
Thanks to my dear wife Jeanette for encouraging me in my journeys into the past.
Nothing is as modern as history — it tracks the progress of all the other specialties and is
constantly reinventing itself when new research and understanding offer a clearer view of the
past. Never, from the ancient Library at Alexandria to the ivy towers of Oxford and Berkeley,
has collaborative scholarship been so alive as it is right now with the growth of information
on the World Wide Web. Thanks to the dedicated teachers who create beautiful history sites
and to the thousands of anonymous contributors to the 2,000,000 articles that make up the
ever-expanding and improving world of Wikipedia.
Thanks to Ken Umbach and to Matt Wagner of Fresh Books for helping guide me to this book
and to my editors at Wiley: Natalie Harris, Stacy Kennedy, Megan Knoll, and Kathy Simpson.

AP U.S. History For Dummies 

Introduction
O
n behalf of all the scholars who can see that history is a wonderful adventure, wel-
come to the world. School’s out, and it’s time to have some fun getting credit for what
you know. While you’re in the game, you can make sure you’ve got the right stuff to make it
through the AP U.S. History exam. AP U.S. History For Dummies contains all the information
you need to know to tackle the AP exam head-on and emerge triumphant.
Millions have made it through the AP U.S. History examination before; it’s the most widely
taken single-subject test in the Advanced Placement world. If you’re holding this book with
slightly shaky hands because you’re not sure you know enough to get a good score on the
Big AP, you’ve come to the right place. On the other hand, if you race through the past so
quickly that you feel like you already know most of the important stuff, this is a good time to
test your knowledge. If you hated history and had to slap yourself awake through every dull
lecture, now is the time to see the past come alive.
Please accept the apologies of all good adventure historians for any harm that instructors
who parade historic humans as if they were plaster saints have done you. You didn’t deserve
to be crammed full of names, dates, and places without being shown the rainbow bridge of
history that makes what happened before you were born important to everything you are
today. Remember, no one ever lived in the past. Everybody you read about in history was
struggling in their present, just like you, with no idea how it would turn out. The decisions
they made, whether trying to do the right thing or swept away by emotion, form the world in
which all Americans will live until they too can change their little bit of history for the sake of
their children and their children’s kids.
The history of the United States IS important. The U.S. and the New World arrived on the
global scene like sunshine through the clouds. The late 1700s saw an almost-religious belief
in the power of human progress and reason. That belief was called Enlightenment. The
founding of the United States became Enlightenment in action. The U.S. is far from perfect,
and its growth has included the subjugation of Africans, American Indians, and other minori-
ties. Without ducking that reality, the United States has also been a meeting place for people
and ideas from all over the world — the most diverse and unified society that history has
ever produced.
The human beings who make up the United States have been brave and sometimes selfish
but are usually welcoming of newcomers and eager to share their ideals of freedom with the
world. You read a lot about Manifest Destiny and American Exceptionalism in history, as if
the U.S. had some sort of cosmic advantage. The United States doesn’t have to be excep-
tional or manifest to be beautiful; in a way, it’s better for being the product of human possi-
bility. The story of the U.S. is a great example of people from all nations working together
to promote tolerance and real democracy. The fate of the United States is very probably a
window unto the future of the world. When the Enlightenment came to the New World, it
was just an idea; now it’s a nation.

About This Book
I’ve designed AP U.S. History For Dummies so that you know the particulars of the exam itself
thanks to the first sections, have access to the important points of U.S. History in the middle
sections, and have a good practice run thanks to the practice exams in a later section.
Like the Internet, the book is also set up so you can hit it and quit it. You can bounce around
between practice tests (Part V) and exam strategies (Part II) or just spend a few moments
mentally downloading a little knowledge about a specific time in the United States’ past, like
Jacksonian Democracy (Part III). The words in italics — like Erie Canal (1817) — are espe-
cially likely to show up on the Big AP test. You also want to pay attention to the review ques-
tions scattered throughout the history sections.
Sometimes you may like to just skim through the pages to pick up the Tips and Warnings.
That’s fine as far as it goes, but be advised: To really understand the game, you’ve got to
watch the whole field, not just the play action. Read the sections around the Tips to see why
the Tips are important.
Conventions Used in This Book
In this book, I used the following conventions:
 Where I mention a Web site, I use monofont to indicate the address.
 Bold text highlights key words in bulleted lists and the action parts of numbered steps.
 Important words are set in italics and followed closely by a definition.
 In the history sections, important names, events, and concepts also appear in italics,
followed by a key date in parentheses. This date isn’t the only important date for that
topic; it’s just a key year associated with the name and a quick reference to help you
keep concepts in order. The AP U.S. History exam is too hip to ask you to remember a
lot of dates, but you do need to know the general order of events and trends.
What You’re Not to Read
If you’re pressed for time and need to read through this book in a hurry, feel free to skip over
the sidebars. They contain interesting information, but nothing you absolutely need to know
in order to pass the test.
Foolish Assumptions
Because you’ve picked up this particular book, I assume certain things about you:
 You plan to take the AP U.S. History exam soon, and you want to be prepared.
 You want a good idea of exactly what’s on the AP U.S. History test, particularly how the
test is set up and just how much writing you’ll need to do.
 You’re a busy person who has no time for useless information or explanations.
2
AP U.S. History For Dummies 

 You’ve already read a lot of high-quality U.S. History in your classes, and you’ve done
some essay-writing on the subject.
 You have a reasonable grasp of U.S. History but need a convenient refresher.
How This Book Is Organized
If you dropped by the Table of Contents on your way to this Introduction, you may have
noticed that AP U.S. History For Dummies is divided into six nutritious dishes. You can con-
sume these parts in any order you want, save some for later, or share them with a friend.
Here’s what you’ve got to help you through the big exam:
Part I: College Credit, Here I Come!
In this section, you meet the powerful secret society that controls your Advanced Placement
test destiny, the College Board. With the information you gain here, you can decide whether
Advanced Placement is just another Establishment buzzkill or whether the whole process
may somehow be for your own good. You discover how to use the PES dispenser tactic
(political, economic, and social history) to pop your way through the big exam. What kind of
score can you get on the Big AP test, and what’s that going to mean for your college educa-
tion? Part I is where you find out.
The College Board actually influences the way AP history is taught. This part tells you what
the CB told your teacher and fills in any blanks that your dear instructor may have ne-
glected. As you prepare, you want to keep your mind in mind. You can soak up some tips for
psyching yourself up so you can prepare better and more quickly and pick up some mental
test taking tools.
Part II: Answering the Questions: 
Three Kinds, Three Strategies
Multiple-Choice, Document-Based Question, and Regular Essay — they all show up at the AP
Inquest. This part of the book shows you the right approach (actually, several alternate keys)
to each of the question types. Each kind of question gets its own chapter; you can pick up a
specialist technique for each situation, just like a rock climber approaches each face with a
different look.
For multiple-choice, you discover how to maximize your chances for a hit when you’re not
sure of the right answer and how to avoid the Question Troll of losing points for wrong
guesses. Using a little knowledge to pry apart the five choices can increase your odds.
Almost nobody gets all the multiple choice questions right; you just want to nail timing and
answer management to score as high as you can in the minutes you’ve got.
The Document-Based Question on every AP U.S. History test introduces a dilemma for many
exam pilgrims. For once, the test is actually giving you some of the much-desired answer
right before your eyes. You could, like, just write the essay on how cool all those eight to ten
original pictures and documents really are. That’s a mistake. Chapter 5 shows you how to
handle documents like a professor, combining their meaning with outside knowledge in the
proof, analysis, and thesis (PAT) method.
3
Introduction

In Chapter 6, you figure out how to write essays that teachers feel good about praising in the
short time they have to evaluate your hard-earned creativity. Discovering how to list your
evidence and plan your thesis are two of the keys to writing clear, fast, and grader-friendly
essays.
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs 
to the Civil War
As you move into actual history, you start with the most test-worthy parts of the 95 percent
of the human past in North America from which few written records still exist. As you cruise
through the history sections in Parts III and IV, you want to pay special attention to the
words that show up in italics with a date like Christopher Columbus (1492). The Big AP seldom
questions you on exact dates, but you need to keep the people, trends, and events in the
right general chronological order so that you can keep the development of history straight.
The date in parentheses helps you associate a time with each fact.
American Indians lived in the New World — including the area that would become the U.S. —
for thousands of years; settlers have only been here for a few hundred. The colonies had a
rocky beginning but soon developed a personality of their own that included good-to-know
political, economic, and social differences. Because about 20 percent of the questions on the
test will deal with the time before the Revolution, you need to jump on board before you get
to George Washington.
The American Revolution was a watershed event in the history of the world and also the
formal beginning of the United States. The new country faced rebellion, political repression,
and the threat of foreign attack, and that was all before it was 20 years old. Having survived
to be a strong young adult, the U.S. grew and matured but with a terrible problem at home:
slavery. The solution began with brothers shooting each other in the Civil War. About 30 per-
cent of the Big AP will cover the period between the Revolution and the Civil War, which this
part covers.
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War
to the Days of the Internet
In this last half of U.S. history (to the present day, of course), you get a grasp on the facts
that form a core part of 50 percent of your score on the AP Showdown. Reconstruction
started with an impeachment hearing in the North and ended with a political deal in the
South; you want to understand the background. Social and economic trends became increas-
ingly important as ex-slaves, working people, and women fought for equal rights. As the
1800s drew to a close, the U.S. stepped on to the world stage with old Rebels and Yankees
fighting on the same side in the Spanish-American War.
Teddy Roosevelt’s Big Stick whacked the way toward the Progressive Era. You can come to
terms with how the pace of reform ebbed and flowed through the 1900s. America’s first
European war, also known as World War I, was followed by the Great Depression and then
World War II. As that war ended, the U.S. was front and center as a world leader — no more
hiding behind the great oceans. This Part also covers the background of the Cold War and
the beginning of the policy issues that still face the United States. Social and economic
changes continued to roll as the U.S. sailed into the 2000s.

Part V: Practice Makes Perfect: 
Two Tests Plus the Answers
This is the part where you can test your skills. Either you take the tests first to find out what
you need to study or you study first, take the tests, and then study some more on the parts
where you need help.
These For Dummies practice tests are beyond realistic. The real test will be a confusing
jumble of dates and question styles. Fortunately, you have to go though the actual AP only
once. To allow you to reinforce the sections in your test armor that are a little thin, I’ve
arranged the practice tests mostly in chronological order. That allows you to pick out any
eras or topics in which you seem to need help. You’ll see a few out-of-chronological-order
questions just to let you know what the real test will feel like.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In the final part of your For Dummies AP U.S. History tune-up, you get to experience fun with a
purpose. First you review ten monster events AP wants you to know. In the monster events
category: colony set-up, working colonies, Revolution, Confederation becomes Constitution,
prequel to Civil War, Jacksonian democracy, the Civil War goes down, U.S. grows to big dog,
the country adjusts to world power, and, finally, the evolution of government support. This
list allows you to review your foundation of understanding and pick up a few fun facts.
The next top-ten list on the menu is ten trends that never go away. Read and remember as
you review U.S. diversity, American identity, culture, demographics, economics, women,
minorities, reform, internationalism, and spirituality.
The Supreme Court is the important third branch of the U.S. government, and its decisions
both determine and reflect social trends. The final list follows the top ten hits of the Supreme
Court as it has handed down decisions over the years.

Introduction

Although every AP test is different, these questions represent popular topics for College
Board Test Masters. The questions appear in the Part II and Part III chapters, and I give you
only the correct answers for them to help you with your studying. Don’t worry — there are
plenty of full-blown multiple choice questions for you in Chapters 22 and 24!
This icon points out interesting but unessential information. If you aren’t really a history
head, you can skip these paragraphs, but trivia buffs will eat them up.
Where to Go from Here
At some point, you have to stop adjusting your equipment and just jump into the adventure.
Here are three basic approaches; you can mix and match in any way that makes sense to you.
When test day comes, it’s going to be all about you, what’s in your head, and what you can do
with it. So make your For Dummies equipment work for your style of studying — just get
moving now.
The old front-to-back approach actually has a lot to recommend it. By starting at the begin-
ning, you have the test elements and exam-taking strategy in mind when you read the history
section. This method can be useful in putting the history happenings into possible questions
as you read. The reason you bought this book was presumably to get insider info on answer-
ing AP exam questions, not just to review history.
The middle, front, back strategy lets you start with the history and gain some context and
confidence before you plunge into the cross fire of possible exam questions and strategy.
Plus, if for some unknown reason you don’t actually have time for the strategy or practice
sections, you’ve at least read the history and sample questions. Warning: If you don’t have
experience with Document-Based Questions (DBQ’s), at least read Chapter 5 on this topic.
Students who try to answer a DBQ for the first time on the big exam are speeding without a
steering wheel.
If you’re the kind of person who jumps into the lake to see how cold the water is and then
decides which way to swim, you may just want to jump right into the practice tests and see
how you do. Warning: Unless you ace both tests, don’t get overconfident — each test covers
only half of U.S. History. Be honest with yourself: don’t peek at the answers. The real AP
exam isn’t a crossword puzzle.
Good luck, and may your placement be advanced.

College Credit, Here I Come!

In this part...
P
art I is designed to put a determined smile on your
face when you open that exam book and pick up your
pencil. Before you play a game, you’ve got to check out the
rules, so in this part, you scope out the Grand Inquisitor
itself, the College Board. This fine institution may influ-
ence your college fate; here’s where you discover how it
works. Before you get into the kinds of questions you’ll
encounter on the AP U.S. History exam, Part I gives you
the lowdown on who creates the questions and how col-
lege admissions personnel use the test results. You also
get a handle on the PES secret to test success: political,
economic, and social information.
To get the highest score you can, you need to understand
the kind of answers the AP U.S. History exam likes to see.
When you have an overview of the test territory you’ll be
navigating, take a deep breath and use a little psychology
to make your studying (and test-taking) as effective as
possible.

U
.S. History may be a grand pageant of determination and growth, but chances are
good that right now you just want to make sure you score some college credit for that
long year you spent busting your butt in AP History. You’re not alone; some 350,000 AP stu-
dents have this same U.S. History exam looming over them right now.
Of all the AP exams, U.S. History is the most often taken Advanced Placement test in the
entire fiendish College Board repertoire. You could call it the most popular, if popular is the
right word for a national test that makes you sweat for three hours to try to earn college
credit for something you’ve already been tested on too many times in high school. It’s tough,
but if you don’t pass the AP, you don’t get paid that college credit. This book is designed to
give you the tools you need to ace the AP U.S. History exam. In this chapter, I give you an
overview of the test and what to expect so you can prepare yourself for what lies ahead.
School Learning versus Test Prep
This book isn’t just about U.S. History, fun as that is. This book is about the Ultimate U.S.
History Test and how you’re going to score well on that test. As you read, you’re going to be
practicing Challenge Question and PES responses until they become second nature.
The difference between school and Challenge Question test prep is simple: In test prep, you
turn a fact into a question and then answer the question the whole time you’re reading his-
tory. Mixing in questions with history is what the Challenge Question technique is all about.
Your history review in Parts III and IV will be full of questions, but you’ll go even farther if
you get into the habit of asking and answering questions on your own. And, this AP U.S.
History For Dummies guide works even better when you combine it with your school AP text.
You can pick up some more tips on using outside books in Chapter 2.

The Power of the College Board: 
What It Is and What It Does
So just who is this College Board, and why does it have such control over your future? Ever
notice how the power structure (also known as the Man) seems to be all connected? The
College Board (which I’ll call CB) is the connection between your present (high school) and
your future (college). The CB is a well-meaning, not-for-profit membership association whose
official mission is to “connect students to college success and opportunity.” Okay so far, but
like all connections, it only works if you reach out and grab it.
Founded in 1900, the CB consists of thousands of schools, colleges, universities, and other
educational organizations. Each year, the College Board works with some 7 million students
and their parents, 23,000 high schools, and 3,500 colleges in college admissions, guidance,
assessment, financial aid, and enrollment. Among its best-known and feared tests are the SAT,
the PSAT/NMSQT, and your current favorite, the Advanced Placement program (AP). All of
these tests are registered trademarks of the College Board; when it comes to using tests for
college placement, the CB is the Man. This can be a good thing.
With what it garners from grading all those tests, the CB gives schools feedback to improve
teaching. You may not like the power that CB tests hold over your future, but without them,
colleges could just pick the people who are richest or tallest or cutest or something. College
Board tests give you the chance to prove what you can do; the AP U.S. History test pays you
for what you know with college credit.
Counting the Currency of College Credit
Getting college credit through the AP exam is like finding a rich uncle you didn’t know you
had. Thousands of universities and colleges in the United States and many other countries
are standing by to offer you college credit for the AP U.S. History work you’ve done in high
school. All you have to do is get at least a 3 on the AP U.S. History Exam. (See the section
“Score! What does it mean?” later in the chapter.)
When it comes to actually granting college credit, your future university holds all the cards.
Neither your high school nor even the benevolent College Board can grant you credit; that
has to come from your future school. Be very careful to see your prospective alma mater’s
policy on awarding credit for high school AP work in print before you enlist in its intellectual
army. Either get the written policy from the school or go to collegesearch.college
board.com/apcreditpolicy/index.jsp to download it from the College Board site.
More about college policy on AP credit is in Chapter 2.
You’ll be happy to know that the College Board is concerned with your bank account as well
as your brains. Its recent study of college costs shows that a year at a public or state univer-
sity costs an average of almost $13,000 in tuition, fees, room, and board (and that’s just for
in-state students). Add some books, pizzas, transportation, phone, toothpaste, and occa-
sional fun — before you know it, your inexpensive public education is running $20,000 a year.
If you’re planning to seek knowledge within the ivy-covered walls of a private college, get
ready for an even bigger sticker shock: Average costs are more than $30,000 for basic tuition,
fees, room, and board. By the time you count all those extras, a private college education can
easily run $40,000 a year.
10
Part I: College Credit, Here I Come! 

But, you hope, you’ll be paying that for only four years before you earn your prestigious
diploma, right? Not so fast. The average public university student takes 6.2 years to earn a
degree; the average private school undergraduate clocks in at 5.3 years. (See the sidebar
“Working now and playing later” for info on how AP tests can help you shave time off that
period.) The total average college expense is $124,000 for a public university and $212,000 for
a private college. Maybe you should just skip college and use the money for a luxury car to
impress people during your long fast-food career.
Putting Together Your AP Game Plan
A little concerned about what you know (or don’t know) about U.S. history? Don’t worry. If
I didn’t start you at the beginning and work you gently to the end, this wouldn’t be a For
Dummies guide. Although I can’t promise to turn you into a Pulitzer-prize winning history
guru overnight, you don’t need that anyway. You just need a decent score on the AP U.S.
History exam.
Taking in the test basics
To help make that happen, I start you out in Part I with some inside tips on how to maximize
your score when the big test day is finally upon you.
In Part II, you get tuned up with a few sample questions before you dive into the actual U.S.
history in Parts III and IV. That way, you can be thinking about how to extract potential ques-
tions from the condensed history in the middle sections of this book.
11
Chapter 1: Acing the Test for a College Credit Payday
Working now and playing later
What if Mom and Dad are paying? In that happy circum-
stance, do you even care about costs? Yes, you do (or at
least should). You’ll probably be racking up some student
loans during those long years that, unlike the ten bucks
you once borrowed from Uncle Milt, the college loan
sharks will definitely make you pay back with interest.
Also, you probably won’t be making much money while
you’re going to school. The average college graduate
earns almost $14,000 more per year than folks her age
who don’t send their brains for a higher-education tune-
up. You want to get to the big money as soon as possible.
If you score high enough on the AP exam to earn six
juicy college credits for AP U.S. History, you can subtract
that from the time you’ll have to spend in college classes.
(See “Score! What does it mean?” later in this chapter
for more information.) Or you can use the extra time to
study sand castle architecture in Hawaii. Pass enough
AP exams and you can save half a year or more of
undergraduate tuition-paying time — what you do with
that time is up to you.
But if you skate past the Intro to U.S. History course in
college, will you be able to keep up with the poor suck-
ers who had to take the sit-down version of Intro in col-
lege? Yes. The always-researching College Board found
that students who tested out of introductory courses
actually did better in upper-division subjects than the
people who took the intro classes. This number includes
AP students who just squeaked by with a 3 on the AP
exam. So it’s worth some effort to earn a Get-Out-of-
Intro-Jail-Free card.

Moving on to actual history
In Parts III and IV, I give you the basics of U.S. history from American Indians to the Internet.
This review covers key topics the Test Inquisitors like to keep in their secret libraries to sur-
prise and shock you. College Board tests aren’t actually written by mad professors in a castle
torture lab but by nice, tweedy historians who just want to be sure you know some true sto-
ries. The College Board U.S. History Development Committee has standards, and before you
get to exam day, it’s in your best interest to know about them.
Think like the test writers to survive their clever question schemes. They’re not going to feel
right asking you something obscure (like the color of Abe Lincoln’s dog), but they’d feel
really smug by tripping you up with something like “Who issued the Monroe Doctrine?”
(Hint: It wasn’t Marilyn Monroe.) The Grand Inquisitors are going to ask about concepts they
consider key to American history — the important issues highlighted in your school text
(but not literally highlighted — it’s only a rental, you know). When you see a highlighted
topic, make up questions about it while you’re reading. These are Challenge Questions, and
when you make them up, you’re thinking like the test writers do.
Testing, testing, 1-2-3!
In Part V, I show you the AP test. No, not the very test you’ll see on the big day. If I did that,
the only teaching I’d be doing would be in the prison cafeteria. You’ll get as close as I can
honestly take you to the test you’re going to conquer. I give you two sample tests with ques-
tions that have appeared before and will eventually appear again on the AP. After you take
the practice tests, I go over the answers with you, including some warning about places you
could go wrong. By the time you’re done, you’ll be in U.S. History shape, ready to run, dodge,
and score with the best of them.
The Political, Economic, and Social 
(PES) Answer Secret
What I, the test makers, and hopefully you have come to appreciate is that history isn’t just
facts; the meaning behind those facts is just as important. These meanings are trends or
themes. When you’ve got the themes, you have a framework on which to remember the facts.
Plus, the AP is really big on themes. The main themes are PES: political events and decisions,
economic realities and incentives, and social trends and conditions. Connect these themes,
and you’ll connect to success on exam day.
Don’t make exam essays all about you. Just because graders recognize social trends and eco-
nomics as an important part of history doesn’t mean you’ll get a good grade for an emotional
reaction to the Compromise of 1850. History is still about what happened, not your feelings
about it. Save that for drama class.
Applying politics
The old school of white-men-go-to-meetings-and-fight-battles history that your parents had to
learn began to open up when a new generation of historians noticed that the past has always
been influenced by the beliefs and actions of ordinary people, not just by leaders. Now people
12
Part I: College Credit, Here I Come! 

also concentrate on economic and social factors when they study history. Political events do
serve as landmarks in history, so it’s still important to have a general chronological sense of
these landmarks.
In this context, political events include presidents and other important leaders, laws, legal
decisions of the Supreme Court, civil conflicts, international relations, and wars. As you’re
studying your way through U.S. History, ask yourself:
 How did the government react to events?
 How and when did the leadership change?
 How were U.S. relationships with foreign governments affected?
You need to be armed with a reasonable idea of events and people in Congress and the
Supreme Court. I give you a list of the ten most important Supreme Court decisions in
Chapter 27.
Understanding the impact of economy
So, if big-dog leaders weren’t the historical be-all and end-all, what did shape the past? Ever
go to work even when you didn’t want to, just to make money? Ever run after a sale to save
some bucks or pass up something you wanted because it cost too much? Thinking about
economics helps explain human behavior.
Economics led to the settlement of most of the United States. The settlers didn’t move inland
from the Atlantic coast just so they could watch the birdies in the country. They needed rich
land to farm so that they could make money and support their families. Many of them had
left Europe because they were starving back home.
Before that, Britain’s annoying economic taxes pushed the colonists toward revolution. In the
decades before the Civil War, the South hung on to slaves because each slave was worth as
much as $50,000 in modern money, and slaves picked cotton, which was the basis of the
Southern economy. In the 1930s, the Great Depression changed the politics of the country.
Economics includes prosperity, recessions, depressions (sometimes called panics in the
past), taxes, tariffs on imported goods, inflation, corporate expansion, and profit incentives.
Questions to ask as you read include
 How did economic fear or greed influence national politics?
 How did the nation’s economic health determine or shape historical events?
 How did sectional economic interests influence national decisions?
Social history
Social understanding has been the big winner in the new vision that influences modern his-
tory writing and (most important for us AP U.S. History fans) test design. The announced
goal of the College Board is to make the big exam multiple-choice questions be
 35 percent on political institutions and policy
 40 percent on social history, including cultural developments
 25 percent on economic and international relationships
13
Chapter 1: Acing the Test for a College Credit Payday

This breakdown means that social history has taken over as the new focus of the AP U.S.
History exam. Social history includes beliefs about religion, race, national origin, and the
roles of men, women, and families. Social developments also include the influence of litera-
ture, science, art, and philosophy on events.
Questions to ask while you’re reading include
 How did the social structure change during this era?
 How did the choices people made demonstrate their cultural beliefs?
 What specific examples can you cite to show social beliefs?
 What role did religion play in the development of government and society during
this era?
 Who were the major religious leaders and trends?
 How did the literature and art of this period reflect what was going on and shape what
was about to happen?
Here are a few examples of the strong social currents in American life:
 The first permanent settlements in Massachusetts consisted of Pilgrims and Puritans,
groups who made the dangerous voyage to the unknown New World for presumably reli-
gious, not economic, reasons. In fact, the Pilgrims’ original decision to leave Europe was
as much social as religious: They had religious freedom in Holland, but they couldn’t
stand the idea that their children were growing up Dutch. (See Chapter 8.)
 Perhaps the greatest example of the power of literature and social thought was the
best-selling novel of the 1800s: Uncle Tom’s Cabin. The depictions of the evils of slavery
in this book helped send hundreds of thousands of men off to fight and die in the Civil
War. (See Chapter 13.)
 Sensationalized newspaper stories and pictures helped launch the U.S. into war with
Spain in 1898. (See Chapter 15.)
 The Democratic Party’s increasing support of civil rights helped lead both to the loss
of its traditional political hold on the South and to the fact that the Democrats man-
aged to elect only one two-term president in the last half of the 1900s. (See Chapter 20.)
PES-ing your way through multiple-choice
and essays
Half the credit on the AP U.S. History test comes from 80 multiple-choice questions. Your
score on this section depends on preparation and reasoning skill. You get preparation in
Parts III and IV of this guide to back up the preparation you already have from your AP U.S.
History course and/or study. You can beef up on your reasoning skills in Chapter 4.
The other half of the credit on the big test comes from just three essay questions. This sec-
tion is where the CB separates the Jedi Masters from the guys who don’t know where to plug
in their light sabers. Anybody can memorize facts; leaders are the people who can use those
facts successfully. That’s where PES comes in.
No, PES isn’t a cute hard-candy dispenser, as fun as that may be. PES is the way of combining
political, economic, and social information on an essay question to make test graders dis-
pense high grades. Every essay needs to contain each of the three magic PES ingredients.
The good news is the same set of ideas that prepares you for multiple-choice glory can, if
used wisely, set you up for essay success. You can find more about PES in Chapters 5 and 6.
14
Part I: College Credit, Here I Come! 

How it all applies to the AP
Here’s a rundown of what you need to know about the Ultimate History Exam. After you
understand what’s on the big test, you can use the Challenge Question and PES techniques to
amp up your study sessions.
So, what can you find out about the test ahead of time? Every essay question the CB has ever
asked is public knowledge, so your review can be informed by that comforting I-know-what-
was-on-the-test-last-year feeling. You can find some of the questions that have been asked on
multiple-choice sections over the years, but the CB has mostly kept that part of the test offi-
cially secret. No matter how you try to crack the big test, the College Board is a moving
target — it changes questions every year. The best preparation is to set up in the direction
the test is going and be prepared for a few surprise turns.
As you can see in the earlier section “Social history,” the breakdown of the multiple-choice
questions are about 35 percent on political institutions and events, 40 percent on social
developments, and the remaining 25 percent on economics and international relationships.
You can count on the fact that the three essay questions you answer will contain all of the
PES ingredients.
The time periods covered by the multiple-choice questions include
 20 percent from the period between the American Indians and the ratification of the
Constitution in 1789
 45 percent from the period between Washington’s first government in 1790 and the out-
break of World War I in Europe in 1914
 35 percent from the period between 1915 and the present.
Because the AP test writers know that most teachers don’t get through the whole history
book by May, they usually go easy on asking questions about events that happened after 1980.
How the Exam Is Graded
Reality check time. You’re going to be taking the biggest single-subject test in the history of
the CB in the not-so-distant future. The number of students taking AP tests increases every
year; this year, about a third of a million students will take the AP U.S. History test.
Machines score the multiple-choice questions. No problem there; machines never make mis-
takes, unless of course the machine is your computer, crashing when you really need it. The
essay questions, on the other hand, are hand-graded by History Readers. Each test contains
three essays; 3 essays times 1⁄3 million test takers equals 1 million essays. Even if the CB man-
ages to draft every teacher between here and Rattlesnake Junction as a History Reader, that
still doesn’t leave enough time in the few weeks between test day and grades day to slowly
savor each essay.
Your essays are going to be scanned by a very busy teacher, who will very quickly decide
your grade fate. To make grading work for you, you have to figure out how to write essays
that show key political, economic, and social (PES) points so clearly that a grader couldn’t
miss them from a speeding train.
15
Chapter 1: Acing the Test for a College Credit Payday

Plan from the beginning to make your essays look grader-friendly. Practice writing short
papers of about five paragraphs by using easily spotted key terms. Never guess at dates. You
won’t lose points for using an approximate time period, but you’ll be marked down for trying
to nail an exact year and getting it wrong. Your AP History teacher in school may help give
you feedback on your work. Study the examples in this book. Remember — less fluff and
more key terms equals higher grades.
Score! What Does Your Grade Mean?
It’d be great if you became an Oxford Pro History Guru, dropping in for lunch at the White
House and giving the Nobel prize committee a laugh with your droll history wit. Failing that,
I want you to at least pass this darn test with a high enough score to get some college credit.
AP U.S. History test results break down on the 5 point scale shown in Table 1-1.

So what grade do you need to get college credit? The answer is usually a 3 (qualified), unless
you want to go to a selective school; then the answer is a 4 (well-qualified). A 5 gets you
credit and a pat on the back anywhere in the galaxy and won’t hurt your chances of admis-
sion to a good school, either. Go to collegesearch.collegeboard.com/apcredit
policy/index.jsp to find out what the magic score is at the college you crave.
Gee, look — just over half of the people who take this test are eligible for college credit at
most schools. Of course they are; the CB curves the test every year to make it come out that
way. So ask yourself, do you feel lucky? How many really smart kids are already into their
sixth month of cramming for AP U.S. History, with Wilson’s 14 Points pinned to their lapel?
How many dumb kids are hanging around the parking lot planning to wait for the last minute
to study so it can be fresh in their well-ventilated minds? Can you be sure you’re above the
middle of those packs?
How Much Time Do You Have to Prepare?
Okay, so the test is in May. That gives you several months to prepare, right? Oops — your
time is a little shorter than that? No problem. Every day, after you finish your high-school
courses, extracurricular activities, jobs, chores, exercise, and attempts to have a social life,
just devote three hours to a rigorous review of everything that ever happened in North
America. Oops, again. Not going to happen, is it?

out to one chapter a day over about a month left before the big test, make do with that. The
secret is that you’re going beyond reading; you’re going to Challenge Question your way
through U.S. history. (See Chapter 2 for more on the Challenge Question technique.) The fol-
lowing list gives you some more suggestions on how to proceed based on how much time
you have:
 If you have more than a month, spend extra time with your high-school AP U.S.
History teacher. Ask him for copies of past AP U.S. History exams and practice taking
them. Use the Challenge Question study technique on your own high-school textbook.
Check out some other AP History texts from the school library and Challenge Question
your way through them.
 If you have less than a month before the killer exam, do a sample test from Part V.
After you pick up the kinds of questions that will be on the test, apply them to the his-
tory information in Part III and Part IV, using the Challenge Question method described
in Chapter 2. Mark the sections you’re weak on and go back and do the problems from
those weak sections three times.
 If you have less than a week before the test, read the Cheat Sheet and pray. Concentrate
the little time you have on reading about the most heavily tested period — 1800 to 1970.
You’ll have to skip studying the 20 percent of the questions that don’t cover that period,
but you may get lucky. You’re doing emergency salvage studying, and sacrifices are
inevitable.
 If you’re first reading this book on the way to the exam, don’t make any marks in it;
you may be able to give it as a gift. Practice breathing steadily through panic, which I
discuss in Chapter 3, and trust that the time you spent watching the History Channel
will pull you through.

Chapter 1: Acing the Test for a College Credit Payday
You think you’ve got it hard?
Students working toward a college education in medieval
Europe were called bajan and had to have the top of their
head shaved. After studying for a whole year (with
no guarantee of admission), they gave a speech to the
college. If the speech was good enough to get them in,
they were washed clean from head to foot and paraded
through town on a donkey.

In This Chapter
 Knowing what it takes to get to your college of choice
 Focusing on the most important historical topics
 Preparing for your test day
O
f course you want to pass the AP U.S. History exam. To do that, you’re going to take a
look inside the AP’s head. After you understand how the test makers think, you can
begin to prepare for success on your big day with AP U.S. History. To set yourself up for suc-
cess, first you have to get a clear shot at what a good grade on the AP looks like.
Grading the Way the AP Grades You
If the College Board (CB) got a grade from students on how well it runs its Advanced
Placement tests, it would probably get an A- (see Chapter 1 for more on AP basics). The big
exams are well-organized and contain interesting original thought, and you certainly have to
give the CB props for grading 1 million U.S. History essays by hand in six weeks. But if you
said A-, the CB wouldn’t know what you were talking about, because the AP deals in numbers
rather than letters. The following sections explain what this scoring means, how it affects
your college credit, and what impact certain scores have.
Converting letters to numbers
The CB talks in numbers. Most people know the famous range from flunky 200 to perfect 800
on the College Board’s SAT tests. For you nervous takers of the AP U.S. History exam, you
can count the important numbers on one hand: The CB gives grades from 1 to 5.
How do those relate to the working alphabet world of most students: A, B, C, D, and F? And,
while I’m on the subject, how come nobody ever gets an E? By sneakily checking the grades
past AP U.S. History exam takers actually get in college, the CB sets AP Exam grade bound-
aries so that exams earning an AP grade of 5 are roughly equivalent to the average AP exam
score of students who go on to earn college As. They get to peek, those crafty CBers! They
then make sure the exam receiving an AP grade of 4 equals the average scores of those col-
lege students receiving Bs, and the lowest score corresponding to an AP grade of 3 equates
to the average score of college students receiving Cs. About half of the students who take AP
U.S. History exam get a grade of 3 or better.

So there you have it:
5 = college A
4 = B
3 = C
2 = D
1 = F
In general, you can never be too rich, too thin, or have too high an AP score. Besides actual
college credit, an AP U.S. History score of 5 looks great on your college application. In most
institutions, though, you can get college credit simply by doing as well on the AP exam as
college students who get Cs in Intro U.S. History. And you won’t have a C on your college
record; just a nice, satisfying notation that college credit is in the bank.
Nailing down a college’s credit policy
Colleges are big institutions with impressive buildings and really smart people. You may be
surprised, therefore, to hear that identifying the Advanced Placement credit policies of your
favorite prospective colleges can be a little. . .well, slippery. The CB has wisely thrown up its
hands at the prospect of keeping the shifting AP policies of America’s more than 4,000 col-
leges and universities all on one page. Although the CB stays out of the middle, it does help
you look for the information yourself.
Go to collegesearch.collegeboard.com/apcreditpolicy/index.jsp to search for
your school(s) of choice. Because links can get broken, you can also use a general search
engine (such as Google), using terms like College Board and AP credit policy. When you’re on
an AP Credit Policy search page, search by the names of the colleges you may attend. If you
don’t see your college on the list the site returns, click “Next” in the lower right hand side 
of the college listing box. When you see the school you want, click on it. The College Board
search engine will attempt to send you to the very page on the institution’s Web site that
deals with AP credit.
The word “attempt” is appropriate because despite the valiant efforts of the good people at
CB, some colleges have a hard time keeping links pointed to their AP credit policies. Some
sites provide PDF files, which you must comb through to look for the AP needle in a regula-
tion haystack. Some sites let you click around the bush, forcing you to guess which links
they may be hiding AP information under. In one search I conducted, even Harvard greeted
surfers with a hearty welcome to the incoming freshmen, without a word about the fate of
these fine freshmen with AP Credit. (Here’s a tip: Don’t plan to major in Computer Science at
any institution whose Web jump greets you with a “Page Expired” message!)
20
Part I: College Credit, Here I Come! 
Perusing AP policies nationwide
Here are some college AP policies determined as of press
time. Remember, these policies can change — your credit
mileage may vary! The State University of New York
(SUNY) gives credit for an AP Exam score of 3. Yale
requires a 4, minimum. Although Notre Dame has subjects
that require anywhere from 3 to 5 for credit, AP U.S.
History requires a 4. Most state schools require a 3 —
even the famous University of California at Berkeley.
Stanford doesn’t give AP credit for every subject, and one
of the subjects it disses is U.S. History. At Cornell,
Syracuse, and the University of Arizona, U.S. History
requires a 4. Brigham Young calls for a 3. U.S.C (3 mini-
mum) and Washington University (4 minimum) have a spe-
cial deal: Add one more point (to a 4 for U.S.C and a 5
for Wash U), and you get specific course credit. The
University of Nevada at Las Vegas has a high-roller deal:
You get three credits for a 3 and six credits for a 5.

Even though it’s cumbersome, the College Board policy of jumping to the colleges’ Web sites
to let them tell their AP credit stories is a good idea. If the CB tried to play nanny to all those
sometimes-yes-but-maybe-no policies, everybody could get hurt. The person you for sure
don’t want to get hurt on the way to a higher education is you. Nail down the policies of the
schools you may want to attend. If you surf patiently around the college sites, you can usu-
ally find their AP policies hiding somewhere. Many times, thankfully, a college’s AP policy
comes up right away in a nice, clear chart, the way the College Board dreamed it would.
If the high tech Internet doesn’t work for you, call the admissions office of the schools you’re
interested in and ask them where you can find their AP policy in writing. You can get the
phone numbers of your prospective colleges from your school advisor.
When you’re in the right place on the Net, make print out policy. Beware the colleges that
have no clear AP policy. Some backward schools seem to think AP stands for Aunt Polly. Only
apply to schools that give you AP credit (see Chapter 1 to find out why). If you’re in the final
strokes of choosing between two colleges, double-check to make sure each college’s AP
policy covers U.S. History.
Scoping Out What’s Going to Be on the Test
The AP U.S. History exam is a comprehensive monster composed of 80 multiple-choice ques-
tions and 3 essay questions. You have to face one big Document-Based Question (DBQ), where
the CB shows you a bunch of original documents and you write about the sources plus the
knowledge you (hopefully) possess about the events behind the sources. The other two
essay questions come in two groups of two questions each; you get to choose one question
from each group to answer. The exam is graded 50/50 between multiple-choice and essays.
Author and playwright Norman Mailer once said, “If I knew what inspiration was, I certainly
wouldn’t tell you.” If I knew exactly what questions will be on your AP U.S. History test, I
would have to be one of the six teachers on the AP U.S. History Development Committee —
and even the teachers don’t know until the last minute. Also, if I knew and told, I’d have to go
to teacher jail, where they don’t give recesses. And the CB Office of Testing Integrity — sort
of like a testing FBI — would catch up with you and strip you of your crooked, unearned 5
score. You can’t have that!
But I can have a look at past tests to see what subjects tend to come up again and again and
give you an idea based on professional observations. I can judge the trends by seeing the
direction the big test is moving. You can also look at the announced subject material and

Advanced Placement in the year 0
Standardized testing for advancement in China started
with the Han Dynasty, around the year 0. And, like an
Oriental College Board, Chinese placement exams kept
cranking out the grades for almost 2,000 years. Over the
years, the tests included military strategy, civil law, rev-
enue and taxation, agriculture and geography, and
plenty of confusing Confucian religious classics. If you
think the AP U.S. History test is hard, try taking it in
Chinese characters!
Students studied for a year in tiny cells that contained
two boards that they moved around to make either a bed
or a desk. The actual tests took two days, but the 5 per-
cent who passed each got great government jobs. Later,
the Chinese standardized tests inspired Western
nations, including the United States, to have civil serv-
ice exams. One day in the 1900s, an education guy said,
“Hey, we could invent the College Board and head whip
students with Advance Placement tests!” Just be glad
you don’t have to move around boards to make a bed.

time-period proportions to help choose which baskets to put most of your studying eggs in.
In the following sections, you get a look at AP U.S. History teaching priorities as outlined by
the very folks who make up the test. In Chapter 3, I show you how to study the way the Test
Masters recommend. You also discover how to find previous tests to help you prepare for
this year’s AP challenge.
Don’t mess with AP Test security. These guys have a sense of humor comparable to Homeland
Security when someone pops a balloon. Forbidden actions include discussing multiple-choice
questions from the exam with anybody — even your AP teacher. You can talk about essay
questions a day after the test (to make sure that test takers in all the time zones in the world
are done writing). The CB doesn’t let you talk about multiple-choice questions period because
it may use the questions again.
Acing the facts that mean the most
You can get a good grade — even a 5 — without having to correctly answer all the multiple-
choice questions presented to you. In fact, if you get only half the multiple-choice points and
score big on the essays, you can walk away with the top grade. That said, you really need to
stock up on knowledge about social trends and movements, which is particularly useful for
tying together essay responses. The good news is that this information also helps you
answer multiple-choice questions.
The AP U.S. History exam is center-loaded, with a bias toward post-colonial history between
1800 and 1950. That doesn’t mean you should neglect the way-back and only-just-recently
events; you have plenty of points to gain from these time periods as well. But as you review,
put a special polish on the time periods with the most credit attached. According to the com-
mittee that designs the test, the questions break down as follows:
20 percent: Pre-Columbian era to 1789
45 percent: 1790 to 1914
35 percent: 1915 to the present
Historians have a natural aversion to recent events; when happenings are still news, many
don’t consider them history yet. Sorting out the importance of recent events is difficult. For
instance, Paris Hilton gets a lot of media coverage, but does that mean she belongs in the his-
tory books? Besides, getting too near the present can step on some still-sensitive political
toes. Also, the AP test occurs in early May, and school often runs into June. Your friends at the
College Board are kind enough to not test you on material you haven’t covered yet. So don’t
spend much time on last year’s hot topics; the AP test probably doesn’t know they exist yet.
Why do the 300 years of early American history get less coverage than the 200 plus years
after the birth of the United States as a nation? Well, this is U.S. History, and the U.S. didn’t
exist before 1776. More important, history is what humans choose to save to tell us about
themselves. Historians believe people can learn more about their present selves from study-
ing, for example, the rise of democratic ideas in the 1800s than from analyzing cod-fishing
stories from the 1600s. But don’t give up on that 20 percent of credit from before the
Constitution; it’s not just fishing stories.
Syncing your mind with the big test
I’m sure you want to make a little visit inside the minds of the Exam Mavens — the people
who make up the big AP test. But you’d probably get in trouble with the AP security goons,
and the mind-melding machine isn’t quite ready yet anyway. Fortunately, the AP test bosses
22
Part I: College Credit, Here I Come! 

are willing to identify how their thinking is balanced between continuous themes in U.S.
History and time-ordered chronological event topics. Themes are social and economic trends
that happen over time; events are political happenings like wars and elections that happen in
one specific period.
Balance has been a big issue in the history field since the end of the bad old days of names-
dates-and-places boring history. When the New History broke out of the egg in the 1960s,
professors were so glad to be liberated that some of them went overboard; they stopped
emphasizing event topics all together and just went in for social themes. This disparity led to
students cheering when the rebels closed in on Lisbon in the Spanish Civil War, only to find
out later that those were bad Fascist rebels. Names and dates came back, but they’re now
brought to life by human social themes.
Today, the test writers still stress the social and cultural trends that underlie political events,
but now it’s important to know how trends and events fit in time. Dates are the gallon-sized
baggies that hold social trends and political events together. You don’t have to remember spe-
cific years, but you should have an idea of the decade in which trends and events unfolded.
The 80 multiple-choice questions that make up 50 percent of your score on the Big AP are a
natural hang-out space for questions about hard and fast political events. It’s hard to fit the
nuances of schools of painting into five-choice questions and relatively easy to ask multiple-
choice questions about elections and wars. Even so, four out of ten multiple-choice ques-
tions will be about cultural trends rather than political events. (You can find more about
multiple-choice questions in Chapter 4.)
The Document-Based Question (DBQ), worth 22.5 percent of your total score, is all about the
social and economic trends illustrated by political events. You’ll be analyzing actual letters,
pictures, and reports from a historic period and bringing in your own outside information to
explain the era of the documents given to you. (More about answering the Document-Based
Question is in Chapter 5.)
Two regular essay questions are each worth 13.75 percent of your overall score on the AP.
These questions each require about a five paragraph essay. If your essays make a good argu-
ment using social, political, and economic happenings, you’re on your way to a high score.
(You can discover more about creating teacher-friendly essays in Chapter 6.)
Don’t get too stressed by the difference between themes and topics, or by the definition of
what’s social against what’s political history. Teachers can’t agree themselves, and you see a
lot of overlap. If you get the names, meanings, and time periods down, you’ll do fine.
Digging the themes
Themes are the melody that runs through U.S. history. In the form of social or cultural his-
tory, these themes show up in 40 percent of the multiple-choice questions on the AP exam.
Additionally, themes are the lifeblood of the essays. You can improve your score on that
section of the exam by referencing at least two themes in every essay answer. Here, in alpha-
betical order, is a list of what the AP U.S. History Development Committee considers to be
important themes in American History:
 American Diversity: The roles of class, ethnicity, race, and gender in the history of
America. Discuss different groups in the United States and the relationships between
them; this theme is about how groups in the United States are different.
 American Identity: What it means to be an American, as seen in different parts of the
United States and different periods in history. Just what is the American national char-
acter, and how are Americans different from other people in the world? This is what
teachers call American exceptionalism. You may think of American Identity as how
groups in the United States are the same.
23
Chapter 2: Wringing the Highest Score out of What You Know

 Culture: What was popular and earth-shaking in different periods of U.S. history?
This category includes literature, art, philosophy, music, theater, television, and film.
Culture is what you can tell about the real beliefs of the country from what people
watch, read, and sing.
 Demographic Changes: The political, economic, and social effects of immigration and
movements within the United States. It also covers the way marriage, birth, and death
rates have changed. How many kids were in the average family? How long did people
live? What was the overall population size and density? Counting people helps in
understanding trends.
 Economic Transformations: The effects of business and personal financial incentives
on the United States, including buying, selling, and the changes in business structure
(from small store owners to big corporations). You can discuss the effects of labor
unions and consumer movements. Basically, if you want to get a handle on why people
do things, check out their bank accounts.
 Environment: How the expansion of the United States has affected the environment in
different periods of history. What’s the impact of more people, the expansion of cities
and suburbs, pollution, and industrialization? Mother Nature has limits that affect
human history.
 Globalization: The relation of the United States to the rest of the world, from the first
colonies in the 1500s to the present. This topic includes global leadership and domi-
nance, colonialism, mercantilism, imperialism, development of markets, and cultural
exchange. The United States isn’t an island, however much isolationists want to make
it one.
 Politics and Citizenship: What Americans believe about their revolutionary past, the
importance of democracy, and the development of the U.S. nation. What do citizenship
and civil rights mean? Just what is the United States, and who really is an American?
 Reform: The movement for social change. U.S. history has seen issues like women’s
rights, civil rights, anti slavery, education, labor, public health, temperance, gay rights,
war, and government. It’s time for some changes; heck, it has always been time for
some changes.
 Religion: The variety of religious experiences and practices in the United States, cover-
ing the time period from the American Indians to the Internet. What’s the influence of
religion on economics, politics, and society? The way you view your deity and your
purpose influences everything you do.
 Slavery and Its Legacies in North America: The meaning of slavery and other forms of
forced labor (such as indentured servitude) in different periods of the nation’s devel-
opment. Subthemes include the money behind slavery and its racial dimensions, move-
ments of resistance, and the long-term political, economic, and social consequences of
slavery. After all, many of the leaders who founded the United States had the time to
talk about freedom because slaves were doing their work for them.
 War and Diplomacy: How armed fights changed the United States, from the time before
Columbus to the early-21st century war on terrorism. Perhaps the United States is a
peace-loving nation, but the fact remains that the nation has been involved in a war
about once every 20 years.
Don’t get so caught up in the story of certain themes that you forget the decades in which
they happened. You don’t have to know the exact years for themes, because most of them
are continuous. However, you do need an idea of the development of trends, at least in ten-
year periods. Abolition, for instance, was minor in the 1820s but huge in the 1850s. Also, it
helps to root trend answers to the approximate year of key developments. For example, The
Liberator was an important abolitionist newspaper founded by William Lloyd Garrison in
1831. This newspaper founding marks the beginning of the growth of abolition in the north-
ern United States.

Calling out topics on the College Board
Although the melody of historical themes makes for interesting understanding, historical
events and topics still pay the rent when it comes to your overall AP exam score. Here are
the important chronological event topics specified by the College Board in its U.S. History
Course Description:
1. Pre-Columbian Societies: The first people who lived in the Americas. American Indian
empires in the Southwest, Mesoamerica, and the Mississippi Valley. American Indian
cultures of North America before the explorers arrived. Before Columbus sailed the
ocean blue, for thousands of years American Indians lived true.
2. Transatlantic Encounters and Colonial Beginnings (1492–1690): Explorers meet the
American Indians. Spain’s empire in North America. The English settle (perfect name)
New England and most of the Mid-Atlantic and South regions, and the French set 
up in Canada. Settlers arrive, sometimes with hope and sometimes in chains, in the
Chesapeake region. Religious diversity leads to different American colonies. Early revolts
against colonial authority: the Glorious Revolution, Bacon’s Rebellion, and the Pueblo
Revolt. The colonists got off to a rocky start — fighting each other wasn’t too smart.
3. Colonial North America (1690–1754): How the population expanded with more immigra-
tion. Trade made the port cities like Boston and New York grow while farming expanded
in the country. The impact of the Enlightenment and the First Great Awakening. How
British and other colonial governments affected North America. Don’t forget, as much of
American history passes before the Revolution as after it.
4. The American Revolutionary Era (1754–1789): The French and Indian War leads
to the Imperial Crisis and fighting back against British rule. Next comes the U.S.
Revolution, state constitutions and the Articles of Confederation, and the federal
Constitution. Local freedom is going too slow; been great, Great Britain, but gotta go.
5. The Early Republic (1789–1815): Washington, Hamilton, and the building of a national
government. Political parties begin with the Federalists and Republicans. The meaning
of Republican Motherhood and education for women. Effects of Jefferson’s presidency.
The Second Great Awakening. Settlers move into the Appalachian West. The growth of
slavery and free black communities. American Indians fight back. The causes and out-
comes of the War of 1812. It’s great to be free, but what will we be?
6. Transformation of the Economy and Society in Antebellum America: The United
States settles down to raise a family. The start of industrialization and changes in social
and class structures. How steamboats, trains, and canals created a national market
economy. Immigration and reactions against it from nativists. Planters, independent
farmers, and slaves in the South grow cotton.
7. Transformation of Politics in Antebellum America: The development of the second
party system. Federal authority and the people who fought against it: judicial federal-
ism, tariff controversy, the Bank of the U.S., and states’ rights debates. Jacksonian
democracy increases popular government but has limitations. So, besides getting
ready for the Civil War, what else did you do?
8. Religion, Reform, and Renaissance in Antebellum America: Shaking up what people
believe. Evangelical Protestant revivals, ideals of home life, and social reforms.
Transcendentalism and utopian communities. American growth in literature and art.
9. Territorial Expansion and Manifest Destiny: Moving on West and stepping on some
toes. Americans push American Indians across the Mississippi river to the West. The
United States adds new territory, Western migration and cultural changes, and the
beginning of U.S. imperialism and the Mexican War.
10. The Crisis of the Union: Oops, couldn’t keep that slavery thing in the closet forever.
Slaveholder-versus-antislavery arguments and conflicts, the Compromise of 1850 and
popular sovereignty, and The Kansas-Nebraska Act. The emergence of the Republican
Party, the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln, and the South leaves the Union.

the natives are restless. Rivals for the West: miners, homesteaders, ranchers, and
American Indians. Building the Western railroads. Government policy toward American
Indians. Men and women, race, and ethnicity in the far West. What Western settlement
did to the environment.

Getting Ready for the Big Day
As test day gets closer, make the most of the time you have. Although you’d ideally be read-
ing this on a calm day months before the test, chances are you’re getting close to crunch
time. Here’s how to spend the precious time you have profitably.
Say you have only a month to go before the exam that spans the centuries. Now more than
ever, paying attention to your schedule and timing determines your success. Here are a few
basic tips to get you started:
 Be true to your school; stick with the AP History review your teacher has planned
for you.
 Work your way through this book like you do your school review — a little each day.
 Plan a time to study that you can stick to. A lot of brainiacs spend a little time studying
at night before they crash and a little time first thing in the morning while the bagels
are toasting. That way, you can sleep on the information and double-check it in the
morning with a clear mind.

Chapter 2: Wringing the Highest Score out of What You Know

At some time during this month, the age-old dilemma of “Study or a show?” will arise. Before
you jump in the car, remember that you’re on a mission for college credit. You can be saving
a whole college course by getting a good score on the AP, and the college course you can
avoid would otherwise have cost you and your dear parents thousands of dollars. And just
think about how much better it’ll be to party later with advanced credit (and money) under
your belt. Meanwhile, do something you like that goes well with studying. Perhaps you can
take a lovely run in the park or treat yourself with some double-good premium ice cream!
The following sections show you how to creep up on the AP with preparation so complete
that the actual exam will come as naturally as opening a candy bar in the dark.
Building a winning study strategy
Yes, it’s a bummer that you have to study. Studying is work, but hey, you get paid with
grades. Think of it like you’re working in sales on commission; the harder you work (study),
the more money you make (the more college credit you get). Given the harsh realities, you
should make it as fun and easy as possible by turbocharging your study time with a few
choice moves.
How much should you study? That depends; how smart are you? Despite what you’ve heard or
read and all the head banging you’ve done in school, smart doesn’t mean good, brave, or even
successful in the world. Henry Ford could barely remember the capital of his own state, but he
built an industrial empire. You, my friend, have some facts to remember to get through the big
test, but they should be facts that you know how to use — not just rote memory pop-ups.
The following list presents some tips to help you set up your studying schedule and strate-
gies in order to maximize your strengths (and your grade):
 Even within the field of intelligence, there are different kinds of smart. Some people can
photocopy facts in their head; you can call them Copy Machines. Some folks may not
be able to remember facts as well, but they can write essays like Shakespeare. You
have the kind of intelligence that The Force gave you, but you also can build up smarts
through exercise — just like muscles at the gym. On the AP exam, you’ll need to be a
Copy Machine and a Shakespeare, so you need to study based on your strengths and
weaknesses. If you’re good on multiple-choice, you have your Copy Machine running
strong. If you’re shaky on essays, you want to work on your inner Shakespeare.
 Study enough to know the themes and topics outlined in the earlier section “Syncing
your mind with the big test.” That college course you can avoid by getting AP credit
would’ve taken at least seven hours a week out of your life. It seems reasonable, there-
fore, to study an hour a day for the AP U.S. History exam — more if you have a thick
head for facts, and less if you can already ace through the tests in Part V of this book.
 Studying should never be just reading; it should be work with a pencil in your hand.
Write on this book; your kid brother can buy another when his time comes (Wiley
would like that!). If you can’t write in your school textbooks, mark key passages with
sticky notes.
Only highlight the most important parts (say, for example, the icon information); if you
use the highlighter to turn the whole book yellow, you’re just coloring, not studying.
 Make lists of key events and themes and write out their definitions and years (perhaps
on notecards). Always quiz yourself. What was the first state to permanently allow
women to vote? (Wyoming in 1869.) Who was the guy who took over after Lincoln?
(Andrew Johnson in 1865.) When was the Constitution ratified? (1789.) What was the
big deal about the Second Great Awakening? (It renewed personal salvation with ties to
church and social reform — 1800 to 1830s.)

Part I: College Credit, Here I Come! 

Planning out your timing
The AP U.S. History exam isn’t like a surprise pop quiz; you should have a good idea of what
the big test looks like and how it’s run. You’ll be invited to devote a chilling three hours and
five minutes of your life to searching frantically but calmly through the history hard drive of
your mind. You’ll be under the control of the test proctor, who will give you the usual warn-
ings about food, time, copying, and reading answers off your history tattoos. And you’ll have
to shift gears at least once in order to complete the two sections of the test.
Slicing up Section 1
First, you’ll have 55 minutes to answer 80 multiple-choice questions. You’ll receive a Scantron
form with tons of little ovals to fill in (with pencil, of course). With the form comes a booklet
that contains the 80 multiple-choice questions — each of which has five possible answers,
helpfully labeled from A to E. The questions are cleverly arranged from easy to hard, with
chronological years and themes sprinkled in all levels of difficulty. The changes in difficulty
come gradually; don’t expect to find yourself lost in genius palace all of a sudden. Don’t forget,
what’s hard for somebody else may be easy for you, especially if you’ve studied.
In the bad old days, the AP had a repeating time sequence of questions. You could sometimes
use this mini-chronological order of the questions like a screwdriver to pry open answers.
Recently, the Test Mavens got wise to this strategy and begin to sprinkle time periods ran-
domly throughout the different degrees of difficulty within multiple-choice. Drat, foiled again.
Even though the multiple-choice questions in Section I take less than a third of your test
time, they’re worth half your test score.
Sailing through Section 2
Exhausted (or should I say, well-exercised) by your spiral through multiple-choice levels,
now you must begin to write history in Section II. You’ll get a question book containing one
DBQ, or Document-Based Question (Section A), and four regular essay questions arranged in
two groups of two questions each (Sections B and C). You answer one question from Section
B and one from Section C. You’ll get 15 minutes during which you can only review the ques-
tions. During this time, you can’t start an essay, but you can read and take notes in the ques-
tion booklet. Trust me, you won’t get bored.
The DBQ would be entertaining if it weren’t so stressful. You’ll see anywhere from seven to
ten documents; they could be diaries, letters, speeches, charts, graphs, political cartoons —
almost anything you can read. Maybe someday the test will be electronic and have videos
and ring tones! For now, use the first 15 minutes to read those documents and think about
how you can bring them together with some relevant outside knowledge to write a stunning
DBQ essay.
If you have time in your 15 minutes of calm before the writing storm, you’re allowed to begin
choosing the one question from the latter two sections that you least hate facing. Don’t
bother; just concentrate on the DBQ during the reading period. The other essay questions
will take care of themselves when you get to them. Don’t cloud your brain — you have plenty
of documents and outside facts to marshal for the DBQ. Starting with the DBQ, you have a
total of 1 hour and 55 minutes to write the three essays.
The suggested time for the DBQ essay is 45 minutes. The suggested time for the two regular
essays is 35 minutes a piece. You can discover everything you ever wanted to know about
the DBQ in Chapter 5. You get the inside scoop on the regular essay questions in Chapter 6.
“Wait, I have something else to say!” Don’t get caught out of time on the big exam. Nothing is
worse than having important, grade-winning points to make in an essay and no time left to
write them. Before the exam, practice writing five paragraph essays in 30 minutes. Get used
to timing yourself as you write. Better to write short and smart than long and pointless.

Chapter 2: Wringing the Highest Score out of What You Know

Bracing for test-induced panic
As the big day approaches, no matter how hard you study, you’ll feel a bit scared. So much
history to cover, so little time. What was that XYZ Affair? (Diplomatic tension with France,
1797.) How many Great Awakenings were there? (Two — one before the Revolution and one
after.) The more you know, the more you know you don’t know.
Pre-show jitters are normal; just ask any singer. Chill out, Chillsky! The AP exam isn’t like the
tests you took in school, where you were supposed to know everything. It’s impossible to
know everything about U.S. History. If you don’t believe that, just ask your teacher. The AP
exam is more like an endurance race; even if you limp over the finish line, you deserve
applause. Nobody is supposed to get all the questions right. The test has a theoretical per-
fect score of 180, but you can get the highest grade of 5 with a raw score as low as 117. It’s
as if the grade of A on AP U.S. History starts at 65 percent.
For more on relaxing yourself before the exam, I present the Chillax approach to psyching
the test in Chapter 3.
The AP U.S. History test is curved to ensure a certain proportion of high grades every year.
You just have to finish ahead of enough other people taking the exam to get ahead of the
curve. It’s like the story of two guys running away from a grizzly bear. The first guy stops,
takes out a pair of running shoes, and starts to put them on. The second guy says “Don’t be
stupid, you can’t outrun a bear.” Replies the first guy: “I don’t have to outrun a bear; I just
have to outrun you.” Feel better?

Part I: College Credit, Here I Come! 
Getting buff on test exercise
It helps to take practice tests to get ready for the Big AP.
Part V of this book contains two tough exams. But better
than any printed test are the exam questions you make up
yourself while you study. Creating Challenge Questions
means turning the history that you read into questions that
challenge you to find the answers as you study.
Asking yourself questions as you study is the key to the
Challenge Question study secret. Make every major
heading you see into a question; that’s what the big exam
is going to do to you. For example, if the heading in the
history text says Jacksonian Democracy transforms the
United States, you say to yourself, “Name the ways
Jacksonian Democracy transformed the United States.”
Find the answers about Jacksonian Democracy as
you’re reading the section and write them down. Close
your eyes and repeat the question and the answers.
Study the practice tests in Part V until you have the form
down cold.
To get good at making your own Challenge Questions
while you study, though, you need to actually take a
sample AP U.S. History Test. Study the 2001 and 2006 AP
U.S. History Released Exams to find out what actual past
tests looked like. These exams may be available at your
school; ask your AP teacher or order them from the
College Board Web site.
Also, sit down and take one of the tests in Part V. Time
yourself and stick to the schedule you’ll have to follow
on test day. How many multiple-choice questions did you
get right? Was there a certain time period you were a
little foggy on? How did the essays come out? Ask some-
body you trust who’s wise in the ways of history to score
them using the criteria in Chapters 5 and 6. Need more
experience writing these short but loaded factual sto-
ries? Practice until writing them becomes easier.
Don’t get too stressed if you didn’t do well the first time
through a practice test. That’s why you call them prac-
tice. Use the knowledge you just gained to put the
Challenge Questions studying method to work where it
will do the most good for you. Visit U.S. History a little
each day!

Chapter 3
Psyching Yourself Up for the Big Test
In This Chapter
 Making the most of the way you learn best
 Relaxing your body to concentrate your mind
 Taking the test with icy cool
T
he first two chapters of this friendly guide show you how to use Challenge Question
history review and political, economic, and social (PES) information to squirrel away
some choice information that you can put down on the big day. The next three chapters
show you how to leap gracefully across each of the three question types standing between
you and that golden moment when you hand in your completed exam with a secret thumbs-
up. (You’ve got to keep that thumbs-up secret, because you cannot forget the Ironclad Rule
of Fake Test Agony: Just act out mild despair with the other students as you leave the exam.
Complaining that all tests are hard and unfair is the only way to maintain social respectabil-
ity as you quietly ace your way to the top.)
Before you look at the next three chapters to get down to cases of slaying the exam demons —
multiple-choice questions, Document-Based Questions (DBQs), and regular essay questions —
it’s time for a little talk: How is your AP U.S. History confidence level at this point?
Success comes from more than just what you know; it also comes from how you use what
you know. (It’s not just the meat; it’s also the motion.) You’ll succeed on the day of the big
test because you’re going to have an unstoppable combination of knowledge and attitude.
This chapter gives you pointers on how to prepare yourself for exam day so you stay calm,
cool, and collected. Don’t worry if you’re a little anxious; that’s good. You can use that nerv-
ous energy to slay the test dragon. This chapter gives you pointers on how to do it.
Taking Advantage of the Way You Learn Best 
As I outline in Chapter 2, your goal is to arm yourself with information by studying U.S. his-
tory and the AP exam for an hour a day. Think about your study time as powering up with
items to beat the big test boss. You know you need Copy Machine smarts to remember 
PES events with the approximate times they happened. Copy Machine power comes from
active review with its best friend: Challenge Questions.
But how is any dude or dudette going to remember all that history? The secret is mnemonics,
the art and science of memory. Naturally, just to mess with your head, the big brains over
in the Word Design Department picked a word for memory that’s both hard to remember and
tricky to say. Just pronounce it without the first letter, and you’ll be close enough. You may
remember a demon kneeing you in the stomach to get you to remember: demonic mnemonics.

Mnemonics is the psychological system behind psyching yourself up for the big exam. There
are three basic ways of learning. You’re going to lean naturally on the way you learn the best.
 It turns out about 65 percent of humans prefer to learn things visually and, therefore,
are visual learners. That’s why they invented writing instead of just singing or tap-
dancing history to one another.
 Another 30 percent are auditory learners — that is, they prefer to learn things through
sound. That makes them good at learning from lectures and songs, but not as good at
grabbing facts through reading. Auditory folks would be in favor of singing history.
 That leaves the final 5 percent, whose favorite way of learning is through kinesthetic
movement.
Sorry — no tap-dancing for history review. I cover these learning preferences in more detail
in the later sections. Consider each of these preferences carefully and see whether any of
them apply to you. If so, you can take full advantage of your preference to make studying for
the AP U.S. History exam easier and less stressful.
Just because you have a preference for one kind of learning doesn’t mean you can’t remem-
ber facts in the other ways as well. Also, you can use strategies for maximizing the kind of
learning that comes most naturally. Even better, visiting another learning style helps break
up your intellectual traffic jam. You become DJ Mixmaster Smarty.
Studying by sight
Visual people remember colorful emotional images best. Make a picture of a bright, loud reli-
gious revival in your mind when you read about the First Great Awakening. You may people
the scene with Jonathan Edwards holding a sign that says “1730 — Revolution’s Coming.”
That’s visual learning.
Writing key events into your own notes helps fix them in your mind. This technique can be
especially useful for timelines. History is, at its core, the study of change over time. Write out
a timeline for major topics so that you can see the big picture of how the changes in one field
developed. You could make a timeline of women’s rights, U.S. expansion, the 50-year run-up
to the Civil War, and other key themes.

Be a poet, and you won’t blow it
Most people have heard this mnemonic: “In 1492,
Columbus sailed the ocean blue.” Sadly, basing an entire
essay response around this fact is hard, but it’s a hint:
You can make facts as stick-to-your-brain as a song in
your head you just can’t stop singing. How about this
one? “Thirty days hath September, April, June, and
November. When short February’s done, all the rest have
thirty-one. . .” When is the last time you used hath in
daily conversation? But there it is, stuck in your brain.
In addition to bad poetry, you can make up first-letter
lists. Did you ever wonder Why Ants Jump More and
More All June? Bet not, but the first letters of those silly
words help you remember the first seven presidents:
Washington, J. Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe,
J.Q. Adams, and Jackson. In the same way, HOMES can
help you remember the Great Lakes: Huron, Ontario,
Michigan, Erie, and Superior. This technique is stupid,
perhaps, but what’s un-stupid is being able to remember
an impressive list when AP time rolls around.

Flash cards don’t work for everybody, but they have saved more than one determined student
on the AP. At the very least, you get to write down terms and their meaning one more time.
The more you write stuff down, the better you’ll remember it. Studying is a great example of
instant karma. Research shows that students who put 50 percent more time into preparation
do 50 percent better on big tests. You may want to color-code your flash cards by era. Just
don’t go overboard and spend more time decorating beautiful flash cards than using them.
Studying by sound
If you’re having trouble remembering the facts you read, you may be much better as an audi-
tory learner (you need to hear to remember). If you’re a passive learner, hunched over your
desk watching the textbook pages of history facts flip slowly by, you’ll be lucky to remember
10 percent of what you see. Even people who don’t prefer to learn things by sound remember
20 percent of what they hear. So close your eyes, visualize the facts with their dates, and say
them to yourself.
As an auditory fan, while studying, make sure to say things like “First Great Awakening,
Jonathan Edwards, 1730 — Revolution’s Coming” out loud repeatedly to yourself with your
eyes closed. (Don’t do this in a crowded coffeehouse; people may think you’re crazy instead
of brilliant. There’s such a fine line.)
Even if you do prefer sound to sight, also try forming the words into a vivid picture in your
mind; most folks can remember 30 percent of what they see.
A high-tech solution is available for auditory learners: You can actually scan text into a text-
to-speech program and have the facts read to you by a friendly computer voice. Check out
the programs at www.download.com.
Studying through movement
Kinesthetic learners are hands-on people who concentrate better and learn more easily when
movement is involved. Although you can’t dance your way through the Big AP, you can learn
to use movement sense to help your memory.
Kinesthetic people can make a scene into a movie in their heads. Just imagine Jonathan
Edwards pounding the pulpit and waving a “1730 — Revolution’s Coming” banner. It doesn’t
matter how silly the image is; in fact, the sillier it is, the better. Humor is an easy emotion
to remember, and anything out of the ordinary is better than trying to remember gray words
on paper.
If you have to see the facts spatially because you are a kinesthetic learner, try putting color-
coded sticky notes containing key facts in date order along a route that you take through
your house. Walk that route several times, stopping to associate each fact with where you
are standing. That way, you can associate facts with known locations. Don’t leave the sticky
notes up too long, though; your mother may come along and vacuum a hole in the 1800s.
Taking Advantage of School Resources
If your school offers after-class review sessions for AP U.S. History, be there. Your teacher
can’t slip and tell you exactly what is going to be on the test, because he doesn’t know. He
does know what has been on the test in the past, however.
33
Chapter 3: Psyching Yourself Up for the Big Test

Also, review sessions are great places to practice that other smartness that is going to win a
clap-for-you score. I call this skill Shakespeare Jr., also known as short essay writing. You
weren’t very good at riding a bike until you had the chance to try again and again. You won’t
be really good at short history essays until you have written at least ten. You wouldn’t want
your first time on a bike to be at the bike races, and you don’t want your first experience with
a DBQ to be on the big test. If your school offers feedback on practice essays, make sure you
are first in line.
Streamlining Your Learning Outside Class
The topic of study skills sounds about as interesting as lint collecting, but there are some
moves that can help you get more miles to the gallon out of your learning time: 
 Have a regular study place and time, and stick to them every day.
 When you study outside class, break up your hour time into two 30-minute chunks,
with a 5-minute break between chunks.
 Review during the day, when you are really awake. An hour during daylight can be
worth 2 hours at night.
 As New Agey as this sounds, tell yourself that you strongly intend to remember what
you are studying. At the beginning of your study session, for example, say, “I am going
to remember the presidents from Abe Lincoln to Teddy Roosevelt tonight.” Research
shows that the act of seriously committing to remember improves retention as much as
50 percent. Trying and not quite making it is okay; you can always do better tomorrow.
What is not okay is just waiting to see what happens to you. You have to set a clear goal
and push hard to make it. Dreams come true because people make them come true.
 Always associate a new fact with an old one, as in “Oh, I see. John Charles Fremont
becomes the Great Pathfinder for the Republican Party as its first presidential candi-
date (1856) after he was the Great Pathfinder of the West on the trails to California
(1836–1853).”
 Study the difficult stuff first. Set some reward milestones. After you make it through the
Civil War, it’s time for a small party!
 Get emotional about the events you are studying: Women’s rights were awesome and
long overdue; slavery sucked. You remember facts that mean something to your heart,
not just your fine mind.
 Although your friends and family may not seem to be begging for the latest in your
history insights, teach them about some of the important events you are learning.
Teaching a concept to someone else more than doubles your memory of that concept.
Cramming the Night Before May Not Help
Just because lots of people cram the night before the test doesn’t make it right. You, in fact,
are much too calm for that. Or at least you’re going to be that calm. Or at a minimum, you
will fake it till you make it.
Because the AP U.S. History test involves Shakespeare Jr. (heavy writing) as well as Copy
Machine (remembering facts), you’re way better off with a rested body and fresh mind the
day of the test than you are trying to tip just one more woozy date into your tired cerebellum
the night before. As hard as it is to admit, Grandma was right: Diet, exercise, and rest are
keys to success.
34
Part I: College Credit, Here I Come! 

You’ll want to benefit from maximum sleep the two nights before the test. If you usually sleep
for seven hours on vacation, give yourself room for eight both nights. You need two nights of
good sleep, because sleep deprivation can skip a day. People can have a low-rest night, skate
through the next 24 hours on fumes, and run out of gas on the second day. You don’t want to
get stuck in AP Land.
Triathletes and marathon racers knock off training two days before their event to build up an
energy reserve. You can study your regular amount up to the last day, but you should knock
off anything that distracts your mind or body two days before the big test. Replace coffee,
junk food, and media with exercise and relaxation techniques. Kick up your exercise routine
by 50 percent; more exercise keeps you calm and helps you think.
Cooling Out Pretest Anxiety
If you’re a worrier, be honest with yourself. Are you worried because you really haven’t pre-
pared for the test? Here’s the reality check: Have you gotten decent grades in your high
school AP U.S. History course? Are you following your hour-a-day test-prep schedule? If the
answer to those two questions is yes, you need to deal with your real problem: chronic anxi-
ety. This condition is nothing to be ashamed of; the United States itself once suffered from
overwhelming anxiety. In the inaugural words of longest-serving president Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, “We have nothing to fear but fear itself — nameless, unreasoning, unjustified
terror which paralyzes needed efforts.” If you have done the study basics but are restless,
check out the relaxation techniques later in the following sections. Relaxation doesn’t just
keep you comfortable; staying loose also helps you perform better on the test. You are going
to be too cool to be a fool for a feeling that paralyzes needed efforts.
If your worry is justified because you really haven’t done the preparation you need, consider
the words of somebody who was just the opposite of a famous president. That would be
Death Valley Scotty. In the early 1900s, Scotty was a prospector in the hottest place in the
United States: Death Valley, California. Scotty never found gold, but he did find a beautiful
oasis and many adventures, laughs, and friends. Scotty said, “There’s just two things ain’t
worth worrying about: things you can change and things you can’t.” If it is already too late to
study, consider that the lesson you’re about to learn, no matter how painful, is cheap tuition
for the rest of your life. If you still have time to get a study program together, start working
right now. The effort you make will take your mind off your anxiety.
In the following three sections are professional techniques to buy yourself some worry-free
time while you improve your sleep and concentration in the weeks before the test.

Chapter 3: Psyching Yourself Up for the Big Test
Think they’re having a good time overseas? They’re not
While Americans are sweating the APs and SATs, stu-
dents in Japan are attending juku, or private cram
schools. Japanese students sometimes go to juku every
day after school and up to 16 hours a day on weekends
to prepare for “examination hell” in January, which will
decide their university fates. Row upon row of quiet stu-
dents stare at the blackboard. Kids in the back even look
through binoculars to grasp every word.
Meanwhile, in jolly old England, students are obsessing
the A levels. A levels come in a variety of subjects, just
like the APs, and you need to pass at least three to get into
a good university. U.K. schools have grades like those in
the United States, except that the land of Harry Potter 
has not forgotten about E. Average grade distribution is
10 percent A, 15 percent B, 10 percent C, 15 percent D,
and 20 percent E. A further 20 percent are allowed an O-
level pass, which is sort of like saying, “Thanks for show-
ing up.” The real flunkies get a U and have to play in
rock-and-roll bands.

Using progressive relaxation
Lots of people, auditory learners or not, feel better hearing progressive-relaxation steps
read out loud to them. You can get a spoken recording of relaxation instructions on the Web
(cdbaby.com/cd/jmartin). Many slightly different versions of this technique are avail-
able; all of them work if you let them.
Relaxation is a natural state: it’s what you do when you are asleep. You can learn to do pro-
gressive relaxation while you’re awake and use it to clear your mind. First, get into comfort-
able clothing and choose a quiet space. Then:
1. Lie flat on your back, with your eyes closed.
2. Feel your feet getting heavy. Consciously relax them, and let them sink down. Start
with your toes and move up your foot to your ankles.
3. Feel your knees getting heavy. Consciously relax them, and let them sink down.
4. Feel your upper legs and thighs getting heavy. Consciously relax them, and feel
them sink down.
5. Feel your abdomen and chest while you breathe. Consciously let them relax. Let
your breathing be deep and regular. Let your abdomen and chest sink down.
6. Feel your back down to your upper legs. Consciously relax, and let your back sink
down.
7. Feel your hands getting heavy. Consciously relax them, and feel them sink down.
8. Feel your arms getting heavy. Consciously relax them, and feel them sink down.
9. Feel your shoulders getting heavy. Consciously relax them, and feel them sink down.
10. Feel your head and neck getting heavy. Consciously relax your neck, and feel your
head sink down.
11. Feel your mouth and jaw. Pay attention to your jaw muscles, and unclench them if
they are tight. Feel your mouth and jaw relax.
12. Feel your eyes. Are you forcibly closing your eyelids? Consciously relax your eyelids,
and feel the tension slide off your eyes.
13. Mentally scan down your body. If you find any place that’s still tense, consciously
relax that place, and let it sink down.
14. Lie still for 5 minutes.
Practicing deep breathing
As simple as it seems, deep breathing is a great way to relax your body and concentrate
energy, which is why it’s an important part of spiritual, meditation, and martial-arts tradi-
tions around the world.
1. Sit comfortably, straight up, with a loose waist and your stomach relaxed.
Don’t worry about looking fat; no one is watching. A chair is fine; you don’t have to sit
cross-legged on the floor, wearing a turban. Just check that your back is comfortably
straight and your middle is loose and relaxed.
2. Let your whole self relax.
You can work your way from bottom to top, as in the progressive-relaxation technique
in the preceding section.

Part I: College Credit, Here I Come! 

3. Begin to inhale slowly through your nose. Count to four as you fill your lungs in four
parts from bottom to top. Breathe in slowly, taking about 5 seconds for a full breath.
4. Hold your breath for a couple of seconds.
5. Quietly relax, and let the air flow all the way out through your mouth.
6. Wait a few seconds, and do it again.
Breathe in through your nose in four sections; let the air out completely through your
mouth in a long, peaceful “Ahh” or “Ohm.” (That’s the dial tone of the universe.)
7. If you get dizzy, you’re going too fast. Slow down.
8. Imagine that you’re floating, and pretty soon you will be.
Using Quiet Ears
This technique works like listening to a seashell at the beach. Since it stills the world around
you, Quiet Ears helps you connect to your own inner strength. This technique works for
everybody, but especially if you are easily distracted by outside sounds:
1. Close your eyes.
2. Place your hands loosely on top of your head.
3. Cup your hands and cover both your ears.
You hear the slow, rushing sound of your own blood circulating. This is a good thing.
4. Listen to this sound while you count to 10, ten times.
5. Relax your arms, and do it again.
You may find yourself breathing peacefully.
Keeping Calm and Cool on the Big Day
On the day of the test, eat a medium breakfast. You’re on your way to a performance, and
you don’t need heavy food to slow you down. Give yourself more time than you think you
need to get to the test site; no last-minute parking problems or traffic tickets should spoil
your mood. If you get to the site early, walk around. You’ll be sitting for a long time, and you
want to get your blood circulating. Don’t drink a lot of liquid. You’ll get a break in the middle,
but you don’t want to be going to the bathroom while the test clock is running. If you run
into friends, be nice, but don’t listen very hard to what they say. Watch the pros before a
race. They acknowledge one another with a nod, but they’re already in their own space.
Bring three No. 2 pencils and a good separate eraser for the multiple-choice questions. If you
change a scan-marked multiple-choice answer, you want to make sure that the mark in the
scan oval you rejected is erased completely. Bring a couple of your favorite ink pens for the
essay section. Wear a watch. You won’t be allowed to look at your cell phone, and time con-
trol is important.
Pick a spot in the test room with good light and a minimum of possibly distracting people.
You’ll get an exam packet with the Section I multiple-choice questions and the Section II
essay questions. Section I has a Scantron answer form with more than enough spaces. You
mark your answers to the 80 multiple-choice questions by filling in the correct ovals carefully
with a pencil. Section II essay questions are on a green insert; you write your answers in the
supplied pink essay book.
37
Chapter 3: Psyching Yourself Up for the Big Test

For both Section I and Section II, you can make notes in the question books but not on the
answer pages. You have 55 minutes to answer as many of the 80 multiple-choice questions as
you can. After a 10-minute break, you have 2 hours and 10 minutes to study and write three
essays. The Section II essay time begins with a mandatory 15-minute reading period. During
the reading period, you study the questions but are not allowed to begin writing the essays.
Staying wide awake in AP land
With the proctor’s word “Begin,” you open the Section I multiple-choice book and dive in.
You discover the strategy for handling multiple-choice questions in Chapter 4. For now, just
realize that the 80 questions each have 5 alternatives for a total of 400 possible answers. You
are going to be reading 400 possible answers, each of which is designed to at least minimally
suck you into picking it as the right match for its question. You will be answering multiple-
choice questions for 55 minutes, which means you have 41 seconds per question and only 8
seconds per possible answer. Don’t panic; the time is longer than it seems. Try holding your
breath for 41 seconds; you’ll feel how long that is.
You don’t have to be right about everything to score a perfect 5 on the big AP. The test grade
is curved; test mavens realize that few people are going to burn through all 80 multiple-choice
questions at 41 seconds each and come up with a perfect score. You can skate by on Section I
by getting fewer than 50 questions right and still pull it out with an aces 5 score just by getting
two-thirds of the possible Shakespeare Jr. credits for essay writing in Section II.
Avoiding a multiple-choice panic
Panicking is something to avoid at all times during the test, but especially during the multiple-
choice section. What panic can do to you on multiple-choice questions is make you lose 
concentration and stop reading carefully. The situation only gets worse; the reality is that the
questions get harder as you move through the 80 mini-challenges.
Don’t stop to freak out. If you aren’t sure about a question, cross off the answer choices that
you do know are wrong in the question book. If you can cross out only one, do it, and move
on. Keep going. Most people don’t get through all the questions. You are refusing to panic —
just moving along harvesting all the good questions that you know. After you’ve got the 
low-hanging fruit, go back and work on the tougher questions. Use every minute to complete
multiple-choice questions that you skipped earlier and to double-check the answers you’ve
already marked.
Getting all the way to the end has a time-sequence wrong-answer elimination advantage. You
learn what this mouthful means in Chapter 4.
Don’t outsmart yourself on multiple-choice. Save double-checking for last, because you do
not want to trap yourself by overthinking. Usually, your first hunch is your best shot; you
don’t get any smarter by squinching up your eyebrows. Obsessing over every question
as you go only slows you down. If you have time for a recheck, don’t change any answers
unless you’re sure those answers are wrong.
38
Part I: College Credit, Here I Come! 

Tuning up at break time
When 55 minutes are up, the proctor will say: “Stop working. Close your booklet, and put
your answer sheet on your desk.” You’ve got a 10-minute break before the Section II essay
section calls upon you to create great history fast. Use those 10 minutes to get up and walk
as far as you can from the crowd. Practice deep breathing lightly as you walk: four-count
deep inhalation through your nose and a long, peaceful exhale through your mouth. Shake
your arms; roll your shoulders and neck. This is not a time to impress people or gossip; you
are in the middle of a race. Make sure to hit the bathroom on your way back, if there’s any
chance you’ll need to go in the next 2 hours.
As you walk, think about what was good about how you did on Section I. Congratulate yourself
for the answers that you knew, and leave the other ones behind. Besides the preparation you
already have, your strongest weapon going into the Section II essay section is a positive mind.
Cruising with Shakespeare Jr. in Section II
Shakespeare Jr. is what I call short essay writing, covered in Section II of the exam. You’re
going to be having fun and earning points in Section II. Part A is the famous Document-Based
Question (DBQ). Chapter 5 is devoted to nothing but this single topic. The DBQ is perhaps
the greatest moment of high art in any history exam. For now, you don’t have to appreciate
its beauty. Just remember: Prepare before you write.
In Section II, Part B and Part C each contain two regular essay questions. Here, you get to
choose the rope with which you want to hang yourself. You’re going to pick the one question
from each of the two parts that seems the least scary. But not yet.
Before you can uncoil your pen, Section II wants you to spend 15 minutes alone with it, just
reading. Your proctor will recommend that you take the entire time to read the documents
and to scan the pictures and charts in the DBQ. This time, amazing as it may seem, the
grownup is right. The proctor can’t do anything to stop you from sailing right past the docu-
ments in Part A and having a peek at what question beasts await you in Parts B and C. Don’t
do it. Whatever is in Parts B and C will wait for you to get there. You don’t need it hanging
over your head while you do the DBQ.
As you work through the three essays, keep this positive thought in mind: Each of your com-
positions will be scored by a completely different reader who doesn’t know who you are,
what you’ve done on the other parts of the test, or even who graded your other essays. It’s 
a new day every time.
Here’s another tip on how to approach the essays: Plan before you write, making notes on
the green question insert and not in the pink answer booklet, which is only for your essays.
Look at the essays in this happy way: It’s like 2 hours and 10 minutes to grab everything you
can carry from your favorite store. You have nothing to lose. You can only gain points by
weaving the themes and topics you know into a well-argued essay.
It’s payday. Copy Machine and Shakespeare Jr. are singing together!

t’s funny, isn’t it? Fifty-five minutes seems really long when you have to get through a
whole period of that class you hate in school. But in the AP U.S. History exam, when
you’re faced with 80 multiple-choice questions, each with 5 possible answers lettered from
A to E, those same 55 minutes don’t even seem to be enough time for you to say hello.
Well, hello! Whether 55 minutes seems like enough time to you for 80 multiple-choice ques-
tions, in this chapter, I give you plenty of pointers and strategies to help you stretch the time
to fit your winning answers.
Scoping Out the Multiple-Choice Question Troll
If you look at the big AP test as payday for all the studying you’ve done, Section I is where
you can score some easy bucks. In only a third of the test time, you can earn half of the cred-
its just by confronting your old friend and enemy, multiple choice. Your trick is to avoid turn-
ing multiple choice into multiple guess.
You’re going to be getting a great grade on multiple-choice Section I because you’ll be keep-
ing your eye on the basics. Don’t waste your time on hard questions. When you’re in class,
the teacher may think you’re super smart because you remember the year the Farmer-Labor
Party was founded (1918). Face facts: The big exam doesn’t issue brownie points. You get the
same credit for answering hard questions as easy ones. Get all the easy answers before you
bang your head on the hard ones.
Think of each multiple-choice question as a tricky little troll holding a shiny piece of treasure:
one point worth of credit toward that great score you’re going to rack up on the AP. But wait —
not so fast! Mr. Troll doesn’t want to give up the treasure — and he can bite. Before you reach
in to grab the credit, scrutinize that tricky little troll carefully. Check the Question Troll out
with all the scopes: Use a periscope, a microscope, and even a telescope on each question
before you answer it. In this section, I show you how.

If you get stressed during your run through the multiple-choice warehouse, do a couple of
the deep-breathing exercises outlined in Chapter 3. Breathe in deeply through your nose in
four sections. Breathe out completely through your mouth. Don’t overdo it, and keep your
eye on the test. You’re going for a good score, not spiritual enlightenment.
Looking out for hidden points
The Question Trolls like to hide their treasure points in the most important spots. The AP
folks want you to know the key trends in U.S. history, not a bunch of board game trivia. You
don’t have to remember battles or the name of every explorer who ever leaned on a tree. The
right answer is often the broadest, most important concept.
What was the most important impact of the Great Depression of the 1930s on the United
States?
(A) It led to Prohibition.
(B) Lots of Americans were depressed.
(C) Businesses did better with less competition.
(D) The Great Depression led to an expansion of the role of government and social 
programs to protect people from poverty.
(E) The United States got off the gold standard to make more money.
Even though some of the other answers contain a little bit of truth, the only one that can be
the key concept is expansion of the role of government and social programs, choice (D). The
key concepts to study for the AP are right there in extra-black type: They’re the section head-
ings in this book and your textbook.
Beware of tricky Question Trolls! Some answer choices are attractive bait to lure you into a
quick wrong decision. You’re too smart to be fooled into saying, for the question about the
Great Depression, that it meant lots of Americans were depressed, but that answer could
sound like a fit to the uninformed. Watch out for answers that sound a little too simplistic;
they’re there to trap the simple.
44
Part II: Answering the Questions: Three Kinds, Three Strategies 
Taking a closer look at the points penalty
How come the nice College Board lets the Question Troll
bite you when you reach in for one of his treasure points
the wrong way? Test makers are the kind of people who
worked hard to make good grades all the way through
school. They hate the kind of people who party down
instead of studying and then, on the day of the test,
somehow get lucky and blow right through the exam
with a good grade they didn’t earn.
Here’s an example: Mr. Party slouches back in his chair,
picks up the Scantron answer sheet, and just makes a
nice pattern of filled-in ovals without even bothering to
read the questions (which may as well be in Greek, for
the amount of time he’s studied). For each question, he
has a one-in-five possibility of being right purely by
chance. Therefore, with average luck, out of 80 questions,
just blind chance should get him one fifth of 80, or 16
points, on the multiple-choice section. That score isn’t
enough for Harvard to call with a scholarship, but it’s 16
points more than Mr. Party deserves.
With the Question Troll taking a well-deserved nip out of
his score, our bad actor gets one quarter of a point taken
away for each wrong guess. Because his average luck
on pattern marking left him guessing wrong 64 times, he
loses one quarter of 64 points for a score of 16 lucky
points minus 16 penalty, or 0 points total — exactly what
he deserves for knowing nothing about history.
You deserve better, of course, because you’ve studied.
You may not know everything about U.S. history, but at
least you know some things.

Paying close attention to the scoring
Each right answer you snatch from a Question Troll is worth one point. If you get bitten by
picking a wrong answer, the troll takes away one-quarter point. Section I of the AP test has 80
multiple-choice questions. Suppose you answer 60 of them correctly, pick the wrong answer
12 times, and leave 8 question spaces blank because the Question Troll for those last 8 ques-
tions looks too mean to mess with. You’d get 60 points for your correct answers and lose 3
points for the ones you missed ( 1⁄4 of 12 points is 3 points), for a total of 57 points. Not bad. If
you had taken a shot at the last 8 toughie troll questions and missed every time, you’d lose
one quarter of 8 points; you’d end up losing another 2 points, for a final score of 55 points.
You get a lot if you’re right, but being wrong costs a little.
Suppose that you’re confronted by this tricky troll question:
Which treaty did away with most of the trade restrictions among the United States,
Canada, and Mexico?
(A) SALT
(B) NBA
(C) The Gulf of Tonkin resolution
(D) SDI
(E) NAFTA
Oh, my gosh! It’s alphabet soup. Your mind goes blank. Then a small light begins to shine:
Isn’t the NBA that league with balls, hoops, tall guys, and 3-point plays? Okay, you don’t play
basketball with trade restrictions, so choice (B) is wrong.
If you can eliminate only that one wrong answer, you’ve evened the odds: You have one
chance in four of guessing correctly on the remaining four choices by pure chance and three
chances in four of losing a quarter of a point. Guess this way 80 times, and you’ll theoreti-
cally be 8 points ahead: 80 questions with one out of four average luck equals 20 questions
right. Take away one quarter of 60 questions wrong, and you lose 12. You pick up 8 points on
average just by eliminating one bad response.
The odds get better if you can eliminate two bad multiple-choice answers. With random
chance, you pick up an average of 14 points on 80 questions if you can narrow each question
down to three choices. Suppose that in addition to tossing the NBA off the court, you have a
strong suspicion that the Gulf of Tonkin is a long way from the United States, Canada, or
Mexico. And you may just sneak up on the right answer directly. Don’t these three nations
make up North America? With that information to go on, you may conjure up the North
American Free Trade Agreement — also known as NAFTA — from the misty outlands of 
your mind.
The take-out lesson is this: If you can eliminate even one of the five multiple choices, guessing
pays. If you really haven’t got a clue, don’t touch the troll unless you feel lucky. Your odds of
doing damage are as good as your odds of scoring points.
Fortunately for your chances with the Question Troll, you have more than one way to get 
a clue.
45
Chapter 4: Going with Good Odds on Multiple-Choice Questions

Periscope up: Watching out for tricky words
Because trolls are tricky, make sure that you read each question carefully, twice, before you
grab one of the five answer choices. In sports, juking is when you fake out an opponent by
dodging in the opposite direction from where he thinks you’re going. Question Trolls love to
juke you. If you don’t study their moves carefully from a safe distance (as though you were
looking through a periscope) before you move in to grab an answer choice, you may well find
yourself headed in the wrong direction.
Questions meant to juke you typically contain the words EXCEPT, NOT, or LEAST. Notice that
these words are in capital letters. They’re printed this way to give you a fighting chance to
see them even if you’re in a hurry. This convention also allows the trolls to laugh righteously
if you miss something that’s right there in plain sight, capitalized. Juking words change the
direction of the question.
Gracefully dodging the EXCEPT juke
Take a close look at the following sample question:
All these important foods came to Europe from discoveries in the New World EXCEPT
(A) chocolate
(B) corn
(C) tomatoes
(D) coffee
(E) potatoes
So you’re blowing by at the rate of a question every 40 seconds; you see the terms foods,
Europe, and New World, and you think, “Oh, boy. I know — it’s got to be tomatoes, because
how did the Italians make pizza without tomatoes before they discovered the New World?”
Or you think, “It’s chocolate for sure, because I remember wondering how Europeans even
bothered to keep living in a pre-New World era without chocolate.”
This question has too many good answers — and that’s the tip-off that you’re the target of an
attempted juke. Perhaps you were going so fast that you didn’t see the word EXCEPT, even
though it’s in brazen capital letters. Even if you miss EXCEPT, all is not lost. If you read all the
choices and don’t just swallow the first bait that the troll tosses your way, you’ll begin to
notice that a lot of the answers seem to fit a little too well. Suspiciously, all but one of the
answers look like they could work. Look back at the question, and you find the juke in all
caps.
Read the whole question and all the answers. Twice.
NOT is not to be ignored!
In addition to the EXCEPT trolls, you need to watch out for questions with NOT in them.
Which of the following was NOT included in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787?
(A) procedures for organizing territory and state governments
(B) a ban on slavery
(C) guaranteed religious freedom
(D) the right to a jury trial
(E) specific reservations for American Indians
Like the EXCEPT troll, the NOT bomb is hoping you’re reading too fast to notice it lurking
there as inconspicuously as any word can that’s forced to wear capital letters. The NOT
bomb is banking on your seeing just the phrase “Northwest Ordinance of 1787,” glancing
46
Part II: Answering the Questions: Three Kinds, Three Strategies 

down at the answers, seeing one of the attractive first four answers (A) through (D), and pat-
ting yourself on the back as you rush your wrong answer to the Scantron sheet.
But you’re too smart for the NOT bomb. You’ve read the question twice, so you’ve definitely
seen the giant NOT. You’ve also read the possible answers twice, and they mostly look too
good to be true. You’ve saved yourself from disaster by careful reading. But how do you
know which of the five answers is the right one? Here are some things to consider:
 You know the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 was written by the same lovable guys who
brought you the American Revolution. Therefore, it should contain Declaration of
Independence issues such as jury trials.
 Setting up state governments is a noncontroversial housekeeping matter; it had to be
there.
 Slavery certainly was controversial, but — clue — you know the Northwest ended up
without slaves.
 Perhaps the least-noble reason for the Revolution was to let the new Americans have at
American Indian lands the British government had declared off limits. It wouldn’t make
sense to set aside specific reservations when the American Indians were still fighting to
have no settlers at all.
 The most extreme answer is (E). Take it to the bank.
When you scan a list of possible answers, especially in juke questions, look for the most
extreme outlier to be the answer you want. The most extreme choices tend to be extremely
right when it comes to answering negatively phrased juke questions. They go beyond the list
presented and just don’t quite fit in.
Last but not LEAST
The final juke word to look out for is LEAST. You’re sailing along normally, looking for the
best match between the key word in the question and those tricky multiple choices when
you come upon a LEAST. Big pause. LEAST switches up the meaning, so now you’re looking
for the worst match. But LEAST is even trickier than that. The answer can’t be wrong, and it
can’t be from outer space; it just has to be the worst fit. Check out this example.
Which of the following was the LEAST important reason Andrew Jackson was popular with
American voters in the 1820s and 1830s?
(A) opposed the Bank of the United States
(B) stood up to nullification
(C) dressed like a frontiersman
(D) supported more democracy for the common man
(E) won the Battle of New Orleans
You don’t have to worry about one of these answers being false. Because this is a LEAST
question, they’re all at least partly true. Dressing like a frontiersman seems to be pretty triv-
ial, even in a symbolic field like politics. The 1820s and 1830s had no TV and few pictures
anyway, so not many people could have seen Jackson. Choice (C), dressed like a frontiers-
man, is the LEAST reason and your best answer.
Conquering bossy words
In addition to EXCEPT, NOT, and LEAST, watch out for bossy words like complete, always,
never, only, all, every, and none. Because history almost always has exceptions, bossy words
47
Chapter 4: Going with Good Odds on Multiple-Choice Questions

that seem to cover the whole story are often the sign of a wrong answer. Take a look at the
following example:
Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves with the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 because
(A) the only reason he wanted to win the Civil War was to abolish slavery
(B) Lincoln always sided with the abolitionists
(C) the Emancipation Proclamation completely freed the slaves
(D) emancipation made political and moral sense in 1863
(E) Lincoln never made a political decision when he could make a moral one
The bossy words in (A), (B), (C), and (E) mark them for extinction from your answer choices.
Lincoln said he wanted to preserve the Union, whether it meant freeing all the slaves or 
freeing none of the slaves. Although Lincoln certainly was personally opposed to slavery, he
put being President of a united America before the cause of abolition. The Emancipation
Proclamation freed only slaves in rebel states. Lincoln was a great and honest person, but he
wouldn’t have won the Presidential election if he weren’t also an experienced politician.
Reverse engines! Bossy words are your friends when a troll tries to juke you with one of
those tricky EXCEPT, NOT, or LEAST questions. Here’s a different take on the Emancipation
Proclamation question:
Which of the following causes is NOT a part of the reason Abraham Lincoln freed the
slaves in the Emancipation Proclamation?
(A) The North had better news from the battlefield.
(B) Lincoln always sided with the abolitionists.
(C) Freeing the slaves had popular support in the North.
(D) Lincoln was personally opposed to slavery.
(E) Fleeing slaves may weaken Southern war efforts.
In this version, the very word always that made choice (B) wrong in the first question makes
it right in the juke NOT question.
Going with what you know
You’re smarter than you think. You can usually come up with more than one way to figure
out a question. When you hit a blank wall, try thinking outside the wall. Eliminating even one
bad answer choice puts the odds in your favor. Sometimes, you can rule out answers by look-
ing at them closely, like through a microscope. Here’s an example:
Upton Sinclair’s book The Jungle led to the passage of which law?
(A) the Clayton Antitrust Law
(B) the Northwest Ordinance
(C) the Pure Food and Drug Act
(D) the Stark Amendment
(E) the Hepburn Act
48
Part II: Answering the Questions: Three Kinds, Three Strategies 

Oh, my gosh, how would you know? All those boring acts look like foreign arithmetic to you.
Ah, but wait. On a slow Friday in literature class, the teacher was talking about The Jungle
not being all about vines and monkeys and stuff, but about filthy food factories. That would
lead you to (C), the Pure Food and Drug Act. Or you may just have been wrestling with the
question about the Northwest Ordinance covered earlier in this chapter, and you picked up
something about the ordinance from answering that question.
When it comes to defending yourself from the biting Question Trolls, don’t get caught with
no facts to go on. Although it’s good to be thinky, it’s even better to be knowy. When you
study history, take note of the key terms, their approximate dates, and why they’re impor-
tant. You may make this note: “Northwest Ordinance (1787 — at the beginning of U.S. govern-
ment) = rules for setting up new states from the Ohio River to the Mississippi River; no
slavery; freedom of religion; jury trials.”
Making a little knowledge go a long way
You don’t really need to know something by heart to choose the correct answer. Sometimes,
you can make a little knowledge go a long way.
American artists painting around 1900 in what was called the Realist school tended to
paint which subject?
(A) American frontier life
(B) urban scenes
(C) rural family life
(D) wild natural landscapes
(E) pastoral scenes
The answer is (B). A little time with art can go a long way. You have a vague feeling that the
late Victorians painted some pretty sentimental scenes, certainly not what you’d call
Realism. Then-common subjects like (A), (C), (D), and (E) probably wouldn’t earn a special
name like Realist school; they all blend together and make (B) stand out.
Using common sense
Sometimes, common sense alone can help you solve a problem.
When a U.S. reporter coined the phrase Manifest Destiny, he meant that
(A) the struggle for racial equality should be the purpose of America
(B) the United States should set all of South America free from colonialism
(C) America must become either all slaveholding or all free
(D) it’s the fate of the United States to cover the whole continent from ocean to ocean
(E) all Americans should pursue happiness until they’re happy all the time
Okay, your best bet is to know that Manifest Destiny means (D). But what if you just knew
that Manifest Destiny sounded like something you’d heard a lot? That would probably elimi-
nate events that didn’t happen, such as (B) and (C). You can eliminate (E) because it sounds
like a smart-aleck answer. You may know that Manifest Destiny started way before the Civil
War and that even 100 years after the outbreak of the Civil War, racial equality still didn’t
have full support. That pretty much leaves (A) out. Knowing a little and taking the time to
use your common sense can be a lifesaver.
49
Chapter 4: Going with Good Odds on Multiple-Choice Questions

Making historic eras your friend
By knowing the approximate year of a key term, you give yourself power to pry the point
from a Question Troll.
All the following were results of the First Great Awakening EXCEPT
(A) more and stronger churches
(B) the founding of new colleges and universities
(C) nationwide religious enthusiasm
(D) a return to the persecution of witches
(E) ministers with followings of thousands
The answer is (D). The First Great Awakening wasn’t about a return to the persecution of
witches. You could have scored on this question from several directions. First, the minute
you see the word EXCEPT, LEAST, or NOT, you say to yourself, “juke.” You’re looking for an
extreme that just doesn’t fit with the rest of the answers.
If you don’t know all about the First Great Awakening yet, don’t worry — I get to that in Part
III. Even if this were test day, and you still didn’t really know, you could work with whatever
dates you do have in your brain. You may know that the witch hunt thing died out in the
1690s and that the First Great Awakening didn’t occur until 40 years later. You may realize
that history is written by the winners and that they’d be unlikely to give the name Awakening
to something as ugly as burning women. You may just figure out that persecution of witches
is a standout in a list with unifying words like churches, colleges, enthusiasm, and ministers.
You know you’re better off guessing if you can eliminate one of the choices. Because (A), (C),
and (E) all sound like they belong to the same club, you can eliminate them from being the
extreme. You’d be statistically way ahead even if you had to guess between (B) and (D).
Questioning illustrations
As though they just can’t wait for the Document-Based Question later on the test, the
Question Trolls usually throw in few questions illustrated with pictures or charts. These illus-
trated questions can actually be easier than regular multiple-choice challenges. The illustra-
tion contains most of the answer; you just need to know what it’s telling you.
What does the following chart, which conveys the median personal income by educa-
tional attainment, illustrate about income and education?

(C) Everybody with a bachelor’s degree makes at least $43,143.
(D) Income tends to rise with education.
(E) These figures are the minimum salaries for each education level.
The answer is right on the page: (D), income tends to rise with education. The important
point with illustrated questions is to look hard at the picture and stick to what the illustra-
tion shows. Don’t think too hard and outsmart yourself by overinterpreting. The chart shows
median personal income, not a guarantee. Median is different from the average that most
people earn. That’s why the income advantage in this chart for a college degree is even
better than the bucks dangled before your greedy eyes in Chapter 1. Keep studying!
Sometimes, the test will ask you to identify a picture’s background information; check out
this example:
What are the era and social orientation of this cartoon?
(A) Southern Confederates
(B) Northern Democrats
(C) Slave owners, before the Civil War
(D) Northern abolitionists
(E) Reconstruction education, post–Civil War
The heart-rending subject indicates that the orientation is Northern, with strong abolitionist
sentiments.

Chapter 4: Going with Good Odds on Multiple-Choice Questions

Beating the Clock for a Good Score
Time management is a key to winning on the multiple-choice section of the test. Even though
you have only 55 minutes, you have all the time you need to pull out the easy questions and
have a good shot at the harder issues. In the following sections, I give you tips to help you
get through the multiple-choice section quickly without sacrificing accuracy.
Because the minutes make a difference, bring your own watch to the exam. You won’t be
allowed to check your cell phone or PDA, and the clock in the exam room may be wrong.
Having a watch lets you be your own time manager.
Why timing is golden
The multiple-choice section is like a run through a warehouse in which you get to keep
everything good you can find in 55 minutes. Trouble is, if you get too hung up trying to grab
cartons of gelatin, you may not get to the jewelry section. Section I moves in general from
easier to harder questions, but toward the difficult end, you may find questions that you
know by heart. That’s why you need to swing past all the questions quickly, like looking for
your friends in a crowd by panning with a telescope.
Don’t get hung up arguing with your brain. Try to scan all the questions, and then go back
and work on the issues that need a little more thinking. If ten more seconds of thinking don’t
solve the problem, move on. Hitting the side of your head with your palm won’t loosen up
the secret knowledge cave. Give quick insights a chance to arrive, but spread your attention
over as many questions as possible.
Relax. Forty seconds is longer than you think. Look at a clock with a second hand. Watch that
second hand twitch around the dial for 40 seconds. Boring, huh? That’s the interminable
time you’ll have for each question. Remember, you have a lightning-fast brain. Just think of
how fast your mind can move from school to that hot kid you see when you’re changing
classes. Now stop thinking dirty and get back to the AP.
Pacing yourself to win
As you know only too well, the AP exam has 80 multiple-choice questions. When you get your
Scantron form, make a light mark next to the answer ovals for question 20. Make another
light mark next to the answer zone for question 40. The first mark will put you one quarter of
the way through the multiple-choice race. You have 55 minutes total for the 80 questions. If
you’re running on time, you should be at question 20 about 14 minutes out of the gate. When
the testing starts, add 14 minutes to the time on your watch. When you get to question 20,
check to see whether you’re on pace. Check once more when you get to question 40. If
you’ve used more than half an hour of your 55 precious minutes, you need to pick up the
pace. If you’ve used only about 20 minutes when you hit question 40, you can afford to take a
little more time.
Using a marking trick for faster progress
When grades are on the line, smart people write and mark while they read. You, my friend,
are a smart person, so you should mark in the question book as you roll rapidly (but in a con-
trolled fashion) through the multiple-choice questions in Section I of the AP exam. Here are
some pointers to follow to make the process faster and easier for you:
52
Part II: Answering the Questions: Three Kinds, Three Strategies 

 If you’re sure that you’re locked into the right answer after reading both the question
and all the answers twice, just circle that for-sure answer in the question book, and
carefully blacken its oval on the Scantron answer form.
 If you can eliminate some but not all of the choices, cross out the answers you know
are wrong.
 If you have one or more wrong answers crossed out, mark your best guess for the
answer on the Scantron sheet, circle it on the question sheet, and put the number of
wrong choices you’ve been able to cross out next to the question. If you’ve crossed out
three wrong answers, put a 3 next to the question; if you’ve crossed out two wrong
answers, put a 2 next to the question.
 If you don’t have a clue to eliminate any of the choices, put a zero next to the question
and don’t fill in the Scantron sheet for that question. Also, put a light mark opposite the
Scantron number of the question you’re not answering so that you don’t accidentally
put the answer to a known question in the wrong place. Putting the right answer in the
wrong row can screw up every answer that comes after it. Make sure you have com-
pletely erased all these light marks before you hand in the answers; extra marks can
make the grading machine get funky and reject your good answers.
When you’ve made it through all the questions, you should still have time to go back to the
beginning and take another look at the questions you’ve numbered. Go through all the 3s
first, because these are the questions you’re closest to being sure about. When you’re
through with the 3s, go back and do the 2s. If you have time, give a last once-over to the 1s
and zeros. Do you feel lucky?
Don’t linger on any question after you’ve marked it. Instead, pause just long enough to see
whether you want to change the answer you marked. Also, go with your first hunch unless
you actually have a reason to change. Research shows that if you can’t come up with any
additional information, your first hunch is usually the best bet.
Getting all the way to the end quickly, using the numbering tips I give you, has a time-sequence-
wrong-answer-elimination advantage. You’ll actually pick up some history just from the juxta-
position of topics on the exam. You may be able to eliminate some wrong answers from early
questions based on what you’ve noticed on questions closer to the end of the test. Also,
answering later questions helps jog your memory.

epending on your level of preparation, the Document-Based Question (DBQ, for short)
that appears on every AP U.S. History exam is either a beautiful chance for self-
expression or a wordy invitation to the Dark Side. The sad truth is that most people who
take the big test don’t do as well as they could on the DBQ because they get freaked out by
the detail.
Using the proof, analysis, and thesis (PAT) method introduced in this chapter (see the sec-
tion “Practicing the DBQ”), you can prepare for DBQs. PAT is the essay-writing system that
has what teachers look for: You use history with analysis to support a clear idea. You don’t
freak out; you laugh happily because you know how to blend the detail that the College
Board gives you on the DBQ with outside information. To score high on the DBQ, you must
create a thesis, analyze the documents as they relate to your thesis, and bring in outside 
evidence that supports your thesis.
Using Documents Like a Historian
Ever wonder what being a historian would feel like? The Document-Based Question is your
chance to write history from primary sources, just like the famous professors in their ivy-
covered towers. After bravely hacking your way through the 80 multiple-choice questions 
in Section I, you return from your all-too-short 10-minute break to face Section II, the free-
response questions.
Free response doesn’t mean you’re free to write anything you want. You’re free to write essays
about what the AP tells you; you’re not just picking among multiple choices. The DBQ essay
comes first. On the DBQ, you combine what you know about history with what you can pull
from a supplied set of documents to answer an assigned question. After you finish the DBQ,
you choose two additional regular essays from four available topics. You discover more
about the regular essays in Chapter 6.

History is what a people chooses to remember to explain who they are. The historian’s job is
to make sure what people remember is facts interpreted in as honest a manner as their cur-
rent understanding of the world allows. History doesn’t come from wizards with long white
beards; it comes from scholars working patiently with primary source material to provide
accurate facts plus reasonable analysis and interpretation. That’s what you’re going to do on
the DBQs, just like a big-time historian.
On the test, you’ll confront one interesting analysis question from an important period in U.S.
history. To help build your essay on that question, you’ll receive a set of eight to ten primary
source documents. These documents could be letters, news reports, political cartoons,
financial reports, pictures, diary entries, charts, graphs, love notes — almost anything you
can get on paper. Your essay for the DBQ needs to combine your interpretation of the sup-
plied documents with outside history facts you remember about the period and topic in
question. You’re the History Judge.
You may not feel like you’re ready to be Judge Judy for everything that ever happened in U.S.
history, but the DBQ is a good place to be as smart as you can. This is the most important
essay on the AP exam; your score on the DBQ makes up 22.5 percent of your final grade. And
remember, the AP U.S. History exam is graded on the curve. To get a 4 or a 5 as your final
grade, you don’t have to have a perfect score — just one that’s better than the scores of
most other AP test takers.
You have a chance to get ahead of the pack on the DBQ because people tend to wimp out on
this question due to lack of organization. All essays on the AP are scored on a scale from 0
for awful to 9 for the rare perfect composition. The average score on the DBQ in recent years
has been a pathetic 3 on the 9 scale. You can do better than that, and when you do, you’ll feel
your final score giving you a high five.
Knowing the Criteria for Scoring 
Big on the DBQ
The AP wants you to think, not just memorize. For that reason, the highest scores on the
DBQ go to students who have developed a clear thesis or way of understanding the era of
their assigned documents. Here are the guidelines for scoring on Section II, Question 1 (the
DBQ). Scores range from a high of 9 to a low of 0.
The 8-to-9 essay:
 Contains a well-developed thesis that may explain most of the changes within the 
DBQ era
 Supports the thesis with an effective analysis of economic and social trends
 Effectively uses a substantial number of documents
 Supports or proves the thesis with substantial (ideally, 50 percent) and relevant out-
side information
 May contain minor errors
 Is clearly organized and well written
 Scores: Only a few hundred students — about a tenth of 1 percent — get a 9. A few
thousand — still less than 1 percent — get an 8
56
Part II: Answering the Questions: Three Kinds, Three Strategies 

The 5-to-7 essay:
 Contains a thesis that explains many of the changes within the era
 Has a limited analysis of the information supporting the thesis
 Effectively uses some documents
 Supports the thesis with some outside information for proof
 May have some errors that don’t seriously get in the way of main essay points
 Shows acceptable organization and writing; language errors don’t stop understanding
 Scores: Fewer than 2 percent of test takers get a score of 7; around 4 percent get a
score of 6; and 10 percent score a 5
The 2-to-4 essay:
 Contains a limited or undeveloped thesis
 Lacks analysis and deals with questions in a simplistic way
 Just parrots back a laundry list of documents
 Contains little outside information or information that’s wrong
 May contain substantial factual errors
 Is either poorly organized or poorly written
 Scores: Unfortunately, these scores are the most common. About 18 percent of test
takers get a 4; around 30 percent get a 3 (3.16 is the average DBQ score); and 27 per-
cent get a pathetic 2
The 0-to-1 essay:
 Lacks a thesis or just restates the question
 Shows the student doesn’t really understand the question
 Shows the test taker has little understanding of the documents or just ignores them
 Contains no outside information
 Contains wrong information
 Badly written
 Scores: 7 percent of test takers get a 1; about half a percent get a 0; and another half a
percent get nothing because they apparently drifted off before they got to the DBQ
Practicing the DBQ
As you know, BBQ stands for barbecue, which is lots of fun unless you’re on the grill. Think of
the Document-Based Question, often shortened to DBQ, as being sort of a BBQ for your mind.
The DBQ is lots of fun as long as you stay away from the heat and enjoy the party. In this sec-
tion, I first give you pointers on how to set up your answer. Then I give you a sample ques-
tion based on Reconstruction in the South (see Chapter 14 for more information). Finally, I
present tips on answering the sample question and tell you how to apply the proof, analysis,
and thesis (PAT) method when writing your answer.
57
Chapter 5: Scoring Big on Document-Based Questions (DBQs)

To write a winning answer for any DBQ, you first have to understand the question.
Understanding the question is where a sadly large number of DBQers go wrong, so that’s
where you need start to go right. PAT can help in that regard, and the following steps explain
how. I suggest you consider and follow these steps to prepare yourself before writing your
answer (or even reading the question).
1. Start sweeping the cobwebs of your brain for proof, or proofreading, which is the
beginning of the PAT system.
Don’t even read the documents until you have taken a sober inventory of what you
know about the question. Don’t worry — you’ll remember more as you go. Just note on
the green question book every event and theme you can think of off the top of your
head.
2. Read the documents twice; on the second round, circle words within the documents
that you may want to refer to in your essay.
3. Do a little analysis — Step 2 in the PAT method.
What are some points you want to make about the question, and how does the informa-
tion you have support these points? Jot quick notes in the green book.
When you’re looking for space to write in the green book, don’t skip ahead to read the
other regular essays. Deal with the regular essays when you get to them; you have no
reason to get distracted now. I tell you all about writing the regular essays in Chapter 6.
4. At thesis time — the final step and solid foundation in the PAT approach — you
argue your thesis with analysis, using one major point in each body paragraph.
State your thesis in the first paragraph and restate it (with proof) in the last paragraph.
Take a stand! It doesn’t matter whether you’re wrong; historians love to argue. A clear
thesis stops a bored reader dead in her tracks and makes her pay attention to your
analysis and proof. Your thesis provides a philosophy or road map for everything in
your essay. In the Reconstruction example shown in the next section, the thesis could
be “the South’s resistance was too strong for Reconstruction to work” or “the North
succeeded in changing a primitive slave society in the South into the beginnings of a
modern, if racist, culture.”
The benefit of structuring your DBQ argument under the PAT system is that you don’t have
to be right to win; you are the judge of history. The fact that you can corral evidence and use
proof and analysis to support a clear thesis makes you a contender for a high score. And you
don’t have to be very high to get above the average score of 3; just keep citing proof. A good
paper successfully uses three pieces of proof in each body paragraph, taken from a mix of
outside information and document analysis. Most DBQs are presented in chronological order.
Because you’ll arrange your essay by analysis points, you probably won’t cite the documents
in letter order, and your essay won’t look like a laundry list. Just remember to use every doc-
ument that fits into your analysis; it’s even okay if you don’t use them all.
Defend your point, but don’t get too creative. Remember, your brave reader may be getting a
little blurry from reading hundreds of versions of the same essay that you’re writing. Don’t
confuse him. State your thesis clearly and simply. Cite lots of documents (with document let-
ters bracketed) and underline your outside evidence. Stick to one major thesis; don’t try to
snow the reader with a bunch of mini-concepts. Your test scorer is looking for analysis and
proof, and he doesn’t have much time to find it. Don’t just rewrite the textbook; make sure
the facts you use prove your analysis and thesis points.
See “Answering the Reconstruction DBQ” later in this chapter to see how to apply PAT to the
following Reconstruction sample question.

Sample Document-Based Question: 
The Reconstruction
Here’s a DBQ like the one that a third of a million students like you will be answering on the
upcoming AP U.S. History exam. As you read it, remember that you have 15 minutes to read
the material and 45 minutes to write your answer on the real test. The documents are origi-
nal source material, so they contain some misspelling and bad grammar — hey, that’s the
way people talked back then.
Directions: The following question requires you to construct a coherent essay that integrates
your interpretation of Documents A through F and your knowledge of the period referred to
in the question. Only essays that both cite key pieces of evidence from the documents and
draw on outside knowledge of the period will earn high scores.
1. Discuss the experience of Reconstruction in the South following the Civil War. What
factors influenced the lives of the people affected by Reconstruction in both the South
and the North? How did Reconstruction change over time, and what motivated these
changes?

every ten days, thee have nothing to eat. at the same time our ration’s are stolen from the
ration house by Mr Streeter the Asst Supt at the Island (and others) and sold while our

and allows it to be sold, and our family’s suffer for something to eat.

It is plain that the authority here given to the military officer amounts to absolute despotism.

Chapter 5: Scoring Big on Document-Based Questions (DBQs)

Such a power has not been wielded by any monarch in England for more than five hundred
years. In all that time no people who speak the English language have borne such servitude.
It reduces the whole population of the ten States — all persons, of every color, sex, and 
condition, and every stranger within their limits — to the most abject and degrading slavery.
No master ever had a control so absolute over the slaves as this bill gives to the military offi-
cers over both white and colored persons.

I would not in this judgment depart from that moderation which belongs to the occasion; 
but God forbid that, when called to deal with so great an offender, I should affect a coldness
which I cannot feel. Slavery has been our worst enemy, assailing all, murdering our children,
filling our homes with mourning, and darkening the land with tragedy; and now it rears its
crest anew, with Andrew Johnson as its representative. Through him it assumes once more
to rule the Republic and to impose its cruel law. The enormity of his conduct is aggravated
by his bare faced treachery. He once declared himself the Moses of the colored race. Behold
him now the Pharaoh. With such treachery in such a cause there can be no parley. Every sen-
timent, every conviction, every vow against slavery must now be directed against him.
Pharaoh is at the bar of the Senate for judgment.

The country having just emerged from a great rebellion, many questions will come before it
for settlement in the next four years which preceding Administrations have never had to deal
with. In meeting these it is desirable that they should be approached calmly, without preju-
dice, hate, or sectional pride, remembering that the greatest good to the greatest number is
the object to be attained.
This requires security of person, property, and free religious and political opinion in every
part of our common country, without regard to local prejudice. All laws to secure these ends
will receive my best efforts for their enforcement.

The evidence in hand and accessible will show beyond peradventure that in many parts of
the State corrupt and violent influences were brought to bear upon the registrars of voters,
thus materially affecting the character of the voting or poll lists; upon the inspectors of elec-
tion, prejudicially and unfairly thereby changing the number of votes cast; and, finally,
threats and violence were practiced directly upon the masses of voters in such measures and
strength as to produce grave apprehensions for their personal safety and as to deter them
from the exercise of their political franchises.
It will not accord with the laws of nature or history to brand colored people a race of cow-

Source: Nat Crippens, black historian after Reconstruction, 1880-1965
Until the civil rights movement overturned systematic segregation, thousands of African
Americans and other minorities were brutally maimed or killed by white vigilantes taking the
law into their hands. Established law, which codified white supremacy, failed to protect the
civil rights of black citizens. In the end, white segregation rested on open violence.
At the turn of the century, lynchings occurred every week, and most of the victims, denied
the due process of courts, were innocent of the charges held against them. Some were not
even accused of having committed a crime.
Answering the Reconstruction DBQ
The secret to successful DBQ essays is using both the documents presented and relevant
outside information from the period covered by the documents. To do this successfully, you
need to have a plan. That plan includes the PAT method for scoring high on essay questions
(see the next section).
First, the proof. The green question book that contains your essay challenges and documents
is also the place for you to make notes during the AP exam. Use the pink essay-writing book-
let only for your essays; make notes in the green question book.
Read the DBQ question twice. The second time through, carefully circle the key words in the
assignment:
1. Discuss the experience of Reconstruction in the South following the Civil War. What
factors influenced the lives of the people affected by Reconstruction in both the South
and the North? How did Reconstruction change over time, and what motivated these
changes?
Before you even read the documents, make notes in the green question book about themes
and events you remember from this period. You’re going to use these happenings as proof to
support the thesis that forms the backbone of your DBQ essay. You’re wise to record your
outside history knowledge before the documents distract you from what you already know.
Now read the documents. Circle the most important points in each primary source. You’ll
weave references to these documents throughout your essay. Your writing, however, is not a
shopping-list description of the documents. For maximum impact, base your essay on a
thesis, analyzed in at least three main points and defended with proof from your outside his-
tory knowledge and the documents.
Using PAT for a good DBQ
Sailing along under the PAT method (discussed earlier in this chapter), you first marshaled
your proof in the form of PES (political events plus economic and social trends; see Chapter 1).
So you just do the PAT with the PES. (You’re probably sick of acronyms!)
61
Chapter 5: Scoring Big on Document-Based Questions (DBQs)

After you have your outside history knowledge written down and your document proof cir-
cled in the green book, you’re ready to proceed to an analysis of the question; this pro-
duces your thesis. Read the question one last time, paying careful attention to the words you
circled.
For the Reconstruction question, your thesis may be
The North’s initially tough Reconstruction rules provided some protection for blacks 
in the South but caused a violent reaction from white Southerners threatened by
change. Northerners with their own political agendas were unwilling to maintain strict
Reconstruction. In 1877, 12 years after the end of the Civil War, the last Northern troops
were withdrawn from the South, leaving Southern blacks free but segregated, with little
political or economic opportunity.
This thesis becomes the first paragraph of your five- or six-paragraph DBQ essay. The second
paragraph could talk about the angry retribution with which the North applied
Reconstruction immediately after the Civil War. It could show that the North came within one
vote of impeaching its own Union President after Andrew Johnson opposed tough measures
by the Radical Republicans.
You should cite documents clearly in brackets, like this:
After the war, even black Union soldiers who had fought bravely were treated badly in
the South by their own officers [Document A].
Bracket all references to documents, but don’t waste time copying the titles of the docu-
ments. The reader who grades your essay is an expert on this specific DBQ question; she has
seen thousands of essays on this year’s DBQ, and she knows the document letters by heart.
(See the nearby sidebar “Grading the AP U.S. History exam.”)
62
Part II: Answering the Questions: Three Kinds, Three Strategies 
How to be a brain-fight referee
Historians like to argue about events and trends that are
old enough to have developed some proof. Can’t decide
who should win the next election? That’s nothing to a
historian; we’re still arguing about the causes of World
War I. You need to remember two things about the
person who grades your DBQ:
1. She’ll be overwhelmed by piles of tests.
2. She’ll be a historian.
When historians don’t agree about causes (which is
usually), they love to argue about trends and documents.
For extra credit with your historian–grader, join in the
brain fight by defining your terms clearly.
Another good trick is admitting that the other side may
have a point counter to your thesis and then destroying
that point with analysis. This method is the straw-man
argument. Don’t think that you need to neglect docu-
ments that seem to run counter to your thesis. You can
deal with seemingly contrary proof through analysis and
gain extra historian street cred. If your grader slows
down long enough to notice, a historian is always happy
when you analyze the documents by date, author, and
any indication of how the author’s date and bias fit into
an ongoing cultural trend.
Don’t reach for facts you’re unsure of. When a teacher
is grading lots of papers fast, he’ll naturally glory in find-
ing a fact that’s completely wrong. Unfortunately for the
test taker, teachers celebrate finding a giant error by
clamping on a major decrease in score. If you’re not sure
of a name or year, use a generality such as the president
or around this time. Never quote directly from a docu-
ment; summarize.
Historians have bad memories too. In gatherings of old
historians, you’ll typically hear someone say, “You know
that guy — the father of our country . . .” The other his-
torians don’t even try to remember the name. They just
say, “Oh, yeah. That guy.”

Don’t analyze the documents like a laundry list. Weave your document evidence throughout
your essay on Reconstruction as proof of your thesis. Some documents require explanation
to show that you understand them. You’re trying to show that you can analyze an era by
using primary source documents, not just proving that you can read by spouting back what
the documents say. You need to do more than just quote the documents to get a good score
on the DBQ.
Bringing in outside proof
For this Reconstruction DBQ, you want to mention as outside proof the Thirteenth,
Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution, which ended slavery and gave
equal protection of the law and the vote to all males. In economics, Reconstruction saw the
end of the Southern plantation economy and the beginning of sharecropping. The North’s
industrial base continued to grow, and its own economy drew Northern attention away from
trouble in the South. The Civil Rights Bill of 1866 didn’t actually overturn Black Code laws in
the South; the Supreme Court limited the application of this early civil-rights legislation to
only national laws. Southern states later adopted Jim Crow laws to further limit the rights of
blacks.
Here’s more outside information: Under early Reconstruction rules, former slaves — but not
Confederate leaders — could vote in Southern state elections. Southern blacks helped pass
important social legislation, including the establishment of public schools for all citizens.
After the Southern states officially rejoined Union, local white officials made their own laws
and quickly found ways to keep blacks from voting. President Hayes agreed to withdraw all
troops from the South in 1877 as part of a deal to win a disputed election. The Ku Klux Klan
and other groups orchestrated repressive violence against blacks in the South. In reaction to
what it viewed as harsh Reconstruction pushed by Republicans, the Solid South voted
Democratic for 80 years until after World War II.

Chapter 5: Scoring Big on Document-Based Questions (DBQs)
Grading the AP U.S. History exam
During one week in June of each year, more than 1,000
determined history teachers and professors gather at a
college, usually in Texas, to grade 1 million AP U.S.
History essays. About one-third of a million students take
this test — the largest single-subject College Board (CB)
test in the world. Each student who doesn’t pass out
from the strain writes three essays, and all of these 1 mil-
lion essays must be graded by hand.
If the teachers grade 1,000 essays each and spend 2
minutes reading and scoring each essay, the job will
take them 33 hours of solid work. With training, consul-
tation, and occasional trips to the buffet, that’s a very full
week. Some of the most experienced graders arrive
early to serve as coordinators. These super-specialists
develop specific criteria for each of the five exam ques-
tions. Coordinators and regular graders specialize in
only one question; they learn the grading criteria for their
question and stick to it.
The upside to this specialization is that each of your
essays will be read by a different, custom-trained person
who is guaranteed not to be mad at you for something
your big brother did two years ago. The downside is that
if you’re blowing smoke, your grader has seen it all a
hundred times before. Leaders double-check a random
sample of each grader’s work to keep the grading con-
sistent and fair.
Even as hard as they try, graders can make mistakes. If
you’re sure you’ve been given a much lower score than
you deserve, you can pay the CB a few bucks to have an
independent reader rescore your test. Strangely, no one
has yet complained about getting too high a score.
Even machines can make mistakes. The CB recently paid
millions of dollars in damages after a scanning machine
gave A students F scores because the answer sheets
had gotten wet. But in general, the CB deserves high
fives for hanging in there with a heavy load. If you’ve
ever tried to grade even a small pile of hand-written
essays, try to imagine what grading 1,000 would be like.
That’s why you bracket your document citations and
underline important information. Help the grader see
your strong points!

The length of a DBQ response should be five or six paragraphs. The first paragraph states
the thesis; the last paragraph reiterates thesis and proof. The middle paragraphs provide
point-by-point analysis, supported by document citations and outside information. Underline
the names of all outside information and dates, like this: Solid South, Civil Rights Bill of 1866,
Jim Crow. This method helps make sure that test graders clearly see the outside information
you’re submitting. Test readers score so many essays so quickly that they have only a
minute to see information you’ve spent months absorbing.

 Handling two questions per hour
 Managing PAT for a high score
I
magine that the end of the AP U.S. History exam is in sight, and you have a little more
than 1 hour to write answers to two regular essay questions. An hour doesn’t seem like
much time, does it? Now you have some choices; you get to pick one of the two questions in
Part B, and then one of the two questions in Part C. This chapter gives you some tips on
how to select and write your essay answers for a winning score.
Nailing Down Your Timing
Now that you’ve finished your insightful discussion of the Document-Based Question (DBQ —
see Chapter 5), you get to spend the last golden hour of your test time writing two regular
essays. These regular essays are officially known as Section II, Part B and Part C of the test.
They’re “regular” only compared with the DBQ; in these last two essays, you don’t have any
documents to worry about (or lean on). You do have thought-provoking history puzzles that
require a combination of analysis and appropriate facts.
The time at which you get started on these last two essays is suggested on the test, but it’s
not mandatory. After the 15-minute required reading time that begins your Section II quest,
you have a grand total of 1 hour and 55 minutes to write the DBQ and the Part B and Part C
essays. The test proctor will pop up like a human alarm clock to remind you when the recom-
mended time to move on to the next section has arrived. After the 45 minutes recommended
for writing the DBQ, your test boss will say, “You should now move on to Part B.” You want to
follow the advice of Mother AP and switch questions around the time she tells you to.
Although the DBQ section has the most credit (22.5 percent of the total test) and the most
writing time assigned to it (45 minutes), Parts B and C are definitely worth the effort. Each of
these regular essays represents almost 14 percent of the exam — a total of 27.5 percent for
both.
You have a recommended 70 minutes to devote to both regular essays. The College Board
suggests you spend 5 minutes planning and 30 minutes writing each one. As on the DBQ, you
have a chance to pick up some ground against a slow field on these essay questions. The AP
U.S. History exam is graded on a curve. To win a 4 or 5 as your final grade, your score doesn’t
have to be perfect — just better than that of most other AP test takers.

The average student performance on the regular essay questions is even slightly worse than
the bad scores on the DBQ, because people are running out of gas by the time they get to
them. When you get there, though, remember that you’re almost to the finish line; you just
need one last burst of speed to take advantage of the situation. Remember that essays on the
AP are scored on a scale from 0 (for no intelligence detected) to 9 (for Shakespeare reborn).
The average score on the regular essay questions in recent years has been less than 3 on 
the 9 scale. You can do better than that even if you’re a little spotty on a few facts. As the
saying goes, in the land of the blind, the one-eyed person rules.
No rule says you have to work exactly 35 minutes on each of the essays in Part B and Part C.
Just don’t move too much time from one part to the other; both parts are worth the same
number of points, and a great score on one won’t make up for a 0 on the other.
Meeting and Beating the Questions
When the College Board says “regular essay,” it doesn’t mean easy topics like “What I Did on
My Summer Vacation.” The AP is, after all, a college test you take before you’ve had any col-
lege classes. The test geniuses have had all year to come up with four challenging and mean-
ingful essay questions. Teachers even have a special language: essay questions are prompts.
You’ll find two of these prompts lurking in Part B; you get to pick the one that terrifies you
less. Part C holds two more questions; go with the one that’s slightly less awful. Getting the
best score on these essays takes a combination of knowledge and reasoning. If you want to
know how common that skill combination is in the AP U.S. History test-taking population,
just look at the average score: 2.86 on a scale of 9. Don’t worry; you have a plan.
You don’t have to answer the two regular essay questions in order. The specialist essay read-
ers will find the essay they grade by its number in your pink answer book. You can read all
four essays and pick the one that seems easiest for you so you can get a running start. Just
remember to do one essay from Part B and one from Part C. To leave time for both, it’s best
to switch within a few minutes of the 35-minute advisory you get from the test proctor. Even
better, bring a watch and keep your own time.
Writing like a professor
You know that your essay will be graded by a slightly bleary-eyed history teacher. One thing
that professors insist on in their professional journals is that writers define their terms. If
your essay question asks for the impact of changes on the common man, offer a brief defini-
tion of that term. If you’re writing about the Progressive movement, use a sentence in the
first paragraph to say what that term means. You should signal your high-level understand-
ing of academic protocol by using this well-loved professional prelude: “It is important to
define terms. By the Progressive movement, I mean newly organized initiatives in the early
1900s that had a goal of efficiency and fairness in U.S. society, economy, and government.”
Defining a term takes only a sentence and could make a professor very happy.
If you’re asked to assess the validity of a statement, you’ve just been given a nonvoluntary
invitation to jump into the middle of an argument. You may see something like this: “Assess
the validity of this statement: The New Deal brought an end to the Great Depression.” Gosh,
what do you think? Take a position, and make it your thesis statement. Here are two example
theses:
66
Part II: Answering the Questions: Three Kinds, Three Strategies 

 “Although economic problems remained that were not settled until after the U.S. entry
into World War II, New Deal programs were effective in blunting the worst problems of
the Great Depression.”
 “Although New Deal programs created a public perception of progress, they were
largely ineffective in dealing with the economic roots of the Great Depression.”
Notice, AP seekers, that both thesis statements begin with the magic word although. The use
of this gentle, reasonable word signals that you’re being bend-over-backward fair in your
thesis position by acknowledging from the start the limits of your argument. Professors know
that modest arguments provide a safety shield from academic attack. Later in each thesis
statement, you can use more weasel words to make the thesis argument easier to defend.
The first example says “effective in blunting the worst problems.” That way, you have to
defend only blunting (not actually solving) and worst (but not all problems). In the second
version, the thesis reads “largely ineffective in dealing with the economic roots,” so that the
essay can admit that the New Deal was effective sometimes on the little issues but not the
answer for solving problems at the economic roots. Then the two opposed writers can go on
to gleefully define worst problems or economic roots in a way that makes their thesis argu-
ments seem like the gospel truth.
PATting your PES dispenser
Writing regular essays that teachers love is as easy as applying the proof, analysis, and thesis
(PAT) approach in writing (see Chapter 5) to the political, economic, and social trends (PES)
that score points with test graders (see Chapter 1). With the PAT formula, you select everything
you know about the topic as proof, and then analyze that proof to support your own theory
about the question. The proof you use includes all the political, economic, and social trends
you can find in the PES dispenser of your brain. In the DBQ (Chapter 5), the documents them-
selves supply some of the PES points; with regular essays, it’s just you and your fine mind.
The regular essay questions are an AP dance party of political, economic, and social (PES)
trends. Here are some examples of what to prepare for:
 You need to combine developments in different areas, such as the political outcomes 
of social issues. An example could be changes in the U.S. government brought on by
urbanization.
 You also have to analyze common themes that run through an extended period —how
women’s rights changed society from 1830 to 1930, for example.
 You may need to write about the economic experiences of different ethnic, gender,
racial, or socioeconomic groups during a certain period of American history. An exam-
ple could be the impact of the Great Depression of the 1930s on women, men, and
minority groups in the United States.
On the regular essay questions, the grader judges you on the thesis you develop, the quality
of your analysis supported, and the historic proof you support it with. When you’re figuring
out your essay, you’ll probably plan what you’re going to write in PAT order:
1. List all the political, economic and social facts you can remember about the essay
topic (proof).
2. Figure out how these facts can go together to explain the essay topic (analysis).
3. Make up an opinion to tie the facts together with the essay topic (thesis).
67
Chapter 6: Creating Essays Teachers Love

Make sure your answer has at least a vague relationship to the question. It doesn’t have to be
perfect; you want to show off any knowledge you have in the general area. Just don’t try writ-
ing about 1800s shipping if the question is about the Mayflower. When you actually write the
essay, PAT turns into TAP: First you state your thesis and then provide analysis supported by
proof.
The official AP line is that your supported argument is more important than the amount of
factual information you produce. In other words: essay-padders beware. You can’t just write
down a laundry list of names, trends, and events; you have to show how they fit together.
This idea is a great humanistic and holistic one. In the rest of this chapter, you see how it
works in practice.
Knowing the Criteria for Scoring 
Big on the Essay Questions
In this section, I provide you with a list of grading criteria for an essay question. The list may
look a bit daunting, but don’t worry, because you can ensure you meet the criteria for the
highest score by following the tips in this chapter. By recognizing that the AP values political,
economic, and social connections even more than reciting historic facts, you can make your
essays on any topic show how trends interact. Your essays should stay positive; you catch
more bees with honey than with vinegar. Slavery and the Trail of Tears, for example, are blots
on the U.S. record of freedom (see Chapter 11), but they’re also parts of trends that need to
be viewed within the context of their times. Save political speeches for political meetings;
when you’re taking a test with your grade hanging in the balance, emphasize unity and
progress.
By starting and concluding with a clear thesis, you help your overworked, weary grader find
what he’s looking for: a sense of style and meaning. Make sure the hurried test grader sees
the proof you’re using by underlining it in your essay; by highlighting facts about trends and
topics and dealing with them in paragraphs separated into political, economic, and social
themes that all connect to your thesis, you provide an essay that clearly deserves a good
score. These essays follow the same grading scale as the DBQ, with a high score of 9 and a
low score of 0.
The 8-to-9 essay:
 Contains a clear, well-developed thesis that deals with the question at hand
 Supports the thesis with a large amount of relevant information
 Analyzes the main categories completely (somewhat uneven treatment of the cate-
gories is okay)
 May contain minor errors
The 5-to-7 essay:
 Contains a thesis that deals with the question only partially
 Supports the thesis with a medium amount of on-point information
 Analyzes all categories at least somewhat; treatment of categories may be very uneven
 May contain errors that don’t detract completely from the essay
68
Part II: Answering the Questions: Three Kinds, Three Strategies 

The 2-to-4 essay:
 Restates the question without providing a clear thesis
 Provides either minimal facts or minimal application of the facts
 Doesn’t analyze all the categories, maybe gets one or two in a general way
 Contains lots of errors
The 0-to-1 essay:
 Omits a thesis
 Doesn’t make sense
 Displays little or no understanding of the question
 Contains major false statements
Converting Questions to PAT Answers
AP U.S. History essay-grading week is a busy time for the College Board. More than 1,000
teachers grade around 1 million essays in the course of a few days, sitting around tables with
only one 20-minute break in the morning and afternoon. Talk about hard work and dedica-
tion! The average reader could be covering as many as 1,000 essays, with only around 2 min-
utes to read each contribution.
The graders look quickly for proof and analysis supporting an overall thesis (PAT). Grading
leaders develop clear criteria that the graders use for each essay, and each grader spends
the whole time scoring only essays covering one question again and again.
The College Board makes grading 1 million essays as fair as it can, but in the rush, no one has
time to ponder garbled proof, vague analysis, or a thesis that’s not clearly stated. For that
reason, you want to make your PAT answers simple and direct.
Some football teams use a five-yards-and-glory strategy. They’re not looking to score a touch-
down on every play; they just want to gain five yards on each down with short passes and
runs because if they keep doing that, they’ll move on down the field and eventually score. 
AP U.S. History essays are like that. You write approximately five paragraphs with a goal of
showing that you know and can analyze historic information. You’re not trying to list every-
thing that went on during the era you’re writing about. You’ll score higher on the AP if you
organize and analyze your information.
Here are some tips to make sure your essay dodges the test potholes and cruises smoothly
down the AP highway to a good score.
 Make sure you address all the parts of the free-response essay questions. Missing a
subtopic can affect your grade. Get all three PES parts: political, economic, and social.
 If you can’t remember a name or date, don’t guess. A wrong specific is worse than a
possibly incorrect general. If you can’t remember Seneca Falls in 1848, for example, say
“an important women’s-rights meeting before the Civil War.” Don’t let your grader see a
clear error that she can use to slap you down.
 Don’t freak out if the essay questions look hard. If the questions are tough for you,
they’re tough for everyone. The test is scored on a curve, so grading is survival of the
69
Chapter 6: Creating Essays Teachers Love

fittest. You could even get lucky. If you did well on the multiple-choice part of the exam
and score very low on an essay, the grading coordinator may automatically ask that
your essay be reread to make sure you’re not being underscored. You could have two
chances to make an impression.
 Don’t get all anxious and start to write before you really understand the question. You
may be missing the main point of the prompt while you’re rattling off random facts.
Carpenters have a saying: “Measure twice, cut once.” You won’t have a chance for a
second cut at your essay, so read the question prompt twice.
 Circle the key words.
 Make notes in the green question book before you write.
 The College Board doesn’t want to see a hip-hop version of history, fun as writing that
may be. Stick to what your English teacher taught you: The first paragraph is the intro-
duction and includes your thesis statement. Each of the body paragraphs has a differ-
ent theme that supports the thesis. A good goal is to have three proof facts in each of
the body paragraphs.
 Sometimes, the prompt decides the themes for you. If a question asks how post–Civil
War government policies affected American Indians, Western settlement, and economic
development, for example, the middle paragraphs of your essay need to deal one-by-
one with American Indians, settlement, and development.
If no clear division is obvious from the prompt, you’re always safe if you have a para-
graph on each of your PES friends: political events, economic conditions, and social
trends.
 The final paragraph of your essay restates the thesis in slightly different words and
provides a summary that mentions the themes of the middle paragraphs.
 Don’t let your essay wander around the subject like some drunk in a bar. Check back
during the writing of each paragraph to make sure what you’re saying supports the
thesis in the introduction.
 Don’t introduce historic facts just to prove you know something. Tie each trend or
event to the theme of your essay. You shouldn’t have to exclude too many random
facts; you can usually find a way to use creative logic to tie almost any trend or event
to the theme you’re supporting.
 Keep PATting your essay. Make sure you tie your proof together with analysis to sup-
port your thesis. You get no penalty for having a wrong thesis, but you sink fast if you
don’t use proof and analysis to support your theme.
Analyzing an essay question
Test day marches on. You’ve been multiply chosen and DBQed half to death, and now it’s
time for a final burst of essay brilliance. Here’s what you may face in Part B:
Directions: Choose ONE question from this part. You are advised to spend 5 minutes plan-
ning and 30 minutes writing your answer. Cite relevant historical evidence in support of your
generalizations, and present your arguments clearly and logically.
1. How did the New Deal (1932–1944) change U.S. society? Consider TWO of the following
factors in your response:
Social movements, economic development, political change
2. The period from 1824 to 1848 is often called the era of Jacksonian democracy. What
social and political changes characterized this era?
70
Part II: Answering the Questions: Three Kinds, Three Strategies 

For the sake of this example, assume that you choose Question 2, because you think you can
recall more about this era and have a thesis point you want to make. Check out Chapter 11 to
familiarize yourself with the important things to know from this era.
First, read the prompt twice. Circle the terms that are key parts of the prompt.
2. The period from 1824 to 1848 is often called the era of Jacksonian democracy. What
social and political changes characterized this era?
Make a list of what you know about this era. You could list many other PES topics, but the fol-
lowing points would more than get you started:
 Election of 1824 (the Corrupt Bargain)
 Andrew Jackson elected in 1828 and 1832
 Trail of Tears
 Nullification
 Spoils system
 Increased voter turnout
 1848 women’s rights meeting at Seneca Falls
 Universal male suffrage
 Defeat of the Bank of the U.S.
 The spoils system
Now that you have your PES, you’re ready to apply the PAT formula. The PES list you have
made forms most of the proof. Your analysis supports your thesis.
Settling on your thesis
Now you need a thesis. You’re the historian now. You know what you’ve been taught, but
what do you believe about Jacksonian democracy? Pretend you’re some kind of authority.
Relax. Forming a thesis isn’t something you can get wrong. Historians love to argue, and one
of the topics they argue about is the era of Andrew Jackson. History changes: Andy Jackson
has gone from American hero to dangerous redneck to rough but effective champion of the
common man. The only thing you can do wrong on an AP essay question is fail to have a
clear thesis.
A thesis — your point of view — unifies your essay and makes it worthy of a higher score.
Just think about your grading audience as one tired teacher who has endured hundreds of
unfocused fluff-a-thons loosely connected to the Jackson era. Give him something clear and
decisive, and he’ll thank you with a better grade.
For most history questions, you can go in either of two broad directions with a thesis: main-
stream history or counterculture. In the case of the Jackson era, you can argue for a main-
stream view
The 1820s to 1840s was a time when the United States began to move toward being true
to its democratic ideals.
71
Chapter 6: Creating Essays Teachers Love

Or you could go with a counterculture approach and say
From the 1820s through the 1840s, the United States made some surface changes toward
greater representation for the common man, but these changes were largely symbolic.
The real economic and social conditions of slavery and sectionalism changed little
during this period.
As much as you may hate to agree with the Man, you should go with the mainstream view on
this one. The Jackson era really did involve a move toward democratic ideals.
Planning the essay
Now you’re ready to plan the essay. You want to have a five-paragraph essay, structured as
follows:
 The thesis anchors the first paragraph.
 The three body paragraphs support your central point (ideally with three pieces of
analysis each).
 The final paragraph reiterates and amplifies the thesis.
Look for the subjects of the three body paragraphs. Sifting through the PES topics in your
notes, you see that they can be arranged in political, economic, and social categories. Political
events include elections, increased voter turnout, universal white-male suffrage, and the
spoils system. Economic trends include nullification and the defeat of the Bank of the U.S.
Social happenings include the Trail of Tears, the Second Great Awakening, and women’s
rights.
Writing the essay
Okay, your five minutes of planning are up, and you’re ready to write the essay. Keep the PES
terms that form the proof for your thesis in capital letters to make them easier for the grader
to see when she’s reading quickly. Let the English teachers complain; this exam is about his-
tory, and you’re in a high-traffic situation. Capitalizing provides a road marker to help direct
your reader to the destination.
In another high-traffic detour from the refined world of English composition, you’re going to
start your essay with the thesis sentence, not keep it waiting demurely for the end of the first
paragraph. Also, you’re going to label it Thesis. That way, it’s difficult to miss. The thesis
doesn’t repeat the question; believe me, after reading hundreds of essays, the grading
teacher knows what the question is. Your thesis restates the prompt in your own words to
show that you understand it.
Consider beginning your thesis with the magic word although. In Chapter 5, you see how to
admit that the other side may have a point counter to your thesis. This argument makes 
you look fair and allows you to counter possible objections to your argument on your own
terms. In full debate, developing your opponent’s argument and then destroying it is called
the straw-man argument. The use of the word although is a quickie version of the straw-man
move.
Give your essay a title. A title doesn’t cost anything and makes the essay look official.
72
Part II: Answering the Questions: Three Kinds, Three Strategies 

Checking out a sample essay
Here’s a sample essay that contains a clear thesis, reasonable analysis, and enough historical
proof to ring the test grader’s bell.
Democracy Comes to the United States in the Jackson Era
Thesis: Although important issues like slavery and states’ rights remained unresolved,
the period from the 1820s to the 1840s, known as the Jackson era, was a time when the
United States began to move toward being true to its democratic ideals. This era saw 
the increase in the power of ordinary people in political, economic and social areas.
These power changes were brought home to people through Religious and Moral
Reform movements and through Political Campaigns that were conducted on a large
public scale for the first time. Citizens began to see themselves as having real freedom
to change their own lives and the course of the nation in which they lived.
The most important political event was the introduction of white Universal Male
Suffrage in most states in the early 1820s. Although it was a far cry from the voting
rights we enjoy now, it was an unimagined freedom in earlier days, when voting was lim-
ited by property and class. The newly enfranchised citizens responded by increasing
Voter Turnout by large numbers. People began to see themselves as more powerful, not
just as the pawns of destiny. Greater democracy spelled the end of leaders selected by
small elites and the beginning of the election of popular national leaders like Andrew
Jackson in 1848 and 1832. Even the Spoils System can be seen as a democratization of
public employment.
The Second Great Awakening increased social as well as spiritual growth by getting
people together away from the farm in newly organized religious congregations. These
congregations in turn provided a religious base for small but growing Temperance,
Abolitionist, and Women’s Suffrage movements. The era ended with a symbolically
important women’s meeting at Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848. Even an event that we
now view as negative, such as the Trail of Tears removal of American Indians from the
South, had its beginning in increased public social pressure for land.
Economics are never far from any social or political change. The birth of the Industrial
Revolution with factory jobs offered urban alternatives to rural isolation. Rapidly
improving transportation by Canal, Railroad, and Steamship made the sale of crops and
manufactured goods into the beginning of a National Economy. Transportation allowed
ordinary people to move where they wanted to go to seek a new fortune. Even the
Nullification Crisis, with its argument about tariffs, was a sign of the economic strain on
sectionalism brought by an increasingly powerful National Interest.
When Thomas Jefferson wrote “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness,” most of his
upper-class congressional colleagues could recognize the theory of freedom only as it
applied to them and people of their class. Most common people could not vote and had
no time for economic and social betterment. That’s why the Founding Fathers created
the Electoral College and chose senators and presidents in private meetings. But with
the new nation, the theory of freedom had become an ideal. As reform improved the
power of ordinary people, those people were more likely to use their power to improve
social, political, and economic life. The era of Jacksonian Democracy, with its emphasis
on personal beliefs and more universal suffrage, brought the idea of freedom that had
begun in the American Revolution to reality: the beginnings of real democracy in the
United States.

Chapter 6: Creating Essays Teachers Love

Wrapping up the essay plan
Use simple, short sentences. Your audience of one grader has seen a lot of convoluted essays
and is probably already verging on cranky. Make it easy for her to follow your theme.
Throw in a big history term, if you know one. Here are some themes beloved to teachers:
expansionism; utopia; ratification; peculiar institution (slavery); oligarchy; nativism; mercan-
tilism; jingoism; imperialism; egalitarian; capitalism; and the all-time American favorite,
Manifest Destiny. Don’t try to force in terms you don’t understand; you’ll get caught.
Take the time to write clearly and neatly. Graders hate chicken-scratch writing and love clear
printing. Your grader will probably be right on the edge of surly by the time she gets to your
essay. Make it easy for her. Write the whole sentence in your mind before you put it down on
paper. If you absolutely have to cross something out, do it neatly. Try not to cross out at all.

Steer clear of funny history answers
Apparently, some people studied even less for their his-
tory exams than your slacker friends. Here are some
essay responses gone terribly wrong:
It was an age of great inventions and discoveries.
Gutenberg invented removable type and the Bible.
Another important invention was the circulation of blood.
Sir Walter Raleigh is a historical figure because he
invented cigarettes and started smoking. And Sir Francis
Drake circumcised the world with a 100 foot clipper.
Later, the Pilgrims crossed the ocean, and this was
called Pilgrim’s Progress. The winter of 1620 was a hard
one for the settlers. Many people died and many babies
were born. Captain John Smith was responsible for all
this.
One of the causes of the Revolutionary War was the
English put tacks in their tea. Also, the colonists would
send their parcels through the post without stamps.
Finally the colonists won the War and no longer had to
pay for taxis. Delegates from the original 13 states
formed the Contented Congress. Thomas Jefferson, a
Virgin, and Benjamin Franklin were two singers of the
Declaration of Independence. Franklin discovered elec-
tricity by rubbing two cats backwards and declared, 
“A horse divided against itself cannot stand.” Franklin
died in 1790 and is still dead.
Soon the Constitution of the United States was adopted
to secure domestic hostility. Under the constitution the
people enjoyed the right to keep bare arms.
Abraham Lincoln became America’s greatest Precedent.
His mother died in infancy, and he was born in a log
cabin which he built with his own hands. Abraham
Lincoln freed the slaves by signing the Emasculation
Proclamation.
The nineteenth century was a time of a great many
thoughts and inventions. People stopped reproducing by
hand and started reproducing by machine. The inven-
tion of the steamboat caused a network of rivers to
spring up.
World War I broke out around 1912–1914. Germany was
on one side of France and Russia was on the other. At
war people get killed, and then they aren’t people any
more, but friends. Peace was proclaimed at Versigh,
which was attended by George Loid, Primal Minister of
England. President Wilson arrived with 14 pointers.

Smooth out the flow of your writing by using transition phrases such as “in addition,” “fur-
thermore,” “also,” and “in another example.” When you’re changing directions, use “how-
ever,” “yet,” and the magic word “although.”
Number your points, as in this example: “First, the New Deal never claimed to solve all the
problems. Second, the Great Depression was caused by world as well as national problems.
Third, even the best programs often took time to work.” Numbering lists of arguments makes
it look like you have a plan.
Use examples to back up your idea. Nothing gets wooly faster than academic papers that are
all about concepts without real-life examples. You start with this: “Third, even the best pro-
grams often took time to work.” Then you add this: “Two examples of programs that had
delayed effects were the WPA and CCC. In these programs, government-supported jobs even-
tually helped lift the economic fortunes of certain communities, but these examples took
time to work.”
Make sure your last paragraph directly addresses the question. This paragraph is the
applause section, when you set yourself up for your well-earned reward of a high essay
score. Bring the essay back home by answering the original question clearly as you restate
your thesis.
Yay! Hurrah! You’re ready with a good battle plan for the AP U.S. History exam.

f the exam questions were in the form of a car you 
were going to drive on Test Day, history would be the
gasoline you put in the tank. Fortunately for your memory,
U.S. History is a very cool story starring Thomas
Jefferson, George Washington, Abe Lincoln, and a cast of
thousands, probably including some of your ancestors. 
About 20 percent of the questions of the test will cover the
period up to 1789. The story starts with American Indians
having the whole place to themselves for about 30 times
as long as any Europeans have lived here. 
Another 30 percent of the questions on the test will be from
Independence through the Civil War. That means the history
in this section is about half of your tank full of knowledge.
It’s an exciting story, but read Chapters 7 through 13
slowly and carefully. Test day is a-comin’ . . .

T
he AP U.S. History exam doesn’t thump heads too much on American Indian history
before Christopher Columbus, partly because high-school AP courses vary too much on
pre-Columbian American history for the test makers to be sure what students have learned.
Also, we historians are a little shaky on just what did go on back then. Nobody took notes.
Although the AP may not have many questions on pre-Columbian America, you’ll want to
scan this chapter anyway as insurance, should an early-times question arise. You want to
know as much as you can about the long years of our American Indian forebears. After all, if
the room you’re sitting in were the history of human beings in North America, the amount of
time settlers have lived here would be the space behind the curtains.
Encountering the First Americans
Christopher Columbus wasn’t looking for a new world in 1492; he was just trying to get to
China without having to walk, as his Italian predecessor Marco Polo had done more than 200
years before. Polo had reported in his book The Million that China was full of untold riches.
Columbus had a well-thumbed copy of Polo’s story by his side as he contemplated a cruise
to the jewels of the East. He also saw a map based on one that Polo had brought back with
him years before. On this map, you can still make out Europe, Asia, and Africa in blobby
form, right where they’re supposed to be. What’s missing is the entire New World.
Not surprisingly, when Columbus landed, he called the people he met Indians. They didn’t
look Chinese, so they must be Indians from the East Indies, related somehow to the India that
Polo had visited and Alexander the Great had fought way back in Greek times. Columbus
took six years of return voyages before he had to confront the fact in a message to his royal
sponsors: “I have come to believe that this is a mighty continent which was hitherto
unknown . . . .Your Highnesses have an Other World here.”

35,000 years before Columbus
The people Columbus called Indians didn’t think they were in a strange new world; they were
home in the land that legends told them had been theirs since the beginning of time. They
knew every rock and tree and had a name for every valley and river. These first people had
well-practiced ways of surviving with the thousands of plants and animals around them.
Actually, even the first American Indians were relative newcomers to their lands compared to
the history of the Old World; human beings have lived in the New World for less than a tenth
of the time they have been settled in Asia, Europe, and Africa.
Human beings have lived in China and Northern Asia for at least 300,000 years and for as
long as 1 million years. About 35,000 years ago, an ice age froze over the water between what
are now Siberia and Alaska. Native hunters, probably following migrating herds of game,
walked across this convenient ice bridge to Alaska. Because it was cold, they kept heading
south.
When the ice age melted about 10,000 years ago, the Bering Straits went back to being water,
and the New World was cut off from the Old. This was okay for the American Indians; the
same big thaw opened passes through the mountains to the south. Roaming gradually through
the beautiful wilderness that still covers much of North America, the first people reached the
tip of South America by 9,000 BCE, some 15,000 miles from the land bridge they had crossed
from Siberia. That means they averaged about 1 mile of migration every 2 years.
In the year before Columbus landed, 100 million first people probably inhabited the New
World. More people lived in North and South America than in Europe. Not all these first
people whom Columbus called Indians were hunter–gatherers. The New World had cities
before the Egyptians built the pyramids.
At the time of Columbus, the Aztec capital city (in what became Mexico City) was larger than
any city in Europe. Unlike the dirty European cities of the 1400s, the Aztec capital had running
water, clean streets, and botanical gardens. This beauty didn’t lead to mellow living; as many
as 5,000 human beings were sacrificed every year to please the Aztec king and his gods.
2,000 cultures
Whereas kingdoms like the Aztec were able to control large areas of land for a time, many
American Indians were split into small tribes that spoke at least 2,000 different languages —
ten times the number of languages spoken in Europe. American Indians spoke a lot of lan-
guages because they had little reason to conquer and consolidate with neighboring groups.
Hunter–gatherers aren’t very interested in dominating their neighbors. What are they going
to get — more room to hunt and gather? Only with the beginning of agriculture did property
become worth seizing, and people were vulnerable to domination because they couldn’t
move away from their crops to avoid being conquered.
Agriculture also fed the large population centers. The Aztecs in Mexico, Mayans in Central
America, and Incas in Peru built networks of roads and amazing cities with incredible build-
ings and artwork. They were experts at raising more than 100 varieties of corn — one kind
for every taste and climate. One modern scientific journal calls the American Indians’ devel-
opment of many corn types from a barely edible wild plant the greatest feat of genetic engi-
neering in history.
If the AP test has a question on pre-Columbian American Indians, it may well contain that
favorite buzzword of people who write early-history tests: Mesoamerica. Relax. Meso just
means middle of the New World, as in south Mexico and Central America. This term throws a
lot of people because it’s not part of the current United States that you thought you were
studying.
80
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

Blame those advanced southern American Indians; they’re just more interesting than the
hunter–gatherers and early agriculturalists who peopled what’s now the United States. The
Mesoamerican culture area included some of the most complex and organized people of the
Americas, including the Olmecs, the Mayans, and the Aztecs. These cultures developed
advanced political systems; discovered technological, scientific, and mathematical concepts;
and participated in long-distance road networks that covered hundreds of miles and resulted
in the transmission of ideas and products. Way to go, Mesoamerica!
The Original Empires Were American Indian
So why do you have to know about the three great American Indian empires that happened
1,000 miles south of the Rio Grande U.S. border? Because these southern American Indian
superstates influenced the development of the United States, both directly and indirectly.
The riches that the American Indian empires amassed with the gold they discovered
attracted the Spanish conquistadores like flies to a picnic. Easy conquests of large civiliza-
tions emboldened Europeans armed with only primitive guns and swords. The Spanish won
partly because the American Indians were surprised by their weapons but mostly because
the American Indians couldn’t believe how ruthless the Europeans were. Spanish riches sped
the development of the New World and provided rich plunder for the buccaneers of other
European nations.
The American Indian empires funded the Spanish empire. After the defeat of the Spanish
Armada by England in 1588, other nations started colonies in the New World in hopes of find-
ing similar riches. Many of these colonies were investor-owned joint stock companies —
undertakings that wouldn’t have found support were it not for the Spanish experience with
rich American Indian empires. More on that in Chapter 8.
Tales of cities of gold eventually led explorers overland into what’s now the American
Southwest. Accounts of distant civilizations and new worlds to discover always stirred
European adventurers into action.
Digging the Big Three cultures: 
Mayan, Incas, and Aztecs
The Mayan, Incan, and Aztec Empires were the three large American Indian empires encoun-
tered by Spanish explorers. A predecessor civilization called the Olmec died out two thou-
sand years before the Spanish arrived but started some of the traditions common to later
American Indian empires.
The Mayan
North of present-day Panama and extending into what’s now southern Mexico, the Mayan
(800 CE) built temple cities with tall pyramids surrounding wide plazas in the deserts, moun-
tains, and rain forests. About 700 miles south of what’s now Mexico City, the Mayan were a
Mesoamerican civilization noted for having the only fully developed written language of the
pre-Columbian Americas. They were also known for their intricate art, building techniques,
and mathematical and astronomical developments. Mayan civilization ran until the arrival of
the Spanish more than 2,000 years later.
Mayan writing used a system similar to that of the early Egyptians and Chinese. Mayan scribes
had picture words, called glyphs, that could stand for a noun or a syllable sound. The Mayan
were talented farmers who grew early corn variants, called maize, in raised fields. The Mayan
81
Chapter 7: Living on the Land: American Indians from 35,000 BCE to 1491 CE

people never disappeared, neither with the rise of other powerful American Indian kingdoms
nor with the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores and the subsequent Spanish takeover.
Today, the Mayan and their descendants form sizable populations throughout the Mayan
area and maintain a distinctive set of traditions and beliefs that are the result of the merger
of pre-Columbian and post-conquest ideas. The Mayan may seem to worship in Christian
churches, but many of their beliefs are thousands of years old.
The Incas
The Incas (1400) are the second-oldest civilization of the big three, beginning their empire in
about 1000 CE. At its height, the Incan empire stretched for 2,500 miles, almost as long as the
distance across the continental United States. From 1438 to 1533, the Incas used both con-
quest and peaceful assimilation to influence a large portion of western South America. The
center of their empire was in the Andean mountain ranges, including modern Ecuador, Peru,
western and south-central Bolivia, northwest Argentina, north and north-central Chile, and
southern Colombia. 
Incan palaces were surrounded by high walls made of huge, closely fitted stones. Like their
empire neighbors to the north, the Inca connected their vast holdings with paved roads.
Their mountain towns include the stunning Machu Picchu. The Incas developed a system of
terraced agriculture fed by canals and aqueducts to allow farming in the mountains; they
gave the world the tomato and the potato. Incan government and agriculture were well devel-
oped by the time the conquistador Francisco Pizarro (1532) stopped by and led his force to
victory over the Inca.
The Aztecs
The Aztecs (1300) were the youngest of the Big Three American Indian empires. They hit the
big time in modern-day Mexico City in about 1300 CE, just in time for a couple of hundred
years of fun before Hernan Cortez and his Spanish buddies arrived to spoil the party. Mexico
City was a city in the middle of a lake, with beautiful temples built along canals and a system
of floating island gardens that fed much of the population. As the northernmost empire in
Mesoamerica, Mexico City was connected with its provinces and tributary states by a good
system of roads usually maintained through tribute from local rulers. Because the people
had no horses or any kind of wheeled vehicles, the roads favored fast travel on foot. By order
of the Aztecs, travelers had places to rest, eat, and even use a latrine at regular intervals —
roughly every five to seven miles. Couriers with messages constantly traveled along those
ways, keeping the Aztecs informed of events and reporting whether the roads needed work.
Due to this steady surveillance, even women could travel alone — a fact that amazed the
Spaniards because lone women hadn’t been safe in Europe since the time of the Romans.
The Aztecs were a warlike people with a king, priests, tax collectors, and a merchant middle
class. They captured prisoners in constant conflicts and used them for human sacrifices.
Their American Indian enemies helped Cortez, with his small band of brave and bloodthirsty
soldiers, conquer the Aztecs and kill their king. This event led to an uprising in Mexico City,
from which Cortez barely escaped with his life. Other American Indians were glad to see the
Aztecs removed from the complete power they’d enjoyed for only a few years.
Don’t get caught confusing the Big Three American Indian empires. Just remember this: I’m
not confused, AM I? From north to south, the three empires spell AM, I. The Aztecs are in
Mexico, the Mayans are in Central America, and the Inca are in South America. In terms of
age of the empires, they run MIA, as in missing in action. Mayans are the oldest, followed by
the Incas and then the Aztecs. Both the Incas and the Aztecs got to rule for only a short time
before the Spanish arrived. The Mayans had thousands of years to enjoy the limelight and
were in serious decline when the Spanish arrived to end the party.

Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

End of an empire
With just 180 men, 27 horses, and 1 cannon, Pizzaro often had to talk his way out of potential
fights that could have easily wiped out his little band. The main type of battle in the Andes
consisted of siege warfare, in which large numbers of drafted men were sent to overwhelm
opponents.
Along with material superiority in the form of armor, weapons, and horses, the Spaniards
acquired tens of thousands of native allies only too glad to end the Inca control of their terri-
tories. Combined, all of their resources and tactics allowed the Spanish to capture the emperor
and subsequently throw the Incan ruling classes into a political struggle. The Spanish also
kept increasing their native allies until they had enough people and resources to launch a
successful attack on the Incan capital city.
The American Indian empires ended, but their cultural heritage lives on. Most Mexicans and
Central and South Americans have American Indian ancestors. Anyone who has ever eaten a
burrito, a taco, or even a french-fried potato has eaten American Indian food. Chewing gum,
chocolate, and brightly patterned clothing left their American Indian-empire beginnings to
become part of the world.
Question: What were the major American Indian empires encountered by Spanish
explorers in Mesoamerica?
Answer: The Mayan, Incan, and Aztec empires.
Nothing Corny about Civilization Advancements
Corny as it sounds, corn made all the difference to American Indian civilization. The first
planted-corn agriculture occurred in the Mexican highlands in about 5,000 BCE — a full
30,000 years after the first people got to the New World and around the time large-scale crop-
raising got going in Egypt and the Middle East. Corn-growing took 4,000 years to reach the
American Southwest, where corn supported an advancing culture 1,000 years before the
birth of Christ.
The Anazazis in what’s now New Mexico managed to build an apartment house with more
than 600 interconnecting rooms. When the Spanish explorers reached the Southwest, they
found villages of terraced multistory buildings. (Pueblo, the Spanish word now used for these
American Indian settlements, means village.)
Another 2,000 years later, the American Indians in what’s now the Eastern United States got
the good news about corn-planting. In 1,000 CE, corn helped support a settlement of 25,000
people near modern-day St. Louis. By the time agriculture got to the eastern section of what’s
now the United States, the American Indians had only a few hundred years to enjoy cultiva-
tion in peace before the arrival of the Europeans.
Charting American Indians in North America
The American Indians living in North America before Columbus’ arrival were divided into
Northeast, Southeast, Great Plains, Southeast, Great Basin, Plateau, California, and Northwest
Coast civilizations. They consisted of thousands of small groups loosely connected into
83
Chapter 7: Living on the Land: American Indians from 35,000 BCE to 1491 CE

tribes. Western American Indians were mostly hunter-gatherers. The Eastern American
Indians devised a clever system of what they called three sisters agriculture: corn, beans, and
squash. Beans grew on the stalks of corn, and squash covered the planting mound to hold
moisture in the soil. This method supported some of the largest tribes, including the
Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw in the Southeast.
In the northern woodlands of what are now New York and New England was a remarkable
alliance called the Iroquois Confederacy (also known as the League of Peace and Power, the
Five Nations, the Six Nations, and the People of the Longhouse). This group of First Nations/
American Indians originally consisted of five tribes: the Mohawk, the Oneida, the Onondaga,
the Cayuga, and the Seneca.
A sixth tribe, the Tuscarora, joined after the settlers came. Their constitution, called the
Great Law of Peace, was handed down from the Middle Ages, when Europe was just a collec-
tion of feuding local rulers. The Iroquois Confederation actually served as one model for the
development of the U.S. Constitution.
Although what’s now the United States had some centers of development, the American
Indian population of this area before Columbus probably never exceeded 4 million.
Agriculture simply arrived too late to support large urban areas. In some areas, planting
never arrived at all. The California American Indians spoke more than 200 languages and
lived in small, stable communities near rich seashore and mountain food sources. These
early Californians had the chance to develop agriculture but never bothered. Surf’s up, man.
Carrying Death in a Handshake
Explorers are biological weapons. They don’t mean to, but they carry diseases for which
native populations have no immunities. These diseases killed many — perhaps most — of
the American Indians in the New World before they had ever seen a European.
Good roads in the American Indian empires and nomadic migration by the plains American
Indians allowed diseases to spread like wildfire. American Indians had no tradition of quaran-
tine, which Europe had learned to use for epidemics; American Indians stayed close to their
sick friends. Although staying close to those who are ill is good for human support, it’s bad
for the transmission of infectious diseases. Europeans brought smallpox, measles, bubonic
plague, influenza, typhus, diphtheria, and scarlet fever to the New World, and close American
Indian communities spread these diseases.
When explorers spread out to settle new lands, their diseases went with them. Friendly Taino
natives met Columbus when he landed on Hispaniola, the island the Spanish named for them-
selves. Within 50 years, the estimated 1 million local people on Hispaniola were reduced to a
pathetic and lonely 200. The conquistadores managed to defeat big American Indian empires
largely because these empires were already collapsing from within. With friends and allies
dying all around them, the American Indians fought desperate wars among themselves for
the few resources left. Fighting and illness left them relatively easy conquests for the
Europeans.
Europeans had fished in southern New England for more than 100 years before the Pilgrims
landed in 1620. They met the American Indians and, without meaning to, passed on some dis-
eases. The native inhabitants had no resistance to the illnesses brought by the Europeans,
and within a few years, a plague wiped out 90 percent of the inhabitants of coastal New
England. This death rate was unknown in all previous human experience. Even the Black
Plague in the 1300s left 70 percent of Europe’s population alive. The American Indians who
met the Pilgrims were a confused and disorganized remnant, fighting among themselves.
84
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

When most of your friends are dead, part of your spirit dies with them. American Indians felt
that their Supreme Being must have abandoned them. Some survivors of the Cherokee lost
all confidence in their religion and destroyed the sacred objects of their tribe. American
Indians were so reduced in numbers that they offered little real opposition to European
invaders; some even looked upon the settlers for possible salvation.
Before the arrival of European explorers, the native population of North and South America
may have been 100 million in 1491. The entire population of Europe at the time was 70 mil-
lion. If colonists hadn’t been able to take over lands that the American Indians had already
cleared and cultivated, and if the American Indian population hadn’t suffered devastating epi-
demics, the landing of the explorers may have been a very different story.
Question: What was the largest cause of death for American Indians during the
European conquest?
Answer: The largest cause of death was disease unintentionally spread by explorers.
By 1900, the American Indian population of the New World was less than 1 million — a drop
of 99 percent from Columbus’s day. The United States had only 250,000 American Indians.
Today, people are proud of their American Indian blood. In the 2000 U.S. census, more than 4
million Americans listed themselves as all or part American Indian.
Uneven Gift Exchange
What settlers brought to the New World versus what they took home leaves the American
Indians way ahead on the gift exchange. The Old World brought death and domination to the
people who lived in North and South America; the New World gave the Old World a new life.
Eventually, European ideas of individual freedom would bring more options to American
Indian survivors, but in the short run, the settlers profited far more than the American
Indians.
Spain was poor and barely united when Columbus sailed. Through New World gold and
silver, Spain was the richest country in Europe within a few decades. After the importation of
corn, potatoes, pineapples, tomatoes, beans, vanilla, and chocolate from the New World,
Europe had a chance to get fat and happy. The population of Europe more than doubled
while Europeans spent the money and passed around the great food. Tobacco and syphilis
also came from the Americas, but getting involved with either was generally a personal
choice. Europe got tomato sauce for spaghetti and pizza, potatoes to go with meat, plus
vanilla and chocolate for ice cream. What a deal!

W
hen Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492, he almost ended up in a
great big stew. He landed half a world away from where he was heading (he origi-
nally intended to land in Asia, in the East Indies), and he got to the Bahamas but forgot his
swimming suit. These missteps were forgiven after the Spanish found gold and realized that
they’d discovered a whole new world, which was named for explorer–mapmaker Amerigo
Vespucci. Maybe the song should say “God Bless Vespucciland,” but America sounds better.
(See more about Columbus later in this chapter.)
When European nations established colonies in America, the Spanish chose first and went
south, where they found gold and silver. The British had a little navigation problem getting
through the Spanish Armada, but eventually they went north and found mostly rocks and
swamps. Clearing their way through American Indians, the Dutch, and some mighty lean
years, British settlers built homes and livings in unique ways in different colonies. These
colonies forged a particular trend toward freedom, even while slavery grew. This trend
helped make the New World a major influence on the whole world.
Don’t miss the forest for the trees. The AP exam concentrates on overall political, economic,
and social (PES) trends, not so much on individual personal or state history. You need the
whole story to have PES ammunition for writing essays. Don’t try so hard to memorize every-
thing that you lose the big picture.
In this chapter, you discover history from Columbus through the establishment of all the
early colonies, all the way to the Salem witch trials on the eve of the 1700s. Pay special atten-
tion to early U.S. colonial trends; questions about this period are bound to show up on the
big AP test.
Europeans Settle into the New World
Explorer Christopher Columbus (1492) was a little late and a lot short. He originally intended
to land in the East Indies, but after six weeks at sea, the East Indies were still a cool 10,000
miles away, and his sailors were beginning to get a little testy. Just when Columbus looked as
though he may end up on the sharp end of a pike, over the horizon loomed history’s greatest
consolation prize, the New World of North and South America.

The AP U.S. History exam isn’t going to dwell much on Columbus. He gets too much competi-
tion from Leif Eriksson and his voyaging Vikings of 1000 CE for first-discoverer naming rights.
The AP likes to concentrate instead on What It All Meant. Columbus in 1492 was important
because he represented the beginning of permanent settlement in the New World.
Finding the New World changes the whole world
The settlement that began with Columbus eventually changed nearly all the world’s conti-
nents in the following ways:
 North and South America through conquest and new communities
 Europe through gold and food from the Americas
 Africa through slavery and trade
 Asia, Australia, and the South Seas through commerce encouraged by New World 
discoveries
The New World was actually more of a team effort: Europe provided the money and the mar-
kets; Africa furnished a lot of the labor; and the New World produced gold and land for grow-
ing high-profit, bad-for-you crops like sugar cane and tobacco. Additionally, more than half 
of all the food grown in the world today originated in the New World. Fed by potatoes, 
tomatoes, corn, and beans first grown in the Americas, the population of Europe doubled.
Although Africa suffered from slavery, it also benefited from new foods like cassava and
sweet potatoes. For better or worse, the whole world became new.
In addition to colonization, the biggest impact that the European colonists had on the New
World was the introduction of diseases against which American Indians had no defense.
Within a few hundred years of the October morning when Columbus’ ship sighted land, as
much as 90 percent of the American Indian population was dead. This situation made the
conquest of America much easier for the Europeans, leaving room for settlement, not just
military victory. Many of the American Indians whom the Europeans did meet were dazed
and confused survivors of ancient cultures that had been lost forever. Tribes moved and
intermingled, but they had limited resources for taking united action against the European
invaders.
Settling in with the Spanish and Portuguese
Before colonizing America, Europeans had been fighting one another for hundreds of years.
Due to some smooth-sailing explorers, Spain and Portugal were in the lead for international
conquest moving into the late 1400s.
So that these two leading-explorer countries wouldn’t step on each other’s toes, the pope
helpfully issued a decree in the year after Columbus’ first voyage, dividing the New World
between Spain and Portugal. Because the pope’s line managed to miss pretty much all the
land, leaving Portugal holding nothing but waves, the two countries got together and amica-
bly signed the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494). This agreement moved the dividing line a few hun-
dred miles west, so that Portugal at least got Brazil, plus a little bonus land in Africa and
Asia. Spain got the rest of the “heathen” world and immediately got down to some heavy-
duty conquistadoring.
Spanish explorers spent a lot of time in hot armor looking for gold. Some looked in all the
wrong places in North America, but all managed to make some interesting discoveries:

 Ferdinand Magellan (1519) sailed west from Spain with five small boats and an interna-
tional crew of Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English, and German sailors. After
making it around South America (the Strait of Magellan is named for him), he died in
the Philippines, but a few members of his crew made it all the way around the world
and home again in 1522 with a cargo of cinnamon and cloves.
 Ponce de Leon (1513) checked out Florida.
 Francisco Coronado (1540) spent years marching around the Southwest. Coronado
found the Grand Canyon and millions of buffalo but nothing he could put in the bank.
 Hernando de Soto (1539), with 600 men in bright armor, checked out the middle South.
De Soto ended up sunk in the Mississippi River, but after three years, a few of his men
made it back wearing animal skins.
 Francisco Pizarro (1532) persuaded the Incan king to turn over his gold and then
turned over his whole kingdom looking for more.
 Hernán Cortés (1519) took over the Aztec Empire, centered in Mexico City, happily trad-
ing the lives of his men and thousands of natives for gold. For variety, the mines in
what’s now Bolivia produced tons of silver.
Soon, Spain and the rest of Europe were glittering with precious metal. New World treasure
made Europe rich. Having money to explore, trade, and conquer made Europe even richer.
Bringing Christianity to the New World
The encomienda system assigned groups of American Indians to colonists who were sup-
posed to Christianize them but who actually used them as slaves. Conquistadores signed
agreements with the Spanish king, raised money from investors, and then marched off look-
ing for plunder. Only about 10,000 of these mercenaries existed, but they had guns, horses,
and no hesitation about killing anybody who got in their way. To turn a profit for themselves
and their investors, the conquistadores were experts at getting American Indians to fight one
another. Many sincerely believed they were bringing the gift of true Christianity to a savage
world; any gold they picked up along the way must be their just reward.
A Black Legend historical theme popular in the 1900s said that the Spanish killed, raped, and
looted for treasure, leaving nothing but suffering behind. Although some Spaniards certainly
were cruel and greedy, Spain hardly had a monopoly on those bad habits. Spanish settlers
who thought they were spreading the word of God founded missions and settlements in
places that had no gold, including New Mexico and California. (Ironically, gold was discov-
ered in California just nine days before Spain’s successor, Mexico, turned the territory over
to the United States.)
Blending cultures and blending people
The conquerors also married American Indian women. The women converted to Catholicism,
couples got married, and the Spanish–American Indian children were called mestizos. This
wonderful mixture of cultures forms much of the population of Mexico, Central America, and
South America to this day.
La Malinche was a native Aztec woman who accompanied Hernán Cortés and played an
active role in the Spanish conquest of Mexico. La Malinche smoothed the way for Cortés as
an interpreter and intermediary. She also was the mother of Cortés’ son, who’s considered
one of the first mestizos. In Mexico today, people both love and hate La Malinche. She’s
remembered alternately as a traitor, a sellout, a heroine who helped save at least some of the
89
Chapter 8: Sailing to a New Home: 1492–1690

Aztecs, and the symbolic mother of the new Mexican people. The Mexicans also celebrate
Columbus Day as Día de la Raza — the birthday of what they see as their whole new race of
people.
Spaniards’ ideas of civilization often backfired on them. The Pueblo Revolt, also known as
Popé’s Rebellion (1680), was an American Indian uprising in New Mexico that killed hundreds
of Spanish settlers and priests. The American Indians rebuilt their sacred kiva (ceremonial
chamber) on the ruins of the Spanish plaza in Santa Fe; Spain needed almost 30 years to
regain control. In the New World as a whole, the influence of a Spanish culture willing to
intermarry with native society is still evident from San Francisco 8,000 miles south to the tip
of South America.
Dealing with pirates of the Caribbean
No more than 50 years after Columbus discovered the Bahamas, hundreds of small Spanish
and mestizo towns had sprung up, especially near the gold and silver in Mexico and Peru.
The Spanish founded the first universities in the New World, 85 years before the English got
around to starting Harvard. In fact, the Spanish get the credit for the first permanent town in
what would become the United States. They built a fort at St. Augustine, Florida (1565), way
before Disney World came around. The Spanish fortified St. Augustine to hold off real-life
pirates of the Caribbean.
All that Spanish treasure attracted fortune hunters with ships who didn’t mind stealing from
the Spanish (who had stolen it from the natives anyway). Privateers (a name they preferred
to pirates) operated from around 1560 to the mid-1760s. The period during which pirates
were most successful was the 1640s through the 1680s. Caribbean piracy arose out of con-
flicts over trade and colonization among the rival European powers, including England,
Spain, Holland, Portugal, and France. Most of the privateers who had permission from their
governments to attack foreign ships were from Holland and England.
Because Spain controlled most of the Caribbean, most of the attacked cities and ships
belonged to the Spanish Empire. Some of the best-known pirate bases were in the Bahamas
(1715 to 1725), Tortuga (established in the 1640s), and Port Royal (after 1655). Among the
most famous Caribbean pirates were Edward Teach (also known as Blackbeard) and Henry
Morgan.
Having trouble with the neighbors
Closer to home, the Spanish were having trouble holding their European domination over the
Protestant country of Holland. They sent their great fleet — the Spanish Armada (1588) — to
invade and subdue England, Holland’s Protestant supporter.
In a battle just north of the English Channel, the English and Dutch attacked the armada.
Even though they were outnumbered, the attacking ships managed to scatter the armada and
sink some of the ships. More armada ships were lost in storms that showed up just in time to
help the defenders. When England and Spain finally signed a peace treaty in 1604, the English
were free to move to unclaimed North America. Spanish power began a slow decline that
lasted for more than 300 years.
Getting colonial with the English
Poor and distracted by local conflicts, the best the English could do to get into the explo-
ration game was to send out a ringer. A captain the English called John Cabot (1497) (even
though he was really an Italian named Giovanni Caboto) sailed along the coast of what’s now
Canada. The exploration received funding from British businessmen eager to make a profit
90
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

trading with the Spice Islands. When Cabot didn’t come back from a second voyage, England
decided to put the whole exploration thing on the back burner for a while.
Spain and Portugal had a 100-year head start in colonizing Mexico and South America, but
nothing much was happening north of there. The Spanish had sniffed around but hadn’t
found anything glittering and immediately saleable. Then, at almost the same time, Europe
came to stay in three corners of North America:
 The French built a fur-trading post at Quebec, Canada (1608).
 The Spanish built a mission at Santa Fe, New Mexico (1610).
 The English established their first permanent colony at Jamestown, Virginia (1607).
Jamestown wasn’t England’s first shot at New World colonization:
 Sir Francis Drake (1580) had done so well as a pirate of the Caribbean that Queen
Elizabeth I knighted him as a way of saying thanks for all the Spanish gold he 
brought back.
 Sir Walter Raleigh (1585) founded a short-lived colony of 100 men and women on
Roanoke Island. The colony survived long enough for the birth of Virginia Dare, the
first English child born in the New World. When a ship carrying supplies arrived after a
3-year absence, the crew found everybody gone, with houses and fortifications neatly
removed. The only clue was the word Croatoan carved into a post of the fort and Cro
carved into a nearby tree. The survivors of the colony may have gone to live with a
nearby friendly tribe of Croatoan American Indians and intermarried.
The latter point, if it’s true, represents last major intermarrying the English did with the
American Indians because, unlike the Spanish, the English brought their wives with them to
America. The English did enough reproducing by themselves; in the 50 years up to 1600, the
population of England increased by one third. At the same time, a change from growing crops
to growing sheep displaced a lot of English farmers. People were looking for a place to go,
and settling in America seemed like an ideal solution.
Staying on in Jamestown
The English went to Jamestown for all the wrong reasons. Their privately financed joint-stock
Virginia Company wanted to find gold or at least a passage to the rich Spice Islands of Asia.
The colonists were under some pressure to produce riches; if they didn’t, they could be
abandoned in the wilderness.
Question: Who owned Jamestown?
Answer: A joint-stock company eager for profits owned the colony.
In the great tradition of brown-nosing, the name Jamestown paid tribute to then-ruling
English King James I. The territory’s name, Virginia, honored the alleged lovemaking status of
the previous ruler, Queen Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen. (Imagine if people still named places
for love status — say HotToTrot Land or Dreamyville.)
The Charter of the Virginia Company guaranteed the colonists basic rights as Englishmen.
The colony had about 100 settlers to start, all of them men. They were too busy looking for
gold to gather much food, so a lot of them died from hunger and the diseases that go with it.
In 1608, Captain John Smith took over and whipped the surviving colonists into shape with a
simple rule: “He who shall not work shall not eat.” Earlier, Smith had been saved by the
American Indian princess Pocahontas, who went on to marry another settler, help protect
the colony, and visit England to meet the king.
91
Chapter 8: Sailing to a New Home: 1492–1690

Still, times were tough: Of the 400 settlers who had gone to Jamestown by 1609, only 60 sur-
vived the “starving time” winter. Twelve hundred English people lived in Virginia by 1625, but
an additional six thousand died trying to live on this edge of the New World.
Forming and breaking alliances with the American Indians
Pocahontas tried to keep the peace, but after she died during her trip to England, the colonists
and American Indians fought a series of wars. By 1650, the Chesapeakes had been banished
from all the land around Jamestown; by 1685, few American Indians remained. This pattern
repeated as English colonies came in contact with American Indians across North America:
first cooperation, then conflict, and finally removal and severe population decline for the
American Indians. As outlined in Chapter 7, disease often destroyed native people and cul-
ture before they ever saw a European settler.
American Indian tribes moved, made and broke alliances, and fought wars with one another
for thousands of years before the Europeans came. The arrival of the settlers was like intro-
ducing an elephant into the living room; everyone had to shift around. Looking for land to
live on, tribes moved hundreds of miles and fought other tribes. For some American Indians,
this migration was good; they got guns from settlers and made good profits delivering furs
and acting as scouts for the Europeans. Competition for shrinking hunting grounds led to
increased American-Indian-on-American-Indian violence.
Lots of American Indians moved west toward the Great Plains as English settlements spread
out from the East. Tribes like the Sioux, who previously led quiet lives on the edge of the
forest, learned to ride escaped Spanish horses and became Great Plains buffalo hunters and
raiders. The Iroquois Confederation in the northern colonies benefited from alliances and
trades with settlers, and actually grew in power for 100 years. But for most American Indians,
the arrival of Europeans was an unmitigated disaster. In a world governed by survival of the
strongest, the concept of human rights was still a long way off.
Setting up as offshore sugar daddies
As the first wave of settlers left Britain, twice as many English pioneers went to the West
Indies as came to the rocky, swampy shores of North America. They didn’t go because they
had timeshares; they went to grow sugar, the other bad-for-you big money-maker of the New
World. Although they could grow tobacco in their Virginia backyards, sugar cane required
large plantations and thousands of workers. New World slavery really got its start in the West
Indies. While small farmers were working their own land in the mainland colonies during the
late 1600s, West Indies plantation owners were busy importing more than 250,000 enslaved
people from Africa. Before long, blacks outnumbered whites four to one.
The inhuman Barbados slave code (1661) required that slave owners dress their slaves. That
was about it. The code denied slaves even the most basic right guaranteed under English
common law: the right to life. It allowed slaveholders to do whatever they wanted to their
slaves, including mutilating and burning them alive for punishment, without fear of the law.
Plantation owners were so busy growing sugar that they squeezed out most of the small
farmers who grew food for the islands. These farmers moved to the North American
colonies, bringing a few slaves and the slave code with them.
Germany and Italy didn’t start colonies in the New World because these nations didn’t even
get themselves organized until the late 1800s. The English settlements along the American
coast grew because they had more settlers who came to stay. The French were either happy
at home (the food was better) or would have left if the king hadn’t forbidden them to go to
America (like the French Protestants). The Spanish and Portuguese saw the New World as more
of a money mine than a place to start a new life. The English began to settle down and build
some permanent family homes in the New World, whereas Spanish colonial administrators
92
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

just sent money back to the central government in Europe. When English colonies were
mostly self-governing in politics and religion, Spanish colonies were ruled centrally from the
mother country.
Question: What were some differences between the Spanish and English colonies?
Answer: The English operated politics and religion locally (instead of reporting back to the
central mother country like Spain) and used their New World settlements to build per-
sonal wealth rather than sending everything back to Europe.
Establishing the Future States: 
The American Colonies
If you were choosing where to settle in the new colonies during the 1600s, you probably
wouldn’t pick the Northern colonies for their climate or chances of supporting your shot at
tobacco riches. What the North had was a place to raise a family and own your own land. As
the country grew up, the Northern colonies made up for what they lacked in agricultural
riches with smart money from commerce and industry. Meanwhile, they also offered the
purifying search for spiritual truth.
Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia all developed as large plantation colonies
focused on growing and exporting agricultural products. Whereas independent North
Carolina and reform-born Georgia protected the rights of small farmers, the economic system
of the South favored large landowners. With lots of slaves and not many citizens, developing
a system of schools or even alternative types of religion was hard. The standard Church of
England dominated the South and collected taxes to ensure its support. By growing tobacco,
rice, and eventually cotton, the South made a lot of money for a limited number of rich
planters. These planters controlled politics because nonlandowners couldn’t vote. Because
big planters weren’t interested, the South had virtually no industry and no public school
system until after the Civil War.
Pennsylvania, New York. and New Jersey came to be known as the bread colonies because
they grew grain for the rest of the Eastern Seaboard. But their industry wasn’t all agriculture.
They had forests of big beautiful trees to cut down, and the lumber from these trees built
houses, businesses, and ships. All these crops and construction opportunities gave business
to the growing ports of New York City, Philadelphia, and Albany. The middle colonies were
midway between small-farm New England and the big-plantation South. Government fell
midway between the superdemocratic town meetings of New England and the autocratic
rich-man’s government of the South. The middle colonies weren’t middle in freedom.
Especially in Pennsylvania, people enjoyed religious freedom and a cosmopolitan tolerance
for minorities.
Pilgrims, Puritans, and Massachusetts: 
Leading the way
America was built in the smoke from the great fire of the Protestant Reformation. A German
priest named Martin Luther (1517) broke with the Roman Catholic Church, which had ruled
Christianity since the late Roman Empire. Luther said that individuals had to have a personal
relationship with God and the Bible; priests and popes couldn’t tell them what to think or 
sell them a ticket to heaven. In his Institutes of the Christian Religion (1536), John Calvin went
further. Calvin said God had already chosen who would go to heaven and who would burn in
93
Chapter 8: Sailing to a New Home: 1492–1690

hell; this theory was the predestination of the elect. God knew everything, and no amount of
good works would change his mind.
Conveniently for English believers, King Henry VIII (1533) had just kicked the Catholic church
out of England over his multiple-marriage issue. As England scrambled to piece together its
own church, religious beliefs were up for grabs. This confusion drove both radical Protestants
(who didn’t think the English church was changing fast enough) and out-of-favor Catholics
(who felt it was changing too fast) to the New World for a little spiritual breathing room.
First out the door were the most radical Protestants, a small group of Separatists who
wanted nothing to do with the new Church of England. They headed in the opposite direction
from America and spent 12 years in Holland. The Dutch were tolerant of their religious rights,
but the Pilgrims didn’t like that their kids were assimilating to the Dutch lifestyle. After a
short stop back home to load some supplies on a little boat about 35 steps long called the
Mayflower, 50 Pilgrims and 52 other settlers sailed for Virginia.
After two months of bobbing across the Atlantic, the Mayflower crew landed 700 miles 
north of where they were aiming, on a peninsula now called Plymouth in a land now called
Massachusetts. Before they even got off the ship, the settlers signed the Mayflower Compact
(1620), agreeing to make decisions by the will of the majority. From this simple agreement
and the open town meetings that followed came a feeling for participatory democracy that
now has a history of almost 400 years in the United States. The Pilgrims had great leaders: a
short non-Separatist soldier named Myles Standish (also called Captain Shrimp) and William
Bradford, an eloquent self-taught scholar who could read five languages. More than half of
the Pilgrims died the first winter, so when they brought in a good harvest the next year, they
really did have a happy Thanksgiving. Their little Plymouth colony never had more than a
few thousand people; late in the 1600s, it merged with the Massachusetts Bay Colony a few
miles to the north.
The Massachusetts Bay Colony (1630), which would become Boston, was settled by Puritans
who didn’t think they actually had to leave the Church of England to follow the word of God.
They came to America to escape political repression, a bad economy, and restrictions on
their religion. They got off to a strong start with almost 1,000 well-equipped settlers arriving
on 11 boats. They also had an excellent leader in John Winthrop, who served for 19 years.
Around 20,000 more settlers arrived during the first 12 years of the colony, although twice as
many headed south for the warm breezes and easy sugar living of Barbados.
Question: Were the Puritans Separatists?
Answer: No. They wanted to purify the Church of England from within.
The Bay Colony offered freedom but no easy living. All freemen who belonged to the Puritan
church could vote. That meant about two out of five people — a much higher percentage of
voter participation than anyplace else at the time. The catch was that to be in the church,
you were supposed to have had a conversion experience that identified you as one of the vis-
ible saints. In other words, God had to pick you to go to heaven before you could go to
church. And yes, you took a test. Prospective church members had to explain to an interview
panel how they knew God had chosen them (without sounding stuck-up, of course).
Question: Why did the Puritans leave England?
Answer: They left to escape political repression, recession, and religious restrictions.
Back in the early days of Puritan orthodoxy, the freethinking Anne Hutchinson (1638) took on
the leaders of the Bay Colony. She actually may have been more spiritual than the leaders
were, because she felt she had a direct revelation from God that if predestination were true,
94
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

everybody had a duty to follow his or her own conscience. Leaders banished her from the
colony for challenging their religious authority; she happily left with her whole family. Roger
Williams (1635) was another purifying spirit. He said the Congregationalists (a more modern
name for the church that started with the Puritans) should make a complete break from the
corrupt Church of England, treat the American Indians fairly, and not try to legislate religious
behavior. Hounded out of Massachusetts, he helped found the new colony of Rhode Island
(discussed later in this chapter) to protect freedom of thought and expression.
Question: Why did Anne Hutchinson get in trouble with the leaders of the Bay Colony?
Answer: She challenged their religious authority.
Freethinking Rhode Island
Helped by sympathetic American Indians, Roger Williams fled to what would become the
colony of Rhode Island (1636) in the midst of a bitterly cold winter. He built the first Baptist
church in America and established complete religious freedom of thought, even for Catholics
and the Jewish. Nobody had to believe a fixed creed; no one had to go to church or pay taxes
to support a state religion. These freedoms sound normal now, but they were rare at the time.
Rhode Island also started with universal male suffrage; any man could vote. This right was
limited later, but from the start, Rhode Island was a progressive beacon in an already-
freedom-loving country. The colony grew with people who didn’t fit in other locations,
including Anne Hutchinson and her family. Critics from other colonies called it Rogues’
Island. Originally highly unofficial, Rhode Island somehow managed to win a charter from
Parliament in 1644; a statue of the Independent Man tops its statehouse.
Connecticut comes to order
The Connecticut River valley is one of the few really fertile spots in New England. A mass
migration of Puritans from Boston settled near the river, and some Dutch and English immi-
grants followed. In an open meeting, the new colony drafted the Fundamental Orders (1639),
the beginning of a modern constitution. So-called substantial citizens were to democratically
control the new government. The Connecticut colony was soon joined by another attempt at
godly government in New Haven. Together, these colonies mark the small beginning of the
migration of American settlers to the west.
95
Chapter 8: Sailing to a New Home: 1492–1690
Puritans versus Pilgrims: Telling them apart
To remember the difference between Puritans and
Pilgrims, just remember that Puritans wanted to purify
the Church of England from within. Pilgrims thought they
had to be grim Separatists and leave the established
church on a long pilgrimage to find a godly place to live.
Puritans believed (rather like modern fundamentalists)
that the whole purpose of government was to enforce
God’s laws. Still, they cut some slack. Congregations
hired and fired their own ministers; thus, they could have
local control over what the church was saying. Contrary
to what people think now, the Puritans were actually
heavily into food, drink, songs, and married love. A
“Protestant ethic” supported willpower and hard work,
but after the responsibilities were taken care of, nothing
was wrong with having fun. Because they never had to
answer to any central dogma, the Congregationalists
eventually evolved into the most liberal Protestant
denomination.

Dutch treat in New York and New Jersey
The practical Dutch actually got where everybody else thought they were heading: to the
East Indies. For 300 years, the Dutch had a profitable colony far from home. Casting their
eyes across the Atlantic, they sent Henry Hudson (1609) exploring up the great Hudson River
and eventually into Hudson Bay. While he was starting up what would later be called the
Hudson River, his navigator wrote down the American Indian name for an extended island
they passed. The American Indians called it “island of many hills,” or Manhattan. Later, the
Dutch thought they’d made a great deal when they bought the island from the American
Indians for a chest full of flashy trinkets. However, the American Indians had the last laugh.
They didn’t really own Manhattan; they’d just stopped by to fish.
New Amsterdam (1623), the Dutch city that would become New York City, wasn’t a beacon of
liberty. The Dutch ran business for a profit and had no real interest in religious tolerance,
free speech, or voting in the colony they called New Netherland. The Dutch had trouble with
American Indian attacks in New Amsterdam, so they built a high wall. The street that ran
along that wall is called Wall Street. The uptown country on Manhattan reminded them of a
place in Holland, so they named it Harlem. They had to boot out a small Swedish settlement
(1655) on the Delaware River, but then the Dutch themselves were booted when the English
came, first as settlers and then in warships. 
In 1664, the surrounded and already-profitable Dutch peacefully surrendered New Netherland
to the English, who renamed it New York after an island off the British coast. Ownership of
New Jersey came along with New York when the English took over from the Dutch. The large
landholding tradition of New York state discouraged heavy settlement of the inland area
during the early colonial period. Upstate New York was still a frontier when the Revolution
came.
Question: Why did the Dutch found New Netherland?
Answer: The Dutch had commercial and mercantile goals: They wanted to make money.
Quaking in Pennsylvania and Delaware
After the Catholics lost control of England, the religious cat was out of the bag. Among the
many sincere groups that tried to discern the word of God were the Quakers. They called
themselves the Religious Society of Friends, but everybody else called them Quakers because
they allegedly became so full of the Holy Spirit that they quaked. They had no mandatory
beliefs and no preachers; Quakers took turns speaking in their Sunday meetings when the
spirit moved them. They refused to fight or join the military and tried to live peaceful lives.
This Christian behavior made everybody hate them. William Penn was a serious-minded
English boy from a family with money. He decided to become a Quaker and worked to get a
colony where Quakers could live in peace. Amazingly enough, King Charles II owed Penn’s
father some money, so he gave William a choice piece of land that the king called Pennsylvania
(1681). Penn tried to change the name because it sounded too egotistical but eventually set-
tled down to attract good settlers. He carefully laid out Philadelphia, “the city of brotherly
love,” which quickly became the largest and most beautiful city in the colonies.
The Quakers treated the American Indians so fairly that some tribes from the South tried to
move to the colony. Unfortunately, Pennsylvania had only a minority of Quakers, so trouble
soon began. The government was fair, with freedom of religion, no church tax, and a repre-
sentative legislature elected by all male landowners. The death penalty was levied only for
treason or murder; by comparison, more than 200 offenses could result in beheading in
96
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

England at the time. Within 19 years of its founding, Pennsylvania was the third-richest
colony in British America. After the English ousted the Dutch from New York, the future
Delaware became the Lower Counties of Pennsylvania and got to be an independent area in
time to be the first state to ratify the Constitution after the Revolution.
Merry Maryland
The rich English Catholic Lord Baltimore founded Maryland (1634), conveniently located up
the Chesapeake Bay from Virginia. He hoped to make a profit and provide a haven for his
fellow Catholics, who were still heavily discriminated against in England. He was thinking of
vast feudal estates, but colonists didn’t want to come unless they personally got to own
some land. Tobacco was growing before long. To work the fields, the Maryland settlers
imported indentured servants, generally poor white Englishmen who agreed to work for 4 to
7 years for free in exchange to a ticket to the New World. In the early days, three of every
four English immigrants to the Chesapeake Bay came as indentured servants.
Sadly, only 40 percent of the indentured servants lived to win their freedom; the early death
rate from disease was that high. As indentured servants died out in the late 1600s, Maryland
began to import larger numbers of slaves. Even with servants working and slaves on the way,
Maryland managed to make a stand for freedom with the adoption of the Act of Toleration
(1649). The act guaranteed freedom of religion to everyone, Catholic or Protestant, as long as
they believed in Jesus. Tough luck if you were Buddhist or Jewish, though; the act threatened
nonbelievers in Jesus with death.
Smokin’ Virginia
When he wasn’t bankrolling failed colonies, Sir Walter Raleigh liked to smoke a pipe. Back
then, people called it drinking tobacco, but by any name, the habit has always been hard to
quit. Smoking really took off in England after John Rolfe, the husband of Pocahontas, figured
out a way to grow smoother-tasting tobacco in the Jamestown colony. He made so much
money that pretty soon people were planting tobacco in their front yards and even in the
street. As the market for the “bewitching weed” grew, colonists pushed for more land to grow
it on. With more land, they needed more labor: Virginia finally had an economic hit.
Just in time, a ship appeared off Jamestown and sold a cargo of 20 Africans to work for
hungry Virginia planters. It was still a year before the Pilgrims came to New England seeking
freedom. In the same year the slave ship arrived, London authorized the House of Burgesses
(1619) in Virginia to be the first representative government in the New World. America was
already on a two-track system.
Carolina, North and South
The colony of Carolina officially adopted a version of the Barbados slave code in 1696.
Carolina (1670) was the third middle colony in a row named in honor of the then-current
English ruler: Charles II had replaced Charles I, who lost his head. The colony served as a
supply station for the hugely profitable sugar plantations of the West Indies. Carolina even
tried its hand at supplying slaves. Over the objections of its London proprietors, the colony
shipped as many as 10,000 American Indians to the cane fields of the sugar islands. Carolina
learned to grow rice with the help of West African slaves; by 1710, the colony had more
Africans than whites.
97
Chapter 8: Sailing to a New Home: 1492–1690

Carolina divided into North and South in 1691. North Carolina people were small farmers
who often just claimed land, built a cabin, and planted a few crops. They were rugged indi-
vidualists, hiding out between the landed aristocracies of Virginia and South Carolina. The
North Carolina folks were even accused of harboring pirates along stormy Cape Hatteras, the
“graveyard of the Atlantic.” When the local Tuscaroras attacked a North Carolina town, the
settlers fought a bloody war and ended up selling hundreds of the American Indians into
slavery. The survivors traveled north looking for protection and became the sixth tribe in the
Iroquois Confederacy.
Reforming Georgia
Georgia (1733) was the last of the original 13 colonies and the only one founded in the 1700s.
Named for the foppish King George II (new king, new colony name), Georgia was a buffer
against the Spanish in Florida and the French in Louisiana. The colony had as a founder
James Oglethorpe, a fair-minded reformer who used his own money to develop a land that
would let debtors get a new start. Oglethorpe helped design the beautiful city of Savannah,
banned slavery, and fought off Spanish attacks. He invited reformers to visit, including the
young John Wesley, who would go on to found the Methodist Church. Over his objections
after he left the colony, Georgia allowed slavery in 1750. Oglethorpe lived long enough to be a
friend of the American Revolution in England.
Early Challenges to the New Colonies
The early days of the colonies were far from smooth sailing. Settlers had problems with
American Indians, autocratic English government, diseases, slavery, the economy, and even
witchcraft. The following sections summarize topics that may come up on the AP exam.
American Indian troubles
American Indians resented being driven off their land, and they fought back from time to
time with vicious attacks. Shortly before the Pilgrims arrived, an epidemic swept through 
the New England coastal tribes and wiped out three-quarters of the native people. With no
strength to repel even the weak Pilgrim settlement, the local American Indians were friendly.
Squanto (1620), who had been kidnapped by an English ship’s captain years before, greeted
the Pilgrims in perfect English and helped them through to the first Thanksgiving.
As the settlers pushed the American Indians off their land over the next 50 years, the son of
the chief who had welcomed the Pilgrims lost his patience. The settlers called him King
Philip because they couldn’t be bothered to learn his American Indian name, Metacom.
Backed by an alliance of fed-up American Indians, he launched King Philip’s War (1675). By
the time the war ended a year later, his forces had attacked 52 towns and destroyed 12. One
out of ten settlers of military age was a casualty; women and children were carried off by
American Indians. Even Plymouth itself, site of the Pilgrims’ landing, fell victim. 
Bacon’s Rebellion of 1675 had tied down the Virginia government, the only other significant
English presence in North America. Canada was still mostly French and rooting for the
American Indians. The New England colonies had to defend themselves on their own.
In the end, the settlers fought together through the New England Confederation (1643) and
held on. In the south, the first capital of Virginia, Jamestown, was burned in 1676, but the
government eventually regained control. Although nightmare fears of Indian attacks lasted
98
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

for years, actual Indian power in New England ended with the death of Metacom. For the first
time, settlers in separate colonies began to think of themselves as Americans.
Locals get together; England cracks the whip
The first colonial union was the New England Confederation (1643), a partnership of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony, Plymouth, and two Connecticut colonies for mutual defense and
problem solving. The colonists were proud of that.
Years later, the royal government in London imposed a very different Dominion of New
England (1686). The head of the new dominion was Sir Edmund Andros. His job was to
enforce the law, especially the Navigation Act (1660), which made it illegal to send anything
to the colonies that hadn’t first passed through and been taxed by England. This Navigation
Act and the later Molasses Act of 1733 supported a policy of mercantilism that forced colonies
to buy and sell with their mother country so that the mother country could make a profit off
the colonies.
Question: What did the Navigation Acts (1660) and the Molasses Act (1733) support?
Answer: These acts furthered the policy of mercantilism.
The colonists hated Sir Edmund, and he responded by closing down meetings, schools, the
courts, and the press, and revoking land titles. He issued taxes without consulting the local
assemblies. The colonists were on the verge of revolt. Fortunately, the English did the revolt-
ing for them. In the Glorious Revolution (1689), they dethroned the unpopular James II and
brought on the mellower William and Mary. Sir Edmund was caught trying to sneak out of
town dressed as a woman; the boots sticking out from under his dress gave him away. He
was booted back to England.
Disease and money
The Chesapeake area was a money-maker but not a very healthy place to be. The colony his-
tory earlier in this chapter discusses the short life of indentured servants; that short life
went for everybody in early Virginia and Maryland. Half the people born in the early years
didn’t live to see their 20th birthdays. Few of those who lived past 20 made it to 50, and
women were lucky to see 40. Most marriages ended in the death of a partner within 7 years.
Without many parents or any grandparents for moral guidance, more than one third of girls
were pregnant when they got married.
Meanwhile, the money kept rolling in to those who survived to spend it. The Chesapeake 
Bay already shipped 1.5 million pounds of tobacco a year in the 1630s; by 1700, the colony
shipped 40 million pounds a year. Both Virginia and Maryland employed the headright system
(1670) to encourage the importation of servant workers. Whoever paid to bring in a servant
received the right to 50 acres of land. Hungry for land and labor, big planters brought some
100,000 indentured servants into the region by 1700; most of those servants didn’t live long
enough to serve out their contracts. In all, these indentured servants represented three quar-
ters of all newcomers to the region in the 1600s.
Early rebellions
Leisler’s Rebellion (1689) was an uprising in colonial New York City in which militia captain
Jacob Leisler seized control of lower New York from 1689 to 1691. The uprising, which
99
Chapter 8: Sailing to a New Home: 1492–1690

occurred in the midst of Britain’s Glorious Revolution, reflected colonial resentment of the
policies of King James II. British troops sent by James’ mellower successor William III
restored royal authority in 1691.
Virginia’s governor, William Berkeley, had a good thing going. To keep his profitable fur-trade
monopoly with the American Indians flowing smoothly, he looked the other way when
American Indians killed settlers on the frontier. In Bacon’s Rebellion (1676), a group of about
1,000 planters took on the American Indians; they then drove Berkeley from his capital at
Jamestown and burned the place. After Bacon died of all-too-prevalent natural causes, Berkeley
defeated the rebellion and hanged the surviving leaders. This small rebellion sent a wake-up
call to the big planters; they needed to find workers who lived longer and couldn’t fight back.
The answer was slaves.
Slaves in the land of the free, Part I
Only about 5 percent of the 8 million human beings stolen from Africa to be enslaved in the
New World during the 1600s and 1700s went to the colonies or their successor, the United
States. One-third of the slaves went to Brazil; most of the rest worked the sugar plantations
of the Caribbean.
As late as 1670, slaves made up less than 10 percent of the population of Southern planta-
tions. That started to change in a big way as indentured servants died off. By 1750, half the
population of Virginia was African. Many slaves in the Deep South died from hard work in the
rice and indigo fields (cotton came a century later) and had to be replaced with new imports.
In the Chesapeake Bay, the very place that killed so many white indentured servants, slaves
lived much longer. By the mid-1700s, the slave population of this area was capable of sustain-
ing itself without the new importation of human beings.
Slaves brought more than just labor to the New World. Without call-and-response singing, the
rhythmic ringshout dance, hand drums, and the banjo, all of which came from Africa,
America may still be doing the minuet. Long live rock-and-roll!
Slaves fought back when they could. A revolt in New York City in 1712 cost the lives of a
dozen whites and 21 Africans. The Stono Revolt (1739) saw 50 self-liberated slaves marching
toward Florida to be free, only to be stopped by the militia.
New England living
In contrast to the middle Southern states, New England added 10 years to the average life
span of new settlers. The first generation of Puritan colonists lived an average of 70 years —
pretty close to a modern life span. Because of this unprecedented longevity, some say New
England invented grandparents, who were still around to play with the kids. Family morality
is reflected in the low premarital pregnancy rate, again in stark contrast to the experience in
the South. Massachusetts started the first college, Harvard, in 1636, just 8 years after the
colony’s founding. It took Virginia 83 years after staking out Jamestown to get around to
starting the College of William and Mary in 1693.
Witches and religion
With all this goodness came a little New England fanaticism. The Puritan light burned bright,
but it also could be blinding. After about 40 years of accepting only the select, Puritan
100
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

churches had to offer a Half-Way Covenant (1662), which opened church attendance to
people who couldn’t prove they were among God’s elect. As time went on, the doors of the
churches opened wider, perhaps sometimes even admitting sinners.
At about this time, a new type of sermon began to appear — something that speakers called
a jeremiad after the always-scolding Old Testament prophet Jeremiah. Preachers thundered
about the wrath of God and the hellfire that awaits the sinner, just as though sinners walked
among the elect. This kind of angry shouting soon showed its ugly face in the town of Salem,
north of Boston.
A group of teenage girls, under the influence of voodoo talk by a West Indian slave, claimed
to have been bewitched by certain older women in the town. This claim triggered a hysteri-
cal witch hunt that led to the legal murders of 20 people. Most of the victims were hanged,
but one was pressed to death under a huge rock. The girls claimed they could see devils in
the courtroom ceiling, and Puritan judges believed them.
The Salem Witch Trials (1692) helped save other people by introducing the pejorative term
witch hunt into the language. When ordinary people say that the government is going on a
witch hunt, they unconsciously refer to a hard time in colonial America.

F
rom shaky settlements clinging to the edge of a wild continent, the 13 colonies grew to
become prosperous and increasingly feisty. Surviving colonial wars with the French and
their American Indian allies gave colonists confidence. Making a good living by farming, build-
ing ships and trading showed the early residents of British North America that they could 
take care of themselves. Life was good, and as the new country grew, so did the population’s
strength in numbers: More than five times as many people lived in the colonies in the 1770s 
as had made their homes there in the 1690s. People began to feel like acting independent.
Stirring the Melting Pot: Population Expansion
The early colonies of New England included Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and
New Hampshire and were mostly into fishing and small family farming. The early Southern
colonies of Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia made
their money on large plantations growing rice and tobacco. The Middle colonies of New York,
Pennsylvania, and New Jersey were actually in the middle, with medium-sized farms growing
medium-sized crops of grain and raising cattle.
During the years between 1691 and 1775, the American colonies grew like rabbits, thanks
mostly to immigration. In 1700, the 13 original colonies had only 250,000 people. Just 50
years later, the population had quintupled to 1.25 million. The colonists had plenty of chil-
dren, but America also attracted immigrants by the thousands. Irish, Scots, and Germans
came to join the party, along with 200,000 slaves from Africa. Canada was the biggest British
colony, and Jamaica was the richest, but the 13 colonies were the most popular places to
settle because their good land grew rich crops. The colonies were 90 percent farms; the 
population of New York City in 1700 was all of 5,000 people.
Another 5 percent of the settlers were Europeans, such as Swedes, Dutch, Irish, Welsh, and
Scots. None of these non-English people felt any great love for their English rulers. The
colonies were the most multicultural country in the world, especially the ethnically rich
Middle colonies of Pennsylvania and New York. Beyond the fittingly named New England, 
half the people of the colonies weren’t from England — about a third of the signers of the
Declaration of Independence originated from the world beyond England. In the following sec-
tions, I cover the most prominent groups to move to the American colonies during this time.

104
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 
England, Britain, the United Kingdom . . . how many names can a little-but-mighty island
have? Don’t get all confused; here’s what you need to know. England is the biggest part of the
island called Britain, which is about the size of California and a few miles off the west coast 
of Europe. Great Britain evolved politically from the gradual union of England and Scotland,
which started in 1603 with the Union of Crowns and slid into the Acts of Union in 1707, when
the parliaments of the two nations merged into the Kingdom of Great Britain. Over time, the
kingdom added Wales and Northern Ireland, and decided that the name United Kingdom
sounded classy. After 1700, the mother country of the colonists can be referred to by either
the more inclusive Britain or by its original name, England.
The Scotch-Irish
Perhaps the most aggressive immigrants to search the frontier for farms to settle were the
Scotch-Irish. The United States has had 12 presidents with a Scotch-Irish background. These
English-speaking people were originally from the Scottish lowlands. (Ay, Scotland isn’t all
highlands.) The only thing high about the lowlands was the land rents charged by greedy
Scottish lords. Many of the Scotch-Irish moved to Northern Ireland, where their Protestant
ancestors still make up the majority of the population. Some kept going to America.
With little money, the Scotch-Irish kept traveling until they found cheap land on the frontiers
of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Maryland. Having been pushed around plenty themselves, they
tended to solve potential American Indian problems by shooting first and asking questions
later. By 1750, the Scotch-Irish had spread out along the Great Wagon Road, a path for immi-
gration they helped build through mountain passes from Philadelphia to Georgia. By the
Revolution, they represented 7 percent of the population of the colonies.
Having moved more than once, the Scotch-Irish didn’t originally build to stay. They threw 
up rough log cabins, chopped down trees, and planted crops between the stumps. As they
gained title to their lands and confidence that no lords would boot them off, the Scotch-Irish
built Presbyterian churches.
The rough-and-tumble Scotch-Irish caused heartache for the original Quaker settlers of
Pennsylvania (see Chapter 8) when they killed peaceful American Indians and led the Paxton
Boys’ (1764) march on Philadelphia to protest lenient treatment of the natives. The Paxton
Boys wanted to punish American Indians in general, regardless of whether they’d actually
done wrong; luckily, Ben Franklin and the Philadelphia militia stood up to the Paxton Boys
and protected the friendly American Indians. The Scotch-Irish also shook things up with the
Regulators’ Uprising (1764) against aristocratic domination of their rural settlements in North
Carolina. Many of the Regulator hotheads, including a young Andrew Jackson, later joined
the move toward revolution.
Germans
Germans were the largest non-English-speaking immigrant group in the colonies. Faced with
war and oppression in their homeland, they were delighted to find out about the rich soil 
of Pennsylvania. They built sturdy homes and barns, some of which still function today.
German Americans eventually became one third of the population of the Quaker State
(Pennsylvania); some neighborhoods in Philadelphia had German street signs. German
Americans brought the Lutheran religion, adding to the Protestant mix of religious toleration.
By the time of the Revolution, German Americans were about 6 percent of the population of
the colonies.

The Pennsylvania Dutch are so called because English-speaking Americans got confused by
Deutsch, the German name for German.
French Canada had about 1 person for every 20 in the 13 colonies, but it helped form what
would become the United States. La Salle (1682) was a French explorer who navigated down
the Mississippi, establishing French claims to the Louisiana territory that the French govern-
ment would eventually sell to the young U.S. French courers de bois (runners of the woods),
who ranged over North America trading animal pelts with the American Indians. French
Acadians resettled by the British from Canada would become the Cajuns of New Orleans. 
The French founded Detroit, New Orleans, Pittsburgh, and other towns; if more of them had
come, maybe U.S. drive-throughs would serve French cuisine. French settler Crèvecoeur
observed in his Letters from an American Farmer (1782) that the “strange mixture of blood,
which you find in no other country” was an “American, this new man.”
Africans and the ongoing issue of slavery
Africans made up 20 percent of the population by the Revolution, mostly in the South but
also with at least a few representatives in all the other early colonies. Slaves worked all their
lives with no pay, and their children automatically became slaves too. Slavery grew because
slaves made money for their masters, who then had more political and social power.
When they could get together at the end of long workdays, slaves created their own
American African culture different from anything in Africa. Africans were brought to America
as slaves, but when they could, they fought for their freedom. Slaves revolted in New York in
1712 and 1741; during the Stono Rebellion (1739) in South Carolina, slaves under a flag of free-
dom fought a pitched battle with white slaveholders. This led slave owners to tighten the
rules so that slaves found it hard to get together or even learn to read. Slaves who revolted
were tortured and/or killed.
Question: Where was slavery legal in the colonies?
Answer: Slavery was legal in all British North American colonies in the 1700s.
Question: What did slaves do besides hard work?
Answer: Slaves in early America maintained African social customs and even created 
a hybrid African American culture.
Question: Why did slavery grow in the colonies?
Answer: Slaves made money for their owners, which increased the owners’ social and 
political power.
Question: How did owners’ power over slaves change in the colonies?
Answer: In the 1700s, slave laws became more repressive and owners expanded their 
legal power over slaves.
Question: Name some slave rebellions that occurred in the colonies.
Answer: The Stono Rebellion (1739) in South Carolina and the New York slave conflicts 
(1712 and 1741) are examples of slave rebellions.

Daily Life in the Colonies
Colonial Americans lived in drafty houses heated in the winter by fireplaces in one or two
rooms. Bedrooms, churches, and schools had no heat, air conditioning, or even fans. The
bathroom was an outhouse 20 feet out the back door, and baths, when they happened, meant
boiling a lot of water and pouring it into a tin tub. Garbage disposal meant tossing garbage out
the window, where it was taken care of by hogs or buzzards. Light at night may be a flickering
whale-oil lamp, and everybody had to ask whether what they were doing instead of going to
bed was worth the candle. Going to bed early was easy, because most people were tired from
a workday that ran from first light until sundown, when they couldn’t see anymore.
Entertainment meant getting together with a good excuse like a militia muster, when citizen
soldiers drilled and partied, or a barn-raising, quilting bee, funeral, or wedding. All these
events could be accompanied by a good deal of drinking and flirting. Northerners liked sleigh
rides and skating; Southerners went for fox hunts and playing cards. Southerners thought that
plays and dancing were just fine; Northerners took a few years to warm up to those ideas.
The Middle states were, as usual, in the middle when it came to entertainment. Not much fox
hunting happened, but plays and dancing were okay with most people. Everybody played the
lottery. Lotteries were used to fund churches, hospitals, and colleges like Harvard.
Having a Chance at Success and Education
Unless you were one of the growing number of slaves, America in the 1700s was the place to
be. Most people were farmers, but more jobs were always available in towns for skilled
craftsmen. Even if you were an indentured servant, you could potentially earn your freedom
and rise to prominence, which is what two originally indentured signers of the Declaration of
Independence did. George Walton was only 26 when he risked hanging by the British to sign
the Declaration; he was an orphan who had been indentured to a builder. George Taylor had
to indenture himself to earn his ticket from Ireland, but as an old guy of 60, was important
enough to sign the Declaration.
Although everyone had a chance for success, the number of rich people (who earned far
more than the average farmer) grew with time and opportunity. Between the late 1600s and
the Revolution in 1776, the colonies seemed to be dragged into one European war after
another.
Wars burn up lots of military supplies, so the merchants in the big cities made big money 
by supplying the troops. By 1750, the richest 10 percent of the people in Boston and
Philadelphia owned more than half of the property. They got reserved seats in the churches
and schools.
Poverty: Not as bad as in Britain, but bad enough
A few poor people in the cities were supported by charity and sometimes had to wear a large
red P on their clothes. Still, poverty in the colonies was nothing like it was in Britain in the
1700s, where as many as one out of three people lived with next to nothing. The colonies
were rife with land that could be farmed and opportunities in trade and skilled jobs. The idea
that anybody had a chance to make a good life in America started in the early 1700s. It was
true; by the time of the Revolution, the early states had, overall, the most prosperous people
in the world.

The government in London tried to drop its problems on the colonies by sending over 50,000
convicts. These convicts included real hard cases as well as plenty of people who received
harsh sentences for little more than stealing a loaf of bread. Some of them became upright
citizens in the New World, but they had no love for their British persecutors.
The worst poverty was within the growing slave population. White people were afraid of
slave violence like the Stono Rebellion in 1739 and made periodic attempts to limit the
importation of more slaves, but British leaders vetoed these attempts. Thomas Jefferson
tried to put language opposed to slavery in the Declaration of Independence, but he was
overridden by Southern slaveholders (see Chapter 10).
Education and vocations
Most people were farmers, but colonists learned technical skills on the job. This didn’t
always mean you had to be an indentured servant to gain a skill; Ben Franklin (the youngest
boy of 16 children) learned to be a printer by working for his brother.
In England, education was viewed as being a privilege of the elite, not as a basic right for
everyone. Things were different in New England, where public elementary schools supported
by towns and counties started in the 1600s. In the Middle colonies, schools were sometimes
free and sometimes private for-pay institutions. In the South, where distances between plan-
tations could be large, families tended to rely on private tutors.
Early Puritan religion taught that everyone should be able to read the Bible. Students went to
school when they could spare time away from their chores on the family farm. In all schools,
whipping was the rule. Students memorized Latin and Greek, and didn’t talk back to their
teachers for fear of being whipped.
Christian ministers were the most respected professionals in the colonies. Harvard, Yale,
Princeton, Brown, and almost all the other original colleges were established to train minis-
ters. Lawyers weren’t universally loved in the pioneer societies; some colonies even passed
laws against them. Some early settlers even thought that lawyers made disputes get worse
just so they could make money from them. Physicians learned their trade from hanging
around other doctors in the early days; the first medical school in the colonies wasn’t
founded until 1765. Making patients bleed deliberately was a favorite form of treatment, and
epidemics were common.
Smallpox affected one in five people; George Washington was a heavily pockmarked survivor
of the disease. The first crude inoculation for smallpox was given in 1721.
An epidemic of diphtheria in the 1730s took thousands of lives and helped scare people into
the First Great Awakening, which I cover in “Changing Attitudes toward Religion” later in this
chapter.
Establishing American Arts
The 1700s brought more than just independence to the colonies; during this period,
American art, architecture, and writing took off. The following sections describe the cultural
flourish of this era.

108
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 
American painters
Fine-arts painters got their start in America during the 1700s. At first, colonial artists focused
on portraits — settlers wanted to be remembered, and cameras weren’t an option. Benjamin
West was the first American artist to train in Europe; when he saw a statue of Apollo, he real-
ized it was no more handsome than an American Indian warrior. You can check out early
American art at www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/American-artists-17th-18th.
html and www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/amer.shtm; the following are a few
prominent painters of early America:
 John Trumbull (1785) painted pictures of the American Revolution, in which he served
briefly.
 Charles Willson Peale (1780) served in the Revolution too, painting all the while. Peale
could accurately be described as a Renaissance man, having developed a level of
expertise in such diverse fields as carpentry, dentistry, optometry, shoemaking, and
taxidermy.
 Benjamin West (1770) painted large-scale historic pictures. He said that when he was
young, American Indians showed him how to make paint by mixing clay from the river-
bank with bear grease in a pot.
Architecture
Early American architecture styles were imported from Europe; even the log cabin appears
to be based on a Swedish model. Nobody lived in log cabins in most of Europe; the idea came
from the northern Swedes during their short-lived colony in America.
The popular Georgian architecture (1750) was named after the Georges who were kings of
England around that time. Georgian style usually is defined by reddish brick walls that con-
trast with the white used for window trimming and cornices. A small porch often emphasizes
the entrance. Regularity was a term of praise for Georgian architects, who used mathematical
formulas to figure the proportion of windows to wall size. Georgian is the architecture of
Williamsburg, Harvard, and many colonial buildings.
Literature, libraries, and the birth of American journalism
Colonial literature was very much in the shadow of the mother country; for years, many
Americans assumed that only the English had the sophistication to write. This assumption
began to change with the prejudice-shattering poetry of Phillis Wheatley (1772), a slave who
had learned to write. Her memorial poem for George Whitefield (see “Changing Attitudes
toward Religion” later in this chapter) caused such a stir that John Hancock and others
examined her to make sure a black person could actually write such a work.
Benjamin Franklin (1776) would be remembered even if he weren’t a famous Revolutionary
War leader. His Poor Richard’s Almanack, which he edited beginning 45 years before the
Revolution, contained gems of thought quoted throughout the colonies. Among them is his
reaction to the Great Awakening: “Serving God is doing good to man, but praying is thought
an easier service, and therefore more generally chosen.” Franklin proved that lightning was
electricity and invented bifocal glasses, the efficient Franklin stove, and the lightning rod. He
also started the first privately supported library in the country.
By the Revolution, around 40 simple newspapers were published in the colonies. Most of
these papers were one-page weeklies, but they begin to reflect and mold public opinion. Peter
Zenger (1734) was a New York newspaper printer who attacked the corrupt royal governor.
He was hauled into court and charged with libel. The government didn’t deny the truth of
what he said but planned to throw him in prison anyway. In a landmark day for freedom of
the press, the jury set Zenger free. Ever since, newspapers have had the right to publish the
truth even if it upsets the government.

Changing Attitudes toward Religion
The problem with all the education that ministers received in the American colonies (see
“Education and vocations” earlier in this chapter) is that they got so smart that they started
to question what their own churches believed. The gloomy predestination doctrine got harder
to support; fewer and fewer people went along with the idea that nothing they could do in life
would alter God’s prebirth judgment about whether they were going to heaven or hell. The
Puritans’ (see Chapter 8) original belief that predestination meant only a small group of people
preselected by God for salvation should get to be in their church didn’t leave a lot of room for
free will or more church members. They tried the Half-Way Covenant (1662) to let in a few new
members who couldn’t swear they’d undergone a conversion experience, but the churches
were losing their power over a people busy making a living in the early 1700s.
The Great Awakening was a spiritual revival complete with preaching and conversions all
over the colonies. Awakening was so important that it actually happened at least twice. The
First Great Awakening (1734) began when the colonies were becoming well established in the
1730s; the Second Great Awakening occurred in the 1820s. First Great Awakening ministers
were set up for their success by the toil, loneliness, and heartbreak of life on the frontier. The
movement had more power in the country than in the cities, but America was practically all
country in the early 1700s. Great Awakening preachers left in their wake a spiritually charged
citizenship eager for change. By traveling throughout the colonies, they gave the separate
sections a sense of belonging to a whole nation. The Great Awakening set the emotional stage
for the American Revolution. Two men in particular were very influential in this movement:
 The First Great Awakening began with Jonathan Edwards (1734), a well-educated theolo-
gian and Congregationalist minister from Massachusetts. Edwards came from Puritan
roots but spoke with the power of immediate, personal religious experience. His fiery
sermons, including “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,” attracted a large following.
 Methodist preacher George Whitefield (1738) was even more electric than Edwards.
Whitefield traveled across the colonies and spoke in the dramatic, emotional style of a
modern revival preacher, often in outdoor camp meetings. He was the first nationwide
American star, accepting everyone into his audiences and preaching a simple message
of the power of God. He gave more than 18,000 sermons. Whitefield was the most
widely recognized public figure in America before George Washington.
Edwards, Whitefield, and others who used a similar style started a new trend in American
religion. Previously, so-called Old Light ministers droned on in their sermons, using only
rationality and arguments from theology. Modern New Light preachers spoke with emotion
and showmanship. Princeton, Brown, Rutgers, and Dartmouth were all New Light schools.
On the more open end of spirituality, the Quakers (see Chapter 8) believed God was so close
to love that everyone should be free to worship him in the way that was best for them.
Quakers supported women’s rights and freedom of worship. They opposed slavery and war,
but they did pay taxes and worked to influence local governments. Although some Quakers
were actually put to death in New England for their tolerant beliefs, more worked to build a
peaceful society in Pennsylvania, the colony established by Quaker William Penn.
As freedom in the colonies grew, so did tolerance for neighbors who may have a different
way of worshiping God. The colonies in the 1750s represented many religious denomina-
tions, generally liked the king, opposed aristocrats from England, and were open to settle-
ment by non-English people.

Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 
Question: Who were the biggest followers of the First Great Awakening?
Answer: The First Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1740s appealed more to poor and 
rural people and less to rich urbanites.
Question: What did the Quakers believe?
Answer: Quakers were against war and slavery; they paid taxes, tried to influence local 
governments, and supported women’s rights and freedom of worship.
Question: Was Quakerism the official religion of Quaker Pennsylvania?
Answer: Because it was founded by Quakers, who believed in freedom of worship, colonial 
Pennsylvania had no established official church.
Question: What was the political and social atmosphere of the colonies by the 1750s?
Answer: In general, the colonies in the 1750s represented many religious denominations, 
disliked aristocrats from England but were okay with the king, and were receptive to 
settlement by non-English people.
Early Politics
Three colonies had governors appointed by their official proprietors, and two colonies
elected their own governors. In the other eight colonies, the king appointed usually compe-
tent governors (not counting the dunderhead governor Peter Zenger exposed in New York —
see “Literature, libraries, and the birth of American journalism” earlier in this chapter). The
colonies had two legislative bodies like the modern U.S. Senate and House of Representatives
(see Chapter 10). The Senate-type legislators usually were appointed, and the House-type
representatives were elected by all the people who had the right to vote.
Property wasn’t too expensive in a land with miles of open space, so getting the right to vote
wasn’t hard. The House, elected by the people, had some major power over the governor; it
controlled his salary. The colonies had the most democratic government known in the world
up to that time.
Making Money in Colonial America
Due in large part to the plentiful goods they produced and traded, the colonies also provided
the highest average standard of living people had ever seen. Here’s a list of the most prof-
itable goods of the period:
 The Middle colonies produced enough wheat to make all the bread the colonists could
eat and still export thousands of barrels of flour.
 Tobacco was a big money-maker for Virginia and Maryland. Taxes on tobacco made up
one third of U.S. government revenue until long after the Civil War.
 It seemed as though the supply of codfish off the coast of New England would never
run out, and boatloads were exported to Europe. Although cod is no longer as plentiful,
the fish was so important to the growth of New England that a “Sacred Cod” still hangs
in the Massachusetts House of Representatives.

 New England fishing led to shipbuilding and provided training for thousands of Yankee
sailors to man American ships. With a plentiful lumber supply, by the time of the
Revolution, the colonies were building a third of all the ships in the British trading fleet.
 North America had a lock on beaver pelts, and anyone who was cool in Europe just had
to have some beaver fur.
 Making cloth at home, American women outfitted their families for free and often had
extra linen to sell.
 Before the Revolution, America had more small iron forges than England did. One
famous place — Valley Forge, Pennsylvania — was even named for its iron works.
 The United States was (and is still) the world’s leading wheat exporter.
The triangular trade
From the earliest days, rum and other forms of alcohol had an enthusiastic following in the
New World. Early Americans could drink most modern people under the table. The infamous
triangular trade was the shipping of New England rum to Africa in exchange for slaves, who
were sold in the West Indies for money and molasses, which was taken back to New England
to make more rum. This three-legged voyage was hugely profitable but made up only a
minority of New England trade. Most Yankee traders exchanged food and lumber for manu-
factured goods, which they sold in the colonies
Mercantilism
Early Americans couldn’t have been all that drunk from the rum trade, because the colonies
managed to make more money per person on average than anyplace else in the world. Long
before they knew it, the colonies were on a collision course with the interests of their mother
country due to England’s policy of mercantilism. Under this policy, the colonies were sup-
posed to supply England raw materials and buy expensive manufactured stuff only from the
mother country. If the colonists wanted to sell anything to another country, the trade was
supposed to go through England. England controlled trade, got the markups, and treated the
colonists like cows. After the colonists got it together, they weren’t about to let this practice
keep happening.
Dealing (or not dealing) with trade tension
America was growing fast; Britain was growing slowly. Pretty soon, the British had all the
American food and other stuff they needed, and Americans wanted European finery that
Britain didn’t produce. Yankee businessmen wanted to trade with other countries, especially
the rich French West Indies. This situation produced the beginning of trade tension between
the colonies and their mother country — tension that eventually was one of the precipitating
causes of revolt.
Beginning in 1650, the English passed a series of Navigation Acts to support mercantilism.
The Navigation Acts (1650) tried to regulate trade with the colonies to make more money for
England. As part of the program, Parliament passed the Molasses Act (1733), which imposed
a tax of sixpence per gallon on molasses (about $1 in modern money) to make English prod-
ucts cheaper than those from the French West Indies. Colonists largely opposed the tax and
rarely paid it; smuggling to avoid it was a huge business. The growing corruption of local offi-
cials and disrespect for British law caused by this act and others helped lead to the
American Revolution in 1776.

Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 
American tobacco filled the pipes of Europe, but the smoking trade was less troublesome;
most of the leaf shipped through England, giving British merchants a nice little rake-off.
Fighting All Over North America
Special as the colonies felt they were, they were actually pawns in a world-domination power
struggle among the great nations of Europe — mostly England, France, and Spain. Spain got
the early lead by finding gold and silver all over South America (except for Brazil, owned by
its Portuguese buddies), plus Mexico and other hot parts of what would eventually become
the United States. On the East Coast of North America, England started late but was catching
up fast, with no gold but plenty of valuable crops in the West Indies and 13 mainland
colonies. In Canada and other parts of North America, France went north of everybody else
for the furs and the fish.
Everybody was frontier fighting
The English colonists got left alone by Britain for 30 years, during which time they learned 
to kind of like being on their own. Being left alone also meant that at first, the kings didn’t
bother to send any troops over to help the colonists, which would be like getting involved in
a war between the squirrels in your backyard.
In both King William’s War (1690) and Queen Anne’s War (1710), French woodsmen and their
American Indian buddies raided English settlements. Fighting back, English colonists and
their American Indian allies attacked Canada without doing much damage. The French and
American Indians managed to kill a lot of settlers in Schenectady, New York, and Deerfield,
Massachusetts, but averaging out the rest of the conflicts, the British won. They got frozen
northern Canada around Hudson Bay and the island of Nova Scotia, north of Maine, for their
troubles.
The prize for the best war name goes to the War of Jenkins’s Ear (1739), fought over British
outrage that the Spanish cut off the ear of a British sea captain named Jenkins. During this
conflict, great Georgia reformer James Oglethorpe skillfully repelled Spanish raids into the
southern Atlantic colonies. (See Chapter 8 for more on Oglethorpe and Georgia.) When the
war spread, New Englanders hitched up their pants and, with the help of the Royal Navy,
invaded Canada again. This time, they captured a large French fort, but the British gave it
back at the end of the war in 1748. The colonists felt betrayed by Britain (and not for the 
last time).
The French and Indian War
In 1754, the governor of Virginia gave a 21-year-old surveyor named George Washington a mis-
sion to scout out French forces who were building forts on land on the Pennsylvania–Ohio
border — land that Virginians (including Washington’s family) liked to think they owned.
Washington, with 150 Virginian volunteers, spied some Frenchmen resting in the woods and
took a shot at them. The Frenchmen called for reinforcements and eventually surrounded
Washington. They could have killed him; his men had killed their leader in the sneak attack.
Instead, they let Washington and his men go — ironically enough, on July 4.

That incident was the beginning of the largest international war the world had yet seen; the
U.S. called it the French and Indian War, but it was the Seven Years’ War in the rest of the
world. The war raged so hot and heavy in Europe that the French couldn’t do much more in
the New World than unleash their American Indian allies. The British, fearing a stab in the
back from French people living under British rule in Canada, forced some 4,000 of them to
move to New Orleans, where they became the Cajuns.
To unite the colonists and impress the (hopefully) loyal Iroquois, the British called the inter-
colonial Albany Congress (1754). The American Indians stayed mostly loyal, and Ben Franklin
got to present his Albany Plan of Union, an early attempt to form a union of the colonies. It
was a nonstarter, but everybody agreed that the idea was interesting.
The British blew it repeatedly in the early French and Indian War. A major British attack
against Fort Duquesne (Pittsburgh) was cut to ribbons by a much smaller force of French 
and American Indians who knew about hiding behind bushes and rocks. In that battle,
Washington had two horses shot out from under him, and four bullets tore through his coat.
Miraculously unwounded, he rallied his men for an orderly retreat. A later major British
attack on outposts all over Canada also failed.
Finally, new Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder directed British forces to make a coordi-
nated assault on the key French fortress at Quebec. In one of the most important battles 
in British and American history, the British–American force won. The French were thrown
completely out of northern America, and William Pitt got Pittsburgh named after him.
During this long war, some 20,000 local troops from all the colonies learned to work and fight
together. They saw that the British could lose, and they experienced British arrogance first-
hand. British General James Wolfe, for example, called members of the American militia “con-
temptible, cowardly dogs.” And despite Washington’s heroic war record, the British demoted
him to captain. These actions weren’t very good ways to make friends.

Chapter 9: Growing Up and Getting Revolutionary: 1691–1775
The French Empire
In Canada, the French were held up by religious and
internal political hassles, but Samuel de Champlain
(1608) got a town going in the natural fortress of Quebec.
Almost right away, Champlain did something that
seemed so good but turned out so bad: He helped the
local Huron American Indians by kicking some booty on
their traditional enemies. Unfortunately, the Hurons’ tra-
ditional enemies were the megapowerful Iroquois
nation. Sure, only a few Iroquois were around when
Champlain got involved, but tens of thousands more lived
farther south, and after Champlain’s little faux pas, they
tended to side with the British.
The mostly Catholic French were pretty comfortable
back in France, and the French Protestants who would
have loved to get out of town to the New World weren’t
allowed to go. The French who did make it to the New
World were more interested in paddling around and par-
tying with the American Indians than settling down and
raising a family. This fact made for slow population
growth in the French colonies: By 1750, French Canada
boasted only 60,000 settlers, as opposed to the 1.25 mil-
lion in the English North American colonies. Like the
British, other French were getting rich on rum and sugar
down in the Caribbean, and most of them weren’t all that
big on going on freezing beaver hunts.
Although farming wasn’t their main thing, the French
managed to float a surprising amount of grain down the
Mississippi to feed their sugar colonies in the West
Indies. French fur trappers traveled farther and farther
for fur. French trading posts were established all across
Canada, up to the British settlements in America and
down to the Rio Grande in the south of what’s now Texas.
They moved around a lot, because when you trap too
many beaver, they tend to disappear.
Antoine Cadillac (1701) founded Detroit and fittingly
enough got a car named for him. Robert de La Salle
(1682) floated down the Mississippi and named Louisiana
for his king. The French also established a well-placed
fort at New Orleans (1718).

114
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 
With the French and most of the hostile American Indians out of the way, the colonies didn’t
need much protection from mother Britain. When the Treaty of Paris (1763) ended the war,
the colonies were psychologically on their way to 1776. With the French defeated, the English
tried to make peace with the American Indians by prohibiting the colonists from settling west
of the Alleghenies in the Proclamation of 1763.
Question: What was the Proclamation of 1763?
Answer: The Proclamation of 1763 was a British royal decree that forbade the American 
colonists from settling west of the Alleghenies. Its goal was to promote peace with the 
American Indians and a clear line of defense for the British.
The British halt Western expansion
The Treaty of Paris (see the preceding section) was a tough blow for the American Indians.
The warriors who had sided with the French lost an ally, but even American Indians who had
been neutral or pro-British had lost the French counterweight to colonial expansion.
In the same year that the French admitted defeat, the great Ottawa American Indian leader
Pontiac launched a last-ditch attack against the British advance into the Ohio country. It
almost worked. Pontiac’s warriors overran all but three British outposts west of the
Appalachians, killing 2,000 soldiers and settlers, and coming close to taking heavily fortified
Detroit. Pontiac’s name became another car.
Almost as though they were going into extreme defensive mode right after a victory, the
British issued the Proclamation of 1763, flatly forbidding any settlement west of the
Appalachians. The British were just trying to be fair to their American Indian allies and to
prevent more bloody uprisings like the one Pontiac had led. For the land-hungry Americans,
the law was a slap in the face of their long-fought-for dreams. They disobeyed the law and
moved West by the thousands. The British were in no mood to put up with insolence. Neither
were the Americans. It was head-butting time.
The Colonies Become Fighting Mad
By 1770, the 13 colonies were no longer just a fringe experiment out in the wilderness;
together, they were a country of 2.5 million well-fed, educated, and experienced people. The
American population was one third as big as that of the mother country, and America had a
lot more land. The problem was that the English couldn’t recognize a grown-up nation when
they saw one; they insisted on treating America like a spoiled child. Now it was time for the
child to make himself useful and do his chores.
These chores had to do with raising 140 million pounds (billions of dollars in modern
money) to pay for the debt Britain had run up fighting its wars. Up until this time, the
colonies had skated by without paying any dues to the mother country — sort of like buying
something tax-free on the Internet. No more. Mother Britain was coming up a little short, and
those pesky colonies were certainly big and strong enough to help.
Also, because the American Indians were still kicking up a fuss — and who knew whether the
French and the Spanish would stay defeated — it was time for the colonies to pay for the
standing army of 10,000 troops that Britain was helpfully sending over.

New thoughts about freedom
Schools in the colonies spent a lot of time teaching students about classical life in Greece
and Rome. Athens and Rome were often viewed as democracies where the people helped
decide on their own government, and teachers drilled this idea into the heads of the
colonists.
Settlers also had a selective idea of their rights as Englishmen — rights that had been slowly
expanding since the Magna Carta in 1215. The colonists’ idea of English liberty was selective
because they concentrated on their lack of representation in Parliament without proposing
an alternative solution to funding the army that Parliament had sent to defend them.
Finally, the colonists were influenced by the left-wing of British politics — the radical Whigs,
who distrusted everything the king did as a potential attack on their freedom. The Whigs saw
corruption everywhere in the royal government, and they weren’t always wrong. Although
the British government hadn’t seen a lot of tax revenue from the colonies, it had enjoyed a
fair amount of profit. This profit made the colonies worthwhile based on the theory of mer-
cantilism (discussed earlier in this chapter), which held that the power of a country can be
measured by how much money it has.
London was a long way away, and the colonists had no trouble slipping a little trade to other
places where they could make a profit. No matter how many Navigation Laws the British
passed, they couldn’t control the colonies. As the colonies got richer, their side business of
trade around the Navigation Laws got larger. Britain felt as though it had paid to take a date
to a dance, but that date was dancing with everybody else.
Stampin’ on the Stamp Act
With victory in their pockets and billions of dollars of debt making a hole in their purses, the
British decided to tax the colonists directly for the first time. Here are the legal actions that
Britain took:
 First, the prime minister ordered the British navy to start strictly enforcing the
Navigation Laws to end the colonies’ profitable side trade.
 Second, London enacted the Sugar Act (1764), the first law for raising revenue for
Britain in the New World. The Sugar Act taxed the sweet stuff Americans were just as
addicted to as everybody else. When the colonists screamed, the government lowered
the duties, and the outcry died down.
 Third, the Quartering Act (1765) attempted to give the 10,000 British soldiers in the New
World places to stay: with the colonists. Nobody wanted soldiers crowding into the
house and eating all the food. Colonial legislatures dragged their feet and refused to
cooperate.
 Fourth, Parliament passed the Stamp Act (1765). People in Britain had already been
paying stamp taxes for almost 100 years, but to the colonists, shelling out a few cents
to the king for every newspaper, playing card, lease, will, and even marriage license
seemed to be a major insult.
Colonial legislatures had passed plenty of taxes without trouble, but in those cases, the
colonists were taxing themselves. Now a bunch of snooty big shots an ocean away were
reaching into their pockets without permission. Chanting “No taxation without representa-
tion,” the colonists were fighting mad.

Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 
To remember all the legislation in order, consider this scene: You navigate to the store
(Navigation Laws) to buy some candy (Sugar Act), but a soldier stops you (Quartering Act)
and stamps your hand (Stamp Act). This analogy is silly, but it works.
With years of experience in self-government and the precedent of the Albany Congress set-
ting them up for cooperation, nine colonies quickly assembled the Stamp Act Congress (1765)
in New York City. The congress mostly just talked and passed some resolutions, but it did get
9 of the 13 colonies working together.
More to the point of protest were the unofficial nonimportation agreements (1765). Americans
agreed among themselves not to buy products from the mother country that was making
them so mad. These local agreements were enforced by a gang called the Sons of Liberty,
which wasn’t above applying tar and feathers to the bodies of people who tried to break the
strike by buying imported goods. The British were hit hard by the boycott; one quarter of
their exports had gone to the colonies, and now almost nothing was selling.
The Stamp Act, though, was a nonstarter. Under mob persuasion, all the stamp sellers had
been forced to resign before the act took effect. Because the law wasn’t working anyway,
Parliament revoked the Stamp Act in 1766. Although this repeal could have been an occasion
to make nice, the government instead petulantly enacted a resolution called the Declaratory
Act (1766), which declared that although it may be cutting some slack now, Parliament had
the power “to bind” the colonies “in all cases whatsoever.” It wasn’t long before Parliament
tried a little more binding.
Question: What was the purpose of the Stamp Act?
Answer: The purpose of the Stamp Act of 1765 was to raise money to support British 
troops in America.
The Boston Massacre
In 1768, the British landed about 1,200 troops in Boston — one soldier for every four resi-
dents. The Boston Massacre (1770) occurred when citizens started throwing rocks at ten
British troops and the troops fired back, killing or wounding 11 citizens. The Townshend Act
that had everybody so upset (see the following section) produced almost no revenue, and
the cost to the British of occupying the colonies continued to rise.
The Boston Tea Party
If the colonists wouldn’t pay direct taxes, why not skim a little more off the top before the
products got to the New World? The Townshend Act (1767) put a light import tax on glass,
lead, paper, paint — and, most importantly, on tea. This tax eventually led to the Boston Tea
Party (1773). When the injury of the tax was combined with the insult of granting a monopoly
on tea to the British East India Company, citizens responded by dumping a shipload of tea
into Boston Harbor.
Gearing up for a revolution
Samuel Adams was a Boston hothead with shaky hands but a firm resolve. While talking revo-
lution in the bars at night, he organized the first Committee of Correspondence (1772). Soon,
committees of correspondence were exchanging revolutionary ideas in and among all the
colonies. They had lots to talk about.

A couple of years later, the British passed what the colonists called the Intolerable Acts
(1774), designed to be a spanking for Massachusetts in general and Boston in particular. The
acts closed Boston Harbor until Boston paid Britain back for all the tea lost in the Tea Party.
The acts also took away the rights of the legislature and of town meetings, and allowed any
English officials who killed an American to be tried back in friendly Britain.
Showing less than zero political sensitivity to the feelings of America, the British also passed
the Quebec Act. This act expanded Canada down into Ohio on land the colonies thought
they owned. Something had to give.
The Committee of Correspondence set the groundwork for the first Continental Congress
(1774). After seven weeks of drinking and deliberation, the first congress passed a
Declaration of Rights and sent appeals to the British king and people. The congress also
established something called The Association to oversee a boycott of everything British.
Americans weren’t going to buy, sell, or even use British goods.
Determined to slap down growing resentment with a surge of strength, in April 1775, British
troops marched out of Boston to seize some arms and to arrest protest leaders Samuel
Adams and John Hancock. They met colonial militia in the towns of Lexington and Concord.
After taking some casualties, the militia fired back, and with American help running in from
the hills in all directions, the militia pushed the outnumbered British back to Boston. With
300 total casualties for both sides, the British had a war on their hands.
War wasn’t going to be easy for the Americans. They had one-third of the population of the
British army and not one-tenth of the money, and they were facing the most successful fight-
ers in the world. The British had an experienced standing army of 50,000 men, which they
made even stronger by hiring 30,000 German mercenaries. The colonies were far from united:
The British had as many as 50,000 American loyalists ready to fight their fellow colonists to
stay linked to Great Britain.
Contrary to some modern National Rifle Association beliefs, America in 1775 wasn’t a nation
of dead-eye marksmen. Only a small minority of households owned firearms. The colonies
had no gun factory, and an imported rifle cost the modern equivalent of $5,000. Only 1 out of
12 colonists reported for duty with their own rifles.
The colonists had the advantage of fighting on their own grounds. Eventually, they would get
help from the French and other nations. But mostly, the American advantage was that a dedi-
cated minority of the citizens of the New World colonies believed in freedom so much they
were willing to die for it.
Working Early Colonial History 
into Essay Subjects
Social-history themes make great essay fodder for the big AP U.S. History showdown. This
section covers a couple of ideas that historians love to chew on, based on the information in
this chapter. You may be able to work them into an assigned essay subject.
The Great Awakening seems to be about religion and, thus, about following cosmic rules, but
it also really shook things up socially. Public emotion wasn’t something that had been big in
Britain, but it was the common experience of religious deliverance in the Awakening. This
swept-away feeling helped set the stage for the emotion connected to the Revolution, which
would be fought by the grandchildren of the people who attended the Awakening. Awakening
preachers often came from congregations outside the religious mainstream. Their very pres-
ence outside the church implied that people could be true to God without following all the
117
Chapter 9: Growing Up and Getting Revolutionary: 1691–1775

118
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 
cues of the established churches. In fact, maybe people had to follow their own hearts to be
connected with God’s will. The Awakening led to new schools and the beginning of new light
ministers. Could a new country be far behind?
One of the greatest questions in U.S. history is the slavery/freedom paradox. How can one
country be the light of freedom in the world and a major exploiter of African slaves? One
answer is to see New England as the tower of freedom and abolition and to view the South as
the basement of slavery and reaction. But what about Patrick Henry, Washington, Jefferson,
Madison, the other architects of freedom, and all those Southern slaveholders? Another
answer is that slavery blurred the boundaries between rich and poor in the South and made
the idea of equality possible (for everybody but the slaves, of course). This idea gets some
support when you consider two other slaveholding beacons of democracy in the ancient
world: Greece and Rome.
Historian Edmund Morgan said, “Americans bought their independence with slave labor.” A
more balanced statement may be that America got economic power from a large-scale appli-
cation of the system of slavery that was legal in most of the world and far larger in the West
Indies and South America. The North and the Middle states didn’t need large-scale slavery to
make money; they were quite capable of winning their freedom without it. Only four genera-
tions after the Revolution, while slavery was making more money than it ever had before, the
United States fought the bloodiest war in its history — the Civil War — to free the slaves.
That war is one of the only times in history when one people (white Northerners with freed
black help) fought for the rights of another people (enslaved black Southerners) — not for
conquest or glory, but to put an end to slavery in the land of the free.

W
hen George Washington heard the news about the fighting at Lexington and Concord
(see Chapter 9) he wrote from Mount Vernon to a friend, “. . . the once-happy and
peaceful plains of America are either to be drenched in blood or inhabited by slaves. Sad
alternative! But can a virtuous man hesitate in his choice?”
Washington didn’t hesitate. The Second Continental Congress (1775) met in Philadelphia a
month after the battle and appointed Washington to command the 30,000 militia troops 
currently bottling up 8,000 British soldiers in Boston.
The patient 43-year-old Washington was a good choice. He may not have been history’s most
brilliant general, but he was competent and sometimes even daring. Most important, he had
the strength of character to hold the army together through hard times and the aristocratic
bearing to assure people with money that the rebels were more than just an angry mob.
Those tough times, and their aftermath, are covered in this chapter.
Exciting as they are, battles and military campaigns seldom appear in the big AP exam. The
test mavens are more interested in the meaning of conflicts and what social conditions con-
tributed to and came out of the fights. Still, some knowledge of how the Revolution went
down can provide handy ammunition for answering political, economic, and social ques-
tions. This chapter gives you the short version of the American war for independence.
Power of the Pen: Common Sense and 
the Declaration of Independence
The Continental Congress could have just mailed King George III a polite letter telling him to
get the heck out of America, but educated people know giving reasons is always better when
they want to make some major changes. The explaining-why-you’ve-got-to-go job went to 32-
year-old Virginian Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the Declaration of Independence. Before the
Declaration, though, people were talking about the writings of Thomas Paine.

Showing the power of an idea whose time had come, patriot Paine published a pamphlet
called Common Sense (1776), arguing that it just made common sense for the colonies to be
separated from Britain. Britain was a small island compared with the vast expanse of the
colonies. Where in the universe does a small star control a large planet? Paine had a dream of
a new kind of government — a republic in which power came from the people, not from some
corrupt king.
America was ready to hear Paine’s words. People in Britain had slowly been increasing their
freedom for years; many colonists knew the words of progressive British thinkers who sup-
ported the theory of a republic. Freedom was no theory in America; New England town meet-
ings and elections throughout the colonies prepared patriots to launch the world’s first true
republic.
In the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson wrote that all men are created equal, with the
right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. He called these natural rights, not theoreti-
cal or British or pie-in-the-sky-when-we-die rights. Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence
(1776) has served as a model for progressive people around the world ever since. In the
Declaration, Jefferson calmly listed the ways the British king and government had trampled
on America’s natural rights. The Declaration was officially approved on July 4, 1776.
Notice that both Paine and Jefferson referred to natural rights and common sense. They
viewed the world as being rational, made for humans, and capable of being improved by
people. They were children of the Enlightenment (1760), a giant wake-up call that started in
the early 1700s and spread around the world. Despite the continued presence of fear and
intolerance, people still live with the ideas of the Enlightenment.
Britain versus the Patriots: 
The Fighting Escalates
The fighting between the patriots and the British loyalist forces began to look like more than
just a family feud when the patriots surprised some British forts in northern New York and
hauled off their cannons. With the extra firepower, the patriots marched up Bunker Hill (actu-
ally, Breed’s Hill), overlooking Boston.
The British eventually dislodged the patriots, but not without losing a lot of men. The British
burned a couple of seaports; the patriots invaded Canada and kicked some Loyalist butt in
the South. Then the British hired German professional soldiers, called Hessians, to help them
whip the colonists.
Problems the British faced
Like any occupying power, the problem for the British army was that it really controlled only
the ground it was standing on. Although as many as 50,000 Loyalist colonists fought along-
side the British at one time or another, their numbers weren’t enough to keep any large part
of America loyal to the king after the king’s army left town.
Things got pretty hot for Loyalists when the British army wasn’t around to protect them.
Patriots weren’t above going from tar-and-feather parties to destruction of Loyalist property
and violence that bordered on terrorism. Some 80,000 Loyalists moved out of the country to
Canada or Britain.

121
Chapter 10: You Say You Want a Revolution? Freedom and Change, 1776–1815
Problems the patriots faced
The problem for the patriots was that the British had a larger and better-trained army — at
least 35,000 British and Hessian troops supported by 500 ships. Washington had at most
18,000 men, mostly poorly trained and equipped. Although by the end of the war, Washington
had around 8,000 properly trained regular-army Continental soldiers, many of the minuteman
volunteers who made up most of the army were good for little more than a minute in a stand-
up battle. Sniping from behind rocks went only so far in a real war; sooner or later, the armies
faced each other across an open field. Minutemen volunteers tended to fire a round or two
and then head home to their farms. Developing soldiers who would stand up to British
cannon and massed musket fire took years of drilling and combat experience.
Slaves: Fighting for both sides
Thousands of African slaves fought with the British because they were promised freedom if
they did. Many, but not most, were helped out of the country when the war ended. The black
Loyalist Colonel Titus Tye became legendary for capturing supplies and patriots. Blacks
fought for the Revolution as well: A black soldier is shown right next to Washington in the
famous picture of Washington crossing the Delaware.
Winning the American Revolution, in a Nutshell
Surrounded by angry colonists, the British cleared out of Boston and sailed to New York City,
where they had a lot more fans. George Washington tried to defend New York but was quickly
pushed out, almost losing his army and his life in the fallback. As winter closed off the ability
of the armies to maneuver, Washington struck back bravely against detachments of the
British army in New Jersey; famously rowing across the ice-clogged Delaware River at night
on December 26, 1776.
Meanwhile, the British planned to cut troublesome New England off from the rest of the
colonies by marching an army down from Canada through New York. Didn’t work. In the
important Battle of Saratoga (1777), a patriot army forced the British to surrender in northern
New York. That victory gave the French the courage to enter the war on the side of the patri-
ots. French help was huge, because the French had the weapons, navy, and well-trained regu-
lar army that the patriots desperately needed. After their loss at Saratoga, the British offered
the Americans home rule within the British empire, but it was way too late for that.
Question: What was the most important outcome of the Battle of Saratoga?
Answer: The win by the patriots in the Battle of Saratoga gave the French confidence
to enter the war to help the rebels.
Cutting it close to find freedom
Congress didn’t officially declare the United States inde-
pendent until 14 months after the first shots were fired.
With both sides firing away, Congress’s hesitation for
more than a year shows how close the colonies still felt
to Britain.
Another sign of how difficult it was to break the bond
with Mother England was the fact that around one in six
colonial people were loyal to the British crown. Not only
did Loyalists not want to leave Britain, but they were also
ready to fight the patriots who did.

Valley Forge and help from France
Another British army managed to take Philadelphia, forcing the members of the Continental
Congress to run for their lives. Washington’s army stayed gamely nearby, freezing through a
terrible winter at its Valley Forge camp. With the French threatening them, the British high-
tailed it back to the safety of New York City, fighting a hot battle with Washington along the
way. For the next three years, Washington stayed close to New York, tying down the British
troops there. The French landed a powerful army of 6,000 soldiers to help the patriots.
Obviously, the British couldn’t win the war by sitting around New York. Because New
England hadn’t worked for the British, and the Middle states were a little tough, they decided
to try the South, where a large Loyalist population promised a happy welcome.
Cornwallis and losing morale
British General Charles Cornwallis took the South’s most important city, Charleston, forcing
the surrender of the entire Southern patriot army. Then he marched through the Carolinas
and Virginia constantly harassed by patriot forces who attacked any time they could isolate a
bite-sized British force. Patriots stung Cornwallis but couldn’t stop him.
After four years of war, the patriots were running out of steam in 1780. Despite French help,
the powerless Congress was so broke that it announced it could pay off patriot debts only at
the rate of 2.5 cents on the dollar. Without food and supplies, Washington’s army was close
to mutiny. Rich American merchants sold the patriots bad-quality supplies at huge profits.
The South seemed to be going to the British. Many of the once-gung-ho revolutionaries
despaired of ever winning their freedom. Soldiers worried about how their families were
doing without them, the chronic lack of guns and food, and the fact that they got paid in
almost-worthless paper money.
Question: What were the complaints of the Continental soldiers in Washington’s army?
Answer: Continental soldiers’ discontent came from home worries, not enough weapons, 
paper-money pay, and little food.
Victory and the Treaty of Paris
Then Cornwallis decided to do something really safe: He marched his army to what he
thought was shelter and resupply in Yorktown on the Virginia coast. Instead of being met by
the protective, well-stocked British fleet, he found the French navy controlling the escape
routes by sea. Washington and his French allies marched 300 miles from New York in a few
weeks to attack the trapped British.
Cornwallis surrendered with about one quarter of all the British troops in North America.
After another year of small-scale fighting, the British government gave up. The Americans
went from despair to joyous celebration.
In the Treaty of Paris (1783), the British formally recognized the independence of the United
States. They took a satisfyingly broad view of what the new United States owned, signing
over everything from the Atlantic to the Mississippi and from the Great Lakes to Spanish
Florida. America began its independence with the largest area of rich land in the world and
with a priceless heritage of freedom.

Question: What were the major parts of the 1783 Treaty of Paris?
Answer: Under the Treaty of Paris, the United States was free and owned all the lands 
to the Mississippi.
Designing a New Country
The American Revolution introduced the reality, not just the theory, of democratic govern-
ment to the world. The Revolution challenged the old order in Europe and South America by
opposing inherited political power with the democratic idea that government rests on the
consent of the governed. The example of the first successful revolution against a European
empire provided a model for many other colonial peoples, who realized that they too could
become self-governing nations. In the 20th century, revolutionaries sometimes even quoted
Thomas Jefferson as they fought against American economic interests.
America won its independence with the help of the endless fights between European coun-
tries; it provided the model for what would become, 200 years later, the peaceful European
Union. The United States remains the leading example of the extent to which a country with
people from all around the world can remain a free society.
Before America could do all that, though, it had to figure out exactly what changes to make
after it became independent. In their enthusiasm for new-found freedom, some lawmakers
got ahead of the times.
After the Revolution, with 1 out of 30 of the American people (the most conservative Loyalist
residents) taking a permanent vacation to Canada or Britain, the new United States had a dis-
tinctly progressive bent. Once, for example, the titles Mr. and Mrs. were reserved only for the
upper classes; now everybody got called that. Even more social changes were to come.
Separation of church and state
Church and state were separated. Although the Congregationalist denomination hung on for
a few years as the official religion of Massachusetts, one by one, the states dropped any affili-
ation with a particular denomination. One of Jefferson’s proudest accomplishments was the
passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom (1786), which separated religion from
government in what was then the largest state. It served as a model for other states.
Early attempts to abolish slavery
The Continental Congress of 1774 called for the abolition of the slave trade. Some Northern
states ended slavery as early as 1776. In writing the new Constitution, Southern slaveholders
got a Three Fifths Compromise that allowed them to count part of each slave toward the rep-
resentation they’d get in Congress.
Question: What was the Three-Fifths Compromise?
Answer: The Three-Fifths Compromise meant that slaves counted toward Congressional 
representation.

Even a few forward-thinking Southerners freed their slaves in a burst of Revolutionary zeal.
Washington arranged for his slaves to be set free after he and his wife died. Although the U.S.
set a deadline of 1808 to abolish the importation of new slaves, a slave rebellion in Haiti
(1791) scared a lot of slave owners into harsher treatment of slaves. The slave revolt also
made Napoleon rethink his involvement in the New World.
Question: What was the influence of the slave rebellion in Haiti on the U.S.?
Answer: The rebellion scared Southern slave owners into increasingly brutal treatment 
of slaves and gave Napoleon a reason to want to sell out of his interests in the New 
World, paving the way for the Louisiana Purchase.
Jefferson was embarrassed that he couldn’t free his slaves. Enslaved workers were worth 
as much as $50,000 each in modern money. A poor businessman, Jefferson had been forced
to mortgage his slaves to the bank, which wouldn’t let Jefferson set them free. The Polish
American Revolutionary war hero Thaddeus Kosciusko spent his army pay to help buy the
freedom of slaves.
Women’s gains and republican motherhood
Women made some early gains. New Jersey’s Revolutionary constitution of 1776 even briefly
granted women the right to vote, 100 years before the rest of the world. Although that early
right was overturned, women played a role in the freedom fight. John Adams’s wife, Abigail,
warned him in her so-called Remember-the-Ladies letter before the Declaration of
Independence that women were ready to start their own revolution. During the war, some
women dressed like men fought in both the artillery and the infantry for the patriots. Two
sisters dragged a British messenger off his horse and smuggled his secret dispatches
through enemy lines to the Americans. He never knew what hit him.
Question: What did Abigail Adams, wife of future president John Adams, write about in a 
famous letter to him?
Answer: In an early call for women’s rights, Abigail advised John to “remember the ladies.”
The idea of republican motherhood (1780) elevated women to the role of keeper of the
nation’s conscience and first educator of future patriots. The concept of republican mother-
hood resulted in increased educational opportunities for American women. By 1837, women
had their own source of higher education: Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, the predecessor
to Mount Holyoke College.
Question: What was the meaning of republican motherhood?
Answer: Republican motherhood meant that it was the important responsibility of 
women to raise the next generation of freedom-loving patriots.
Although republican motherhood kept women at home rearing children, it also produced 
an initiative that legitimized political activity. The Abolitionist movement, which began to
gain strength in the 1830s and 1840s, found many of its strongest voices among educated
Northern women. The Seneca Falls Convention (1848), which began the women’s-rights 
movement in the United States, owes some of its origin to the emphasis on republican 
motherhood at the time of the Revolution.

Chapter 10: You Say You Want a Revolution? Freedom and Change, 1776–1815
Trade, industry, and economic democracy
The rich Loyalists who split the country left behind some oversized chunks of land that were
divided among deserving patriots. Although land that the king and his unrepentant subjects
had owned was sold to help pay off the war debt, few attacks were made on former Loyalists
who chose to stay in the new country. Economic democracy meant sharing fairly in the
wealth of the land; because America didn’t have royalty or an aristocracy, it had some meas-
ure of economic democracy even before the political democracy of the Revolution got going.
That may be one reason why the United States didn’t experience as much violence after its
change of government as France did.
Trade and industry got off to a good recovery after the Revolution. Although the United
States was outside the British family, it still had the whole non-British world with which to
trade. American ships were landing in China as soon as they could get out of port after the
peace treaty was signed. River-powered industry was encouraged in New England as soon as
the restrictions of old England were gone. Building industry wasn’t always easy. The new
country had to compete with British manufacturers that were dumping products that had
been bottled up by the war for cheap prices.
Looking to make the country larger
The ink had barely dried on the peace treaty that ended the Revolution when Congress sat
down to plan for the expansion of the United States into its western lands. The Land
Ordinance of 1785 provided that the land in the old Northwest Territory — covering what are
now Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin — should be sold to help pay off the
national debt. The proceeds from the sale of 1 out of 36 sections went to support local
schools, a gift to education that was unheard-of in the rest of the world.
The even more important Northwest Ordinance (1787) let government of the new lands pass
quickly from dependent territories to full partnership states as soon as any state had 60,000
residents. It also banned slavery in the Northwest Territory.
Question: What was the major purpose of the Northwest Ordinance?
Answer: The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 provided rules for admission of new states 
and prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory.
Setting Down the Legal Foundation of a Nation
To get a fresh start, the Continental Congress in 1776 asked the states to rewrite their state
constitutions as republican documents. Written constitutions serve as the fundamental 
rules — laws that don’t change with the day-to-day ideas of ordinary legislation. Most of the
state constitutions were similar, being contracts that defined the powers of government and
the rights of citizens.
Massachusetts came up with the new idea of having the people of the state ratify any amend-
ments to the state constitution. The amendment process for the U.S. Constitution still works
that way: The legislatures of three-quarters of all the states must approve any changes. After
the states began to think in a new way, almost half of the 13 original colonies decided to
move their capitals to be closer to the people in the center of each state.

The Articles of Confederation
To set some permanent rules for the new nation, Congress had taken the time, between run-
ning the war and running from the British, to draft the Articles of Confederation (1777). The
big deal at first wasn’t so much how to govern the new country as how to handle the land it
was sitting on. Most colonial governments liked to think of themselves as extending all the
way over the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi, if not to the Pacific. They each had
claims on Western land. The central government got the states to give up these claims so
that new states could be formed and land sold to settlers to support the central government.
The individual states pooled their Western land resources for the common good.
This was an important start, because the Articles of Confederation gave no power to
Congress to collect taxes. Congress established a tax quota for each state and then used the
time-honored negotiating strategy of begging and pleading to get the states to pay up. How
well this system worked is reflected in the number of brave Continential soldiers who were
never even supplied shoes by the government. And tax collecting wasn’t the end of the
Confederation government’s weakness. Congress wasn’t allowed to regulate commerce and
set tariffs; each state did that individually. Oranges could be taxed at 10 cents in New York
and $10 in Pennsylvania — possibly both ways if a cargo moved across state lines.
Question: What was the major government revenue weakness of the Articles of 
Confederation?
Answer: Under the Articles of Confederation, the United States couldn’t levy taxes or 
control commerce.
If the British have it, we don’t want it!
The Confederation was an anti–King George machine; whatever the colonies didn’t like about
the British government, they left out of the Articles of Confederation. Dictatorial administra-
tion? No problem. The articles allowed for no president, king, or executive at all. Crooked
judges? Got it covered. The articles established no national judicial system; each state did its
own thing. The central government got to negotiate treaties and run a postal system, though
it was a little unclear where it would get the money to print the stamps.
The Articles of Confederation contained good things as well. First, the articles existed, giving
the states a unified platform to work with. Second, pitiful as they were, the articles clearly
spelled out the powers of the government. Unlike the unwritten, hard-to-define British
Constitution, the articles were right there in black and white. They held the union together
through a tough war and gave the states a stepping stone to something stronger and more
permanent.
The states rebel
When the war was over, the states’ attentions drifted back to their own interests. Quarrels
over boundaries generated minor battles between discharged state militias. A large but
mostly peaceful uprising in western Massachusetts, led by a captain in the war, scared the
government and the local courts.
Shays’ Rebellion (1786) was a series of armed demonstrations led by small farmers angered
by debt and taxes. Failure to repay debts often resulted in imprisonment in debtor’s prisons
or loss of the family farm. The rebels freed their friends from prison and stopped courts from
ordering evictions. The rebellion lasted about six months before it was violently put down by
126
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

127
Chapter 10: You Say You Want a Revolution? Freedom and Change, 1776–1815
a private army paid for by rich landowners. Without a standing army, the national govern-
ment could do nothing. This scare helped lead to support for the Constitutional Convention
(1787), which began a few months after the rebellion.
Question: What was Shays’ Rebellion?
Answer: In Shays’ Rebellion, debt-ridden Massachusetts farmers attacked courts. The 
Rebellion helped show the need for a more powerful federal government.
The Constitutional Convention
Delegates from all the states came to the Constitutional Convention, including Revolutionary
superstars Ben Franklin (then 81 years old), Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison. George
Washington chaired the meeting.
The delegates knew they needed a strong central government, but they wanted to preserve
the maximum rights to states and their individual citizens. Proposals broke down into a
large-state plan and a small-state plan. Under the Confederation, the rule had been one state,
one vote. The big states wanted representation by population size. In the end, the great com-
promise split the difference. Big states got the House of Representatives, based on popula-
tion; the small states got the U.S. Senate, with two senators for every state no matter how
small. As a tip to the big states, all tax and revenue bills had to start in the House. The many
compromises took years to be finally approved.
Question: Did all the delegates agree with the new Constitution at the first meeting?
Answer: No, the Constitution was controversial and required compromise and years of 
discussion to be ratified by all 13 states.
Getting over King George-o-phobia, the delegates established a strong president who could
appoint judges and other officials, serve as commander in chief of the military, and veto leg-
islation. This strong president was to be chosen by the people indirectly through an electoral
college as a supposed safeguard against mob rule.
Slavery: Reduced but not gone yet
The Southern states wanted to count slaves as part of their population to get more represen-
tatives in the House. The North said it was nice that the South finally wanted to count slaves
as people, but the way Southerners treated slaves, Northerners may as well request repre-
sentation for their horses.
The two sides split the difference: Slaves were partly counted in the Three-Fifths Compromise
(1787). All but two of the states wanted to shut down the African slave trade; the compro-
mise was to stop stealing people from Africa in 20 years (1807).
Reining in the states
The Constitution needed the approval of nine states to get going. Eventually, it was approved
by all 13 states, but it took 3 years and some mighty close votes. In general, wealthy, well-
educated people liked the strong central government called for by the new Constitution;
people who supported the federal Constitution were Federalists (1788). They wrote the
Federalist Papers, arguing that a large republic can best protect minority rights.

In the end, the laws that didn’t change in the Constitution served all the people. You can
count on one hand the countries in the world that have had stable governments for the past
200 years. Although it’s far from an economic democracy, the United States has provided a
shield for freedom and a chance for success to millions of people.
Question: What was the main point of the Federalist Papers?
Answer: The Federalist Papers argued that a large republic best protects minority rights.
As weary old Ben Franklin was leaving the convention hall, a woman asked him, “Well,
doctor, what have we got — a republic or a monarchy?” The elder statesman replied, “A
republic, madam, if you can keep it.”
First president: George Washington
George Washington became the first U.S. president in 1789. His ride from quiet Mount Vernon
to the nation’s temporary capital of New York City was one big party: Bells rang, bands
played, and the roads were strewn with flowers. Washington took the oath of office on a bal-
cony overlooking Wall Street — something that some people have seen as a bad omen for
economic democracy. Washington appointed the first Cabinet: Thomas Jefferson, Alexander
Hamilton, and Henry Knox.
Bill of Rights
The Bill of Rights (1791), the first ten amendments to the Constitution, was approved by all
the states to guarantee that the new Constitution would mandate basic rights for all citizens.
Spelling out these rights put critics of the new Constitution at ease by mandating freedom of
speech and religion and other liberties.
Although the AP exam probably won’t trick you with individual amendment numbers, the Bill
of Rights makes excellent essay fodder and can come in handy on multiple-choice questions.
Here’s the short version:
 First Amendment: freedom of religion, speech, and press
 Second Amendment: right to keep and bear arms
 Third Amendment: protection from mandatory quartering of troops in private 
citizens’ homes
 Fourth Amendment: protection from unreasonable search and seizure
 Fifth Amendment: due process under the law
 Sixth Amendment: right to criminal trial by jury and other rights for the accused
 Seventh Amendment: right to civil trial by jury
 Eighth Amendment: no excessive bail or cruel and unusual punishment
 Ninth Amendment: establishes that amendments don’t limit rights, just suggest 
some
 Tenth Amendment: establishes that powers not listed belong to the states and 
people

Moving Along with the Young Republic
One thing that America was good at was growing people. By the time of the first official
census in 1790, almost 4 million people inhabited the U.S., up from just over 2 million in 1770.
Although business was picking up, the government was still deep in debt from the
Revolutionary War.
Treasury Secretary Hamilton had a unique idea: He actually wanted to pay off the national
debt. Even though the United States had won the war, investors still didn’t think government
bonds were worth much more than 10 cents on the dollar. Hamilton proposed to pay them all
back and got Congress to approve a duty on foreign imports and U.S.-made luxury items such
as whiskey and carriages to raise money. The credit of the United States improved. Hamilton
supported the development of a national bank, partially funded by the government, that
could keep money in circulation and help boost the economy. He also wanted to give subsi-
dies to business, but Congress wouldn’t buy that. Jefferson argued against the Bank of the
United States, but it passed. Although he got the nation on a firm financial footing, Hamilton’s
policies were seen by poorer farmers as serving the rich Eastern merchants.
Question: What was Alexander Hamilton’s economic policy?
Answer: Alexander Hamilton’s economic program included a Bank of the U.S., plus 
excise and tariff taxes. Congress rejected his idea of direct subsidies to manufacturers.
Question: How was Hamilton’s financial program viewed by poorer voters?
Answer: Alexander Hamilton’s fiscal policy was seen as favoring Eastern merchants.
As a states’-rights strict-constructionist, Jefferson believed that anything not specifically men-
tioned in the Constitution was prohibited. Hamilton took a broad interpretation or loose-
construction view of the Constitution. He thought the Constitution had implied powers,
which allowed the government to do whatever was necessary to carry out the general tasks
assigned in the Constitution. A modern example of implied power is the federal road-building
program; the only power enumerated for this in the Constitution is the maintainence of
postal roads. Therefore, every freeway is officially a postal road.
The Whiskey Rebellion
The Whiskey Rebellion (1794) was a protest on the western Pennsylvania frontier against the
tax Hamilton had gotten passed on booze. At almost $4 a gallon in modern money, the tax 
was more than most self-respecting moonshiners could come up with in a barter economy.
Whiskey was distilled money for the frontier farmers, who had little cash and almost no trans-
portation; whiskey was the easiest and most profitable thing to do with a crop of grain. Even
preachers got paid with jugs of booze, which they could then exchange for food or supplies.
Hamilton’s tax may have raised money, but it really hurt small-time farmer/distillers. With
local protests spreading throughout the states, Hamilton and Washington personally led an
army of 13,000 armed men on a fruitless search for whiskey criminals near Pittsburgh. They
didn’t catch many people, but they made their point. The whiskey business paid up for a
while in Pennsylvania. On a larger scale, the new federal government showed it could use
force to back up laws. But in other places without soldiers, the tax was difficult to collect,
and it was repealed in 1803.
129
Chapter 10: You Say You Want a Revolution? Freedom and Change, 1776–1815

Forming political parties
Hamilton’s ambitious big-government programs created opposition from people like
Jefferson, who believed in more individualism and less government. Political parties began 
to form around these opinions. People who liked Hamilton’s ideas were called Federalists
(1795), and Jefferson’s followers called themselves Democratic-Republicans (1800). The
Federalists died out around 1816. After trying silly party names like Whigs (1834) and Know-
Nothings (1855), American’s factions divided the names of Jefferson’s party. Political parties
weren’t an idea of the framers of the Constitution, but they’ve been a handy addition to
democracy, always scraping just to the right or left of whoever is in power.
Trying to stay out of other people’s wars
The French had a bloody revolution of their own, occasioning yet another war with Britain.
The Franco-American Alliance (1788) that was key in helping the United States win its inde-
pendence was still on the books, but Washington decided not to take sides and issued his
Neutrality Proclamation (1793). That was okay with the French, who figured that the baby
United States wouldn’t be much help anyway.
Meanwhile, on the Ohio frontier, the American Indians had gotten together in the Miami
Confederacy (1790) and had twice beaten up small U.S. armies sent against them. The British
were still lurking in forts on American soil, arming the American Indians. Finally, a serious
U.S. force beat the American Indians at the Battle of Fallen Timbers (1794), and the American
Indians sold most of their lands in the Treaty of Greenville (1795).
Rolling along the treaty trail, trying to stay out of trouble, the United States signed Jay’s
Treaty (1794) with Britain to stop the British from lurking in forts. The agreement didn’t stop
Britain’s nagging bad habit of seizing American ships at sea and forcing U.S. sailors to join its
navy, but it did let the United States into the valuable trade with the British West Indies.
Spain cut the United States a break with Pinckney’s Treaty (1795), giving the new country all
the land down to Florida and free use of the Mississippi. America was getting a little respect.
That little respect was more than Washington was getting from many people in the country
he helped create.
Question: What was Pinckney’s Treaty?
Answer: Pinckney’s Treaty of 1795 with Spain fixed Southern boundaries and gave U.S. 
ships the right to use the Mississippi River.
Washington leaves office
Facing criticism and tired of politics, Washington left office at the end of his second term. His
Farewell Address (1796) warned the nation to stay out of permanent alliances and asked
people to be governed by moral religious principles.
Washington himself was a freethinking Freemason who welcomed all religions and avoided
communion with sectarian statements of faith in his later years. He was an example of good
behavior; after 200 years, his pure character still shines. He liked a good time, however; his
major retirement project was the construction on his property of one of the largest whiskey
stills in the country. His last words were “It is well.”
130
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

John Adams takes over
John Adams (1797), the second American president, sent envoys to France to try to solve a
hissy fit. Angry that the Americans would be dating the British with Jay’s Treaty when they
should be going steady with them under the Franco-American Alliance, the French were
taking a leaf from the British playbook and seizing American ships at sea. After an aborted
negotiation called the XYZ Affair (1797), for the coded names of three French envoys who
tried to extort a bribe from the United States, both sides got over their emotions and signed
the Convention of 1800, which ended their formal alliance.
Don’t miss the forest for the trees. The AP exam cares about trends, not a whirlwind of treaty
names. The individual names are like a bonus round: you get extra points for remembering.
The main trend to understand from all this early U.S. diplomacy is that the new nation was
wisely avoiding war and slowly gaining respect. If the United States had fought a war with
France in 1800, the French surely wouldn’t have sold America the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.
What with all the international and domestic political tensions, the ruling Federalists in
Congress freaked out and passed the Alien and Sedition Acts (1798). These acts made criticiz-
ing the president a crime, raised the waiting time for citizenship from 5 to 17 years, and
allowed the government to deport any noncitizens it didn’t like.
The U.S. appeared to be on the path to becoming a police-state, but Jefferson fought the
repressive laws every step of the way, and they expired at the end of Adams’s one term as
president. Jefferson and James Madison secretly wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions
(1798), which were passed by these states to protest the repressive Alien and Sedition Acts.
In fighting the laws, Jefferson took an extreme turn in the antigovernment direction and intro-
duced the concept of nullification, saying that any state could refuse to follow a federal law it
didn’t like. This concept would come back to roost in a bad way before the Civil War.
Question: What were the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions?
Answer: Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions championed states’ rights against the Alien 
and Sedition Acts.
Thomas Jefferson: Moving into the 1800s
Thomas Jefferson (1801) narrowly squeaked past Federalist attacks to become the third presi-
dent. This election marked the first change in political parties for the United States and was
an important landmark for peaceful political transition. Jefferson believed in small govern-
ment, and he reduced government programs; he pardoned the martyrs to the expired Alien
and Sedition Acts, and the government returned many of their fines. A new naturalization act
again let immigrants become citizens after only five years. In 1804, Alexander Hamilton was
killed in a duel with Vice President Aaron Burr; Burr fled the country.
Question: What was Thomas Jefferson’s political approach?
Answer: Jefferson reduced the activities of the federal government.
During his last days in office, Adams had appointed a new chief justice of the Supreme Court,
John Marshall. Marshall had only six weeks of formal legal training; he was President
Adams’s last choice after three other men couldn’t take the job. Jefferson didn’t like
Marshall’s strong-government views but couldn’t get rid of him.
131
Chapter 10: You Say You Want a Revolution? Freedom and Change, 1776–1815

Empowering the Supreme Court
Marshall had suffered from hunger and cold as a soldier at Valley Forge; he knew govenments
had to be strong enough to deliver for their people. Marshall’s first landmark case was
Marbury v. Madison (1803). In rejecting an appeal from a fellow Federalist, Marshall over-
turned a previous law as unconstitutional because it didn’t agree with the 15-year-old U.S.
Constitution. This set the precedent that the Supreme Court can review all laws for their 
constitutionality.
Question: What was the importance of the case of Marbury v. Madison?
Answer: This decision gave the Supreme Court the power to review all laws for their 
constitutionality.
Jefferson’s small-government followers tried to strike back by filing impeachment charges
against a judge they didn’t like. Congress dropped the charges, and the principles of inde-
pendent judicial review and separation of powers got under way.
Making a deal with Napoleon
In France, famous Napoleon Bonaparte had two troubles on his mind: He was fighting almost
every other country in Europe, and he had just lost a war to an island of slaves. Haiti was a
rich sugar island where thousands of slaves had risen up in revolt against their French mas-
ters. Napoleon’s troops could shoot their way in, but diseases and guerilla warfare meant
they really couldn’t stay. Napoleon needed money and wanted out of the New World.
Jefferson had sent negotiators to France to try to buy New Orleans. They had authorization
to pay as much as $10 million (half a billion dollars in modern money) for the city. Napoleon
surprised them by offering all of France’s holdings in North America, from the Mississippi to
the Pacific Ocean, for $15 million. What the heck? They bought a wilderness to get a city.
Question: What was the background of the Louisiana Purchase?
Answer: The Louisiana Purchase resulted from Napoleon’s loss in Haiti, opened the 
whole trans-Mississippi area, and showed Jefferson’s flexibility with his own strict-
constructionist views.
Lewis and Clark
Meriwether Lewis and William Clark (1804) explored the new territory with the help of the
American Indian woman Sacajawea. They wouldn’t have survived without her. The fact that
Lewis and Clark’s expedition was traveling with a woman and her child showed the American
Indians that the expedition wasn’t a hostile war party. Their 21⁄2-year epic adventure pointed
the way west for future settlers. Other early explorers, including Zebulon Pike (1805),
brought back reports of the immense and unknown new territory of the United States. Pike
showed the value of publicity; although Pikes Peak was only one of over 50 tall mountains in
Colorado, it became the one everybody knows.
Caught between Britain and France
After winning a landslide reelection victory in 1804, Jefferson and the nation were caught
between France and Britain in their seemingly endless war to control Europe. Jefferson was
132
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

133
Chapter 10: You Say You Want a Revolution? Freedom and Change, 1776–1815
unpopular for keeping the United States out of an early war with the great powers; America
couldn’t trade with either power without facing the other’s guns. Both sides grabbed
American merchant ships and sailors. The British forced some 6,000 American sailors to 
join their navy between 1808 and 1811 alone.
Question: How was Jefferson’s policy of avoiding war received by the public?
Answer: Jefferson was unpopular for neutrality toward Britain and France.
Too weak to fight, the United States passed the Embargo Acts (1807), which were meant to
stop all trade with foreign nations. While the United States held its breath and turned blue,
the British and French managed to do without American goods. American exporters either
smuggled goods or went out of business; many saw the acts as attacking Americans to fight
foreigners.
To the extent that they kept foreign goods out, the Embargo Acts helped infant U.S. indus-
tries grow without competition. Some traders actually liked the cops-and-robbers aspects of
the smuggling business; it was exciting, and the profits were great if you didn’t get busted.
Just before Jefferson left office, Congress passed the Non-Intercourse Act (1809), which limited
the embargo to Britain and France.
James Madison steps in
James Madison (1809), friend and follower of Jefferson, took over as president of a nation still
caught in the French/British nutcracker. The 15-year U.S. headache of foreign entanglement
without any foreign alliances showed the impossibility of separating the United States from
the world, as both Washington and Jefferson had wished. As a trading nation, America 
couldn’t avoid the crossfire of belligerents.
Congress tried a finesse that was too tricky by half. Macon’s Bill No. 2 (1810) said that if
either Britain or France would end its commercial blockade, the United States would restore
its embargo against the nation that didn’t stop blocking trade. In other words, America would
take sides, but it was first come, first served. France promised to be good; Britain didn’t.
America was drawn closer to another conflict with Britain.
Britain’s deal with Tecumseh
Meanwhile, in the green forests of the frontier, a strong Shawnee leader named Tecumseh
(1811) united tribes from Canada to Mexico and prepared to push the settlers back. The
British were more than happy to supply guns to the American Indians. William Henry
Harrison, U.S. governor of Indiana, led a band of militia toward Tecumseh’s headquarters 
on the Tippecanoe River while the chief was away gathering together his allies.
Tecumseh’s brother unwisely attacked the militia before the American Indians could get
together, telling the braves that his medicine-man powers would keep them from being
wounded. When magic didn’t stop the militia’s bullets, the American Indians fled, and
Tecumseh’s rebellion was over before it started. Tecumseh fought on, eventually charging
alone into the middle of an American army. An old American frontiersman helped the
American Indians give Tecumseh’s body an honored burial.

The U.S. versus Britain — version 1812
After being pushed around for years, the United States declared war on Great Britain in 1812.
The United States could hardly have been more divided; war resolutions barely passed in
Congress. The war was most popular in the South and in the Middle and Western states. New
England greeted the news of war with mourning.
The young United States faced a war with its old enemy Britain, still the most powerful
empire in the world. New England refused to let its militias fight and probably loaned more
money to Britain than to the U.S. government. New England food helped supply British
invaders from Canada.
How could New England, the hotbed of freedom and revolution, as well as a major shipping
area, turn against an American government that was determined to preserve the freedom of
international shipping? A lot of the answer was politics. New England was Federalist terri-
tory; the people there would rather lose a war than see Jefferson’s Republicans win. Faced
with the experienced British military, the young United States was in trouble trying to go to
war without the support of the whole country.
Like slipping on a banana peel and sliding into a gold mine, the War of 1812 was an embar-
rassment that turned out fine. New England didn’t want to fight; inexperienced American
troops often ran from a British army hardened by years of combat with Napoleon, and old
generals from the Revolutionary War proved that they needed to retire. U.S. invasions of
Canada failed miserably; the British army burned Washington, D.C., and the British navy
raided and blockaded.
The good news was that the United States got some victories to remember:
 The USS Constitution (Old Ironsides), with a crew that was one sixth free blacks, blew
away proud British ships.
 The star-spangled banner continued to wave over Baltimore Harbor and inspired the
national anthem.
 A thrown-together force of sailors, frontiersmen, free blacks, Frenchmen, and pirates
smashed a larger force of experienced British regulars to save New Orleans.
When the smoke cleared, the United States and Britain signed the Treaty of Ghent (1814),
without any formal gains for either side. The United States gained respect for standing up to
the great British Empire, and Americans felt a new sense of national pride.
It had been a close thing. Toward the end of the war, the Hartford Convention (1814) was an
angry meeting of the New England states demanding more power. Those states shut up when
news of the victory at New Orleans reached the capital at about the same time as their com-
plaints. Ironically, New England started all the talk about nullification and secession that
would become popular in the South with respect to the issue of slavery.
Hopeful in the Era of Good Feelings
With so many years of embargo and blockade, the United States had time to develop its own
industries. Following the war, Congress passed the protective Tariff of 1816, which taxed for-
eign imports to make American goods more competitive. Congressman Henry Clay launched
the American System (1824), which included easy credit, increased tariffs, and roads and
134

135
Chapter 10: You Say You Want a Revolution? Freedom and Change, 1776–1815
canals to move American products. An added bonus: Roads and canals were the most impor-
tant way to encourage settlement of the West.
Question: What were the most important new forms of transportation in the early 
United States?
Answer: Roads and canals were the most important new avenues of transportation.
James Monroe (1817), the last of the Revolutionary War soldiers to be president, served two
terms mellow enough to be called the Era of Good Feelings. Nothing with humans in it is
really mellow all the time; Monroe faced plenty of debate about tariffs, the Bank of the United
States, where and how to build canals and roads, and how much to charge for the sale of the
millions of acres of public lands that were up for grabs.
Whatever its political challenges, the nation was on a transportation roll. The Cumberland
Road began in 1811 and eventually stretched from Maryland to the frontier at Illinois. The
first steamboat to make it down the Ohio River and on to New Orleans also sailed in 1811.

 Getting the drop on Manifest Destiny
 Checking out Andy Jackson’s tough guy act
 Discovering how the Supreme Court shaped the law
 Connecting inventions to events in young America
T
he years between 1816 and 1845 were a time of tremendous growth and expansion for
the United States. In this chapter, you find out about events that changed the landscape
of the country, pointing the U.S. in the direction it still follows today. AP tests always have
questions on Jacksonian democracy; this chapter contains what you need to know to be
ready for them.
As you review this period of U.S. History, remember the power of PES: political events, eco-
nomic realities, and social trends (see Chapter 1). Don’t just memorize names, dates, and
places. When you see themes, connect them: Manifest Destiny was the social trend connected
to American Indian removal. The Gibbons v. Ogden decision on interstate commerce was the
economic reality brought about by the invention of the steamship and better transportation.
Jacksonian democracy was the consequence that stemmed from the shift toward more uni-
versal voting rights. Connect themes as you review so you’ll be ready to connect to a high
score on the big day.
Manifestin’ Destiny
You’re almost sure to see a question on the AP test about Manifest Destiny, a theme that runs
through much of U.S. History. Manifest Destiny means that lots of Americans felt God obvi-
ously meant for their country to control all the land between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
With the giant Louisiana Purchase speeding America toward the West Coast while the coun-
try was still only on its third president, the U.S. seemed to be on a transcontinental roll. (See
Chapter 10 for more on the Louisiana Purchase.)
Manifest means a fact any kid can tell just by looking at it (like it’s manifest that this book 
is meant to get you past the AP exam), and Destiny is a fate nobody can avoid. Because
Manifest Destiny meant that citizens of the U.S. would have to fight not just the British but
thousands of American Indians and Mexicans as well, a substantial minority of citizens was
against the idea at any given time and would have been just as happy to pass up the honor.
Many more thought America was doing the non-Americans a favor by forcibly inviting them
to the party.

Manifesting on the AP exam
For the AP exam, remember that Manifest Destiny showed up early in the 1800s, super-
charged by Jefferson’s huge Louisiana Purchase, and hung around until the U.S. finished
grabbing land during the Spanish-American War at the end of the 1800s. You can use the con-
cept as part of the official AP theme of American exceptionalism: Americans thought they
were so special that they deserved to rule the continent.
Hooking up Manifest Destiny to the big picture
When you think you’re driving Destiny’s limo, you’re on a mission, and nothing can get in
your way. To show this strong trend on an essay question, you could mention Manifest
Destiny in the context of the Trail of Tears (covered later in this chapter), the long trail West
(Chapter 12), and the willingness of both sides to fight to the death in the Civil War (Chapter
13), and as a cultural influence on America becoming a world power (Chapter 17). Hooking
up a trend to later events warms the heart of test-grading teachers.
On multiple-choice questions, watch out for wrong choices that tie Manifest Destiny to slav-
ery, independence, or an overseas empire. Manifest Destiny is just about territorial expan-
sion from the Atlantic to the Pacific, sometimes called overspreading the continent. Manifest
Destiny is part of the larger topic of American exceptionalism. Consider this when writing the
inevitable social history essay involving Manifest Destiny: All nations think they’re special;
powerful nations have in the past expressed their exceptionalism by taking over more land.
Manifest Destiny was an American expression of exceptionalism. Exceptionalism can be
good; feeling moral has inspired America to help other nations, and feeling free has led the
U.S. to support freedom for other people. You can still hear the ghost of Manifest Destiny/
exceptionalism in talk of using force to bring American values to other countries.
Even the name of the subject you’re studying changed from American History to U.S. History
to avoid sounding like exceptionalism. Professors realized, duh, 20 other countries in North
and South America have claim to being Americans, too. For easy understanding, I still refer to
U.S. citizens as Americans in this text, but be ready to write sensitively to score points on
essay questions.
Kick-Starting Political Action
History shows how social developments influence political outcomes. Factories allowed for
the growth of towns. The growth of towns provided a place for social movements like aboli-
tion, labor unions, and temperance organizations. Women who came together for the Second
Awakening got interested in women’s rights and abolition, often at the same time. (See
“Transcendentalism and the Second Great Awakening” later in this chapter.) The U.S. grew
and changed rapidly, which may explain why the country went through so many different
presidents, and why the Supreme Court gained so much power during this era.
Question: Some artists say, “I don’t care who makes the laws as long as I can write the 
songs.” How did social developments in the 1820s and 1830s influence the development 
of the United States?
Answer: In addition to the connections outlined just before this sample question, you 
can also point to the growth in Jacksonian democracy that brought down the Bank of 
the U.S. (see “War on the Bank of the U.S.”), the cotton farming that pushed American 
Indians off southern land (see “Slavery Grows with Cotton” and “Ethnic Cleansing, 
American-Style: The Trail of Tears”), and the improvements in transportation that 
allowed the spread of culture (see “Early Emo: Feeling in Art, Education, and Belief”).

The Presidential parade
Besides Andy Jackson, only one president in this period stuck around for a full two terms.
That would be James Monroe, Mr. Era-of-Good-Feelings (1817 to 1825). Other than presiding
over the Missouri Compromise and issuing the Monroe Doctrine, Monroe had a cruise (liter-
ally. He was the first president to ride on a steamboat.)
Other Presidents of this era:
 John Quincy Adams (1825–1829) had the honor of losing to Andy Jackson twice. The
first time, it didn’t take; Adams squeezed into the White House. (Check out the section
“Looking at the Back Story on Jackson” later in this chapter.) During his one term, the
U.S. got a ride on the Erie Canal and the Baltimore & Ohio railroad, revolutionizing
transportation.
 Andrew Jackson (1829–1837) was the superstar of this era and the godfather of
Jacksonian democracy. Andy threw such a big populist party on inauguration day that
he had to crawl out a back window of the White House to find a place to sleep. Check
out “Andy Jackson: Bringing Tough-Guy Democracy to Washington” later in this chap-
ter for more info.
 Martin Van Buren (1837–1841) had the bad luck to be president during the depression
economy following the Panic of 1837 and during the infamous Trail of Tears. With bad
vibes like that, one term was enough.
 William Henry Harrison (1841) didn’t even have time to get to the buffet. He delivered an
almost two-hour inauguration speech, caught pneumonia, and died. Vice President John
Tyler (1841–1845) took over, annexed Texas, fought against a national bank, and found time
to have 15 children. The population of the nation grew almost as fast as Tyler’s family.
The Marshall Court shows it’s supreme
The Supreme Court became a powerful third branch of government largely through the 34
years of service of John Marshall. Marshall was Chief Justice from when the United States
was a baby in 1801 until the country and its government were pretty grown up in 1835. In
Chapter 10, I discuss the establishment of judicial review with the Marbury v. Madison deci-
sion in 1803. Here are a few more key decisions from the Marshall era:
McCulloch v. Maryland: 1819
Maryland didn’t much like the Bank of the United States doing business in its state. Maryland
couldn’t shoot the bank, so it decided to tax the bank out of existence. James McCulloch, the
bank’s cashier, refused to pay tax to Maryland because his bank was chartered by the United
States government. Maryland said that it didn’t see anything in the U.S. Constitution about a
national bank and that the bank was therefore illegal and certainly couldn’t hide behind the
robes of the U.S. Supreme Court.
McCulloch v. Maryland held for implied powers in 1819. In its 1819 decision, John Marshall’s
court held that the Constitution doesn’t have to flat-out specify everything the government
can do; Congress has implied powers for Congress. After all, the Constitution says the U.S.
government can do anything “necessary and proper” to carry out its specifically listed
duties. In this case, the specific duties were to tax, borrow, and coin money. If the Marshall
court hadn’t established implied powers, the Feds wouldn’t be building roads or flying rock-
ets because none of that’s in the Constitution.
Cohens v. Virginia: 1821
Lotteries didn’t start behind the counter at the gas station; they were big business even in
the early days of the U.S. The Cohens got busted selling illegal lottery tickets, and they
139
Chapter 11: Rough and Tumble: The United States Grows Up, 1816–1845

appealed their Virginia criminal conviction to the Supreme Court. The Marshall court heard
the appeal and thus established the principle that state criminal decisions could be appealed
to the federal Supreme Court. This allows mobsters to yell: “Mess with me, and I’ll take you
all the way to the Supreme Court!”
Gibbons v. Ogden: 1824
Gibbons v. Ogden held for interstate commerce in 1824. Imagine if everybody in New York
had to pay one person to get to New Jersey. Aaron Ogden had that kind of a deal with New
York State; before the area had bridges, crossing meant taking Ogden’s boat or swimming.
Trouble was, Thomas Gibbons had a license from the Feds for the same route. Ogden sued
Gibbons, and the New York state court said Ogden had the power to stop the Fed’s guy
Gibbons. The federal Supreme Court said no way: Federal law is supreme, especially in inter-
state commerce (also known as trade that crosses state lines.)
You will see questions on Supreme Court decisions on the AP exam. Memorize the key deci-
sions, which you can find in Chapter 27.
Question: What Supreme Court decision established the principle of federal regulation of inter-
state commerce?
Answer: Gibbons v. Ogden determined that the federal government had jurisdiction over trade
that crossed state lines.
Nobody’s Happy: Missouri Compromise of 1820
As early as the beginning of the 1800s, the increasingly industrial Northern states and the
slaveholding agricultural Southern states were anxiously watching the balance of power
between them. They each had exactly 11 states, so the balance of power in the U.S. Senate
was even. Problem: Missouri wanted to be admitted as a slave state, throwing the balance of
power to the South. Henry Clay, the Great Compromiser, was sort of neutral because he came
from what was then the Wild West of Kentucky. He came up with this deal:
Missouri would come in as a slave state, but Maine would enter as a free state to keep the
balance. From then on, an imaginary line would cross the middle of the U.S. Any territory
north of that line would be free; anything south would be open to slavery. This was called the
Mason-Dixon line.
Question: What new free state was added as the result of the Missouri Compromise?
Answer: Under the Missouri Compromise, Maine entered the Union as a free state.
Neither side liked the Missouri Compromise (1820), but both sides lived with it for the next 
30 years. That makes it important and a cinch to get on the AP test. The Compromise led to
fights within the previously united Democratic-Republican party. Things had been so mellow
before the Missouri Compromise that the country had only one political party; the period
was even called the Era of Good Feelings. Afterwards, the good feelings wore off in a political
fight between Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams. The states’-rights issue had been
hidden in the closet with the failure of the Articles of Confederation (see Chapter 10). Now it
came out of the closet and became part of the law.
Remember, the Missouri Compromise is early — 1820 — and it deals directly only with
Missouri and Maine. It helps divide, not unite, the political process, but it remained the gen-
eral law of the land for 30 years. After that, the new Compromise of 1850 took over and dealt
with the Western states and the Fugitive Slave Law.

Keep Your Hands Off Our Hemisphere: 
The Monroe Doctrine
Although it had once been the playground of the European powers (see Chapters 8 and 9),
the New World of North and South America was relatively free of colonial ownership by 1820.
Following the American Revolution, most countries gained their independence from foreign
masters.
As a small but aspiring big dog, the United States wanted to keep it that way. To this end,
President James Monroe posted a stay-out warning on the Western Hemisphere to the rest of
the world. The Monroe Doctrine (1823) said the United States wouldn’t tolerate further
attempts by European powers (the only powers there then were) to colonize the New World.
That it worked in the 1800s was more bark than bite, but it established a precedent still cited
to this day.
Question: What was the Monroe Doctrine?
Answer: The Monroe Doctrine was a declaration issued by President James Monroe warning
European powers not to establish any more colonies in the New World.
Ethnic Cleansing, American-Style: 
The Trail of Tears
American renewal usually meant American Indian removal. In fact, President Andrew Jackson
made his reputation as a frontier American Indian fighter and signed a bill called the Indian
Removal Act in 1830. The act set aside a big share of the federal budget to have the Army
force all the American Indian tribes to move out of the fertile river valleys the settlers wanted
and into dusty prairies west of the Mississippi River. By 1850, most of the American Indians
east of the Mississippi were gone, forced to either move west or die along the way. For more
than 100,000 American Indians, including civilized tribes who had their own schools, newspa-
pers, and farms, this journey west was called the Trail of Tears (1838).
In 1832, the Supreme Court held for the American Indians in the case of Worcester v. Georgia.
A lot of anti-Manifest Destiny people applauded this decision, but that didn’t stop President
Jackson. He declared that Chief Justice John Marshall could say anything he wanted to, but
“let’s see him enforce it.”
After gunpoint negotiations, the Cherokee families were forced to leave their homes in 1838
to 1839 and walk the 1,200 mile Trail of Tears to barren land in Oklahoma. With no supplies,
half of the families died on the forced march to what was then called Indian Territory. Later
on, even that would be taken away from them (see Chapter 15).
Andy Jackson: Bringing Tough-Guy 
Democracy to Washington
Andrew Jackson never went to college, and he’s in good company — neither did Washington
or Lincoln. Although he wasn’t as nice a guy as Washington or Lincoln, he did usher in the
141
Chapter 11: Rough and Tumble: The United States Grows Up, 1816–1845

age of the common man. The emphasis here is on the word man, because Jacksonian democ-
racy certainly didn’t include blacks or women. But under Jackson, a majority of white men
voted for president for the first time; previously, you had to own property to vote in many
states.
Jackson was a self-made Western fighter with few ideas but strong convictions. He ignored
his appointed Cabinet officers and relied on the advice of a shifting group of buddies known
as the Kitchen Cabinet. He had no problem appointing friends to government jobs in what
was called the spoils system, as in “to the victor belong the spoils.” Jackson didn’t even think
this system was wrong because to him any man should be equal to doing any job. The
Founding Fathers said they believed in equality, but those were just words — most of them,
including Washington, were rich guys. Jackson made the little guys feel like they owned the
government.
After the U.S. allowed greater voting participation under Jacksonian democracy, it started to
have issues that until then had been swept under the parlor rug. These problems included
the right of individual states to nullify or ignore federal laws, fights within the administration,
and the future of an unpopular national bank.
Looking at the back story on Jackson
Andrew Jackson was a popular guy who had actually won the most votes for president in
1824, the first time the whole country voted directly for the presidential electors. Unfortunately
for him, he didn’t have a majority — the three other candidates pooled their support in the
House of Representatives to elect John Quincy Adams. Adams had ties to the beginning of
the country: His father was the second U.S. president.
Just say no, no, nullification
John Quincy Adams did what he could to protect the American Indians, but the pressure
from Jackson and his followers never let up. Plus, Adams had his hands full with a Civil War
prequel led by his own vice president (John Calhoun) protesting tariffs (federal taxes on
imports). Southerners called the 1828 tax the Tariff of Abominations because it made stuff
that Southern planters bought from overseas more expensive (and an abomination is some-
thing you consider hateful, which is how the South felt about the tariff). By beginning to chal-
lenge the right of the national government to make laws the South didn’t like, Southerners
came up with a political time bomb that would tick for 30 years until it blew up in the real
Civil War of 1861.
Here’s how the South saw the situation: The federal government was a collection of inde-
pendent states that had united under the catchy name United States to get a few things done.
If states felt like de-uniting over a certain issue, they could just sit that game out (or even
leave the team if necessary). Nullification (1830) meant any state could just refuse to follow
(as in nullify or declare null and void) any federal law with which it didn’t agree.
The nullification time bomb ticked on in a debate over selling cheap land to settlers in the
west. Jackson supported cheap land. He was the first president from outside the original 13
colonies, the first tough-guy frontiersman with no ties to the polite, educated founders of the
country. On the possibility of nullification, he had support from the best people. When states
talked about nullification if they didn’t get their way, famous Congressman Daniel Webster
spoke against it, crying, “Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!”
142
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

Threatening to hang the vice president over tariffs
Jackson was stuck with the same uncooperative Vice President Calhoun his rival John
Quincy Adams had endured (you can see why presidents now pick their own vice presi-
dents). Calhoun quit over a new tariff bill and went home to South Carolina, where he got an
Ordinance of Nullification passed ordering federal customs officials in that state to stop fol-
lowing federal law.
Old General Jackson never blinked; he had Congress authorize a Force Bill to use the army to
enforce the collection of taxes. Jackson talked loudly about hanging his former vice presi-
dent. Having learned a few things in politics, he also offered some cuts in the tariff. South
Carolina backed down, and both sides claimed victory.
War on the Bank of the U.S.
Currently, the U.S. has a Treasury Department that works with independent banks, but when
Jackson was president, it had an official Bank of the United States. Jackson hated the national
bank because it was tight about loaning money that expansion-minded Americans needed.
He abolished the bank and sold Western land to settlers on a low payment plan. When money
and good land started to run out, Jackson changed the rules to cash-only. That move burst
the real-estate bubble, and the country went into a recession that lasted for years beyond
Jackson’s presidency (and made voters think twice about tough-guy presidents).
Question: Which event best illustrates Andrew Jackson’s idea of expanded democracy?
Answer: Jackson saw the Bank of the U.S. as a rip-off by rich guys (and he wasn’t too far 
off). His abolition of the bank is a great example of his view of expanded democracy.
Watch out for smart-aleck professor questions on Jackson. He marks a turning point in U.S.
politics because he’s the first president to come from a Western state (Tennessee looked
Western back then), and he fought the American Indians, nullification, and the Bank of the
United States. Because we teachers like to have our cynical little laughs in the teacher’s
lounge, we often try to fool you with a multiple-choice question that has Jackson as a
founder of the country or in favor of one of the issues he fought. Don’t fall for it.
Embracing Modern Conveniences
In the days before today’s modern transportation, telephones, and TV, messages and prod-
ucts had to arrive on foot. The Battle of New Orleans took place after the War of 1812 was
over — the news of peace was a little slow getting around. You could own the best crops or
raw materials in the world, but having stuff wouldn’t do you any good if you couldn’t get it to
where somebody was ready to buy it. In the early days of the U.S., transportation moved as
slowly as it had thousands of years ago in the Roman Empire.
Several inventions helped the U.S. grow. In 1838, an Illinois blacksmith named John Deere
invented the steel plow, good for helping grow crops. For harvesting crops, Pennsylvania
farmer Cyrus McCormick invented a mechanical thresher that did the work of 15 men. A New
York painter named Samuel Morse invented the telegraph in 1844, and the world became
instantaneously connected. In new factories, the same kind of steam engines that chugged
along in boats and trains helped make new jobs.
143
Chapter 11: Rough and Tumble: The United States Grows Up, 1816–1845

These inventions changed the world more than battles, bills, or presidents. They’re concrete
examples of the non-political themes that will be the key to your success on the AP U.S.
History exam.
Got me a job in the factory
Commuting wasn’t really an issue before the Civil War. Most people worked where they 
lived: down on the farm. Sounds nice now, but back then for a lot of people it was boring and
made them a little short on cash. With improved transportation for products and steam
power to run machines, factories in New England began making cloth, tools, and guns. For
example, the whole town of Lowell, Massachusetts, popped up around a cloth factory that
supplied jobs for hundreds of Lowell girls who came from farms and immigrant ships begin-
ning in 1813.

People chose to work in factories and stores because, hard as the work was, it gave them
some freedom to change their lives. Before the Industrial Revolution, most of the money and
power belonged to the people who owned land. People were stuck where they were born:
lucky landholder or landless farm laborer. The Industrial Revolution gave people the chance
to move around, change jobs, and maybe even save up enough money to start a small busi-
ness. Most poor people stayed poor, but some of them managed to get ahead — in the U.S.,
no fixed social classes held them back. The Industrial Revolution, with all its pollution and
overwork, was the beginning of the American Dream.
Cruising along canals
The Dutch, French, and British all had big canal systems before the American Revolution.
The United States was late to the party but made up for it with enthusiasm, beginning in 1825
with the completion of the Erie Canal (1825), which connected over 300 miles between the
Hudson River in New York and Lake Erie. Between 1825 and 1840 the United States dug more
than 3,000 miles of canals. Making an artificial river may not seem that high tech, but canals
were a hundred times faster and stronger than trying to get little wagons down muddy and
often-frozen dirt roads. Before canals, crops and resources never got far from home; after
canals, the idea of a national marketplace emerged.
Churning the sea with steamships
In 1807, American inventor Robert Fulton (1810) built the double-paddle-wheeled steamboat
Clermont which went smoking up the Hudson River from New York way faster than a canal or
horse wagon. By the mid-1850s, steamboats driven by large paddle wheels were carrying pas-
sengers on all major U.S. rivers. Oceangoing steamships, constructed with strong iron hulls,
reduced the time needed to travel to Europe from weeks to days. The Savannah in 1819 was
the first ship equipped with a steam engine to cross the Atlantic Ocean. By 1838, several
steam-powered paddle wheelers were crossing the Atlantic, and in 1840, the first regularly
scheduled steamship service began.

Riding the rails
Canals got to be cool for only about 25 years, because railroads were faster and could go 
anywhere. In 1830, the first little American steam engine pathetically lost a race with a horse.
Getting it right didn’t take long: By 1840, the U.S. boasted 400 railroads and more miles of
track than canal. By the time of the Civil War, America was the railroad leader with close to
30,000 miles of track.
No guns necessary — it’s an industrial revolution
Industrial work was a new way of life — not exactly fun, but at least a ticket to town. Men,
women, and children worked 12-hour days, six days a week. The first labor unions origi-
nated to fight for better working conditions, but that battle took decades to win. Factories
made products people wanted, and people made money they needed to buy the products.
Skilled workers like steam engine builders, printers, and carpenters did much better than 
the more common unskilled workers, who had to take any job they could get and were easy
to replace.
The first Industrial Revolution in the United States started off, humbly enough, making thread
in small water-powered mills at the time of the American Revolution. Fast forward 30 years,
and steam-powered factories provided jobs off the farm for around 5 percent of the people.
This was the small beginning of the get-ahead capitalist spirit that still drives Americans.
Slavery Grows with Cotton
There was no American Dream during this period, only an endless nightmare for human
beings stolen from Africa and forced to work all their lives without pay as slaves. They were
beaten, raped, and killed with no protection and no hope for the future; they’d work until
they died, and their children were doomed to be slaves like them.
The irony of proclaiming freedom in a land where one out of four people were slaves wasn’t
lost on the leaders of the American Revolution. The U.S. banned the importation of new
slaves from Africa after 1808 and waited for what they called the peculiar institution to go
away, much like people now wait for someone else to fix global warming. Slavery was too
much a part of the country to deal with right away; eight of the first ten presidents owned
slaves. Enslaving people while fighting a revolution for freedom was bad, but then it got
worse.
While George Washington was president, a teacher named Eli Whitney invented a cotton
engine (cotton gin for short) that got the seeds out of cotton balls and allowed Southern plan-
tations to grow 50 times more cotton than they ever had before. Trouble was, without ready
labor or machinery, every 10 acres of cotton needed another slave to grow it.
A technical invention like the cotton gin led to millions of people being enslaved, and that
growth in slavery plus the social movement of abolition eventually brought about the Civil
War, which I discuss more thoroughly in Chapter 13.
145
Chapter 11: Rough and Tumble: The United States Grows Up, 1816–1845

Slavery becomes synonymous with power
Slavery became big money; by the Civil War, the U.S. had five times more enslaved people
than it did during the Revolution. A slave was worth as much in modern money as an SUV
costs today. The slave states had extra political power grandfathered into the Constitution —
slaves counted as 3⁄5 of a person in determining representation for slave states. This kind of
power forced careful balancing legislation like the Missouri Compromise outlined earlier;
slave state representatives wouldn’t even let the subject of abolition come up in Congress.
The few slave rebellions like that of Nat Turner in 1831 were put down with devastating force.
Most Southern states made it illegal for a slave to learn to read and write.
Waking up to the evil
Northern blacks lived with racism even though they weren’t technically slaves. Free blacks
had trouble finding jobs, schools, or places to live in the North. Eventually, as ex-slaves
learned to write and speak about conditions in the South, they began to gain Northern white
supporters. Some highlights:
 Frederick Douglass (1850) escaped from slavery in 1838 and wrote his moving life story.
 Harriet Tubman (1860) escaped ten years later and went back to help more than 300
other slaves (including her parents) make it safely to freedom.
 Both races worked together on the Underground Railroad (1855), sheltering former
slaves on the way to freedom.
 William Lloyd Garrison (1855), a white newspaper editor, and Sojourner Truth (1851), a
freed slave woman, both spoke eloquently in support of abolition.
Although most white Southerners were too poor to own slaves, they were willing to fight for
slavery anyway. In the North and West, opposition to slavery grew steadily stronger.
Early Emo: Feeling in Art, Education, and Belief
For the first time, ordinary people could learn about culture in free public schools. Before the
1830s, schools were mostly for rich kids — if you wanted to get an education, daddy had to
pay. Horace Mann started the common school movement of tax-supported mandatory free
education for all children. By the 1850s, every state outside the South had free education and
teacher training.
Advances in art and literature
In the 1820s, America got its own art after years of kissing up to Europe as the only seat of
real culture. The Hudson River School produced artists like Thomas Cole, who painted man
and nature in harmony along the Hudson River in rural upstate New York. George Caitlin
painted American Indians in natural settings, and John James Audubon did the same for
birds.
The U.S. cut a fine trail in literature as well; James Fenimore Cooper, Washington Irving,
Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, Herman Melville, and Henry David Thoreau (among
others) wrote influential works during this period that are still popular today.
146

Transcendentalism and the Second 
Great Awakening
Henry David Thoreau, author of Walden, shared a philosophy with his New England neighbor
Ralph Waldo Emerson: Transcendentalism. The Transcendentalists believed God was an inner
voice, leading people to do the right thing and live in harmony with nature, if they’d just
listen.
Strong feelings about spirituality were part of the Second Great Awakening, which encour-
aged that religion should be felt as well as thought. (America must have been taking a nap,
because even though the country was only a few years old, it was already on its Second
Awakening. For the story of the First Awakening in colonial America, see Chapter 9). Evangelists
traveled the country speaking at deeply spiritual meetings. This period also saw the birth of
Mormonism and the spread of the Methodist church, as well as the beginning of groups
devoted to abolition, education, and temperance.

A
merica was bursting at the seams in the 1840s. In one 10-year period, the country sud-
denly had 35 percent more people, including almost a million immigrants from Ireland
and half a million from Germany. The Irish mostly settled in Eastern cities and brought a
motivated labor force willing to do a lot of work for low pay. The Irish also expanded
Catholic churches and schools, making the mostly Protestant United States stretch to
include the Church of Rome into its accepted religious mix. The Germans went straight for
the good farmland of the Midwest and brought along the Christmas tree, German beer,
opposition to slavery, and support for public education, including kindergarten (a German
word).
The population surge was driven by revolutions in Europe (1848) and the potato famine (1845)
in Ireland; people were drawn to the United States by the promise of opportunity. Much of
this opportunity was created just by people who were looking for it, especially because the
United States needed both workers and consumers, and new inventions were ready to be
used.
Social history, like much of the information covered in this chapter, scores points on the big
AP exam. Knowing the leaders of the women’s-rights and abolition movements, for example,
is huge. You’re sure to find multiple-choice questions in these areas, and you should be able
to work these topics into essay answers. The authors and poets mentioned in this chapter
and elsewhere in the book are extra-credit items. The test probably won’t have many 
multiple-choice questions about art, but showing that you know how literature fits into the
American story in essays rings college bells. Hint: American literature gets more up-front on
issues of race and gender as Americans challenge the conventions they inherited from the
Old World.
Changing Lives with New Inventions
Eli Whitney was only getting started when he invented the cotton gin in 1793 (see Chapter
11). He went on to pioneer the concept of interchangeable-parts manufacturing (1800) by
making identical musket guns with identical parts for the Army. Up till then, guns were hand-
made, with each part machined to fit only its own rifle. After Whitney had his second bright
idea, you could trade triggers or barrels without risking an embarrassing misfire just as the

bear was getting ready to eat you. This bright idea led to a surge in inventions and manufac-
turing that would become prevalent between the mid-1840s and 1850s.
Interchangeable parts supported mass production, which Northern factories had down by
the 1850s. Whitney’s cotton gin allowed the South to become a rich slave empire and spurred
him on to greater inventions. His interchangeable parts allowed the North to become an even
richer manufacturing empire, complete with the rifle power the North needed to defeat the
Southern slavers in the Civil War. You could say Whitney solved the problem his cotton gin
created in the first place.
Producing in mass in factories
The North wasn’t just making guns. The Singer sewing machine (1846) revolutionized clothes-
making; it was the first practical way to sew clothes without making everything by hand. You
pumped the first sewing machine with your foot; electricity wasn’t available. Even made with
interchangeable parts, however, the sewing machine was still expensive. Singer revolution-
ized the way products were sold by allowing families to buy the new sewing machine on time
payments. This system magically linked the first must-have home technology with the first
must-pay credit debt. Before the mid-1800s, most purchases had to be made with cash up
front.
Mass production also sped the introduction of the reaper (1834), which Cyrus McCormick
manufactured to allow one man riding on a horse-drawn machine to cut as much wheat as
five men swinging the hand scythes that had been the only way to harvest grain since the
days of the Romans. This invention allowed the extensive large-scale agriculture that made
the Midwest rich. Even an invention as humble as John Deere’s steel plow (1837) greatly
improved food-growing by reliably turning the soil for better crops.
Making electricity useful: Telegraphs
Samuel Morse was the first person to put electricity to work with the invention of the tele-
graph (1844). For the first time, news could travel across the nation in seconds, not weeks.
The talking wire drew opinions closer together in the decade before the Civil War. Getting
instant feedback may actually have heightened the disagreements between North and South.
Morse’s telegraph got an international boost with the laying of the Atlantic cable to Britain.
The cable broke before the Civil War but was restored permanently right afterward. The tele-
graph reached the West Coast in 1861.
Making Strides in Transportation
In the early years after the Revolution, you could get out and walk if you didn’t like the roads.
Or maybe you could swim; early roads turned to giant mud puddles when it rained. Horses
and wagons got stuck up to the middle, and drivers would have to crawl through mud to get
food to feed the stuck animals while they waited for help. Once in a while, a carriage would
just sink out of sight. But highways, canals, and railroads soon came along, allowing farm
products to get to big-city markets and urban inventions to get to people everywhere. By the
1850s stagecoaches and the Pony Express crossed the country. Clipper ships sailed the
oceans faster than steamships could. The world was getting more and more connected.
150
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

Traveling the long and winding road
The first transportation break came with the privately owned Lancaster Turnpike (1795), 
60 miles of hard-surface road heading west from Philadelphia. In 1811, the federal govern-
ment began to build the Cumberland (or National) Road from Maryland. By 1852, the road
stretched across the old Northwest territory to Illinois and was the beginning of many a
wagon train. Most roads were dirt or logs placed side by side (a very bumpy ride). Even 
city streets were mostly unpaved. During a particularly wet and muddy time in San
Francisco, a citizen erected a sign that warned his city street was “not passable, not even
jackass-able.”
Creating canals
Robert Fulton’s pioneering idea of a steamboat (1807) on New York’s Hudson River (see
Chapter 11) proved even more valuable on the great Mississippi. As early as 1820, 60 steam-
boats regularly traveled on the Mississippi; by the time of the Civil War, the big river had the
regular service of 1,000 boats. This type of transportation led to settlement; people could get
their crops to market, and the local stores could get manufactured stuff to make life a little
easier.
With the beginning of the Erie Canal (1817), Americans started to make the rivers come to
them. Hooking up to the Hudson River at Albany, the Erie Canal went all the way to the Great
Lakes. What used to cost a dollar to ship now cost a nickel. Rocky New England farms couldn’t
compete with the lush produce of New York and Pennsylvania floating into town on canal
boats. New England farmers either moved west to the land along the canal path or worked in
growing industries — the first sign of how better transportation could hurt as well as help
local producers.
Having made their own rivers with the canals, the states began to get over the need for a
water path. The first railroad (1828) chugged along three years after the Erie Canal was fin-
ished. By 1850, the northern United States was more interconnected by rails than it was by
canals. The cotton-growing South started to build late; by the Civil War, the South had just a
skeleton of railroads, whereas the North had a spider web. For more about railroads, see
Chapter 14.
Dealing with Social Change
With all the freedom and change, sometimes a new idea for utopia seemed to be around
every American corner. But these perfect worlds were a little hard to live in — not surpris-
ingly, because utopia, from Thomas More’s fantasy novel Utopia (1516), meant no place.
Improved communication brought about by the telegraph and more efficient travel (dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter) didn’t always lead to improved understanding. The South saw
strengthened trading ties along the Mississippi and across the Atlantic as economic insur-
ance that outsiders would have to allow slavery to continue to support Northern and British
profits. Difficult as perfection was to achieve, however, people in the United States kept
moving in what they saw as the right direction.
151
Chapter 12: From Sea to Shining Sea: 1846–1854

Doing the right thing
Here are some of the major social movements that started in the mid 1800s:
 The first women’s rights conference was held in Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848.
 The first large labor unions started in the 1840s.
 Dorothea Dix (1845) published reports that led to so many reforms in mental institu-
tions that she was made superintendent of nurses for the Union Army during the Civil
War. Women and men worked to reform treatment of prisoners and the mentally ill.
 Neal Dow (1851) got a prohibition law passed in Maine and ten other states; these laws
were rescinded when the stress of fighting the Civil War made lots of people need a
drink.
 Utopian communities were established in several places in the U.S. Named for Thomas
More’s novel, utopian communities tried to build happy places to live and work by cre-
ating a new social structure. Among the hopeful utopias were
• New Harmony (1825). On the Wabash River in southern Indiana, New Harmony
produced limited perfect community but lots of education. The progress of ento-
mology, geology, and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington are all associated
with this attempt by Welsh industrialist Robert Owen to build a better world.
• Brook Farm (1841) near Boston had a literary influence from authors like Henry
Thoreau and Nathaniel Hawthorne. They were better at writing than at farming.
• The Oneida Community (1848) in New York practiced community marriage and
shared jobs and child raising. Although the commune broke up, the members
went on to found Oneida Silver, one of the largest silverware companies in the
world.
• Mother Ann Lee of the Shakers (1840) at one time inspired 19 different communi-
ties making furniture and other housewares that are still in demand. Since
Shakers didn’t have children, they’ve largely died out. The Shaker song “Simple
Gifts” is still sung to remind people of quiet peace.
Moving from farm to factory
Life wasn’t all domestic bliss, of course. Thousands of hungry workers shifted from job to job
and city to city. Workers were needed almost everywhere during the fast-growing 1840s and
1850s; they were rewarded with wages that grew slowly but steadily.
Factory owners tried to meet increased demand and improve their incomes by working fac-
tory employees for 13 or 14 hours a day. Unions weren’t legally allowed to organize until the
1840s, and the “easy” 10-hour day, long fought by employers, slowly started to be accepted.
The willingness of single men to do whatever it took to earn a living and support the nation
without turning into a mob was a key reason the United States grew so much during this
time. Peaceful, willing workers without families — an often-overlooked strength of any 
society — made up half the labor force.
Going to school: Public education 
and one-room schoolhouses
Public schools were growing against a very real backlash among people who thought educa-
tion was wrong, at least if they had to pay for it.
152
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

As late as 1860, the United States had only about 100 real high schools. Education got a boost
from Noah Webster (1828), whose reading lessons and dictionary taught Americanism as well
as letters. McGuffey’s Readers (1850) taught patriotism along with language and were used all
over the country for 100 years. Horace Mann (1850) established the model for free public
education that eventually spread across the country.
Don’t confuse Noah Webster (1758–1843), the teacher and dictionary-maker, with Daniel
Webster (1782–1852), legendary congressman and leader of national compromise. Noah
brought people together with a common approach to language; Daniel tried to keep the
Union together with common laws. Noah got his name on almost every American dictionary;
Daniel wasn’t around to see his compromise laws fall apart in the years before the Civil War.
As the country expanded, public education was a proud part of most new settlements. The
little red one-room schoolhouse got its start teaching farm kids the three Rs: reading, ’riting,
and ’rithmetic. All the grades were in one room, and some kids could spare only a few
months to learn in between helping out with the crops.
Oberlin College (1837) in Ohio was the first college to admit women and blacks; Ohio’s
Antioch College (1852) had the first female faculty member. The fact that Oberlin College’s
second president was the famous Great Awakening preacher Charles Finney (1840) (a com-
mitted abolitionist, early champion of women’s rights, and the most powerful revivalist in an
age of renewed faith) and Antioch’s first president was Unitarian educator Horace Mann
demonstrates the connection between religious revival and social action at that time.
Expanding religious diversity
In 1850, three out of four Americans attended church every Sunday. The idea that one sect
contained all the special people and that everyone else was going to hell had loosened up 
as the United States learned to live with many different denominations. The Enlightenment-
inspired founding fathers hadn’t been all that big on religion, but they — and members of
new American movements like the Unitarians, Transcendentalists, and Mormons — certainly
did believe that spiritual and material life could be improved right here on Earth.
The Second Great Awakening (1830), a powerful nationwide spiritual movement put the
emphasis on salvation through personal change (see Chapter 9 for information on the First
Great Awakening). Both the spirit of the movement and the connections that people made at
tent meetings helped found several middle-class movements, often led by women, including
those for temperance, prison, asylum reform, abolition, and women’s rights. Methodists,
Baptists, Mormons, and members of other new religions gained strength, and members of
America’s first religions, such as the Congregationalists and Anglicans (see Chapter 11), loos-
ened up. The Second Great Awakening stressed perfectionism, the belief that free will can
create a better life on Earth. Free will Perfectionism encouraged reform movements and was
directly opposed to the original Puritan belief in predestination.
Question: Why was the belief in perfectionism important in the Second Great Awakening?
Answer: Perfectionism supported social movements, presented the idea that free will could
improve life, and marked a departure from the Puritan belief in predestination.
Question: What were the social movements that came out of the Second Great Awakening?
Answer: The women’s-rights, antislavery, temperance, and education movements were all 
supported by middle-class women coming out of the Second Great Awakening.
The notion of predestination (see Chapter 8) faded away in favor of emotional activism.
Middle-class women were enthusiastic revivalists, charged up by spiritual services and the
community of believers. Their awakened talents helped spur both religious and social
causes. No social cause received more attention than slavery. By 1845, the issue of slavery
153
Chapter 12: From Sea to Shining Sea: 1846–1854

split national denominations like the Methodist and Baptist churches into Northern and
Southern branches. First the churches split, then the political parties, and finally the nation.
Earning Expanded Roles for Women
Women didn’t get much education in the early days beyond what you would need to make a
shopping trip. Male physicians said that too much learning could injure the female brain. By
1850, around 20 percent of all women had worked outside the home by the time they were
married. After they were married, women didn’t work; they were locked inside the house-
hold. Women seemed to be trapped on a pedestal: They were supposed to be more morally
refined than men but were limited to being the keepers of families. They got some input on
social responsibility with the cult of domesticity (1850), which held that, by being virtuous,
women could change the world through their families.
Gaining control of their own lives
Of little breakthroughs is freedom made. Under the belief in republican motherhood (1780) at
the time of the Revolution (see Chapter 9), women were valued as teachers of children, espe-
cially the sons who were needed for the new democracy. With the cult of domesticity, how-
ever, women began to use their power as queens of the household to make decisions about
things that mattered outside the family as well. They gained more power to plan children and
choose their own mates; families arranged fewer marriages.
Question: What were the positive benefits of the cult of domesticity for women?
Answer: American women gained power from the 1700s to 1860 as they moved from
republican motherhood to the cult of domesticity. Changes in women’s rights over this
time included their own choice of husbands, activism outside the home, and more con-
trol over childbearing.
Women were often factory workers, and they participated in early union activities. As public
education spread in the 1840s, the hitherto male profession of teaching began to admit some
females. Women could also work as cooks or maids. About one Northern family in ten was
rich enough to pay a domestic servant to help with the housework.
Women had only half as many children during the 1800s as during the 1700s; family planning
was beginning to take hold. Couples used timing and early barrier methods to keep from 
getting pregnant. These methods had been passed down for hundreds of years; in the mid-
1800s, women just got more assertive about using them. With fewer children, mothers could
spend more time rearing their kids. The idea of helping children develop began to take hold;
parents no longer just survived the rugrats until they could be sent out into the fields.
Founding women’s rights
As women got some power, they wanted more. Lucretia Mott and Susan B. Anthony were
Quakers who stood up for women’s rights. Mott fought for women and abolition from the
1820s until after the Civil War, and Anthony carried the movement into the 1900s. Elizabeth
Cady Stanton was a mother of seven who insisted, with the full support of her husband, on
leaving the word obey out of her marriage ceremony. Stanton and Mott were leaders of the
groundbreaking Seneca Falls Convention (1848), which proclaimed the rights of women. Seneca
Falls was the first meeting of women to adopt a program designed to lead to votes for women.
The Convention’s Declaration of Sentiments echoed the U.S. Declaration of Independence.
154
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

Watching the Arts Bloom
Art defines a culture, and culture is a pretty good predictor of the actions people will take. In
the 1800s, the United States developed a national culture of music and writing that helped
the young country identify its own character.
Stephen Foster and the American songbook
Stephen Foster (1850) was one of the most popular composers in American history and 
the only songwriter to try to make a living from the art until modern times. He wrote “Oh!
Susanna,” “Camptown Races,” “My Old Kentucky Home,” “Beautiful Dreamer,” and “Old Folks
at Home (Swanee River)” — songs so popular 150 years after their composition that an
album of them won a Grammy award in 2005.
Showing how thoroughly mixed American culture was on the eve of the nation’s tearing itself
apart in the Civil War, Foster wrote about the South but was from the North. The man who
wrote the music used in the North’s “Battle Hymn of the Republic” was from South Carolina.
“Dixie,” the theme song of the South, was written in New York City by a Northerner.
The rise of American literature
American literature came onto its own with the increased popularity of Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow, Walt Whitman, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and many others:
 Emerson was a giant of American letters for almost 50 years. His Transcendentalist
(1840) philosophy stressed self-reliance and personal spiritual unity.
 Emerson’s friend and colleague Henry David Thoreau wrote Walden (1854), about
man’s connection to nature, and On the Duty of Civil Disobedience (1849), a book that
influenced Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.
 Walt Whitman wrote Leaves of Grass (1855), which broke down the conventions of
poetry with bold language:
“Fresh and strong the world we seize, world of labor and the march, 
Pioneers! O Pioneers!”
 Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1850) was an American poet who was also widely popular
in Europe. He wrote “Paul Revere’s Ride,” “A Psalm of Life,” “The Song of Hiawatha,”
“Evangeline,” and “Christmas Bells.”
 John Greenleaf Whittier (1838) was a poet of human freedom who stood up to angry
mobs for the abolition of slavery.
 Louisa May Alcott showed the man-centered Victorian world that women can write
beautifully with Little Women (1868).
 Emily Dickinson (1870) showed the universality of even a quiet human heart with more
than 1,000 poems published after her death.
Not all writers saw much good in human beings. All these darker writers served a good pur-
pose in helping the world see that good and evil are never pure and that living well means
making moral choices every day:
 Edgar Allan Poe (1845) lived on the dark side of madness and evil with stories like “The
Fall of the House of Usher” and poems like “The Raven.”
155
Chapter 12: From Sea to Shining Sea: 1846–1854

 Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote The Scarlet Letter (1850), about a woman who had a secret
affair with a minister, bore his child out of wedlock, and had to wear a scarlet A for
adultery.
 Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick (1851), one of the greatest American novels, tells the
story of a sea captain’s obsessive hunt for a great white whale.
Painting began to show the beauty of the American landscape. The Hudson River School,
active from 1850 to 1875, painted dramatic American landscapes, especially featuring the
Hudson River area in northern New York. This movement made more people stop to appreci-
ate the wonders of nature.
Question: What was the Hudson River School of painting?
Answer: The Hudson River School painted dramatic American landscapes, especially
featuring the Hudson River area in northern New York.
Understanding Early Ethnic Group Issues
As a nation started on the ringing words of freedom, the United States was never proud of
slavery, even though many of its founding fathers owned slaves. Like a bad habit you mean
to give up next year, slavery just kept getting bigger and harder to shake. Opposition to the
peculiar institution (as slavery was politely called) grew in the North, which didn’t have any
slaves. In the South, it was considered too profitable to be publicly debated.
A similar moral double standard affected grabbing land from American Indians and foreign
governments. What started out as 13 states grateful for their own freedom turned into a 
continent-wide rush for more territory. See Chapters 10 and 11 for more information.
The Indian Removal Act (1830) provided federal assistance to move more than 100,000
American Indians from their ancestral homes east of the Mississippi to the specially created
Indian Territory in what’s now Oklahoma. The government was supposed to supply food and
transportation help with the forced migration, but many died on the long trek.
In the Trail of Tears (1838), 17,000 Cherokee were forced to travel 1,200 miles to Oklahoma
from their homes in Georgia. More than 4,000 of the American Indians died in concentration
camps or on the trail itself. In the southern U.S., the Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, and
Seminole tribes were relocated in addition to the Cherokee. In the north, evicted tribes
included the Shawnees, Ottawas, Potawatomis, Sauks, and Foxes. Chief Black Hawk led
American Indians back to their homes in Illinois to fight for their land, but they were defeated
by the army.
Expansion by war occurred with the Mexican-American War (1846). Texas gained independ-
ence from Mexico in 1835 and joined the United States in 1845. With the excuse of a border
dispute and the real desire for more land, the U.S. declared war on Mexico in 1846. After
some tough fighting, the U.S. defeated Mexico and in 1849 got California and all of the
Southwest.
Irish, Polish, and Italian immigrants weren’t always welcomed by all the people in the land of
the free. The Know-Nothing Party campaigned against Catholic immigration in the 1850s.
Signs for jobs often said, “No Irish Need Apply”. When Irish workers hungry for jobs replaced
striking women textile employees in New England, prejudice against the new immigrants
soared. Italian and Polish immigrants often spent generations living in ethnically segregated
communities. In the years before the Civil War, multi-ethnic neighborhoods and towns 
were rare.

Question: How did textile mill owners inflame prejudice against the Irish?
Answer: New England textile mills replaced striking local workers with Irish immigrants.
The economics of slavery
Northern ships carried Southern cotton to market in Britain and New England. To a large
degree, the extra profits of merchants in all parts of the United States before the Civil War
depended on the crushing work of slaves.
Cotton represented half the value of all U.S. exports in the years before the Civil War. The
profits of slave labor didn’t stop at the border: About one of five jobs in Britain was tied to
manufacturing cotton cloth, most of it from raw cotton grown in the American South.
Southerners assumed that Britain would have to support them in any break with the North
to keep Britain’s vital supply of cotton raw materials coming.
Thomas Jefferson, slaveholder, said this about slavery: “The whole commerce between
master and slave is a perpetual exercise of . . . despotism on the one part and degrading sub-
missions on the other. . . . I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; that his 
justice cannot sleep forever.” People often see more than a little moral disconnect between
Jefferson’s proclamations against slavery and the fact that he kept slaves. Sadly Jefferson —
a good president but a poor businessman — couldn’t free his slaves in his will. He had mort-
gaged them to get enough money to live on.
Fewer than 2,000 families in the South owned more than 100 slaves. Three of four families
owned no slaves at all. Because the South was basically a one-crop economy, even large
landowners could suffer reversals when that crop did poorly.
The South was at the mercy of the North for basic manufactured supplies; even cotton cloth-
ing came from New England. Most immigrants avoided the South so they wouldn’t have to
compete with slave labor on the one hand and rich landowners on the other. That situation
left the South short of new blood and any kind of cheap labor except slavery.
Even slavery could be a money-loser. A slave cost as much as $80,000 in modern money. If
slave traders missed the market or some of their charges died, they were in trouble fast.
Economically as well as morally, the slavery/cotton empire was a bet with the devil. It contin-
ued to be very profitable right up to the time of the Civil War, but it was a house of cards.
In a seeming paradox, some of the strongest supporters of slavery were the small Southern
farmers who owned no slaves. On closer examination, this situation is no paradox at all. The
small farmers had someone to look down on in the slaves who lived around them and a shal-
low brotherhood of white people with their richer neighbors. The poor whites could look for-
ward to the day when they could get ahead enough to turbocharge their earnings by buying
a slave or two. It was a sick application of the American dream of upward mobility.
Problems faced by free blacks of the era
About 250,000 free blacks lived in the South and another 250,000 in the North. Blacks gained
freedom through Northern emancipation laws and the occasional goodwill of Southern
owners; their children were then free as well. They were in a precarious position. Free blacks
couldn’t testify in court. If they were assaulted by whites, unless other whites showed up to
defend them (which was rare), the blacks never got justice. In the South, they were in con-
stant danger of being kidnapped into slavery. In the North, mobs of poor Irish and other
157
Chapter 12: From Sea to Shining Sea: 1846–1854

immigrants who resented the competition from free blacks for low-wage jobs often beat them
up. Blacks couldn’t go to most white schools, stores, or churches. Frederick Douglass, the
distinguished black abolitionist, was beaten by Northern rowdies more than once.
Question: How did some blacks become free before the Civil War?
Answer: The number of free blacks in the United States grew because Northern states
ended slavery, some Southern slaveholders freed their slaves after the Revolution or in
their wills, and freed blacks had children who were then themselves free.
Blacks fought for their own freedom whenever they could. They didn’t have much opportu-
nity to fight back; slaves were guarded and whipped for the slightest infraction. Informant
slaves who brought news of any trouble were rewarded and potential troublemakers pun-
ished without mercy. Even walking on the road at night could spell death to a black man who
didn’t have a ready excuse. Despite these barriers, at least 11 slave revolts were attempted
from colonial times to the Civil War:
 In 1800, an armed insurrection in Richmond led by a tall, strong blacksmith slave
named Gabriel was foiled by informants. Gabriel had carefully planned to take
Virginia’s governor (later president) James Monroe hostage and ask for freedom for
slaves in the name of the American Revolution. He was questioned under torture but
refused to submit. He, two of his brothers, and 24 others were hanged. After Gabriel’s
bid for freedom, Virginia kept slaves under tight surveillance.
In 2007, Virginia governor Tim Kaine informally pardoned Gabriel and his co-
conspirators. The modern governor said that Gabriel’s motivation had been “his 
devotion to the ideals of the American Revolution; it was worth risking death to secure
liberty.” The governor noted that “Gabriel’s cause — the end of slavery and the further-
ance of equality of all people — has prevailed in the light of history.” He added, “It is
important to acknowledge that history favorably regards Gabriel’s cause while consign-
ing legions who sought to keep him and others in chains to be forgotten.”
 In 1822, Denmark Vesey, who had managed to buy his freedom after winning a city lot-
tery, was within days of launching a revolt that could have included more than 1,000
slaves in Charleston. Vesey had been able to plan the revolt because he was a free
black who worked as a carpenter. He had tried to live with whites, but he was angry
because they had repeatedly closed the black church he had helped start. Betrayed by
frightened slaves, Vesey and more than 30 of his followers were hanged. Vesey’s son
survived to reopen the black church after the Civil War.
 Nat Turner was a black slave who could read and who served as a preacher. He had
visions that told him to fight for freedom, and in 1831, he led a rebellion of at least 100
slaves in Virginia. The slaves fought for 2 days, killing around 60 white civilians, before
they were defeated by an overwhelming force of soldiers, sailors, and militiamen who
rushed in from all directions.
After the battle, Virginia actually debated proposals to end slavery but decided to go
the other way instead. The state forbade teaching a slave to read and instituted regular
slave patrols that stopped any blacks found on the roads.
Abolition in the North
The movement for the abolition of slavery began with calls for freedom from Quakers and
Mennonites before the Revolution. An American Colonization Society was formed in 1817 to
send blacks back to their now-forgotten home; a few years later, the society founded the
Republic of Liberia on the west coast of Africa.
158
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

In 1832, a rare group of people got together at Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati and
held an 18-day debate on slavery. They included Theodore Weld, who had been evangelized
by Charles Finney, the same Great Awakening preacher who would go on to be president of
Oberlin College. Based on what he learned from slaves just across the river from Cincinnati
in Kentucky, Weld wrote American Slavery As It Is (1839). He greatly influenced a young lady
whose father was the head of the seminary.
That young lady was Harriet Beecher Stowe, and she would go on to write the best-selling
novel of the 1800s: Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1852). That book burst upon society like a star shell,
lighting up thinking all over the North. It sold more than 300,000 copies in its first year.
Watching thousands of stage productions in every little town in the North, people in the audi-
ence gasped as Eliza carried her son across the shifting river ice to freedom and cried at the
death of kindly Uncle Tom. Showing the power of an idea whose time has come, Uncle Tom’s
Cabin crystallized opposition to slavery in the North. For more information about Uncle
Tom’s Cabin, see Chapter 13.
On New Year’s Day 1831, uncompromising publisher William Lloyd Garrison, another spiri-
tual child of the Great Awakening, launched the antislavery newspaper The Liberator. He said,
“I will be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice.” The cause soon had black
heroes:
 Sojourner Truth, a freed black woman in New York, fought for both emancipation and
women’s rights.
 Frederick Douglass, an eloquent escaped slave, wrote his early life story in Narrative of
the Life of Frederick Douglass (1845). He went on to be a respected spokesman for
blacks through the Civil War and for years after.
Question: Who was William Lloyd Garrison?
Answer: Garrison was the uncompromising abolitionist who founded the antislavery
newspaper The Liberator.
Abolitionists were beaten, burned out of their houses, and sometimes killed, but they didn’t
back down. At first, wise politicians like Abraham Lincoln avoided them, but by the 1850s
their cause was beginning to be accepted in the North. With the birth of the Republican
Party in 1854, that cause found a national voice. See Chapter 13 for more information on the
rise of abolition.
Acquiring More Land for America
Destiny hadn’t finished manifesting itself at the beginning of the 1840s, but after that, the
United States picked up a lot of land in a short time. First came the lumberjack battles in
northern Maine called the Aroostook War (1842). These battles were settled with the British
masters of Canada in a way that left Maine with plenty of north woods, Canada with room to
build a winter road to Quebec, and the U.S. with the nice surprise of major iron deposits in
Minnesota.
As outlined earlier, Texas won its independence from Mexico in 1836, but between then and
1845, Texans had to cool their heels down on the border while Congress debated whether to
admit Texas as a slave state. In 1845, Texas switched from being the Lone Star Republic to
being the 28th star in the American flag. Mexico couldn’t stand the transition of their former
territory to the United States and war broke out soon after.
159
Chapter 12: From Sea to Shining Sea: 1846–1854

One of Andrew Jackson’s last political acts was recommending his friend and neighbor James
Polk as the Democratic presidential nominee in 1844. Polk was victorious over a terminally
frustrated Henry Clay and efficiently carried out his four-point presidential agenda: lower tar-
iffs, establish an independent treasury, grab California, and settle the Oregon border.
Polk got legislation to lower the tariffs and restore an independent treasury. Then he went to
work on grabbing California and the Oregon Territory. In 1846, the British settled the Oregon
Territory question by splitting the difference with the United States on the northern border
of what became the state of Washington.
California looked beautiful even before gold was discovered in 1848. Its inhabitants included
around 13,000 Mexicans, 1,000 Americans more or less poaching on Mexican territory, and
100,000 American Indians. Polk managed to stir up a border incident with an angry Mexico
down on the Rio Grande in Texas, and the Mexican-American War was under way in 1846.
The war was unpopular in New England; Henry David Thoreau spent a night in jail to 
protest it.
Most of the rest of the country was spoiling to finish off Manifest Destiny with a good fight.
The renegade Americans in California seized the province, aided by Captain John Fremont,
who just happened to be in the neighborhood with an armed patrol.
An American army fought its way into Mexico City by September 1847. Mexico reluctantly
signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848), turning over an area that amounted to about a
third of the United States in exchange for $18 million (offered rather guiltily by the United
States). When the treaty was signed, neither side knew that gold, ultimately worth billions of
dollars, had been discovered 9 days earlier on the American River in California.
Sliding Closer to Civil War
An enormous new piece of the United States meant an enormous fight over whether it would
be slave or free. Almost all the free states passed resolutions called the Wilmot Proviso
(1846), an anti-slavery move calling for all the new land to be admitted as free states. This
contentious amendment easily passed the U.S. House of Representatives but couldn’t get
through the carefully balanced Senate.
Question: What was the first resolution to split the North and South on the slavery
issue?
Answer: The Wilmot Proviso of 1846 was the first purely sectional vote (which never
passed) to block extending slavery to territory acquired from Mexico.
Politically, the South was fighting with its back to the wall. The free-state population now far
outnumbered that of slave states, even with the three-fifths provision for nonvoting slaves
(see Chapter 10). Therefore, the North had more votes in the House, and if more free states
were admitted, it soon would have more votes in the Senate as well. The South couldn’t back
down.
Meanwhile, hatred for slavery had reached the point in the North at which many people
couldn’t stand the thought of creating another state under the grip of slaveholders. The
Mexican land was becoming a gigantic poison pill for compromise in the Union.
In the election of 1848, the Whigs ran a hero of the Mexican-American War, Gen. Zachary
Taylor. Taylor had no political liabilities, having never held public office or, for that matter,
160
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

even voted in a presidential election. The Democrats ran an old veteran of the War of 1812
who believed in popular sovereignty (1850), the principle of letting the people of any territory
decide whether they wanted the territory to be slave or free.
Question: What is popular sovereignty?
Answer: Popular sovereignty allowed local voters to choose whether their state would
be slave or free.
A new Free Soil Party came out squarely against the extension of slavery to even one more
square inch of the United States. The Free Soilers diverted enough votes from the Democrats
to elect Zachary Taylor of the Whig party. Taylor hadn’t made any speeches about slavery
during the election, but he was a slaveholding plantation owner from Louisiana. That was
enough to attract most Southern votes.
With the discovery of gold, California rushed toward statehood as a free state. The territory
had plenty of people, had written its own constitution, and was ready to more than pay for
itself. But if California were admitted, the balance in the Senate would swing to a majority for
the nonslave states.
The Southerners were also stressing about the issue of runaway slaves. They had plenty to
be steamed about:
 Harriet Tubman (1849), a fearless runaway slave, had helped rescue more than 300
other slaves from the South, including her aging parents.
 The Underground Railroad (1850), a series of safe houses and hiding places for escaping
slaves, was helping a small number of slaves escape. The total number of slaves who
made it North in a year was around 1,000 — a small loss to freedom from a slave popu-
lation of 4 million.
The South was also steamed about the North’s nonstop campaign to outlaw slavery in the
nation’s capital, Washington, D.C. The South was whirling around, looking for a fight almost
as though it had a guilty conscience.
The Compromise of 1850
The situation didn’t come to fighting yet. Most Northerners in 1850 were willing to let slavery
remain in the South, as long as it didn’t spread to other states. The old peacemakers of the
Congress, Henry Clay (73), Daniel Webster, and Southerner John Calhoun (both 68), cobbled
together the Compromise of 1850. They’d been working tirelessly to hold the nation together
for 40 years, but now they were running out of time, both in their own lives and in the life-
span of compromise. Some highlights of the compromise:
 The North got California as a free state, finally tipping the balance toward free-state
votes in the Senate.
 The slave trade, but not slavery itself, was outlawed in Washington, D.C.
 New Mexico and Arizona could join the Union under popular sovereignty by deciding
to be slave states if they wanted to.
The big Southern win in the Compromise of 1850 was the Fugitive Slave Law, which allowed
slaves who had escaped to the North to be grabbed by federal marshals and dragged back
161
Chapter 12: From Sea to Shining Sea: 1846–1854

South in chains. When a Boston runaway slave was dragged off in 1854, the shocking scene
made previously peaceful compromisers into instant abolitionists.
Question: What was the most common Northern position on slavery in 1850?
Answer: For most Northerners in 1850, slavery could remain in the South as long as it
didn’t spread.
Question: What was the most pro-slavery part of the Compromise of 1850?
Answer: The Fugitive Slave Law allowed escaped slaves in the North to be returned to
the South.
The Fugitive Slave Law was a public-relations disaster for the South, delivered in spite over a
few slaves. The South became even more spiteful when Northern states refused to enforce
the law.
Democrat Franklin Pierce won the presidency in 1852 and pledged to enforce the Fugitive
Slave Law. This election was the end of the road for the Whigs; they had too many abolition-
ists to do well in the South and not enough antislavery zeal to win the North.
The South looked desperately for new slave-state territory, even sending military expeditions
to Central America and Cuba; these expeditions were easily beaten back, to the embarrass-
ment of the United States. The United States tossed another $10 million Mexico’s way for a
chunk of desert containing Tucson, which made a good route for a railroad west if you
wanted to build it from the South.
Stephen Douglas and the Kansas-Nebraska Act
Stephen Douglas, senator from Illinois, wanted the western railroad to go from the North
(specifically, from his state’s big city, Chicago). To do this, the United States would have to
organize the Nebraska Territory that the railroad would run across. The South wasn’t going
to settle for any more free states, but the Missouri Compromise said that slavery was banned
from Nebraska.
Douglas, a Northerner from Abe Lincoln’s home state, proposed that the compromise be dis-
regarded and the Nebraska territory opened to popular sovereignty. That could mean that
Kansas, due west of slaveholding Missouri, would become a new slave state. Over angry
opposition from the North, Douglas rammed the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854) through
Congress, doing away with the Missouri Compromise.
The Kansas-Nebraska Act was a self-defeating victory for the South. The North felt betrayed:
The Missouri Compromise clearly said that there would be no slavery in the Nebraska terri-
tory, but now Southerners were flooding into Kansas to claim it for the South. The North
hadn’t liked the Compromise of 1850 in the first place; from now on, they would openly
ignore it.
A new political party sprang up spontaneously in 1854 in the Midwest to fight against slavery.
Within two years, the Republican Party would have enough strength to elect the speaker of
the House of Representatives. The compromises were over.

 Seeing the political, economic, and social background of the Civil War
T
he Civil War was four years of brutal fighting with clear a cause and bravery on each
side. The first cuts of the Civil War were delivered with medieval broadswords near a
peaceful river in Kansas, a thousand miles from the debates in Washington. The political
decision that made the war inevitable came not from the divided Congress or the compro-
mising president, but from the one place where the South had complete control: the
Supreme Court.
When John Brown and his sons hacked five Southern slavery advocates to death in 1856,
Northerners showed that at least some of them would shed blood to defeat slavery after the
court blew the cracked lid off the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which had bought time by
dividing the country into slave and non-slave sections (see Chapter 11). With the 1857 Dred
Scott decision (discussed later in this chapter), middle-of-the-road peacemakers no longer
had a place to meet. When the new Republican Party elected a worried-but-determined anti-
slavery president in 1860, Southern guns were already being moved into position.
Although the political, economic, and social focus of the AP exam limits your need to know
the Civil War’s specific battles, you may be asked about the causes of the Civil War. Well, duh —
slavery, of course. Also be sure to mention the political impact of the polarizing 1860 elec-
tion, the economic influence of cotton profits, and the social dynamic of Northern immi-
grants wanting more free land in the West. Most of all, the growing Northern population
threatened to swamp the South with more voters and more free states. In this chapter, I
cover this information in more detail to give you the basic information you need to know.
How Reading Led to Fighting
In 1852, author Harriet Beecher Stowe had a hit on her hands. Uncle Tom’s Cabin, about the
plight of a Southern slave, was the most popular book in the United States. Uncle Tom’s Cabin
(1852) was a best seller not only in the United States but also in England and France and the
best-selling novel of the entire 1800s. One copy of the book was in print for almost every
voter in the North; Uncle Tom was banned in the South.

Uncle Tom’s Cabin followed the format of then-popular writing called domestic or women’s fic-
tion; it could have been a hit even if it didn’t have so much meaning. It was as though a James
Bond movie featured a suffering yet kindly alien who unites society and, with his death,
saves the world from global warming.
The book had even more impact because Uncle Tom’s Cabin was the first novel many people
had ever read: Literacy was just becoming common for average people due to the growth in
public schools. It would also be the last book many young Northerners read before they went
off to enlist in the Union Army. The book not only helped start the war but also helped win it
by causing Europeans to side with the North.
Because of the popularity of the book in Britain and France, those governments were morally
afraid to intervene on the side of the South. The book was translated into languages around
the world, including Chinese. Stowe had a simple answer when asked how her book came
about. “God wrote it,” she said.
People didn’t even have to read the book to get the message; Tom appeared in thousands of
plays performed in every Northern town before the Civil War. The message was so popular
that Uncle Tom’s Cabin was still in theaters during the 1900s, 50 years after the Civil War.
Another book, The Impending Crisis of the South (1857), written by middle-class Southerner
Hinton Helper, argued that slavery was bad for the Southerners who didn’t own slaves. The
164

The impact of Uncle Tom’s Cabin
What made Stowe’s book so powerful? Uncle Tom’s
Cabin (1852) put a human face on slaves for the first time
in literary history. Most people don’t like to see other
people suffer. The way Americans coped with the cru-
elty of slavery was to pretend, without thinking too hard,
that slaves were work animals without feelings. In Uncle
Tom’s Cabin, the slaves have names, families, hopes, and
spiritual souls. Uncle Tom is never the kiss-up that his
name has come to signify in modern times; he stands up
for his beliefs and his friends even though he doesn’t
have the power to fight back physically against the slave
masters.
Tom is an older Christian slave separated from his wife
and children when his master falls on hard times and is
forced to sell Tom down the river to a life of hard labor
and punishment on a cotton plantation in the Deep
South. A slave mother belonging to Tom’s master who is
about to have her son torn away from her manages to
run north to freedom, carrying her son across the dan-
gerously shifting ice of the Ohio River. On his way south,
Tom saves a 6-year-old white girl named Eva from
drowning. Eva’s family buys Tom. By the time young Eva
dies of natural causes several years later, she and Tom
have developed a faith in goodwill that inspires every-
one around them. Eventually, Tom is sold to an evil slave
owner named Simon Legree. When Tom refuses to tell
about two slaves who have escaped from the plantation,
Legree has Tom beaten to death. Like Christ on the cross,
as Tom is being killed, he forgives the slave drivers who
are whipping him. The slaves who escaped from Legree
meet the slaves who escaped from Tom’s first master in
Canada and realize they’re all from the same family.
Moved by Tom’s story, the son of Tom’s first master frees
all his slaves.
Part of the power of Uncle Tom’s Cabin for contemporary
audiences came from readers’ feeling that they were
learning the truth about the taboo subject of slave life.
The subtitle of the book is Life among the Lowly, making
the cause sound plaintive and nonthreatening. The main
title is a poem in three words. Cabin is the humble home
familiar to all Americans; several U.S. presidents bene-
fited in elections because they’d been born in log cabins.
Tom is as simple as any male name; it was the name of
both Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Didymus, a disciple
of Christ. Tom incorporates the ohm sound used in med-
itation and as part of Amen; the name means twin in
Latin and Greek. Uncle is a favorite relative, kindly with-
out having to carry the emotional baggage of a mother
or father.

book was banned in the South but used by the Republicans in the North as campaign public-
ity. Southerners were fighting mad about exposés they considered to be falsely libelous.
Question: Why was Uncle Tom’s Cabin important?
Answer: The book turned Northern opinion firmly against slavery.
Turning Words to Bullets in Bleeding Kansas
After the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854) opened new territory for settlement, with popular 
sovereignty deciding whether the states to be formed would be slave or free, settlers 
poured into Kansas (see Chapter 12). Most of the Northern settlers just wanted land, but
they included some well-armed partisans who were ready to fight to make Kansas a free
state.
The South sent tough gangs of men to raid Northern settlements and fix elections with the
goal of making Kansas a slave state. Northerners fought back, and the resulting sporadic 
violence won the area the name Bleeding Kansas from 1854 to the beginning of the Civil War
in 1861.
For several years, Kansas lived under the proslavery Lecompton Constitution (1857), a rail-
roaded partisan document forced through by crooked votes and supported by the U.S. presi-
dent but not accepted by Congress.
Responding to raids by proslavery Southern bands, militant abolitionist John Brown and his
sons brutally killed five Southern sympathizers in 1856 (see the discussion on John Brown
later in this chapter). Brown wasn’t arrested and continued to lead antislavery defenders in
pitched battles with Southern forces. Although plenty of property destruction and beatings
occurred, fewer than 60 people were killed during the years of Bleeding Kansas.
Having let the genie out of the bottle by pushing through the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Senator
Stephen Douglas threw away Southern support for the Democratic Party in general and for
his presidential campaign in particular by insisting on real popular sovereignty for Kansas.
Douglas was from Illinois, like Abraham Lincoln, but he was willing to compromise on slav-
ery. That made him a popular opponent, but Lincoln beat him in the presidential election 
of 1860.
Violence even reached the Senate floor when a Southern congressman named Preston
Brooks beat abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner almost to death in 1856 over a virulent
speech Sumner made against Southern-sponsored Kansan “hirelings picked from the
drunken spew and vomit of an uneasy civilization.” For some reason, that speech made
Southerners mad. Outrage over the beating of Sumner contributed to the growth of his 
antislavery Republican Party in the North.
In the end, Kansas settlers were allowed to vote in a fair election in which they supported a
free-state constitution by a margin of two to one. The territory never had more than a few
slaves; no slave owner would risk his valuable property on such dangerous ground. Kansas
was admitted to the Union after the beginning of the Civil War and was the scene of raids and
reprisals by both sides during the war. Kansas contributed more than its share of volunteers
to the Union Army.
165
Chapter 13: Fighting to the Death over Slavery: 1855–1865

The Dred Scott Decision
In the presidential election of 1856, the Democrats cast around for someone nobody knew
enough about to hate and came up with James “Old Buck” Buchanan, who had been out of
the country serving as ambassador to Britain. Buchanan beat John Fremont, the first presi-
dential candidate of the new Republican Party.
Had Fremont won, the Civil War would have been off to an early start. Fremont believed in
action and was so antislavery that he had to be recalled as a Union general during the Civil
War for freeing slaves prematurely. He could have created so much animosity that the North
may have let the South leave peacefully. Buchanan generally supported slavery and its exten-
sion to the territories under popular sovereignty, so the South stayed put during most of his
presidency. He couldn’t have done much else to save the Union, though; sectional conflict
was barreling down the tracks like a runaway freight train.
As he took the oath of office, Buchanan was looking forward to the Supreme Court’s decision
on the Dred Scott case, issued only two days after he became president. Dred Scott (1857)
was a slave who had been taken by his master to live in free Illinois and Wisconsin. Scott
sued for his freedom, because he had spent years living with his master in places where slav-
ery was illegal. The Supreme Court could have just ruled that Scott couldn’t sue because, in
the twisted world of pre–Civil War law, Scott wasn’t a person. Legally, he could no more sue
for freedom than your cat can sue for cat food. The law, bad as it was, was clear on a slave’s
lack of standing to sue in court.
The Supreme Court chooses sides
The high court may be supreme, but that doesn’t mean the judges are blind to politics.
Having lost its majority in the Senate, and with abolitionists nipping at Southerners’ heels in
the House, the South still ruled in one place: the Supreme Court. Most of whose justices were
Southern sympathizers. They took this opportunity to strike a legal blow against anybody
who questioned slavery.
The Supreme Court ruled that because slaves were private property, and because the Fifth
Amendment prohibited Congress from depriving people of their property without due
process of law, every restriction on slavery, every hard-fought compromise, and every choice
of the people in any state or territory was null and void. Due process of the law means that
lawmakers must respect all of a person’s legal rights, not just some or most of them, when
passing laws. If a slave owner had an unrestricted legal right to own a slave (and of course
the slave, being property, had no rights at all) then the slave owner could take his slaves any-
where he wanted and work them as slaves as long as he wanted.
The ruling in the Dred Scott case probably is the worst decision the Supreme Court ever
made. First, it was a bananas interpretation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, the
amendment that protects life, liberty, and property. Due process of the law is exactly what
the Congress and the territorial and state legislatures had gone through in debating and
passing laws banning slavery from jurisdictions under their control. The legislature clearly
had the right to legally deprive people of their property for the public good; that’s what taxa-
tion and eminent domain are. Second, the ruling on the Dred Scott case virtually guaranteed
that civil law would lead to civil war; the Supreme Court was stripping the power of the law
by making it politically absurd.
The fallout from the Dred Scott decision didn’t take long to hit. Stephen Douglas, the
Democratic cheerleader for popular sovereignty, felt stabbed in the back and fought back
166
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

furiously in the Senate. The Republicans had a field day, calling the previously respected
Supreme Court nothing but a Southern debating society. The South was first delighted and
then aghast that the North wouldn’t follow the ruling of the august Supreme Court when the
South was winning. Talk on both sides moved farther in the direction of “We can’t live with
these people.”
Question: What was the overall legal importance of the Dred Scott decision?
Answer: The Dred Scott decision meant Congress could put no limits on slavery in the 
territories, or technically, anywhere else in the United States
Question: What laws did the Dred Scott decision overturn?
Answer: The Dred Scott case effectively repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820, the
Compromise of 1850, and the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854.
The Panic of 1857
Just in time to increase the misery index in the North, the short but sharp Panic of 1857
brought financial collapse and unemployment. The South rode out the down market on the
back of King Cotton, figuring that its relative prosperity was further proof that God was on its
side. Hungry people in the North renewed their cries for the federal government to make
cheap land available for settlement. Congress passed a Homestead Bill in 1860 to do just that,
but President Buchanan vetoed it. Buchanan’s friends in the South didn’t want more settlers
to vote against slavery in the territories.
An Election and a Division
With fights brewing in all branches of government, everyone looked anxiously toward the
presidential election of 1860. Would the Democrats find a bring-us-together candidate? Could
the Republicans possibly win when they weren’t even allowed south of the Mason-Dixon line?
Who was going to save democracy?
Abraham Lincoln runs for president
Abraham Lincoln described himself as ugly. He towered above the short but determined fire-
plug figure of Stephen Douglas (see “Turning Words to Bullets in Bleeding Kansas,” earlier in
this chapter) during their debates for the Senate in 1858, which turned out to be a prequel of
the 1860 presidential race between the two.
Lincoln wasn’t exactly spending all his time splitting logs before the debates, but he wasn’t
any superimportant guy, either. He had risen from his humble beginnings on the Illinois fron-
tier to become one of the better-known local lawyers. In the House of Representatives, where
incumbents usually kept getting reelected, he had managed to serve only one term. Up until
the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, he didn’t stand out from a thousand other
lawyer–politicians.
Lincoln was against slavery, but he shied away from the troublemaking abolitionists. When
the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act threatened to extend slavery, the Republican Party
rose in opposition, and Lincoln became a tiger. He debated the famous Senator Douglas all
over Illinois and came close to knocking him out of the Senate.
167
Chapter 13: Fighting to the Death over Slavery: 1855–1865

John Brown
Meanwhile, the abolitionist anger of John Brown could wait no more. Brown had been the
bad-boy hero of peaceful-but-well-funded abolitionists since he chopped up a few slavery
supporters during the war for Bleeding Kansas (see “Turning Words to Bullets in Bleeding
Kansas,” earlier in this chapter). He went to Kansas to help protect the free-state settlers,
including some of his adult children, from violent Southern raids.
Brown had a legitimate concern for the welfare of his sons and the free-state settlers in their
vicinity, especially because the sacking of the free town of Lawrence seemed to signal an 
all-out campaign of violence by proslavery forces. After he murdered five proslavery men, he
skillfully led the free-state settlers in defending themselves. When he captured a detachment
of armed slavery raiders, he treated them well and negotiated for the return of two of his
own sons who were being held by the slavery forces.
Brown put together a loony plan to start a slave uprising by marching through Virginia, 
handing out guns that he would steal from the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, north of
Washington, D.C. Brown and a few men took the armory but were quickly arrested after a
shootout with an army detachment under the command of (dramatic foreshadowing!) then-
Union Col. Robert E. Lee. Brown’s Harpers Ferry idea could never have worked; during the
Civil War, slaves didn’t revolt even when the Union Army was near.
Brown was quickly tried and hanged, but his spirit electrified the antislavery North and
totally teed off and frightened the slaveholding South. His last words as the noose was being
tied around his neck were “This is a beautiful country.” His death raised an anger in the
North that helped elect antislavery Abraham Lincoln.
When a guy like Brown does something violent, labeling him crazy is natural. Maybe he was
crazy, but how crazy and violent was the slave system he hated? People seem to have more
tolerance for institutionalized violence than they do for attacks against violent institutions.
Brown just thought somebody had to do something; he was driven crazy by the crazy system
of slavery.
Lincoln gets elected, and the South says goodbye
It took two conventions for the Democrats to nominate Stephen Douglas for president in
1860. The Southerners walked out of the first convention and nominated John Breckinridge, a
moderate who was willing to run on a Southern Democrat platform calling for the extension
of slavery. The Northern Democrats who were left behind nominated Douglas. Desperate
compromisers threw together a Constitutional Union Party, to put a fourth candidate in the
race. The Republicans thought they were playing it as safe as possible by picking Abraham
Lincoln; their other choices were better known but were radicals.
During a bitter campaign, the Southerners announced that if “that baboon” Lincoln became
president, they were going to start their own country. Although Lincoln scored less than 
40 percent of the popular vote, he got electoral votes from every free state. Even with Lincoln
elected, the South was under no real danger of having its slavery institution taken way. That
would take a constitutional amendment, and the slaveholders had almost twice as many
states as they needed to defeat an amendment. The Republicans were a minority in both 
the House and Senate, and the Southerners still controlled the Supreme Court. But the South
was fed up.
168
Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

Within days of Lincoln’s election, Southern states had started to secede. Eventually, 11 states
left the Union, taking with them most of the U.S. Army guns and supplies on Southern soil. 
To tell the truth, the army didn’t have much to grab. The entire U.S. Army consisted of only
15,000 men, and lots of them were scattered across the frontier, looking out for American
Indians. The Union held on to one major fort guarding the approach to the hotbed of the
rebellion: Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor.
Even as soldiers drilled, the sides made one final attempt at compromise: the Crittenden
Amendments (1860), which would have allowed slavery in the Southwest and in territories to
be acquired (watch out, Cuba). That law was a nonstarter.
Fighting the Civil War
Most Southerners actually thought they could just say, “Well, it’s been a nice country, but
gotta go,” and the North would wave a peaceful goodbye. Although three quarters of the 
soldiers from the South owned no slaves, they were still ready to fight for those who did.
Southerners figured that Northern businessmen would want to hold on to Northern middle-
man profits from the cotton trade and the millions of dollars owed to them by the South.
They found out that money talks, but not as loud as a cause does. For the North, saving the
Union and opposing slavery were causes worth fighting for.
Five border slave states chose to stay with the Union — luckily for the North, because
border-state people, manufacturing, and horses would have added more than a third to
Southern Confederate strength. As it was, the North had more than twice as many people as
the South, three times as much money, and ten times as many factories.
Those figures didn’t mean that the North was sure to win, though; Britain had those kinds of
advantages over the colonies, and the Revolution still triumphed. As in the Revolutionary
War, the South didn’t really have to win; it just had to not lose. The North was forced to
attack the South on the South’s own soil; the South mostly fought from behind prepared
defenses with short internal lines of supply and communications. The Union Navy blockaded
Southern ports, but the South had enough food and weapons to last a few years.
The hotheads of South Carolina fired on Fort Sumter, the key to Charleston harbor held by
the Union, thereby rousing Northerners into feeling that their nation’s flag was under attack.
Lincoln asked for 75,000 volunteers. After the Union troops had a few months of training,
they marched off to take the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, and end the war
quickly. At First Bull Run (1861) in Northern Virginia, the first battle of the war, one unit of
Confederates held firm like stone, earning their talented general the nickname “Stonewall”
Jackson and buying the South enough time to win the fight.
The Union regrouped under Gen. George McClellan, who was good at organizing parades but
not much at actually fighting. About a year after Bull Run, he lost the Peninsula Campaign
(July 1862) to the Confederate Army under Robert E. Lee. Lee beat the Union again at Second
Bull Run (August 1862) and headed into Union territory, only a few miles from Washington,
D.C. In one of the two most important fights of the Civil War, Lee was turned back, barely, at
Antietam (September 1862). Second Bull Run and Antietam showed that both sides could
defend their own territory.
Britain and France were talking about getting involved on the Southern side, but Antietam
made them shut up. It also gave Lincoln the backing he needed to announce his plan to free
the slaves in the states then fighting the Union. On New Year’s Day, he officially issued the
169
Chapter 13: Fighting to the Death over Slavery: 1855–1865

Emancipation Proclamation (1863). With the Union on record as fighting for the cause of free-
dom, average people in Britain and France made sure their governments wouldn’t help the
South. They had read Uncle Tom’s Cabin (see “How Reading Led to Fighting” earlier in this
chapter).
Question: What was the significance of the Battle of Antietam?
Answer: It helped convince England and France not to support the Confederacy, and it 
gave Lincoln the political strength to issue the Emancipation Proclamation.
Meanwhile, the North tightened its blockade to cut off Southern supplies. Southerners had
figured that Britain would have to help them because something like one out of five jobs in
Britain was tied to Southern cotton. Even though some British working people went unem-
ployed and hungry, the British refused to help. The Northern states shipped Britain extra
food; they had plenty to share.
The South tried to break the blockade with a homemade iron-sided ship called the
Merrimack. Just in time, a Union ironclad arrived to fight. The Monitor and the Merrimack
(1862) fought to a tie. After this first fight between metal ships, it was clear that warships of
the future would be made out of iron, not wood.
As slaves were freed, many of them enlisted in the Union Army. Paid less than whites until
the last year of the war, they fought bravely in difficult battles. About 10 percent of Union
forces were black, and they suffered more than their share of casualties. Southern slaves
never rose up against their masters, but they did run away to freedom when they could.
The Union lost badly at Fredericksburg (December 1862) by attacking an unbeatable Southern
entrenchment and at Chancellorsville (May 1863) by being suckered in a brilliant flank attack
by Lee. Up to that time, Union generals deserved a grade of about F+.
Lee was feeling his oats and decided to have another go at invading the North. At Gettysburg
(July 1863) in Pennsylvania, he attacked Union troops who would not be moved. For three
days of ferocious fighting, the Union held. The battle was very close; the South had peace
commissioners ready to take the Union’s surrender. Instead, Lee’s army was forced to retreat
to Virginia. Gettysburg, the South’s last real chance to win the Civil War, joined Antietam as
the other key battle of the conflict.
Question: What were the two key battles of the Civil War?
Answer: Antietam, where the North held the line against the South, and Gettysburg, 
where the South was defeated in Northern territory.
The day after Gettysburg, General Ulysses S. Grant took the Confederate fortress at Vicksburg
(1863), splitting the South at the Mississippi River. With the twin victories at Gettysburg and
Vicksburg, Britain and France even stopped taking Southern money to build them warships.
The Confederacy was on its own. Union General William Tecumseh Sherman marched across
the Confederacy from Atlanta to the sea (1864), leaving a 60-mile-wide path of destruction and
freeing 25,000 slaves. His tactics were brutal, but they helped shorten the war and save lives.
He said, “War is all hell.”
Lincoln won reelection in 1864 on the Republican ticket, cleverly including a loyal border-
state Democrat as vice president. When Lincoln won, desertions from the Confederate Army
increased. General Grant, now in command of the main Union Army, hammered relentlessly
at Lee throughout 1864. Finally, in April 1865, the Confederacy surrendered. Lincoln visited
the defeated Southern capital of Richmond. When grateful slaves tried to kneel in front of
him, he pulled them up and said, “You must kneel to God only, and thank Him for the liberty.”

Part III: Early U.S. History: From Dinosaurs to the Civil War 

People will tell you the AP never asks about battles, but that isn’t necessarily true. Don’t get
lulled into studying nothing about the way the Civil War unfolded. At a minimum, remember
Antietam, which kept out foreign intervention and let in the Emancipation Proclamation,
which I talk about in the next section. The battle of Gettysburg stopped the South’s invasion
of the North and marked the last real chance for the South to win the war.
Question: How many Southerners owned slaves?
Answer: Only about one quarter of Southern whites owned slaves.
Question: What was the role of black troops in the Civil War?
Answer: Black soldiers made up 10 percent of the Union Army. They suffered more than 
their share of casualties and by the end of the war were paid the same as white troops.
Emancipation and the Loss of Lincoln
Although the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 (see “Fighting the Civil War” earlier in this
chapter) technically only freed slaves in the Confederacy (which was out of the reach of the
law), more and more slaves were freed as the Union Army rolled up Southern territory. More
than 200,000 freed slaves joined the Union Army and fought to free those still held in bondage.
More important, the proclamation showed that the North was fighting to end slavery, not
just keep the Union intact.
Question: What was the most important immediate impact of the Emancipation 
Proclamation?
Answer: Issuing the Emancipation Proclamation showed that the North was fighting to 
end slavery, not just to preserve the Union. This increased support from ex-slaves and 
from foreign nations opposed to slavery.
A few days after he knew the war would end, Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth,
an actor with Southern sympathies who thought he could somehow revive the Confederacy
by killing Lincoln. Actually, killing Lincoln hurt the South. Lincoln had planned to let
Southern states rejoin the Union on relatively easy terms. With Lincoln gone, Democratic
Vice President Andrew Johnson would have to try to manage Reconstruction, the rebuilding
of the South with free blacks (see Chapter 14), through a Republican-controlled Congress
eager to make sure that the South learned a lesson.
Question: What was the impact of the assassination of President Lincoln?
Answer: Without the forgiving Lincoln to guide the process, Reconstruction of the South 
after the war became a partisan political controversy.
More than 600,000 men died in the Civil War — close to the total for all the other wars the
United States has ever fought. Family members fought one another. Mary Lincoln, the presi-
dent’s wife, had three brothers killed fighting for the Confederacy. Four million slaves were
freed, although real social freedom took another 100 years to accomplish, which I talk about
in the following chapters. Extreme states’ rights were abolished, and the twin national chal-
lenges of nullification and secession, which first threatened while George Washington was
still alive (see Chapter 10), were finally laid to rest.
The Union’s victory in the Civil War expanded federal power. The first 12 amendments to the
Constitution, in place before the war, all limited the power of the government. The next three
amendments, passed after the war, all expanded national power.
171
Chapter 13: Fighting to the Death over Slavery: 1855–1865

The Civil War led to a national banking system with national currency; the first income tax (3
percent, starting in 1861); the first draft (1863); and, through attempts to help freed slaves,
the beginning of a national welfare system.
Before the Civil War, the term United States was plural. People said, “The United States — they
have decided to expand.” After the war, United States was singular, as in “The United States —
it has decided to grow.” Small words can make a big difference.

U.S. History from After 
the Civil War to the 
Days of the Internet

In this part . . .
T
he United States put back the pieces after the Civil
War, but it was never the same: it was better. Despite
economic destruction, the South planted new crops and
even built some industry. Former slaves suffered from dis-
crimination and occasional terror, but they were techni-
cally free, which was progress toward civil rights. The
North and South got together again to take on the Spanish.
After holding back from Europe’s endless fights, the U.S.
eventually entered World War I and tipped the balance for
the Allies.
You’ll want to remember that about 20 percent of the
questions on the AP exam come from the post-Civil War
through World War I period. 
There were up times like the 1920s and down times like
the Great Depression. World War II shook the planet, and
the U.S. was right in the middle of it. After the victory
came the social challenges and the Cold War. The Cold
War ended, but terror expanded. Prosperous, diverse, and
challenged, the U.S. now stands fully part of a difficult
world.
About 30 percent of the AP exam questions deal with the
post-World War I world. There aren’t a lot of questions
about what happened after 1985; history takes a while 
to digest.

A
s you can probably determine if you read Chapter 13, the results of the Civil War were
pretty uncivil! Because everyone who died on both sides was an American, the Civil
War cost as many U.S. lives as all the other wars the country has ever fought combined.
Both sides lived for years with chips on their shoulders. And what about those 4 million
newly freed slaves? The Civil War resulted in Reconstruction, and also set the stage for U.S.
expansion west, and I tell you all about that in this chapter.
After the Civil War, besides Reconstruction and Western expansion, industry grew, and even
farmers started using machines. More people moved to the cities, trading all-day farm chores
for nighttime bright lights. Railroads crossed the country, American Indians were pushed
onto reservations, and immigrants streamed onshore. Hard-to-remember presidents who
looked like walruses debated about hard-to-remember things like tariffs and silver coinage.
Meanwhile, the rights of women and labor advanced in fits and starts. This chapter covers
the beginnings of all of these things. Pay special attention to social trends that can be useful
in both multiple-choice and essay success on the big test.
Reconstruction: Rebuilding the USA 
in a Brand-New Way
What with the actions of Union Generals Sherman and Grant, plus the South’s own destruc-
tive fighting (see Chapter 13), the Cotton Belt was pretty torn up after the war. Southern 
plantations needed five years to get back into full cotton production. The Reconstruction
(1865–1877) of the South included new national and local governments, as well as social help.
And the Thirteenth Amendment (1865) made Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation into a
national ban on slavery.
Slaves who were worth billions of dollars to plantation owners before the war were now offi-
cially free, so how was the South going to plant and harvest all that valuable cotton? Well,
after the Civil War, blacks with no clothes, shoes, education, food, or places to live weren’t
really all that free. Former slaves often didn’t have any choice but to sign up to work for very
low wages, often for their former masters.

The issues of Reconstruction included the changes that Southern states would have to imple-
ment to be readmitted to the Union, how much help the former slaves would have from the
federal government, and how Northern troops could contain Southern terrorist attacks by
groups like the Ku Klux Klan.
Expect a question about Reconstruction on test day, especially about the amendments that I
discuss in this section. Remember that the amendments were passed in the order you would
expect if you freed someone: The Thirteenth abolished slavery, the Fourteenth granted citi-
zenship, and the Fifteenth provided the right to vote. The Thirteenth Amendment, represent-
ing the unlucky number, got rid of a very unlucky thing that can happen to a person: slavery.
Off to a bumpy start: The Radical Republicans
With Abraham Lincoln gone (see Chapter 13), his Democratic vice president, Andrew
Johnson, took over as president. Lincoln had generously planned to let the Southern states
rejoin the Union on easy terms. Johnson went along with the Mr. Nice Guy policy; he issued
pardons to hundreds of ex-Confederates.
That wasn’t what the Radical Republicans (1866) in Congress wanted, however; they wanted
to change the South radically, punish the former slave masters, and protect the blacks with
federal power. To the disgust of these Republican lawmakers, new delegates from the South
came knocking on the Capitol door in December 1865 — the very same year in which the
South was finally defeated and Lincoln was shot.
And who should be there asking for admission as congressmen but several Confederate gen-
erals, members of the Confederate Cabinet, and even the Confederate vice president? (“Well,
it was quite a war, but we were only kidding. Can we come back now?”) The Radical
Republicans threw them out. The radicals had two reasons for hanging tough:
 The unreconstructed Southerners had passed ugly Black Codes (1866) that made
blacks almost into slaves again. Blacks had to sign one-year labor contracts, and if they
didn’t come through, they could be fined and put so deeply in debt that they would
never earn anything. They could be punished for “idleness” by being sent to work on
chain gangs.
 Now that the slaves were officially free, the South actually got more representatives in
Congress than it had before the war, when a slave counted as only three-fifths of a
person. Working with Northern Democrats, the South could even take control of
Congress and undo all the progress that the North had fought to gain.
The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments
To nail down blacks’ rights, Congress passed the Fourteenth Amendment (1866) to the
Constitution. It guaranteed the citizenship of freed slaves, reduced the representation of
176
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 
Reconstructing a new South
A month before the Civil War was even over, Congress
created the Freedmen’s Bureau (1865) to help educate
and take care of freed slaves. By the time the bureau
packed it in, it had taught 200,000 former slaves to read
with the help of volunteer teachers from the North. In
one classroom, four generations of a family, from child
to great-grandmother, all learned to read together. Union
Gen. Oliver Howard ran the Freedmen’s Bureau and later
started Howard University in Washington, D.C.

Southern states if they kept blacks from voting, disqualified anyone who had left public 
service in the North to join the Confederacy from ever holding office in the Union again, and
guaranteed the debt of the Union while repudiating the debt of the Confederacy. The Fourteenth
Amendment encouraged universal male voting; the Fifteenth Amendment made it the law.
Congress was determined to not let any Confederate state back in unless it endorsed the
Fourteenth Amendment. President Andrew Johnson told the former rebel states not to sign
it. Johnson had been the only senator from a Southern state to remain loyal to the Union;
now that the fighting was over, he wanted to go easy on his Southern buddies. Even though
Johnson was from a different political party, Lincoln had made him vice president as a show
of national unity. Now Lincoln was dead and Johnson was unexpectedly president. The
Republican Congress headed for a showdown with the president they never wanted.
Johnson had hoped to pick up some support in the fall congressional elections, but the
Republicans won big. After whites attacked blacks in vicious riots in the South, Congress
divided the South into five military districts and sent in the Army to keep order. It also
passed the Fifteenth Amendment (1869) to guarantee blacks the right to vote. To get back into
the Union, representatives of former Confederate states had to sign both amendments.
Question: What was the purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment?
Answer: The Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed citizenship and civil rights for former 
slaves.
Question: What was the most serious constitutional issue following the Civil War?
Answer: How the former Confederate states would be readmitted to the Union.
Women, former slaves, and the limits of freedom
Women’s-rights leaders like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton put their own
cause on hold to work tirelessly for emancipation of the slaves. Although women’s rights
were a growing concern before the Civil War, most politically involved women were even
more concerned with ending slavery and preserving the Union. Women from outside the
women’s-rights movement also served during the war. For example, Dorothea Dix was the
leader of Union nurses; the Woman’s Loyal League gathered nearly 400,000 signatures on a
petition for a constitutional amendment banning slavery. Many of them were just a little
peeved that the new Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments gave black males the right to
vote, but not white or black women. Women would have to wait almost 60 years before their
election rights became part of the Constitution.
Meanwhile, more and more Western states let women step up to the ballot box, starting with
Wyoming (“The Equality State”) in 1869. Black women, voting or not, helped rally black politi-
cal participation in the South until they were silenced by the heavy hand of segregationist
governments.
Question: Name a female leader who was not greatly involved in the women’s-rights 
movement.
Answer: Despite being the leader of the Union’s nurses, Dorothea Dix wasn’t a women’s 
rights pioneer.
Northern troops in the South supported “radical” state governments that allowed blacks
freedom and passed public education bills to help everyone. But by the time federal troops
finally withdrew from the South in 1877, Southern state governments were quickly seized by
Redeemer or home-rule segregationist groups, which took as many rights as they could away
from blacks. Before these groups struck, however, blacks enjoyed a brief period of being
elected to Congress and local offices, which outraged former slave masters.
177
Chapter 14: Reconstructing and Moving Westward, 1866–1880

White Southerners called anyone from the North who helped Reconstruction a carpetbagger
(1870), taking dig at the image of outsiders arriving with cheap luggage made out of carpets.
Southerners who cooperated with Reconstruction were called scalawags (1870). The most
important and lasting contribution of the carpetbagger governments was the establishment
of a system of public education in the South.
Although Reconstruction Southern state governments did have their share of mismanage-
ment, they were no more outrageous than the scams going on in some Northern capitals at
this time. Reconstruction governments got some important work going in public education
and road repair.
Blacks as well as poor whites in the South were forced into sharecropping. In a system remi-
niscent of feudalism, they worked their small parts of a large plantation owned by a landlord
and turned over a third or more of their crops to the landlord. Worse, sharecroppers were
required to buy supplies from the landowner and sell their own crops to the landlord at
prices that the landlord set. Because the landlord kept all the accounts, any halfway intelli-
gent landlord could make sure his sharecroppers stayed perpetually in debt.
Question: What lasting accomplishments of carpetbagger governments remained even 
after the Redeemers took over?
Answer: The greatest accomplishment of the carpetbagger Southern governments that 
survived the Redeemer segregationist takeover was a lasting public education system.
Question: How did blacks earn money after the Civil War?
Answer: Most of them were sharecroppers close to where they’d been slaves.
Fighting against Reconstruction
Southerners struck back at Reconstruction with violence through secret terrorist organiza-
tions such as the Ku Klux Klan (1867). The original Ku Klux Klan lasted only for about six
years before federal troops put it down, but its terrorist hatred did a lot of damage. Hundreds
of blacks and their white helpers were beaten and murdered. Congress passed the Force Acts
(1870), which used federal troops to largely stamp out the Klan, but white intimidation of
blacks lasted well into the 20th century (see Chapter 15).
By the 1890s, blacks were blocked from voting in the South by technically legal methods 
like rigged literacy tests and poll taxes. A hate-filled white minority didn’t limit itself to legal
methods; lynchings and beatings continued for 100 years after the Civil War.
178
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 
Frederick Douglass on the end of Reconstruction
“As the war for the Union recedes into the misty shad-
ows of the past, and the Negro is no longer needed to
assault forts and stop rebel bullets, he is in some sense,
of less importance. Peace with the old master class has
been war to the Negro. As the one has risen, the other
has fallen. The reaction has been sudden, marked, and
violent. It has swept the Negro from all the legislative
halls of the Southern States, and from those of the
Congress of the United States. It has, in many cases,
driven him from the ballot box and the jury box. The sit-
uation has much in it for serious thought, but nothing to
cause despair. Above all the frowning clouds that lower
about our horizon, there is the steady light of stars, and
the thick clouds that now obscure them, will in due
season pass away.”

President Johnson made himself so unpopular with the Republican Congress that it moved 
to impeach him. Fearing that Johnson would fire the Republican members of the Cabinet he
had inherited from Lincoln, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act (1867), which made that
move illegal. Johnson fired Republican Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton anyway because
Stanton wanted strong Reconstruction measures. The House of Representatives voted to
impeach Johnson. Amid much drama, the Senate came just one vote short of voting Johnson
out of office. Tempers ran high, but the country stuck to democracy. No violence broke out
among the Union and former Confederate leaders.
The national government’s attempts at Reconstruction lasted until the disputed election of
Rutherford Hayes as president in 1877 caused the Republicans to make a deal to pull the last
Union troops out of the South.
The political gains that blacks made during the 12 years of Reconstruction didn’t last much
longer than the last federal rifle to defend them. No way were powerful Southern whites
going to swallow the blacks’ change from slaves to citizens in one generation. In fact, it took
100 years for blacks to be really free to vote, go to school, and live with the rest of society.
The legacy of poverty had a lot of staying power. In the words of the distinguished ex-slave
Frederick Douglass, a freedman was “free from the individual master, but still a slave to soci-
ety . . . free from the old quarter that once gave him shelter, but a slave to the rains of
summer and the frosts of winter. He was, in a word, literally turned loose, naked, hungry and
destitute, to the open sky.” Delayed but not forever denied, the gains of the 1960s civil-rights
movement had their basis in the faltering reforms of Reconstruction in the 1860s.
Reconstruction comes to an end
The political fight that ended Reconstruction was the Hayes-Tilden Compromise (1877). Hayes
was a Republican political hack running under the burden of Grant-administration corrup-
tion. Samuel Tilden was the Democratic reformer who had cleaned up the Boss Tweed scan-
dal. Tilden racked up more popular votes, but the numbers in the Electoral College were
about even.
The Democrats made a deal to let Hayes win in return for the Republicans’ agreeing to with-
draw the last federal troops from the South. In reality, the determination of the North to pro-
tect blacks in the South had faded with time.
The last-gasp Civil Rights Act (1875) was mostly overturned by the South-leaning Supreme
Court in the Civil Rights Cases (1883). Even the Fourteenth Amendment was found by the
court to apply only to government violations of civil rights, not to the denial of rights by indi-
viduals. Blacks were pretty much on their own in a hostile society for the next 100 years.
Civil War General Turns President: 
Ulysses S. Grant
In 1868 (before the end of Reconstruction), former Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant ran for presi-
dent as a Republican under the slogan “Vote as you shot” and was elected by a grateful
nation and an army of Union veterans. Although Grant had most of the electoral votes, his
popular-vote majority came from former slaves. The Republicans, on only their second
elected president, realized that they would have to play politics carefully to stay in office.
179
Chapter 14: Reconstructing and Moving Westward, 1866–1880

Unfortunately, politics (then as now) meant hanging around with rich people who were out
for their own good.
Grant proved to be better at fighting battles than watching over money. He had been in office
for only a few months when speculators tried to corner the gold market on Black Friday
(1869), causing a business panic. Other problems followed Grant through his presidency:
 The Crédit Mobilier scandal (1872), which involved Union Pacific railroad payoffs to
politicians.
 The Whiskey Ring scandal (1875), in which politicians robbed the U.S. Treasury of
excise taxes on booze.
 The forced resignation of Grant’s secretary of war William Belknap in 1876 after he was
caught pocketing bribes from suppliers to American Indian reservations.
Although Grant himself was not dishonest, he did enjoy drinking Old Crow whiskey and 
had complete trust for all his relatives and friends. The crooks who always hang around poli-
tics took advantage of Grant’s easygoing character. After Boss Tweed (1872), leader of the
Tammany Hall ring in New York City, was finally sent to prison, one of his cronies explained
how it worked: “I seen my opportunities, and I took ’em.”
Living in the Gilded Age
Author Mark Twain (see “Increasing literacy” later in this chapter) called the period of the
1800s after the Civil War the Gilded Age (1875), for all the gold-painted furniture and fancy
living. The country was evenly split between Republicans and Democrats; although the
Republicans won most of the presidential races, control of Congress changed hands in more
than half of the elections.
Most people voted, and the issues, though deeply felt at the time, seem pretty small in retro-
spect. Republican voters tended to be rural Protestants, believers in personal morality, and
veterans of the Civil War. Democrats tended to live in big cities and in the South or to be
recent-immigrant Protestants and Catholics, and were more easygoing in their judgments.
The self-betterment dreams of early modern Americans were modest; people didn’t dream of
a mansion, just a home. Even so, the country grew and changed in ways that many people
found surprising, as covered in the following sections.
America gets used to paper money
An economic panic that started in 1873 introduced an issue that would continue for the rest
of the 1800s. During the Civil War, the Union had issued millions of dollars in paper money.
People who owed loans wanted more paper money, because that would increase inflation.
Inflated cheap money would make the debt they owed easier to repay. Businessmen who
loaned money wanted all paper money paid off in gold, so that the money they loaned would
be worth more when it was paid back. The cheap-money people also supported the coinage
of silver to bring about more inflation. The U.S. Treasury, backed by businessmen, redeemed
paper money for gold so regularly that after a while, people got tired of carrying jangling
coins and just used paper money.

Immigration
When a country loses 600,000 men in a war, you’d expect the population to go down for a
while. The South lost 1 out of 10 adult males, the North 1 out of 30; the equivalent loss in
today’s U.S. population would be 6 million people. But the United States was the most popu-
lar immigration destination in the world. The population of the country actually went up by
more than 25 percent during the Civil War decade; by 1870, the United States had almost 40
million citizens. Lots of these people were moving to Eastern cities or opened Western land.
With no real danger of foreign attacks or internal dissolution, the United States turned to
wrangling about money and voting rights.
The history of the post–Civil War United States centered on moves to the cities and to the
West. The Civil War was a fight among farm boys; 80 percent of Americans lived in the coun-
try. But by 1900, the United States was only 60 percent rural and boasted several cities over 1
million in population. New York had become the second-largest city in the world.
Europe was growing too. Thanks in part to food imported directly from America and to
European cultivation of that New World feeding wonder, the potato, the population of Europe
doubled in the 1800s.
Many Europeans were moving around that continent, looking for new opportunities. For
some people — like the Irish living in famine — the choice was immigrate or die. Aided by
the ease and cheapness of steamship travel, 20 million Europeans made the jump across the
Atlantic to the United States between 1820 and 1900.
As in the Know-Nothing days before the Civil War, the increase in immigrants and the growth
of cities worried some traditionalists. As the 1870s drew to a close, calls to restrict immigra-
tion grew louder.
Industrialization and the birth of labor unions
The world’s petrochemical future began with the first rickety oil well in Pennsylvania in 1859.
Cars didn’t exist yet, but kerosene made from petroleum oil burned brighter than the expen-
sive whale oil that had been the only thing used in lamps since before the days of Moby-Dick.
The oil business was off to a good start; within a few years, kerosene was the fourth-leading
export of the United States.
Slowly, American products begin to show up all over the world. Among the first to arrive
were five-gallon kerosene cans from Standard Oil Co. The growth in industry was trailed by a
growth in labor unions. The National Labor Union was formed just after the Civil War and
helped to win the first eight-hour working day, initially just for federal government employees.
Workers in the period after the Civil War were often made to work ten or more hours a day,
six days a week, without overtime.
By 1872, labor unions had hundreds of thousands of members, and more than 30 national
unions represented typesetters, hat-makers, cobblers, and other skilled craftspeople. Business
depressions in the 1870s and the inability of unions to raise wages while profits were shrinking
caused the union movement to lose momentum for a while. In the 1870s, a new national union
coalition called the Knights of Labor gained strength. The Knights tried to unite all laboring
men behind a program of worker-owned stores; health and safety regulations; and, most impor-
tant, the eight-hour working day. The eight-hour workday didn’t become standard until the 1900s.
181
Chapter 14: Reconstructing and Moving Westward, 1866–1880

Older U.S. history texts (and some older U.S. history teachers) may not pay enough attention
to the labor-, women’s-, and minority-rights movements that the politically up-to-date AP U.S.
History exam expects you to know. Don’t get caught short. Because this exam gets you the
college credit you want, take this opportunity to memorize some key names and dates from
the evolving history of people’s movements. Progress is like a dance between the leaders and
the people: Sometimes the rulers lead; sometimes the people do.
Increasing literacy
Public schools spread throughout the nation in the 1870s. The change was especially impor-
tant in the South, where public education was a lasting benefit of Reconstruction. Adults too
old for school were so eager to learn that they flocked to public lectures called chautauquas
held in hundreds of locations all over the country. The number of Americans who couldn’t
read dropped from 20 percent in 1870 to about 10 percent in 1900, despite the influx of mil-
lions of initially poorly educated immigrants. However, in 1900, almost half of nonwhite
Americans still couldn’t read.
College education got a big boost from the Morrill Act (1862), which reserved some of the
proceeds from the sale of public lands to found land-grant colleges in new states. Land-grant
colleges are state schools with public backing in all of the United States that allow people to
get higher education even if they come from poor families. Johns Hopkins University (1876)
provided the first serious graduate-degree programs in the United States.
More people could read than ever before. They chose books with stories that seemed to
speak to their own lives and dreams. The books they read then proceeded to reshape the
way readers saw the world.
 Horatio Alger wrote more than 100 novels with titles like Luck and Pluck (1869) and
Tattered Tom (1871). The young heroes of Horatio Alger stories advance through hard
work and honesty from poverty to middle-class economic safety, not from rags to
riches, as people who have never read the stories have come to believe.
 Walt Whitman continued his poetic tributes to natural humans and his native land
through the 1870s.
 America and the world found a new literary friend when a failed silver miner named
Samuel Clemens took the pen name Mark Twain. His writing, from The Innocents 
Abroad (1869) to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) to The Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn (1884), helped make reading widely popular and broadened the meaning of great
literature.
The impact of Charles Darwin
Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution upset religious traditions as it spread through America
after the Civil War. Darwin said that all living things have evolved to their present form through
a dazzling process of natural selection. The Christian Bible says literally that God created the
world in six days, but evolution covers millions of years. Religious fundamentalists felt that
their faith would be shaken if they didn’t take those six days in the Bible literally. Religious
modernists, on the other hand (including Catholics, the Jewish, and most of the major
Protestant denominations), saw evolution as just an advance in understanding the grand 
workings of God.
The fight over human evolution that started during this period is part of an evolutionary
battle between literal and spiritual interpretations of religious teaching that has been going
182
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

on since the writing of the first holy books. In the United States, evolutionary theory led to
political, educational, and religious polarization. Social Darwinists (1875) carried natural
selection to a literal extreme and taught that survival-of-the-fittest competition was the law of
society. Speakers toured the U.S. to promote science and Darwin’s theory. Toward the end of
the 1800s, fundamentalist churches increasingly opposed evolution.
Question: How was Darwin’s theory of evolution used to explain society?
Answer: Social Darwinists said society functions on Darwin’s survival-of-the-fittest 
theory.
Censorship and women’s rights
The forces of new morality took on the forces of censorship in the 1870s. Winning the right
for women to vote was a crusade for eloquent Victoria Woodhull (1872), who became the first
woman to run for president (with the amused support of Cornelius Vanderbilt). She and her
sister published a magazine that crusaded for equal rights and outed respected minister
Henry Ward Beecher for having an affair with a female parishioner.
Armed with the Comstock Laws (1873), Anthony Comstock tried to arrest Woodhull for inde-
cency. The Comstock Laws include federal and state laws against indecent material. For 50
years, these laws were also used to suppress information about birth control. Woodhull
escaped Comstock’s clutches and represented progressive causes for the rest of her life.
Comstock’s censorship laws survived into the 1960s, when they no longer seemed necessary
in a free society. Family planning information and most kinds of literature are no longer 
prohibited in the U.S. Woodhull’s feisty feminism is still alive today in books, movies, songs,
and politics.
The temperance movement gains strength
People on the frontier often drank too much, and the United States had been a frontier for 
all its existence. The National Prohibition Party organized in 1869 and the more-moderate
Women’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in 1874. Temperance allows a little social
drinking for those who can control it; Prohibition means no booze for anybody. Throughout
the late 1800s and early 1900s, people against drinking gained political strength. In the early
1900s, the Prohibitionists won big. With the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment (1920),
alcohol became illegal in the U.S. America’s “dry” period lasted only 13 years. In 1933, the
Eighteenth Amendment was repealed, because making alcoholic beverages illegal seemed to
lead to more problems than it solved.
Workin’ on the Railroad
At the end of the Civil War, most of the railroads were north and east of the Mississippi; none
of them crossed the West. California could be reached only by weeks of sailing or riding in a
bumpy stagecoach. By 1900, the United States had more railroads than Europe, and people
could ride the rails to the West Coast in a matter of a few days.
Beginning right after the end of the Civil War in 1865, a crew of 5,000 (mostly Irish) workers
pushed the rail lines west from Omaha, while 10,000 Chinese workers labored over the
Sierras from Sacramento. By 1869, the railroad across America was complete.
183
Chapter 14: Reconstructing and Moving Westward, 1866–1880

The Crédit Mobilier scandal tainted the westbound-from-Omaha owners of the Union Pacific
Railroad. The Central Pacific Railroad from Sacramento made a lot of money but avoided the
large-scale political bribery of the Crédit Mobilier scandal.
Cornelius Vanderbilt had made a fortune in steamboats. In his late 60s, when he should have
been happily enjoying the money, he decided to build some railroads. He pioneered the use
of steel instead of iron rails for the important New York Central, making train tracks safer and
less expensive to build. In the years after the Civil War, the railroads finally got it together
and agreed on a standard width or gauge for rails so that people didn’t have to keep getting
out and changing trains. Westinghouse air brakes helped trains stop, and Pullman cars made
them comfortable.
Railroads made the United States the largest integrated market in the world. Food, resources,
and products could move anywhere in the country, which stimulated growth. Building the
railroads also helped develop the U.S. steel industry. When Vanderbilt first used steel rails,
he had to buy the steel from England. Settlements sprung up like strings of pearls along the
railroads, just as they’d done in the past along rivers. Corn, wheat, and cattle replaced tall-
grass prairies and buffalo. Forests were cut down and rolled over rails to build cities.
Question: How did the railroads contribute to economic growth?
Answer: Transportation sparked growth from 1860 to 1900 by creating the world’s largest 
connected market system, by allowing settlers and businessmen to reach any part of 
the country quickly, and by fueling the business involved in the very act of building the 
world’s largest railroad system.
The profits of progress attracted rip-off artists. Jay Gould made a fortune buying railroads,
inflating their stocks, and then selling them. The scam was called stock watering, after the
farmer’s trick of getting cattle really thirsty and then letting them fill up with heavy water just
before they hit the scales to be sold by weight.
Railroad stock wars led to bare-knuckle fights between capitalists. Tough old Vanderbilt said:
“I won’t sue you; the law takes too long. I’ll ruin you.” Railroads had almost unlimited politi-
cal power; they bought influence by giving out free passes to politicians and reporters.
Without competition on most routes, they could charge whatever they wanted. They angered
small shippers and farmers by demanding more money from them than from their large busi-
ness cronies.
Moving Out West
The Homestead Act (1862) allowed half a million settlers to buy 160 acres of land from the
federal government for the bargain price of $30 (about $900 in modern money). Around two
out of three of these families couldn’t make a go of farming marginal Western land. Another
2.5 million settlers bought land from the railroads, land speculators, or state governments.
Farming increased everywhere. As with any real estate, location was everything. Land west
of the 100th meridian, the imaginary dividing line that runs north from the Texas Panhandle,
was just too dry for regular farming without irrigation. Ranchers held on by planting tough
strains of wheat and fencing their land with the new barbed wire invented in 1874.
Cattle drives moved beef to the nearest railroad terminals all over the West. The spectacular
Long Drive covered 500 miles from Texas to Kansas, with crews of black, white, and Mexican
cowboys moving herds as big as 10,000 head to market. The Long Drive was just one of thou-
sands of trails that connected cattle range in the farthest corners of the West to railroad lines
184
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

and finally dinner plates. These cattle drives built the real-life legend of the cowboys. The
cattle drives died out in the 1880s as the open range was broken up by homesteaders, but by
that time, more than 4 million steers had made the big roundup.
Historian Frederick Turner, who specialized in the American West, thought that the constant
push against the Western frontier defined America. Although Turner’s specific conclusions
are no longer current, his approach to looking at how social and economic issues influence
history is very important. The frontier spirit of tough self-sufficiency and belief in the power
of new directions wasn’t limited to the West. As the 1800s drew to a close, the formerly rural
United States moved closer to world leadership in social and industrial development (see
Chapter 15). By the end of the 19th century, the once-little republic on the edge of the New
World began to move toward center stage in world affairs.
Question: What was the biggest change in the agricultural landscape in the post–Civil 
War era?
Answer: Settlers cultivated more and more land to grow crops.
Question: What was the role of the federal government after the Civil War with regard to 
race relations, economic development, and Western expansion?
Answer: The Homestead Act and quick admission of new states supported Western 
expansion; a strong dollar, railroad support, and high tariffs boosted economic devel-
opment; Reconstruction and the Freedmen’s Bureau were federal efforts in race relations.
The American Indians Get Crowded Out
At the end of the Civil War, close to half a million American Indians were scattered across 
the West — 1 American Indian for every 60 Americans. Twenty-five years later, the Western
homes of the American Indians were on reservations, and their homelands were carved into
states and territories.
American Indians didn’t really live in tightly organized tribes, and they mostly didn’t stay put
for long. Tribes were made up of family-based bands that numbered as few as 25 people.
They came together with other bands that spoke the same language for periodic hunts, wars,
or parties.
The various tribes also often had no permanent leaders, which made the settlers’ need to
have someone to negotiate with difficult to satisfy. American Indians not only didn’t have
permanent leaders, they also lacked obedient followers who could be made to stick to treaty
agreements. Most of all, the American Indians lacked any political power to make the United
States abide by its own agreements. Many treaties were signed by compromised and self-
appointed leaders on behalf of tribes that barely knew what was going on except that their
life of freedom was being ruined by relentless settler aggression.
Settler inroads pushed American Indians into being aggressive with one another as well as
with the whites, resulting in a sort-of domino effect:
 Before the settlers arrived, the Comanches had driven the Apaches off their land on
the central Plains in the 1700s.
 Pushed by other tribes, the Cheyenne abandoned their villages along the upper
Mississippi and Missouri rivers in the early 1800s.
 The Sioux, displaced from the Great Lakes, learned to ride horses and, like the
Cheyenne, became swift buffalo hunters.
185
Chapter 14: Reconstructing and Moving Westward, 1866–1880

Far more American Indians died from diseases than from the bullets of settlers; explorers are
biological weapons even if they don’t want to be. Europeans often encountered American
Indian tribes reduced by two-thirds or more by recent epidemics. Most American Indians
died before they ever saw a settler.
In the 1860s, the U.S. Army pushed to move American Indians either to the Sioux Reservation
in Dakota Territory or to Indian Territory in Oklahoma — the end of the trail for Eastern
American Indians from the 1830s on. Mounted Plains Indians resisted skillfully when they
could and tried to live in peace when they were surrounded.
In one of the most brutal and cowardly acts in the West, Colonel John Chivington’s Colorado
Militia murdered almost 200 women, children, and elderly men in an attack on an American
Indian encampment living under the American flag on Sand Creek in Colorado. Because the
camp was at peace, the warriors were off hunting. Reaction to Chivington’s massacre turned
public opinion away from a general war against the American Indians and toward a some-
what more even-handed treatment of peaceful natives.
The Sioux struck back a couple of years later, wiping out a detachment of 81 soldiers who
were building a trail through their land in Montana. Stung, the federal government actually
signed the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868), with the Sioux. The U.S. government agreed to stop
the trail and guaranteed a Great Sioux reservation on the land around it.
Within years, Colonel George Custer’s Seventh Cavalry was back on Lakota Sioux land for a
“scientific exploration.” Custer announced that he had discovered gold, and treaty be
damned, greedy miners rushed onto land given to the Indians forever in the treaty signed
only a few years before. Custer attacked the Sioux and got killed, along with 264 officers and
men. The Sioux were eventually hunted down and returned to the reservation.
Also hunted down by settlers were the Plains buffalo that fed the American Indians. Buffalo
were 15 million strong at the end of the Civil War. By 1885, fewer than 1,000 buffalo were left.

T
he time between the end of the Civil War in 1865 and the beginning of the Spanish-
American War in 1898 was the longest period of peace in U.S. history, and America used
the time to grow. New inventions transformed the country. Industry, pushed originally by
flamboyant capitalists, began to take on the look of modern big business. Women and work-
ing people also fought to make progress. Blacks endured endless persecution, but they
weren’t slaves anymore. Lost causes like the Populist Party and protests by laborers and
farmers sowed the seeds for later reform.
As the United States grew more powerful, it got a bigger role to play in the world. The coun-
try that started as colonies becoming independent ended up fighting Spain to take over its
colonies and, a little embarrassed, eventually set those colonies free. The United States
became strong and stable enough to help lead the world into the 1900s. This chapter gives
you the rundown on what happened during those years.
Social Change in the Gilded Age Scramble
Some see the time after the Civil War as a time of complacency, when the U.S. caught its
breath and concentrated on making money and inventing things. Mark Twain called it the
Gilded Age for a reason. Even though the pace of change slowed down, people who saw injus-
tice often worked to improve society.
 The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was founded in 1866.
 Human beings got some protection, too, when the American Red Cross began in 1881
under Clara Barton, a beloved nurse from the Civil War.
 The Anti-Saloon League (1893) won some temporary victories, but Prohibition, when it
came in 1919, lasted little more than a decade (see Chapter 17).
Separate but not equal
Politics didn’t help blacks in the closing years of the 1800s. They weren’t slaves anymore, but
society was still holding them down. According to the chilling phrase used until the 1960s,
keeping blacks “in their place” meant, for many Southern whites, that blacks would be kept
poor, segregated, and unable to vote. Blacks were forbidden to mix with whites in Southern
schools, buses, trains, and parks by Jim Crow laws (1890). These laws also erected phony lit-
eracy tests and poll taxes to keep blacks from voting.

Despite many challenges, Jim Crow laws were finally cleared away only by the Civil Rights
Act of 1964. An early attempt to appeal to the Supreme Court, Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), failed
when the court ruled that “separate but equal” facilities were legal under the Fourteenth
Amendment. This ruling was a good day for the segregationist South but a bad day for jus-
tice. (See Chapter 26 for the best Supreme Court rulings). The lives of blacks were separate
but almost never equal. Just to make sure blacks and their Northern supporters were too
frightened to fight back, whites lynched more than 1,000 blacks during the 1880s and 1890s.
Question: What was the significance of the Supreme Court decision in Plessy v.
Ferguson (1896)?
Answer: The decision said that “separate but equal” public facilities were okay under
the civil-rights laws.
Blacks were left to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, and they did so:
 Booker T. Washington (1885) taught hundreds of blacks to make a living at his Tuskegee
Institute in Alabama. His Atlanta Compromise Speech (1895) called for blacks to better
themselves through education even while they remained separate but linked to whites,
like the individual fingers of a hand. Blacks mostly attended special black colleges until
they began to be admitted to traditionally white institutions in the 1960s.
 George Washington Carver (1900) became a respected agricultural chemist who publi-
cized many uses for peanuts and sweet potatoes at a time when the South needed a
crop to replace cotton.
 W. E. B. Du Bois (1910) got a PhD from Harvard and helped found the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
 Writer Paul Dunbar made the literary world appreciate the experience of blacks
through poetry and dialect in Lyrics of Lowly Life (1896).
Question: What did Booker T. Washington support in his Atlanta Compromise Speech?
Answer: He favored black self-help and separate but cooperative development with 
whites.
Dealing with change on the railroads
Railroads were so important that they actually changed the time. Before the 1880s, every
major city had its own local time, based on calling it noon when the sun was right over city
hall. Noon in Philadelphia was a few minutes later than noon in New York; when the clocks in
St. Louis said 11:50, the clocks in Chicago said noon. This customized time didn’t matter
much in the days of stagecoaches, but railroads needed to run on schedules that everybody
understood. In 1883, the major railroads laid out four time zones for the United States; these
time zones are still basically what Americans set their watches by today.
The year 1877, when the last federal troops protecting blacks were withdrawn from the South,
was a bad time for many white railroad workers. The four largest railroads in the United States
cut their pay by 10 percent. When union members went on strike, federal troops were called
in to break up the picket lines. In the fighting that followed, more than 100 people died.
Chinese workers also had problems. After they finished building the Central Pacific railroad
west from Sacramento, the jobs for low-paid Chinese far outnumbered those for other work-
ers. When the Chinese population of California reached nearly 10 percent of the state total,
jobless white residents launched violent attacks against the competitive Asians.
188
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Under pressure, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882), barring all further settle-
ment from China; this first law to limit national immigration stayed in effect for 60 years.
Some exclusionists even tried to take away the citizenship of Chinese born in the United
States, but the Supreme Court slapped them down in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), saying that
all people born in the United States are citizens.
Progressing with the immigrants
Immigrants brought progress as well as strong backs. They were willing to challenge
entrenched interests, if necessary, to better working conditions. Most immigrants came from
European towns and farms, and some newcomers took the money they earned and went
back to their home countries. Almost half the Italian immigrants returned to Italy; perhaps 20
percent of other immigants went back home in the 1800s.
The new Americans who stayed had help from urban settlement houses like Jane Addams’
Hull House (1889) in Chicago and Lillian Wald’s Henry Street Settlement (1893) in New York.
Florence Kelley worked at both places and for 40 years led the fight for the welfare of ordi-
nary people. Reformers slowly got laws passed to improve the treatment of the poor.
Question: From what social and economic background did most late-1800s immigrants 
come?
Answer: They came mostly from rural and small-town Europe.
Giving the women’s-rights movement a boost
In 1820, the United States didn’t have a single female college graduate. By 1900, however, one
out of every four college graduates was a woman.
The women’s-rights movement got a platform in Women and Economics (1898), written by femi-
nist thinker Charlotte Gilman. Gilman said that women have no biological differences that nec-
essarily keep them from full participation in the world. She called for child care and takeout
food 100 years before fast food and drop-off preschool became available to working parents.
In 1890, pioneer feminists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony passed on the torch
of the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 (see Chapter 12) by founding the National American
Women’s Suffrage Association. Women cleverly linked their role in the family with getting the
vote. The concept had its roots in republican motherhood (see Chapter 10), but the argu-
ments were now both clear and not about to go away.
Hull House hero Jane Addams said men were as sloppy at running government as they were
in the home and that voting needed a woman’s touch. Carrie Catt said the growth of city life
meant that women couldn’t confine caring about the future of their families to their houses:
Family life now extended into the community, and women needed to be represented there.
The movement gained strength; most Western states allowed women to vote even before the
passage of the women’s suffrage amendment in 1920.
The AP exam will include questions on women’s rights and other social issues. Knowing the
names of the primary leaders of these movements in the 1880s will help your score. At mini-
mum, remember from the women’s movement Abigail Adams, Harriet Tubman, Elizabeth
Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony. From the black freedom movement, keep in mind W. E.
B. Du Bois, Booker T. Washington, William Lloyd Garrison, and Frederick Douglass. For labor
(discussed later in this chapter), remember Samuel Gompers, Eugene V. Debs, and Terence
Powderly.

Educating the population
The Morrill Act of 1862 (see Chapter 14) provided money from the sale of public land to state
universities; the Hatch Act of 1887 added agricultural experimentation and education to the
government-funded mix. College and high school graduation both tripled between 1870 and
1900, although those increases still meant that only 6 percent of the U.S. population stayed in
school long enough to get a high-school diploma.
Bicycles: Providing transportation for everyone
Before the automobile, bicycles set people free. Riders could tear along on dangerous-looking
high-wheel bikes at speeds that are hard to reach today. “Safety bicycles,” with two equal
wheels like the ones we ride today, made riding the rage for both men and women. By 1893,
the United States had as many bicycles as horses.
Arts and Entertainment, 
Late-19th-Century-Style
Greater education meant greater interest in reading and in entertainment in general.
Newspapers grew as most people learned to read. The invention of the linotype (1885), which
automatically set type for newpapers, caused papers to get cheaper and more colorful.
The Associated Press, founded in the 1840s, allowed newspapers all over the world to share
stories from reporters on the scene. Unfortunately, newspapers sometimes resorted to sen-
sational and often misleading yellow journalism (1895) to grab readers. The term yellow jour-
nalism comes from an early color newspaper comic strip featuring a character called the
Yellow Kid.
The rise in newspapers also led to a boost in literature and in access to public interest in art
and music, because news on these items was suddenly more public. I cover these topics in
more detail later in this chapter. Following are some other notable achievements in art and
entertainment:
 Henry Richardson designed massive civic buildings decorated with Gothic arches.
 The Chicago World’s Fair of 1893 presented the dream of a beautiful future city and
sold enough tickets to admit almost half of the population of the United States.
 Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show (1885) brought cowboys and Indians to the world, includ-
ing the crack shot Annie Oakley.
 The Barnum and Bailey Circus hit the road in 1881.
 Professional baseball got its start in the 1870s; college football was big by the 1880s;
and basketball was invented by YMCA instructor James Naismith in 1891.
Literature leading to action
Civil War General Lew Wallace thought that Christianity needed defending from attacks by
Darwinists (see Chapter 14), so he wrote a moving book called Ben-Hur (1880) that became,
like Uncle Tom’s Cabin, a best-selling international hit. The book’s main character, Judah Ben-
Hur, accidentally injures a high-ranking Roman commander, for which he suffers a life of pun-
ishment, only to be redeemed in the end by an encounter with Jesus. Ben-Hur was the first
work of fiction to be blessed by the pope.
190
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Following are other notable authors and works of the period:
 Low-profile but still beloved was Emily Dickinson (1886), whose poetry still moved
people despite the fact that she hardly left her home.
 Henry James (1889) used authentic characters to explore the world of Americans,
Europeans, and even women’s rights in Daisy Miller and The Bostonians.
 California writers brought fresh Western ideas:
• Jack London wrote about nature in The Call of the Wild (1903).
• Frank Norris took on the railroad monopoly in The Octopus (1901).
• Theodore Dreiser pioneered social realism with Sister Carrie (1900).
 Upton Sinclair created public uproar with his novel The Jungle, a muckraking exposè of
the meatpacking industry.
 Jacob Riis took pictures that changed society’s view of the poor in How the Other Half
Lives (1890). His book led a young police commissioner named Teddy Roosevelt to
close dangerous flophouses.
Question: What was Jacob Riis’s How the Other Half Lives?
Answer: The book was a photographic study of poverty in New York in the 1890s.
Artists and music
Music and art grew in popularity. Now competing with photographers, artists mixed feeling
with realism:
 Thomas Eakins (1895) ignored Victorian fashion to paint a world he considered beauti-
ful beyond the need for idealization.
 Winslow Homer (1890) painted life near the sea in beautiful watercolors.
 Augustus Saint-Gaudens (1890) made moving sculpture, including memorializing the
heroics of blacks in the Civil War.
Symphony orchestras and opera houses were founded in major American cities in the late
1800s. As black musical traditions merged with white folk music, “ragged music” became rag-
time, spirituals became blues, and rhythm became jazz (and, eventually, rock-and-roll).
A Presidential Do-Si-Do
Although the plump, stuffy, walrus-mustached presidents who ran the country from the Civil
War to the end of the 1800s may not seem very heroic, their very lack of conflict gave the
nation time to heal and grow.
James Garfield, Chester Arthur, 
and William McKinley
James Garfield didn’t get to be president long; he was shot in the back by a crazy guy 
from one of the factions in Garfield’s own Republican Party. After that, even the corruption-
challenged Republicans had had enough.
191
Chapter 15: The U.S. Goes Big Time: 1881–1899

With the help of Chester Arthur, a newly reformed vice president turned president,
Republicans surprised even themselves by passing the Magna Carta for civil-service reform,
the Pendleton Act (1883). This law required people to have qualifications and pass tests to get
government jobs. Extorting political “contributions” from government workers became ille-
gal, even if the president had appointed them.
William McKinley got to preside over the Spanish-American War and the annexation of
Hawaii at the turn of the 20th century. He rolled back civil service reforms to benefit his own
Republican party. Civil-service reform was great, but it had two drawbacks:
 Politicians couldn’t fire incompetent government employees who had slipped through
the system.
 Because elected officials couldn’t pay back political contributors with jobs, these
politicians had to pay them back with legislation.
Grover Cleveland
The voters thanked the Republicans for finally getting honest by electing a Democrat for the
first time since the Civil War. Grover Cleveland was no Progressive, but he was honest. He
vetoed a bill to provide seeds to drought-stricken farmers. “Although the people support the
government,” he said, “the government should not support the people.”
Cleveland lowered the tariff to save citizens money on imported goods and force American
manufacturers to compete. The big industrialists didn’t like competing. In the next election,
they raised a war chest and managed to beat Cleveland by a few votes. It was the first big-
business-money election in American history; many more would follow.
Benjamin Harrison
The businessmen got what they paid for. New Republican President Benjamin Harrison
pushed through the highest tariff bill ever passed, the McKinley Tariff Act (1890). The
McKinley bill set a record by taxing the average import almost 50 percent. As an example,
this tax made an imported coffeepot worth $10 cost $15.
U.S. industrialists were delighted because they had less competition. U.S. manufacturers
could raise their protected prices and make more profit. Regular people couldn’t help notic-
ing they were paying high prices for both imported and protected domestic goods.
The return of Grover Cleveland
Voters took most of the seats away from the Republicans in the House of Representatives
and brought honest Grover Cleveland back again — the only president to win reelection after
being out of office.
While Cleveland was making his comeback in the 1892 election, the new Populist Party man-
aged to get more than 1 million votes. The party’s platform called for a graduated income tax,
government ownership of railroads and telephones, the direct election of U.S. senators, an 
eight-hour workday, and immigration reform. They never elected a president, but the Popu-
lists saw much of their program become law. The Populists also tried to help the Southern
blacks, which made white Southerners angry. The whites tightened the Jim Crow laws so that
almost no blacks got to vote in the South.
192
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Cleveland had to face the Depression of 1893, the worst economic downturn of the 1800s.
Strapped for cash to run the government, he turned to J.P. Morgan, the richest banker in the
country. Morgan and his banker friends came up with the money, but they charged a com-
mission of more than 10 percent. In the face of economic troubles, Cleveland couldn’t get the
tariff reductions he had promised through Congress, and the Republicans took control again
in the next election.
Getting Down to Business
The United States went from also-ran to Number One among the manufacturing nations of
the world in the 30 years after the Civil War. This amazing growth was based on profits,
people, and products:
 The Civil War was terrible where the bullets were flying, but the North came through
with almost no destruction and a lot of money earned by supplying the army. It
invested much of that profit in new businesses.
 People kept coming to America. Many of them were hard workers willing to put in 
12-hour days if that’s what it took to move their families up the economic ladder.
 The United States almost burst with inventive ingenuity, creating new products like
Alexander Bell’s telephone (1876), the typewriter, the cash register, and the electric
streetcar. Thomas Edison’s electric light (1879), combined with the distribution system
he designed to power it, changed the world. Before bright lights, people used to sleep
at night. Edison also invented the phonograph (ancestor of the MP3 player) and the
movies that led to DVDs.
The rise of the millionaire businessman
Ambitious businessmen learned how to take advantage of all this profit, people, and product
innovation; that’s how they became rich.
Andrew Carnegie
Andrew Carnegie (1890) ran a steelmaking operation that proved the power of vertical integra-
tion — controlling everything you need to make a product. Carnegie miners dug iron ore out
of frozen northern Minnesota and loaded it onto Carnegie ships, which steamed across the
Great Lakes to Carnegie trains, which took the ore to Carnegie blast furnaces running night
and day in Pittsburgh.
Carnegie also helped fund thousands of public libraries, thus spreading “the poor people’s
university” all over the country. Carnegie wrote The Gospel of Wealth, a book that said rich
people had a responsibility to spend their money in a way that would help poor people better
themselves. By 1920, the United States had thousands of free public libraries — more than in
the rest of the world combined — and half of them were built with help from Carnegie.
John D. Rockefeller
Using a different approach, John D. Rockefeller (1885) built Standard Oil into a company by
using horizontal integration — controlling all the outlets for selling a product. Standard Oil
drove retail and wholesale competitors out of business. Rockefeller said, “The day of combi-
nation is here to stay. Individualism has gone, never to return.”
Rockefeller did whales an unexpected favor when he organized Standard Oil in 1870: The
kerosene he made from petroleum gave much better light than the expensive whale oil that
193
Chapter 15: The U.S. Goes Big Time: 1881–1899

people had previously burned in lamps. Cans of kerosene from Standard Oil were invariably
one of the first American products to arrive as U.S. commerce spread all over the world.
Electric lights soon made kerosene obsolete, but freeways would lead to other uses for oil.
J.P. Morgan
J.P. Morgan (1895) controlled banks he didn’t even own with interlocking directorates, using
people who shared seats on many boards of directors. When a group of businesses con-
spired to fix prices, it was called a trust.
North versus South in manufacturing and tobacco
The South took a long time to do much manufacturing; it was farther behind the North in
industrialization in 1900 than it had been before the war. Even making cloth from cotton
lagged in the South; although Southerners had built a few textile mills by 1900, two-thirds of
the cloth was still being made in the North.
The only good thing for the South was bad for people: The invention of the cigarette-
manufacturing machine in the 1880s got Americans smoking in a big way. The machine 
meant more tobacco production and a cigarette-manufacturing industry for the South.
Breaking in against Northern firms on established products was tough. Birmingham,
Alabama, just happened to have iron ore, coal, and limestone all close to town — perfect for
making steel. Northern railroads slowed this competition on behalf of their Pittsburgh steel-
making buddies by charging Birmingham steelmakers inflated shipping rates, as though they
were sending their steel from Pittsburgh.
Private enterprise and antitrust laws
State governments tried to regulate the railroads but were pushed aside when the Supreme
Court ruled in the Wabash Cases (1886) that states can’t regulate interstate commerce, mean-
ing that the states had to keep their hands off any business that worked between two or
more states.
Congress knew it had to do something, so it passed the Interstate Commerce Act (1887). This
legislation set up the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). Although the ICC didn’t have
much power to take on the powerful railroads, it at least established the principle that the
public has an interest in private enterprise that the government has a duty to protect.
Besides the transportation companies, a number of other virtual monopoly trusts like steel
and telephones took advantage of the public. To deal with companies so big that they
stopped competition, Congress passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (1890). The term antitrust
law has persisted in the United States as what the rest of the world calls competition laws,
designed to make sure that consumers get fair prices based on competition, not price-fixing
by businesses.
Attacking the victims, the Anti-Trust Act was even used against union organization in its
early days, until the Clayton Act stopped it in 1914 (see Chapter 16). As with the ICC, the
Anti-Trust Act took years to stand up to business.

Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Hard Times and Labor Unions
Even with some brave efforts, the working face of America wasn’t what the founding fathers
had imagined. The century started with Thomas Jefferson’s dream of independent farmers
creating a democratic utopia and ended with most of America working for other people.
During the last 20 years of the 1800s, several hundred thousand unskilled workers a year
landed on America’s shores, looking for work. This influx of workers made it easy for bosses
to hire people at low wages — pay so low that whole families had to work, kids included.
Child labor went on until the 1930s, when photographs of children as young as 8 in danger-
ous jobs, taken by pioneering documentary photographer Lewis Hine (1910), finally made the
government take action. Some employers took advantage of workers, charging them high
prices in company stores and threatening them if they tried to organize.
Labor-union organizations grew as a result of bad treatment and low wages. The Knights of
Labor (see Chapter 14) had close to 1 million members by 1886. Terence Powderly of the
Knights denounced multimillionaire businessmen for “laying the foundation for their colossal
fortunes on the bodies and souls of living men.”
A demonstration in that year in Chicago’s Haymarket Square turned to violence when a
bomb was thrown, killing a policeman. Eight union leaders were arrested. Even though no
evidence showed that any of the leaders had anything to do with the bomb, five were sen-
tenced to death and three to stiff prison terms.
Association with violence, even though the Knights of Labor didn’t cause it, cooled support
for the organization. When a new organization of skilled workers called the American
Federation of Labor (AFL) was formed later that year, it gradually took over the union fight
from the Knights. AFL President Samuel Gompers concentrated only on skilled workers and
knew how to work within the system to improve the position of working people gradually.
Question: What kind of labor unions made up the AFL?
Answer: Only skilled worker labor unions were admitted to the AFL.
Coxey’s Army (1894), a small band of determined protestors, marched across the country to
Washington, D.C., to demand jobs and federal help. During the Pullman strike (1894), in which
workers blocked the railroad tracks to protest cuts in pay without cuts in company-housing
rent, federal troops moved in against striking laborers for the first time. Union leader Eugene
Debs, realizing that the system had to change, later ran for president.
For the time being, big business and big government appeared to have joined to keep poor
people in their place. When William Jennings Bryan ran against William McKinley in 1896, the
conservatives triumphed decisively. People with jobs and unmortaged farms didn’t want to
take a chance of losing them to free silver and free trade. The Dingley Tariff Bill (1897) made
imported goods cost more than ever, so that domestic industries could charge more without
foreign competition. Gold stayed the standard, but new gold discoveries in Alaska, Canada,
and elsewhere helped the money supply. The causes of women, workers, and blacks slowly
edged toward acceptance in the public mind.
Question: What was the cause of the Pullman strike?
Answer: Pullman cut workers’ pay without a corresponding cut in workers’ rent.
195
Chapter 15: The U.S. Goes Big Time: 1881–1899

Hard times for farmers, too
Major machinery became available to farmers in the 1880s. If you had a place big enough
that you could afford it, a single machine could plow, plant, and work the seeds into the soil.
The amazing combine coupled a machine that cut grain with another machine that threshed
the grain off the stems and into bags, ready to sell. People don’t become farmers because
they like to do high finance, and a lot of landowners got caught in a financial squeeze by
over-borrowing and overproduction.
Pushed by the banks and exploited by big business, farmers fought back in almost every way
they could, trying to regulate railroads, organize cooperatives, form a political party, and
even inflate the currency. But they never did what the trusts did every day: limited produc-
tion to raise prices. That strategy would have taken more organization and trust than inde-
pendent farmers could muster.
Question: What did farmers do to improve their financial situation?
Answer: They tried to lower railroad charges, organize production cooperatives, and get 
political help. Unlike monopoly capitalists, however, they never held down supply to 
increase demand and price.
Because more land and better farm equipment were available, the price that farmers got paid
for a bushel of wheat fell from $1 at the time of the Civil War to 50 cents in 1890. Loans that
farmers had taken out to grow more wheat cost twice as much wheat to repay.
Meanwhile, the nation got used to paying cheap prices for beautiful California produce, har-
vested by poorly paid Mexican and Chinese labor, and shipped east in the railroads’ new
refrigerator cars. Small family farmers went deeper into debt.
Question: How did farms change in size and equipment in the late 1800s?
Answer: More and bigger farms were available, with better equipment.
Farmers’ “party” with laborers
Farmers joined with laborers to support cheap money and progressive causes through the
Greenback Labor Party (1878) and the Populist Party (1892). Neither party won the presidency,
but each polled as much as 10 percent of the votes and elected enough legislators to sway
the Democrats in their direction.
Third parties have played a big part in American history; don’t get them confused. Here’s a
rundown of major third parties in the 1800s:
 In 1832, the Anti-Masonic Party, seeking the eradication of the Freemasons and other
secret societies from the United States, received a few votes.
 In 1848, the Free Soil Party, a precursor of the Republican Party, nominated former
President Martin Van Buren as its presidential candidate, splitting the vote in New York
and causing the election of Zachary Taylor.
 In 1856, parts of the disintegrating Whig Party teamed up with the Know-Nothing Party,
which opposed foreign immigration. Even as a team, the parties came in third behind
Democrat James Buchanan and John C. Fremont of the newly formed Republican Party.
 In 1860, four major candidates ran for president, including candidates from the break-
away Southern Democratic Party and the last-ditch-compromise Constitutional Union
196
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Party. Republican Abraham Lincoln was elected with only 39 percent of the vote and
wasn’t even on the ballot in many states.
 In 1892, the Populist Party won 22 electoral votes and 8.6 percent of the popular vote.
The Democratic Party eventually adopted many Populist Party positions, making this
contest a good example of a delayed vote for change.
Settling the West: The End 
of Wide-Open Spaces?
Settlers rode the railroads to new homes in the West as American Indians were driven out 
of their wide-open country to try to survive on confined reservations. Said one American
Indian, “The antelope have gone; the buffalo wallows are empty. . . . We are like birds with a
broken wing.”
James Earle Fraser’s famous End of the Trail (1915), an image of an American Indian on horse-
back with bowed head and downcast lance, was reproduced so many times that it seemed to
symbolize the end of wide-open-spaces freedom for urbanized settlers as well as the free life
of Great Plains American Indians.
In one of the few times a professional historian actually made history, Frederick Turner gave
a speech called “The Significance of the Frontier in the American History” at the Chicago
World’s Fair of 1893. Turner said that the American character was formed by the possibilities
of the open frontier — a frontier, he announced, that was closing.
Maybe it was time to get powdered wigs and start dancing the minuet again. Actually, the
frontier was as much a state of mind as a place. At the same time Turner was announcing the
end of the West, the government was creating permanently open land with the world’s first
national parks in Yosemite, Yellowstone, and Sequoia. These preserves were the first of hun-
dreds of national parks and forests.
Pressure on American Indians
Even American Indians’ small reservations were threatened under the Dawes Severalty Act
(1887), which tried to break up tribes and split up land for ownership by individual American
Indian families. By 1900, American Indian tribes had lost more than half of the limited land
onto which they’d been crowded 20 years before. Native families were forced to accept pri-
vate allotments of poor land on which they’d be separated from their tribal culture. When
this resulted in surplus land, the government sold it off at bargain prices to settlers.
The shortsighted policy of trying to make American Indians into settler farmers on land that
wouldn’t support crops lasted until the American Indian New Deal of the 1930s recognized
American Indians as full U.S. citizens. One last American Indian massacre occurred in 1890,
however, when federal troops opened fire with machine guns on American Indians gathering
for a sacred dance at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, killing 200 men, women, and children.
From a low of fewer than 250,000 American Indians at the close of the Western frontier in
1890, the U.S. American Indian population rebounded to 1.5 million urban and rural American
Indians by 2000.
Question: What was the main policy of the United States toward American Indians from 
1877 to the New Deal?
Answer: To break up tribes and give individual American Indians their own land.
197
Chapter 15: The U.S. Goes Big Time: 1881–1899

Helen Jackson’s Ramona
People who fought for American Indian rights included Helen Jackson, who wrote the factual
story of mistreatment in A Century of Dishonor (1881) and then the popular novel Ramona
(1884).
Ramona is the story of a part-American Indian, part-Scottish girl in California. With black hair
and blue eyes, Ramona is reared in a privileged ranch family until she falls in love with the
poor son of an American Indian chief. The book sold 600,000 copies and spawned plays,
movies, and even towns.
People loved the story so much that they named buildings for Ramona; localities competed
with claims to be the inspiration for her homeland. Unfortunately, the story missed its imme-
diate goal of winning widespread sympathy for the plight of American Indians; instead, it
touched off the American love of Spanish mission architecture that lives on today in many
Mexican restaurants. Ramona did encourage the trend toward thinking of the defeated
American Indians as being somehow noble and worthy of humane treatment. Long after the
story was forgotten, its meaning moved society.
Backing Paper Money with Precious Metals
After the California gold rush that began in 1849 and lasted into the 1850s came the Nevada
Silver bonanza of the 1860s. Scattered gold and silver discoveries also popped up in other
Western states. All this glittering metal allowed the U.S. Treasury to back paper money with
gold by 1879 (see Chapter 14).
The many senators who represented the few people living in the low-population, high-
treasure West pushed for the government to buy more precious metal. This push combined
with the belief of debt-ridden workers and farmers that money based on silver would ease
their woes by making loans easier to repay with inflated cheap money (see Chapter 14).
At the Democratic Party convention in 1896, presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan
made his famous “cross of gold” speech, which emotionally compared the Republicans, who
demanded money tied only to gold, to the Romans who crucified Jesus. Poor people were
elated; rich people were horrified. Backed by middle-class fear and upper-class financing, the
Republicans easily beat Bryan.
Question: What was William Jennings Bryan’s “cross of gold” speech?
Answer: Delivered to the Democratic convention that nominated him for president, the 
speech called for the inflationary use of silver money to keep poor people from being 
crucified by golden hard money on the bankers’ “cross of gold.”
Being the Nicest Imperialist
As the 1800s drew to a close, America was bursting at the seams. It had been the longest time
in U.S. history without a war, and the country needed something to distract itself from its
economic troubles. The European powers were in a final imperialistic feeding frenzy, gob-
bling up bits of Africa and Asia they’d overlooked before.
198
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Could the United States, founded on anticolonialism, stay out of the game? As the Washington
Post editorialized, “The taste of Empire is in the mouth of the people even as the taste of
blood is in the jungle.” Some people believed social Darwinism proved that the United States
must rule because it could rule.
The old Monroe Doctrine (see Chapter 11) got enforced in 1896 when the United States
offered to mediate in a conflict between Venezuela and Britain on the border of British colony
British Guiana in South America. After blowing America off at first, the British got all friendly
and agreeable when they found themselves up to their knees in the Boer War in Africa. Score
one for the United States.
Annexing Hawaii
Hawaii had been flirting with the United States since it became a whaling supply station in the
early 1800s and the site of a major American missionary effort. Thanks to missionaries, Hawaii
actually had the first printing press west of the Mississippi. Thanks to the king of Hawaii, 
John Sutter founded Sacramento (and touched off the gold rush) with the help of Hawaiian
workers. The sons of the first missionaries planted sugar cane, and the Hawaiian government
granted Pearl Harbor to the United States as a naval base.
When the McKinley Tariff made it more expensive to sell Hawaiian sugar in the United States,
the American sugar planters in Hawaii had an easy solution. They deposed Queen Liliuokalani
and asked to be admitted to the United States; Hawaii wouldn’t be subject to the tariff if it
were part of the United States. For five years, the United States held Hawaii off as a point of
honor — it didn’t want to be associated with land-grabbing. With the outbreak of the
Spanish-American War, the United States got over the honor thing and annexed Hawaii.
Fighting the Spanish-American War
Sugar also made problems in Cuba when high U.S. import duties caused fewer sales and
more hardship for the sugar workers. The workers rose in revolt against the Spanish colonial
government, which suppressed them severely.
The United States was sympathetic to the workers’ plight, and yellow journalists egged the
country on toward war with Spain. Sensational newspaperman William Randolph Hearst sent
famous Western artist Frederick Remington to Cuba to draw pictures of the atrocities. When
Remington cabled that conditions weren’t bad enough for a war, Hearst cabled back, “Please
remain. You furnish the pictures and I’ll furnish the war.”
Losing the battleship Maine
At the worst possible time for the Spanish, the U.S. battleship Maine, which had been sent to
Cuba on a goodwill visit, blew up in Havana harbor. Four independent investigations over the
past 100 years have come to four different conclusions about what caused the explosion, but
at the time everybody but the Spanish believed that Spain had torched it. Congress voted to
invade Cuba, but also passed the Teller Amendment (1898), which promised to free Cuba
after the island was free of the Spanish.
Using some tricky fighting, the United States first attacked the Spanish not in Cuba but in
Spain’s Philippine Islands colony, halfway around the world. The U.S. fleet sailed into Manila
harbor, pulverized the Spanish fleet, and then sat around sweltering through the tropical
199
Chapter 15: The U.S. Goes Big Time: 1881–1899

summer, waiting for American troops to get there and take the islands. With the help of
Filipino insurrectionists, the American army made short work of the Spanish troops.
Cuba was the same story. The American navy smashed the Spanish without losing a ship,
and the American army, with Teddy Roosevelt leading the Rough Riders, quickly defeated the
Spanish troops. The army still had a few Civil War veterans from 33 years before;
Northerners and Southerners felt good about fighting on the same side.
Letting Cuba go but keeping the rest
To end the one-sided Spanish-American War, Spain agreed to give the United States control of
Cuba, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico. The United States, feeling a little guilty, generously
kicked in $20 million for the Philippines, because they were kind of a bonus for freeing Cuba.
Puerto Rico came as a free bonus, which America decided to keep.
U.S. expansionism at the end of the 1800s is a natural stopping place for any essay discussion
on Manifest Destiny you may have to undertake on AP U.S. History game day. Remember:
Imperialism is keeping colonies; expansionism is adding land that becomes a real part of the
mother country. With the Philippines free, Hawaii a territory, and Puerto Rico regularly
voting to stay with the United States, the end of the United States’ 1890s overseas adventures
came out as expansionism.
The United States set Cuba free as promised, keeping only a naval base at Guantanamo Bay,
which was a little bigger than Manhattan. Having cleaned its clock once, the United States felt
free to intervene in Cuba any time it wanted until Fidel Castro took power in 1958.
Fighting in the Philippines
The Philippines were trickier. European countries, especially Germany, were still sniffing
around the world for colonies. The United States decided to keep the Philippines for a few
years to add some schools and roads and stuff. That meant fighting a bloody war against the
same Filipino revolutionaries who had just finished helping America get rid of the Spanish.
The Philippines conflict lasted for five years and led to the deaths of thousands of soldiers
on both sides and hundreds of thousands of civilians caught in the crossfire. The United
States finally freed the Philippines in 1946, after World War II.
Rebelling against the idea of empire
The U.S. flirtation with empire, especially keeping the Philippines, was opposed by a lot of
Americans, including Mark Twain, Andrew Carnegie, former President Grover Cleveland, Jane
Addams, and the presidents of Harvard and Stanford universities.
Eventually, the imperialist eagle came to rest with the release of Cuba and the Philippines;
Puerto Rico and Hawaii were mostly cool about staying part of the United States. As the
United States increasingly became a Big Dog world power, the temptation to push smaller
nations around never went away.
Question: What was the biggest controversy following the Spanish-American War?
Answer: Americans debated whether freedom-loving America had any right to keep the 
Philippine Islands unfree, as a colony.

In This Chapter
 Trying to be a good imperialist
 Following the Teddy Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson presidencies
 Sweeping America’s shortcomings out from under the rug
 Making progress with the Progressives
 Marching into World War I
A
t the beginning of the 20th century, the U.S. was all dressed up for a world party but
not too sure about going into the dance. America’s somewhat-reluctant empire
extended halfway around the globe, so the country was beginning to look like an interna-
tional player. But people still remembered the Founding Fathers’ warnings to stay away
from entangling foreign hassles, and they were more concerned with the economic and
social work to do at home.
After years of holding off change, the U.S. shifted into high gear and went trucking down the
road to major reform when the odometer of history flipped over to 1900. Just when the
Progressives were looking for even more corruption to haul away, the U.S. got dragged into
World War I. After tipping the balance toward victory in the war, the nation got so moral at
the peace negotiations that it couldn’t stand itself. By not quite agreeing to sign on for its
own ideals, the U.S. unintentionally ensured that it would have to fight for them again. But
World War II is a story for Chapter 18; this chapter is about what happened in the early 20th
century leading up to World War I.
For the test, the way the political, economic, and social (PES) system works is to associate a
PES topic in italics with a date (in parenthesis), like Progressives (1910). (See Chapter 1 for
more on the PES system.) The big AP test doesn’t care much about exact dates, but you do
need to be able to keep the highlights in chronological order. If the PES topic is a law, the
date is when it was passed, like the Seventeenth Amendment (1913). If the topic is an institu-
tion like Hull House (1889) or a person like John D. Rockefeller (1885), the date is just a repre-
sentative year in what could be a long career. Remember, the date in parentheses is just an
approximate time signal.
More Substitute Teacher than Cop: 
The U.S. in Asia
In 1899, the Americans and the Filipinos were standing side by side waving goodbye to the
Spanish colonists when the native independence fighters realized something was wrong with
this picture: The Yankees weren’t leaving.

After five years of the U.S. Army slogging through the jungle led by ex-American-Indian-fighters
from the Wild West, the Americans managed to knock out all the major rebel armies at a cost
of thousands of soldiers and hundreds of thousands of civilian lives. The rewards to the U.S.
were slight; it got a naval base and a jumping-off place for activity in Asia. The Filipinos
learned some English in the schools Americans helped build but were quite happy to finally
get their freedom on July 4th, 1946 — see Chapter 18.
China and the Open Door Policy
Colonialism made little European countries feel like big dogs, so they tried to nip off pieces
such as Hong Kong from large-but-weak China. The U.S. didn’t want to nab China, but the
nation also didn’t want other countries to set up permanent shop and exclude them from the
party. So the U.S., consulting more or less with the other major players, issued the Open Door
Policy (1899). All foreign nations in China were supposed to respect Chinese rights and let
other countries bid fairly on commercial contracts. To the Chinese, it felt like an agreement
among the bullies about how to fairly divide the lunch money they stole.
Question: What was the Open Door Policy?
Answer: A U.S.-sponsored agreement among Western nations to respect Chinese rights 
and let other countries bid fairly on commercial contracts.
The Boxer Rebellion
Chinese anti-Westerners called the Boxers murdered Western missionaries and besieged
Western diplomats holed up in the capital of Beijing. Western governments quickly threw
together an eight-nation rescue/invasion force of 20,000 soldiers to put down the Boxer
Rebellion (1900).
The United States contributed a couple of thousand troops handily located in the Philippines.
The Western diplomats barricaded their offices into one big fort and held out for 55 days
with nothing but one old cannon until help arrived.
China had to pay a huge amount of money for the trouble some of their citizens had caused
the Westerners. Shame over their weakness led the Chinese to get rid of the ancient Empress
Dowager and start a more modern government. The U.S. used some of its share of the money
to educate Chinese students in America.
Rough Riding with the Teddy Bear
A nation happy to be a world power without having to do much fighting overwhelmingly
reelected William McKinley for a second term. This time, plump and popular McKinley was
almost overshadowed by his rambunctious running mate, Theodore Roosevelt, hero of the
Spanish-American War.
The political bosses in New York State were so happy to see their reform-minded energy-ball
governor Roosevelt leave to run for vice president that they would have bought him the
office if they could just to get rid of him.
Teddy toured with cowboys and cut into the rural and Western support for the Democratic
nominee, good old cross-of-gold William Jennings Bryan. In the end, the election wasn’t even
202
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

close — McKinley and Roosevelt won because although a lot of people didn’t like imperial-
ism, they were more afraid of Bryan’s crazy economic theories.
The U.S. didn’t get long with safe and sane William McKinley; a crazy anarchist gunned him
down at the 1901 world’s fair in Buffalo. Although the fair displayed an early X-ray machine,
doctors didn’t know how to use it, so they never removed the bullet, which would have
saved McKinley’s life. Worse, they had to operate in a room without electric lights. Electricity
was relatively new, and although the outside of the building had beautiful lights all over it, no
one had thought to put one in the medical department on the inside. At 42, Rough Rider
Teddy Roosevelt became the youngest president ever.
The rise of Teddy Roosevelt
Theodore Roosevelt was a whirlwind. One of the greatest and toughest presidents in
American history, Roosevelt was so sickly as a child that he had to sleep sitting up to keep
from dying of asthma. His father insisted that he exercise and take up boxing to keep from
being beaten up by bullies. Even though a doctor told him that his heart condition would
keep him at a desk job, Roosevelt just increased his activity.
Roosevelt was brilliant, graduating from Harvard magna cum laude. He wrote books about
U.S. Navy battles in the War of 1812 and a four-volume history of the West, both of which
scholars still cite today. Roosevelt’s first presidency was as leader of the American Historical
Association.
When his mother and his young wife both happened to die on the same day, Roosevelt
headed west. He built a ranch in the Dakota Territory and learned shooting, riding, and
roping. Elected deputy sheriff, he single handedly brought in three desperados, guarding
them without sleeping for almost two days by reading Tolstoy to keep awake. He later mar-
ried his childhood sweetheart and took her on a honeymoon to Europe, where he climbed
Mont Blanc, the highest peak in the Alps.
Appointed to the Civil Service Commission, he served with such fairness that even after the
Democrats won the White House, they kept Progressive Republican Roosevelt at his post. As
the police commissioner of New York, he cleaned up the police department, often calling offi-
cers in the middle of the night to make sure they were on duty.
Roosevelt had always loved the Navy, so Republican President William McKinley appointed
him Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Assistant was enough power for Roosevelt; he pretty
much ran things over the head of his boss and modernized the Navy.
When the Spanish-American War broke out, Roosevelt quit his desk job and organized a regi-
ment of volunteers called the Rough Riders: cowboys, American Indians, polo players, and
policemen. Fighting alongside a black regiment, they did well in the key battles of the fight
for Cuba. See Chapter 15 for more on the Spanish-American War.
The Big-Stick philosophy
When news of McKinley’s assassination reached Roosevelt, he was camping in the moun-
tains. Even before becoming president, he used to speak publicly in favor of speaking softly
but carrying a big stick. Teddy worked to carry out McKinley’s careful policies, but he began
to use his famous Big Stick to support progressive laws as he became comfortable as presi-
dent. Roosevelt charmed his opponents with talk and threatened them with the Big Stick of
power. Roosevelt began the practice of busting up trusts (corporations that controlled whole
203
Chapter 16: Into the World, Ready or Not: 1900–1919

industries so they could fix prices) to encourage competition and lower prices for cus-
tomers. See Chapter 15 for more on trusts.
Don’t get mesmerized by Theodore Roosevelt’s Big-Stick philosophy and think that he made
all the progress in the 1900s. Roosevelt’s successor, William Taft, actually busted more trusts
than Teddy. Roosevelt set the tone, but he was balanced and opportunistic in his politics.
Building the Panama Canal
One place Theodore Roosevelt didn’t settle for incremental progress was in dealing with
other nations. When the nation of Columbia wouldn’t let the United States build a canal
through its Panama district, Teddy helped set up a revolution in which Panama became an
independent country. The new country was — big surprise — thrilled to have a U.S.-owned
canal running through the middle of it.
Teddy became the first president to leave U.S. soil when he energetically dashed down to
Panama to help with the digging. Health workers figured out how to protect people from
yellow fever and malaria as the result of America’s interest in surviving in both the canal and
in Cuba. The Panama Canal (1914) was a big success, cutting sailing time between the
Atlantic and Pacific by more than half. The U.S. finally turned the canal over to Panama in
1999 after owning it for almost 100 years.
The Roosevelt Corollary
Teddy also created the overreaching Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine (1905), also
known as preventive intervention. The original Monroe Doctrine (1823) said that the United
States would defend the New World from any further attempts at Old World colonization.
The Roosevelt Corollary said that to keep the little countries of South America from being
taken over by bad Europeans, the U.S. would step in with good Americans but only to help
them. Well, maybe also to help some big businessmen. U.S. troops invaded six Latin
American countries but kept none of them as colonies.
Question: What was the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine?
Answer: The U.S. would prevent the intervention of Old World powers in Latin America 
by intervening itself as necessary.
Nativism and the Great White Fleet
Still squabbling over the China situation, Japan and Russia fought a war in 1904. Roosevelt
got them to a conference table in the U.S. and hammered out a peace agreement, for which
he won a Nobel Peace Prize. Roosevelt sent the entire U.S. Navy, painted white, on an around-
the-world cruise as The Great White Fleet (1908), symbolizing both American purity and
strength.
In 1906, he made a secret deal with the Japanese to limit immigration, thus reassuring
California, which was beginning to work up an Asian paranoia again after having previously
excluded the Chinese. The movement to limit immigration, called nativism, grew in the early
204
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

1900s due to increases in the foreign-born population, competition for jobs, and paranoia
about imported radicals.
Question: What influenced the rise of nativism in the early 1900s?
Answer: Increases in the foreign-born population, competition for jobs, and paranoia 
about imported radicals. California was a center of anti-Asian feeling.
Exposing the Shortcomings of Society
Although change sometimes begins slowly, it can be pretty rambunctious after it gets 
going. The U.S. had always had a Progressive movement, even as early as Abigail Adams’s
remember-the-ladies letter before the Revolution. Although “walrus” presidents (with their
slow-moving politics and big business) seemed to dominate the post-Civil War 1800s, the
Greenback Labor party of the 1870s and the Populist party of the 1890s also got in on the act.
Progressive thinkers rejected the Social Darwinism of unregulated business and called for
government action because concentrations of wealth were hurting, not improving, society.
Women and working people didn’t win their crusades, but they also didn’t give up. Upper-
class suffragettes worked for the women’s vote and improved living conditions through
urban settlement houses like Jane Addams’s Hull House (1889) in Chicago and Lillian Wald’s
Henry Street Settlement (1893) in New York. Women’s clubs blossomed from 100,000 members
in the 1890s to more than 1 million by World War I.
Question: Why did Progressives reject Social Darwinism?
Answer: Because the natural competition of unregulated business seemed to be hurting 
people, not helping society to evolve.
Muckraking becomes an art
Exposing the shortcomings of society became a major occupation with the increase in the
circulation of newspapers, popular magazines, and books in the early 1900s. People seemed
to be able to dredge up almost any hidden secret. Lincoln Steffens (1902) wrote The Shame of
the Cities, detailing municipal corruption in leading towns. Ida Tarbell (1904) exposed the
monopolistic practices of the Standard Oil Company that had ruined her father. Thomas
Lawson (1905), himself a major stock manipulator, tattled on the trust scammers in Frenzied
Finance. Other socially conscious authors examined legislative corruption in The Treason of
the Senate (1906), the slow progress of the blacks in Following the Color Line (1908), and child
labor in The Bitter Cry of Children (1906). Teddy Roosevelt called these reformers muckrakers
(1904) because they insisted on cleaning up the country by looking down at the mucky mess.
Question: What helped muckrakers publicize their investigations?
Answer: The growth in the popular press, magazines, and books.
Clearing away bad food
Dr. Harvey Wiley worked from within the government with a Poison Squad to uncover
enough bad food to lead to the Pure Food and Drug Act (1906), forcing manufacturers to use
safe ingredients and honest labels.
205
Chapter 16: Into the World, Ready or Not: 1900–1919

The Jungle (1906) by muckraker Upton Sinclair sickened the public with its description of
what went on inside the food industry and led to the Meat Inspection Act of 1906. Federal
inspectors visited packing houses to work toward protecting people from being poisoned by
their own food. Like the novel Ramona (see Chapter 15), which intended to save American
Indians but ended up initially saving Mission architecture, The Jungle intended to save work-
ers but ended up saving the food they processed.
Charting progress with the Progressives
Forward-thinking attempts to clean up politics became a cause for both political parties. 
The Progressives (1910) succeeded because they weren’t marginalized as dangerous radicals:
Progressives were middle- and even upper-class reformers working to fix the system from
within.
Question: Why were the Progressives so successful?
Answer: They were respectable middle-class reformers with popular support.
To get around the influence of political bosses, Progressives introduced the initiative system
so that voters could propose and vote on new laws without going through the legislature.
The still-ongoing attempts to limit campaign contributions and the corruption they can bring
began with the Progressives passing campaign financing laws in a few states in the early
1900s. Previously, voters had to mark ballots in public, and party bosses could see how
people voted; the Progressives made the secret Australian ballot the national standard.
Often-corrupt state legislatures elected Senators until Progressives passed the Seventeenth
Amendment (1913), which mandated the election of Senators by the people.
In the key Supreme Court case of Muller v. Oregon (1908), Progressive attorney Louis Brandeis
convinced the Court that states have a right to protect employees in the workplace; in this
case, that meant protecting women from having to work more than 10 hours a day. Brandeis
went on to become the first Jewish high official when he himself joined the Supreme Court.
The tragic industrial Triangle Shirtwaist Fire (1911) claimed the lives of almost 150 women
workers but led to legal regulation of workplaces. By the time of World War I, more than half
of the states had laws providing some worker’s compensation to people injured on the job.
Prohibition rode along with other causes; by 1914 more than half of the country had prohib-
ited the sale of liquor.
Implementing Roosevelt’s Square Deal
Theodore Roosevelt promised Americans a Square Deal: He would control the big corpora-
tions, protect consumers, and conserve the environment. When coal miners stayed on strike
for almost half a year, it looked like a frozen winter for the many people who heated their
homes with coal. Roosevelt called employers and workers into the White House and became
the first president to hammer out a labor agreement. He threatened to use federal troops
against the mine owners if they didn’t compromise — a big change from previous govern-
ment actions, when the troops were always ordered in against the workers. Congress created
the Department of Commerce and Labor (1903) to oversee both business and workers.
Question: How did President Roosevelt handle the coal strike?
Answer: He became the first president to arbitrate a labor settlement.
206
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

The all-powerful railroads got slapped around a bit when the Elkins Act (1902) prohibited
rebates that kept rates high for little shippers and the Hepburn Act (1906) ended the practice
of giving free passes to anyone who could write or pass laws against the transportation com-
panies. The heretofore wimpy Interstate Commerce Commission actually got the power to
take action against fares that gouged the public.
Roosevelt busted his first big trust with the Northern Securities Company (1904). Famous rich
guy J.P. Morgan and his friends were trying to monopolize railroads in the Northwest.
Roosevelt slapped them down, and the Supreme Court backed him. Teddy Roosevelt didn’t
believe that big business was automatically bad. He was just against businesses that con-
trolled a market so that they could unfairly make people pay high prices. He probably 
wouldn’t have minded today’s big-box stores as long as they allowed real competition.
Preserving the American Wilderness
Teddy Roosevelt went camping with the famous environmentalist John Muir and got really
committed to saving land. Because the frontier was no longer limitless, the U.S. started lock-
ing up land for the future in parks and national forests.
Before Roosevelt, the U.S. had the Forest Reserve Act (1891), which set aside some land, but
most of the country was open to exploitation by loggers, miners, ranchers, or anybody else
with a profitable way to use it up.
First Roosevelt increased the value of Western land by supporting the Newlands Reclamation
Act (1902), which resulted in damming nearly every river in the West to irrigate nearby fields.
Then he set aside almost 200 million acres of land for national forests and parks — way more
land than all the previous presidents combined.
Working with farsighted Forest Service head Gifford Pinchot, Roosevelt created 42 million
acres of national forests, 53 national wildlife refuges, and 18 areas of special interest like the
Grand Canyon. Americans responded by joining new outdoor organizations like the Boy
Scouts, Girl Scouts, and Sierra Club (founded by Roosevelt’s buddy Muir).
Roosevelt Gives Way to Taft and then Wilson
Roosevelt rode out a financial panic in 1907 by passing the Aldrich-Vreeland Act (1908), which
provided for the issuance of emergency currency and paved the way for the National Reserve
Act (1913) that’s still responsible for dealing with national financial problems.
He easily won reelection in 1904 and supported William Howard Taft as his successor when
his second term expired in 1908. Most of the nation wanted him to stay on as president, but
he went hunting in Africa instead.
Trust-busting with William Howard Taft
President William Howard Taft had a hard act to follow. Fat and jovial, Taft tried to stick to
Roosevelt’s policies without Roosevelt’s vision or charm. He took on the U.S. Steel trust and
a number of other monopolies, carefully following laws passed under Roosevelt.
207
Chapter 16: Into the World, Ready or Not: 1900–1919

Taft and the trusts
The Supreme Court ordered that Standard Oil Company be broken up in 1911. At the same
time, the Court issued a rule of reason that said the law applied only to companies that unrea-
sonably restrain trade, thus making it harder to bust trusts. Even so, Taft went after twice as
many monopolies as Teddy actually sued.
Republican businessmen generally liked high tariffs on imported goods; it made their prod-
ucts easier to sell at a profit. Problem was, the Progressive wing of their own party called
high tariffs the Mother of All Trusts and vowed to substantially lower the charges. After lots
of inner-party wrangling, Congress passed the Payne-Aldrich Bill (1909), which only lowered
tariffs on the items people didn’t want anyway.
Taft had failed to come through for the Progressive wing of his party. He did act to protect
U.S. business interests in Latin America with a few invasions of little countries, but he got in
even more trouble with Progressives for firing environmental hero Gifford Pinchot for criticiz-
ing the sale of public lands to corporate development. Taft did establish the Bureau of Mines
to protect coal land and water supplies, but it was too little too late. The Republicans lost big
in Congress and then, with Roosevelt running on a third-party ticket, lost even bigger in the
presidential election of 1912 to Democrat Woodrow Wilson.
Injured in a perilous exploration in South America, Teddy Roosevelt died in his sleep in 1919.
Said Wilson’s vice president Thomas Marshall, “Death had to take him sleeping, for if Roosevelt
had been awake, there would have been a fight.” Roosevelt enlarged the Presidency and the
nation in three ways: He civilized capitalism so that it could survive in a world where people
as well as profit mattered; he began to make the environment a concern of government; and
he introduced the U.S. to its growing responsibilities on the world stage. He is also associ-
ated with the introduction of the teddy bear, the model of a little bear he refused to shoot on
a hunting trip. Actually, realist Roosevelt didn’t like the idea of a bear being seen as cuddly.
Idealism with Woodrow Wilson
1912 was a campaign to remember. Roosevelt’s name was put in nomination at the Progressive
party convention by Hull House feminist Jane Addams. The convention exploded when
Roosevelt declared, “We stand at Armageddon, and we battle for the Lord.”
During the campaign, Roosevelt was shot in the chest in Milwaukee by John Schrank, a crazy
person. Fortunately, the bullet went through Roosevelt’s steel glasses case, but he was still
wounded and bleeding. Roosevelt refused all help and went on to make an 80-minute speech
after he had been shot. Doctors decided the bullet was too dangerous to remove, and he car-
ried it with him for the rest of his life. He took a couple of weeks off and then was back on the
campaign trail.
On election day, Democrat Woodrow Wilson won easily because Taft and Roosevelt split the
Republican vote (although Teddy got more of the vote). The country’s heart was clearly with
the Progressives. Not counting the very unprogressive South, which voted for Democrats
just because they weren’t Republicans, Progressive votes would have easily won the elec-
tion. Even the perennial Socialist candidate Eugene Debs racked up 900,000 votes. It was time
for some changes.
Wilson sets out to teach America
Woodrow Wilson was only the second Democratic president since the Civil War and the first
teacher ever elected president. He promised a program of New Freedoms, which included
antitrust action, tariff revision, and reform in banking.
208
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

A man of serious purpose, he went after a clear program and got what he fought for on the
domestic front. He was also, ahem, the second great president (after Teddy Roosevelt) to be
a historian. Maybe we could all make history if we weren’t so busy talking about it.
Wilson got real reductions in the cost of imported goods in the Underwood Tariff Bill (1913).
By taking the unprecedented step of going to Congress himself and appealing to the American
people to watch their representatives for last-minute special-interest tricks, Wilson got a bill
that really reduced import fees. Because the passage of the Sixteenth Amendment (1913)
allowed for an income tax, Congress slapped on a modest charge on all incomes over the
equivalent of $65,000 in modern money ($3,000 back then). By 1917, income tax passed tariff
receipts as the largest share of the federal income.
Question: When did taxes on imports stop being the largest share of federal income?
Answer: With the passage of the income tax in 1917.
Shoring up the banking system
Clearly, the banking system needed some help. The Roosevelt panic of 1907 had shown that
the government could ease financial downturns if it had some extra cash to throw into the
game when times got tough. Wilson went directly to Congress and got the Federal Reserve
Act (1913), one of the most important economic landmarks in U.S. history and still the law of
the land.
What the Federal Reserve Act did was establish a national system of 12 privately owned
regional banks under the central authority of the Federal Reserve Board appointed by the
president and Congress. In this best-of-both-worlds establishment, the regional banks can
issue Federal Reserve Notes for private money backed by the government, but only under
direction from the government-controlled Federal Reserve Board.
With the power of private enterprise and the control of central government policy, the gov-
ernment spaced the regional banks around the country to try to minimize the control of Wall
Street New York money. Good luck; New York remained the financial capital no matter how
many solid-looking bank buildings the rest of the country got.
The Trade Commission and Anti-Trust Act
In early 1914, Wilson made his third appearance before Congress. Moving on from the
Roosevelt/Taft program of busting trusts, Wilson encouraged fair competition through the
Federal Trade Commission (1914), which stopped monopolistic trade practices.
With the addition of the Clayton Anti-Trust Act (1914), the practices of price discrimination,
agreements forbidding retailers from handling other companies’ products, and interlocking
directorate agreements to limit competition all became illegal. Even better, individual officers
of corporations could be held responsible if their companies violated the laws.
The new business laws set out clear guidelines that corporations had to follow, much better
than being thumped with no warning under previous, less clear legislation. As a plus for
labor, the law ended the silly business of applying anti-trust laws to unions.
Victories for ordinary people
Wilson made himself even more popular with working people when, in 1916, he approved leg-
islation (the Adamson Act) that increased wages and cut working hours of railroad employ-
ees, thus avoiding a strike.
209
Chapter 16: Into the World, Ready or Not: 1900–1919

Wilson was on a roll; the victories for ordinary people just kept coming.
 The Federal Farm Loan Act (1916) and the Warehouse Act (1916) let farmers get much-
needed loans at low rates.
 The La Follette Seamen’s Act (1915) guaranteed sailors on American merchant ships
decent wages and treatment (and doomed the U.S. merchant fleet, which couldn’t 
compete).
 The Workingmen’s Compensation Act (1916) granted help to disabled federal employees.
Wilson’s shortcoming: Government segregation
Wilson had a moral blind spot when it came to the treatment of blacks. A Southerner who
fondly remembered seeing Robert E. Lee as a child, Wilson delivered for his racist South
Democratic voters by segregating federal offices for the first time since the Civil War and dis-
missing many blacks from government work.
His segregation of government lasted until after World War II, when the Democrats under
Harry Truman decided to do the right thing for civil rights even if it cost them the next elec-
tion (which it did). Since that time, the South has moved into the Republican column in most
elections.
The most important black leader to stand up to Wilson’s segregationist tendencies during
the Progressive Era was the eloquent W.E.B. Du Bois, founder of the NAACP. Du Bois fought
for African American progress for most of his 95-year life. He carried the torch until the day
he died, which just happened to be the day before Martin Luther King’s “I have a dream”
speech.
Question: Who was the most important black leader during the Progressive time period?
Answer: W.E.B. Du Bois, a founder of the NAACP.
Progressing Internationally
Wilson tried to apply morality to international relations, but it’s hard to be idealistic when
other people are shooting at you. He withdrew subsidies for U.S. companies investing abroad
and stopped giving American ships free passage through the Panama Canal. He reluctantly
continued the Roosevelt Corollary by sending Marines in to tame violence in Haiti and the
Dominican Republic. Wilson bought the Virgin Islands in the Caribbean from Denmark, thus
giving Americans another naval ship base and another navel tanning choice.
Wilson did his best to stay out of Mexican politics as factions maneuvered after a revolution.
Standing up to pressure from American businessmen worried about their Mexican invest-
ments, Wilson declared that he wouldn’t decide foreign policy “in the terms of material 
interest.”
After innocent Americans had been killed on both sides of the border by Pancho Villa’s sol-
diers, Wilson sent General “Black Jack” Pershing on a lightning cavalry raid into Mexico.
Pershing chased Pancho’s army and was swiftly pulled back. He may be needed elsewhere;
the situation in Europe was looking grim.
210
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

World War I Begins
Germany and Austria-Hungary were locked in a war with Britain, France and Russia. The
actual fighting started in 1914 after Franz Ferdinand, the prince who was set to become
emperor of Austria-Hungary, was assassinated on a visit to Serbia. However, the endless fight
to be top dog of Europe had been brewing for hundreds of years. This was exactly the kind of
war the United States wanted to avoid.
The natural tendency of English-speaking America to side with England was helped along by
careful propaganda coming over the only news wire from Europe, which conveniently ran
through Britain. Plus, Germans looked like bad guys with their spiked helmets, upturned
mustaches, and habit of tromping through neutral countries.
The millions of Americans with German heritage did little cheering for their old homeland;
one of the reasons they left Germany in the first place was to avoid all that military bluster.
Americans even changed the German names of foods: sauerkraut became victory cabbage,
and more Americans started saying “hot dog” instead of wiener.
Germany paid a penalty for not ruling the waves. America proclaimed her neutral rights to
the seas in hopes of continuing trade with the warring parties who were very much in need
of supplies. Meanwhile, Germany and Britain both blockaded each other. Britain used surface
ships that could gently force American cargo ships away from Germany and into British
ports. Germany used submarines, which could only wave at passing ships or sink them; they
weren’t big enough to shepherd the American ships to distant German ports or even take on
extra passengers if the ships sank. Because this war was the first with submarines, the whole
game seemed like dirty pool to many Americans.
The sinking of the Lusitania
Germany said that it would try not to sink any neutral ships but that mistakes could easily
happen. The first so-called mistake wasn’t a neutral ship but the British liner Lusitania carry-
ing ammunition as well as passengers. The Germans sunk it off Ireland in 1915, killing over a
thousand people, more than a hundred of them Americans.
Germany agreed to stop sinking passenger liners but reasonably asked that Britain respond
by lifting its blockade, which was starving the German people. Britain refused, so safety on
the sea was definitely up in the air as the U.S. got ready to vote for president in 1916. Wilson
barely squeaked through to reelection on a platform that said, “He kept us out of war,” but he
made no guarantees for the future.
America marches to the Great War
At the beginning of 1917, Wilson made one last, moving speech asking the fighting powers 
to come to the peace table. Meanwhile, the Germans made a whopping tactical decision.
Figuring that it would take the U.S. longer to get to France than it would take Germany to win
the war with full submarine warfare, the Germans announced that all bets were off. They
were blockaded, and they intended to blockade Britain by sinking any ships headed that way.
Then stupid got stupider.

Chapter 16: Into the World, Ready or Not: 1900–1919

The Germans sent a note called the Zimmermann telegram to Mexico, inviting them to invade
the United States with the help of Japan. This harebrained scheme would never have worked,
and the Mexicans knew it. Britain, who had been happily reading diplomatic mail from other
countries that passed through their island along the transatlantic cable, intercepted the
telegram and excitedly showed it to the United States. The Germans had already started sink-
ing ships, and the telegram was the last straw for even peace-loving Wilson. The United
States declared war on Germany.
Making war with noble intentions
Forced to resort to cold steel, Wilson turned fighting into an idealistic crusade. He declared
that this was a “war to end all wars” and a “crusade to make the world safe for democracy.”
Wilson outlined the 14 Points (1918) he felt should be the righteous aims of the Allies. In
short form, they included:
 No secret treaties (like the spider webs of undercover alliances that started the war)
 Freedom of the seas
 Free trade
 Fewer weapons
 National self-determination (a people’s right to choose its own form of government with-
out interference)
 An international organization to keep the peace
A propaganda machine led by George Creel talked up America’s peaceful war aims.
Meanwhile, an ugly set of repressive laws, the Espionage Act (1917) and the Sedition Act
(1918), led to the arrest of virtually anyone who spoke up against the war.
Most of the 2,000 prosecutions were against union leaders, including Socialist presidential
candidate Eugene Debs, who had been putting up with persecution for 24 years since the
Pullman Strike of 1894.
Question: What were the main issues in Wilson’s 14 Points?
Answer: Open treaties, freedom of the seas, national self-determination and an interna-
tional peace keeping organization.
Preparing for war
America never got into full production for World War I. The draft supplied lots of soldiers
after the War Department issued a work or fight declaration. Labor was kept under control
by the National War Labor Board chaired by roly-poly former President Taft. Unions made
solid gains in membership, and pay improved with lots of wartime work.
For the first time, blacks (who had for years stayed in the South) began to move North to
take wartime jobs; 500,000 made the move by 1920. This migration led to violence on the part
of whites, especially when blacks helped break white labor actions like the great steel strike
of 1919.
Question: When did blacks start to migrate to the North?
Answer: They made the move during and after World War I.

Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

The role of women in the Great War
President Wilson learned how determined women were to get the vote when police arrested
20 suffragettes who were trying to storm the White House. During the war, he came out in
favor of women’s suffrage as “a vitally necessary war measure.” Most Western states had
given women the vote before 1914 (see Chapter 15). New York, Michigan, Oklahoma, and
South Dakota jumped on board during the war, and after only 130 years of waiting, Abigail
Adams’ pre-Revolution wish finally came true. With the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment
(1920), all American women got the right to vote.
With men gone to fight, some women took temporary so-called men’s jobs in railroads and
factories, but they quickly gave up their positions when the war was over. Still, by the end of
the war, one out of four women had a job outside the home.
Food and drink (and Prohibition) at wartime
Food was no problem for America during the war; farm production increased by 20 percent.
An effective humanitarian engineer named Herbert Hoover had already led a food drive to
help Europe — now he headed the national effort.
People grew victory gardens and patriotically observed meatless Tuesdays and wheatless
Wednesdays. Liberty Loan drives got ordinary citizens to buy government bonds and raised
billions of dollars to finance the war.
Question: What was the Liberty Loan program?
Answer: Liberty Loan was a government bond program in which ordinary citizens helped 
raise money to finance the war.
Congress restricted the manufacture of alcohol, and that set the already half-dry country up
for its national experiment with Prohibition. Lots of brewers were a little suspect anyway,
what with all the German names like Budweiser, Schlitz, and Pabst. Progressives were under
fire from prohibitionists to try a perfect boozeless society.
In 1919, the Eighteenth Amendment prohibited the legal sale of alcoholic beverages in the
United States, thus opening the door for lots of profitable illegal sales. (In 1933, the Twenty
First Amendment repealed Prohibition; see Chapter 17.)
Question: What led to the passage of Prohibition in 1919?
Answer: Years of Prohibition campaigning, war shortages, the belief that human beings 
could be perfected, plus the spreading passage of state anti-liquor laws.
Entering the fight — reluctantly
At first, the U.S. hoped to just send the Navy and let the Europeans do the ground fighting.
The British and French quickly fessed up: They were almost out of men. The United States
drafted a minimally trained army of 4 million men and began to ship them to Europe.
A year passed between the time America declared war and the time an effective U.S. fighting
force assembled in Europe, and it was none too soon. Russia, which had been fighting on the
Allied side, was swept by a Communist revolution and dropped out of the war.
213
Chapter 16: Into the World, Ready or Not: 1900–1919

Experienced German troops shifted to fight in France. By May of 1918, the Germans were
within 40 miles of Paris. The first large American contingent was thrown right into a breach
in the French line. By July, the German advance ground to a halt. By the fall, over a million
American troops were helping to slowly push the Germans back.
Heroes came from the strangest places: Sergeant York, an American soldier raised in an anti-
war church, singlehandedly killed 20 Germans and captured 132 more.
The Great War ends — sort of
In October, the Germans asked for peace based on Wilson’s 14 Points. At 11:00 a.m. on the
11th day of the 11th month (November 11, 1918), the Great War was over.
The Allied forces won because Germany knew what was going to happen if it continued fight-
ing; Socialist revolutions were going on back in Germany, and lots of German (and Allied)
troops were dying from a worldwide flu epidemic. Germany had given up before it was com-
pletely defeated, something that would come to bother a hard-fighting, wounded German
army corporal named Adolf Hitler.
The United States was far from the arsenal of democracy it would become in World War II;
Britain and France actually supplied most of the planes, big guns, and transport ships used
by American troops.
Leaders of the world hurried to Paris in January of 1919 to conclude a peace treaty while 
revolutions were tearing apart Russia and central Europe. Woodrow Wilson was the hero of
the day. People expected freedom and peace from the 14 Points. Unfortunately, most of the
points’ good ideas didn’t end up in the Treaty of Versailles, a compromise Wilson had to
make with broke, tired, and angry European victors.
Wilson tried to move the world toward fairness, and he did succeed on getting a few new
nations established and some more reasonable boundaries drawn. In the end, Wilson got a
treaty with too much reparation money due to be paid by a too-poor Germany. He took what
he could get to preserve his pet project, the League of Nations.
The peace that can’t hold
Back in America, powerful conservative forces had taken over Congress. They refused to
ratify the Treaty of Versailles as written, and Wilson refused to accept anything less. The mis-
understood final warning from George Washington to “avoid foreign entanglements” hovered
over the hall like an outdated ghost.
George had been speaking to a small, weak nation of farmers in a world where crossing the
ocean took weeks and America didn’t have to trade with anybody. Now the U.S. was the one
nation with the strength and moral position to make the League of Nations work, but it
wouldn’t take the responsibility. Wilson’s moral position worked against him — some 
senators had just had it with the do-gooder.
Wilson works to hold everything together
Wilson went on a speaking tour to try to get people to put pressure on the Congress to
accept the treaty. In Pueblo, Colorado, with tears streaming down his cheeks, he pleaded for
the League of Nations as the only way to avoid another war. That night he collapsed. Hit by 
214
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

a stroke, Wilson didn’t make public appearances for months afterwards. The political strat-
egy he followed from his sick bed was feverish.
Wilson’s Democratic Party had lost control of Congress in the 1918 elections. Senator Henry
Cabot Lodge, the great Republican enemy of the League of Nations, attached some reserva-
tions to the treaty that Wilson didn’t like. Wilson ordered all the Democratic senators to vote
against the treaty rather than compromise. Having been so successful in the past, Wilson
seemed to think he could turn the upcoming presidential election of 1920 into a referendum
on the treaty.
Question: How did President Wilson try to convince Congress to vote for the Treaty of 
Versailles?
Answer: He appealed directly to the people to put pressure on Congress.
The League of Nations falls
The Republicans nominated affable and empty-headed Warren Harding for president. He
trounced the Democrats who supported the League of Nations by saying he would work for a
vague Association of Nations and playing to the postwar atmosphere of relief. The Republicans
got almost twice as many votes as the too-serious Democrats.
The failure of the United States to join the League of Nations led to World War II. The United
States didn’t create Hitler, Mussolini, or the poverty, greed, and hatred that sparked World
War II and caused the deaths of 72 million people, including 418,000 Americans. But because
of outmoded isolationism and an almost-adolescent snit between people who were too right-
eous to work together, the United States did nothing to stop it. As the saying goes, if you’re
not part of the solution, maybe you’re part of the problem.

In This Chapter

 Weathering the Depression
 Meeting Franklin Roosevelt with new hope
P
resident Warren G. Harding wasn’t a bad man, but he was suspiciously lazy in his
choice of political friends. When Republican Warren Harding took over as president in
1921, the nation was ready for happy days after all the preachiness of Woodrow Wilson.
Harding’s Cabinet members weren’t about to preach; in fact, they included a den of thieves.
His Secretary of the Interior leased America’s emergency Teapot Dome oil reserve to private
businessmen in exchange for a $400,000 bribe ($4 million in modern money). His head of
Veteran’s Affairs ripped off the modern equivalent of $2 billion by allowing shady work on
veterans’ hospitals. His Attorney General — the guy who was supposed to, you know, enforce
the laws — was charged with the sale of pardons and liquor permits. Harding didn’t have 
to face the ugly scene his friends had created: He died of an illness in the middle of his
administration.
That’s the way it went in the Roaring ’20s: high times with a big bill coming later. Kicking off
the 1900s, activist presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow
Wilson had tackled serious problems with the belief that progressive reform would help
America live up to its high ideals (see Chapter 16). After all that progressing and the trauma
of World War I, people were tired of idealism — they just wanted to return to normal. Trouble
is, you can never get in the same river twice — the current moves on without you. Normal in
the 1920s was a whole new world. Unfortunately for the people of that era, the Great
Depression was right around the corner. More on that in this chapter.
U.S. versus Communism: The Early Years
With the Communist revolution running wild throughout Russia, the United States had the
terrorist jitters. President Wilson expanded the federal police with a new bureau headed by 
J. Edgar Hoover. Before the Red Scare (1920) was over, more than 10,000 people were arrested
(some beaten up or held illegally).

Real terrorists did actually strike: A bomb in Washington D.C. just missed a young Franklin
Delano Roosevelt, and another killed 38 people and wounded hundreds on Wall Street. The
actual bombers escaped, and almost all of the people arrested were guilty of nothing more
than being radical union members or recent immigrants. Immigrants suspected of trouble-
making were deported.
Scared for their lives and property, most Americans supported the anti-Communist raids at
first. But when the police issued a red alert for a Communist takeover on May 1that never
materialized, public support for police-state tactics started to fade. Factory owners kept the
Communist issue going as long as possible by trying to link unions with Communists.
During the hysteria, five legally elected members of the New York legislature and one U.S.
Congressman weren’t allowed to take their seats because of their left-wing views. Two immi-
grant Italians, Sacco and Vanzetti (1921) were executed for murder on evidence that had more
to do with their radical views and the fact that they were immigrants than proof of their
alleged crime.
Question: What happened to immigrants suspected of being trouble makers during the
Red Scare (1920)?
Answer: They were deported.
The Return of the Klan
The same Ku Klux Klan (KKK) that had terrorized blacks and their Reconstruction allies in
the post-Civil-War South came back from the dead like a racist Dracula during the 1920s. This
time, the Klan had more than blacks to hate: It was also against booze, international coopera-
tion, evolution, gambling, immigrants, and sex.
218
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 
The Birth of a Nation
The Birth of a Nation follows the family of Northern abo-
litionist Congressman Stoneman (based on real life
Congressman Stevens, an abolitionist leader). His
Northern family visits their Southern friends the
Camerons, who live on the quintessential South Carolina
plantation, complete with happy slaves.
When the Civil War breaks out, the children of the two
families support their respective sides, but young
Northern soldier Phil Stoneman can’t forget his love for
Southerner Margaret Cameron. The only other surviving
son is Ben Cameron. Wounded while fighting bravely for
the Confederates, Ben is recovering in a Northern hos-
pital when a lovely young nurse comes by who is, oh my
gosh, his childhood love Elsie Stoneman.
After the war, Ben creates the Ku Klux Klan when he
sees white children dressing up like ghosts to scare
black children. He does it just in time, too, because black
ex-slaves are menacing white women, including Ben’s
sister Flora, who jumps off a cliff to escape. When Elsie
is also threatened, Ben and the Klan arrive in the nick of
time to save her. Phil Stoneman and his Union army
friends realize they must work together with the Klan to
save what the movie calls their “Aryan birthright.”
A title slide has an authentic quote from Woodrow
Wilson about “the great Ku Klux Klan.” The movie ends
with a double Cameron/Stoneman wedding as the world
lives happily together under a picture of Christ.
Because it used lies to sell tickets and inflame hatred,
The Birth of a Nation was boycotted in many cities and
states.

Change always brings out reaction, and the 1920s version of the Klan had millions of aggres-
sive and frightening hood-wearing members including senators, mayors, and, according to
some sources, President Warren G. Harding. Although the original Klan died out some 20
years after the Civil War ended, the new Klan sprung out of the popularity of one of the first
story movies: The Birth of a Nation (1915). Showing the power of popular culture, the movie
made up different Klan traditions than those started by the original KKK. The new Klan
organization followed the film, not the original group — basically, they learned it at the
movies.
The reconstituted Klan fizzled out in the late 1920s when the corruption of their leaders and
the shamefulness of their tactics became obvious even to people with sheets over their
heads. Although the new Klan made lots of temporary converts among people frightened by
change, the KKK also faced something it never had in the old South: stand-up opposition
from progressive people who wouldn’t let hate win.
Immigration Act of 1924
In the 1920s, new laws to slow immigration relieved the nativist fear of being overwhelmed
by immigrants. (See Chapter 16 for more on nativism.) The Immigration Act of 1924 capped
the number of immigrants allowed in the U.S. each year at 2 percent of the number of a home
nation’s citizens already in the United States as of 1890. For example, if 3 million Americans
of German descent lived in the U.S. in 1890, 60,000 Germans (2 percent of 3 million) could
come to the country each year under the 1924 act. This quota barred the door to many hope-
ful immigrants from countries that didn’t have a lot of people in the U.S. in 1890.
One such country was Italy. Lots of Italian people wanted to come to America, but the whole
country was only able to send fewer than 6,000 people a year. This number still made the
Italians better off than the Japanese, who were completely locked out by the act. The various
groups that actually got into the U.S. tried to maintain their national cultures, but their chil-
dren learned to speak English and made friends with kids from all over. Radio and movies
accelerated the melting pot by teaching standardized language and culture. The number of
immigrant children who were forced into child labor declined as individual states began to
require school attendance and forbid underage employment.
Question: Why did fewer immigrants come to the United States in the 1920s?
Answer: The Immigration Act of 1924 limited new Americans to a low quota of 2 percent
of the number of citizens by national origin in the United States by 1890.
Question: What reduced child labor in the 1920s?
Answer: States passed laws that required children to attend school and prohibited
underage labor.
Bathtub Gin and a Little Sin: The Jazz Age
During the 1920s, radios, record players, magazines, and movies began to bring the world to
average working people who could never have afforded to go to plays, concerts, or college.
Telephones, electricity, and indoor plumbing all made life more comfortable. More people
had cars than bathtubs. (After all, you can’t drive a bathtub to town.) Young people left the
219
Chapter 17: Roaring, Soaring, and Fighting Depression: 1921–1939

farm; for the first time in history, more people lived in cities than in the country. The 1920s
were called the Jazz Age because popular music shared influences from big band, ragtime
and rhythm, songs you could get up and dance to.
Prohibition: High demand and high crime
Prohibition, implemented by the Volstead Act after the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment
(1919), may have cut down on drinking by 10 percent, but it increased crime by 50 percent.
Because booze was illegal but in demand, liquor made great profits for organized crime. For
every large saloon that closed, at least three small speakeasies (illicit pubs) opened.
Because low-alcohol beer and wine were bulky and hard to transport, potent hard liquor
cocktails became the quick-acting drink of choice. Lots of hard liquor was smuggled, but des-
perate drinkers learned to make gin in their bathtubs or bought special grape juice that
turned to wine with minimal effort.
Arrests for drunken driving and public intoxication went up more than 50 percent. The law
made millions of otherwise-law-abiding Americans into criminals, and it gave real criminals
so much money that they fought ugly wars over territory in big cities.
The king of the mobs in Chicago was Al Capone. After more than 500 deaths in the Windy
City, Capone was finally sent to prison for tax evasion. At their height, illegal liquor mobs
took in more money than the federal government. The Twenty-First Amendment (1933) finally
repealed Prohibition.
Sex in the city
A lot of people had fun in the Roaring ’20s (1925). People did crazy dances to the new music
of the Jazz Age. Anything seemed possible with the new-found freedom provided by women’s
suffrage, cars, radio, movies, and — Prohibition be damned — plenty of booze. The scene
also included well-known gay clubs, but they disappeared at the end of the 1920s and didn’t
reappear until the 1970s.
Because Sigmund Freud had explained sex drives as a natural part of being human, the sub-
ject of sex was less taboo. Margaret Sanger (1921) risked arrest to get birth control informa-
tion to women.
Question: Who was Margaret Sanger?
Answer: Margaret Sanger was an early advocate who publicized information about birth
control.
Mass production and mass consumption
Prosperity was the lion behind the ’20s’ roar. Mass production made new inventions and
former luxuries available to almost everybody, especially with the financially dangerous new
invention of time payments. Henry Ford lowered the price of his Model T to a few hundred
dollars, cheap enough for most working people who could get a loan to buy their car on time.
By the end of the decade, the U.S. had one car for every five Americans, far more than all the
automobiles in the rest of the world.
220
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Advertising got good at making people want things they didn’t even need through the mass
media of radio, billboards, and popular magazines. Frederick Taylor (1922), the father of sci-
entific management, broke work assignments down into tasks and figured out the most effi-
cient way to get jobs done. Unions lost membership as employers used government support
and fear of radicals to break up strikes.
Question: What happened to the Progressive political movement in the 1920s?
Answer: Progressive reforms all but disappeared as conservative Republican govern-
ment slowed immigration, relaxed the regulations on business, and weakened unions.
Cars and planes
Motor vehicles were good for more than just joy rides. Trucks moved goods to market more
cheaply and quickly than trains; produce farmers made more money and city people got
better fruit and vegetables. People didn’t have to live right next to where they worked any-
more; the first suburbs appeared. Buses allowed schools to consolidate and reach more 
students.
Women took to driving right from the start; it gave them freedom from dependence on men.
Cars were so handy that people didn’t even begin to notice the cost in dollars, accidents, and
pollution until years later.
Automobiles were fast, but planes were faster. The Wright brothers flew the first plane in
1903. After that, it took 20 years and countless crashes for aviation to become practical. The
first transcontinental airmail route began from San Francisco to New York in 1920. Few pas-
sengers flew in the 1920s; most airliners concentrated on carrying the mail.
After Charles Lindbergh became a hero by single-handedly flying his Spirit of St. Louis (1927)
from New York to Paris, aviation was on everybody’s mind. The first flight attendant stepped
on board a regularly scheduled commercial flight in 1930.
Radio
The first radio breakthrough occurred when original station KDKA in Pittsburgh broadcasted
the news of Warren Harding’s election in 1920. As more and more families gathered around
the early radios, commercials for products soon began popping up.
Radio broke down local accents by providing a national standard of speech. It also affected
politics by carrying the words of candidates and the sound of their speaking voices, some-
thing only a small proportion of the population had ever heard before the 1920s. This devel-
opment hurt squeaky-voiced politicians like Al Smith and helped great radio personalities
like Franklin Roosevelt.
The Harlem Renaissance
The Harlem Renaissance (1926) expanded the urban culture of black Americans with writers
like Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, plus musicians like Louis Armstrong and Duke
Ellington.
221
Chapter 17: Roaring, Soaring, and Fighting Depression: 1921–1939

Marcus Garvey (1921) tried to raise money for black-owned businesses and an African
American colony in Liberia. He galvanized black pride but was set up by the first black
employees of the FBI and deported. For the first time, blacks and whites mingled in the
nightspots. The Harlem Renaissance basketball team was the best in the world.
Question: Who was Marcus Garvey?
Answer: Garvey was an organizer who raised African American pride with plans for
black owned businesses and an African colony.
Movies and their influence
Movies changed history during this period, whether it was through an overt message like
The Birth of a Nation or the shared experience of just going to the movies together.
As one of the first feature films, The Great Train Robbery (1903) excited the audience so much
that some of them ducked when the train went by. The earliest movies were silent and
included explanation signs; the cowboys would be galloping silently away and suddenly
everything would stop for what looked like a PowerPoint slide. That kept people reading, but
it didn’t survive the 1920s.
In 1927, The Jazz Singer contained the first synchronized dialogue (and singing) in a feature
film. After sound was possible, nobody wanted to read written explanations in films again
(except for maybe the beginning of Star Wars), and from then on movies could talk. About the
same time, color movies began to appear. Films largely replaced ethnic theater and united
the country in shared dramatic experiences. Movies helped ethnicities become regular
Americans.
Flappers
The most beautiful woman in films was The It-girl, Clara Bow, whose brassy personality was a
model for the flappers (1925), newly liberated women who made up their own rules about
clothes (including short dresses and hair) and behavior. Females could afford to be more
independent because the number of women with jobs increased by 25 percent in the 1920s.
People called them wild, but flappers didn’t care what people thought.
Question: Who were the flappers in the 1920s?
Answer: The flappers were women who felt liberated to make up their own minds about
appearance and behavior. Their style was short hair, short dresses, independence, and
wild dancing.
222

William Haines
The most famous movie actor of 1925 was William
Haines, who lived openly with his gay lover. Pushed to
cover up by the studios, they switched to interior deco-
ration and lived together the rest of their lives, more than
50 years — in the words of Joan Crawford, “the happi-
est married couple in Hollywood.” They decorated the
houses of the stars, including Ronald Reagan’s
Governor’s Mansion.

Monkeying around with evolution
The idea of evolution scared a lot of conservative religious people who thought that it didn’t
fit with their idea of God. The state of Tennessee banned the teaching of evolution, but a
young high-school football coach named John Scopes taught it anyway and landed in court
in the Scopes Monkey Trial (1925).
The trial starred famous defense attorney Clarence Darrow as Scopes’ lawyer and former
presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan as the prosecutor. Bryan took the stand to
explain why the Bible was right, and Darrow made him look foolish.
Laws against teaching evolution stayed around until the 1960s, when the Supreme Court
ruled that such bans violate the First Amendment because their primary purpose is religious.
Fundamentalists still try to get what they call intelligent design recognized in schools, but
now they’re trying to get into the classroom instead of keeping science out.
Even though the Scopes Trial didn’t immediately repeal the law, it began to change the way
most people thought, which eventually changed the law.
Question: Who were the key attorneys in the Scopes Trial?
Answer: William Jennings Bryan and Clarence Darrow.
The power of the pen
The sharpest pen of the 1920s belonged to H.L. Mencken, who was the Jon Stewart of his gen-
eration. As a Baltimore newspaperman and editor of the American Mercury magazine,
Mencken took on the backward establishment of America. He defined a puritan as someone
with “the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, might be happy.”
Other writers stirred the dark coals of the happily roaring ’20s:
 F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby (1925) about the hopeless social climbing of
an also-ran who could never reach success because glamor isn’t life.
 Theodore Dreiser went even sadder in An American Tragedy (1925), a novel about the
murder of a pregnant girl by her social-climbing boyfriend.
 The poet e.e. cummings wrote verse so direct that it didn’t need capitalization.
 Ernest Hemingway stripped away all the Victorian prose and wrote in simple English.
His A Farewell to Arms (1929), a novel paralleling his own experience in World War I,
combined toughness with feeling.
 Sherwood Anderson’s Winesburg, Ohio (1919) contained the touchingly pathetic stories
of small-town Americans lost in their own private suffering.
 Sinclair Lewis wrote Main Street (1920) and Babbitt (1922) about the limits of sophisti-
cation in early 1900s America. The character Babbitt became a synonym for the short-
sighted, self-serving boosterism encountered in any club or city.
 William Faulkner described the South, prejudices and all, in The Sound and the Fury
(1929).
On the whole, the writers of the 1920s were surprisingly gloomy for a roaring decade. Maybe
they saw trouble coming, or perhaps they just valued honesty more than uplift. So did the
223
Chapter 17: Roaring, Soaring, and Fighting Depression: 1921–1939

many Americans who chose to read their books. In that sense, the writers of the ’20s were
the worthy successors to the early-1900s muckrakers. Unlike the early muckrakers, however,
these writers were living in a political world that, for the time being, valued wealth more than
progress.
Question: What was the spirit of critically acclaimed writers of the 1920s?
Answer: Writers generally reflected a gloomy questioning of society.
Architecture
Frank Lloyd Wright (1928) was something of an architectural poet. If architecture is frozen
music, he made that music new, stripping off tired classical references to build for a new
world. 
The soaring Chrysler Building and Empire State Building in New York were further proof of
late-1920s architectural exuberance. The International style began to emphasize glass and
light as modern building techniques allowed more openness. 
Major Money Shift: Signs of Trouble Ahead
Even as the 1920s roared, signs that America’s fast growth was running on empty began to
appear.
 U.S. manufacturing output rose by 50 percent, but even in good times, hundreds of
banks failed every year.
 Buying on credit was rare at the beginning of the decade, but by the end of the 1920s,
more than half of the purchases for cars and appliances were on time payments.
 A Florida land boom so hot that people even bought lots that were under water turned
to bust in one 1925 hurricane.
The stock market went up for so long that everybody forgot it could go down. Ordinary
working people bet their life savings on stocks, buying them on margin — a kind of time pay-
ment, just like the financing scheme they used for their cars.
The Republican-controlled Congress cut the taxes on rich people: What was three dollars in
tax for the rich in 1920 became only one dollar. Wealth-friendly politicians said this money
would trickle down to the poorer people.
Question: What was the Republican position on taxes for the rich?
Answer: Republicans cut taxes on the rich, claiming benefits would trickle down to
poorer people.
A little trickling down would have been good, because 40 percent of the whole nation (and a
much higher percentage of farmers and blacks) lived below the poverty line. While the poor
people lived without government help, cheap taxes for the rich made the economy blow up
like a big balloon.
Question: Which groups had it hardest during the 1920s?
Answer: The most-economically-depressed groups were farmers and blacks. They didn’t
share much in the 1920s boom times.

Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Politics Lead to Depression
The three Republican presidents in the 1920s really thought people should take care of them-
selves. Even after the stock market crashed in 1929, Herbert Hoover quoted the cold-hearted
words of President Cleveland from 50 years before: “. . . though the people support the
Government, the Government should not support the people.”
The same hands-off governmental philosophy guided the Republican presidential trio in
international affairs; the U.S. was isolationist and unprepared for war. Antitrust laws passed
by Progressive presidents went unenforced, and businesses soon learned that they could get
away with forming trade associations that limited competition:
 The Esch-Cummins Transportation Act (1920) allowed the private combination of the
railroads and committed the Interstate Commerce Commission to help them make 
a profit.
 The Merchant Marine Act (1920) sold off ships built by the government at bargain prices
to big businessmen. A railroad strike protesting a 12 percent pay cut during boom
times was put down with harsh measures by the government in 1922.
International efforts were mostly symbolic:
 The U.S. called the leading powers together to sign the Washington Naval Treaty (1922)
where they agreed to limit warship construction at a nice high level.
 Harding helped American companies grab oil concessions (1923) in the Middle East that
would eventually become habit-forming.
 The Nine-Power Treaty (1922) made an Open Door policy to China look official, but it
didn’t keep Japan and Russia from trying to sneak in that door to grab some territory
for themselves.
 The Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928) proved how easy it is to say good words by 
“outlawing war.”
All these agreements sounded good, but with only a weak League of Nations, they didn’t have
any power to enforce them.
Republicans hiked the tariffs, like they always did, under the Fordney-McCumber Tariff Law
(1922), which also gave the president the power to raise or lower tariffs by himself. No sur-
prise, the Republican presidents sent the tariffs even higher on 32 important commodities
like dairy products and iron. They lowered taxes on only five items nobody wanted anyway,
including paintbrush handles and bobwhite quail.
Calvin Coolidge: “Silent Cal” stands by
After President Harding escaped facing his administration’s corruption through the clever
tactic of dying, Calvin Coolidge took over and cooled the situation down. Coolidge special-
ized in keeping his remarks simple. A famous story tells of a dinner guest who said, “Mr.
Coolidge, I’ve made a bet against a fellow who said it was impossible to get more than two
words out of you.” Coolidge’s reply: “You lose.”
Although Coolidge had little to say, he supported business like it was a religion. In fact, he
believed that “the man who builds a factory builds a temple” and “the man who works there
worships there.” He’d obviously never worked in a factory. 
225
Chapter 17: Roaring, Soaring, and Fighting Depression: 1921–1939

Although Coolidge came from a New England farm family, he stood by and did nothing as one
out of four families lost their farms to debt in the 1920s. He just said that farming had never
paid much and that the government couldn’t do anything about it. Coolidge got elected once
in his own right and then ran out of energy to try it again.
Herbert Hoover: Good intentions, bad mistakes
Herbert Hoover had a great reputation as a humanitarian and a problem-solver for three ear-
lier administrations. Then he actually became president and blew it all away in the Great
Depression. Elected in a landslide in 1928, he started by actually trying to do something for
the desperate farmers.
The Agricultural Marketing Act (1929) lent money to farmers’ organizations to manage their
crops for maximum profit. It didn’t work very well; prices for grain and cotton just kept drop-
ping because farmers kept growing an oversupply of crops.
The Stock Market Crash of 1929
On Black Tuesday (1929) in October 1929, the stock market crashed. Stocks kept sliding 
until they reached a point in 1932 when they were down 89 percent, lower than they’d been
since the 1800s. Prudent investors who bought slowly over their lifetime would have been
protected from the worst market fluctuations by the law of averages. However, anyone who
bought stocks only at the highest and therefore worst time in mid-1929 and held on to them
saw most of his adult life pass by before finally breaking even in 1954. 
Responding to business pressure, Hoover did exactly the wrong thing by signing the terrible
Smoot-Hawley Tariff (1930). A world economy teetering on the brink of economic collapse
certainly didn’t need the highest peacetime tariff in U.S. history; the rest of the world viewed
the tariff as a kind of giant “screw you,” and economic walls went up all over the world.
Tariffs certainly didn’t help the United States get over the crisis that started with the Wall
Street meltdown in 1929. Unemployment was at 9 percent in 1930 when the Smoot-Hawley
tariff passed, but it jumped to 16 percent the next year and 25 percent two years after that.
Bad news hits hard
As people’s jobs evaporated and families started to go hungry, Hoover’s response was to
assist businesses so that their wealth would trickle down to the poor.
After the Depression had gone on for three years, Congress finally passed the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation (RFC) Act (1932). The RFC lent money to businesses, agricultural organi-
zations, and local governments. Many called it the millionaires’ dole.
Actually, Hoover had come a long way from the take-care-of-yourself position of earlier 1920s
Republicans, including himself. Realizing that they would have to do something for worried
laborers whose union membership had gone down by a third in the union-busting 1920s,
Congress passed the Norris-La Guardia Anti-Injunction Act (1932), which forbade court inter-
ference in peaceful strikes and stopped management from forcing workers to sign anti-union
pledges.
226
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Question: What national program did Herbert Hoover establish to help fight the
Depression?
Answer: Hoover established the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) at the end 
of his term in 1932 to loan money to businesses, organizations, and state and local 
governments.
A march on Washington by 20,000 hungry veterans called the Bonus Expeditionary Force
(1932) asked for the bonus ($15,000 in modern money) promised them in the Adjusted
Compensaton Act (1924) when they really needed it, which was right now. General Douglas
MacArthur broke up the march with force, but that didn’t make Hoover any more popular.
Meanwhile, Japan used the economic troubles of the U.S. as a good time to brutally attack
China. The United States did nothing but shake its finger.
While his own country was slipping down the economic drain, Hoover did manage to make
some conciliatory gestures in Latin America that later formed the basis of the Good Neighbor
Policy (1933) under Franklin Roosevelt. At home under Hoover, the situation just kept getting
worse.
Question: What did the government do when the Bonus Expeditionary Force marched
on Washington during the Great Depression?
Answer: The government used the army to break up the march and sent the marchers
home.
Hoover is left holding the bag
1932 wasn’t a good time to be Herbert Hoover running for re-election. One in four 
Americans — more than 11 million people — had no job. The people didn’t want to hear any
more Republican philosophy about how it was good for the poor to have to struggle on their
own. As people pointed out, Hoover’s RFC could pay to feed a pig but not a human child.
Shantytowns of displaced people called Hoovervilles sprung up near big cities. The
Depression was cause for a great internal migration of transient people traveling from town
to town looking for work; 2,000 applicants would show up for a single job interview.
Question: What was the impact of the Depression on where people lived?
Answer: Transient people travelled from town to town in a great internal migration
around the United States looking for work.
Franklin D. Roosevelt: Helping 
the Country to a New Deal
Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) was the Democratic candidate for president. Roosevelt was
a distant cousin of Teddy Roosevelt, and his wife was Teddy’s niece Eleanor. FDR had been
the Democratic nominee for vice president in 1920 — tall, athletic and maybe just a little
stuck up. Beaten for vice president in the Harding landslide, in 1921 he was struck by a dis-
ease that paralyzed his legs for life. He didn’t give up, but he did begin to see what a struggle
life could be for what he called the forgotten man.
227
Chapter 17: Roaring, Soaring, and Fighting Depression: 1921–1939

FDR was governor of New York when the Depression hit, and he immediately launched relief
programs that reached worried people. His campaign song is still a theme for the Democratic
party: “Happy Days Are Here Again.” People believed in his hope and determination, and
Roosevelt beat Hoover in a landslide.
His inaugural address contained now-famous words, quoted here in a slightly extended ver-
sion to show their serious context: “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself —nameless,
unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into
advance.”
Roosevelt’s New Deal (1933) program centered on three R’s: relief, recovery, and reform:
 First, FDR wanted to provide immediate relief from hunger and homelessness, very real
problems in 1933, when one out of four Americans were unemployed.
 Second, the New Deal hoped to help the economy recover so that people would have
stable jobs and businesses with which to support themselves.
 Third, the Democrats planned to reform the system so that no American would have to
suffer another Great Depression again.
A newly elected, heavily Democratic Congress passed a slew of legislation so quickly that it
became known as the Hundred Days (1933) of the new administration. Roosevelt wanted to
fix agriculture, banks, and jobs without nationalizing basic industries.
Question: What were Roosevelt’s key aims with the New Deal?
Answer: FDR wanted to save the country and the capitalist system by reforming banks,
agriculture, and jobs without nationalizing major industries.
Healing with an alphabet soup of agencies
The first step was to stop the run on the banks that had people desperately trying to with-
draw their savings, thus making bank collapse a self-fulfilling prophecy. Roosevelt temporar-
ily closed all the banks, then reopened them under the Emergency Banking Act, which took
all of eight hours to pass.
Congress created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (1933), guaranteeing bank
deposits and thus helping stop the panic. To create more money, FDR purposely caused infla-
tion by increasing the price of gold.
For direct help to starving people, Congress passed the Federal Emergency Relief Administration
(1933), which handed out billions of dollars in grants and jobs through the states. More help
was on the way.
Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)
The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) (1933) created more than 3 million jobs in the nine
years of its life, hiring mostly young men from poor families. Civilian Conservation Corps
camps were run by the Army in every state in the nation.
The CCC constructed buildings and trails in city, state, and national parks that still exist
today. The first CCC recruit was ready for training little more than a month after Roosevelt
took office; the program continued until World War II gave young men something else to do.
228
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Most Americans happily endorsed the CCC as a combination of good work and necessary
economic support — most of a CCC recruit’s small-but-regular pay went home to help his
family. Although the national CCC ended, over a hundred state and local work programs still
exist today modeled on the Conservation Corps.
WPA, CWA, and PWA
More jobs were created by the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the Civil Works
Administration (CWA) and the Public Works Administration (PWA). A regular alphabet soup of
well-meaning agencies tried to help America keep working through the nightmare of the
Depression.
Trails and roads weren’t the only major projects; the PWA built the Grand Coulee Dam on the
Columbia River, the largest structure in the world that had been built up to that time since
the Great Wall of China. To keep people cheerful and raise a little tax revenue, the nation got
rid of Prohibition with the Twenty-first Amendment (1933).
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)
The federal government got into the electricity business with the construction of the nine
dams of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) (1933). Even by Depression standards, the
Tennessee Valley area was in bad shape, with exhausted soil, epidemic malaria, and wide-
spread poverty. The TVA brought jobs and low-cost power with what was to become one of
the largest electrical utilities in the world. At the same time, state public utility commissions
began to control abuses by private power companies.
Help for agriculture
The Agricultural Adjustment Act (1933) helped improve farm income by limiting supply, but
the Supreme Court overturned it. The Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (1936)
and a reformed second Agricultural Adjustment Act (1938) passed Court tests to become the
beginning of the national farm support program that continues to this day.
Question: What was the Agricultural Adjustment Act (1933)?
Answer: This act was the first attempt at a national farm policy that included limiting
supply to raise farm income.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
Because Wall Street represented as a bad guy in the Great Depression, the Roosevelt govern-
ment started the first fair trading rules for stocks with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) (1934). The SEC is still around and gets regularly strengthened when cor-
porations devise new ways to fool investors.
Federal Housing Administration (FHA)
To increase the number of construction jobs and homes, the Federal Housing Administration
(FHA) (1934) began to back small loans for remodeling and new home construction.
When the FHA started, most home mortgages were short-term, three-to-five-year interest-
only loans, with a huge balloon payment for the entire value of the loan at the end of three or
five years. Buyers had to come up with at least 40 percent of the value of the home as a down
payment. With the Depression, people couldn’t make big balloon payments or find 40 percent
for a down payment. Banks were stuck with houses nobody could afford to buy, and the
housing market tanked. With the FHA, home ownership has increased from 40 percent in the
1930s to nearly 70 percent today.
229
Chapter 17: Roaring, Soaring, and Fighting Depression: 1921–1939

Social Security
Certainly the largest, lasting change in life for older people was the creation of the Social
Security Administration (1935), which guaranteed small pensions for the elderly and the 
handicapped by taxing the income of current workers. In the presidential election of 1936,
Roosevelt tromped his Republican opponent. The Democrats controlled two thirds of the
votes in both the House and the Senate. No political party had enjoyed this much public sup-
port since the Era of Good Feelings (see Chapter 10) more than 100 years before.
Question: How was the Social Security Administration funded?
Answer: Social Security taxed current workers to pay for retirement benefits.
One not-so-perfect new deal
The New Deal made mistakes. To create more jobs, the government created the National
Recovery Administration (NRA), in which participating industries agreed to job sharing and
wage and price controls to make more work. It was an administrative nightmare and was
soon declared unconstitutional.
Roosevelt went too far when he tried to add more justices to the Supreme Court to keep it
from blocking his legislation. Even his supporters couldn’t go along with this manipulation of
the Constitution.
Wrapping up the New Deal agencies
The Indian New Deal, officially named the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, encouraged
tribes to organize their own governments and stopped the breakup of American Indian lands.
A change in government treatment of unions was signaled by the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) (1935), which allowed workers a fair hearing when organizing unions. Even
with a more sympathetic government, strikers were killed in San Francisco (1934) and
Chicago (1937). The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) (1937) later formed to organize
whole industries, including unskilled workers and blacks who hadn’t been part of the older
AFL confederation (see Chapter 15). By 1938, the CIO had 4 million members.
To keep enthusiastic government employees from campaigning for their boss, the Hatch Act
(1939) barred political work by government employees.
Question: What did the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) add to the labor-
organizing movement?
Answer: The CIO offered representation to unskilled workers and blacks across whole
industries, going beyond the AFL’s push for skilled workers by trade.
The legacy of the New Deal
Fighting the Depression before World War II closed in, Roosevelt managed to cut unemploy-
ment from 25 percent to 12 percent. He literally kept people all over the country from starv-
ing. The New Deal also started programs that prevented something as horrible as the Great
Depression from happening again. Millions of people got a chance to improve their lives, and
the spirit of the New Deal put a safety net under the American people that no President — no
matter how conservative — has ever seriously tried to take away.
You don’t really have to memorize all the New Deal alphabet letters, but be ready for ques-
tions on the Depression. For essay answers, an understanding of the scope of Roosevelt’s
recovery program and some specific agencies is important. At minimum, you want to know
the agencies started in the New Deal that are still part of America: FDIC, TVA, SEC, FHA,
NLRB, and Social Security. If you can figure out what the letters mean, the agencies pretty
well explain themselves.
230
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Toughing It Out in the Dust Bowl
The New Deal tried to give long-suffering farmers a break by paying them not to grow crops,
thus limiting supply, conserving land, and raising prices of now more moderately produced
food. When things were already bad out on the land, overplowed dry land blew away in the
Dust Bowl (1935) centered in Kansas and Oklahoma. This led to an exodus of poor farmers
headed west to look for work and food.
Depression-era Demagoguery
Whenever there is a shortage of money, there is a surplus of people with good sounding
schemes about how to change things. The 1930s had its share of demagogues ready to fool
the people with big talk:
 Huey P. “Kingfish” Long (1934) promised fat money bonuses for everyone in his native
Louisiana in order to get almost-dictatorial power as governor and senator.
 Father Charles Coughlin (1935) was a thorn in the side of the Roosevelt administration,
preaching unchristian hatred and isolationism over a national radio network.
 Francis Townsend (1936) had a plan for old age assistance (aptly named the Townsend
Plan), which wasn’t practical itself but did help spur the Social Security Act.
Question: What was the contribution of Francis Townsend in the 1930s?
Answer: His Townsend Plan helped encourage the development of Social Security.
231
Chapter 17: Roaring, Soaring, and Fighting Depression: 1921–1939
The Grapes of Wrath
John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath (1939) tells the
story of the Joad family’s trip from barren Oklahoma to
California in search of a new life. Enduring death and the
desertion of family members, the Joads push on, learn-
ing that their only hope lies in solidarity with other poor
people. A New Deal relief program tries to help, but in
the end their daughter Rose gives up the milk she had
for her stillborn baby to save a starving man.
Steinbeck won the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize for
Literature, and the film version won two Academy
Awards. The Grapes of Wrath showed rural poverty up
close and put a face on the bravery it took to confront
Depression homelessness. The story built solid support
for social programs in the United States, a country that
only a few years before had elected presidents who said
the government shouldn’t help the people.

Chapter 18
Fighting for Good in World War II:
1940–1945
In This Chapter:
 Avoiding the war
 Getting involved under the table
 Taking care of business at home
 Rolling into battle on both sides of the globe
 Emerging as a world power who can’t go back to isolation
A
merica’s self-absorbed it’s-all-about-me attitude in the 1920s contributed to the nation
getting kicked in the butt by the Great Depression (see Chapter 17). As if that wasn’t
bad enough, the same kind of me-first isolationist impulse on an international scale helped
get the country socked in the kisser by World War II. The U.S. came out of this two-ended
attack stronger than ever because Americans learned to fight back together and take the
lead in solving world problems that they couldn’t escape.
True to the modern social history approach, the big AP exam won’t expect you to know all
the battles, generals, and airplane names. You do need to understand what led up to the
biggest war in history, plus the course of the conflict and its main high points and outcomes.
Because of their age, the Test Masters who put the finishing touches on the AP History
Challenge almost certainly know people who lived through World War II. They’ll expect you
to take this chapter’s topic as seriously as they do.
Backpedaling from the Brink of War
After World War I, Americans tried to crawl back into bed and pull the isolationist covers
over their heads. With the nightmare of the Great Depression already disturbing their sleep,
the last thing they wanted was to get out of bed to see what all that international yelling was
about. The U.S. wasn’t looking for trouble, but no matter how hard the country covered its
ears, trouble seemed to be looking for them from overseas.
Conferring with words, deferring with action
At first, President Franklin Roosevelt was all in favor of the London Economic Conference
(1933), which convened to get the nations of the world working together on solutions to the
Depression. Maybe he thought they were going to send him some money.

When he discovered the Conference just wanted to fix the value of gold, Roosevelt
backpedaled fast. He had been lowering the value of gold in the U.S. to get more dollars in
circulation; the last thing he wanted was an agreement that would fix the dollar-to-gold ratio
and take away his money-juggling trick. Even though the Conference may have helped the
rest of the world, Roosevelt blew it off because it didn’t help the United States.
Other nations noticed the selfish stance of the U.S. and started to act like little brats, too. 
Not only did the London Economic Conference fall apart without the United States, but it
also made countries that much more determined to go it alone and shoot anybody who got
in their way.
Getting along with Latin America
The U.S. was a little chummier with Latin America. Roosevelt initiated a Good Neighbor Policy
(1933) that pledged the United States to work with Central and South American nations to
protect the hemisphere.
The idea of working together peacefully was a marked departure from previous U.S. policy,
which had usually involved the Marines’ polite invitations to cooperate, delivered on the
point of a bayonet. In the 1930s, the U.S. removed troops from Haiti, Panama, and Cuba, hold-
ing on to the base at Guantanamo, Cuba, as a naval keepsake. When Mexico grabbed
American-owned oil wells in their country, the U.S. gritted its teeth but didn’t intervene.
Franklin Roosevelt flew down to Argentina for the Inter-American Conference (1936) and
received cheers as he announced friendly aid and cooperation. With the beginnings of World
War II thundering in Europe, the United States agreed to share responsibility for the Monroe
doctrine with Latin American countries in the Havana Conference (1940).
Japan eyes the Philippines
Following through on the promise the U.S. made when they took the Philippines from Spain,
Congress passed the Tydings-McDuffie Act (1934), which promised the islands their freedom
in 1946 after a final 12-year tune-up. Despite the fact that World War II filled up a large chunk
of that time with a Japanese military occupation of the Philippines, the U.S. kept its promise.
In the meantime, the United States’ willingness to free the Philippines made Japan think the
U.S. really didn’t care that much about the islands. By promising to be nice later, the U.S.
unintentionally let Japan believe that America may be easy to push around.
Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act
In another make-nice bid, Congress let the president set tariff-lowering deals with other coun-
tries under the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (1934). This measure reversed some of the
self-absorbed damage of the Hawley-Smoot law and started the U.S. and the world on a
decreasing-tariff trend that led to the free trade policies that most nations enjoy today.
Although reciprocal trade was hardly enough to make the world peaceful, it was a step in the
right direction. Over the protests of vehement anti-communists, Roosevelt recognized the
Soviet Union in 1933, something that would come in handy later when the U.S. needed allies
in World War II.
234
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Hitler and Mussolini (and sometimes Franco)
Meanwhile in Europe, bad guys were moving into the neighborhood. Benito Mussolini, the
strutting proponent of Fascism, had taken over Italy in 1922. Looking for something strong
and glorious to do, Mussolini invaded the independent African kingdom of Ethiopia in 1935,
sending Italian soldiers in tanks and planes to fight people armed with spears. The League of
Nations, without American support, did little but bluster to stop Mussolini.
Adolf Hitler, the 20th century’s worst bad guy, took over Germany in 1933. After quickly 
getting rid of his country’s struggling democracy, Hitler revived the German economy 
with dictatorial control and projects like the world’s first national freeway system (the auto-
bahn) and commissioning the world’s first specially created “people’s car” (the Volkswagen).
Ominously, he also began an ever-tightening persecution of Jewish people and other minori-
ties. Western democracies tried to overlook Hitler’s crimes because they thought he would
fight Communism.
In 1936, Hitler and Mussolini aligned themselves as the Axis powers. Soon they had a joint
project. The democratic government of Spain was fighting a civil war with would-be dictator
General Franco. Germany and Italy jumped in on Franco’s side, sending troops, planes and
tanks. The elected democratic government got some help from the Soviet Union and individ-
ual volunteers from many countries including the United States. The governments of France,
Britain, and the United States refused to get involved to save the Spanish government, but
Germany and Italy had no such hesitation about destroying it. After three years of brutal
fighting — including the bombing of civilians by Germany and Italy — Franco won.
The Neutrality Acts
As the dictators increased their power, the United States increased its effort to build itself a
better shell. Congress passed separate Neutrality Acts for three years in a row starting in 1935,
in an attempt to avoid the kind of economic entanglement that had led to the U.S. being
drawn in to World War I.
These neutrality acts said that when the president proclaimed the existence of a foreign war,
no American could loan money, sell weapons, or even sail on a ship belonging to one of the
fighting sides. These rules were a step back from the freedom of the seas for which the U.S.
had fought major wars in the past. The Neutrality Acts made no distinction between good
guys and bad guys; the United States wasn’t going to help anybody.
By not working for good, the neutrality acts gave the advantage to dictatorships. The United
States’ hideout also included a refusal to prepare for any possible war. Throughout most of
the 1930s, the American army contained fewer than 200,000 men, smaller than the armies of
Poland or Turkey.
Watching the Flames of War Grow Higher
The military leadership of Japan wanted to control China, and it launched an invasion of that
country in 1937. The United States forgave Japan after the Japanese apologized for sinking an
American gunboat on a Chinese river. In 1940, Japan became a formal ally of Nazi Germany
and Italy.
235
Chapter 18: Fighting for Good in World War II: 1940–1945

Meanwhile in Europe, Adolf Hitler gobbled up territory from countries on both sides of
Germany. At first, his moves were tentative. When Hitler’s troops marched into the demilita-
rized Rhineland region of Germany in 1936, they had orders to turn right around and go
home if anybody stood up to them. Nobody did.
In March of 1938, the German army took over Austria without a fight. At the Munich
Conference in September of that year, England and France agreed to let Hitler take over the
German-speaking part of Czechoslovakia. This sellout by the democracies only bought peace
for a few months. Negotiating with Hitler was like trying to stop a wolf by throwing meat. In
August of 1939, anti-Communist Hitler stunned the world by signing a treaty with Joseph
Stalin, leader of the big Communist Soviet Union. One week later, Hitler invaded Poland.
Britain and France take a stand
Finally England and France had had enough; they declared war on Germany, and the greatest
conflict in history was under way. After several months of preparation, Hitler’s well-organized
forces swept across Holland and Belgium into France. By the summer of 1940, Hitler and his
Italian buddy Mussolini controlled all of Europe except for the home islands of Britain 35
miles across the English Channel.
Hitler pounded Britain with planes to destroy the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and prepare
the islands for German invasion. In the Battle of Britain (1940), the RAF, down to its last few
planes, heroically defended its island nation. As the bombs fell, bulldog Prime Minister
Winston Churchill told the British people to conduct themselves so that if Britain “lasts for a
thousand years, men will still say, ‘This was their finest hour.’” It was.
The U.S. takes a tentative step toward war
By 1938, the United States finally acknowledged that trouble may be coming its way, so it
started to build up the Navy to sink any bad guys before they could get to American shores.
With Europe under Nazi control and America’s mother country Britain fighting for its life, the
U.S. passed its first peacetime draft in September of 1940, beginning a slow process to bring
millions of men into the armed forces.
“Any aid short of war”
Also in September, President Roosevelt took the dramatic step of sending 50 old destroyers
to Britain in exchange for some defensive bases in the Atlantic. He didn’t wait for Congress:
His old friend Churchill had asked him to act now. Aid wasn’t that easy; an America First
(1940) organization led by aviation hero Charles Lindbergh opposed any help for Britain that
may draw America into the war. A law to continue the draft passed by only one vote. Despite
Lindbergh’s popularity, a majority of Americans now favored helping the fight with “any aid
short of war.”
In the middle of the drama came a presidential election. Franklin Roosevelt decided he had
to run again for an unprecedented third term. He won easily despite some uneasiness about
electing anybody three times; the Democrats also maintained their majority in Congress. 
Lend-Lease Bill
Britain was running out of money as well as supplies. A newly reelected Roosevelt intro-
duced the Lend-Lease Bill (1941), which allowed the U.S. to lend or lease military supplies to
Britain and other countries America supported without payment. This move was as close to
236
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

declaring war as the nation could come without actually pulling the trigger; the hope was
that other democracies would do the fighting for America. Lend-Lease had the additional
advantage of tooling up U.S. defense plants to operate at full production before the country
eventually ended up in the war.
Question: What was the purpose of the Lend-Lease Bill (1941)?
Answer: The purpose of Lend-Lease was to get desperately needed supplies to the Allies
without payment in advance.
Hitler invades the Soviet Union
In June of 1941, less than two years after he had shocked the world by signing a peace treaty
with his Communist enemy the Soviet Union, Hitler shocked the world again by invading his
Soviet treaty buddies with a huge army. Having conquered most of Europe, Hitler thought he
could get away with anything. In addition, he sincerely hated Communists (and basically
anyone who got in his way).
Hitler was sure his genius planning would have the German army safely in Moscow before
the first snows fell. During the first weeks of the invasion, the Germans won so much terri-
tory that it looked like those dreams may come true. The Soviet Union seemed to be on the
brink of collapse.
Against the nightmare scenario of the Soviet Union folding like it did in World War I, Churchill
met with Roosevelt on a battleship off Canada. They weren’t supposed to be allies; after all,
the U.S. was still officially neutral and not at war. The two took the unusual step as unofficial
buddies of drafting the Atlantic Charter (1941). The Charter said that all people had the right
to choose their own government, especially to reinstate the democratic governments that
dictators had taken away. It also called for disarmament and peace overseen by an interna-
tional organization.
When they had time to catch their breath, the leaders of the Soviet Union signed on to the
Charter later in 1941. The United States was in the interesting position of dictating war aims
for a conflict it was not fighting. The charade got even thinner when America started to
convoy supplies as far as Iceland through the German submarine packs with a shoot-to-kill
order against attacking U-boats.
Japan attacks Pearl Harbor
In the Pacific, the U.S. also managed to twist the imperial tail of Japan without actually attack-
ing. In late 1940, the United States cut off the shipment of scrap iron and other industrial sup-
plies to Japan; in mid-1941, America froze Japan’s investments in the U.S. and cut off all gas
and military supplies. The Japanese war machine was going to grind to a halt without either
buying supplies from the U.S. or stealing them from the lightly guarded Dutch West Indies.
America said it would turn on the supplies again if Japan backed out of China, but that would
be a loss of both honor and hard-won territory. Japan pretended to negotiate and got ready
for a surprise attack against the United States.
Early on the morning of Sunday, December 7, 1941, with most of the U.S. Pacific Naval Fleet
rocking gently at anchor in the tropical breezes of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, Japanese carrier
planes flew in low to drop bombs that sank or disabled almost the whole fleet and killed
2,500 Americans. Unfortunately for the Japanese, they missed sinking the most valuable
237
Chapter 18: Fighting for Good in World War II: 1940–1945

ships in the Pacific navy, three aircraft carriers that weren’t in the harbor at the time. In
months to come, these ships would come looking for the Japanese. Given that the U.S. had
had no experience at being invaded for the last 125 years, the attack on Pearl Harbor came as
a shocking surprise. Within days, the United States was at war with Japan, Germany, and
Italy.
Having trouble remembering who’s on what side? The major players in World War II were JIG
versus SUB. The Axis Powers were Japan, Italy, and Germany against the Allies, who were the
Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain. Hokey but useful.
Fighting to Win on the Home Front
Having had a couple of years to contemplate, Britain and the U.S. had already agreed to put
most of their efforts into beating Germany first. Although you may be inclined to chase the
wasp that has just stung you, you’re better off to go after the biggest hive first. Plus, little
Britain and the almost-overwhelmed Soviets were politely saying, “Hey, can we get some 
help over here?” Sure, but first the Unites States had to figure out how to feed and equip all
three countries, plus ship its fighting forces and supplies half way around the world in two
directions.
The treatment of Japanese Americans
The American mainland home front was pretty steady, with no real challenge from enemy
bombs or sabotage. However, out of paranoia and racism, the U.S. government herded over
100,000 Japanese Americans into internment camps just to be safe. Most of them were
American citizens; none of them were ever proven to be a real danger to the United States.
They were politely treated for the most part, but many of them lost the small farms they had
managed to buy before the war, when they had grown most of the West Coast’s green beans,
tomatoes, and strawberries. They appealed their internment to the Supreme Court in the
case of Korematsu v. United States (1944), and the Court ruled that the internment was legal.
Despite their harsh treatment, thousands of Japanese Americans volunteered for the army
and fought bravely in Europe. After the war, they went back to their normal lives. Thirty
years after the War, the United States apologized and paid the Japanese Americans who were
still around a small compensation.
Question: What was the Supreme Court decision in Korematsu v. United States?
Answer: The Supreme Court held that the internment of Japanese Americans on the
West Coast of the United States during World War II was legal.
Production kicks off
Production of war material made the United States what President Roosevelt called the “arse-
nal of democracy.” For starters, the U.S. launched almost 3,000 Liberty Ships, each capable of
carrying 10,000 tons of cargo anywhere in the world. On those ships went more than 2 mil-
lion machine guns, billions of bullets, four times as many tanks as the dictators produced,
twice as many fighter planes, four times as many bombers, and five times as many heavy
guns and trucks.
238
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Farmers hauled in record billion-bushel wheat crops by using machinery to replace man-
power. Rationing held down domestic consumption to speed food to American soldiers and
their allies. Government agencies worked to keep a lid on wages and prices. Labor unions
grew, but their leaders mostly kept their men off the picket lines and on the job. To encour-
age worker cooperation, Congress passed the Smith-Connally Anti-Strike Act (1943), which
allowed the government to take over industries tied up by strikes.
The federal government took over the coal mines and for a short period even ran the rail-
roads. Most of the time, the federal government did not need to step in: business and labor
worked together for the war effort. Over all, American workers cooperated with the war
effort by having even fewer work stoppages than laborers in besieged Britain.
During the war, thousands of Mexican farm workers entered the United States, partly as a
replacement for the interned Japanese. They never left.
Workers built liberty ships cheaply and quickly. In a break with tradition, they welded the
ships together instead of riveting them. Ship building used to take months, but Liberty ships
were ready in six weeks.
Women made up a third of the civilian work force; most of these women had never held a job
outside their homes before. They welded the Liberty ships that supplied the armies of
democracy. After the war, two thirds of the women quit their jobs to return to housework,
but they didn’t forget their successful employment. Working women became a natural part of
the United States’ economy in the 1960s, about the time the daughters of the women who
helped win World War II came of age.
The U.S. fights discrimination 
in defense industries
Despite massive federal investment for industrial plants in the Southeast, millions of blacks
left the land of their former enslavement to take new manufacturing jobs in the North and
California.
Cotton-picking was over as an occupation in the South after the invention of a machine to do
the work. Within a generation, a majority of Southern blacks gave up their rural homes and
gravitated toward the city. This migration was so large that it rivaled the influx of immigrants
at the beginning of the 1900s.
Under pressure from the nation’s only black union, the Roosevelt administration forbade dis-
crimination in defense industries. This was the first time black workers had been given a fair
shake in major industries, and they responded by going to work in record numbers.
Minorities contribute in the armed forces
The American record on discrimination was not as good in the armed forces. Blacks fought in
segregated units, often in service rather than combat jobs; however, they did have a limited
but proud record as fighter pilots, soldiers, and sailors. In 1948, three years after the end of
the war, the armed forces became the first major institution in the United States to be offi-
cially desegregated.
239
Chapter 18: Fighting for Good in World War II: 1940–1945

More than 25,000 American Indians served in the armed forces during World War II. In both
Europe and the Pacific, they made special contributions as code talkers who relayed radio
messages in Indian languages that enemy troops couldn’t understand. After the war,
American Indians migrated from reservations to cities in record numbers.
Hundreds of thousands of Mexican Americans served in the armed forces, making up around
3 percent of the army. Although they faced discrimination in housing, education, and even
veterans services after the war, they fought back through legal defense organizations.
Mexican American school children had to attend so-called Mexican schools in California. In
1947, the Mendez v. Westminster court ruling declared that segregating children of “Mexican
and Latin descent” in the state of California was unconstitutional. This ruling helped lay the
foundation for the landmark Brown v. Board of Education (1954) case that ended official racial
segregation for all minorities in the United States public school system.
America finally recovers from the Depression
The United States gross national product (the value of its output of goods and services) dou-
bled during World War II. Although the Depression had hit the U.S. harder than most coun-
tries, America recovered strongly during the war. People were working decent jobs and had
money to spend; average pay by the end of the war was almost twice as much as it was at the
beginning.
As the only industrialized nation not being bombed, the U.S. outproduced the rest of the
world. Millions of people were either in the armed forces or employed by defense industries
supported by federal contracts. The federal Office of Scientific Research and Development
(1941) spent billions of dollars on university research and technical innovation, including the
top secret Manhattan Project (1941) to develop the atomic bomb.
This flood of war spending, not the modest streams of help from New Deal programs, was
what finally brought a complete end to the Great Depression. The war cost more than the
total of every penny the government had ever spent since the American Revolution. As terri-
ble as it was, World War II lifted up the United States both as an international power and as
the world’s richest economy. The same people who started the New Deal in the face of the
Depression ran America during World War II.
The optimistic can-do attitude the United States gained from its trials in war and the
Depression buoyed the nation for the rest of the century.
Question: What was the economic condition of the U.S. home front during World War II?
Answer: The U.S. home front economy completely recovered from the Great Depression
and boomed during World War II.
Following the Fight in the Pacific
After Pearl Harbor, the situation looked bleak for the Allies. Japan had conquered most 
of the East Asia, including the American possessions of the Philippines, Guam, and the 
Wake Islands and the European possessions of Hong Kong, Singapore, the East Indies, and
Indochina. The Japanese said they wanted to start an Asian commonwealth run by Asians,
240
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

but in fact their rule was often more brutal to the natives than that of the Europeans they
replaced.
The Philippines fell to Japan in 1942 after five months of resistance; General Douglas
MacArthur was relocated at the last minute to lead the U.S. Pacific forces in Australia. The
Japanese fought their way to islands just off Australia before they ran in to the slowly grow-
ing strength of the Allied forces.
In the naval battle of the Coral Sea (May, 1942), the first battle in history in which the ships
never saw each other and all the fighting was done by planes, the combined U.S. and
Australian forces fought the Japanese to a standstill and prevented an invasion of southern
New Guinea that would have threatened Australia.
Midway
The tide began to turn for real in the Battle of Midway (1942). In this second all-carrier battle,
the U.S. defended an island outpost west of Hawaii with everything that could float. The
Japanese lost four aircraft carriers and many of their carefully trained pilots; the Americans
lost just one carrier. With its greater population and production power, America was on the
offensive in the Pacific from Midway on.
Guadalcanal
The first real land fighting was an American attack on the small island of Guadalcanal (1942)
that threatened the shipping of supplies to Australia. It took months, but the Americans
finally drove the Japanese off the island. The U.S. hopped from island to island across the
South Pacific, refusing to back down from the fight-to-the-death resistance by the Japanese,
but never backing off. By the end of 1944, the U.S. had won islands close enough to the
Japanese homeland to serve as launching fields for around the clock bombing of Japan 
itself. American submarines and planes sunk Japanese supply ships at a rapid rate.
Hunting Hitler in Europe
The first challenge the U.S. faced in fighting for Europe was getting supplies through the well-
armed wolf packs of German submarines. In the first months of the war, the Germans sunk
more than 500 American merchant ships faster than the U.S. could rebuild them. Without
supplies, Britain couldn’t continue fighting.
Faced with a high tech sub threat, the U.S. and Britain devised cutting-edge solutions. The
British broke the German codes so the Allies had an idea of where the German submarine
packs were hiding. Patrol planes and convoys equipped with sonar attacked the subs.
Over a year, the tables turned. The German subs had to draw back as the Allies sunk more
than a hundred of their undersea boats, in some months at the rate of almost one a day. With
fewer German subs, Allied supply ships were safer; their losses decreased from the equiva-
lent of 75 Liberty ships sunk a month to fewer than 20. Although the Germans kept up their
submarine attacks at a low level for the rest of the war, the time for subs to make a real differ-
ence had passed.
241
Chapter 18: Fighting for Good in World War II: 1940–1945

The British attack from the air
The British believed that heavily bombing German cities would break the German will to
fight (even though when the Germans bombed Britain, it only made the British tougher).
Britain sent more than 1,000 bombers to attack the German city of Cologne.
Now that America was in the war, the Germans were under constant attack from the British
at night and the Americans by day. Heavy conventional bombing didn’t break the Germans’
will to fight or even stop production; the Germans made planes and submarines until the end
of the conflict. What bombing did do was open up a second front in the air before the Allies
invaded Europe while only Soviet troops were fighting on the ground in the first front against
the Germans.
Allied strategic air attacks forced the Germans to spend limited resources on protecting civil-
ians with their guns and fighter planes. Domination of the air over the battlefield by Allied
tactical planes meant the Germans had to give up lightning raids in the open and settle down
to trench warfare, much like in World War I. The Allies remained free to move.
The Soviets fight back
After giving ground to early German attacks, the Soviets caught a break by way of intensely
harsh weather. One of the earliest, coldest, and snowiest winters in Soviet memory broke
over German troops, who didn’t have winter equipment because Hitler had expected them to
win long before the weather got cold. When the snows hit, the Germans were so close to
taking Moscow that they actually stole tickets from the end of the Moscow tram line, but the
Soviets threw their last fresh troops (who just happened to include Cossack ski troops) into
the battle and pushed the Germans away from their capital.
The Germans held on deep in the Soviet Union for another year, but after a heroic defense
the Soviets launched a counterattack late in 1942. From then on, it was a slow and costly
three year fight to Berlin. The Soviets lost 27 million people in World War II, more than 50
times as many people as the U.S. lost. Through 1943, Britain and the United States had lost
only a few thousand soldiers in Europe. The Soviets pleaded for a second front in Europe to
take some of the pressure off their army.
The Allies advance: D-day and Normandy
The Western allies took two and a half years to launch their D-day invasion; meanwhile they
nipped away at the outskirts of Europe. The Allies invaded North Africa in November of 
1942, and by the following summer they’d defeated the German and Italian armies there.
Churchill and Roosevelt met in the newly liberated city of Casablanca to plan the rest of the
war. The Allies next invaded Italy. Although the Italians were happy to get rid of Mussolini
and called it quits by September of 1943, the Germans fought on in Italy until almost the end
of the war.
In June of 1944, the Allies launched a massive invasion of Normandy in France. Over 3 million
men had assembled in Britain for the cross-channel push. Thousands died on the beaches,
but the Allies pushed inland. A second, smaller invasion came from the south of France. Paris
was liberated in August of 1944, and the first major German city fell to the Allies in October.
242
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

In the U.S., Franklin Roosevelt won reelection for an unprecedented fourth term as the Allied
armies rolled toward victory. Hitler counterattacked at the Battle of the Bulge (1944) in
December, but this move merely hastened the end of the war by using up his reserves. By
April of 1945, the Soviets and their Western allies were in Berlin, and Hitler had committed
suicide. Franklin Roosevelt had died of a stroke a few days before.
Revealing the Horror of the Holocaust 
After Hitler’s death, the world began to face the terrible crime of the Holocaust. Almost every
Jew the Nazis could find in Europe had been murdered in cold blood, 6 million people in all.
In addition, Hitler and his willing German and European accomplices had murdered another
5 million political opponents, prisoners of war, Gypsies, Freemasons, disabled children, and
Jehovah’s Witnesses, among others. The United States struggled with the fact that the coun-
try had been unwilling to allow refugees from Europe to seek safety in the U.S. before the 
war. After they knew about the death camps and the killing of families and children, many
Americans made a simple pledge: never again. The experience of World War II influences
America’s international policy to this day.
The Japanese fight on
By the summer of 1945, the Allies had defeated Germany, and U.S. forces were within bomb-
ing range of Japan. Authorities as diverse as future Nobel Prize winner William Shockley and
ex-President Herbert Hoover estimated that the planned U.S. land invasion of Japan would
cost 1 million U.S. casualties and up to 10 million Japanese lives. The Japanese military was
training all civilians — including children — to fight to the death.
The United States had just completed the first test of the new atomic bomb. The Soviet
Union was attacking the Japanese army through China, and the U.S. didn’t want to give the
Soviets time to make territorial claims. After dropping warning leaflets, the U.S. exploded an
atomic bomb over the Japanese city of Hiroshima, killing around 130,000 people. The
Japanese still didn’t surrender. Three days later, the Americans dropped another bomb over
Nagasaki that killed an additional 60,000 people.
Question: Why did the United States drop the atomic bomb on Japan?
Answer: To end the war, stop Soviet expansion, and ultimately save lives.
The ending was deadly, but at least it was actually the end to years of global suffering during
World War II. The dictators’ threat to democracy was so serious that some have called the
Allies’ defense of international freedom the Good War.
Before World War II, only a handful of democracies existed throughout the world. Now, most
of the countries in the world hold democratic elections (or at least pretend to). Before World
War II, the world was an international jungle — every nation for itself. Now, although pain
and conflict are certainly still plentiful, the United Nations and other international organiza-
tions at least try to call attention to abuses and occasionally take real action.
The United States was changed as much as any part of the globe by World War II. Thrust into
world leadership, America could never go back to the dream of isolationism.

Cold War Wind at the Victory Dance:
1946–1960
In This Chapter:
 Prospering like never before after World War II
 Thrusting Harry S Truman into the Presidential spotlight
 Fighting a Cold War of nerves (and entering a couple of real ones) under the shadow of the bomb
 Worrying about Communism
 Stabilizing and changing with Dwight D. Eisenhower
F
rom the outside, the United States seemed like the place to be in the autumn of 1945.
With the help of its allies, the nation had won a stunning victory in battles beyond both
its oceans’ shores (see Chapter 18).
Unlike every other industrialized nation in the world, the U.S. suffered little damage to its
cities. American farms and factories were in full production, and labor had never been so
highly paid. People finally felt safe. The bad guys from overseas had been vanquished, and
the U.S. was the only country with the biggest bat in history: the atomic bomb. Prosperity
continued, but the feeling of safety didn’t last for long. This chapter covers the years after
World War II, particularly the Cold War and its effects on the nation and the rest of the world.
Doing Well but Feeling Nervous
World War II had been a four-year roller coaster ride of war for the U.S. As exciting and won-
derful as it felt to be victorious, however, Americans couldn’t forget that before those four
years had come more than ten years of economic uncertainty in the Great Depression. With
no more wartime jobs, folks had to wonder whether hard times were going to return.
President Harry S Truman had taken over when Franklin Roosevelt died just as the war with
Germany was ending; nobody knew whether he could fill Roosevelt’s shoes. Even more worri-
some was the Soviet Union; that country seemed to be going from ally to enemy even before
the last round of toasts at the victory party.
Enjoying a victory bonus
The baby boom started after World War II — war families were reunited, and people felt 
optimistic enough about the future to want to bring more children into the world. During the
Depression years before the War, birth rates had been down and suicide rates were up
(because the economic depression made people emotionally depressed).

After victory and years of good pay, people felt much better. The postwar baby boom formed
a ten-year population bulge that helped invent ’50s rock-and-roll, ’60s protest, ’70s attitude,
’80s yuppies, and at the beginning of the 21st century the baby boomers were poised to
make retirement an active sport.
After the removal of wartime government price management, costs shot up to match higher
wages. The annual inflation rate went from 2 percent in 1945 to 9 percent in 1946 and 14 per-
cent in 1947 before it started to level off. Higher costs meant wages bought less, and that led
to strikes: More work stoppages occurred in 1946 than during all of World War II.
The Taft-Hartley Act
Although the country still had a Democratic president, it had elected the first Republican-
controlled Congress since Herbert Hoover. Those Republicans managed to pass a bill over
President Truman’s veto that they said would get strikes under control.
The Taft-Hartley Act (1947) prohibited unions from putting pressure on their employers by
picketing other companies that did business with their own company. The act also forbid
unions from requiring that an employer hire only union members (called a closed shop) but
allowed union shops, in which everybody had to join the union after they were hired.
The Taft-Hartley Act is still in effect. It allows states to forbid union shops: Several states
have established right to work laws that prohibit all workers from having to join a union.
Additionally, unions have to give 60 days’ notice when they’re threatening to strike, and the
president can put a hold on strikes that he feels will cause a national emergency.
Switching blue collars to white
At the high point of union membership in the early ’50s, a third of the population was
involved in some sort of union; by the early 21st century, that number had declined to less
than 15 percent. The Taft-Hartley Act itself didn’t cause unions to lose membership — a
change in the kind of work Americans were doing did.
In the 1950s, America experienced a decrease in the number of blue-collar manual laborers
and an increase in the number white-collar service workers; for the first time, the white-
collar workers outnumbered the manual laborers. This abundance of service workers has
increased over the years, and the number of union members has decreased accordingly.
One obstacle for unions is the fact that service workers stay in jobs for a shorter period of
time than they used to; the average American now spends less than four years at one job.
This rapid turnover makes union organizing difficult.
In addition, unions are victims of their own success. Employment practices and wages have
improved so much that many workers don’t think they need the kind of protection unions
can bring.
The Employment Act
After the war, the Truman administration sold unneeded defense plants and equipment at
bargain prices to help employers grow civilian businesses. Congress passed the Employment
Act (1946), which set a goal of maintaining full employment and required the president to
246
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

submit an annual economic report along with the federal budget. The act established the
Council of Economic Advisers, who was responsible for supplying the smarts to keep the
economy and the job market rolling.
Roosevelt’s final New Deal: The GI Bill
A bigger, more immediate payoff than the theories of the Economic Advisers was the benefits
of the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, better known as the GI Bill (1944). The GI Bill
provided for college or vocational education as well as one year of unemployment compen-
sation for returning World War II veterans, whom everybody called GIs (short for Government
Issue). It also provided loans for returning veterans to buy homes and start businesses.
The GI Bill was the last piece of New Deal legislation endorsed and signed by Franklin
Roosevelt. (See Chapter 17 for more on the New Deal.) Ex-soldiers couldn’t believe their good
fortune: The bill paid for education and offered low-interest loans. Although most veterans
attended vocational schools to learn a trade, enough GIs opted for college that many univer-
sities doubled in size. The proportion of the population with a college degree grew from 
5 percent before the war to more than 25 percent in the early 21st century.
Question: What most influenced the number of men going to college in the United
States during the 20th century?
Answer: The GI Bill, which paid for the education of veterans.
Millions of young American families moved to small houses in the suburbs thanks to 
zero-down-payment loans from the GI Bill. This started a housing revolution that took home
ownership from 44 percent in 1940 to almost 70 percent in the early 21st century. All this
education and house-building also helped stimulate the economy by making more jobs. The
GI Bill provided up to one year of unemployment coverage, but few ex-soldiers could resist
getting one of the plentiful jobs before that year was up.
Truman, the Unexpected President
Nobody expected Harry S Truman to be president, least of all Truman. A last-minute compro-
mise candidate as Franklin Roosevelt’s third vice president, Truman had only a few months on
the job when Roosevelt died. Truman said to reporters: “Boys, if you ever pray, pray for me
now. I don’t know if you fellas ever had a load of hay fall on you, but when they told me what
happened yesterday, I felt like the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me.”
Truman was an honest man elected by a political machine, a failed men’s clothing store
owner who joined George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Andrew Jackson as a president
who never went to college. When the love of his life turned him down when he first asked her
to marry him, Truman went off, earned some money, fought in World War I, came back, asked
her again, and she said yes.
As a senator before World War II, Truman took it upon himself to visit defense plants and
push them to be more productive. The sign on his desk said, “The buck stops here”; Truman
wouldn’t stand for blame-passing. Counted out politically, he ran a give-’em-hell campaign
and surprised everybody by winning the presidential election in his own right in 1948.
In his second term, Truman faced an icy freeze of relationships with the Soviet Union, who
had still been America’s warm wartime allies when he first took office. More on those rela-
tionships in the following section.
247
Chapter 19: Cold War Wind at the Victory Dance: 1946–1960

Stepping into Icy Waters: 
Beginning the Cold War
The division of the world into Soviet Union Communist buddies against the United States
capitalist team happened seemingly overnight at the end of World War II. People called it the
Cold War (1950), although it got pretty hot in Korea and Vietnam.
World War II ended with the Soviet Union in control of Eastern Europe. The Soviets estab-
lished Communist governments backed by Soviet troops in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
and other Eastern European nations. Westerners on the capitalist side said that an iron cur-
tain had descended across Europe, dividing the free countries that had real elections from
the Communist countries ruled by party officials.
Don’t get all confused when countries change names. The Soviet Union, also known as the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, also known as the U.S.S.R., was really just the big old
Russian bear with a few captive cubs. When Russia went Communist after World War I, it
took a few (sometimes independent) provinces or countries with it and became the Soviet
Union. When it got over the Communist thing in the 1990s, it let the provinces go and went
back to just being Russia.
Shifting from Allies to enemies
Paranoia struck deep after World War II. The Soviet Union was torn apart by German troops
and had lost millions of people fighting alone in Europe for three long years before Britain
and the U.S. finally got around to the D-day invasion.
The Soviets saw the world as an anti-Communist conspiracy, and they were on a self-
protective and ideological crusade to turn other countries Communist. They especially
wanted a protective barrier of Communist satellite countries between themselves and
Germany, a country that had torn into Russia twice in 25 years.
The Soviets knew that the West had put up with Hitler for years partly because Western
countries thought Hitler could kill off Communism. During the War (before he was vice 
president), Truman had said the U.S. should let the Germans and the Soviets kill each other
off and help whichever side seemed to be losing to keep the bloody fight going. Having lost
27 million people (and almost their country) in World War II, the Soviets had reasons to
worry.
So did the United States. Not only did its so-called Soviet allies become increasingly hostile,
but within a few years the Soviets also got the atomic bomb, and lots of countries, especially
China, went Communist. To people in the U.S., it looked like a conspiracy was afoot in the
world; how else could the Communists become so powerful?
Renewing the sport of distrusting Communists
Like any argument, push came to shove pretty fast between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. because
each side was sure that it was right and the other side was cheating. The United States shut
off Lend-Lease aid to the Soviets and refused to include the Communist countries of Eastern
Europe in the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe. The Soviets refused the rebuilding aid that
was offered by the U.S.
248
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

The Soviets clamped a lid on Eastern Europe and supported any country who said it was
Communist. In response, the United States supported all countries who said they were anti-
Communist. The showdown lead to a dangerous arms race, plus a showdown in jointly con-
trolled Germany and shooting wars (sorry, officially conflicts) in Korea and Vietnam.
A diplomat named George Kennan saw it coming. In his influential 1947 paper “The Sources
of Soviet Conduct,” he maintained that Russian policy, whether from the tsar or from the
Communist Party is relentlessly expansionistic but cautious, and he recommended a policy
of firm and vigilant containment. The United States followed Kennan’s policy.
Question: What was George Kennan’s 1947 policy recommendation?
Answer: Kennan recommended a policy of firm containment of Soviet Communist 
expansion.
Starting the United Nations
Despite the postwar tensions, at least one peaceful organization popped up. The United
Nations (1945) got going at the end of the war; President Roosevelt was getting ready to
speak to the first U.N. session when he died.
Unlike the similarly themed League of Nations (see Chapter 16), the U.N. began with the full
support of the United States. The U.N. has a Security Council controlled by the big powers
and a General Assembly of all nations. Able to act only when the big powers agree, the U.N.
has become an organizing center for peacekeeping missions around the world.
The International Monetary Fund
In other international news, the Western Allies established the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) (1944) during a meeting at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, toward the end of the War.
The IMF is an international organization consisting of just about every country in the world.
The IMF oversees the global financial system by controlling exchange rates and making
loans.
Although IMF international policy has its critics, cooperation tied a more prosperous world
together and helped to lift countries out of poverty to some extent.
Putting the final wraps on World War II
The Allies wrapped up World War II by occupying Japan and Germany. They divided
Germany into zones controlled by Britain, France, the U.S., and the U.S.S.R. Although Berlin
was technically in the Soviet zone, the parties divided it separately; the Soviets got East
Berlin, and the West took West Berlin (go figure). Japan was an all-American show, with
General Douglas MacArthur dictating a democratic constitution.
The Nuremberg trials
In both Japan and Germany, 20 or so major war criminals went on trial, and a few were exe-
cuted. In Germany, these postwar hearings were called the Nuremberg trials (1946), and they
established the principle that people have the responsibility not to follow orders if those
orders violate international law.
249
Chapter 19: Cold War Wind at the Victory Dance: 1946–1960

The Berlin Airlift
As Cold War tensions rose, the Soviets cut off Western ground access to the West’s part 
of Berlin by closing the road that ran across the Soviet governed part of Germany. The
Americans responded with a giant airlift of supplies that kept Berlin alive for almost a year
until the Soviets relented and allowed ground access again. The Berlin Airlift (1949) landed a
plane every minute, using some of the same aircraft that had recently been trying to kill
Berliners.
The Truman Doctrine
President Truman got Congress to approve loans to Greece and Turkey to counter Soviet
moves to turn those countries Communist. He launched the Truman Doctrine (1947) of con-
taining Communism by supporting capitalist countries with money and arms if necessary.
The Marshall Plan
The U.S. supplied a much bigger financial support package to Europe through the Marshall
Plan (1947), which lent billions of dollars to rebuild Western Europe. It worked. By the end of
the 1950s, Western European economies were well on the way to recovery, and the region
had begun plans for the European Community.
Truman also threw American support behind the creation of the state of Israel in 1948.
The National Security Act and NATO
America’s anti-Communist jitters led to the creation of super agencies to fight the Cold War.
The National Security Act (1947) established the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which brought together
top military leaders, and the National Security Council, which brought together intelligence
information gathered by the new Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The next year, Congress
reinstituted the peacetime draft, and in 1949 the nation swallowed hard and entered into the
very kind of “entangling alliance” George Washington had warned about.
With the birth of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) (1949), the U.S. allied itself
with European nations and pledged to respond to an attack on any one of them as an attack
on all. NATO kept a wary eye on the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact treaty buddies. The
Warsaw Pact was the Soviet equivalent of NATO, made up of Eastern European nations under
the control of Moscow.
Fretting over China
While MacArthur helped Japan turn into a peaceful and prosperous democracy, the Chinese
were fighting among themselves. In 1949, Communist leader Mao Tse-tung was triumphant,
pushing the non-Communist Chinese off the mainland and on to the island of Formosa.
The Republicans roundly blamed Truman for “losing” China, but in fact the huge country had
never had a democratic government to defend. The Soviet Union’s detonation of its first
atomic bomb around this same time didn’t really help America’s nervous feelings, either.
Growing Communist paranoia in the U.S. 
President Truman actually launched the anti-Communist hysteria in the United States by
appointing a Loyalty Review Board in 1947 that checked to see whether any of the 3 million
250
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

federal employees were members of supposedly subversive organizations. About 3,000 fed-
eral workers resigned under pressure, although none of them was charged with a crime.
By 1949, supporting those so-called subversive groups was a crime, and members of the U.S.
Communist Party went to jail for supposedly advocating the overthrow of the U.S. govern-
ment. The House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) had a field day uncovering
suspected Communists everywhere, led by an ambitious young congressman named Richard
Nixon who didn’t mind calling anyone who got in his way a Communist sympathizer.
In 1950, Truman vetoed a bill that would have given the president power to arrest and lock
up any suspicious person during a security emergency because it sounded too much like a
police state.
In the midst of paranoia, however, Truman did manage to build some public housing, raise
the minimum wage, and extend Social Security. Any further social programs were held
hostage by the Cold War.
Senator Joseph McCarthy and McCarthyism
Senator Joseph McCarthy made outrageous claims that Communists had infiltrated the fed-
eral government. He said that hundreds of known Communists worked in the State
Department, and he pretended to have a list of their names. He accused respected officials of
being “fellow travelers” with Communists, even picking on former army chief of staff George
Marshall (author of the Marshall Plan) and President Eisenhower.
Communist actions in China and Korea and the speed with which the Soviets had gotten the
atomic bomb scared Americans enough that they supported McCarthy’s wild accusations.
Every time he made a charge that proved false, he simply came up with a new charge. His
witch hunt was called McCarthyism (1952).
McCarthy finally went overboard when he attacked the United States Army. In the great 
tradition of journalists who would not be frightened away from telling the truth, television’s
Edward R. Murrow took on McCarthy while politicians were afraid to act. After 35 days of tel-
evised hearings, many Americans saw who McCarthy really was: a mean-spirited liar who
twisted the people’s worries to get power.  He was censured by the Senate and died of
chronic alcoholism three years later.
McCarthyism showed the power of fear connected to conspiracy theory; it still serves as a
useful example of the danger of hysteric leadership.
Fighting in Korea
Korea was divided between Communist North Korea and capitalist South Korea after World
War II. In 1950, the North invaded the South and the Korean War (1952) was underway. The
United States called the fighting a “conflict” since war was not officially declared, but it cer-
tainly seemed like a war to the people who were getting shot. The Communist North, armed
with Soviet weapons, pushed the South Koreans back to a small pocket on the edge of the
peninsula.
Taking command from Japan, Douglas MacArthur engineered a brilliant landing way behind
Communist lines and pushed the North Koreans back across their border. The U.S. then
made the mistake of taking over all of Korea, right up to its border with Communist China.
251
Chapter 19: Cold War Wind at the Victory Dance: 1946–1960

The Chinese sent in huge waves of soldiers and pushed the Americans and South Koreans
back to the South’s border.
After years of sniping, both Koreas signed a peace treaty, putting things back the way they
were before the invasion.
The Korean War got a U.S. military buildup going that eventually ate up 10 percent of the
gross national product. With Communism in the past, the U.S. defense figure is now less than
5 percent of the GNP.
In the 1950s, the U.S. spent money and lives to defend its democratic capitalist system, but it
avoided touching off a nuclear war that could destroy the world. When Chinese Communist
troops stormed into Korea, General MacArthur wanted to use atomic bombs and risk a global
meltdown. President Truman fired him.
Truman was aggressive in Korea in part to answer critics that his administration had been
soft in letting China go Communist. Nonetheless, he wasn’t going to let Korea lead to World
War III. Paranoia of both sides caused the Cold War, but when the war turned hot in both
Korea and Vietnam, the U.S. took hits rather than use weapons that could destroy the world.
Question: What influenced President Truman in responding with toughness to
Communist aggression in Korea?
Answer: Truman wanted to correct the impression that his administration had turned
soft on Communism because it had watched the Communists take over China without
launching military opposition.
Stepping into the fray: Dwight D. Eisenhower
The Democrats had a five-term run in the White House; now it was time for a Republican.
Actually, the Democrats were thinking of nominating Eisenhower themselves, but after some
reflection he decided he was a Republican. To give Ike a tough anti-Communist ticket, the
Republicans ran Richard Nixon as vice president.
When there was some controversy about Nixon, Ike almost dumped him. Nixon made the
first dramatic use of national television as a political tool by going on the air to speak about
how his wife had only a respectable Republican cloth coat (no minks for her) and how next
the Communist sympathizers would attack the fact that his kids had been given a dog named
Checkers. The Checkers speech saved his nomination, and Eisenhower won the election by
an overwhelming majority.
Eisenhower had been a mediator of often-contentious military units as the overall head of
the Allied forces in Europe in World War II. He used these talents to lead by consensus during
the 1950s. This knack meant that although he was seldom in the forefront on important
issues, he usually came through with reasonable compromise solutions.
Ending the Korean War
The Korean War finally ended after Ike visited the front and threatened to use atomic
weapons. Korea had cost more than 30,000 U.S. lives and hundreds of thousands of Korean
and Chinese deaths. Troops still guard the border to this day.
252
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Liking Ike in the Prosperous 1950s
Americans were ready for some grandfatherly reassurance. The Depression and World War II
had been a strain, and the Communists, Korea, and the Cold War didn’t give anybody much
of a chance to relax. Electing Dwight “Ike” Eisenhower, a balding, kindly leading general from
World War II, as president in 1952 was a relief.
Real income grew at a rapid rate in the 1950s and beyond. Americans — only 5 percent of 
the world’s population — controlled almost 40 percent of the world’s wealth. Money was the
biggest story in the history of the United States since World War II.
Not all Americans profited equally from the affluence of their country, and the nation experi-
enced both recession and inflation, but overall the economic course was up for most of the
people most of the time.
The seeds of future trouble were contained in some aspects of American affluence. Defense
spending stayed high, fully 10 percent of the gross national product (GNP) (value of goods and
services) during the 1950s. President Eisenhower also warned about the bad influence of the
military industrial complex on U.S. society.
Doubling the middle class
Cars, houses, and too many stomachs got bigger. The proportion of the population in the
middle class doubled from the Roaring ’20s; by the end of the 1950s, two-thirds of Americans
were comfortably middle class. Prosperity gave people the space to improve education, civil
rights, and medical care. It also gave the country the income necessary to outspend the
Soviet Union in the arms race and Cold War.
By 1960, one out of four homes in America was less than 10 years old. People could afford
new homes because their jobs were better — more than likely white collar or sales. The first
707 jet passenger planes launched the travel revolution; before the 1950s, most people had
never been on a plane.
Television takes over American households
The 1950s saw the birth of television and fast food. Many now look down on both, but both
provided a rich option of experience and convenience that people wanted. Only 3 million
people in the country had televisions in 1950; by the end of the decade, they were in nearly
every home. In the 1950s, TVs got only three channels; people had to choose from one of the
three shows broadcast by the major networks. Originally, television was only black and white
on tiny screens — color television was a big deal when it came out in the mid-’50s — and a
21-inch picture tube was considered large.
Rocking in the U.S.A.
Rock-and-roll changed music and culture starting in 1954. Elvis Presley may not have had the
first rock record, but he was there at the beginning with Little Richard, Ike Turner, Buddy
Holly, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Rock-and-roll spread like wildfire, bridging the gap between black
rhythm and white melody. The open sexuality didn’t hurt, either; rock was in the sexy com-
pany of Marilyn Monroe, Playboy magazine, and the Kinsey report, which detailed how
normal lust could be. Victorian times were gone forever.
253
Chapter 19: Cold War Wind at the Victory Dance: 1946–1960

Examining alienation and conformity in literature
Literature was actually more dramatic and upbeat in the happy 1950s than in the roaring
1920s. Early-decade social critics like David Riesman in The Lonely Crowd, William Whyte in
The Organization Man, and Sloan Wilson in The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit saw the future in
alienation and conformity. Later, the 1960s would show them how wrong they could be.
Hemingway and Steinbeck turned out career-capping work and won well-deserved Nobel
prizes. Tennessee Williams (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) and Arthur Miller (Death of a Salesman)
wrote searing drama. J.D. Salinger captured adolescent angst and its answer forever in
Catcher in the Rye.
People like Joseph Heller (Catch-22), Kurt Vonnegut (Slaughterhouse Five), and Philip Roth
(Goodbye, Columbus) wrote wittily and meaningfully at the same time. Television wasn’t
killing off culture, at least not yet.
Question: What did social critics like David Riesman warn was a coming social problem?
Answer: Social critics in the 1950s often warned about conformity and alienation from
community.
Women in the workforce
Of the 40 million new jobs that started between 1950 and 1980, 30 million were in clerical and
service work — jobs that women often filled. Women didn’t displace men in the job market;
they just found jobs that were never there before. Working women were nothing new —
women had worked as hard as men on the farm for years. The real anomaly in history was
the first hundred years of the Industrial Revolution, during which time middle-class women
were supposed to just stay home and be domestic goddesses.
Women moved from being less than one quarter of the work force at the end of World War II
to being about half the workers in the early 21st century. This change allowed families to
stretch their incomes, but it caused some wrenching readjustments at first as women tried to
cover being wife, mother, and full-time worker all at the same time (and men learned some
parenting skills to take up the slack).
At least the children were in school; in 1950s America, most kids finished high school. This
number contrasts with the time before World War I, when only half of school-age children
regularly attended classes.
Getting addicted to energy
America began its energy addiction in the 1950s; oil consumption doubled and electric
energy usage increased 600 percent in the two decades after World War II. Big cars burned
more gas and commutes got longer as people moved out to the suburbs, which were home to
25 percent of the population by the end of the 1950s and more than 50 percent of the people
by the 21st century.
The growth of Sunbelt living in the warm Southern climate made air conditioning a regular
part of many people’s lives. Productivity increased with energy usage on the farm: using
petroleum based fertilizers, hybrid crops and gasoline powered harvesters allowed one
farmer to feed ten times as many people at the turn of the 21st century as his grandfather
could at the turn of the 20th century.
254
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

The first computer
The first commercial computer appeared in the United States in 1951. The UNIVAC (for uni-
versal automatic computer) was the size of a small house and used 5,200 vacuum tubes and
125 kilowatts of power to store its full capacity of 1,000 words. With less computing power
than a cheap digital watch, the UNIVAC sold for a nice even $1 million.
The ultimate cost of affluence
One downside of affluence was distance. People moved every few years; adult children often
lived thousands of miles from their parents, grandparents, sisters, and brothers. Airplanes
could bring people together for a few hours at the holidays, but the sense of extended family
was gone. Self-help advice books and psychological counseling barely filled in the gaps.
Affluence could cost a lot in isolation and loneliness.
Because people were cut off from their family roots anyway, they chose to live where it was
sunny; Florida boomed and one out of eight Americans ended up in California. Every elected
President for the last 40 years has come from the Sunbelt.
Changing politics under Ike
Eisenhower’s legislative record was mild like his personality. He often worked with a
Congress controlled by Democrats, and he had to put up with some boneheads in his own
administration. When scientists invented a drug to prevent the horrible childhood disease of
polio, Eisenhower’s secretary of the federal department of health, education, and welfare
condemned the free distribution of the vaccine as “socialized medicine.”
Old soldier that he was, Eisenhower knew the waste that goes with military spending. He
reduced Truman’s military buildup, although costs remained high during the tense Cold War
years.
The administration participated in a major roundup of illegal aliens called Operation
Wetback and tried to set back the cause of American Indian identity by temporarily revoking
the tribal rights of the Indian New Deal. Otherwise, Eisenhower kept the programs from the
New Deal without trying to dismantle or change them. By continuing these programs in a
Republican administration, he helped make them a permanent part of American society.
Ike made his biggest change to the American landscape by starting the huge freeway-building
program that linked the whole country together under the Interstate Highway Act (1956). With
climate change and oil politics, those smooth roads that make people slaves to their cars
now look dangerous, but when Ike started to build them they were just practical.
Continuing tensions with the U.S.S.R.
Eisenhower tried to start peace talks, but the timing just wasn’t right. In 1955, the Soviet
Union rejected Ike’s proposal at a summit conference for open skies over both countries as
an obvious espionage trick. The open skies idea got embarrassing when the Soviets shot
down a U.S. spy plane over the U.S.S.R. in 1960, just in time to shoot down another summit
conference. The U.S. also had to stand by and watch as the Soviet Union brutally crushed a
1956 uprising in Hungary.
255
Chapter 19: Cold War Wind at the Victory Dance: 1946–1960

Worst of all, Vietnam was on the horizon. The U.S. tried funding the French fight against
Vietnamese Communist rebels, but the French lost. After the French left, Vietnam was
divided, and the U.S. supported South Vietnam because although it was a dictatorship, it
wasn’t Communist. America made the same mistake in Iran, using the CIA to put the brutal
Shah in power. Both cynical moves would later come back to haunt the U.S.; I discuss that
further in Chapter 20.
Question: Why did the U.S. increase its involvement in Vietnam?
Answer: When the French left Vietnam, the U.S. tried to shore up the anti-Communist
South Vietnamese regime.
On the friendly side, Ike proclaimed the Eisenhower Doctrine (1957), which offered aid to
Middle Eastern nations. (Because everybody since Monroe had to have their own doctrine.)
Under Eisenhower, the U.S. put a stop to the joint Israeli, British, and French takeover of the
Suez Canal, winning some thanks from the Egyptians. Ike landed troops to help the govern-
ment of Lebanon and got out without a single U.S. death. With the GNP and economy up,
sunny Ike carried almost the whole country in his 1956 reelection.
Working for Civil Rights
Although many blacks had migrated North for better jobs during World War II, more than half
still lived in the South under Jim Crow laws that kept them prisoners of segregated schools,
trains, parks, and hotels.
African Americans died because they couldn’t be treated at whites-only hospitals. The only
place for Martin Luther King Jr. to stay with his bride on their honeymoon was a blacks-only
funeral parlor. Only a few African Americans were registered to vote in the South; the rest
were disenfranchised by poll taxes, rigged literacy tests, and flat-out threats. The lives of
blacks in the South in the 1940s and 1950s weren’t much better than they had been in 1880.
The Democratic Party helped poor people, but it had trouble letting go of its historic base of
support among white Southern racists — ugly, but handy for winning close elections. This
support dated all the way back to the fact that the Democrats were not the party that led the
North in the Civil War.
Dixiecrats
Franklin Roosevelt had made the first move for fairness when he ordered an end to discrimi-
nation in defense employment during the War. In 1944, the Supreme Court ruled that whites-
only primary elections in the South were illegal.
When Harry Truman, a Democratic president from a Southern state, heard about the murder
of six black servicemen returning from the war, he was outraged. Truman supported the first
civil rights legislation in years and desegregated the federal civil service.
Southerners opposed to civil rights walked out of the Democratic Party in 1948 to start the
short lived Dixiecrat Party, but Truman won reelection anyway. Because millions of blacks
had moved to the North and West where they could vote, their voices began to be heard.
Jackie Robinson became the first black player in professional sports in 1947.
Question: Why did some Southerners form the Dixiecrat Party in 1948?
Answer: Dixiecrats opposed President Truman’s civil rights legislation.

Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Rosa Parks
On a cold day in the winter of 1955, Rosa Parks (1955), a college-educated 42-year-old black
seamstress, refused to get up from her seat near the front of a Montgomery city bus to make
way for a white man, and she was arrested. The protests that began with that arrest started
the modern civil rights movement. An early leader of the Montgomery movement was a
young Christian minister named Martin Luther King Jr. (1960).
Brown versus the Board of Education
The civil rights movement had legal and social support. In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in
Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregated schools are “inherently unequal” and that
desegregation must proceed with “all deliberate speed.”
Although Southern representatives initially resisted, desegregation has moved ahead with
the deliberate speed of any major social change, which means it’s taken generations. Legal
forms of discrimination were abolished one by one in the decade after the civil rights move-
ment began in the mid-1950s. These cases were the legal decisions that had the most impact
on American society.
Question: What kind of legal decisions had the most impact following the Second 
World War?
Answer: Court cases involving civil rights were the most important in changing society.
The Civil Rights Commission
Dwight Eisenhower wasn’t a revolutionary. He had grown up in the white Midwest and 
spent his career in the segregated army. But Eisenhower knew his duty. When the governor
of Arkansas threatened to use force to keep black students from enrolling in Little Rock,
Arkansas’s Central High School (1957), Ike called out the army to protect the Little Rock Nine
as they walked into class. Eisenhower also supported legislation to establish a permanent
Civil Rights Commission (1957) to investigate and report on discrimination.
Question: What is the main purpose of the Civil Rights Commission?
Answer: The Civil Rights Commission is responsible for investigating and reporting on
discrimination in the United States.
Sit-in demonstrations
In 1960, four black college students sat down to have lunch in a North Carolina store. Under
orders, the servers refused to wait on them. The students refused to leave, starting the first
sit-in demonstration (1960). The next day, they came back with 19 classmates, the day after, 
85 — by the end of the week, a thousand protestors had converged on the store.
Sit-ins spread to segregated lunch counters all over the country; although the protestors often
met with violence, they kept coming. Eventually, national laws outlawed public discrimination.
Question: What are some of the major domestic events during the Eisenhower 
administration?
Answer: During Ike’s terms the gross national product (GNP) was up, the baby boom con-
tinued to increase population, black families moved from the rural South to the North and
West, the civil rights movement got started, and the interstate freeway system was begun.

Chapter 19: Cold War Wind at the Victory Dance: 1946–1960

Firing Up the Space Race with Sputnik
In 1957, the nation got its second technological shock from the Soviet Union. Just eight years
after the Soviets developed an atomic bomb, they launched Sputnik (1957), the world’s first
satellite. The supposedly backward and politically challenged Soviets now seemed danger-
ously ahead of the U.S. Although an early attempt to loft a tiny American satellite blew up on
the launching pad, the Soviets brazenly sent up another tin moon; this one contained a dog
astronaut named Laika.
Science fever swept the U.S.; the nation had to catch up. Eisenhower established the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (1958) to coordinate a program that would take
the U.S. from launching pad zero to moon walking hero in just over ten years. In addition, the
National Defense Education Act (1958) offered almost a billion dollars in science and other
scholarships.
Castro: Communism Comes Closer to Home
The Yankees got another bad surprise when Fidel Castro (1959) took over as head of Cuba
from a corrupt, U.S.-supported dictator. Castro was a Communist who allied himself with the
Soviet Union, and the Soviets threatened a missile attack if the U.S. messed with Castro.
Almost a million Cubans left their island for the United States, where many of them worked
without end to keep American policy vehemently anti-Castro.
Ushering in the 1960s with Kennedy
Despite the Cold War and other problems during his administration, Eisenhower tried to stay
positive. In his eight years as president, the country enjoyed unprecedented prosperity and a
national unity of purpose that’s hard to imagine in the 21st century. Eisenhower was a suc-
cessful old soldier who as president ended one war and avoided all the others. He left trou-
ble on the horizon, but there was peace on his watch.
The 1960 Presidential election featured Ike’s Vice President Richard Nixon against dashing
young Senator John F. Kennedy. The nation picked Kennedy in a close race, showing that it
had become unprejudiced enough to elect an Irish Catholic. Television, the medium that had
saved Nixon through his Checkers speech eight years before, now did him in. In the first tele-
vised presidential debates, Kennedy looked fresh and Nixon looked jowly. The visual was
enough to swing a few thousand votes, and that swung the election.

ontrary to what you may have heard from your elders, the 1960s and 1970s were nei-
ther the dawn of a hippie age of Aquarius nor the beginning of the downfall of society.
America changed, but then if you’ve read the other chapters in Parts III and IV of this book,
you know that America had always been changing.
The youth counterculture hippie movement often associated with the 1960s lasted from the
arrival of the Beatles in 1963 until the departure of Richard Nixon in 1974. Actually, the hip-
pies never really left; they just settled down with mortgages and kids, much like their GI
fathers and flapper grandmothers had done.
The 1960s and 1970s pushed social changes into the lives of everyone — changes that had
been on the way for a century. These social updates included further expansion of the role of
women, more-equal treatment for African Americans and other minorities, and social free-
dom in dress and behavior. America got more choices and managed to roll over the rocky
ground of Vietnam, assassinations, demonstrations, Woodstock, riots, peace, love, and
Watergate. What a trip!
Although the AP test doesn’t cover current events, questions from several decades ago are
common. 
Kennedy: Progressing Under Cold War Clouds
John F. Kennedy (1960) was only 43 years old when he was sworn in as the youngest elected
president in American history. To add to the movie-star freshness of his administration, he
appointed his 35-year-old brother, Bobby, as attorney general and surrounded himself with a
cabinet of the best and brightest advisers. This strategy was quite a change from the grandfa-
therly President Eisenhower.
Kennedy was handsome and eloquent; at his inauguration, he uttered still-famous lines like
“Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country” and
“Whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us the same high stan-
dards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you.”

Trouble in Cuba
It was a good start, but within weeks of his inauguration, Kennedy was embarrassed by the
failed Bay of Pigs (1961) invasion of Cuba, which the Eisenhower administration had planned.
Ever since Communist Fidel Castro had taken over Cuba two years before, the American CIA
and right-wing Cuban exiles had wanted to kick him out. The exiles stormed ashore, but their
invasion was stopped on the beach. It was an international black eye for the U.S., and
Kennedy took full responsibility.
Round Two of the Cuban standoff took place a year and a half later with the Cuban Missile
Crisis (1962). The Soviets had taken advantage of their alliance with Communist Cuba to
install nuclear missiles on the island that could hit the United States (only 90 miles away) in
the blink of an eye.
When Kennedy found out about the missiles, he ordered the U.S. Navy to blockade all ship-
ments to Cuba. After a tense standoff on the high seas, Soviet ships turned around. Kennedy
reached an agreement with the Soviets that they would remove the Cuban missiles if the 
U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and quietly packed up U.S. rockets stationed 
in Turkey.
The Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than it had been at any
time before or since — one false move on either side could have touched off the bombs.
After the crisis, both sides in the Cold War were more cautious about stirring up surprise
threats.
Peace Corps
Kennedy had a small Democratic majority in Congress, but given that the Southern
Democrats were about as loyal as the South had been during the Civil War, he couldn’t get
much legislation passed. Kennedy did manage to start the Peace Corps (1961), which began
within months to send American volunteers overseas to help developing nations.
The Peace Corps still has about 10,000 volunteers (far less than the U.S. military of more than
a million), but it continues its humanitarian work in countries around the world. Kennedy-
proposed programs for civil rights, health care, and tax reform stalled but would later pass
after his death.
The Space Race
Continuing the U.S. response to earlier Soviet space launches, Kennedy declared that
America would land a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s. With focused scientific
research and billions of dollars, the U.S. sent the first astronauts to the moon in 1969, faster
than anybody thought possible before Kennedy became president.
Kennedy in Berlin
Back on Earth, the Soviets wanted the Western allies out of the democratic outpost of West
Berlin because people kept defecting from Communist East Germany through Berlin, and it
made the Communists look as bad as they really were. The Berlin Airlift had foiled the Soviets’
plan to starve the West out of the city (see Chapter 19), so the Communists built the Berlin
Wall (1961), a jagged fence through the middle of the city.
260
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Kennedy flew to Berlin in 1963 and declared that he stood so firmly behind the freedom of
West Berlin that “Ich bin ein Berliner” (“I am a Berliner”). Kennedy’s speech electrified the
surrounded Berliners; almost the whole population was in the streets to cheer him.
First Steps Toward a European Union
Europe was getting itself together on its way to becoming the European Union (1993), an
international European country with common laws and currency.
Congress took a positive step to back European togetherness and free trade throughout the
world with the Trade Expansion Act (1962). The act allowed import tariffs to be lowered if
reciprocal agreements could be reached with other nations. International negotiations under
the Trade Expansion Act were called the Kennedy round in honor of President Kennedy.
The lowering of tariffs was part of the decades long General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(abbreviated GATT) originally created by the Bretton Woods Conference (1944) as part of a
larger plan for economic recovery after World War II. The GATT’s main objective was the
reduction of barriers to international trade.
The functions of the GATT were taken over by the World Trade Organization (1995), which
was established during the final round of international tariff-lowering in the 1990s.
The United States’ Role as World Cop
The U.S. under Eisenhower had been leaning on its huge nuclear arsenal in eye-to-eye con-
frontations with the Soviet Union, under the horrifying doctrine of Mutually Assured
Destruction (aptly known as MAD). The MAD idea was that neither side could start a war
because they knew both sides would be destroyed.
Under Kennedy, the United States started to play the role of world policeman, even if nobody
had actually called the cops. America largely paid for a U.N. force to police violence in the
newly independent Congo and helped work out an international agreement to prop up a
shaky truce in Laos. These peacekeeping actions called into question the limited military

“Ich bin ein Berliner”
The story that Kennedy’s words unintentionally meant
that he was a Berliner jelly donut is an urban legend —
funny, but untrue. Nobody misunderstood President
Kennedy during his dramatic speech face-to-face with
Communist repression in 1963; he was speaking in
German, which he didn’t understand, but he said the
words correctly.
A too-fancy false reading by a non-German-speaking
New York Times reporter in the 1980s led to the jelly
donut story being later repeated by the BBC, The
Guardian, MSNBC, CNN, and Time magazine. It will
remain false, as any German-speaker knows, no matter
how many times it gets repeated by journalists who don’t
bother to check their sources.
The same is true for legends that the U.S. somehow faked
the moon landings. Few people believe that now, but a
new urban legend pops up whenever any wild but unsub-
stantiated rumor comes along. Usually, these rumors
involve what a mysterious group called “they” are up to;
people love conspiracy theories. As with urban legends
about 9/11, it’s worth doing real research before passing
along a rumor that only proves how gullible some people
can be. For more information, check out Conspiracy
Theories & Secret Societies For Dummies (Wiley).

options of the United States; the U.S. military was set up more to shoot other armies than to
keep the peace.
Non-nuclear brushfire wars demanded a more flexible response, so Kennedy began to build
up elite combat forces such as the Green Berets. These soldiers were supposed to be tough
enough to fight anywhere at a moment’s notice. They were, but that didn’t mean they could
control other countries. In the end, having a ready army and a belief that America could do
anything led to no-win wars like Vietnam.
American troops could go anywhere, but it was just a waste of life to have them stay if the
local government they supported couldn’t win the backing of its own people.
Trouble brewing in Vietnam 
Bad local government number one in a parade of anti-Communist losers supported by the
United States was the corrupt Diem regime in South Vietnam. Kennedy ordered increasing
numbers of U.S. advisers to South Vietnam. By the time of his death, more than 15,000 U.S.
troops were in South Vietnam, too many to advise but not enough to fight.
Kennedy’s successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, upped the ante to more than 500,000
troops, enough to fight, but not nearly enough to win against a popular revolution.
If the Big AP has an essay question about Vietnam, it may be looking for trends in U.S. foreign
involvement. The U.S. has had a hard time learning the same lesson it taught the British
during America’s own fight for independence: The very presence of a foreign army creates a
cause for local rebels. Modern armies can go anywhere, but their weapons let them control
only the ground they’re standing on, not the minds of the people who live there.
The Alliance for Progress
Along with chest-beating confrontation, however, the U.S. under Kennedy also tried some
peacemaking moves. The Alliance for Progress (1961) was an ambitious attempt to offer
Marshall Program-like support to Latin American governments. It failed to transform the area
because unlike Europe, Latin America contained rich elites (including U.S. companies) unwill-
ing to make room for progress by poorer citizens.
Dictatorships took over 13 Latin American countries during the 1960s, and the Alliance for
Progress was later forgotten under President Nixon. Only in the 1990s did Latin America see
the rise of democratic governments able to remain in power despite the opposition of eco-
nomic interests in their own countries and the United States.
Linking up with the Soviet Union
President Kennedy signed the first Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (1963) with the Soviet Union that
stopped polluting bomb tests. A Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed in 1996,
although several nations still don’t go along with the agreement.
Kennedy pushed for a live-and-let-live approach to the Soviet Union and Communist China, a
policy that would later be called détente (1975), a French word that means “relaxation of ten-
sions.” In another move for peace, Kennedy installed a hot line between the White House and
the Soviet Kremlin, so that the leaders could talk directly to defuse dangerous confrontations.

The Supreme Court: Expanding 
Freedom and Responsibility
Throughout the 1960s, the Supreme Court was active in the changes that brought about
more American freedom and responsibility:
 In Engel v. Vitale (1962), the Court ruled that officials can’t require prayers and 
Bible-reading in public schools because they may go against the beliefs of some of the
students.
 In the New York Times v. Sullivan (1964), the Court held that news media could be sued
for libel only if they wrongly attacked a public official out of malice, thus completing a
long chain of free-press decisions that went back to the Peter Zenger case before the
American Revolution.
 With Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) and Roe v. Wade (1973), the Court made birth con-
trol and abortion legal.
 In the case of Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the Court ordered that state legislatures regu-
larly redraw their voting districts to reflect changes in population, thus taking power
away from rural counties and giving it to the places where people actually lived.
 In Miranda v. Arizona (1966), the Court ordered police departments to read defendants
their rights to remain silent and be represented by an attorney when they’re arrested.
Widespread quoting of the Miranda warning in police TV shows and movies has led people in
other countries to demand to be read their rights when they’re arrested. They find out the
hard way that they don’t have American rights yet, but what other countries see in the wide-
spread U.S. media helps spread social ideas.
The Assassination of JFK
President and Mrs. Kennedy were riding in a 1963 motorcade in Dallas when an assassin
named Lee Harvey Oswald shot him in the head from an office building window.
Oswald was a 24-year-old mentally unbalanced former Marine who defected to the Soviet
Union and later returned to the United States. He never stood trial for the assassination
because he himself was shot by an enraged night club owner while in custody. President
Kennedy was so respected and his death was so sudden that most people believed the
shooting must have been a conspiracy to get rid of him.
After more than 40 years, during which hundreds of honest and intelligent people have
devoted lifetimes’ worth of research and scientific investigation to Kennedy’s assassination,
no credible proof of a conspiracy has ever surfaced. Although human nature impels people
to look for a conspiracy to explain any major tragedy, sometimes the explanation is just that
tragedy happens when scared or angry individuals think they can change history by killing 
a leader.
Although it’s tempting to rely on conspiracy rumors to explain tragic events, it’s up to people
to make sad events meaningful by the work they do in memory of those who die. That’s what
Vice President Lyndon Johnson set out to do after he was sworn in as president; I discuss
LBJ later in this chapter.
263
Chapter 20: Rockin’ with the ’60s, Rollin’ with the ’70s: 1961–1979

The Civil Rights Movement Hits a Crescendo
The fight for civil rights that started with Rosa Parks and the Montgomery bus boycott in the
Eisenhower administration kept rolling with sit-in demonstrations (1960) (see Chapter 19).
Civil rights activists called Freedom Riders (1961) risked a trip on interstate buses into the
segregated South to test the Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia (1960), which made
it illegal to discriminate on transportation that crossed state lines.
Near the beginning of the Kennedy Administration, buses of Freedom Riders were attacked in
the South and riders beaten. Although Kennedy couldn’t get the civil rights legislation he
wanted through Congress, he used his personal clout to support black rights and voter regis-
tration. When a 29-year-old African American air force veteran faced violent mobs when he
tried to register to attend the then-all-white University of Mississippi, Kennedy ordered out
the National Guard to protect him.
Taking a stand in Birmingham
Martin Luther King Jr. led a series of demonstrations in segregated Birmingham, Alabama, in
the spring of 1963. After King and other peacefully demonstrating citizens were beaten and
thrown in jail, thousands of students left school to join the protests.
With the news full of pictures of children being blasted with high-pressure hoses and
attacked by police dogs, the white leaders of Birmingham decided they’d better grant blacks
some rights.
A few weeks later, President Kennedy had to use troops again to move Alabama Governor
George Wallace, who was personally blocking the door of the University of Alabama against
two black students. That evening, Kennedy went on national television to talk about civil
rights, a cause he said was “as old as the Scriptures” and “as clear as the American
Constitution.”
The next day, civil rights worker Medgar Evers was murdered in Mississippi. A few months
later, Ku Klux Klan members bombed the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham,
killing four little black girls.
Speaking for peace: Martin Luther King Jr.
In August of 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. spoke to a peaceful demonstration of 200,000 black
and white Americans in Washington, D.C.: “I have a dream that one day this nation will rise
up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident that all
men are created equal.’”
Separation versus integration
Both black and white people were beaten and killed in the South as they worked to register
voters and integrate services. With the rise of the Black Power separatist movement in the
mid-1960s and riots in black urban neighborhoods, whites became less interested in pushing
for civil rights for blacks — they seemed to be pushing hard enough on their own. The fiery
Black Muslim leader Malcolm X called for blacks to separate themselves from whites; he was
assassinated by a black man from another sect. Other separatist leaders included Black
264
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Panther Huey Newton and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee leader Stokely
Carmichael. Working for integration, not separation was the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), chaired by Roy Wilkins.
Question: What was the Black Power movement?
Answer: The Black Power movement of the ’60s was some African Americans’ rejection
of integration in favor of black control over their own communities.
Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy
In 1968, a white racist assassin killed Martin Luther King Jr. King left a legacy of inspiration
and solid progress that is now as much a part of the U.S. as freedom and independence.
In the time since King’s death, black income, education, and community participation has
risen steadily. After 200 years of slavery and another hundred years of racist discrimination,
America still has miles to go, but Martin Luther King Jr. showed the way.
Question: What were the leading black organizations (and their leaders) of the civil
rights movement?
Answer: Important black civil rights organizations include the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (led by Martin Luther King Jr.), the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee (headed by Stokely Carmichael), the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People (chaired by Roy Wilkins), the Black Muslims (led by
Malcolm X) and the Black Panthers (led by Huey Newton).
From Reform to Quagmire with LBJ
Lyndon B. Johnson took the oath of office on a plane back to Washington while standing next
to the wife of just-murdered President Kennedy. He had been only two cars behind in the
motorcade when Kennedy was shot.
As soon as he could, President Johnson began to work to pass legislation. He told Congress
that he knew no better way to “honor President Kennedy’s memory than the earliest possible
passage of the Civil Rights Bill for which he fought so long.”
Over continuing Southern opposition, Congress passed the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The act prohibited discrimination in public facilities, in government, and in employment,
invalidating the Jim Crow laws in the South. Forcing segregation of the races in schools,
housing, or hiring became illegal. Opponents argued that the government couldn’t legislate
morality on the race issue; supporters countered that they didn’t care what people thought
in their minds as long as what they did was fair.
Legislating for the Great Society
A year after Kennedy’s assassination, Johnson ran for president against the conservative
Republican Barry Goldwater. When Johnson pushed through the Civil Rights Act, he said 
that it would cost the Democrats the votes of the South for a generation. Five states from the
old South did vote for Goldwater, but except for his home state of Arizona, that was all
Goldwater won; the rest of the country was for LBJ. Johnson’s landslide helped sweep the
Democrats to a two-to-one majority over the Republicans in both houses of Congress.
265
Chapter 20: Rockin’ with the ’60s, Rollin’ with the ’70s: 1961–1979

Johnson lacked Kennedy’s charm, but he knew how to get things done; he may have been the
most successful legislative president in U.S. history. When he was really rolling after his
reelection, he got almost all of the bills he wanted passed by Congress. These laws included
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed unfair qualifications tests that kept minorities
from the polls, and the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, which created programs to help
poor people. The road seemed opened to creating what Johnson called the Great Society
(1965). Great Society programs still in effect today include the Job Corps (1965), Head Start
(1965), and Food Stamps (1964). These and other War on Poverty (1965) programs were
designed to help lower the poverty rate in the United States. During the Great Depression,
the poverty rate was 40 percent; when Johnson became President it was 15 percent, and it’s
now about 12 percent.
Women’s liberation
The 1960s saw a progressive tide that included a second wave of women’s rights often called
women’s liberation. Betty Friedan wrote The Feminine Mystique (1963) about unfulfilled
women, and helped found the National Organization of Women (NOW) in 1966.
Question: What was the second wave of women’s liberation?
Answer: The second wave focused on equal rights for women in the workplace and
home and was supported by author Betty Friedan and the National Organization of
Women (NOW).
Medicare, Medicaid, and the 24th Amendment
The most extensive benefit program passed by Johnson was the Medicare Program (1965),
which pays for health care for older people, and the Medicaid Program (1965), which covers
health care for poor people. These programs faced diehard opposition from both
Republicans and the American Medical Association, but Johnson maneuvered around the
foes of government-sponsored medical care to bring coverage to millions of people.
Question: What was LBJ’s Great Society plan?
Answer: A set of training and social assistance programs designed to lower the poverty
rate in the U.S.
Johnson appointed the first black Supreme Court justice and the first black Cabinet member.
He guided the ratification of the Twenty-fourth Amendment (1964), which banned the use of a
poll tax to limit voting in federal elections. The Immigration and Nationality Act (1965) abol-
ished the national origins qualifications for immigrants and doubled the number of new
Americans admitted to the country.
Vietnam Explodes into Full-Scale War
As President Johnson was winning battles to control domestic legislation, he was losing bat-
tles to control Vietnam. Kennedy had limited U.S. involvement to a few thousand so-called
advisers, but all the advice in the world couldn’t get the corrupt South Vietnamese regime to
defeat a dedicated group of South Vietnamese Communist rebels and their North Vietnamese
allies.
Just before the 1964 election (which Johnson won by playing a peacemaker), the U.S. Navy
had traded a few shots with North Vietnamese patrol boats when the U.S. ships pushed too
266
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

close to the North Vietnamese shore. This Gulf of Tonkin (1964) attack got Congress to pass
the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (1964), authorizing the use of direct American force in Vietnam.
When the Vietnamese rebels attacked an American adviser base after the elections, Johnson
declared war.
By the end of 1965, almost 200,000 U.S. troops were in Vietnam, and Johnson was in a major
macho-off with the Communist leaders. Over Johnson’s presidency, the troop levels grew:
200,000 became 300,000, which grew to 400,000 and finally 500,000 soldiers. It always seemed
like just a few more troops ought to be enough to win, but it never was.
Question: What was the Gulf of Tonkin resolution?
Answer: In response to a minor naval confrontation, LBJ got Congress to authorize the
use of direct U.S. force in Vietnam.
Hard fighting in Vietnam
The battle in Vietnam was like a war between an elephant and a fly: The fly couldn’t kill the
elephant, but the elephant couldn’t fly. American soldiers had a hard time fighting with no
front line, in steaming jungles where the enemy could be anywhere. A young man in street
clothes could shoot you in the back and then hide in a group of civilians.
Vietnamese farmers and their wives and kids were in the middle of the war — millions of
them got killed, both by the rebels and the U.S. side. Desperate to stop the rebels, the U.S.
dropped thousands of tons of bombs, some with chemicals to kill the trees the Vietnamese
hid under.
Protesting against the war
With the draft hanging over their heads, hundreds of thousands of students marched in
protest demonstrations against the war. Demonstrators showed up wherever President
Johnson tried to speak, chanting “Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?” They
ignored his attempts to change the subject to the War on Poverty and instead shouted
against the real war in Vietnam that was killing the people of their generation at a rate of
more than 20 deaths a day.
LBJ’s Vietnam was eating up LBJ’s Great Society. In violation of the law, Johnson used the CIA
and the FBI to spy on antiwar protestors.
Question: How did the war in Vietnam affect LBJ’s domestic Great Society program?
Answer: By taking money and political support, the war made Johnson’s Great Society
program less effective.
Losing heart after the Tet Offensive
Believers in the war kept saying that they could see the light at the end of the tunnel; they
believed that the U.S. had almost won. The light at the end of the tunnel went out during the
huge Vietnamese Tet offensive in early 1968.
Although the U.S. was hoping that the rebels were almost beaten, the Communists launched
a simultaneous attack on most major South Vietnamese cities beginning during the New
Year’s holiday Tet. The rebels penetrated the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon; a few of
them even made it to the grounds of the U.S. embassy.
267
Chapter 20: Rockin’ with the ’60s, Rollin’ with the ’70s: 1961–1979

Although the rebels were pushed back with heavy losses, the very fact that they could
mount such a wide attack destroyed American confidence. The long road to a negotiated
peace began.
Question: What was the Tet Offensive?
Answer: Widespread rebel attacks during the Vietnamese new year that led to increased
U.S. opposition to the war.
LBJ bows out; Robert Kennedy is assassinated
With the U.S. population turning against the war, LBJ knew he stood little chance of reelec-
tion. Even though he had won by a huge landslide in 1964 and had passed the most legisla-
tion, he hardly beat an obscure challenger from his own party in an early primary.
What was worse, he was finally opposed by Robert Kennedy, the younger brother of the now-
sainted President Kennedy. In a surprise announcement, LBJ declared he wouldn’t run again.
Vietnam had ruined him.
Robert Kennedy swept the primaries but was assassinated by an Arab immigrant only a
month after Martin Luther King died. 
As with the JFK assassination, no real evidence of a conspiracy in the second Kennedy killing
has ever come to light.
In the midst of demonstrations and police violence a few weeks later, the Democrats nomi-
nated Johnson’s loyal Vice President Hubert Humphrey. With a Southern segregationist run-
ning as a third-party candidate, Humphrey narrowly lost the presidential election to
Republican former Vice President Richard Nixon.
Nixon, the Experienced One
Richard Nixon was elected on the promise that he was the experienced one who could bring
an honorable peace both to Vietnam and to the demonstration-thronged streets of America.
The U.S. was deeply divided between the established order and a counterculture of mostly
younger people who opposed the war and supported a rights revolution of liberation for
women, blacks, and other minorities, as well as free personal behavior and expression. The
counterculture included a small violent fringe of Black Panthers who advocated armed
defense of African American interests and mostly white radical Weathermen who were willing
to be violent because they thought the times demanded force. The Weathermen took their
name from the words of a Bob Dylan song that went: “You don’t need a weatherman to tell
which way the wind blows . . .” Most of the counterculture was a large peaceful tribe of
flower-wearing hippies.
The U.S. actually has an unbroken and under-reported tradition of small group opposition to
established power that limits any of the rights outlined in the Declaration of Independence.
During the 1960s and ’70s, the opposition got bigger; a lot of changes that had been in the
works for hundreds of years came to the forefront. After much conflict, the social revolution-
aries settled down to work in a new order that was freer than the old.
During the height of the demonstrations, Richard Nixon’s Vice President Spiro Agnew called
the youthful protestors “nattering nabobs of negativism.” Several of the young people cut off
268
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

their easily identified long hair and sent it to Agnew in a pillow, neatly embroidered with the
words “Now we could be anywhere.”
Increasing the fight for peace
The rapid economic growth of the 1950s slowed in the 1960s and ’70s. As the U.S. spent more
money on military campaigns, it had less to invest in business growth and social programs.
More research and development went into bombs, not cars and other consumer products.
Unburdened with big military expenses, the World War II losers Japan and Germany became
economic winners by producing products people wanted to buy. The U.S. economy slid into
inflation and slow growth.
Richard Nixon said he would end the war in Vietnam, but he didn’t. As the war dragged on
and deaths mounted, antiwar demonstrations increased. Frustrated young soldiers in
Vietnam became more disorderly, sometimes attacking their own officers. Desperate to win,
Nixon expanded the war to neighboring Cambodia.
Protests get violent
In the United States, hard-pressed National Guard troops killed four student demonstrators
at Kent State University in 1970; police got into shootouts with black nationalists. Young war
protestors got some official reprieve as military draft calls were reduced, and the Twenty-
sixth Amendment (1971) allowed young people to vote starting at age eighteen.
Question: What happened at Kent State University?
Answer: Protesting students were shot by the National Guard in 1970.
China and the SALT talks
President Nixon’s 20 years of experience in international affairs finally began to pay off with
visits to China and the Soviet Union. Nixon normalized previously frozen U.S. relations with
China and set the stage for further détente. Nixon arranged the sale of much-needed
American food to the U.S.S.R, and started U.S.-Soviet SALT (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks)
(1972) that limited missile deployment.
Question: What are some examples of détente in Nixon’s foreign relations policies?
Answer: Nixon reestablished relations with China, sent food to the Soviet Union, and ini-
tiated the SALT talks.
Nixon’s social programs
Conservative Nixon was surprisingly liberal with social programs. He expanded welfare,
Medicaid, and Food Stamps and created a new Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program
(1974) to help the disabled. In addition, he indexed Social Security payments to rise with
inflation. As the U.S. moved toward being a modern welfare state, the portion of the national
budget tied up in entitlement programs to pay for benefits rose. Nixon supported affirmative
action for the hiring of minorities but opposed busing to achieve racial balance in schools.
He actively managed the economy by briefly imposing a wage and price freeze and taking the
U.S. off the gold standard.
269
Chapter 20: Rockin’ with the ’60s, Rollin’ with the ’70s: 1961–1979

Perhaps most important in the long run, Nixon established the Environmental Protection
Agency (1970) to attempt to clean up damage to the natural world. The need for urgent action
was first made clear by author Rachel Carson in the book Silent Spring, which warned that
pesticides and pollution were poisoning song birds and other animals. The Clean Air Act
(1970) and the Endangered Species Act (1973) began to set environmental standards for the
country.
Pulling out of Vietnam
Nixon, who had managed to get 95 percent of the troops out of Vietnam, won reelection in a
landslide over the Democratic antiwar candidate George McGovern. He ended the war with a
face-saving peace treaty in 1973; by 1975 the Communists had overrun the South Vietnamese
government supported by the United States.
A murderous Communist tyrant called Pol Pot seized power during the postwar instability in
Cambodia and ended up killing a quarter of his own people. He was finally stopped by the
very Communists the U.S. had been fighting.
The War Powers Act
The controversy over the war also led to the War Powers Act (1973), which limited the 
president’s ability to send troops into combat without Congressional approval. If the long
war with its 56,000 American and millions of Vietnamese deaths proved anything, it showed
Communists that the U.S. was willing to fight and die to oppose Communist beliefs. Twenty
years later, militant Communism was all but gone from the world.
Question: Who ended active U.S. participation in the war in Vietnam?
Answer: President Richard Nixon signed a treaty and withdrew U.S. troops.
Watergate
Richard Nixon got caught in dirty tricks that cost him his job only months after a landslide
reelection. Back in 1972, burglars hired by the president’s associates had broken into a local
Democratic office in the Watergate apartment complex in Washington. A long investigation
proved that Nixon had been involved in this and a number of other illegal actions against
political opponents.
Meanwhile, Vice President Spiro Agnew was forced to resign in 1973 after being caught 
taking bribes. When Agnew went off to repay some of the money he stole, the Twenty-fifth
Amendment (1967) handily provided for a replacement vice president. Congress gave the
deeply-in-trouble Nixon only one choice: good old reliable Gerald Ford. Ford would assume
the presidency when Nixon, faced with impeachment, resigned it in 1974.
Gerald Ford Steps In
Gerald Ford had been a congressman for 25 years without ticking people off (or even writing
any legislation). Ford barely had time to warm up his vice president’s chair before he became
president upon Nixon’s resignation.
270
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Ford pardoned the departing Nixon, which made him almost as unpopular as Tricky Dick
himself. He also signed the Helsinki Accords, marking a move toward détente in the Cold War,
and supported women’s rights and education for handicapped children. Despite President
Ford’s support, a proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution that would have
legally prohibited discrimination against women fell three states short of passing.
Ford stood by without intervening as South Vietnam finally fell to the Communists; eventu-
ally half a million Vietnamese would escape to live in the U.S. Even though he was the sitting
president, Ford barely won re-nomination in 1976.
During the Ford era, Congress passed Title IX (1972), making colleges give money to support
women as well as men in sports. In Milliken v. Bradley (1974), the Court put a cap on the very
school integration they had started 30 years before by holding that students couldn’t be
bused across school district lines to meet integration goals.
A few years later, in University of California v. Bakke (1978), the Court found that universities
can’t have separate, easier admissions programs for minorities; race and underprivileged
status can be a factor but not the only factor for getting into school. 
Too-Good President Carter
Jimmy Carter won the presidency in America’s bicentennial year of 1976 by promising to be a
good and honest leader. He may have been too good. Carter was a peanut farmer who had
served a term as governor of Georgia. With no Washington political experience, he ruffled the
feathers of congressmen used to feathering their own nests.
Carter tried to get America to cut down on its energy gulping habit by turning the thermostat
down in federal buildings and even requesting a ban on Christmas lights. He signed the SALT
II (1979) arms limitation treaty and patched up Social Security. Carter brokered a peace treaty
between Israel and Egypt in the Camp David Agreement (1978). Putting human rights at the
forefront of American policy, Carter began to withdraw support for brutal dictators, even 
if they were friendly to the U.S. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979 led to an
American boycott of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow.
The Iranian hostage crisis
One repressive guy Carter continued to support came back to haunt him. The United States’
buddy, the Shah of Iran, was overthrown by Muslim fundamentalists, who seized the U.S.
embassy and held its staff hostage for over a year. Faced with an unhappy American public,
Carter decided to tell the truth: “We’ve learned that piling up material goods cannot fill the
emptiness of lives which have no confidence or purpose.” That made Americans feel guilty;
they weren’t willing to stop piling up the goods just yet.
Carter’s problems mount
The mood of the people wasn’t improved when the Three Mile Island (1979) nuclear power
plant experienced a near meltdown, and opposition to nuclear power increased. Carter’s 
bad luck got worse when a swimming rabbit actually attacked him while he was out fishing.
Americans were beginning to feel like maybe a tough-guy action hero would be a better
choice than their good-guy President Carter.

Question: What was the result of trouble at Three Mile Island?
Answer: Opposition increased to the development of nuclear power plants.
Carter lost the 1980 election to Ronald Reagan, a former actor who did a much better job
looking the part of a president than Jimmy Carter (more on that in Chapter 21). Jimmy Carter
went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize, working tirelessly for peace and democracy. America
took a turn toward conservative politics and an uncertain future as world leader.

T
he U.S. took a turn to the right under Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. Reagan helped end
the Cold War with a little help from the tapped out Communists. He also instituted a tax
shift that let the rich get richer and the middle class get a little poorer.
Reagan talked against government but spent so much money on the military that by the end
of his term he had tripled the debt of the country. But by energetically following the policy of
containment of Communism started under Democratic President Truman after World War II
and followed by every president, Republican or Democrat, since that time, Reagan got the
honor of presiding over the end of the Cold War. The presidents who came after him got the
dubious honor of facing a rising national debt.
As the U.S. sailed toward the 21st century, it seemed for a while that the entire world just
wanted to live free and easy like the Americans they saw in movies.
When the 9/11 buildings came crashing to the ground, the U.S. discovered that the America-
is-cool sentiment wasn’t exactly unanimous. Some people hated American lifestyle, attitude,
and foreign policy so much they were ready to explode themselves to get even. These people
included both home-grown bombers and foreign militants.
Although the AP U.S. History exam has few questions on modern times, an understanding of
how themes and topics apply to recent issues helps show good analysis in essay writing.
Ronald Reagan and Reaganomics
All the hippy-dippy demonstrating, impeachment, moralizing, and rabbit attacks of the 1970s
had left Americans longing for a simpler life. They found their leader in Ronald Reagan, who
handily defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 Presidential election.
Reagan believed in small government and lower taxes. He was a champion of the antis:
Reagan was anti-gay, anti-abortion, anti-feminism, and especially anti-special programs to
help minorities. He was especially supported by right-wing religious people who called 

themselves the Moral Majority (1980) and believed that their Christianity was right and that
anyone who believed differently was a tool of the devil.
In a strange way, Reagan’s appeal was a reverse copy of FDR’s crusade for the so-called for-
gotten man; Ronald Reagan defended hardworking regular people that modern society seemed
to have forgotten. The only difference was that Reagan defended their feelings, and FDR
defended their income. Reagan’s tax breaks ended up helping the rich far more than the poor.
Returning to the good old days with the neocons
Ronald Reagan had the support of thinkers who called themselves new conservatives or neo-
conservatives (1985). This small group of writers, known as neocons for short, believed in the
counterintuitive proposition that if Reagan cut taxes, tax income to the government would
actually rise because people would have more money to spend and the economy would
grow. It didn’t work for Reagan; he managed to pass a large tax decrease, but the economy
just sputtered along during much of his administration.
Tax policy alone isn’t the key to economic growth. High-tax Europe and Japan grew rapidly 
in the late 20th century. The low-tax United States slipped into the Great Depression in 
the 1920s. How much money people have isn’t the issue — how they spend it controls the
economy.
Supporting military buildup
Neocons also believed that aggressive military intervention would increase America’s power
in the world. They supported a large military buildup (difficult to do with lower tax revenues)
and confrontation with Communists around the world.
Military power seemed to work best when it was restrained; America’s potential for destruc-
tion helped force the U.S.S.R. to send Communism into a timely grave. When Reagan actually
unleashed U.S. military might, the results were often unfortunate, like the U.S. intervention in
Lebanon that ended with Marines being bombed in their barracks, or successful but
overblown, like the large American invasion of the tiny island of Grenada.
Turning back the clock on government regulation
As far as domestic government policy goes, Reagan was against it, saying that “Government
is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem.” Although he didn’t succeed
in making the federal government much smaller, he did what he could to turn back the clock
on government regulations.
Reagan’s first Secretary of the Interior eased environmental regulations on polluting indus-
tries and favored opening wilderness areas and shorelines for oil and gas leases. When air-
traffic controllers went on strike, Reagan fired them.
His economic policies were called Reaganomics (1982) or supply-side economics; less govern-
ment was supposed to mean more growth in the economy and, almost magically, more tax
revenue. Tax cuts under Reaganomics mostly succeeded in making more money for the
wealthy. The economy actually grew at a slower rate during the Reagan administration than
the post-World War II average. Reaganomics simply didn’t work when it came to creating
growth or increasing government revenue.
274
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

To the credit of Reagan’s administration, the interest rate policy of the economists he
appointed helped bring inflation, which had soared under Nixon and Carter, back under con-
trol. Reagan also won applause by appointing the first woman to the Supreme Court.
Question: What was the most noticeable effect of Reaganomics?
Answer: It got more money for rich people.
Running up the trade deficit
During the Reagan administration, the U.S. went heavily into debt and ran an international
trade deficit of billions of dollars a year. Neither of these trends has stopped since the
Reagan period; addiction to foreign oil and imported consumer products has made the U.S.
spend far more overseas than it takes in from exports.
This discrepancy is called the balance of payments (1986) problem. The U.S., which in the
first half of the 20th century was the master of international business, became the world’s
largest debtor nation beginning in the 1980s.
Checkmating Communism
Reagan took an aggressive stance against Communism, which he called “the evil empire.” He
built up American military might and announced his intention to deploy a Strategic Defense
Initiative (1983), better known as Star Wars, to shoot down Soviet missiles before they could
get to the United States.
This plan apparently impressed the Soviets more than it did U.S. scientists; Star Wars was
cited as one of the reasons the Soviet Union gave up the military race with the United States
and began to dismantle their Communist economic system. The U.S. military was never able
to deploy a large-scale missile defense system, but the bluff worked.
The Cold War reaches the freezing point
The Soviets clamped down on a freedom movement called Solidarity (1981) in the govern-
ment of Poland (which they controlled). The U.S. responded with tough words and an eco-
nomic embargo.
When the U.S.S.R. shot down a Korean passenger plane that had strayed into Soviet airspace
in 1983, Reagan called it an act of barbarism. By the end of 1983, all arms-control negotiations
had broken down. The Soviet Union almost launched nuclear weapons against the U.S. when
they briefly mistook a Western military exercise for a nuclear attack. They also boycotted the
1984 Olympic Games held in Los Angeles. The Cold War was reaching the freezing point.
The U.S. flexes its military muscles
In the 1980s, Iran and Iraq were fighting a war that the United States didn’t mind watching;
America had little love for the leaders of either country. The U.S. supplied arms to Iraq in the
early 1980s as payback against Iran for holding American embassy people hostage up to the
first hour of the Reagan administration. This arms deal was one reason that Iran may have
been behind the Marine barracks bombing in Lebanon.
275
Chapter 21: Leading in the Modern World: 1980–Now

In 1983, Reagan sent troops into Lebanon to try to calm endless Middle East conflicts. More
than 200 Marines died when an Arab extremist suicide bomber blew up their barracks. U.S.
troops, who never had a clear mission to begin with, withdrew a few months later.
In the same month, Reagan sent a heavily armed invasion party to the tiny Caribbean island
of Grenada to wipe out some Communist troublemakers. They succeeded in restoring demo-
cratic government in a move that would have made Teddy Roosevelt proud.
Reagan cruised to reelection against a Democratic ticket that included, for the first time in
history, a woman as vice presidential nominee.
Mikhail Gorbechev
The Soviet Union had a new leader: Mikhail Gorbachev promised glasnost and perestroika
(1986), which mean openness and restructuring. The Soviets began to shrink their military
spending and concentrate on long-overdue civilian improvements.
In 1987, Ronald Reagan stood in front of the divisive Berlin Wall and said, “General Secretary
Gorbachev, if you seek peace . . . open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!” Late in
the year, the two leaders signed the INF Treaty (1987) banning all intermediate-range nuclear
weapons from Europe. Two years later, the Berlin Wall came tumbling down.
Iran-Contra and other problems
In an illegal and morally challenged international trick, Reagan administration officials later
agreed to sell arms to the desperate Iranians in return for secret payments that these offi-
cials channeled to anti-Communist rebel forces in Nicaragua that Congress had officially
rejected American aid to.
In making their secret deal, the Reagan administration officials weren’t only helping a regime
that had kidnapped Americans; they were also acting against the expressed direction of
Congress. This kind of action is grounds on which Congress can impeach a president. Reagan
pleaded ignorance of the plot; his secretary of defense was charged with criminal behavior.
An investigation found that Reagan knew or should have known about the bad deal.
Other holes appeared in the ethical shell of the administration elected with the support of
the Moral Majority. Environmental Protection Agency officials resigned in disgrace after they
misused staff and gave special deals to polluters. Three of Reagan’s cabinet members, includ-
ing the attorney general, were investigated for lying and stealing; Reagan’s personal White
House aide was convicted of perjury.
His last days in office were clouded by a stock market crash, but he remained sunny and
optimistic. When he died in the early 21st century, his burial site was inscribed with his 
own words: “I know in my heart that man is good. That what is right will always eventually
triumph. And there’s purpose and worth to each and every life.”
One Term of George H.W. Bush
George Herbert Walker Bush came as close as you can to inheriting the presidency. His
grandpa was a presidential advisor to Hoover, and his dad was a U.S. Senator. He himself
already had a White House office as vice president to Ronald Reagan.
276
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Even though Bush had once called Reaganomics “voodoo economics,” he was happy enough
being Reagan’s vice president and was easily elected president in 1988. Although he was a
former representative to China and head of the CIA, Bush stood by without even proposing
economic sanctions in 1989 when Chinese tanks crushed democracy demonstrations in
Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. Democracy had more luck in Europe.
The fall of the Soviet Union
In 1989, the former Soviet puppet governments fell, as did the Berlin Wall. Eastern European
nations were now free to govern themselves. What had been the Soviet Union split into the
Commonwealth of Independent States, the largest of which was Russia. A hero for helping
the Communist empire open toward freedom, Mikhail Gorbachev fought off a coup attempt
from party hardliners and then retired, leaving behind a small world of independent nations
struggling toward democracy.
Bush signed the START II Treaty (1993) with Russia, pledging both nations to reduce their
long-range nuclear weapons by two-thirds. The U.S. military scaled back with the end of the
Cold War.
In additional good news, Nelson Mandela gained freedom from prison and became president
of a democratic interracial South Africa. Free elections in Nicaragua ousted the leftist govern-
ment there without the necessity of the Iran-Contra plotting of the Reagan administration.
The U.S. tossed a drug-lord dictator of Panama out by force.
Operation Desert Storm
Saddam Hussein, the leader of Iraq, invaded the neighboring oil-rich country of Kuwait in
1990. Working through the United Nations, President Bush skillfully put together a coalition
of the United States and 28 other nations to kick Saddam out. Although the U.S. contributed
more than half a million troops, the other nations added 250,000 more on their own.
Operation Desert Storm tore through opposition forces like a hurricane; U.S. and coalition
forces rolled over Hussein’s army in four days. Kuwait was free; the only problem was that
Saddam Hussein was left in power in his capital of Baghdad.
277
Chapter 21: Leading in the Modern World: 1980–Now
Family legacies in U.S. politics
In a large and diverse nation, some families just seem to
pop up again and again in leadership roles. George H.W.
Bush wasn’t the first president to see his son take the
office. That would be the father and son team of second
President John Adams and sixth President John Quincy
Adams.
William Henry Harrison, ninth president, was the grand-
father of 23rd President Benjamin Harrison.
The Kennedy dynasty includes (but isn’t limited to) 35th
President John, his ambassador father Joseph, and his
senator brothers Bobby and Ted, not to mention his
niece Maria Shriver (who’s married to California’s best-
built governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger).
Family legacies extend beyond bloodlines, too. Husband-
and-wife team Bill and Hillary Clinton have held the
offices of president, governor, and senator between them.

Legislation under the elder Bush
On the domestic front, Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (1990), which
prohibited discrimination against the one in seven people who have some form of physical
or mental handicap. (Bush managed to appoint a conservative African American to the
Supreme Court.)
Bush grudgingly accepted some improvements in environmental water usage and civil rights,
but the only controversial legislation he proposed was the tax increase that cost him the
presidency.
Campaigning in 1988, Bush had dramatically said, “Read my lips: No new taxes.” Faced with
huge budget deficits, he was forced to go back on his word and raise taxes in 1990. The
Democrats wouldn’t let people forget that mistake.
Modern Democracy with Bill Clinton
The Democrats hadn’t elected a two-term president since World War II, but they had a
charming centrist in Arkansan William Jefferson Clinton. Bill Clinton defeated Bush’s reelec-
tion bid by emphasizing the paycheck of the average American, which had actually grown
smaller during the Bush administration. A sign in Clinton’s headquarters said, “It’s the econ-
omy, stupid.”
Clinton ran a positive campaign based on pro-growth, strong defense, and anti-crime plat-
forms that almost sounded like the Republicans. He promised to overhaul the creaky welfare
and health care systems. He admitted (as indirectly as possible) to “causing pain” in his mar-
riage and smoking marijuana. He was the perfect candidate for the baby boom generation,
which made up most of the U.S. voting population.
The new rainbow America
While Clinton won the presidency, the nation was undergoing a radical change in elected 
officials. The new House of Representatives included 1 American Indian, 7 Asian Americans,
19 Hispanic Americans, and 39 African Americans; 48 of the representatives were women.
That was more women and minorities than had ever been elected before, and the numbers
continued to grow into the 21st century.
At the beginning of the Clinton administration, the nation wasn’t willing to accept just how
broad the rainbow was becoming; a bid by Clinton to allow homosexuals to serve openly in
the armed forces was rejected for a don’t-ask-don’t-tell halfway measure.
Clinton appointed his wife Hillary to come up with a national health plan. Industries making
big money off a piecemeal non-system that left one out of six Americans with no insurance
managed to convince people that Hillary’s reform proposals were scary. Health care reform
took a back seat until the 21st century.
Although Republicans often accuse Democrats of being tax-and-spend crazies, Clinton man-
aged to turn the huge budget deficits run up by 12 years of Republican administrations into
modest budget surpluses. He passed anti-crime bills that also contained some gun control
provisions.
278
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Battling extremism
Clinton was just in time with the anti-crime — in 1993 Muslim extremists took their first shot
at the World Trade Center in New York with a bomb that killed six people. A couple of years
later, home-grown terrorists blew up 168 people along with the federal building in Oklahoma
City. Shootouts with extremists and in schools shocked the nation. Although the hundreds of
deaths involved in these events were better than the thousands that happen in a war, domes-
tic violence showed that Americans weren’t all happy campers.
Contract with America
Especially unhappy were the members of the old Moral Majority, who saw the country being
swept by the devil’s work of abortion, drugs, welfare, and religious apathy. They joined a
Republican counterattack called the Contract with America (1994), which promised welfare
and budget reform. The Republicans swept to victory, controlling both the House and the
Senate for the first time in 40 years.
Reforming Welfare
Now Bill Clinton got to see what it had felt like to be a president with an opposing Congress,
something that Republican presidents had put up with for years. Clinton survived by work-
ing with the Republicans; after all, he was a conservative Democrat. Clinton signed the
Welfare Reform Bill (1996). Over the wails of old-school Democrats, the bill forced welfare
recipients to work when they could and restricted benefits for new immigrants. Despite
angry opposition from social conservatives and Republicans, Clinton had most of the coun-
try with him when he breezed to reelection in 1996.
Politics of the possible
Clinton was unable to expand health care, but he added loans for college students and
modest tax breaks for poor people and raised the minimum wage. His greatest political
advantage was a robust U.S. economy that enjoyed the longest period of sustained growth in
American history. Clinton supported international trade with the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) (1993) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) (1994); these agree-
ments made exporting American manufacturing jobs easier but brought down the cost of
goods in the United States to bargain levels. Clinton fought against tobacco and guns, both of
which caused a lot of deaths.
In international affairs, Clinton intervened without getting America stuck in any big wars. He
failed to offer effective help when millions of people died in tribal violence in Africa, but he
sent in troops to stabilize Haiti and to stop years of ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia.
Clinton took some missile shots at terrorists in Afghanistan and Sudan, but limited U.S.
involvement in the Middle East to the ever-elusive goal of encouraging peace talks between
Israel and its Palestinian neighbors.
Dogged by controversy
Like most presidents, Clinton’s administration wasn’t without controversy. He staunchly
denied having an affair with a 20-something White House intern, but DNA evidence later
279
Chapter 21: Leading in the Modern World: 1980–Now

forced him to backpedal. The Republican-controlled Congress brought Clinton up on
impeachment charges for lying to a grand jury about his involvement, invoking that extreme
Constitutional mechanism for only the second time in U.S. history.
They clearly took it more seriously than the American people; the Democrats actually gained
seats in Congress during the run-up to the Congressional trial. Impeachment requires a two-
thirds vote to pass; Clinton’s charges couldn’t even get a majority vote. Clinton’s wife, Hillary,
said that ongoing investigations of the Clintons during most of their time in the White House
were a right-wing tactic to stall social legislation. After years of public investigation, the
Clintons were never convicted of anything, and Clinton left office with the highest approval
ratings of any post-World War II president.
Clinton held off Republican attacks on most social programs and modestly improved the
lives of regular people by protecting wilderness land, hiring new teachers, and increasing
opportunities for higher education through grants and loans. The economy offered nearly
full employment, and real income for working people crept up after decades of inflation-
adjusted doldrums. As he was leaving office, the issue of global warming was heating up, and
Clinton’s vice president, Al Gore, promised to do something about it if only he could get
elected president.
George W. Bush, Terrorism, and War
As the world faces the threats of climate change, it’s tempting to think what would have hap-
pened if an environmentalist had won the most votes in the 2000 presidential election. Oh,
wait a minute; Al Gore did win the most votes. He just didn’t win the election because of a
fluke in the way the Constitution structures the presidential election: indirect election
through an electoral college.
Due to the state-by-state, winner-takes-all Electoral College, a candidate who narrowly wins
more states can win with a minority of the votes. You can’t get any narrower than George 
W. Bush’s election in Florida: He won by 500 votes out of 5 million. Voting along party lines,
the Supreme Court stopped the Florida recounts, and Bush was declared the winner of the
election.
Ironically enough, under the recount rules Gore initially requested, Bush would have won,
and under the rules Bush requested, Gore would have won. The election was that close. In a
further irony, Ralph Nader’s Green Party bid had siphoned off enough votes to deny environ-
mentalist Gore a clear victory.
Texas governor to U.S. President
George Bush grew up around the White House while his dad was Reagan’s vice president and
then a one-term president on his own. Young Bush had been a popular governor of Texas and
cultivated a close relationship with Moral Majority Christians based on his own story of
being born again to true religion after a wild youth.
Without trying to turn the clock back on New Deal social reforms, Bush campaigned on social
issues like being against abortion and in favor of business growth. His faith-based social serv-
ices distributed billions of dollars through Christian religious organizations that were sup-
posed to provide social help, not religious preaching, to stay clear of the First Amendment’s
prohibition of the establishment of a government-supported religion.
280
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

Facing increasing economic problems
If the key to being president is really, as Clinton felt, about “the economy, stupid,” then the
Bush administration could be judged on its economic numbers. The gross domestic product
(value of the output of goods and services produced within the nation’s borders) grew at an
average annual rate considerably slower than the average for the post-World War II period.
Unemployment stayed low. Budget deficits rose rapidly, a change from the budget surplus in
the last year of the Clinton administration. Inflation-adjusted median household income was
almost flat, and the nation’s poverty rate increased slightly.
The national debt went up by trillions of dollars during Bush’s presidency, adding more than
a third to the burden future generations would have to pay off. With the low cost of imported
manufactured goods, living was easy for most Americans, but the bulk of income gains went
to people earning more than $250,000 a year.
Health care and children: Hot-button issues
President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act (2001), which improved educational stan-
dards but failed to provide much funding for schools. He vetoed the State Children’s Health
Insurance Program (SCHIP), which would have expanded health care for poor children,
because he said he was against socialized medicine.
He may not have supported children’s health, but Bush took a turn toward government
health care for older people when he signed the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement
and Modernization Act, which added prescription drug coverage to Medicare (though people
pay extra for it).
Bush also vetoed a bill that would have allowed for stem cell research to find cures for dis-
ease; some religious conservatives opposed the controversial research.
Climate change and global warming
Upon arriving in office in 2001, Bush withdrew United States support for the Kyoto Protocol,
an amendment to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change trying to control global
warming; as a major world polluter, the U.S. was the only leading country not to sign.
Bush administration officials censored the reports of government officials on global warm-
ing, and Bush said he didn’t take action on the problem because of “debate over whether it’s
man-made or naturally caused.”
Bush did set aside the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands as a national monument, creating the
largest marine reserve in the world.
Hurricane Katrina
One of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history, Hurricane Katrina, struck early in Bush’s
second term. The storm destroyed much of the city of New Orleans and the surrounding
north-central Gulf Coast of the United States. Many thought Bush was slow in getting aid to
the region; his director of emergency management eventually resigned. To his credit, Bush
took full responsibility for the problems.
281
Chapter 21: Leading in the Modern World: 1980–Now

9/11 and living in a terrorist world
After his minority election, Bush wasn’t very popular, but the country came together to 
back him after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Towers and the Pentagon in
Washington. As he stood in the smoking ruins of the towers and promised justice and protec-
tion, over 90 percent of the American people said they approved of his actions.
After the 9/11 attacks, in which hijacked planes destroyed the twin 110-story World Trade
Center buildings in New York and damaged the Pentagon in Washington, Bush condemned
Osama bin Laden and his organization Al Qaeda (2001) (which means “the base”). Bush
announced that the United States would attack other countries (even though they weren’t
directly threatening the U.S.) if those countries harbored terrorists.
President Bush gave the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, a
warning to “hand over the terrorists, or . . . share in their fate.” Bush announced a global War
on Terrorism, and after the Afghan Taliban regime wasn’t forthcoming with Osama bin Laden,
he ordered an invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban regime.
In 2003, he also invaded Iraq, whose connection to 9/11 was vague at best. Unlike his father’s
1991 Iraq war, this time only a few thousand outside troops joined the largely American effort
as the U.S. Army pushed into Iraq. The U.S. military was bogged down for years in both Iraq
and Afghanistan. With chances for a clear victory dwindling, the American public got tired of
the news of bombs and casualties.
Following the 9/11 attacks, Bush signed an executive order authorizing wiretaps without a
court order. The American Bar Association said that move was illegal, and after years of
wrangling, Bush agreed to abide by the law. Although President Bush felt he was standing
tough in the cause of freedom, his popularity sunk to historic lows.
At the end of his administration — as conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan dragged on with no
end in sight — Bush’s approval rating had sunk to just 24 percent, the lowest since Nixon
resigned in disgrace 35 years earlier.
Adjusting to the 21st Century
As the 21st century rolled in, the old school world was clearly gone for good. The United
States was the senior modern democratic government in the world and the newest source of
social innovation. In a sense, the U.S. was the U.N.; all the nations of the world were repre-
sented in its population.
If the world could ever find a way to live together, it would have to start in the United States
of America. The U.S. moved closer to fulfilling the democratic dream of its founders as
minorities and women were increasingly freer to express themselves and leadership looked
more like the pluralistic society it represented.
Business changes with society
Business showed how society had changed. At the time of the Revolution in the 1700s, most
people lived on farms and produced what they needed in isolation, except for a Sunday trip
to church and maybe a little salt, sugar, and coffee from the country store. In the 1800s, canals
and railroads stitched the states together. Buying or selling over distances as great as several
282
Part IV: U.S. History from After the Civil War to the Days of the Internet 

hundred miles suddenly became possible. People got to know a wider world and formed
associations that eventually changed women’s rights, slavery, and government.
Large stores like Sears started out sending orders through the mail. With the growth of cities
in the 1900s, stores built big buildings. As airplanes and telephones brought the world
together, international trade made products cheaper, and world travel allowed people to
appreciate both what was different and what was comfortably human about foreign lands.
In the early 2000s, the Internet (2000) brought general store sites like Amazon and the ability
to trade pictures and text instantly anywhere in the world. Second-generation sites like
Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, and Facebook allowed direct links to people, products, and
ideas that the searcher may not have known even existed before. To the democracy of poli-
tics was added the democracy of culture and communication.
Because people could download any music for free (legally or otherwise), the economics of
the recording industry changed dramatically. Movies had to go to immediate release before
someone could copy them and pass them around. People longing to communicate churned
out even more writing, music, and videos. Computer games allowed people to play with folks
they had never met. MP3 players let everybody travel to her own soundtrack.
A continuing trend: The rich get richer, 
the poor get poorer
The United States wasn’t a democracy of economics; America had in fact one of the largest
gaps between rich and poor in the developed world. Moving toward the second decade of
the 21st century, people who made more than $120,000 a year saw their share of the national
income grow from 15 to 20 percent.
Part of this discrepancy was due to tax breaks passed by a Congress well funded by business
contributions, and part of it was the natural rewards of educated workers in high tech indus-
tries. The virtual absence of well-paid union jobs for people with less education didn’t help,
either. Although the rich got richer, the middle class and most of the poor still had enough
money to get by.
Breaking family ties
Family ties broke down, and people established new families of friends. One out of two mar-
riages ended in divorce, and more and more people lived alone or in single parent house-
holds. Chat sites replaced front porches, and surfing the Internet largely replaced
newspaper-reading.
Living longer, but at a price
More people exercised and fewer people smoked. After waddling into the 21st century due to
the yummy presence of cheap fast food everywhere, Americans started to get a grip on their
waistlines.
Most elderly people lived comfortably into advanced age with Social Security and Medicare.
Because Social Security was a pay-as-you-go system, the number of young workers available
to pay taxes that supported retirees was critical. In the early 21st century, there were seven
283
Chapter 21: Leading in the Modern World: 1980–Now

young workers for every retiree; by the year 2050 there may be only four. Because people
lived longer, the need for new sources of funding threatened old-age benefits. Social Security
already cost more than regular taxes for most working people.
Question: As more Americans became older, what system became threatened?
Answer: The Social Security system needed an overhaul to maintain benefits.
Shifting minority demographics
Latinos replaced African Americans as the second most populous group in the United States.
More and more places, like the state of California, were majority minority: no single group
made up more than 50 percent of the population.
The U.S. took in more immigrants than ever before — almost a million a year. These new legal
residents kept the United States growing and full of new ideas. Illegal immigration was a real
problem for social service providers; at least 10 million undocumented people from other
countries flooded the educational and health care systems. Illegal immigrants also paid taxes
and seldom collected long-term benefits. Estimates indicated that one of every hundred dol-
lars paid into the Social Security system came from an illegal immigrant who would never be
eligible to collect benefits.
In the early 21st century, Asian Americans families made 20 percent more money than the
average white household. Two and a half million American Indians and others who were 
part American Indian made up as big a population as was present when Columbus arrived.
American Indian income went up as tribes operated gambling casinos in 29 states and took 
in billions of dollars a year in revenue.
More Americans in prison
Americans in the land of the free kept more of their citizens in prison than any other advanced
society. The number of people in prison went up from less than 400,000 in 1980 to more than
2 million in the early 21st century. This increase was part of a great U.S. experiment to see if
locking up perpetrators actually held down crime. It seemed to work; major crime was down
in the U.S. in the early 21st century.
Venturing farther into the 21st Century
Escaping urban problems, most Americans lived in the suburbs. With air conditioning, more
and more people lived comfortably in the South’s hot climates. Both of these trends increased
energy demands and made coping with global warming that much more challenging.
Americans were used to being distrusted for their affluence and feared for their easygoing
cultural influence around the world. They were often seen by those who didn’t like them as
soft, yet Americans had stood up to frontier wars, militarism, Nazism, Communism, discrimi-
nation, and terrorism. They still welcomed the world. For better or for worse, the U.S. was
more than just its past; the United States of America was the future.

Practice Test 1: Acing the 
Early Names and Dates
T
ime has come today to find out what you know. Don’t worry; a little fake pain now saves
potential real pain on the day of the Big Exam. The practice test in this chapter covers
the period from American Indian days to the Civil War.
Just like when it’s for real, allow yourself 55 minutes to answer the 80 multiple-choice ques-
tions on the first part of this test. Keep track of the time: Set an alarm for 55 minutes and go
for it. The time limit breaks down to just 40 seconds per question, so mark and pass any
question you’re not sure of. (See Chapter 4 for more on timing strategies.) Just think about
this section as an isolated multiple-direction point hunt. Don’t even think about the rest of
the test until you have the Section 1 multiple-choice challenge out of the way.
 Multiple-Choice: 80 questions, 55 minutes
 Document-Based Question: 1 essay, 60 minutes
 Regular Essays: 2 essays, 70 minutes
To make it easy to spot time periods in which you may be weak, I keep most of the multiple-
choice questions on the two practice tests in chronological order, with the questions about
the earliest time period at the beginning. Remember — the actual AP U.S. History exam will
have the time periods of the questions all scrambled. Although the practice tests mostly stay
in chronological order, I’ve done a little scrambling so you know what it feels like to be
chronologically challenged.
The 80-questions-in-55-minutes thing on the multiple-choice section means you need a per-
sonal check in. At 30 minutes, you should be passing about question 40; this pace ensures
that you have enough time to go back and shore up any weak spots. Practice tests are as
much about figuring out timing as remembering answers.
For best results, don’t just say the answers to the questions you know. Mark the answer 
sheet just like you will when the big test goes live. That way, you get in the rhythm of the 
real thing. If you don’t want to mess up your beautiful For Dummies book, just copy the
answer sheet.
Do not flip to the answer chapter (Chapter 23) when you run into a tough question to see
whether you’re guessing right; you’ll find out soon enough when the test is done. You’re not
going to be flipping around on test day, and that’s what you’re preparing for here.
After you spend 55 fun-filled minutes answering the 80 multiple-choice questions, you’ll take
a mandatory 15-minute preparation period to consider your fate on the Document-Based
Question (DBQ). You’ll then have 45 minutes to write the best DBQ you can dredge up from
your mind and associated imagination. Pause, take a deep breath, and then go on to the regu-
lar essay questions. Pick the question that seems the least threatening from Part B. Take 5
big minutes to plan your response and 30 minutes to write the essay. Then do the same thing
with Part C.

Document I
Source: Census data, Antebellum Economics
In 1860 the twelve wealthiest counties in the United States were all in the cotton growing
South. Per capita income in the white South was higher by 1860 than in the North. With an
economy based on slavery, the South was different from any other section of Europe or the
United States.
Many Southerners initially opposed slavery; hundreds freed their slaves following the
Revolution. With the invention of the cotton gin after the Revolution, cotton began to make
huge amounts of money. As late as the 1830s, a bill in the Virginia legislature to abolish slav-
ery came within a few votes of passing. After that, as the profits continued to rise from slav-
ery based cotton, Southerners made the white fluffy fiber their “king” and became addicted
to black slavery.

nly after you complete your essays in the practice test (see Chapter 22) do you peek
at the answers in this chapter! You may even want to have your teacher (or another
student who’s roughly as smart as your teacher) read your essay efforts to independently
evaluate how you sound. The essay points in this chapter are just one way to handle the
topic. Your clear ideas and the political, economic, and social evidence you bring forward to
support your ideas are what matter most. For any question that really stumps you, go back
and review the history in this book and in your school textbook. Taking sample tests gives
you an early warning so you can tune up for super success on the big AP.
For general tips about scoring and how to handle questions, see Chapters 4, 5, and 6.
Section I: Multiple-Choice
1. (D). Columbus set sail for the East Indies, so the inhabitants at his destination would logi-
cally be “Indians.”
2. (B). Remember, meso means middle.
3. (C). The Iroquois Confederation actually gave the early colonies ideas about the power of
united action.
4. (E). Meso means middle, not an Indian tribe. Here’s a mnemonic device: “I’m not forgetting
the order of the Big Three tribes, AM I?” From north to south, the geographic order is
Aztec, Maya, Inca.
5. (E). All four were important foods the settlers picked up from the American Indians. If you
know for sure that at least two of the choices are correct, you know that (E) has to be the
answer by default.
6. (C). Only Magellan has a GPS system named after him. The others were more local explorers.
7. (E). Even if you don’t remember that the encomienda system gave Spanish colonists legal
power over Indians, you can still throw out the smart-aleck answers about housing and
cooking as being not worth an AP question. At worst, that gets you down to a three-choice
guess, statistically worth the risk.
8. (A). With the Armada gone, Britain got set to rule the waves.
9. (B). Popé’s Rebellion in the Spanish West and King Philip’s War in New England were wars
with the American Indians that happened at about the same time in the late 1600s. You can
remember the difference if you think of the Indian leader who just happened to be called
Popé as associated with the pope-following Catholic Spanish colonists.
10. (D). Settlers didn’t find any gold, but not because they didn’t try.
11. (D). Slavery happened early in the New World.
12. (D). The real money was in growing sugar in the West Indies.

13. (A). The Pilgrims grimly wanted to get completely out of the Church of England; the Puritans
simply wanted to purify it.
14. (D). The Puritans thought they were too pure to allow radical self expression, especially
coming from a woman (like Anne Hutchinson).
15. (C). The Dutch founded New Amsterdam on the tip of Manhattan.
16. (D). The Quakers in Pennsylvania actually believed in treating the American Indians like
human beings.
17. (B). Like Popé’s Rebellion, King Philip’s War was a battle with American Indians, so you can
rule out any answer choice that doesn’t include them.
18. (D). In the Dominion of New England, the King tried to dominate.
19. (D). Most slaves went to the West Indies and South America, white indentured servants did
most of the hard work before 1700, and slaves rebelled when they could.
20. (C). The late-1600s clothes, stern judges, and multiple girls making accusations identify this
picture as the Salem Witch Trials.
21. (D). At the height of their power and fury, the Indians came pretty close to wiping out the
original colonial sites. And if you read the question carefully, you see that, although the
other answer choices may be nice American Indian images, they’re not about power.
Regardless of the details, (D) is the only answer that satisfies the topic.
22. (A). The Germans were an important part of the population from the early days, complete
with sausage and beer.
23. (D). The population of the colonies in 1750 was around 1 million; by the Revolution, it was
over 2 million. The patriots fought the Revolution with fewer people than now live in the
Sacramento area.
24. (C). The Scotch-Irish were poor-but-tough Protestant backwoods farmers.
25. (D). Ben Franklin called out the militia to defend peaceful American Indians against the
bloodthirsty Paxton Boys.
26. (D). Outside the aptly named New England, a majority of the population wasn’t technically
English. Although they shared a government (often unwillingly), Scotland, Ireland, and
Wales weren’t part of England.
27. (C). Mercantilism means colonies send raw materials that get turned into merchandise.
Colonies were expected to buy this merchandise at a nice profit to the mother country.
28. (A). Cotton was small-time before the cotton gin, but lots of people wanted to smoke.
29. (D). The Navigation Acts were mercantilism under sail: They were meant to block trade with
anybody but England.
30. (C). The colonies were doing very well financially, thank you. See Chapter 9.
31. (C). Early universities were all about religion.
32. (D). New light ministers put emotion into the First Great Awakening.
33. (A). By the clothes and classical pose, this is the picture of a Revolutionary Enlightenment
man. The other answers are wrong by generations.
34. (D). The Three-Fifths Compromise gave slaveholding states 3⁄5 voting credit for every slave,
even though they didn’t give the slaves much credit as human beings.
35. (C). The Peter Zenger trial helped establish freedom of the press. Notice the repeat of the
word freedom in three of the five choices for this question. The correct answer is usually
one that’s part of the pattern.
312
Part V: Practice Makes Perfect: Two Tests Plus the Answers 

36. (D). With sugar, tobacco, and slaves, America had its share of bad habits, but opium wasn’t
one of them.
37. (B). The Albany Congress was an American-Indian-and-settlers meeting.
38. (A). Remember the order of the laws goes from general to worst: first Navigation, then
Stamp, and finally Intolerable.
39. (B). Loyalists viewed themselves as the real patriots — to England.
40. (E). The Revolution and its writings were pure Enlightenment. See Chapter 10.
41. (C). This excerpt is from Martin Luther King’s famous “I have a dream” speech. Be ready for
out-of-chronological-order questions: The real AP test will be full of them.
42. (E). Marching is difficult if you don’t have shoes.
43. (C). This is the only answer that even fits the time period; you can throw out all the other
answer choices as being too late.
44. (B). The ordinances set up what was then the Northwest of the new United States. In this
case, you can get a clue by going with the most important answer: the AP isn’t going to
bother you with questions about small happenings.
45. (A). State power goes with the idea of a loose confederation.
46. (C). The Confederation’s biggest legislation was the Northwest law.
47. (D). Look closely at the longest answers. Because test writers don’t want arguments, they
usually phrase the right answer carefully. In this case, (D) is the most specific, precisely
worded choice (and one of only two that deal with the concept of a republic at all).
48. (A). Thomas Jefferson was one of the most prominent supporters of small government
(although he did add a lot of territory to be governed with the Louisiana Purchase).
49. (D). Freedom starts in your mind with religion, speech, and press.
50. (C). Notice that a couple of answers contain the word bill; after you pick that pattern out,
the Bill of Rights is hopefully ringing some bells. You can definitely get rid of (E), the
Founding Fathers, as a smart-aleck answer.
51. (A). Federalists wanted a strong federal government. You can chuck (C) as a smart-aleck
choice.
52. (A). The first thing a repressive government moves to protect is itself. The other answers
aren’t sedition.
53. (B). John Marshall made the Supreme Court into a powerful third branch of the federal
government.
54. (D). Of the choices, (B) and (D) present the most important concepts. If you remember that
Jefferson was for small government, you can eliminate answer (B) right away and recognize
(D) as the most likely possibility.
55. (C). Because embargo means to stop trade, (E) doesn’t make sense. (C) is the most impor-
tant remaining choice and the correct answer.
56. (D). You can eliminate (C), about the Star-Spangled Banner, as a smart-aleck throwaway. Even
if you don’t know history, if you can eliminate one choice it’s statistically best to guess.
57. (C). With the AP’s emphasis on social struggle, people in questions will tend to be those
who fought back, not just folks who went along with powerful interests. In this case, that
points to (C) as the most likely answer.
58. (E). If you know blacks fought in more than one of these battles, you know it has to be all of
them, choice (E).

59. (C). The Era of Good Feelings was a victory lap for the new United States, which hasn’t expe-
rienced an oversupply of political good feelings since.
60. (A). “Review all laws for constitutionality” is the most important answer choice and the
right one for this question.
61. (C). This picture represents the real, in spirit at least, Molly Pitcher. The other choices
aren’t even in the right time period; the three-cornered hats give away the time.
62. (E). Manifest Destiny was the idea that God intended for the U.S. to push westward to the
Pacific.
63. (A). If you remember that American exceptionalism is the philosophy behind Manifest
Destiny, you can eliminate (B) right away and zero in on (A), the choice that best corre-
sponds to the idea of Manifest Destiny (which you’ve already associated with American
exceptionalism).
64. (B). (B) is the most precise answer, which is a pretty decent indicator.
65. (A). Unless you’re going to be a lawyer, your mind can go blank when you see Cohens v.
Virginia. Carefully checking out the choices can turn the light back on.
66. (C). The U.S. wasn’t in the business of compromising with the American Indians, so you can
rule out (D). (B) and (E) don’t make much sense, either; of the two choices remaining, the
Mason-Dixon line is the most significant. In this case, it’s not the longest answer, but it’s the
best one.
67. (E). Europe wasn’t welcome to grab any more New World land.
68. (A). The Trail of Tears was ethnic cleansing for American Indians.
69. (D). The big voting news in Jacksonian democracy was that non-property-owning white men
finally got to vote, so (D) is your answer.
70. (B). The spoils system was campaign financing before big money — in return for a little pre-
election back-scratching, winning politicians gave their friends and influential supporters
cushy government jobs. Answer (B) is your best choice.
71. (A). Nullification was when a state would try to make a federal law null and void (not appli-
cable) within the nullifying state.
72. (B). Railroads started to be practical before the Civil War. In Andy Jackson’s time, canals
were still the happening thing.
73. (A). The humble steel plow changed American prairie grassland into one of the richest
agricultural areas in the world.
74. (E). Women began to get power just by running their own households. You can eliminate (B)
as being too early for women’s suffrage.
75. (B). Pay attention to the wording of the question: it asks for the most important answer,
which is that religion and social action were connected.
76. (D). (B) and (C) don’t seem terribly important. Of the choices left, “utopian communities”
seems to better describe groups with names like Brook Farm and New Harmony, and (D) is
the correct answer.

helps supply the clue.
78. (A). Ralph Waldo Emerson was Mr. Transcendentalism: the pivot point for separating per-
sonal spirituality from religious dogma.

documents in question provide for the phasing out of slavery, so you can rule out (B) and
home in on (A).

Section II: Free-Response Questions
The following essay points show sample information that you can organize for your practice
essays. Chapter 5 contains detailed guidance on how to write the DBQ response, and
Chapter 6 gives you the lowdown on tackling the regular essays. 
Part A: Document-Based Question
The DBQ asks you to discuss the changing nature of slavery and indentured servitude in rela-
tion to their evolution, economics, and crops. Here are some general PES facts on the subject
of servitude you may want to pull in to your essay:
 Before 1700, white indentured servants outnumbered black slaves.
 In the Chesapeake Bay area, indentured servants grew enough tobacco to increase
highly profitable exports of the smoking leaf from 1 million pounds in the 1630s to
40 million pounds in 1700.
 Three out of four English immigrants to this region in the 1700s were servants inden-
tured for around five years of service to pay for their passage.
 The headright system allowed anyone bringing in a laborer to get 50 acres of land per
imported worker — instant wealth. 
 Almost half of the white indentured servants died before they finished their term of
service.
 After 1700, more jobs in England made for fewer indentured servants.
 Plantation owners without indentured servants substituted black African slaves who
lived longer and worked until they died.
 At the time of the American Revolution, the U.S. was home to fewer than 1 million
slaves, mostly in the South.
 After the Revolution, Southern owners freed thousands of slaves, and all Northern
states ended slavery. The U.S. banned the importation of slaves in 1808.
 The cotton gin, invented in the late 1790s, made slavery hugely profitable. One slave
with a gin could do the work of 50 without; American cotton brought high prices from
newly mechanized cotton mills in the U.S. and Britain.
 Slaves cleared new land, and cotton land spread over much of the South, as did sugar
in Louisiana.
 By the time of the Civil War in 1860, the South was prosperous, with more than 4 mil-
lion slaves.
Material from at least some of the provided documents (like the points in the following list)
should appear with document letters in brackets in your DBQ essay.
 A: Shows slavery from the very first voyage of Columbus
 B: Shows that a majority of immigrants to the Middle South in the years just before the
Revolution were indentured English servants
 C: Demonstrates indentured arrangements
 D: Shows the agony of slavery for Africans at the time of the Revolution
 E: Letter relating wealth from cotton and reporting Negro sales alongside horses and
mules
315
Chapter 23: The Answers to Practice Test 1

 F: Reveals the complicity of Northern merchants in Southern slavery
 G: The often-reproduced symbol of the antislavery societies
 H: First-person report of slave driver cruelty
 I: Details the economics of slavery
 J: Emancipation of slaves, as imagined during the Civil War, with horrors of slavery
behind and benefits of freedom ahead
Part B and Part C
In this section, I provide you with an overview of some points you may want to include on
each of the essay choices in Parts B and C. You don’t have to have all of these points, but you
should have reasonable PES proof to support your thesis and analysis. See Chapter 6 for
more on regular essays.
2. Cultural background of colonies
National origins: The concentration of the English in New England, the majority non-English
(but still mostly English-speaking) population in central and Southern colonies, and national
origin differences can be overplayed: Both rock-ribbed New England farmers and Southern
planters were English. German farmers did well in the central states, and Dutch planters
added farming experience to central New York.
Religious beliefs: Protestants in New England, Catholics in Maryland and Rhode Island,
Church of England in the South. Quakers in Pennsylvania created a safe haven for American
Indians and other religions. German Lutherans and Scotch-Irish Presbyterians added 
religious diversity.
Ethnic background: Most early colonists were of northern European stock with African slaves
(and free Africans) accounting for almost 18 percent of the U.S. population by the time of the
Revolution. Within the European background of settlers, the Scotch-Irish folks tended to be
independent small farmers in mountainous regions, and German Americans often owned pro-
ductive farms in the central states.
Reasons for coming to America: New England reflected the reform and separatist beliefs of the
Puritans and Pilgrims who came to the colonies to found a pure society. Indentured servants
in the middle South came from desperate economic necessity and, when they survived, often
demanded better treatment from colonial rulers. Scotch-Irish settlers had faced oppression in
Northern Ireland; they didn’t put up with being pushed around in the New World. Together,
the colonists, with visions of freedom and chips on their shoulders, made a formidable con-
stituency for independence.
3. Charge that America bought freedom with slave labor before and after the Revolution
Economic development: The wealth of the South and some business profits of the North
depended on slavery by the time of the Civil War. However, the growth of the colonies up to
1700 centered mostly on individual and indentured English labor. The South managed to
recover and grow without slavery after the Civil War. At the time of the Revolution, 82 per-
cent of the population wasn’t in slavery. That free percentage actually increased as the Civil
War approached, and the growth of the country outstripped the growth of slavery. Initial
Revolutionary activity occurred in New England, which had few if any slaves. The U.S. would
have achieved freedom even without slaves.

Part V: Practice Makes Perfect: Two Tests Plus the Answers 

Political power: Slavery both retarded and advanced the political power of the United States.
The rich Southern slave-owning economy added to the wealth of the nation. On the other
hand, the escalating fight over slavery drained political resources. The South managed to
control much of the political life of the country due to the 3⁄5 rule that gave them partial repre-
sentation for all their nonvoting slaves.
Social beliefs: The unity of national purpose that began in the Second Great Awakening of the
1830s quickly dissipated as religious congregations split over slavery. Southerners had no
interest in labor issues or women’s rights and a complete hostility to the abolitionist move-
ment. Due to the fragmented, almost-feudal nature of Southern society, public education
failed to develop before the Civil War.
Behavioral changes: Although the North moved West, the South moved no further than the
Mississippi River bottom land where it could grow cotton and sugar cane with slave labor.
The Northern population soon greatly exceeded that of the South, and almost all industrial
development took place in the North. Even with the wealth from cotton, the South and slav-
ery were quickly losing ground to freedom. The U.S. got a financial boost from slavery, but it
became free despite slavery’s moral burden, not because of slave work’s extra profits.
4. How the federal government changed in the Jacksonian Era
Voting behavior: With the beginning of universal white male suffrage, voting and electioneer-
ing became national preoccupations. This shift attracted more involvement in government
policy and in polarizing issues like the Bank of the U.S. It also made American democracy
more real and less of the Enlightenment experiment that had frozen in the polite-but-sterile
confines of the Era of Good Feelings.
Policy regarding American Indians: Democracy is often less than idealistic when the eco-
nomic interests of the voters conflict with the rights of a minority. That’s what happened to
the American Indians under old fighter Andy Jackson. Jackson refused to follow a Supreme
Court decision favoring American Indian landowners, and he eventually set up their deporta-
tion to the West, opening up rich land for Southern settlers and slave owners.
States’ rights: Although Jackson’s American Indian policy helped the South, his insistence on
federal rule stopped in its tracks an early attempt at nullification by South Carolina (see
Chapter 11). Greater male voting led to polarization in states’-rights issues.
Federal power: Jackson increased federal power by fighting nullification and opposing the
independent economic clout of the Bank of the U.S. His was the first imperial presidency, and
although voting democracy increased, so did the power of the federal government.
5. North and South relationship changes
Missouri Compromise: Also known as the Compromise of 1820, the agreement admitted
Missouri as a slave state, balanced by Maine’s entrance as a free state. More importantly, the
compromise drew the Mason-Dixon line between slave and free states at the 36th parallel.
The agreement bought 30 years of peace between the states, but an aging Thomas Jefferson
wrote that the line would eventually tear the Union apart. He was right; attempts to extend
and modify the line between slave and free states led to disagreements and bloodshed that
led in turn to the Civil War.
Compromise of 1850: This compromise divided land taken from Mexico, admitted California
as a free state, allowed New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona to choose to be slave or free, and
established the Fugitive Slave law, which made all Americans legally obligated to help catch
runaway slaves even if the slaves escaped to free states. The Fugitive Slave law upset the free
317
Chapter 23: The Answers to Practice Test 1

states, and the uneconomical prospect of slaves on dry western land did nothing to help the
South. This compromise lasted only four years; its replacement (the Kansas-Nebraska Act)
was an even worse deal for the North.
Kansas-Nebraska Act: The 1854 legislation allowed both Kansas and Nebraska to decide
whether they wanted to be slave or free. Because Kansas and Nebraska were north of the
Mason-Dixon line, the Kansas-Nebraska Act effectively repealed the Missouri Compromise,
which would’ve designated the two new states as free. Throwing Kansas up in the air led to
armed competition between slave and free forces for control of the new state constitution.
Now the sides were killing each other on the field of attempted compromise. The Union’s
relationship was coming apart.
Dred Scott decision: The South had lost control of the Congress, but they still controlled the
Supreme Court. In this decision, the South sent freed slave Dred Scott back to slavery and
declared that no ruling body could make slavery illegal anywhere in the United States. The
Dred Scott decision invalidated all previous carefully-crafted compromises. The North had
gone beyond having a simple moral objection to slavery; with the Fugitive Slave law, the
battle over Kansas, and now the Dred Scott decision, many in the North felt that the South
was out to extend slavery all over the United States. The North suspected that what it called
the slave power would send slaves to take their jobs. What had started as a gentlemanly com-
promise in 1820 was degenerating into a street fight.

I think I’m well qualified to report that the Yank, 1943 version, is doing a good job in uphold-
ing the traditions of his father and his grandfather and all who came before him. His few
weaknesses are a source of pride rather than otherwise. He occasionally gets drunk, but
that’s because he loves his home and family and is terrifically lonely for both. He’s slow to
anger, but when he does get mad, he fights like hell. He’s quick to forgive — the picture of
him giving his candy ration to Italian kids is not a publicity gag. Sometimes he gets cheated,
but it’s because he has a deep faith in human nature. I think he’s the best there is.
We could have done very nicely without this war, but I do think it has given us a new sense 
of values which will go a long way in canceling any future wars.

Document C
Source: Letter from the front
First is the absolute futility of war. Seen at close range, it becomes so brutal and stupid that
we have to rub our eyes to believe the world is capable of it.
A second impression is the fundamental similarity of the peoples of the United Nations. I’ve
lived and worked with British, French, Australian, South African, New Zealand, Polish, and
Belgian soldiers to name a few. I’m convinced that we all seek the same general sort of life.
We criticize one another for our little individual eccentricities; each of us thinks his is the
best nation; but fundamentally we differ little. When this war is won, we must remember only
the fundamentals and get together in a big way.
A third impression is that of America’s own capabilities. London, Algiers, Paris, Rome,
Florence, Marseilles, and every other city and town in every liberated country teeming with
American traffic. Huge depots of American supplies, throngs of American men everywhere. If
we can put forth one half the effort for peace that we’ve extended in this war, because it was
necessary, there should never be need for another war. We must realize that peace, now, is
just as necessary as the war has been.
I’m now living in a half-wrecked miner’s house. There’s snow and there’s cold....

I wrote letters to servicemen on tissue-thin V-mail paper that folded into a self envelope. My
friends and I saved tinfoil from packages and crimped it around growing balls of foil to turn in
to help the war effort. Every week at school we purchased a ten-cent War Savings Stamp and
glued it into our war stamp book until we had enough to purchase an $18 War Bond which
matured years later for $25. Meat and gasoline were rationed and eggs were difficult to
obtain. No matter how much money you had you could only purchase the amounts for which
you had unused ration stamps. People walked, took public transportation, and car-pooled.
During air raid drills at elementary school we sat on the floor in the halls and sang patriotic

Food worst problem; costs up, but pay up more
There may not be the abundance of food at home today that there was a year ago, but there
is plenty to go around and although prices have risen wages have gone ahead of them.
Machinery already is in motion, both governmental and private, to see that men get jobs as
soon as they take off their uniforms.
People are eating differently, that’s all: less meat and more of other items. Restaurants have
introduced meatless days; the Waldorf in New York, for instance, has three a week. Except 
for shoes — which are limited to three pairs a year for each person — clothes rationing is
not in sight. Candy is still plentiful, and the guy with a thirst still can slake it with all the beer
he wants.
Whatever complaints are heard are directed mostly at the lack of gasoline. With one car to
every four and a half people, Americans had all but forgotten how to walk. Now they’re
obliged to learn all over again. The Government is strict about the ban on pleasure driving.
Agents check the race tracks and baseball stadiums for cars, and even the vicinity of movie
houses. The only large-scale chiseling evident has been the black market in food, which the
Government is taking drastic steps to wipe out.

Section I: Multiple-Choice
1. (B). It’s the cotton. But, as it turned out, Britain was willing to go without a few shirts to
avoid helping slavery.
2. (B). They were fighting for their Southern white pride against the Yankees.
3. (A). Hatred and fear of the slave power overcame the profit motive.
4. (B). Slaves sometimes fought against an overwhelmingly brutal system.
5. (C). If you don’t know about Uncle Tom’s Cabin, maybe you haven’t been paying close
enough attention. The other answers are smart-aleck choices.
6. (B). The Spanish were all about finding gold, but they never looked along the American
River in their former possession of California.
7. (C). Popular sovereignty actually means that the people rule, but the most important issue
folks were arguing about before the Civil War was to keep or free slaves.
8. (D). With the Fugitive Slave Act, the North had to help the South recapture slaves, some-
thing most of the North hated.
9. (A). John Brown was an extremely militant abolitionist, certainly no compromiser or 
diplomat.
10. (B). This is an example of a wrong trend question. In wrong trend questions, all of the
answers except the correct one follow one pattern. Because only one answer can be right, if
you can find one choice that shows a different trend, it’s often correct. Of course, you have
to know something about history to spot a wrong trend.
11. (A). Buchanan may have done better not to show up at all.
12. (C). Lincoln barely slipped into office.
13. (D). This is an example of a question you can logic out. Toss out the unimportant choices:
musicals, train races, TV. That leaves airplanes and ships, which gives you a pretty good
shot at guessing correctly even if you don’t remember the Monitor and the Merrimack.
14. (D). Sometimes it’s important to stand for principle.

15. (A). Gettysburg is one of the most famous battles in the Civil War, largely because the
North’s victory was a huge turning point in the conflict.
16. (A). It took a lot of deaths to free the slaves.
17. (A). A labor leader opposes fortunes that rob workers.
18. (A). Answers (C), (D), and (E) are from the wrong time period, and the North never asked
that the South pay it back. That leaves (A).
19. (E). Tough cowboys were nice to women.
20. (E). Borderline-smart-aleck wrong answers: the freed slaves never made great economic
progress, no one had landslide victories in the late 1800s, and completely honest govern-
ment was rare.
21. (D). Withdrawing the federal troops that were protecting the blacks was the deal the
Republicans made to hang on to power.
22. (D). When occupying troops withdraw, the people they’ve been protecting suffer.
23. (D). If you like the eight-hour workday, thank the unions.
24. (E). Most scientists, religious organizations, and Christians accepted Darwin’s theory as just
another way God may work in the world. A minority became upset and believed Darwin’s
theory threatened their faith.
25. (B). Land in the West wasn’t cheap or easy to work.
26. (D). The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured individual deposits and gave
people the confidence to leave their money in the bank.
27. (B). Jim Crow was the name of a popular minstrel character. The Jim Crow laws restricted
the rights of black people.
28. (A). The Pendleton Act cleaned up most corruption in government hiring, leaving only
fundraising as a form of shady influence.
29. (C). The Populists never won a battle, but they eventually won the war.
30. (B). The industrial states were doing very well financially, thank you.
31. (D). You need to know basic background information about minorities.
32. (D). You also need to know the high points of the women’s rights movement.
33. (E). It took 400 years from the landing of Columbus until the last American Indians lost their
right to roam a natural world.
34. (E). The Americans finished settling the West around 1890.
35. (D). The U.S. saw how much fun England was having and wanted some of the world for
itself. The Spanish-American War was America’s attempt to build a small empire and “save”
Spanish colonies by taking them over.
36. (B). It was a business agreement that the Hawaiians didn’t fight.
37. (D). Like lots of people, these leaders thought loving freedom and building empires didn’t
work together.
38. (C). These struggles and a lot more started in the 1960s. Note that this question is out of
chronological order; the real AP will have the multiple-choice time periods completely
scrambled.
39. (B). Teddy Roosevelt was a Progressive Republican.
40. (B). Teddy said that the U.S. would keep Latin America tidy — no Europeans allowed.
41. (C). Women and working people never gave up.
342

56. (C). Hoover never met a business he didn’t like.
57. (A). FDR was the real deal, and that meant a New Deal.
58. (C). If an agency has as an acronym, chances are fair it started with FDR.
59. (C). You don’t need to be a culture vulture, but you should know the literary milestones.
60. (E). Despite early Republican efforts to kill it, Social Security is still very much part of the
plans of most elderly people.

supplies in World War II.

Section II: Free-Response Questions
The following sections give you sample information that you can utilize for your practice
essays. Chapter 5 contains detailed guidance on how to write the DBQ response, and
Chapter 6 gives you the lowdown on tackling the regular essays.
Part A: Document-Based Question
The DBQ asks you to discuss how WWII changed American life socially, economically, and
politically. The following list gives you some sample PES facts you may want to include in
your essay:
 When World War II started, civilian industry changed to wartime production.
 Standardization of wartime production led to more job opportunities for less-skilled
workers.
 With more work available, consumer spending went up 20 percent even though produc-
tion was down.
 People had to have ration coupons and money to buy most commodities. Gas limits
were three gallons per week.
 War production was half of the economy. The U.S. outproduced all of its enemies put
together.
 By the end of the war, everybody was paying federal income tax. Before the war, only
10 percent of the people paid the tax.
 Mexican workers replaced farmers off to war. Women replaced men on the assembly
lines.
 Pay went up; unions organized but mostly didn’t strike. The CIO fought racism and
sexism in union ranks.
 World War II ended the Depression, and almost everybody had a job
 Women worked as Rosie the Riveter in wartime industry and as government girls in fed-
eral agencies.
 A baby boom started right after the war; births went up by 30 percent.
 The federal Fair Employment Practices Committee was the most important aid up to
that time for fair treatment of blacks and women on the job.

 Over 120,000 Japanese Americans were interned in camps.
 Celebrities from Humphrey Bogart to Donald Duck supported the war effort.
 The United States was really united to fight the good war.
Material (such as the following points) from at least some of the provided documents should
show up in your DBQ essay, with the document letters in brackets. 
 A: Starting at an equalized norm, the chart shows how the war benefited un-bombed
U.S. consumers but hurt their enemies.
 B: This document shows new internationalism.
 C: Internationalism and the U.S. were in the world to stay.
 D: This poster shows the threat to U.S. families from the Nazis. The solution to this
threat was to buy War Bonds to help finance the war effort.
 E: Japanese internment camps were all over the West, showing lingering suspicion of
foreigners.
 F: Careful living on the home front meant the whole country was working together to
support the armed forces in the field.
 G: This poster shows the allies working together as a powerful cannon blasting the enemy.
 H: This document shows home front sacrifices but also optimism that problems are
solvable.
 I: Wounds would slowly heal, and opportunities grew with victory.
 J: The GI Bill and changes in the economy in general were a tremendous boost for get-
ting ahead in the new postwar United States.
Part B and Part C
In this section, I outline some points you may want to include in your essays over the
prompts in Parts B and C. You don’t have to use all of these specific points, but make sure
you have reasonable PES proof to support your thesis and analysis.
2. Changes from the 1890s to the 1910s
Public opinion: Literacy improved, and for the first time the public started to have informed
opinions based on widespread reading. Newspapers and magazines in the 1900s started to
feature muckraker exposés of scandals in housing, government, and food manufacturing.
Business: Teddy Roosevelt and the presidents who followed him broke up big businesses
that used their corporate power to cheat consumers. Businesses continued to expand on the
strength of product innovation rather than pure power. Some big businessmen like Andrew
Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller gave money for the public good.
Environment: With the frontier closed, Teddy Roosevelt began the creation of a national
system of public parks that became the model for the U.S. and the world.
International policy: The U.S. asserted itself more in world affairs as the 1890s drew to a
close, with the Spanish-American War and increased U.S. interests in Asia.

3. U.S. participation in World War I
Military outcomes: The U.S. got to France just in time to keep the Germans from winning.
Although only small numbers of U.S. troops got into the fighting, they encouraged the Allies
and discouraged the Germans into surrendering. Because no international policing organiza-
tion existed, the Germans rearmed for World War II.
Impact on the United States: Despite President Wilson’s idealistic 14 Points program for
world peace, the U.S. withdrew into its isolationist shell after the war. Politicians refused to
support Wilson’s plan for the League of Nations. The U.S. had been a hero, but came away
more determined than ever to stick to its own business.
Impact on other countries: Britain and France were so worn out that they were willing to sell
out most of Europe to Germany to avoid another war. Russia’s defeat in World War I paved
the way for a Communist government. Hitler rose to save an impoverished Germany, which
thought it had been stabbed in the back by giving up in World War I just when it had almost
won. World War II was really World War I with a recess.
International trade: The U.S. never got paid for supplies sent to the Allies in World War I.
When the U.S. economy collapsed at the end of the 1920s, the country slapped a record-high
tariff on trade, which shut off any chance of working together with other nations to solve
world economic problems.
4. Causes and effects of the Great Depression
1924 through 1929: Conservative Republican presidents let business do what it wanted. The
stock market boomed; no one could see an end in sight for the new U.S. economy, which was
based on consumer debt and high consumer spending. Republicans raised the tariff, making
products more expensive. When the stock market crashed on Black Tuesday in 1929, it was
the end of a long, profitable ride.
1930 through 1934: Republican President Hoover’s response to the crash was the Smoot-
Hawley Tariff, the highest peacetime import taxes in U.S. history. Unemployment went from 
9 percent in 1930 to 16 percent in 1931 and 25 percent in 1933. Following Republican trickle-
down theory, Hoover started the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which opponents
called the millionaires’ welfare. Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt took over in 1933
and started passing New Deal programs to help ordinary people.
1935 through 1939: New Deal programs like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the
Civilian Conservation Corps, the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, and the Works
Administrations started to create jobs and restore hope. Other federal initiatives included
TVA, FHA, SEC, NRA, and AAA. The greatest benefit for elderly people was the passage of
Social Security in 1935.
1940 through 1945: New Deal programs cut unemployment in half from 25 percent to 12 per-
cent. World War II took care of the rest of the Great Depression — by 1943, unemployment
was almost nonexistent. Due in part to the economic safety net built by the Roosevelt admin-
istration, the U.S. came out of the War ready for further growth.
5. Conservative presidents take Progressive steps
Dwight Eisenhower: Eisenhower reluctantly used federal troops to enforce the school inte-
gration called for by Brown v. Board of Education. He set up a Civil Rights Commission to
investigate discrimination. Eisenhower started the nationwide interstate highway system.
Upon leaving office, he warned against the growing power of the military-industrial complex.

Richard Nixon: Nixon expanded welfare, Medicaid for the poor, and food stamps for the
hungry. He created a new Supplemental Security Income program (SSI) for the disabled.
Nixon started the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Act, and the Endangered
Species Act.
Ronald Reagan: Reagan helped end the Cold War by continuing the long-established policies
of opposition to Communist expansion that had been popular with both Democratic and
Republican presidents before him. Reagan’s tax cuts benefited the rich and didn’t help the
economy. He appointed the first woman to the Supreme Court and remained sunny and opti-
mistic in troubled times.
George H. W. Bush: The elder Bush was president when the Berlin Wall fell, signaling the end
of Communism as a major movement. He signed the START II treaty to limit nuclear weapons.
Bush successfully kicked the invading Iraqis out of neighboring Kuwait but left Saddam
Hussein in power. He also signed the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibited dis-
crimination against the disabled.

O
bviously, the AP Test Inquisitors want you to know the grand picture of U.S. history,
but every history picture consists of little pixels usually known as facts. Trends are
important, but events are the proof that trends have arrived, the champagne-cork pop after
years of social and economic ferment. Chapters 7 through 21 give you all the gory details
that may crop up on the test, but here I give you a quick rundown and reminder of all the
main events that contain those details.
Obviously you don’t want to go confusing Andrew Jackson with Michael Jackson. Beyond
that, you’d be wise to have the big events in order, complete with a few fun facts to drop into
essays and use as a shield to avoid picking a bonehead multiple choice. Refer to this chapter
often if you need to brush-up on which event happened when.
Next Stop, America: Setting Up the Colonies
It wasn’t just “let’s get a bunch of immigrants together and play house.” Putting together 
the American colonies took time, effort, and some often-desperate action. The time from
Columbus to the Revolution is almost 100 years longer than the time that has passed from
the Revolution until now. Here’s the sequence of events you need to remember from this
period:
 The American Indians were doing just fine, thank you, without all that European culture
for 10,000 years before Columbus. You get a pass on most of those 10,000 years because
the New World Indians were too busy inventing the Aztec, Mayan, and Incan empires in
Mesoamerica to write much down.
 The Spanish jaunted around Mexico and south looking for treasure and setting up
colonies in the 1500s.
 By 1607, the British got around to founding Jamestown; the Pilgrims got blown off
course and started New England a few years later. It was no party; half the colonists at
both Jamestown and Plymouth died in the first six months.

 The colonists got early help from the American Indians:
• The Pilgrims were greeted by Tisquantum, an American Indian they called
Squanto, who incredibly enough had already been to Europe twice with passing
explorers and spoke fluent English. Tisquantum (1621) taught the Pilgrims how to
catch fish and build warmer houses.
• In Jamestown, the settlers had the help of Pocahontas, who not only brought
food but also actually married Englishman John Rolfe. The wives of Presidents
Woodrow Wilson and Ronald Reagan were her descendents.
• The American Indians shared gold, silver, potatoes, tomatoes, corn, squash, and
tobacco — products that helped Europe become rich and powerful after their dis-
covery of the New World.
 When the American Indians realized that the Europeans were more like hungry wolves
than friendly dogs, they fought back in the mid-1600s. Too late; the colonists managed
to hang on through King Philip’s War (1675) in New England and similar battles in
Virginia and New York.
Colonizing for Fun and Profit
Having an understandably short sense of humor about having their land taken away, the
American Indians kept fighting when they could against increasingly overwhelming odds for
another 200 years. With native attacks on the back burner during the late 1600s, colonies
started popping up all along the Atlantic coast. You need to know details about the earliest
(not all 13) colonies:
 Massachusetts was home to the Pilgrims and Puritans who came for religious freedom
for themselves, but kicked out spirit-filled freethinkers like Roger Williams and Anne
Hutchinson.
 Roger Williams then went on to found the tolerant, freethinking colony of Rhode Island.
 Maryland was a haven for Catholics, but Protestants were welcome too. Maybe too wel-
come, because Protestants in some Maryland towns burned Catholic churches. It took
years, but toleration made a comeback.
 William Penn founded Pennsylvania on freedom for everybody and fair treatment of the
American Indians. Modest William was a little embarrassed that the king named the
whole woodland or silvania for Penn, but that didn’t stop him from founding the city of
Philadelphia (brotherly love) or proposing a uniting of the colonial states and even a
European union. Outside of New England, most colonists came from places other than
England like Scotland, Germany, and Wales.
 Meanwhile, Virginia prospered with slaves and tobacco. Pocahontas’ husband John
Rolfe got the business rolling by growing good leaf at Jamestown, and despite a warn-
ing from King James himself that smoking was “dangerous to the Lungs,” tobacco
proved to be an addictive money-maker. Big tobacco bucks got the Southern colonies
addicted to slavery.
By 1700, the American colonies held about 300,000 people; 25,000 of them were slaves. The
first Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1740s lead to more religious devotion and communica-
tion between settlements. Talk turned toward freedom, covered in the next section.
352
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Getting Ready for a Revolution
By the 1760s, the 13 colonies were almost 2 million people strong and feeling like big dudes.
They’d helped the regular army from back home in Britain kick some French and American
Indian butt in the war by that same name that ended in 1763. Now it seemed time for some
nice new land over the mountains.
Oh, wait a minute; the British Parliament had just declared that land closed to settlement in
the Proclamation of 1763. Well, at least they could play cards. Oops, no again: Parliament had
put the Stamp Act of 1765 on cards, documents, and even newspapers. How about some tea?
Nope, Parliament was messing with the tea prices to favor their own investors. America may
have put up with King George’s bad wigs and wacky behavior, but in this dark time before
coffee shops on every corner, they weren’t going to put up with no tea. Who did these
Parliament guys think they were?
The Boston Tea Party was a fun answer to British lawmaking without Colonial representation.
Colonists thinly disguised as American Indians boarded three British ships and efficiently
dumped 45 tons of tea overboard, turning Boston harbor into the world’s biggest teapot.
They didn’t damage the ships, but tea washed up on shore for weeks. That gave Parliament
something to think about. Even better, another tea ship ran aground at Provincetown. The
tea was quickly liberated and reached Boston tea cups within days. What could be better
than boycotting tea and getting to drink it anyway?
Parliament then passed the Intolerable Acts in 1774 to punish the citizens of Boston by clos-
ing down their vital harbor. The British surged in a lot more troops and push came to shove
at Lexington and Concord. Colonial minutemen responded to what the British called an
antiterrorist sweep by shooting up British regulars. Because everybody was fighting anyway,
the young and determined Congress had 33-year-old Thomas Jefferson write the Declaration
of Independence in 1776. After the battle of Saratoga proved that the backwoods Americans
could beat the British army, the French happily piled on to fight their traditional British foes.
George Washington never won a major battle, but he stayed in the field for six long years,
usually without proper supplies or political support and with a desertion rate of 20 percent
per year.
Finally the British decided to take a break from the conflict near the lovely seashore in
Yorktown under the protective guns of their mighty navy. Surprise, the British navy wasn’t
there, and the French and Americans got the British cornered. Washington finally got the big
win he deserved, and it was time for peace and independence.
U.S. Lite: The Confederation Leads 
to a Keeper Constitution
The United States complained and revolted against British rule, but what to do about their
own government? The first try was the Articles of Confederation in 1777 (not to be confused
with the Robert E. Lee-type Confederacy — that came along 84 years later with the Civil
War). The Articles called for more voluntary cooperation than most people can muster. The
federal government had to politely ask the states for money because it had no power to tax
353
Chapter 26: Ten Monster Events the AP Wants You to Know

on its own. Each state got one vote in Congress, and it took 9 of the 13 votes to pass any
laws. With this weak government, the organization of the territory from Ohio north and west
under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 is amazing.
In the same year, with much wrangling and a few drinks, Congress produced the U.S.
Constitution, under which the nation is still governed. Drinking didn’t get in the way of politi-
cal progress. At that time, the average U.S. male had about 600 drinks a year — the first thing
most of the Congressmen did after they passed the Constitution was to adjourn to the near-
est tavern. A few years later, President Washington and Alexander Hamilton personally led a
large army into Pennsylvania to put down the Whiskey Rebellion — not to get rid of whiskey,
but to try to enforce a tax on this popular form of booze. Somehow, the nation sobered up
enough to get organized.
The addition of the Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to the Constitution) in 1791
strengthened the Constitution even further. Since then, the U.S. has made only 17 additional
Amendment changes in more than 200 years. It took years of tough debate and friendly drink-
ing to finish the original Constitution, but the results have lasted longer than any barroom
promise in history.
Andy Jackson, Democracy, 
and Manifest Destiny
Although plenty of drinking and tobacco-chewing went on in the early 1800s, politics was
more of a gentlemen’s game. The nation had been through an early attack on civil liberties in
the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 and was settling down to enjoy its freedom.
European powers provided pesky challenges that resulted in the War of 1812, but for the
most part the new United States was an increasingly prosperous one-party country. The time
from 1815 to 1824 was even called the Era of Good Feelings.
Early 1800s U.S. democracy had one little catch: Only white males who owned a house or a
farm could vote. Even people who could vote didn’t always bother; many figured the system
would take care of itself.
All that changed with the contested election of John Quincy Adams in 1824. This was the first
election in which all white males in most states got to vote whether they owned property or
not. In a four-way race, war hero Andrew Jackson got the most votes, but John Quincy
Adams got to be President because he made a deal with the other losers. That ticked off
Jackson and his many followers, and they came back in force for the next election.
Jackson was president for eight years, and the several of the subsequent presidents —
Martin Van Buren, John Tyler, and James Polk — were all Jackson followers.
Jacksonian democracy meant the end of rich guys controlling a central Bank of the United
States. It also meant moving the American Indians out to make way for Manifest Destiny and
westward expansion. Jackson invited ordinary people to be part of government, rewarding
his friends with government jobs (through the spoils system) and pushing for full democracy
for everyone (as long as they were white males). Jackson kept the government out of busi-
ness because he thought that most of the time the government just ended up helping rich
people.

My Rules or I’m Leaving: The Long 
Prequel to the Civil War
The amazing thing wasn’t that the United States eventually became temporarily disunited by
the Civil War; it was that the slavery time bomb took so long to blow up. The U.S. abolished
the importation of slaves in 1808, only a few months after Britain’s moral conversion, which
was portrayed in the film Amazing Grace. All northern U.S. states and a surprising number of
southern plantation owners freed their slaves after the Revolution.
However, the invention of the cotton gin made slavery so profitable that it spread throughout
the South in the first half of the 1800s, despite the intention of many of the Revolutionary
Founding Fathers to bring it to an early end. North and South then started a long stretch of
legal wrangling over slavery:
 The first major bills passed under the early Confederation outlawed slavery in the new
Northwest Ordinance of 1787.
 The Missouri Compromise, also known as the Compromise of 1820, drew the Mason-
Dixon line between slave and free states; the Compromise of 1850 later extended the
Mason-Dixon line out west.
 The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 weakened the earlier compromises, and the 1857
Dred Scott decision by the Southern-controlled Supreme Court blew all the compro-
mises away.
While the South got rich from slavery, the years of compromise had given the North time to
get industrialized and relatively united in opposition to slavery. With the election of Abe
Lincoln in 1860, it was showdown time.
If you’d been dropped into a random house in the United States in 1860, you’d have had
about a 1 in 12 chance of being in a slave owning family. Of course, all the slave holding fami-
lies were down South; if you had dropped into a random life in the South, you’d have had a
one in three chance of being a slave. Slaves never got paid, worked from dawn to dusk, and
could be whipped, sexually exploited, or even killed at the whim of their owners.
Eventually, people who weren’t making money off the work of slaves (and even a few people
who were) couldn’t stand to see the evil system continue. The United States fought through
the most horrible war in its history to get honest with the proposition that “all men are cre-
ated equal.”
America Fighting Itself: Civil War Basics
When the compromises fell apart in the late 1850s, the South struck with the Dred Scott deci-
sion, essentially allowing slavery anywhere in the United States. The North had been reading
Uncle Tom’s Cabin and for the first time had a pretty good picture of just how medieval
Southern slavery could be.
Plus, the North was all uptight that the South may just march north with a factory’s worth 
of slaves and take the North’s paid jobs away. The South was worried that John Brown’s
botched raid on Harpers Ferry was the beginning of a North-sponsored slave rebellion.

Chapter 26: Ten Monster Events the AP Wants You to Know

Neither of these situations would have happened, but a little paranoia about the other side is
a traditional prelude to wars.
When Lincoln was elected, he had to sneak into Washington to become president. The train
bringing him from his home in Illinois went through Maryland, a hotbed of Southern sympa-
thy. The fear that someone would assassinate him before he ever took the oath of office 
was real.
The Southern states said “we’re leaving” and took over most of the federal forts in the South,
but Lincoln wouldn’t give up Fort Sumter, so the South started shooting. Lincoln was in a
tight spot — Southern troops were nearing Washington, and all he had to defend him were a
few ceremonial units including the Army band. Lincoln paced the top of Washington’s hastily
erected fortifications hoping to see reinforcements coming from the north. He even went to
the Library of Congress and took out books on how to fight a war.
When the North got an army together, it didn’t do them much good at first. The South won
most of the battles, fighting on their own territory with good generals. The North barely man-
aged to turn back two Southern invasions, first at the Battle of Antietam and then at the
Battle of Gettysburg. That was enough.
Even though the North was fighting for principle (one of the only times in history when an
army has fought to free somebody else) while the South was fighting for its own land and
slave property (usually worth three to one in fighting morale), the North’s determination
through four long years of war won the day.
The United States Becomes a Big Dog
With the close of the Civil War in 1865, the U.S. was minus the free help of 4 million slaves 
but plus a determination to expand all across the continent and beyond. For the rest of the
1800s, mostly Republican presidents rode out economic downturns and political scandals
while the U.S. economy steadily caught up with the world’s only international superpower:
Great Britain.
The U.S. got some technological breaks by inventing most of the useful gadgets in the late
1800s: the electric light, telephone, and mechanical harvester, to name a few. Not held back
by the need to support a large military or defend an empire, the U.S. poured all its capital
into growth.
Because slavery was no longer an issue, new states got created as soon as they had the pop-
ulation to support a government. San Francisco was well established as the Queen of the
Pacific, supported by both California gold and Nevada silver. Railroads spanned the conti-
nent, the longest creation of mankind since the Great Wall of China. Ironically, much of the
western railroad was built by imported Chinese labor.
By the time the 1900s neared, the U.S. was starting to cast a hungry eye overseas for more
territory. The country had bought Alaska from the Russians, stolen the Southwest from
Mexico, and settled out the Northwest with the British. The Hawaiian Islands fell like an
unguarded flower into Yankee hands. In 1898, the U.S. fought the weak colonial power of
Spain to take away Cuba and the far-off Philippines. President Teddy Roosevelt sent the fleet
parading around the world. The United States had the glory; coming up next would be the
burden of being a world power.
356
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

The Reluctant Dragon: U.S. as World Power
The U.S. entered the 1900s with an empire, sort of, and enough military power to scare away
other nations from attacking the New World. Most of the United States wanted to mind its
own business, but other nations were building up fleets and armies and trolling for empire.
When World War I broke out in Europe in 1914, the United States stayed neutral. That was
hard to do, because the British had been mother country to the U.S., and the French had
helped the U.S. free itself. They were fighting together against Germany and clearly needed
help. Even worse, ships carrying Americans kept getting sunk by German submarines, and
the Germans even hatched a crazy plot to take over Mexico. After three years of neutrality,
the U.S. finally pitched in the war on the side of the Allies.
It didn’t really take much fighting, but the U.S. tipped the balance, and the Allies defeated
Germany in what turned out to be Round One of a two-round world war; Round Two (World
War II) came later.
U.S. President Wilson had great plans for making a fair peace guaranteed by an international
League of Nations that could keep future wars from developing. Oops, Congressional Republi-
cans wouldn’t go along with letting the United States help guard the peace. So, after what
amounted to a 21-year truce to make more weapons, the major nations (including the United
States) plunged into an even more destructive World War II.
This time the reluctant dragon U.S. sat behind its oceans for two years before being awak-
ened by a punch in the nose from Japan. Although the U.S. lost only 2 percent of the people
that Russia did fighting World War II, it was enough to convince the country to stay active in
world affairs and try to preserve the peace in the future.
U.S. Government as Guardian of the People
Although the U.S. got into the social welfare game after many European countries, the nation
has been steadily developing services for its people for over 100 years. Public education
grew rapidly after the Civil War. At the end of that conflict, the U.S. had fewer than 100 high
schools in the whole country.
By the end of World War I, most towns in the U.S. had schools, and almost all children had at
least some high-school education. College was for only a small minority of the elite before
World War II. After that time, the GI Bill and the growth of state colleges and universities
meant that by the 2000s, most U.S. citizens had the opportunity to get at least some college
education.
The watershed for social programs was the Great Depression of the 1930s. As the Depression
got worse and people stood in line for bread to feed their children, Republican President
Hoover actually said that although the people helped the government, the government
shouldn’t help the people. The people soon voted him out of office, and Franklin Delano
Roosevelt (FDR) took over for the longest presidency in U.S. history.
FDR started a lot of social programs that are still active today, including Social Security, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the
Federal Housing Authority.

President Johnson added Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s and President Nixon supported
disability insurance in the 1970s. President Clinton expanded aid to education in the 1990s
and President George W. Bush added a prescription drug benefit to Medicare in the 2000s.
With its history of rugged individualism and free enterprise, the U.S. was slower to adopt
social programs than many other countries, but eventually the nation began to recognize
that services like police, education, and fire protection were more efficient if they were
bought “in bulk” by the whole community.

Ten Important Social and Economic
Issues in U.S. History
In This Chapter
 Picking up on the big trends in U.S. history
 Understanding how social and economic forces provide stability
 Seeing how change infiltrates the established social structure
T
he AP test pays special attention to social and economic trends. These trends both keep
society the same and allow room for change.
If you don’t think social and economic issues matter, take a look at your friends. Most of
them probably come from the same basic social and economic background you do. The
United States is the largest, most diverse multiethnic and multiracial society in history, but
every one of the U.S. presidents up to 2008 have been a white male, and all but one have
been white male Protestants. Economic and social structures tend to keep society the same.
Despite established structures, change happens. In the 1800s, people usually worked 10, 12,
or even 14 hours a day. Today, if your boss forced you to work more than eight hours a day
without special pay, he’d be breaking the law. In 1950, most Southern restaurants, hotels, and
movie theaters didn’t allow blacks to even come in the door. Now this behavior would get
them in serious trouble and insult all their customers. In 1916, how much a woman cared
about politics was irrelevant; in most of the United States, she couldn’t even vote. Now
women are in office everywhere. Trends show how society changes.
Economic and social trends are an important part of the big AP test. Here are ten of the most
important.
Establishing U.S. Diversity
The United States is the most diverse country in the world today, but it was already that way
at the time of the Revolution. Diversity helped to build understanding and bring new ideas to
the U.S. Every major country in the world has contributed citizens to the United States. The
Germans, Irish, Chinese, Polish, Japanese, and Africans have all taken turns being discrimi-
nated against and finally celebrated as part of the American experience.
Ethnic discrimination isn’t quite over in the United States, but it raises its ugly head less in
this country than in any place else on earth. The U.S. actually maintains a diversity visa,
which provides a worldwide lottery for 50,000 people from countries that haven’t sent many
new citizens to the U.S. The people who win the drawing get to live in the United States. More
than 7 million hopeful immigrants apply every year.

Defining the American Identity
What does it mean to be an American, a full citizen of the United States?
Along with diversity, the meaning of American Identity has changed through the years. Right
after the Revolution, the Naturalization Act increased the time an immigrant had to wait 
to become a citizen from 5 to 14 long years in an attempt to limit American citizenship to
only those who were born in the country. This long wait ended soon after Jefferson became
president when the Alien and Sedition Acts were largely repealed in 1802.
The Know-Nothing Party (1855) briefly elected mayors in Boston, Philadelphia, and San
Francisco on a platform of allowing only native-born Protestants to hold office. They had to
say they knew nothing when asked because their movement was something of a guilty
secret. The platform of the Know-Nothings quickly faded, and most of them joined the
Republican Party and fought against slavery.
The 1950s saw an anti-Communist scare that tried to define real Americans as those who sup-
ported repression of certain political opinions. This behavior was so out of line with the
beliefs on which the U.S. was founded that, after a few years without a Communist invasion,
even rabid anti-Communists were ashamed of these tactics.
American identity has grown with the country and increasingly represents a bridge anyone
can walk across if they believe in freedom.
Creating American Culture
Culture sounds like fat ladies at the opera, but it’s really the sum total of all the stories, songs,
and ways of living that are important to people in any given time and place. Americans have
made culture, and it has also made them. In the colonial period, religious notions of creating
the perfect home for a particular religion inspired some settlers to come to America. Move-
ments like the First Great Awakening showed people from different denominations and settle-
ments that they shared a common emotional response to God. Culture brings people together
by helping them get a broader picture of their place in the world.
Reaction to pressure from the French and the American Indians as well as British authorities
built up the idea in American culture of the rough-and-ready frontiersman shown in The 
Last of the Mohicans and in the image of the Minuteman with his rifle and plow. During the
Revolution, patriots made it a point of honor to sing “Yankee Doodle Dandy,” a song origi-
nally intended to mock their backwoods pretensions to civilization:
Yankee Doodle went to town, a-riding on a pony,
stuck a feather in his cap, and called it macaroni.
Yankee Doodle was a derogatory name the British used to describe what they believed to be
the silly, rustic colonists who thought going to town was the most exciting event of the year.
A-riding is Scotch-Irish slang and also probably used derogatorily; the fact that Yankee
Doodle rides a pony probably implies that he can’t afford an actual horse. Similarly, he can’t
afford a fancy European hat, so he sticks a feather in his old three-cornered hat and calls it
macaroni in hopes of associating it with high French and Italian fashion.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

American culture may not have been fancy, but it was effective. Uncle Tom’s Cabin helped
ignite the Civil War. Books like The Jungle, written by muckrakers trying to prevent corruption
from being swept under the rug, built support for progressive reform. Women’s clubs helped
get the vote for females and contributed to the freedom of blacks and the spread of public
education. The image of Uncle Sam updated the backwoods Yankee Doodle Dandy to a kindly
uncle — dressed in the American flag — who knew the right (patriotic) thing to do.
Demographics
The United States at the time of the Revolution was a country of young people. Without a
hereditary aristocracy, the 2.5 million scattered settlers, mostly farmers, who made up the
country at the time of the Revolution, relied on whoever had the energy to get the job done.
Jefferson was only 33 when he wrote the Declaration of Independence, and Washington was
43 when he took command of the Continental Army. The 56 delegates to the Continental
Congress weren’t the richest men in America; those people mostly stayed loyal to the King.
The early Congressmen in 1775 showed how mobile people in America already were — more
than a quarter of them had lived in two or more states.
At the time of the Revolution, about 60 percent of the Americans were from England with the
next biggest groups being African slaves at 15 percent, the Scotch-Irish at 8 percent, and
Germans at 7 percent. The California Gold Rush of 1849 populated the West Coast almost
overnight with the first 100,000 Americans settlers. The average American lived longer at the
time of the Revolution than they did during early heavy industrialization a hundred years
later in 1890.
As the U.S. developed, the percent of residents who had been born in other countries grew
from 1 percent in 1810 to almost 10 percent before the Civil War. This jump had an unsettling
effect (which I discuss in Chapter 24), but it also provided manpower for the North in the
conflict with the South. Bad harvests and revolutionary unrest drove people out of Europe,
and family ties with earlier immigrants pulled them in to the U.S.
Economics
The U.S. moved from being a prosperous-but-small farming nation at the time of the
Revolution to the dominant international economic power with a quarter of the world’s
money in the early 2000s. Early colonies didn’t work out as investments for absentee British
investors, who subsequently turned them over to the people who lived there. Colonists
learned to support themselves quite well; by the time of the Revolution, average American
living standards were better than the ones in England. That gave them something to fight for.
Between 1920 and 1985, the U.S. lived through three depressions and six recessions lasting a
total of 12 years during that 65-year period. With minor recessions, the U.S. economy was
growing about 75 percent of the time and in decline about 25 percent of the time in the 1900s.
The Great Depression of the 1930s was by far the worst, lasting almost six years with a down-
turn continuing until World War II. 
Although the United States has experienced bad economic times, its general growth has been
consistently good through the end of slavery, the Industrial Revolution, and the postindus-
trial information society.

Chapter 27: Ten Important Social and Economic Issues in U.S. History

Women’s Rights
Even though they made up more than half of the population of the colonies at the time of the
Revolution, women exercised just about zero percent of the direct political power. They did
have social and economic influence, which are evident in the letter in which Abigail Adams
asks her Founding-Father husband, future second President John Adams, to “remember the
ladies” when proposing rights for the new nation.
Women got their first higher education in the 1830s and began to get together at gatherings of
the Second Great Awakening. The Seneca Falls Conference of 1848 started the women’s move-
ment. Women put their own cause on hold to campaign for the abolition of slavery before the
Civil War. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, feminist organization grew until the passage of the
Nineteenth Amendment in 1920 gave women the right to vote. Women joined the work force
temporarily during World War II and permanently starting in the 1960s. By the 1990s, they
were a regular part of the armed forces, and by the early 2000s, 75 Congresswomen were in
the Capitol.
Racial Equality
Blacks, almost all of them slaves, made up 15 percent of the U.S. population at the time of 
the Revolution. The next largest minority from a non-English-speaking area was the German
Americans at 7 percent of the population. As the United States grew, other significant minori-
ties were the Irish, Hispanics, Polish, Jewish, Chinese, and Japanese. Each of these groups
has been subject to discrimination that was in part proportional to their self-identification 
as a special group within America. As groups have mixed in American society, prejudice has
declined.
Blacks gained freedom from slavery after the Civil War but were still subject to Jim Crow 
laws until the 1960s. The Chinese and Japanese were excluded from immigration in the late
1800s and early 1900s, but have since become an affluent part of the country. In the early
2000s, 10 percent of the largest counties in the United States were majority minority, meaning
that no one race or ethnic group formed a majority of their population. During the same time,
four whole states were minority majority: California, Hawaii, Texas, and New Mexico. Culture,
population centers, group membership, and even families began to blend across ethnic
groups in the early 2000s.
Reform
The United States was the most democratic country in the world at the time of its founding.
Britain had a parliament, but its members were elected by a small minority of the population
and tended to represent the interests of the rich landowners. The U.S. achieved universal
white male voting without regard to property ownership in 1824, universal male voting in
1870, universal voting for men and women in 1920, and actual universal voting (including
blacks) in 1964.
Major reforms included an end to the Alien and Sedition Acts (1802), more voter participa-
tion in elections (1824), the beginning of public education (1850), the abolition of slavery
(1865), industrial regulation (1900), pure food (1908), the 10-hour workday (1910), election
reform with direct election of the Senate (1914), no child labor (1920), the eight-hour workday

and union rights (1935), Social Security (1936), the expansion of higher education (1950),
civil rights (1964), Medicare and Medicaid (1966), and the beginning of environmental protec-
tion (1970).
U.S. Relations with the World
The United States had an international population even during its colonial period, but the
early colonies had few resources to trade with the rest of the world. Tobacco proved a best
seller, and merchants joined the international slave trade in the triangular exchange of
slaves, sugar, rum, and guns.
After the Revolution, the new U.S. backpedaled hard to stay out of foreign wars until the
nation fought the War of 1812 over trade rights. The country expanded west thanks to
France’s going-out-of-business sale of the Louisiana Purchase to the U.S. in 1803. The U.S. lim-
ited international involvement in central North America by taking half of Mexico’s territory
and getting Britain to agree to a compromise border with Canada. Real internationalism by
the U.S. started with the Spanish-American War in 1898.
The U.S. tried to stay neutral but was drawn into World War I in Europe. Going back to splen-
did isolation behind the oceans, the U.S. paid for not helping keep the peace by having to
fight World War II against both Germany and Japan. After World War II, the U.S. stepped up to
the plate to be a world leader. In the early 2000s, the country began to accept responsibility
to work with the rest of the world to limit damage to the earth’s environment.
Spirituality
Spirituality is a human’s relationship with the higher power it feels shapes and binds the uni-
verse together. This relationship can be expressed as a deep personal love of justice, such as
that of Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln. It can also come from active participation in
a religious organization, such as those supported by Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush.
The U.S. has been a leader in both forms of the expression of spirituality. Early New England
was a haven for the specific religious sects of Puritans and Pilgrims; they drove out and even
killed people who disagreed with their religions. Freethinkers like William Penn, Jefferson,
Thoreau, and Emerson kept the United States open to personal spirituality even though they
themselves didn’t go to church. The U.S. has always declined to declare any particular offi-
cial religion; the very first Amendment to the Constitution separated church and state.
Spiritual revival has played a major role in American history. The First Great Awakening
(1740) connected people who would later protect the colonies in the French and Indian War
and led the new U.S. to freedom in the Revolution. The Second Great Awakening (1830) laid
the groundwork for the women’s movement and for opposition to slavery. Spirituality is a
fountain that refreshes committed people.

The Supreme Court: Ten Greatest Hits
In This Chapter
 Understanding the best Court decisions
 Following legal opinions as they developed
 Seeing how the Supreme Court changed history
A
s the final touch in your review of the United States’ past, here are the ten most impor-
tant Supreme Court decisions. The Supreme Court is the last word on the law of the
land in the United States, and these ten cases are part of its claim to fame.  
Being able to reference Supreme Court decisions is impressive evidence of your mastery of
U.S. History on the AP exam. Because you can’t make much money teaching history, who
knows — you may want to be a lawyer.
Marbury versus Madison (1803)
In this early decision, the Supreme Court super Chief Justice John Marshall found that the
Supremes have the final word on whether any law is constitutional. The Court refused to
order that Marbury be awarded a federal legal job because the law he was using wasn’t cov-
ered by the Constitution.
McCulloch versus Maryland (1819)
This case established that federal law trumps state law. Maryland wanted to slap a state tax
on the National Bank established by the federal government. John Marshall found that the
feds had the power to set up a bank under the Necessary and Proper Clause of the
Constitution and that states could no more tax the federal bank than they could tax the army.
Gibbons versus Ogden (1824)
This decision states that only the feds can regulate business between the states. New York
tried to set steamboat guru Robert Fulton as the only guy who could run power boats
between New York and New Jersey (or license others, like Ogden, to do so). Not fair, said the
court; anything that runs between states is the business of the feds. When they got around to
it 140 years later, this principle allowed Congress to require civil rights in planes, trains,
hotels, and restaurants.

West Coast Hotel Co. versus Parrish (1937)
This decision during the heart of the Great Depression allowed the federal government to set
minimum wages for work in private industry, something the Court had previously prohibited.
Parrish was a poor chambermaid whose hotel refused to pay her the minimum wage.
Brown versus Board of Education (1954)
Separate and not equal was the unspoken rule of the land before this decision came along. It
set off the Civil Rights movement by declaring that segregated schools for different races had
to go. Brown, an African American railroad worker, had a third-grade daughter who had been
forced to travel miles to a segregated black school when a white-only public school was right
in her neighborhood.
Gideon versus Wainwright (1963)
Gideon was a poor prisoner who was barely literate. In a touching, handwritten appeal, he
asked the Supreme Court for help. The Supremes found that states have a duty to supply a
lawyer for people who can’t afford one. Gideon got a new trial and was found innocent.
Griswold versus Connecticut (1965)
This case established the right to privacy that kept the states from regulating personal 
sexual behavior that hurts no one. Griswold had been fined by Connecticut for running a
birth-control clinic.
Miranda versus Arizona (1966)
Miranda was a Mexican American with little education who confessed under police question-
ing without being read his now-famous rights to remain silent and to have an attorney. Even
people being arrested in totalitarian countries now sometimes demand police read their
Miranda rights like they saw on TV. They don’t know that because they’re not from the U.S.,
they don’t necessarily have these rights.
Roe versus Wade (1973)
The Court held that women have a privacy right to decide whether to have an abortion;
states can’t prohibit this birth-control procedure. Although many women favor the right to
choose, conservative religious groups oppose abortion. The Court has been a battleground
ever since.
366
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

United States versus Nixon (1974)
President Nixon had to turn over tape recordings as ordered by a federal court. The Court
found that even the president has to follow the law; he can’t hide behind executive privilege.
Nixon, supported by a few of his Republican allies, had tried to argue that he didn’t have to
turn over evidence of his own wrongdoing to Congress because as president he had special
rights. The Supreme Court held that the president is not above the law. Shortly after this
ruling, Nixon resigned to avoid impeachment.
