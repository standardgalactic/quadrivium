TO THE STUDENT
“It looks so easy when you do it, but when I get home . . . ” is a popular lament of many
students studying mathematics.
The process of learning mathematics evolves in stages. For most students, the ﬁrst
stage is listening to and watching others. In the middle stage, students experiment, dis-
cover, and practice. In the ﬁnal stage, students analyze and summarize what they have
learned. Many students try to do only the middle stage because they do not realize how
important the entire process is.
Here are some steps that will help you to work through all the learning stages:
1. Go to class every day. Be prepared, take notes, and most of all, think actively about
what is happening. Ask questions and keep yourself focused. This is prime study time.
2. Begin your homework as soon after class as possible. Start by reviewing your class
notes and then read the text. Each section is organized in the same manner to help you
ﬁnd information easily. The objectives tell you what concepts will be covered, and the
vocabulary lists all the new technical words. There is a How & Why section for each
objective that explains the basic concept, followed by worked sample problems. As you
read each example, make sure you understand every step. Then work the correspond-
ing Warm-Up problem to reinforce what you have learned. You can check your answer
at the bottom of the page. Continue through the whole section in this manner.
3. Now work the exercises at the end of the section. The A group of exercises can usually
be done in your head. The B group is harder and will probably require pencil and
paper. The C group problems are more difﬁcult, and the objectives are mixed to give
you practice at distinguishing the different solving strategies. As a general rule, do not
spend more than 15 minutes on any one problem. If you cannot do a problem, mark it
and ask someone (your teacher, a tutor, or a study buddy) to help you with it later.
Do not skip the Maintain Your Skills problems. They are for review and will help you
practice earlier procedures so you do not become “rusty.” The answers to the odd ex-
ercises are in the back of the text so you can check your progress.
4. In this text, you will ﬁnd State Your Understanding exercises in every section. Taken
as a whole, these exercises cover all the basic concepts in the text. You may do these
orally or in writing. Their purpose is to encourage you to analyze or summarize a skill
and put it into words. We suggest that you do these in writing and keep them all to-
gether in a journal. Then they are readily available as a review for chapter tests and
exams.
5. When preparing for a test, work the material at the end of the chapter. The True/False
Concept Review and the Chapter Test give you a chance to review the concepts you
have learned. You may want to use the chapter test as a practice test.
If you have never had to write in a math class, the idea can be intimidating. Write as
if you are explaining to a classmate who was absent the day the concept was discussed.
Use your own words—do not copy out of the text. The goal is that you understand the con-
cept, not that you can quote what the authors have said. Always use complete sentences,
correct spelling, and proper punctuation. Like everything else, writing about math is a
learned skill. Be patient with yourself and you will catch on.

xii
To the Student
Since we have many students who do not have a happy history with math, we have
included Good Advice for Studying—a series of eight essays that address various prob-
lems that are common for students. They include advice on time organization, test taking,
and reducing math anxiety. We talk about these things with our own students, and hope
that you will ﬁnd some useful tips.
We really want you to succeed in this course. If you go through each stage of learn-
ing and follow all the steps, you will have an excellent chance for success. But remember,
you are in control of your learning. The effort that you put into this course is the single
biggest factor in determining the outcome. Good luck!

TO THE INSTRUCTOR
Fundamentals of Mathematics, Ninth Edition, is a work text for college students who
need to review the basic skills and concepts of arithmetic in order to pass competency or
placement exams, or to prepare for courses such as business mathematics or elementary
algebra. The text is accompanied by a complete system of ancillaries in a variety of
media, affording great ﬂexibility for individual instructors and students.
A Textbook for Adult Students
Though the mathematical content of Fundamentals of Mathematics is elementary, stu-
dents using the text are most often mature adults, bringing with them adult attitudes and
experiences and a broad range of abilities. Teaching elementary content to these students,
therefore, is effective when it accounts for their distinct and diverse adult needs. As you
read about and examine the features of Fundamentals of Mathematics and its ancillaries,
you will see how they especially meet three needs of your students:
• Students must establish good study habits and overcome math anxiety.
• Students must see connections between mathematics and the modern, day-to-day
world of adult activities.
• Students must be paced and challenged according to their individual level of under-
standing.
A Textbook of Many Course Formats
Fundamentals of Mathematics is suitable for individual study or for a variety of course
formats: lab, both supervised and self-paced; lecture; group; or combined formats. For a
lecture-based course, for example, each section is designed to be covered in a standard
50-minute class. The lecture can be interrupted periodically so that students individually
can work the Warm-Up exercises or work in small groups on the group work. In a self-
paced lab course, Warm-Up exercises give students a chance to practice while they learn,
and get immediate feedback since warm-up answers are printed on the same page. Using
the text’s ancillaries, instructors and students have even more options available to them.
Computer users, for example, can take advantage of complete electronic tutorial and test-
ing systems that are fully coordinated with the text.

Teaching by Application
Each chapter leads off with an application that uses the con-
tent of the chapter. Exercise sets have applications that use this material or that are closely
related to it. Applications are included in the examples for most objectives. Other appli-
cations appear in exercise sets. These cover a diverse range of ﬁelds, demonstrating the
utility of the content in business, environment, personal health, sports, and daily life.
xvi
To the Instructor
Teaching Methodology
As you examine the Ninth Edition of Fundamentals of Mathematics, you will see dis-
tinctive format and pedagogy that reﬂect these aspects of teaching methodology:
Teaching by Objective
Each section focuses on a short list of objectives, stated at the
beginning of the section. The objectives correspond to the sequence of exposition and tie
together other pedagogy, including the highlighted content, the examples, and the
exercises.
1.1
Whole Numbers and Tables: Writing, Rounding,
and Inequalities
OBJECTIVES
1. Write word names from
place value names and
place value names from
word names.
2. Write an inequality
statement about two
numbers.
3. Round a given whole
number.
4. Read tables.
VOCABULARY
The digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
The natural numbers (counting numbers) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.
The whole numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. Numbers larger than
9 are written in place value name by writing the digits in positions having
standard place value.
Word names are written words that represent numerals. The word name
of 213 is two hundred thirteen.
The symbols less than, , and greater than, , are used to compare
two whole numbers that are not equal. So, 11  15, and 21  5.
To round a whole number means to give an approximate value. The symbol
means “approximately equal to.”

Emphasis on Language
New words of each section are explained in the vocabulary
segment that precedes the exposition. Exercise sets include questions requiring responses
written in the students’ own words.
To the Instructor
xvii
Emphasis on Skill, Concept, and Problem Solving
Each section covers concepts and
skills that are fully explained and demonstrated in the exposition for each objective.
Carefully constructed examples for each objective are connected by a common strategy
that reinforces both the skill and the underlying concepts. Skills are not treated as isolated
feats of memorization but as the practical result of conceptual understanding: Skills are
strategies for solving related problems. Students see the connections between problems
that require similar strategies.
1.7
Average, Median, and Mode
OBJECTIVES
1. Find the average of a set
of whole numbers.
2. Find the median of a set
of whole numbers.
3. Find the mode of a set of
whole numbers.
VOCABULARY
The average, or mean, of a set of numbers is the sum of the set of numbers
divided by the total number of numbers in the set. 
The median of a set of numbers, ordered from smallest to largest, is either the
middle number of the set or the average of the two middle numbers in the set.
The mode of a set of numbers is the number or numbers that appear the
most often in the set.
Examples A–E
Warm-Ups A–E

How & Why
Find the average of a set of whole numbers.
The average or mean of a set of numbers is used in statistics. It is one of the ways to ﬁnd
the middle of a set of numbers (like the average of a set of test grades). Mathematicians
call the average or mean a “measure of central tendency.” The average of a set of numbers
is found by adding the numbers in the set and then dividing that sum by the number of
numbers in the set. For example, to ﬁnd the average of 11, 21, and 28:
11  21  28  60
Find the sum of the numbers in the set.
60  3  20
Divide the sum by the number of numbers, 3.
The average is 20.
The “central” number or average does not need to be one of the members of the set.
The average, 20, is not a member of the set.
OBJECTIVE 1
To ﬁnd the average of a set of whole numbers
1. Add the numbers.
2. Divide the sum by the number of numbers in the set.

Calculator examples, marked by the symbol 
, demonstrate how a calculator may
be used, though the use of a calculator is left to the discretion of the instructor. Nowhere
is the use of a calculator required. Appendix A reviews the basics of operating a scientiﬁc
calculator.
Emphasis on Success and Preparation
Integrated throughout the text, the following features focus on study skills, math anxiety,
calculators, and simple algebraic equations.
Good Advice for Studying is continued from the previous editions. Originally writ-
ten by the team of Dorette Long and Sylvia Thomas of Rogue Community College, these
essays address the unique study problems that students of Fundamentals of Mathematics
experience. Students learn general study skills and study skills speciﬁc to mathematics and
to the pedagogy and ancillaries of Fundamentals of Mathematics. Special techniques are
described to overcome the pervasive problems of math anxiety. Though an essay begins
each chapter, students may proﬁt by reading all the essays at once and then returning to
them as the need arises.

GOOD ADVICE FOR STUDYING
Strategies for Success
A
re you afraid of math? Do you panic on tests or “blank out” and forget what you
have studied, only to recall the material after the test? Then you are just like many
other students. In fact, research studies estimate that as many as 50% of you have
some degree of math anxiety.
What is math anxiety? It is a learned fear response to math that causes disruptive,
debilitating reactions to tests. It can be so encompassing that it becomes a dread of
doing anything that involves numbers. Although some anxiety at test time is
beneﬁcial—it can motivate and energize you, for example—numerous studies show
that too much anxiety results in poorer test scores. Besides performing poorly on tests,
you may be distracted by worrisome thoughts and be unable to concentrate and recall
what you’ve learned. You may also set unrealistic performance standards for yourself
and imagine catastrophic consequences for your failure to be successful in math. Your
physical signs could be muscle tightness, stomach upset, sweating, headache, shortness
of breath, shaking, or rapid heartbeat.
The good news is that anxiety is a learned behavior and therefore can be unlearned.
If you want to stop feeling anxious, the choice is up to you. You can choose to learn be-
haviors that are more useful to achieve success in math. You can learn and choose the
ways that work best for you.
To achieve success, you can focus on two broad strategies. First, you can study math
in ways proven to be effective in learning mathematics and taking tests. Second, you
can learn to physically and mentally relax, to manage your anxious feelings, and to
think rationally and positively. Make a time commitment to practice relaxation tech-
niques, study math, and record your thought patterns. A commitment of 1 or 2 hours
a day may be necessary in the beginning. Remember, it took time to learn your present
study habits and to be anxious. It will take time to unlearn these behaviors. After you
become proﬁcient with these methods, you can devote less time to them.
Begin now to learn your strategies for success. Be sure you have read To the Student
at the beginning of this book. The purpose of this section is to introduce you to the
authors’ plan for this text. To the Student will help you to understand the authors’
organization or “game plan” for your math experience in this course.
At the beginning of each chapter, you will ﬁnd more Good Advice for Studying sec-
tions, which will help you study and take tests more effectively, as well as help you man-
age your anxiety. You may want to read ahead so that you can improve even more
quickly. Good luck!

Getting Ready for Algebra segments follow Sections 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 3.4, 3.9, 4.3, 4.6,
and 4.8. The operations from these sections lend themselves to solving simple algebraic
equations. Though entirely optional, each of these segments includes its own exposition,
examples with warm-ups, and exercises. Instructors may cover these segments as part of
the normal curriculum or assign them to individual students.
Pedagogy
The pedagogical system of Fundamentals of Mathematics meets two important criteria:
coordinated purpose and consistency of presentation.
Each section begins with numbered Objectives, followed by deﬁnitions of new
Vocabulary to be encountered in the section. Following the vocabulary, How & Why
segments, numbered to correspond to the objectives, explain and demonstrate concepts
CALCULATOR EXAMPLE
C. Find the average of 673, 821, 415, and 763.
S T R A T E G Y :
Enter the sum, in parentheses, and divide by 4.
(673  821  415  763)  4
The average is 668.
D. The average of 38, 26, 12, and ? is 28. Find the missing number.
S T R A T E G Y :
Because the average of the four numbers is 28, we know that the sum
of the four numbers is 4(28) or 112. To ﬁnd the missing number, sub-
tract the sum of the three given numbers from 112.
112  (38  26  12)  112  (76)
 36
So the missing number is 36.

How & Why
In Section 1.2, the equations involved the inverse operations addition and subtraction.
Multiplication and division are also inverse operations. We can use this idea to solve
equations containing those operations. For example, if 4 is multiplied by 2, 4  2  8, the
product is 8. If the product is divided by 2, 8  2, the result is 4, the original number. In
the same manner, if 12 is divided by 3, 12  3  4, the quotient is 4. If the quotient is
multiplied by 3, 4  3  12, the original number. We use this idea to solve equations in
which the variable is either multiplied or divided by a number.
When a variable is multiplied or divided by a number, the multiplication symbols
( or ) and the division symbol () normally are not written. We write 3x for 3 times x
and 
for x divided by 3.
Consider the following:
5x  30

Division will eliminate multiplication.
x  6
If x in the original equation is replaced by 6 we have

and skills. Throughout the How & Why segments, skill boxes clearly summarize and
outline the skills in step-by-step form. Also throughout the segments, concept boxes
highlight appropriate properties, formulas, and theoretical facts underlying the skills.
Following each How & Why segment are Examples and Warm-Ups. Each example
of an objective is paired with a warm-up, with workspace provided. Solutions to the
warm-ups are given at the bottom of the page, affording immediate feedback. The
examples also include, where suitable, a relevant application of the objective. Examples
similar to each other are linked by common Directions and a common Strategy for solu-
tion. Directions and strategies are closely related to the skill boxes. Connecting examples
by a common solution method helps students recognize the similarity of problems and
their solutions, despite their speciﬁc differences. In this way, students may improve their
problem-solving skills. In both How & Why segments and in the Examples, Caution
remarks help to forestall common mistakes.
Exercises, Reviews, Tests
Thorough, varied, properly paced, and well-chosen exercises are a hallmark of Funda-
mentals of Mathematics. Exercise sets are provided at the end of each section and a
review set at the end of each chapter. Workspace is provided for all exercises and each
exercise set can be torn out and handed in without disturbing other parts of the book.
Section exercises are paired so that virtually each odd-numbered exercise, in Sections
A and B, is paired with an even-numbered exercise that is equivalent in type and difﬁculty.
Since answers for odd-numbered exercises are in the back of the book, students can be as-
signed odd-numbered exercises for practice and even-numbered exercises for homework.
Section exercises are categorized to satisfy teaching and learning aims. Exercises for
estimation, mental computation, pencil and paper computation, application, and calcula-
tor skills are provided, as well as opportunities for students to challenge their abilities,
master communications skills, and participate in group problem solving.
• Category A exercises, organized by section objective, are those that most students
should be able to solve mentally, without pencil, paper, or calculator. Mentally work-
ing problems improves students’ estimating abilities. These can often be used in class
as oral exercises.
• Category B exercises, also organized by objective, are similar except for level of difﬁ-
culty. All students should be able to master Category B.
• Category C exercises contain applications and more difﬁcult exercises. Since these are
not categorized by objective, the student must decide on the strategy needed to set up
and solve the problem. These applications are drawn from business, health and nutri-
tion, environment, consumer, sports, and science ﬁelds. Both professional and daily-
life uses of mathematics are incorporated.

Group Work exercises and Group Projects provide opportunities for small groups
of students to work together to solve problems and create reports. While the use of these
is optional, the authors suggest the assignment of two or three of these per semester or
term to furnish students with an environment for exchanging ideas. Group Work
exercises encourage cooperative learning as recommended by AMATYC and NCTM
guidelines.
Challenge exercises stretch the content and are more demanding computationally
and conceptually.

Changes in the Ninth Edition
Instructors who have used a previous edition of Fundamentals of Mathematics will see
changes and improvements in format, pedagogy, exercises, and sectioning of content.
Many of these changes are in response to comments and suggestions offered by users and
Chapter True/False Concept Review exercises require students to judge whether a
statement is true or false and, if false, to rewrite the sentence to make it true. Students
evaluate their understanding of concepts and also gain experience using the vocabulary of
mathematics.
True/False Concept Review

GOOD ADVICE FOR STUDYING
Strategies for Success
A
re you afraid of math? Do you panic on tests or “blank out” and forget what you
have studied, only to recall the material after the test? Then you are just like many
other students. In fact, research studies estimate that as many as 50% of you have
some degree of math anxiety.
What is math anxiety? It is a learned fear response to math that causes disruptive,
debilitating reactions to tests. It can be so encompassing that it becomes a dread of
doing anything that involves numbers. Although some anxiety at test time is
beneﬁcial—it can motivate and energize you, for example—numerous studies show
that too much anxiety results in poorer test scores. Besides performing poorly on tests,
you may be distracted by worrisome thoughts and be unable to concentrate and recall
what you’ve learned. You may also set unrealistic performance standards for yourself
and imagine catastrophic consequences for your failure to be successful in math. Your
physical signs could be muscle tightness, stomach upset, sweating, headache, shortness
of breath, shaking, or rapid heartbeat.
The good news is that anxiety is a learned behavior and therefore can be unlearned.
If you want to stop feeling anxious, the choice is up to you. You can choose to learn be-
haviors that are more useful to achieve success in math. You can learn and choose the
ways that work best for you.
To achieve success, you can focus on two broad strategies. First, you can study math
in ways proven to be effective in learning mathematics and taking tests. Second, you
can learn to physically and mentally relax, to manage your anxious feelings, and to
think rationally and positively. Make a time commitment to practice relaxation tech-
niques, study math, and record your thought patterns. A commitment of 1 or 2 hours
a day may be necessary in the beginning. Remember, it took time to learn your present
study habits and to be anxious. It will take time to unlearn these behaviors. After you
become proﬁcient with these methods, you can devote less time to them.
Begin now to learn your strategies for success. Be sure you have read To the Student
at the beginning of this book. The purpose of this section is to introduce you to the
authors’ plan for this text. To the Student will help you to understand the authors’
organization or “game plan” for your math experience in this course.
At the beginning of each chapter, you will ﬁnd more Good Advice for Studying sec-
tions, which will help you study and take tests more effectively, as well as help you man-
age your anxiety. You may want to read ahead so that you can improve even more
quickly. Good luck!

How & Why
Write word names from place value names and
place value names from word names.
In our written whole number system (called the Hindu-Arabic system), digits and
commas are the only symbols used. This system is a positional base 10 (decimal) system.
The location of the digit determines its value, from right to left. The ﬁrst three place value
names are one, ten, and hundred. See Figure 1.1.
Figure 1.1
For the number 583,
3 is in the ones place, so it contributes 3 ones, or 3, to the value of the number,
8 is in the tens place, so it contributes 8 tens, or 80, to the value of the number,
5 is in the hundreds place, so it contributes 5 hundreds, or 500, to the value of the number.
So 583 is 5 hundreds  8 tens  3 ones or 500  80  3. These are called expanded
forms of the number. The word name is ﬁve hundred eighty-three.

4. Read tables.
VOCABULARY
The digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
The natural numbers (counting numbers) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.
The whole numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. Numbers larger than
9 are written in place value name by writing the digits in positions having
standard place value.
Word names are written words that represent numerals. The word name
of 213 is two hundred thirteen.
The symbols less than, , and greater than, , are used to compare
two whole numbers that are not equal. So, 11  15, and 21  5.
To round a whole number means to give an approximate value. The symbol
means “approximately equal to.”
A table is a method of displaying data in an array using a horizontal and
vertical arrangement to distinguish the type of data. A row of a table is a
horizontal line of a table and reads left to right across the page. A column
of a table is a vertical line of a table and reads up or down the page. For
example, in Table 1.2 the number “57” is in row 3 and column 2.

For numbers larger than 999, we use commas to separate groups of three digits. The
ﬁrst four groups are unit, thousand, million, and billion (Figure 1.2). The group on the far
left may have one, two, or three digits. All other groups must have three digits. Within
each group the names are the same (hundred, ten, and  one).

To write the word name from a place value name
1. From left to right, write the word name for each set of three digits 
followed by the group name (except units).
2. Insert a comma after each group name.
To write the place value name from the word name of a number, we reverse the
previous process. First identify the group names and then write each group name in the
place value name. Remember to write a 0 for each missing place value. Consider
three billion, two hundred thirty-ﬁve million, nine thousand, four hundred thirteen
three billion, two hundred thirty-ﬁve million,
Identify the group names.
nine thousand, four hundred thirteen
(Hint: Look for the commas.)
3 billion, 235 million, 9 thousand, 413
Write the place value name for each
group.
3,235,009,413
Drop the group names. Keep all commas. Zeros must be
inserted to show that there are no hundreds or tens in the
thousands group.
C A U T I O N
The word and is not used to write names of whole numbers. So write: three
hundred ten, NOT three hundred and ten, also one thousand, two hundred
twenty-three, NOT one thousand and two hundred twenty-three.
To write a place value name from a word name
1. Identify the group names.
2. Write the three-digit number before each group name, followed by a
comma. (The ﬁrst group, on the left, may have fewer than three digits.)
It is common to omit the comma in 4-digit numerals.
Numbers like 81,000,000,000, with all zeros following a single group of digits, are
often written in a combination of place value notation and word name. The ﬁrst set of
digits on the left is written in place value notation followed by the group name. So
81,000,000,000 is written 81 billion.

How & Why
Write an inequality statement about
two numbers.
If two whole numbers are not equal, then the ﬁrst is either less than or greater than the
second. Look at the number line (or ruler) in Figure 1.3.
Figure 1.3
Given two numbers on a number line or ruler, the number on the right is the larger. For
example,
9  7
9 is to the right of 7, so 9 is greater than 7.
11  1
11 is to the right of 1, so 11 is greater than 1.
14  8
14 is to the right of 8, so 14 is greater than 8.
13  0
13 is to the right of 0, so 13 is greater than 0.
Given two numbers on a number line or ruler, the number on the left is the smaller. For
example,
3  9
3 is to the left of 9, so 3 is less than 9.
5  12
5 is to the left of 12, so 5 is less than 12.
1  9
1 is to the left of 9, so 1 is less than 9.
10  14
10 is to the left of 14, so 10 is less than 14.
For larger numbers, imagine a longer number line. Notice how the points in the sym-
bols  and  point to the smaller of the two numbers. For example,

How & Why
Round a given whole number.
Many numbers that we see in daily life are approximations. These are used to indicate the
approximate value when it is believed that the exact value is not important to the discus-
sion. So attendance at a political rally may be stated at 15,000 when it was actually
14,783. The amount of a deﬁcit in the budget may be stated as $2,000,000 instead of
$2,067,973. In this chapter, we use these approximations to estimate the outcome of
operations with whole numbers. The symbol 
, read “approximately equal to,” is used to
show the approximation. So $2,067,973 
$2,000,000.
We approximate numbers by rounding. The number line can be used to see how whole
numbers are rounded. Suppose we wish to round 57 to the nearest ten. See Figure 1.4
Figure 1.4
The arrow under the 57 is closer to 60 than to 50. We say “to the nearest ten, 57 rounds
to 60.”
We use the same idea to round any number, although we usually make only a mental
image of the number line. The key question is: Is this number closer to the smaller rounded
number or to the larger one? Practically, we need to  determine only if the number is more
or less than half the distance between the rounded numbers.
To round 47,472 to the nearest thousand without a number line, draw an arrow under
the digit in the thousands place.
47,472
Because 47,472 is between 47,000 and 48,000, we must decide which number it is closer
to. Because 47,500 is halfway between 47,000 and 48,000 and because 47,472  47,500,
we conclude that 47,472 is less than halfway to 48,000.
Whenever the number is less than halfway to the larger number, we choose the
smaller number.
47,472
47,000
47,472 is closer to 47,000 than to 48,000.

1.1 Whole Numbers and Tables: Writing, Rounding, and Inequalities
To round a number to a given place value
1. Draw an arrow under the given place value.
2. If the digit to the right of the arrow is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, add one to the digit
above the arrow. (Round to the larger number.)
3. If the digit to the right of the arrow is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, do not change the
digit above the arrow. (Round to the smaller number.)
4. Replace all the digits to the right of the arrow with zeros.

How & Why
Read tables.
Data are often displayed in the form of a table. We see tables in the print media, in ad-
vertisements, and in business presentations. Reading a table involves ﬁnding the correct
column and row that describes the needed information, and then reading the data at the
intersection of that column and that row.

For example, in Table 1.3, to ﬁnd the number of sophomores who take English, ﬁnd the
column headed English and the row headed Sophomore and read the number at the
intersection.
The number of sophomores taking English is 700.
We can use the table to compare enrollments by class. For instance, are more seniors
or sophomores taking science? From the table we see that 650 sophomores are taking
science and 700 seniors are taking science. Since 700  650, more seniors than sopho-
mores are taking science.

1.2 Adding and Subtracting Whole Numbers
17
How & Why
Find the sum of two or more whole numbers.
When Jose graduated from high school he received cash gifts of $50, $20, and $25. The
total number of dollars received is found by adding the individual gifts. The total number
of dollars he received is 95. In this section we review the procedure for adding and sub-
tracting whole numbers.
The addition facts and place value are used to add whole numbers written with more
than one digit. Let’s use this to ﬁnd the sum of the cash gifts that Jose received. We need
to ﬁnd the sum of
50  20  25
By writing the numbers in expanded form and putting the same place values in columns
it is easy to add.
50  5 tens  0 ones
20  2 tens  0 ones
25  2 tens  5 ones
9 tens  5 ones  95
So, 50  20  25  95. Jose received $95 in cash gifts.
Because each place can contain only a single digit, it is often necessary to rewrite the
sum of a column.
77  7 tens  7 ones
16  1 tens  6 ones
8 tens  13 ones
Because 13 ones is a 2-digit number it must be renamed:
8 tens  13 ones  8 tens  1 ten  3 ones
 9 tens  3 ones
 93
So the sum of 77 and 16 is 93.
The common shortcut is shown in the following sum. To add 497  307  135, write
the numbers in a column.

1. Find the sum of two or
more whole numbers.
2. Find the difference of
two whole numbers.
3. Estimate the sum or
difference of whole 
numbers.
4. Find the perimeter of a
polygon.
VOCABULARY
Addends are the numbers that are added. In 9  20  3  32, the addends
are 9, 20, and 3.
The result of adding is called the sum. In 9  20  3  32, the sum is 32.
The result of subtracting is called the difference. So in 62  34  28, 28
is the difference.
A polygon is any closed ﬁgure whose sides are line segments.
The perimeter of a polygon is the distance around the outside of the 
polygon.
Written this way, the digits in the ones, tens, and hundreds
places are aligned.

How & Why
Find the difference of two whole numbers.
Marcia went shopping with $78. She made purchases totaling $53. How much money
does she have left? Finding the difference in two quantities is called subtraction. When we
subtract $53 from $78 we get $25.
Subtraction can be thought of as ﬁnding the missing addend in an addition exercise.
For instance, 9  5  ? asks 5  ?  9. Because 5  4  9, we know that 9  5  4.
Similarly, 47  15  ? asks 15  ?  47. Because 15  32  47, we know that
47  15  32.
For larger numbers, such as 875  643, we take advantage of the column form and
expanded notation to ﬁnd the missing addend in each column.
875  8 hundreds  7 tens  5 ones
643  6 hundreds  4 tens  3 ones
2 hundreds  3 tens  2 ones  232
Check by adding:
643
232
875
So, 875  643  232.
Now consider the difference 672  438. Write the numbers in column form.
672  6 hundreds  7 tens  2 ones
438  4 hundreds  3 tens  8 ones
Here we cannot subtract 8 ones from 2 ones, so we rename by “borrowing” one of the tens
from the 7 tens (1 ten  10 ones) and adding the 10 ones to the 2 ones.
6 tens
12 ones
672  6 hundreds  7 tens  2 ones

Check by adding:

We generally don’t bother to write the expanded form when we subtract. We show the
shortcut for borrowing in the examples.
OBJECTIVE 2

To subtract whole numbers
1. Write the numbers in a column so that the place values are aligned.
2. Subtract in each column, starting with the ones (or units) column.
3. When the numbers in a column cannot be subtracted, borrow 1 from the
next column and rename by adding 10 to the upper digit in the current
column and then subtract.

Now borrow 1 thousand (1 thousand  10 hundreds). We can now
subtract in every column.

How & Why
Estimate the sum or difference 
of whole numbers.
The sum or difference of whole numbers can be estimated by rounding each number to a
speciﬁed place value and then adding or subtracting the rounded values. Estimating is
useful to check to see if a calculated sum or difference is reasonable or when the exact
sum is not needed. For instance, estimate the sum by rounding to the nearest thousand.

The estimate of the sum is 25,000.
OBJECTIVE 3
Begin with the ones column. 9 is larger than 0, so ask “What do I add to
9 to make 10?”
Because 1  9  10, we write the 1 in the ones column and carry the 1
over to the 5 to make 6. Now ask “What do I add to 6 to make 10?”
Enter 82,979  49,355.
The difference is 33,624.
H. Maxwell Auto is advertising a $986 rebate on all new cars priced above $15,000.
What is the cost after rebate of a car originally priced at $16,798?
S T R A T E G Y :
Because the price of the car is over $15,000, we subtract the amount of
the rebate to ﬁnd the cost.
16,798

to the estimated sum, you should check the addition by re-adding. In this case the calcu-
lated sum, 24,896, is close to the estimated sums of 25,000 and 24,900.

our energy for body heat and physical activity from calories in our food. Even when resting we use energy for muscle actions
such as breathing, heartbeat, digestion, and other functions. If we consume more calories than we use up, we gain weight. If
we consume less calories than we use, we lose weight. Some nutritionists recommend about 2270 calories per day for women
aged 18–30 who are reasonably active.

How & Why
Solve an equation of the form x  a  b or
x  a  b, where a, b, and x are whole numbers.
Examples of equations are
9  9
13  13
123  123
30  4  34
52  7  45
When variables are used an equation can look like this:
x  7
x  10
y  18
x  5  13
y  8  23
An equation containing a variable can be true only when the variable is replaced by a spe-
ciﬁc number. For example,
x  7 is true only when x is replaced by 7.
x  10 is true only when x is replaced by 10.
y  18 is true only when y is replaced by 18.
x  5  13 is true only when x is replaced by 8, so that 8  5  13.
y  8  23 is true only when y is replaced by 31, so that 31  8  23.
The numbers that make equations true are called solutions. Solutions of equations,
such as x  7  12, can be found by trial and error, but let’s develop a more practical way.
Addition and subtraction are inverse, or opposite, operations. For example, if 14 is
added to a number and then 14 is subtracted from that sum, the difference is the original
number. So
23  14  37
Add 14 to 23.
37  14  23
Subtract 14 from the sum, 37. The difference is the original number, 23.
We use this idea to solve the following equation:
x  21  35
21 is added to the number represented by x.
x  21  21  35  21
To remove the addition and have only x on the left side of the
x  14
equal sign, we subtract 21. To keep a true equation, we must
subtract 21 from both sides.
To check, replace x in the original equation with 14 and see if the result is a true statement:
x  21  35
14  21  35
35  35
The statement is true, so the solution is 14.
We can also use the idea of inverses to solve an equation in which a number is subtracted
from a variable (letter):
b  17  12
b  17  17  12  17
b  29
OBJECTIVE

33
Getting Ready for Algebra
OBJECTIVE
Solve an equation of the
form x  a  b or x  a  b,
where a, b, and x are whole
numbers.
VOCABULARY
An equation is a statement about numbers that says that two expressions are
equal. Letters, called variables or unknowns, are often used to represent
numbers.
Since 17 is subtracted from the variable, we eliminate the 
subtraction by adding 17 to both sides of the equation. Recall
that addition is the inverse of subtraction.
The equation will be true when b is replaced by 29.

CHECK: 
b  17  12
29  17  12
Substitute 29 for b.
12  12
True.
So the solution is b  29.
34
Section 1.2 Getting Ready for Algebra
To solve an equation using addition or subtraction
1. Add the same number to each side of the equation to isolate the variable, or

1.3 Multiplying Whole Numbers
39
How & Why
Multiply whole numbers.
Multiplying whole numbers is a shortcut for repeated addition:
8  8  8  8  8  8  48
or
6  8  48
6 eights
As numbers get larger, the shortcut saves time. Imagine adding 152 eights.
8  8  8  8  8    8  ?
152 eights
We multiply 8 times 152 using the expanded form of 152.

Write 152 in expanded form.

The exercise can also be performed in column form without expanding the factors.

How & Why
Estimate the product of whole numbers.
The product of two whole numbers can be estimated by using front rounding. With front
rounding we round to the highest place value so that all the digits become 0 except the
ﬁrst one. For example, if we front round 7654 we get 8000.
So to estimate the following product of 78 and 432, front round each factor and
multiply.
432

Front round each factor and multiply.

One use of the estimate is to see if the product is correct. If the calculated product is
not close to 32,000, you should check the multiplication. In this case the actual product is
33,696, which is close to the estimate.

How & Why
Find the area of a rectangle.
The area of a polygon is the measure of the space inside the polygon. We use area when
describing the size of a plot of land, the living space in a house, or an amount of carpet.
Area is measured in square units such as square feet or square meters. A square foot is
literally a square with sides of 1 foot. The measure of the surface inside the square is
1 square foot.
When measuring the space inside a polygon, we divide the space into squares and
count them. For example, consider a rug that is 2 ft by 3 ft (Figure 1.6).

There are six squares in the subdivided rug, so the area of the rug is 6 square feet.
Finding the area of a rectangle, such as the area rug in the example, is relatively easy
because a rectangle has straight sides and it is easy to ﬁt squares inside it. The length of
the rectangle determines how many squares will be in each row, and the width of the rec-
tangle determines the number of rows. In the rug shown in Figure 1.6, there are two rows
of three squares each because the width is 2 ft and the length is 3 ft. The product of the
length and width gives the number of squares inside the rectangle.
Area of a rectangle  length  width
Finding the area of other shapes is a little more complicated, and is discussed in Sec-
tion 7.4.

How & Why
Divide whole numbers.
The division exercise 144  24  ? (read “144 divided by 24”) can be interpreted in one
of two ways.
How many times can 24 be subtracted
This is called the “repeated subtraction”
from 144?
version.
What number times 24 is equal to 144?
This is called the “missing factor” version.
All division problems can be done using repeated subtraction. 
In 144  24  ?, we can ﬁnd the missing factor by repeatedly subtracting
24 from 144:

Divide whole numbers.
VOCABULARY
There are a variety of ways to indicate division. These are the most commonly
used:
72  6
The dividend is the number being divided, so in 54  6  9, the dividend
is 54.
The divisor is the number that we are dividing by, so in 54  6  9, the
divisor is 6.
The quotient is the answer to a division exercise, so in 54  6  9, the
quotient is 9.
When a division exercise does not come out even, as in 61  7, the quotient
is not a whole number.
8
56
5
We call 8 the partial quotient and 5 the remainder. The quotient is written
8 R 5.
761

1.4 Dividing Whole Numbers
The process can be shortened using the traditional method of guessing the number of 24s
and subtracting from 144:
72
3 twenty-fours

4 twenty-fours

3 twenty-fours
or
48
2 twenty-fours

or
144
6 twenty-fours

6
In each case, 144  24  6.
We see that the missing factor in (24)(?)  144 is 6. Because 24(6)  144, conse-
quently 144  24  6.
This leads to a method for checking division. If we multiply the divisor times the
quotient, we will get the dividend. To check 144  24  6, we multiply 24 and 6.
(24)(6)  144
So 6 is correct.
This process works regardless of the size of the numbers. If the divisor is consider-
ably smaller than the dividend, you will want to guess a rather large number.

So, 19,593  63  311.
All divisions can be done by this method. However, the process can be shortened by
ﬁnding the number of groups, starting with the largest place value on the left, in the divi-
dend, and then working toward the right. Study the following example. Note that the an-
swer is written above the problem for convenience.

3117,391
3117,391
6319,593
24144
24144
24144
Working from left to right, we note that 31 does not divide 1, and it does
not divide 17. However, 31 does divide 173 ﬁve times. Write the 5 above the
3 in the dividend. 
5(31)  155. Subtract 155 from 173. Because the difference is less than the
divisor, no adjustment is necessary. Bring down the next digit, which is 9.
Next, 31 divides 189 six times. The 6 is placed above the 9 in the dividend.
6(31)  186. Subtract 186 from 189. Again, no adjustment is necessary,
since 3  31. Bring down the next digit, which is 1. Finally, 31 divides 31
one time. Place the 1 above the one in the dividend. 1(31)  31. Subtract
31 from 31, the remainder is zero. The division is complete.

1.4 Dividing Whole Numbers
55
Not all division problems come out even (have a zero remainder). In
4
84
10
we see that 94 contains 4 twenty-ones and 10 toward the next group of twenty-one. The
answer is written as 4 remainder 10. The word remainder is abbreviated “R” and the re-
sult is 4 R 10.
Check by multiplying (21)(4) and adding the remainder.
(21)(4)  84
84  10  94
So 94  21  4 R 10.
The division, 61  0  ?, can be restated: What number times 0 is 61? 0  ?  61.
According to the multiplication property of zero we know that 0  (any number)  0, so
it cannot equal 61.
2194
C A U T I O N
Division by zero is not deﬁned. It is an operation that cannot be performed.
When dividing by a single-digit number the division can be done mentally using
“short division.”
423
Divide 3 into 12. Write the answer, 4, above the 2 in the dividend. Now divide
the 6 by 3 and write the answer, 2, above the 6. Finally divide the 9 by 3 and
write the answer, 3, above the 9.
The quotient is 423.
If the “mental” division does not come out even, each remainder is used in the next
division.
4 5 2 R 2
13  3  4 R 1. Write the 4 above the 3 in the dividend. Now form a new
number, 15, using the remainder 1 and the next digit 5. Divide 3 into 15.
Write the answer, 5, above 5 in the dividend. Because there is no remainder,
divide the next digit, 8, by 3. The result is 2 R 2. Write this above the 8.
The quotient is 452 R 2.

How & Why
In Section 1.2, the equations involved the inverse operations addition and subtraction.
Multiplication and division are also inverse operations. We can use this idea to solve
equations containing those operations. For example, if 4 is multiplied by 2, 4  2  8, the
product is 8. If the product is divided by 2, 8  2, the result is 4, the original number. In
the same manner, if 12 is divided by 3, 12  3  4, the quotient is 4. If the quotient is
multiplied by 3, 4  3  12, the original number. We use this idea to solve equations in
which the variable is either multiplied or divided by a number.
When a variable is multiplied or divided by a number, the multiplication symbols
( or ) and the division symbol () normally are not written. We write 3x for 3 times x
and 
for x divided by 3.
Consider the following:
5x  30

Division will eliminate multiplication.
x  6
If x in the original equation is replaced by 6, we have
5x  30
5  6  30
30  30
A true statement.
Therefore, the solution is x  6.
Now consider when the variable is divided by a number:
7 
 7  21
Multiplication will eliminate division.
x  147
If x in the original equation is replaced by 147, we have
21  21
A true statement.
Therefore, the solution is x  147.

Whole-Number Exponents and Powers of 10
VOCABULARY
A base is a number used as a repeated factor. An exponent indicates the
number of times the base is used as a factor and is always written as a super-
script to the base. In 23, 2 is the base and 3 is the exponent.
The value of 23 is 8.
An exponent of 2 is often read “squared” and an exponent of 3 is often
read “cubed.”
A power of 10 is the value obtained when 10 is written with an exponent.
How & Why
Find the value of an expression written in
exponential form.
Exponents show repeated multiplication. Whole-number exponents greater than 1 are used
to write repeated multiplications in shorter form. For example,
54 means 5  5  5  5
and since 5  5  5  5  625 we write 54  625. The number 625 is sometimes called the
“fourth power of ﬁve” or “the value of 54.”
EXPONENT

BASE S 54  625 d VALUE
Similarly, the value of 76 is
76  7  7  7  7  7  7  117,649.
The base, the repeated factor, is 7. The exponent, which indicates the number of times the
base is used as a factor, is 6.
The exponent 1 is a special case.
In general, x1  x. So 21  2, 131  13, 71  7, and (413)1  413.
We can see a reason for the meaning of 61(61  6) by studying the following pattern.

One
If 1 is used as an

is equal to the base.
b1  b
To ﬁnd the value of an expression with a natural
number exponent
1. If the exponent is 1, the value is the same as the base.
2. If the exponent is greater than 1, use the base number as a factor as
many times as shown by the exponent. Multiply.
Exponents give us a second way to write an area measurement. Using exponents we can
write 74 square inches as 74 in2. The symbol 74 in2. is still read “seventy-four square
inches.” Also 65 square feet is written as 65 ft2.

How & Why
Multiply or divide a whole number by a power
of 10.
It is particularly easy to multiply or divide a whole number by a power of 10. Consider
the following and their products when multiplied by 10.
4  10  40
9  10  90
17  10  170
88  10  880
The place value of every digit becomes 10 times larger when the number is multiplied
by 10. So to multiply by 10, we need to merely write a zero to the right of the whole
number. If a whole number is multiplied by 10 more than once, a zero is written to the
right for each 10. So
42  103  42,000
Three zeros are written on the right, one for each 10.

Because division is the inverse of multiplication, dividing by 10 will eliminate the
last zero on the right of a whole number. So,
650,000  10  65,000
Eliminate the ﬁnal zero on the right.
If we divide by 10 more than once, one zero is eliminated for each 10. So,
650,000  104  65
Eliminate four zeros on the right.

How & Why
Perform any combination of operations on
whole numbers.
Without a rule it is possible to interpret 6  4  11 in two ways:
6  4  11  6  44
 50
or
6  4  11  10  11
 110
In order to decide which answer to use, we agree to use a standard set of rules. Among
these is the rule that we multiply before adding. So
6  4  11  50
The order in which the operations are performed is important because the order often
determines the answer. Therefore, there is an established order of operations. This estab-
lished order was agreed upon many years ago and is programmed into most of today’s
calculators and computers.

Order of Operations
OBJECTIVE
Perform any combination
of operations on whole 
numbers.
VOCABULARY
Parentheses ( ) and brackets [ ] are used in mathematics as grouping
symbols. These symbols indicate that the operations inside are to be
performed ﬁrst. Other grouping symbols that are often used are braces { }
and the fraction bar —.
Order of Operations
To evaluate an expression
with more than one operation
1. Parentheses—Do the operations within grouping symbols ﬁrst (parentheses,
fraction bar, etc.), in the order given in steps 2, 3, and 4.
2. Exponents—Do the operations indicated by exponents.
3. Multiply and Divide—Do multiplication and division as they appear from
left to right.
4. Add and Subtract—Do addition and subtraction as they appear from left to
right.
So we see that
15  8  2  15  4
Divide ﬁrst.
 11
Subtract.
(18  11)(5)  7(5)
Subtract in parentheses ﬁrst.
 35
Multiply.
84  21  4  4  4
 16
Neither multiplication nor division takes preference over the
other. So do them from left to right.

As you can see, the rules for the order of operations are fairly complicated and it is
important that you learn them all. A standard memory trick is to use the ﬁrst letters to
make an easy-to-remember phrase.
Parentheses
Exponents
Multiplication/Division
Addition/Subtraction
Consider the phrase: Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally. Note that the ﬁrst letters of the
words in this phrase are exactly the same (and in the same order) as the ﬁrst letters for the
order of operations.
Many students use “Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally” to help them remember the
order for operations. Why not give it a try?

Exercises 52–55. To determine the intensity of cardiovascular training, a person needs to know her maximal heart rate (MHR)
and resting heart rate (RHR). The MHR may be approximated by subtracting your age from 220. The RHR can be measured
by sitting quietly for about 15 minutes, then taking your pulse for 15 seconds, and multiplying it by 4. The difference between
the MHR and the RHR is the heart rate reserve (HRR), the number of beats available to go from rest to all-out effort.
To determine a target training rate, divide the HRR by 2 and add the results to the RHR.
52. Jessie is 30 years old and has an RHR of 70 beats per
minute (bpm). Determine her cardiovascular target
training rate.

Recall that we have solved equations involving only one operation. Let’s look at some
equations that involve two operations.
To solve x  5  7, we add 5 to both sides of the equation. To solve 4x  16, we
divide both sides of the equation by 4. The following equation requires both steps.
4x  5  7

How & Why
Find the average of a set of whole numbers.
The average or mean of a set of numbers is used in statistics. It is one of the ways to ﬁnd
the middle of a set of numbers (like the average of a set of test grades). Mathematicians
call the average or mean a “measure of central tendency.” The average of a set of numbers
is found by adding the numbers in the set and then dividing that sum by the number of
numbers in the set. For example, to ﬁnd the average of 11, 21, and 28:
11  21  28  60
Find the sum of the numbers in the set.
60  3  20
Divide the sum by the number of numbers, 3.
The average is 20.
The “central” number or average does not need to be one of the members of the set.
The average, 20, is not a member of the set.

3. Find the mode of a set of
whole numbers.
VOCABULARY
The average, or mean, of a set of numbers is the sum of the set of numbers
divided by the total number of numbers in the set. 
The median of a set of numbers, ordered from smallest to largest, is either the
middle number of the set or the average of the two middle numbers in the set.
The mode of a set of numbers is the number or numbers that appear the
most often in the set.
To ﬁnd the average of a set of whole numbers
1. Add the numbers.
2. Divide the sum by the number of numbers in the set.
Examples A–E

The average is 668.
D. The average of 38, 26, 12, and ? is 28. Find the missing number.
S T R A T E G Y :
Because the average of the four numbers is 28, we know that the sum
of the four numbers is 4(28) or 112. To ﬁnd the missing number, sub-
tract the sum of the three given numbers from 112.
112  (38  26  12)  112  (76)
 36
So the missing number is 36.

How & Why
Find the median of a set of whole numbers.
Another “measure of central tendency” is called the median. The median of a set of num-
bers is a number such that half the numbers in the set are smaller than the median and half
the numbers are larger than the median. If the set is ordered from smallest to largest and
there is an odd number of numbers in the set, the median is literally the middle number.
Consider the set of numbers
3, 35, 41, 46, 50
The median is the middle number, 41.
If the set is ordered from smallest to largest and there is an even number of numbers
in the set, the median is the average (mean) of the two middle numbers. Consider the set
of numbers
4, 6, 9, 13, 15, 30
The median is the average of the middle numbers, 9 and 13.
(9  13)  2  11
The median is 11.
OBJECTIVE 2

1.7 Average, Median, and Mode
93
The median is used when a set of numbers has one or two numbers that are much
larger or smaller than the others. For instance, a basketball player scores the following
points per game over nine games; 32, 30, 32, 5, 33, 28, 33, 7, and 35. The average of the
set is 25, which is near the low end of the set. The median is the middle number, which in
this case is 32, and may give us a better center point.
To ﬁnd the median of a set of numbers
1. List the numbers in order from smallest to largest.
2. If there is an odd number of numbers in the set, the median is the middle
number.
3. If there is an even number of numbers in the set, the median is the average
(mean) of the two middle numbers.

How & Why
Find the mode of a set of whole numbers.
A third “measure of central tendency” is the mode. The mode is the number that occurs
most often in the set. For example, consider
45, 67, 88, 88, 92, 100.
The number that occurs most often is 88, so 88 is the mode.
Each set of numbers has exactly one average and exactly one median. However a set
of numbers can have more than one mode or no mode at all. See Examples I and J.
OBJECTIVE 3
Examples F–G
Warm-Ups F–G
DIRECTIONS:
Find the median of the set of whole numbers.
S T R A T E G Y :
List the numbers from smallest to largest. If there is an odd number of
numbers in the set, choose the middle number. If there is an even
number of numbers in the set, ﬁnd the average of the two middle
numbers.
F. Find the median of 37, 25, 46, 39, 22, 64, and 80.
22, 25, 37, 39, 46, 64, 80
List the numbers from smallest to largest.
The median is 39.
Because there is an odd number of numbers in the set,
the median is the middle number.
G. Find the median of 88, 56, 74, 40, 29, 123, 81, and 9.
9, 29, 40, 56, 74, 81, 88, 123
List the numbers from smallest to largest.
The median is 65.
 65

Because there is an even number of numbers in the set, the
median is the average of the two middle numbers, 56 and 74.
F. Find the median of 103, 77,
113, 94, and 55.
G. Find the median of 147, 160,
111, 85, 137, and 287.
To ﬁnd the mode of a set of numbers
1. Find the number or numbers that occur most often.
2. If all the numbers occur the same number of times, there is no mode.

Drawing and Interpreting Graphs
OBJECTIVES
1. Read data from bar,
pictorial, and line graphs.
2. Construct a bar or line
graph.
VOCABULARY
Graphs are used to illustrate sets of numerical information.
A bar graph uses solid lines or heavy bars of ﬁxed length to represent numbers
from a set. Bar graphs contain two scales, a vertical scale and a horizontal
scale. The vertical scale represents one set of values and the horizontal
scale represents a second set of values. These depend on the information to be
presented. The bar graph in Figure 1.7 illustrates four types of cars (ﬁrst set of
values) and the number of each type of car sold (second set of values).
A line graph uses lines connecting points to represent numbers from a set. A
line graph has a vertical and a horizontal scale, like a bar graph. A line graph
showing the percentage of women in real estate is shown in Figure 1.8.
A pictograph uses symbols or simple drawings to represent numbers from a
set. The pictograph in Figure 1.9 shows the distribution of mathematics
students at a community college.

Figure 1.10
The vertical scale shows dollar values and is divided into units of $200. The horizontal
scale shows days of the week. From the graph we see that
1. Friday had the greatest sales (highest bar), with $1800 in sales.
2. Thursday had the least sales (lowest bar), with sales of $1000.
3. Monday’s sales appear to be $1500 (the bar falls between the scale divisions). 
4. Friday had $600 more in sales than those for Wednesday.
5. The total sales for the week were $7100.
Some advantages of displaying data with a graph:
1. Each person can easily ﬁnd the data most useful to him or her.
2. The visual display is easy for most people to read.
3. Some questions can be answered by a quick look at the graph. For example,
“What day does the Eatery need the least staff?”

1.8 Drawing and Interpreting Graphs
How & Why
Construct a bar or line graph.
Let us construct a bar graph to show variations in the heating bill for the Morales Family.
The data are shown in Table 1.4.
To draw and label the bar graph for these data, we show the cost on the vertical scale
and the months on the horizontal scale. This is a logical display because we will most
likely be asked to ﬁnd the highest and lowest monthly heating costs and a vertical display
of numbers is easier to read than a horizontal display of numbers. This is the typical way
bar graphs are displayed. Be sure to write the labels on the vertical and horizontal scales
as soon as you have chosen how the data will be displayed. Now title the graph so that the
reader will recognize the data it contains.
The next step is to construct the two scales of the graph. Because each monthly total
is divisible by 25, we choose multiples of 25 for the vertical scale. We could have chosen
one unit for the vertical scale, but the bars would be very long and the graph would take
up a lot of space. If we had chosen a larger scale, for instance 100, then the graph might
be too compact and we would need to ﬁnd fractional values on the scale. It is easier to
draw the graph if we use a scale that divides each unit of data. The months are displayed
on the horizontal scale. Be sure to draw the bars with uniform width, because each of
them represents the cost for one month. A vertical display of between 5 and 12 units is
typical. The vertical display should start with zero. See Figure 1.11.
Figure 1.11 
We stop the vertical scale at 200 because the maximum heating cost to be displayed
is $200. The next step is to draw the bars. Start by ﬁnding the cost for January. The cost
was $200 for January, so we draw the bar for January until the height of 200 is reached.
This is the top of the bar. Now draw the solid bar for January. See Figure 1.12.

A line graph is similar to a bar graph in that it has vertical and horizontal scales. The data
are represented by points rather than bars, and the points are connected by line segments.
We use a line graph to display the data in Table 1.5.

The vertical scale represents the tax rate, and each unit represents $2. This requires using
a half space for the $15.00 rate.
Another possibility is to use a vertical scale in which each unit represents $1, but this
would require 20 units on the vertical scale and would make the graph much taller. We opt
to save space by using $2 units on the vertical scale. See Figure 1.14.

GOOD ADVICE FOR STUDYING
New Habits from Old
I
f you are in the habit of studying math by only reading the examples to learn how to
do the exercises, stop now! Instead, read the assigned section—all of it—before
class. It is important that you read more than the examples so that you fully understand
the concepts. Knowing how to do a problem isn’t all that needs to be learned. Know-
ing where and when to use speciﬁc skills is also essential.
When you read, read interactively. This means that you should be both writing and
thinking about what you are reading. Write down new vocabulary; perhaps start a list
of new terms paraphrased in words that are clear to you. Take notes on the How & Why
segments, jotting down questions you may have, for example. As you read examples,
work the Warm-Up problems in the margin. Begin the exercise set only when you un-
derstand what you have read in the section. This process should make your study ses-
sions go much faster and be more effective.
If you have written down questions during your study session, be sure to ask them
at the next class session, seek help from a tutor, or discuss them with a classmate. Don’t
leave these questions unanswered.
Pay particular attention to the objectives at the beginning of each section. Read these
at least twice: ﬁrst, when you do your reading before class and again, after attending
class. Ask yourself, “Do I understand what the purpose of this section is?” Read the
objectives again before test time to see if you feel that you have met these objectives.
During your study session, if you notice yourself becoming tense and your breath-
ing shallow (light and from your throat or upper part of your lungs), follow this simple
coping strategy. Say to yourself, “I’m in control. Relax and take a deep breath.” Breathe
deeply and properly by relaxing your stomach muscle (that’s right, you have permission
to let your stomach protrude!) and inhaling so that the air reaches the bottom of your
lungs. Hold the air in for a few seconds; then slowly exhale, pulling your stomach mus-
cle in as you exhale. This easy exercise not only strengthens your stomach muscle but
gives your body and brain the oxygen you need to perform free from physical stress and
anxiety. This deep breathing relaxation method can be done in 1 to 5 minutes. You may
want to use it several times a day, especially during an exam.
These techniques can help you to start studying math more effectively and to begin
managing your anxiety. Begin today.

Mathematicians have always been fascinated by numbers—their structure and
their uses. All the other chapters in this textbook explain ways to use numbers.
This chapter explores the structure of counting numbers. The structure of the
counting numbers—their basic building blocks—is similar in nature to the
concept of all molecules being made up of atoms of the basic elements. As a
molecule of water is formed from two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of
oxygen, H2O, so the number 12 is made up of two factors of 2 and one factor
of 3, that is 12  2  2  3.
Throughout the history of humanity, people have studied different sets of
numbers. Some groups have even attributed magical powers to certain num-
bers (“lucky seven”) or groups of numbers because of some special properties.
We investigate here the notion of a “magic square.” Magic squares are
arrangements of the numbers 1–4, or 1–9, or 1–16, or 1–25, or 1–any number
squared. These numbers are written in square arrays that are 2  2, or 3  3,
or 4  4, and so on. The numbers are placed so that the sum of each row and of
each column and of each diagonal is the same. Figure 2.1 shows an example
of a 3  3 magic square, which uses the numbers from 1 to 9 (32).

spirits.

Benjamin Franklin was a big fan of magic squares. As clerk to the Pennsylvania
Assembly, he admitted to creating them when he was bored with the proceedings. He cre-
ated more and more complex squares as time passed. He even experimented with magic
circles. Figure 2.2 shows an 8  8 square, using the numbers from 1 to 64 (82), that
Franklin created. This square has several interesting features.

VOCABULARY
A whole number is divisible by another whole number if the quotient of
these numbers is a natural number and the remainder is 0. The second num-
ber is said to be a divisor of the ﬁrst. Thus, 7 is a divisor of 42, because
42  7  6.
We also say 42 is divisible by 7.
The even digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
The odd digits are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.

HOW & WHY
Determine whether a natural number is divisible
by 2, 3, or 5.
To ask if a number is divisible by 3 is to ask if the division of the number by 3 comes out
even (has no remainder). We can answer this question by doing the division and checking
to see that there is no remainder. Or, we can bypass the division by using divisibility tests.
For many numbers we can answer questions about divisibility mentally. Table 2.1 pro-
vides clues for some of these tests.

In the second column (Multiply by 2), the ones digit of each number is an even digit,
that is either 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Because the ones place is even, the number itself is also even.
In the third column (Multiply by 3), the sum of the digits of each number in the
column is divisible by 3. For example, the sum of the digits of 48 (16  3) is 4  8 or 12,
and 12 is divisible by 3. Likewise, the sum of the digits of 198 is divisible by 3 because
1  9  8 is 18. 
In the fourth column (Multiply by 5), the ones digit of each number is 0 or 5.

DIRECTIONS:
Determine whether the natural number is divisible by 2, 3, or 5.
S T R A T E G Y :
First check the ones-place digit. If it is even, the number is divisible
by 2. If it is 0 or 5, the number is divisible by 5. Next ﬁnd the sum of
the digits. If the sum is divisible by 3, the number is divisible by 3.
A. Is 42 divisible by 2, 3, or 5?
42 is divisible by 2.
The ones-place digit is 2.
42 is divisible by 3.
4  2  6, which is divisible by 3.
42 is not divisible by 5.
The ones-place digit is neither 0 nor 5.
B. Is 210 divisible by 2, 3, or 5?
210 is divisible by 2.
The ones-place digit is 0.
210 is divisible by 3.
2  1  0  3, which is divisible by 3.
210 is divisible by 5.
The ones-place digit is 0.
C. Is 721 divisible by 2, 3, or 5?
721 is not divisible by 2.
The ones-place digit is not even.
721 is not divisible by 3.
7  2  1  10, which is not divisible by 3.
721 is not divisible by 5.
The ones-place digit is neither 0 nor 5.
D. Georgio and Anna and their three children are on a trip of Japan. Anna has a total of
¥ 585 to divide among the children. She wants each child to receive the same number
of yen in whole numbers. Is this possible? Why or why not?
Yes, each child will receive the same number of yen in whole numbers (¥ 195
each) because 585 is divisible by 3.
HOW & WHY
Determine whether a natural
number is divisible by 6, 9, or 10.
In Table 2.1, some numbers appear in both the Multiply by 2 column and the Multiply by
3 column. These numbers are divisible by 6. Because 6  2  3, every number divisible
by 6 must also be divisible by 2 and 3. For example, 132 is divisible by both 2 and 3.
Therefore, it is also divisible by 6.
In the Multiply by 9 column, the sum of the digits of each number is divisible by 9.
For example, the sum of the digits in 36 is 3  6, or 9, which is divisible by 9. Also, the
sum of the digits in 981 is 9  8  1, or 18, which is divisible by 9.
Notice that, because 0 is even, all natural numbers ending in 0 are divisible by 2.
They are also divisible by 5 because they end in 0. These numbers are also divisible by
10. These numbers appear in both the Multiply by 2 column and the Multiply by 5 col-
umn. The numbers 20, 90, and 130 are all divisible by 10.

HOW & WHY
Determine whether a given whole number is a
multiple of another whole number.
If one number is a multiple of another number, the ﬁrst must be divisible by the second.
To determine whether 870 is a multiple of 6, we check to see if 870 is divisible by 6; that is,
check to see whether 870 is divisible by both 2 and 3.
852
Divisible by 2 because the ones-place digit is even (2).
852
Divisible by 3 because 8  5  2  15, which is divisible by 3.
So 852 is a multiple of 6.

810 is divisible by 3.
The sum of the digits, 8  1  0  9, is divisible by 3.
810 is divisible by 5.
The ones-place digit is 0.
Long division gives the same result because 810  15  54.
So 810 is a multiple of 15.

2.3 Divisors and Factors
151
How & Why
Write a counting number as the product of two
factors in all possible ways.
Finding the factors of a number can be visualized using blocks, pennies, or other small ob-
jects. To illustrate, let’s examine the factors of 12. Arrange 12 blocks or squares in a rectan-
gle. The rectangle will have an area of 12 square units. The length and width of the rectangle
are factors of 12. For instance, Figure 2.3 shows a rectangle with 3 rows of 4 squares.
OBJECTIVE 1
2.3
Divisors and Factors
OBJECTIVES
1. Write a counting number
as the product of two
factors in all possible
ways.
2. List all of the factors 
(divisors) of a counting
number.
VOCABULARY
The product of two numbers is a multiple of each. The two numbers are
called factors. Thus, 8 and 5 are factors of 40 because 8  5  40.
Recall that 122  12  12  144, so the square of 12 is 144. The number
144 is called a perfect square.
When two or more numbers are multiplied, each number is a factor of the
product. If a number is a factor of a second number, it is also a divisor of the
second number.
Figure 2.3
Figure 2.4
Figure 2.4 shows that 2  6  12, so 2 and 6 are also factors of 12.
Because 3  4  12, 3 and 4 are factors of 12. Figure 2.4 shows the same 12 squares
arranged into a different rectangle.
5
8
10
7

11
Figure 2.6
Figure 2.5 shows a third arrangement: 1  12  12, so 1 and 12 are factors of 12.
Figure 2.6 shows that the results of using rows of 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 do not form rectangles.
Figure 2.5

We conclude that the only pairs of factors of 12 are 1  12, 2  6, and 3  4.
To write a larger number, say 250, as the product of two factors in all possible ways,
we could again draw rectangles, or divide 250 by every number smaller than 250. Either
method takes too long. The following steps save time.
1. List all the counting numbers from 1 to the ﬁrst number whose square is larger than
250. Because 15  15  225 and 16  16  256, we stop at 16.

To use the square method to write a counting 
number as the product of two factors in all 
possible ways
1. List all the counting numbers from 1 to the ﬁrst number whose square is
larger than the given number.
2. For each number on the list, test whether the number is a divisor of the
given number.
3. If the number is not a divisor, cross it and all of its multiples off the list.
4. If the number is a divisor, write the indicated product of the two factors.
The ﬁrst factor is the tested number; the second factor is the quotient.

We can stop at 16 because 250 divided by
any number larger than 16 gives a quotient
that is less than 16. But all the possible
factors less than 16 are already in the chart.
When you ﬁnd a number that is not a
factor, you can also eliminate all the
multiples of that number. For example,
because 3 is not a factor of 250, we can
also eliminate 6, 9,12, and 15.
We can stop at 10 because 102  100, which is
larger than 98.

Exercises 65–68 relate to the chapter application.
Numbers fascinated the ancient Greeks, in part because every Greek letter has a number associated with it. In particular,
each Greek name had its own number and everyone was very interested in the properties of the number for his or her name.
An exceptional individual was one whose number was a perfect number. A perfect number is a number that is the sum of
all its divisors, excluding the number itself. Historical note: The Greeks did not consider a number to be a divisor of itself,
although today we do.

making sure each person chooses a different whole
number. Have each person with a even number divide

Primes and Composites
OBJECTIVE
Determine whether a
whole number is prime or
composite.
VOCABULARY
A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two factors
(divisors).
The two factors are the number 1 and the number itself.
A composite number is a whole number greater than 1 with more than
two factors (divisors).
How & Why
Determine whether a whole number is
prime or composite.
The whole numbers zero (0) and one (1) are neither prime nor composite. The number 2 is
the ﬁrst prime number 
, because 1 and 2 are the only factors of 2. The number
3 
is also prime because 1 and 3 are its only factors. The number 4 is a com-
posite number (
and 
) because 4 has more than two factors.
To determine whether a number is prime or composite, list its factors or divisors in a
chart like those in Section 2.3. Then count the number of factors. For instance, the chart
for 247 is
14
15
16
Therefore, 247 is a composite number.
The chart for 311 is
Stop here since 18  18  324 and 324  311.
The number 311 is a prime number because it has exactly two factors, 1 and itself.
All prime numbers up to any given number may be found by a method called
the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Eratosthenes (born ca. 230 B.C.) is remembered for both the
prime Sieve and his method of measuring the circumference of Earth. The accuracy of his
measurement, compared with modern methods, is within 50 miles, or six-tenths of 1%.
To use the famous Sieve to ﬁnd all the primes from 2 to 35, list the numbers from 2 to 35.

factors, we stop at 13 because we know that
247 has at least four factors.

The prime numbers less than 35 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31.
Looking at the Sieve, we see that we can shorten the factor chart by omitting all num-
bers except those that are prime. For example, is 413 prime or composite?
Stop here, since we do not need all the factors.
The number 413 is composite, because it has at least four factors, 1, 7, 59, and 413. We
know that a number is prime if no smaller prime number divides it evenly.
Keep the divisibility tests for 2, 3, and 5 in mind since they are prime numbers

The number 187 is a composite number.
C. Is 241 prime or composite?
Test 1 and the prime numbers from 2 to 17.
Stop at 17 because 172  241.
After testing all prime numbers in the list, we see that 241 has only two factors, 1 and
itself. So 241 is a prime number.
D. Is 481 prime or composite?
Test 1 and the prime numbers from 2 to 23.
So 481 is a composite number.
E. Is 124,653 prime or composite?
124,653 is divisible by 3
We have at least three factors, 1, 3, and 124,653.
So 124,653 is a composite number.

How & Why
Find the prime factorization of a counting
number by repeated division.
In chemistry, we learn that every compound in the world is made up of a particular com-
bination of basic elements. For instance, salt is NaCl and water is H2O. This means that
every molecule of salt contains one atom of sodium (Na) and one atom of chlorine (Cl).
Sodium and chlorine are two of the basic elements. Similarly, every molecule of water is
made up of two atoms of hydrogen (H) and one of oxygen (O), which are also basic
elements. The chemical formula tells how many units of each basic element are needed to
make the compound.
In mathematics, the basic elements are the prime numbers. Every counting number
(except 1) is either prime or a unique combination of prime factors. Finding the prime
factorization of a composite number is comparable to ﬁnding the chemical formula for
a compound. The prime factorization simply allows us to see the basic elements of a
number.
To ﬁnd a prime factorization, repeatedly divide by prime numbers until the quotient
is 1. The prime factorization is the product of the prime divisors. We begin by dividing the
given number by 2 repeatedly, until the quotient is odd. Then we divide by 3, 5, 7, 11. . .
to check for other prime factors. To save time and space, we do not rewrite the division
problem each time. Instead, divide each quotient, starting at the top and dividing down
until the quotient is 1. The division is shown for the number 108.

To ﬁnd the prime factorization of a counting
number using repeated division
1. Divide the counting number and each following quotient by a prime
number until the quotient is 1. Begin with 2 and divide until the quotient
is odd, then divide by 3. Divide by 3 until the quotient is not a multiple
of 3. Continue with 5, 7, and so on, testing the prime numbers in order.
2. Write the indicated product of all the divisors.

How & Why
Find the prime factorization of a counting
number using the Tree Method.
Another method for ﬁnding the prime factorization is the Tree Method. We draw “factor
branches” from a given number using any two factors of the number. We then draw addi-
tional branches from the end of each original branch by using factors of the number at the
end of the branch. A branch stops splitting when it ends in a prime number. Figure 2.7
shows the Tree Method to prime factor 140.

There are often different trees for the same number. Examine the two trees in Fig-
ure 2.8 used to ﬁnd the prime factorization of 140.

2.6 Least Common Multiple
OBJECTIVES
1. Find the least common
multiple (LCM) of two or
more whole numbers
using the Individual
Prime-Factoring Method.
2. Find the least common
multiple (LCM) of two or
more whole numbers
using the Group
Prime-Factoring Method.
VOCABULARY
The least common multiple of two or more whole numbers is
1. the smallest natural number that is a multiple of each whole number, and
2. the smallest natural number that has each whole number as a factor, and
3. the smallest natural number that has each whole number as a divisor, and
4. the smallest natural number that each whole number will divide evenly.
The abbreviation of least common multiple is LCM.
How & Why
Find the least common multiple (LCM) of two or
more whole numbers using the Individual Prime-
Factoring Method.
The factorizations of this chapter are most often used to simplify fractions and ﬁnd LCMs.
LCMs are used to compare, add, and subtract fractions. In algebra, LCMs are useful in
equation solving.
We can ﬁnd the LCM of 21 and 35 by listing the multiples of both and ﬁnding the
smallest value common to both lists:
Multiples of 21: 21, 42, 63, 84, 105 , 126, 147, 168, 189, 210 , 231,
Multiples of 35: 35, 70, 105 , 140, 175, 210 , 245, 280, 315, 650,
The LCM of 12 and 35 is 105 because it is the smallest multiple in both lists. This fact can
be stated in four equivalent ways.
1. 105 is the smallest natural number that is a multiple of both 21 and 35.
2. 105 is the smallest natural number that has both 21 and 35 as factors.
3. 105 is the smallest natural number that has both 21 and 35 as divisors.
4. 105 is the smallest natural number that both 21 and 35 will divide evenly.
Finding the LCM by this method has a big drawback: you might have to list hundreds of
multiples to ﬁnd it. For this reason we look for a shortcut.
To ﬁnd the LCM of 18 and 24, write the prime factorization of each. Write these
prime factors in columns, so that the prime factors of 24 are under the prime factors of 18.
Leave blank spaces for prime factors that do not match.

How & Why
Find the least common multiple (LCM) of two
or more whole numbers using the Group Prime-
Factoring Method.
A second method for ﬁnding the LCM is sometimes referred to as the Group Prime-
Factoring Method. To use this method with two numbers, ﬁnd a prime number that will
divide both. If there is none, multiply the two numbers. The product is the LCM of the
two numbers. Continue dividing by primes until no prime will divide the quotients. The
product of all of the divisors and the remaining quotients is the LCM. For example, ﬁnd
the LCM of 18 and 24.

OPTIONAL
In the early 1200s, the Italian mathematician Leonardo de Pisa, also known as
Fibonacci, was interested in a set of numbers that bear his name. The set begins {1, 1, 2,
3, 5, . . .} and continues inﬁnitely using the rule that the next number in the set is the sum
of the previous two.
1. Mathematicians often name numbers of a set according to the order in which they
occur. For the Fibonacci numbers, it is customary to designate Fn as the nth element of
the set. So F3  2 and F4  3. Calculate all the Fibonacci numbers less than 500. Make
a table that lists them in order along with their name.
2. The Fibonacci numbers are strongly related to items in nature that spiral, such as the
cells on pineapples or the petals on pinecones. The number of spirals in normal speci-
mens is always a Fibonacci number, although the number changes from species to
species. Find two whole pineapples and two pinecones from different kinds of trees.
Look at each item from the top and count the spirals that move clockwise. Then count
the spirals that move counterclockwise. Record your results in the table below. Write
a paragraph that summarizes your ﬁndings.
Number of
Number of
Item
Clockwise Spirals
Counterclockwise Spirals
Pineapple 1
Pineapple 2
Pinecone 1
Pinecone 2
3. Just as each number has a unique prime factorization, each number can also be written
as the sum of Fibonacci numbers. Always start with the largest Fibonacci number less
than the given number, then go to the largest Fibonacci number less than the differ-
ence, and continue until the whole number is accounted for. For example,
46  34  12 
 34  8  4 
 34  8  3  1
Make a table that gives each number from 1 to 50 as the sum of Fibonacci numbers.
4. The game of Fibonacci Nim is an easy game in which players take turns removing
chips from a central pot. You may start with any number of chips. Each player must
take at least one chip out of the pile but not more than twice the number just removed
by his opponent. (The ﬁrst player may not remove all the chips on the ﬁrst move.) The
player who takes the last chip(s) wins. Start with 20 chips and play Nim ﬁve times.
What do you notice about the number of chips remaining just before the game was
won?
5. A winning strategy is to take the smallest Fibonacci number in the sum of Fibonacci
numbers that makes the number of chips remaining. For example, if 46 chips are
remaining, then one chip should be taken, because 46  34  8  3  1. Play Nim
ﬁve more times starting with 20 chips and using this strategy. Did it work? If both
players use the strategy, which player will win? Write a paragraph summarizing how
to win at Nim.

GOOD ADVICE FOR STUDYING
Managing Anxiety
F
or those of you who become anxious as you begin to study, we recommend that
you devote a section in your math notebook to record your thoughts and feelings
each time you study. Record your thoughts in the ﬁrst person, as “I-statements.” For
example, “Nobody ever uses this stuff in real life,” rephrased as an I-statement, it would
be: “I would like to know where I would use this in my life.” Research shows that a
positive attitude is the single most important key to your success in mathematics. By
recognizing negative thoughts and replacing them with positive thoughts, you are
beginning to work on changing your attitude. The ﬁrst step is to become aware of your
self-talk.
Negative self-talk falls into three categories of irrational beliefs that you have about
yourself and how you view the world. You think that (1) Worrying helps. Wrong. Worrying
leads to excessive anxiety, which is distracting and hinders performance. (2) Your worth as
a person is determined by your performance. Wrong. Not being able to solve math
problems doesn’t mean you won’t amount to anything. If you think it does, you are a
victim of “catastrophizing.” (3) You are the only one who feels anxious. Wrong. By think-
ing that other students have some magical coping skills that allow them to avoid anxiety,
you are comparing yourself to some irrational mythical norm.
As you begin your ﬁrst section, ask yourself such questions as What am I saying to
myself now? What is triggering these thoughts? How do I feel physically? and What
emotions am I feeling now? Your answers will likely reveal a pattern to your thoughts
and feelings. You need to analyze your statements and change them into more positive
and rational self-talk. You can use a simple technique called “rational emotive therapy.”1
This method, if practiced regularly, can quickly and effectively change the way you think
and feel about math. When you ﬁnd yourself getting upset, watch for words such as
“should,” “must,” “ought to,” “never,” “always,” and “I can’t.” They are clues to
negative self-talk and signals for you to direct your attention back to math. Use the
following ABCD model.
A. Triggering event: You start to do your math homework and your mind goes blank.
B. Negative self-talk in response to the trigger: “I can’t do math. I’ll never pass. My life
is ruined!”
C. Anxiety caused by the negative self-talk: panic, anger, tight neck, etc.
D. Positive self-talk to cope with anxiety: “This negative self-talk is distracting. It doesn’t
help me solve these problems. Focus on the problems.”; or say, “I may be uncom-
fortable, but I’m working on it.”
Recognize that negative self-talk (B) is the culprit. It causes the anxiety (C) and must
be restructured to positive rational statements (D). Practice with the model using your
own self-talk statements (B) and then complete the remaining steps.

A P P L I C A T I O N
Shane is building a cedar deck in back of his house. His plans include stairs at one
end of the deck and planter boxes on one side. See Figure 3.1.
Shane would like to keep the sawing to a minimum, as he has only a hand-
held circular saw, so he decides that he will design the deck so that he can use
standard lengths of lumber. When he goes to Home Depot to purchase the lumber,
the ﬁrst thing he learns is that the standard sizes of lumber do not coincide with
the actual size of the boards. For instance, a 10 ft 2-by-4 would seem to imply that
its dimensions are 10 ft long, 4 in. wide, and 2 in. deep. However, the actual dimensions
are 10 ft long, 31⁄2 in. wide, and 11⁄2 in. deep. (The reduction in dimensions happens when
the rough cut lumber is “surfaced.”) This means Shane will have to recalculate what he
needs. He had been planning to use 2-by-4s for the deck boards. Now that he knows they
are only 31⁄2 in. wide instead of 4 in. wide, he will need more of them than he originally
planned. Table 3.1 shows the actual sizes of all the lumber Shane needs for the deck.

Group Discussion
Use a tape measure to determine the dimensions of the room you are in using inches.
Make a drawing of all four walls, including doors and windows. Measure as accurately as
you can (specifying fractions of an inch). When you have ﬁnished, compare your mea-
surements to those of another group. Are they identical? Why or why not? How can you
determine which group has the most accurate measurements?

3.1 Proper and Improper Fractions; Mixed Numbers
VOCABULARY
A fraction
is a name for a number. The upper numeral
(5) is the numerator. The lower numeral (9) is the denominator.
A proper fraction is one in which the numerator is less than the 
denominator 
.
An improper fraction is one in which the numerator is not less than the 
denominator 
.
A mixed number is the sum of a whole number and a fraction 
with the addition sign omitted 
. The fraction part is usually a proper
fraction.

OBJECTIVES
1. Write a fraction to
describe the parts of 
a unit.
2. Select proper or improper
fractions from a list of
fractions.
3. Change improper
fractions to mixed

4. Change mixed numbers

How & Why
Write a fraction to describe the parts of a unit.
A unit (here we use a rectangle) may be divided into smaller parts of equal size in order
to picture a fraction. The rectangle in Figure 3.2 is divided into seven parts, and six of 
the parts are shaded. The fraction 
represents the shaded part. The denominator (7) tells 
the number of parts in the unit. The numerator (6) tells the number of shaded parts. The 
fraction 
represents the part that is not shaded.

Because fractions are another way of writing a division problem and because divi-
sion by zero is not deﬁned, the denominator can never be zero. There will always be at
least one part in a unit.
The unit many also be shown on a ruler. The fraction 
represents the distance from
0 to the arrowhead in Figure 3.3.

How & Why
Select proper or improper fractions from a list of
fractions.
Fractions are called “proper” if the numerator is smaller than the denominator. If the nu-
merator is equal to or greater than the denominator, the fractions are called “improper.”
So in the list
the proper fractions are 
and 
. The improper fractions are 
and 
.
If the numerator and the denominator are equal, as in 
, the value of the fraction is 1.
This is easy to see from a picture because the entire unit is shaded. Improper fractions
have a value that is greater than or equal to 1. Proper fractions have a value that is less
than 1 because some part of the unit is not shaded. See Table 3.2.

How & Why
Change mixed numbers to improper fractions.
Despite the value judgment attached to the name “improper,” in many cases improper
fractions are a more convenient and useful form than mixed numbers. Thus, it is impor-
tant to be able to convert mixed numbers to improper fractions.
Every mixed number can be changed to an improper fraction. See Figure 3.6.

3.2 Simplifying Fractions
209
How & Why
Simplify a fraction.
Fractions are equivalent if they represent the same quantity. When we compare the two
units in Figure 3.7, we see that each is divided into four parts. The shaded part on the 
left is named , whereas the shaded part on the right is labeled . It is clear that the two 
are the same size, and therefore we say 
.

OBJECTIVE
VOCABULARY
Equivalent fractions are fractions that are the different names for the same
number.
Simplifying a fraction is the process of renaming it by using a smaller
numerator and denominator.
A fraction is completely simpliﬁed when its numerator and denominator 
have no common factors other than 1. For instance,

How & Why
Divide fractions.
In Chapter 1, you learned that division is the inverse of multiplication; that is, the quotient
of a division problem is the number that is multiplied times the divisor (second number)
to get the dividend. For example, the quotient of 
is 7. When 7 is multiplied by the
divisor, 3, the product is 21, the dividend.
21  3
OBJECTIVE 3

Another way of thinking of division is to ask “How many groups of a given size are
contained in a number?”
Think
Answer
21  3
How many 3s in 21?
7
How many 
s in ?

3.3 Multiplying and Dividing Fractions
To divide fractions
Multiply the ﬁrst fraction by the reciprocal of the divisor; that is, invert the
divisor and multiply.

The quotient can also be found by multiplying 
by the reciprocal of 
. This is the
customary shortcut.

called a protractor. It is also necessary to convert the fractions of the components into equivalent fractions with denominators

How & Why
We have previously solved equations in which variables (letters) are either multiplied or
divided by whole numbers. We performed the inverse operations to solve for the variable.
To eliminate multiplication, we divide by the number being multiplied. To eliminate divi-
sion, we multiply by the number that is the divisor. Now we solve equations in which vari-
ables are multiplied by fractions. Recall from Chapter 1 that if a number is multiplied 
by a variable, there is usually no multiplication sign between them. For example, 2x is 
understood to mean 2 times x, and 
means 
times x. However, we usually do not write  
. Instead, we write this as 
. We can do this because
While we usually write 
instead of 
for convenience we may use either of these
forms. Recall that 
means the product of 2 and x divided by 3.

VOCABULARY
Recall that equivalent fractions are fractions that are different names for the
same number. For instance, 
and 
are equivalent because both represent
one-half 
of a unit. Two or more fractions have a common denomina-
tor when they have the same denominator.

How & Why
Rename fractions by multiplying by 1 in the form
.
The process of renaming fractions is often referred to as “building fractions.” Building a
fraction means renaming the fraction by multiplying both numerator and denominator by
a common factor. This process is often necessary when we add and subtract fractions.
We “build fractions” to a common denominator so they can be compared, added, or sub-
tracted. Building fractions is the opposite of “simplifying” fractions.

Build a fraction by ﬁnding the missing numerator.
To ﬁnd the missing numerator in
divide 30 by 5 to ﬁnd out what form of 1 to multiply by.
30  5  6.
The correct factor (multiplier) is . So
The shortcut is to write 30, the target denominator. Then multiply the original 
numerator, 4, by 6, the quotient of the target denominator and the original denominator.
The fractions 
and

If fractions to be compared do not have a common denominator, then one or more
can be renamed so that all have a common denominator. The preferred common 
denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of all the denominators.
To list 
and 
from smallest to largest, we write each with a common 
denominator. Then we compare the numerators. The LCM of the denominators is 16. We
build each fraction so that is has a denominator of 16.
We arrange the fractions with denominator 16 in order from smallest to largest 
according the values of the numerators.
Next, replace each fraction by the original, so
The original fractions are listed in order from smallest to largest.

How & Why
Add like fractions.
What is the sum of and ? The denominators tell us the number of parts in the unit. The 
numerators tell us how many of these parts are shaded. By adding the numerators we ﬁnd
the total number of shaded parts. The common denominator keeps track of the size of the
parts. See Figure 3.15.

How & Why
Add mixed numbers.
What is the sum of 
and

OBJECTIVE
OBJECTIVE
Add mixed numbers.
It is easy to see that the sum contains eight whole units. The sum of the fraction parts
requires ﬁnding a common denominator. The LCM of 6 and 4 is 12. Figure 3.19 shows
the divided rectangles.
3.7 Adding Mixed Numbers
So the sum is 
.
Mixed numbers can be added horizontally or in columns. The sum of 
and 
is shown
both ways.
When we write the sum vertically, the grouping of the whole numbers and the frac-
tions takes place naturally.

The ledger board is a beam that supports the joists on one end. Shane is using 2  12s for the joists. Beginning on one end,
there is a pair of joists right next to each other that are called the rim joists (for extra strength at the edge of the deck). The rest
of the joists are laid out “16 in. on center,” meaning that from the center of one joist to the center of the next joist is 16 in. See 
Figure 3.20.

Subtract mixed numbers.
A subtraction problem may be written in horizontal or vertical form. Horizontally:
Vertically:
The process is similar to that for adding mixed numbers.
It is sometimes necessary to “borrow” from the whole number in order to subtract the
fractions. For example,
Because we cannot subtract 
from 
, we need to “borrow.” To do this we rename 
by “borrowing” 1 from 8.
Borrow 1 from 8 and add it to the fraction part.
Change the mixed number, 
, to an improper fraction.

One of the major applications of statistics is their value in predicting future occurrences.
Before the future can be predicted, statisticians study what has happened in the past and
look for patterns. If a pattern can be detected, and it is reasonable to assume that nothing
will happen to interrupt the pattern, then it is a relatively easy matter to predict the future
simply by continuing the pattern. Insurance companies, for instance, study the occur-
rences of trafﬁc accidents among various groups of people. Once they have identiﬁed a
pattern, they use this to predict future accident rates, which in turn are used to set insur-
ance rates. When a group, such as teenaged boys, is identiﬁed as having a higher inci-
dence of accidents, their insurance rates are set higher.
Dice
While predicting accident rates is a very complicated endeavor, there are other activities
for which the patterns are relatively easy to ﬁnd. Take, for instance, the act of rolling a die.
The die has six sides, marked 1 to 6. Theoretically, each side has an equal chance of end-
ing in the up position after a roll. Fill in the following table by rolling a die 120 times.
Side Up
1
2
3
4
5
6
Times 
Rolled
Theoretically, each side will be rolled the same number of times as the others. Since you
rolled the die 120 times and there were six possible outcomes, each side should come up
times. How close to 20 are your outcomes in the table? What do you sup-
pose are reasons for not getting a perfectly distributed table?
Mathematicians are likely to express the relationships in this situation using the con-
cept of probability, which is a measure of the likelihood of a particular event occurring.
We describe the probability of an event with a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is
the number of different ways the desired event can occur and the denominator of the frac-
tion is the total number of possible outcomes. So the probability of rolling a 2 on the die
is 
because there is only one way to roll a 2 but there are 6 possible outcomes when 
rolling a die. What is the probability of rolling a 5? What is the probability of rolling a 6?
Nonmathematicians are more likely to express this relationship using the concept of odds.
They would say that the odds of rolling a 2 are 1 in 6. This means that for every six times
you roll a die, you can expect one of them to result in a 2.
Coin Toss
Suppose you and a friend each ﬂip a coin. What are all the possible joint outcomes? What
is the probability of getting two heads? What is the probability of getting two tails? What
is the probability of getting one head and one tail? What does it mean if the probability of
an event is ? Is it possible for the probability of an event to be ? Explain.
Cards
Suppose you pick a card at random out of a deck of playing cards. What is the probabil-
ity that the card will be the queen of hearts? What is the probability that the card will be
a queen? What is the probability that the card will be a heart?

Fill out the table below and try to discover the relationship among these three
probabilities.
Probability of a
Probability of a
Probability of the Queen
Queen
Heart
of Hearts
Probability of a 3
Probability of a 4
Probability of a 3 or a 4
For a card to be the queen of hearts, two conditions must hold true at the same time. The
card must be a queen and the card must be a heart. Make a guess about the relationship
of the probabilities when two conditions must occur simultaneously. Test your guess by
considering the probability of drawing a black 7. What are the two conditions that must
be true in order for the card to be a black 7? What are their individual probabilities? Was
your guess correct?
What two conditions must be true when you draw a red face card? What is the prob-
ability of drawing a red face card?
Suppose you pick a card at random out of a deck of playing cards. What is the prob-
ability that the card will be a 3 or a 4? What is the probability that the card will be a 3? A
4? Fill in the table to try to discover the relationship between these probabilities.
A card is a 3 or a 4 if either condition holds. Make a guess about the relationship of the
probabilities when either of two conditions must be true. Test your guess by calculating
the probability that a card will be a heart or a club. Was your guess correct?
Sometimes a complicated probability is easier to calculate using a back-door ap-
proach. For instance, suppose you needed to calculate the probability that a card drawn is
an ace or a 2 or a 3 or a 4 or a 5 or a 6 or a 7 or an 8 or a 9 or a 10 or a jack or a queen.
You can certainly add the individual probabilities (what do you get?). However, another
way to look at the situation is to ask what is the probability of not getting a king. We rea-
son that if you do not get a king, then you do get one of the desired cards. We calculate
this by subtracting the probability of getting a king from 1. This is because 1 must be the
sum of all the probabilities that totally deﬁne the set (in this case, the sum of the proba-
bilities of getting a king and the probability of getting one of the other cards). Verify that
you get the same probability using both methods.

GOOD ADVICE FOR STUDYING
Planning Makes Perfect
N
ow is the time to formalize a study plan. Set aside a time of day, every day, to focus
all of your attention on math. For some students, ﬁnding a quiet place in the
library to study regularly for 1 hour is far more efﬁcient than studying 2 hours at home,
where there are constant distractions. For others, forming a study group where you can
talk about what you have learned is helpful. Decide which works best for you.
Try to schedule time as close to the class session as possible while the concepts are
fresh in your mind. If you wait several hours to practice what seemed clear during class,
you may ﬁnd that what was clear earlier may no longer be meaningful. This may mean
planning a schedule of classes that includes an hour after class to study.
If, on some days, you cannot devote 1 or 2 hours to math, ﬁnd at least a few min-
utes and review one thing—perhaps read your notes, reread the section objectives, or if
you want to do a few problems, do the section Warm-Ups. This helps to keep the con-
cepts fresh in your memory.
If you choose to form or join a study group with other math-anxious students, don’t
use your time together to gripe. Instead, use it to discuss and recognize the content of
your negative self-talk and to write positive coping statements.
Plan, too, for your physical health. Notice how your anxious thought patterns trig-
ger physical tension. When you wrinkle your forehead, squint your eyes, make a trip to
the coffee machine, or light up a cigarette, you are looking for a way to release these
tensions. Learning relaxation techniques, speciﬁcally progressive relaxation, is a healthier
alternative to controlling body tension. Brieﬂy, relaxation training involves alternately
tensing and relaxing all of the major muscles in the body with the goal of locating your
speciﬁc muscle tension and being able to relax it away. Use a professionally prepared pro-
gressive relaxation tape, or take a stress management class to properly learn this tech-
nique. Allow at least 20 to 30 minutes for this exercise daily. The time it takes for you to
deeply relax will become briefer as you become more skilled. Soon relaxation will be as
automatic as breathing, and when you ﬁnd yourself feeling math anxious, you can stop,
take control, and relax.

Sports hold a universal attraction. People all over the world
enjoy a good game. For some sports, it is relatively easy to de-
termine which athlete is the best. In track, downhill skiing, and
swimming, for instance, each contestant races against the
clock and the fastest time wins. In team sports, it is easy to tell
which team wins, but sometimes difﬁcult to determine how the
individual athletes compare with one another. In order to make
comparisons more objective, we often use sports statistics.
The simplest kind of statistic is to count how many times
an athlete performs a particular feat in a single game. In bas-
ketball, for instance, it is usual to count the number of points
scored, the number of rebounds made, and the number of 
assists for each player.
Consider the following playoff statistics for members of
the Detroit Pistons in their win of the 2005 NBA championship.

How & Why
Write word names from place value names and
place value names from word names.
Decimals are written by using a standard place value in the same way we write whole
numbers. Numbers such as 12.65, 0.45, 0.795, 1306.94, and 19.36956 are examples of
decimals.
In general, the place value for decimals is
1. The same as whole numbers for digits to the left of the decimal point, and
2. A fraction whose denominator is 10, 100, 1000, and so on, for digits to the right of the
decimal point.
The digits to the right of the decimal point have place values of
and so on, in that order from left to right.
Using the ones place as the central position, the place values of a decimal are shown
in Figure 4.1.

VOCABULARY
Decimal numbers, more commonly referred to as decimals, are another
way of writing fractions and mixed numbers. The digits used to write whole
numbers and a period called a decimal point are used to write place value
names for these numbers.
The number of decimal places is the number of digits to the right of the
decimal point. Exact decimals are decimals that show exact values. 
Approximate decimals are rounded values.

Note that the decimal point separates the whole-number part from the fractional part.
If the decimal point is not written, as in the case of a whole number, the decimal point is
understood to follow the ones place; thus,
We can write an expanded form of the decimal using fractions with denominators that are
powers of 10. So
.
The expanded form can also be written:
7 tens  1 one  9 tenths  6 hundredths  1 thousandth.

For numbers greater than zero and less than one (such as 0.639), it is preferable to
write the digit 0 in the ones place.
To write the word name for a decimal
1. Write the name for the whole number to the left of the decimal point.
2. Write the word and for the decimal point.
3. Write the whole number name for the number to the right of the decimal
point.
4. Write the place value of the digit farthest to the right.
If the decimal has only zero or no digit to the left of the decimal point, omit
steps 1 and 2.

E. Write the place value name for thirty-eight ten-thousandths.
38
First, write the number for thirty-eight.
.0038
The place value “ten-thousandths” indicates four decimal places, so
write two zeros before the numeral thirty-eight and then a decimal point.
This puts the numeral 8 in the ten-thousandths place.
0.0038
Since the number is between zero and one, we write a 0 in the ones
place.
F. Write the place value name for “four hundred ﬁve and four hundred ﬁve ten-

How & Why
Round a given decimal.
Decimals can be either exact or approximate. For example, decimals that count money are
exact. The ﬁgure $56.35 shows an exact amount. Most decimals that describe measure-
ments are approximations. For example, 6.1 ft shows a person’s height to the nearest tenth
of a foot and 1.9 m shows the height to the nearest tenth of a meter, but neither is an exact
measure.

To the nearest tenth, 2.563 is rounded to 2.6, because it is closer to 2.6 than to 2.5.
Rounded to the nearest hundredth, 2.563 is rounded to 2.56, because it is closer to 2.56
than to 2.57.
To round 21.8573 to the nearest hundredth, without drawing a number line, draw an
arrow under the hundredths place to identify the round-off place.
We must choose between 21.85 and 21.86. Because the digit to the right of the round-off
position is 7, the number is more than halfway to 21.86. So we choose the larger number.

This method is sometimes called the “four-ﬁve” rule. Although this rounding proce-
dure is the most commonly used, it is not the only way to round. Many government agen-
cies round by truncation; that is, by dropping the digits after the decimal point. Thus,
It is common for retail stores to round up for any amounts smaller than
one cent. Thus,
There is also a rule for rounding numbers in science,
which is sometimes referred to as the “even/odd” rule. You might learn and use a differ-
ent round-off rule depending on the kind of work you are doing.

To round a decimal number to a given place value
1. Draw an arrow under the given place value. (After enough practice, you
will be able to round mentally and will not need the arrow.)
2. If the digit to the right of the arrow is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, add 1 to the digit
above the arrow; that is, round to the larger number.
3. If the digit to the right of the arrow is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, keep the digit
above the arrow; that is, round to the smaller number.
4. Write whatever zeros are necessary after the arrow so that the number
above the arrow has the same place value as the original. See Example H.

How & Why
List a set of decimals from smallest to largest.
Fractions can be listed in order when they have a common denominator by ordering the
numerators. This idea can be extended to decimals when they have the same number of
decimal places. For instance,
and 
have a common denominator
when written in fractional form. Because 
, we know that 0.36 is less than 0.47;
or 0.36  0.47.
The decimals 0.7 and 0.59 do not have a common denominator. But we can make
common denominators by placing a zero after the 7. Thus,
so that
and
Then, since 
, we conclude that 0.7  0.59.
We can also use a number line to order decimals. The number line shows that 
2.6  3.8 because 2.6 is to the left of 3.8. See Figure 4.3.

The zeros to the right of the decimal point following the last nonzero digit do not change
the value of the decimal. Usually these extra zeros are not written, but they are useful
when operating with decimals.
4.2 Changing Decimals to Fractions; Listing in Order

To list a set of decimals from smallest to largest
1. Make sure that all numbers have the same number of decimal places to
the right of the decimal point by writing zeros to the right of the last digit
when necessary.
2. Write the numbers in order as if they were whole numbers.
3. Remove the extra zeros.

OBJECTIVES
1. Add decimals.
2. Subtract decimals.
How & Why
Add decimals.
What is the sum of 
? We make use of the expanded form of the decimal to
explain addition.
We use the same principle for adding decimals that we use for whole numbers—that
is, we add like units. The vertical form gives us a natural grouping of the tens, ones, and
tenths. By inserting zeros so all the numbers have the same number of decimal places, we
write the addition 
as

How & Why
Subtract decimals.
What is the difference 8.68  4.37? To ﬁnd the difference, we write the numbers in 
column form, aligning the decimal points. Now subtract as if they are whole numbers.
The decimal point in the difference is aligned with those above.
When necessary, we can regroup, or borrow, as with whole numbers. What is the
difference 7.835  3.918?
7.835
3.918
We need to borrow 1 from the hundredths column (1 hundredth  10 thousandths) and
we need to borrow 1 from the ones column (1 one  10 tenths).
6 18 2 15
3. 9 1 8
3. 9 1 7
So the difference is 3.917.
Sometimes it is necessary to write zeros on the right so the numbers have the same
number of decimal places. See Example E.

How & Why
Multiply decimals.
The “multiplication table” for decimals is the same as for whole numbers. In fact, deci-
mals are multiplied the same way as whole numbers with one exception: the location of
the decimal point in the product. To discover the rule for the location of the decimal point,
we use what we already know about multiplication of fractions. First, change the decimal
form to fractional form to ﬁnd the product. Next, change the product back to decimal
form and observe the number of decimal places in the product. Consider the examples in
Table 4.4. We see that the product in decimal form has the same number of decimal places
as the total number of places in the decimal factors.
OBJECTIVE

Multiplying Decimals
The shortcut is to multiply the numbers and insert the decimal point. If necessary, insert
zeros so that there are enough decimal places. The product of 0.2  0.3 has two decimal
places, because tenths multiplied by tenths yields hundredths.

To multiply decimals
1. Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers.
2. Locate the decimal point by counting the number of decimal places (to
the right of the decimal point) in both factors. The total of these two
counts is the number of decimal places the product must have.
3. If necessary, zeros are inserted to the left of the numeral so there are
enough decimal places (see Example D).
When multiplying decimals, it is not necessary to align the decimal points in the
decimals being multiplied.

Warm-Ups A–F
Examples A–F
DIRECTIONS:
Multiply.
S T R A T E G Y :
First multiply the numbers, ignoring the decimal points. Place the dec-
imal point in the product by counting the number of decimal places in
the two factors. Insert zeros if necessary to produce the number of re-
quired places.
A. Multiply: (0.9)(17)
Multiply 9 and 17. The total number of decimal places in both
factors is one (1), so there is one decimal place in the product.
So, (0.9)(17)  15.3.
B. Find the product of 0.8 and 0.57.
There are three decimal places in the product because the total
number of places in the factors is three.
So the product of 0.8 and 0.57 is 0.456.
C. Find the product of 9.73 and 6.8.
So the product of 9.63 and 6.8 is 66.164.
D. Multiply 7.9 times 0.0004.
So 7.9 times 0.0004 is 0.00316.
CALCULATOR EXAMPLE
E. Find the product: (38.56)(71.238)
S T R A T E G Y :
The calculator will automatically place the decimal point in the correct
position.
The product is 2746.93728.
F. If exactly eight strips of metal, each 3.875 inches wide, are to be cut from a piece of
sheet metal, what is the smallest (in width) piece of sheet metal that can be used?
S T R A T E G Y :
To ﬁnd the width of the piece of sheet metal we multiply the width of
one of the strips by the number of strips needed.
The extra zeros can be dropped.
The piece must be 31 inches wide.

F. If 12 strips, each 6.45
centimeters wide, are to be
cut from a piece of sheet
metal, what is the narrowest
piece of sheet metal that can
be used?
Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers. There are three
decimal places in the product.

C. 15.088
D. 0.00273
E. 1862.85262
F.
The sheet metal must be 77.4 cen-
timeters wide.
Because 7.9 has one decimal place and 0.0004 has four decimal places,
the product must have ﬁve decimal places. We must insert two zeros to
the left so there are enough places in the answer.

How & Why
Multiply or divide a number by a power of 10.
The shortcut used in Section 1.5 for multiplying and dividing by a power of 10 works in
a similar way with decimals. Consider the following products:
0.8
0.63
9.36
10
 10
 
10
0
0
0
8 0
6 30
93 60
8.0  8
6.30  6.3
93.60  93.6
Note in each case that multiplying a decimal by 10 has the effect of moving the decimal
point one place to the right.
Because 100  10  10, multiplying by 100 is the same as multiplying by 10 two
times in succession. So, multiplying by 100 has the effect of moving the decimal point
two places to the right. For instance,
(0.42)(100)  (0.42)(10  10)  (0.42  10)  10  4.2  10  42
Because 1000  10  10  10, the decimal point will move three places to the right when
multiplying by 1000. Because 10,000  10  10  10  10, the decimal point will move
four places to the right when multiplying by 10,000, and so on in the same pattern:
(0.05682)(10,000)  568.2
Zeros may have to be placed on the right in order to move the correct number of dec-
imal places:
(6.3)(1000)  6.300  6300
In this problem, two zeros are placed on the right.
Because multiplying a decimal by 10 has the effect of moving the decimal point one
place to the right, dividing a number by 10 must move the decimal point one place to the
left. Again, we are using the fact that multiplication and division are inverse operations.
Division by 100 will move the decimal point two places to the left, and so on. Thus,
739.5  100  739.5  7.395
0.596  10,000  0.0000596

VOCABULARY
Recall that a power of 10 is the value obtained when 10 is written with an
exponent.
Scientiﬁc notation is a special way to write numbers as a product using a
number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10.
Four zeros are placed on the left so that the decimal
point may be moved four places to the left.

How & Why
Write a number in scientiﬁc notation or change a
number in scientiﬁc notation to its place value name.
Scientiﬁc notation is widely used in science, technology, and industry to write large and
small numbers. Every “scientiﬁc calculator” has a key for entering numbers in scientiﬁc
notation. This notation makes it possible for a calculator or computer to deal with much
larger or smaller numbers than those that take up 8, 9, or 10 spaces on the display.
For example, see Table 4.5.

Notation
A number in scientiﬁc
notation is written as the
product of two numbers.
The ﬁrst number is 
between 1 and 10 
(including 1 but not 10)
and the second number
is a power of 10. The
multiplication is 
indicated using an “”

Small numbers are shown by writing the power of 10 using a negative exponent.
(This is the ﬁrst time that we have used negative numbers. You probably have run into
them before. For instance, when reporting temperatures, a reading of 10 degrees above
zero is written 10. While a reading of 10 degrees below zero is written 10. You will
learn more about negative numbers in Chapter 8.) For now, remember that multiplying by
a negative power of 10 is the same as dividing by a power of 10, which means you will be
moving the decimal point to the left. See Table 4.6.
The shortcut for multiplying by a power of 10 is to move the decimal to the right, and
the shortcut for dividing by a power of 10 is to move the decimal point to the left.
To write a number in scientiﬁc notation
1. Move the decimal point right or left so that only one digit remains to the
left of the decimal point. The result will be a number between 1 and 10.
If the choice is 1 or 10 itself, use 1.
2. Multiply the decimal found in step 1 by a power of 10. The exponent of 10
to use is one that will make the new product equal to the original number.
a. If you had to move the decimal to the left, multiply by the same 
number of 10s as the number of places moved.
b. If you had to move the decimal to the right, divide (by writing a negative
exponent) by the same number of 10s as the number of places moved.

4.5 Multiplying and Dividing by Powers of 10; Scientiﬁc Notation
To change from scientiﬁc notation
to place value name
1. If the exponent of 10 is positive, multiply by as many 10s (move the 
decimal point to the right as many places) as the exponent shows.
2. If the exponent of 10 is negative, divide by as many 10s (move the 
decimal point to the left as many places) as the exponent shows.
Move the decimal (which is after the units
place) to the left until the number is between
1 and 10 (one digit to the left of the
decimal).
Multiply each by a power of 10 that shows
how many places left the decimal moved,
or how many places you would have to move
to the right to recover the original number.
Move the decimal to the right until the
number is between 1 and 10.
Divide each by a power of 10 that shows
how many places right the decimal moved.
Show this division by a negative power of 10.
It is important to note that scientiﬁc notation is not rounding. The scientiﬁc notation has exactly the same value as the 
original name.

4.6 Dividing Decimals; Average, Median, and Mode
381
How & Why
Divide decimals.
Division of decimals is the same as division of whole numbers, with one difference. The
difference is the location of the decimal point in the quotient.
As with multiplication, we examine the fractional form of division to discover the
method of placing the decimal point in the quotient. First, change the decimal form to
fractional form to ﬁnd the quotient. Next, change the quotient to decimal form. Consider
the information in Table 4.7.

We can see from Table 4.7 that the decimal point for the quotient of a decimal and a whole
number is written directly above the decimal point in the dividend. It may be necessary to
insert zeros to do the division. See Example B.
When a decimal is divided by 7, the division process may not have a remainder of
zero at any step:
0.97
6 3

At this step we can write zeros to the right of the digit 5, since 6.85  6.850  6.8500 

It appears that we might go on inserting zeros and continue endlessly. This is indeed what
happens. Such decimals are called “nonterminating, repeating decimals.” For example,
the quotient of this division is sometimes written
The bar written above the sequence of digits 857142 indicates that these digits are 
repeated endlessly.
In practical applications we stop the division process one place value beyond the
accuracy required by the situation and then round. Therefore,

Now let’s examine division when the divisor is also a decimal. We will use what we
already know about division with a whole-number divisor. See Table 4.8.

If the divisor is not a whole number, move the decimal point in both
the divisor and the dividend to the right the number of places neces-
sary to make the divisor a whole number. The decimal point in the
quotient is found by writing it directly above the decimal (as moved)
in the dividend.

OBJECTIVE
Solve equations that involve
multiplication and division of
decimals.
To solve an equation using multiplication or division
1. Divide both sides of the equation by the same number to isolate the vari-
able, or
2. Multiply both sides of the equation by the same number to isolate the
variable.

Warm-Ups A–E
DIRECTIONS:
Solve.
S T R A T E G Y :
Isolate the variable by multiplying or dividing both sides by the same
number.
A. 1.7x  86.7
Because x is multiplied by 1.7, we divide both sides by 1.7. The 
division is usually written in fractional form. Because division is the 
inverse of multiplication, the variable is isolated.
x  51
Simplify.
CHECK:
17.1(51)  86.7
Substitute 51 for x in the original equation and simplify.
86.7  86.7
True.
The solution is x  51.
B.
Because a is divided by 11.6, we multiply both sides
by 11.6. Because multiplication is the inverse of
division, the variable is isolated.
113.68  a
CHECK:
Substitute 113.68 for a in the original equation and simplify.
9.8  9.8
True.
The solution is a  113.68.
C. 34.6y  186.84

First substitute the known values into the formula.
T  sC
739.5  7.5C
Substitute 739.5 for T and 7.5 for s.
Divide both sides by 7.5.

4.7 Changing Fractions to Decimals
399
How & Why
Change fractions to decimals.
Every decimal can be written as a whole number times the place value of the last digit on
the right:
The fraction has a power of 10 for the denominator. Any fraction that has only prime fac-
tors of 2 and/or 5 in the denominator can be written as a decimal by building the denom-
inator to a power of 10.
Every fraction can be thought of as a division problem 
Therefore, a
second method for changing fractions to decimals is division. As you discovered in the
previous section, many division problems with decimals do not have a zero remainder at
any point. If the denominator of a simpliﬁed fraction has prime factors other than 2 or 5,
the quotient will be a nonterminating decimal. The fraction 
is an example:
The bar over the 3 indicates that the decimal repeats the number 3 forever. Expressing the
decimal form of a fraction using a repeat bar is an exact conversion and is indicated with
an equal sign (). In the exercises for this section, round the division to the indicated
decimal place or use the repeat bar as directed.

Order of Operations
To simplify an expression with more than one
operation follow these steps
1. Parentheses—Do the operations within grouping symbols ﬁrst (parentheses,
fraction bar, etc.), in the order given in steps 2, 3, and 4.
2. Exponents—Do the operations indicated by exponents.
3. Multiply and Divide—Do multiplication and division as they appear from
left to right.
4. Add and Subtract—Do addition and subtraction as they appear from left
to right.

E. Ellen buys the following items at the grocery store: 3 cans of soup at $1.23 each; 2 cans
of peas at $0.89 each; 1 carton of orange juice at 2 for $5.00; 3 cans of salmon at $2.79
each; and 1 jar of peanut butter at $3.95. Ellen had a coupon for $2.00 off when you
purchase 3 cans of salmon. What did Ellen pay for the groceries?
S T R A T E G Y :
Find the sum of the cost of each item and then subtract the coupon sav-
ings. To ﬁnd the cost of each type of food, multiply the unit price by
the number of items.
3(1.23)  2(0.89)  1(5.00  2)
To ﬁnd the unit price of the orange juice,
 3(2.79)  1(3.95)  2.00
we must divide the price for two by 2.
Multiply and divide.
Multiply.
18.29
Add and subtract.
Ellen spent $18.29 for the groceries.
How & Why
Estimate the sum, difference, product, and
quotient of decimals.
To estimate the sum or difference of decimals, we round the numbers to a speciﬁed place
value. We then add or subtract these rounded numbers to get the estimate. For example,
to estimate the sum of 0.345  0.592  0.0067, round each to the nearest tenth.
So 0.9 is the estimate of the sum. We usually can do the estimation mentally and it serves
as a check to see if our actual sum is reasonable. Here the actual sum is 0.9437.
Similarly, we can estimate the difference of two numbers. For instance, Jane found
the difference of 0.00934 and 0.00367 to be 0.008973. To check, we estimate the differ-
ence by rounding each number to the nearest thousandth,
So 0.005 is the estimate of the difference. This is not close to Jane’s answer, so she needs
to subtract again.
This answer is close to the estimate. Jane may not have aligned the decimal points
properly.

which is correct.
To estimate the product of decimals front round each number and then multiply. For in-
stance to ﬁnd the estimated product, (0.067)(0.0034), round to the product, (0.07)(0.003),
and then multiply. The estimated product is (0.07)(0.003)  0.00021. If the estimate is
close to our calculated product we will feel comfortable that we have the product correct.
In this case our calculated product is 0.0002278.
We estimate a division problem only to verify the correct place value in the quotient.
If we front round and then divide the numbers, it could result in an estimate that is as
much as 3 units off the correct value. However, the place value will be correct. Find the
correct place value of the ﬁrst nonzero digit in 0.000456 divided by 0.032.
We see that the quotient will have its ﬁrst nonzero digit in the hundreds place. So given a
choice of answers, 0.1425, 0.01425, 0.001425, or 1.425, we choose 0.01425 because the
ﬁrst nonzero digit is in the hundredths place.
Multiply the divisor and the dividend by 100 so we are
dividing by a whole number. Find a partial quotient.

M. Jane goes to the store to buy the following items: eggs, $1.29; cereal, $2.89; 3 cans of
soup at $.89 each; hamburger, $3.49; 2 cans of fruit at $1.19 each; milk, $2.15;
potatoes, $0.79; and bread, $2.79. Jane has $20 to spend, so she will estimate the cost
to see if she can afford the items. Can Jane afford all of the items?
Round each price to the nearest dollar and keep a running total:
Front round and multiply. Note: there are
5 decimal places in the factors so there
must be 5 decimal places in the product.
Jane estimates the cost at $18 (the actual cost is $18.45), so she can afford the items.

71. The body-mass index (BMI) is a technique used by
health professionals to assess a person’s excess fat and
associated risk for heart disease, stroke, hypertension,
and diabetes. The BMI is calculated by multiplying a
person’s weight (in pounds) by 705 and dividing the 
result by the square of the person’s height in inches.
The table gives the degree of risk of disease for various
BMI values.
BMI
Disease Risk
< 20.00
Moderate to very high
20.00 to 21.99
Low
22.00 to 24.99

Calculate the BMI for everyone in your group. Round
your calculations to the nearest hundredth. Why are
large BMI values associated with more risk for disease?
Why are very low values of BMI also associated with
more risk for disease?

Dividing Decimals; Average, Median, and Mode
Deﬁnitions and Concepts
Examples
To divide decimals:
• If the divisor is not a whole number, move the decimal point
in both the divisor and the dividend to the right as many
places as necessary to make the divisor a whole number.
• Place the decimal point in the quotient above the decimal
point in the dividend.
• Divide as if both numbers are whole numbers.
• Round as appropriate.
Finding the average of a set of decimals is the same as for
whole numbers:
• Add the numbers.
• Divide by the number of numbers.
Finding the median of a set of decimals is the same as for
whole numbers:
• List the numbers in order from smallest to largest.
• If there is an odd number of numbers in the set, the median
is the middle number.
• If there is an even number of numbers in the set, the median is
the average of the middle two.
Finding the mode of a set of decimals is the same as for whole 
numbers:
• Find the number or numbers that occur most often.
• If all the numbers occur the same number of times, there
is no mode.

1. Which quarterback deserved to be rated as the top quarterback of the year? Justify
your answer.
The NFL has developed a rating system for quarterbacks that combines all of the
statistics in the table and gives each quarterback a single numeric “grade” so they can
easily be compared. While the exact calculations used by the NFL are complicated,
Randolph Taylor of Las Positas College in Livermore, California, has developed the
following formula that closely approximates the NFL ratings.
Let A  the number of passes attempted
C  the number of passes completed
Y  the number of yards gained passing
T  the number of touchdowns passed
I  the number of interceptions
Rating 
2. Use the rating formula to calculate ratings for the quarterbacks in the table. Use your
calculator and do not round except at the end, rounding to the nearest hundredth.
3. Explain why everything in the formula is added except 
.
4. According to your calculations, who was the best quarterback for the 2004 season?
5. In the 2004 season, Clinton Portis of the Washington Redskins made two attempts at a
pass and completed one for 15 yards and a touchdown. He had no interceptions.
Calculate his rating and comment on how he compares with the quarterbacks in the
table.
6. What are the drawbacks to using the rating as the sole measure of a quarterback’s
performance?
7. (Optional) Have your group compile a list of the ﬁve all-time best quarterbacks. Find
statistics for each of the quarterbacks on your list (use almanacs or the web) and
compute their ratings. Comment on your results.

GOOD ADVICE FOR STUDYING
Learning to Learn Math
L
earning mathematics is a building process. For example, if you have not mastered
fractions, rational expressions are difﬁcult to learn because they require an under-
standing of the rules for fractions. Therefore, if you are having difﬁculty with the current
topic, you may not have mastered a previous skill that you need. It will be necessary to
go back and learn/relearn this skill before you can continue.
Learning math also means learning not just skills, but how and where and when to
apply the skills. For example, if it takes 16 gallons of gas to travel 320 miles, how many
miles to the gallon are you getting? What skill would you use to solve this problem?
(Answer: dividing) Reading the application problems and thinking of situations where you
have used or could use these concepts help integrate the concept into your experience.
Learning mathematics is learning something basic to daily life and to virtually every
ﬁeld of science and business. The examples in the book state the problem and a strat-
egy for solving the problem. This strategy applies to several related problems. Learning
mathematics is learning strategies to solve related problems.
The more you begin to appreciate mathematics as relevant to your life, the more
you will see mathematics as worthy of your time, and the more committed you will feel
to studying mathematics. Here is an activity that may give you fresh opportunities to see
how much mathematics relates to your life. First, create a simple “web” or “map” with
“math” at the center and spokes out from this center naming areas in life where math
comes up—areas where math is useful. Capture as many areas as you can in a 5-minute
period.
Second, turn the page over and construct a second “web,” but this time choose
one of your “math areas” for the center and create spokes that capture subtopics or
subheadings in this particular math area. Take another 5 minutes for this second web.
Next, create a problem that you believe to be solvable, from your own experience, and
that might be enticing for someone else to solve.
If you are working with a partner, trade problems and see if you can solve each
other’s problems. Talk about how you might approach the problems and whether they
are stated clearly and believably. Here are some criteria for a good problem:
• Enough data and information to solve the problem
• Clear statement of what you need to ﬁnd
• Not too many questions included
• Appropriate reading level and clearly written
• Appears solvable and not too scary
• Makes the reader care about wanting to solve the problem
Going through this activity may help you become more aware of mathematics in your
daily life and give you a greater understanding of problems and problem solving.

From the earliest times, humans have drawn maps to represent the geogra-
phy of their surroundings. Some maps depict features encountered on a
journey, like rivers and mountains. The most useful maps incorporate the
concept of scale, or proportion. Simply put, a scaled map accurately pre-
serves relative distances. So if the distance from one city to another is twice
the distance from the city to a river in real life, the distance between the
cities is twice the distance from the city to a river on the map as well.
The scale of a map depends on how large an area the map covers.
In the United States, the scale is often stated as “one inch represents
.” For a street map of a city, the scale could be “one inch
represents 600 yards.” The map of an entire state could have a scale of
“one inch represents 45 miles.” The map of an entire country could have
a scale of “one inch represents 500 miles.” Speciﬁc information about the
scale is usually given in a corner of the map.

VOCABULARY
A ratio is a comparison of two measurements by division.
Like measurements have the same unit of measure.
Unlike measurements have different units of measure.
A rate is a comparison of two unlike measurements by division.
A unit rate is a rate with a denominator of one unit.

1. Write a fraction that
shows a ratio com-

measurements.
2. Write a fraction that
shows a rate com-
parison of two unlike
measurements.
3. Write a unit rate.
How & Why
Write a fraction that shows a ratio comparison
of two like measurements.
Two numbers can be compared by subtraction or division. If we compare 30 and 10 by
subtraction, 30  10  20, we can say that 30 is 20 more than 10. If we compare 30 and
10 by division, 30  10  3, we can say that 30 is 3 times larger than 10.
The indicated division, 30  10, is called a ratio. These are common ways to write
the ratio to compare 30 and 10:
Because we are comparing 30 to 10, 30 is written ﬁrst or placed in the numerator of the
fraction.
Here we write ratios as fractions. Because a ratio is a fraction, it can often be 
simpliﬁed. The ratio 
is simpliﬁed to . If the ratio contains two like measurements, it
can be simpliﬁed as a fraction.
The units, $ (or dollars), are dropped because they are the same.
The units, miles, are dropped and the fraction is simpliﬁed.

Write a fraction that shows a rate comparison
of two unlike measurements.
Fractions are used to compare unlike measurements as well as like measurements. Such a
comparison is called a rate. The rate of 
compares the unlike measurements
“27 children” and “10 families.” A familiar application of a rate occurs in the computa-
tion of gas mileage. For example, if a car travels 192 miles on 8 gallons of gas, we
compare miles to gallons by writing 
. This rate can be simpliﬁed but the units
are not dropped because they are unlike.
miles per gallon  24 mpg.

5.1 Ratio and Rate
F. An urban environmental committee urged the local citizens to plant deciduous trees
around their homes as a means of conserving energy. The campaign resulted in
825 oak trees and 675 birch trees being sold.
1. What is the rate of the number of oak trees to the number of birch trees sold?
2. What is the rate of the number of oak trees to the total number of trees sold?
1. S T R A T E G Y : Write the ﬁrst measurement, 825 oak trees, in the numerator, and
the second measurement, 675 birch trees, in the denominator.
Simplify.
The rate is 
; that is, 11 oak trees were sold for every 9 birch trees sold.
2. S T R A T E G Y : Write the ﬁrst measurement, 825 oak trees, in the numerator, and
the second measurement, total number of trees, in the denominator.
Simplify.
The rate is 
; that is, 11 out of every 20 trees sold were oak trees.
How & Why
Write a unit rate.
When a rate is re-written so that the denominator is a 1-unit measurement, then we have
a unit rate.
For example,
Read this as “25.5 miles per gallon.”
Re-writing rates as unit rates can lead to statements such as “There are 2.6 children
per family in the state,” because
The unit rate is a comparison, not a fact, because no family has 2.6 children.

It is often difﬁcult to compare the prices of food items, frequently because of the packaging. Is a 14-oz can of pears for $0.89
a better buy than a 16-oz can of pears for $1.00? To help consumers compare, unit pricing is often posted. Mathematically,
we write the information as a rate and rewrite as a 1-unit comparison.
48. Which is the best buy: a 15-oz box of Cheerios for
$2.49, a 20-oz box for $3.29, or a 2-lb 3-oz box for

5.2 Solving Proportions
447
How & Why
Determine whether a proportion is true or false.
A proportion states that two rates or ratios are equal. The statement 
is a propor-
tion. To check whether the proportion is true or false we use “cross multiplication.”
The proportion 
is true if the cross products are equal.
Find the cross products.
336  336
The cross products are equal.
The proportion is true.
The cross-multiplication test is actually a shortcut for converting both fractions to
equivalent fractions with common denominators and checking that the numerators match.
Let’s examine the same proportion using the formal method.
A common denominator is 
.
Multiply. The numerators are the same.
The proportion is true.
The cross products in the shortcut (cross multiplication) are the numerators in the
formal method. This is the reason that checking the cross products is a valid procedure for
determining the truth of a proportion.

2. Solve a proportion.
VOCABULARY
A proportion is a statement that two ratios are equal.
In a proportion, cross multiplication means multiplying the numerator of
each ratio times the denominator of the other.
Cross products are the products obtained from cross multiplication.
Solving a proportion means ﬁnding a missing number, usually represented
as a letter or variable, that will make the proportion true.
To check whether a proportion is true or false
1. Check that the ratios or rates have the same units.
2. Cross multiply.
3. If the cross products are equal, the proportion is true.
¡

S T R A T E G Y :
The units in the rates are not the same. We change all units to cents and
simplify.
Like units may be dropped.
6000  6000
True.
The proportion is true.
How & Why
Solve a proportion.
Proportions are used to solve many problems in science, technology, and business. There
are four numbers or measures in a proportion. If three of the numbers are known, we can
ﬁnd the missing number. For example,
21x  6(14)
Cross multiply.
21x  84
Every multiplication fact can be written as a related division fact. The product di-
vided by one factor gives the other factor. So 21x  84 can be written as x  84  21.

How & Why
Solve word problems using proportions.
If the ratio of two quantities is constant, the ratio can be used to ﬁnd the missing part of a
second ratio. For instance, if 2 lb of bananas cost $0.48, what will 12 lb of bananas cost?
Table 5.1 organizes this information.

Applications of Proportions
OBJECTIVE
Solve word problems using
proportions.
Write the proportion using the ratios shown in Table 5.2.
The units are the same on each side of the equation so we can drop them.
Cross multiply.
Rewrite as division.
Simplify.
So 12 lb of bananas will cost $2.88.
Using a table forces the units of a proportion to match. Therefore, we usually do not
write the units in the proportion itself. We always use the units in the answer.

OPTIONAL
The human body is the source of many common proportions. Artists have long studied the
human ﬁgure in order to portray it accurately. Your group will be investigating how each
member compares to the standard and how various artists have used the standards.
Most adult bodies can be divided into eight equal portions. The ﬁrst section is from
the top of the head to the chin. Next is from the chin to the bottom of the sternum. The
third section is from the sternum to the navel, and the fourth is from the navel to the bot-
tom of the torso. The bottom of the torso to the bottom of the knee is two sections long,
and the bottom of the knee to the bottom of the foot is the last two sections. (Actually,
these last two sections are a little short. Most people agree that the body is actually closer
to 7.5 sections, but because this is hard to judge proportionally, we use eight sections and
leave the bottom one short.)
Complete the following table for each group member.
Explain how your group arrived at the values in the last column (these will depend on
gender). Which member of your group comes closest to the standards? Either draw a body
using the standard proportions, or get a copy of a ﬁgure from a painting and analyze how
close the artist came to the standards.

Explain how your group arrived at the values in the last column. Which member of the
group comes closest to the standards? Did you ﬁnd any differences between the males and
females in your group? Either draw a body using the standard proportions, or get a copy
of a ﬁgure from a painting and analyze how close the artist came to the standards.
A slightly different method of dividing the upper torso is to start at the bottom of the
torso and divide into thirds at the waist and the shoulders. In this method, there is a pro-
nounced difference between males and females. In females, the middle third between the
waist and shoulders is actually shorter than the other two. In males, the bottom third from
waist to bottom of the torso is shorter than the others. For each member of your group, ﬁll
out the following table.

Children have different body proportions than adults, and these proportions change
with the age of the child. Measure three children who are the same age. Use their head
measurement as one unit, and compute the ratio of head to entire body. How close are the
three children’s ratios to each other? Before the Renaissance, artists usually depicted chil-
dren as miniature adults. This means that the proportions ﬁt those in the ﬁrst table rather
than those you just discovered. Find a painting from before the Renaissance that contains
a child. Calculate the child’s proportions and comment on them. Be sure to reference the
painting you use.

GOOD ADVICE FOR STUDYING
Preparing for Tests
T
esting usually causes the most anxiety for students. By studying more effectively,
you can eliminate many of the causes of anxiety. But there are also other ways to
prepare that will help relieve your fears.
If you are math anxious, you actually may study too much out of fear of failure and
not allow enough time for resting and nurturing yourself. Every day, allow yourself some
time to focus on your concerns, feelings, problems, or anything that might distract you
when you try to study. Then, when these thoughts distract you, say to yourself, “I will
not think about this now. I will later at 
o’clock. Now I have to focus on math.” If
problems become unmanageable, make an appointment with a college counselor.
Nurturing is any activity that will help you recharge your energy. Choose an activity
that makes you feel good, such as going for a walk, daydreaming, reading a favorite
book, doing yard work, taking a bubble bath, or playing basketball.
Other ways to keep your body functioning effectively under stress are diet and
exercise. Exercise is one of the most beneﬁcial means of relieving stress. Try to eat
healthy foods and drink plenty of water. Avoid caffeine, nicotine, drugs, alcohol, and
“junk food.”
Plan to have all your assignments ﬁnished two days before the test, if possible. The
day before the test should be completely dedicated to reviewing and practicing for
the test.
Many students can do the problems but cannot understand the instructions and
vocabulary, so they do not know where to begin. Review any concepts that you have
missed or any that you were unsure of or “guessed at.”
When you feel comfortable with all of the concepts, you are ready to take the prac-
tice test at the end of the chapter. You should simulate the actual testing situation as
much as possible. Have at hand all the tools you will use on the real test: sharpened
pencils, eraser, and calculator (if your instructor allows). Give yourself the same amount
of time as you’ll be given on the actual test. Plan a time for your practice test when you
can be sure there will be no interruptions. Work each problem slowly and carefully.
Remember, if you make a mistake by rushing through a problem and have to do it over,
it will take more time than doing the problem carefully in the ﬁrst place.
After taking the practice test, go back and study topics referenced with the answers
you missed or that you feel you do not understand. You should now know if you are
ready for the test. If you have been studying effectively and did well on the practice test,

The price we pay for everyday items such as food and
clothing is theoretically simple. The manufacturer of
the item sets the price based on how much it costs to
produce and adds a small proﬁt. The manufacturer then
sells the item to a retail store, which in turn marks it up
and sells it to you, the consumer. But as you know, it is
rarely as simple as that. The price you actually pay for
an item also depends on the time of year, the availabil-
ity of raw materials, the amount of competition among
manufacturers of comparable items, the economic cir-
cumstances of the retailer, the geographic location of
the retailer, and many other factors.
Group Discussion
Select a common item whose price is affected by the following factors:
1. Time of year
2. Economic circumstances of the retailer
3. Competition of comparable products
Discuss how the factor varies and how the price of the item is affected. For each factor,
make a plausible bar graph that shows the change in price as the factor varies. (You may
estimate price levels.)

VOCABULARY
When ratios are used to compare numbers, the denominator is called the 
base unit. In comparing 70 to 100 
100 is the base unit.
The percent comparison, or just the percent, is a ratio with a base unit of 100.
The percent 
is usually written 70%. The symbol % is
read “percent,” and %

6.1 The Meaning of Percent
6.1 The Meaning of Percent
OBJECTIVE
Write a percent to express a
comparison of two numbers.
How & Why
Write a percent to express a comparison 
of two numbers.
The word percent means “by the hundred.” It is from the Roman word percentum. In
Rome, taxes were collected by the hundred. For example, if you had 100 cattle, the tax
collector might take 14 of them to pay your taxes. Hence, 14 per 100, or 14 percent,
would be the tax rate.
Look at Figure 6.1 to see an illustration of the concept of “by the hundred.” The base
unit is 100, and 34 of the 100 parts are shaded. The ratio of shaded parts to total parts is
We say that 34% of the unit is shaded.
Figure 6.1
Figure 6.1 also illustrates that if the numerator is smaller than the denominator, then
not all of the base unit is shaded, and hence the comparison is less than 100%. If the nu-
merator equals the denominator, the entire unit is shaded and the comparison is 100%. If
the numerator is larger than the denominator, more than one entire unit is shaded, and the
comparison is more than 100%.
Any ratio of two numbers can be converted to a percent, even when the base unit is
not 100. Compare 11 to 20. The ratio is 
. Now ﬁnd the equivalent ratio with a
denominator of 100.

S T R A T E G Y :
Write the comparison in fraction form. Build the fraction to hundredths
or solve a proportion and write the percent using the numerator.
D. At a football game, 32 women are among the ﬁrst 100 fans to enter. What percent of
the ﬁrst 100 fans are women?
The comparison of women to ﬁrst 100 fans is 32 to 100.
Write the fraction and change to a percent.
So 32% of the ﬁrst 100 fans are women.
E. Write the ratio of 33 to 25 as a percent.
Write the ratio and build this fraction to one, with a denominator
of 100.
Change to a percent.
So 33 is 132% of 25.
F. Write the ratio of 15 to 21 as a percent.
Because we cannot build the fraction to one with a denominator
of 100 using whole numbers, we write a proportion to ﬁnd the
percent.
Cross multiply.
So 15 is 
of 21.

6.4 Fractions, Decimals, Percents: A Review
509
How & Why
Given a decimal, fraction, or percent,
rewrite in an equivalent form.
Decimals, fractions, and percents can each be written in other two forms. We can:
Write a percent as a decimal and as a fraction.
Write a fraction as a percent and as a decimal.
Write a decimal as a percent and as a fraction.
For example:
and
and
and
Table 6.2 shows some common fractions and their decimal and percent equivalents.
Some of the decimals are repeating decimals. Remember that a repeating decimal
is shown by the bar over the digits that repeat. These fractions occur often in applications
of percents. They should be memorized so that you can recall the patterns when they
appear.

Solving Percent Problems
OBJECTIVES
1. Solve percent problems
using the formula.
2. Solve percent problems
using a proportion.
VOCABULARY
In the statement “R of B is A,”
R is the rate of percent.
B is the base unit and follows the word of.
A is the amount that is compared to B.
To solve a percent problem means to do one of the following:
1. Find A, given R and B.
2. Find B, given R and A.
3. Find R, given A and B.
How & Why
Solve percent problems using the formula.
We show two methods for solving percent problems. We refer to these as
The percent formula, R  B  A (see Examples A–E).
The proportion method (see Examples F–H).
In each method we must identify the rate of percent (R), the base (B), and the amount (A).
To help determine these, keep in mind that
R, the rate of percent, includes the percent symbol (%).
B, the base, follows the words of or percent of.
A, the amount, sometimes called the percentage, is the amount compared to B and follows
the word is.
The method you choose to solve percent problems should depend on
1. the method your instructor recommends
2. your major ﬁeld of study
3. how you use percent in your day-to-day activities
What percent of B is A? The word of in this context and in other places in mathe-
matics indicates multiplication. The word is describes the relationship “is equal to” or
“.” Thus, we write:
R of  B  is  A
 T         T
R  B  A

Figure 6.3
When the unknown value is covered, the positions of the uncovered (known) values help
us remember which operation to use:
When A is covered, we see R  B, reading from left to right.
When B is covered, we see 
, reading from top to bottom.
When R is covered, we see 
, reading from top to bottom.
For example, 34% of what number is 53.04? The rate (R) is 34%, B is unknown
(B follows the word of ), and A (A follows the word is) is 53.04. Fill in the triangle and
cover B. See Figure 6.3.
A  B
A  R
Reading from the top, we see that A is divided by R. Therefore,
B  A  R
 53.04  0.34
Substitute 53.04 for A and 0.34 for R.
 156
So 34% of 156 is 53.04.
When solving percent problems, identify the rate (%) ﬁrst, the base (of) next, and the
amount (is) last. For example, what percent of 30 is 6?
R of B is A
The rate R is unknown, the base B (B follows the word of) is 30, and the
amount A (A follows the word is) is 6.
R  B  A
R1302  6
Substitute 30 for B and 6 for A.
R  6  30
Divide.
 0.2
 20%
Change to percent.
So, 6 is 20% of 30.
All percent problems can be solved using R  B  A. However, there are two other
forms that can speed up the process.
A  R  B
R  A  B
B  A  R
The triangle in Figure 6.2 is a useful device to help you select the correct form of the

How & Why
Solve percent problems using a proportion.
Because R is a comparison of A to B—and we have seen earlier that this comparison
can be written as a ratio—we can write the percent ratio equal to the ratio of A and B.
In writing the percent as a ratio, we let R  X%. We can now write the proportion:
When any one of the values of R, A, and B is unknown it can be found by solving the
proportion. For example, what percent of 225 is 99?
A  99, B  225, and R  X%  ?
225X  100(99)
Cross multiply.
225X  9900
X  9900  225
X  44
R  X%  44%
So 44% of 225 is 99.

How & Why
Solve applications involving percent.
When a word problem is translated to the simpler form, “What percent of what is what?”
the unknown value can be found using one of the methods from the previous section. For
example,
The 2000 Census listed the population of Detroit at 4,043,467. The African
American population was 1,011,038. What percent of the population of Detroit
was African American in 2000?
We ﬁrst rewrite the problem in the form “What percent of what is what?”
What percent of the population is African American?
We know that the total population is 4,043,467 and we know the African American
population is 1,011,038. Substituting these values we have:
What percent of 4,043,467 is 1,011,038?
Using the percent formula we know that R is unknown, B is 4,043,467, and that A is
1,011,038.  We substitute these values into the triangle and solve for R.
Rounded to the nearest hundredth.
%
So the population of Detroit in 2000 was about 25% African American.

S T R A T E G Y :
Write the problem in the form, “What percent of what is what?” Fill in
the known values and ﬁnd the unknown value.
A. This year the population of Deschutes County is 162% of its population 10 years ago.
The population 10 years ago was 142,000. What is the population this year?
S T R A T E G Y :
Use the proportion.
162% of 142,000 is the current population.
Cross multiply.
The population this year is 230,040.
B. A student newspaper polls a group of students. Five of them say they walk to school,
11 say they ride the bus, 15 ride in car pools, and 4 drive their own cars. What percent
of the group rides in car pools?
S T R A T E G Y :
Use the proportion.
First, ﬁnd the number in the group.
What % of 35 is 15?
There are 35 in the group, so B  35, and 15 ride in car
pools so A  15.
Cross multiply.
Round to the nearest whole number.
R  X%.
Approximately 43% of the students ride in car pools.
C. In a statistical study of 545 people, 215 said they preferred eating whole wheat bread.
What percent of the people surveyed preferred eating whole wheat bread? Round to

S T R A T E G Y :
Use the percent formula to solve.
What percent of 545 is 215?
B  545 and A  215
Percent formula
Substitute.
Round to the nearest hundredth.
So approximately 39% of the people surveyed preferred eating whole wheat bread.

A. The cost of the Ford today is
$27,540.
B. The percent of students receiving a 
C grade is approximately 47%.
C. Of the 615 people, 30% jog.

How & Why
Find percent of increase and percent of decrease.
To ﬁnd the percent of increase or decrease, the base B is the starting number. The increase
or decrease is the amount A. For instance, if the population of a city grew from 86,745 to
90,310 in 3 years, the base is 86,745 and the increase is the difference in the populations,
90,310  86,745  3565.
To ﬁnd the percent of increase in the population, we ask the question “What percent
of 86,745 is 3565?” Using the percent equation 
we have
Substitute 3565 for A and 86,745 for B.
Round to the nearest hundredth.
%
Change to a percent.
So the population increased about 4% in the 3 years.

Answers to Warm-Ups
D. The price of a gallon of premium
gasoline increased by about 22.8%.

E. John went on a diet. At the beginning of the diet, he weighed 267 lb. After 6 weeks,
he weighed 216 lb. Find the percent of decrease in his weight to the nearest tenth of a
percent.
S T R A T E G Y :
Use the proportion.
267 lb  216 lb  51 lb
The difference, 51 lb, is the amount of decrease from
267 to 216. The percent of decrease is the comparison
of the amount, 51 lb, to the original weight, 267 lb.
What percent of 267 is 51?
B  267 and A  51
Substitute 51 for A and 267 for B.
Round to the nearest tenth.
R  X%
So John had a decrease of about 19.1% in his weight.

How & Why
Read data from a circle graph or construct a 
circle graph from data.
A circle graph or pie chart is used to show how a whole unit is divided into parts. The area
of the circle represents the entire unit and each subdivision is represented by a sector. Per-
cents are often used as the unit of measure of the subdivision. Consider the following pie
chart (Figure 6.4).

2. The Caucasian population is twice the African American population.
3. The African American and Hispanic populations are 60% of the total.
Answers to Warm-Ups
E. The price of an LCD television set
decreased about 40.8%.

If the population of El Centro is 125,000, we can also compute the approximate num-
ber in each group. For instance, the number of Hispanics is found by:
R  45%  0.45, B  125, 000
There are approximately 56,250 Hispanics in El Centro.
To construct a circle graph, determine what fractional part or percent each subdivi-
sion is, compared to the total. Then draw a circle and divide it accordingly. We can draw
a pie chart of the data in Table 6.3.

How & Why
Solve applications involving sales tax.
Most states and some cities charge a tax on certain items when purchased. Stores collect
this tax and send it on to the governmental unit. The amount of the sales tax is added to
the purchase price to get the ﬁnal cost to the buyer.
A sales tax is a percent of the purchase price. For example, a 7.5% sales tax on a pur-
chase price of $100 is found by taking 7.5% of $100.
Sales tax  7.5% of $100  0.075  $100  $7.50
The total cost to the customer would be
Purchase price Sales tax  Total cost
$100
 $7.50
 $107.50
So the total cost to the customer is $107.50.

VOCABULARY
The original price of an article is the price the business sets to sell the article.
When a store has a sale, the amount of discount is the amount subtracted
from the original price (regular price). Sales tax is the amount charged on
the ﬁnal sale price to ﬁnance state and/or city programs. Net income is the
amount left after expenses have been paid. Commission is the money sales-
people earn based on the dollar value of the goods sold.

A. Find the sales tax and the
total cost of a 19-cubic-foot
refrigerator that has a
purchase price of $699 in a
city where the sale tax rate
is 7.2%.
Answers to Warm-Ups
A. The sales tax is $50.33. The ﬁnal
price is $749.33.

How & Why
Solve applications involving discount.
Merchants often discount items to move merchandise. For instance, a store might dis-
count a dress that lists for $125.65 by 30%. This means that the merchant will subtract
30% of the original price to determine the sale price. (Equivalently, the sale price is 70%
of the original price.) To ﬁnd the sale price, we ﬁrst calculate the amount of the discount
using the percent formula:
R% of list price is the amount of the discount.
30% of $125.65 is the discount.
Rounded to the nearest cent.
To ﬁnd the sale price, subtract the discount from the original price.
So the sale price for the dress is $87.95.
$125.65  $37.70  sale price
$87.95  sale price
30%   $125.65  discount

So the total cost of the Mixmaster to the customer is $138.83.
B. Garcia buys a set of luggage for $335. The cashier charges $353.43 on his credit card.
Find the sales tax and the sales tax rate.
To ﬁnd the sales tax, subtract the purchase price from the total cost.
$353.43  $335  $18.43
So the sales tax is $18.43.
To ﬁnd the sales tax rate we ask the question, “What percent of the purchase
price is the sales tax?”
Substitute 335 for B and 18.43 for A.
Round to the nearest thousandth.
The sales tax rate is 5.5%. Because all sales tax rates are exact, we can assume the
approximation of the rate is due to rounding the tax to the nearest cent.

C. Safeway offers $20 off any purchase of $100 or more. Jan purchases groceries totaling
$118.95. What is her total cost and what is the percent of discount?
To ﬁnd the total cost to Jan, subtract $20 from her purchases.
$118.95  $20.00  $98.95
So the groceries cost Jan $98.95.
To ﬁnd the percent of discount answer the question:
What percent of $118.95 is $20.00?
$118.95 is the original cost before the discount.
Now use the formula:
Substitute 118.95 for B and 20 for A.
Round to the nearest hundredth.
So Jan received about a 17% discount on the cost of her groceries.
D. Supermart advertises a special Saturday morning sale. From 6 A.M. to 10 A.M., all
purchases will be discounted an additional 5% off the already discounted prices. At

a city with a total sales tax of 4.5%. What does Carol pay for the TV set, including
sales tax?
First ﬁnd the price of the TV after the 25% discount.
25% of $239 is the discount.
.25  $239  discount
$59.75  discount
Original price  Discount  Sale price

Now, to ﬁnd the purchase price for Carol, subtract the additional discount from the
sale price.
$179.25  $8.96  $170.29
So Carol’s purchase price for the TV is $170.29.
Now calculate the sales tax and add it on to the purchase price to ﬁnd the total

How & Why
Solve applications involving commission.
Commission is the amount of money salespeople earn based on the dollar value of goods
sold. Often salespeople earn a base salary plus commission. When this happens, the total
salary earned is found by adding the commission to the base salary. For instance, Nuyen
earns a base salary of $250 per week plus an 8% commission on her total sales. One week
Nuyen has total sales of $2896.75. What are her earnings for the week?
First, ﬁnd the amount of her commission by multiplying the rate times the total sales.
Commission  Rate  Total sales
 8%  $2896.75
Substitute 8% for the rate and $2896.75
 0.08  $2896.75

 $231.74
So Nuyen earns $231.74 in commission.
Now ﬁnd her total earnings by adding the commission to her base salary.
So Nuyen earns $481.74 for the week.

How & Why
Calculate simple interest.
Simple interest is seldom used these days in the business world. You are more likely to
ﬁnd it when borrowing money from a family member or friend. For instance, Joyce bor-
rows $2000 from her uncle to pay for this year’s tuition. She agrees to pay her uncle 4%
interest on the money at the end of a year. To ﬁnd the interest Joyce owes her uncle at the
end of the year, we use the equation:
Simple interest  Principal  Interest rate  Time
Here, the principal is $2000, the interest rate is 4%, and the time is 1 year. Substituting
we have,
Simple interest  $2000  4%  1
 $2000  0.04  1
 $80
So Joyce owes her uncle $80 in interest at the end of 1 year. She owes a total of $2080.
If the money is borrowed for less than 1 year, the time is expressed as a fraction of a
year. See Example B.

VOCABULARY
Interest is the fee charged for borrowing money. It is usually assessed as a
percent of the money borrowed, or the interest rate. Principal is the amount
of money borrowed. When the interest is based on borrowing the money for
1 year it is called simple interest. Compound interest occurs when interest
is computed on interest already earned. Interest is also the money paid for
use of your money. Interest is paid on savings and on investments.

A. Juan borrows $4500 at 7.5% simple interest to buy a new plasma TV. He agrees to pay
back the entire amount at the end of 3 years. How much interest will Juan owe? What
is the total amount he will owe at the end of 3 years?
Simple interest  Principal  Interest rate  Time
 $4500  7.5%  3
Principal is $4500, interest rate is 7.5%, 
 $4500  0.075  3
and the time period is 3 years.
 $1012.50
At the end of 3 years, Juan will owe $1012.50 in interest.
To ﬁnd the total amount Juan will owe, add the interest to the principal.
Total amount owed  Principal  Interest
 $4500  $1012.50
 $5512.50
So at the end of 3 years, Juan will owe $5512.50.
A. Fife borrows $1600 at 8%
simple interest to buy a

amount she will owe at the
end of the 2 years?
Answers to Warm-Ups
A. Fife will owe $256 in interest and a
total of $1856.

How & Why
Calculate compound interest.
When interest is compounded, the interest earned at the end of one time period is added
to the principal and earns interest during the next time period. For instance, if you invest
$2000 at 5% interest compounded semiannually your account is credited with interest in
June. During the second half of the year, you will earn interest on both the principal and
the interest earned during the ﬁrst 6 months. To calculate the total interest we ﬁrst ﬁnd the
simple interest earned after 6 months.
Simple interest  Principal  Interest rate  Time
 $2000  5%  6 mo
 $2000  0.05  0.5
6 mo  0.5 yr
 $50
So $50 is earned in interest after 6 months. This amount is added to the principal for the
next time period. So for the last 6 months the principal is
New principal  $2000  $50
 $2050
Now calculate the interest earned during the next 6 months.
Simple interest  Principal  Interest rate  Time
 $2050  5%  6 mo
The new principal is $2050.
 $2050  0.05  0.5
 $51.25
So an additional $51.25 is earned during the last 6 months. To ﬁnd the balance at the end
of the year, add the new interest to the new principal.
Total value at the end of 1 year  $2050  $51.25
 $2101.25
We can now ﬁnd the total interest earned by subtracting the original principal from
the ending balance.
Total interest earned  Ending balance  Original principal
 $2101.25  $2000
 $101.25
So the total interest earned is $101.25.
Simple interest for the year would have been $100, so by compounding the interest
semiannually an additional $1.25 was earned. This may not seem like a lot of money, but

First ﬁnd the interest:

 $875  0.06  0.75

Round to the nearest cent.
So Alex owes $39.38 in interest.
Now ﬁnd the total amount owed:
Total amount owed  Principal  Interest
 $875  $39.38
 $914.38
So Alex owes $39.38 in interest and a total of $914.38.

interest does she pay, and
what is the total amount
owed after the 6 months?
Answers to Warm-Ups
B. Juanita owes $18.75 in interest and a
total of $768.75.

if the interest was compounded daily and over a number of years it would amount to a lot
of money. For instance, $10,000 invested at 5% simple interest will have a balance of
$15,000 at the end of 10 years. However if the $10,000 was invested at 5% compounded
daily it would grow to $16,486.65, which is $1486.65 more than at simple interest.
Computing compound interest can be very tedious, especially as the number of peri-
ods increase per year. To ease this burden, accountants have developed compound inter-
est tables that provide a factor to use in calculating the ending balance. Table 6.5 gives the
factors for interest rates that are compounded quarterly (4 times per year).

How & Why
Solve applications related to credit card payments.
Credit card companies and most major department stores charge a ﬁxed interest rate on the
unpaid balance in an account. The minimum payment is usually 2% of the unpaid balance
rounded to the nearest dollar. So if a credit card company charges 19.8% on the unpaid
balance and the unpaid balance is $785.75, we can calculate the minimum payment.
Minimum payment  Unpaid balance  Minimum payment rate
 $785.75  2%
 $785.75  0.02
 $16
Rounded to the nearest dollar.
To ﬁnd the amount of interest in the $16 minimum payment, we need to calculate the
monthly interest on the credit card balance. To do this we ﬁnd the simple interest per year
on the balance at 19.8% and divide it by 12 to ﬁnd the monthly interest.
Monthly interest  (Unpaid balance  Interest rate)  12
 ($785.75  19.8%)  12
 ($785.75  0.198)  12
 $155.5785  12
 $12.96
Rounded to the nearest cent.
So the interest charged is $12.96. The amount applied to the unpaid balance is found by
subtracting the interest charge from the payment.
Amount applied to unpaid balance  Minimum payment  Interest charge
 $16  $12.96
 $3.04
Now ﬁnd the unpaid balance.
Unpaid balance  Beginning unpaid balance  Amount applied to unpaid balance
 $785.75  $3.04
 $782.71
If no further charges are made to the account, next month’s payment will be based on the
new balance of $782.71.

In 2006, federal regula-
tions required a change
in the way credit card
companies calculate the
minimum payment.

If credit card companies receive the payment late they often add on late fees, which
add to the unpaid balance (see Example G). Some credit card companies will also in-
crease the interest rate on accounts when the payment is received late. For instance, a
company that charges a rate of 18.5% may raise the rate to 24.5% for receiving a payment
late. This rate then continues for the life of the card.

F. Ivan has an unpaid balance of $2540 on his credit card. The credit card company
charges an interest rate of 15.7% and requests a minimum payment of 2% of the
unpaid balance. Calculate the minimum payment. If Ivan makes the minimum
payment, calculate the interest paid and the new unpaid balance.
First, ﬁnd the minimum payment:
Minimum payment  Unpaid balance  Minimum payment rate
 $2540  2%
 $51
Round to the nearest dollar.
So the minimum payment is $51.
Now ﬁnd the amount of interest paid.
Monthly interest  (Unpaid balance  Interest rate)  12
 ($2540  15.7%)  12
 ($2540  0.157)  12
 $33.23
Round to the nearest cent.
So the interest paid is $33.23.
Now ﬁnd the amount applied to the unpaid balance.
Amount applied to unpaid balance  Minimum payment  Interest charge
 $51  $33.23
 $17.77

Answers to Warm-Ups
E. Myron pays $908 in interest.
F.
Lucy makes a minimum payment of
$24; $19.76 is interest and $4.24 is
paid on the balance. Her new unpaid
balance is $1205.76.

Now subtract the amount paid on the unpaid balance to ﬁnd the new unpaid balance.
Unpaid balance  Beginning unpaid balance  Amount applied to unpaid balance
 $2540  $17.77
 $2522.23
So Ivan made a minimum payment of $51; $33.23 of this payment was interest and
the new unpaid balance is $2522.23.
G. Lance has an unpaid balance of $1680 on his credit card. The credit card company
charges an interest rate of 18.6% and requests a minimum payment of 2% of the
unpaid balance. Lance makes the minimum payment but is late by 5 days. If the credit
card company charges a late fee of $25, calculate the minimum payment, the interest
paid, and the new unpaid balance.
First, ﬁnd the minimum payment:
Minimum payment  Unpaid balance  Minimum payment rate
 $1680  2%
 $34
Round to the nearest dollar.
So the minimum payment is $34. Now ﬁnd the amount of interest paid.
Monthly interest  (Unpaid balance  Interest rate)  12
 ($1680  18.6%)  12
 ($1680  0.186)  12
 $26.04
So the interest paid is $26.04.
Now ﬁnd the amount applied to the unpaid balance.
Amount applied to unpaid balance  Minimum payment  Interest charge
 $34  $26.04
 $7.96
Now subtract the amount paid on the unpaid balance to ﬁnd the new unpaid balance,
before the late fee.
Unpaid balance  Beginning unpaid balance  Amount applied to unpaid balance
 $1680  $7.96
 $1672.04
Add the $25 late fee to the new unpaid balance.
$1672.04  $25.00  $1697.04
So Lance made a minimum payment of $34, $26.04 of this payment was interest. 
Because of the late fee, Lance now has a balance of $1697.04, which is more than the
original balance.

Have you ever found yourself short of cash? Everyone does at some time. The business
world has many “solutions” for people who need quick money, but each comes with a
price in the form of fees and/or interest charged. An informed consumer chooses one op-
tion or another after careful consideration of all the costs. Let’s look at a hypothetical
situation.
The transmission in LaRonda’s car needs ﬁxing and she absolutely must have her car
to get to and from work. The shop (which does not accept credit cards) gives her a bill for
$250 but she only has $43 in her checking account. LaRonda has a good job, but it is
2 weeks until payday. LaRonda can think of three possible solutions to her dilemma.
1. Write the shop a check that she knows will bounce, and straighten everything out as
soon as she gets paid.
2. Go to a Payday Loan store and have them hold her check until she gets paid.
3. Get a cash advance on her Visa card, and repay it when she gets paid.
LaRonda begins her research on each of her three options. If she bounces a check, the
shop will charge her $30 and so will her bank. In addition, the bank charges her $7 per
day for a continuous negative balance beginning on the fourth day of her negative bal-
ance. The Payday Loan store will charge her $20 for every $100 she borrows for a 2-week
duration. Her Visa card charges her a 3% cash advance fee and then charges her 20.99%
APR until she pays it back.
Assuming that LaRonda borrows $250 and pays off her debt in 14 days, complete the
following table.
Fees as %
Amount
Fees and/or
of Amount
Total
Plan
Borrowed
Interest Paid
Borrowed
Payback
Bounce a check

Cash advance
4. Comment on the APRs associated with the various options. Did any of them surprise
you?
5. If you need a short-term loan, what is a reasonable interest rate?
Fees as %
Amount
Fees and/or
of Amount
Total
Plan

Your solution
1. Analyze the pros and cons of each option. Include considerations besides total cost.
2. What seems to be the best course of action for LaRonda and why?
3. Can you think of another option for LaRonda that would save her money? Outline
your option and do a cost analysis as in the table.
The APR of a loan is a ﬁgure that allows consumers to compare loan fees. The APR
is the interest rate paid if the loan is held for 1 year. Complete the table again, assuming
that LaRonda borrows $250, holds it for 1 year and then pays off her debt. Include your
fourth option in the table.

GOOD ADVICE FOR STUDYING
Low-Stress Tests
I
t’s natural to be anxious before an exam. In fact, a little anxiety is actually good: it
keeps you alert and on your toes. Obviously, too much stress over tests is not good.
Here are some proven tips for taking low-stress tests.
1. Before going to the exam, ﬁnd a place on campus where you can physically and
mentally relax. Don’t come into the classroom in a rush.
2. Arrive at the classroom in time to arrange all the tools you will need for the test:
sharpened pencils, eraser, plenty of scratch paper, and a water bottle. Try to avoid
talking with classmates about the test. Instead, concentrate on deep breathing and
relaxation.
3. Before starting the test, on a separate piece of paper, write all the things you may
forget while you are busy at work: formulas, rules, deﬁnitions, and reminders to
yourself. Doing so relieves the load on your short-term memory.
4. Read all of the test problems and mark the easiest ones. Don’t skip reading the di-
rections. Note point values so you don’t spend too much time on problems that
count only a little, at the expense of problems that count a lot.
5. Do the easiest problems ﬁrst; do the rest of the problems in order of difﬁculty.
6. Estimate a reasonable answer before you make calculations. When you ﬁnish the
problem, check to see that your answer agrees with your estimate.
7. If you get stuck on a problem, mark it and come back to it later.
8. When you have ﬁnished trying all the problems, go back to the problems you 
didn’t ﬁnish and do what you can. Show all steps because you may get partial
credit even if you cannot complete a problem.
9. When you are ﬁnished, go back over the test to see that all the problems are as
complete as possible and that you have indicated your ﬁnal answer. Use all of the
time allowed, unless you are sure there is nothing more that you can do.
10. Turn in your test and be conﬁdent that you did the best job you could. Congrat-
ulate yourself on a low-stress test!
If you ﬁnd yourself feeling anxious, try a 3  5 “calming” card. It may include the
following: (a) a personal coping statement such as “I have studied hard and prepared
well for this test, I will do ﬁne”; (b) a brief description of your peaceful scene; and (c) a
reminder to stop, breathe, and relax your tense muscles.
By now, you should be closer to taking control of math instead of allowing math to
control you. You are avoiding learned helplessness (believing that other people or
inﬂuences control your life). Perfectionism, procrastination, fear of failure, and blaming
others are also ineffective attitudes that block your power of control. Take responsibility
and believe that you have the power within to control your life situation.

7.1 Measuring Length
OBJECTIVES
1. Recognize and use 
appropriate units of
length from the English
and metric measuring
systems.
2. Convert units of length
a. Unit fractions within
the same system.
b. Unit fractions 
between systems.
c. Moving the decimal

3. Perform operations on
measurements.
VOCABULARY
A unit of measure is the name of a ﬁxed quantity that is used as a
standard.
A measurement is a number together with a unit of measure.
Equivalent measurements are measures of the same amount but using
different units.
A unit fraction is a fraction whose numerator and denominator are equiva-
lent measurements.
The English system is the measurement system commonly used in the
United States.
The metric system is the measurement system used by most of the world.
How & Why
Recognize and use appropriate units of length
from the English and metric measuring systems.
One of the main ways of describing an object is to give its measurements. We measure how
long an object is, how much it weighs, how much space it occupies, how long it has existed,
how hot it is, and so forth. Units of measure are universally deﬁned so that we all mean the
same thing when we use a measurement. There are two major systems of measurement in
use in the United States. One is the English system, so named because we adopted what was
used in England at the time. This system is a mixture of units from various countries and
cultures, and it is the system with which most Americans are familiar. The second is the
metric system, which is currently used by almost the entire world.
Measures of length answer questions such as “How long?” or “How tall?” or 
“How deep?” We need units of length to measure small distances, medium distances, and
long distances. In the English system, we use inches to measure small distances, feet to
measure medium distances, and miles to measure long distances. Other, less common
units of length in the English system include yards, rods, fathoms, and light-years.
The metric system was invented by French scientists in 1799. Their goal was to make
a system that was easy to learn and would be used worldwide. They based the system for
length on the meter and related it to Earth by deﬁning it as 110,000,000 of the distance
between the North Pole and the equator.
To make the system easy to use, the scientists based all conversions on powers of 10
and gave the same sufﬁx to all units of measure for the same characteristic. So all units of
length in the metric system end in “-meter.” Furthermore, multiples of the base unit are
indicated by a preﬁx. So any unit beginning with “kilo-” means 1000 of the base unit. Any
unit beginning with “centi-” means 1100 of the base unit, and any unit beginning with
“milli-” means 11000 of the base unit.
Table 7.1 lists common units of length in both systems.

DIRECTIONS:
Write both an English unit and a metric unit to measure the following.
S T R A T E G Y :
Decide on the size of the object and pick the appropriate units.
A. The distance from Baltimore, Md., to Washington, D.C. 
This is a long distance, so it is measured in miles or kilometers.
B. The width of a calculator. 
This is a small distance, so it is measured in inches or centimeters.
C. The width of a dining room. 
This is a medium distance, so it is measured in feet or meters.

How & Why
Convert units of length—unit fractions within
the same system.
Using Table 7.2, we can convert measurements in each system.
OBJECTIVE 2a
Table 7.2
Equivalent Length Measurements
English
Metric 
12 inches (in.)  1 foot (ft)
1000 millimeters (mm)  1 meter (m)
3 feet (ft)  1 yard (yd)
100 centimeters (cm)  1 meter (m)
5280 feet (ft)  1 mile (mi)
1000 meters (m)  1 kilometer (km)
Because 12 in.  1 ft, they are equivalent measurements. A fraction using one of these as
the numerator and the other as the denominator is equivalent to 1 because the numerator
and denominator are equal.
To convert a measurement from one unit to another, we multiply by the unit fraction:
. Because we are multiplying by 1, the measurement is unchanged 
but the units are different.
For example, to convert 48 in. to feet, we choose a unit fraction that has feet, the
desired units in the numerator, and inches, the original units, in the denominator. In this 
case, we use 
for the conversion.
Multiply by the appropriate unit fraction.
Multiply.
Simplify.
In some cases, it is necessary to multiply by more than one unit fraction to get the
desired results. For example, to convert 5.2 km to centimeters we use the unit fraction 
to convert the kilometers to meters, and then 
to convert the meters to 
centimeters.

How & Why
Convert units of length—unit fractions 
between systems.
Sometimes we need to convert lengths from one system to another. Most conversions be-
tween systems are approximations, as in Table 7.3. The method of using unit fractions for
converting is the same as when converting within the same system.

Answers to Warm-Ups
D. 0.27 m
E. 760,320 in.
Because of the rounding in Table 7.3, we get approximate measurements when
moving from one system to another. For everyday measurements, this is not a problem
because we usually only measure to the nearest tenth or hundredth. However, in a labora-
tory or industrial setting, where more precision is necessary, you may need to use more

accurate conversions than those in Table 7.3. In changing measures from one system to
another, we will always use a unit fraction with denominator of 1. For example, when 
converting inches to centimeters we use 
whereas when converting from
centimeters to inches we use 
There are two reasons for this: (1) it is easier to 
multiply than to divide decimals when not using a calculator, and (2) it is possible for the
results to vary when using different approximating unit fractions.

Because the conversions in Table 7.3 are all rounded to the nearest 
ten-thousandth, we cannot expect accuracy beyond the ten-thousandths
place when using them.
How & Why
Convert units of length—moving the decimal
point in the metric system.
The metric system is based on powers of 10 and it is easy to multiply and divide by
powers of 10. Therefore, we can shortcut metric-to-metric conversions by multiplying or
dividing by powers of 10.
We have already seen how kilometers, centimeters, and millimeters relate to the base
unit, the meter. Other, less frequently used units are also part of the metric system.
Consider the following.

To convert within the metric system, simply determine how many places you must
move to get from the given unit to the desired unit. For example, to change kilometers to
meters we must move three places to the right.

7.1 Measuring Length
To change 4 km to meters, we multiply 4 km by 103 or 1000. So 4 km  4000 m.
To change centimeters to meters, we must move two places to the left.
To convert units within the metric system
Move the decimal point the same number of places and in the same 
direction as you do to go from the given units to the desired units on the
chart.
To change 85 cm to meters, we must divide by 100 or 102. So 85 cm  0.85 m.

When we write “4 inches,” we mean four units that are 1 inch in length. Mathematically
we can describe this as 4 inches
. This way of interpreting measurements
makes it easy to ﬁnd multiples of measurements. Consider 3 boards, each 5 feet long. The
total length of the boards is

Measures of capacity answer the question “How much liquid?” We use teaspoons to mea-
sure vanilla for a recipe, buy soda in 2-liter bottles, and measure gasoline in gallons or
liters. As is true for length, there are units of capacity in both the English and metric
systems. The basic unit of capacity in the metric system is the liter (L), which is slightly
more than 1 quart. Table 7.4 shows the most commonly used measures of capacity in each
system. Table 7.5 shows some equivalencies between the systems.

How & Why
Convert and perform operations on units of
weight.
Units of weight answer the question “How heavy is it?” In the English system, we use
ounces to measure the weight of baked beans in a can, pounds to measure the weight of a
person, and tons to measure the weight of a ship. In the metric system, the basic unit that
measures heaviness is the gram, which weighs about as much as a small paper clip. We
use grams to measure the weight of baked beans in a can, kilograms to measure the
weight of a person, and metric tons to measure the weight of a ship. Very small weights
like doses of vitamins are measured in milligrams. Table 7.6 lists the most commonly
used measures of weight in each system, and Table 7.7 shows some equivalencies be-
tween the systems.

7.2 Measuring Capacity, Weight, and Temperature
(Note: The weight of an object is different from its mass. An object has the same
mass everywhere in space. Weight depends on gravity, so an object has different weights
on Earth and on the moon. On Earth, gravity is approximately uniform, so weight and
mass are often used interchangeably. Technically, a gram is a unit of mass.)

How & Why
Convert units of temperature and time.
Temperature is measured in degrees. There are two major scales for measuring tempera-
ture. The English system uses the Fahrenheit scale, which sets the freezing point of water
at 32F and the boiling point of water at 212F. The Fahrenheit scale was developed by a
physicist named Gabriel Daniel Fahrenheit in the early 1700s.
The metric system uses the Celsius scale, which sets the freezing point of water at
0C and the boiling point of water at 100C. The Celsius scale is named after Swedish as-
tronomer Anders Celsius who lived in the early 1700s and invented a thermometer using
the Celsius scale.
Converting between scales is often done using special conversion formulas.

VOCABULARY
A polygon is any closed ﬁgure whose sides are line segments.
Polygons are named according to the number of sides they have. Table 7.9
lists some common polygons.
Quadrilaterals are polygons with four sides. Table 7.10 lists the characteris-
tics of common quadrilaterals.
The perimeter of a polygon is the distance around the outside of the polygon.
The circumference of a circle is the distance around the circle.
The radius of a circle is the distance from the center to any point on the circle.
The diameter of a circle is twice the radius.

How & Why
Find the perimeter of a polygon.
The perimeter of a ﬁgure can be thought of in terms of the distance traveled by walking
around the outside of it or by the length of a fence around the ﬁgure. The units of measure
used for perimeters are length measures, such as inches, feet, and meters. Perimeter is cal-
culated by adding the length of all the individual sides.
For example, to calculate the perimeter of this ﬁgure, we add the lengths of the sides.

How & Why
Find the circumference of a circle.
Formulas for geometric ﬁgures that involve circles contain the number called pi ( ). The
number 
is the quotient of the circumference of (distance around) the circle and its
diameter. This number is the same for every circle no matter how large or small. This
remarkable fact was discovered over a long period of time, and during that time a large
number of approximations have been used. Today, the most commonly used approxima-
tions are
Calculator note: Scientiﬁc and graphing calculators have a u key that generates
a decimal value for p with 8, 10, or 12 decimal places depending on the calculator.
Using the u key instead of one of the approximations increases the accuracy of your
calculations.

OBJECTIVES
1. Find the area of common

2. Convert units of area
measure.
VOCABULARY
Area is a measure of surface—that is, the amount of space inside a two-
dimensional ﬁgure. It is measured in square units.
The base of a geometric ﬁgure is a side parallel to the horizon.
The altitude or height of a geometric ﬁgure is the perpendicular (shortest)
distance from the base to the highest point of the ﬁgure.
Table 7.11 shows the base and altitude of some common geometric ﬁgures.
How & Why
Find the area of common polygons and circles.
Suppose you wish to tile a rectangular bathroom ﬂoor that measures 5 ft by 6 ft. The tiles
are 1-ft-by-1-ft squares. How many tiles do you need?

Using Figure 7.1 as a model of the tiled ﬂoor, you can count that 30 tiles are necessary.
Area is a measure of the surface—that is, the amount of space inside a two-dimensional
ﬁgure. It is measured in square units. Square units are literally squares that measure one unit
of length on each side. Figure 7.2 shows two examples.

7.4 Area
The measure of the square area on the left is 1 square centimeter, abbreviated 1 cm2.
The measure of the square area on the right is 1 square inch, abbreviated 1 in2. Recall that
the superscript in the abbreviation is simply part of the unit’s name. It does not indicate
an exponential operation.

Figure 7.2
In the bathroom ﬂoor example, each tile has an area of 1 ft2. So the number of tiles
needed is the same as the area of the room, 30 ft2. We could have arrived at this number
by multiplying the length of the room by the width. This is not a coincidence. It works for
all rectangles.
To ﬁnd the area of a rectangle
Multiply the length by the width.

To ﬁnd the area of other geometric shapes, we use the area of a rectangle as a
reference.

Now let’s consider the area of a triangle. We start with a right triangle—that is, a
triangle with one 90° angle. See Figure 7.3.
The triangle on the left has base b and height h. The ﬁgure on the right is a rectangle with
length b and width h. According to the formula for rectangles, the area is 
is
. However the rectangle is made up of two triangles, both of which have a base of
b and a height of h. The area of the rectangle (bh) is exactly twice the area of the triangle. 
So we conclude that the area of the triangle is

Now let’s consider a more general triangle. See Figure 7.4.

Again, the area on the left is a triangle with base b and height h. And the ﬁgure on the
right is a rectangle with length b and width h. Can you see that the rectangle must be
exactly twice the area of the original triangle? So again we conclude that the area of
the triangle is

Recall that height is the perpendicular distance from the base to the highest point of

The lengths, widths, bases, sides, and heights must all be measured using the same
units before the area formulas can be applied. If the units are different, convert to a com-
mon unit before calculating area.
The formula for the area of a circle is less intuitive than the formulas discussed thus
far. Nevertheless, the formula for the area of a circle has been known and used for many
years. Even though the sides of a circle are not line segments, we still measure the area in
square units.

How & Why
Convert units of area measure.
In the United States, we usually measure the dimensions of a room in feet, and so natu-
rally, we measure its area in square feet. However, carpeting is measured in square yards.
Therefore, if we want to buy carpeting for a room, we need to convert units of area
measure—in this case, from square feet to square yards. We proceed as before, using unit
fractions. The only difference is that we use the appropriate unit fraction twice, since we
are working with square units.
To change 100 ft2 to square yards, we write

How & Why
Find the volume of common geometric shapes.
Suppose you have a shoebox that measures 12 in. long by 4 in. wide by 5 in. high that you
want to use to store toy blocks that are 1 in. by 1 in. by 1 in. How many blocks will ﬁt in
the box? See Figure 7.5.
Figure 7.5
In each layer there are 12(4)  48 blocks and there are 5 layers. Therefore, the box holds
12(4)(5)  240 blocks.
Volume is a measure of the amount of space contained in a three-dimensional object.
Often, volume is measured in cubic units. These units are literally cubes that measure one
unit on each side. For example, Figure 7.6 shows a cubic inch (1 in3) and a cubic cen-
timeter (1 cm3).
Figure 7.6
The shoebox has a volume of 240 in3 because exactly 240 blocks, which have a
volume of 1 in3 each, can ﬁt in the box and totally ﬁll it up.
In general, volume can be thought of as the number of cubes that ﬁll up a space. If the
space is a rectangular solid, like the shoebox, it is a relatively easy matter to determine the
volume by making a layer of cubes that covers the bottom and then deciding how many
layers are necessary to ﬁll the box.

VOCABULARY
A cube is a three-dimensional geometric solid that has six sides (called
faces), each of which is a square.
Volume is the name given to the amount of space that is contained inside a
three-dimensional object.

7.5 Volume
Observe that the number of cubes necessary for the bottom layer is the same as the
area of the base of the box, w. The number of layers needed is the same as the height of
the box, h. So we have the following volume formulas.
To ﬁnd the volume of a rectangular solid
Multiply the length by the width by the height.
V  wh
To ﬁnd the volume of a cube
Cube the measure of one of the sides.
V  s3
The length, width, and height must all be measured using the same units before the
volume formulas may be applied. If the units are different, convert to a common unit be-
fore calculating the volume.
The principle used for ﬁnding the volume of a box can be extended to any solid with
sides that are perpendicular to the base. The area of the base gives the number of cubes
necessary to make the bottom layer, and the height gives the number of layers necessary
to ﬁll the solid. See Figure 7.7.

10,368 in3.
To verify that 6 ft3  10,368 in3, and to convert units of volume in general, we use unit
fractions. Because we are converting cubic units, we use the unit fraction three times.

When measuring the capacity of a solid to hold liquid, we sometimes use special
units. Recall that in the English system, liquid capacity is measured in ounces, quarts, and
gallons. In the metric system, milliliters, liters, and kiloliters are used. One cubic cen-
timeter measures the same volume as one milliliter. That is, 1 cm3  1 mL. So a container
with a volume of 50 cm3 holds 50 mL of liquid.

Find the square root of a number.
The relationship between squares and square roots is similar to the relationship between
multiples and factors. In Chapter 2, we saw that if one number is a multiple of a second
number, then the second number is a factor of the ﬁrst number. It is also true that if one
number is the square of a second number, then the second number is a square root of
the ﬁrst. For example, the number 81 is the square of 9, so 9 is a square root of 81. We
write this: 92  81 so

When we need to ﬁnd the square root of a number that is not a perfect square, the
method of guess and check is possible but usually too time-consuming to be practical. To
further complicate matters, square roots of nonperfect squares are nonterminating deci-
mals. In these cases, we ﬁnd an approximation of the desired square root and round to a
convenient decimal place. For instance, consider

before entering the number, and others require that you enter the number ﬁrst.

To ﬁnd the square root of a number
Use the square root key, z, on a calculator. Round as necessary.

How & Why
Apply the Pythagorean theorem.
A right triangle is a triangle with one right (90°) angle. Figure 7.8 shows the right angle,
legs, and hypotenuse of a right triangle.
Figure 7.8
Thousands of years ago, a Greek named Pythagoras discovered that the lengths of
the sides of a right triangle have a special relationship. This relationship is known as
the Pythagorean theorem.
The Pythagorean theorem enables us to calculate the length of the third side of a right
triangle when we know the lengths of the other two sides. Because the Pythagorean theorem
involves the squares of the sides, when we want the length of a side, we need to use square
roots. The following formulas are used to calculate an unknown side of a right triangle.

above the ground on the tree and 6 ft from the base of the tree. He needs one extra foot
of rope on each end for tying. How much rope does he need?
S T R A T E G Y :
The tree trunk, the ground, and the rope form a right triangle, with the
rope being the hypotenuse of the triangle. We use the formula for ﬁnd-
ing the hypotenuse.

The base cabinets are all 30 in. high and 24 in. deep. The widths can be any multiple of
3 from 12 in. to 36 in. Corner units are 36 in. along the wall in each direction. The base
cabinets (and the range, dishwasher, and compactor) will all be installed on 4-in. bases
that are 20 in. deep.
The wall (upper) cabinets are all 30 in. high and 12 in. deep. Here, too, the widths can
be any multiple of 3 from 12 in. to 36 in. Corner units are 24 in. along the wall in each
direction.
1. The ﬁrst step is to place the cabinets and appliances. Your client has speciﬁed that there
must be at least 80 ft3 of cabinet space. Make a scale drawing of the kitchen and indi-
cate the placement of the cabinets and appliances. Show calculations to justify that
your plan satisﬁes that 80 ft3 requirement.

2. Countertops measure 25 in. deep with a 4-in. backsplash. The countertops can either
be tile or Formica. If the counters are Formica, there will be a 2-in. facing of Formica.
If the counters are tile, the facing will be wood that matches the cabinets. (See the
ﬁgure.) Calculate the amount of tile and wood needed for the counters and the amount
of Formica needed for the counters.
3. The bases under the base cabinets will be covered with a rubber kickplate that is 4 in.
high and comes in 8-ft lengths. Calculate the total length of kickplate material needed
and the number of lengths of kickplate material necessary to complete the kitchen.
4. Take your plan to a store that sells kitchen appliances, cabinets, and counters. Your
goal is to get the best-quality materials for the least amount of money. Prepare at least
two cost estimates for the client. Do not include labor in your estimates, but do include
the cost of the appliances. Prepare a rationale for each estimate, explaining the choices
you made. Which plan will you recommend to the client, and why?

GOOD ADVICE FOR STUDYING
Evaluating Your
Performance
P
ick up your graded test as soon as possible, while the test is still fresh in your mind.
No matter what your score, the time you spend reviewing errors you may have
made can help improve future test scores. Don’t skip the important step of “evaluating
your performance.” Begin by categorizing your errors:
1. Careless errors. These occur when you know how to do the problem correctly but
don’t. Careless errors happen when you read the directions incorrectly, make com-
putational errors, or forget to do the problem.
2. Concept errors. These occur because you don’t grasp the concept fully or accu-
rately. Even if you did the problem again, you would probably make the same error.
3. Study errors. These occur when you do not spend enough time studying the mate-
rial most pertinent to the test.
4. Application errors. These usually occur when you are not sure what concept to use.
If you made a careless error, ask yourself if you followed all the suggestions for bet-
ter test taking. If you didn’t, vow to do so on the next test. List what you will do differ-
ently next time so that you can minimize these careless errors in the future.
Concept errors need more time to correct. You must review what you didn’t un-
derstand or you will repeat your mistakes. It is important to grasp the concepts because
you will use them later. You may need to seek help from your instructor or a tutor for
these kinds of errors.
Avoid study errors by asking the teacher before the test what concepts are most
important. Also, pay careful attention to the section objectives because these clarify
what you are expected to know.
You can avoid application errors by doing as many of the word problems as you
can. Reading the strategies for word problems can help you think about how to start
a problem. It also helps to mix up the problems between sections and to do even-
numbered problems, for which you do not have answers. It is especially important to try
to estimate a reasonable answer before you start calculations.
As a ﬁnal step in evaluating your performance, take time to think about what you
said to yourself during the test. Was this self-talk positive or negative? If the talk was
helpful, remember it. Use it again. If not, here are a few suggestions. Be certain that you
are keeping a detailed record of your reactions to anxiety. Separate your thoughts from
your feelings. Use cue words as signals to begin building coping statements. Your coping
statements must challenge your negative belief patterns and they must be believable, not
merely pep talk such as “I can do well, I won’t worry about it.” Make the statements brief
and state them in the present tense.
Learn from your mistakes so you can use what you have learned on the next test. If
you are satisﬁed with the results of the test overall, congratulate yourself. You have
earned it.

The National Geographic Society was founded in 1888
“for the increase and diffusion of geographic knowledge.”
The Society has supported more than 5000 explorations
and research projects with the intent of “adding to knowl-
edge of earth, sea, and sky.” Among the many facts cata-
logued about our planet, the Society keeps records of the
elevations of various geographic features. Table 8.1 lists
the highest and lowest points on each continent.
When measuring, one has to know where to begin,
or the zero point. Notice that when measuring elevations,
the zero point is chosen to be sea level (Figure 8.1). All
elevations compare the high or low point to sea level.
Mathematicallywerepresentquantitiesunderthezeropoint
as negative numbers.
What location has the highest continental altitude on Earth? What location has the
lowest continental altitude? Is there a location on Earth with a lower altitude? Explain.

How & Why
Find the opposite of a signed number.
Expressions such as
6 – 8
9 – 24
11 – 12
and
4 – 134
do not have answers in the numbers of arithmetic. The answer to each is a signed number.
Signed numbers (which include both numbers to the right of zero and to the left of zero)
are used to represent quantities with opposite characteristics. For instance,
right and left
up and down
above zero and below zero
gain and loss
A few signed numbers are shown on the number line in Figure 8.2.

Opposites and Absolute Value
OBJECTIVES
1. Find the opposite of a
signed number.
2. Find the absolute value 
of a signed number.
VOCABULARY
Positive numbers are the numbers of arithmetic and are greater than zero.
Negative numbers are numbers less than zero. Zero is neither positive nor
negative. Positive numbers, zero, and negative numbers are called signed
numbers.
The opposite or additive inverse of a signed number is the number on the
number line that is the same distance from zero but on the opposite side of
it. Zero is its own opposite. The opposite of 5 is written –5. This can be read
“the opposite of 5” or “negative 5,” since they both name the same number.
The absolute value of a signed number is the number of units between the
number and zero. The expression 060 is read “the absolute value of 6.”

The negative numbers are to the left of zero. The negative numbers have a dash, or nega-
tive sign, in front of them. The numbers to the right of zero are called positive (and may
be written with a plus sign). Zero is neither positive nor negative. Here are some signed
numbers.

In any situation in which quantities can be measured in opposite directions, positive
and negative numbers can be used to show direction.
The dash in front of a number is read in two different ways:

The opposite of a number is the number on the number line that is the same distance
from zero but on the opposite side. To ﬁnd the opposite of a number, we refer to a num-
ber line. See Figure 8.3.

Find the opposite.
S T R A T E G Y :
The opposite of a number is found on the number line the same num-
ber of units from zero but on the opposite side of zero.
A. Find the opposite of 14.
S T R A T E G Y :
With no sign in front, the number is positive; 14 is read “fourteen” or
“positive fourteen.”
1142  ?
Because 14 is 14 units to the right of zero, the opposite of 14 is
14 units to the left of zero.
1142  14
The opposite of 14 is 14.
B. Find the opposite of 28.
S T R A T E G Y :
The number 28 can be thought of in two ways: as a negative number
that is 28 units to the left of zero, or as a number that is 28 units on the
opposite side of zero from 28; 28 is read “negative 28” or “the op-
posite of 28.”
1282  ?
The opposite of negative 28 is written (28) and is found 28 units
1282  28

S T R A T E G Y :
First ﬁnd 1112. Then ﬁnd the opposite of that value.
1112 is “the opposite of negative 11”
1112  ?
1112  11
So the opposite of 1112  11.
Continuing, we ﬁnd the opposite of 1112, which is written [1112].
[1112]  [11]
 11
The opposite of 1112  11.
(11) can also be read “the opposite
of the opposite of 11.”
The opposite of 11 is 11 units to the
right of zero, which is 11.

How & Why
Find the absolute value of a signed number.
The absolute value of a signed number is the number of units between the number and
zero on the number line. Absolute value is deﬁned as the number of units only; direction
is not involved. Therefore, the absolute value is never negative.

D. Find the opposite of 19, 2.3, and 4.7.
S T R A T E G Y :
The j or the q key on the calculator will give the opposite of the
number.
Calculator note: Some calculators require that you enter the number and then press
the j key. Others require that you press the q key and then enter the number.
The opposites are 19, 2.3, and 4.7.
E. If 10% ofAmericans purchased products with no plastic packaging just 10% of the time,
approximately 144,000 lb of plastic would be eliminated (taken out of or decreased)
from our landﬁlls.
1. Write this decrease as a signed number.
2. Write the opposite of eliminating (decreasing) 144,000 lb of plastic from our land-
ﬁlls as a signed number.
1. Decreases are often represented by negative numbers. Therefore, a decrease of
144,000 lb is 144,000 lb.
2. The opposite of a decrease is an increase, so (144,000 lb) is 144,000 lb.
D. Find the opposite of 13,
7.8, and 7.1.
E. The energy used to produce
a pound of rubber is 
15,700 BTU. Recycled
rubber requires 4100 BTU
less.
1. Express this decrease as a
signed number.
2. Express the opposite of a
decrease of 4100 BTU as
a signed number.
To ﬁnd the absolute value of a signed number
The value is
1. zero if the number is zero.
2. the number itself if the number is positive.
3. the opposite of the number if the number is negative.
From Figure 8.4, we can see that the absolute value of a number and the absolute
value of the number’s opposite are equal. For example
Because both equal 45.
The absolute value of a positive number is the number itself. The absolute value of a
negative number is its opposite. The absolute value of zero is zero.

77. If n is a negative number, what kind a number is n?
78. For what numbers is 0n0  n always true?

How & Why
Add signed numbers.
Positive and negative numbers are used to show opposite quantities:
482 lb may show 482 lb loaded
577 lb may show 577 lb unloaded
27 dollars may show 27 dollars earned
19 dollars may show 19 dollars spent
We can use this idea to ﬁnd the sum of signed numbers. We already know how to add two
positive numbers, so we concentrate on adding positive and negative numbers.
Think of 27 dollars earned (positive) and 19 dollars spent (negative). The result is
8 dollars left in your pocket (positive). So
27  (19)  8
To get this sum, we subtract the absolute value of 19(19) from the absolute value of
27(27). The sum is positive.
Think of 23 dollars spent (negative) and 15 dollars earned (positive). The result is
that you still owe 8 dollars (negative). So
23  15  8
To get this sum, subtract the absolute value of 15(15) from the absolute value of
23(23). The sum is negative.
Think of 5 dollars spent (negative) and another 2 dollars spent (negative). The result
is 7 dollars spent (negative). So
5  (2)  7
To get this sum we add 5 to 2 (the absolute value of each). The sum is negative.
The results of the examples lead us to the procedure for adding signed numbers.
OBJECTIVE

8.2 Adding Signed Numbers
683
To add signed numbers
1. If the signs are alike, add their absolute values and use the common sign
for the sum.
2. If the signs are not alike, subtract the smaller absolute value from the
larger absolute value. The sum will have the sign of the number with the
larger absolute value.
As a result of this deﬁnition, the sum of a number and its opposite is zero. Thus,

Subtracting Signed Numbers
8.3 Subtracting Signed Numbers
691
How & Why
Subtract signed numbers.
The expression 11  7  ? can be restated using addition: 7  ?  11. We know that
7  4  11 and so 11  7  4. We use the fact that every subtraction fact can be restated
as addition to discover how to subtract signed numbers. Consider 4  8  ?. Restating,
we have 8  ?  4. We know that 8  (12)  4 so we conclude that 4 8  12.
The expression 5  (3)  ? can be restated as 3  ?  5. Because
3  (2)  5 we conclude that 5  (3)  2.
To discover the rule for subtraction of signed numbers, compare:
11  7
and
11  (7)
Both equal 4
4  8
and
4  (8)
Both equal 12
5  (3)
and
5  3
Both equal 2
Every subtraction problem can be worked by asking what number added to the subtra-
hend will yield the minuend. However, when we look at the second column we see an
addition problem that gives the same answer as the original subtraction problem. In each
case the opposite (additive inverse) of the number being subtracted is added. Let’s look at
three more examples.
Answer Obtained
Answer Obtained

19  7  12
19  (7)  12
7 is the opposite of 7, the
number to be subtracted.
32  45  77
32  (45)  77
45 is the opposite of 45, the
number to be subtracted.
21  (12)  9
21  12  9
12 is the opposite of 12, the
number to be subtracted.
This leads us to the rule for subtracting signed numbers.
OBJECTIVE
To subtract signed numbers
1. Rewrite as an addition problem by adding the opposite of the number to

How & Why
Multiply a positive number and a negative number.
Consider the following multiplications:
3(4)  12
3(3)  9
3(2)  6
3(1)  3
3(0)  0
3(1)  ?
3(2)  ?
Each product is 3 smaller than the one before it. Continuing this pattern,
3(1)  3
Because 0  3  3
and
3(2)  6
Because –3 – 3  – 6
The pattern indicates that the product of a positive and a negative number is negative; that
is, the opposite of the product of their absolute values.

How & Why
Divide a positive number and a negative number.
To divide two signed numbers, we ﬁnd the number that when multiplied times the divi-
sor equals the dividend. The expression 9  3  ? asks 3(?) 9; we know 3(3) 
9, so 9  3  3. The expression 24  (6)  ? asks 6(?)  24; we know
6(4)  24, so 24  (6)  4.
When dividing unlike signs, we see that the quotient is negative. We use these exam-
ples to state how to divide a negative number and a positive number.

Divide two negative numbers.
To determine how to divide two negative numbers, we again use the relationship to
multiplication.
The expression 21  (7)  ? asks (7)(?)  21; we know that 7(3)  21,
so 21  (7)  3. The expression 30  (6)  ? asks (6)(?)  30; we know that

The process of solving equations that are of the form ax  b  c and ax  b  c,
using signed numbers, involves two operations to isolate the variable. To isolate the vari-
able is to get an equation in which the variable is the only symbol on a particular side of
the equation.

Professional Golf Association, LPGA; and the Champions Tour. These scores can usually
be found on the summary page in the sports section of the daily newspaper.
1. Record the scores, against par, for the 30 top ﬁnishers and ties on each tour. Display
the data using bar graphs for week 1, line graphs for week 2, and bar graphs for
week 3. Which type of graph best displays the data?
2. Calculate the average score, against par, for each tour for each week. When ﬁnding the
average, if there is a remainder and it is half of or more than the divisor, round up, oth-
erwise round down. Now average the average scores for each tour. Which tour scored
the best? Why?
3. What is the difference between the best and worst scores on each tour for each week?
4. What is the average amount of money earned by the player whose scores were

APPENDIX A
CALCULATORS
A-1
The wide availability and economical price of current hand-held calculators make them
ideal for doing time-consuming arithmetic operations. Even people who are very good at
math use calculators under certain circumstances (for instance, when balancing their
checkbooks). You are encouraged to use a calculator as you work through this text. Learn-
ing the proper and appropriate use of a calculator is a vital skill for today’s math students.
As with all new skills, your instructor will give you guidance as to where and when
to use it. Calculators are especially useful in the following instances:
• For doing the fundamental operations of arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division)
• For ﬁnding powers or square roots of numbers
• For evaluating complicated arithmetic expressions
• For checking solutions to equations
Several different kinds of calculators are available.
• A basic 4-function calculator will add, subtract, multiply and divide. Sometimes these
calculators also have a square root key. These calculators are not powerful enough to do
all of the math in this text, and they are not recommended for math students at this level.
• A scientiﬁc calculator generally has about eight rows of keys on it and is usually labeled
“scientiﬁc.” Look for keys labeled “sin,” “tan,” and “log.” Scientiﬁc calculators also
have power keys and parenthesis keys, and the order of operations is built into them.
These calculators are recommended for math students at this level.
• A graphing calculator also has about eight rows of keys, but it has a large, nearly square
display screen. These calculators are very powerful, and you may be required to purchase
them in later math courses. However, you will not need all that power to be successful in
this course, and they are signiﬁcantly more expensive than scientiﬁc calculators.
We will assume that you are operating a scientiﬁc calculator. (Some of the keystrokes are
different on graphing calculators, so if you are using one of these calculators, please consult
your owner’s manual.) Study the following table to discover how the basic keys are used.

Notice that the calculator does calculations when you hit the 
or ENTER key. The
calculator automatically uses the order of operations when you enter more than one
operation before hitting 
or ENTER. Notice that if you begin a sequence with an
operation sign, the calculator automatically uses the number currently displayed as part of
the calculation. There are three operations that require only one number: squaring a
number, square rooting a number, and taking the opposite of a number. In each case, enter
the number ﬁrst and then hit the appropriate operation key. Be especially careful with
fractions. Remember that when there is addition or subtraction inside a fraction, the
fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol. But the only way to convey this to your calculator
is by using the grouping symbols 
and . Notice that the fraction key is used between
the numerator and denominator of a fraction and also between the whole number and
fractional part of a mixed number. It automatically calculates the common denominator
when necessary.

65. The different words help us to describe the process we are
using. Saying “9 is a factor of 135” means that 9 times some
whole number is 135. The process is multiplication. The state-
ment “9 is a divisor of 135” means that 9 divides 135 evenly.
The process is division.

87. The decimal point in a quotient is positioned directly
above the decimal point in the dividend when dividing by
a whole number. When dividing by a decimal, move the
decimal point in the divisor to make it a whole number.
Move the decimal point in the dividend the same number
of places. Now the decimal point in the quotient is
positioned above the relocated decimal in the dividend.
This works because a division problem may be
thought of as a fraction 
and moving the 
decimals in both the same number of places to the right is
the same as multiplying a fraction by 1 in the form of some
power of 10 over itself.

the problem [0.3(5.1)2  8.3]  5, the entire quantity
[0.3(5.1)2  8.3] is divided by 5. The insertion of the brackets
has changed the order of operations so that we add before
dividing because the addition is inside grouping symbols.

55. The problem is in equating a 40¢ proﬁt with a 40% proﬁt.
A 40¢ proﬁt means that the company makes 40¢ on each part
sold.A 40% proﬁt means that the company makes 40% of the
cost on each part. But 40% of 30¢ is only 12¢. So a 40% proﬁt
would mean selling the parts for 42¢. The company is making
a much higher proﬁt than that. The 40¢ proﬁt is actually 133%
of the cost.

69. Adding signed numbers can be thought of as moving
along a number line according to the absolute value and sign
of the numbers. Starting at zero, move as many spaces as the
absolute value of the ﬁrst number. Move right if the number
is positive and left if it is negative. Then move according to
the second number. The sign of the sum is determined by
which side of zero you end up on. So if you have moved
right for more spaces than you have moved left, the sum will
be positive. And if you have moved left more spaces than
you have moved right, the sum will be negative. Symboli-
cally, compare the absolute values of the numbers being
added. The sign of the one with the largest absolute value
(corresponding to the most spaces moved in a particular 
direction) is the sign of the answer.

Using Access Codes
Some classes require an access code for admission. Please
remember:
❍An access code is not the same as a Class Key or a login
password.
❍An access code is good for one class only unless the text-
book includes a two-term access code.
❍An access code is an alphanumeric code that is usually
packaged with your textbook. It can begin with 2 or 3 letters,
followed by an alphanumeric code, or it can have a longer
prefix such as BCEnhanced-S followed by four sets of four
characters.
❍If your textbook did not include an access code, you can buy
one at your bookstore, or from your personalized Home page
by clicking the Purchase an access code online button.

ANSWERING QUESTIONS
Enhanced WebAssign uses a variety of question types that you’re
probably already familiar with using, such as multiple choice,
true/false, free response, etc.
Always be sure to pay close attention to any instructions within the
question regarding how you are supposed to submit your answers.
Numerical Questions
There are a few key points to keep in mind when working on numeri-
cal questions:
❍Numbers can be entered in both scientific notation and
numerical expressions, such as fractions.
❍WebAssign uses the standard scientific notation “E” or “e” for
“times 10 raised to the power.” (Note: both uppercase E and
lowercase e are acceptable in WebAssign.) For example, 1e3
is the scientific notation for 1000.
❍Numerical answers may not contain commas ( , ) or equal
signs ( = ).
❍Numerical answers may only contain:
•
Numbers
•
E or e for scientific notation
•
Mathematical operators +, -, *, /
❍Numerical answers within 1% of the actual answer are count-
ed as correct, unless your instructor chooses a different toler-
ance. This is to account for rounding errors in calculations. In
general, enter three significant figures for numerical answers.

Numerical Questions with Units
Some Enhanced WebAssign questions require a number and a unit,
and this is generally, although not always, indicated in the instructions
in the question.
You will know that a unit is expected when there is no unit after the
answer box.
When you are expected to enter units and do not, you will get an error
message telling you that units are required.
Note: Whether omission of the unit counts as a submission depends
on the submission options chosen by the instructor.
Answering Questions
18
The Start Smart Guide for Students

The easiest units to use in this question are m, but the answer con-
verted to yd would also be scored correct.
Numerical Questions with Significant Figures
Some numerical questions require a specific number of significant fig-
ures (sig figs) in your answer. If a question checks sig figs, you will
see a sig fig icon next to the answer box.
If you enter the correct value with the wrong number of sig figs, you
will not receive credit, but you will receive a hint that your number
does not have the correct number of sig figs. The sig fig icon 
is also a link to the rules used for sig figs in WebAssign.

plicated symbol and notation entry in calculus. It functions in a similar
manner to the MathPad described above. If your course uses
CalcPad, check online for additional instructions.
Math Notation: Using the Keyboard
If you use your keyboard to enter math notation (calculator notation),
you must use the exact variables specified in the questions.
The order is not important, as long as it is mathematically correct.

The GraphPad currently supports points, rays, segments,
lines, circles, and parabolas. Inequalities can also be indicated
by filling one or more areas.
GraphPad Interface Overview
The middle of GraphPad is the drawing area. It contains
labeled coordinate axes, which may have different axis scales
and extents depending on the nature of the question you are
working on.
On the left side of GraphPad is the list of Tools that lets you
create graph objects and select objects to edit.
The bottom of the GraphPad is the Object Properties toolbar,
which becomes active when you have a graph element se-
lected. This toolbar shows you all the details about the se-
lected graph object and also lets you edit properties of that.
On the right side of GraphPad is the list of Actions that lets
you create fills and delete objects from your graph.
Drawing Graph Objects
To draw a line, first click on the line button in the Tools area.
The line button will highlight to blue, and then you can place

two points (which are on that line) by clicking twice within the
drawing area. Don’t worry if you don’t place the line exactly
where you want it initially; you can move these points around
before submitting for grading. The arrows on the end of the
line indicate that the line goes off to infinity on both ends.
To draw a ray or a segment, first click the small arrow on the
right side of the line button to open the selection of line-type
tools. Choose ray or segment, and then place it by clicking
twice within the drawing area. For rays, the first point is the
endpoint of the ray. The arrow on the other end of the ray indi-
cates that it goes off to infinity on that end.
Circles, points, and parabolas can be drawn in the same man-
ner. Circles are drawn by placing a point at the center first,
then a point on the radius of the circle. Parabolas are drawn by
placing the vertex first, then a point on the parabola. Parabolas
can be horizontal or vertical. Points are even easier—just click
the point button and then click where you want the point to
appear.
Selecting Graph Objects
To edit a graph object you have drawn, that object must be
“selected” as the active object. (When you first draw an object,
it is created in the selected state.) When a graph element is
“selected”, the color of the line changes and two “handles” are
visible. The handles are the two square points you clicked to
create the object. To select an object, click on the object’s line.
To deselect the object, click on the object’s line, a blank area
on the drawing area, or a drawing tool.

Moving and Editing Graph Objects 
Once an object is selected, you can modify it by using your
mouse or the keyboard. As you move it, you’ll notice that you
cannot move the handles off the drawing area.
To move an object with the mouse, click and drag the object’s
line. Or click and drag one of the handles to move just that
handle.
On the keyboard, the arrow keys also move the selected
object around by one unit.
As you move the object or handle you’ll see that the Object
Properties toolbar changes to remain up to date.
You can also use the coordinate boxes in the Object
Properties toolbar to edit the coordinates of the handles
directly. Use this method to enter decimal or fractional
coordinates.
Using Fractions or Decimals as Coordinates
To draw an object with handle coordinates that are fractions or
decimals, you must use the Object Properties toolbar. Draw
the desired object anywhere on the drawing area, then use
the coordinate boxes in the Object Properties toolbar to
change the endpoint(s) to the desired value. To enter a frac-
tion just type “3/4”, for example.
Note: The points and lines you draw must be exactly correct when
you submit for grading. This means you should not round any of
your values—if you want a point at 11/3, you should enter 11/3 in
the coordinate box rather than 3.667. Also, mixed fractions are not
acceptable entries. This means that 3 2/3 is an incorrect entry.

Endpoints—Closed or Open?
If the selected object is a segment or ray, the Endpoint con-
trols in the Object Properties toolbar can be clicked to toggle
the endpoint from closed to open.
As a shortcut, you can also toggle an endpoint by clicking on
the endpoint when the ray or segment is in the unselected
state.
Graph Objects—Solid or Dashed?
For any selected object other than a point, the Solid/Dash but-
tons in the Object Properties toolbar can be used to make the
object solid or dashed. To change graph objects to solid or
dashed (for inequalities, for example), select the object and
click the Solid or Dash button.
Specifying a Region with a Fill for Inequalities 
To graph an inequality, you must specify a region on the
graph. To do this, first draw the line(s), circle(s), or other
object(s) that will define the region you want to represent your

answer. Be sure to specify the objects as either solid or
dashed, according to the inequality you are graphing! Then
choose the fill button in the Actions area, and click inside the
region that you want filled.
If you decide you wanted the fill in a different area, you can
use the fill tool again to undo and then redo the fill in a differ-
ent location. Choose the fill tool, click the filled region that you
want to unfill, and then click the region that you do want to fill.
Erasing One Graph Object 
To erase a single graph object, first select that element in the
drawing area, then click the Delete icon in the Actions area or
press the Delete key on your keyboard.
Erasing Everything on Your Graph 
The Clear All button in the Actions area will erase all of your
graph objects. (If the drawing area is already empty, the Clear
All button is disabled.)

Next, you would define the line as dashed since the inequality
