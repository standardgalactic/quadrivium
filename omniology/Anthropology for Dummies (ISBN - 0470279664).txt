About the Authors
Cameron M. Smith’s fascination with humanity was sparked on a 1984 trip to 
Mexico’s Maya ruins; by 1987, he was a student of both Harvard University’s 
early human archaeology field school at Kenya’s Leakey research station and 
the University of London’s Institute of Archaeology. He then went to Durham 
University in northern England for a Joint Honours BA in Anthropology & 
Archaeology, followed by an MA in Anthropology at Portland State University 
(in Portland, Oregon) and a PhD from Canada’s Simon Fraser University.
Since 2002, Dr. Smith has taught a wide variety of courses as an Adjunct 
Associate Professor at Portland State University’s Department of 
Anthropology; he has also taught at Washington State University and Linfield 
College.
Dr. Smith’s scientific works have been published in journals such as the 
American Journal of Physical Anthropology and the Journal of Field 
Archaeology and books published by International Monographs in Prehistory 
and Oxford’s British Archaeology Reports. His research has been supported 
by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Science 
Foundation-funded Barrow Arctic Science Consortium.
Reaching out from the academic world, Dr. Smith has written popular-science 
articles for Scientific American MIND, Archaeology, Playboy, Spaceflight, 
Skeptical Inquirer, South American Explorer, The Next Step, Cultural Survival 
Quarterly, The Bulletin of Primitive Technology, and other magazines. 
Anthropology For Dummies is Dr. Smith’s second book. His first, written with 
Charles Sullivan, was The Top Ten Myths About Evolution (Prometheus, 2006).
Outside his academic pursuits, Dr. Smith enjoys mountaineering, art, and arc-
tic exploration. He is a Life Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, a Fellow 
of The Explorers Club and a member of the Society for Human Performance 
in Extreme Environments. His Web site, www.cameronmsmith.com, covers 
his recent writing, academic, and expedition activities.
Evan T. Davies received his BA from Cornell University where he began his 
studies in anthropology. He earned a PhD in cultural anthropology from Rice 
University, and has conducted fieldwork throughout Europe, the South 
Pacific, and in many locations throughout sub-Saharan Africa. His doctoral 
dissertation reported on the land use patterns of the BaAka foragers of the 
central African rainforests whose subsistence and hunting strategies he stud-
ied while living with them through the seasons. He has recently become 
involved with the protection of archaeological sites in Iraq.

Dedications
From Cameron: I dedicate this book to all the anthropologists who have 
spent careers investigating fundamental questions about humanity, and to 
their hosts, the indigenous folk of everywhere from Africa to Australia.
From Evan: To my parents, and every good teacher I ever had.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
From Cameron: I’d like to thank my parents, professors Donald E. and Margit 
J. Posluschny Smith, for stimulating my interest in the human species in the 
first place and then supporting my education, worldwide, for many years.
I also thank all of my professors, from Britain to Canada and the United 
States, from physical anthropologists to cultural anthropologists to linguists 
and many, many archaeologists. There are too many to name, though I can 
highlight Professors Brian Hayden, Kenneth M. Ames, Anthony Harding, 
Anthony Bilsborough, and the late Jack Nance.
Although I wrote the bulk of this book, I turned to my friend Dr. Evan T. 
Davies to draft Chapter 12 on how cultural anthropologists do their field-
work. Dr. Davies’ experience runs from field experiences in the Congo to New 
Guinea and the Near East, and I thank him for his work on this chapter.
I’ve been privileged to have the friendship of many fascinating people who 
have led to many fascinating discussions, all of which simmer for months and 
eventually find their way into my overall writing style and content. These 
folks include my occasional coauthor Chuck Sullivan, my brothers Mark and 
Julian, and my friends John Haslett, W. McRee Anderson, and Todd Olson. I 
especially thank Ms. Christine Calfas for her companionship and compassion.
I also thank all the members of the Leora writing group in Portland for their 
great advice and good humor on various writing projects.
I also want to thank my agent, Matt Wagner, of Fresh Books literary agency, 
for suggesting this project in the first place, as well as Senior Project Editor 
Alissa Schwipps, Acquisitions Editor Lindsay Lefevere, Technical Editor 
Robert J. Meier, PhD, and the artists at Wiley Publishing for their great work, 
support, and patience.

None of these folks are dummies, and neither are my readers; the title of the 
book is tongue-in-cheek. So, finally, I thank all of you readers for taking the 
time to think about humanity in a new way.
From Evan: I’d like to thank Steven Tyler, professor of anthropology and lin-
guistics at Rice University, for some very helpful guidance during the writing; 
the members of the Explorers Club for their continued inspiration to a new 
generation of field researchers; and Dr. Cameron M. Smith, colleague and 
friend. May we have at least 20 good years of expeditioning left in us.

Introduction
R
ight now, someone somewhere is digging up an ancient relic — perhaps 
a stone tool a million years old or the remains of an ancient Greek wine 
jug. That one artifact may not be much, but it’s a piece in the vast jigsaw 
puzzle of humanity’s ancient past.
Right now, someone somewhere is interviewing a hunter–gatherer — maybe 
in the Arctic or in Africa. That one interview — maybe about why the hunter-
gatherer is going to split away from the main group with his family — may 
not be much, but it’s a page in the encyclopedia of human cultural behavior.
Right now, someone somewhere is decoding ancient Neanderthal DNA, trying 
to identify how living humans are related to this fascinating proto-human spe-
cies. The fragment of DNA is microscopic, but it can tell humanity a tremen-
dous amount about our biology and evolution.
And right now, someone somewhere is studying a rapidly vanishing lan-
guage — maybe in Polynesia or Southeast Asia — by learning it from a tribal 
group’s elders. The words and phrases she’s learning are short, but each lan-
guage provides a new way to understand the world in a uniquely human way.
All of those someones are anthropologists, like me — people who profes-
sionally study the human species in all its aspects, from biology to culture. 
Of course, it’s not just anthropologists who love to learn about humanity; 
people from every culture and walk of life have an interest in what humanity 
is today and what it’s been in the past.
And that’s why I’ve written Anthropology For Dummies — to share what 
remarkable things anthropologists have discovered and continue to discover 
with folks like you who are fascinated with the human species (or at least fas-
cinated with passing your Intro to Anthropology class). Join me for a grand 
tour of the human species, across the world and through millions of years. If 
that doesn’t get your blood going, I can’t help you!

Anthropology For Dummies 
About This Book
The study of humanity today (and for the past few million years) has created 
a vast storehouse of anthropological knowledge printed in millions of pages 
of research reports and thousands of books. Even professional anthropolo-
gists simply can’t keep up with the speed and volume of published research. 
I can’t possibly recount what all this research has revealed, but I can — and 
in this book I do — boil down 150 years of anthropological discoveries into a 
nuts-and-bolts reference describing the essentials of human evolution, both 
cultural and biological. I also describe just how anthropologists work so you 
can understand the pros and cons of different methods.
If you’re taking an introductory course in Anthropology, this book can help 
clarify some ideas that can be pretty confusing and aren’t often clearly 
explained, even in textbooks. If you’re reading this book out of sheer curios-
ity, let me assure you that I’ve trimmed away a lot of technical material that 
may otherwise get in the way of your understanding the essential lessons 
of anthropology. Lots of popular-science books cover some aspects of 
anthropology, but few if any really cover anthropology as a whole in a clear, 
no-nonsense way. I’ve worked hard to provide just such a handbook in 
Anthropology For Dummies.
Each chapter is divided into concise sections, and each section breaks down 
the essentials of anthropology, including
 
 Terms and definitions
 
 The lowdown about competing theories
 
 How anthropology understood certain topics in the past and how it 
understands them today
I’ve written this book so that you can start anywhere; if you’re most inter-
ested in human language, you can jump to that chapter and understand 
it without knowing about human evolution. But because every aspect of 
humanity is tied to some other aspect, I’d be surprised if you don’t eventually 
end up reading it all!
Conventions Used in This Book
I use the following conventions throughout the text to make things consistent 
and easy to understand:

3
 Introduction
 
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.
 
 New terms appear in italic and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition.
 
 Bold text highlights key words or concepts in some bulleted lists and 
the action parts of numbered steps.
It’s tough to write a book about humanity without using the collective term 
“we,” so when I use it, keep in mind that I’m talking about humanity at large 
and not anthropologists (unless otherwise noted).
I often refer to the past because humanity is an old species, and we can learn 
a lot from our past. When I do this, I often use the convention BP for “before 
present” (which basically means years ago). When talking about the history 
of Western civilization, I use the conventional terms BC for “Before Christ” 
and AD for “Anno Domini” (which marks the year of Christ’s birth); some 
instead use BCE (“Before the Common Era”) and CE (“Common Era”) to avoid 
valuing the timescale of Western civilization, but these terms still just point 
exactly to BC and AD. Because so much information about the past uses BC 
and AD, I stick with this convention. Don’t worry, I’m not pushing a religion 
or valuing one timescale over another; I’m just using a common way to indi-
cate the passage of time.
Some physical anthropologists now use the term hominin to refer to any 
human or human ancestor; however, this change hasn’t been complete, and 
many news reports still use the term hominid. Until all anthropology makes 
this switch, I’m sticking with hominid to mean any large, bipedal (walking 
on two legs) primate, which basically means modern humans, some ancient 
human ancestors, and some of their closest biological relatives.
Anthropologists often use the terms society and culture interchangeably. I do 
this as well. It’s an old convention that’s not technically accurate, but unless 
you’re studying for your PhD, the difference isn’t that important. (Don’t 
worry; I define both society and culture in the book so you’re aware of the 
difference.)
Finally, when I refer to the scientific names of various life forms, I capital-
ize the genus but don’t capitalize the species, or subspecies. For example, 
modern humans are all Homo sapiens sapiens. I don’t always use subspecies 
names (like the second sapiens), and sometimes, for convenience, I just indi-
cate the genus with a capital letter while writing out the species name, as in 
H. sapiens. Don’t worry, this kind of terminology isn’t a large or important 
point of this book, and these designations will all be very clear when you find 
them in the chapters.

Anthropology For Dummies 
What You’re Not to Read
I’ve written this book so that you can both find information easily and easily 
understand what you find. And though it’d be great if you read every word, 
I’ve set off some text off from the main information, text you can live without 
if you’re just after the reference material. Don’t get me wrong — this stuff is 
interesting material. But if you’re just after the nuts and bolts, you can come 
back to these items later:
 
 Text in sidebars: Sidebars are shaded boxes that usually give detailed 
examples or flesh out historical perspectives on the topic at hand.
 
 Anything with a Technical Stuff icon: This icon indicates information 
that’s interesting but that you can live without. Read these tidbits later 
if you’re pressed for time.
 
 The stuff on the copyright page: No kidding. You’ll find nothing here 
of interest unless you’re inexplicably enamored by legal language and 
Library of Congress numbers.
Foolish Assumptions
I don’t think I’m going too far out on a flimsy limb to make these assumptions 
about you as a reader:
 
 You’re someone — just about anyone who can read, really — interested 
in the human species. Bring that interest to the reading and you’ll be 
rewarded.
 
 You’re taking an Introduction to Anthropology course and your text-
book just isn’t making things clear; all you want is a friendly, digestible 
resource that gives you the info you need in plain English.
 
 You either believe that evolution happens or that it’s a sound biologi-
cal theory. Evolution is the basis of modern biology, and nothing in the 
world of living things makes sense without it. Even if you have some 
doubts about evolution, I’m assuming that you can keep your mind open 
to the fact that humanity is very ancient; evolution is a foundation of the 
scientific study of our species.
 
 You’re anyone who wants a handy reference to settle a friendly argu-
ment about some aspect of humanity. When did the first civilizations 
arise? How many human languages exist? What did our earliest ances-
tors eat? You’ll find these answers and plenty more.

 Introduction
How This Book Is Organized
I’ve divided this book into five tidy parts. The following sections describe 
what each part covers.
Part I: What Is Anthropology?
Anthropology is the study of the human species, from DNA to language. It’s 
such a massive field that the first thing to do is sketch out just what anthro-
pology does and doesn’t study. You also discover some important facts 
about how anthropology developed as a scientific discipline.
Part II: Physical Anthropology 
and Archaeology
Physical (or biological) anthropology focuses on humanity as a biological phe-
nomenon — just another member of the 200+ primate species on Earth today. 
This part explores humanity’s oldest natural relatives — the primates — and 
the human species itself. Also in this part, I discuss evolution (the foundation 
of all modern biology), showing how it’s essential to understanding humanity 
biologically. I also introduce you to archaeology (the study of ancient cultures) 
and show you how it works and what it has learned about the prehistory of our 
species, from cave art to the great civilizations of the ancient world. Finally, I 
take you through some of humanity’s earliest action, from migration to farming 
to full-on civilization.
Part III: Cultural Anthropology 
and Linguistics
Cultural anthropology studies all facets of modern living cultures, from their 
religions to their ways of adapting to change, resolving conflict, and more. 
Linguistic anthropology is the study of language, humanity’s distinctive way of 
communication. This part covers what culture really is, why it differs world-
wide, and how different human language is from other animal communication 
(and why that’s a key characteristic of our species). It also discusses how 
hotbed issues like race, gender, religion, and politics relate anthropologically.

6
Anthropology For Dummies 
Part IV: So What? Anthropology, 
the Modern World, and You
In this part, I cover the main ways that the study of anthropology can cross 
over into daily, real-world life. I show you how cultural anthropology can help 
humans resolve political friction and conflict, how physical anthropology and 
archaeology are important to better understanding history, and how anthro-
pology can create more efficient responses to climate change and some other 
big issues facing our species today.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This part is all about you: It gives you some ideas about careers in anthro-
pology, recommends some anthropologically themed books and movies for 
your enjoyment, and boils down the ten most important lessons of this entire 
book.
Icons Used in This Book
To make this book easier to read and simpler to use, I include some icons 
that can help you find and fathom key ideas and information.
 
Any time you see this icon, you know the information that follows is so impor-
tant that it’s worth reading more than once.
 
This icon presents historical, case-specific, or otherwise interesting informa-
tion that you can read for further understanding; however, the info isn’t neces-
sary for grasping the concept.
 
This icon warns about potential traps that can derail you in your quest to 
understand anthropology.

 Introduction
Where to Go from Here
I’ve organized this book so that you can go wherever you want to find 
complete information. Want to know about the evolution of civilization, 
for example? Check out Chapter 10. If you’re interested in Neanderthals and 
why they went extinct, you want Chapter 7. If the complexities of language or 
religion flip your switch, head for Chapter 13 or 16. You get the idea. You can 
use the table of contents to find broad categories of information or the index 
to look up more specific topics.
If you’re not sure where you want to go, you may want to start with Part I. 
It gets you started with what anthropology studies, and how, and you can 
follow your interests from there.

In this part . . .
W
hat’s anthropology, and why should people 
study it? This part answers these questions and 
sketches out the history of anthropology, the study of 
humanity at large. It also introduces you to the four sub-
fields of anthropology.

Chapter 1
Human Beings and Being Human: 
An Overview of Anthropology
In This Chapter
 Discovering what anthropology is and how it studies the human species
 Exploring the Indiana Jones stuff: Physical anthropology and archaeology
 Checking out how cultures and languages fit into anthropology
 Finding out how modern anthropology analyzes human issues today
W
hy isn’t everyone the same? Why do people worldwide have differ-
ences in skin and hair color and ways of greeting one another? Why 
doesn’t everyone speak the same language?
Questions like these have fascinated humanity for as long as we have writ-
ten records — and I’m sure people thousands and even tens of thousands of 
years before writing was invented asked the same things (in whatever lan-
guage they used.) Why don’t those people do things the way I do? What’s wrong 
with them, anyway? Of course, people from that other group just on the next 
hilltop were scratching their heads and asking exactly the same questions.
Enter anthropology, the study of humanity. In this book I tell you what you 
need to know about anthropology, what anthropologists have discovered 
about humanity, and what anthropologists mean when they say that there 
are many ways of being human. I also tell you how anthropology works, 
and what anthropologists have learned about humanity, both modern and 
ancient.
And knowing all this is important if, as a species, we want to understand our-
selves. Biologically, humanity needs to know itself if it’s going to make good 
decisions about everything from medicine to genetically engineering food 
crops; that knowledge comes from anthropology. And culturally, knowledge 
of our past can help us understand what we are today, for better and worse; 
that knowledge, today, also comes from the field of anthropology. In Part I of 

12
Part I: What is Anthropology? 
this book — specifically in Chapters 2 and 3 — you find out how anthropol-
ogy studies humanity from these biological and cultural perspectives. Finally, 
Part IV of this book also shows how anthropology can help humanity deal 
with some real, real-world problems.
Digging Into Anthropology’s History
For a long time the answers to profound questions about humanity came 
largely from religious texts. For example, when European explorers realized 
that the New World wasn’t India, the Native Americans — millions of people 
nobody was expecting to find — were explained from a biblical perspective 
as remnants of the lost tribes of Israel.
But since the late 19th century AD another perspective has emerged, the 
scientific study of humanity called anthropology. At first anthropology was 
a quaint and pretty simple affair, studied as a sort of hobby by all kinds of 
Naturalists and pseudoscientists. But when people started to realize how 
much anthropology could teach humanity about itself, they began to take it 
more seriously. Anthropology became a science, the science of humanity at 
large.
In Chapter 2, you can get a grip on anthropology’s history and how it 
changed over time from being a pseudoscience to today’s highly technical 
study of human DNA and ancient fossils. In Chapter 3, you can find more 
detail about how anthropology has developed over time, affecting how it 
goes about learning about humanity in the first place.
 
The questions that anthropologists have asked (and ask today) are in part a 
reflection of the times; for example, today a lot of people are investigating the 
effects of climate change on ancient human populations. Knowing the poten-
tial for bias, anthropologists are careful about making assumptions.
Getting Acquainted with 
Anthropology’s Subfields
Anthropology has a complex, colorful, and sometimes checkered history. As 
you find out in Chapter 2, the field has gone through several transformations, 
and today there are more ways of doing anthropology than you can shake a 
stick at.

13
 Chapter 1: Human Beings and Being Human: An Overview of Anthropology
Now, the study of humanity is a vast undertaking, so anthropologists have 
divvied up the task into four main subfields:
 
 Physical anthropology
 
 Archaeology
 
 Cultural anthropology
 
 Linguistics
As you study anthropology, keep in mind that to really understand humanity, 
anthropologists need to know about each of the subfields. For example, an 
archaeologist studying an ancient civilization needs to know what a physical 
anthropologist has to say about that people’s bones, what the people ate, or 
how they practiced medicine. And today, cultural anthropologists can’t know 
much about a culture unless they have a good knowledge of that culture’s 
language system.
Physical anthropology
Physical differences between groups of humans are easily visible; mainland 
Europeans tend to be lighter-skinned with straight hair, and folks from Africa 
are typically darker-skinned with curlier hair. These are biological differ-
ences, and the goal of physical anthropology — the study of humanity as a 
biological species — is to understand how and why these variations on the 
human theme came about. Physical differences among living humans aren’t 
all that physical anthropology is concerned with, but understanding human 
variation (especially genetic differences) worldwide and through time is an 
important part of the field.
In Part II of this book, I boil down the main discoveries of physical anthropol-
ogy to date so that what’s left is the skeleton, the essentials. This material 
is what physical anthropologists know today and a little about what they’re 
studying and hoping to learn in the future. Chapter 4 introduces you to the 
primate order, your home in the animal kingdom. Chapters 6 and 7 take you to 
Africa, the cradle of humanity, to cover the fossil evidence of human evolution.
Like all anthropology, physical anthropology has its fingers in a lot of differ-
ent pies, from the study of fossils, to DNA analysis, documenting and explain-
ing differences in cold- or heat-tolerance among people worldwide, the study 
of disease, population genetics, and a dozen other topics. Chapter 19 intro-
duces you to the cutting edge study of physical anthropology, focusing on 
the magnificent molecule called DNA.

14
Part I: What is Anthropology? 
Archaeology
It’s hard to get to know someone without knowing a little about their past, 
and the same goes for humanity; a lot of what we do today — good and 
bad — is based on the acts and decisions of our ancestors. To understand 
humanity any further than skin deep requires looking into the past. This is 
the business of archaeologists.
But the past can be foggy (on a good day) because history — the written 
record — can only take us so far (and if you believe everything written in the 
ancient historical texts, well, I’ve got some oceanfront property in Utah you 
may be interested in). However well-meaning they may have been, historians 
have had their biases like everyone else. And, of course, the ancient histori-
ans didn’t write down everything, especially if they were unaware of, say, the 
entire New World (North and South America).
Archaeologists are the people who try to fill in the gaps of history by study-
ing the material remains of ancient cultures. It’s archaeologists who get 
excited over discovering an ancient piece of pottery, not necessarily for that 
piece of pottery alone (though it may be beautiful) but because of what it can 
tell humanity about its past.
 
Archaeologists don’t just focus on correcting or fleshing out the historical 
record; they also study the roughly 2.5 million years of humanity before writ-
ing was invented.
Chapter 5 tells you how archaeologists learn about the past, from carbon 
dating to meticulous excavation. Chapter 7 tells you about the spread of 
modern humans out of Africa and across the globe, and Chapter 8 gives some 
exciting examples of how humanity adapted to every environment imagin-
able, including the Arctic and the Pacific.
Cultural Anthropology
Humanity has more facets than just where we came from, our relations to the 
other primates, or how our ancient civilizations rose or fell. You also have to 
consider the whole original question of why people today differ worldwide. 
How come traditional Polynesian clothing is different from traditional cloth-
ing in the Sahara? Why do many Asian folks eat with chopsticks but others 
use a fork and knife? Why is it okay for a man to have several wives in one 
culture but not in another culture?

15
 Chapter 1: Human Beings and Being Human: An Overview of Anthropology
Unfortunately, the common sense answers are rarely right — chopsticks 
aren’t some archaic precursor to fork and knife, they’re just a different way 
of getting food into the mouth. Similarly, the ways in which people find mar-
riage partners in traditional Indian society (perhaps by arranged marriages) 
and traditional German society are just different. Cultural anthropologists 
study why these variations exist in the first place, and how they’re main-
tained as parts of cultural traditions, as elements of a given society’s collec-
tive identity.
Part III of this book covers cultural anthropology, the study of living human 
cultures. Overall, these chapters give you the nuts and bolts of what cultural 
anthropologists have learned about living human cultures. Chapter 11 tells 
you just what culture for anthropologists really means (no, it’s not the opera 
or stuffy wine-and-cheese parties) and how critical it is for human survival.
In Chapter 12 you see that all human cultures are basically ethnocentric, 
meaning that they typically believe that their own way of doing things — 
from how they eat to how they dress — is proper, right, and superior to any 
other way of doing things. This feeling of superiority can lead (and has led) 
to everything from poor intercultural relations to ethnic cleansing. Cultural 
anthropologists, and the knowledge and understanding they generate while 
studying the many different ways of being human, can help smooth out inter-
cultural communications; how they do this is also covered in Chapter 12. It 
can help humans understand other perspectives.
Part III also explains why race and ethnicity can be such volatile issues 
(Chapter 14), how humanity organizes identity (from family groupings to 
gender categories) and keeps track of who’s related to whom (Chapter 15), 
and the basic characteristics of humanity’s various religious traditions and 
political systems (Chapter 16).
Linguistics
Depending on whom you ask, humanity as a whole speaks something like 
6,000 human languages. Chapter 13 explains what language is as well as 
how linguistic anthropologists investigate how language evolved in the first 
place — one of the most fascinating questions in all of anthropology. In laying 
out a clear definition of language, linguistic anthropologists have had to 
compare human communication with the communication systems of other 
living things. All of what they’ve learned — from the fascinating study of how 
humans acquire language to the layers of meaning that seem to only be pres-
ent in human communication — give humanity a better understanding of just 
how unique and precious language is.

16
Part I: What is Anthropology? 
That uniqueness is in jeopardy, though, because languages become extinct 
every year as more people take up just speaking just one of the handful of 
main languages spoken worldwide today.
Making Sense of Anthropology’s Methods
Anthropology’s methods also range from lab analysis of DNA to taking notes 
on Sicilian (or any culture’s) body language. Each of these methods helps 
better understand the many ways of being human. The following list gives 
you an overview of some of these methods:
 
 Evolution is the foundation of modern biology, and physical 
anthropologists — who study humanity from a biological perspective — 
rely on it. Check out Chapter 3 for the lowdown on exactly what evolu-
tion is and isn’t and how it helps anthropologists study humanity.
 
 Archaeology isn’t just Indiana Jones dodging bad guys and saving 
priceless treasures. Chapter 5 covers the methods of archaeologists, 
from keeping track of where objects are found to dating them by the 
carbon-14 method.
 
 Do cultural anthropologists really get grants to go to other countries 
and observe human behavior? Yes, but there’s a lot more to it than that! 
Chapter 12 covers the methods of cultural anthropology, from observa-
tion to immersion in a subject culture.
 
 The complexity of human language is one of the main characteristics 
distinguishing us from non-human animals. Chapter 13 shows you how 
anthropologists think about and study language.
Applied Anthropology: Using 
the Science in Everyday Life
Part IV of this book introduces the many ways that the lessons of anthro-
pology are relevant in daily life. Anthropology isn’t just studied by scruffy 
professors clothed in tweeds (although I have to admit that yes, I do have 
a tweed jacket, and yes, I’ve worn it to an anthropological conference . . . 
once). Anthropologists are employed by many companies and government 
agencies, bringing what they know of humanity to the tables of commerce, 
international diplomacy, and other fields as applied anthropologists.

17
 Chapter 1: Human Beings and Being Human: An Overview of Anthropology
Applied anthropologists help humanity get along in a very literal sense. 
Chapter 17 shows how the lessons of anthropology are important to under-
standing and preventing cultural conflict.
Anthropology also helps humanity survive. Humanity faces enormous chal-
lenges, from overpopulation to language extinction and climate change 
(covered in Chapter 18) and common-sense solutions to these problems just 
aren’t working. But with a subtler understanding of why humanity is the way 
it is, applied anthropologists are better suited to implementing changes, par-
ticularly on the community level, than many government officials who may 
know a lot about high-level politics but little about cultural traditions and 
values in the smaller communities they govern.
Chapter 19 takes you into the lab, where anthropologists are analyzing DNA 
with methods that can help you find out where your genetic roots lie. This 
chapter shows you that they ultimately lie in the great continent of Africa.
Finally, Chapter 20 has some exciting examples of how archaeological discov-
eries help us flesh out the history books. The common people of the ancient 
world — and unless you’re royalty, that means your ancestors — didn’t write 
much, but archaeology has given them a voice. Here you can find out about 
the lives of common laborers of ancient Egypt, American slaves, and the van-
ished Greenlandic Norse.

Looking Into Humanity’s Mirror: 
Anthropology’s History
In This Chapter
 Figuring out exactly what anthropology studies
 Discovering how anthropology defines humanity and culture
 Reviewing the historical roots that led to modern anthropology
I
n 1949, anthropologist Clyde Kluckhohn published “Mirror for Man,” an 
introduction to the study of anthropology, the study of humanity (anthro 
meaning “of humanity” and logy meaning “the study of”). Since then, attitudes 
have changed a little (most people now speak of “humanity” rather than “man-
kind”), but Kluckhohn’s words still ring true: “Anthropology holds up a great 
mirror to man and lets him look at himself in his infinite variety.”
Anthropology is the mirror of our species; a place for humanity to reflect on 
itself. But you have to do that looking, and the discovering that comes from it, 
with care. If you want to understand anything, you need to see everything, warts 
and all. As a species we’ve found time and again that our cultural biases — our 
ethnocentric way of thinking that our culture is superior to all others — are 
simply wrong; humanity has found many ways to be human. Anthropology 
studies those many paths.
What does humanity see in the great mirror of anthropology? Before answer-
ing this question, you need to understand where anthropology came from. 
It didn’t just pop up out of nowhere, and it wasn’t invented overnight: it was 
cobbled together, refined, reinvented, crafted, and then reimagined and 
reinterpreted such that today anthropology is a very diverse field holding up 
many mirrors for humanity.
Rather than give you a comprehensive history of the discipline of anthropology — 
which would take a separate book — in this chapter I introduce the main ideas 
that paved the way to modern anthropology. As with any idea, you see that 
some were products of their times and have since fallen by the wayside, and 
others were eternal from the start and continue to fascinate anthropologists.

Par t I: What is Anthropology? 
Getting to the Heart of Anthropology
An exciting passage of Homer’s Odyssey finds Odysseus and crew spying dis-
tant figures on an island they’re about to land on and wondering about the 
people they’ll encounter. Do those strange folk plant crops in an orderly fash-
ion or do they forage for their food? Do they revere the gods and have laws 
and lawful assemblies? Or are these some other kind of people — savages, 
maybe? Savages, of course, would be people who didn’t do things the Greek 
way . . .
Homer wrote nearly 3,000 years ago, but the questions Odysseus asked were 
already ancient. Look, over there: People different from us! What are they like?
Anthropology is rooted in the question of what Other (with a capital O) people 
are like. But up from the roots has grown a whole plant, an anthropology that not 
only looks at Others but also looks at itself and all of humanity. Anthropologists 
today continue to learn about the human species by studying people outside 
Western civilization, but they also scrutinize humanity as a biological spe-
cies, investigate how the modern world came to be by examining the past, 
and obsess over details of uniquely human characteristics such as language. 
Anthropologists have even taken up the study of anthropology itself, some 
saying, in effect, that the mirror is cracked and that to understand humanity 
better, they must understand the history of anthropology itself.
By examining the history of their own discipline, anthropologists have gone 
from silvering the mirror — applying the reflective coating to the glass — to 
gluing it back together and, today, trying to keep it clean. Because culture 
changes so quickly, the questions that each generation of anthropologists 
asks tend to change, so maintaining this mirror for humanity isn’t easy. In 
fact, some would say that each generation has its own mirror, and that ques-
tions should change as culture changes.
On the surface, I’d agree: As times change and we learn new things, we need 
to ask new questions. But at the same time, I’m confident that the following 
topics will always be central to humanity’s investigation of itself — to the 
field of anthropology:
 
 What are the commonalities among humans worldwide? That is, what 
does every human culture do?
 
 What are the variations among humans worldwide? That is, what 
things do only some cultures do?
 
 Why do these commonalities and variations exist in the first place? In 
other words, why aren’t all human cultures the same?

21
 Chapter 2: Looking Into Humanity’s Mirror: Anthropology’s History
 
 How does humanity change through time? Is it still evolving, and if 
so, how?
 
 Where has humanity been, and what can that show us about where 
humanity is going? That is, what can we learn about ourselves today, 
from our past?
To answer these and other questions, one foundation of anthropology is the 
comparative approach, in which cultures aren’t compared to one another in 
terms of which is better than the other but rather in an attempt to understand 
how and why they differ as well as share commonalities. This method is also 
known as cultural relativism, an approach that rejects making moral judgments 
about different kinds of humanity and simply examines each relative to its own 
unique origins and history.
Because humanity qualifies as one of many biological species in the animal 
kingdom, another foundation of anthropology is evolution, the change of species 
through time. As I discuss throughout this book, both human biology and culture 
have evolved over millions of years, and they continue to evolve. What’s more, 
human biology can affect human culture, and vice versa. For example, over time, 
human brains became larger (biological change) leading to increased intelligence, 
language, and eventually writing (a cultural change in the way humans communi-
cate). Anthropologists call human evolution biocultural evolution to illustrate this 
dual nature of human change.
Dazed and Confused: What It 
Is to Be Human
The problem with being human is that it leads to questions. Eighteenth-
century German philosopher Immanuel Kant wrote that three fundamental 
questions were “What can I know? What ought I to do? What may I hope?” 
Just like Rene Descartes’ momentous phrase “I think, therefore I am,” each of 
Kant’s little nuggets can lead to a lifetime of introspection. If anthropology is 
a mirror for humankind, the individual human mind is itself a hall of mirrors. 
It’s a wonder we can make any sense of anything!
To start, you need some definitions. These terms come up again throughout 
this book, but it’s important to get a handle on them sooner rather than later.
Humanity refers to the human species, a group of life forms with the following 
characteristics:
 
 Bipedalism (walking on two legs)
 
 Relatively small teeth for primates of our size
 
 Relatively large brains for primates of our size

22
Par t I: What is Anthropology? 
 
 Using modern language to communicate ideas
 
 Using complex sets of ideas — called culture (discussed later) — to survive
Standing on two legs and having particularly small teeth and large brains are 
all anatomical characteristics, and they’re studied by anthropologists focus-
ing on human biological evolution. Surviving by using a wide array of cultural 
information (including instructions for making a fur cloak in the Arctic or a 
pottery canteen in the desert Southwest) is the use of culture (defined in the 
next section). It’s studied by other anthropologists, and even more study the 
evolution of language.
 
Humanity is a general term that doesn’t specify whether you’re talking about 
males, females, adults, or children; it simply means our species — Homo sapi-
ens sapiens — at large. The term humanity can be applied to modern humans 
(Homo sapiens sapiens) as well as some of our most recent ancestors, placed 
more generally in Homo sapiens, without the subspecies (the second sapiens) 
suffix. Exactly when Homo sapiens evolved into Homo sapiens sapiens is a 
complex question based on when humans became anatomically modern and 
when they became behaviorally modern. I introduce these questions a little 
later in this chapter and investigate them in detail in Chapter 7.
Two types of culture
The next most important definition is that of culture, which is the whole set of 
information a human mind uses to describe what the world is like and what’s 
appropriate behavior for living in that world. Cultural differences are basically 
different conceptions of what is appropriate in a given situation. For example, 
women in traditional Tibetan culture often have more than one husband, whereas 
men in traditional Tajikistan (a country in central Asia) often have multiple wives. 
Each culture, then, has specific ideas about what’s appropriate marriage-wise, but 
the difference between what each considers appropriate is pretty major.
When anthropologists speak of different cultures, on the other hand, they 
mean different groups of people each possessing a unique set of ideas for 
what’s appropriate — in this case, the Tibetans and the Tajiks.
 
Anthropologists often use the words society and culture interchangeably, as 
I do in this book. Strictly speaking, a society can contain several cultures, so 
it’s a larger unit than a single culture (for example, American society today 
encompasses Irish, Hispanic, and Japanese American cultures, to name only 
three). Culture, then, includes ideas about identity (for example, what the 
word brother means), nature (what wild means as opposed to tame), social 
relationships (how to greet the queen of England as opposed to how to greet 
your darts partner) and so on, as well as artifacts.

23
 Chapter 2: Looking Into Humanity’s Mirror: Anthropology’s History
Some anthropologists extend culture to the objects (called artifacts) that 
humanity makes or uses to aid in survival. In this case, culture is both the 
information stored in the brain (shared among a group) and the objects that 
group uses to survive. For example, artifacts (also called material culture) 
include the distinctive Inuit harpoon carved from bone and used to hunt 
seals. Not all artifacts have such obvious survival value, though. The spe-
cially made drum a shaman uses in a healing ritual isn’t directly related to 
staying alive—gathering calories—but as far as the shaman is concerned, 
that specific drum is very important. It has to be made the right way and 
carry the right tone; otherwise, the healing would be jeopardized. In this way, 
the drum is just as important to survival as the harpoon.
 
The idea of extending culture to encompass artifacts sees all of culture as the 
extrasomatic means of adaptation. That is, whereas other life forms survive via 
bodily (somatic) adaptations, humanity relies not so much on its anatomy as 
its culture, its extrasomatic means of adaptation and survival.
Two types of modernity
The term humanity can be a little tricky because anthropologists use it to 
refer to our species, Homo sapiens sapiens, as well as some of our most 
recent ancestors in the more general species Homo sapiens (lacking the very 
specific subspecies sapiens.) When the human species should be referred to 
as Homo sapiens versus Homo sapiens sapiens depends on whether you’re 
talking about being anatomically or behaviorally modern.
Anatomical modernity is being anatomically indistinguishable from modern, 
living populations. This term really comes into play only when anthropolo-
gists are looking at the bones of ancient human-like creatures and asking 
whether these creatures are human; strictly speaking, if anthropologists can’t 
distinguish the bones they’re looking at from those of modern populations, 
the bones are anatomically modern.
Behavioral modernity is behaving in a way that’s indistinguishable from modern, 
living populations. This label also really comes into play only when anthro-
pologists are looking at the complexity of behavior in the past — for example, 
at the objects made by ancient proto-humans. Asking whether the creatures 
that made these objects were behaviorally human is a tough question that I 
re-examine in Chapter 7, but for the moment it’s enough to know behaviorally 
modern people employ symbolism, the use of one object to stand for another. 
Blood, for example, is a common substance, but humanity can also use it — 
or its properties, such as the color red — symbolically to activate emotions, 
memories, and actions in other people. This uniquely human capacity for the 
complex use of symbols is a big part of behavioral modernity.

Par t I: What is Anthropology? 
-Isms and the Making of Anthropology
Like most scholarly disciplines, anthropology wasn’t just tidily invented over-
night; I think of it as a Frankenstein’s monster of ideas and questions culled 
from other disciplines, cobbled and stitched together into a more-or-less 
functional whole. (You can read more about the various subdisciplines of 
anthropology in Chapter 3.)
But even before anthropology existed as a discrete academic field, its founda-
tions were being laid by people doing other things that would later be called 
anthropology (or act as guidelines for building anthropology). Herodotus, a 
6th-century Greek scholar, described the peoples and antiquities of Egypt, 
and Julius Caesar described the people he encountered in France (the Gauls) 
and southern England (the Britons) in the 50s BC; people have been inter-
ested in other people for a long time. But these reports were often curios 
or written as political statements, and they were largely descriptive; they 
showed what was (more or less) but didn’t go into too much detail about 
why. They offered few systematic explanations.
It wasn’t until the 19th and 20th centuries AD that people systematically went 
out from the centers of Western civilization (in Europe and North America) 
with the specific goal of studying Other people. Even then, figuring out how 
to apply what they learned about others to what they already knew about 
humanity at large took some time. When this did begin to happen, though, 
the seed of anthropology was watered, and a new discipline began to grow.
Harsh words for early anthropology
Although Europeans began to substantially col-
onize the New World and other “discoveries” in 
the 17th century, the colonialist endeavor wasn’t 
fully realized and backed up by industrialization 
until the 19th century. Early ethnographies — 
documents describing non-European cultures 
authored by people who lived for some time on 
those cultures — were often little more than 
intelligence reports for use in exploitation.
In 1966, Claude Levi-Strauss, a leading anthropol-
ogist of his time, wrote that cultural anthropology 
and ethnography were rooted in a historical con-
text in which “. . . the larger part of mankind [was 
made] subservient to the other, and during which 
millions of innocent human beings have had 
their resources plundered and their institutions 
and beliefs destroyed, whilst they themselves 
were ruthlessly killed, thrown into bondage, and 
contaminated by diseases they were unable to 
resist.”

25
 Chapter 2: Looking Into Humanity’s Mirror: Anthropology’s History
Colonialism
Early anthropology is rooted in the efforts of Western civilization to better 
understand the lands it was colonizing. This isn’t revisionist history or 
Western-civilization bashing — it’s just plain fact.
For example, in 1902 the Report of the Philippine Commission stated that 
“Since the first arrival of the Portuguese in Eastern waters, the mind of the 
Malay has appeared to the European as a closed book. Both races have ever 
misunderstood and mistrusted each other. Out of mutual ignorance and 
fear have followed hatred, oppression, and retaliation . . . this government is 
attempting to rear a new standard of relationship between the white man and 
the Malay. The success . . . will depend . . . on our correct understanding and 
scientific grasp of the peoples whose problems we are facing.”
The problems the report refers to were Western problems revolving around 
how to make better workers of the Malaysians, and the solution was a scien-
tific understanding of these folk to be achieved through the new science of 
anthropology. Specifically, this new science would use one of its principal 
tools, ethnography, to help the colonial effort. Ethnography is the direct 
observation of a group of people by living near or among them, and making 
records of what one observes.
This kind of study is hardly surprising today, but keep in mind that for a 
long time knowledge of what went on in non-Western cultures wasn’t based 
on direct experience but on superficial reports from outsiders, reports that 
often judged — with Western civilization’s basic biblical morality — what had 
been observed. Actually putting observers into the cultures they were to be 
investigating was a new move.
Colonialist ethnographies had some distinctive characteristics:
 
 Racism: Particularly, the idea that non-Western people were inferior to 
Westerners and therefore had to be educated to the best of the colonial 
powers’ ability (but would always remain inferior to Westerners).
 
 Social Darwinism: Particularly, the idea that non-Western people either 
were destined to be Westernized (in which case they should be helped 
to achieve Westernization — for example, by having their customs 
banned and replaced with Western customs) or were doomed to extinction 
(in which case not much could be done for them but to document them 
like living museum exhibits before they became extinct).
 
 Ethnocentrism: The idea that Western civilization was at the pinnacle of 
human evolution, and that all other ways of life were inferior; note that 
this view isn’t exclusive to Western civilization — many cultures 
worldwide believe it as well.

26
Par t I: What is Anthropology? 
Although early anthropology was colored by its involvement with colonialism, 
by the 1950s many anthropologists recognized that ethnographies being 
produced under the colonialist paradigm weren’t as objective as they could 
be; in 1969, the American Anthropological Association formed a Committee 
on Ethics. By the mid-1970s, guidelines for ethical ethnography were being 
published, and today graduate students undergo rigorous ethical and human-
relations training before doing fieldwork.
 
Federally funded anthropological research by U.S. researchers normally 
requires a review and approval by the government’s Institutional Review 
Board to ensure that “human subjects research” doesn’t harm the very people 
it’s researching.
Although anthropologists still must consider plenty of ethical issues when 
doing research among other human beings, I’m confident that most ethno-
graphic anthropologists today don’t work for colonialist efforts or efforts 
counter to the interest of the people they study; in fact, my impression is that 
most ethnographers today do the opposite: work in the interest of the folks they 
study. At the same time, most of them — in one way or another — are working 
to answer some of the basic questions I outline in the section “Getting to the 
Heart of Anthropology” earlier in the chapter.
Antiquarianism
You can find the roots of archaeology (a branch of anthropology that stud-
ies the ancient past) in a distinctly nonscientific interest in the past. Many 
motivations initially drove this antiquarian (prescientific) interest: Ancient 
Sumerian royalty commissioned excavations that could show their con-
nections to mythical culture heroes, 16th-century French traders could sell 
curios (unusual articles) to royal families across Europe, and 19th-century 
eligible English bachelors could clutter their parlors with artifacts meant to 
demonstrate their owners’ high education and interest in the esoteric. Only 
in the 1850s did appreciable numbers of investigators — who began to call 
themselves archaeologists — start to carefully document what they excavated.
Like colonialist ethnography, antiquarian archaeology had some distinctive 
characteristics:
 
 A focus on large, visible archaeology: In particular, large ruins — such 
as the walled city of Troy, the pyramids of Egypt, or the Parthenon — 
that were relatively easy to find and analyze. (This propensity for size 
also led to a focus on the royal families of the ancient world because 
they were associated with these large monuments, whereas common 
people were buried elsewhere and essentially ignored by archaeologists 
until the 1960s.)

27
 Chapter 2: Looking Into Humanity’s Mirror: Anthropology’s History
 
 A focus on the Western world: Early archaeologists largely believed 
that the West was at the pinnacle of evolution, and all other societies 
were either going to become Western or become extinct.
 
 A focus on monetary value: Many sought antiquities not for their value 
as knowledge but as items that could be sold.
 
 A concept of shallow time: Until the 1860s, many believed that the Earth 
was only a few thousand years old and that most explanations of the 
ancient world were in the Christian Bible.
Although archaeology began without distinctively scientific goals, by the early 
1900s people knew that the Earth was very ancient and that evolution had shaped 
humanity as early as millions of years ago, and archaeologists had begun to make 
very careful records of what they found. You can check out more about modern 
archaeological methods in Chapter 3. For the moment, you just need to know that 
although the study began in antiquarianism, it developed into a modern science 
that has revealed a great deal about the human past.
Scientism
By the 1930s, anthropology was underway as a distinctive academic field 
worldwide, with anthropologists trying — in different ways — to examine 
some of the basic questions outlined in the section “Getting to the Heart of 
Anthropology” earlier in this chapter. Bodies of theory even developed, each 
a different lens through which to interpret the cultures worldwide (which 
were being documented by ethnographers). Essentially, people applied a sci-
entific approach to the study of humanity.
This development could go too far, as when people improperly applied bio-
logical concepts to cultural change (resulting in the idea of social Darwinism, 
a mistaken idea I examine in Part III of this book), but essentially it was a step 
in the direction of objectivity, of trying to filter out ones’ own cultural pre-
conceptions when thinking about or documenting other cultures. It was an 
attempt, then, to combat ethnocentrism.
 
Although some today subscribe to the postmodern philosophy, which essen-
tially states that all knowledge is socially constructed and that you can never 
get out of the box (you’re hopelessly imprisoned in an ethnocentric shell) — I 
don’t buy it. I believe human beings can be somewhat objective and make 
accurate statements about what they observe. Although each person wears 
his own culture’s lenses, everyone can learn that some things apply to all cul-
tures regardless of which lenses they’re most accustomed to.

28
Par t I: What is Anthropology? 
 
Don’t get bogged down by the hierarchy of scientific terminology regarding 
observations. An observation is something that you’ve seen or otherwise care-
fully documented; a hypothesis is a statement that suggests the relationship 
between two variables (for example, the liquid state of the variable water will 
change to the solid state when the variable temperature is sufficiently decreased). 
A theory is a more fully developed, complex form of hypothesis, and a fact is 
a statement — normally based on multiple confirmed hypotheses — that can 
account for many well-documented observations.
The attempt to add some scientific objectivity to anthropology led to the 
recognition and adoption of two very important perspectives:
 
 The emic perspective is that of a person within a culture — it’s the insider’s 
view. For example, it’s a New Guinea highlander’s concept of what con-
stitutes murder, even though a Western scientist may have a different 
perception of that word.
Ole Wurm and the circus strongman
The roots of modern scientific archaeology are 
in Europe, where, from the 1650s to the 1850s, all 
manner of men sought to find and bring home 
antiquities and curios of the ancient world. This 
checkered crew included genuine naturalists, 
such as Danish prehistorian Ole Wurm, legions 
of vaguely interested wealthy British bachelors, 
and Giovanni Belzoni, the Italian-born charlatan, 
circus strongman, and explorer of the Egyptian 
pyramids.
Wurm (1588–1654) was a Danish professor 
of medicine with an interest in, well, every-
thing. Paying students to collect objects and 
curios any time they traveled abroad, Wurm 
assembled an impressive collection of arti-
facts, skeletons, fossils, rocks, ancient statu-
ary, artifacts, and other bric-a-brac. Working 
under the impression that the world was just 
a few thousand years old, Wurm organized the 
objects in his museum — not according to age, 
but by how much they resembled one another. 
This was a start at systematically organizing the 
many new objects being discovered by explor-
ers, but it was different from today’s archaeol-
ogy because it lacked an understanding of the 
actual age of the Earth and humanity.
By the time he was 25, Belzoni (1778–1823) 
had fled from a monastic school in Rome and 
started a 12-year career as a strongman in an 
English circus. Traveling to Egypt in 1815, he 
quickly began an extraordinary new career 
as an “Antiquarian.” Within a few years he 
had sent many ancient Egyptian relics back 
to London’s British Museum, including multi-
ton stone statues. In 1818 he used what some 
called his engineering genius to locate a pas-
sage into the Great Pyramid at Gizeh; although 
he found that it had already been looted, his 
exploits were enough to excite the public with 
tales of treasure-hunting and relics from past 
ages. Though he wasn’t a professional scholar, 
Belzoni is credited with encouraging the public 
to take an interest in the ancient world.

29
 Chapter 2: Looking Into Humanity’s Mirror: Anthropology’s History
 
 The etic perspective is that of a person from outside a culture — it’s the 
outsider’s view. For example, it’s a scientist’s definition of murder that 
he or she wants to use in comparing many different societies’ punishments 
for having killed another person.
Although remaining emic or etic in your fieldwork or observations isn’t 
always easy, know that anthropologists strive for both emic and etic knowl-
edge (as opposed to early anthropologists, who focused on etic knowledge). 
You can read more about emic and etic perspectives in Chapter 12.
Holism
Another idea that came into anthropology with science was the concept of 
holism, which is the recognition that all parts of a human culture are more or 
less interdependent. Turns out studying one single aspect of a culture wasn’t 
working for anthropologists. For example, kinship — how people reckon their 
relations with other members of society — intersects with economics, and 
economics intersect with religion and politics.
Anthropologists had to recognize that the many facets of the human experi-
ence were interrelated. This discovery didn’t make humans easier to study, 
but it was better than laboring under the impression that human societies 
would be easy to figure out. Anthropologists are still trying to figure out how 
to understand the interrelations of the many facets of human culture, but at 
least they’re no longer deluded by the idea that every cultural institution, for 
example, meshes perfectly with some other institution so that both would 
function easily. This idea (one of many functionalist conceptions) simply didn’t 
recognize that people are messy, and cultures are hard to draw lines around. 
Because of this nonuniformity, cultural anthropology can be hard to study.
 
Holism doesn’t mean that all parts of a society work in perfect harmony; all 
cultures appear to have some disunity or friction.

By the 1960s, anthropologists weren’t content to simply study humanity — 
they wanted to apply what they’d learned about humanity to pressing real-
world problems such as poverty. This approach, called applied anthropology, 
is an important facet of anthropology today, shaping some anthropologists’ 
research plans (and entire careers) as well as determining where the lessons 
the anthropologist has learned will be applied.

30
Par t I: What is Anthropology? 
Today, anthropology is a multidisciplinary study, one that draws on evidence 
from many studies in many different academic disciplines. Throughout this 
book I describe the discoveries of generations of anthropologists worldwide. 
Keep in mind that such discoveries draw on all sorts of lines of evidence to 
flesh out the human story. You can read about these other kinds of evidence, 
and the subfields of anthropology, in Chapter 3.

Anthropology Is Studied
In This Chapter
 Studying humanity as a biological species
 Unearthing humanity’s past
 Distinguishing humans from animals through language
 Investigating living societies
A
nthropology, the study of humanity by humans, isn’t easy. Like any life 
form, the human species has many fascinating facets — from its biology 
to its language and deep history — and Western civilization has only been 
studying these facets in a truly systematic way for about 150 years. And much 
has changed even in those 150 years, both worldwide and within anthropology, 
such that anthropologists have to study the history of their own discipline 
to understand how much of what’s already been done is still important and 
what’s essentially out of date.
Still, anthropologists press on, believing that with care, diligence, sensitivity, 
a few research dollars, and plenty of graduate students willing to work for 
next to nothing, humanity can indeed learn important lessons about itself.
In this chapter, I describe the main ways that anthropologists examine human-
ity. Each of the subfields — physical anthropology, archaeology, linguistics, and 
cultural anthropology — are normally the career of a single anthropologist, but a 
full understanding of our species demands that you combine information from all 
these fields (see Figure 3-1). Therefore, anthropologists often proudly tell you that 
they’re four-field anthropologists, focusing on one facet of humanity but tying their 
findings in with all others. In the same way, I’m going to break anthropology out 
into its four subfields, but remember, discoveries in these individual fields have 
effects on the others.

Physical Anthropology and the 
Evolutionary Basis of Biology
One of Charles Darwin’s great contributions to civilization was to demon-
strate that humanity was part of the world of living things, not separate from 
it. For thousands of years, Western civilization, backed up by the biblical 
story of creation, held humanity as a special creation fundamentally different 
from all other living things. By Darwin’s time, many were beginning to ques-
tion this assessment, but the cultural pressure to conform to the dominant 
religion prevented most from saying so out loud. But Darwin’s ideas and the 
many it fertilized set the foundation for a new study: the study of humans as 
living, evolving creatures in many ways no different from the rest of animal 
life. Today, anthropologists have countless reams of data, much of it based 
on studies of DNA — the molecule that shapes all Earth life — to back the 
claims Darwin made in 1859.
And so today they also have physical anthropology, the study of humanity as 
a biological phenomenon. What species are we most and least like? Where 
and when did we fist appear? What were our ancestors like? Can we learn about 
human behavior from the behavior of our nearest relatives, the chimpanzees 
and gorillas? Is our species still evolving? How do modern human genetics, popu-
lation growth, and other current issues play out from a biological perspective? 
These are all questions physical anthropologists ask.

33
 Chapter 3: Actually, Four Mirrors: How Anthropology Is Studied
You say you want an evolution
You can find the answers to these and many other questions about our species 
in the study of evolution, the change through time of the properties of a living 
species. That’s because evolution is the foundation of the life sciences. Many 
kinds of life forms have become extinct (like the dinosaurs), but each of 
today’s living species (including humanity) has an evolutionary ancestry that 
reaches far back in time. Today, people understand that these principles can 
reveal a lot about the world of living things.
 
Evolution is often called a theory by people outside the scientific community, 
but many biologists would prefer to see it advanced to fact status. In a technical 
sense, gravitation is also a theory, but physicists have such good evidence for 
it that they universally accept it as fact.
 
Evolution, like anthropology, is studied by scientists. The scientific method 
both subjects share is a relatively simple process of generating knowledge 
based on three main stages of investigation. First, the scientist makes observa-
tions about the relationships among variables (such as air temperature and 
its effect on water). She then forms a hypothesis, or a statement about what 
effects she believes those variables will have on one another. (For example, 
she may hypothesize that exposure to cold air will cause water to freeze.) To 
test her hypothesis, she performs experiments to see whether her predic-
tions are correct. If her hypothesis holds up under this extensive testing, she 
accepts the hypothesis as fact; if the experiments fail to produce the pre-
dicted results, she rejects the hypothesis. The key here is experimentation. 
What matters isn’t whether the scientist is a professor or an undergraduate 
but whether the data support the hypothesis. Every scientific claim is entirely 
open to questioning and scrutiny. Science recognizes no authorities; every 
statement is open to further investigation. In this way, science is the most 
democratic way of generating knowledge.
Replication, variation, and selection
 
Until the mid-1800s, many questions about the human species, the age of the 
Earth, and other basic inquiries were answered by looking to one document: 
the Christian Bible. People argued that it contained all the answers humans 
would ever need, so no further investigation was necessary. The age of the 
Earth? An Irish archbishop calculated it as about 6,000 years based on bibli-
cal statements. The origins of humanity? Clearly laid out in the first pages 
of Genesis: God created humanity. Whatever one thinks of the morality pre-
scribed by the Bible — and it offers plenty of good messages — it’s clear today 
that these so-called facts are simply incorrect, dating from an age in which 
little was empirically known about the age of the earth, the origins of human-
ity, or even that our own planet wasn’t at the center of the universe but only 
one of many.

34
Par t I: What is Anthropology? 
Evolution is a process, not a thing. In fact, it’s a single word used to describe 
the cumulative effects of three independent facts. Importantly, these attributes 
of evolution can be (and are) observed in nature every day. They are
 
 Replication: The fact that life forms have offspring
 
 Variation: The fact that each offspring is slightly different from its parents, 
and its siblings
 
 Selection: The fact that not all offspring survive, and those that do tend 
to be the ones best suited to their environment
Figure 3-2 shows these characteristics in more detail.
 
Regardless of your personal views on the topic of evolution, the three pro-
cesses of evolution aren’t arguable. Whether it’s in the form of zebra calves, 
salmon fry, or human infants, life forms replicate. Also, all offspring aren’t 
clones; variation occurs in small ways and significant ways, but it occurs. And 
if it weren’t for selection, the world would be swarming with every mosquito, 
beetle, and tadpole ever born; the fact that it isn’t verifies that not all of these 
creatures born survive into adulthood. Finally, it’s not arguable that the off-
spring best suited to their environment tend to pass their genes on to the next 
generation.

Selection

35
 Chapter 3: Actually, Four Mirrors: How Anthropology Is Studied
When replication happens, the variable offspring are born into an environ-
ment that basically either selects for or against them; if two dragonflies are 
pursued by predators (like birds), the one with a better build for its environ-
ment is most likely to survive. It’s been selected for rather than against, and 
it’s therefore more likely than its less-fit sibling to pass on the genes that 
made it. Now the genes that made a fit dragonfly go on to make the next gen-
eration of dragonflies, which are slightly fitter than the parent generation. 
Essentially, that’s evolution: selection acting on the variable offspring, lead-
ing to the change through time of the characteristics of the organism.
 
Groups of living things that can interbreed and have healthy offspring are 
called species. Groups of similar species diverge into further groups, forming 
a biological classification hierarchy that I discuss in Chapter 4. In this chapter, 
just remember that a genus is the level above species. Humanity is in the genus 
Homo and the species sapiens, yielding the scientific name Homo sapiens.
Speciation
Sometimes groups of living things move from one environment to another, as 
when air currents carry insects from one island to another or some subpopu-
lation of a species of squirrel somehow crosses a river and is cut off from its 
original population. When this happens, new selective environments may 
reshape the population so much that if it were to rejoin its ancestral popula-
tion, the two couldn’t interbreed. This event is called speciation, and it’s what 
most people think of when they think about evolution: one life form gradually 
changing into another.
Because speciation can take a long time (anywhere from thousands to mil-
lions of years), it’s hard to observe. Still, you can see it in the fossil record, 
where billions of years of Earth life have left traces of their change through 
time. And that record speaks clearly, even though it has gaps here and there 
(because geological forces have wiped out some fossils, for example, or 
animal and plant remains simply didn’t fossilize due to geochemical factors), 
telling anthropologists that yes, all living species have long evolutionary 
histories, including Homo sapiens and all its living and past relatives in the 
primate order. This is where physical anthropology comes in, to investigate 
that evolutionary past.
More facets of physical anthropology
The evolutionary principles underlying physical anthropology touch every-
thing that physical anthropologists study. In this section, I outline a few of 
the main fields of physical anthropology; you can read about yet more sub-
fields and discoveries in the other chapters in this part of the book.

36
Par t I: What is Anthropology? 
Primatology
One specialty of physical anthropologists is the study of living primates, 
a field called primatology. (Some biologists also study primates, but without 
expressly looking for what they can teach humanity about itself.) Primatological 
physical anthropology studies primate behavior, biology, evolution, and anatomy. 
Each of these fields ties into the other, such that what anthropologists learn about 
behavior informs — and is informed by — what they learn about biology and 
so on. For example, you can’t fully understand the anatomy of a species without 
knowing about its evolution because anatomical characteristics — like a prehen-
sile tail, or new kinds of teeth — don’t just pop up out of nowhere; they accumu-
late (or vanish) as selective pressures change and shape the organism.
Why being human can make evolution 
hard to understand
Although the world of biology widely accepts 
evolution, the topic can be hard to understand 
for several reasons. Leaving aside deliberate 
mischaracterization of evolution by those with 
a religious agenda, I’m talking about how being 
human itself obscures our view of evolution.
By this I mean that although humans evolve, 
we do so in some ways profoundly different 
from other species. For the last 100,000 years 
our outward, physical bodies haven’t evolved 
too terribly much; modern human skeletons 
are essentially indistinguishable from those 
of 100,000 years ago. And yet humanity has 
changed a great deal; most of us now live in 
massive cities, instead of as highly mobile for-
agers, and most of us eat foods grown on farms 
rather than collected from across vast land-
scapes. So what has changed, and how does it 
make evolution hard to understand?
What have changed are our minds and the cul-
tures we carry in them. Culture, really, is the 
mind’s set of instructions for what the universe 
is like and what you’re supposed to do about 
it. (You can read about culture in more detail 
in Chapter 11.) Doing is the crux: We humans 
evolve proactively, inventing artifacts and 
cultural practices to survive in new environ-
ments, not reactively like every other species; 
other species don’t even know they’re evolving 
through time. Consider the Arctic, which was 
widely colonized after about 1,500 years ago by 
folks who invented dog sleds, whale-hunting 
equipment, watercraft, and igloos.
This purposive invention leads us, I think, to see 
living things the way we see our artifacts: as fin-
ished products of some kind of intent. It’s hard 
to imagine that some mind didn’t make the elm 
tree for some purpose, because we ourselves 
invent and build things for specific purposes. 
But evolution provides a competing idea about 
how those things came to be, one that can be 
hard to reconcile with humanity’s purposeful 
tendencies.

37
 Chapter 3: Actually, Four Mirrors: How Anthropology Is Studied
Anthropologists study primate behavior by using the principles of ethology, the 
study of animal behavior. Although approaches vary, they often emphasize
 
 Observation of the animal in its natural environment for long periods — for 
example, across seasons and years rather than just a few weeks at a time
 
 Careful consideration of the interplay between behavior, environment, 
and anatomy, accounting for all that’s known about the species
 
 A search for and explanation of patterns of behavior
 
 A search for and explanation of variations from patterns of behavior
 
When I say “animal behavior,” I really should say “nonhuman animal behavior” 
because humans are, of course, animals. But the dividing line between humans 
and all other life forms has been so ingrained in Western civilization for so 
long that the phrase “animal behavior” is tough to shake.
Unfortunately, study of many primates in their natural habitats is becom-
ing impossible as primate species go extinct or their habitats are reduced. 
(You can read more about the peril in which many primate species exist in 
Chapter 4.) Unfortunately, primatologists must resort to studying many pri-
mate species in enclosure settings such as zoos. Considering that humanity 
has only been doing extensive and broad, comparative primatology for a few 
decades and is only just sketching out an understanding of the living pri-
mates, this situation is a real shame.
Palaeoanthropology
Palaeoanthropology (palaeo meaning “old”) specifically studies the human 
species and its relatives in the ancient past, particularly focusing on the 
early proto-human species, known as the hominids. (You can check out more 
on hominids in Chapter 6; for more on the difference between hominids 
and hominins, head to the Introduction.) Palaeoanthropology is extremely 
diverse and involves finding ancient human fossils, excavating them (and any 
artifacts found with them), interpreting the skeletal remains to understand 
the anatomy, and reconstructing hominid behavior as well as evolutionary 
relationships. To accomplish all this, most palaeoanthropologists have a 
strong background in the following fields:
 
 Evolution: Because the foundation of biology must be comprehensively 
understood to make sense of the fossil record
 
 Skeletal anatomy: Because fossilized bone (bone turned to stone by a 
geochemical process) is the bread and butter of palaeoanthropology, 
understanding how the body’s skeletal tissues reflect daily life, disease, 
stress, and other factors is critical to reconstructing ancient ways of life

38
Par t I: What is Anthropology? 
 
 Geology: Because fossils are often found in complex geological 
circumstances
 
 Archaeology: Because archaeologists must exercise great care to exca-
vate fossils, the principles of keeping track of where they find items and 
carefully bringing them back to the lab are important
Some people even specialize within these divisions; some palaeoanthropolo-
gists focus on certain parts of the skeleton (like the teeth, the hand bones, 
or the pelvis), some focus on specific geological layers (to best understand 
them to the exclusion of all others), and some focus on palaeoecology, recon-
structing entire ancient ecosystems in which early hominids evolved.
One of the main contributions of palaeoanthropology to the human under-
standing of humanity is to fill in the missing links of the evolutionary chain 
connecting modern people to our most ancient ancestors. Unfortunately the 
term missing link is something of a misnomer because species aren’t so easy 
to define or draw lines around when you know them from fossil material 
only. But fossils can tell a lot about ancient life, and they do indeed show us, 
as a species, where we’ve been both figuratively and literally. (You can read 
more about fossils in Chapter 6.) Today, hundreds of fossil specimens bear 
some resemblance to modern people, and more ancient human-like forms. 
Because new species don’t pop up out of nowhere today, anthropologists 
can reasonably assume that these hundreds of fossils don’t represent early 
proto-humans that simply popped up and then vanished but rather members 
of our own lineage that slowly changed over time. They’re better thought of 
as shades from an evolutionary spectrum than links in a chain, but the latter 
metaphor has stuck, and it’s a tough one to fight.
Because the fossils of the earliest human ancestors are in Africa, fieldwork 
is complex and can be difficult; most of it occurs in the countries with the 
best infrastructure, like South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. Modern 
projects are normally large-scale, incorporating diverse international research 
teams. They commonly train African students as well, so that even in the past 20 
years, the authors of scientific reports are increasingly Africans themselves.
The biocultural animal
One thing that makes physical anthropology particularly complex is that 
humanity evolves not only as a result of biological factors but also because of 
cultural factors. For this reason, anthropologists call it biocultural evolution. 
Culture — which I discuss more thoroughly in Chapters 2 and 11 — is basi-
cally the set of ideas that dictate how you see and act in the world. Although 
humans survive by using both their biology and cultural information, all 
other animals survive mainly through their biology and by relying on instinct 
rather than such cultural information.

39
 Chapter 3: Actually, Four Mirrors: How Anthropology Is Studied
For example, cultural, not instinctual, information tells you certain kinds of 
wood are good for making a digging stick. You don’t know about different 
kinds of wood instinctually but because detailed information about the prop-
erties of different kinds of wood was passed on to your mind culturally — 
through some form of language — by your parent generation or your peers.
This difference may seem trivial, but it’s actually very important. For exam-
ple, consider the following cultural behaviors and their possible involvement 
with biological evolution of our species:
 
 The earliest use of stone tools corresponds with increased consumption 
of animal protein. More animal protein in turn changes the hominid diet 
and potentially its anatomy.
 
 The use of clothing (itself a cultural artifact) allows human bodies to 
survive in environments they wouldn’t normally survive in. For example, 
the human body is naturally best-suited for equatorial environments, 
not the Arctic, but the invention of heavy coats and other such clothing 
enables that body to survive Arctic temperatures.
Palaeoanthropologists are deeply concerned with understanding how cul-
tural, noncultural, and biocultural evolutionary factors shaped humanity 
through time.
The Koobi Fora research project
Just two years into my undergraduate study 
of archaeology, I was lucky enough to partici-
pate in a field school project in the Koobi Fora 
research project in northern Kenya. Run from 
the National Museum of Kenya and based on 
a landform called Koobi Fora on the eastern 
shore of Lake Turkana (once Lake Rudolf), the 
project was begun by Richard Leakey in the 
1960s. Today it’s run by his daughter, Dr. Louise 
Leakey, who orchestrates a team of 16 princi-
pal scientists from institutions as diverse as the 
Free University of Amsterdam, the Smithsonian 
Institution, and Australia National University.
Research at Koobi Fora has revealed more than 
200 early hominid fossils dating between about 
4 million and 700,000 years ago. As a student, 
I vividly remember crawling across the baking 
desert and finding chips of stone eroding from 
an ancient lake-shore; picking one up, I realized 
it had been buried for more than a million years, 
and my career was locked in that moment.
Currently, Rutgers University runs a field school 
at Koobi Fora; you can check it out at www.
rci.rutgers.edu/~kffs/. You can also 
keep up with the research on the project’s Web 
site at www.kfrp.com, which has a blog 
during field seasons and many photographs of 
fieldwork.

40
Par t I: What is Anthropology? 
Considering that analyzing and understanding a single fossil skull can take 
years (in addition to what may have been an extensive search and excavation), 
it’s no surprise that palaeoanthropology requires patience. But perhaps you 
should also give palaeoanthropologists some slack when they go a little crazy 
over new fossil discoveries. After all, it’s a slow business . . .
Archaeology: The Study 
of Ancient Societies
Archaeology studies ancient societies through their material remains, which 
you may know as artifacts. These artifacts number in the billions and pepper 
the globe, each a piece to the puzzle of our ancestors’ lives. Every arrow-
head, every stone net-weight, every clay pipe-stem and shard of glass, every 
mud brick and gnawed bone and corroding sword have something to tell 
about the lives of past human societies, and the archaeologists’ job is to fit 
the puzzle back together.
Fitting the puzzle back together isn’t easy. Archaeology isn’t that technically 
difficult or even expensive (compared, to, say, nuclear physics or chemistry), 
but it takes a long time to do well. Because artifacts are so numerous, and 
Is the human species still evolving?
One of the most common questions asked of 
anthropologists is whether the human species 
is still evolving. Have we reached a pinnacle? 
Will we become giant-brained, fragile-bodied 
space-dwellers, using only a single finger to 
press buttons in the far future?
The simple answer is that yes, we’re still evolv-
ing; if we have offspring (replicate), if those off-
spring aren’t clones (variation), and if not all of 
our offspring survive to sexual maturity (selec-
tion), then by definition, the human species is 
evolving. But it’s natural to ask whether we’re 
still evolving because — in developed countries 
at least — humanity has used medicine and 
other means to eliminate a lot of the pressures 
that once took so many of our children. With so 
many selective pressures defeated (at least in 
the short term), you may easily conclude that 
significant genetic evolution has stalled in 
developed countries in the last century or so.
But what’s still evolving, and very quickly, is 
human culture, and this process is just as impor-
tant as human genetic evolution. Human culture 
changes very rapidly, and the changes affect mil-
lions. Imagine the differences between the U.S. 
(say, in clothing and musical styles, concepts of 
race and religion, and the ethnic diversity of the 
population) in 1950 and in 2000 — some pretty 
major changes occurred in the late 1960s (for 
example, the success of the civil rights move-
ment). Whether the changes are good or bad is 
another matter; for the moment, the important 
idea is that yes, humanity is still evolving and in a 
very significant way.

41
 Chapter 3: Actually, Four Mirrors: How Anthropology Is Studied
archaeologists are eager to extract as much information from each object as 
possible, excavations of archaeological sites can take years, even generations.
Archaeological research has many goals but normally adheres to some 
common principles:
 
 Establishing chronologies, or sequences of events in the ancient world, 
such as dating when the first occurrence of writing, farming, or the use 
of fire
 
 Establishing spatial understanding of the chronicled events, such as 
where the first writing, farming, or use of the wheel occurred, and what 
that can reveal about their invention
 
 Understanding the evolution of ancient cultures through time so as 
to better understand why certain societies survived and others went 
extinct, or answer other large questions, such as what prompted the 
change from small-scale chiefdoms to large-scale civilizations
Archaeologists establish chronologies by carefully noting the age of artifacts 
recovered in excavations. They must carry excavations out carefully so they 
can record the exact position of artifacts; this care is critical to understanding the 
artifacts’ ages for many reasons (which you can read more about in Chapter 5).
Carefully recording where artifacts are found is another way to achieve spa-
tial understanding. If a stone bowl came from a cave in southern Mexico, you 
don’t want to confuse it with one found in northern Peru. This obvious logic 
extends all the way down to the centimeter, such that archaeologists work 
long hours carefully recovering artifacts with whisk brooms and other deli-
cate instruments.
Archaeology and evolution
Evolution is characterized by change; to understand ancient cultural evolu-
tion, archaeologists often focus on what changed through time in the ancient 
society they’re investigating.
For example, around 10,000 years ago people in the Danube River valley of 
southeastern Europe were highly mobile foragers who left only short-lived 
campsites for archaeologists to discover, but by about 7,000 years ago, they 
were a rather sedentary people, living in riverside villages that you would 
normally associate with farming people. However, the folk of these villages, 
including the fascinating site of Lepenski Vir, weren’t farmers; they continued 
to hunt and gather. Something, then, changed in their culture, and archaeolo-
gists want to know what it was.

42
Par t I: What is Anthropology? 
Explaining how cultures changed through time is one of the most contentious 
issues in the field of anthropology. Many models have been proposed to 
account for cultural change, including
 
 Cultural ecology: These approaches consider the most important 
changes in human culture to be traced back to ecological issues, such as 
food and water supply. These factors are certainly important, but some 
argue that cultural ecology misses the importance of factors such as 
religion and even the individual human, turning people into automatons 
that simply react to environmental changes.
 
 Postmodernism: Postmodern approaches place a high value on the ability 
of such factors as gender, ideology, religion, myth, and the individual to 
change culture over time.
 
 Marxism: These approaches focus on the organization of labor and the 
negotiation of social inequalities (haves and have-nots) in society. They 
have been interesting and useful for some archaeological investigations, 
but don’t work so well when ancient labor wasn’t organized as it is in the 
industrial world, and labor divisions and social inequalities weren’t very 
prominent (as in the many millions of years of foraging societies).
Archaeologists have proposed dozens of other lenses through which to envi-
sion and understand cultural change through time, and they’re fascinating. 
But none, in my view, has entirely explained everything, and I know that most 
archaeologists agree with me. Culture is complex, people are complex, and all 
kinds of events have happened in the past to shape cultural change. I say this 
in a few other places in this book: Single-factor models never seem to pan out.
 
Archaeology deals with change through time as reflected by the artifacts used 
by ancient humans, so its limit goes back to around 2.5 million years ago, the 
age of the earliest (known) artifacts. Archaeologists commonly mutter “We 
don’t do dinosaurs!” when people ask whether they’re excavating a dinosaur 
because the dinosaurs — studied by palaeontologists — became extinct 
around 65 million years ago.
More facets of archaeology
Like all the fields of anthropology, archaeology even has its own subfields; I 
describe two of the most important ones — dealing with the prehistoric and 
historic periods of human evolution — in the following sections.

43
 Chapter 3: Actually, Four Mirrors: How Anthropology Is Studied
Prehistoric archaeology
The earliest writing systems go back to about 6,000 years ago, and the entire 
period between that time and the time of the first stone tools (the first artifacts), 
around 2.5 million years ago, is called prehistory.
Prehistoric archaeology studies this period with many of the same concerns 
as historic-period archaeologists. However, some aspects of prehistoric 
archaeology are unique:
 
 A concern with ecology and adaptation: Whereas most peoples written 
about in the historic period were agriculturalists, people of the prehistoric 
Cultural evolution
Combining the terms cultural and evolution 
is enough to make some anthropologists see 
red. That’s because for a long time (from the 
late 1800s through the 1950s), anthropology 
labored under a mistaken concept of how cul-
ture changed through time, crudely grafting 
Darwinian evolution to the concept of culture. 
When this mistaken view was overturned in the 
mid-20th century, many anthropologists also 
threw out an evolutionary approach to culture, 
a move that has many archaeologists — me 
included — a little steamed.
The mistaken idea was that all human societies 
were on a Darwinian track toward Civilization 
and that those that didn’t make it were — how-
ever unfortunately — simply being selected 
against or weeded out by the pitiless forces 
of nature. This idea roughly categorized forag-
ing peoples (like Australian Aborigines, most 
Native Americans, and polar hunting folk) into 
the category of Savagery, followed by small-
scale farmers (like the chiefdoms of Hawaii 
or New Guinea) in the category of Barbarism, 
which could only evolve into — and rightly 
should evolve into, according to the idea — 
Civilization. That Civilization was typified by the 
Victorian white male of London was a nuance 
few noticed. This misconception of how culture 
changed (that all cultures were on the same 
track) was clearly and carefully used to justify 
colonial efforts worldwide that were consid-
ered beneficial; after all, Civilization was being 
brought to the Savages.
For many reasons, this theory revealed itself 
to be a flawed understanding: Human societ-
ies, it turns out, don’t have an automatic drive 
towards being white Victorian males. But this 
flaw isn’t enough to entirely ditch the concept 
that culture changes through time by an evolu-
tionary process.
Archaeologists, deeply concerned with the 
change in cultures through time, have most 
carefully examined cultural change, and they 
are most convinced that it does change by an 
evolutionary process. Culture doesn’t ride on 
the genes — it’s taught by language. Every 
society has its own way of surviving, but the 
principles of evolution apply to culture in some 
important ways. I don’t dwell on them in this 
book, but if you’re interested, you may want 
to start with some more advanced readings 
in archaeology, such as textbooks that cover 
archaeological theory.

period were mostly foragers who moved across landscapes to hunt 
and gather their food; figuring out what they ate and how they got their 
hands on it (adapted) is a central focus of prehistory.
 
 A focus on stone, bone, and antler artifacts: Before the historic farming 
societies, artifacts made from these materials were the most likely to 
have survived decay over the millennia. Wood was also important, but 
not much has survived.
 
 A concern with egalitarian social organization: Unlike the farming soci-
eties, which ranked members according to how much they did or didn’t 
have, prehistoric societies were essentially socially equal.
Keep in mind that just because some societies took up writing around 6,000 
years ago, not all did; many remained foragers or other folks outside the 
growing civilizations. These people included the Native Americans, people 
who lived in the Americas for well over 10,000 years before the arrival of 
European explorers. Those explorers wrote down what they observed of the 
Native Americans, so documents do exist that describe people on the margins 
of history. But of course the Native Americans had their own histories, told 
as oral traditions, so they weren’t people without history.
Historic archaeology
Historic archaeology takes advantage of the fact that about 6,000 years ago, 
some human groups invented language and began to write down things that 
can tell about the past. In a way, because I’m primarily a prehistoric archae-
ologist, I envy historic archaeologists; they have a lot more information to 
go on when they start their research. On the other hand, when I start looking 
into the billions of pages of historic records about the ancient world, I realize 
that the historic record presents as many problems as it does solutions.
Historic archaeology proceeds with many of the same concerns and methods 
as prehistoric archaeology, but it often addresses two issues of particular 
importance.
History, as the saying goes, is written by the winners, which is another way 
of saying that each story has (at least) two sides. The use of propaganda, the 
convenient omission of inconvenient facts from state records, and the whole-
sale creation of “facts” are nothing new; these occurred in every ancient 
civilization, from Sumer to the Incan empire. Unless you’re happy to simply 
believe what ancient governmental records tell you about their illustrious 
(and they’re always illustrious) leaders, historic archaeology is a good way to 
test that written record against artifacts in the ground.
Written records of the ancient world often dealt with the royalty and their 
activities, military conquests, or religious ceremonies and ideas, but they 

45
 Chapter 3: Actually, Four Mirrors: How Anthropology Is Studied
rarely discussed the common people — the peasants — who formed the bulk 
of the population of every ancient civilization. And unless you’re directly 
descended from royalty — and I mean without a drop of commoner’s blood 
in your veins, which is pretty unlikely — the history of the common person 
is partly your history. Historical archaeology sometimes focuses on these 
forgotten ancestors, fleshing out the history books with a fuller picture of the 
ancient world.
Linguistic Anthropology
Linguistic anthropology studies human language, the animal kingdom’s most 
uniquely powerful — and at the same time subtle — system of communica-
tion between individuals.
Language is basically a system of information transmission and reception; 
humans communicate these messages by sound (speech), by gesture (body 
language), and in other visual ways such as writing. Because language is one 
of humanity’s most distinctive characteristics, I devote all of Chapter 13 to a 
detailed examination of what language is and how it may have evolved.
Linguistic anthropology traditionally focuses on several key issues, each 
resulting from a new research paradigm developed over the last 60 or so 
years. Interestingly, these interests haven’t steamrolled the previous ones 
but rather incorporated and complemented earlier types of investigations. 
The following list details some of those key issues:
 
 Classification of languages, to identify which languages evolved when 
and where
 
 Understanding of language structure, units, and grammar
 
 Identification of the ways language constructs identity, ideology, and 
narratives
Another topic of considerable interest has been when, where, and among 
what species modern human language first appeared and how it evolved. 
This is one of the great questions of anthropology, but it’s such a massively 
complex topic that all you really need to know at this level is that, at pres-
ent, no single model or theory has convinced all anthropologists just how 
language first evolved. People have presented some compelling theories, but 
anthropologists are still evaluating them. You can read more about these 
theories in Chapters 7 and 13.

46
Par t I: What is Anthropology? 
Nonhuman animal communication
Nonhuman animals also communicate; this reminds humanity that we’re not 
as different from other animals as people often like to think.
 
Although chimpanzees and gorillas have been taught several varieties of 
basic sign-language and can use these signs to assemble basic sentences — on 
the order, generally speaking, of a three-year-old human’s sentences — it’s 
important to remember that chimps and gorillas haven’t invented or evolved 
language on their own in the wild. This fact suggests that the capacity to do 
something (learn language) doesn’t necessarily indicate that it will occur in 
the wild.
Nonhuman animal communication is different from human communication 
and language, though, in certain ways:
 
 Nonhuman language is symbolically simple. A monkey’s screech for 
“hawk” (an aerial predator) is surely distinct from a squawk for “python” 
(a ground predator), but “hawk” or “python” are ALL these sounds can 
mean. On the other hand, humans can use language to say “That guy is 
a real python,” attaching the ideas of the person to the idea of snake-like 
qualities.
 
 Nonhuman words are phonemically simple. That is, although human 
words can be constructed from many sounds (like the word constitutional) 
nonhuman “words” are usually formed of two or fewer sounds.
 
 Nonhuman language is grammatically simple. Although human sen-
tences can be constructed from many words (like “I broke the glass that 
was sitting on the edge of the table”), nonhuman “sentences” are very 
rare, and grammatical rules for their assembly are lacking.
Spoken language
Human spoken language, in contrast to nonhuman communication, has the 
following characteristics:
 
 Human language is extraordinarily fast, communicating information at 
a high speed.
 
 Human language is extraordinarily dense, communicating a lot of infor-
mation per unit of time.
 
 Human language is extraordinarily subtle, with the use of metaphor 
being common and radically multiplying the potential meaning of any 
word, sentence, or even idea.

47
 Chapter 3: Actually, Four Mirrors: How Anthropology Is Studied
Gesture and body language
In addition to spoken human language, we also use gesture, or what Adam 
Kendon, editor of the scholarly journal Gesture, has called “visible action as 
utterance.” Gesture isn’t exactly the same as a word; it’s more of a reinforce-
ment of what you’re saying aloud. And it’s very important. You can imagine 
how using the wrong gestures in the wrong circumstances could cost you 
heavily!
Gestures vary widely worldwide, but some common patterns occur.
 
 You can use gesture to point.
 
 You can use gesture to indicate a state of mind.
 
 You can use gesture to reinforce what you’re saying.
 
 You can use gesture to negate what you’re saying (for instance, to indicate 
sarcasm).
 
 You can use gesture to mark beginning or ending points in a conversation.
The boy who cried Whorf
One of the most fascinating and controver-
sial concepts in linguistic anthropology is the 
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, forwarded in the 1930s 
by linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf. 
The two argued that language does as much 
to create human reality as it does to reflect the 
real world.
In 1940, Whorf wrote, “We dissect nature 
along lines laid down by our native languages. 
The categories and types that we isolate from 
the world of phenomena we do not find there 
because they stare every observer in the face; 
on the contrary, the world is presented in a 
kaleidoscopic flux of impressions which has to 
be organized by our minds — and this means 
largely by the linguistic systems by our minds. 
We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and 
ascribe significances as we do, largely because 
we are parties to an agreement to organize it in 
this way — an agreement that holds through-
out our speech community and is codified in 
the patterns of our language. The agreement is, 
of course, an implicit and unstated one, but its 
terms are absolutely obligatory; we cannot talk 
at all except by subscribing to the organization 
and classification of data which the agreement 
decrees.”
In other words, although an objective real-
ity exists — jump off a cliff and you will die, 
whether you call it “flying” or “dying” — your 
impressions of that world are strongly shaped 
by the vocabulary you have to describe that 
world. For me, the lesson is to increase your 
vocabulary, to learn other languages or at least 
words from other languages — you don’t know 
what new things you may find in the world.

48
Par t I: What is Anthropology? 
These are fascinating issues considering that the first languages most likely 
had a strong gestural component, and you could potentially discover much 
about them by studying modern gesture. Figure 3-3 shows some polite ges-
tures of 17th-century Europe; the upper left gesture is “adoration,” the upper 
right “reconciliation,” the lower left “impatience,” the lower right “demonstra-
tion,” and the middle “benediction.” You can easily imagine using these ges-
tures in your own communication; think about how different communication 
is without them . . . for example, over e-mail.

Cultural Anthropology: The Study 
of Living Societies
Whereas archaeology studies ancient cultures, cultural anthropology focuses 
on living societies. Some reasons include
 
 An attempt to identify cultural similarities worldwide: Such similarities 
may offer very important insights into what it is to be human.

49
 Chapter 3: Actually, Four Mirrors: How Anthropology Is Studied
 
 An attempt to identify cultural differences worldwide: Such differences 
can illustrate the diverse ways humans have found to survive across the 
globe and, in some cases, through time.
 
 An attempt to correct supposedly common-sense ideas about humanity: 
This process is important because most cultures worldwide believe 
their own way of living is the most appropriate and right for all of 
humanity.
Putting the culture in cultural anthropology
Whatever end you hope to achieve through cultural anthropology, the means 
are going to be a study of culture. Culture has been defined in many ways; 
I give you a definition in the section “The biocultural animal” earlier in this 
chapter, and you can take graduate-level courses just to grapple with culture 
theory. Generally speaking, culture encompasses everything from attitudes 
toward material objects to philosophical, political, and religious concepts.
Cultural anthropology: An equal-opportunity 
whistle-blower
Attempting to rectify common-sense evalua-
tions of the rest of the world is a sort of correc-
tive for human perception of itself. The idea that 
one’s own culture is the best and most appro-
priate way to live is called ethnocentrism, and 
it’s been used to justify discrimination against 
people outside ones’ own culture for centuries 
and worldwide. Keep in mind that just because 
a cultural practice exists doesn’t necessar-
ily mean that it’s good for the culture at large; 
like slavery, it may benefit a relative few at the 
expense of many. Robert G. Edgerton’s book 
Sick Societies demonstrates that many human 
cultural adaptations are actually maladapta-
tions, adaptations that are actually bad for the 
society rather than beneficial. For example, 
some agricultural practices provide high yields 
in the short run but may burn out the soil in the 
long run.
Western civilization isn’t shy about pointing 
out obvious problems of its own — such as 
racial discrimination or the fact that women 
make significantly less money than men — and 
should remain open to the possibility that such 
problems are possible in other cultures. In this 
way, cultural anthropology isn’t just a discipline 
focused on bashing Western civilization; it’s an 
objective science that doesn’t idealize any soci-
ety over another.

50
Par t I: What is Anthropology? 
Important features of culture include the following:
 
 Culture isn’t genetic; it’s learned. Each new generation doesn’t receive 
it in genes but from parents, siblings, and anyone else in the culture 
(largely through language).
 
 Culture is shared among a population, but it allows variation within 
it. Individuals of a culture may have their own interpretations of the 
culture’s set of descriptions of the universe and instructions for how to 
live properly in it. This discrepancy is important because it recognizes 
a major characteristic of humanity: individuality, the fact that humans 
aren’t typically of one mind but rather are individuals with a great deal 
of individual personality.
 
 Cultural information is often symbolic. Symbols — which are linguistic, 
visual, and gestural metaphors that stand for something else — are 
heavily influential in the communication of culture from one generation 
to the next.
Although cultural information rides in the brain, humans can also express 
it physically. Material objects — for example, seagoing canoes, totem poles, 
or sports cars — are also expressions of certain cultural ideas. Even the 
most apparently utilitarian artifacts, like writing pens, can and often do carry 
cultural information. A glitter-spangled, bubblegum-pink pen is more likely 
to belong to an adolescent girl than to a public official; the official prob-
ably requires a fancier pen to project a certain image in public ceremonies. 
Material objects, then, constitute culture; some call the study of such items 
the study of material culture. Because archaeologists study ancient cultures 
through their artifacts — which are material culture — they’ve made the 
most thorough studies of material culture.
Attempting to explain why 
humans do what they do
Cultural anthropologists have devised many fascinating and complex bodies 
of theory to explain humanity and the diversity and commonalities of human 
cultures. Among them:
 
 Evolutionary approaches (including materialist approaches) that seek 
explanations by looking for the adaptive advantages of various cultural 
practices — such as cannibalism or social ranking — worldwide. These 
theories seem to explain some things, but critics argue that they ignore 
the significance of individual action, which is sometimes known as agency.
 
 Functionalist approaches that understand elements of culture as each 
working in an integrated way to promote the culture’s welfare. Critics 

51
 Chapter 3: Actually, Four Mirrors: How Anthropology Is Studied
claim that these approaches ignore the importance of conflict, which is 
always present in culture (particularly those with social rank or class 
differences).
 
 Postmodern approaches that focus on conflicts, individual agency, 
and other nonstandard aspects of culture. Critics argue that such 
approaches, though they admirably give voice to common people, often 
ignore physical, material, and evolutionary realities of the fact that 
humans are evolving animals.
As with single-factor attempts to describe all of cultural change, I can confi-
dently say no one explanation of the complexity of culture has convinced all 
anthropologists of its validity; single-factor models never seem to pan out.
One of the most important tools for the cultural anthropologist is the ethnogra-
phy, a document describing some aspect of some culture, written by a trained 
observer — a cultural anthropologist who often participates, to some degree, 
in the culture he’s observing. See Chapter 12 for more on ethnographies.
Participant observation
Cultural anthropologists gather their raw data — information about life in 
traditional societies — in a number of ways, but a major technique is partici-
pant observation. This method includes living with or among the people they 
observe and even taking part in those peoples’ activities, such as foraging or 
religious ceremonies.
Cultural anthropology versus sociology
People often confuse cultural anthropology with 
the related discipline of sociology, but you can 
note at least two clear distinctions between the 
two fields:
  Cultural anthropology focuses on nonin-
dustrial societies. These groups are often 
called traditional societies because they 
have many things in common with societ-
ies that existed before the recent, massive 
global changes associated with post–World 
War II globalism. On the other hand, sociol-
ogy tends to focus on industrial or Western 
civilization (particularly urban civilization).
  Cultural anthropology tends to rely on 
direct interviews with the members of tra-
ditional societies. Many of these people 
don’t read or write, and sociologists tend to 
gather data with questionnaires.
Academic departments of sociology and anthro-
pology often have close connections and some-
times merge, but their theoretical backgrounds 
are very different. Sociology’s roots are in eco-
nomics and anthropology’s in the humanities. 
Although they share some similarities, it’s prob-
ably best to keep these fields separate.

52
Par t I: What is Anthropology? 
Early anthropologists didn’t spend too much time thinking about how to 
do this work effectively and were often so scientifically detached from the 
people they were studying that they came away with inaccurate reports. 
As the pendulum has swung the other way in the last few decades, some 
anthropologists became so personally involved with the societies they were 
investigating that their own reports were too personal and still missed real 
understanding. Cultural anthropologists have to tread a fine line between 
these extremes.
Today, most cultural anthropology graduate students spend a long time 
studying how to do participant observation before simply heading out to do 
it. They often study
 
 Effective and respectful ways to introduce themselves to a community 
they want to study. (How would you react if someone from, say, New 
Guinea arrived at your doorstep and asked whether she could live with 
you for a few months, just out of her own curiosity?)
 
 Culturally sensitive ways to negotiate difficulties.
 
 The language(s) of the region they will study.
 
 Everything ever written, filmed, recorded, or speculated about the society 
they will study.
Once doing actual field research, cultural anthropologists stay on track by 
maintaining both emic and etic perspectives.
The emic perspective
An emic perspective focuses on how the people being observed think rather 
than how the cultural anthropologist may think. For example, for an emic 
understanding of a landscape, an anthropologist may ask a native hunter to 
draw out his own idea of what the land looks like. This image may be very dif-
ferent from what it looks like on a printed map, but in some ways that map is 
irrelevant to the hunter’s life.
The etic perspective
An etic perspective focuses on the observer being an objective scientist 
capable of seeing patterns that even a native of the culture at hand may be 
unaware of. Anyone who has had the experience of someone telling her how 
she’s behaving — even if she can’t see it herself — recognizes the benefit of 
this perspective. Here, an analysis of the hunter’s movement across the land-
scape would focus on the map derived from a satellite image.

53
 Chapter 3: Actually, Four Mirrors: How Anthropology Is Studied
Applied anthropology and global culture
Applied anthropology is a kind of cultural anthropology that applies what’s 
known abut human culture to various pressing, real-world issues such as dis-
crimination against women, the implementation of Third-World aid programs, 
or child-labor issues. For at least the last decade, about half of cultural 
anthropology PhDs haven’t gone into academics but rather into agencies 
such as the UN to assist in improving culturally sensitive communications 
worldwide.
The Society for Applied Anthropology (www.sfaa.net/) lists its mission as 
promoting “ . . . interdisciplinary scientific investigation of the principles con-
trolling the relations of human beings to one another, and the encouragement 
of the wide application of these principles to practical problems.” Essentially, 
this means applying what anthropologists have learned about human culture 
at large — and the culture in question specifically — to policy statements 
Notes from the field
My colleague, Dr. Evan Davies, spent months 
with the BaAka of central Africa. His doctoral 
dissertation, describing his experiences, is 
a combination of emic and etic descriptions. 
Following is an etic description of the phenom-
enon of social fission as an example of what 
anthropologists can learn from fieldwork:
“There are two major seasonal changes 
throughout Central Africa that affect the subsis-
tence strategies of the BaAka, the rainy season 
which lasts roughly from to April to October 
and the dry season, which runs the rest of the 
year with the exception a few brief periods of 
rain during the winter months. During the dry 
season, the game animals in the forest must 
congregate around the major water sources 
(rivers and their tributaries) in the forest, and 
are hunted with relative ease by the BaAka. 
During this time, the BaAka live in semi perma-
nent villages close to towns and embark into 
the forest on day hunts. They are usually able to 
catch enough game during a day spent hunting 
to last them several days. A village sized band 
of approximately 75 people may therefore spend 
the months of the dry season hunting every fifth 
day or so, and the rest of the time will be spent 
in their village cooking, eating and resting, 
repairing their dwellings and their tools.”
“With the advent of the rains in the spring, the 
game animals hunted by the BaAka have more 
water sources available to them, and so are no 
longer forced to frequent the perennial sources 
of water that as they did during the dry season. 
Because the animals are more dispersed in the 
forest, the BaAka must travel further into the 
forest and remain for longer periods of time to 
catch enough to feed themselves.
For this reason, it is no longer advantageous 
for these hunter gatherers to travel in a large 
single group as they did during the dry season, 
when game was plentiful. It is more helpful for 
members of the group to fragment into smaller, 
nuclear family sized groups and spread out into 
the forest much as the game they are hunting, 
and so, during the rainy season we witness 
social fission among the BaAka.”

54
Par t I: What is Anthropology? 
and implementation. In effect, applied anthropology remedies the solution 
of distant bureaucrats making momentous decisions about a culture’s way 
of life from on high. Rather, this bottom-up approach recognizes that simply 
imposing change is less effective and respectful than working with people to 
stimulate change that works for them.
Anthropologists have played important roles in all kinds of applications of 
their knowledge, but serious ethical considerations inevitably come into play 
when researching human beings and applying the information gathered. In 
the 1960s, the U.S. Army commissioned anthropologists to study and explain 
how warfare was carried out in Central America. But many anthropologists 
objected that this information would be little more than intelligence used to 
better plot warfare in the interest of the U.S., and the ensuing Camelot Affair 
drove the American Anthropological Association to draft its first Statement 
on Ethics in 1967.
On the other hand, many anthropologists have been pivotal in using anthro-
pology to better human life. You can find out more about these issues 
throughout Part IV of this book.

here are millions of kinds of living things (some estimate that millions 
more are undiscovered in the jungles and oceans), and making sense of 
them has been the labor biologists for centuries. (Check out the “Biological 
classification” sidebar in this chapter for more on this process.) Among these 
swimming, hopping, and crawling life forms are the primates, a group of 
about 200 kinds of animal that share some distinctive anatomical and behav-
ioral characteristics. This is the Primate order, our home in the biological 
world.
To better understand the human species, anthropology has taken up the 
study of our closest relatives: Where do they come from? How long have they 
been living there? Why do they eat the things they eat? This chapter gives 
you an overview of what that family is like and how you fit in.
Monkey Business: Primate Origins
The earliest proto-primates have been traced from fossils of the Palaeocene 
epoch some 65 million years ago; most anthropologists agree that the 
Primate order was well underway by 60 million years ago. The number 65 
million may ring a bell as the time of the extinction of the dinosaurs, and the 
rise of primates is related to the demise of the dinosaurs. Early mammals, 

58
Part II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology
from which the primates evolved, appear somewhat earlier, but when the 
dinosaurs became extinct, the way opened up for other life forms to flourish. 
Many more mammals show up after 65 million years ago, and among them 
are the first primates.
The fossils of the earliest primates show two main features:
 
 Small body size, averaging roughly 150 to 3,000 grams, or about 1/3 
pound to about 6 pounds
 
 Teeth, indicating an insectivorous diet specializing in insects
So our earliest primate relatives were small, insect-eating mammals, in many 
ways physically similar to squirrels. You can see a reconstruction of one of 
these first primates in Figure 4-1). Skeletal analysis suggests that these early 
primates were arboreal (lived in trees) and that’s very common in the living 
primates.
 
Most of the characteristics of the early primates are studied from fossils of 
their teeth and skulls (and a few limb bones). Bone fossilization is the process 
by which minerals slowly replace the organic content of the bones of a dead 
animal, resulting in a very detailed stone replica of the original bone. Fossils 
can be so detailed that they show scratches (on the teeth, for example, from 
chewing) under a microscope.

 Chapter 4: The Wildest Family Reunion: Meet the Primates
You Look Like an Ape: Primate Species
Biologically speaking, you’re an ape. So am I, and so is everyone else in the world. 
It’s true. This section shows you the general characteristics of all primates and 
then focuses in on the main groupings of primates, including the apes.
Biological classification
Scientists first began to systematically clas-
sify living things in the 1700s according to a 
system laid out by Swedish naturalist Carolus 
Linneaus, inventor of Linnean Classification. 
Linneaus noted (obviously enough) that many 
life forms had anatomical and (in the case of 
animals) behavioral similarities to other life 
forms, and he began grouping them accord-
ing to those similarities. Dogs and horses, for 
example, shared the characteristic of having 
hair-covered skin and suckling their young; 
although dogs and horses are different in many 
other ways, those characteristics made dogs 
and horses more similar to each other than 
either was to some other life forms like fish. 
Despite their differences, dogs and horses are 
both mammals. Anatomical similarity is still the 
basis of life-form identification, but genetic data 
increasingly factor in as well.
The four main levels of the hierarchical clas-
sification system used today are significant to 
understanding primates:
  The order: All primates are in the Primate 
order, which is different from the order 
Canidae (the dogs and dog-like animals), 
the order Felidae (all the cats, from lion to 
Tom), and so on.
  The family: The Primate order contains 
several families of primates, including 
the Pongidae (chimpanzees, gorillas, and 
orangutans), the Hominidae (humans and 
our ancestors), and the Colobinae (the pri-
mates of South America).
  The genus: Several genera (plural of genus) 
are members of the Primate order, includ-
ing the genus Papio (the baboons) and the 
genus Homo (humans and their ances-
tors).
  The species: About 200 species of primates 
exist. If two individuals are sexually viable 
(can interbreed and have healthy offspring 
that themselves can have healthy off-
spring), the two individuals are in the same 
species.
Humans, then, are in the order Primate, the 
family Hominidae, the genus Homo, and the spe-
cies sapiens. Subspecies designations exist as 
well, and all humans today are in the subspecies 
sapiens. Therefore, humans are Homo sapiens 
sapiens, whereas Central African chimpanzees 
are in the family Pongidae, the genus Pongo, 
and the species pygmaeus; they’re known as 
Pongo pygmaeus.

Part II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology
What’s in a name? General 
primate characteristics
As primates evolved after 65 million years ago, they developed the more dis-
tinctive characteristics seen in the living species as well as their fossil ances-
tors. Today, although the many kinds of primates vary a great deal, they do 
share some basic traits:
 
 Wide range of body size, from 100 grams (1/3 pound) to 200 kilograms 
(more than 400 pounds). On average, primates are about 10 pounds, 
which is a little larger than most rodents and a little smaller than most 
hoofed animals.
 
 Large eyes with three-dimensional vision, allowing keen depth perception.
 
 Lack of emphasis on a snout. Primates focus on vision rather than sense 
of smell, which appears in other animals’ snouts.
 
 Large brain case containing the largest brain — relative to body size — 
of any land animal.
 
 Heterodont (differentiated) teeth, indicating a varied diet. For example, 
the incisors can clip one kind of food, and the molars can crush another.
 
 Nails rather than claws, allowing more sensitive grasping of tree limbs.
Today, the primate order contains about 230 living primate species (give or 
take a few, depending on whom you ask). Although you could spend a life-
time studying them in all their diversity (not to mention the fossil record of 
the ancestry of each living species), for most purposes it’s enough to recog-
nize four main subgroups in the primate order: the prosimians, the Old World 
monkeys, the New World monkeys, and the apes. I take a closer look at these 
subgroups in the following sections. You can see how they relate to one 
another in Figure 4-2 (refer to the nearby sidebar for a refresher on biological 
classification), and Figure 4-3 shows how some of them appear. Regarding 
Figure 4-2, note that different physical anthropologists classify the primates 
in slightly different ways, and some don’t even consider the loris — shown in 
this figure but not discussed in the text — a primate. Although variations like 
this exist, the classification shown here is widely used.
The primate dental formula is a notation of the number of various tooth types 
in the individual mouth, counting incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, 
in each quadrant of the mouth (upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower 
right). Different dental formulas can tell anthropologists about the relationships 
between species. For example, humans have two incisors, one canine, two premo-
lars and three molars, for a dental formula of 2.1.2.3, whereas New World monkeys 
(a very different group) have an extra premolar, for a formula of 2.1.3.3. Figure 4-4 
compares the dental formulas of an Old World ape and a New World monkey.

Although you read lists of separate species characteristics, like body weight 
or diet, those characteristics always intertwine. Therefore, diet can have 
effects on body weight and vice versa, and exactly how one characteristic 
affects another isn’t always easy to understand. In fact, I’d say that although 
anthropology today has very good lists of these characteristics and can very 
clearly describe the primate species, as a field anthropology doesn’t always 
have a good explanation for how the characteristics interact. That doesn’t 
mean that anthropology can’t ever understand them, but at the moment I’d 
say that anthropologists are just now working out the interactions of the 
anatomical and behavioral characteristics.
Going ape (and prosimian): 
Primate subgroups
All the primates have the characteristics I mention in the preceding section, 
but even a quick look at the primates reveals some clear divisions. The fol-
lowing sections describe the four main kinds of primates.

Squirrel-cats: The prosimians
One of the major divisions in the Primate order is that between the Anthropoidea 
(the people-like apes and monkeys) and the Prosimii (or prosimians, which 
are pretty different from people even though they’re clearly primates). 
Baboons, chimpanzees, and gorillas — all in the Anthropoidea — are very 
obviously similar to humans, but connecting to, say, the ring-tailed lemur 
(a cat-like prosimian of Madagascar that has a long, striped tail) or the tiny, 
bug-eyed, shrew-like tarsier that can fit in the palm of your hand is a little more 
difficult. Still, these animals are primates — even though they can look like a 
cross between a squirrel and a cat — and they typically have the following dis-
tinctive traits:

 Relatively long snouts in some species (long for primates, anyway), 
although they may also have very large eyes
 
 A dental formula of 2.1.3.3
 
 Small body size compared to other primates; they range from mouse-
size to cat-size, averaging about 5 kilograms or 10 pounds
 
 Some are nocturnal and have a diet that favors insects but includes tree 
saps, grubs, fruit, flowers, and leaves
 
Nocturnal animals are most active at night, whereas diurnal species are most 
active in daylight. Making a living in darkness or light has effects on what 
foods animals eat, how they avoid predators, how they move about their envi-
ronment, and so on.
Probably the strangest primate is the aye-aye of Madagascar. About the size 
of a cat with enormous, hairless ears, the aye-aye climbs through trees by 
moonlight listening for larvae beneath tree bark. When it hears a squirming 
treat, it uses a thin, elongated finger to scoop the meal out of the bark. Even 
the driest textbooks of primatology can’t help but marvel over this creature, 
which one author called the most “improbable” primate; another said that 
the aye-aye, though clearly a primate, displayed the most extreme specializa-
tion of anatomy in the order. This means that although most primates are 
somewhat general in their diet (many have a varied, omnivorous diet), the 
aye-aye is quite specialized and inflexible in its diet. Unfortunately, such spe-
cialization can prove disastrous if the prey species itself becomes extinct or 
somehow declines.

64
Part II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology
So if the prosimians are so strange, why are they considered primates? Well, 
they generally have nails rather than claws, focus on vision rather than smell 
for their sensory specialty, have relatively mobile wrists and ankles, and live 
mostly in the trees. For all these reasons (as well as connections shown to 
the rest of the primates in the genetic data), the prosimians are, in fact, rela-
tions (albeit some pretty strange ones; of course, they could say the same 
about us). Because the prosimians are very much like the earliest primates, 
understanding them and what they can reveal about primate origins is impor-
tant; unfortunately, they’re endangered.
 
Many of the prosimians live on the island of Madagascar, off East Africa, where 
they’ve been isolated, in an evolutionary sense, for millions of years. Today 
almost 50 known species exist (two new species were discovered as recently 
as 2005), and, unfortunately, they’re all in danger of extinction. Humans first 
came to Madagascar just 1,500 years ago, and since that time many prosimian 
species have become extinct due to deforestation. You can keep up with these 
issues at http://www.wildmadagascar.org/.
The Old World monkeys
The monkeys of the Old World, members of the parvorder (a major division 
in the order) Catarrhini (meaning narrow-nosed) are distinct from the New 
World monkeys because they live on a different continent, distinct from the 
apes because the apes are generally larger, and different from the prosimians 
because they’re generally larger and have evolved more ecological adaptations 
than the prosimians. They also have the following distinctive anatomical 
characteristics:
 
 Narrow nose with nostrils facing down (as opposed to wide-nosed, out-
facing nostrils in New World monkeys)
 
 A dental formula of 2.1.2.3 (one premolar fewer than the New World 
monkeys,) with some species having molars shaped like knives for 
shearing vegetation
You can’t go home again
An adaptive radiation is the adaptation of a 
species to a new environment. When new envi-
ronments open up — for example, when a land 
bridge connects two previously separated con-
tinents or islands — life forms normally migrate 
into these new environments. If they survive, the 
colonists adapt to the new ecological conditions 
and, over evolutionary time, become adapted to 
those conditions. When the colonists are so dif-
ferent from their ancestral population (the ones 
who didn’t cross the land bridge, for example) 
that they can no longer interbreed with those 
ancestral forms, speciation has occurred.

65
 Chapter 4: The Wildest Family Reunion: Meet the Primates
 
 Lack of a prehensile tail (see the next section for more on prehensile tails)
 
 Both arboreal and terrestrial lifestyles
The Old World monkeys are themselves split into at least two main groups: 
the subfamilies Cercopithecinae (including the terrestrial, brilliantly colored 
mandrill baboons) and Colobinae, which include the large-nosed proboscis 
monkey and the leaf-devouring colobus monkey, with its large, complex, leaf-
digesting stomach. Old World monkeys live in diverse habitats, from dry 
African savanna to the snowy mountains of Japan. Africa’s patas monkey, dis-
tributed south of the Sahara, is a consummate survivor, consuming fruit, bird 
eggs, roots, and leaves; it can also sprint at up to 88 kph (55 mph), making it 
the fastest primate. Japanese snow monkeys spend winter hours soaking in 
natural hot springs.
The New World monkeys
The New World (South America) is home to primates as well; they’re mem-
bers of the parvorder Platyrrhini, meaning “broad-nosed,” as compared to 
their Old World counterparts discussed in the last section. Shortly after 
the origin of the primates around 40 million years ago, South America was 
already sliding away from its previous link with Africa, and riding on it (or 
perhaps drifting to it on natural rafts of vegetation, purely by accident) were 
the ancestors of the New World monkeys. They survive into the present and 
have the following distinctive characteristics:
 
 Wide nose (compared to the Old World monkeys)
 
 Dental formula of 2.1.3.3 (an extra premolar)
 
 Most have a prehensile tail used to grasp tree limbs
 
 A completely arboreal lifestyle
The New World monkeys include the very loud howler monkey (which scares 
tourists because the howl sounds like a Hollywood jaguar), the fruit-eating 
spider monkey (which has a very handy prehensile tail), and the strange 
little marmosets, which live high in the trees on a diverse diet of insects, 
fruits, and leaves. Generally speaking, the New World monkeys are somewhat 
smaller than those of the Old World, with most species averaging about 7 
kilograms (about 15 pounds).
Our gang: The apes
The most human-esque group — the apes — are scientifically known as the 
Hominoidea, or “human-like” primates. Fossil evidence puts the origins of 
this group around 30 million years ago, in Africa’s middle Oligocene epoch. 
By 6 million years ago, a new group appeared in the Hominoidea — the 
Hominidae; these are the apes that walked upright, and one of their kind 

66
Part II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology
eventually evolved into the genus Homo, which evolved into Homo sapiens 
sapiens: humans. So, modern human origins can be traced by fossil evidence 
to Africa, 6 to 30 million years ago, in the evolution of the Hominoidea. 
Remember, we’re not the only member of the group, and our neighbor spe-
cies, such as the chimpanzees and gorillas, have also survived all this time. 
(Note: This classification is a bit of a gray area. Only recently have some 
anthropologists included chimps and gorillas in the same family as humans, 
as I do here; previously, Hominidae was reserved only for the bipedal pri-
mates.) The main anatomical characteristics of the Hominoidea are
 
 Dental formula of 2.1.2.3
 
 Lack of a tail
 
 Both arboreal and terrestrial lifestyles
 
 Relatively long arms (even with a terrestrial lifestyle) due to origins as 
tree-swingers
 
 Simple molars for crushing, rather than the Old World Monkey’s shear-
like molars
 
 Relatively large body size, averaging more than 10 kilograms (30 
pounds)
The Hominoidea is easily divisible into two main families, which mainly sepa-
rate the Hominoidea into the somewhat monkey-like gibbons of Southeast 
Asia and the African apes.
 
 The Hylobatidae contain the gibbons of Southeast Asia, who tear 
through the forest canopy like Tarzan and have complex vocalizations 
(also like Tarzan). They’re the lightest of the Hominoidea and the least 
like humans: They spend a lot of time in the trees, they have relatively 
small brains, and they survive on a diet that, although somewhat varied, 
is predominantly fruit.
 
 Much more like humans are members of the Hominidae, the group con-
taining the, chimpanzee and gorilla (according to the DNA and skeletal 
evidence), and humans themselves. Generally speaking, these primates 
are large (averaging over 40 kilograms or 80 pounds), may live much of 
their lives on the ground, and have a generalized rather than specialized 
diet. They include Homo sapiens sapiens, a relatively large primate (aver-
aging 70 kilograms or 140 pounds) that possesses a very large brain 
compared to body size and uses extremely complex behavior and tools to 
adapt and survive. That should sound familiar because you’re one of them.

67
 Chapter 4: The Wildest Family Reunion: Meet the Primates
 
When you think about the past, and the fossil record, and the many individual 
primates that lie in your own past (right back to the first primates more than 
60 million years ago), remember that a lot of speciations and extinctions have 
occurred. Generally speaking, most species (defined in the “Biological classifi-
cation” sidebar earlier in the chapter) survive only about 4 million years; most 
genera survive for about 20 million years. Our species, Homo sapiens sapiens, 
has been around for about 100,000 years. But, as I discuss throughout this book, 
humanity is so different from most other life forms — for an array of reasons — 
that this natural timescale doesn’t necessarily apply to it. Humanity has invented 
many ways to prevent itself from falling prey to the circumstances that cause 
other species to become extinct (and at the same time has invented many means 
of committing suicide, such as nuclear and biological weapons).
Yes, We Have No Bananas: 
Primate Subsistence
The previous sections give you a good idea of the origins and main groups of 
the primates; now take a look at some details or characteristics that can help 
to clarify where humanity fits in as one of many primate species. I begin with 
subsistence in this section; later sections cover locomotion, social groups, 
and behavior.
Subsistence refers to how an organism fulfills its need for food, water, and 
nutrients. All kinds of subsistence have evolved in nature, including carnivory 
(eating prey animals) and herbivory (eating plant matter). Most primates basi-
cally practice omnivory, meaning that they eat wide variety of foods.
 
Many anthropologists today believe that the most important factor driving the 
diversity of subsistence behavior in primates is food availability and distribu-
tion; that is, what’s the distribution of food in space, and how does that dis-
tribution vary with time? Because, like any species, primates have to eat, the 
extent to which their foods are available from season to season has important 
effects on their behavior and anatomy. Some common primate responses to 
seasonal changes in diet include switching to different food sources, increasing 
the time spent in search of food, and splitting the social group to spread out 
the resource demand. For example, studies show that in lean times, spectral tar-
siers (tiny, giant-eyed, super-cute Southeast Asian primates) spend more time 
traveling in search of food than they do in better times. This change affects all 
kinds of behavior, including conflict resulting from territorial disputes.
The following sections take a closer look at the actual diets processed by 
primates.

68
Part II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology
The indiscriminate-eaters: Omnivores
Although the following sections show some exceptions, most primates are 
rather omnivorous, eating a variety of foods from bird eggs to leaves to seeds 
and even grasses, insects, tree gum, and flowers. This is in pretty stark con-
trast to, say crocodiles, who eat meat (fish and any vertebrate that falls into 
the water), or zebras, who eat only vegetation (grass and shrubs). Those 
animals are dietary specialists; primates, generally speaking, are generalists. 
Chimpanzees, for example, eat lots of fruit, snack on termites, and occasion-
ally hunt down small monkeys; some monkeys savor bird eggs; and gorillas 
live in a giant salad bowl, eating just about whatever vegetation is in reach. 
This dietary diversity is reflected in the nature of our versatile mouth.
The average primate mouth reflects the order’s tendency toward omnivory in 
the teeth. We have several kinds of teeth:
 
 Incisors are the thin, blade-like teeth at the front of the mouth for snip-
ping and clipping.
 
 Canines are the pointed, conical teeth used for puncturing and light 
crushing; many primate species use these teeth to defend and threaten, 
so they’re much larger than in our species.
 
 Premolars are the somewhat-pointed-but-somewhat-jagged teeth imme-
diately before the molars, and they do the light crushing.
 
 Molars are the heavy, flattish teeth in the back of the mouth that do the 
heavy crushing.
You can see that this multitalented mouth can process just about any food, 
so primates generally fall into the category of heterodont (different-teeth) 
rather than homodont (same-teeth). Your dog and cat are homodont — both 
are carnivores (at least evolutionarily) — and omnivores, such as people and 
pigs, are heterodont.
 
Technically speaking, homodonty really means that all the teeth have the 
same form, as in crocodiles. Because dogs and cats (mentioned in the preced-
ing paragraph) do have differences between their incisors and molars, for 
example, they’re technically heterodont. However, relatively speaking, all their 
teeth are for processing a meat diet, so compared to primates (who eat a more 
varied diet), they’re considered homodont.
 
A trained anthropologist can learn an enormous amount from a single fossil 
tooth. Under a microscope, scratches and polishing, called dental microwear, 
can reveal how the jaws worked and even whether the diet was moist or dry. 
Knowing that it was moist or dry, in turn, can tell you something about the 
general conditions in which the animal survived. Extrapolations like these are 
used to reconstruct the lives of ancient species.

69
 Chapter 4: The Wildest Family Reunion: Meet the Primates
The bug-eaters: Insectivores
Insectivores eat a diet heavy in insects; this is where the primates began: as 
small early mammals eating small insects. Today, many primates eat a few 
insects — like the chimpanzees who fish termites out of their mounds by 
using twigs — but few focus their diet on insects, and even those who do still 
eat other foods such as tree gum and leaves. But for mouse lemurs and some 
other prosimians, insects may compose close to half the diet. The character-
istics of these insectivores include
 
 Generally very small size, normally under 100 grams (1/4 pound)
 
 A nocturnal lifestyle
 
 Sharp teeth for processing insect bodies
 
 An arboreal lifestyle
 
 A short and simple digestive tract
The insectivorous primates include the African bush baby or galago, a prosim-
ian that also eats tree gum. It has enormous ears and, unlike most primates, 
uses these rather than vision to locate its food sources. Weighing up to 5 kilo-
grams (about 10 pounds), the bush baby can leap as far as 4 meters (12 feet) 
at a time.
The leaf-eaters: Folivores
Folivorous primates focus on eating leaves but still get plenty of variety in 
most of their diets — they also eat fruit and seeds if they’re available. The 
red howler monkey of South America dines on nearly 200 different species 
of plants and apparently prefers eating younger rather than more mature 
leaves. The most folivorous primates are characterized by the following traits:
 
 Generally medium size (or large, compared to insectivores), averaging 5 
kilograms (10 pounds)
 
 A nocturnal lifestyle
 
 Mixed sharp and flat teeth for processing vegetation (snipping it with 
the incisors, shearing it with the premolars, and then crushing it with 
the molars)
 
 A long and complex digestive tract used to process vegetation

70
Part II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology
Leaves are hard to digest, so folivores’ guts are larger and more complex 
than those of many other primates; essentially, leaves ferment in primate 
stomachs. And because leaves don’t have a very high caloric content (rela-
tive to a lot of other potential foods), folivores eat a lot of them. (It takes a lot 
of leaves to make up a pound, which is about what some captive lemurs eat 
each day.) How the food is dispersed in the trees, what season it is, and how 
the animals get around are all linked in complex ways.
 
Folivorous primates have very specialized and sensitive innards for their 
unique diet. Zoos often have difficulty keeping folivores healthy because they 
can’t supply the proper kinds of leaves. Special feeding programs have to be 
established to properly care for folivores, such that keepers realize they’re 
not just feeding the primate but also the bacterial colony in the primate’s gut 
that ferments the leaves.
The fruit-eaters: Frugivores
The frugivores (fruit-eaters) focus on fruit, but they eat other things as well. 
Among the most frugivorous primates are the apes, and of these, the most 
fruit-obsessed are the orangutans, which devour large quantities of the cus-
tard-like durian fruit as well as the leaves, fruit, and seeds of nearly 400 other 
plant species. The frugivores have a sweet tooth, focusing on sugary plant 
products, and they display the following characteristics:
 
 Generally large size (compared to most primates), averaging over 10 
kilograms (20 pounds)
 
 A diurnal lifestyle, being active mainly at day
 
 Mixed sharp and flat teeth for processing vegetation (but sometimes 
with particularly large incisors for opening up tough-skinned fruit)
Of the more striking characteristics of the frugivores is their good memory. 
They’re very good about remembering just where good patches of fruit 
appear each year and therefore spend a little less time foraging in search of 
food than some other primates. This skill can have important (if currently 
unknown) effects on variables like the complexity of social interactions 
because they spend more time sitting, grooming, and feeding together than 
traveling in search of food.

 Chapter 4: The Wildest Family Reunion: Meet the Primates
Monkeying Around: Primate Locomotion
How primates locomote — get from place to place — is fascinating, and it can 
tell you a lot about how they live. Some leap from limb to limb, others swing 
like trapeze artists, and of course humans walk on two feet (unless you’re a 
pirate or something). I discuss the main types of locomotion in the following 
sections; they’re illustrated in Figure 4-5.
 
Figure 4-5: 
The main 
types of 
locomotion.
 
Brachiation
(Gibbon)
Bipedalism
(Human)
Terrestrial quadrupedalism
(Knuckle-walking gorilla)
Arboreal quadrupedalism
(Spider monkey)
Vertical clinging
and leaping
(Lemur)
Stand back, Tarzan: The brachiators
Brachiation is swinging from one hold (like a tree limb) to another, and the 
speed champion species here is the gibbon. Southeast Asian gibbons can 
swing through forest canopy at more than 30 miles per hour, about ten times 
as fast as most humans walk. Slower brachiators are the big, heavy orang-
utans, who hang, reach, and shift their body weight instead of really smoking 

72
Part II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology
through the canopy like the gibbons. Brachiators have several main anatomi-
cal characteristics:
 
 Long arms: The longer the muscle, the greater its power, so evolution 
has selected for longer and more powerful arms over time.
 
 Short, relatively weak legs: These animals don’t spend much time on 
the ground and really prefer to hang from their hands.
 
 Very powerful hands: These primates have strong, long fingers but very 
small thumbs; thumbs would get in the way of the hooking action used 
to grasp tree limbs and vines.
Bug-bashers: The vertical-
clingers-and-leapers
The vertical-clingers-and-leapers (VCLs) do just that: They hug tight to a tree 
trunk, with their spine vertical, until they’re ready to move, and then they 
twist at the waist and push off hard with their legs, leaping at their target. 
That target is often an insect, a juicy treat that makes up a large part of their 
diet. The VCLs include the tarsiers and the lemurs, both members of the pro-
simian group discussed earlier in the chapter. Their anatomical characteris-
tics include
 
 Short, weak arms because they propel with their legs
 
 Strong legs for powerful leaping
In the trees: Arboreal quadrupeds
Moving quadrupedally means moving on four legs or feet, and it’s how many 
monkey species get around. It involves using both the hands and feet to 
grasp relatively horizontal tree limbs, which they walk on with great skill and 
a seemingly daredevil attitude. But evolution has shaped their instincts and 
abilities, and although accidents happen, they’re infrequent enough not to 
have extinguished this kind of locomotion. The arboreal quadrupeds have 
the following anatomical characteristics:
 
 Strong arms and legs.
 
 Relatively low body weight (most of them).

73
 Chapter 4: The Wildest Family Reunion: Meet the Primates
 
 A divergent big toe, such that their feet look much like our hands, with 
the big toe sticking off to the side; this allows the feet to be used like 
hands, to grasp tree limbs.
 
 A prominent tail (in most species) used as a balance; one kind of pri-
mate, the spider monkey, has a prehensile tail that can be carefully con-
trolled to wrap around objects and hold them, just like a hand.
Soldiers beware: Terrestrial quadrupeds
The terrestrial quadrupeds get around on all fours, but on the ground rather 
than habitually in the trees. These animals include the baboons, which live 
in large, complex social groups (troops) and can be fearsome to humans. 
One troop in South Africa particularly disliked one turn-of-the-century British 
officer and regularly pelted him — and only him — whenever they saw him 
marching his own troops! The terrestrial quadrupeds have the following 
attributes:
 
 Moderately strong arms and legs
 
 Lack of massive upper- or lower-body build for either brachiating or 
clinging-and-leaping
 
 Calloused feet, hands, and buttocks from spending so much time on the 
ground
Technically, the chimps and gorillas mix things up a little: They spend a lot of 
time on the ground, so they’re officially terrestrial quadrupeds, but they have 
the bodies of arboreal quadrupeds because they’ve only recently (in evolu-
tionary time) come down from the trees in a substantial way. They have one 
important distinguishing characteristic: heavily built, locking knuckles that 
allow the heavy upper body to be supported with the knuckles of the hands 
by pressing down on the ground.
Other primates do some locomotor mixing as well. Bonobos, a kind of West 
African chimpanzee, are terrestrial quadrupeds, but they also spend some 
time brachiating and even walking on two legs. This walking is different than 
human walking, though, because the bonobos only do it on occasion, which 
is called opportunistic locomotion. Humans walk habitually, meaning their 
anatomy is adapted for this kind of locomotion.

74
Part II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology
A group of one: Bipeds
Although many primates occasionally stand up to walk on two feet (and one 
gorilla in West Africa has even been observed to use a walking stick to cross 
a swampy patch of ground), they do so on occasion rather than habitually. 
Of the living primates, only Homo sapiens sapiens walks on two legs; I discuss 
why that’s a fascinating question in Chapter 6. For the moment, take a look at 
the main anatomical characteristics of bipedal primates:
 
 Relatively long, strong legs
 
 An S-shaped spinal column that acts as a spring to absorb stresses
 
 A wide pelvis that keeps the thighs somewhat apart, helping balance
 
 A parallel big toe lined up with the rest of the toes (rather than the 
divergent big toe used by other primates to grasp tree limbs)
The great women of great ape studies
A great deal of what anthropology currently 
knows about the apes has come from long-
term field studies carried out by some remark-
able women. Jane Goodall began as a student 
of anthropologist Louis Leakey, who encour-
aged her to study the chimpanzees to better 
understand humanity. She did and for 45 years 
has observed these primates in great detail at a 
research station at Gombe, Tanzania. Recently 
Goodall has shifted from studying the chimpan-
zees to advocating for protection of chimpan-
zee habitat; like the other apes, the chimpanzee 
is endangered.
Another great ape, the orangutan of Borneo, has 
been studied for more than 30 years by Biruté 
Galdikas of Canada’s Simon Fraser University. 
Like Goodall, today Galdikas argues forcefully 
for protection of orangutan habitat, which is 
being deforested at an alarming rate; some esti-
mate that the orangutan will be extinct by 2012. 
Dian Fossey (who, like Galdikas and Goodall, 
was also inspired by Louis Leakey) studied 
gorillas for nearly three decades, but she was 
murdered under mysterious circumstances in 
1985, and today the gorilla is also becoming 
extinct, facing the deforestation of its habitat as 
well as a threat from the Ebola virus. For more 
on the extinction of primates, see the section 
“Primates Today (But For How Long?)” later in 
the chapter.
One of the most important things these women 
did was to study apes in the wild — not in zoos; 
you can imagine how different ape behav-
ior would be in these situations. Remember, 
though, that even the observer’s presence 
would effect ape behavior, so rather than saying 
they were observing wild apes, anthropologists 
say they were studying habituated apes, apes 
that were accustomed to seeing human observ-
ers. Exactly what effects the observers have on 
ape behavior in non-zoo settings is debatable, 
but it’s very likely to be more “natural” than zoo 
behavior.

 Thighs that angle inward toward the knees and down from the pelvis, 
also assisting balance
 
 Lateral and transverse arches built into the foot so that we aren’t flat-
footed but supported by three main points of contact (the heel and 
under the big and small toes) in a stable, tripod-like structure
 
Humans aren’t the only species ever to evolve bipedalism; kangaroos are 
another, and, given enough time and the right circumstances, bipedalism 
could easily evolve again, perhaps in the African meerkats, who spend a lot of 
time standing on their hind legs. But among the primates, humans are the only 
living habitual bipeds. As Chapter 6 shows, though, other primates did evolve 
bipedalism and used to be quite numerous between about six million and two 
million years ago.
Monkey See, Monkey Do: Primate 
Social Groups and Behavior
Primates are very social creatures, and although other social mammals (like 
zebras) live in groups, primate social groups are extremely complex, with 
elaborate rank hierarchies and codes of conduct. Anthropologist Franz de 
Waal even called one book about chimpanzee behavior Chimpanzee Politics. 
Primate groups are also usually (but not always) quite large; baboon troops 
can have up to 300 members.
 
Keep in mind that social behavior can depend on group size, which can in turn 
depend on variables such as whether the species is nocturnal or diurnal, what 
kind of foods it focuses on, what its local environment is like, and so on. The 
complex interplay between these variables is, I think, just being understood 
by anthropologists, who have spent much of the last few decades simply 
observing, understanding, and then describing (rather than comprehensively 
explaining) the variety of primate social behaviors.
Primates live in large, complex groups for three main reasons:
 
 Protection from predators (protection in numbers): Predators can be 
put off by large, noisy, and dangerous groups of primates (like troops of 
baboons), and in a large group, one individual member is less likely to 
become lunch for a big snake or eagle.

76
Part II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology
 
 Greater access to food: Larger groups who inhabit areas where food is 
distributed unevenly in the forest are more likely to find food patches 
because they have more eyes looking.
 
 Raising offspring: Primates reproduce not by having vast numbers of 
offspring (like fish or frogs) but by having relatively few offspring that 
require a lot of care, both to protect them from predators and to teach 
the babies to socialize.
The following list describes the four main kinds of primate social groups:
 
 Loners: This kind of social organization is called noyau. Only the noc-
turnal primates (like some of the prosimians discussed earlier in the 
chapter) and the orangutan have evolved noyau, in which males wander 
alone, staying with mates only long enough to mate. Females are also 
solitary, unless they have young, which they carry as they move around.
 
 Families: Humans love families (or the idea of families) so much that 
we’ve been watching the Simpsons — Marge, Homer, Bart, Lisa, and 
Maggie — for 20 years (and they’re only one of a gazillion fictional fami-
lies shown on television for the past 50 years); we’ve probably been tell-
ing stories about human families as far back as anyone can remember. 
Is that a threat?
Primate social behavior isn’t always sweet-
ness and light. Like many animals, primates 
often threaten one another, but coming to 
actual physical blows is rare; it’s just too risky. 
A better tactic is to bluff, and plenty of that 
goes on: chimpanzees scream, throw sticks, 
beat on their chests, and bare their teeth all in 
an effort to intimidate — and it works. Over the 
eons, intense competition among primates has 
favored those with large, intimidating canines; 
the baboons’ teeth can be knife-like and partic-
ularly scary. Among humans, most threats and 
displays of prowess are accomplished verbally 
or with objects that show our rank, and so the 
pressure for especially big canines has lifted. 
This pattern seems to go back at least 2 million 
years, where fossil evidence indicates that our 
early ancestors’ canines aren’t as large as they 
are in most primate species.

77
 Chapter 4: The Wildest Family Reunion: Meet the Primates
In the primate order, monogamous families of a mated male and female 
with their offspring pop up among some gibbons and other kinds, but 
monogamy is actually quite rare in the primate order outside the human 
species.
 
 Troops: Troops are multi-male, multi-female groups that contain no 
stable, long-term male-female mating relationships; males and females 
each have several mates. This situation is most common among the 
semi-terrestrial primates, whose groups may number into the low hun-
dreds. These troops’ large numbers protect them from the big, terres-
trial predators like leopards and lions and can help in finding food by 
sending scouts out on reconnaissance treks.
 
 Harems: Groups that contain a single male, several females, and their 
offspring are known as polygynous groups or harems. Gorillas live this 
way; silverbacks, the dominant males, typically kick out male youngsters 
that are starting to come up in the ranks. They sometimes tolerate pow-
erful young males for a while, but in the end the young guys normally 
have to leave. When they do, they have to find another group, defeat its 
silverback, and live to be the dominant male. It’s not an easy life.
Just when you have a handle on primate characteristics and behavior, 
another unusual situation arises. In this case, it’s polyandry, the social pat-
tern among nonhuman primates in which a single female has several male 
mates. This tendency is only found among the tiny, nocturnal, insect-eating 
marmosets and tamarinds.
Primates Today (But For How Long?)
The living primates — anywhere between 233 and 290 species, depending on 
whom you talk to — are widely distributed from South America to Africa to 
Japan. (Figure 4-6 shows this distribution.) Most are found in the tropics or 
semi-tropics (within 1,500 miles north or south of the equator). New species 
still occasionally surface — for example, the sideburn-sporting titi monkeys 
of South America (found in 2002) and two new lemur species found in 2005 
in Madagascar. Some species are flourishing in large wilderness areas, but 
development is steadily reducing and fragmenting these regions.

In 1996, the World Conservation Union reported on the many threats to pri-
mate species, and in 2003 they revealed that about half of the more than 200 
primate species were under severe threat. The situation hasn’t gotten any 
better since that report. In October 2007, the International Primatological 
Society and Conservation International copublished a list of the 25 most 
threatened and endangered primate species. Astonishingly, these groups 
include chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and some kinds of gibbons; essen-
tially, aside from humans, all the great apes are facing extinction. Maybe we 
should be more ashamed than astonished, though; conservationists have 
been telling us for 30 years that these and other species were in trouble. But 
even pointing out that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with most of 
these species hasn’t reduced the threats to our closest living relatives. These 
threats include
 
 Habitat destruction from logging, particularly in Southeast Asia and 
Borneo, home of the orangutan
 
 Habitat destruction from agriculture, particularly in the African Congo, 
where farms are encroaching on gorilla habitat
 
 Poaching, much of it for meat, some of which sells for spectacular prices 
on the African “bush meat” market
Any conscientious anthropologist today will tell you that for the threatened 
and endangered species, right now research priorities must include conser-
vation effort. If the species aren’t preserved, how can you find out about our 
species from them? And if humans let our closest living relatives go extinct 
without a real fight, what does that say about us?

79
 Chapter 4: The Wildest Family Reunion: Meet the Primates
Chimpanzees and people
One reason people may feel ambivalent about 
the fate of chimpanzees — and, by extension, 
other endangered primates — is that for a 
long time Western civilization has looked on 
the chimpanzee with suspicion, hatred, fear, 
and disgust. Medieval sculptures depict chim-
panzees as gargoyle-like winged devils; in the 
Victorian era, captive chimpanzees disgusted 
many Londoners, who believed that the chim-
panzee was a species locked in time, a throw-
back to a disgusting, primordial past. Of course, 
the Victorians were wrong: Chimpanzees are 
here in the present and have evolved for as long 
as we have. That they didn’t evolve the kinds 
of language and culture of modern humans is 
neither here nor there; each species adapts in 
its own way, and cross-species comparisons 
of this kind are pointless. Today, despite know-
ing that most of our DNA is identical to that of 
the chimpanzee, chimps are still dressed up for 
commercials and movies and essentially looked 
on as comical quasi-humans. But some scien-
tists feel that, due to chimpanzees’ genetic and 
anatomical similarities to humanity, the chim-
panzee genus — Pan — should be dissolved, 
and chimpanzees brought into our genus, 
Homo.

H
umanity, like any other form of life, didn’t just pop up out of nowhere. 
Our species evolved from earlier forms of life over vast stretches of 
time. Just as you ask a new acquaintance where they come from, how long 
they’ve lived in a certain city, or about their family history, anthropologists 
recognize that things in the world today have roots — a past — and that 
knowing about that past is important to understanding the present. To learn 
about the human past, anthropologists invented a specialized field of study, 
archaeology: the study (-ology) of the ancient (archae-).
Archaeology is one of the four main subdivisions of the larger field of anthro-
pology. Archaeologists, therefore, are anthropologists, even if they human-
ity they study is ancient. Chapter 3 introduces all four of the main fields of 
anthropology.
Everyone’s favorite archaeologist, of course, is Indiana Jones; whether he’s 
in tweeds at his university office or crashing through a jungle with loot under 
his arm, everyone thinks, “There, that’s archaeology.” But the truth is that 
archaeology is a slow and meticulous business — so slow, in fact, that to all 

82
Part II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology
but the professionals, watching either field excavations or lab analyses can 
be boring with a capital B.
What’s archaeology really about, then? Why do archaeologists go so slowly, 
meticulously flicking dirt from a broken, thousand-year-old pot? Why do they 
get excited when they find ancient garbage heaps or even ancient outhouses? 
How can something as fascinating as investigating our species’ family history 
be turned into something as boring as sieving dirt through a mesh filter? The 
answer, of course, is that it’s not boring; it’s just slower than a Hollywood 
blockbuster.
In this chapter, you discover why archaeologists obsess about knowing 
how old artifacts are and precisely where they come from, and you see how 
archaeologists think and classify what they find to rebuild humanity’s past 
from a million artifacts — like chips of stone, glass, pottery — lost or dis-
carded by our ancestors. All this information will give you a good apprecia-
tion for understanding how archaeologists piece together the human past.
What, How Old, and Where: 
It’s All You Need to Know
Somewhere near the end of my four-hour oral PhD examination, something 
clicked in my mind. It was something I’d been learning for years, and it 
finally crystallized in a single statement. All I’d done, over eight years of PhD 
research and five years for my master’s, was document how many (of certain 
kinds of artifacts) were found in certain places, at certain times. That was it! 
Of course, I’d gone on to analyze what was found where, to try to answer 
questions about how people lived in the past, but really the most important 
goal for archaeologists was to know what kinds of artifacts (objects made 
by ancient people) were found in certain places at certain times. That’s the 
essence of archaeology.
 
Artifacts are objects used or made by humans; fossils are relics of ancient 
bones, described in more detail in Chapter 6. Artifacts are often assigned 
to time periods in the same way as fossils, but — as you discover in this 
chapter — some techniques of dating artifacts don’t work for fossils.
The significance of where
Archaeologists have to dig carefully if they want a good representation of 
what people did in the ancient world. They have to keep track of where they 

83
 Chapter 5: My Career Is in Ruins: How Anthropologists Learn about the Past
find artifacts. Why is where so important? Because humans do different tasks 
in different places. They use some places for ritual (like churches), some 
places for commerce (markets and malls), some for privacy (the home and 
areas within it), and so on. And because they make and use so many objects 
to survive, those objects tend to reflect what’s going on in those different 
spaces. If a terrible calamity flattened my home this instant, the archaeolo-
gist of 5,000 AD would find my computer by my window, my SCUBA gear over 
in a closest, my subsistence items over by the kitchen, and so on. Careful 
excavation could reveal a lot about my life. Digging haphazardly, though, 
may mix the things from my apartment with items from next door (making 
my occupation difficult to discern from my neighbors’); it may mix my cook-
books with my research library, even though in my life the two kinds of 
books have very different purposes. I don’t research cooking, I research the 
ancient world, and that’s reflected in my keeping different kinds of books in 
different places.
 
The places where archaeologists find artifacts are archaeological sites (not 
sights). A site can be as simple as a scatter of stone chips by the remains of 
a campfire — where a hunter resharpened a stone tool and had a bite to eat 
9,000 years ago — or as complex as the whole ancient city of Tenochtitlan, the 
Aztec capital now largely buried by Mexico City.
The significance of when
When is important because humanity has changed through time: Our bodies 
have changed, but so have our behaviors, the things we do. And because 
humans survive by using artifacts like spears or dog sleds, those objects 
reveal what ancient people were doing across time. For example, consumers 
used to receive music on vinyl discs, then on cassette tapes, then on CDs, 
and now as MP3 files on electronic players. The change in these music-
delivery artifacts will someday tell a future archaeologist a lot about how our 
society changed through time. In the same way, today’s archaeologists care-
fully investigate how ancient cultures’ artifacts changed through time.
The significance of artifacts
So, how do archaeologists reassemble the artifacts that reflect ancient lives? 
Very carefully. Archaeology studies three main kinds of traces of life in the 
past:

84
Part II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology
 
 Artifacts are items that humanity has moved, used, or made. (In this 
context, humanity applies to modern humans as well as all our ancestors 
back to around 2 million years ago.)
 
 Features are traces of human activity that you can’t easily transport to 
a laboratory, such as a stain in the ground where a wooden post once 
stood.
 
 Sites are clusters of artifacts and/or features, ranging in size from a cave 
dwelling as big as a two-car garage to the entire ancient city of Babylon.
 
Archaeologists also study a wide range of other topics related to life in the 
ancient world; for instance, archaeozoologists study animal bones (such as the 
remains of ancient meals), and archaeobotanists study ancient plant remains 
(such as core samples of ancient pollen), to see how plant life, and therefore 
ancient climates, changed through time. These professions are special sub-
fields of archaeology, and at most archaeological sites, excavators collect and 
document bones and plant matter in addition to artifacts and features.
The Pompeii premise and the study of taphonomy
The first hundred years of archaeology mainly 
dealt with documenting obvious traces of 
ancient human life, like the Parthenon or Maya 
temples. But as it became clear that humanity 
had a vast, 2-million-year history, archaeologists 
started to look for (and find) less-visible traces 
of prehistoric humanity. By digging very care-
fully, prehistorians found ancient campsites and 
even cave dwellings. Many times, they found 
these sites in layers, one stacked on another as 
one hunting band moved on and another later 
camped in the same place. By studying how the 
artifacts changed through time, archaeologists 
reasoned, they could understand how human 
behavior changed over time.
This conclusion was correct in theory, but 
researchers started to discover complications. 
At some sites, for example, rodents or flow-
ing water had disturbed the ancient campsite 
remains, moving artifacts after ancient people 
left them behind but before archaeologists 
excavated them. This deviation was a problem 
because if artifacts were moved vertically, for 
example, from one layer to another, archae-
ologists may assign them to very different time 
periods. The Pompeii premise — the idea that 
archaeological sites were perfect, unchanged 
reflections of the past (like at the well-pre-
served Roman town of Pompeii, buried in ash 
that captured the bodies of fleeing people in 79 
AD) — was rejected. Now archaeologists had 
to prove that their sites were well-preserved 
and undisturbed rather than assume it.
To establish this proof, archaeologists started 
a new research field: the study of taphonomy, 
or how archaeological sites are formed in the 
past and transformed by water, wind, rodent 
activity, frost action on soil, and every other 
conceivable factor. Only after understanding 
how an archaeological site has been formed 
and transformed before excavators arrived 
can archaeologists really learn about the past. 
Many sites have been so severely transformed 
that archaeologists pass them up in favor of 
less-disturbed sites.

85
 Chapter 5: My Career Is in Ruins: How Anthropologists Learn about the Past
Artifacts, then, are concrete items that people used in the past. Archaeologists 
excavate them carefully to keep from breaking them and note exactly where 
they came from. The artifacts are then typically bagged up, given a catalog 
number, and transported back to a lab for future analysis. Examples of arti-
facts include stone tools such as arrowheads or hand axes; these are very 
common because humanity has used stone for millions of years, and 
it doesn’t decay quickly. Archaeologists document features in the field by 
using drawings and photography, but features are nearly impossible to take 
back to the lab. In fact, after the archaeologists document features, they typi-
cally just continue to excavate through them. Examples of features include 
hearths — piles of ash, burnt rock, and perhaps some charred bone or other 
remains of ancient cooking.
By keeping careful track of where artifacts and features are found at archaeo-
logical sites, archaeologists can identify patterns of life in the ancient world. 
Comparing the food refuse (like cast-aside bones from cuts of meat) associ-
ated with slave owners’ houses, for example, with the food refuse associated 
with slave dwellings, archaeologists can reconstruct how these peoples’ diets 
differed. Of course, circumstances change through time, so archaeologists 
also keep careful track of how old certain artifacts and features are.
Keeping Time: How Archaeologists 
Date Finds
Archaeologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler once said that chronology — the study 
of time — is the backbone of archaeology. Not the whole skeleton, but noth-
ing less than the backbone. He was right. A pile of artifacts haphazardly dug 
from a cave — where 10,000 years of continuous occupation left behind hun-
dreds of thousands of artifacts and features — would be little use to anyone; 
without knowing whether certain artifacts came from the oldest layers or the 
most recent, archaeologists are at a loss to understand how the ancient soci-
ety changed through time. So the study of time is the backbone of archaeol-
ogy, and archaeologists keep track of time with a number of methods.
The deeper, the older: Stratigraphy
Almost every place ancient people lived has been covered by some kind of 
geological layer. For example, the city of Pompeii was buried by dozens of 
feet of volcanic ash; the Pacific Northwest Coast native village of Ozette was 
buried by a mudslide; and remnants of Harappan civilization were buried by 
sediments laid down by thousands of years of Indus River overflow.

86
Part II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology
This constant process of burial is very handy for archaeologists because it 
preserves archaeological sites. Two principles help understand why it’s so 
important:
 
 Uniformitarianism indicates that the geological phenomena burying 
landscapes today (like landslides or ash layers) operated in the same 
way in the past. The laws of physics haven’t changed appreciably since 
the formation of the Earth.
 
 Superposition shows that, all other factors being equal, items found 
deeper in a series of geological layers were deposited (laid down in 
that layer) before items found shallower in the series of layer, simply 
because layers stack up over time. These stacks of layers are strati-
graphic sequences, the individual layers of which are strata.
Basically, the principle of superposition is the deeper, the older. Remember, 
though, that not all archaeological sites are pristine; tomb-raiders, burrowing 
rodents, and even earthworms and other factors can and do move artifacts 
from one layer to another. (See the sidebar “The Pompeii premise and the 
study of taphonomy” for more information.) Still, archaeologists are trained 
to spot the signs of such disturbance and usually focus their studies on 
undisturbed sites, where deeper really does mean older. Considering that 
(stop me if you’ve heard this one) human behavior has changed through time 
and that change is of great interest to archaeologists, you can see just how 
important understanding stratification is. Figure 5-1 shows a student stand-
ing with over 3 meters (12 feet) of strata at one of my excavation sites in the 
Pacific Northwest.

 Chapter 5: My Career Is in Ruins: How Anthropologists Learn about the Past
Before or after? Relative dating
Although today archaeologists can date artifacts and features with a wide 
array of methods (which I discuss later), for a long time it was only pos-
sible to do relative dating, or identifying whether artifacts or features were 
older or younger than other artifacts. That’s because archaeologists didn’t 
have the technical methods to date individual artifacts; they could only 
identify whether artifacts came from lower or higher strata in a stratigraphic 
sequence. Remember, in an undisturbed stratigraphic sequence, lower strata 
are older, and higher strata are more recent.
Relative dating allowed archaeologists to sketch out basic sequences, but not 
date them very precisely. For example, the 19th-century Danish prehistorian 
Christian Thompsen noted that in the prehistoric strata of Europe, stone 
tools were found at the lowest (earliest) strata, bronze tools above these, and 
iron tools above these. He devised the three-age system in which the ancient 
world was divided into the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. This 
division was very useful but a little incomplete: No one could say just how 
long the Stone Age lasted, for example; prehistorians knew only that it came 
first, because it was lowest in the strata.
 
European prehistorians still use the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages to some 
extent, but these designations serve more for general discussion than detailed 
understanding. For example, subsequent ages continued to use stone, and 
although the Iron Age began in southeastern Europe around 2,500 years ago, 
it took centuries to reach northern Europe. Also, these ages focus on the raw 
materials from which artifacts were made but don’t reflect other, important 
aspects of ancient life like subsistence, symbolism, or religion. So although 
they’re a part of the story, they don’t tell everything.
Absolutely probably 6,344 years old (plus 
or minus): Radiometric absolute dating
By the 1950s, methods to date individual artifacts based on radioactive decay 
began to give precise dates for such time periods as Thompsen’s ages (see 
the preceding section). These dates are termed absolute because they specify 
when a certain event occurred (such as the death of a tree or animal, or 
the solidification of lava into rock) as opposed to the relative dates of prior 
archaeologists, which only indicated that an item was older or younger than 
some event.
Radiometric dates are based on the decay of certain elements contained in 
artifacts and features. Many different radiometric methods can date various 

88
Part II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology
materials to different date ranges. The following list shows two of the most 
important techniques for archaeology:
 
 Radiocarbon dating dates the remains of most living things, including 
bone, plant matter, and wood; it’s useful to about 50,000 years ago.
 
 K-Ar dating calculates the age of basaltic rocks starting about 100,000 
years old and reaching back into the billions of years; it’s particularly 
important to the dating of early hominid sites, such as Olduvai Gorge.
The most commonly used method in archaeology is radiocarbon or carbon 14 
dating (also known as 14C dating).
Radiocarbon dating
By measuring how much carbon is in the remains of a once-living thing, sci-
entists can know how long it’s been since the original 14C began to decay — in 
other words, when the living thing died. All living things ingest the element 
carbon in the form of its isotope carbon 14 (14C), which floats freely in 
the atmosphere and is present in all foods. When a life form stops ingest-
ing 14C (when it, you know, dies), no new 14C enters the body, and the 14C 
in the body begins to radioactively decay into 14N (nitrogen isotope 14). 
Importantly, 14C decays into 14N at a known and pretty stable rate: After 
about 5,600 years, only half of the original 14C remains because the rest has 
decayed into 14N.
 
Archaeologists mark the passage of time in many different ways. BP stands 
for before present, which basically means “years ago.” BC (before Christ) is 
more commonly used in Europe and other areas that have historical records 
going back thousands of years, to around the time of Christ. So as not to favor 
the Christian religion, some archaeologists say BCE (before the Common Era) 
rather than BC. But this designation still points back to the time of Christ and 
is a little over the top in my view. Just because I use the term BC doesn’t mean 
I’m pushing religion. Other common terms are kya (thousands of years ago) 
and mya (millions of years ago).
K-Ar dating
Another kind of radiometric dating works on objects that never lived, such 
as lava. The rock called basalt is, basically, cooled lava. As a liquid, the lava 
contains potassium (K), which, when the rock cools and hardens, begins to 
decay into argon (Ar). Thus, K-Ar dating measures how much Ar an object 
has in relation to K, indicating how long ago the lava cooled (because Ar is 
able to escape liquid lava as gas bubbles until the lava cools and traps it in 
the rock).
Dating rock layers allows the sediments between them to be bracketed in age. 
For example, if a lava flow solidifies at 2.2 million years ago, and then a lake 

89
 Chapter 5: My Career Is in Ruins: How Anthropologists Learn about the Past
forms over it and deposits many layers of silt before it dries up and is capped 
by another flow of lava at 1.7 million years ago, geologists could reasonably 
state that the silty lake layers bracketed between the lavas were deposited 
between 2.2 and 1.7 million years ago. Artifacts or fossils found in these silty 
strata, for example from a band of hominids that camped on the lakeshore, 
would be dated to the same general period.
Issues with radiometric dating
One minor hitch with radiometric dates: Although the radioactive decay 
rates are well known and pretty stable, lab observation reveals that decay 
is a little faster at some times than at others. Because of this discrepancy, a 
date of, say, 6,344 years since a piece of wood stopped taking on 14C has an 
attached error factor. Therefore, a radiometric date of 6,344 years may be 
followed by “+/- 650 years.” This variation is why the title of this section is 
“Absolutely probably 6,344 years old.”
The need for an error factor doesn’t mean that radiometric methods don’t 
work, only that archaeologists need to get several dates from each sample to 
be sure all dates point at about the same time range. The best way to ensure 
that your dates are good is to get multiple 14C dates and then back them up 
through independent means, such as relative dating or other radiometric 
methods, to be sure all is in order. Still, you can’t get around the fact that 
radiometric dates always come with an error margin. The fact that this, and 
some other, corrections and adjustments need to be considered with radio-
metric dates doesn’t undermine their use. They’ve been central to giving 
archaeologists a better understanding of the past, and each method contin-
ues to be refined. For example, labs often date items of a known age, such 
as bone from a burial of a known date, to be sure of their methods and 
equipment.
Don’t worry — radiometric dating is very secure. And archaeologists them-
selves are the first to point out any problems with the method; their studies 
demand a good understanding of the passage of time.
Many people, having heard about error factors associated with radiometric 
dates, think they shouldn’t trust the methods. But certainty of dates can 
come from many sources. One way is to send your radiocarbon samples to 
different labs; I may send samples to radiocarbon labs in Canberra, Australia; 
Davis, California; and Oxford, England. For about $500 per sample date, each 
lab will send me their radiocarbon date of the sample. Now, remember, I 
haven’t told them what date I expect (the dated material could be 500 or 
5,000 or 50,000 years old), and I haven’t told the different labs who else I’m 
sending the material to, so I don’t get some conspiracy to send me a particu-
lar date. What happens? Normally — barring some kind of contamination or 
other problem — the dates come back essentially the same, and I know the 
method is secure.

Saving Space: How Archaeologists Keep 
Track of Where Artifacts Are Found
The preceding section discusses how archaeologists keep track of time, the 
backbone of archaeology; now you need to understand how they keep track 
of where artifacts come from. Together, these two variables tell archaeolo-
gists much of what they need to know: how much, of what kinds of artifacts, 
are found in certain places at certain times?
Be there: Provenience
Every year or so a well-meaning person arrives at my office with artifacts 
he or she has found outdoors — stone arrowheads, bits of pottery, and so 
on — and wants to know what these pieces represent, how old they are, and 
who used them in the ancient world. My first question is always to ask where 
the artifacts came from, but unfortunately the answer is normally too vague. 
As I discuss earlier in the chapter, knowing which layer an item came from is 
vitally important because layers stack up over time; a few centimeters may 
mean a difference of thousands of years. If the item was dug from the ground 
without carefully recording the various strata, I have no way of knowing 
whether it came from layers 10,000 years old or 1,000 years old. And where it 
came from in the site horizontally is also critical: If the site was a cemetery, 
for example, I need to know whether it came from a peasant’s burial or a 
royal burial. That distinction could tell archaeologists about the differences 
between the lives of peasants and royalty. However well-meaning my visitors 
are, I often have to tell them that without such detailed information the item 
is just a curio and can’t tell us nearly as much as we’d learn if we had precise 
records.
When the importance of location began to sink in for archaeologists in the 
late 19th century, they invented methods to keep very careful track of prove-
nience, which is a precise record of where artifacts are found. Archaeologists 
measure provenience in two dimensions: vertical (basically, indicating time) 
and horizontal. Provenience is tracked in relation to a datum, or a known 
point established at the beginning of the excavation. The datum is normally 
a known, immovable spot, such as a surveyor’s benchmark (like a metal stud 
drilled into a rock so it won’t budge over time) that has a precisely known 
elevation, latitude, and longitude.

Be square: Site grids
Knowing exactly where an artifact comes from down to the centimeter allows 
archaeologists to make precise three-dimensional maps of the distribu-
tion of artifacts and features at an archaeological site. This mapping is very 
easy; archaeology may take a long time, but it’s not that technically difficult. 
Essentially, archaeologists excavate in square holes and regular trenches, not 
because they look better than shoveled potholes but because by laying out a 
datum — and from it a site grid (a grid of reference points and lines superim-
posed on the site) — they can keep better track of just where artifacts were 
found, right down to the centimeter. (Note: Like most scientists, archaeolo-
gists normally use the metric system [centimeters, meters, grams, and kilo-
grams] for all measurements; only the oldest records report their findings in 
imperial measures [feet, inches, pounds and ounces].) Figure 5-2 shows exca-
vators working with a site grid.

How do archaeologists find sites in the first place? Many sites are discovered 
accidentally by the kind of interested, well-meaning people who bring fasci-
nating curios to my office. After the initial find, though, the person needs to 
lay out a grid and excavate carefully. Sometimes archaeologists find sites by 
going into the field with a research question in mind; for example, “Where was 
the first farming practiced?” This is a big question, but it still allows excava-
tors to narrow down the field somewhat by eliminating some possibilities. 

92
Part II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology
Archaeologists largely find sites by systematically searching vast areas in 
order to answer certain specific questions and then excavate them with the 
care described in this chapter.
Type Casting: How Archaeologists 
Classify Their Finds
After archaeologists slowly, tediously, and delicately excavate artifacts from 
sites with tools like whisk brooms, toothbrushes, and even chopsticks when 
they’re appropriate, the artifacts go to a lab for cleaning, preservation, and 
further study. Because archaeologists are trying to reconstruct ancient worlds 
and ways of life with only fragments to work with, they’re very careful to 
extract every possible shred of information from any given find. Personally, 
I’ve lost count of the hundreds of hours I’ve spent peering down a microscope 
to document the tiny chips, abrasions, and polishes found on the edges of 
ancient stone tools that can tell me exactly what the tools were used for.
Types of types: The theory of classification
One of the first tasks is to classify artifacts — that is, to order them into types 
that reflect something of interest. Archaeologists classify objects according 
to their research paradigm, or research framework; the research paradigm 
depends on the questions the archaeologist is trying to answer. At the core 
of classification theory is the fact that you can classify nearly any object 
in many different ways. You can classify a Greek wine jar as “large” if your 
interest is in the history of the volume of Greek wine jars (maybe because 
it can tell you about wine consumption in ancient Greece). But if you were 
interested in the evolution of Greek jar-painting, you may classify the same 
jar as “decorated with animal figures” as opposed to “decorated with human 
figures”; in this case, volume may be irrelevant. If your interest is in the evo-
lution of projectile point size through time, you focus on size measurements 
rather than other possible variables, such as the color of the stone used to 
make the arrowheads.
 
Just because research questions differ among archaeologists doesn’t mean 
that they use absolutely no standardization; to make cross-site comparisons 
possible, for example, archaeologists of various regions do to an extent stan-
dardize their artifact classes and measurements. And, in some cases, world-
wide standards are accepted. This global standardization is especially true 
of many kinds of stone tools or pottery because different cultures worldwide 
have in fact devised the same methods, across time, to make the same kinds 
of tools (like stone scrapers or pottery jugs).

 Chapter 5: My Career Is in Ruins: How Anthropologists Learn about the Past
Unearthing the most common 
artifact types
Luckily for archaeologists, people of the ancient world left traces of their 
passing across the globe. From massive garbage mounds to entire buried 
libraries, ancient battlefields, hunting camps, and cave dwellings, traces of 
our ancestors are just about anywhere you care to look. Of course, not every-
thing has survived the eons; fragile items, like papyrus scrolls or wooden 
boxes, don’t normally preserve. So if archaeologists are trying to rebuild a 
puzzle of life in the past, remember that in most cases, archaeologists aren’t 
even equipped with every piece of the puzzle from the start.
But many pieces do remain — enough to tell a lot about the human past. 
They include items made from the three most common materials used in the 
ancient world: stone, bone and/or antler, and pottery. The following sections 
deal with each of these materials in more detail
 
The nature of an artifact’s composition and environment determine its preser-
vation. Wooden ship beams sunk in the Mediterranean, for example, are eaten 
up by woodworms so that only ballast stones and cargo remain. On the other 
hand, at some wet sites, where the oxygen is so scarce that bacteria can’t 
survive, even delicate tissues can survive for thousands of years. In the bogs 
(wetlands) of northern Europe, for example, bodies dating over two thousand 
years seem to turn up every few years. My personal hope is to find a frozen 
Neanderthal somewhere in the Siberian tundra!
The illusion of finished tools
The moment you pick up an artifact like a stone 
tool, it’s easy to start wondering what its pur-
pose was. Sometimes that seems obvious; it 
fits nicely in the hand and seems the right size 
and weight for some task you may imagine, like 
whittling wood or butchering an animal.
But you have to remember that appearances 
may be deceptive; what if the item you’re look-
ing at isn’t a finished tool after all, but just a 
chunk of rock that’s only been flaked a few 
times without being completed? Or what if the 
item has been used so much that its working 
edge has been worn away, so that you can 
never really understand the original function?
Archaeologist Harold Dibble pointed this con-
cept out in a famous study of tools from Stone 
Age Europe. He showed that as large knives 
were sharpened over time (their uselife), their 
shape changed dramatically; what most people 
considered two different kinds of tools were 
actually pieces of the same kind of tool that 
changed shape through its uselife. Food for 
thought.

94
Part II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology
Stone
Humans and their earliest ancestors have shaped stone into tools for millions 
of years. Different kinds of stone have different properties, and our species 
has long known and exploited the various properties of the basic rock types:
 
 Igneous rocks (volcanic in origin) range from coarse (like pumice) to 
razor-sharp (like obsidian, or volcanic glass).
 
 Sedimentary rocks (bits of other rocks concreted into new forms) 
include sandstone (good for scraping or rubbing) and flint (a dense 
stone that can be as sharp as obsidian but is far less brittle).
 
 Metamorphic rocks (any kind of rock that has itself been altered by 
heat or pressure) include quartzite (compressed sandstone), which is 
extremely hard and dense.
Mastering the most advanced techniques of stone toolmaking can take years; 
the toolmaking process normally proceeds through three main stages:
 
 Core selection, in which the toolmaker chooses a chunk or block of 
stone (the core) because of its properties
 
 Initial reduction, in which the toolmaker uses a hammerstone to break 
away unwanted parts of the core or flakes of stone he plans to work 
further
 
 Secondary reduction, in which the toolmaker continues to shape the 
core into the desired tool or refine the flake knocked off during initial 
reduction; this may be done by pressure flaking, or using a bone or 
antler tip to snap fine flakes off the stone edge to make something like an 
arrowhead
These basic methods shaped stone into a wide array of artifacts; the most 
common artifacts in the ancient world included
 
 Projectile armatures (such as arrowheads) that were fixed to projectiles 
(such as arrows) used to hunt animals from a distance
 
 Cutting implements (from razor-blade-sized fine tools to hand axes) 
used for heavier work such as shaving wood or butchering very large 
animals
 
 Scraping implements used for working wood or even removing unwanted 
tissues from animal hides
 
 Perforating implements such as drills, which were often inserted into a 
haft (a handle) and used to make small holes in bone, wood, and other 
dense matter

95
 Chapter 5: My Career Is in Ruins: How Anthropologists Learn about the Past
These tools had many variations; on the Pacific Northwest coast, slate was 
worked into daggers by abrasion or broken into slats fitted into leather vests 
as body armor.
The earliest stone tools date to more than 2.5 million years ago, but very 
complex tools such as symmetrical hand axes weren’t formed until about 1.8 
million years ago. The earliest traces, like the earliest traces of the earliest 
hominid fossils, are all found in Africa.
 
Stone tools can reveal information about ancient activities, such as whether 
people were working wood or butchering animals, at a given campsite. But 
they can also tell you about ancient human movement. Sourcing analysis iden-
tifies the outcrop of rock a given stone tool came from based on its chemical 
fingerprint. Where I work in the Pacific Northwest, we’ve found that obsid-
ian at some lower-Columbia River villages came from outcrops in Southern 
Oregon hundreds of miles away. In Europe, archaeologists have used sourcing 
to identify that Neanderthals normally moved their stone no more than about 
20 kilometers (12.5 miles) from their quarry sites.
Bone and antler
Bone and antler were the plastics of the ancient world. They could be 
scraped or rubbed into shapes — such as barbed harpoon points — that 
didn’t shatter as easily as stone. Toolmakers often soaked them in water or 
some other liquid before working with them; they often manipulated bone by 
using the following methods:
 
 Groove-and-splinter: Workers cut two parallel grooves into a dense 
piece of bone or antler and then pried out the splinter between them for 
further work.
 
 Abrasion: Toolmakers used any number of materials — from sand-
papery shark skin to rough pumice — to hone a point or blade. Bone 
knives, effective for butchering large animals, were made this way.
 
 Sawing: This technique was more difficult with stone blades but much 
easier with metal blades (for those cultures that possessed them).
With these basic methods, bone and antler became a wide array of impres-
sive and efficient artifacts, including
 
 Snow goggles (consisting of a slab of bone with two narrow slits cut in 
as eyelets) made by Arctic peoples to allow vision but prevent snow 
blindness (caused by the sun reflecting off the snow)
 
 Fish hooks for catching fish of all sizes
 
 Needles for sewing everything from tent skins to clothing

96
Part II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology
The earliest bone and antler tools, including digging implements, date to over 
a million years ago, but the more complex working of bone and antler are 
much more recent, beginning around 100,000 years ago.
Pottery
Pottery is clay that’s been heated so that the minerals recrystallize; it’s 
common in all cultures that practiced farming because pottery can be 
reheated without breaking when cooking food. Nonfarmers also heated clay 
into solid tablets and some small containers, but large-scale use of pottery 
really originated with farming peoples.
Basically, people form pottery in three stages:
 
 Preparation of the clay, such as the removal of dry chunks or the addi-
tion of material such as sand or straw, makes the clay keep its shape.
 
 Shaping of the item, often with slabs of clay grafted together, rolled cyl-
inders of it stacked up to make a vessel, or the use of a potter’s wheel, 
makes the item useful.
 
 Firing of the formed item to drive out water and harden it requires tem-
peratures over about 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,832 degrees Fahrenheit), 
which is hotter than a normal campfire and requires special preparation 
(such as the use of a kiln, a housing in which fire is carefully controlled).
Dozens of variations on each of these manufacturing stages exist from culture 
to culture.
Although baked clay figurines date to more than 20,000 years ago, the first 
substantial use of clay for containers occurs around 10,000 years ago with 
the invention of a farming lifestyle.
Billions of pottery vessels were used in the ancient world; in Roman times, 
amphorae (storage jars ranging in size from bottles to barrels) were as 
common as jars and bottles today. After pottery breaks down to pieces about 
3 centimeters (1 inch) in size, little in the natural world breaks them down 
further. Many archaeologists have spent entire careers fitting together pieces 
of ancient pottery to understand commerce, food preparation and storage, 
and other aspects of life in the ancient world.

W
hen Darwin first published On the Origin of Species in 1859, only a few 
early human fossils had been discovered, and nobody really knew 
what to do with them. (Here I use the term human loosely — more on that 
soon.) A century and a half later, anthropologists have a collection of hun-
dreds of early human fossils as well as Darwin’s theory of evolution to make 
sense of them. So what do they have to say?
In short, they tell the story of human evolution, or at least parts of it. They 
tell us how our ancestors got around their landscapes, how they hunted or 
scavenged their food and processed it with stone tools, as well as how they 
eventually controlled fire, crossed open bodies of water — and all the while 
carried brains of ever-increasing size.
No wonder these fossils are normally kept in high-security vaults in their coun-
tries of origin. They’re priceless windows onto our species’ distant past. In this 
chapter, you find out what early human fossils reveal about the human past.
 
For this book, I’m using the traditional term hominid to refer to the large, 
bipedal primates, which include humans, our fossil ancestors, and some 
of their relatives; generally these can all be called early humans, though in 
Chapter 7 you can find a more precise definition of what it is to be human. You 

98
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
may see the term “hominin” in some anthropological works these days, but 
this is a new term that’s not universally used and, for reasons I lay out in the 
Introduction, I’m sticking with the more widely used “hominid.”
Great Africa: The Earliest Hominids
One of the main discoveries of anthropology has been that the roots of the 
human species are in Africa; go far enough back in the family tree and your 
ancestors — be they South Asian, Inuit, or Danish — all originate on the great 
continent of Africa. That’s where archaeologists find fossils of early humans 
time and again, such that today no serious anthropologist doubts that early 
hominid evolution occurred exclusively in Africa. (For more on what a fossil 
is, see Chapter 4.)
A hominid is a large primate that walks upright. Today Homo sapiens sapiens 
(that’s you, me, and everyone we know) is the only living hominid species, 
but the following sections describe the many others that have come before 
us. Compared with the rest of the primates, the most distinctive trait of the 
hominids (living and extinct) is that hominids walk (or walked) upright.
 
Another characteristic of the hominids is that they generally have a smaller 
canine tooth than the other primates. The fact that early hominids had smaller 
canines is interesting because primates with large canines normally use them 
in threat displays to intimidate other primates. Social behavior may have been 
a little different in the early hominids, with smaller canines perhaps reflecting 
less inter-hominid competition. Unfortunately, anthropologists just can’t be 
sure, even though the canine info presents a pretty good argument.
The earliest fossils displaying bipedal anatomy include
 
 Fossils of thighbones from the Tungen Hills, Kenya, dated to about 6 
million years ago
 
 Footprints preserved in volcanic ash at Laetoli, Tanzania, dated to just 
less than 4 million years ago
 
 Pelvic, thigh, shin, and foot bones from various large primates, dated 
after about 3 million years ago and including the Lucy specimen (more 
about Lucy later) from Ethiopia
Clearly, some large primates were walking upright after about 6 million years 
ago in the same general area (Africa) where you can later see evidence of our 
own lineage, Homo.
So what happened? Why would our primate ancestors evolve a new way to 
get around, a new form of locomotion? Read on!

 Chapter 6: Bones of Contention: The Fossil Evidence for Early Human Evolution
Stand and Deliver: The Riddles 
of Bipedalism
Over 20 years ago, when I was an undergraduate at the University of London, 
I heard a pretty simple story about the origins of bipedalism: around 3 million 
years ago, early hominids moved into a savanna ecosystem and rose on hind 
legs to adapt to it. Today, we anthropologists know a little different. Our 
knowledge is improving, though it’s still not making explanations any clearer. 
Anthropologists can say for sure that
 
 Bipedalism has origins over 5 million years ago.
 
 Bipedalism originated in forested environments, not savanna, though 
hominids did move onto the savanna by 3 million years ago.
 
 The advantages of bipedalism apparently outweighed the disadvantages.
To make sense of these facts, you need to understand early hominids not 
as actors on a stage with the landscape as a backdrop but as fully involved 
members of ancient ecosystems. In the sections that follow, I explain how the 
advantages of bipedalism overcame its disadvantages to early humans, and I 
give you a look at the complexity of early hominid evolution.
Walking upright: Pros and cons
Most anthropologists recognize the following likely advantages of bipedalism for 
primates likely to have been the immediate predecessors of habitual bipeds:
 
 Efficiency: Walking bipedally is efficient for animals of early hominid size.
 
 Carrying capacity: Bipedal movement would also allow the hands to be 
free to carry objects.
 
 Improved scouting: Walking bipedally would enable hominids to see 
over tall vegetation.
 
 Body cooling: Switching to bipedalism would allow more efficient cooling 
of the body in tropical and subtropical Africa.
You can pretty easily look at any anatomical characteristic and say, “Well, I 
can see why that would be useful,” but remember, every evolutionary adaptation 
is a compromise. Most anthropologists would also agree that bipedalism has 
its downsides as well:

100
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
 
 Climbing ability: Bipedal anatomy would make hominids less capable 
climbers (for example, making escape from predation more difficult).
 
 Speed and agility: Bipedal anatomy would make hominids slower and 
less agile than equally sized quadrupeds (animals moving on four limbs).
Remember, any theory that purports to explain the origins of bipedalism has 
to account for both the pros and cons. Beware of any theory that attempts to 
explain too much with just one factor, like the aquatic ape theory. Evolution 
is complex, and single factors usually don’t account for everything.
The complexities of early hominid evolution
Sorting out what was involved in early hominid evolution has preoccupied 
hundreds of anthropologists for decades. Today I think anthropology has a 
pretty good handle on some of the most important factors involved, and I 
sketch them out in this section.
Trophic levels
Early hominid evolution didn’t take place in a vacuum — our ancestors 
lived out their lives as active members of a variety of African ecosystems. 
Environmental changes that affected other species ended up affecting early 
hominids, and vice versa.
 
The Pliocene geological epoch from about 5 to 1.8 million years ago is par-
ticularly important for early hominid studies because it’s the period in 
which bipedalism really took off as a hominid adaptation. The Pliocene was 
marked by global cooling and pretty severe ecosystem changes in Africa. The 
Pleistocene begins at about 1.8 million years ago and is a period marked by the 
ice ages (which ended around 10,000 years ago). Many anthropologists term 
the archaeology of the early hominids Plio-Pleistocene archaeology.
One major global environmental change began around 2 million years ago 
as global cooling began to fragment the massive, steamy forests that domi-
nated Africa (instead of straddling the equator as they do today). As some of 
those forests were replaced by open grassland, many dense-forest ape species 
became extinct because they were unable to adapt to the changing environment; 
however, the ancestors of today’s wildebeest, zebras, and other savanna species 
began to flourish. Some form of hominid also flourished — or at least survived — 
as it moved from fragmented forest onto more open savanna. There, the species 
interacted in the classic savanna ecosystem of several trophic (nutrition) levels:
 
 Primary biomass: Consists of grasses, roots, seeds, and other plant matter
 
 Herbivore: Subsists mainly on primary biomass; includes grazing herd 
species such as zebra, gazelle, and elephant

101
 Chapter 6: Bones of Contention: The Fossil Evidence for Early Human Evolution
 
 Carnivore: Subsists mainly on herbivores; includes the big cats such as 
lions, leopards, and cheetahs
 
 Scavenger: Subsists mainly on the remains of carnivore kills; includes 
hyenas, foxes, and vultures
Like any plant or animal, all early hominids fit somewhere in this hierarchy — 
and the hierarchy itself could change. For example, consider that over time, 
one kind of early hominid — early Homo (our first relative of this period) — 
moved up the trophic “ladder,” directly competing first with other scavengers 
(for the scraps left behind by the carnivores) but later competing directly with 
the big cats (for prey species such as zebras and wildebeest). To get their hands 
on these species, hominid groups had to be agile, numerous, intelligent and — 
I imagine — very proactive. You don’t try to drive a lioness and her cubs away 
from a fresh kill with anything other than total commitment!
Factors and interactions
Considering that early hominid evolution was part of larger ecosystem evolu-
tion, you can be sure that it was very complex; single-factor models explain-
ing just about anything never seem to pan out.
Having said that, I do think that anthropology has identified some very impor-
tant factors of early hominid evolution, but how those factors interacted — 
how one may have promoted another but dampened others — is still poorly 
understood. The following are all important factors in early hominid evolution:
 
 Territoriality: How animals keep track of and note their territories; 
chimpanzees occasionally go on patrol, attacking interlopers, and pre-
sumably early hominids had similar concerns.
 
 Sexual behavior: Was sexual activity seasonal? If so, what was the 
mating season, and how did this affect hominid behavior and ecology?
 
 Offspring-rearing behavior: How long did offspring have to be pro-
tected? Were males kicked out of the group when they became a threat 
to the alpha male, like in gorilla society?
 
 Resource distribution: How are the species’ (both the hominids and the 
animals that hominids interacted with) food, water, and other resources 
distributed on the landscape? Do they turn on and off on a seasonal 
basis? How does this cycle affect territoriality?
 
 Tool use: Did the species use tools, like the sharp chips of stone early 
hominids used or the probe sticks chimpanzees use to investigate ter-
mite mounds? And if so, what effect did those tools have on subsistence 
mode? For example, finding good stone to make tools may be included in 
travel decisions or even territorial behavior.

102
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
 
 Subsistence mode: Did the species eat a restricted or general diet? What 
were the constituents of that diet, and how did this make-up affect ter-
ritoriality and/or competition with other animals, including, perhaps, 
other groups of hominids?
 
 Social behavior: All primates have complex social interactions; what 
were these interactions for the early hominids? Can anthropologists 
draw useful parallels with the modern chimpanzees and gorillas, or is 
such comparison inappropriate?
 
 Communication and language: Primates handle the intensity and com-
plexity of their social interactions through communication, ranging from 
physical grooming to bodily postures, vocalizations, and — in humans 
and some of our ancestors — language. So, what was the nature of com-
munication among the early hominids?
 
 Anatomy: What limits did the anatomy impose on behavior related to 
subsistence, tool use, sexual behavior, or any other factor? At the same 
time, what options did early hominid anatomy allow?
Although other factors were certainly involved in early hominid evolution, 
the preceding list is an excellent summary of the most important ones, and 
it’s plenty of food for thought.
The aquatic ape theory
Unfortunately, I need to dispel the common myth 
that the aquatic ape theory (AAT) is a legitimate 
scientific theory on the origins of bipedalism.
In short, AAT supporters suggest that early 
hominids developed bipedalism by spending a 
lot of their time in bodies of water. To be able 
to breathe, they would have to keep their heads 
above water, which they accomplished by 
standing on two legs. The problems with AAT 
are many, but you can boil them down to the 
fact that AAT supporters’ so-called evidence 
typically involves lists of human anatomical 
characteristics that are similar to those of 
aquatic mammals (such as whales). But the 
biologists and physical anthropologists who’ve 
reviewed these lists find little compelling evi-
dence; the similarities are trivial or misleading 
and have better explanations than AAT.
AAT is well known because it’s often publicized 
as a groundbreaking alternative to mainstream 
anthropology. It’s an alternative, all right, but so 
is the space alien theory that extraterrestrials 
were responsible for bipedalism. Possible, but 
with precious little evidence for it.
My own experience of AAT came during my 
work at Kenya’s Leakey Research Station 
on the shore of Lake Turkana. The lakeshore 
where we waded while fishing wasn’t a good 
place for bipeds (including me) because the 
lake was home to thousands of Nile crocodiles. 
I can’t fathom how small, lightweight early hom-
inids could have survived crocodiles’ ambush 
attacks in the murky water. This area was a 
spectacularly dangerous place, much more so 
than even the open savanna.

103
 Chapter 6: Bones of Contention: The Fossil Evidence for Early Human Evolution
Clearly, early hominid evolution was no simple matter and can’t be easy to 
reconstruct. But anthropologists and archaeologists are ingenious in their 
ability to extract as much as possible from any fragment that can reveal 
something about the past. In the following sections, I show you just what the 
fossils have to say about early hominid evolution.
All the Same from the Neck Down: 
The Australopithecines
For years, palaeoanthropologists have been obsessed with finding and inter-
preting the fossils and (sometimes) stone tools these hominids used. Many of 
the fossil discoveries have been of the genus Australopithecus (austral referring 
to South Africa, where they were first found, and pithecus referring to their ape-
like nature). As a group, they’re referred to as australopithecines.
Fossil discoveries have made it clear that between about 4 million and 1 mil-
lion years ago, two main groups of African hominids — the robusts and the 
graciles — existed. In many ways these creatures were similar to humans: 
They walked on two legs, probably lived in social groups of roughly the same 
size as chimpanzees or gorillas, probably had some complex vocalizations 
(though anthropology doesn’t have good evidence to support the existence 
of modern language this early), and probably lived lives you would recognize 
as similar to that of other primates today, or even other social mammals, 
such as wolves or big cats. The sections that follow describe these two 
groups in more detail.
 
Keep in mind that although some preaustralopithecine hominid fossils exist, 
the time of the australopithecines is when the fossil record really becomes 
rich and well known, so I’m focusing on them in this book.
The basic differences and similarities
The robust and gracile australopithecines share the following anatomical 
characteristics:
 
 Bipedal locomotion: Walking habitually on two legs
 
 Encephalization: Having brains slightly larger than expected for their 
body size as compared to other primates, such as the chimpanzee
 
 Canine reduction: Having smaller canine teeth than other primates

104
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
 
 Moderate degree of sexual dimorphism: Different body sizes for males 
and females; this is common in nonhuman primates — gorilla males can 
be about 50 percent larger than females — but is less pronounced in 
humans, where males are only about 10 percent larger than females
 
 Moderate body size: Standing between 4 and 4.5 feet (about 1.2 meters 
to about 1.4 meters) and weighing from 65 to 100 pounds (about 30 
kilograms to about 45 kilograms)
For some anthropologists, the real differences in the robusts and graciles are 
in their heads — that is, in their diets as reflected by their teeth. In the next 
sections I explain why some anthropologists say the australopithecines were 
all the same from the neck down.
In other words, the australopithecines were somewhat larger than chimpan-
zees but smaller than modern humans, had largish brains (more on this later) 
and smaller, more human-like teeth than other primates, and walked upright. 
These creatures are what Hollywood calls ape-men (of course, things would 
have gotten pretty boring pretty quickly without some ape-women), and in a 
way Hollywood is right. Good evidence shows that the gracile australopith-
ecines were direct ancestors of the earliest members of the genus Homo, 
the originator of all humans today. Figure 6-1 shows the crania (braincase 
and face) of the main early hominid species (and some others discussed 
in Chapters 7 and 8), including their facial bones and teeth and the relative 
sizes of their brains. Figure 6-2 shows you how these species were related 
and when they existed. In both figures, you can see commonalities and differ-
ences that I discuss in the following sections.
One way to think of the robust and gracile australopithecines is in the same 
way you think of lions and cheetahs; both have the same essential body plan, 
live in similar environments, may go after some similar food sources, and 
have a common evolutionary ancestor, but each has developed its own way 
to live, diverging evolutionarily to become a different animal. The evidence 
suggests the same about the australopithecines.
 
Classifying fossil material means deciding which biological group it belongs 
in; anthropologists often do this classification on the basis of shape, which 
reveals a lot about the animal. For example, nobody is going to place a fish 
skull into the rabbit category. But when it comes to our own ancestors — 
early hominids — things aren’t so easy; anthropology can get personal 
(anthropologists are human, of course), and things can get sticky. Remember 
that some anthropologists are lumpers (people who overlook details in order 
to focus on common patterns and place new finds in existing groups), and 
others are splitters, who focus on details and tend to create new groups rather 
than place new fossils into old groups. Personally, I’m a lumper, and you can 
bet that this tendency has affected my interpretations of the material. Still, 
on a broad scale, most anthropologists would agree with the gist of the early 
hominid evolution narrative I give in this book.

The crusher: Robust australopithecines
The robusts were a heavily built kind of australopithecine. Their anatomical 
characteristics included
 
 Massive, flat grinding molars for processing a relatively dry diet (see 
more on the diet later in this section)
 
 Massively buttressed and fortified facial structure to absorb enormous 
chewing stresses
 
 Sagittal crest, or a flare of bone atop the skull — like a mohawk — that 
served as an attachment point for massive chewing muscles
 
 Moderate brain volume, about 550 cubic centimeters (about 19 fluid 
ounces or about 1.5 typical soda cans)
Robusts, then, were robust in the head (their molars were four times the size 
of your own), and that had to do with massive chewing pressures. What were 
they chewing? Analysis of the microscopic wear on their tooth fossils indi-
cates a diet very much like the modern rhinoceros (yes, rhinoceros), which 

106
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
subsists on leaves and grasses on the African savanna. The rhino crushes 
the vegetation with flat teeth that are scratched and worn down by dust that 
adheres to the leaves. The robust, then, is evidence of a vegetarian hominid 
whose massive teeth weren’t used to sink into the flesh of prey animals but 
to snip, crush, and grind leaves and other plant matter.

 Chapter 6: Bones of Contention: The Fossil Evidence for Early Human Evolution
The earliest robusts (Australopithecus aethiopicus) are known from around 2.5 
million years ago, and the most recent from about 1 million years ago. Robusts 
are variously classified as Australopithecus robustus or Australopithecus boisei, 
and some classify them in a different genus altogether: Paranthropus. Because 
I’m a lumper, though, I’m putting them all in the generic “robust australopith-
ecine” group.
Some interesting robust specimens include
 
 The Black Skull, a 2.5-million-year-old robust from northern Kenya
 
 Olduvai Hominid 5, a later robust (about 1.7 million years old) discov-
ered in 1959 by Mary Leakey at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania
 
 The Peninj Mandible, the lower jawbone of a robust dated to about 1.5 
million years ago — one of the last known robusts
After 1 million years ago, no more robust fossils appear at all; in fact, it looks like 
the robusts became extinct. That’s not unusual; most species do become extinct 
after a few million years (the average is about 4 million years) for all kinds of rea-
sons. One reason species become extinct is that they overspecialize on a food 
source that suddenly becomes extinct itself. Unable to react quickly enough 
to this change in food source (biologically, of course; they can’t will their 
bodies to adapt), the species dies out. This scenario may well be the case 
with the robusts — they had a pretty specialized diet. Whatever the case, 
after 1 million years ago the robusts are gone, and no species after them, 
including Homo, bears any trace of them.
The omnivore: Gracile australopithecines
The graciles were a lightly built kind of australopithecine. Their anatomical 
characteristics include
 
 Moderate tooth size is smaller than the robusts’ massive teeth but 
larger than modern humans’.
 
 Moderately built facial structure absorbs more chewing stress than 
modern human skulls but far less than that of the robusts or even chim-
panzees or gorillas.
 
 Lack of a sagittal crest means they’re missing the robusts’ massive bony 
flare for massive chewing muscles.
 
 Moderate brain size is about 480 cubic centimeters (about 16 ounces or 
just over one typical soda can).

108
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
Graciles, then, seem to be intermediate between the characteristics of the 
chimpanzees and gorillas (our closest living relatives) and modern humans. 
They lack the massive grinding teeth of the robusts (and their microscopic 
tooth wear indicates a varied or omnivorous diet), but they’re not like the 
chimpanzees or gorillas, either; compared to them, graciles are much more 
like humans.
For these reasons, many have called the graciles the missing link between 
Homo and the rest of the primate order. Although some anthropologists say 
the origins of Homo are still unknown, many (perhaps most) anthropologists 
believe that the graciles are the immediate ancestor of Homo. I agree with 
this theory, though science always allows room for new discoveries and rein-
terpretation of the matter at hand.
The earliest graciles are known from around 4 million years ago, and the most 
recent from about 2 million years ago. Graciles are a little better known than 
the robusts, and this group contains significant variations within it that I just 
don’t have room to cover here. As a lumper, I’m putting them all in the generic 
“gracile australopithecine” group; this classification isn’t misleading for my 
purposes here. Some interesting gracile specimens and species include
 
 Australopithecus ramidus. The earliest known australopithecine — robust 
or gracile — about 4 to 6 million years old.
 
 Australopithecus afarensis. The most famous specimen is Lucy, the 3.2-million-
year-old partial skeleton discovered in Ethiopia in 1972 by palaeoanthro-
pologists listening to the Beatles’ song Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds. 
(Lucy is actually only one of 33 known individuals of Australopithecus 
afarensis, but she’s the most famous.)
 
 Australopithecus africanus, a very well-known species found from South 
to East Africa and dated to about 3 to 2 million years ago; one, the Taung 
Baby discovered in South Africa, was only a few years old at death, and 
marks on the skull suggest it may have been killed and snatched up by a 
large bird of prey!
After about 2 million years ago, gracile fossils disappear; instead, you find 
only robusts and members of a new group, Homo (which you can read about 
in the next section). Although robusts’ disappearance was complete — no later 
hominid carried characteristics of the robusts — that’s not the case here. Early 
members of the genus Homo did carry characteristics of late graciles. This 
evidence strongly suggests that the graciles aren’t only a link to the other 
primates but also to the origins of our own lineage as well. Gracile australopith-
ecines, then, are a missing link.

109
 Chapter 6: Bones of Contention: The Fossil Evidence for Early Human Evolution
The Cracked Mirror: Early Homo
By about 2 million years ago. The savanna was home to at least two kinds 
of hominid: the robust australopithecine and members of a new biological 
group, the genus Homo. This creature, at the root of each person today, also 
originated in Africa. Gazing at the fossils of early Homo, I feel that I’m looking 
into an ancient, cracked mirror: That’s me, isn’t it?
Exploring characteristics of early Homo
Early Homo possessed some very distinctive anatomical characteristics:
 
 Very large brain, about 700+ cubic centimeters, which is around 24 
fluid ounces (or 2 soda cans), compared to about four soda cans (48 fluid 
ounces) for modern humans and around a single can —12 fluid ounces — 
for chimpanzees and gorillas)
 
 Relatively light facial structure, absorbing less chewing stress than any 
australopithecine
 
 No sagittal crest, also indicating a lack of emphasis on heavy chewing
 
 Fully modern hand with opposable thumb, making for relatively 
extreme dexterity
In contrast to the australopithecines, though, the distinctive characteristics 
of early Homo weren’t just anatomical; they also included the first traces of 
some important behavioral characteristics that continued throughout the 
lineage, right up to the present day. One trait is a heavier reliance on tools 
like the stone ones used increasingly after 2 million years ago; by 1.8 million 
years ago, you may begin to wonder how Homo survived without tools. Early 
Homo also placed a greater emphasis on animal tissues in the diet, a feature 
indicated by an increase in the number of animal bones bearing marks from 
stone butchering tools and/or hammerstones used to get at nutritious marrow.
So early Homo was a pretty new creature, indeed. It had a brain almost twice 
the size of the gracile australopithecine, was lighter-built (though perhaps a 
little taller) than any australopithecine, and had some radical new behaviors. 
Though australopithecines may have made and used some simple tools fash-
ioned from sticks, bones, antlers, and even chunks of stone, early Homo is 
when tool use goes from being a part of life to a necessity of life.
For example, consider that brain tissue is extremely expensive from a caloric 
perspective, consuming more than 20 times as many calories as muscle 
tissue does. It has its uses (such as increasing the potential for intelligence), 

110
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
but that calorie-hog brain has to be fed! And of all the foods on the hominid 
savanna, the most calories came from the bodies of other animals — from 
their fat, blood, and meat. Early Homo foraged for just about any food it could 
find, but it also began to eat more animal tissues than any other hominid did, 
and that was only possible with tools created to butcher those animals and 
get at the calories.
The earliest specimens of Homo are known from around 2.5 million years 
ago and the most recent from about 1.5 million years ago. Recent discoveries 
have shown that several varieties of early Homo probably existed, including 
Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis, and Homo ergaster. However, as a lumper I’m 
putting them all in the generic “early Homo” group.
Some interesting early Homo specimens (the catalog numbers are included 
here so you can find them easily on the Web or in other texts) include
 
 Skull 1470, a beautifully preserved skull and face of early Homo that 
some assign to H. rudolfensis and some to H. habilis
 
 Skull 1813, another well-preserved full skull and face with lots of teeth; 
it’s so similar to both late graciles and early Homo that for as long as I’ve 
been studying the matter, nobody has made a final decision on which 
species it is
After 1.8 million years ago, early Homo evolved into Homo erectus, a species I 
discuss later in the chapter
Dalmatians and cigar smoke: Finds 
at Olduvai Gorge
Smoking cigars, quaffing whisky, and herding her pet Dalmatians every day 
for decades, Mary Leakey was a force of nature dedicated to understanding the 
life of early humans. With her husband Louis, she made incredible discoveries 
about the life of early Homo in Tanzania’s Olduvai Gorge, where geological layers 
have preserved a long record of human evolution from over 2 million years ago 
to the present day. The Leakeys’ finds include
 
 Many stone-and-bone scatters of stone tools and bits of fossil bone; the 
stones include tools as well as toolmaking debris, and the bones some-
times bear nicks and scratches from stone butchering tools
 
 Many hominid fossils, including the remains of robust australopith-
ecines and early Homo; in fact, the Leakeys showed that these two spe-
cies lived in the same area at the same time, but because they were after 
different kinds of food, some argue, they would have had little friction 
between them

Out of Africa: Early dispersals 
of early Homo
Not too long ago, the general consensus was that hominids first left Africa 
around 1 million years ago in the form of Homo erectus, the hominid that 
early Homo evolved into by 1.8 million years ago. But recent discoveries 
show that Homo left nearly twice that long ago, or even earlier:
 
 The 1.8-million-year-old Dmanisi site on the east shore of the Black Sea 
has recently revealed stone tools (of the Oldowan type; see the next 
section) and the spectacular fossils of a new-to-science hominid that’s 
certainly within Homo but of a debatable species; some say it’s late H. 
rudolfensis, some that it’s early H. erectus.
 
 At the Wushan Cave site in China, fossils of early Homo are dated to 1.9 
million years ago; for a long time, many doubted the dates for this site 
A force of nature: The life of Mary Leakey
Mary Douglas Nicol was born in London, England 
in 1913. She married Louis S. B. Leakey in 1937, 
and soon thereafter began her African research 
into early human origins. In 1948, she discovered 
the nearly complete fossil remains of Proconsul 
africanus, an important extinct primate species 
dating to roughly 20 million years ago.
In the 1950s, the Leakeys began their excava-
tions at Tanzania’s Olduvai Gorge, where they 
worked for decades. In 1959, Mary discovered 
the beautifully preserved fossil remains of an 
extinct early hominid, Australopithecus boisei 
(named in part for Boise State University, 
which was funding part of the excavation). 
Unfortunately, overnight the fossil skull was 
crushed by wandering cattle, and Leakey had 
to spend weeks fitting the pieces back together. 
The find was so spectacular, though, that the 
National Geographic Society took an interest 
and began to both fund the Leakeys’ excava-
tions and publicize their findings.
Through the 1960s, the excavations and tremen-
dous discoveries continued. Mary excavated the 
fossil bones and stone tools of early Homo, find-
ing evidence sometimes for hominids butchering 
other animals, and sometimes for other animals 
gnawing on hominid bones. By the early 1970s, 
a number of methods allowed for very precise 
dating of the layers at Olduvai, which has sites 
going back more than 2 million years. Excavations 
continue at Olduvai today.
Although Louis Leakey passed away in 1972, 
Mary Leakey kept working. Her most spec-
tacular discovery came in 1976, when she 
found a track of fossilized footprints at Laetoli, 
Tanzania. Dated to nearly 4 million years ago, 
the footprints proved that early hominids were 
walking by this time.
In later years Mary Leakey focused her research 
on the rock art of Africa, compiling detailed 
records of thousands of sites across the conti-
nent. She died in December 1996, having spent 
nearly half a century giving humanity a look at 
its roots.

112
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
(published in the mid-1990s), but the fact that Dmanisi is securely dated 
to 1.8 million years ago has inspired more confidence in the Wushan Cave 
dates, which may well be a second line of evidence showing a dispersal 
of Homo far earlier than once believed.
Tool time: The decoupling 
of behavior from anatomy
After you begin to study Homo, you’re in the world of tools, artifacts made or 
used by hominids. Because stone decays more slowly than the bone, wood, 
or antler used to make other tools, the best-known of the early tools are the 
stone tools. So archaeologists have spent a lot of time classifying and study-
ing stone tools. For early hominid studies, two types of tools are most impor-
tant to remember. Oldowan tools are dated from about 2.5 million years ago 
and persist until about 1.8 million years ago; they’re largely asymmetrical 
and consist of battered stones or chips of stone (often choppers or cutting 
flakes). But by 1.8 million years ago hominids had invented and/or learned 
to apply the concept of symmetry to their tools, and carefully chipped, often 
teardrop-shaped hand axes are common.
Starting with early Homo, hominid behavior began to detach or decouple 
from its anatomy; that is, the body was no longer the factor that really set 
the boundaries of behavior for the species. With tools, hominids could do 
things that the body alone couldn’t do. For example, they could use stone 
tools to smash open bones to get at marrow — fresh bone is extremely tough 
to break with anything but a heavy hammerstone — or open the hide on car-
casses of sun-baked dead animals. (Ready for lunch yet?)
So for humans, tools take the place of other bodily characteristics of other 
species, such as the hyena’s bone-crushing jaws and the big cats’ sharp, 
slashing teeth. And through time the tools of Homo become even more com-
plex, eventually including artifacts made from several raw materials like bone 
and wood lashed or glued together and increasing the behavioral range of the 
hominids. And it all started with stone tools — simple chips of stone.
The Traveler: The Accomplishments 
of Homo erectus
In my classes, I often refer to the world of Homo erectus as shadowy because 
although the species has some resemblance to modern humans and was 
definitely more human-like than any other ape, many facets of its life have 

113
 Chapter 6: Bones of Contention: The Fossil Evidence for Early Human Evolution
been mysteries for a long time. But today archaeologists know quite a bit more 
about H. erectus than they did even 20 years ago, so I also say new light is shining 
on the subject. In this section I sketch out what archaeologists have discovered 
about this fascinating early hominid.
Characteristics of Homo erectus
By 1.8 million years ago — well after the appearance of early Homo around 
2.5 million years ago — two main hominids were on the scene: the robust 
australopithecines and Homo erectus. When first discovered in the late 19th 
century, people though the fossils of H. erectus represented the first bipedal 
primate, but that was quite wrong; evidence now puts bipedalism at close to 
6 million years ago. Still, the name Homo erectus (from the erect nature of the 
bipedal spine) stuck. Like its ancestor early Homo, Homo erectus possessed 
some very distinctive anatomical characteristics:
 
 Very large brain: About 1,000+ cubic centimeters — about 33 fluid 
ounces (or nearly 3 soda cans, compared to about 4 cans for modern 
human brains).
 
 Very small teeth: Compared to any hominid so far they indicate even 
less chewing stress, because Homo erectus more commonly processed 
food with tools rather than just the mouth.
 
 Larger body size: The Turkana Boy specimen, a 5-foot-3-inch teen at 
death, would have been close to 6 feet tall at adulthood).
Like early Homo, though, the adaptations of H. erectus weren’t just anatomical; 
they included some important behavioral characteristics:
 
 Even heavier reliance on tools: By 1.8 million years ago, anthropologists 
can hardly imagine H. erectus surviving without tools.
 
 More complex stone tools: These tools include the symmetrical, mul-
tipurpose hand axes used to butcher large animals and work pieces of 
wood.
 
 Wide geographical distribution: H. erectus migrated into the cool moun-
tains of Northeast Asia, survived in the jungles of Southeast Asia, and 
hunted in the forests of mainland Europe.
In short, Homo erectus continued all the trends seen since the origins of the 
genus Homo; therefore, society and even communication presumably became 
more complex. I discuss the evolution of language further in Chapter 13; for the 
moment, remember that Homo erectus didn’t have what you would consider 
fully modern language. This doesn’t mean H. erectus was a dumb, knuckle-
dragging brute. The following sections look at some of its accomplishments.

114
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
From confrontational scavenging 
to ambush hunting
Homo erectus probably began as a confrontational scavenger like its ancestor 
early Homo. Confrontational scavengers (like hyenas) confront big cats and 
drive them away from carcasses, which the confrontational scavengers then 
eat. Now imagine a troop of smart, confrontational, 6-foot H. erectus, and you 
can imagine how they survived. Later, though, H. erectus began to compete 
directly with the top carnivores such as the lion and, perhaps a little more 
often, the slightly less-intimidating cheetah. Discoveries like that of seven 
400,000-year-old spears at Schoeningen, Germany help illustrate this progression. 
These artifacts, up to six feet long and shaped with a pointed tip, show that H. 
erectus was going after big game, and not in any half-hearted way; these tools 
are evidence of ambush predation, taking on species like horses and wooly 
rhinoceros with the fierceness of a big cat.
The use of fire
By 300,000 years ago, H. erectus clearly had control of fire; sites in China 
(Zhoukoutien Cave, near Beijing) and Spain (Torralba and Ambrona) show 
burnt patches that appear to be hearths used to cook animal food. Fire would 
have been useful to hominids for several reasons. It could have provided pro-
tection from fireless animals (such as big cats). It also offered several food 
processing benefits like preventing dehydration, killing off harmful bacteria, 
and denaturing protein, which increases digestibility. Fire could also keep 
hominids warm at night.
Symmetry, watercraft, and
the “15-minute culture”
H. erectus also made symmetrical stone tools; if that doesn’t impress you, you 
try to do it! Modern humans need months to master this skill, and not even 
all moderns are good at it. But H. erectus banged out these tools by the score, 
using them for a variety of tasks from digging to butchery to woodworking. This 
practice also reveals that H. erectus was capable of some kind of abstraction — 
it imposed the concept of a symmetrical form on a chunk of stone. This act 
isn’t the fully developed symbolism present in modern humans, but it’s no 
simple trick, either. Chapters 7 and 13 of this book further discuss the signifi-
cance of symbols.

115
 Chapter 6: Bones of Contention: The Fossil Evidence for Early Human Evolution
Recent excavations have revealed that H. erectus arrived on the island of Flores, 
Indonesia, somewhere after 800,000 years ago. (Note: These aren’t the recently 
discovered “Flores man” or “Hobbit” fossils, which are of a different species 
dated to only 18,000 years ago.) Reconstruction of sea levels at that time indi-
cates that some kind of watercraft would have been necessary for such a voyage 
of up to 20 miles across the open sea. This development is so unexpected, so 
far out from what I’ve known and thought about H. erectus, that its significance 
hasn’t really hit me yet. Trust me, it’s astonishing.
Finally, southern England’s Boxgrove site has revealed that H. erectus’ stone 
tools may have taken hours to make (rather than just minutes, as some 
archaeologists had previously thought), and that archaeologists may well 
be underestimating its abilities. This discovery seems to counteract the 
common consensus that H. erectus had a relatively short attention span — 
what one archaeologist has called a 15-minute culture.
 
Underestimation of early peoples’ abilities wouldn’t be a new mistake in 
archaeology. In my opinion and experience, archaeology, consistently under-
estimates both how long ago events first happened and how far people traveled 
in the ancient world. We archaeologists are forever pushing back the dates for 
the earliest occurrence of some development (like the wheel, writing, stone 
tools, and so on) and being surprised at how far ancient travel really reached, 
either on foot or by water.

eing really human, it turns out, is a relatively recent pleasure (and 
occasional annoyance). It’s also complicated; to understand what 
humans are, you have to recognize the difference between being anatomi-
cally modern and behaviorally modern, something physical anthropologists 
and archaeologists base entire careers on. In the last 100 or so years they’ve 
completely overturned widely accepted ideas of what humans are as a spe-
cies. How? Well, they’ve shown that humans didn’t descend from European 
Neanderthals as early anthropologists thought, but rather from Africans of 
100,000 years ago. And they’ve shown that cave art isn’t just crude decoration; 
it’s the hallmark of a spectacularly new, essentially modern human mind. These 
and other discoveries help you understand just who humans are — just what 
makes up Homo sapiens sapiens.
Because anthropology is the study of humanity at large, defining humanity 
is a good beginning; in this chapter I give you a better understanding of how 
anthropologists define humanity.

Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
Distinguishing Modern Homo sapiens 
sapiens (That’s You!)
How did humanity become human from some proto-human ancestor? What 
does it mean to be human, anyway? Anthropology has been struggling with 
these questions for decades. Today people can say a lot about when and where 
modern humanity first happened, but exactly why or how — well, that’s always 
the hard part. Start with what anthropologists know for sure.
First, you have to consider each of the two ways to be a modern human sepa-
rately. Anatomical modernity is having an anatomical structure that’s indistin-
guishable from that of modern populations. Behavioral modernity, on the other 
hand, is displaying cultural behavior that’s indistinguishable from the behavior 
of modern populations. Why consider these distinctions separately? I address 
that topic later in this chapter. First, check out the following sections, which 
explain when anatomical and behavioral modernity first appear. Understanding 
modernity’s origins may help a lot in explaining them — at the very least, it’s 
necessary as a background to explaining modern humanity today.
 
This chapter deals with a lot of evolutionary concepts; for a refresher on 
evolution, head to Chapter 3.
Anatomical modernity
In the previous section, I mention that anatomical modernity means having 
anatomy — a body — that’s entirely modern; you can’t distinguish it from 
modern, living human bodies. These physical characteristics are what define 
Anatomically Modern Homo sapiens sapiens, widely known as AMHss; they’re 
what separate the AMHss from their ancestors, known as the pre-moderns or 
Archaic Homo sapiens (AHs). These characteristics include traits of the cra-
nium (the head) and the postcrania (the skeleton below the head).
In the cranium:
 
 The teeth, brow ridges, and face of AMHss are smaller overall than those 
of the AHs, reflecting less chewing stress (probably related to increased 
tool use for processing food).
 
 The AMHss’ brain case is larger (containing a brain almost the volume of 
a six-pack of soda cans — about 1,450 cubic centimeters or 50 ounces), 
almost certainly indicating a more complex culture.
 
 A distinct chin is present in AMHss. Nobody has ever convincingly 
explained the chin, but it may also be related to reduced chewing 
stresses.

119
Chapter 7: It’s Good to Be Home: Homo sapiens sapiens, Our Biological Species
The postcranial bones of AMHss also are distinctive from those of their 
ancestral AHs:
 
 AMHss bones are basically longer and thinner.
 
 The AMHss body is lankier and a little less robust.
Like the cranial differences, these differences in body build probably reflect 
increased tool use; the AMHss used tools rather than brute strength and 
physical fitness to adapt to their constant outdoor life, camping, traveling, 
hunting, and gathering every single day.
This, then, is humankind, at least anatomically. Of course, basic “humandom” 
has its variations, such as differences in height or skin color (which you can 
read more about in Chapter 14), but they all occur within the human species, 
among anatomically modern humans.
Behavioral modernity
Being human isn’t just anatomical; it’s also behavioral. If anatomical modernity 
is being physically indistinguishable from modern humans, you can easily 
deduce that behavioral modernity is acting in a way that’s indistinguishable 
Brain matter matters
Big brains are one of the most distinctive traits 
of anatomically modern humans, but cranial 
volume doesn’t necessarily directly correlate 
with intelligence (and intelligence is tough to 
measure anyway). Still, scientists today often 
gauge intelligence by an individual’s capacity to 
deal with changing circumstances. This guide-
line is okay for today’s times, but it’s pretty tough 
to measure in ancient hominids. Nevertheless, 
anthropologists do know that through time
  Hominid cranial volume increased.
  Hominid behavior became more complex.
  Hominid geographical range became more 
expansive.
These three points prove that hominids were 
gradually able to adapt to new or changing eco-
logical circumstances. Over time, they gained 
intelligence!
No matter how you measure, then, hominids 
clearly became more intelligent over time — 
more capable, for example, of modifying their 
behavior based on past experiences. This 
adaptability was very helpful in survival. So, 
even though anthropologists know that intel-
ligence and brain volume aren’t perfectly cor-
relative, studying hominid cranial volume and 
comparing it to migration and behavior as a 
crude measure of hominid intelligence is a 
fascinating pursuit.

Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
from modern humans. Behavioral modernity also implies that these actions 
are clearly different from all other animals — they’re unique to humans. Two 
main behavioral characteristics are unique to the human species:
 
 The use of symbolism (using one object or sign to mean something else)
 
 The use of complex language (communicating by stringing together 
audio and visual messages according to complex rules, syntax, and 
grammar)
 
Although other animals communicate — anyone knows that a cat’s meow is 
different from its hiss — human communication is distinctively rich, employing 
metaphors and communicating massive amounts of information accurately, 
quickly, and according to complex rules (syntax and grammar). Just think of 
the difference in complexity and subtlety between the sound “HISS!” and the 
very short phrase, “I think, therefore I am.”
Africa: The Cradle of Humanity
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, it wasn’t clear just where modern 
humanity first appeared; some suggested central Asia, and others thought 
it must have been in central Europe. Today, though, anthropologists have 
dozens of fossil finds and archaeological sites that clearly show modern 
humans first evolved in Africa. In this section, I discuss this fossil material 
as well as introduce you to when early modern humans migrated out of the 
great continent; in Chapter 8, you can read more about how modern humans 
spread across the globe.
Discovering the first AMHss
The best early AMHss fossils are from Herto in Ethiopia, dated to around 
150,000 years ago. By 100,000 years ago, the Near East (including countries 
like Israel and Syria) was also home to populations of AMHss.
The AMHss populations that appeared first in Africa moved out of that continent 
quickly and spread widely, colonizing the globe in roughly the following order:
 
 By 50,000 years ago, AMHss were in China and (shortly thereafter) 
Australia.
 
 By 40,000 years ago, they were in southeastern Europe, and by 20,000 
years ago, they’d made it to Western Europe.

121
Chapter 7: It’s Good to Be Home: Homo sapiens sapiens, Our Biological Species
 
 By 14,000 years ago, they reached North and South America, colonizing 
these continents after crossing the Bering land bridge connecting Siberia 
and Alaska.
 
 By 3,000 years ago, they’d colonized parts of the Pacific and the Arctic.
 
For a long time, hominids didn’t migrate with the concept of discovery in mind; 
instead, they migrated for two main reasons. First, they followed prey animals 
like herds of wild horses or mammoths across vast landscapes, following the 
grazers as they moved from one natural pasture to another. Second, early hom-
inids migrated into new areas as new areas became available. That is, like any 
life form, they tended to move into areas that could support them. Nature, it 
turns out, really does abhor a vacuum.
Exploring behavioral modernity
After humanity became anatomically modern and emerged from Africa 100,000 
years ago, the story of human evolution gets a little simpler than it’s been so 
far. That’s mainly because one main hominid dominates the scene: AMHss. The 
Neanderthals were also around, but I discuss them in the next section. For the 
moment, have a look at the other way of being human: behavioral modernity.
Earlier in this chapter, I explain that the two primary benchmarks for discov-
ering behavioral modernity are symbolism and language. Because language is 
ultimately symbolic, and early humans evidently made symbols such as cave 
art, or notches on bone or antler tablets with their artifacts, anthropologists 
can reasonably infer that early humans used (or could have used) language. 
So archaeologists have focused their search for behavioral modernity on the 
search for the earliest symbols and symbolic artifacts.
 
The archaeology of the origins of modern human consciousness (cognitive 
archaeology) is at the cutting edge of a lot of archaeology today. This newness 
doesn’t mean cognitive archaeology isn’t valuable or that its proponents aren’t 
making fantastic new discoveries, but as in the beginning of any new research 
effort, the public should be careful to demand very good evidence for radical 
new interpretations. Having said that, I think the archaeology of the evolution 
of consciousness is some of the most interesting ever attempted, and it’s well 
worth considering.
The best archaeological evidence for behavioral modernity comes from two 
main sites:
 
 South Africa’s 70,000-year-old Blombos Cave has yielded dozens of stone 
tablets bearing scratched x’s, some divots that look like o’s, parallel 
lines carved into their surfaces and rows of notches suggesting counts 

122
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
of something; these markings are clearly the products of symbol-using 
minds (and perhaps the world’s first tic-tac-toe fiends).
 
 Israel’s Skhul Cave, where ten AMHss were buried about 100,000 years 
ago, contains handfuls of perforated snail shells which proved under the 
microscope to be worn down a little, apparently from being suspended 
on a necklace. Wearing jewelry certainly reveals a symbolic mind (and 
the burials themselves are decent evidence for this argument as well).
In both cases, symbolism is clear. An x carved in rock doesn’t just mean 
two crossed lines: in contemporary culture, it can indicate Christianity (if 
arranged in one way) or the plus sign (if arranged another way). Nobody knows 
what Blombos Cave’s people meant with their x’s and o’s, but anthropologists do 
know they were communicating symbolically, which means they were behavior-
ally modern. And the Skhul Cave necklace evidence is also compelling because a 
necklace — just like the jewelry humans wear today — tells a story. For example, 
people today often wear rings to say much more than simply, “I own this band 
of metal”; rings can indicate that a person is married or attended a particular 
school — the possibilities are endless but almost always meaningful. And when 
you say things with objects, you’re acting in a distinctively modern human way 
by using complex symbols. You’re behaviorally modern.
 
South African archaeologists have told me, informally, that they’ve found 
many more such sites as Blombos Cave and that in the next decades they’ll 
reveal more evidence of early symbolism in South Africa. Archaeology is a 
slow business, but it produces amazing results. Anthropologists are some of 
the most patient people on earth.
Out of Africa: An Epic Migration
Earlier in this chapter, I mention that after 30,000 years ago AMHss was 
the only hominid left in the world with the exception of the Neanderthals. 
Neanderthals now can tell anthropologists a lot about modernity.
Anthropologists agree that AMHss emerged from Africa after about 100,000 
years ago in a global migration of epic proportions. These beings were human-
kind’s ancestors, and the proof is in man’s very genes. This multimillennium 
story of survival and long-distance travel in the ancient world eclipses anything 
ever cranked out of Hollywood. It begins with an exodus from Africa and ends 
with people colonizing the Arctic and Polynesia. Figure 8-1 in Chapter 8 shows 
the main routes of migration.
What do Neanderthals have to do with it? Well, as behaviorally and anatomi-
cally modern humans migrated across the globe, they found that not every 
possible path was new. Emerging from Africa, AMHss found hominids already 
occupying the various ecosystems of the Old World (basically the world excluding 

123
Chapter 7: It’s Good to Be Home: Homo sapiens sapiens, Our Biological Species
North and South America, which weren’t reached by humans until around 15,000 
years ago), from Europe all the way east to China. Equally strange is that these 
hominids weren’t anatomically or behaviorally modern; they were proto-
humans, ancestors of the first hominids to move out of Africa almost two mil-
lion years before AMHss did. (See Chapter 6 for more on proto-humans.)
Taking a closer look at Neanderthals
Although Neanderthals (hominids that lived in Europe and the Near East from 
about 300,000 to 30,000 years ago) behaved and looked a lot like folks today, 
they were also different. Anthropologist Trenton W. Holliday has written that 
they were a “hyper-polar” hominid, adapted for the cold of ice-age Europe. 
Their anatomical and behavioral characteristics include
 
 A heavily built, stocky, heat-conserving body
 
 Cranial capacity meeting or even exceeding that of AMHss (but remem-
ber, brain volume doesn’t necessarily indicate intelligence; see the 
“Brain matter matters” sidebar for more info)
 
 Heavily stressed teeth and bones indicating use of the body as a tool, 
periodic starvation, and frequent injury
 
 Simple stone tools with no compelling evidence for complex symbolism
You can see that the Neanderthals had brains as big as modern man’s but little 
symbolism; they had stone tools more complex than any other creature — 
you’d need about a decade to figure out how to make Neanderthal tools from 
stone — but the tools were simple compared to those of AMHss. Neanderthals 
are an enigma because they’re so much like humans today, yet so different.
Figure 7-1 compares a typical Neanderthal skull with a typical AMHss skull.

Getting Neanderthals and AMHss together
What happened when AMHss bands met indigenous folk like the Neanderthals? 
Were their interactions peaceful or violent? Did they interbreed or kill one 
another? Do humans carry Neanderthal DNA in their bodies today? The best 
answers come from examining two competing theories about the interaction 
of AMHss and the species (such as the Neanderthals of Europe) they encoun-
tered: Multiregional Continuity Theory and Replacement Theory.
Multiregional Continuity Theory
The Multiregional Continuity Theory states that in each of the regions occu-
pied by the first hominids to move out of Africa, Archaic populations — 
which preceded AMHss by almost two million years — evolved into AMHss 
somewhat independently. That is, from China to the Near East, populations of 
Archaics all independently evolved toward the characteristics of AMHss.
To support this theory, proponents provide one main piece of evidence: 
According to them, hominid populations in each area occupied by the first 
Archaic Homo sapiens out of Africa developed unique physical traits that 
humans still exhibit today.
That is, Archaics settled into their respective regions, such as the Far East, 
India and Pakistan, the Near East, and Europe and then independently devel-
oped into AMHss in each of those areas. Multiregional Continuity theorists 
contend that regional characteristics, like Neanderthal characteristics in modern 
Europeans and Archaic features in East Asians, support this hypothesis.
The major problem with this theory is that few biologists (or physical anthro-
pologists) buy the idea that these separate populations would all evolve toward 
the same ultimate AMHss form. This is such a serious flaw in the argument 
that some Multiregional Continuity theorists have proposed what they call 
Soft Replacement, the idea that, yes, AMHss evolved first in Africa and spread 
into already-inhabited regions, but then mated with the indigenous Archaics, 
producing the regional variants you see today.
Well, maybe. This scenario is possible, but many anthropologists believe 
they have a much better theory, one that’s supported by many — and many 
different — lines of evidence: Replacement Theory.
Replacement Theory
In contrast to Multiregional Continuity Theory, Replacement Theory (also 
known as the Out of Africa model) says that AMHss first evolved in Africa 
and then spread out from it after 100,000 years ago, replacing the Archaic 
populations that they encountered from Europe to China. Most Replacement 

125
Chapter 7: It’s Good to Be Home: Homo sapiens sapiens, Our Biological Species
theorists don’t care whether AMHss engaged in a little “soft replacement” 
with the Archaics they encountered. For these anthropologists, the fact that 
AMHss replaced the Archaics in every way is what’s most important.
The evidence for Replacement is pretty good and based on multiple, 
independent lines of evidence:
 
 In the fossil record, most physical anthropologists don’t see the ancient, 
regional variations that the Continuity model demands.
 
 In the fossil record, archaic skeleton traits disappear rapidly after the 
introduction of AMHss. In Europe, for example, only 10,000 years after 
AMHss appears, the Neanderthals go extinct after 170,000 years of 
Neanderthal survival in Europe!
 
 Archaic tool types disappear rapidly and are replaced with AMHss tool 
types.
 
 Symbolism first appears in Africa and spreads, also replacing the 
distinctly nonsymbolic archaeological traces of Archaic life.
 
 Genetic studies show that modern populations outside Africa are very 
similar to one another, indicating that everyone outside Africa emerged 
from the continent (and then diverged into regional groups) relatively 
recently.
 
 Studies show that humans carry very little Neanderthal DNA, if any, so 
even if Neanderthals and AMHss did interbreed, it didn’t matter in the 
long run.
Evidence for what some call the mitochondrial Eve also supports Replacement 
Theory. Because the DNA of any life form accumulates changes over time at a 
rather predictable and known rate, comparing the DNA of two closely related 
but different species can show how far back in time they diverged in time; 
species like wolves and dogs, for example, have pretty similar DNA, but spe-
cies like whales and hippos, which share a common ancestor many millions 
of years ago, have very different DNA. In humans, the study of mitochondrial 
DNA (or mtDNA, a kind of DNA passed from mother to offspring) has allowed 
some researchers to estimate when modern humans outside Africa began to 
diverge from African populations — from a founding Mitochondrial Eve popula-
tion. Not surprisingly, that date comes in around 100,000 years ago. This is just 
one more line of evidence suggesting that some very fundamental changes for 
humanity happened in Africa about 100,000 years ago.
In short, the bulk of the most recent data strongly supports Replacement 
Theory. No one really knows how most of the AMHss/Archaic interactions 
went, but in the long run, the anatomically and behaviorally modern AMHss 
simply out-competed the Archaics.

126
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
A theoretical compromise?
As always in anthropology, just as things look simple they get complicated. 
Basically, some anthropologists feel that the either/or choice between the 
Multiregional Continuity and Replacement theories is a false choice — that 
both can be accommodated to a degree with a subtler model of modern 
human origins. They suggest that although AMHss did move out of Africa 
around 100,000 years ago, significant interbreeding between these colonists 
and the people they encountered could have occurred and led to AMHss in 
each region. My opinion is that the Replacement model is more compelling, 
but there’s plenty of room for debate. The essence of good science is a will-
ingness to be open to reinterpretation when the evidence doesn’t convince 
everyone of the same thing.
The Origins of Language: The Social 
Grooming Theory
Anatomically, humans have been about the same creature for something like 
100,000 years. But in that time human culture has changed a great deal. In 
part, the changes had to do with adapting to new environments as human 
bands migrated across the globe. (See Chapter 8 for details on these migrations). 
Because culture, as I define it in Chapters 3 and 12, is socially transmitted (rather 
than biologically; it doesn’t ride on the genes, but passes through language from 
one generation to the next), you need to look at the origins of language.
A Portuguese half-human? Neanderthals and you
Are you part Neanderthal? Some anthropolo-
gists say yes, but for most, the answer is no: The 
Neanderthals were an evolutionary dead end.
At the Portuguese site of Lagar Velho, a 
25,000-year-old skeleton shows characteris-
tics of both Neanderthals and Modern humans. 
Some say it’s just a stocky Modern. Others 
believe that it’s the smoking-gun evidence for 
Neanderthal-Modern interbreeding, putting 
Neanderthal blood into every European today.
But although Lagar Velho is an interesting 
case, most researchers agree the bulk of 
the archaeological, genetic, and fossil evi-
dence doesn’t support a significant amount of 
Neanderthal/Modern interbreeding. One of the 
most respected authorities, British archaeolo-
gist Clive Gamble, has said that for him the case 
is closed and the mystery solved: Moderns 
out-competed and replaced the Neanderthals. 
Lagar Velho is, at the most, a very late, last 
flicker of Neanderthal genes in Europe.

127
Chapter 7: It’s Good to Be Home: Homo sapiens sapiens, Our Biological Species
So much has been written about the origins of language that, back in the ’50s, 
one prominent journal of prehistory actually refused to take any more papers 
on the subject; it was all speculation, the editors reasoned, and anthropology 
needed more time to study the matter. That time has passed now, and I think 
anthropology has come a long, long way. Today the most compelling theory 
of the origins of language is based on an evolutionary model, and I think it’s 
the best around; to tell the truth, I’m not even going to mention the others 
because I don’t think they carry the weight of this one. This very persuasive 
model is anthropologist Robin Dunbar’s social grooming hypothesis.
The social grooming hypothesis is that social primates maintain their connec-
tions and relationships largely through grooming: picking insects and debris out 
of other primates’ hair and generally showing them consideration. That groom-
ing, Dunbar argues, became more complex through time as hominid social group 
sizes increased. Noting that primate brain size is larger in larger primate social 
groups, Dunbar reconstructed the following hominid group sizes through time (I 
discuss these hominid types in more detail in Chapter 6):
 
 Australopithecines (from about 6 million years ago to about two million 
years ago) lived in groups of about 60 individuals.
 
 Early Homo (about 2 million years ago) lived in groups of about 80 
individuals.
 
 Homo erectus (from about 2 million years ago to about 300,000 years 
ago) lived in groups of about 110 individuals.
 
 Early Modern Homo sapiens (after about 100,000 years ago) lived, and 
traditionally continue to live, in groups of about 150 individuals.
Dunbar’s hypothesis is that as these group sizes increased for various reasons, 
language increasingly replaced physical grooming. Language, Dunbar argues, 
can convey a lot more information more rapidly than physical grooming, and it 
can address more than one individual at a time.
Dunbar hasn’t convinced everyone in anthropology that he’s entirely right, 
and of course talking doesn’t leave much of an archaeological trace, so the 
hypothesis is hard to prove one way or the other. But many anthropologists, 
me included, think that he’s onto something and that this concept may be the 
strongest candidate theory of the origins of language so far.
 
Humans aren’t the only animals that can evolve language; one primate spe-
cies (Homo) has done it, so why not others? In 2004, German anthropologists 
reported a case of commenting among macaques (a kind of monkey) in which 
one macaque appeared to observe social interactions in a distant group and 
then make an utterance, a sort of comment about that group to its own group. 
This noise was different from an alarm call or other common communications; 

128
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
it really seemed to be one macaque talking about what the other group was 
doing. As in many cases, anthropology will have to study this occurrence 
closely to verify it, but if it’s true, it’s a fascinating reminder that humans 
aren’t so different from all other animals.
The Origins of the Modern Mind
According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, “Perhaps no aspect of 
mind is more familiar or more puzzling than consciousness and our conscious 
experience of self and world.” So consciousness is a concept that should be 
handled carefully. Still, a clear difference exists between being conscious and 
unconscious, and even though science hasn’t completely delineated what 
consciousness is, it’s clearly important.
 
For my purposes in this book, consciousness is the uniquely human capacity 
for self-contemplation. The question is how did this come to be? The answer is 
rooted in evolution.
The evolution of consciousness: 
Two models
Consciousness — basically, self-awareness — is clearly a major part of being 
human. Losing consciousness robs you of many distinctly human qualities, like 
the ability to respond to a question in detail with all the nuances of human lan-
guage. Humans may be the most self-aware and self-conscious living things — 
so self-conscious, in fact, that they sometimes drive themselves crazy with the 
continual rehashing of memories and ideas that other animals are, perhaps, 
blissfully free of. Of course, many animals have some self-awareness, and 
chimpanzees can recognize themselves in mirrors, but it’s in humanity that 
this self-awareness is most radically developed.
So how did this consciousness, this obsessive self-awareness, come about? 
Archaeologists have two models for the evolution of modern consciousness, 
which I summarize in the following sections. Just remember, these models 
are the cutting edge of thought on the origins and evolution of modern con-
sciousness. I see good in both of them, but they’re so different that I don’t 
think they can both be entirely correct, and I’m excited to see how they pan 
out over the next few decades.

129
Chapter 7: It’s Good to Be Home: Homo sapiens sapiens, Our Biological Species
From episodic to theoretic consciousness: the Donald model
Psychologist Merlin Donald produced the first truly evolutionary model for 
the origins of modern consciousness in his 1991 book, Origins of the Modern 
Mind. Basically, Donald’s model says that the evolution of consciousness came 
in a series of drastic changes in the mind’s way of storing and representing its 
experiences, with each of these revolutions yielding a new state of consciousness. 
Donald proposed four types of consciousness in hominid evolution:
 
 Episodic consciousness (that of all primates before the genus Homo) was 
the original primate state, characterized by short-term and small-space 
memory. Such limited memory prevented this kind of consciousness 
from shuffling ideas, which limited deep contemplation and innovation, 
resulting in a bubble of consciousness.
 
 Mimetic consciousness (originating around 2 million years ago with the 
appearance of the genus Homo), was characterized by longer and finer-
grained memories and communication based on bodily gestures (such 
as miming) and simple vocalizations. These changes allowed for slightly 
more complex culture and deeper contemplation and idea innovation.
 
 Mythic consciousness (originating with rich symbol use more than 
100,000 years ago) was characterized by the use of myths and long nar-
ratives to organize the increasingly complex volume and diversity of 
ideas in the mind.
 
 Theoretic consciousness (originating with the invention of objective 
science in Greece about 2,000 years ago) was characterized by seeking 
natural rather than supernatural explanations for the world.
Cognitive fluidity: the Mithen model
Archaeologist Steven Mithen produced the second truly evolutionary model 
for the origins of modern consciousness in his 1996 book, The Prehistory of 
the Mind. Basically, Mithen’s model says that the evolution of modern con-
sciousness came about as the mind forged new links between previously 
isolated intelligence modules, or kinds of thinking. The four intelligences, 
according to Mithen, were
 
 Social intelligence, used to manage complex interpersonal primate 
relationships
 
 Technical intelligence, used to manipulate tools
 
 Linguistic intelligence, used to manage complex communication
 
 Natural history intelligence, used to understand cause-and-effect 
relationships

130
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
Mithen’s model goes like this: By 4 million years ago, our African proto-
human ancestors (the Australopithecines, which I cover in Chapter 4) pos-
sessed the well-developed social intelligence expected in groups of large 
social primates. By 2 million years ago, hominid life changed significantly as 
early Homo began using stone tools to butcher carcasses scavenged from 
big-cat kill sites, significantly sharpening their technical intelligence (by 
making tools) and natural-history intelligence (by finding carcasses). Fully 
fluid communication between intelligences began in the last 200,000 years 
only, promoted by language, which became more complex as social groups 
became larger and more complex. Bits of information about one kind of intel-
ligence, Mithen argues, began to include communication about other kinds of 
intelligence, and the cross-pollination of ideas sparked a massive revolution 
of creativity that eventually led to the modern mind.
The roots of myth
Myths, according to Merlin Donald’s theory (see “From episodic to theoretic 
consciousness: the Donald model” earlier in this chapter), arose as a way 
of organizing the contents of humans’ increasingly complex and memory-
crowded minds. Narrative in structure, myths typically tell what the universe 
is like and what to do about it, often with cautionary tales. Unfortunately for 
archaeologists, spoken myths don’t leave much of an archaeological trace, and 
no one can be sure when they first arose. But anthropologists can be reason-
ably sure that humans were using myths at the time of cave art, which flour-
ished in Europe around 30,000 years ago. Many archaeologists believe that, 
apart from being decorative, cave art depicts at least four main concepts:
 
 Shamanic voyages, wherein shamans (traditional healers) traveled to a 
spirit world to fix problems such as poor health in the material world. 
Traditional shamans continue to do this today, recording their voyages 
in rock shelters. (See Chapter 16 for more on shamans.)
 
 Hunting magic depicting scenes people wanted to see, such as large 
herds of fat, vulnerable animals.
 
 Myths or narrative parables instructing people how to live properly.
 
 Rites of passage, which ritually ushered people into various stages of 
life. These ceremonies were then recorded on cave walls.
Although this cave art dates to 30,000 or so years ago in Europe, remember 
that it probably originated 100,000 years ago and in Africa; anthropologists 
rely on the European evidence because it’s been studied for so long.

131
Chapter 7: It’s Good to Be Home: Homo sapiens sapiens, Our Biological Species
The roots of ritual
According to the late anthropologist Roy Rappaport, rituals evolved as a kind 
of social glue meant to remind humans of their shared basic core beliefs, or 
ultimate sacred postulates. Exactly when ritual first appeared is also hard to 
pin down; many rituals in the present leave little material trace, and you can 
assume the same was possible in prehistory. But at least two archaeological 
traces seem to clearly indicate ritual:
 
 Complex burials, in which people were prepared and maybe even 
equipped for an afterlife with tools, food, and other items placed into 
the grave. These rituals first appear around 30,000 years ago but may 
well predate this period.
 
 Organized religion, in which civilizations clearly organized religious 
ritual with temples, pyramids, and public displays meant to unite the 
citizenry.
The roots of symbolism
You have to remember just how complex and important symbols really are. At 
least two kinds of symbolism are critical to the issue of behavioral modernity:
 
 Shallow symbols, which can only stand for one other thing — for 
example, a monkey’s aerial-predator-warning screech, as opposed to its 
ground-predator-warning screech.
 
 Deep symbols, which can stand for many different things, perhaps 
even simultaneously — for example, humans can say “That guy is a real 
snake,” and other humans understand that he’s not a physical snake, 
but that he has snakelike characteristics.
Shallow symbols are pretty common in animal communication, and their 
real significance isn’t clear until you consider how different they are from 
the deep symbols that can stand for several different ideas. What these deep 
symbols really reveal is the capacity for metaphor; however complex any 
other animal communication system is, none of them use metaphor. But 
humans can’t seem to get away from it; even saying I can’t “get away from it” 
is a metaphor. Metaphor is ingrained in our language, and its power to foster 
complex and cross-pollinated thoughts is tremendous. See Chapter 13 for 
more on symbolism.

here do you come from? I mean way back, centuries ago? Your family

on a map, a country that may not even exist anymore. But how about the people 
who came from there? Where did they come from? And how did they get there? 
Ultimately, everyone’s roots reach back thousands of years to Africa; Chapter 
7 tells you that. This chapter tells you about what happened next: how humans 
(officially, anatomically modern Homo sapiens sapiens, or AMHss) adapted to 
the multitude of new ecosystems they encountered, how they survived them by 
inventing everything from igloos to dogsleds and sailing canoes to fishing nets, 
and a little about how and when they migrated into and colonized such forbid-

Migration and Survival: The Decoupling 
of Behavior from Biology
Pay attention here; I’m giving a quiz later. Just kidding. But really, this is one 
of the main lessons of anthropology and of this entire book!
The first thing to keep in mind is that for a long time — from at least 100,000 
years ago to about 10,000 years ago — most human beings were foragers, 

134
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
or people who moved from place to place to gather and hunt for their daily 
food and water. Sedentary farm life just wasn’t an option until farming was 
invented around 10,000 years ago. And even then, not everyone took up farm-
ing; for thousands of years, many people continued to forage, trekking thou-
sands of miles across the Arctic or voyaging on the open Pacific.
But why? Prehistoric humans moved for lots of reasons, including
 
 Resource exploration: Foragers are always interested in what other 
resources may be available just out of sight.
 
 Social fission: Some foragers move to get away from neighbors with 
whom they have bad blood; others travel to disperse a population 
that’s getting too high for the resources in the immediate environment 
to support.
 
 Incidental migration: Foragers often migrate in pursuit of their prey 
animals — like herds of mammoth — who are also moving across land-
scapes to take advantage of new resources like expanding grassland in a 
changing ecosystem.
For these reasons (and others people may never know), humanity spread far 
and wide after 100,000 years ago.
Human migration required adaptation to survive in new environments. As a 
noun, an adaptation is an object that allows survival in that new environment, 
such as warm fur clothing for a cold environment or a new kind of sail for your 
sailing vessel. All other animals adapt unconsciously and with their bodies 
(which either do or do not have traits that allow survival in new environ-
ments); on the other hand, human bodies are biologically frail and could 
hardly survive the Arctic or the Sahara.
But humans have invented ways to live in both places, for thousands of years 
and in fine health; humanity has invented adaptations to places that our 
biology couldn’t withstand. In fact, this is one of the most distinctive char-
acteristics about humanity: It proactively chooses to make and invent new 
adaptations. Humanity, then, adapts not only with its body but also with its 
inventions, be they artifacts or social customs. This is one of the most impor-
tant lessons anthropology has learned about humanity: For good or ill, human-
ity has evolved ways of adapting that have decoupled behavior from biology.
The rest of this chapter is really here to give you some examples of the diver-
sity of these two main types of fascinating adaptations:
 
 Artifacts: Physical adaptations, like a warm coat or a sun-deflecting hat
 
 Behaviors: Cultural adaptations, like the practice of committing suicide 
when one can no longer support the foraging group and is a burden on 
the already-meager resources

135
 Chapter 8: Hunting, Fishing, Sailing, and Sledding: The Spread of Humanity
One way to begin imagining the staggering history of early human global 
migration is to consider the environments people were moving into and what 
material and social adaptations could have made those new environments 
survivable. You can do this fascinating thought-exercise by considering the 
variety of environments humanity was exploring and adapting to in Figure 8-1, 
which generally sketches out the various dispersals of humanity around the 
world after about 100,000 years ago. The routes shown are pretty general, but 
keep in mind some major barriers, such as the Himalayan mountain chain. A 
couple of other things to keep in mind: By 100,000 years ago, the continents 
were in their present positions, so you don’t need to wonder about South 
America shifting around or anything. Also, during ice ages ocean water was 
locked up in glaciers, so water levels were about 300 feet lower than they are 
today, thus making coastlines extend out farther. If you need a visual of this 
extension, you can check out sahultime.monash.edu.au/explore.html 
for a series of maps showing these changes in the coastlines of Australia.
Considering the principles of why and how humanity emerged from Africa, 
take a closer look at some of our species’ thrillingly ingenious methods of 
survival in this epic of epics: the colonization of the globe by our prehistoric 
ancestors.

The Colonization of Australasia
The initial colonization of Australia is a mind-boggling odyssey of hunting 
and foraging among the island chains of Southeast Asia toward the open 
ocean leading to Australia. Somehow, people invented some kind of watercraft 
and used them to hop from island to island, until they reached The Big One: 
Australia itself. Then, they trekked into the desert interior of this immense 
continent.
The mysteries of Australian colonization
Something’s up Down Under. When humanity first came to the continent of 
Australia is one of the great mysteries of archaeology. Many sites date ear-
lier than 30,000 years old, but none seem to be definitively dateable because 
the strata have been disturbed a little or the method being used to date the 
site is at the edge of its useful range — something’s always a little off. Still, 
anthropologists are confident that Australia was colonized well over 40,000 
years ago. Main finds that make that clear:
 
 The Lake Mungo skeleton, found in 1974, has recently been redated to 
just over 60,000 years ago.
 
 In 2002, rock art at the Nauwalabila I site in Northern Australia was 
dated to more than 50,000 years ago.
 
 Rock art at the Carpenter’s Gap site is securely dated to about 40,000 
years ago.
Whatever the ambiguities with some of the data from these sites, they all 
point in the same direction: to occupation of Australia at least by 40,000 
years ago, and maybe much earlier. How much earlier? One claim, published 
in 1996, was for a site dated to more than 175,000 years ago. That would be 
even earlier than AMHss, and few people — myself included — buy it. I want 
much better evidence (and multiple lines of it) all pointing in the same direc-
tion before I accept such an early date.
 
Only 50 years ago, many thought Australia was colonized no earlier than 8,700 
years ago, but today data indicate it was colonized at least three times earlier 
than that. This is a pattern in archaeology; dates for the earliest circumstance 
of something — like the colonization of a region or the invention of an artifact — 
constantly get pushed back as new sites surface. This pattern doesn’t mean that 
archaeology is rudderless and constantly rewriting its books, however. What 
it does do, like any good science, is update what it knows and move on. In this 
case, the update is pretty major, but it’s still just an update, not a condemna-
tion of all archaeology.

137
 Chapter 8: Hunting, Fishing, Sailing, and Sledding: The Spread of Humanity
What anthropologists know for sure
Despite the mysteries of Australian colonization, a few facts are certain:
 
 Australia was colonized by 40,000 years ago.
 
 Australia was colonized by AMHss, as evidenced by their skeletons.
 
 Australia was colonized by behaviorally modern Homo sapiens sapiens, 
as evidenced by their cave art, which indicates symbolism.
Reconstruction of sea levels reveals that at the time Australia was colonized, 
it was already an island; therefore, the colonizers must have used some kind 
of watercraft, such as rafts or canoes. No such artifacts have been found 
(though that doesn’t mean they don’t exist), but water crossings beyond the 
sight of land would have been necessary, so archaeologists infer that early 
Australians used watercraft.
Another Grand Exploration: The 
Colonization of the New World
Yet another wild, hair-raising, and unlikely story of prehistoric migration and 
colonization is that of the colonization of the New World (North and South 
America). Combined, this region opened up more than 40 million square kilo-
meters (more than 15 million square miles) to humanity, who swiftly spread 
to inhabit every conceivable ecological niche — the grassy Great Plains, 
the icy Arctic, the windswept coast of Peru, the steaming jungles of Central 
America, the hardwood forests of Appalachia, the Mississippi basin, the 
blustery Pacific Northwest, the arid Great Basin, and just about everywhere 
in-between. How people survived to become today’s Native Americans is a 
staggering tale this section can only begin to cover; however, it can give you 
an idea of what was involved.
Dueling hypotheses: A couple 
of migration theories
The real mysteries about the colonization of the Americas lie in the timing and 
circumstances of the earliest occupants. At one time, a book like this would 
have delved deeply into the question of where the first Americans came from, 
but today that mystery is solved. Dental, genetic, linguistic, and archaeological 
data all clearly link the native peoples of the Americas with the native peoples 
of Northeast Asia: specifically, Siberia.

138
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
Although this link was first proposed as early as the 16th century, as people 
made the obvious connections between native people of these areas, the 
many lines of evidence have come together only in the last century to sup-
port this common-sense notion. A recent widely published hypothesis — that 
Native Americans came across the sea ice from Europe (about 18,000 years 
ago) — relies on the scantest evidence and isn’t convincing any archaeologists 
I know or know of. Right now, all lines of evidence point to Northeast Asia. 
From there, humans moved toward North America by crossing a land bridge 
(between eastern Siberia and Western Alaska) called Beringia. During the ice 
ages (which didn’t end until about 10,000 years ago), Beringia was an expan-
sive vegetated tundra grazed by herds of megafauna (large animals), such as 
the wooly mammoth. After crossing into Alaska, however, the question is 
where he colonists went next, as we’ll see in the following sections.
Ice-Free Corridor hypothesis
The Ice-Free Corridor hypothesis suggests that migrants entered the Americas 
between two great ice sheets that covered Canada until about 12,000 years 
ago. The Ice-Free Corridor model proposes that as the ice sheets melted due 
to the end of the ice age, a broad corridor opened between them, allowing 
plants to colonize this strip of land connecting today’s western Canada with 
the United States’ Great Plains. Large grazing animals such as bison and 
mammoths migrated south to feed upon these plants, and bands of human 
foragers followed.
According to some geographers and glaciologists, the big problem with the 
Ice-Free Corridor hypothesis is that so much water would have poured off the 
mile-thick ice sheets that the newly exposed ground between them couldn’t 
have stabilized quickly enough for the plants to take root, let alone support 
grazers. Rather, the corridor would have been a no man’s land of glacial out-
wash, blasted by roaring rivers that changed course unpredictably. These 
folks maintain that nobody came through the corridor until many thousands 
of years after the ice melted, the water drained off, soil stabilized, and plants 
took root.
The Ice-Free Corridor model is usually proposed by the Clovis-First theorists, 
who believe that the first people into the Americas bore distinctive stone tools 
called Clovis Points. For a long time, this theory was generally accepted among 
archaeologists, but in the last two decades new data (see the following two 
sections) have strongly suggested that Clovis wasn’t first at all.
Coastal migration hypothesis
In contrast to the Ice-Free Corridor hypothesis, the coastal migration hypoth-
esis proposes that migrants traveled ever southward down the coasts of 
Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and then California. At least 
at first; eventually, they also headed east further into the North American 

139
 Chapter 8: Hunting, Fishing, Sailing, and Sledding: The Spread of Humanity
continent by following the big rivers that empty into the Pacific from north 
to south: the Fraser (near Vancouver, British Columbia), the Columbia, the 
Sacramento (at San Francisco Bay), and others.
The first evidence for this hypothesis is a coastal route that many people 
used to rule out simply because they thought the great ice sheets extended 
far out to sea, creating a 300-foot ice-wall barrier that no humans could 
migrate along and survive. But recently, glacial refugia (islands that weren’t 
iced over) have come to light; scientists have confirmed these islands were 
actually forested, serving as refuges from the worst conditions. Alaska’s On 
Your Knees Cave (yes, that’s its real name) contained bear remains more 
than 15,000 years old; people argue that if the refuges could have supported 
bears, they could have supported equally omnivorous humans.
Although the tide of opinion currently favors the coastal migration hypothesis, 
keep in mind that it’s going to be tough to prove. When the ice sheets melted 
by 10,000 years ago, the runoff poured into the oceans, raising the sea level. 
Today the water is 300 feet deeper than it was when the coastal migrants 
presumably made their way south, so remains of their campsites are under-
water. Diving more than about 100 feet starts to get really complicated, so 
SCUBA survey is a tough proposition.
Just the facts, ma’am
I personally strongly favor the coastal migration hypothesis, but whatever 
the case, people were definitely in the Americas well over 10,000 years ago. 
Three archaeological sites make that clear:
 
 The Monte Verde site in Chile is securely radiocarbon dated to more 
than 12,000 years ago. (See Chapter 5 for more on radiocarbon dating.)
 
 Idaho’s Buhl skeleton is securely dated to 10,600 years ago.
 
 The Kennewick Man is securely dated to 9,400 years ago; though this 
date isn’t actually more than 10,000 years ago, it’s pointing in the right 
direction. If people reached southern Washington by 9,400 years ago, 
you can pretty safely bet they were into North America just 600 years 
before that. (See the nearby sidebar “The Kennewick controversy.”)
And the story keeps changing. A site in Oregon currently shows radiocarbon 
dates for human occupation spanning back to 14,300 years ago. If the dates 
pan out and the research holds up under the thorough scrutiny that’s the 
hallmark of good science, this will be the oldest well-accepted date for human 
occupation in North or South America. This find is exciting to say the least, 
but as anthropologists we’ll will have to wait for all the evidence to be 
reviewed by the scientific method before we begin rewriting the textbooks.

Igloos, Dogs, and Whalebone Knives: 
The Colonization of the Arctic
I love the Arctic. I’ve spent several winters there, taking in the harsh beauty 
while traveling on foot. I have always found it hard to survive even with my 
modern equipment and wondered how people with simpler gear did it thou-
sands of years ago. The archaeological record indicates that they did it like 
people worldwide have accomplished colonization time and again: with inge-
nuity, fortitude, and the ability to adapt.
The Kennewick controversy
In 1996, anthropologists found the partial skel-
eton of a human male eroding from the bank of 
the Columbia River in southwestern Washington 
state. Radiocarbon dated to about 9,400 years 
ago, these bones were some of the oldest 
human remains in North America (the oldest 
are from Buhl, Idaho, dated to almost 11,000 years 
ago) and excited immediate interest. The skeleton 
had a stone point imbedded in its hip, indicating an 
interesting life history, but something else brought 
the media. The anthropologist who first examined 
the bones said that they had “Caucasian” features. 
Because all prior evidence suggested that Native 
Americans ultimately came from Asia, the word 
Caucasian — used in common speech to mean 
white — ignited a tremendous legal battle.
Scientists wanted to study the DNA; Native 
Americans (who didn’t believe the skeleton was 
white) wanted the remains for proper reburial; 
and other groups (including white supremacist 
organizations) tried to lay claim to the remains 
for their own proper burial and fixed on the 
skeleton as proof that the Americas belonged 
to whites and not to the Native Americans, who 
clearly derived from Northeast Asia. The initial 
characterization of the remains as Caucasian 
stirred up a lot of bad blood. In the strictest 
terms, people of the mountainous Caucasus 
region of central Russia (Caucasians) may in 
fact be related to the Northeast Asian ancestors 
of the Native Americans. In fact, later studies 
showed that the skeleton was of Asian descent. 
Undeterred, the white supremacists still want 
the skeleton. The Native American tribal coali-
tion still wants the bones for reburial, and some 
scientists still want the material for analysis.
One reason Native Americans are so set on 
getting the remains is that they have endured 
archaeologists digging up their ancestors’ skel-
etons for more than a century; imagine if some-
one went to your ancestors’ graveyards in, say, 
Scotland or Germany and started digging up 
your ancestors out of sheer interest without 
even asking permission! My impression is that 
anthropologists should turn the bones over to 
the Native Americans as a sign of goodwill. 
This gesture could lead to better collaboration 
between Native Americans and archaeolo-
gists, which would be good for everyone. Many 
Native Americans support archaeology but, of 
course, want to be involved in it and not studied 
like museum specimens.

141
 Chapter 8: Hunting, Fishing, Sailing, and Sledding: The Spread of Humanity
First arrivals
By 5,000 years ago, hardy humans had taken up life in the North American 
Arctic, hunting, fishing, and foraging as their predecessors had all the way 
from Siberia and across Beringia. Like all Arctic peoples, they were hunters, and 
they survived on seals, caribou, birds (and bird eggs, in the right season), 
and just about anything else the human body could metabolize. They also 
made distinctive artifacts, including
 
 Ivory carvings of animals, including polar bears
 
 Wooden figurines from driftwood
 
 Harpoons — heavy and simple but effective — for catching seals
 
 Ice cleats for strapping to sealskin boots
By 1,000 years ago, however, new inventions and artifacts appear in the 
western Arctic just before their rapid and wide spread all the way east across 
thousands of miles of ice and snow to Greenland. This was the origin of the 
Thule expansion.
The Thule expansion
The Thule expansion was an active migration of humans from the western 
to the eastern Arctic after about 1,500 years ago. The name comes from an 
archaeological site in Greenland, where these people’s artifacts were first 
found. Their migration was characterized and made possible by a number of 
distinctive inventions:
 
 Dog sleds, sometimes with runners made of frozen fish
 
 Effective watercraft, including the kayak, a boat made of hide stretched 
over a framework of animal bones and/or driftwood
 
 Specialized whale-hunting harpoons for taking the largest sea mam-
mals, which may feed a whole village for a whole winter
 
 Igloos, snow houses that could be built in a few hours by using a long, 
distinctive whalebone knife
Imagining the northern lights, the cracking ice, and the strange new crea-
tures, fish, and foxes the Thule folk would have met on their treks, I think 
their eastward expansion must have been one of humankind’s greatest and 
most audacious adventures.

The Voyage of Ru and Hina: The 
Colonization of the Pacific
Between 3,000 years ago and 1,500 years ago, the ancient Polynesians voyaged 
throughout the Pacific, building a habit of exploration typified by the legend 
of the exploring siblings Ru and Hina (who, having discovered every scrap of 
land in the Pacific, looked to the moon, saw a new place to tread, and built a 
magical ship to take them there). The ancient Polynesians eventually colonized 
Tahiti, Easter Island, New Zealand, and Hawaii; just like everywhere else, this 
colonization effort was a masterpiece of adaptation. These peoples carefully 
shaped both technologies and cultures to make exploration and survival in the 
A native Alaskan winter feast
In February 2007, I was privileged to attend a 
Winter Feast on Alaska’s North Slope, 300 miles 
north of the Arctic Circle. The three-day festival 
called Kivgiq, hosted by Inupiat natives of North 
Alaska, centered on dances performed by mem-
bers of many communities across Arctic Canada 
and Alaska. As I watched, I learned that the 
feast and the dances were much more than just 
a big party: They were reminders of an ancient 
code, an ancient way of life that was important 
to get right because it kept people alive.
Fifteen drums at a time beat slowly, directing 
the subtle movements of dancers’ bodies, a 
shoulder shrug, an arm or wrist gently turned. 
The slow beat was the invitation to let go, to be 
taken by the spirit of the dance. After a time the 
pace and volume increased — BOOM BOOM 
BOOM . . . BOOM BOOM BOOM — accompa-
nied by wailing and chanting, as the dancers 
stamped their boots and locked their bodies 
in stiff postures of shock or terror. Sometimes 
they used syncopated paddling motions — 
the communal pursuit of a whale. Sometimes 
they hauled their arms joyfully toward their 
chests, pulling in a whale that would provide 
sustenance for a whole village and stave off 
starvation off for another season. The dances 
included pantomimes of hunger and plenty and 
respect for the land and its animals, the gravi-
tational center of this culture around which all 
else revolved.
These performances were as important to 
Inupiat survival as any harpoon or kayak; they 
were instructions for a proper life. I’d asked, 
“How did they survive here?” It was a question 
only a wholly urbanized person could ask. How 
did they survive here? Easy. Keep your popu-
lation low. Don’t mow down your resources. 
Manage the plants and animals so their popu-
lations will be healthy for your descendants, as 
your ancestors did for you. Be respectful of the 
land. It’s not rocket science.
And have a sense of humor! Some of the 
greatest applause at Kivgiq came for “Eskimo 
Elvis,” a dancer outfitted in a caped jumpsuit, 
sunglasses, and pompadour. “E” rocked the 
crowd with a fusion of Inupiat and Elvis moves 
complete with a karate-kick ending that sent 
the crowd through the roof. Kivgiq ended with 
solemnity, but laughing was just as important. 
Life is short, after all.

Pacific possible. The technologies included the double-hulled voyaging canoes 
and special methods of navigation (see more on this in the following section). 
The following section describes some more examples of human adaptation to 
the Pacific.
 
In 1947, the Norwegian adventurer Thor Heyerdahl and his crew drifted from 
Peru to Polynesia on a 40-foot log raft named Kon-Tiki to show that Polynesia 
could have been colonized by ancient South Americans. Though Heyerdahl’s 
feat was a bold adventure, no solid evidence suggests he was right; linguistic, 
DNA, and archaeological evidence all clearly show that the colonists of the 
Pacific originated in Southeast Asia, not South America.
The tools of the explorers
The earliest explorers of the Pacific were inventive people determined to 
survive their explorations. They didn’t sail haphazardly or simply drift with 
the currents; on the contrary, they planned their expeditions and carried 
artifacts to enable them to survive at sea and start a new life after they found 
land. Among their inventions were
 
 Double-hulled voyaging canoes up to 60 feet long and carrying up to 100 
people
 
 Pottery used to contain and cook foods on board
 
 Stone adzes, tools used to clear land for horticulture when the explorers 
found land
 
 Fish hooks made from shell and used to catch fish while underway
The society of the explorers
The Pacific explorers also invented cultural traditions to survive, which were 
just as important as any artifact. These traditions included
 
 An acceptance of risk: Although the explorers felt that life was precious, 
they acknowledged that bravery was often necessary at sea and that life 
could be unpredictable.
 
 A mythology of divine intervention: This system reassured voyagers 
that the gods did sometimes take pity, that every storm would eventu-
ally end, and that life would be good when they found land.
 
 A glorification of exploration: The greatest glory went to those who 
explored and found new land in which to raise the next generation. The 
tale of Ru and Hina exemplifies this belief.

144
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
Kavenga star path navigation
When the European explorers arrived in the Pacific 
in the 1700s, they marveled — if grudgingly — at 
the accuracy of native Polynesian navigators. 
Despite lacking (as the Europeans saw it) any 
instruments, charts, or knowledge of mathemat-
ics, native navigators were so competent that the 
Europeans took them aboard their own ships. The 
Europeans discovered that the natives navigated 
mainly by memory. Polynesian navigators, by rote 
memorization, knew when and where certain 
stars would come up and when and where they 
would go down, and that gave them a sort of clock 
as well as pointers to various directions on the 
horizon. A sailor would remember a trip from one 
island to another, not in the standard European 
measurement course degrees per leg of the 
voyage but as a series of stars to follow as they 
appeared and set — the star path, or “kavenga.” 
Native navigators also used the following meth-
ods to keep on course:
  Island location by swell direction: Just 
as a radar signal bounces off an airplane, 
ocean swells bounce off islands and come 
back against the prevailing currents in dis-
tinctive angles.
  Island location by flora and fauna: Natives 
knew that certain fish stayed nearer to 
islands than others, as did certain birds, 
flying insects, and types of seaweed. Even 
the water tasted different nearer islands 
than it did at high sea, and Polynesian navi-
gators were keen to all of these clues.
  Island location by steering for a screen 
rather than a speck: A single island in 
the vast Pacific really is a speck, but any 
island has a number of effects on the water 
that surrounds it, making it detectable by 
a number of means. A chain of islands, 
whose effects on the water run together, 
may make a 100-mile wide screen of island-
affected water; instead of aiming for any 
one island, navigators just had to hit the 
screen and then fine-tune their course for 
their ultimate destination.

A
fter two and a half million years of foraging, hunting, and gathering 
for their daily subsistence across the globe, about 10,000 years ago 
humans made a momentous discovery that would change nearly everything. 
It would lead to the establishment of cities, where once people had trekked 
across vast landscapes in search of food; it would lead to the development of 
armies and protracted warfare, where once conflicts were limited in duration 
and distance; and it would lead to the multifaceted evolution of civilization 
itself. This development was farming: growing food rather than pursuing it.
Because farming changed nearly everything and happened relatively recently 
in human prehistory (and because anthropologists have a good archaeologi-
cal record reflecting the origins of farming), I’m giving it a whole chapter 
in this book. Understanding the agricultural roots of today’s civilization is 
necessary if you want to understand how quite a bit of humanity lives today; 
in this chapter, I explain just what farming is and when and where it was first 
invented, as well as review some ideas about why it was invented and how it 
changed humanity for better and worse.
The Principle of Domestication
Farming is the domestication of plants and animals for human purposes. 
It’s based on the principle of domestication (defined in the next section), 
which essentially allows humans to control food by producing it as farmers 

146
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
rather than pursuing it as hunter–gatherers. As the following sections show, 
this shift in how humans get their food has had major consequences for the 
human species.
Cultural selection
Farming is better described as domestication, which is basically the control 
of plant and animal species for human benefit. The important concept in 
this definition is control; at some point in the evolution of certain plants and 
animals (like corn, sheep, cattle, or sweet potatoes), these species came to 
be under total control of humans. In evolutionary terms, humans became 
the ultimate selective agent on these species, determining which plant seeds 
would be sown to grow the next crop, for example, and what animals would 
be slaughtered for meat or kept alive as the parents of the next generation.
What’s important here is that the natural environment no longer determined 
which seeds would survive or which sheep would be selected against; 
humans did, and for their own purposes. In this way, the selective pressures 
on these plant and animal species shifted from natural selection to cultural 
selection. If Old McDonald liked his sheep to have long, curly fleece, he 
picked those with long, curly fleece to sire the next generation and perhaps 
slaughtered the others. If his wife preferred really large pumpkins to natu-
rally-occurring small ones, she’d be sure to plant the seeds of the larger ones 
rather than the smaller ones.
And that’s it. Domestication is basically selective breeding of plants and animals. 
It’s humanity becoming some species’ ultimate selective agent. It’s taking advan-
tage of the fact that some species can’t do anything about it if humans want to 
put an animal in a pen or control which seeds they use in the next planting.
 
Of course, not all species are amenable to domestication. Nobody has ever 
really succeeded in domesticating the big cats, for example (Siegfried and Roy 
notwithstanding); humanity tended to focus — for staple foods anyway — on 
easily domesticable species, like sheep. You may think wrangling the first 
wild mountain sheep would have been a sketchy affair, but surely even early 
people were smart enough to simply capture youngsters.
Effects of farming on society
A farming lifestyle has some major ramifications for human societies:
 
 Farming requires a degree of residential sedentism, or settlement. Plants 
and animals require tending, and crops need harvesting and processing. 

147
 Chapter 9: Old, Old McDonald: The Origins of Farming
This sedentism has many ripple effects — houses have to be more sub-
stantial to withstand use for years or generations at a time, and so on.
 
 Farming normally requires more intense food-processing technologies 
and processes than foraging; seeds require separation from chaff, crops 
need sowing and harvesting with special tools, grain has to be ground 
into flour, and so on.
 
 Farming requires more investment in a landscape than foraging. 
Irrigation ditches and fences are often necessary, and soil needs tilling, 
fertilizing, and so on.
 
 Finally, farming leads to a more developed sense of property than foraging; 
when people invest so much blood, sweat, and tears in a particular patch of 
ground, changes occur in the principle of sharing. This shift doesn’t mean 
that sharing ceases, but the concept of personal property becomes more 
developed and ingrained among farmers than among foragers.
These are general characteristics, and, as always, you can find exceptions. 
For example, not all foragers are highly mobile. On North America’s Pacific 
Northwest Coast, Native American foragers lived as sedentarily as some farm-
ers and at least as sedentarily as most horticulturalists for at least the last 3,000 
years, not because they were farmers but because they were able to subsist 
on the area’s plentiful salmon and sea mammals. Their environment was rich 
enough to support residential sedentism, so they quit moving around as much.
Plant domestication
In his book Guns, Germs and Steel, geographer/anthropologist Jared Diamond 
summarizes two unique features worth thinking about as you consider the 
origins of domestication, because the first domesticators would have needed 
to think about them as well:
 
 Plant domestication requires focus on very specific species because 
only some plants provide products — like fruit, seeds, or fibers — useful 
for human purposes.
 
 Plant domestication would require careful attention to dietary balance 
because plants are missing some nutritional elements found in a more 
varied diet.
Plant domestication normally has two main effects on the way plant species 
change through time:
 
 For most domesticated plant species, the plants being harvested are 
bigger than their wild predecessors; cultivators simply use the seeds from 

148
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
the biggest, best plants to grow the next crop. For example, domesticated 
limes are much bigger than the wild limes originally cultivated around 
2,500 years ago in Southeast Asia; in the same way, modern corncobs 
are huge compared to the original, finger-sized wild corncobs.
 
 Most domesticated plant species are easier to harvest than their wild 
brethren; cultivators chose to plant the species that require less effort 
to reap. For example, the seeds of ancient, wild wheat (first domesticated 
more than 10,000 years ago in the Near East) were hard to knock off the 
plant, but over time early domesticators selected for strains in which 
the seed was more easily separated from the plant.
 
Plant species that don’t naturally occur in a given landscape are called exotics 
and are often evidence of human introduction. This represents at least human 
intervention or interaction with the species, if not necessarily indicating 
domestication.
Plant domesticates can also be selected for taste, preservability, transport-
ability, or other characteristics that might be hard to detect archaeologically.
 
Plant domestication can be labor-intensive because living plants need protec-
tion from pests (both plant pests such as weeds and animal pests such as 
crows), and harvested foods need storage (like grain, which must be kept dry 
and free of mold and relatively free of rats and mice).
Check out Table 9-2 later in the chapter for more on the origins of some 
common domesticated plants.
Animal domestication
Animals aren’t all that easy to domesticate, either; Jared Diamond also points 
out that domestication-candidate animals must have
 
 A relatively good disposition toward humans (which is why big-cat and 
grizzly-bear taming haven’t really worked)
 
 A relatively short life span (so the animals have plenty of offspring — for 
example, rabbits or chickens) if the human investment into the species 
is going to pay off. If our food species lived as long as we did before they 
could be slaughtered and eaten, it would be tough to keep up the food 
supply. Luckily, most of the animal species we eat reproduce quickly, 
providing lots of offspring at the same time.
 
 A flexible diet, because in captivity the animal must be able to eat what-
ever the humans provide, which won’t necessarily be what it would eat 
in nature

149
 Chapter 9: Old, Old McDonald: The Origins of Farming
Also, animal domestication normally has at least two main effects on the 
actual bodies of species under domestication:
 
 If the animals bear horns, people normally select for smaller and/or 
differently shaped horns, so the animal will be a little less dangerous.
 
 Most domesticated animals are a little smaller than their wild counterparts 
because humans tend to select for offspring that are a little easier to 
handle.
Domesticated animal populations normally have an age/sex profile different 
than a wild age/sex profile; for example, domesticated herds may have only 
a handful of adult males (for use as studs — other males are slaughtered), 
but most females are kept alive to bear the next generation and to provide 
milk and other secondary products. This setup is a population profile very 
different than what occurs naturally (where there are more than a handful 
of males, for example.) See Table 9-1 later in the chapter for a list of some 
common domesticated animals and their origins.
Principles of Horticulture
Keep in mind that farming was often preceded by a kind of low-intensity form 
of domestication called horticulture. Horticulture is hard to define — a recent 
paper discusses at least ten definitions, which I won’t go into here — but 
generally refers to farming on a smaller scale than full-scale farmers, with 
simpler technologies and less overall emphasis on farming. (That is, some 
foraging — more than in farming societies — provides staple foods.) I discuss 
the details of horticulture a little more closely in the sections that follow.
Distinctive characteristics of horticulture
 
Although horticulture did precede farming in some areas, in others horticul-
ture continues to thrive. In New Guinea, people have been living as horticul-
turalists for at least 6,000 years. Horticulture doesn’t automatically lead to 
full-on farming.
Think of horticulture as a kind of gardening in which you congregate plants in 
a patch to protect them and promote their health by weeding and so on. This 
procedure is different from the intensive soil-tilling, seeding, and harvesting 
involved in farming.

150
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
Generally speaking, horticulturalists differ from famers in three distinctive ways:
 
 Horticulturalists use digging sticks rather than plows or other implements 
hauled by draft animals.
 
 Compared to farmers, horticulturalists farm small plots that have rela-
tively simple irrigation. A typical horticulture irrigation system consists 
of simple earthen mounds that are breached to allow water through and 
then piled up again to prevent further water breach.
 
 Horticulturalists normally domesticate plants that aren’t conducive to 
the same large-scale or long-term storage practiced in farming societies.
Garden horticulture
Horticultural plots often look more like gardens than farmed fields, and they 
often have some common characteristics. They’re typically small (less than 
one acre) and utilize simple erosion-control measures such as using logs to 
divert running water. Horticulturalists embrace sloping land more readily 
than farmers do; because they have less investment in the farming lifestyle, 
horticulturalists simply live with the slope instead of exerting the time and 
energy required to cut notches out of the hillsides.
 
Among horticulturalists, women normally plant and harvest food, and men 
typically clear the land. On the other hand, women in farming societies gener-
ally deal more with processing harvested foods (grinding seeds, cooking veg-
etables, and so on) indoors, and men do outdoor activities involving the fields 
and agricultural implements.
Slashing and burning
Slashing and burning, also known as shifting horticulture, is the practice of 
clearing heavily vegetated land to make an agricultural field; this field is then 
used for some time — often from one to five years — before making a final 
harvest and then burning off the stubble to let it lie for several years as you 
move on to another, previously used field. This technique keeps horticultur-
alists moving from one plot to the next, and it has two main ramifications. It 
dampens any impulse to invest too heavily in one landscape, but at the same 
time it requires landowners to have a strong enough concept of property to 
protect their investment in that plot.

151
 Chapter 9: Old, Old McDonald: The Origins of Farming
Limited storage
Another characteristic of horticulture is that it normally doesn’t involve as 
much storage as intensive farming situations do. Most of the places that fea-
ture horticulture are tropical or semitropical, and the hot, humid conditions 
make food storage difficult. This lack of storage has two main ramifications:
 
 It reduces the distance to which horticulturalists can carry out warlike 
expeditions. Unlike horticulturalists, farmers can store up literally tons 
of grain, which makes it easier for them to carry war to distant places 
for long periods of time. Without this storage luxury, horticulturalists can 
only leave for so long before they must return home to work in the fields.
Maori horticulture
In 1924, New Zealander Elsdon Best published a 
description of Maori horticulture as they prac-
ticed it around the turn of the century. Although 
this horticulture certainly differed from what the 
Maori practiced prehistorically, it could have 
been pretty similar to what was practiced at the 
time Best wrote. The following paragraphs are 
excerpts from his 1924 work The Maori as He 
Was: A Brief Account of Maori Life as it was in 
Pre-European Days; check out the accompany-
ing figure for a look at a traditional 19th-century 
Maori village supported by horticulture.
“Early visitors to these shores remarked on 
the careful tending of crops performed by the 
natives, and the extremely neat appearance 
of the fields, in which weeds were carefully 
eradicated. From [Captain] Cook downwards 
they emphasize the peculiar regularity of the 
sweet-potato fields, with each plant occupying 
a small mound, and the mounds arranged care-
fully and precisely in quincunx order [five plants, 
one at each corner and a fifth in the center, as 
on dice]. These labours were deemed to be of 
great importance, and the growing crops were 
rendered tapu [taboo] and placed under the 
protection of the gods.”
“When the season arrived for the preparation 
of the ground for planting, then all the people of 
a village turned to work with a will. Chief, com-
moner, and slave, men and women, all joined in 
the work, which moved briskly until the ground 
was ready for planting. In pre-European times 
there were no predatory animals in the land, no 
quadruped that had to be fenced against; but in 
some places light barriers were put round the 
crops to protect them from the meddlesome 
pukeko, or swamphen. The introduction of the 
pig greatly increased the labours of the Maori 
husbandman, for that creature keenly appre-
ciated kumara and was most persistent in his 
attempts to reach them.”
“Different kinds of soil could be described by 
Maori terms, as he was provided with about 
fifty soil-names, and he was naturally a good 
judge of soils. Much care was displayed in 
selecting ground for cultivation, inasmuch as 
certain stiff, unkindly soils called for much extra 
labour. This consisted of carrying, perchance 
for a considerable distance, great quantities of 
gravel to be placed round the plants of kumara 
[sweet potato]. In some districts are seen pits 
of great size from which gravel has been taken 
for kumara crops.”

152
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
 
 It reduces the potential for self-aggrandizement (at least in relation to 
that in farming societies). In farming societies, farmers on particularly 
productive plots of land can build up social status (self-aggrandize) by 
throwing feasts or assisting others in times of resource stress. In many 
horticultural societies, competitive feasting and self-aggrandizement are 
very important and common; because of their lack of storage, horticul-
turalists just don’t have as many opportunities to show off in this way.
Principles of Farming
Farming is more intensive than horticulture. It’s a larger-scale undertaking 
with different purposes than horticulture, and it includes the domestication 
of both plants and animals. It’s practiced by people living in civilizations (large, 
populous social organizations; for more on what constitutes a civilization, 
check out Chapter 10). For these reasons, I’m going to call the type of farming 
that I describe in the sections that follow state farming.
Distinguishing state farming 
from horticulture
State farming is very distinct from horticulture, and it has some very signifi-
cant differences:
 
 State farming is intensified. Farmers grow more crops on larger plots 
(which are now fields) in a shorter time with more technically intensive 
methods (such as plowing, intense fertilization, and irrigation).
 
 State farming is systematized. The state regulates units of measure, 
approves of crops, and takes a cut of farmed products in the form of taxes.
 
 State farming is economically integrated. The activities of the state and 
its citizens adjust to accommodate the farming schedule. For example, 
ancient Egyptian military service was carefully scheduled in accordance 
with the (state-mandated) planting and harvesting schedules.
 
 State farming is commodified. Farmers not only grow staple foods but 
also grow cash crops for export; in fact, farmers may or may not actually 
subsist on what they themselves grow.
Obviously, these conditions are very different from those of horticultural 
societies.

153
 Chapter 9: Old, Old McDonald: The Origins of Farming
State farming, which some call agriculture to distinguish from less-intensive 
forms of domestication, has two main technical characteristics. It tills the 
ground with an animal-drawn plow rather than a simple human-held digging 
stick, and it also involves the intensive use of fertilization.
Water control
Control of water is obviously necessary for farming. Farmers in different 
areas achieved this control in different ways, including
 
 Dyke-and-canal irrigation: The use of dykes to channel water in canals; 
these systems could be massive works many miles long, as were those 
in ancient Assyria (Northern Iraq) more than 2,700 years ago
 
 Chinampas: A method of creating artificial islands in a lake (rather than 
bringing the lake water to land), as the Aztec civilization did around 
1400 AD
 
 Hill terracing: The practice of cutting notches in the sides of hills to 
catch water on the flat terraces instead of letting it simply run down the 
hillside, as in Incan civilization around 1400 AD
 
 Flood control: The practice of managing floodwaters that overflow the 
banks of rivers, as in the ancient Egyptian technique of trapping the 
water on the fields immediately flanking the Nile by using simple earth 
mounds
 
 Dams: The collection of water in basins that were then strategically 
drained, as was the practice in ancient Iran more than 2,500 years ago
Animal domestication, farming-style
In addition to animals bred for all manner of secondary products, state farm-
ing promotes the raising of animals (sometimes known as animal husbandry) 
for use in warfare (as mounts for soldiers and pack animals for moving supplies), 
as pets (historically only available to the elite class), and as exotic novelties. 
These unusual animals were sometimes kept in zoos for public entertainment, 
but they also often served to show the prestige of a leader. One Chinese 
emperor reportedly brought a giraffe all the way from Africa for his own 
amusement.
Table 9-1 shows when and where some common domesticated animals first 
popped up. The Fertile Crescent refers to a region of Southwest Asia including 
parts of Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran.

Massive storage
State farming requires massive storage of farmed goods for several reasons. 
All early farming states had armies, and armies need to be fed while they 
train and while they’re away on military expeditions. Farming states also had 
cobblers, bricklayers, masons, priests, scribes — in short, all manner of folk 
who had specialized trades outside of food production; each of these folk 
needed to be fed, and some of their food came from state-controlled coffers 
of stored agricultural products. Finally, most states had some means of redis-
tributing food during drought or other calamity, and they had to store that 
food in massive, state-administered storage facilities.
 
I discuss the characteristics of civilization as though they’re separate, but 
they’re really all deeply interconnected. You can read more about these con-
nections in Chapter 10.
Farming facilities and tools
Farming is technologically and materially intensive, in that it requires per-
manent facilities where products are processed and stored, as well as tools. 

156
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
Obviously, facilities vary from farm to farm, but the following list describes 
some common ones found on early farms:
 
 Granaries for sorting harvested vegetal matter, such as dried grain.
 
 Ovens for cooking vegetal foods. These ovens are often substantial 
structures with chimneys, complex doors for putting in firewood, and 
vents; they’re different from simply campfires and were normally built 
as part of the house.
 
 Food-production yards, which normally contain threshing floors, areas 
specially prepared for separating seeds from plant stems and chaff 
(unwanted plant matter).
Because farmers have to plant, tend, harvest, process, and store their crops, 
they require distinctive tools. Some implements that show up as artifacts in 
early-farming sites include
 
 Sickles for harvesting plant matter. Before the invention of metal 
scythes thousands of years after the earliest domesticators, early sickles 
were made of stone blades hafted into bone, antler, and/or horn han-
dles; the blades bear very distinctive “sickle gloss” from rubbing against 
the vegetal matter, a clear sign to archaeologists that early farmers col-
lected a lot of plant matter.
 
 Pottery for storage and cooking of vegetal foods. Pottery is basically 
clay hardened by heating (you can read more about it in Chapter 4) and 
appears in all farming societies. It’s good as a container for dry foods, 
but also as a durable container for cooking, one of the ways that plant 
foods are often processed (because many need to be cooked to make 
them easier to chew or otherwise digest).
 
 Mortar and pestle for grinding/pounding vegetal foods to small pieces 
or even powder. The mortar (the open vessel) can vary in size and 
shape, but is essentially the receptacle for the grains to be processed, 
and the pestle is the instrument used to pound or pulverize the grains. 
Though nonfarming societies occasionally used mortar and pestle, when 
these tools are accompanied by other evidence for farming they’re very 
distinctive.
 
 Threshing tools for separating seeds from plant stems and chaff. These 
tools may include threshing boards, batons, flails, baskets, and other 
instruments.
 
 Axes for clearing forested areas to convert into farmland. These items 
typically consisted of a stone ground and polished into shape over many 
hours. Early stone axes have been tested and found to be as effective as 
any steel axe when fitted into a handle; they are one of the most distinctive 
tools of the early farmer.

157
 Chapter 9: Old, Old McDonald: The Origins of Farming
Farmers also have to birth, tend, feed, water, and harvest primary or second-
ary products from their domesticated animals. (More on these products in 
the next section.) These activities include distinctive tools:
 
 Pens or other enclosures to contain the animals being domesticated
 
 Bridles, saddles, and other riding gear to control animals ridden
by a human
 
 Yokes or other harnesses to connect animals to items to be pulled
Secondary products
After (or sometimes at the same as) people began domesticating plants 
and animals as food, they domesticated them for secondary products as 
well. Secondary products are nonfood resources such as skins obtained from 
domestic plants or animals. In many cases, these products (or the goods cre-
ated from them) can be just as valuable as the meat from animals or seeds 
from plants. They include
 
 Fibers: Animals and plants produce fibers such as wool and cotton that 
people can spin into yarn or thread and sew or weave to make textiles.
 
 Machine-pulling and transportation: Farmers can use their animals to 
pull implements like plows and carry people and goods along paths.
 
 Milk: Animals produce milk, which can be consumed or turned to butter 
or cheese. Technically, milk is a food source, but it qualifies as a second-
ary product because it’s renewable — you can live on the “interest” of 
the animal without killing the “capital,” as it were.
 
 Blood: People can consume animal blood for nutritive value. The pas-
toralist Maasai of Eastern Africa mix it with milk to make a rich froth. Of 
course, this practice also technically makes blood a food source, but, 
like milk, blood is renewable and therefore a secondary product.
 
 Plant tissue: Plant tissues such as papyrus stalks could be converted to 
writing sheets as in ancient Egypt (or to a little thing called paper that 
you use today).
 
 Plant extracts: Plant extracts are often ingredients in medicines, 
adhesives, pigments, and so on.
Of course, domesticated animals can simply serve as pets and assistants; 
some of the earliest domesticates were probably wolf puppies bred over time 
into hunting dogs, from which all of today’s pooches are descended.

Looking Back on the Origins of Farming
Clearly, farming and horticulture are very different, and each clearly had 
significant effects on human cultures worldwide. In the rest of this chapter, 
I introduce you to what anthropology knows about when and where domes-
tication began worldwide. In some places, you see that it was rather quickly 
followed by farming, though this sequence isn’t universal.
Why farm in the first place?
Why would people begin farming in the first place? This is one of archaeology’s 
most enduring questions. As with other topics, single-factor models just don’t 
seem to work to explain the origins of agriculture, probably because different 
groups had different reasons to take up agriculture in different places at differ-
ent times. Some interesting (but, ultimately, failed) ideas about the origins of 
agriculture include:
 
 The unilineal evolution group of theories suggests that all people were 
on the track to becoming civilized and that all would eventually take up 
horticulture and then graduate into agriculture. These theories make no 
Palaeolithic to Neolithic: An adventure 
in confusing terminology
As archaeologists were laying out the founda-
tions of archaeology in the 19th century, they 
arranged artifacts into several main time-
specific periods. -Lithic means “stone;” the 
Palaeolithic was the period — of unknown 
origin or duration — reflected by old-type stone 
tools such as simple scrapers, hand axes, and 
so on. The Mesolithic came next (though no one 
is certain when it started, either) and was char-
acterized by new stone tools, including stone 
spear points and microliths, razor-blade sized 
tools used for many purposes. The Neolithic 
was characterized by a single main tool type: 
the stone axe. Archaeologists knew that people 
in each of these periods used artifacts made 
from other raw materials such as bone and 
antler; however, the stone was best preserved, 
so the stone-based names stuck.
Defining these time periods as hard-and-fast 
eras can create some problems, though. For 
example, although new stone tools (particularly 
sickles for harvesting and axes for clearing land 
to farm) did appear, not all the old kinds of stone 
tools were abandoned. The bottom line is that 
the beginning of each period doesn’t necessar-
ily signal the definitive end of the previous one.

159
 Chapter 9: Old, Old McDonald: The Origins of Farming
sense for people who live in areas where agriculture simply isn’t reason-
able, like the hunters or reindeer-herders of the Arctic, who aren’t in some 
time bubble but rather live here in the modern day.
 
 The vitalist group of theories suggests that as humanity strove to 
improve itself, it would naturally take up farming because farming was 
obviously superior to foraging. These theories fail to actually define in 
what way farming was so much better. It’s farmers who are up at 4 a.m. 
to milk the cows; foragers actually work a bit less for their daily food. 
Farmers also actually tend to live in poorer health than foragers.
 
 The population pressure group of theories argues that as forager popula-
tions increased after the ice ages, population pressure on the landscape 
forced people to devise new ways of making a living, including farming. 
These theories ignore the fact that foragers tend to be very careful about 
letting their populations exceed what their landscapes can support in the 
first place and already have (nonfarming) ways of coping with population 
pressures. Foraging groups often spread out if, as one unit, they’re stress-
ing the resources of a particular foraging ground. (You can read more 
about the effects of high populations on human culture in Chapter 10.)
 
 The climate change group of theories argues that as climates changed 
worldwide after the end of the last ice age (around 12,000 years ago), 
humans invented new ways to survive, including shifting to domestica-
tion from foraging. These theories never really explain how this move 
happened, and just attributing domestication to climate change isn’t 
good enough support.
Although archaeology currently has a decent handle on what farming is, when 
and where it first appeared, and what effects it had, it still has no theories that 
comprehensively explain why farming first appeared. If the Nobel Prize folks 
gave an award in archaeology, nailing this agriculture question would be a 
good way to get your hands on it.
 
For a long time archaeologists referred to the change to farming as the 
Agricultural Revolution — it was also known as the Neolithic Revolution to dis-
tinguish it from the previous stone age. Although the term Neolithic can pres-
ent some confusion (see the sidebar “Palaeolithic to Neolithic: An adventure 
in confusing terminology” in this chapter), just remember that it’s the period 
in which farming is first evident.
Having said all that, I’m now going to deal with what archaeologists do know: 
when, where, and under what general circumstances farming first appeared 
as a way of life across the Earth. Figure 9-1 will help you keep track of these 
developments. (Note: Although the figure shows the centers of early domesti-
cation, it doesn’t number them chronologically, so read carefully.)

The Sumerian farmer’s almanac
In 1949, a University of Chicago/University of 
Pennsylvania expedition to Iraq discovered a 
series of nine clay tablets in the ruins of the 
ancient Sumerian city of Nippur. When trans-
lated they turned out to be an invaluable look at 
Sumerian agriculture, with the following good 
advice for the farmer:
“Keep an eye on the man who puts in the barley 
seed that he make the seed fall 2 fingers uni-
formly . . . Where you have plowed straight 
furrows, plow (now) diagonal furrows; where 
you have plowed diagonal furrows, plow (now) 
straight furrows . . . When you are about to cul-
tivate your field, take care to open the irrigation 
works (so that) their water does not rise too 
high in it (the field). When you have emptied it of 
water, watch the field’s wet ground that it stays 
even; let no wandering ox trample it. Chase the 
prowlers and have it treated as settled land. 
Clear it with ten narrow axes (weighing no 
more than) 2/3 of a pound each. Its stubble (?) 
should be torn up by hand and tied in bundles; 
its narrow holes shall be gone over with a drag; 
and the four sides of the field shall be fenced 
about. While the field is burning (in the summer 
sun) let it be divided up into equal parts. Let 
your tools hum with activity (?). The yoke-bar 
should be made fast, your new whip should be 
fastened with nails, and the handle to which 
your old whip was fastened should be mended 
by the workers’ children.”

In the Near East
The world’s first domestication seems to have taken place in a region called 
the Fertile Crescent of the Near East, from Israel up to Southern Turkey, across 
to Northern Iraq, and then down the west side of Iraq’s Zagros Mountains.
Archaeologists begin to see traces of experimentation with domestication of 
both plants and animals in this region at about 12,000 years ago. Specifically:
 
 The domestication of wild grasses: Domesticated wheat (emmer and 
einkorn varieties) and barley appear around this time.
 
 The domestication of goats and sheep: This domestication may have 
occurred before that of the plants, though this question remains unresolved.
 
 The appearance of small, sedentary communities: The Natufian villages 
in modern-day Lebanon and Israel are sedentary and include burials of 
generations of people under houses, indicating a deep connection with 
certain places on the landscape that contrasts to the mobility philoso-
phy of foraging peoples.
 
 The slow transition from hunted foods to domesticated foods: Food 
refuse from some villages shows a transition from mostly antelope and 
deer remains to the remains of sheep, goats, and the main forms of wheat.
Eventually, the list of domesticated Near Eastern plants includes wheat, 
barley, peas, chickpeas, and lentils; fava beans, carrots, beets, safflower, and 
olives; and figs, dates, and fenugreek (a legume-like herb).
 In Africa
Archaeological evidence accumulated over the past two decades has shown 
that domestication of plants, and perhaps some animals, occurred in Africa 
around 7,000–10,000 years ago; certainly by 5,000 years ago, people on the Nile, 
organized as the Egyptian civilization, were full-fledged farmers, using tools 
such as the shaduf (shown in Figure 9-2) for irrigation. Some main evidence:
 
 One kind of domesticated wild grass — emmer wheat — was present in 
highland Ethiopia as early as 7,000 years ago; not long after, the main 
domesticates of the Near East appear on the fertile banks of the Nile.
 
 As early as 10,000 years ago, people may have domesticated wild 
aurochs into cattle; in the long run these cattle were popular among 
both African pastoralists (cattle herders) and agriculturalists.
 
 Small, sedentary communities appear; villages of mud brick spaced 
along the Nile were apparently economically and politically independent 
until unification by early rulers around 5,200 BP.

162
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
Eventually, the list of domesticated African and Nile plants includes sorghum, 
millet, tef (a millet-like crop), cow pea, oil palms, watermelon, and okra.

In East Asia
People of Eastern Asia were cultivating wild rice by 9,000 years ago, and soon 
they were domesticating and farming it as well. Today, rice supplies about 20 
percent of the world’s calories.
Domesticates cultivated independently in Eastern Asia include the aforemen-
tioned rice plus pigs, chickens, cattle, dogs, and ducks. Small, sedentary com-
munities such as the Lungshan villages appeared around 5,500 years ago; these 
sites have many remains of cattle and pigs and storage pits for millet and other 
crops. Eventually, the list of domesticated East Asian plants includes apricot, 
peach, cucumber, sesame, radish, turnip, canola, tea, apricot, and water chest-
nut. As in other areas, food waste indicates a shift in diet from hunted foods to 
domesticated items.

 Chapter 9: Old, Old McDonald: The Origins of Farming
In the Western Pacific
By 10,000 years ago, peoples in highland New Guinea were exploiting and 
cultivating several plants, including taro and banana; by 6,500 years ago, they 
were clearing land and building horticultural plots for such plants; and by 
4,500 years ago, they were digging simple earthen waterways.
By 3,000 years ago, some of the folk of the Western Pacific were exploring east 
into the open ocean, carrying on their sailing vessels domesticated animals 
and plants, as well as seed stocks to use when they eventually found land.
The major Western Pacific domesticates included the versatile breadfruit, 
yam, coconut, and banana, plus dogs, pigs, and chickens. Eventually, the list 
of domesticated Western Pacific plants includes grapefruit, mango, lemon, 
cloves, and arrowroot.
In the Americas
In recent years, the origin of domestication in the Americas has been pushed 
back by new archaeological discoveries. For decades, archaeologists thought 
cultivation took place in North America very late, but today evidence indi-
cates the cultivation (horticulturally) of sunflowers in the region close to 
10,000 years ago. The general consensus was that agriculture in Central 
Mexico was only 5,000 to 7,000 years old, but now both corn and squash have 
been dated to around 10,000 years ago as well.
Herodotus and Egypt, “gift of the Nile”
Around 500 BC, the Greek geographer 
Herodotus traveled to Egypt, and, impressed by 
the richness of its Nile-watered farms, called 
the whole civilization “the gift of the Nile.” He 
also described a certain aspect of ancient 
Egyptian agriculture, and although he perhaps 
overstated how easy it was, it remains a good 
description nonetheless:
“It is certain however that now they gather 
in fruit from the earth with less labor than 
any other men . . . for they have no labor in 
breaking up furrows with a plough nor in the 
hoeing nor in any other of those labors which 
other men have about a crop; but when the river 
has come up of itself and watered their fields and 
after watering has left them again, then each 
man sows his own field and . . . when he has 
trodden the seed into the ground by means of . . . 
swine . . . he waits for the harvest, and when 
he has threshed the [harvest] by means of the 
swine, then he gathered it in”

164
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
Important characteristics of New World domestication include
 
 The domestication of wild grass: Several kinds of wild grass, including 
the corn-like teosinte, were slowly but surely domesticated into corn.
 
 The domestication of llamas and turkeys: Interestingly, no animal to be 
widely ridden was domesticated in the Americas.
 
 The cultivation of beans and squash: Beans were a staple; squash was 
popular as food but also for its gourd, which made a good container for 
all kinds of substances.
 
 The cultivation of condiments: These crops included peppers, mint, 
and chiles.
 
 The cultivation of the potato: The potato first appeared in South 
America, and, like many other New World crops, was taken back to the 
Old World after conquistadores “discovered” it in the 16th century.
Eventually, the New World domesticates, which include those of the Andes 
and Amazonia (both in South America) included quinoa, corn, sunflower, 
common bean, manioc, squash, papaya, sweet potato, peanut, peppers, 
avocado, cashew, and pineapple.
The agricultural wonders of Tenochtitlan
In 1520, the conquistador Hernan Cortez wrote 
about the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan (today’s 
Mexico City). In this letter, he described some 
domesticates of the Aztec world, giving anthro-
pologists a good look into the vibrant agricul-
tural engine of an ancient civilization.
“There are all kinds of green vegetables, espe-
cially onions, leeks, garlic, watercresses, nas-
turtium, borage, sorrel, artichokes, and golden 
thistle; fruits also of numerous descriptions, 
amongst which are cherries and plums, similar 
to those in Spain; honey and wax from bees, and 
from the stalks of maize, which are as sweet as 
the sugar-cane; honey is also extracted from the 
plant called maguey, which is superior to sweet 
or new wine; from the same plant they extract 
sugar and wine, which they also sell . . . [I have 
also seen] maize or Indian corn, in the grain and 
in the form of bread, preferred in the grain for 
its flavor to that of the other islands and terra-
firma; patés of birds and fish; great quantities 
of fish — fresh, salt, cooked and uncooked; the 
eggs of hens, geese, and of all the other birds 
I have mentioned, in great abundance, and 
cakes made of eggs; finally, everything that can 
be found throughout the whole country is sold 
in the markets, comprising articles so numerous 
that to avoid prolixity, and because their names 
are not retained in my memory, or are unknown 
to me, I shall not attempt to enumerate them.”

C
ivilization, it’s often said, is the pinnacle of human evolution, the point 
that evolution has been building to in the first place. Is that true? What 
does anthropology have to say about it? Like many lessons of anthropology, 
we’re in for a lesson in humility. Humanity hasn’t been striving for civilization, 
abandoning every other way to live in a quest for SUVs and transparent tape; 
our species has invented many ways to live, and many humans continue to live 
happily without cities or the many products of civilization.
So what is civilization, if not the inevitable result of human evolution? This 
chapter tells you exactly what civilization is, when and where it first came up, 
and a bit about what it was like to live in some of the ancient civilizations.
Human Subsistence and 
Social Organization
The first thing to remember about civilization — the most complex form of 
human social organization — is that it appeared only in the last 6,000 years 
or so. The species Homo sapiens sapiens has been around for 100,000 years, 
so (calculators ready?) civilization has been around for less than 10 percent 
of that time; it really is a very recent development.
In all the time before civilization, humans gathered or grew their daily foods in 
some distinctive ways, each of which had important effects on the shape of 
human societies. Knowing about these ancient ways of life is important to 

166
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
understanding civilization itself. In this section, I discuss the connections 
between human subsistence (the way people get their food) and social organi-
zation before delving more deeply into civilization itself in later sections.
Human subsistence
All animals, humans included, have worked out a way to survive. All animals 
must meet the following basic requirements for survival:
 
 They must obtain food. Humans require about 1,000 calories per day 
just to stay alive; active people in civilizations may require 2,000 to 3,000 
calories, and active foragers like polar hunters as much as 4,000.
 
 They must obtain water. Humans need about 2.5 liters (about half a 
gallon) of clean water per day to remain healthy and may need a lot 
more depending on the amount of work they do.
 
 They must be able to regulate temperature. Temperature regulation 
keeps animals warm or cool; most humans are comfortable in a small 
temperature spectrum, feeling cold below 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 
degrees Celsius) and hot above 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees 
Celsius). This temperature range is only about 20 degrees Fahrenheit (or 
6 degrees Celsius) above or below the Earth’s average temperature of 
about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius); staying warm or cool 
is very important.
 
 They must ingest the proper nutrients. Nutrients are vitamins and min-
erals required to keep healthy; the recommended varieties and amounts 
vary wildly from species to species. Some vitamins important to human 
health include vitamin A, vitamin B, and vitamin C; many societies 
acquire these nutrients by trade if they’re not available in native foods.
To fulfill these requirements, every human society has devised a kind of sub-
sistence. Obviously, the distribution of resources such as food and water on 
a landscape has a strong effect on how humans make their living; the kind of 
subsistence practiced also affects things like social structure, mobility (how 
far people move around each day), and even religion and ethics. The main 
subsistence modes humans have invented are described in the following sec-
tions, with notes on how these modes of subsistence affect other variables 
such as social ranking and concepts of property ownership.
 
The idea that a society’s mode of subsistence directly explains its religion and 
ethics is called environmental determinism. Like many -isms, the idea has some 
value — social factors are certainly affected by subsistence factors. That said, 
you can’t attribute everything in a culture to how its people subsist; human 
culture is just too complex for that.

167
 Chapter 10: The Development of Civilization
Foraging
Foraging (also known as hunting and gathering) is the subsistence mode in 
which humans move across a landscape on a near-continual basis, collecting 
their food and water every day. Humans and early hominids have been prac-
ticing foraging since at least 2.5 million years ago, and although most humans 
today subsist on agriculture (which I discuss later), many foragers continue 
to hunt and gather on a daily basis. Some important features of the foraging 
subsistence mode include
 
 High residential mobility, meaning that housing normally isn’t permanent
 
 Limited food storage, meaning that environments or foods are unsuited 
to being stored (for example, they rot)
 
 Lack of emphasis on material culture, meaning that although some arti-
facts are important (like tools for food gathering), the society’s cultural 
symbols are rooted in its oral traditions (cultural information, including 
histories and myths passed down through storytelling)
 
 Lack of emphasis on social ranking, meaning that people in the foraging 
culture have equal access to all resources (an arrangement known as 
egalitarianism)
 
 Lack of emphasis on possession, meaning that most (although not nec-
essarily all) items are communally owned, and symbolic units of value 
(like money) are absent
Foraging was the original way of life for the human species. Early Homo 
emerging from Africa, the Aborigines of Australia, the Baka of Central Africa, 
the native people of Arctic Alaska and Canada, the Chinook people encoun-
tered on the Lower Columbia River by Lewis and Clark, the cave-painting 
peoples of ice-age Europe — they were or are all foragers. Their lifestyles, 
though very different from our own today, sustained them for thousands or 
even tens of thousands of years. Today, as sustainability (maintaining core 
resources such that you can continue a practice indefinitely) shapes many of 
our decisions (and rightly so), we’d be smart to take as many lessons as pos-
sible from these folks.
 
Foragers are often portrayed as poor because they don’t own many of the 
objects we in civilization cherish. But foragers’ wealth isn’t reliant on objects; 
their cultural richness resides in their oral traditions and their histories. 
Foragers don’t see themselves as poor, and neither should you.
Pastoralism
Pastoralism is the practice of herding animals to provide subsistence, moving 
them — and the social group that herds them — across a landscape of grazing 
land and water sources according to a complex seasonal cycle. Pastoralists 
include the Samburu people of northern Kenya, who herd cattle, and the 

168
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
Saami of Arctic Scandinavia and Russia, who herd reindeer. Pastoralists eat 
some meat, but rely more on their herds to provide secondary products such 
as milk, butter, cheese, and hides. Pastoralists domesticate their animals, 
making them tame (or very nearly tame). The following list describes some 
common characteristics of pastoralists:
 
 Moderate food storage, including meat on the hoof (the idea that living 
domesticated animals are themselves a kind of stored food).
 
 Moderate emphasis on symbolic material culture, meaning they put 
some emphasis on elaborating the symbolism in the people’s artifacts 
in the form of decoration or symbols; this is often because animals can 
be used to carry those artifacts (whereas in foraging societies, people 
essentially must carry everything).
 
 Moderate emphasis on social ranking, meaning some people have greater 
access to resources than others. These folks are often leaders of families 
that own certain herds of animals; higher livestock counts normally 
mean higher social rank for the owning family.
 
 Moderate emphasis on possession, meaning that, as compared to foragers, 
pastoralists value their goods — including their livestock, which they 
exert a great deal of energy to protect — to a greater degree.
Pastoralists move around landscapes, but not quite as much or continuously 
as foragers; they may stay in one place for weeks or months as the quality of 
a grazing patch dictates. Interesting pastoral subsistence adaptations include 
the Maasai (East Africa) custom of mixing live cattle blood with milk to pro-
vide a high-calorie, nutrient-rich broth as delicious to Maasai kids as milk-
shakes are to kids in the U.S. Cultural anthropology has revealed that dietary 
choices depend on the resources — they’re not universal.
Horticulture
Horticulture involves low-intensity farming, in which people grow crops with-
out the massive investment of irrigation and fertilization and emphasis on 
storage seen in agriculture (see the next section). Horticulturalists include the 
Maori people of New Zealand and the Fore (for-ay) people of highland New 
Guinea, each of whom grow yams and raise pigs. These folk practice a form 
of subsistence not seen in foragers and seen only sparingly in pastoral societ-
ies: domestication, which is the raising of plant and animal species entirely 
for human purposes. (Check out Chapter 9 for a more extensive discussion of 
domestication.) Because horticulturalists farm the land, they’re tethered to 
that land, staying in one place on the landscape longer than foragers or pas-
toralists. Among the characteristics of horticulturalist societies are
 
 Moderate to high reliance on food storage, including extensive process-
ing and drying of foods so that they’re edible for months to years after 
harvest

169
 Chapter 10: The Development of Civilization
 
 Strong emphasis on symbolic material culture, meaning that a great deal 
of effort is put into embellishing artifacts — from houses to costumes — 
largely because horticulturalists don’t move as often as foragers or even 
pastoralists
 
 Strong emphasis on social ranking, meaning that some people have 
greater access to resources than others; these citizens are often leaders 
of families that own lots of livestock and extensive and unusually pro-
ductive patches of farmland
 
 Strong emphasis on possession, meaning that (as compared to foragers 
and pastoralists) horticulturalists place a great deal of value on their 
goods and personal property (farmland, food-processing and storage 
facilities, corrals, and so on) because they invest so much time in that 
property
Horticulture is often practiced as swidden or slash-and burn farming, in which 
croplands are farmed for a few years before the social group moves on to 
another cropland, which is cleared (slashed and burned), renewing the soil 
to be farmed for a few years before moving on to another slash-and-burn 
site. This practice prevents overtaxing the soil and allows it to replenish its 
nutrients, and in many societies the farmlands are returned to repeatedly in a 
multiyear cycle.
Agriculture
Agriculture is intensive farming facilitated by the use of massive water-
control facilities (such as irrigation ditches and dykes); intensive food-
processing practices (such as winnowing, or separating grain from chaff); 
and massive reliance on stored foods, which may last for years after harvest. 
Agriculturalists eat some of the crops they reap, but they also rely on these 
crops’ secondary products, such as oil from olives, and cheese from domesti-
cated animals. Every ancient and modern civilization rests on an agricultural 
foundation to supply basic sustenance. Important characteristics of agricul-
tural societies include
 
 Almost total reliance on food storage, including extensive processing 
and drying of foods so that they’re edible for years after harvest. (Exotic 
import foods are normally delicacies rather than staples.)
 
 Very strong emphasis on symbolic material culture, meaning that a 
great deal of effort is put into embellishing artifacts largely because of 
not having to move as often as foragers or even pastoralists.
 
 Strong emphasis on social ranking, meaning that some people have 
greater access to resources than others; these people are and were 
often leaders of families that own lots of livestock and extensive and 
unusually productive patches of farmland.

170
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
 
 Strong emphasis on possession, meaning that (as compared to foragers, 
pastoralists, and horticulturalists) agriculturalists place the most value 
on their goods and personal property (farmland, food-processing and 
storage facilities, corrals, and so on) because they invest so much time 
in that property.
Agriculture has only been around for at least 10,000 years, but even when 
cultures did take up full-time farming, it didn’t immediately lead to modern 
civilization. People have floated dozens of theories to explain why humanity 
first took up farming full-time, but none has convinced all anthropologists. 
For example, some have proposed that farming began when populations 
of foragers grew so high that the land could no longer support daily forag-
ing, and required a new method of subsistence: agriculture. But that theory 
ignores the fact that foragers normally prevent their populations from grow-
ing beyond what the landscape can support in the first place (for example, 
by infanticide, the killing of infants, or social fission, splitting a foraging group 
up when the food supply on a landscape can’t support everyone). Today 
the question surrounding the origins of agriculture is one of anthropology’s 
greatest mysteries.
Earlier in this chapter, I mention that subsistence modes clearly have impor-
tant effects on the nature of human society; in the following sections, I cover 
the main kinds of human social organization. Not surprisingly, they basically 
reflect the four main modes of human subsistence.
Human social organization
The different modes of subsistence had important effects on the kind of 
social organization people have practiced through the ages. This section 
describes the four main kinds of human societies and provides a handy table 
summarizing how subsistence and social organization are interrelated. I dis-
cuss these modes of social organization in further detail in Chapter 16 as well 
as the sidebar “Social organization and subsistence among humanity past 
and present” later in this chapter.
 
Keep in mind that the terminology anthropologists use varies. One of the most 
frustrating things I learned throughout four years of undergraduate work and 
thirteen years of graduate school worldwide was that every rule seemed to 
have an exception. No matter how I tried to pin down humanity (in the pres-
ent or the ancient worlds), just when I thought I had a good line drawn around 
a subsistence mode or a social type, for example, I’d find out that things just 
weren’t so simple. Still, the types of subsistence and social organizations men-
tioned in this book are generally applicable to the study of humanity at large; 
just remember their edges are blurry, not sharp.

171
 Chapter 10: The Development of Civilization
Bands
Bands are normally relatively small groups of foragers who travel long dis-
tances across their foraging landscapes. They’re essentially egalitarian, 
giving a little respect to the best hunters and gatherers in the group but 
making sure to socially shout down anyone who tries to self-aggrandize (gain 
social status by boasting or giving extravagantly).
Tribes
Tribes can be somewhat larger than bands and may travel less; they include 
pastoralists with their herd animals but may be specialized hunters like the 
Arapaho Native Americans (who focused on buffalo hunting). Tribes have 
chiefs, but they have more influence than actual power, and they can be 
kicked out of position by the population. Tribes have slightly more members 
than most bands.
Chiefdoms
Chiefdoms, which often rely on some kind of horticulture for subsistence, 
include the Maori of New Zealand. They’re led by hereditary elites, people of 
a royal bloodline born into positions of power. These chiefs have more power 
than the leaders of tribes and can’t be so easily ejected; still, their power is 
mainly that of coercion and influence, except over their slaves, whom they 
could trade, injure, or kill at will (in the past, anyway — most or all of today’s 
chiefdoms don’t own slaves).
States/civilizations
States or civilizations (like most archaeologists, I use these terms interchange-
ably) are characterized by massive and strict division of the population into 
elite, commoner, and lower-class/slave classes (at least in the ancient civiliza-
tions). They’re largely sedentary, relying on intensive agriculture and stored 
foods, and their very size and population make the number of connections 
and interactions between the members enormously complex compared to 
those in chiefdoms, tribes, or bands.
 
Today, not all people are fully engaged in what typically qualifies as civilization. 
This discrepancy doesn’t mean they’re not fully modern humans, just that 
they carry on lifestyles like foraging, pastoralism, or horticulture that were 
invented long before civilization. These groups often have some contact with 
civilizations, such as the foraging Inuit, who buy snowmobiles from civiliza-
tion but use them to hunt in their foraging lifestyle. Because civilizations have 
spread so widely, many of these indigenous folks have been pushed far from 
their original territories and/or placed on reservations, and this relocation — 
combined with their trade and cultural contacts with civilization — makes 
it appear that they’re trapped in some kind of time bubble. But they’re not. 
They’re modern people just like you; they just happen to have very different 
modes of subsistence than the agriculturalists of the world’s civilizations.

In the following table I summarize some of the 
main characteristics of bands, tribes, chiefdoms, 
and civilizations. These are general notes — 
they’re generally accurate, and chiefdoms are 
definitely different from states, for example — 
but remember, each type of social organization 
is more of a shade on a spectrum than a rigid 
category.

 Chapter 10: The Development of Civilization
The Characteristics of Civilization
The preceding section shows you how civilization differs from other kinds 
of human social organization; now take a look at some of the main char-
acteristics of civilization. This section details 14 characteristics that most 
archaeologists agree are indicators of civilization. But remember, since the 
beginning of professional archaeology over 150 years ago, prehistorians have 
argued about the characteristics that define ancient civilizations, generating 
one list after another. In this book, I’m using a list of characteristics culled 
from a number of eminent prehistorians, but you should remember that each 
ancient civilization was a little different. At the very least, any society with 
these characteristics was so different from any known band, tribe, or chief-
dom that it may as well be considered a civilization.
Remember two things: The following list comes in no particular order, and 
every characteristic connects with other characteristics; although I discuss 
them separately, they don’t exist independently. Finally, if one characteristic 
underpins all the rest of the characteristics of civilization, it’s an agricul-
tural subsistence mode. Most of these characteristics were supported from 
the beginning by a surplus of food. Craft specialists who focused on making 
goods could only increase their special skills if they weren’t out gathering 
food half the time.

Urbanization
Urbanization is the concentration of a human population into an area that 
can’t support the population ecologically; the populations must import foods 
and other goods. Essentially, urbanization is the growth of cities, where you 
find high populations of non-food production specialists, people like potters 
and blacksmiths who work at trades other than farming or food-processing. 
Urban centers are basically cities, and even in the ancient world they had 
apartments, markets, administrative centers, temples, and other religious 
facilities. In the ancient world, massive fortifications like the heavy stone 
walls of Troy (in modern-day Turkey) often defended these cities. In some 
civilizations, like the Maya of Central America and the Egyptians, a few main 
cities existed, but more people actually lived on farmland. In others, like 
Rome and Sumer, many people were packed into dense cities very similar to 
today’s metropolises.
Long-distance trade
Ancient civilizations used extensive trade networks to import and export a 
variety of goods. Normally, these goods weren’t staples but exotics, items 
A false impression: From Savagery 
to Barbarism to Civilization
For a long time, anthropologists believed that 
all human societies would progress through a 
known series of stages of evolution; this was the 
concept of unilineal (one-way) social evolution. 
The stages were Savagery (marked by simple, 
low-population societies with low-grade tech-
nologies), Barbarism (marked by slightly more 
complex, medium-population societies with 
medium-grade technologies), and Civilization 
(marked by massive populations and high tech-
nologies). But anthropology and archaeology 
have shown that this hierarchy just isn’t true. 
Modern traditional Arctic people continue to 
forage for their daily subsistence and keep their 
populations low, and not every horticultural soci-
ety has evolved into a full-blown civilization. The 
unilineal evolution concept, devised by European 
anthropologists in the Victorian era, was built pri-
marily to contrast European society — considered 
civilized — with non-Europeans by sticking the 
outsiders with the loaded term uncivilized. But 
every human society evolves on its own path, 
and comparisons just don’t work. Because 
some societies actually did go from foraging to 
farming, you may be inclined to think that every 
society should. The truth is that not all societ-
ies progress the same way, and that doesn’t 
make them any less human than us. It simply 
means that those societies evolved a little dif-
ferently. Civilization is only one way to survive 
as a human in the modern world.

175
 Chapter 10: The Development of Civilization
made valuable simply because they came from distant lands. Semiprecious 
stones were imported to ancient Egypt from the mines of Afghanistan hundreds 
of miles away. In Incan civilization, elites were buried with a sprinkling of 
the dust of the thorny oyster shell, only available from coastal communities 
hundreds of miles to the north. Ancient civilizations rarely imported staples such 
as food; the Romans conquered and annexed Egypt as a giant farm (the so-called 
breadbasket of Rome) to feed its troops on their massive expeditions to conquer 
mainland Europe. Normally, imports and exports like the semiprecious stones 
and thorny oyster shell were goods for elite consumption. Importantly, long-
distance trade employed many non-food production specialists who worked at 
occupations other than farming, such as the Aztec pochteca or the Inca mindala, 
guilds of long-distance traders. Remember that these folk and their activities were 
important parts of the economies of all ancient civilizations.
Some civilizations outsourced or contracted some of their long-distance 
trade to other peoples; the Egyptians — not wanting take on the cost 
of a trade navy — hired Phoenician and Minoan peoples of the eastern 
Mediterranean to do their sea trading for them.
Social stratification
Unlike most foraging societies, ancient civilizations didn’t necessarily guar-
antee equal access to resources for all their members. Civilizations ranked 
individuals according to a strict hierarchy, the practice of social stratification. 
In every case, a ruling elite managed the affairs of the populace (common 
people), and in most cases the kings and queens were at the top of the top 
because they were considered to be living gods, or at least people closer to 
the gods than the populace. These elites were members of royal families, 
each of which formed a dynasty that ruled the civilization until the bloodline 
was broken, often by assassination or other intrigue. Among the elites (either 
within the royal family or close to it) were the highest priests, the military 
officials, and the regional governors. Below them were commoners, including 
merchants, artisans, scribes, and lower priests, and below these — forming 
the bulk of the population — were the low commoners: the farmers and herd-
ers that most people today can claim as ancestors (unless you’re descended 
from the royal family!) The middle commoners and the farming population 
were the largest part of the tax base, financing all kinds of state projects 
including the building of monumental architecture and military adventures.
Durable record-keeping/writing
As populations increased and the complexity of the whole system of civili-
zations became more complex, each ancient civilization devised means of 
keeping track of that complexity. These systems usually involved some kind 

176
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
of durable record-keeping, using hieroglyphs, letters, or other symbols to set 
down permanent records. When the taxman came around in ancient Sumer, 
he inscribed a farmer’s payment on a clay tablet, which was later archived in 
the state record halls; Sumerians even wrote on clay nails used in ceremonies 
commemorating the building of important structures, like temples (as shown 
in Figure 10-1). In Inca civilization, sets of strings called quipu were com-
plexly knotted into codes indicating how many troops should be moved from 
one province to another, where to send 5,000 laborers to clear a stretch of 
landslide-covered stone road, and so on. Because most people of the ancient 
civilizations were illiterate, scribes, who normally had somewhat privileged 
positions in society, made and read the durable records.

Standing armies and extended warfare
Each ancient civilization was engaged in warfare — some to expand the civili-
zation’s territory to ensure buffer regions, and some to actively conquer their 
neighbors. Whatever the case, standing armies carried out various goals in 
warfare very different from the kind of hostility you see in chiefdoms or other 
types of human social organization. In those societies, warfare is normally 
carried out for short-term goals, like revenge for some injustice; however, 
because storage is somewhat limited even among horticulturalists, everyone 
eventually has to get back home to tend to the farm, preventing massive 
armies or protracted engagements. In civilization, however, massive silos 
of state-controlled grain could be used to support massive standing armies, 
military forces that didn’t assemble only when needed but rather were 
always training and deploying. These armies were used for extended warfare, 
a new kind of conflict in which military forces went beyond the civilization’s 

177
 Chapter 10: The Development of Civilization
boundaries and for long periods of time, often laying siege to urban centers. 
Some of the earliest archaeological evidence of extended warfare in the 
Mediterranean includes the citadel of Troy, where over 3,000 years ago the 
Mycenaean built massive fortifications against expected siege, complete with 
built-in escape passages as well as tunnels to fresh-water sources.
Money
Like durable record-keeping, the complexity of life, interactions, and transac-
tions in ancient civilizations drove the evolution of a new form of exchange, 
one in which arbitrary but agreed-upon units of value were attributed to 
objects such as coins; you know this system as money. The old system involved 
bartering, or trading one item for another item of intrinsically similar value — for 
example, trading a cloth that took a week to weave for a pair of shoes that took 
a week to cobble together. The difference between money and bartering is that 
money is basically a state-sponsored unit of some socially accepted value that’s 
independent of the items being traded and the work that went into them. Early 
civilizations manifested money in very different ways: Early Sumerian money 
included shell rings, whereas Aztec civilization traded cacao beans. Coins are 
first known from the Eastern Mediterranean, around 2,600 years ago. The 
Inca produced wafer-thin bronze plates that were bundled in stacks, just like 
dollar bills, and traded across vast distances.
Slavery
An unfortunate reality is that some of civilization’s characteristics aren’t 
necessarily good for everyone; in fact, I often ask myself, “Who is civilization 
really good for, anyway?” For the millions of slaves in Rome, Egypt, and Aztec 
and Incan empires (and really every civilization), it hasn’t been much good. 
Slaves are human beings who have been objectified as property; they have no 
say in their welfare and are typically punished (ranging from injury to death) 
for attempts to escape. Slaves carried out enormous labor in ancient civiliza-
tions, working on agricultural projects and constructing massive buildings. 
Slaves were often captives of military expeditions, the citizens of enemy 
states brought home in chains after a military victory.
Perhaps a kind of slavery is still underway in our civilization. Although the 
modern conception of slavery — people bought and sold in chains — has 
been largely abolished, some argue that a slave class still exists: the people 
of the lowest income bracket. Carrying out jobs no one else can afford to do 
and being for all practical purposes immobilized (except for a few, always 
well-publicized, exceptions) in the lowest economic ranks, these folks are the 

178
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
working poor. Classifying these people as slaves is an uncomfortable thought 
in societies that proudly talk about the lack of social class, but it’s a reason-
able argument that I find hard to refute.
Territorial sovereignty
Each civilization maintained its territorial sovereignty (its independence) 
by maintaining boundaries with some kind of armed force and often build-
ing frontier walls, fortresses, barracks, and other military outposts on their 
borders. Egypt built massive fortresses in its south, to defend from the 
super-chiefdom of Nubia, and Rome built the Antonine and Hadrian’s Walls 
to mark its northernmost boundaries (just south of modern Scotland). These 
outposts had to be maintained by standing armies, and each solider and offi-
cer was a non food-production specialist who had to be fed, watered, armed, 
trained, and paid.
Vassal tribute
Every ancient civilization expanded its territory, and most routinely swal-
lowed up any neighboring semi-civilization or chiefdom that couldn’t resist the 
civilization’s armies. Aztec civilizations worked on a kind of protection racket 
principle: They would amass on a neighbor’s territorial boundary and send out 
an emissary offering Aztec citizenship and protection from assault for the price 
of total surrender. Anyone rejecting the offer was overrun and annexed anyway. 
In this way, ancient civilizations increased their tax base by increasing their 
population; the new citizens became vassals. Vassal tribute was the practice of 
generating wealth by demanding certain items or services (tribute) from the 
conquered peoples. One Aztec tribute list indicates the tribute — the number 
of bales of cotton, polished tortoise shells, rare jaguar skins and quetzal feathers, 
and other goods — expected to be paid annually by a conquered chiefdom. The 
Aztecs were so demanding in their tribute lists, though, that when the conquis-
tadores arrived in 1519, they quickly enlisted the help of disgruntled conquered 
chiefdoms to overthrow their Aztec lords. (It worked, but it later backfired when 
the conquistadores enslaved their momentary allies.)
Non-food production specialists
Non-food production specialists (also known as occupational specialists) were 
people engaged in activities other than food production. These multitudes 
included cobblers, jewelers, priests, tax collectors, military personnel (from 
officers to soldiers), sea captains and their crews, tailors, smiths, masons, 
woodworkers, and on and on. Because they engaged full-time in their non-
food production work, they had to be compensated, housed, and fed, and 

179
 Chapter 10: The Development of Civilization
this demand in turn kept farmers and yet more specialists (such as scribes to 
keep track of everything with written records) employed. Each of these citi-
zens was engaged in a complex non-food production economy.
Astronomy and/or mathematics
The religious systems of ancient civilizations were all acutely aware that no 
matter what spells they cast or gods they tried to influence, one kind of phe-
nomenon was completely beyond their control: the actions of the heavenly 
bodies. The appearance, disappearance, movement, and so on of the lights in 
the sky — stars, comets, planets, and so on — simply couldn’t be influenced. 
For this reason (and others, I’m sure), these lights were ascribed to the realm 
of the supernatural, and ancient astronomers kept careful track of the hap-
penings in the sky, making observations and keeping records in attempts 
to understand that realm. Observations often took place from specially 
constructed observatories, such as the Inca’s stone towers and the top of 
Sumerian ziggurats (pyramids), and the piling up of records about the lights 
in the sky drove the evolution of mathematics, the manipulation of numbers 
to carry out operations and identify patterns. The durable record-keeping 
of priests and scribes helped manage all this activity; each of these record-
keepers qualified as a non-food production specialist.
Monumental architecture
Each ancient civilization impressed its citizens (and its rivals and enemies) 
with massive architectural works meant to display the civilization’s might. 
Some works had other, more utilitarian functions, like the Great Wall of China 
(to keep out invaders, but — some argue — just as importantly to remind 
Shang citizens that they were Shang citizens) or the 12,000 miles of stone-
paved roads in the Incan empire (used to efficiently transport troops and 
supplies across the mountainous terrain). In the end, monumental architec-
ture was an important part of ancient civilized economies because it required 
massive effort to build and maintain. One archaeologist has estimated that 
the Incan fortress of Sacsahuman, on a hill above the capital of Cuzco, took 
a workforce of 20,000 people 20 years to build. The champion monumental 
works, of course, are the three massive pyramids of Egypt’s Gizeh plateau. 
Built around 4,500 years ago, these monuments to the greatness of Egypt still 
draw visitors today (including archaeologists; though I haven’t been there, I 
simply have to see them before I go into the ground!) Figure 10-2 shows the 
Sphinx of Egypt, with a pyramid in the background, when European archaeol-
ogists first carefully examined them in the early 1800s AD. Today the Sphinx 
has been excavated so that its entire body is visible, not just the head.

State religion
Civilizations have state-sanctioned religions that provide an interface between 
the material and spiritual realms for the citizenry. In ancient civilizations, these 
religions were normally polytheistic, having many gods that were considered 
responsible for many aspects of daily life. For example, in Mayan civilization, 
the rain god Chac determined the future of the harvests; in Egypt, the goddess 
Isis reigned over matters of the family, health, and motherhood. In ancient civi-
lizations, citizens rarely had the freedom of choice you enjoy today; in Aztec 
civilization, police ensured that all citizens attended religious rituals carried 
out at the massive pyramids.
State religions had a couple of important characteristics. First, they required 
a priestly class, whose main occupations were administering the religion 
through divination (making predictions based on the reading of omens), 
the maintenance of temples, and the scheduling and proper execution of 
ceremonies. Monumental architecture was also a key element in these reli-
gions; large, publically visible structures (often pyramids) were part of many 
ceremonies to remind citizens of their engagement in the state religion. See 
Chapter 16 for more on religion.

181
 Chapter 10: The Development of Civilization
Taxes
Every ancient civilization collected taxes from the citizens in exchange for 
protection from real or perceived threats and/or to provide public services 
such as municipal waterworks or access to state food supplies and other 
goods in times of hardship. Ancient Sumerians gave roughly a quarter of 
their harvest to the tax wagons that came by like clockwork, and Incan citi-
zens toiled at looms to make cloth, which was among the most valued of 
Inca material goods. Sometimes taxes were paid in labor, as in ancient Egypt, 
where entire families could be relocated to a builders’ village to work on the 
latest monument, temple complex, or pharaoh’s tomb. Inscription was also a 
common form of taxation, with male citizens being forcibly invited into mili-
tary service (as in Sparta and the Aztec civilization) for a number of years. 
Whatever the details, the citizenry provided the ruling elites with a massive 
wheel of economy through labor, material goods, and/or harvested foods.
Charting the Rise and Fall 
of the First Civilizations
Although each ancient civilization manifested the characteristics of civiliza-
tion (described in the preceding section) in different ways, they all mark a 
kind of human social organization that differs significantly from all others.
So when does all of this manifesting happen? When and where do the first 
civilizations occur? Figure 10-3 indicates a basic timeline of the ancient civili-
zations, and Figure 10-4 shows where they arose.
To get an idea of how civilization pans out in two completely isolated cases, 
the following sections look at Egypt and the Inca, civilizations that flourished in 
North Africa and in South America’s Andes Mountains, respectively. Although 
every ancient civilization was a little different, archaeologists may have a good 
point when they see so many similarities that they offhandedly comment, 
“After you’ve seen one ancient civilization, you’ve seen ’em all.”
Egypt
I don’t think I’ve ever met an archaeologist who wasn’t fascinated by Egypt. 
Whatever archeologists may study, from animal bones to chips of stone, they 
seem to love Egypt for its majestic architecture, the romantic notions of its 
early exploration by eccentric Europeans, and the splendors of the tombs of 
the pharaohs. I simply couldn’t write this book without sketching out a few of 
its characteristics.

Chronology and origins
The origins of Egypt reach back to around 3,000 BC (5,000 BP), when King 
Narmer (also known as Menes) united the farming communities of Upper and 
Lower Egypt. Narmer — shown on one ancient tablet smiting a rival chief — 
was the first pharaoh of Egypt. The concepts of civilization in Egypt may have 
been provided by Sumer, where the world’s first civilization was already well 

183
 Chapter 10: The Development of Civilization
underway (refer to Figure 10-3), but Egypt was clearly its own creation and 
not a product of Sumer.
The origins of Egyptian civilization, then, seem to be in conquest; the might 
of Narmer was too great for anyone to resist. Narmer and the other pharaohs 
were depicted wearing crowns displaying both the cobra (the symbol of 
Lower Egypt) and the vulture (the symbol of Upper Egypt).
Flourishing
Egypt flourished as an active, energetic civilization for about 3,000 years, 
from 3,000 BC (5,000 BP) to 300 BC (2,300 BP). During this time — despite 
two dark ages marked by chaos and the breakdown of the state institutions 
of religion and taxation — Egypt was a distinctive entity with a pantheon of 
hundreds of gods and goddesses believed to rule the supernatural world that 
was the ultimate destination of every person. Thousands of priests and other 
religious officials were in charge of keeping track of the deities’ actions, and 
appeasing them to maintain a harmonious world and civilization; in Egypt, 
modern ideas of “religion” didn’t even have names because they were inter-
woven into every aspect of life.
Both the ruling elites and the commoners spent considerable time and 
energy in their preparation for the afterlife, which ultimately resulted in 
mummification (for those who could afford it) and burial in a tomb. Modest, 
apartment-sized tombs could be within the means of a well-to-do family.
Common people worked in many occupations; males often went into the 
armed forces (voluntarily or otherwise), and some were lucky enough to go 
to school as scribes. Women found employment as musicians, priestesses, 
or treasurers. Most of the citizens of ancient Egypt, of course, were farmers 
or people associated with the great agricultural engine that carried the civi-
lization. I think my fantasy job in Egypt would have been as a long-distance 
trader sailing down the Nile and then out into the Mediterranean to meet 
Phoenician or Minoan trading partners in their ships.
Decline and how it ended
Some civilizations were overthrown from outside, and others decayed from 
within. Some of each occurred in Egypt; it suffered heavy blows when invad-
ing Persians defeated it in the 500s BC (2,500 BP), but it also weakened with 
civil war and breakdowns of religious institutions. Just as today, people in 
the ancient world were ready to die fighting for their religions, and when 
invaders destroyed temples (or the state could no longer finance them), the 
fabric of civilization often frayed.

184
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
Egypt faced many attacks throughout history; everyone wanted to get their 
hands on the fertile banks of the Nile River, one of the great farmlands on 
Earth. In the 600s BC, attacks came from the Assyrians, members of a fear-
some warrior civilization based in what is today’s Northern Iraq. A cen-
tury later, the Persians showed up, and in 330 BC Alexander of Macedon 
(Alexander the Great; Macedon is Greece) invaded Egypt and made himself 
pharaoh. One of the greatest, longest-lived civilizations of the world had 
effectively come to an end.
Inca
In contrast to Egypt, Incan civilization lasted only a few centuries; it was also 
a New World civilization, emerging and flourishing in what are today Peru 
and Ecuador.
Chronology and origins
The Incan empire begins long after Dynastic Egypt was dust, and at the same 
time as medieval Europe in the 1400s AD. Around this time, a number of com-
peting chiefdoms of the Cuzco region of highland Peru — each very powerful 
and populous, and bordering on being a civilization in its own right — unified 
as a single entity after being conquered, one after another. As in Egypt, then, 
the origins of the Incan empire are rooted in conquest.
 
Be careful with the idea that only one factor (in this case, military rule) can 
account for the origins of all civilizations; for instance, Harappa, on modern 
Pakistan’s Indus River, shows no sign of such military origins to its civilization. 
Time and again, I’ve found that -isms and single-factor models just don’t work 
in explaining humanity. That doesn’t mean you can’t know anything about 
humanity, only that attributing major trends to single factors normally just 
doesn’t pan out.
Although the Incan mythology names some important early ruling families 
engaged in the conquest of their neighbors, archaeologists have found evidence 
suggesting that many successive leaders took several centuries to conquer and 
bring their neighbors into submission. But the Incan elites preferred a simple 
ideological story of lightning victory, so it seems they invented a narrative; pro-
paganda is found throughout the ancient civilizations.
Flourishing
The Incan empire — which flourished from about 1400 AD to 1532 AD, when 
it was conquered by the conquistador Pizarro — spread rapidly from Cuzco, 
building a massive, 12,000-mile road network to move their troops from place 
to place for military conquests and to put down revolts. They conquered 
peoples of Ecuador to the north and peoples of Chile to the south; the only 

185
 Chapter 10: The Development of Civilization
directions they didn’t expand were west (because there lay the Pacific 
Ocean) or east (because there lay the vast Amazon basin). One after another, 
anyone who couldn’t resist Incan domination was quickly subjugated; to pre-
serve a little of the conquered peoples self-respect and prevent uprisings, the 
leaders of the conquered became regional governors — honorary pseudo-
Incas, if you will. Many of the Incan affairs were military in nature. Whereas 
Egypt fought largely defensive battles, or offensive ones to establish buffer 
states, for the Inca, civilization was about expansion and conquest.
 
As in other civilizations, the Inca conquered only some — not all — of their 
neighbors. They were better off to let the coastal Ecuadoreans (the Manteno 
people) alone; because these people were expert long-distance traders who 
imported ritually important goods that the Inca needed in their religious cer-
emonies, the Inca allowed them their independence. Such peripheral societies 
on the margins of civilization can have strong influences on civilizations.
As in Egypt, the Incan ruling elites (all blood members of a single royal 
family) ruled the millions of citizens for decades. Commoners enjoyed pro-
tection from invasion, but they paid a heavy price for it. Few objects actually 
belonged to individuals, and most everything was state property. Individual 
freedom was limited: Professions were assigned, and taxation on labor and 
produced goods was so high that individuals could do little to change their 
economic positions in life. Males were often drafted into various military 
adventures, and women engaged in tremendous amounts of spinning and 
weaving cotton and other textiles, which were more precious to the Inca than 
gold.
Decline and how it ended
Incan civilization came to a quick and violent end, rather than the protracted 
weakening that brought down Egypt. The conquistadores arrived in 1526, 
and by 1532, they defeated the civilization, which was weakened by European 
disease (as well as wracked by civil war even before the conquistadores 
arrived). Like the Aztecs of Mexico (defeated by Cortez), the Incan collapse 
was swift.
Civilization Today: Will It Fall, Too?
What’s the meaning of the word civilization today? What’s the difference 
between Western and Eastern civilization? To be honest, that’s hard to say. 
The sheer volume of communication and interaction in the modern world 
seems to create more commonalities and connections than clear lines 
demarking people and ideas. Today, civilization may best be considered an 
economic phenomenon that binds many diverse people and perhaps the 
world population.

186
Par t II: Physical Anthropology and Archaeology 
All things considered, I think it’s possible to spot characteristics of a distinc-
tively Western civilization today. It’s the civilization that has spread globally. 
It’s the reason millions in India wear suits and ties rather than the indig-
enous clothes they wore a century ago. It’s the civilization best typified by 
Europeans and North Americans.
Western civilization has its roots in Greece about 500 BC (2,500 BP), and 
Rome, which rose as Greece declined. Mainland Europe didn’t have civiliza-
tion until it was directly imposed on them by the Romans, who came up from 
Italy in the southeast; in the 50s BC, Julius Caesar brought the concepts of 
cities, occupational specialization, money, and so on to mainland Europe, 
which at the time was a vast province of competing farming chiefdoms. And 
by 476 AD, Rome itself was dead, conquered by its enemies after being over-
extended too far on too many battlefields. For the next thousand years, the 
fragmentation and disunity in dark-age or medieval Europe is hard to really 
call a civilization, if you compare it with the splendors of Egypt or the Aztecs 
at their height.
So should you start planning for the fall of Western civilization? You often 
hear that the civilization is waning, and it may be; however, it’s a massive and 
powerful juggernaut, an engine of immense power and complexity. It takes 
some imagining to consider a loss of all unity such that the peoples of North 
America and Europe would suddenly be living as semi-independent farming 
villages, perhaps ruled by chieftains of some kind.
The force of the disruption needed to bring this end about seems hard 
to imagine, but of course the forces of nature are far more powerful than 
humans are, and agriculture is clearly fragile. A few years of crop failures, 
and the whole structure could fall apart. And, of course, every country and 
its brother seem to have or want nuclear weapons; though the Cold War is 
over, it could restart. As a teenager, I often wondered when coming home 
from a camping trip whether the cities could have been wiped out while I was 
in the mountains.
Finally, remember that the citizens of the Classical civilizations of Egypt, 
Greece, Rome, or the Incan empire couldn’t have imagined their own ends. 
Each thought of their world as entirely modern, the pinnacle of human exis-
tence, the best way to live, and the one way that would never fall apart. And 
today they’re all dust.

Cultural 
Anthropology and 
Linguistics

In this part . . .
H
umans talk (a lot), and what they talk about 
depends on the culture they grew up in, be it 
Armenian or American. So why do humans talk so much? 
And what’s culture, anyway? This part answers these 
questions by introducing cultural and linguistic anthro-
pology and discussing culture, language, and the related 
issues of race and ethnicity, religion, politics, and gender.

O
ne basic question about humanity is “Why aren’t all cultures the same?” 
That is, if all humans are basically biologically the same, why don’t we 
all have the same behaviors? At the root of the answer is the fact that human 
behavior isn’t guided largely by instinct; it’s guided by culture, by the infor-
mation that you learn in the course of life.
Surviving by relying on cultural information is one of humanity’s most dis-
tinctive characteristics, so this whole chapter is devoted to what culture is 
(and isn’t) and how it changes through time.
Demystifying the Definition of Culture
A lot of fuzziness surrounds the definition of culture. Culture isn’t an easily 
defined entity. Where do you draw the line between, say, English culture and 
American culture? They’re more similar to one another than either is to polar 
Inuit culture, but they’re clearly not the same. At the very least, they drive on 
opposite sides of the road.
Never fear. I’m here to clear the air by listing some characteristics of culture 
that not only explain it better but also show you why culture is so difficult to 
define:
 
 Culture exists in the abstract only. Culture is often talked about as 
though it is a thing, a concrete entity, a noun. But actually culture is a 
whole nebulous set of ideas, and it’s hard to draw a line around. Even 
though you, the reader, and I, the writer, may both say we belong to 

190
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
“American” culture (and some extraterrestrial anthropologist observing 
our behavior patterns would probably agree), we probably have many 
differences; not all of our ideas are the same.
 
 Cultures contain subcultures. To further blur the picture, remember 
that cultures can contain all manner of subdivisions, such as subcultures 
(for example, the “Elvis impersonator” subculture in the U.S. or Japan’s 
“1950’s Pop Americana” subculture) or ethnic groups (people who share 
specific geographical, historical, and cultural roots, such as Sicilian 
Americans). These divisions are defined in many ways; for the moment, 
just keep in mind that they’re subdivisions within a larger culture. 
You can learn more about such subdivisions, like ethnic groups, in 
Chapters 14 and 17.
 
 Culture constantly changes. Keep in mind that culture isn’t a concrete 
thing or entity; it’s a cloud of ideas, a set that changes and varies from 
mind to mind. Because the characteristics are always changing, no cul-
ture is an easily defined block.
 
 Culture adapts, but not perfectly. Just because cultures can adapt to 
various environments worldwide doesn’t mean that every culture is per-
fectly adapted to its environment. A culture can develop maladaptations, 
behaviors that aren’t good for the population. For example, overcon-
sumption of resources may be adaptive in the short run but doesn’t 
work in the long run because resources are depleted to collapse.
 
 Cultures contain conflicts. Cultures aren’t all sweetness and light with 
regard to the interactions of their members; conflicts inevitably rise 
within cultures. In every culture, forces work to promote innovation, 
and other forces oppose them to promote conservatism. I don’t know of 
any culture that goes for long without some kind of social friction.
What Culture Is and What Culture Isn’t
Culture has been defined hundreds of times. Because cultural anthropolo-
gists disagree on exactly what culture is, most anthropology texts define it in 
slightly different ways. Still, most anthropologists agree on some basic prop-
erties, the most important being that information is handed down from one 
generation to the next (mainly through language) rather than inherited genet-
ically. The real significance of culture is that it directs human behavior much 
more than simple instinct or reflex does.
For better or worse, humans are guided by what they learn, not just by 
instinct. Every myth, symbol, point of etiquette, prayer, war-whoop, greeting, 
insulting phrase, ideological stance, food preference, all of it — all of that is 
culture. For this reason, I think of culture as a set of ideas about what the uni-
verse is like and how to behave in it (or, a little more flippantly, what I’m sup-
posed to do about it).

191
 Chapter 11: The Spice of Life: Human Culture
Culture versus cultured
Culture is the whole set of ideas and beliefs shared by a group of people 
about their world and how they should act in that world. Your cultural ideas 
tell you how to greet your neighbors, what foods are suitable for certain 
occasions, who your friends and enemies are, and generally how you should 
act in the world. Cultural ideas don’t ride on the genes: You don’t get them 
by instinct. You get them from your parents, at first, and later from your 
peers, books, the Internet, television, and any other kind of media. Now, you 
may choose not to believe what you read in the paper or see on TV, and 
that’s fine; the point is that culture comes to humanity in all kinds of media, 
from conversations with friends and family to what you read on the Web, 
hear over the radio, and so on. Culture is the spice of human life; it’s what 
makes people different around the world.
And although this all seems obvious, it has profound implications. Every 
other animal life form operates by instinct, and, in some species, a little of 
what they learn during their lifetime. But humans learn not just what their 
parents know, but what their parents’ parents knew, and what their neigh-
bors and friends know, and what those parents’ and neighbors’ parents and 
neighbors knew, and so on. In this way human culture is distinctly cumula-
tive over time. It’s an ever-expanding archive. It ensures that — unless your 
ideas are really out of vogue — your ideas will survive you. Although other 
animals leave behind only skeletons, humans leave behind ideas as well.
Keep in mind that other animals — notably other primates — do survive by 
learning a lot from their parents. But only humans are absolutely dependent 
on culture to survive. You’ll learn just why throughout this chapter.
 
Culture, then, isn’t just high art, the opera, or the product of an elite educa-
tion; it’s simply information. A given cultural information set would contain the 
opera (by containing the definition of opera and how it’s to be staged, sung, 
scripted, and attended), and people with elite educations may acquire more 
cultural information through learning (which they’ll be sure to let you know), 
but culture itself is just information without any connotation of high-status 
lifestyles.
Why human behavior differs
Why isn’t every human culture the same? For example, why do some cultures 
believe in monogamy (males having one wife,) and some in polygamy (men 
having several wives)? Cultures and behaviors differ for a number of reasons:
 
 Ecological determinism: Cultures directly reflect their physical environ-
ment. So cultures are tailored to the environment in which the people 
live. Clearly, desert peoples’ culture will differ from the culture of folks 
who live in rain forests.

192
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
 
 Of course, no -ism is ever perfect. For example, many in the 19th century 
thought hot climates promoted sloth, which is why civilization was cen-
tered in cooler Europe. This theory conveniently ignored the fact that 
many of the great ancient civilizations (think Egypt, Sumer, Aztec) arose 
in hot regions.
 
 Encounters with other cultures: Another reason for cultural diversity is 
that groups of people move from place to place and exchange ideas 
when they encounter other cultures in those movements. As a result of 
these encounters, each culture is slightly altered.
 
 Internal change: Cultures can also change internally by themselves so 
that over time they differ from other cultures. How this change happens 
is the study of cultural innovation, a fascinating topic I discuss later in 
this chapter.
In fact, each culture is shaped by each of these factors, creating nearly end-
less diversity and complexity. In cultural evolution, nothing is simple.
Cultural Universals
Although the specific characteristics of any given culture are unlikely to be 
the same as those of another, there are some cultural universals, things that 
each culture has specific instructions for how to do appropriately (although 
what’s considered appropriate differs per culture.) These concepts include
 
 Communication: Each culture has a distinctive way of speaking and a 
set of gestures — including body language — used to describe the world 
and to move all the cultural information from one generation to the next 
(as well as to move cultural information around among the members of a 
current generation).
 
 Languages change over time, and several cultures may in fact share the 
same language or dialects of the same language.
 
 Ethical/justice system: Every culture has rules about truth-telling, killing, 
and stealing (even if the concept of personal property isn’t as strongly 
developed as in other cultures) and specific ways of administering jus-
tice when ethical codes get broken.
 
 Right and responsibility assignments by age and gender group: All 
cultures have concepts of what are appropriate behaviors for people 
of different age ranges or life stages (for example, infant or adult) and 
different genders; generally speaking, much of this has to do with the 
division of labor in the culture.

 Chapter 11: The Spice of Life: Human Culture
Ejengi: the living forest
Among the BaAka Pygmy hunter-gatherers 
of the Central African rainforests is a custom 
known as the Ejengi dance. Ejengi is the BaAka 
name for the spirit of the rainforest. As hunter–
gatherers, the BaAka depend on the rainforest 
during much of the year for their livelihood. Their 
shelter and food all comes from the forest, and 
more importantly, their knowledge of the forest. 
To survive in the rainforest, the BaAka have to 
know exactly where to hunt at what times of 
day and which times of the year. They have to 
know which plants are edible (and which are 
good medicine) and where to find them in the 
forest, and they need to know where the water 
sources are. They also must learn how to avoid 
dangers, such as elephants and gorillas — 
which are both extremely territorial and can 
attack intruders — and how to avoid snakes 
and other poisonous animals.
Because they rely so heavily on the forest for 
their survival, it’s not surprising that they view 
the forest as a living entity, with the rewards 
of food, water, and shelter to those who know 
and understand the forest and the punishment 
of hunger, disease, and possible death for those 
who don’t. The BaAka talk of being able to “see” 
Ejengi; the younger children learn how to “see” 
the forest spirit from their parents and older sib-
lings by living with them in the rainforest for long 
periods of time. During the times of year when 
they’re not living in the rainforest but rather in 
clearings near small farming villages, the BaAka 
and their children often have an Ejengi dance.
These dances usually take place at dusk or in the 
evening, are often unplanned, and occur some-
thing like this: As older boys and men begin to 
drum and the women lead the younger children in 
song and teach them to dance to the rhythm, one 
of the village elders slips away from the group 
and dons a costume made from raffia fibers (the 
bark of a vine common in Central Africa). The cos-
tume is relatively simple; the fibers from the vine 
have been made into many strings attached to a 
wide-brimmed straw hat. The fibers hang down 
from the brim of the hat to the feet. The costumed 
elder slowly dances from the edge of the forest 
and over to the children who squeal with delight 
as he twirls around and the strings fly out. The 
women encourage the children to get close to 
Ejengi as he dances around, but not to let him get 
close enough to grab them. The children each 
run up and try to touch the swirling strings, but 
if Ejengi starts to dance over to one of them, they 
run from him, laughing, and try to circle to another 
side of him (a relatively difficult task considering 
the fiber strings completely cover the face and 
body of the wearer, and the children can’t tell 
his front from his back!) and touch his swirling 
strings again.
As part of their study of other cultures, anthro-
pologists try to understand and explain human 
behavior. Is this behavior of the BaAka “just 
something they do?” Or is there a deeper mean-
ing to it, something that the BaAka adults may 
not even be aware of? A functionalist anthro-
pologist (read more on functionalism in Chapter 
12) would probably say yes. In essence, func-
tionalism holds that there is an adaptive pur-
pose behind the behaviors and ceremonies of a 
culture, and somehow behavior or laws or cus-
toms help the society in question better survive 
in its environment. In the case of the BaAka, a 
functionalist interpretation of the Ejengi dance 
would go something like this:
The belief that the rainforest isn’t so much a 
place or a thing but a spirit; Ejengi, that can be 
known like one person can get to know another, 
makes it easier for the BaAka children to under-
stand that they can and need to “see Ejengi,” or 
learn about the forest. The fact that the children 
are encouraged by the women to run up and get 
close enough to touch Ejengi, but also to run 
from him if he starts to chase them reinforces to 
the BaAka children not only the importance of 
their traditional forest environment but also the 
need to be wary of the dangers it contains.

194
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
 
 Mythos/ideology: Cultures have distinctive concepts of the 
supernatural — often ritualized in religion — as well as ideological, 
political, and economic positions; these distinctions are often the 
source of cultural friction between those who prefer innovation and 
those who prefer conservatism.
 
 Bodily decoration and/or clothing: Cultures have distinctive ways of 
expressing themselves by adorning the body directly (think Maori tat-
toos and East Indians’ hennaed hands) and/or by wearing distinctive 
clothing (such as the robe-like clothing of the Berbers of Tunisia); 
“style,” as people normally think of it, is usually about identity, although 
globalization has dampened the wearing of distinctive ethnic clothing in 
some areas, such as in China, where Western clothing predominates.
 
 Family structure: Although family structure varies widely, every culture 
has guidelines for what it considers a family, a social unit typically com-
posed of married people, their offspring, and possibly other relatives. 
(You can read more about families in Chapter 15.)
 
 Sexual regulations: Cultures have incest taboos — rules against procre-
ating with close kin — that prevent the ill effects of a small genetic pool.
 
 Food preferences: Cultures have distinctive concepts of what tastes 
good or bad and what foods are appropriate at different social functions.
Having an Out-of-Body Experience
Although identifying exactly what culture is presents problems, I can safely 
say that, generally speaking, cultural behavior is humanity’s most important 
way of adapting and surviving. Humans don’t rely on their bodies so much as 
on their behavior and tools to adapt. In this way, some have defined culture 
as humanity’s “extrasomatic means of adaptation.” This technical term basi-
cally just highlights the fact that human adaptations are mostly nonbodily, 
which is important to understanding humanity (and makes a great conversa-
tion starter at parties).
It’s easy to think of the extrasomatic means of adaptation as just the objects 
made by people to survive; these objects (like a fur coat in the Arctic) are 
normally called material culture. But much more is involved. Again, culture is 
the whole set of group-specific information people acquire throughout their 
lives, including instructions for behavior, the definition and justification of 
values, and the instructions for making material objects. In the sections that 
follow, I explain each aspect of this group-specific information, along with the 
implications of adapting to this information.

195
 Chapter 11: The Spice of Life: Human Culture
Adaptation and its implications
One of the unique characteristics of humanity is that we survive and adapt to 
our environments culturally as well as biologically. For example, our essen-
tially subtropical body form isn’t well suited to life in the Arctic because we 
don’t have the fur of polar bears or the thick, insulating blubber of sea mam-
mals. But we can make fur clothing, shelters to contain warmth, and weapons 
with which to hunt and defend ourselves. These items are cultural adapta-
tions and nice examples of “extrasomatic adaptation.”
 
The extrasomatic definition of culture emphasizes evolution by highlighting 
how culture is used to survive the natural world; keep in mind, though, that 
people must also survive the cultural world they inhabit, and that’s just as 
important. For example, if you don’t greet your neighbors the right way, you 
may cause bad feelings; in the same way, your grandfather may not appreciate 
your elaborate, back-slapping handshake the same way your buddy does. So 
although culture does help you survive the natural world, it also tells you how 
to survive the cultural world of social interactions.
A focus on culture as extrasomatic adaptation has some important implica-
tions First, because culture isn’t carried on the genes, it has to be passed on 
to the next generation socially; in societies without writing, that means 
myths, fables, and other aids to memory known as oral tradition. Also, aspects 
of culture that directly relate to physical survival (such as when to migrate to 
a certain area to pick berries or hunt a particular animal) are relatively slow 
to change because they’re so important to survival. However, despite conser-
vatism in some aspects, cultures can promote innovation and experimenta-
tion, and behaviors or inventions that are useful in promoting survival are 
often quickly adopted.
Behaviors
Think of behavioral elements of culture as the things you’re supposed to do 
or not do in a given situation. For example, in many Native American societ-
ies, people just moving through adolescence go on a spirit quest or vision 
quest to find a spirit animal that will guide them for life. The quest involves 
specific instructions for where the person is to go (often into the mountains, 
alone) and what he’s to do there (often, go without food or water, or deprive 
himself in some other physical way until he sees the spirit or vision).
Much of culture is about what behavior is and isn’t appropriate in any given 
circumstance. Learning it all is a constant process. Early in life, children nor-
mally get leeway for breaking the boundaries of appropriate behavior, but 
among adults breaking social customs can lead to everything from souring 

196
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
business transactions to war. Breaking normal behavioral limits is also a 
common form of comedy; you can laugh when Seinfeld character George 
Costanza double-dips his chips at a party after biting from them, but you’re 
not likely to try this practice yourself because it breaks some pretty serious 
social conventions about hygiene. Even if you do brush your teeth.
Values
Values are judgments of what’s good, bad, and in between in a given culture 
linked to the culture’s ethical/judicial system of ideas. In other words, they’re 
about what is and isn’t worthwhile, what is and isn’t desired.
Values are often broadly divided into judgments in the moral or aesthetic 
fields. Moral judgments typically deal with justice and personal interactions. 
They’re so basic to a culture’s sense of itself that they’re not the opinions of 
individuals but rather givens that (according to the members of a culture) 
don’t require justification; they’re often used to evaluate outsiders, which 
can lead to friction. Breaking moral conventions normally involves a victim 
and a perpetrator, and the conflict’s resolution involves the cultural system 
of the administration of justice.
Values may be taught formally or informally, but many receive so much repe-
tition every day, in every utterance and action of cultural members, that the 
values become common sense to members of the culture. However, they may 
100 percent American
In 1936, cultural anthropologist Ralph Linton 
published an essay in his book The Study of 
Man: An Introduction revealing a number of 
aspects of all-American life that actually origi-
nated in different countries. This humorous 
essay pointed out how much of American iden-
tity is actually rooted in the customs of other 
countries. 
For example, Linton pointed out, on a typical 
American morning “our solid American citi-
zen” sleeps in a bed built to a Middle-Eastern 
pattern that was modified in Europe before 
being exported to America, wears sleeping 
clothes invented in India, and washes with a 
kind of soap invented in ancient France. He 
then eats an orange — a fruit of the eastern 
Mediterranean — for breakfast with maybe 
a slice of cantaloupe (from Persia — today 
called Iran), a cup of coffee (first domesticated 
in the Arabian peninsula), eggs from an animal 
first domesticated in Southeast Asia, and “thin 
strips of the flesh” of a pig, first domesticated in 
the Near East and cured by a process invented 
in Northern Europe.
 “[H]e reads the news of the day, imprinted in 
characters invented by the Semites upon a mate-
rial invented in China by a process invented in 
Germany. As he absorbs the account of foreign 
troubles he will, if he is a good conservative citi-
zen, thank a Hebrew deity in an Indo-European 
language that he is 100 percent American.”

197
 Chapter 11: The Spice of Life: Human Culture
not make so much sense to people from another culture, and when cultures 
bearing deeply held but fundamentally differing value systems come into con-
tact, situations can get difficult.
Aesthetic judgments, such as preferences in artistic expression, are also cul-
tural. Aesthetic judgments are endlessly varied and each has a complex his-
tory; imagine the artistic styles of Western civilization, from Greek to 
Postmodern visual art, for example. Social, economic, religious, and moral 
concerns are all involved in shaping the aesthetic ideals of a given culture at 
any given time.
Objects
Items made or used by humans are called material culture. Material culture 
isn’t just limited to tools for physical survival. Every object, from a distinc-
tive wedding costume to an ancient Greek clay container for transporting 
wine to your car or bicycle, is a cultural object.
Even seemingly mundane objects carry cultural information in their design 
and/or decoration. Credit cards, for example, often bear images of what card-
holders value, like mountains, a cityscape, or a piece of art; these designs are 
cultural information that they’ve selected from a pool of options to say some-
thing about themselves. Even if you don’t buy into this business of having 
fancy images on your credit card, that decision also says something about 
you; you may even be proud of your plain, nonconformist card (which, of 
course, is a statement in itself). Figure 11-1 shows a woman from Myanmar 
showing her cultural identity with traditional dress and ornamentation such 
as earplugs and necklaces.

Language: Passing the baton of culture
Language moves information; therefore, language is important to culture 
because culture is cumulative. Cultural information has grown through time, 
such that today humans fill libraries and archives with information they want 
to remember. This accumulative nature of culture has allowed for the adapta-
tion of behavior to the environment. Every new fact allows a potentially 
better understanding of the world. This applies not just to current Western 
civilization but to all cultures worldwide across time. Of course, just because 
things are better understood, doesn’t mean that cultures necessarily act on 
that understanding.
 
In this case, the environment means both the physical environment, such as 
the desert ecosystem inhabited by the Paiute Indians of the American South-
west, as well as the social environment, such as the interactions among 
ancient Polynesian chiefs and their subjects.
Over time, human culture has grown to today’s massive, unmanageable size. 
How did cultures organize and communicate everything they needed to com-
municate without libraries or other means of storing information outside the 
body? In many societies, the answer has been “through language,” often in 
the form of myths that represent or symbolize a culture’s basic ideas and 
values. Traditional myths aren’t just stories to be told around the hearth; 
they normally pass on lots of traditional knowledge. The human mind best 
remembers stories with a beginning, middle, and end, and the narrative 
structure of myths is an important aid to memory.
 
Storing cultural information outside the body is called external data storage; its 
invention by around 75,000 years ago (probably in Africa — you can read 
more about this in Chapter 7) was a major event in the history of human mind 
evolution. It allowed for storage of an effectively infinite amount of cultural 
information that would otherwise be subject to the limits of human memory.
Opening Your Human Behavior 
Owner’s Manual
The fact that you can reduce culture (in an analytical sense) to a set of 
instructions for behavior has some important effects, including the ability to 
conceptualize and study human culture as information that’s transferred 
from one mind to another by language. That ability is significant because, as 
scientists have learned more about how language, memory, and the mind 
work, they’ve gained a better understanding of how culture actually is stored 
in the mind, recalled by memory, and processed by language.

199
 Chapter 11: The Spice of Life: Human Culture
Culture = software, brain = hardware
Although many anthropologists don’t like the following analogy for the brain 
and culture, I think it’s effective and useful so long as you don’t take it too far. 
I trust you not to do that. The analogy I’m talking about is that of the mind as 
a computer. This analogy has gotten a bad rap due to its oversimplification 
of both culture and the brain, but it works if you remember that it’s just an 
analogy.
In this analogy, the brain is the hardware, roughly equivalent to your PC with 
a basic operating system onboard (like your hard-wired capacity for lan-
guage). (You can read more about the nature of language in Chapter 12.) 
Culture is the software you add into your computer/brain, for example, by 
loading games, music, or a word processor (all legally obtained, of course).
This parallel allows the understanding of culture as a set of information in the 
mind of an individual. Other individuals may share much of that information, 
but no two are identical (just as two people may buy the same computer 
model but load it with different programs). This example allows you to under-
stand the individuality of each human and avoid the stereotypical conception 
of a culture.
 
The brain is a physical object, composed of neurons (specialized brain cells); 
memory is stored as the connections between certain neurons in certain parts 
of the brain, and the mind is what the brain does, such as retrieve or archive 
memories and process information.
Problems with the software/
hardware analogy
The hardware/software analogy has its problems, though, so the following 
are a few caveats to keep in mind:
 
 The brain is far more complex than any computer. Yes, the brain is a 
memory storage-and-retrieval device, but the way it stores and associ-
ates memories is fantastically more complex than anyone ever sus-
pected when people began experiments in artificial intelligence 
programming.
 
 The mind is far more complex than any computer program. Although 
some computer programs can beat humans in games, nobody has suc-
ceeded in getting a computer to really understand or compose a poem 
with intent or become self-aware and capable of intelligent thought.

200
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
 
 Culture is far more complex than any computer program. Not only that, 
but it’s ever-changing, and although computers can simulate the move-
ment of ideas in a culture, such simulations are crude because they can’t 
simulate the complexities of each individual mind through which the 
information is filtered, interpreted, and then passed on to the next mind.
So always remember that although the analogy has some uses, you shouldn’t 
take it too far.
Getting Your Cultural Education
Enculturation is a lifelong process during which humans are continuously 
loaded with cultural information. During childhood, humans pay a lot more 
attention to discrete enculturation, in which parents basically teach their chil-
dren how to be functional members of the culture. The children aren’t just 
learning how to react to situations, though: Through the very words, sym-
bols, and myths they learn to describe their world, children also learn how to 
perceive and understand their world.
Some enculturation occurs formally — in Western society, people send chil-
dren to school. It also happens informally as children learn what’s appropri-
ate (and what’s inappropriate) behavior in a home setting. Later, as people 
move away and/or build their own families as adults, enculturation continues 
(often largely without formalities) as people continue to learn about their 
place in their culture. In the following sections I explain the stages of life and 
how people learn in each of those stages.
Life stages
Every culture has ideas of what are appropriate activities, rights, and respon-
sibilities for each gender and age group, and all this information spreads 
through enculturation. Many cultures recognize at least the following stages 
even though the ages they represent vary from culture to culture; for exam-
ple, in Iceland in the early 1900s, old age would have been in the 30s for both 
men and women, who died very early compared to Americans today.
 
 Infancy: Someone (parents, siblings, other relatives, and so on) cares 
for the individual.
 
 Childhood: The individual begins to form a distinctive personality, 
takes steps towards certain possible futures, and takes on more 
responsibilities.

201
 Chapter 11: The Spice of Life: Human Culture
 
 Sexual maturity (sometimes known as “puberty”): The individual has 
the potential to become a parent and learns all the attendant rules of 
sexual behavior.
 
 Adulthood: The individual achieves economic security, marries, and 
raises children (at least ideally for most cultures.)
 
 Old age: The individual may be relieved of some responsibilities (such 
as some physical labor) and assigned others (such as making decisions 
about inheritance.)
Because every member of a culture is affected by the various rights, roles, 
and responsibilities of their position in the stages of life, anthropologists 
spend a lot of time identifying just how these life stages play out.
Stages of human learning
Although each culture has its own way of bringing up children, French biolo-
gist Jean Piaget identified some cross-cultural universal stages of learning 
that are important for understanding enculturation.
 
 The Sensory-Motor stage (birth–18 months): The child learns motor 
control (which influences cultural gestures and postures later in life) as 
well as identifies herself as an individual.
 
 The Preoperational stage (18 months–7 years): The child acquires the 
functional language that describes her universe by about 3 years old. 
Fully developed language comes in a later stage; therefore, the child 
doesn’t fully appreciate deep symbols such as complex metaphors at 
this time.
 
 The Concrete operational stage (7 years–11 years): The child acquires 
logical understanding of physical properties, such as numbers and 
weights, and the ability to step out of the self and begin to think from 
the perspectives of other people. Her understanding of metaphor also 
increases.
 
 The Formal operational stage (from 11 years on): The child acquires 
adult reasoning, allowing her to use and generate deeply symbolic 
metaphors.
Although these stages exist in all human cultures, the length of each stage 
varies. Still, most agree that Piaget identified the basic stages of learning in 
humans.

From Mop-Tops to Mötley Crüe: 
What Is Cultural Change?
One conclusion all anthropologists can agree on is that culture is dynamic, 
not static or unchanging; how else do you account for the difference in popu-
lar music between the Beatles in the 1960s and the so-called hair bands of the 
1980s? Does change like this just happen? No. Few cultures live, or have 
lived, in total isolation, and connections of marriage or trade have long fos-
tered the movement of ideas from one culture to another. Culture changes in 
several ways; most cultural anthropology textbooks discuss innovation and 
diffusion (which I cover in the following sections), but I also want to look at 
how culture evolves through time.
Diffusion versus assimilation
In anthropology, diffusion is the movement of cultural information from one 
population to another. It can happen in many ways, but migration and border 
diffusion are particularly important.
One way for culture to change is for migrating donors to move ideas to recipi-
ent cultures. Physical migration is the movement of people from one region to 
another. Because humans carry their culture in their brains (as sets of ideas) 
and sometimes in books or other external media, culture comes along for the 
ride when humans move. When cultures meet, ideas from one culture (the 
donor) almost invariably get transferred to the other (the recipient). What 
this really means is that people of the recipient culture begin to perceive and 
remember new ideas from people of the donor culture. Whether those ideas 
spread or are shunned (or some combination) depends on the circum-
stances. Of course, these cultural transactions rarely run one way; aspects of 
a recipient culture can rub off on a donor culture, reversing the roles and 
making the interaction that much more complex.
Another type of diffusion, border diffusion, happens when one culture borders 
on another and frequent interactions between the cultures promote the 
exchange of ideas, words, phrases, and even entire languages. This interac-
tion and exchange process is called acculturation.
Assimilation, on the other hand, is the inclusion or absorption of one culture 
into another, more dominant, culture. However, cultural information from the 
minority can have important effects on the dominant culture. For example, 
American rock-and-roll music (which is today widespread) originated at least 
in part from the early 1950s subculture of traditional African American folk 
music.

 Chapter 11: The Spice of Life: Human Culture
Innovation
Innovation is the new association of ideas; it’s what happens when two ideas 
that have never before been combined are combined to make a new idea. If 
social conditions are suitable and the idea is something communicable like 
an art or musical style, the innovation can spread and change the culture.
The key here is social conditions. People have to experience the innovation if 
they’re going to imitate and spread it, and many cultures use social mecha-
nisms such as censorship to prevent the spread of what they consider inap-
propriate or profane ideas. Today, an innovation is available worldwide the 
moment it reaches the Internet. Of course, millions (perhaps billions) 
of people do not have access to the Internet, and while information moves 
very rapidly today, it doesn’t affect or reach every human population in the 
same way.
Cultural Evolution
So does cultural change follow any particular pattern? Does culture evolve in 
steps or stages, from a simple to an advanced stage? Can you apply princi-
ples of biological evolution to cultural change?
The answer is yes, but carefully. Early attempts to apply evolutionary con-
cepts to the processes of culture change made a big mistake. At the time 
(the late 19th century), people thought evolution was trying to improve life 
forms — using some kind of intent or inner drive to strive toward the pinna-
cle of evolution (which was, predictably, the Victorian male Londoner). If this 
was the case, people reasoned, culture would do the same: Worldwide, every 
culture must be somewhere on a path from the simplest form (Savagery) 
to the most complex (Civilization). Later, anthropologists found that this 
wasn’t the case but that each culture was on its own path, and anthropology 
ditched the unilineal concept of cultural evolution.
Anthropology was wise to ditch the unilineal concept of culture change, but 
unfortunately anthropologists also began to dismiss any concepts of cultural 
evolution. Culture does, indeed evolve, as I describe in the following sections.

204
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
How culture evolves
Cultural information is moved from one mind to the next like genetic informa-
tion is moved from parent to offspring generations (although culture is passed 
on socially, not biologically). Not all the information is perfectly reproduced 
(or moved from mind to mind), just as genes aren’t perfectly reproduced; as 
in genetics, mutations are introduced to the population. Cultural variations 
are new ideas, or innovations. Along these lines, culture has the properties of 
an evolving system: Information is replicated, but not always perfectly, so it 
varies from individual to individual. Over time, variations spread or disap-
pear due to selection for certain variations and against others.
 
Cultural variations aren’t necessarily selected for because they make sense or 
are beneficial to everybody; many societies are hierarchically structured so 
that certain people, such as royal families, do much of the selection in cultural 
evolution. This bias leads directly to the consideration of power relationships: 
Who, in a given culture, has the power to select for certain ideas (by promot-
ing them in the media, for example), and who has the power to select against 
ideas (by practices like censorship)? These questions apply to Western civili-
zation as well as ancient Egypt, the Polynesian chiefdoms of the Pacific, and 
everyone in between.
For many reasons, archaeologists (in particular) and some cultural anthro-
pologists feel that these similarities between genetic and cultural information 
aren’t just trivial but rather very real and important to study.
What cultural evolution doesn’t mean
When you start thinking about the evolution of culture, keep in mind that
 
 Although natural selection (in the wild) has no intent and doesn’t try to 
shape change through time, humans do have intent and do try to shape 
culture over time — typically by promoting or resisting change.
 
 Although biological evolution really does improve the species over time 
(because only useful characteristics tend to be preserved), cultural evo-
lution doesn’t necessarily phase out aspects that aren’t good for every-
one (think racism).
 
 Although biological evolution is relatively slow, only moving information 
(genes) in one direction (from parent to offspring), members of a culture 
can share cultural information (ideas) among themselves within a given 
generation, such that cultural evolution is very fast.

ultural anthropology is the study of living humans and their societies, 
and all societies exist in some sort of physical space. The field is the 
space that an anthropologist visits in order to study and interact with the 
culture she’s studying, whether that space is in the Amazon, the Gobi desert, 
or downtown Chicago. In fact, one of the main ways that cultural anthropolo-
gists examine human cultures is by going into the field to experience ways of 
life different from those of Western civilization. (Anthropologists do study 
Western cultures, but this is more often the job of sociologists.)
The anthropologist does this fieldwork systematically by observing and 
recording every aspect of life very carefully — from calories consumed per 
day to drugs used to shamanic initiation rites performed. Such close observa-
tion leads to a better understanding of human life in all its variety, from the 
nomadic peoples of Mongolia to the foragers of the Amazon.
But cultural anthropologists don’t just barge into a village and start asking 
questions — not if they want to be welcomed by the local people and learn 

206
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
anything other than native curses. (Imagine what you would say if an 
Australian Aborigine appeared at your doorstep one day and asked to live 
with you and study you to fulfill his curiosity!) Anthropologists have devised 
many methods that enable them to do successful fieldwork and report their 
findings accurately.
In this chapter, you first get a brief history of the development of anthropol-
ogy. Then, you get to see how cultural anthropologists do their job and how 
valuable this kind of anthropology is for helping them gain a better under-
standing of humans everywhere.
Watching Cultural Anthropology Grow Up
Cultural anthropology has its roots in the 16th century during the Age of 
Discovery, a time when Europeans were discovering other continents and 
encountering the peoples who lived there. But the study of cultures has 
transformed dramatically since then, as I show you in this section.
Battling ethnocentrism
In the 16th century, Europeans referred to the people they encountered 
during their explorations as “Others.” The Europeans knew nothing of these 
native people — they weren’t, for example, accounted for in the Bible. 
Explorers often wrote detailed, vivid (and occasionally completely fictional) 
accounts describing how these people lived. These accounts were the only 
information people back in Europe had about newly discovered lands and 
people.
Most of the European explorers’ accounts were heavily ethnocentric, meaning 
they were written from the perspective of the explorer’s own society, such as 
explorers judging Native Americans from the Christian European perspective. 
Consider Figure 12-1, which shows a woodcut of Native Americans created by 
an artist in Europe who had never visited the Americas. It depicts the native 
people of what is today Paraguay. By European standards, their nakedness 
was shocking and taken as an indication of their supposed savagery. (For the 
native people, of course, the European habit of walking around heavily 
clothed in a hot environment was just as strange.)

Consider a present-day example. Say you’re an American tourist visiting Bali, 
Indonesia, and you observe a kite festival. From your perspective — which is 
that kites are flown for recreation — you may conclude that the Balinese are 
just playing, and that it’s funny to see adults doing so out in the fields. But 
actually the Balinese attach deep religious significance to the annual kite fes-
tival, in which the kites represent Hindu deities. The tradition holds that agri-
cultural success depends on how well teams from each village fly their kites. 
Because you don’t know this — and can only understand what the Balinese 
are doing based on what kite flying means in your own culture — your view 
that the kites are just toys is an ethnocentric interpretation.
Getting scientific
The flaws of ethnocentric accounts became more apparent as people started 
to travel more often and to interact more frequently with people from other 
cultures. At the same time, the value of studying other cultures became more 
apparent as well. As a result, in the early 20th century, anthropologists 
started taking some serious steps to improve the credibility of their work.

208
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
 
Many of the changes in the early 20th century came from a recognition that 
cultural anthropologists should attempt to understand other human cultures 
rather than judge them. This approach, called cultural relativism, promotes the 
idea that each culture should be understood in its own terms, rather than 
judged by outsiders. Cultural relativism is one of the cornerstones of cultural 
anthropology.
Another key factor in the changes that occurred in the early 20th century 
was the recognition that if anthropologists wanted to improve the credibility 
of their research results — so anthropology would be taken seriously as a 
discipline — their methods would have to be more scientific. That meant 
accomplishing several things:
 
 Defining their terms more clearly
 
 Building a comprehensive theoretical framework
 
 Developing ways of observing humanity more objectively than subjec-
tively (that is, without making value judgments)
Defining their terms
Anthropologists began to more clearly define exactly what they meant by 
terms such as marriage or even dance. Because different cultures expressed 
these things differently, defining them in ways that all anthropologists could 
agree on was important in order to understand them across cultures.
But this defining process has been harder than you may expect. For example, 
some anthropologists are content to say that human social groups can be 
classified in some major types, such as band, or tribe. But others say these 
are more artificial constructions, things that anthropologists expect to see 
(because of their theoretical perspective), rather than what’s actually there.
Still, a working vocabulary has been developed for cultural anthropology, 
allowing most cultural anthropologists to communicate. One online resource 
you may be interested in is oregonstate.edu/instruct/anth370/
gloss.html, Oregon State University’s “Definitions of Anthropological 
Terms” Web site.
Building a theoretical framework
By the early 20th century, many scientists used the scientific method to guide 
their research. Essentially, the scientific method says that you ask a ques-
tion, do some background research, create a hypothesis based on what you 
believe your research into that question may show, conduct the research, 
and then analyze the results.

209
 Chapter 12: From Kalahari to Minneapolis: How Cultural Anthropologists Work
As anthropologists worked to improve the credibility of their studies, they 
started to adopt (and adapt) the scientific method. The result was that they 
didn’t just haphazardly collect information about a culture by writing down 
observations about whatever happened to look most interesting. Instead, 
they would start with a topic of interest — for example, how Maori (native 
New Zealander) dance was used to remind Maoris of their ancestry and cul-
tural traditions — and then make observations specifically about that topic 
of interest.
Some cultural anthropologists began to make cross-cultural studies in which a 
theory was tested by seeing whether or not it accounted for cultural behav-
ior around the world. For example, many anthropologists knew that an incest 
taboo (a prohibition against sexual relationships among close blood rela-
tives) seemed to be present in all human societies. To be sure, anthropolo-
gist George Murdock first defined incest and then looked at anthropological 
literature on 250 societies worldwide to see whether it really was universal. It 
was, provided that incest was defined as sexual relationships between people 
within a nuclear family, a married couple cohabiting with children. In this 
way, Murdock was asking a question (in other words, defining a research 
problem), making his terminology clear, and then doing a large-scale study to 
answer the basic question — is the incest taboo universal in human culture?
 
Using a theoretical framework (a specific set of definitions and ideas that guide 
thinking about a particular question) to guide their research has certainly 
helped anthropologists up their game. But keep two key issues in mind:
 
 An anthropologist must be honest and forthright about his theoretical 
stance before going into the field. This ensures that the reader of the 
anthropologist’s work can see where the anthropologist is coming 
from — for example, if he or she sees the world through a particularly 
feminist lens — and be on the lookout for potential bias caused by that 
stance.
 
 Carrying too much theory into the field can lead to distortions, such that 
the anthropologist’s findings conveniently confirm his favorite theory; 
so although anthropologists tend to have ideas about what human cul-
ture is like in the first place, they try to keep their minds open to new 
possibilities and interpretations.
Promoting objectivity: Etic research
In the attempt to steer clear of ethnocentrism, anthropologists began to use a 
certain approach to field studies: the etic approach. It basically entails an 
anthropologist observing another society without really interacting with the 
people, focusing instead on how the anthropologist sees the culture he’s 
studying in a kind of detached way. Some say this is a good idea, but others 
argue that it ignores the reality of the culture itself and that an etic approach 
is simply invalid. The jury is still out on this issue.

210
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
Embodying the etic modernist 
approach: Bronislaw Malinowski
The changes that occurred in the early 20th century led to what anthropolo-
gists now call modernist cultural anthropology — characterized by a scien-
tific, systematic approach to the understanding of human diversity. This type 
of anthropology is perhaps best exemplified by Bronislaw Malinowski, who 
did fieldwork from about 1914 to 1918 among the Trobriand Islanders of 
Melanesia, an island northeast of Australia.
Raising the bar for ethnographies
An Austro-Hungarian citizen living in Australia at the start of World War I, 
Malinowski was exiled to the Trobriand Islands for the duration of the war 
because of fears that he harbored sympathies for the Germans. Sustained by 
a regular food drop, Malinowski spent some time pouting and counting the 
days.
But he also authored what many regard as the first modernist ethnography — 
or written description of a culture — Argonauts of the Western Pacific. This 
widely acclaimed work established a standard both for the performance of 
anthropological fieldwork and the writing of ethnographies. In this book and 
his subsequent teachings, Malinowski stressed that the anthropologist must 
be objective and scientific — in other words, somewhat etic.
Setting the standards of study
To achieve objectivity, Malinowski called for anthropologists to make direct 
and systematic observations of the people they studied. For example, rather 
than just recording what you happened to observe, you would go from one 
house to the next asking each person the same question and documenting 
the various responses.
The Golden Bough: Armchair anthropology
Perhaps the best known “armchair scholar” of 
early cultural anthropology was Englishman Sir 
James Frazer, who in 1890 published The Golden 
Bough, a work that encompassed much of what 
was known at the time about different cultures 
across the world, discussing various religions 
in terms of cultural (as opposed to theological) 
roots. Frazer hoped that he could uncover uni-
versal truths about human psychology through 
studies of human societies across the globe. He 
never undertook any of his own field research 
but relied on written reports and the stories and 
descriptions of others who had spent time over-
seas with different peoples.

211
 Chapter 12: From Kalahari to Minneapolis: How Cultural Anthropologists Work
Malinowski also recommended what he called a “natural period of time” for 
the observations, usually at least a calendar year so that the society’s activi-
ties during all seasons could be observed.
Focusing on how cultures function
Malinowski became associated with functionalism. Functionalism also holds 
that just about every aspect of a culture—from its ceremonies to its myths 
and religion— has an adaptive purpose and that somehow a society’s general 
behavior, laws, and customs help the culture to better survive in its environ-
ment. For an example of a functionalist interpretation of a dance in African 
society, see Chapter 11.
Setting the stage for structuralism
Following on the heels of Malinowski was Claude Levi-Strauss, a French 
anthropologist born in 1908 who was also significant in developing modern 
cultural anthropology (and no, he’s not the Levi Strauss of blue jeans fame). 
Levi-Strauss founded the school of thought called structuralism, which basi-
cally holds that human societies are structured by basic concepts that are 
expressed in every symbol, myth, ritual, and so on. These structures often 
amount to oppositions of general cultural concepts like raw-versus-cooked, 
hot-versus-cold, and male-versus-female. Furthermore, Levi-Strauss proposed 
that some “Universal Structures of the Mind” exist cross-culturally. (The jury 
is still out on that one.)
Unlike Malinowski, Levi-Strauss was far more theoretical than grounded in 
field observation, basing most of his theories on a year that he spent in the 
Brazilian Amazon.
Wading through jargon
Every scientific discipline uses its own termi-
nology to communicate complex and esoteric 
ideas within the discipline. To an outsider, a 
conversation between experts can be incom-
prehensible; even the subject of the conversa-
tion may be a complete mystery.
An unfortunate byproduct of early anthropology’s 
desire to be regarded as an objective science 
was that it began to use unnecessarily compli-
cated jargon and expressions. As anthropologist 
Edmond Leach wrote about Claude Levi-Strauss’s 
works, “The outstanding characteristic of his 
writing, whether in French or English, is that it is 
difficult to understand; his sociological theories 
combine baffling complexity with overwhelming 
erudition. Some readers even suspect that they 
are being treated to a confidence trick.”
Obviously, any conversation or writing between 
anthropologists will use terms and concepts 
specific to anthropology, but many anthropolo-
gists feel that they’re doing a greater service for 
society if their works are more accessible to the 
average reader.

212
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
A More Personal Approach: 
Emic Research
Although injecting a healthy dose of objectivity into their work helped 
anthropologists join the ranks of respected scientists, not everyone was sat-
isfied with the hands-off, etic approach to researching another culture (see 
the earlier section “Promoting objectivity: Etic research”). Many researchers 
in the field felt that the etic approach was too cold and distant and, therefore, 
couldn’t produce an intimate understanding of human cultures. The best way 
to understand a culture, some anthropologists suggested (if not insisted), 
was to walk a mile in the shoes of the people being studied (the subjects). 
From this idea came the concept of the participant–observer, who would use 
what anthropologists call the emic approach to research.
The participant–observer studies a particular people by living among them, 
working with them, and interacting with them in most aspects of their daily 
lives. By participating in the daily activities of the subject people this way, 
anthropologists learn a lot about the lives and social structures of human cul-
tures around the world firsthand.
But, of course, the question of objectivity arises again with this type of 
research. The anthropologist’s presence can alter the behaviors of the sub-
jects, and the researcher may simply have a tougher time recording informa-
tion without bias in this situation. I discuss the challenges of the emic approach 
to research in the following sections.
Recognizing how a researcher’s 
choices influence the results
Recently, anthropologists have generally accepted that any ethnography 
(written description of a culture) is really as much about the person writing it 
as it is about the culture being studied. For example, if you and a friend spent 
a week in France doing the same things at the same time with the same 
people, your account of your trip would differ from that of your friend. Sure, 
the descriptions of the places and people would be generally similar, but the 
two of you would each have perceived a person or place differently or con-
centrated on different facets of a particular experience.
Of course, in an ethnography you really have to get down to details; the 
descriptions of people, places, and events need to be much more in-depth 
than in a travel journal. So any anthropologist worth his salt will gather infor-
mation from multiple sources and not rely simply on a single observation.

213
 Chapter 12: From Kalahari to Minneapolis: How Cultural Anthropologists Work
 
But who the anthropologist chooses to observe and get information from 
impacts the outcome when he’s studying a complex society. No matter how 
objective he tries to be, he has to make choices about which informants 
(people within the culture who share information about it with the anthropol-
ogist) to use, and those choices determine the outcome of the research.
Consider the example of a traffic court in the United States. Many people fill 
the courtroom: defendants, lawyers, bailiffs, police officers, witnesses, and 
the jury. Each has a different view of the case. The defendant is probably ner-
vous, the bailiffs and police may be bored, the lawyers have a great stake in 
the outcome of the proceedings, and members of the jury (although all in 
the courtroom for the same reason) each have different impressions of the 
proceedings.
An outsider unfamiliar with how a U.S. court works — say, a New Guinea 
highlander studying American culture — may choose the defendant as the 
informant and get the defendant’s perspective, which may be very different 
than that of one of the jurors. And if the New Guinea highlander enters the 
courtroom to study the proceedings in full ceremonial dress, you can imagine 
that the behavior of the whole courtroom will change; people may become 
more cordial than normal, for example, so as to give a good impression.
The same idea applies to picking informants in cultural anthropology. Just 
one person, carelessly chosen, won’t do. Anthropologists need to learn from 
lots of people from across the spectrum of the culture — and understand 
that their choices will determine how the research unfolds.
Realizing that the act of observing 
affects the results
We also have to consider what effect the act of observing has on the people 
being observed. Some observations in science are passive, meaning that they 
have no impact on the subject being observed; photographing the planet 
Mars, for example, doesn’t affect its geology or its atmosphere. But in anthro-
pology, the participant–observer lives among the people she’s studying, and 
her mere presence changes the behavior of the members of the culture in 
question, at least initially.
 
Individuals and even groups change their behavior when being observed by 
an outsider, even if they’re unaware of it. For example, subjects may become 
self-conscious and avoid the anthropologist or hide ceremonies or rituals they 
don’t want the anthropologist to see. They may also change their normal 
clothing, work, recreation, and dietary habits in an attempt to show the 
anthropologist what they think she wants to see.

214
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
The only real cures for the disruptive presence of the anthropologist are the 
passage of time and establishing a rapport. To observe the most natural 
behaviors of a culture, you have to wait until they become comfortable with 
your presence. This adjustment period is one reason why short field pro-
grams just don’t work; settling into a routine can take months. The anthropol-
ogist has to become part of the background as the subjects settle into their 
normal routine, which is what anthropologists want to observe.
Cultural critique, Margaret Mead, and 
the importance of good writing
Many modern anthropologists believe that the 
real promise of cultural anthropology is to serve 
as a critique of current society and suggest 
ways people can improve their own lives. To do 
this, an anthropologist departs Western society 
and lives among a non-Western society for 
some extended period of time. On returning to 
the West, the anthropologist is accustomed to 
seeing the world in the way of the people he 
has just been living with, and is in a position to 
look at his own society from a new perspective. 
The anthropologist can point out aspects of his 
society that others living in it take for granted.
In the mid-1900s, it became somewhat popular 
for cultural anthropologists to write two differ-
ent reports or paired works about the culture 
they had studied: a traditional academic study, 
and a more free-flowing, descriptive text writ-
ten almost like a novel. The rationale was that 
although the academic text was necessary, 
only a deeply personal account of the time 
spent among the host society could completely 
convey the fullness of the experience.
Some good examples of paired works are David 
Mayberry-Lewis’s Akwe-Shavante Society and 
Savage and the Innocent, Paul Rabinow’s 
Symbolic Domination and Reflections of 
Fieldwork in Morocco, and Napoleon Chagnon’s 
Studying the Yanomamo and Yanomamo: The 
Fierce People.
In the early 20th century, American anthropolo-
gist Margaret Mead picked up on this tradition 
of writing for the general public by drawing par-
allels and contrasts between the societies she 
studied and her own. In one of her better-known 
works, Coming of Age in Samoa, Meade offered 
a detailed explanation of how boys and girls in 
traditional Samoan society transition from child-
hood into adulthood and ultimately choose their 
spouses. She also compared and contrasted 
how children make this transition in Samoan 
and American societies. By doing this, she 
helped make anthropology more relevant to the 
average American.
Mead wrote Coming of Age in Samoa in simple 
and engaging terms for a wide audience. This 
doesn’t mean that she wasn’t as serious about 
anthropology as other scholars; a generation of 
anthropologists emulated her methods of both 
careful observation and notetaking. But by 
relating her understanding of a different culture 
to the American public at large (and not simply 
other academics), Mead captured the interest 
of many Americans and other Westerners who 
otherwise wouldn’t have known or cared any-
thing about Samoan society (or anthropology in 
general).

215
 Chapter 12: From Kalahari to Minneapolis: How Cultural Anthropologists Work
Considering Recent Developments
Although many of the research methods still used by cultural anthropolo-
gists emerged in the early 20th century, the science certainly hasn’t stood 
still since then. In the following sections, I discuss how postmodern theory 
and increased cultural interaction have influenced anthropology.
Chewing on postmodernism
In the late 1980s, anthropology’s postmodern movement sought to find a 
better way of conducting fieldwork and writing up the results. This move-
ment almost completely rejected the etic approach and essentially said that 
because all knowledge is socially constructed — because all people are a 
product of their own, ethnocentric culture — nothing is really “real.” For the 
postmodernists, everything anthropology had ever learned was just a reflec-
tion of the times, a social construction. For example, early anthropologists 
“discovered” several main races of humanity because they were looking for 
those race designations to justify 19th-century political activities such as 
colonialism. Colonial domination sure sounds a lot nobler if you frame it in 
the context of civilizing the supposedly savage native races.
Postmodernism was founded on the writings of several 20th century French 
philosophers, notably social critic Michel Foucault and deconstructionist 
Jacques Derrida. Although some anthropologists continue to explore these 
philosophies in hopes of establishing a new framework for anthropology, 
most continue to conduct traditional, modernist fieldwork. Basically, post-
modernism has turned out to be just too wide a swing of the pendulum away 
from the etic approach; it’s hyper-emic — it’s too much. Clearly, anthropolog-
ical questions could be strongly conditioned by the times — and anthropolo-
gists do have to be careful about that — but anthropologists can recognize 
and adjust for that tendency and still actually learn something about the 
world.
Keeping pace with cultural change
The world is rapidly changing and growing smaller as communications and 
ease of transport bring more people closer together every day. As this inter-
action happens, cultures change one another; in fact, today many cultures 
studied by early anthropologists have vanished, diluted by the globalization 
of Western civilization. (You can read more about cultural change in Chapter 
11.) The days of first contact, when a Western anthropologist encountered a 
society that had never even heard of Western society, are most likely over.

216
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
Today, wary of grand, sweeping explanations of human behavior that haven’t 
worked out so well in the past, many anthropologists focus their investiga-
tions on specific facets of culture, such as dance, food preparation, mythol-
ogy, and so on. Ethnography today uses both etic and emic approaches, 
often to test a particular theory or hypothesis through collection of observ-
able data. At the same time, many have recognized that being completely 
objective is impossible, so many years of schooling prepare the fieldworker 
not to be overly ethnocentric.
Striving for Accuracy
With all the challenges involved in observing natural behaviors and getting 
an accurate idea of a people’s culture, how can cultural anthropologists be 
sure they’re getting any accurate information at all?
Well, they start by asking good questions. Then they learn as much as 
humanly possible about the culture in question, including the native lan-
guage, before going into the field. Being aware of the problems that may 
come up — perhaps learned from prior anthropologists — is a good start. 
And being a great observer is one of the cultural anthropologist’s greatest 
assets.
Although I can’t give you an A to Z education on how to become a cultural 
anthropologist, I can at least introduce you to some common issues these 
scientists face and ways to address them. That’s what the following sections 
are all about.
Recognizing potential research pitfalls
No matter how well trained anthropologists may be in observation or how 
long they’ve spent with a particular people, certain variables can impede or 
complicate the relationships between anthropologists and the people they’re 
studying. Some of the major variables that every anthropologist must con-
tend with are discussed in the following sections.
Individual versus group dynamics
Answers to sensitive questions can change depending on whether the anthro-
pologist is talking to an individual or a group. Personal or political dynamics 
between members of the same society when they’re speaking with a stranger 
(the anthropologist) can affect their answers, especially if the questions are 
sensitive. For example, a young Samoan male may claim to have had more 

217
 Chapter 12: From Kalahari to Minneapolis: How Cultural Anthropologists Work
sexual relationships than he has in order to impress peers. In Arabic culture, 
exaggerations and distortions of the truth are common when speaking pri-
vately and less likely in public, so group size can make a big difference when 
it comes to the accuracy of answers. In general, people in groups may tend to 
seek a consensus from the others instead of answering truthfully.
Truth versus lies
Anthropologists can be lied to just as easily as anyone else. The subjects 
aren’t necessarily being malicious — informants may simply enjoy the 
anthropologist’s company and attention or the special status they receive in 
dealing with the foreigner. For these and other reasons, informants may just 
tell the anthropologist what they think she wants to hear in hopes of staying 
in her favor. That’s why crosschecking information through other informants 
and with direct observation is important.
Time and space
Variables of time and space may be the hardest to reconcile. Cultures may 
have distinct variation in group behavior over geographical space. For exam-
ple, an anthropologist studying the culture of Oregon would have to consider 
the major political and economic differences between residents of urban, 
wealthy, mostly liberal Portland, and residents of rural, less wealthy, mostly 
conservative Pendleton — and that’s no small task. So it’s very important for 
the anthropologist to document exactly where he conducted a particular 
study.
The same goes for time; every culture on Earth changes with the passage of 
time. (Check out Chapter 11 for more on cultural change.) The Trobriand 
Islands today aren’t what they were in Malinowski’s time, and undoubtedly 
many elements of that society have changed a lot. In the same way, many 
American restaurants are now found almost worldwide. Some of the most sig-
nificant changes in non-Western societies occur as their contact with and 
assimilation (cultural absorption) into Western societies increases. With the 
spread of rapid communication and transport, contact with the West is 
becoming almost unavoidable. Unfortunately, some parts of the world have 
seen the disappearance of entire non-Western cultures. (You can read more 
about the problem of disappearing traditional languages in Chapter 18.)
Motivations (self and informant)
Lastly, the motivations of the anthropologist and his informants have to be 
considered. The anthropologist is presumably confident of his objectivity 
and research design, but it’s easy to fall victim to confirmation bias, the phe-
nomenon by which everything observed conveniently confirms what you 
already believe. Cultural anthropologists have to be very aware of them-
selves and what they’re thinking because they’re as subject to the influence 
of preconceived notions as anyone else.

218
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
The motivations of cultural informants also have to be considered. Traditionally, 
informants were paid for answering questions, but of course this doesn’t 
ensure correct or honest answers and turns the anthropologist-informant 
relationship in a businesslike rather than friendly direction. A more emic 
approach helps the anthropologist get closer to the informant by participat-
ing in the events and activities of the subject people’s daily lives, and per-
haps paying for information in ways other than simple cash exchange. 
Malinowski paid his informants in tobacco, but he noted that they only 
seemed to be interested in answering his questions when they wanted 
a fresh tobacco supply.
Watching cultural anthropology in action
Anthropologists do fascinating work that helps them better understand 
humanity despite all the difficulties I outline in this chapter. Of course, 
nobody’s perfect, and mistakes happen, but anthropologists do their 
best to understand humanity in spite of these setbacks.
Today, anthropologists often do their best to work in the interest of the cul-
tural groups they’re studying because so many traditional cultures are on the 
verge of complete assimilation into Western civilization. This work occurs in 
a variety of contexts worldwide. The following sections show two examples 
of cultural anthropology success stories.
The Kalahari
One well-known anthropologist who has worked among a society very dis-
tinct from Western civilization is Richard Lee, who is famous for his work 
among the !Kung of the Kalahari desert. (Once known as “Bushmen,” the 
!Kung, today, are also known as the Nyae Nyae or the Jo-hoansi, pronounced 
zhu-wahnsi.) The ! symbol in the !Kung language is a click sound made with 
the tongue.
Having spent many seasons with these foragers of South Africa, Lee has writ-
ten extensively on every aspect of !Kung life: geography, subsistence, kinship, 
politics, conflict resolution, mythology, material culture, and on and on. 
These outward observations have led him to an intimate understanding of 
their religion, worldview, and perceptions of social change.
One of Lee’s surprising findings was that, contrary to common belief, the 
!Kung had to work hard to prevent anyone from trying to get too much power 
in the small band. For a long time, anthropologists thought that the human 
species was inherently egalitarian, meaning that all people would have equal 
status and access to resources. But when Lee tried, one evening in the late 
1960s, to give the !Kung a fat cow as a present, they shunned the gift and 

219
 Chapter 12: From Kalahari to Minneapolis: How Cultural Anthropologists Work
asked him to get the flea-bitten bag of bones out of their camp. After much 
pleading, Lee finally persuaded the !Kung to accept the gift. Lee had discov-
ered that although the !Kung were basically egalitarian, they had to work at 
it; they had social mechanisms, in this case ridicule, to prevent anyone in the 
group from trying to become, essentially, a big shot. This was a fascinating 
discovery for anthropology.
Minneapolis
Cultural anthropology isn’t limited to non-Western culture. Anthropologists 
have found that American culture can serve as a mirror for humankind. Take, 
for example, James Spradley and Brenda Mann’s study of the subculture of 
cocktail waitressing in the mid-1970s.
Using the same methods of observation as they would have if they’d been 
studying a non-Western society, Mann and Spradley selected a subject area 
(a bar). Mann adopted an emic, participant–observer approach and actually 
began to work as a cocktail waitress, while Spradley observed etically. Among 
their observations were how this subculture classified its members:
 
 Employees: Lowly ranked in relation to the highly ranked bartenders
 
 Customers: Classified either as regulars (the highest rank), people off the 
street, or female (the lowest rank)
 
 Managers: Bar owners, who were often also bartenders
Mann and Spradley recorded their observations and published the results 
as an ethnography covering traditional ethnographic topics such as social 
structure, division of labor, and concepts of territory among the cocktail bar 
scene. The book, though unconventional at the time, provided a good illus-
tration of the social dynamics between the sexes in a common American 
institution (the cocktail bar) and shed some light on gender relations in con-
temporary American society.
Going into the Field: Getting Prepared 
for Less-Than-Ideal Conditions
The far-flung and exotic corners of the world are no longer the only accept-
able places to conduct anthropological studies. Especially since the dawn of 
the postmodern era (see the “Chewing on postmodernism” section earlier in 
this chapter), anthropologists have showed up just about everywhere. What 
identifies them as anthropologists is that regardless of their subject and any 
theory they may be testing, they’re going into the field (whether it’s the 

220
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
Kalahari or Minneapolis) to make observations about people in that field, and 
they draw conclusions about some facet of the human experience based on 
those observations.
Still, many anthropologists do voyage to places far off the beaten path, and 
they have to be ready for a variety of circumstances before going out to do 
their fieldwork. This isn’t just travel advice — many cultural anthropological 
projects have gone wrong because researchers have arrived in the study area 
completely unprepared for the conditions.
In the heyday of modernist cultural anthropology, nobody aspiring to a 
career as an anthropologist dared to think that they could get away without 
doing fieldwork in some extremely inhospitable part of the world. Fieldwork 
was considered an important rite of passage in the field of anthropology, and 
if the professors had suffered months of tribulations in steaming jungles, arid 
highlands, or other difficult conditions, so would the graduate students.
Even today — much as in the time of Malinowski — many areas in the devel-
oping world are still hard to reach and have very limited facilities of the kind 
that Westerners often take for granted. In many cases, luxuries such as tele-
phones, toilets, and showers — and even necessities such as drinking water — 
can range from hard-to-find to nonexistent. Anthropologists who choose to 
work in these conditions have to be prepared for long periods spent away 
from the comforts of home.
Ready access to medical treatment is often limited if it’s available at all, and 
disease can be common, so some provision must be made for medical evacu-
ation. (Global communications systems such as satellite telephones make 
this escape much more likely than even five years ago.) Specialists in infec-
tious diseases should be contacted before setting out because in the world of 
tropical diseases an ounce of prevention really is worth a pound of cure.
Communications must also be considered. How will the anthropologist stay 
in touch with the folks back home? Mail service may be unreliable, and 
although Internet access is increasingly available in more places around the 
world, it’s still not a given.

A
ll animals communicate using a variety of methods to exchange infor-
mation. Strictly speaking, anything that one entity does that conveys 
a message to some other entity is communication. Bees signal the location 
of resources by dancing in their hives, gorillas stick out their tongues, grunt, 
and beat their chests to intimidate intruders, whales call to one another 
across vast distances, and humans talk . . . and talk, and talk. All around the 
world, information moves from one living thing to another every second of 
every day.
Of all these communication methods, human communication — typified 
by speaking — is unique in many ways. Human language is especially fast, 
accurate, and subtle, and can address many listeners at a time (billions with 
global communications). Infants acquire language piece by piece in basically 
the same way worldwide, regardless of the culture they’re born into. In the 
human linguistic system of communication, a single word can be used to 
mean many things or to increase the power of a statement.
Of all the kinds of animal communication, human language has the greatest 
potential for creating innovations. Human sounds assembled into words, 
phrases, and sentences don’t have one stand-alone meaning; they can be 
combined with other words to build unique new messages. Our language is 
ever evolving and has essentially infinite potential for creating and communi-
cating new meaning.

222
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
Because human language is a unique characteristic of our species, here’s a 
full chapter about it. In it I discuss what language is, how it differs so much 
from the communication methods of other non-human animals, how it’s 
used and learned, and how anthropology approaches this fascinating facet of 
being human.
Exploring the Complexity 
of Human Language
Human language, strictly speaking, is a system of communication using 
defined units combined in a systematic way. That is, any culture’s spoken 
language is a set of sounds assembled according to a set of rules so that 
all who understand the rules and can hear the assemblages of sounds can 
understand what’s being said.
Messages are created in the mind of one person, converted to sounds 
assembled in a comprehensible order, spoken, heard, and then interpreted 
by other people. Each stage involves the potential for miscommunication and 
misinterpretation; in some ways, the fact that human language works at all is 
amazing! Here I’m largely talking about human speech, but keep in mind that 
this topic includes body language, symbolic postures, tone and volume of 
voice, and other facets of human language.
 
Speech refers to the use of certain anatomy to make the sounds used in human 
vocal communication, whereas language can refer to that speech as well 
as to body language (gesture) and writing. In this chapter I’m mainly using 
“language” to refer to human vocal communication. The important thing to 
remember is that “speech” is about anatomy whereas “language” is about cog-
nitive rules.
In this section, I provide some context that sheds light on the phenomenally 
complex and subtle form of animal communication that is human language. 
I begin by explaining how non-human animals communicate and the impor-
tance of symbolism before showing the main characteristics of our amazing 
language and how it helps to shape the human mind.
Screeching and howling: Non-human 
animal communications
To get a true picture of what makes human communication unique, you need 
to understand how other animals communicate.

223
 Chapter 13: Can We Talk? Communication, Symbols, and Language
 
Humans are animals. It’s easy to fall into the old human habit of drawing a line 
between our species and all others, but to be accurate we need to refer not 
just to “animals” but “non-human animals.”
Chemical
Pheromones are chemicals emitted by an animal to communicate with others, 
and they’re the most important communications in the non-human animal 
world. They include chemical trails, which are used by ants, for example, 
to indicate the direction to a food source and can also be blocked by other 
pheremones to indicate a dead-end trail. Sex pheremones indicate readiness 
for mating. The systematic study of pheremones is only a few decades old 
and still holds plenty of mysteries to be solved; for example, why is it that 
female Asian elephants emit the same sex pheromone as more than 100 spe-
cies of moth? Finally, many animals also use scent to mark their territories.
Visual
Visual communication occurs among animals with eyes or other light-sensing 
organs. It involves many variables, including the nature of the light source, 
the background against which the body of the signaler is set (for example, an 
off-white polar bear against a white, snowy background), the signaler’s intent, 
and the receiver’s interpretation of the signal.
Visual communications relay messages about aggression, sexual receptivity, 
or territoriality. They can be combined with audio signals, although gener-
ally speaking, visual signals are used across shorter distances than audio 
signals and some chemical signals. They’re particularly important among the 
primates, in which facial expressions, gestures, and bodily postures are very 
important. (See Chapter 4 for more on primate behavior.)
Gesture
Gesture, or visible physical action used in com-
munications (also known as body language), 
is an important part of human language. 
Many researchers have suggested that bodily 
“speech” using mimes and bodily postures was 
the precursor to vocal speech. Recently, psy-
chologist Merlin Donald has gone so far as to 
say that mimes and gestures certainly evolved 
first, and that speech, though important, evolved 
simply as a subset of gesture — a more efficient 
way to communicate but nothing more than an 
elaboration on gesture.
Whatever the case, humans still use gesture 
in their communication today. Gestures can 
increase the specificity of a description, “hold” 
a concept in mind as you search for just the right 
words to describe it, and increase the accuracy 
of instructions you’re giving. Of course, you can 
also use them to add emphasis or to spice up 
communication with comedy, insult, irony — 
the possibilities are limitless.

224
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
Audio
Audible communications include a wide array of sounds — mostly vocaliza-
tions, in which the lungs move air through the mouth or beak to produce sound 
(as in dogs and birds, respectively). Audible communications also include 
the rattlesnake’s rattle, whale-song, insect sounds made by rubbing the wings 
and legs, and many others. Audio communications are effective over longer 
distances than visual signals — African elephants can identify other indi-
vidual elephants up to more than a mile away based on vocalizations — and 
are common in environments that impair clear fields of vision, such as heavy 
jungle foliage.
Among audio communications, of course, is humanity’s spoken language. It 
can also be combined with visual cues such as body language. But aside from 
falling under the same broad category as barking and insect sounds, our lan-
guage has fairly little in common with non-human animal communications. 
The following section begins to explain why.
Contrasting non-human 
and human symbolism
Understanding just how different human and non-human symbols are is criti-
cal to understanding humanity. A symbol is something that represents some-
thing else. Many non-human animals have some kind of symboling system, 
but most are very simple compared to human symbols.
A red stop sign, for instance, displays the word STOP, but even without the 
word, you’d slow down if you saw the red octagon. You know that in this con-
text the color red and the octagonal shape means you have to stop. Now, the 
octagonal shape and the color red have nothing to do with stopping or going. 
Red may indicate danger, but the octagonal shape is completely random. And 
yet you know immediately the message the sign is conveying because cultur-
ally, that sign represents the idea that you must stop your vehicle.
Symbols, then, are (or can be) entirely arbitrary. They refer the mind to 
something other than what they are. Other examples just use words: The let-
ters C-A-T convey “cat” to English-speakers, but they don’t have any cat-like 
qualities; they’re also completely arbitrary, and in fact its constituents, the 
letters c, a, and t, can be rearranged to have a completely different meaning, 
for example, as A-C-T. Again, neither “cat” nor “act” has anything to do with 
the things it represents or symbolizes. 
So, what’s the significance that symbols are arbitrary? Well, that depends on 
just how arbitrary they are. In the case of shallow symbols, it’s important to 
the life of the animal, but not as important as when the symbol is deep. The 
following sections describe these kinds of symbolism in more detail.

225
 Chapter 13: Can We Talk? Communication, Symbols, and Language
Shallow (non-human) symbolism
Many animals use audio signals to indicate danger, for example, or safety 
from danger, or to call their fellows (scientifically called conspecifics) over to 
a food source.
Compared to human symbols, which I describe in the next section, these 
symbols are relatively shallow; a monkey’s aerial predator alarm screech, for 
example, is only used to mean aerial predator. It doesn’t indicate, for exam-
ple, “aerial-predator-like” qualities in some other monkey. I call it a shallow 
symbol because it lacks depth or even potential depth. The concept is closed 
rather than open. The fact that these symbols are shallow has several impor-
tant ramifications:
 
 Messages are typically short in duration.
 
 Messages are relatively simple.
 
 Messages are essentially literal, with no multiple meanings.
 
 Messages are rigid and offer little symbolic innovation.
The shallow symbols used by many animals are very effective for them; they 
work well for the kind of lives that those animals lead. But human symbols 
are fundamentally different, and it’s important to see how.
Deep (human) symbolism
Deep symbols can mean many different things (rather than the single mean-
ing attached to shallow symbols). What do you think of when you read the 
words “to be, or not to be” or even the single word “revolution”? These 
words can mean different things to different people, so depending on what 
you’ve read, how you reacted to it, your own personal history and knowl-
edge, and so on, your reaction to the phrase will probably differ from that of 
many other people. This makes metaphor and deep symbolism a key part of 
one of humanity’s most important characteristics: individuality, or the fact 
that humans aren’t interchangeable automatons but rather individual beings 
with unique identities. You can read more about this fascinating characteris-
tic of our species in Chapter 15.
The power of deep symbols lies in their ability to trigger so many other ideas. 
The human capacity for limitless metaphor allows for infinite variation of 
ideas in the human mind. Humans often rely on figures of speech rather than 
more literal explanations to get their points across. You may say “That’s the 
way the cookie crumbles,” resigning yourself to some fate you can’t control, 
and your friends know just what you mean without thinking you’re talking 
about an actual cookie.

226
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
Don’t get your figures of speech mixed up. A simile uses the words like or 
as to compare things: “Writing this book is like herding cats.” A metaphor 
is a comparison in which you claim one thing is another (“all the world’s a 
stage”) or has characteristics of another (“the walls have ears”).
The characteristics of the objects compared in a metaphor can be pretty 
vaguely similar, and if they’re not similar enough, the metaphor can fail. But 
most humans are very good at using metaphors to more accurately convey 
a message. The title of Ursula K. Le Guin’s 1998 book on writing, Steering 
the Craft, nicely conveys what she means to teach you: how to guide the art 
(craft) of writing as though you were steering a water vessel (craft).
 
I can’t overemphasize the significance of metaphor as a communication tool. 
One of the most fascinating aspects of metaphors is that they’re not made 
more effective by restricting what they mean; you don’t reduce them down but 
rather open them up. You blur the edges of a concept until it becomes a meta-
phor. For example, I could say “I’m on thin ice” if I’m in a dangerous situation, 
but I don’t really have to be on ice; I could be facing a difficult exam (well, not 
anymore, thankfully) or something else ominous. The meaning of “thin ice” 
has blurred such that it can convey the essence of something else; ice is no 
longer just an insubstantial layer of frozen water. The symbol system is open.
The origins of ritual and religion?
The use of metaphor and deep symbols does 
so much to promote individuality that the late 
anthropologist Roy Rappaport believed that ritual 
and religion were essentially invented in order to 
reduce the potential for disorder (that is, nonuni-
formity) that human language presents.
Rappaport wrote that ritual and religion estab-
lish rigidity, not fluidity, of thought. They use 
sharp definitions of things, rather than blurry, 
to channel thought in a particular direction, 
and those definitions (because of their sacred-
ness) aren’t allowed to be questioned, further 
dampening individual thought. They use cer-
emonies, where people are expected to be 
quiet, to remind people of their unity and shared 
concepts (called Ultimate Sacred Postulates) 
rather than promoting the individual, “messy” 
thinking that’s almost inevitable when people 
converse freely.
Keep in mind that Rappaport wasn’t trying to 
bash religion. He was presenting an anthro-
pological explanation for its roots, connected, 
in his way of thinking, to the evolution of 
language.

227
 Chapter 13: Can We Talk? Communication, Symbols, and Language
Identifying characteristics 
of human spoken language
This chapter is largely about spoken language because speech undoubtedly 
evolved before written language and because even today many people don’t 
write or read but do speak and comprehend spoken language. Writing, which 
you can read about in Chapter 10, is typically associated with the social orga-
nization called civilization, and first appears around 6,000 years ago.
The following are the characteristics that make human spoken language 
distinct:
 
 Only our anatomy will do. Spoken human language requires the coor-
dination of many anatomical structures to succeed: The lungs force air 
through the larynx and then through the mouth and nose, the tongue 
presses on the roof of the mouth, the vocal cords vibrate, and the lips 
shape carefully depending on the desired sound. Figure 13-1 shows 
some of this anatomy.

Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
 
 Although chimpanzees and gorillas possess some anatomical similarities 
to humans that allow them to make some human-like sounds, they don’t 
make all our sounds.
 
 It follows complex rules (otherwise known as grammar). Even more 
important to human language than making complex sounds is the cogni-
tive ability to use complex rules — grammar — to assemble and decode 
messages. (After all, people who can’t talk or hear spoken language 
can convey complex thoughts with sign language.) This capacity is far 
beyond that of even the brightest non-human primates who have been 
taught various forms of sign language in laboratory settings. The same 
goes for parrots; they mimic human sounds and may use some very 
simple rules, but they don’t use complex syntax or grammar to assemble 
unique new phrases.
 
 It’s learned, not genetic. The capacity to learn language seems to be 
hard-wired, or instinctual, in humans; any infant placed in a cultural set-
ting quickly observes people using language and begins to learn it. (You 
can read more about language acquisition later in this chapter.) But the 
actual information the infant has about language is all learned, not trans-
mitted genetically as instinct.
 
 You can think of the physical brain as hardware and language as soft-
ware, but don’t take the brain-hardware/language-software analogy too 
far. The mind and language are far more complex than any machines or 
computer programs ever devised.
 
 It’s voluntary, not automatic. Although you may yelp (or curse) if 
startled, you’re often able to stifle such impulses — many other animals 
can’t. And you can choose to begin assembling complex statements at 
any time (even though you may self-censor, for whatever reason); this 
voluntary self-activation is pretty uniquely human.
 
 Abstraction is allowed. Because of its symbolic nature, human language 
allows you to speak about things that aren’t necessarily present at the 
moment. For example, you can talk about past, future, and even hypo-
thetical events without any time constraints. This practice is called 
displacement, and it’s important because it allows a degree of abstract 
thought (that is, may be versus actually is).
 
 It allows for invention. As I explain in the earlier section “Non-human 
and human symbolism,” other animal communication systems are 
largely closed in that one signal (for example, a squawk) can only mean 
one thing. But one signal in human language (such as the word pool) can 
mean many things. In this way, human language is an open system that 
allows the invention of new words, new meanings, and new combina-
tions of words.

229
 Chapter 13: Can We Talk? Communication, Symbols, and Language
Linking language to the mind: 
Tapping its true power
The real power of human language isn’t just that you can make new mean-
ings by rearranging words and sounds; the power and potential lie in what 
happens with those meanings in the mind and in the ability to think in the 
abstract.
Nobody knows just why, but human memory allows for one idea to trigger 
another rather easily; that is, when you hear the word major you may imme-
diately think of a military officer or an academic focus during college. This is 
deep symbolism.
Even the most well-trained chimpanzees and gorillas, on the other hand, 
largely use their shallow symbolism to communicate about the present, or 
the very near future or past; their lives are a series of things that happen 
to them, whereas human experience and language promote complexity of 
thought and contemplation. This is the real power of language, the key to 
how it makes our minds different from any others.
 
Exactly what constitutes the mind is hard to say. For the moment, think of the 
mind as the activity of the brain (which, in this context, is strictly an anatomi-
cal structure).
Mark Twain on “The Awful German Language”
Understanding what someone is saying can be 
humorous, but so can not understanding it. In 
1880, American writer Mark Twain published his 
travel classic A Tramp Abroad and in Appendix 
D wrote the following about his frustration with 
German grammar:
“Surely there is not another language that is so 
slipshod and systemless, and so slippery and 
elusive to the grasp. One is washed about in it, 
hither and thither, in the most helpless way; and 
when at last he thinks he has captured a rule 
which offers firm ground to take a rest on amid 
the general rage and turmoil of the ten parts 
of speech, he turns over the page and reads, 
‘Let the pupil make careful note of the follow-
ing exceptions.’ He runs his eye down and 
finds that there are more exceptions to the rule 
than instances of it. . . . German books are easy 
enough to read when you hold them before the 
looking-glass or stand on your head — so as to 
reverse the construction — but I think that to 
learn to read and understand a German news-
paper is a thing which must always remain an 
impossibility to a foreigner.”

230
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
Humans use language in some unique ways. We comprehend it very quickly — 
up to 15 sounds per second (whereas other sounds of that frequency tend to 
blur into an indistinguishable hum). We speak entirely on the fly, making up 
new phrases and sentences from one moment to the next rather than using a 
detailed script; in fact, we continually make new idea-associations as informa-
tion comes to us. Finally, we rarely make major, repeated structural errors, 
such as saying “I am getting in my banana and leaving!” rather than “I am get-
ting in my car and leaving!” Even under great stress, such errors are very rare 
in healthy individuals.
Ready to Swear: How the Human Mind 
Is Hard-Wired for Language
Anthropological studies have shown that infants aren’t born with an “on-
board” vocabulary but with the capacity to learn any language; in other 
Stuff you’ve long forgotten: Syntax and grammar
We all learned them, and we all use them, but 
few of us have thought much about them since 
high school. I’m talking about syntax and gram-
mar, and I’m here to remind you what these two 
words mean.
Syntax is the rule system pertaining to the 
word order of a sentence. For example, in most 
human languages, sentences are composed of 
a subject, verb, and object (and in many cases, 
in that order). In English, the syntactical rule 
is that the subject is first in the sentence, the 
verb next, and the object last, such that the sen-
tence “The dog bit the man” has a very different 
meaning than “The man bit the dog.” The words 
are the same in both sentences, but you must 
follow the specific word order rules of English 
to communicate the information accurately.
Grammar is a language’s rulebook; it’s a system 
of ideas that tell how a language is and isn’t to 
be expressed. Each language has a grammar, 
but not all grammars are the same. For example, 
French has rules about the genders of nouns. 
In French, you would say le mur (“the wall”) 
rather than just mur; “le” indicates the gender 
of “mur,” and the sentence would be incorrect 
with another gender article or none at all.
Although grammars differ, all grammars inform 
the proper use of the following language ele-
ments:
  The use of nouns (people, places, things, or 
ideas)
  The use of verbs (descriptions of action or 
states of being)
  The case of nouns (either as subject or 
object of a sentence)
  The use of modifiers (like the -s suffix in 
English to indicate plural)
  The use of gender (using masculine, neuter, 
or feminine nouns)
  The use of tense (past, present, and future)

 Chapter 13: Can We Talk? Communication, Symbols, and Language
words, any healthy infant can acquire any language. This shows that human 
language isn’t transmitted genetically — you don’t inherit it from your 
parents — although the ability to learn human language is. This tendency 
is informally referred to as being hard-wired for language. Humans are, and 
it’s very important.
One reason (the use of) language is so important for people is that humans 
rely on their culture to survive. Culture refers to the whole set of instructions 
about how the world works and how to function and survive in it. Now, all 
those instructions — from how to greet a rival chief to how to make a fire in 
the rain to where to fish when the river has been high for a week — aren’t 
genetically transmitted; they don’t ride on the genes any more than language 
does. So one generation has to transmit them to the next, and the mechanism 
of that transmission is language. Humans use language to move critical sur-
vival information from one generation to the next, so getting that information 
right is important. In this way, human biological survival was promoted by a 
cultural phenomenon: This biocultural interaction is a good example of how 
human evolution has been particularly complex and fascinating.
What’s most surprising about human language acquisition is that we don’t 
really learn it through discrete teaching; parents rarely actually describe the 
intricate rules of their language to their offspring. In fact, most people don’t 
even know all of the specific rules of their language; they just know what 
“sounds right.”
So if humans don’t pick up language through enlightening discussions about 
grammar and syntax, how is it that people are talking at all? The learning pro-
cess starts almost immediately — infants accumulate language in a discrete 
series of stages that don’t vary culturally. These stages are universal (which 
also argues strongly for the concept of humans being hard-wired for language 
acquisition at birth). Generally speaking, kids first learn phonemes (sounds), 
then basic morphemes (words), syntax (word order in a phrase or sentence), 
grammar (complex rules of language construction), and finally they expand 
their vocabulary of words. Fully adult speech isn’t really achieved until ten 
or so years of age. Before then, all children acquire language through some 
universal stages, which I describe in the following section.
First four months
In the first four months of life, children work out the basic sounds of a lan-
guage: the phonemes.
A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound that differentiates meaning in a 
word; for example, the sound denoted by the letter v as opposed to the 
sound denoted by the letter t. Phonemes aren’t normally words in themselves 
(like “I” or “a”), but you combine them to make words.

232
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
 
Technically speaking, phonemes aren’t necessarily syllables, but in terms of 
speech comprehension, most people hear them as syllables. You can pretty 
safely think of them as syllables, but know that this isn’t a hard-and-fast rule.
Worldwide, the first phonemes learned seem to be the sounds p, m, and a. 
These basic sounds require little motor skill to make (as opposed, for exam-
ple, to ing as in “ending”). After four months or so, the number of phonemes 
that kids learn drops radically. Although children can learn many languages 
after this time, learning correct pronunciation in each of those languages will 
be more difficult than if they learned multiple phonemes early on.
Six to twelve months
In this period of babbling, kids attach phonemes to make simple words like 
“dada” or “mama.” The child learns subconsciously that combining insignifi-
cant single sounds can create meaning, at this stage perhaps only apparent 
to the child as a reaction to the word by the parent. Experiments have shown 
that after a few minutes of exposure to a new two-phoneme word, many chil-
dren learn that word and file it away in their memories.
12 to 18 months
By one year of age, children can assemble basic speech, having learned the 
basic phonemes and how to produce them anatomically. They’re also able to 
build basic, two-word phrases from the words they’ve learned, such as “get 
cat” or “more milk.” One set of words, called pivots, are used repeatedly as 
actions on which other words, called open words are hinged. For example, 
“get” is a pivot, and “cat” is open. “Get” can be used as action for any number 
of open words. Building these basic sentences requires a basic understand-
ing of syntax (“get cat” is different from “cat get”). Children use short sen-
tences for a number of reasons:
 
 To locate and/or name something: “see mama”
 
 To demand or indicate desire: “want candy”
 
 To negate: “no stairs”
 
 To describe or qualify: “big bird”
 
 To indicate possession: “daddy car”
 
 To question: “where ball”

233
 Chapter 13: Can We Talk? Communication, Symbols, and Language
18 to 24 months
Before 24 months, most children have learned to use the words “what,” “who,” 
and “where” to form questions. These words begin to expand meaning out 
of the near or recent, into more abstract concepts of distance in time and 
space.
36 months and later
By three years, most children are speaking complex sentences that incorpo-
rate phonemes and rules indicating tenses such as present, past, plural, and 
possessive. After about three years or so, an accent develops, vocabulary 
increases greatly, and the dreaded word “why” makes its debut. Life sud-
denly gets very complicated.
Watching Human Language Evolve
How did all this happen? How did humans come to possess the ability to 
learn such a complex system of communication? Certainly, the explanation 
has roots in evolution because evolutionary forces have shaped humanity. 
But just saying “language evolved as some form of communication” doesn’t 
tell anthropologists everything they want to know. For example:
 
 How did humans get from shallow to deep symbols?
 
 When did fully modern speech effectively replace bodily gestures?
 
 If all humans are in the same species, Homo sapiens sapiens, why don’t 
we all speak the same language?
Admitting our uncertainty
What do anthropologists really know about language evolution? Not much. 
Even the origin of language is up in the air; theories on when human language 
first appeared vary wildly:
 
 Just over 2 million years ago: Some say language must have been pres-
ent to allow the large-brained, relatively fragile new genus Homo to sur-
vive on the open savannah.

234
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
 
 About 1.8 million years ago: Some match the use of symbolic language 
with the appearance of the symmetrical stone tools used by early Homo 
erectus because, according to proponents, the symmetry of hand axes 
was itself a symbol.
 
 About 200,000 years ago: Some say that language would have appeared 
with the first representatives of Homo sapiens, the very-large-brained 
species that goes on to become modern humans, dated to more than 
170,000 years ago.
 
 About 100,000 years ago: Some say that only when anthropology sees 
plenty of evidence of deep symbols can it be sure that relatively modern 
human language emerged, as indicated by symbolic artifacts dated to 
this period.
Researchers have based their theories on the evolution of language on vari-
ous types of evidence, but each line of evidence has a flaw. For example:
 
 The size of the hypoglosseal canal: Some say the larger this nerve-
bundle conduit located at the base of the skull is, the more the mind is 
engaged in language. This is because the canal is used to control fine 
movements of the mouth, but research has showed it’s just as large, 
relatively speaking, in the minds of nonspeaking, non-human primates as 
in humans, so it’s of little use.
 
 The hyoid bone: Some say a modern-appearing hyoid bone — which is 
part of the speech anatomy situated at the base of the tongue — would 
indicate language, but the hyoid is very delicate and rarely fossilizes; the 
analysis of the few that have been found has been so contentious that I 
don’t put much stake in it. Some say it indicates that Neanderthals could 
make the full range of modern phonemes, others that they couldn’t — 
nobody knows for sure.
 
 Symbolic artifacts: Some say that language is an example of symbolic 
thinking, and that it must have been used by the bearers of the first sym-
bolic artifacts; these are close to 100,000 years old. Others argue that 
symbolic thinking and language could have occurred for thousands of 
years before they showed up in artifacts, and so the earliest use of lan-
guage might be archaeologically invisible.

235
 Chapter 13: Can We Talk? Communication, Symbols, and Language
Explaining language diversity
It appears that as modern humans emerged from Africa around 100,000 years 
ago and colonized the rest of the world (you can read more about this migra-
tion in Chapters 7 and 8), foraging groups developed their own dialects and 
then languages, perhaps driven by a need to describe the new plants, ani-
mals, and environments they encountered.
Language was very important as a means of survival because humans aren’t 
born with much useful instinctual knowledge; we certainly don’t instinctu-
ally know how to grind a sliver of bone into a needle, thread it with seal gut, 
and then use that to sew together clothing to live in the Arctic. All the knowl-
edge of how to negotiate your place in a society, all of the knowledge of your 
family history and myths and dreams — all that culture — had to be trans-
mitted from one generation to the next, and language provided that link. The 
better the language reflected the environment, the closer the fit of the people 
to the environment. A culture’s vocabulary and capacity to model, in their 
minds, the environments they encountered were measures of that culture’s 
likelihood of survival.
Over time, many languages evolved; today, anthropologists know of about 
6,000 human languages, though many are spoken by only a few people. Most 
humans speak one of nine main languages: Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, 
English, Bengali, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, and German. (You 
can read more about the alarming loss of traditional languages worldwide in 
Chapter 18.)
To understand the evolution of human languages, anthropologists have 
used methods such as glottochronology, which estimates the rate at which 
languages change. Combining archaeological and linguistic anthropological 
data, anthropologists have identified the main language groups, called 
phyla. You can find maps showing their distribution at webspace.ship.
edu/cgboer/languagefamilies.html.
 
Not all linguistic anthropologists agree on what languages go in which groups 
in the language phyla. Some would move certain specific languages from one 
group to another. Still, most of these groups are widely accepted.
In the same way, Figure 13-2 shows the relationships between some of the 
main language groups; most linguistic anthropologists would consider this 
diagram a reasonable approximation of what’s known about human lan-
guages today.

Making room for new theories
Thousands of researchers, from every discipline, have contemplated the ori-
gins of language. By 1865, the Linguistic Society of Paris — fed up with wild 
speculation — refused to publish in its scholarly journal any further papers 
on the origins of language; until more was known, they said, all was guess-
work. Within a few years the Philological Society of London said essentially 
the same thing.
As anthropology was growing as a discipline in the early 20th century, the 
need for a scientific understanding of language to understand humanity 
became clear. Years of research have shown that humanity evolves, like all 
other life forms, with a long and complex evolutionary past. If anything sepa-
rated humanity from the rest of the animal kingdom, it was spoken language, 
and that meant language had to be understood. The range of explanations 
has been enormous.
In my view the most compelling recent theories of the evolution of language 
have been proposed by physical anthropologist Robin Dunbar and psycholo-
gist Merlin Donald. (You can read more about each of their models of lan-
guage evolution in Chapter 7.)
Social grooming
In short, Dunbar’s social grooming hypothesis states that language evolved as 
a way of making social relationships in primate groups easier. In non-human 
primates, Dunbar observes, social order and cohesion are maintained by long 
periods of physical grooming, where individuals clean each other’s hair by 

237
 Chapter 13: Can We Talk? Communication, Symbols, and Language
picking out parasites; this practice promotes close bonds and intimacy and 
dampens social conflict.
Dunbar argues that because most human talk is small talk about others in 
one’s immediate social sphere, language evolved as social grooming a more 
effective way to communicate that includes complex vocalizations as well 
as physical action. Speech, Dunbar points out, can be used to address or 
“groom” more than one member of society at a time.
Representing ideas
Psychologist Merlin Donald believes that whatever language was used for 
among our ancient ancestors, it was most importantly a new and more 
efficient way to represent ideas. The word “represent” is important here, 
because for Donald, the fact that humans continually and voluntarily recall 
(that is, re-present) old ideas and memories of past events is of major signifi-
cance; it breaks the mind out of the here and now, allowing for abstraction 
and deep symbolism, two hallmarks of the human mind.
Personally, I think these theories are both great ideas. To show you just how 
little anthropologists know for certain, though, have a look at this list of ques-
tions posed in a recent research article on the origins of language; these are 
questions that linguists and linguistic anthropologists themselves are asking 
(taken from M.H. Christiansen and S. Kirby’s 2003 article “Language evolu-
tion: Consensus and Controversies”):
 
 Can an evolutionary approach help us discover innately determined fea-
tures of language?
 
 What role does evolution by natural selection have to play in explaining 
language origins?
 
 Can genetic and archaeological evidence converge on a timetable for the 
origins of language in hominids?
For the moment, I think it’s safe to say that anthropology just doesn’t know 
when speech or language first appeared. But I do think we’re closing in on 
the answer. The work of Robin Dunbar and Merlin Donald, to me, are the 
most interesting at the moment. I think it’s safe to say that human language 
evolved as an efficient way of making social commentary. Until anthropology 
knows more, that’s all I’m going to hang my hat on.

Types of Types: Race and Ethnicity
In This Chapter
 Reviewing the history of racial classification in anthropology
 Understanding why the term race is almost meaningless
 Discovering what an ethnic group is
 Examining how ethnic and biological diversity is important for humanity
W
hat kind of person are you anyway? We all have an answer: black, 
white, Hispanic — no, Latino! Every society classifies humans into 
ethnic groups and races, often blurring the two or simply making them up for 
convenience.
In this chapter I describe how anthropologists think of race, and just what 
ethnic groups really are. Although the concept of race is dead as a doornail in 
the world of anthropology, many people outside anthropology still believe in 
it, which can have terrible consequences such as racial discrimination. 
Differences between ethnic groups can also cause terrible conflict. To better 
understand the human species, you have to know what anthropology has dis-
covered about these “types” of the one “human type” of the primate order.
The Kinds of Humanity: Human 
Physical Variation
People come in many colors and shapes; people of the Mediterranean, for 
example, are obviously darker-skinned than those of Scandinavia, and natives 
of the Arctic are shorter and stockier than the tall, lean Samburu of East 
Africa. Why is this? How did these variations come about, and what do they 
mean for humanity as a species?

240
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
The answer comes from the study of human biology by physical anthropolo-
gists. In this section you see how human populations have adapted to their 
varying environments by the same evolutionary process that shapes all living 
things.
The race card: Racial types 
and physical anthropology
Like all living things with sensory input, humans have to classify their per-
ceptions into some kind of order: These things go with these others but don’t 
belong in this group. Some people have darker skin, so they’re in the “darker 
skin” category. And so on. Obviously, not all human beings look the same, so 
humans have spent some time putting people of different colors, body 
shapes, and so on into different categories sometimes called races. 
Unfortunately, this tendency has had some very bad consequences for mil-
lions of human beings over the centuries.
Biologically speaking, a race is a group of organisms of the same species that 
share similar physical (and genetic) attributes and specific geographic regions. 
In short, they’re subdivisions of a single species — meaning they can mate and 
have offspring that are healthy enough to have their own offspring — exhibiting 
some characteristics reflecting their geographical origins.
 
This definition is pretty slippery, though, because finding good examples of 
distinctly different races is difficult. The most visible non-human animal 
races are those of dogs. From Chihuahua to Great Dane, all dogs are in the 
same species — Canis familiaris — but they have obvious physical differ-
ences. Strictly speaking, they’re of different races — and even this isn’t so 
strict, because these differences come from humans selectively breeding 
these animals for certain characteristics, not from their originally inhabiting 
very different environments. Once, all dogs (most likely first domesticated 
about 20,000 years ago) were wolf-like, and their modern diversity is more a 
result of human selective breeding than geographical adaptation.
Just like any other living thing, human beings adapt to their environments 
through an evolutionary process. Throughout this book I emphasize that our 
species adapts mainly through cultural means; that is, we survive our envi-
ronments not because we’ve adapted to them biologically, but with artifacts 
and complex behavior. (For more on cultural adaptation, see Chapter 11.) 
Having said that, human bodies have adapted to certain conditions over 
time.

241
 Chapter 14: Types of Types: Race and Ethnicity
 
Adaptation is a process — behavioral or biological — that increases the likeli-
hood of survival for an organism. An adaptation can be a mutation that con-
fers an advantage. For example, a frog that has better-camouflaged skin than 
its siblings has a lower chance of being snapped up by a fish, and therefore a 
stronger chance to survive and have offspring that will carry the gene for 
better-adapted camouflage. In humans, adaptations include complex behavior, 
such as making tools. These behaviors aren’t passed on genetically but rather 
culturally.
Some of these bodily adaptations are pretty easily visible, and some are only 
visible when you look very closely at the genes. Skin color — one of the most 
visible human characteristics — is a good example of adaptation to a particu-
lar environment. The darkest skin appears in populations originating in tropi-
cal zones, such as Africa and Asia. The lightest skin is traditionally found in 
northern Europe because over time, natural selection favored darker skins in 
areas that received extensive and more intensive sunlight, because individu-
als with lighter skin in these areas were more prone to skin cancers. Darker 
skin, then, is an adaptation to the geographical conditions of Africa.
What’s the adaptive value of lighter skin? It has to do with vitamin D, of all 
things. Vitamin D is a nutrient that helps human bones form properly. 
Without enough vitamin D, deformities like the disease rickets, which nor-
mally includes bowed legs and a misshapen pelvis, will occur. In females, 
rickets result in a deformed birth canal, which makes normal childbirth haz-
ardous if not lethal.
Humans naturally produce Vitamin D through the skin when they’re exposed 
to sunlight, but cloudier parts of the world — like northern Europe — are 
exposed to much less sunlight than regions in the tropics, where the species 
began. As early human populations were expanding into northern Europe 
around 40,000 years ago, those individuals with darker skin were less able to 
manufacture Vitamin D and probably experienced a much lower birthrate 
than those populations with lighter skin. (You can read more about this 
expansion in Chapters 7 and 8.) Lighter skin, then, is an adaptation to the 
geographical conditions of Europe because over time, the prehistoric colo-
nists of Europe who happened to be born with lighter skin (simply by 
chance) had more offspring, who themselves carried the genes for lighter 
skin.
 
Biological adaptations aren’t instantaneous. They take place over the span of 
generations, so an African moving to Europe won’t evolve lighter skin, nor will 
a European travelling to Africa evolve darker skin (except for some tanning). A 
suntan is a lighter-skinned body’s defense mechanism — the release of dark-
pigmented melanin — against too much ultraviolet light. See Figure 14-1 for a 
skin color map of the world. Note it shows shades in a spectrum from very 
dark to very light, and the cutoff point for various shades of skin color are 
essentially arbitrary. The map could change a bit as the cutoff points shift. 

242
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
Also, note that these are shades of native peoples’ skin, and mixing native and 
non-native populations has the tendency to change skin shade.

Another example of biological adaptation in human beings is the difference of 
stature between arctic (such as Inuit) and East African (such as Maasai) folk. 
In biology, Bergmann’s rule indicates that in colder regions, warm-blooded 
animals will have stockier bodies than their counterparts from warmer 
regions, because stockier bodies are more efficient at retaining body heat. In 
the cold polar regions, the Inuit have a short and stocky build; the Maasai of 
East Africa have taller and more slender bodies that don’t have to retain so 
much heat — they actually have to dump excess heat in their hot environ-
ment, which is facilitated by their body shape. Body stature in these cases is 
an adaptation to the geographical conditions of hot African and the cold 
Arctic.
 
The rapid physiological changes that occur in one’s lifetime — like a moun-
taineer’s adjustment to lower oxygen levels at high altitude — are referred to 
as habituation or acclimatization. These aren’t passed on genetically to the 
next generation (because changes acquired during life can’t be encoded in the 
genes,) and they’re reversible (as when the mountaineer returns to lower ele-
vations.)
The lowdown: What anthropologists can 
say for sure about human races
So do human races exist? Very strictly speaking, yes. Homo sapiens sapiens 
does feature geographically based differences within the species. However, 
you must consider two very important points.

243
 Chapter 14: Types of Types: Race and Ethnicity
First, these genetic differences don’t mean a lot, biologically. Because all 
healthy humans can mate and have healthy offspring, we’re all in Homo sapiens 
sapiens, biologically speaking. Don’t let anyone tell you different. Not only is it 
inaccurate to say “the female species” when talking about significant sex differ-
ences between males and females, but it’s also inaccurate to say “the African 
race” or the “European race” when speaking of deep differences in these peo-
ples. A look at the genes shows no significant species-level differences — only 
very minor visible ones such as skin color, shape of nose, or hair texture. 
Biologically speaking, though, these differences aren’t important. For most 
physical anthropologists (who’ve spent the most time closely examining 
human biology), race is nearly meaningless when applied to humanity.
Rather than talk about races, physical anthropologists more commonly talk 
today of ancestry, a more general term that recognizes the reality of some 
geographically specific human adaptations but doesn’t turn them into 
loaded, black-and-white races (pun intended.) Ancestry may be important, 
for example, when considering someone’s genetic health because different 
human populations have developed slightly different genetic characteristics 
over time.
Second — and most important — is that cultural behavior isn’t genetically 
linked to those geographical differences. This disconnect is one of anthropol-
ogy’s most important discoveries and lessons for humanity. People from 
Scandinavia aren’t reserved — or whatever other behavioral trait you may 
apply to them — because it’s in their genes to be so. It’s not. Most of human 
behavior isn’t biologically determined or filtered in through the natural 
environment — most of it is culturally learned. An infant from Japan can be 
raised in the Kalahari of Southern Africa and won’t automatically remove his 
shoes when going into a home unless his culture specifically teaches him to 
do so. Like any human can acquire any language, any infant can acquire any 
culture; it’s culture that really drives behavior, not the genes. The ancient 
belief that human races have innate behavioral traits — industrious Asians or 
hot-blooded Mediterraneans — is simply wrong.
One of the main reasons the race concept really doesn’t apply to humans is 
that defining human races is almost impossible: To what race do you assign a 
person born from a Native American and a native African marriage? Do you 
create a new race in this case? Although some of these designations do exist, 
to come up with a race for every possible combination of ancestries would be 
an infinite job. Plus, it would just be another exercise in drawing lines where 
they don’t really exist. And what’s “black” or “white”? Is a Greek person black 
or white? Of course, they’re in between. Assigning people to a race based on 
skin color becomes an exercise in holding up paint chips to the skin.
Figure 14-2 shows genetic relationship among human populations. Note that 
although most anthropologists agree that these relationships are essentially 

244
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
accurate, there is always some debate in science. Note also that genetic 
mixing from one population to another causes a lot of ambiguity. Also 
remember that political boundaries such as country names aren’t genetic 
boundaries, so here I have tried to avoid naming countries and focus instead 
on regions.

 Chapter 14: Types of Types: Race and Ethnicity
The history of racial typing
If race is such a nonissue for humanity, why has anthropology been so con-
cerned with it for so long? And why is it such a big issue today? Answering 
these questions requires looking at how long humans have been talking 
about race and seeing what the concept of race has meant for anthropology.
Like all animals, humans have undoubtedly been classifying their neighbors 
in various ways for a very long time. So far, I’m unaware that any archaeo-
logist has spotted depictions of different races in early cave art, and 
unfortunately — though modern human behavior seems to begin around 
100,000 years ago — most cave art ranges from roughly 35,000 to 11,000 
years ago. Some of the first records of humans classifying others as certain 
“types” come from ancient Egypt, where by 1350 BC you can see records of 
them classifying humans by skin color: Egyptians were red-skinned, people 
south of Egypt were black-skinned, those living north of the Mediterranean 
Sea were white-skinned, and people to the east were yellow-skinned.
By the the16th century, during the Age of Discovery, Europeans voyaging 
around the world were encountering many previously unknown peoples and 
developing racial classifications of their own. Because skin color was so 
noticeable, many racial classifications were based only on that factor. 
Additionally, these unknown people weren’t Christian and didn’t share 
European culture and values, so the Europeans labeled them Savages. In fact, 
they thought they could use racial type as an indicator of just how Savage a 
person was. The less European-looking, of course, the more Savage. Though 
most have ditched this concept today, many racial supremacists still believe 
that cultural behavior correlates with skin color, nose shape, hair texture, or 
what have you.
 
Some naturalists in the 16th through 19th centuries proposed that savages 
were even a different species than white Europeans, saying that they shouldn’t 
even be considered human. This classification made persecution and enslave-
ment of different peoples purely because of how they looked much easier.
Early attempts by Europeans to categorize people into racial schemes were 
extremely biased and hierarchical, associating morality and intelligence with 
skin color and other physical attributes. These schemes always placed 
Europeans at the top of the scale, and the successively darker-skinned peo-
ples at the bottom.

Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
By the mid-1800s, naturalists began using a method of describing the shape 
of the head called the cephalic index, a ratio measurement of the length and 
width of the head. Dolichocephalic peoples had long and narrow heads (like 
most northern Europeans), and brachycephalic peoples tended to have broad 
heads — like many southern Europeans. Not surprisingly, this classification 
scheme and others like it led to many arguments about which peoples were 
superior to the others.
The root problem of all this flailing around at the identification of human 
types was biological determinism, the idea that physical traits were somehow 
linked to behavior. Many thought traits like intellect, values, and morals were 
all products of one’s race. Today, most people know better, although some 
people still wear sheets and call for “racial purity,” an impossible and 
destructive idea I discuss later in this chapter.
 
A similar way that everyone — including early anthropologists — had this 
idea all wrong was in the application of Darwin’s principles of biological evolu-
tion to societies. This led to a concept known as social Darwinism, the idea 
that as societies and nations evolved and competed, the morally superior 
societies would prevail as the less-moral, “savage” societies were weeded out, 
Biological determinism: Knocked on the chin
Linking physical appearance to cultural attri-
butes went beyond skin color. In the late 19th 
century, any trait seemed to distinguish the 
moral character or industriousness of a popu-
lation group. Any physical trait chosen always 
seemed to justify the inferiority of the darker 
skinned peoples. Take this example from a 
book on human origins published by S. Liang in 
London in 1892:
“And the form of the chin seems to be won-
derfully correlated with the general character 
and energy of the race. It is hard to say why, 
but as a matter of fact a weak chin generally 
denotes a weak, and a strong chin a strong, 
race or individual. Thus the chimpanzee and the 
other apes have no chin, the negro and other 
races have chins weak and receding. The races 
who, like the Iberians, have been conquered or 
driven from plains to mountain, have had poor 
chins; while their successive conquerors, of 
Aryan race — Celts, Romans, Teutons and 
Scandinavians — might almost be classified 
by the prominence and solidity of this feature 
of the face.”
Liang expected his reading audience to believe 
that the size or shape of a person’s chin could 
be equated with “character” or “energy.” 
Additionally, Liang ranked human populations 
according to their skin color, with whites being 
at the top, darker-skinned southern Europeans 
below them, and peoples of African origin at 
the bottom, closer to the non-human primates. 
Today, anthropologists know all humans are 
genetically very similar, and all are equally dis-
tant from the non-human primates; our genus, 
Homo, split from them many millions of years 
ago. Many writers, like Liang, were really 
attempting to find supposedly scientific facts to 
justify the great social injustices that existed in 
their societies.

247
 Chapter 14: Types of Types: Race and Ethnicity
and that this was all natural and good. Around this time debates about the 
superiority or inferiority of particular groups continued and some began to 
fear that civilized (meaning northern European Christian) society was slowly 
being destroyed by “unfit” peoples who, for one reason or another, were not 
being weeded out.
With behavioral characteristics “linked” to genetic characteristics in the 
minds of many (including scientists), some in the 19th and early 20th centu-
ries even advocated for state regulation of marriages, family size, and 
whether to allow an individual to reproduce. This practice became known as 
eugenics, and the Nazis took it to a terrible extreme during World War II. In 
Germany, the Nazi party began to systematically kill those members of soci-
ety that it considered inferior to the northern-European Christian ideal they 
held. Using eugenics as the basis for its acts, the Nazi party killed millions of 
Jewish people, Gypsies, homosexuals, and others it considered inferior in an 
attempt to create a master race.
The problems with the concept of a master race — aside from the obvious 
moral issues surrounding eugenics — is that biological variation is necessary 
for the health of a population. Basically, if all members of a population are 
the same, the population has no buffer against a particularly lethal or cata-
strophic disease or any other major change in the species’ selective environ-
ment. If everyone is the same, everyone is susceptible to the same potential 
disaster. For this reason, many biologists measure the overall health of a spe-
cies by its very genetic diversity. So even if a master race were possible, and 
one could (and would want to) manage to prevent any interbreeding, the end 
result would be a genetically uniform and genetically vulnerable population. 
The idea of a master race is therefore suicidal.
 
Even today, the U.S. military still uses its old-school letter identification 
system on some paperwork to describe a person’s ethnic group. This ridicu-
lous system designates N for Negro, C for Caucasian, M for Mongoloid (more 
properly known today as Asian), and R for Native Americans (which I can only 
guess stands for Redskin). Time for Uncle Sam to get with the times!
The grand illusion: Race, 
turns out, is arbitrary
Over the years, various anthropologists have attempted to classify the 
human species into various races, such as Caucasian, Black African, Asian, 
and so on. The problem is that the physical traits used to identify which 
group an individual belonged in aren’t binary opposites like black or white, 
period, with no middle ground. They’re continuous traits, meaning that a 
whole spectrum exists between, say, “black” and “white” skin designations. 

248
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
Any attempt to classify human races raises a number of questions. Although 
Asians look pretty clearly different from Europeans in some respects, what do 
you do with people who look, well, partly Asian and partly European? And does 
“European” end in the Middle East, where some African traits are present? 
Where does Africa even begin, genetically speaking? Who’s going to draw up 
the lines between “black” and “white” (and what qualifies that person for the 
job, anyway)? One thorough 1972 study by Harvard anthropologist R.C. 
Lewontin concluded that “Human racial classification is of no social value and 
is positively destructive of social and human relations. Since such racial classi-
fication is now seen to be of virtually no genetic or taxonomic [classifying] sig-
nificance either, no justification can be offered for its continuance.”
Bottom line: For most professional anthropologists today, human “race” is an 
antiquated concept. For biomedical reasons (and sometimes forensic identifi-
cation of bodies), the reality of genetic ancestry can be important, but color-
coded races, loaded with behavioral traits, are basically arbitrary.
Why Is Everyone Different? 
Human Cultural Variation
Although all humans are of the same species, they don’t all act the same; 
human behavior varies tremendously worldwide. If race doesn’t control a 
person’s characteristics, what does account for human behavioral variation?
In short, the answer is culture. Cultures differ because people live in different 
conditions, be they ecological, economic, social, or what have you. For exam-
ple, each culture is ultimately a unique adaptation to the social and environ-
mental conditions in which it evolves. The culture of the Amazonian foragers 
has certain characteristics, and they value certain things and act certain 
ways, because they have evolved in a particular ecological environment, one 
different from highland Scots, whose own culture is an adaptation to their 
unique environment. This difference is ultimately why human behavior isn’t 
the same worldwide.
Of course, human cultures have been evolving for thousands of years — and 
in the modern age, with mass communication and mass movement of peoples 
from one environment and culture to another, culture has changed very 
quickly. So it may be a stretch today to see the direct ecological reason for 
any given human behavior; in fact, the winds of history have probably 
shaped modern cultures as much as, if not more than, the ecological adapta-
tions that they were in the first place.

 Chapter 14: Types of Types: Race and Ethnicity
Distinguishing ethnicity from race
What does all this have to do with ethnicity? A lot. For a long time, many 
people have used the terms “race” and “ethnic group” interchangeably — 
and wrongly so. An ethnic group is a collection of people who share some cul-
tural characteristics because they share a common history. That history may 
The American Anthropological Association’s 
position on race
In 1998, the American Anthropological 
Association released a statement on race that 
you can find at the following Web link: www.
aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm. Here 
are some excerpts:
“In the United States both scholars and the 
general public have been conditioned to view-
ing human races as natural and separate divi-
sions within the human species based on visible 
physical differences. With the vast expansion of 
scientific knowledge in this century, however, 
it has become clear that human populations 
are not unambiguous, clearly demarcated, bio-
logically distinct groups . . . .Throughout history 
whenever different groups have come into con-
tact, they have interbred. The continued shar-
ing of genetic materials has maintained all of 
humankind as a single species.”
“Historical research has shown that the idea of 
“race” has always carried more meanings than 
mere physical differences; indeed, physical 
variations in the human species have no mean-
ing except the social ones that humans put on 
them. Today scholars in many fields argue that 
“race” as it is understood in the United States 
of America was a social mechanism invented 
during the 18th century to refer to those popu-
lations brought together in colonial America: 
the English and other European settlers, the 
conquered Indian peoples, and those peoples 
of Africa brought in to provide slave labor.”
“It is a basic tenet of anthropological knowl-
edge that all normal human beings have the 
capacity to learn any cultural behavior. The 
American experience with immigrants from 
hundreds of different language and cultural 
backgrounds who have acquired some ver-
sion of American culture traits and behavior is 
the clearest evidence of this fact. Moreover, 
people of all physical variations have learned 
different cultural behaviors and continue to do 
so as modern transportation moves millions of 
immigrants around the world.”
The “racial” worldview was invented to assign 
some groups to perpetual low status, while others 
were permitted access to privilege, power, and 
wealth. The tragedy in the United States has been 
that the policies and practices stemming from this 
worldview succeeded all too well in constructing 
unequal populations among Europeans, Native 
Americans, and peoples of African descent. 
Given what we know about the capacity of normal 
humans to achieve and function within any culture, 
we conclude that present-day inequalities between 
so-called “racial” groups are not consequences of 
their biological inheritance but products of histori-
cal and contemporary social, economic, educa-
tional, and political circumstances.”

Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
include marrying people of the same general physical types — such as whites 
tending to marry whites in 1950s America or Italians tending to marry Italians 
when they immigrated to the U.S. — and here is where race (or physical char-
acteristics) and ethnicity (or cultural characteristics) get mixed up.
 
An ethnic group is a subdivision of a larger culture in which it normally 
exists. Like culture, ethnic groups are difficult to define. For example, an 
active, vibrant Sicilian American ethnic group centers on a wonderful little 
restaurant in Portland, Oregon, but how would I define it? Making a list of 
its shared beliefs, values, traditions, and so on would be difficult. Still, it’s 
there — and I’m happy for it, because they serve the best food in town.
Ethnic groups tend to be bonded by rituals and traditions that remind their 
members of their ethnicity and their shared trials and triumphs through 
time. They also usually identify with a specific geographical area — even if 
their ancestors migrated away from that area in the distant past — that they 
often remember sentimentally in their myths and traditions.
A common horror: Ethnic cleansing
Ethnically based conflicts can be very fierce because the shared history and 
values of the ethnic groups are in conflict. Ethnic groups that are in the 
minority are often very careful to maintain their identity; it may be all they 
really have, so they’re fiercely protective of their historical claims, such as 
claims to land, and traditional values, such as those found in their religion.
The power of ethnic identity has often been exploited by tyrannical leaders 
who often try to divide and conquer by pitting one ethnic group against 
another. The attempt to eliminate an ethnic group is called genocide; former 
Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic directed one of the worst cases of 
genocide in recent history. After the collapse of Yugoslavia in the mid-’90s, 
many areas of the former country splintered along ethnic lines. Milosevic and 
others felt that ethnic Albanians and Croatians living in Serbia posed a threat 
to the integrity of Serbia, and so began a process they called ethnic cleansing, 
which is essentially another name for genocide. Milosevic and his subordi-
nates began to rid Serbia of ethnic Albanians and Croats by murdering them 
by the thousands.
A few years earlier, in the eastern African nation of Rwanda, a similar situa-
tion developed. The Hutu, a traditional farming ethnic group, decided that 
there wasn’t enough land for it to coexist with the Tutsi, a pastoralist ethnic 
group in the same region. Extremists among the Hutu began to murder the 
Tutsi, and before the violence was quelled, the Hutu had killed an estimated 
1 million Tutsi.

251
 Chapter 14: Types of Types: Race and Ethnicity
A common delight: Ethnic identity
Ethnic identity provides people with a specific identity, which they often 
manifest in the following aspects of culture:
 
 Music/artistic preferences
 
 Food preferences
 
 Child-naming traditions
 
 Language or dialect
 
 Religion or value system
Most people feel most at ease when interacting with members of their own 
ethnic group because they value the same way of being human. Of course, 
this isn’t to say that because something is comfortable it’s the safest or the 
best thing to do — on the contrary, interacting with members of different 
ethnic groups can be a truly enriching experience. It’s one reason many 
people travel.
In addition to learning new ways of looking at the world and our place in it, 
interaction with other ethic groups and societies allows people to discover 
their common humanity. By sharing the best aspects of their cultures with 
one another, humans can create a truly functional multicultural or multiethnic 
society, one in which various ethnic groups coexist peacefully without some 
groups dominating others. With the world population increasing as quickly 
as it is, members of different ethnic groups are increasingly in contact with 
one another. Maintaining peaceful relationships is important and requires 
people to respect the ethnic differences between groups and remember that 
these differences are cultural, not genetic.
Many people live in a multicultural society already. For example, many 
people enjoy living in cities where they can experience the cultures of differ-
ent peoples through museum exhibits, traditional ethnic restaurants, and so 
on. Additionally, you can read the literature of other groups, learn their histo-
ries and artistic traditions, and so on. These are just some of the advantages 
of living in a multicultural society.
Ethnic group interactions
In a 1985 study, anthropologists George Simpson and J. Milton Yinger classi-
fied six ways that different ethnic groups have interacted in recent history. 
Anthropologist Gary Ferraro subsequently reviewed these forms of interac-
tion and offered generally good examples for each. With some reinterpreta-
tions of my own, they’re in order here from best case to worst case scenario.

252
Part III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
Pluralism
Pluralism is essentially the salad bowl concept, in which several intact, identi-
fiable culture groups coexist in a single society. In Switzerland, for example, 
German-, French-, and Italian-speaking peoples all coexist peacefully. Each of 
these groups inhabits a different part of Switzerland, where they maintain 
their individual ethnic identities, foods, languages, and customs while all rec-
ognizing that they’re Swiss.
Assimiliation
Assimilation is essentially the Melting Pot concept, in which an ethnic minor-
ity is absorbed into the greater society. A good example is Hawaiian society, 
a culture into which various Asian groups have assimilated. Assimilation 
involves several stages.
Social assimilation is the first stage, in which a minority group joins the domi-
nant culture and is forced to participate in the society and use the social 
institutions of that dominant group. Use of the social institutions such as 
schools, markets, and churches is common. Unfortunately, changing the 
dominant language spoken by the minority group is often a priority for the 
assimilating society; this practice often involves outlawing native languages, 
as was common when native peoples are placed on reservations where 
schools don’t teach their native languages but rather the language of the 
assimilating culture.
Cultural assimilation, in which minority groups begin to adopt cultural fea-
tures of the dominant group, is the second stage. This process includes 
adopting the value system and many customs, such as observing holidays 
not present in the native culture. The final stage, physical assimilation, 
involves physical integration, in which members of the ethnic minority inter-
marry with the dominant society and begin to have offspring. These offspring 
often face considerable challenges as they try to find an identity in either the 
originating or dominating culture.
Legal protection of minorities
Legal protection of minorities is sometimes necessary in societies where 
ethnic groups coexist but may be hostile to one another. For example, the 
United States has afforded special rights and status designed to protect tradi-
tional Native American populations; for example, Native Americans have 
jurisdiction on their reservations (which have been legally set aside for 
them). This protection can extend into the broader aspects of society as well; 
committing violence against a member of a minority group just because you 
dislike that particular group can result in prosecution for a hate crime.

253
 Chapter 14: Types of Types: Race and Ethnicity
Population transfer
Population transfer occurs when minority groups either can’t coexist with the 
dominant population or the dominant society doesn’t want to coexist with 
the minorities. Population transfer was one of the “solutions” offered by the 
Serbian government to the minority Albanians living in Serbia. The dominant 
Serb society didn’t want them living in Serbia and encouraged (if you will) 
them to move out to other countries.
Long-term subjugation
Long-term subjugation occurs in some areas of the world where ethnic groups 
are politically and economically repressed, either legally or through contin-
ued social pressures from the dominant group. For example, slavery was 
legal in the West African country of Mauritania up until 1980. Even today, 
many black Africans living in Mauritania do so along the fringes of the Arab-
dominated society.
Genocide
Genocide is the mass murder or extermination of a people by a different one. 
It typically occurs when the differences between groups are significant enough 
to make a dominant group believe that their own way of life is threatened by 
the mere existence of the other group. That is, when hatred and fear overtake 
better human nature. Tragically, I can give you too many examples of such 
events throughout human history: Serbian persecution of Albanians, Hutu 
persecution of Tutsis, Nazi persecution of multiple groups, and Turkish per-
secution of Armenians.

Identity, Family, Kinship, 
and Gender
In This Chapter

A
ll animals recognize differences between “self” and “other.” In human 
societies, these differences take on enormous significance, partly because 
humans are so individualistic — rather than being clone-like automatons, 
humans have individual personalities. We validate that individualism by 
giving infants unique names. Those names also keep track of who’s related to 
whom, sometimes for generations back into the past.
What’s the point of this obsession with who we are? Why am I named “Cameron 
McPherson Smith” rather than “#4423-A,” and why do we go further, adding 
qualifiers such as “Doctor” or “Uncle” to our names?
To understand themselves as a species, humans have to also understand 
themselves as individuals within networks of other individuals. This chapter 
explains the significance of individual identity and how cultures worldwide 
manage different kinds of identities, such as family, sexual, and gender identity.

256
Par t III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
Am I “Cameron” or “a Smith”? 
The Scales of Human Identity
If you ask me where I live, my answer will depend on the context: If we’re 
in Berlin, I may say “the United States” or “Oregon.” If we’re in downtown 
Portland, I’d probably say “Northwest Portland.” In the same way, humans 
have individual identities that can vary depending on who’s asking and in what 
context. Personally, I’m “Uncle Cameron,” “Dr. Smith,” “Cam,” or “Cameron 
McPherson Smith,” depending on whom you ask. The capacity for such mul-
tiple identities is uniquely human, and that’s because of human individuality.
The roots of human individuality are found in language. Language, our species’ 
main way of communicating, is so subtle and capable of expression that every 
mind has a slightly different varied take on things (more on why in Chapter 12). 
Because of this uniqueness, humans give individual names and titles to keep 
track of everyone. And boy, do they keep track. One study found that up to 70 
percent of people’s non-work-related conversation is about other people, as in 
“Can you believe the nerve of that guy?” and “Why on earth would she move 
to Denver?” All this careful monitoring, this obsession with a person’s place in 
the network of friends, relatives, and coworkers, is possible by keeping track of 
exactly who everyone is: by keeping track of identity.
Know thyself: Identity
Human societies universally recognize the importance of gender identity. 
Gender is a social category (relating to biological sex) that indicates what 
are considered appropriate roles, rights, and responsibilities for a particular 
gender in a particular society. Human societies also recognize at least two 
other kinds of identity:
 
 Individual: The self, “I,” “me,” identified by a personal name
 
 Intimate family: Marriage mates and other immediate family (kin), iden-
tified by a family name; even if this practice isn’t formalized by use of a 
“last name,” as it is here in the U.S., some way to indicate family identity 
is always present
Consider how these identities relate to the individual, intimate family, kin, and 
gender. For thousands of years, much of human interaction was somewhat 
smaller scale than it is with today’s global communications and the ability for 
people to move around on the Earth very rapidly.
Because social organization is so important to human culture and often relies 
on the kinds of identities I’ve just sketched out, anthropologists have made 
innumerable studies of how individuality, kinship, marriage, and gender are 
organized. The rest of this chapter outlines their main findings.

257
 Chapter 15: Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner? Identity, Family, Kinship, and Gender
What’s in a name?
Every human society has the custom of naming offspring, which, according 
to anthropologist Clifford Geertz, converts “anybodies” into “somebodies.” 
Exactly how names are chosen, though, and for what purposes, varies 
enormously.
For example, some parents select names to reflect their ideals (such as Harmony) 
or religion (Gabriel). In medieval Europe, surnames (last names) reflected 
trades (Wheelwrights made wheels, Smiths worked metal, and so on). In 
Iceland, females are given a first name followed by a surname that’s attached 
to the name of their father: Thorstein’s daughter Artna would be named 
Artna Thorsteinsdottir. And so on. All across the globe and throughout his-
tory, naming keeps track of who you are, who you’re born from, and what 
rights and responsibilities you may have.
A Family Affair
All human societies have ways of organizing their members into families. 
Worldwide, families generally have the following characteristics:
 
 Coresidence: That is, family members more or less live together; among 
the Hmong of Thailand, families occupy large houses, several of which 
form a village.
 
 Economic cooperation: Members more or less work with the economic 
interests of their family in mind, assisting (and being assisted) in times of 
stress; in traditional highland Peru, for example, the economic activities of 
each family member — like weaving, done largely by women, and plowing, 
done largely by men — are complexly adjusted as the family structure 
changes over time with births, deaths, and so on.
 
 Management of reproduction and enculturation: Members take part in 
the process of having children, providing for them, and bringing them 
to adulthood. Among the native Inupiat of Alaska, traditional strategies 
for child-rearing that used to emphasize the female’s role in childcare 
(because males were often engaged in hunting) are being adjusted to 
new economies that don’t emphasize hunting.
 
 Management of property: Members orchestrate the movement — within 
the generation and from one generation to the next — of the family’s 
property; among the Basque culture of northern Spain, the first-born 
child of a given couple was the first in line to inherit the family’s home 
and land immediately when they were married. (The inheritor’s parents 
would live with the inheriting child from that time on, but would no 
longer own the land or home.)

258
Par t III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
Family membership varies worldwide as well, but is based on a combination 
of two main kinds of relatives. Consanguines are those you’re related to by 
blood (biological brothers, mothers, and so on), and affines are people you’re 
related to by marriage (wife, father-in-law, and the like).
Although all human societies have concepts of the family, family membership 
and the rules related to it vary a great deal worldwide. In North America, the 
monogamous married couple and their offspring (the nuclear family) are widely 
considered the “ideal” family. But this arrangement is an ideal, not necessarily 
the reality. In the United States, depending on whom you ask (the online U.S. 
Census Bureau data are years out of date), only about half of people live in this 
kind of nuclear family; single-parent households are very common.
In some cultures, the immediate nuclear family is less significant than the extended 
family, which includes multitudes of uncles, cousins, and so on. In these cases, the 
American family definitions
The U.S. Census Bureau collects data on 
American families, and I’ve listed its definitions 
of certain terms in the following list. Remember 
that the definitions of these terms aren’t univer-
sal — they’re specific to the modern U.S. (or a 
few years ago, when they were written). One of 
the lessons of anthropology is that such terms 
may not be universally applicable.
  Family: A group of two people or more 
(one of whom is the householder) related 
by birth, marriage, or adoption and resid-
ing together; all such people (including 
related subfamily members) are consid-
ered as members of one family. . . . The 
number of families is equal to the number 
of family households, however, the 
count of family members differs from 
the count of family household members 
because family household members include 
any non-relatives living in the household.
  Household: A household consists of all the 
people who occupy a housing unit. A house, 
an apartment or other group of rooms, or a 
single room, is regarded as a housing unit 
when it is occupied or intended for occu-
pancy as separate living quarters; that is, 
when the occupants do not live and eat 
with any other persons in the structure and 
there is direct access from the outside or 
through a common hall.
  Married couple: A married couple, as 
defined for census purposes, is a hus-
band and wife enumerated as members of 
the same household. The married couple 
may or may not have children living with 
them. The expression “husband-wife” or 
“married-couple” before the term “house-
hold,” “family,” or “subfamily” indicates 
that the household, family, or subfamily 
is maintained by a husband and wife. The 
number of married couples equals the count 
of married-couple families plus related and 
unrelated married-couple subfamilies.
What terms do you think may have to be rede-
fined in the future?

259
 Chapter 15: Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner? Identity, Family, Kinship, and Gender
family may be more interested in the most recent two or three generations than 
in those many years past simply because of the complexity of relations. In either 
case, all human societies distinguish between two main kinds of relations: the 
families one is born from, and the family one begins, which I discuss in the 
next section.
 
Families can get very complex, so remember that anthropological categories 
can often be pretty fuzzy. A very large, extended family living together may be 
better called a “domestic group” than a family, because it may include long-
term visitors, for example, or very distant relations being brought back into 
the social network. Remember, the world is usually more complicated than 
any anthropological statement. The human species has found many ways to 
be human.
Families of origin versus 
families of procreation
Every human society keeps track of the family of origin — the family from 
which a person was born. Cultures use kinship terms such as mother, father, 
brother, aunt, and so on to indicate a person’s role(s) in the family of origin. 
These can get very complicated. In traditional Chinese kinship there are separate 
terms for one’s elder or younger uncles and aunts, whereas in the Western system 
there is only “uncle.” The family of procreation, or the family a person begins when 
he or she marries and begins to have offspring, also uses kinship terms such as 
son, cousin, and sister-in-law to keep track of these additional family members. (In 
most traditional cultures, marriage is a fundamental step in beginning a family.) 
See the “Kinship” section later in this chapter.
Incest
Both family of origin and family of procreation are important in the regulation 
of sexual behavior. One of the most important regulations has to do with the 
incest taboo, which is the prohibition of sexual relations with close relatives 
(incest). Again, exactly who is prohibited from relations with whom varies 
somewhat worldwide (although one study of more than 250 societies showed 
that in every case, sexual relations between members of the same nuclear 
family were forbidden), but the taboo universally involves prohibition of 
sexual relations between parents and their immediate biological offspring. The 
universality of the incest taboo suggests its great importance for humanity — if 
humans interbreed too closely, it can have negative genetic effects.

260
Par t III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
Marriage
Marriage is the socially sanctioned union of two people — usually a male and a 
female — with a couple of main characteristics. Although divorce is possible, 
and in some societies common (as in the U.S. today, and among the Tuareg of the 
Sahara, where women may have several husbands before the age of 30), the social 
expectation at the ceremony of marriage is that the union will be permanent. In 
addition, marriage usually comes with a general expectation that the union will be 
sexually monogamous between the married pair (although customs vary).
Marriage is a complex union that has many functions; it can join romantic 
partners, but even in these cases it has a lot to do with the management of 
property, rights, and offspring. A society’s marriage customs largely dictate 
how it arranges and manages families and what terms it uses to keep track 
of them. As always, these customs vary quite a bit worldwide. Arranged mar-
riage matches individuals not for reasons of romantic love but because the 
marriage brings honor (and sometimes material wealth and prestige) to the 
families of the married couple. Also (as in India,) many societies that prac-
tice arranged marriage believe that young people can’t make good decisions 
about marriage, and that if their elders make them, the marriage is more 
likely to survive.
 
Many factors play into the decision to marry; in the United States, one important 
factor has been age. In 1890, most couples married around 20 or 25 years of 
age, whereas today many marry closer to 30 years of age. This delay may have 
to do with the increase in life expectancy, which was around 40 years in the 
1800s and is closer to 70 years today.
Marriage is normally between a male and a female because for many thousands 
of years the institution has been deeply concerned with the rearing of off-
spring, and matching up pairs of males and females takes advantage of each 
parent’s qualities to protect the children. But the times, they are a-changin’: 
Particularly in Western civilization, the marriage of same-sex couples is 
becoming more common. In non-Westernized cultures, same-sex marriage 
can occur, but it’s pretty rare.
Another cultural variation deals with the number of people a person can be 
married to. One common variation is polygyny, or the marriage of a male to 
more than one female. This practice is very common worldwide: About 70 
percent of human cultures approve of the arrangement (at least in principle), 
but because getting the union sanctioned by multiple family members and 
providing for several wives at once are both difficult tasks, many more males 
worldwide aspire to polygyny than actually practice it.
Another similar practice is polyandry, the marriage of a female to more than 
one male. Polyandry is very rare worldwide, practiced only in sub-Himalayan 

261
 Chapter 15: Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner? Identity, Family, Kinship, and Gender
Asia (Nepal, Tibet, and India); it likely originated with the cultural practice 
of female infanticide (carried out for complex reasons), which reduced the 
number of marriageable females in society.
Another dimension of variability in marriages is the question of whether one 
marries in or marries out. Endogamy is the tradition marrying within a speci-
fied and well-known social, economic, and/or racial group; for example, royal 
families are very careful to marry among their own social level (that is, other 
royals), though even royals buck this trend occasionally, as in the case of the 
British royal Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer (who became Princess 
Diana). Although Diana wasn’t royalty, she was from the aristocratic Spencer 
family, so Charles hadn’t strayed too far from the norm. The opposite of endog-
amy is exogamy, or consciously marrying well outside the boundaries of your 
closer relations. People often do this to escape certain economic restrictions 
(such as marrying up to a higher social/economic level) or, more practically (in 
small-scale societies), to prevent the genetic problems that come from incest, 
such as birth defects. Some cultures prohibit marrying outside ones’ subcul-
ture; for example, in the Indian caste system, people are supposed to marry 
within their own specific social rank.
Kinship
Although marriage deals specifically with whom a person marries, kinship 
deals with all relations, those by blood and those by marriage. It’s so com-
plex, in fact, that anthropologists have come up with a glossary of kinship 
terms and a way of graphically diagramming kin relations that produces dia-
grams much like a family tree; a very simple example is shown in Figure 15-1. 
Rather than cover the whole world of kinship terminology comprehensively, 
the following sections introduce you to some of the kinship basics.
Kinship deals with more than just close relatives; it also deals with many 
individuals, such as those in lineages (bloodlines) or descent groups, which 
are groups of individuals related by ancestry (for example, clans or tribes). 
Although functions vary, and not all of the following are true of all descent 
groups, common functions of descent groups (which overlap some functions 
of the family) include
 
 Justice administration: Entire descent groups may be insulted if one 
member is insulted, and justice is therefore often managed not between 
individuals of different descent groups, but between the entire groups.
 
 Management of property: In families, the communally owned property, 
including material items, spiritual resources (like access to certain ritual 

262
Par t III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
sites), and/or political resources are all managed by the descent group 
rather than by individuals or individual families.
 
 Identity: In some cultures, the descent group (not the family or even the 
individual) is the main unit of identity.
 
 Endorsement of marriage: In descent groups, the whole group must 
endorse marriages, not just the marrying couple themselves.

One way to keep track of what ancestry a person has is to consider whether 
descent groups trace their heritage through one or both of the parents. If a 
person’s descent is unilineal, he tracks his relations through either his moth-
er’s or father’s side (but not both). This practice is or was traditional in just 
over half of the world’s cultures, and was common in ancient Rome as well as 
the great 18th-century Ashanti kingdom of West Africa.
Cognatic descent is more flexible than unilineal descent because it allows 
people to track their relationships to the families of each parent. Slightly 
less than half the world’s peoples traditionally use or have used this system; 
although people in the U.S. typically use the last name of the male parent in 
naming (which seems to imply unilineal descent), they’re actually interested 
in (and make social and economic use of) the relations of both parents’ fami-
lies, so U.S. residents actually practice cognatic descent.

263
 Chapter 15: Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner? Identity, Family, Kinship, and Gender
In addition to keeping track of one, or both, sides of the parent generation, 
globally human cultures specify whether they will track identity through the 
male or female parental lines. Patrilineal ancestry focuses on the relatives of 
the male parent; this is the most common system worldwide, practiced by about 
60 percent of human cultures. Matrilineal ancestry focuses on the relatives of the 
female parent; this is less common than the patrilineal system and is prac-
ticed by only about 15 percent of the world’s cultures. Either of these track-
ing systems is an option for unilineal descent trackers; for cognatic trackers, 
the answer is ambilineal ancestry, which allows a person to track descent by 
either parent’s family.
 
Although matrilineality sounds as though it’s a situation in which females have 
more power than males, male domination of economic and social opportunities 
and actions within the family is pretty widespread even though possessions, 
rights, and so on are transmitted through the female line.
In the U.S. today, most people track descent cognatically and ambilineally, and in 
this way Americans have a lot in common with many cultures worldwide — their 
families are important to them. But due to a variety of social and economic 
factors, one topic Americans don’t spend too much time on is deciding which 
family to live with after marriage, which is a big issue in many nonindustrial 
societies. Patrilocal residence keeps the married couple close to the hus-
band’s father’s physical residence; matrilocal residence keeps them closer to 
the bride’s mother’s residence. Neolocal residence (practiced widely in the 
U.S. today) allows post-marriage residence away from both the brides’ and 
groom’s parental residences.
Squirming yet? Ethnocentrism and relativism
Reading about different types of marriage, 
sexual relations, and so on can be very uncom-
fortable because cultures are normally quite 
conservative; individuals tend to hold tightly to 
their core cultural values and normally consider 
those values to be the most reasonable option. 
This ethnocentrism isn’t just a Western issue — all 
cultures seem to believe that they have sorted 
out the world’s best and most appropriate ways 
to be human. Avoiding ethnocentrism doesn’t 
mean you should never judge anyone for any-
thing. Nobody said that every human adaptation 
is good for everyone in the culture; cultures have 
made marvelous things like art and myth that are 
universally loved, but they’ve also created ter-
rible institutions such as slavery that today are 
largely (if not universally) despised. Remember, 
ethnocentrism is common and leads to friction, 
but at the same time, a knee-jerk reaction of 
extreme cultural relativism in which you accept 
all cultural traits may well be amoral consider-
ing today’s global connections; for example, by 
allowing us to ignore clear violations of human 
rights, such as slavery.

Par t III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
Sex and Gender
Sex is a biological term referring to whether a person donates sperm or egg 
in the act of biological reproduction. Human males and females exhibit 
several main outward differences:
 
 Males are on average about 10 percent larger (in height or weight) than 
females.
 
 Females can breastfeed.
 
 Females have slightly wider hips and carry more fat on the body.
The possibility or likelihood of differences in male and female perception, 
ways of communicating, and skills (however defined) is so hot a topic that 
I’m not even going to touch it. Personally, I think anthropologists have good 
evolutionary reason to imagine that such differences could exist, but I’m not 
convinced that anyone has yet documented them in detail.
The differences between sex and gender
Although sex is a relatively straightforward matter of biology, gender can 
be very complicated. Before looking more carefully at what constitutes 
certain genders, keep in mind how important gender issues are in society. 
Worldwide, gender is assigned to individuals for several reasons:
 
 As part of a person’s core identity (informing expectations of self)
 
 To delineate social expectations
 
 To delineate economic and political expectations
Masculinity and femininity are important; every culture has some concept 
of gender ideology, or what’s appropriate male or female behavior, woven 
throughout its values and often its religious system. However, these ideologies 
differ from culture to culture. In some cultures (for example, Arabic culture), males 
are permitted and even expected to hold hands with their friends, whereas this 
action would be considered effeminate and suspicious in other cultures. Of course, 
sanctions for stepping out of approved gender boundaries can be severe, up to 
and including death.
And just as you can find variation in the appropriate gender expression per 
culture, there are also variations on how much a person can blur the lines 
between masculinity and femininity within a given culture. Italian culture 
today features a strong dash of bravado and machismo, but men are also 

265
 Chapter 15: Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner? Identity, Family, Kinship, and Gender
expected to be extremely deferential towards their mothers, in ways that 
many Italian women find overfeminine. Life is complicated!
The native peoples of North America have a long tradition of the berdache, 
the person who is biologically male but acts and dresses in ways normally 
reserved for women. Many anthropologists believe that although this 
practice has never been particularly common worldwide, such behavioral 
variation was more common before the 19th-century European coloniza-
tion of much of the rest of the world, when such behavior was so counter to 
Victorian ideals that it was largely and widely suppressed.
Common gender roles
Although the varying gender roles have changed through time, anthropologists 
have found several trends in gender roles worldwide. These trends are often 
related to the gender division of labor, which is more significant in nonin-
dustrial societies than in industrialized societies. (Non-industrial refers to 
traditional societies that aren’t deeply involved in the high-technology, mass-
productive, high-speed world of Western civilization; it’s not the best term, but 
it’s better than the archaic primitive.) Non-industrial societies often organize 
labor according to other factors (including age and social rank), but gender 
is often important as well. In non-industrial societies, male roles often include 
fighting/engagement in warfare, hunting and fishing, working with hard sub-
stances such as rock, and long-distance trade. Female roles typically include 
food preparation, domestic activities (maintenance of a home), child-rearing 
activities, and working with soft substances such as fabric
When social inequalities arise from gender differences, the society is prac-
ticing gender stratification. This occurs when certain kinds of activities are 
valued over others, such as hunting over child-rearing. Such evaluations 
may seem arbitrary from the outside, but each culture has a complex gender 
ideology serving as a foundation of the practice. Any attempt to change them 
would require careful work with the society in a way that recognizes the sig-
nificance of these roles to the culture practicing them.
The gendered division of labor is often more ideological than written in stone. 
In some societies, women participate in hunting, and in many cases males are 
engaged in child-rearing. Especially during times of stress, gender roles may be 
altered, such as they were in the United States during World War II, when women 
were suddenly welcomed into industrial labor that previously had been largely 
outside their typical gender expectations. Figure 15-2 shows how women were 
encouraged to do work that used to be more male-dominated without losing 
their identity as women; the definition of what it was to be a woman, what was 
considered appropriate for women to do, changed as a result of cultural change.

Kinship and Gender Worldwide 
and through Time
In Chapter 10, I outline the three main subsistence modes humanity has devised: 
foraging (hunting and gathering), horticulture (low-intensity growing of crops 
and raising animals), and agriculture (high-intensity crop-growing and animal 
husbandry). I also describe the distinctive social organization associated 
with each of these modes, and in each of these kinds of societies you can 
make some generalizations about how kinship and gender play out. The fol-
lowing sections outline the main trends.
Among foragers
Most foraging societies are small, apolitical bands or tribes that move across 
landscapes to take advantage of widely dispersed food sources; this mobil-
ity de-emphasizes concepts of ownership, material property, and even social 
ranking and also has affects kinship and gender.

267
 Chapter 15: Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner? Identity, Family, Kinship, and Gender
In many cases, foraging society kinship systems are largely based on the nuclear 
family or small groups of nuclear families called bands. Large descent groups, 
either matrilineal or patrilineal, can’t really form because populations are low 
and the amount of physical property to be handed from one generation to the 
next (a management task important in descent groups) is limited.
Although men and women do about the same amount of work in foraging 
societies, the societies often have strict concepts of men’s and women’s 
work. Where meat is a large part of the diet (as in the Arctic), men do more 
hunting; where plant food is a large part of the diet (as in the Congo), women 
do more foraging. Because foragers aren’t prone to warfare, males typically 
don’t serve as soldiers or warriors, though they may take up such roles for 
short times.
Foraging societies today and historically have some parallels with our prehis-
toric ancestors because all humans were foragers until the invention of hor-
ticulture and agriculture about 10,000 years ago. But there have been many 
ways to be a forager in the last few million years, and today’s foragers have 
undergone centuries of change since contact with Western civilization, so 
anthropologists are careful about equating them with some idea of the “origi-
nal” human society.
 
Like any anthropological category, the label “forager” masks a lot of variation. 
Many foragers are (and have been) small in population, and highly mobile, 
and practicing little in the way of social ranking, but in a few cases (as on the 
Pacific Northwest Coast of North America) traditional foraging societies were 
socially ranked, owned property, and were residentially sedentary (rather 
than highly mobile). Rather than think of these categories as unchanging abso-
lutes, you’re better off thinking about them as shades in a spectrum of social 
and subsistence modes.
Among horticulturalists
Horticulturalists typically appear as chiefdoms that practice low-intensity 
agriculture, farming small fields (or even garden-sized plots) and raising a 
small number of animals; these behaviors make them more sedentary than 
the highly mobile foragers, but they still do move, often cyclically from one 
farming patch to another on a three-or-four-year rotation. Because of their 
investment in these patches of land and the tools and facilities used to pro-
cess grown foods, horticulturalists have more physical material to pass down 
from one generation to the next than foragers do; social ranking is also pres-
ent, though not as pronounced as in civilization.
Horticultural society kinship systems are largely based on large, complex 
descent groups organized into clans or lineages that have elaborate traditions 

268
Par t III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
and histories that link them to important ancestral founding figures, such as 
the revered spirits of ancestors among natives of New Guinea Many are matri-
lineal (identify themselves with the mother’s side of the family), and they’re 
often exogamous (marry outside their bloodlines). Marriage ties are also more 
important than in foragers, again because of the need to carefully manage the 
transmission of rights and property from one generation to the next.
Although gender roles vary a great deal, in many cases women in horticul-
tural societies have relatively high status compared to other societies; this 
tendency is even more prominent in societies where families reside near the 
wife’s family.
Among agriculturalists
Ancient agriculturalists practiced high-intensity agriculture, farming large 
fields with intensive irrigation and using plows, and raising large numbers of 
animals. These behaviors made them very sedentary (often living near the 
bodies of their buried relatives) such that the concept of owning property 
is strong and deeply ingrained. Agricultural societies were strongly socially 
ranked, with a small, elite class ruling over many farming peasants.
Agricultural society kinship systems could also be based on large, complex 
descent groups, but because urbanism (cities) and specialized trades (such as 
baker or potter) were present, kin connections were sometimes de-emphasized 
in favor of labor-based social connections. Most of these societies are 
patrilineal; in fact, males are often dominant in nearly every aspect of life, at 
least on the surface. However, women in such arrangements can hold consid-
erable power to influence the husband (for example, economically), and this 
point shouldn’t be overlooked. Although gender roles varied enormously, in 
many cases women focused on domestic work away from the public sphere, 
which (along with long-distance trade) was the domain of men. In ancient 
Egypt, for example, males were much more likely to become scribes, where 
women were more likely to remain child-rearers, or workers in the home. Men 
also often engaged in warfare, in many cases as full-time soldiers.
Keep in mind that in all these cases, the various gender roles, kinship rules, 
and subsistence modes were complexly intertwined; try to tweak one factor, 
and others would be affected. And in most cases, these behaviors were some-
how adaptive in that they promoted survival. Now, not all adaptations are 
good — cultures also have maladaptations that area actually bad for at least 
some of the members of society — and you can always ask yourself who’s 
benefitting from a particular arrangement Sometimes, the answer is “every-
one,” but other times things might not be so magnanimous.

orldwide, humans have various religious and political views. Strike 
religion against politics, and the sparks can really fly; few things are 
as volatile as the friction between religious or political ideas. Why is this? 
And why does such a diversity of beliefs exist in the first place?
In this chapter I explain just what politics and religions are — as anthro-
pologists understand them — and how anthropologists study them to get 
at human universals as well as diversity. I also examine, essentially, what 
anthropologists have discovered about these fields, and what that means for 
being human.

Par t III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
What Is Religion?
As in many other facets of the human experience, religions are so different 
worldwide that religion as a whole can be hard to define. At the very least, any 
given religion is a set of beliefs and instructions regarding the supernatural, a 
realm thought to exist beyond the material, concrete realm of daily life. Most 
anthropologists would agree that all religious systems describe
 
 The supernatural world and its inhabitants: Most cultures have a belief 
in some kind of supernatural world beyond the material one.
 
 How to properly revere and/or interact with the supernatural world 
and its inhabitants: The supernatural world is complex and needs to be 
properly addressed (sometimes to improve life and conditions here in 
the material world).
 
 What’s proper behavior for life in the material world and the soul’s 
fate after death: Most cultures have some concept of a human energy or 
soul persisting after the death of the physical body.
Religions, then, at the least, are instruction manuals for what the supernatu-
ral world is like and what to do about it. This phrasing is very similar to the 
definition I give for culture in Chapter 11; as a subset of cultural information, 
religion is the system of beliefs and instructions about the supernatural part 
of the human experience. 
Functions of religion
Anthropologists have suggested many reasons for the functions of religion in 
human cultures:
 
 Religions provide explanations for the unknown; religious myths name 
and discuss the unknown, which then makes it at least seem knowable.
 
 Religions reinforce social unity, reminding people of their cultural com-
monalities rather than their differences.
 
 Religions provide psychological comfort by offering consolation for 
injustice, harm, and death.
 
 Religions provide bedrock principles for life, which give followers 
security in a world of change.
 
 Religions provide guidance through the stages of life, reinforcing culturally 
appropriate changes with baptisms, marriages, and funerals and spirit-
assistance sanctified by religious specialists, such as priests.
Religions are significant social institutions that provide guides to a lot of 
behavior. They often describe the reasons for taboos, important social 
restrictions against things such as incest or blasphemy.

271
 Chapter 16: Not at the Dinner Table! Religion and Politics
Religious concepts intertwine with other aspects of human life: In the United 
States, a person may pray to a deity when going to war, or swear an oath on a 
religious text when in a court of law. This infusion of religious concepts with 
the rest of society — even in a culture, like that of the United States, which 
explicitly professes the separation of church and state — shows just how 
deeply structuring religious ideas really are for most cultures.
One reason the study of religion is so important in anthropology is that reli-
gious belief systems have been a central aspect of life for most of the world’s 
people throughout history. The spread of atheism (active disbelief in a higher 
power) and agnosticism (belief that a higher power may or may not exist) is a 
relatively new development; for much of history, religious belief systems are 
where people past and present have gotten their basic concepts of right and 
wrong, sin and good deeds, death and life, and so on.
Ideas about right and wrong can come from many sources, such as non-
religious philosophy. But for most of history and even today, they don’t. 
Religions have established such a monopoly on defining right and wrong, for 
example, that my own city’s main newspaper (The Oregonian) has a section 
called “Religion and Ethics.” But any good philosopher can go on for hours 
(or days or whole careers) about morality and ethics without ever invoking 
religious reasons for certain positions. These discussions of moral philosophy 
deal with ethics without bringing religion into it. For example, primatologists 
have studied social rule systems in nonhuman primates, where systems of 
moral behavior exist independent of religious beliefs.
Why religion is so powerful
So where do religious systems of belief get their power? Why does every 
culture have at least one, and why do people believe them so fervently that 
many are ready and quite willing to kill and die and for them?
The answer of a participant in one of the religions would be that the particu-
lar religion is so important, compelling, and powerful because it’s right; it 
derives from the divine and inerrant words of the higher power, so it must be 
valuable and true.
The scientific perspective suggested by late, great anthropologist Roy 
Rappaport is that the power of religious systems is found in their self-
reinforcement. That is, religions gain their strength and authority through 
the repetition of religious rituals designed to remind participants of ultimate 
sacred postulates, which are a set of core beliefs about the nature of the 
universe and human existence. Although the exact contents of each set of 
ultimate sacred postulates differ in each religion, they’re all said to be self-
evident, inerrant truths that are so scared they must not be questioned; 
they’re foundations of entire religious belief systems.

272
Par t III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
Ultimate sacred postulates can be found in the Muslim’s statement “There 
is no god (ilah) but God (Allah), and Muhammad is His prophet” and the 
Christian prayer, “I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and 
earth. I believe in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord. I believe in 
the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, 
the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.”
In many cultures, religious belief systems are so complex that they require 
full-time specialists — priests of one kind or another — to handle the vari-
ous rituals and ceremonies used to reiterate the ultimate sacred postulates. 
In this way, these religious specialists are the mediators between the mate-
rial world — in which the human experience is lived — and the supernatural 
world. I look at these concepts a little more closely in the next section.
The Material and Supernatural Worlds
Every human has a physical body and material needs that they feed through 
material means like water, food, nutrients, and shelter. I call this world of 
physical, mundane objects the material world. All humans exist in the mate-
rial world; even the most devout monk or yogi has to drink and eat.
At the same time, though, anthropologists have found that all human cultures 
have some concept of the supernatural, a word referring to a universe of real 
things beyond the material. In Western civilization, the word supernatural 
indicates beings, processes, and circumstances in the supernatural world 
that can’t be explained by the natural sciences. Because I’m writing this book 
from the basic perspective of Western science, I’m comfortable saying that 
a material world exists and that at the same time, many cultures worldwide 
have strong beliefs about a realm or beings, powers, and circumstances 
beyond this physical realm. It’s this beyond that I refer to as the supernatural 
or ethereal world.
This topic can get pretty sticky when you consider that some cultures don’t 
subscribe to the notions of Western science; is their supernatural actually 
their natural? To some extent, any definition of supernatural is relative, but 
for the purposes of this book I’m using the definition laid out in the preceding 
paragraphs.
 
The anthropological division of the human experience into what I call mate-
rial and supernatural realms isn’t particularly new. In 1912, Emile Durkheim, a 
prominent French sociologist of religion, wrote that all religious beliefs exhibited 
a common distinction between real and ideal things into classes he called the 
profane (material) and sacred (ethereal). I (and many anthropologists) believe 
Durkheim was right about some of this stuff, but in this book I’m using my own 
terms to avoid being lumped in with all of his views.

273
 Chapter 16: Not at the Dinner Table! Religion and Politics
Now because all cultures and their members live in the material world but 
also have some concepts of the ethereal world, all humans live in a state of 
overlap between the two. Figure 16-1 illustrates that access to the ethereal 
often occurs through mediators, such as shamans or priests, who specialize 
in religious knowledge.

The overlap itself isn’t specifically so important — that’s just a reality of life. 
More important is understanding that this position of life between these 
realms is central to many human lives. More than sheer economics or poli-
tics or even biology (though each of these is important), the ultimate sacred 
postulates encoded in a culture’s religion motivate everything from suicide 
bombings to acts of nonviolence.
Ritual and Religion
A religion’s ultimate sacred postulates have to be communicated to the mem-
bers of a culture — they don’t get transmitted through DNA any more than 
culture does. (See Chapter 11 for more on the transmission of culture.) This 
communication often occurs in ceremonies or rituals.
I think the most important definition of ritual comes courtesy of anthropolo-
gist Roy Rappaport, who wrote that ritual is the performance of relatively 
invariant, traditionally defined acts and utterances; one example is the cer-
emony of First Holy Communion in the Christian tradition.

274
Par t III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
This definition may seem pretty vague; like many human behaviors ritual varies 
enormously worldwide. But the following important commonalities show just 
how important religious ritual is and reinforce Rappaport’s definition:
 
 Ritual briefly transports people a little closer to the ethereal or supernatural 
world, reminding them of their ultimate sacred postulates; it reforges ties 
they may forget in the rush of daily life here in the material world.
 
 Ritual reminds people of their common religious and social values.
 
 Ritual normally takes place at special places and times, such that the 
presentations of the ultimate sacred postulates are remembered as spe-
cial events (for example, church on Sunday).
 
 Ritual doesn’t normally present new information but rather reiterates 
the ultimate sacred postulates (for example, the Lord’s Prayer).
 
Not all ritual is religious, but a lot is, and a lot of nonreligious ritual — such 
as swearing in an American president — still incorporates religious elements, 
such as swearing on the Bible.
Ritual can also be used to try to manipulate forces or plead to beings in the 
supernatural or ethereal realm. For example, Aztec priests ritually sacrificed 
human beings to satisfy various gods. The priests thought this ritual would 
bring about better conditions for farming because the gods (in the super-
natural realm) supposedly controlled rain and other variables important to 
agriculture (in the material realm). Many in Western civilization today ask God — 
through prayer — to assist in everything from daily life to victory in battle . . . just 
as humans have appealed to the supernatural for thousands of years.
Religious ritual often includes magic, an attempt to control some aspect of the 
supernatural. Magic is normally carried out by religious specialists equipped 
with special objects, and magic rituals often involve specific sequences of 
events (such as chants, bodily postures, and so on) called magical formulae. 
Knowledge of magical formulae is normally secretive, and can include things 
as diverse as appropriate drumming techniques or the use of hallucinogenic 
substances; long periods of apprenticeship may be necessary to learn them.
Regardless of whether a person believes in what a religion states, the anthro-
pological study of religion has shown that religion is so important because it 
drives (to a variable degree) a lot of human behavior.
 
When I say that religious systems are important or significant to human cultures, 
I’m not saying that they’re necessary or that any one of them is correct. I’m 
simply saying that as things stand today, which is how they have for a long 
time, religion is a significant factor of human life. Which religion to follow — if 
any — is (in Western societies, anyway) largely a person’s own choice. I’m 
selling no particular soap here!

 Chapter 16: Not at the Dinner Table! Religion and Politics
The Organization of Supernatural 
Knowledge
The specific content of a given religion is normally complex and detailed; as 
human societies become more populous and complex, sometimes religion also 
becomes more complex. The supernatural beings of religious systems include 
gods (powerful, immortal beings responsible for creation and destruction) and 
spirits (lesser supernatural beings including deceased ancestors, personal 
guardians, and mischievous — and sometimes friendly — ghosts).
Polytheistic religions have multiple gods and goddesses; people in ancient 
Egypt worshiped nearly 100 main deities, and Hinduism features thousands 
of deities. Monotheistic religions tend to have one major god (as in the 
Christian tradition), but also contain other supernatural beings (such as 
angels and the devil).
Supernatural religious knowledge is often handled by religious specialists, 
people in a given culture who act as repositories of supernatural knowledge 
and are capable of using it effectively in ritual. Religious specialists include 
two main types: shamans and priests.
Shamans
A shaman is a person who is charged with much special supernatural knowl-
edge and the know-how to use it to create lasting effects in the material 
world. Shamanism is typically found in cultures with relatively low popula-
tions and less-institutionalized religious systems, like small-scale foraging or 
simple farming societies. Shamans are often outsiders. They’re feared as well 
as respected, and they often live on the margins of society because of their 
potentially dangerous proximity to the powerful forces of the supernatural 
realm. Shamans have at least two important roles that recur worldwide. One 
is that they facilitate physical healing; health problems in the material realm 
are often thought to originate in the ethereal or supernatural realm, and 
shamans often are called on to mediate with spirits to solve such problems. 
They also deal with spiritual healing. What Westerners may call psychologi-
cal issues are often considered spiritual problems in shamanic societies. 
Shamans often undertake perilous, ritually marked journeys to the supernatu-
ral realm to intervene.
 
A shaman can be male or female; the word shaman derives from a Tungus 
(native Russian) word used to designate Tungus ritual-religious specialists, 
but the word is now used for any such specialist. People with shamanic roles 
are found worldwide.

276
Par t III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
Shamanic rituals often involve the shaman entering a state of altered con-
sciousness, or a trance state. This state can be accomplished in many ways, 
such as with repetitive chanting, drumming, self-deprivation of food or water, 
or the use of hallucinogenic substances such as the fly agaric mushroom in 
Siberia and North America, peyote (a cactus found mainly in Mexico), and 
ayahuasca (a visionary tea brewed by shamans in South America). In the 
trance state, the shaman is transported to the spiritual realm; on coming out 
of the trance, the shaman is returned to the material realm.
 
Shamanism isn’t a religion itself; it’s more of a technique for influencing the 
supernatural world to have effects in the material world.

and holds a drum used in his healing ceremonies.

Priests
A priest also possesses special supernatural knowledge, but a priest normally 
has less direct access to the supernatural world than a shaman does. 

277
 Chapter 16: Not at the Dinner Table! Religion and Politics
Additionally, they serve more as conduits or guides to the supernatural 
instead of directly contacting or influencing it. Priests are more common in 
cultures with relatively large populations and institutionalized religious systems, 
such as large-scale agricultural societies (but more on that a bit later). Priests 
come in different forms (such as Christian ministers, Jewish rabbis, or Muslim 
imams), but their functions as part of the religious system are normally roughly 
the same. Two common services priests provide are giving official blessings to 
social events such as marriage (and one Russian Orthodox priest blessed a new 
missile system) and offering guidance to the supernatural ramifications or ori-
gins of problems.
Priests often carry out complex religious rituals involving special material 
objects and substances, like the wine and wafer in Christian communion or 
the obsidian blades in Aztec sacrifice. What’s important to remember here is 
that these religious specialists are necessary for the maintenance and proper 
carrying out of the religious system; if the priestly classes aren’t supported, 
the religion may crumble.
Priests are typical of large institutionalized religions — official religions of cer-
tain political units, such as states or civilizations — that they sustain through 
delivering the ultimate sacred postulates to the lay public. Although not all 
civilizations or states today have official religions, the ancient civilizations 
normally had very strict rules as to what religions citizens could practice. In 
Aztec civilization, for example, police would patrol the suburbs on important 
ritual days to ensure that everyone was attending the state-sponsored reli-
gious activities.
Institutionalized religions are normally complex and arranged hierarchically. 
For example, consider the modern Roman Catholic Church, which employs 
thousands of people worldwide. Its religious specialists are hierarchically 
arranged to most effectively communicate the religion’s ultimate sacred pos-
tulates. The ranks include
 
 The pope, an official who orchestrates structural changes in the church 
and has the most direct access to the supernatural (God)
 
 Archbishops, 45 of whom oversee and govern the activities of the 
church in the United States
 
 Priests, who most directly communicate the ultimate sacred postulates 
to the lay public by performing rituals
The Origins of Religion
Where did these ideas of the supernatural world come from in the first place? 
Again, these questions can have emic or etic answers.

278
Par t III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
The emic perspective (which considers the supernatural to be a real realm) 
is that the ideas about the supernatural world came from the gods and god-
desses themselves, either directly or sometimes through mediums such as 
prophets. For these billions of folks, the supernatural world that Western 
science would call unprovable or not demonstrable is as real as the book in 
your hands.
The etic, anthropological perspective (though some anthropologists have 
religious convictions of their own) is that the supernatural was essentially 
invented by humanity. Why would humanity create these religious, some of 
which are unfathomably complex to all but the most learned, and some of 
which have guided humanity through one war after another?
In the past century, anthropologists have proposed many reasons for the 
invention of religion. The possible origins of religion have been arranged into 
several main types:
 
 Explanatory/rationalizing origins: Religion was invented to account for 
the unknown, to explain the inexplicable, to account for the unaccountable, 
to give order to a world that can be disorderly, and/or to account for order 
that seemed to have been created by something far more powerful than 
humanity.
Lucretius on the invention of religion
One of the first recorded statements that the 
gods were invented by humans (rather than 
the other way around) appears in the writings 
of Lucretius, a first-century BC Roman phi-
losopher. In his fascinating treatise De Rerum 
Natura (sometimes translated as On the Nature 
of the Universe), Lucretius suggested that 
humanity had invented gods and religion first to 
account for their dreams and then to account 
for some of the (then) mysteries of the natural 
world. The following excerpt was translated by 
R.E. Latham and published in 1951, but the ideas 
are more than 2,000 years old:
“Let us now consider why reverence for the 
gods is widespread. . . . The explanation is not 
far to seek. Already in those early days men 
had visions when their minds were awake, and 
more clearly in sleep, of divine figures. . . . To 
these figures they attributed feeling . . . . cred-
ited them with eternal life . . . . pictured their lot 
as far superior to that of mortals . . . because 
in dreams they saw them perform all sorts of 
miracles without the slightest effort.”
“[M]en noticed the orderly succession of celes-
tial phenomena and the round of the seasons 
and were at a loss to account for them. So they 
took refuge in handing over everything to the 
gods and making everything dependent on their 
whim. They chose the sky to be the home and 
headquarters of the gods . . . . What griefs they 
hatched then for themselves . . . . This is not 
piety, this oft-repeated show of bowing a veiled 
head before a stone . . . this deluging of altars 
with the blood of beasts; this heaping of vow 
upon vow. True piety lies rather in the power to 
contemplate the universe with a quiet mind.”

279
 Chapter 16: Not at the Dinner Table! Religion and Politics
 
 Self-actualizing origins: Religion was invented as a system of beliefs that 
gave shape to human culture and could maintain that shape through 
time. This idea is exemplified by Emile Durkheim’s statement that “reli-
gion is society worshipping itself;” and although prereligious cultures 
certainly had shape and could survive, religion was a further adaptation, 
a new way of making human cultures function more efficiently.
 
 Social control origins: Religion was invented as a way to better control 
human behavior. A fascinating twist on this old idea is Rappaport’s 
concept that the rituals and restrictions of religion were invented to 
dampen out the potential for social chaos presented by the rise of human 
language, which can be used to create new thoughts and interpretations 
that challenge social harmony.
So far, none of these models has completely swept the anthropological com-
munity. Some of the factors in each model may have contributed to the evo-
lution of the first religion; other religions were affected by all three factors 
in varying degrees. Right now, anthropologists just don’t know how the first 
religion originated.
 
Just because anthropologists don’t know something at the moment doesn’t nec-
essarily mean they can’t know it. Many things take a lot of time to understand.
What does archaeology say about the origins of religion? More these days 
than in the past century, but still not much. More than likely, early peoples 
exercised religious thoughts without using a lot of artifacts; without artifacts, 
archaeologists will be hard-pressed to find traces of early religions.
 
Still, some new approaches to cave art have been interesting. Many archae-
ologists are now convinced that cave art (images in European caves, dating 
to over 40,000 years ago) are depictions of shamanic rituals — specifically, 
shamanic voyages to the supernatural world, where they encounter animals 
and beings not found in the material world. Though this argument hasn’t been 
completely developed, some of the evidence for this interpretation is pretty 
compelling.
Archaeologically, the first unambiguous evidence of religious systems is the 
temples of the ancient civilization of Sumer, dated to just over 6,000 years 
ago; and since then (as you can read in Chapter 10) large, organized state 
religions have flourished more or less worldwide. Some kinds of religion must 
have served as foundations for these institutionalized state religions, but 
right now archaeological evidence for them is pretty thin on the ground.

280
Par t III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
Types of Religions
As with many aspects of human life, religions vary a lot worldwide, but they 
can be classified into various types. One influential classification of world 
religions (published by Anthony F.C. Wallace) recognizes four main types, 
based on their relative complexity:
 
 Shamanic religions allow people to have direct, unscheduled contact 
with their supernatural world; sometimes they’re assisted by a shaman 
who may work magic for various purposes, and sometimes they’re 
assisted by a lifelong guardian spirit. Shamanic religion is most com-
monly practiced by the most mobile of human societies.
 
 Examples of shamanic religions include those of the native peoples of 
the Arctic, including the Canadian Inuit and the peoples of Arctic Siberia. 
These folk have a strong tradition of powerful shamans, and their world 
is animistic, populated by supernatural beings that inhabit both animate 
(living) and inanimate (nonliving) objects. They have no real supreme 
god, although some deities are more powerful than others; among the 
Canadian Inuit, for example, Sedna, the keeper of the sea animals (seals, 
whales, and others that are very important to Inuit subsistence) is par-
ticularly important.
 
 Communal religions feature regular rituals carried out in special places 
and at special times to give members access to a supernatural world 
populated by many gods and goddesses. Followers continually use 
magic to assist in any activity that involves risk, and although magic 
may be performed by religious specialists such as shamans, community 
members themselves carry out many religious tasks. This religion is 
associated with slightly less-mobile societies, including horticultural 
societies that practice low-intensity farming. Communal religion is or 
was practiced by many groups including most Native Americans, many 
Africans, and the peoples of Australia and Oceania (the Pacific islands).
 
 Olympian religions have a very complex supernatural world accessed 
largely by religious specialists such as diviners (people who attempt to 
predict the future). Numerous subdivisions of the religious system can 
include ancestor cults (focusing on the worship of ancestor spirits) and 
great god cults (focusing on the worship of specific principal deities).
 
 An Olympian religion was practiced by the traditional agricultural chief-
doms of Dahomey, West Africa, a society with higher population and 
less mobility than the polar Inuit or the native Australians. In Dahomey, 
elaborate ceremonies carried out by nearly full-time religious specialists 
venerated the ancestor spirits of the living and made sacrifices to the 
great gods. As in the religions of ancient Greece, Egypt, and Babylon, 
Dahomey had a complex pantheon of many gods.

281
 Chapter 16: Not at the Dinner Table! Religion and Politics
 
 Monotheistic or ecclesiastic religions are those in which a single 
supreme god is venerated above all else (though other supernatural 
beings, such as angels, may exist). These religions support a hierarchy 
of full-time religious specialists who have the most continual and richest 
communication with the supernatural world.
 
 Monotheistic or ecclesiastic religions include the Judeo-Christian and 
Islamic traditions, each of which venerates a single, ultimate God and 
are organized as complex churches staffed by career religious-knowledge 
specialists who have high social status. The lay public, though they take 
regular part in religious ritual, have less direct access to the supernatu-
ral realm than in other types of religion and look to the clergy to inter-
pret that realm.

The Relations of Power: Politics
Although many believe that in some distant past, humans lived in social har-
mony, archaeology and anthropology indicate that this is a myth. Even the 
chimpanzees, our closest relatives in the animal kingdom, maintain strict 
social hierarchies in which social power isn’t equally distributed but rather 
held by individuals until . . . well, until they lose that power and status, often 
by losing a physical challenge issued by another chimpanzee.

282
Par t III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
In the human world, power is the ability to constrain the options of or impose 
will on others. The constraints and impositions can be material, as when food 
is withheld from a population, or social, as when a powerful group refuses 
to recognize the legitimacy of a less-powerful group. The following section 
delves into the acquisition and exertion of power.
I’ve got the power (and 
I know how to use it)
Anthropologists studying power relations have identified two main ways that 
power is acquired by individuals and organizations. One is by force, or the use 
or threat of violence to achieve power (such as invasion of one group’s terri-
tory by another). The other is by authority, or the use of socially recognized 
status to achieve power (such as movement of a governmental official up 
through the ranks of the political system).
 
When most Americans hear the word politics, they think of the Republican 
or Democratic parties— but I’m not touching these with a ten-foot boathook! 
Anthropologically, politics simply refers to the relations of power in a culture 
and how these relations affect decision-making.
An important aspect of power in human culture is social status, a person’s 
rank as measured by prestige in the culture. In some cases social status is 
achieved by an individual’s deeds in the course of life. In other cases, it’s 
ascribed at birth, such as when one is born into a royal family, for example, or 
a lower caste (a term some cultures give social statuses).
Anthropologists have also identified some main ways that the powerful wield 
their power:
 
 Leadership selection: How power is transferred among individuals — 
for example, via elections placing leaders into positions versus leaders 
being born into positions of power
 
 Regulation of social behavior: The use of communal power to maintain 
social cohesion through social customs, prohibitions, and norms versus 
the use of institutionalized power through laws
 
 Conflict resolution: The use of power to resolve differences
 
 Relations with neighbors: The use and negotiation of power in dealing 
with neighbors, be they ally, enemy, or neutral

283
 Chapter 16: Not at the Dinner Table! Religion and Politics
Power plays: How various 
societies apply power
Anthropologists have also spent a lot of effort identifying the main kinds of 
political systems worldwide and through time. Although anthropologists 
always debate about exactly how to define the main kinds of political organi-
zation, most would agree on the four main kinds I summarize in the following 
sections. For more on the basic characteristics of these societies, head to 
Chapter 10. To read more about small- and large-scale societies’ approaches 
to conflict, check out Chapter 17.
Bands
The key political characteristic of bands is their egalitarian character, in 
which power is distributed rather than concentrated. But remember, bands 
members have to work at this arrangement because individuals sometimes 
try to build social power by bragging about their hunting prowess or some 
other attribute; in fact, bands typically handle justice through social channels 
rather than formal codes of law. Therefore, they often squash such attempts 
at self-aggrandizement with ridicule. One native hunter of southern Greenland 
who attempted to lord over his fellows on the strength of his great hunting 
abilities was given the derogatory name “Dog Diarrhea” to cool his heels.
Tribes
Politically speaking, tribes (often consisting of loosely allied bands) are also 
typically egalitarian, although they allow a bit more leeway for the accumu-
lation of power by individuals. They follow a somewhat more formal law 
system than bands do, but this system is still pretty simple. The main politi-
cal characteristic of tribes is that their slightly larger and more sedentary 
populations have more complex political interactions — internally and with 
their neighbors — than those of bands. Whereas bands may have headmen 
who wield a limited amount of power, tribes can have more powerful chiefs. 
But tribal chiefs can only exert their will so far, and they aren’t as powerful as 
they are in chiefdoms.
Chiefdoms
Politically, chiefdoms are normally ranked societies; although all members 
normally have equal access to material resources (such as food), access to 
social resources such as high social rank is limited. These societies have clear 
social ranks, different levels of prestige in the society. Because of these ranks, 
the key political characteristic of chiefdoms is that power is concentrated 
in the hands of certain members, often elites, who are born into positions 
of power, simply by being members of a ruling family. Chiefs, who could 
be male or female — female chiefs were common in Southeastern Alaska 

284
Par t III: Cultural Anthropology and Linguistics 
in the 19th century — had considerable power to coerce or influence their 
constituent populations. However, they had direct, violent power of life or 
death over slaves only. They didn’t have such power over commoners; in 
fact, they couldn’t even prevent commoners from moving away, an important 
distinction from states. Finally, note that a chiefdom’s concentrated power 
structure supports a much more complex, formal legal system than bands or 
tribes operate.
States
The most important political characteristic of a state (also called a civilization) 
is that it’s typically a class society, meaning it doesn’t guarantee all members 
equal access to social and material resources. In other words, states concen-
trate power in certain hands and not others. Individuals are often born into 
classes that may be difficult to migrate out of. States have far-ranging political 
dealings, and they often express their power through a military composed of 
full-time military specialists including soldiers and officers. States are large and 
tend to dominate and assimilate surrounding political units of lesser power. 
Whereas the most important personal and economic bonds in bands, tribes 
and chiefdoms center on kinship (family connections), states emphasize pro-
fessional and trade connections.
 
Although in some parts of the world bands have taken up farming and become 
chiefdoms (and then states), that’s not an inevitable course for all human societ-
ies. States depend on agriculture to support a high population density, which 
just isn’t possible in places like the Arctic or much of Australia. For more on the 
evolution of human political systems through time, have a look at Chapter 10.

T
he study of humanity is fascinating, but it isn’t con-

anthropology are useful in your daily life; in this part, I 
show you how you can apply anthropological concepts 
to modern problems like climate change and cultural 
conflict.

Kiss or Kill? Diversity, 
Conflict, and Culture
In This Chapter
 Understanding what cultural conflict really is
 Comprehending the anthropological approach to conflict resolution
 Discovering how cultural anthropology can help solve local ethnic conflicts
 Finding out how cultural anthropology can help solve conflicts worldwide
L
ike any social animal, humans have conflict. But alone in the animal king-
dom, humans have very distinctive cultural identities, each with its own 
set of ideas of what’s appropriate in the world. When these different ideas 
come into contact (or even have interior disputes), humans are capable of 
dragging conflicts out into feuds, military strikes, and wars that kill millions.
In this chapter I discuss the long history of human conflict and how anthro-
pology addresses the questions of diversity and conflict. You also see how 
anthropology can help solve problems of cultural conflict worldwide, an 
important point considering that globalization and mass, rapid communica-
tions make the world smaller every day by bringing all humans into closer 
and more frequent contact.
The Anthropology of Conflict 
and Conflict Resolution
By definition, social animals — including humans — live in communities. This 
arrangement brings individuals into close contact, and that can cause friction — 
for example, when two individuals want the same thing. For anthropologists, 
conflict occurs when negotiation fails to resolve differences between people 
or groups of people. Although most animals limit conflict to short episodes 

288
Par t IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
related to competition for mates or basic resources such as food and water, 
humans seem to have more (and more extensive) conflicts over a wide vari-
ety of cultural issues.
One of the goals of anthropology — and therefore a central message of this 
whole book — has been to combat, at least in modern civilization, the uni-
versal habit of ethnocentrism, judging other cultures by one’s own standards. 
Most often, anthropologists combat ethnocentrism by promoting relativism 
in everything they write, including communications with the nonacademic 
world.
 
Cultural relativism is the anthropological perspective that sees each culture as 
being morally independent, not subject to moral judgment by others. Though 
this practice is useful in many ways, it can cause moral difficulties because, as 
anthropologist Conrad Kottak has pointed out, it would place Nazi Germany 
on the same moral level as Athenian Greece.
Considering how hard getting along with others can be, in some ways it’s 
amazing the world isn’t completely consumed in war. Of course, war is 
expensive in terms of lives and money, so for most cultures it’s a later rather 
than earlier response to cultural friction. Table 17-1 shows American war 
deaths in many major conflicts over the years. The United States has been 
engaged in some kind of conflict quite a bit since 1775.

 Chapter 17: Kiss or Kill? Diversity, Conflict, and Culture
So, how does peaceful conflict resolution work? Anthropologists have identi-
fied that worldwide, one of the first resorts is normally some kind of nego-
tiation, which is nonviolent resolution of differences, otherwise known as a 
settlement. Negotiation actually attempts to avoid conflict in the first place, 
so technically speaking it comes before conflict. To achieve settlements, 
humans must practice some degree of relativism even if the other side’s 
point of view isn’t precisely aligned with their own interests.
Negotiations aren’t the only way to resolve conflict, however. Carol and 
Melvin Ember, two prominent conflict anthropologists, have identified the 
following peaceful means of conflict resolution (see the list that follows). 
Understanding these methods helps anthropologists advise governmental 
agencies on how to deal with conflict in many situations:
 
 Avoidance: Parties experiencing conflict move apart; the move may 
be literal, and in small-scale societies — such as the Inuit foragers of the 
Arctic — families may simply pack up and leave a village to avoid conflict 
for a time.
 
 Social sanction: A society uses any of a wide variety of social means 
to prevent conflict; these methods include ridicule of individuals who 
attempt to impose their will on others in the group.
 
 Mediation: A neutral mediator may come in to assist in negotiations.
 
 Ritual: Rituals may invoke the culture’s spiritual resources and/or 
guides (gods) to sanctify any resolutions to conflict; because the sanc-
tification is by definition very important, the parties are less likely to 
violate it.
 
 Law and courts: These formal systems of conflict resolution have the 
authority to enforce their rulings.
 
 Post-conflict reconciliation: Though it doesn’t strictly prevent conflict, 
post-conflict reconciliation — in which the conflicting parties interact 
peacefully — decreases the likelihood of further conflict in some cases.
 
Post-conflict reconciliation is common in nonhuman primates; for example, a 
baboon that has attacked another often signals peaceful intentions after the 
conflict by gentle grunting and sitting quietly with the victim.
Unfortunately, when negotiation fails, conflict begins; the following section 
presents some principles of the anthropology of conflict.
Scales and consequences of conflict
Although human conflict comes in many forms, important basic scales and 
consequences exist in most human conflicts. In any given conflict, you need 
to understand how each of these factors is playing out to better devise a 

290
Par t IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
solution, and this is precisely what people trained in cultural anthropology 
do when helping governmental agencies avoid or deal with conflict.
Many anthropologists recognize the following common scales of conflict:
 
 Intrafamily conflict: Personal conflict in a family unit, including parent-
offspring and spousal conflicts; in the U.S., these range from strife over 
what music teens are allowed to listen to (are the lyrics appropriate or 
offensive?) to friction between in-laws at Thanksgiving dinner.
 
 Intracommunity conflict: Conflict between descent groups or families 
within a community; one example would be when some families support 
a local economic change (such as a building a new mega-supermarket), 
and others (who may in this case own small mom and pop stores) 
oppose such a change.
 
 Intercommunity conflict: Large-scale conflict between communities 
within a culture; think about the conflicts between different racial com-
munities in the U.S. today or between Catholic and Protestant communi-
ties of Northern Ireland in the not-so-distant past.
 
 Intercultural conflict: Conflict between different cultures; consider 
major wars fought over religion, such as the 14th-century Crusades in 
which Christians battled adherents of Islam.
Anthropologists have also noted that conflict beyond the intrafamily level 
involves groups of people rather than just individuals. At first these groups 
may share many values, but as conflict increases, groups differ more with 
time, showing
 
 An increase in group solidarity: Social bonds within each competing 
group become tighter, and pre-existing tensions within each competing 
group may be put aside, at least temporarily.
 
 An increase in stereotyping: Group members increasingly objectify 
opposition groups, often with dehumanizing language that clearly marks 
the opposition as “Other.”
 
 An increase in groupthink: Groupthink is an interesting phenomenon 
that suppresses individuality (implicitly and/or explicitly) and promotes 
using a rigid and uncompromising way of thinking (defined by the conflict 
group) for all decision-making. Some characteristics of groupthink include 
increased use of bumper-sticker-type slogans and unrealistic optimism that 
things will work out preferably, as well as a decrease in rational thinking, 
demand for evidence, and personal moral accountability.
Knowing that human conflict normally involves these elements, anthropolo-
gists have better equipped themselves to understand conflict. The following 
section details what they’ve discovered.

 Chapter 17: Kiss or Kill? Diversity, Conflict, and Culture
Cultural conflict among 
small-scale societies
Many have suggested that if humans had remained mobile foragers, they 
never would’ve experienced the horrors of war. Although warfare waged 
by civilizations normally lasts longer and takes place on a larger scale than 
warfare among people living in smaller societies, small-scale societies aren’t 
always peaceful. In fact, archaeologists have evidence for interpersonal vio-
lence going well back into the Stone Age:
 
 A 7,700-year-old site in Germany once occupied by hunter–gatherers has 
yielded 38 skulls bearing distinctive execution-style crushing to the back 
of the head.
 
 Throughout the Neolithic period in Mediterranean Europe, an increasing 
number of males show evidence of interpersonal violence. One archae-
ologist interpreted this pattern not as an increase in violence but as an 
increase in the cultural assignment of males to violent roles.
 
 The 9,400-year-old Kennewick man skeleton found in Washington State 
has a stone point imbedded in his hip, as though he’d been shot from 
behind (a good indicator of interpersonal violence). See Chapter 8 for 
more on the Kennewick man.
 
Although many Homo erectus bodies show evidence of butchery (such as at Bodo, 
Ethiopia, where 600,000-year-old skeletal material bears distinctive cut-marks 
from butchery with stone tools), this doesn’t necessarily indicate violence. 
The hominid may have died naturally.
There are plenty of other indications of interpersonal violence in ancient and 
small-scale societies. What makes this conflict different from conflict as you 
know it today? The answer is largely a matter of scale, both in time and space. If 
not solved by the nonviolent means noted earlier in this chapter, cultural conflict 
among small-scale societies is shorter in duration and takes place over smaller 
distances. This is largely because the foragers, herders, and small-scale farming 
people of these societies simply can’t carry out long-term warfare; they have to 
keep their food-production systems working. Without massive granaries to feed 
standing armies (each a characteristic of every ancient civilization), small-scale 
societies have to solve their violent conflicts quickly and over a short distance 
so they can get back to the food quest.
Figure 17-1 shows Native American Indian warriors from the 16th century. 
Although becoming a warrior was an important part of the life of many Native 
North Americans, their violent conflicts were normally short and occurred 
over relatively small distances compared to modern, state-supported warfare.

Melvin and Carol Ember point out some common violent means of conflict 
resolution in such small-scale societies. Feuding is a protracted conflict 
between kin groups that may go on for generations because people born into 
one kin group are bound by that blood tie to carry on the conflict with some 
other kin group. Although feuding can be protracted, it’s low-intensity and not 
what one would call open war. Raiding is making short, target-specific, highly 
concentrated attacks on an enemy group, often to steal material goods or kill 
a certain individual or individuals.
So although nonindustrial, smaller-scale societies don’t wage war for as long 
as or across such large distances as bigger civilizations do, you should be 
careful with the idea that only large, industrial societies wage war.
 
Although violent conflict sometimes seems inevitable because humans live 
in groups and interactions lead to friction, some anthropologists believe that 
violent conflict is largely absent from some small-scale societies such as the 
Semai of Southeast Asia, who essentially forbid violence as a means of solving 
conflict. Although anthropologists have identified more than 20 human societ-
ies as having little to no significant violent conflict, they are in the minority, 
and conflict remains common in human culture.
Cultural conflict in larger-scale societies
Conflict between (or within) states — large political units equipped with 
military forces — is normally called war. Compared to the violent conflict in 
small-scale societies, the main characteristic of war in large-scale societies 
is that it normally takes place over longer distances and longer time periods 
than in smaller-scale societies. Larger-scale societies are simply equipped 

293
 Chapter 17: Kiss or Kill? Diversity, Conflict, and Culture
with more material and social resources, including standing military forces 
whose members are engaged in military affairs full-time.
Just because warfare is more protracted in larger societies, however, doesn’t 
mean that it’s more frequent than in smaller societies; in fact, nonindustrial-
ized societies wage war about as often as larger societies. In general, humans 
have fought wars for many reasons, and anthropologists have attempted to 
identify patterns in these reasons for warfare by looking at cultures world-
wide and throughout history and determining whether they exhibit recurring 
reasons for war. They came up with several main kinds of war, but note that 
the following aren’t the only kinds of war:
 
 State-building: One state attempts to conquer another to expand its own 
territory.
 
 Civil: Groups within a state war among themselves; these wars are 
usually more for political than material gain.
 
 Imperial: States explicitly seek material wealth.
 
 Religious: States make war over points of religion.
 
 Ethnic: States (or units within states) make war over ethnic identity.
Natural-born warriors?
In August 2006, genetic epidemiologist Rod Lea 
of New Zealand’s Lea Institute of Environmental 
Science and Research announced that Maoris — 
the native people of New Zealand — had higher 
incidences of “a gene associated with risk-
taking and aggressive behaviors,” according to 
Boonsri Dickinson of Cosmos Online.
Does a gene predispose certain people to vio-
lence? Many 19th-century anthropologists 
believed that they could identify so-called crimi-
nal types by physical characteristics such as the 
shape of the skull. Others believed that upbring-
ing was far more important than any genetic 
factor. The battle between those who disagree 
whether nature (genes) or nurture (socialization 
and upbringing) is most responsible for unusual 
aggression hasn’t been resolved. Many say that 
both are involved and that the search for nature or 
nurture as the sole influence in behavior is a red 
herring. Still, in 2003, researchers identified the 
gene Pet-I, which seemed to strongly correlate 
with anxiety and aggression in mice; in humans, 
however, the genetics of human aggression are 
still poorly known, and Lea’s statements have 
been criticized as oversimplifying a complex 
issue.
For his part, Lea also commented that “This 
gene has been linked to different anti-social 
behaviours and risk taking behaviour, but the 
link that is usually quite weak, and only pres-
ent in association with non-genetic factors, 
like sociological upbringing lifestyle factors. . . . 
There are lots of lifestyle, upbringing-related 
exposures that could be relevant here so, obvi-
ously, the gene won’t automatically make you 
a criminal.” In other words, the link is far less 
substantial than it may sound, and socialization 
in a culture that reveres its warrior past, for 
example (like that of the Maoris) is probably the 
more important factor influencing aggression.

294
Par t IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
Whereas small societies tend to fight wars for purposes of revenge or other 
similarly specific reasons, larger societies have political structures that people 
attempt to increase in size by means of conquest warfare, where neighboring 
territories are swallowed up by the conqueror. In a study of all ancient civili-
zations, the late archaeologist Bruce Trigger found that most ancient civiliza-
tions expanded outward and annexed any neighboring society that couldn’t 
resist military attack. Check out Chapter 10 for more on warfare in ancient 
civilizations.
Modern warfare extends over thousands of miles and kills not only intended 
targets but also civilians. It employs highly technical weapons and many 
labor specialists who work to design, build, maintain, and deliver the weap-
ons. Figure 17-2 shows a modern bomber airplane, which is only one of these 
weapon-delivery advances.

Some anthropologists have suggested that all wars are, ultimately, about access 
to resources; this materialist/ecological explanation for war has its merits, but 
other anthropologists say a specific historical explanation is necessary for every 
war. So far, no general theory for the cause of war has convinced all anthropolo-
gists. I’m betting that many justifications exist for war but that in the end, mate-
rial gain is often (though not always) an important factor.
Humanity and justice
Every human culture has rules for regulating social behavior, and these 
guidelines include rules and behavioral formulas for administering justice 
and righting wrongs. The late anthropologist Roy Rappaport called the deepest 

295
 Chapter 17: Kiss or Kill? Diversity, Conflict, and Culture
foundational norms of a culture its ultimate sacred postulates, a set of ideas — 
often linked to religious or supernatural concepts about the order of the 
universe — on which all else rests. (See Chapter 16 for more on these postu-
lates.) A given culture’s concepts of justice are built on the framework of these 
ideas.
As early as 3,700 years ago some human cultures were writing down their 
legal rules; at that date, in central Iraq, the Babylonian God-King Hammurabi 
had the rules of his kingdom encoded in a stone monument. Legal solutions 
to all kinds of problems were prescribed. For example, one dealt with what I 
suppose today you would call medical malpractice: “If the doctor has treated 
a gentleman for a severe wound with a lancet of bronze and has caused the 
gentleman to die, or has opened an abscess of the eye for a gentleman with 
the bronze lancet and has caused the loss of the gentleman’s eye, one shall 
cut off his hands.”
As cultures become more complex, their justice systems become more com-
plex. This simplicity doesn’t necessarily mean that smaller-scale cultures’ 
systems of justice aren’t effective, however; they have to be to keep peace. 
But because fewer people interact in these societies, justice is often meted out 
by elders or councils rather than the legal specialists — such as lawyers — of 
larger-scale societies.
Globalization and Human Culture
As communications and transportation become faster and more extensive, 
connecting (at least potentially) more and more people around the globe, the 
world seems to shrink. Anthropologists, naturally, are interested in this 
phenomenon of globalization.
Globalization can be defined many ways, but most anthropologists would 
agree that it’s a worldwide process of increasing cultural interaction and 
integration, made possible in part by increasing economic ties. For example, 
Americans calling computer companies for technical support may end up 
speaking with people in India. Or cotton grown in the U.S. is often shipped 
to other countries (such as Honduras), assembled into garments there, and 
then shipped back to the U.S. and sold in American stores; this situation has 
economic effects (and therefore cultural effects) on each society here, and 
what one culture does has effects on the other. British sociologist Anthony 
Giddens explains globalization as “. . . the intensification of worldwide social 
relations which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are 
shaped by events occurring many miles away, and vice versa.”

296
Par t IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
Anthropologists recognize at least three main dimensions of change in the 
process of globalization:
 
 Social/cultural changes include the rapid spread of ideas among all the 
connecting societies, such that culture change may be very rapid.
 
 Economic changes include the rapid change of economic conditions 
in one region because of previously unfelt activities in another area. 
For example, the rapid growth of the technology-support jobs in India 
resulted from the rapid abundance of consumer electronics in the 
United States.
 
 Demographic changes include migrations into and out of political 
boundaries (often driven by economic concerns) leading to the com-
plexities of cultural contact between migrants and the populations they 
move into. For example, Mexican migrants may move rapidly over long 
distances to take advantage of job opportunities in places that may or 
may not welcome them with open arms.
Although cultures have always been changing and in contact with other 
cultures, the changes brought about by globalization are particularly rapid, 
which may not give cultures time to adjust to the new conditions. Some 
applied anthropologists — anthropologists who apply their knowledge to 
real-world problems — focus on assisting local populations with the rapid 
changes imposed by globalization.
Globalization and ecological justice
Much globalization is driven by consumer demand in the industrialized First 
World and fulfilled by manufacturing centers in the developing Third World.
To keep consumer product prices as low as possible, companies pay developing-
world workers less than they would pay workers in the developed world. Also — 
and importantly — many developing-world countries, desperate for cash, trade 
their ecological wealth for monetary wealth in very unsustainable ways; for 
example, in Borneo ancient forests that could be used for many years to draw 
ecotourists are cut down for one-time payments for logs. Ecological justice is 
the concept that a country’s ecological resources are as precious as its mon-
etary wealth and that citizens have the right to healthy ecological conditions. 
People trained in anthropology — and some applied anthropologists — are 
increasingly working to ensure that cultures of the Third World, including many 
indigenous cultures, are ensured ecological justice.

297
 Chapter 17: Kiss or Kill? Diversity, Conflict, and Culture
Globalization and cultural assimilation
Cultural assimilation — the absorption of one culture into another so that 
the characteristics of the first culture are diluted beyond recognition over 
time — is an alarming aspect of globalization. As cultural diversity decreases, 
everyone loses because each culture has unique perspectives, histories, lan-
guages, cuisines, costumes, and habits — all the spices of life. Although many 
indigenous and small-scale cultures actively resist assimilation into Western 
civilization, it’s usually a losing battle, and many cultures have already disap-
peared forever. Today, for example, the cultural identity of Portugal is threat-
ened by the global demand for plastic wine-bottle corks. Portugal has been 
the world’s leader in making wine-bottle corks from real trees for centuries, 
and making these items by hand is part of their traditional culture; although 
obviously not every Portuguese is a cork-maker, cork-making, naturally, is 
important to the Portuguese. The increasing worldwide demand for cheaper, 
plastic corks has brought globalization to Portugal’s doorstep. This loss of 
culture is one of the hidden costs of globalization. Cultures traded in for low 
prices . . . in my estimation, that’s no bargain.
Globalization and nativistic movements
Over the past five decades, nativistic movements — the organization of 
indigenous peoples into political groups capable of lobbying for their own 
interests — have been very common. Many native groups, from the Inuit 
of the Canadian Arctic to the Philippines’ National Council of Tribal Elders, 
have organized into political entities and pooled funds to send their own 
children to college and then law school, allowing them to fight for their rights 
in the legal arena. As the processes of globalization increasingly require new 
natural resources, many native groups who live on such land and are now 
recognized in international courts of law find themselves — to a degree — in 
a powerful position. The United Nations even has a Permanent Forum on 
Indigenous Issues, which deals specifically with “indigenous issues related 
to economic and social development, culture, the environment, education, 
health and human rights,” according to its Web site (www.un.org/esa/
socdev/unpfii/). Their work, and that of many other such organiza-
tions, is assisted by many people trained in anthropology, and it’s certainly 
informed by decades of anthropological research, worldwide, into the lives of 
indigenous peoples.
Globalization and forced migration
As resources like forests are depleted and new ones are sought on an inter-
national, globalized raw-material market, many native people find themselves 

298
Par t IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
in the position of being forced (by military or political manipulation) off 
their traditional territories. Such displacement is called forced migration, 
and it’s such a problem worldwide that Oxford University’s Department 
of International Development has started an online organization — Forced 
Migration Online (www.forcedmigration.org/) — to help coordinate 
efforts both to reduce such migrations and to make the back migration — 
return to traditional lands when circumstances permit — an easier transi-
tion. Again, this undertaking involves many anthropologists, from cultural 
anthropologists familiar with how cultures react to migration to linguists 
knowledgeable about the misunderstandings that can arise as refugees 
speaking one language move into areas occupied by people speaking another 
language, and so on.

 Discovering the major challenges that face humanity today and in the more distant 
future
 Understanding how anthropology can help to meet these challenges
A
nthropology has done a good job — if I may say so myself — of sketch-
ing out where humanity came from and when, and basically how our 
species has turned out up to the present. Of course, how things are today 
wasn’t an evolutionary goal and isn’t necessarily how they’ll be tomorrow. 
Looking into the future can be a tricky business, but you don’t have to look 
too far to see some major challenges. In this chapter, you find out a few of 
these major challenges, and what anthropology can do to help overcome 
them.
The Only Constant Is Change
Many have believed that the purpose evolution was essentially to create the 
modern world and, with that task completed, that evolution is somehow over 
or finished. But this just isn’t true. Humanity continues to evolve, both bodily 
and (even more so) culturally.
Many previously thought that as humanity increasingly relied on technol-
ogy to adapt to its world, its genetic evolution would slow because humanity 
wouldn’t need biological adaptations any more. But recently a number of 
studies have shown that human biological evolution is continuing, and has 
even accelerated over the past 50,000 years or so as the human population 
has exploded — more people means more mating and offspring, and every 
offspring presents the chance for a new variation on the parental form. So, 
the human species continues to evolve.

300
Part IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
 
Evolution is simply a process of change through time, and it doesn’t mean that 
that change is going to be good, bad, or anything else. It just means change.
Human environments change, too. Only 15,000 years ago, all of Canada was 
essentially under a sheet of ice; when these glaciers (and other ice caps 
worldwide) melted away by 10,000 years ago, global sea levels rose by about 
300 feet, radically changing the many habitats occupied by people around the 
world. For example, Britain was cut off from mainland Europe as the water 
rose, forming today’s English Channel.
And our environments change today as well; the Arctic, for example, is 
warming. Of the 10,000 known bird species worldwide, one becomes extinct 
every year, and by the end of the century — according to Peter Raven at the 
Missouri Botanical Garden — ten are likely to become extinct every year. 
Many of the plants and animals you see on a hike today are different from 
what your grandparents would have seen; there are fewer plants and animals 
and fewer kinds of plants and animals.
A problem of our own making: The Sixth Extinction
Although some threats to humanity come from 
out of the blue — like potentially civilization-
destroying comets that may be headed for 
Earth — many problems are of our own making. 
Many scientists believe that due to massive 
overuse of resources (such as overfishing), 
clearing land for agriculture and other pur-
poses (destroying natural environments), and 
polluting the natural environments that are left, 
the human species is causing the extinction 
of about 30,000 species per year. That’s about 
three per hour, the fastest extinction rate in 
tens of millions of years. Although the last five 
mass extinction events on Earth have been due 
to natural causes — such as the planet being 
struck by comets or asteroids — this sixth 
extinction is caused by humanity.
Palaeoanthropologist Niles Eldredge has writ-
ten an essay called “The Sixth Extinction” 
(available at www.actionbioscience.
org/newfrontiers/eldredge2.html. 
In it he makes the bleak facts perfectly clear:
“The world’s ecosystems have been plunged 
into chaos, with some conservation biologists 
thinking that no system, not even the vast 
oceans, remains untouched by human pres-
ence. Conservation measures, sustainable 
development, and, ultimately, stabilization of 
human population numbers and consumption 
patterns seem to offer some hope that the Sixth 
Extinction will not develop to the extent of the 
third global extinction, some 245 million years 
ago, when 90% of the world’s species were 
lost.”
“Though it is true that life, so incredibly resil-
ient, has always recovered (though after long 
lags) after major extinction spasms, it is only 
after whatever has caused the extinction 
event has dissipated. That cause, in the case 
of the Sixth Extinction, is ourselves — Homo 
sapiens. This means we can continue on the 
path to our own extinction, or, preferably, we 
modify our behavior toward the global ecosys-
tem of which we are still very much a part. The 
latter must happen before the Sixth Extinction 
can be declared over, and life can once again 
rebound.”

301
 Chapter 18: Looming Disasters? From Overpopulation to Space Debris
This situation matters to humanity because no species is an island; the sci-
ence of ecology has shown that all species are connected in a massive web of 
complex interactions. Why does it matter that some obscure bug is becoming 
extinct? Because some kind of bird feeds on that bug, and that bird in turn 
helps to distribute the seeds of plants it consumes. It’s not just a bug going 
extinct — pretty soon, a whole ecosystem is affected.
Clearly, both humanity and the environments we call home are always 
changing.
Some of these changes threaten the way humanity lives today. Millions of 
people, for example, live in low-lying areas that will flood if sea levels con-
tinue to rise. Those people will have to move somewhere. Other threats to 
humanity include the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS 
and has already killed close to 30 million people. And some cultural trends 
don’t bode well either, such as the alarming loss of traditional languages 
worldwide. A traditional saying in Madagascar is that “An old person dying is 
a library on fire,” and every language lost is another perspective on humanity 
gone up, so to speak, in smoke.
Because anthropology has studied humanity so closely for so long, I think 
you can reasonably ask how it can help with these challenges. The American 
Anthropological Association thinks so, too; a recent issue of its Anthropology 
News newsletter was devoted to climate change and what anthropologists 
have to say about it.
The rest of this chapter looks at six major problems facing humanity today. 
Some are connected with others in complex ways, but anthropology has 
something useful to say about all of them:
 
 Overpopulation
 
 Climate change
 
 Language loss
 
 Food and water availability/famine
 
 Disease
 
 Space debris (yes, space debris)
Overpopulation
Just over 10,000 years ago, the human population was probably around 
5 million — 5 million hunter–gatherers spread across a vast globe. Today, 

302
Part IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
7 billion is a more accurate count. Figure 18-1 shows the growth of the human 
population over the past 10,000 years. Remember, it’s around 10,000 years ago 
that farming was first invented, and the first civilizations occur around 5,000 
years ago. The rapid growth in human population after about the year 1900 has 
a lot do with the invention of modern medicines and agricultural techniques. 
Plant and animal species can show this kind of rapid population growth, but 
they’re normally checked by natural limitations of the environment.

The road to overpopulation
In the late 1700s and early 1800s, an Englishman named Thomas Malthus pub-
lished a number of papers on the relationship between a species’ population 
and its food supply. Essentially, Malthus said that populations will tend to 
expand at a geometric rate (such as doubling every so many years) and food 
supplies will tend to expand only at an arithmetic rate (increasing by a fixed 
amount in a fixed amount of time). Populations, Malthus said, are limited by a 
lack of food. More individuals are born than can be supported by the environ-
ment, and those that can’t find food perish.
In practice, though, humanity works a little differently. Humans store up 
food after they harvest it and can feed many more mouths than a given plot 
of land could naturally support. This ability to store food has helped offset 
the normal Malthusian limit (named after Malthus’s argument) to population 
growth, and the human population has gone through the roof. Between 1900 
and 2000, the human population has increased fourfold, from 1.6 billion to 
more than 6 billion, an astonishing increase in the animal kingdom.

303
 Chapter 18: Looming Disasters? From Overpopulation to Space Debris
Over 200 years after Malthus, anthropologist J.K. Smail argued that even if 
zero-population-growth measures were enacted immediately, stabilizing the 
human population would take more than 50 years. He agreed with other esti-
mates that by 2050 the population would be close to 10 billion, an increase of 
50 percent in just two generations.
 
One generation is the period of time between a person’s birth and when he 
or she has children; though it varies a lot worldwide, a 20 to 30-year range is 
about right.
Smail also noted that the era of cheap energy (fossil fuels), adequate food 
supplies (from wood to fresh water), and plentiful fresh water was coming to 
an end, and rapidly. Combining these facts with the staggering increase in the 
human population would spell disaster. The human species won’t become 
extinct, but billions — not just hundreds of millions — will suffer and die 
horribly.
The world’s leaders know all of this: Today 70 percent of leaders in the devel-
oping word — where population growth is highest — report their concern 
with overpopulation (compared to 25 percent just 30 years ago) and many 
have implemented measures to limit population growth.
 
The Third World, a term dating to 1952, refers to countries that don’t have 
the infrastructure (roads, water systems, and so on), technology, and high 
standard of living found in the more highly developed First World, which con-
sists of countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and most of the 
countries of Europe. Some consider the term derogatory, and developing world 
is increasingly used.
Hope on the horizon
That’s all the bad news; is there any good news? Smail was actually cau-
tiously optimistic about limiting human population growth, but made it clear 
that efforts had to be real and immediate, and had to supersede any other 
issues — medicine, famine, health care — because “fixing” these in overpopu-
lated countries wouldn’t do any good if the population continued to increase.
The most important part of Smail’s argument was pointing out that humans, 
too, are subject to Malthusian limits; sooner or later, humans will have to 
face the terrible consequences of having too many mouths to feed. Keeping 
human population in line with what the Earth can support (about 2 billion 
people, according to Smail) — basically, living sustainably as a species — is a 
reasonable priority. Reducing human population growth would
 
 Decrease stress on nonrenewable resources
 
 Prevent famine

304
Part IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
 
 Provide reasonable employment
 
 Provide basic social services (health and education)
So what can anthropology do to help keep the human population living 
sustainably?
First, anthropologists can monitor and document population change as 
demographic anthropologists. (Demography is the study of populations.) 
Demographic anthropologists, accustomed to the ins and outs of understand-
ing human migration and other population-related phenomena, could be very 
helpful.
More importantly, anthropologists can help population-growth-limiting 
efforts on the local and community levels because cultural anthropologists 
are most familiar with this level of the human experience. Instead of simply 
having impersonal decrees coming down to the community level from 
national governments, anthropologists can help those at government levels 
better understand the needs, culture, and values of people living at the com-
munity level.
Climate Change
Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past few years, you’ve heard 
that the Earth’s climate is changing. Most scientists agree that the changes 
are related to the greenhouse effect, a warming of the Earth due to the intro-
duction of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels. The 
United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change lists many lines 
of evidence for climate change:
 
 Increasingly volatile weather: Droughts, tropical cyclones, heat waves, 
and storms in general have increased in intensity; the Mediterranean, 
parts of Southern Asia, and part of Africa have become increasingly dry, 
and increased incidences of flooding (such as floods in central Europe in 
1996 and 1997 and floods in Bangladesh in 2004 that left half the country 
flooded) are evidence of more powerful storms.
 
 A warming Arctic: The average Arctic temperature has increased nearly 
twice as fast as in the rest of the world over the past century, and many 
believe that sea ice on the ocean will melt completely during summers 
by 2050, and the Northwest Passage will remain ice-free throughout the 
year.

 Chapter 18: Looming Disasters? From Overpopulation to Space Debris
 
 Glacier melting: Globally, glaciers are in retreat — for example, in the 
past century, two-thirds of Switzerland’s glaciers have essentially melted 
away.
 
 Plant and animal changes: More than 400 plant and animal species are 
known to have been affected by modern climate change; for example, 
butterflies, dragonflies, moths, beetles and other insects are found far-
ther north than ever as the climate warms. (Now that could be a soap 
opera.)
In November, 2007, the UN called these changes “unequivocal,” so well-
documented that debating them would be like debating about gravity. The 
world’s climate is changing. Whatever humanity decides to do about it — 
switching to clean, non-greenhouse-gas-emitting energy sources, for example — 
is a question I don’t want to tackle; it’s too big for this book. But what I do want 
to mention is how anthropology will be able to help implement the changes that 
are sure to happen.
The American Association for the Advancement of 
Science on Climate Change
In December 2006 the American Association for 
the Advancement of Science released a state-
ment on the reality of climate change, excerpts of 
which are reprinted here; head to www.aaas.
org/news/releases/2007/0218am_
statement.shtml for the whole thing.
“The scientific evidence is clear: global climate 
change caused by human activities is occur-
ring now, and it is a growing threat to society. 
Accumulating data from across the globe reveal 
a wide array of effects: rapidly melting glaciers, 
destabilization of major ice sheets, increases 
in extreme weather, rising sea level, shifts in 
species ranges, and more. The pace of change 
and the evidence of harm have increased mark-
edly over the last five years. The time to control 
greenhouse gas emissions is now.”
“The atmospheric concentration of carbon 
dioxide, a critical greenhouse gas, is higher 
than it has been for at least 650,000 years. The 
average temperature of the Earth is heading 
for levels not experienced for millions of years. 
Scientific predictions of the impacts of increas-
ing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse 
gases from fossil fuels and deforestation match 
observed changes. As expected, intensification 
of droughts, heat waves, floods, wildfires, and 
severe storms is occurring, with a mounting toll 
on vulnerable ecosystems and societies. These 
events are early warning signs of even more 
devastating damage to come, some of which 
will be irreversible.”
“The growing torrent of information presents 
a clear message: we are already experienc-
ing global climate change. It is time to muster 
the political will for concerted action. Stronger 
leadership at all levels is needed. The time is 
now. We must rise to the challenge. We owe 
this to future generations.”

Part IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
The December 2007 issue of the American Anthropological Association’s 
Anthropology News was devoted to climate change research and how anthro-
pology could be involved in finding ways to cope with climate change.
One article by anthropologist T.J. Finan made the important point that 
although anthropologists have had a long history of researching human 
interaction with the environment, a somewhat antiscientific atmosphere 
in anthropology over the last 20 years or so has left a whole generation of 
anthropology graduates with a sense that hard science, typified by climate 
change science, was outside the view of anthropology. That, Finan says has 
to change. I agree. Anthropology can help with understanding, reacting to, 
and perhaps planning to reduce climate change in several ways:
 
 As in population-growth-limiting work, anthropologists could help by easing 
the transition on the community level from old ways of doing things to new 
ways of doing them. Governmental attempts to implement change often fail 
because they come from the top down and are alien to the needs and con-
cerns of communities. Anthropologists can facilitate better communication 
between communities and higher levels of organization.
 
 Ecological anthropologists — those focusing on human interactions with 
their environments and resources — have a deep knowledge of the prin-
ciples of evolution and adaptation and can help to make climate-change-
related adjustments more sensitive to the local conditions and ecologies 
of human communities.
 
 Anthropologists would be well suited to understanding how humans 
change and adapt over time. Therefore, they may be best suited and 
equipped to evaluate plans of action that will take time and affect human 
communities.
 
 Ecological anthropologists can document environmental change over 
time, as well as track how humans have dealt with it in the past and in 
the present.
Whatever changes are implemented or considered globally to deal with 
climate change, I think calling on anthropologists to help facilitate those 
changes on the human level is a no-brainer.
Say What? The Loss of 
Linguistic Diversity
Can the loss of languages be as disastrous to humanity as climate change or 
overpopulation? Although language loss may not cause as much suffering or 
death, losing languages is like losing entire archives of human experience.

307
 Chapter 18: Looming Disasters? From Overpopulation to Space Debris
And it’s happening at an alarming rate; of about 6,000 languages spoken today, 
half are spoken by so few people that they’ll be forgotten by the end of this 
century. One anthropologist has estimated that about two languages vanish 
every month. One example of a terrible loss is in Australia, where some esti-
mate that 90 percent of the native languages will be extinct in the next 20 years. 
It’s staggering to think that after 40,000 years, these languages — each one a 
set of ways of looking at survival, philosophy, love, art, music, humor, drama, 
and everything else humans love so much — will just suddenly be gone. That’s 
a tragedy.
How do languages go extinct? Normally it happens in the process of 
cultural assimilation, in which one culture adopts the customs, habits, 
values, traditions — and language — of another. To conform to new sur-
roundings, immigrants often assimilate into a larger culture, losing their 
traditional language in the process.
Why does this matter? Wouldn’t it be good for all people to share a common 
language? Wouldn’t that facilitate better communications and maybe even 
peace? Probably, but that doesn’t mean that rarer languages should die out. 
Because any human infant can acquire several languages with ease, humans 
have no reason not to preserve the world’s heritage of unique experiences, 
recorded in each distinctive language. Because the words a language uses to 
describe the world make for a unique perspective, each language represents 
an alternative way of understanding humanity. Losing languages is a human 
problem, not just a problem of a single culture. Losing a language is like 
losing a culture.
What can anthropologists do to help to preserve languages? They can spread 
the word that language diversity is important and threatened. And, knowing 
the goals, values, and lives of native and traditional peoples worldwide better 
than any government bureaucrat, anthropologists are best equipped to advo-
cate for those native and traditional peoples so that assimilation and language 
loss aren’t the only options in a rapidly globalizing world. Linguistic anthropol-
ogists have already done this in many cases, recording endangered languages 
and developing programs for preserving and teaching those languages.
Food and Water Availability/Famine
Famine — a general food shortage that reduces individual human caloric 
intake below about 1,000 calories per person per day — and drought (water 
shortage) have accounted for millions of deaths in the last century and a 
half as the human population in developing countries has exploded. The 
deaths of millions of human beings make these issues concerns of anthropol-
ogy. Famines occurred in the ancient civilizations as well, but they’re pretty 

308
Part IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
much restricted to agricultural societies that depend on stored foods; mobile 
hunter–gatherers facing a food shortage simply move on to other hunting and 
foraging grounds, One of the significant consequences, then, of humanity’s 
general shift to agriculture has been a susceptibility to famine (and drought, 
which affects agricultural crops, of course).
Sometimes, famine is a genuine result of the population exceeding the food 
supply, but in many cases, anthropological studies have found that famines 
have been politically sponsored. For example, the famines in the former 
Soviet Union in the early 1900s killed between 5 and 8 million, and many 
believe Soviet officials allowed this to happen regardless of whether they 
politically engineered it. More recently, food shortages in certain areas are 
the result of the processes of globalization, in which states sponsor farming 
for export rather than to feed the population.
Anthropologists are involved in many attempts to better understand and 
cope with famine. One frightening finding of anthropology is that famines 
tend to divide populations internally, which could sponsor civil war; famine 
can lead to a domino effect of one miserable consequence after another. 
Another finding, made in a cross-cultural study by anthropologist Robert 
Dirks, is that states that tend not to have famine (such as the U.S.) aren’t 
necessarily spared famine because their farming systems are better than 
anywhere else; they avoid famine because they have systems in place to 
offset food and water shortages, such as unemployment assistance, market-
price guarantees, and many other aid programs supported by taxes. Knowing 
this, anthropologists can help implement such programs in countries where 
famine is more common; once again, the anthropological approach is impor-
tant to implement programs with a greater understanding of local conditions 
and cultures than is normally had by government administrators.
Disease
Humanity is susceptible to many diseases. Some are endemic (always pres-
ent in a population), and some sweep rapidly through widespread popula-
tions as epidemics. Only in the last century or so — when diseases were 
well-enough understood by science — have large-scale disease-eradication 
programs been implemented. In some cases, this has radically changed dis-
ease situations that had been present for centuries, if not thousands of years. 
Technological eradication of certain diseases has in effect removed one limit 
to human population growth that was in effect for a very long time, contribut-
ing (along with modern medicine and agriculture) to the recent world popula-
tion boom.
Some diseases already eradicated (or nearly so) in the United States remain a 
problem in other countries; the Centers for Disease Control estimates that 1 

309
 Chapter 18: Looming Disasters? From Overpopulation to Space Debris
million people per year die of malaria. That’s nearly 3,000 per day, or several 
every minute. That’s a serious problem. So is AIDS (acquired immune defi-
ciency syndrome), the result of the sexually transmitted HIV virus. The UN 
has estimated that more than 40 million humans worldwide (most of them in 
Africa) carried the HIV virus at the end of 2001. However, the disease is also 
common in Asia; at the end of 2006, the UN estimated a population of nearly 
1 million HIV carriers in China and another 1.5 million in India. Such numbers 
indicate a global epidemic.
Anthropological approaches to helping prevent disease include studies of the 
cultural dimension of disease. In some African countries, for example, males 
feel the use of a condom isn’t masculine, so sexually transmitted diseases 
continue to spread. In this case, although a technological solution — the use 
of condoms — is present, a cultural condition (male views of what’s mas-
culine) is the most important factor in controlling disease. In such cases, 
cultural change has to occur if disease is to be controlled, and it’s anthro-
pologists who are best equipped to understand and even help guide that cul-
tural change. Once again, this is important to do from the ground up — from 
understanding cultural conditions in local communities — rather than from 
the top down by mandates from government agencies that may not be in 
touch with cultural realities.
Space Debris
Several telescopes today monitor space for potentially harmful space debris, 
such as comets and asteroids. These pass by the Earth all the time, and NASA 
currently considers about a thousand asteroids ranging in size from basket-
balls to mountains to be potentially hazardous. This means they will probably 
pass very close to the Earth in the foreseeable future and have a chance of 
impacting the Earth. If an item about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) across impacted 
the Earth at the proper velocity, the explosion would raise so much dust that 
it would block out the sun, an event that would cripple agriculture to the 
point that humanity may starve before the dust settled. Figure 18-2 illustrates 
what could happen if one of these objects impacted the Earth.
To protect humanity against such disasters, many have advocated colonizing 
space. In a 1982 book titled Interstellar Migration and the Human Experience, 
several anthropologists and other scientists speculated on why and how 
humanity may choose to move off Earth to other planets and, eventually, 
other solar systems. In the long run, this plan seems like the only option for 
humanity. It’s not science fiction, nor is it necessarily running away from our 
problems here on Earth (although some may try to do just that); new colo-
nies would have to be self-sufficient, harmonious, and extremely efficient. 
They would be the epitome of environmentally conscious culture.

In 2006 astrophysicist Stephen Hawking advocated that humanity seek 
a second home, echoing the late astronomer Carl Sagan’s comment that 
humanity should become at least a “two-planet species” — not to plant a 
flag on Mars, or just look for fossils of exotic life forms there, but to move to 
at least one other planet to prevent humanity from having all its eggs in one 
basket.
After all, nothing lasts forever, and that includes our solar system. The 
Earth isn’t as safe as it’s seemed for the last 5,000 years of recorded history. 
Truly catastrophic space debris could pop up unexpectedly at any time; it 
happened to the dinosaurs around 65 million years ago as the Fifth Mass 
Extinction. In several billion years, the sun will become a red giant and incin-
erate the Earth. That’s worth thinking about.
Anthropology can help with nearly every aspect of planning the human colo-
nization of space, from societal concerns to those of human nutrition, evolu-
tion, conflict resolution, and so on. I cover the anthropological implications 
of many of these topics throughout this book.

Edge of Physical Anthropology
In This Chapter

 Exploring what molecular anthropology has found out about the “Mitochondrial Eve” 
and the “Iceman”
F
or much of its history, physical anthropology was mainly concerned 
with studying the fossils of humanity’s early ancestors. Physical anthro-
pologists trained in biology — particularly skeletal biology — anatomy, and 
evolution, focusing on how evolutionary forces shaped the bodies of ancient 
humans, as reflected in the fossil record.
For the last two decades, however, there’s been a new game in town: molecu-
lar anthropology, focusing on how DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid, the molecule 
of life) can help anthropologists understand human evolution. This new field 
has reinforced some old theories, toppled others, and continues to hold 
great promise for the understanding of the human species.
Because molecular anthropology is so prominent today and shows more 
signs of growing than fading away, in this chapter I introduce you to the prin-
ciples of this exciting new field as well as some of its results.
Molecular Anthropology
Molecular anthropology is a relatively new branch of physical anthropol-
ogy that focuses on human genetics to investigate — in the words of one 
evolutionary anthropology bigwig — “. . . the origin, relationships, history, 
structure, and migration patterns of human populations.” Other prominent 
research institutes have very similar goals.

312
Part IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
How it works
The basis of most molecular anthropology is the fact that DNA, the molecule 
that directs the building of a living thing’s physical body (whether that body 
is an acorn, fish, or gibbon) changes over time; when the parent generation 
have offspring, the DNA of those offspring aren’t — in the great bulk of all 
cases — identical to the DNA of the parents. I get into why the DNA is differ-
ent in a moment, but let me mention the next significant point first.
Although parent and offspring DNA will have some differences, they’re still 
very similar because the offspring are just one generation removed from 
the parents: The apple hasn’t fallen far from the tree, genetically speaking. 
Examining the DNA “fingerprint” for parents and their offspring has shown 
this time and again. And that fingerprint will be more similar between the 
parents and their offspring than the parents, say, and the offspring of some 
other parents. This key is one of the keys to molecular anthropology.
Knowing that the DNA fingerprint for an individual is more like his parents 
than any other individual, you can trace the movements of and relationships 
among various peoples based on the similarities of their genetic fingerprints. 
For example, the genetic fingerprint for native people of the Pacific Islands 
and those of Southeast Asia should be quite similar because archaeological 
evidence shows that Southeast Asians first colonized the Pacific Islands more 
than 3,000 years ago, and the Pacific Islanders are their descendants. At the 
very least, Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander DNA should be more simi-
lar to each other (because Pacific Islanders are descended from Southeast 
Asians) than either is to, say, European DNA, because these populations just 
haven’t been interbreeding with Europeans until comparatively recently (and 
certainly not 3,000 years ago).
So why does the DNA differ between the parent and offspring generations, 
and how does that help anthropologists? This question has several answers.
First, the nuclear DNA (the DNA that you inherit from both parents) differs 
between parent and offspring because the male and female parents’ DNA 
are shuffled in the egg and sperm cells before they unite. That is, before the 
male’s and female’s DNA come into contact (at the moment of conception), 
they reorder themselves to a degree, introducing new combinations. This 
process is called recombination, and the new variations on the basic parental 
DNA fingerprint are called mutations.
 
Although in popular use the word mutation has negative connotations, in 
biology mutation simply means a novelty, a change in the DNA. Genetically 
speaking, mutations can be negative (not beneficial to the bearer), positive 
(beneficial to the bearer), or neutral (have no significant negative or positive 
consequence for the bearer).

313
 Chapter 19: Eve and the Iceman: The Cutting Edge of Physical Anthropology
Second — and of great interest to the molecular anthropologist — is the fact 
that mitochondrial DNA, the DNA that humans inherit from their mothers 
only, differs between parent and offspring because it slowly accumulates 
changes — mutations — simply as a function of time, as DNA replication 
errors accumulate. I come back to this topic later.
Third — and also of great interest to the molecular anthropologist — is the 
fact that Y-chromosome DNA, the DNA that only males inherit from their 
fathers, differs between parent and offspring much like mitochondrial DNA, 
slowly accumulating changes as DNA replication errors accumulate. I come 
back to this subject later, too.
How anthropologists use it
How can this information help anthropologists? For one thing, they use it to 
identify the genetic distance between individuals, or the genetic population 
to which some human remains belong, as in the case of the Pacific Islanders 
and the Europeans I mentioned earlier. If anthropologists can extract good 
(undamaged and uncontaminated) DNA from a skeleton (or, more commonly, 
from a tooth root) they have a good chance of telling what human population 
it came from. This process can help in tracking ancient migrations.
Second, anthropologists can use what’s called a molecular clock to identify how 
long ago two populations diverged. That’s because in some types of DNA — such 
as the mitochondrial DNA I discuss later in this chapter — genetic differences 
accumulate over time at a known and stable rate. Knowing the rate at which 
changes accumulate (and that the rate doesn’t change significantly over time) 
allows the molecular anthropologist to count up the genetic differences between 
two individuals by comparing their DNA “bar codes” or fingerprints. This count-
ing can determine when, in terms of years ago, the two individuals were in the 
same genetic population.
In short, then, molecular approaches allow anthropologists to analyze DNA 
to identify the degree of genetic similarity between individuals and the time 
since two individuals were of the same genetic population (which in turn 
helps them figure out when and at what rate ancient populations migrated).
The studies of human genetics used by molecular anthropologists generally 
include the following:
 
 Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies focus on the DNA passed from 
mother to offspring and are widely used to estimate the degree 
of similarity or difference between two samples of human DNA. 
Anthropologists can then convert this difference into an estimate of 
how long ago the two populations diverged genetically.

314
Part IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
 
 Y-chromosome DNA studies focus on the DNA passed from father to son 
only, and are used in much the same way as mtDNA studies.
 
 DNA sequencing studies identify the sex and global population of origin 
of a given DNA sample.
 
 Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) studies focus on a group of genes 
related to the production of antigens (molecules used by the immune 
system) and can aid in tracking migration and the geographical origin of 
populations.
 
The appearance and flourishing of a genetic component to anthropology is in 
keeping with a larger trend. In biology in general, recent advances in under-
standing DNA and the ability to study it have led to a tremendous shift in the 
life sciences, generally speaking, toward molecular approaches. In 1992, after 
more than 120 years as a general-science research publication, the journal 
Nature launched Nature Genetics to keep up with advances in this field.
Molecular anthropology is widely popular today and has provided great 
information on human migration and evolution worldwide; some examples 
include the following:
 
 A study by Italian scientists has shown that the population of Sicily 
is genetically so similar that they seem to all have come from a single 
founding population.
 
 A synthesis of many studies of Native North and South American DNA 
has shown that the first colonists of the Americas came from East Asia 
and probably arrived around between 20,000 years ago and 14,000 years 
ago, a finding that coincides well with the archaeological and geographi-
cal evidence (see Chapter 8 for more on the first colonization of the 
Americas).
 
 A study by American and Russian scientists has found that Alaska’s 
Aleutian Islands were colonized by people genetically most related to 
Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula, just a few hundred miles to the west of 
the Aleutians. What’s surprising is that the migration didn’t come from 
the west, but from the east, suggesting that ancient Kamchatkan pio-
neers entered the Alaskan mainland long before back-migrating west to 
discover the Aleutians.
 
An excellent online resource for tracking human migration as revealed by DNA 
can be found at National Geographic’s Genographic Project Web site, at www3.
nationalgeographic.com/genographic/index.html. And Figure 14-2 
in Chapter 14 shows you a genetic map of the world’s populations according 
to recent findings in molecular anthropology.

315
 Chapter 19: Eve and the Iceman: The Cutting Edge of Physical Anthropology
Why some say it doesn’t work
Molecular anthropology has its problems, and you have to keep them in mind 
until they’re worked out.
First, some say the rate at which genetic differences accumulate isn’t so 
stable. Instead of DNA having a known, stable rate of mutation in humans, 
some argue, the rate can be highly variable. Therefore, critics argue, molecu-
lar anthropologists need to go back to the drawing board and fully investi-
gate the idea that the mutation rate among humans is both known and stable.
Some scientists have done exactly that, but their findings haven’t supported 
the idea that mutation rates are as variable as critics say. At the least, pro-
ponents of the molecular clock say, highly variable mutation rates are a very 
recent phenomenon (for all kinds of reasons), and beyond a few hundred 
years ago mutation rates were stable and are well known. This issue hasn’t 
been entirely sorted out, yet, but I’m willing to bet it will be in the next few 
years. Also keep in mind that most of the findings of the molecular-clock 
studies support the information in the fossil and archaeological records. That 
fact helps support the idea that anthropologists understand the molecular 
clock pretty well understood — it’s not just a crude “sundial,” as one critic 
put it.
DNA detectives
The last two decades have seen a veritable 
explosion of anthropological interest in genetic 
studies. Due largely to advances in the ability 
to read DNA fingerprints of both modern and 
ancient DNA, the once low-tech field of physi-
cal anthropology (characterized by studying 
fossils excavated from the ground) has been 
transformed into an expensive, high-tech 
endeavor. Although fossil studies haven’t been 
abandoned (because the fossils can reveal 
things the DNA can’t), they have been joined by 
molecular anthropology.
Because every person’s DNA is unique, molecu-
lar anthropologists can identify anyone’s recent 
genetic history. For less than $300, commercial 
laboratories can test your DNA to identify where 
your ancestors came from thousands of years 
ago. DNA is also useful in forensics to identify 
criminals or absolve people accused of crimes, as 
well as to identify human remains from crash sites 
and other disasters where normal identifying 
characteristics — such as dental records — aren’t 
available. The Innocence Project, based at The 
Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva 
University, uses DNA evidence to exonerate 
falsely accused (and often imprisoned) people. 
As of this writing, the project has cleared 215 
wrongly convicted individuals.

316
Part IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
Another potential problem is contamination. When first excavating human 
remains in field settings, workers’ DNA can contaminate the ancient bones 
because they rarely wear protective garments. I can’t blame them; the outfits 
are hard to work in — imagine excavating a site in sweltering central Panama 
wearing a hazardous-material suit! Unfortunately, this contamination leaves 
many human remains studies in jeopardy. Even in the lab, contamination can 
be a problem, and studies that show very little difference between modern 
and ancient DNA are immediately suspect. For this reason, many labs take 
DNA samples from their own workers to be sure they aren’t contaminating 
the archaeological material.
Yet another issue is the fact that DNA, an organic molecule, decays over time. 
In the film Jurassic Park, characters extract 100-million-year-old dinosaur DNA 
from an ancient mosquito preserved in amber. This practice is possible in 
principle, but only in very rare cases. The oldest DNA yet recovered is about 
500,000 years old, and even this age is rare: Most DNA studies occur on speci-
mens less than 10,000 years old. Still, DNA recovery from several Neanderthal 
remains, each over 30,000 years old, has been successful. DNA decay (which 
really means degradation into pieces so small that not much can be learned 
from them) is a limiting factor to molecular anthropology, not something that 
stops it entirely.
DNA and the Mitochondrial Eve
In 1987, the venerable scientific journal Nature published a paper by biochem-
ists Rebecca Cann, Mark Stoneking, and Allan C. Wilson titled “Mitochondrial 
DNA and Human Evolution.” This exciting paper signaled the coming of age 
of molecular anthropology, even though it immediately divided the anthropo-
logical community into those who believed in its methods and implications 
and those who rejected them.
What the paper proposed was this: Mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited 
only from the mother, had been shown to accumulate mutations over time at 
a known and stable rate — about 2 to 4 percent per million years, or about 
one significant mutation every 6,000 to 12,000 years. The authors proposed 
that this knowledge, combined with the degree of genetic diversity world-
wide today, could help track ancient migration. Populations with similar DNA 
would be more recently related (because they had been accumulating genetic 
differences for relatively little time), even if they were genetically distinctive 
(say, Scandinavians and Britons). Populations with very different DNA would 
be more distantly related (say, Africans and East Asians) because they had 
been accumulating genetic differences for a longer period. With such data, a 
human genetic family tree could be diagrammed. Furthermore, because the 
rate of mutation was known and stable, the number of mutations differentiat-
ing two groups could be read like a molecular clock to identify how long the 
two groups had been apart.

317
 Chapter 19: Eve and the Iceman: The Cutting Edge of Physical Anthropology
To demonstrate these points, the authors had collected mitochondrial DNA 
samples from human populations worldwide and compared them, with star-
tling and exciting results.
Out of Africa: African diversity 
and extra-African similarity
The paper reported several main discoveries:
 
 Genetic diversity was greatest within Africa, indicating that African 
populations had been accumulating mitochondrial DNA mutations for a 
relatively long time.
 
 Genetic diversity was relatively low outside Africa, indicating that all 
populations outside Africa had been accumulating mitochondrial DNA 
mutations for a relatively short time.
 
 Modern human populations had been accumulating mutations for about 
200,000 years, and around 200,000 years ago a maternal ancestral group — 
the “mitochondrial Eve,” located somewhere in Africa — donated the mito-
chondrial DNA that all humans carry today
Basically, the authors of the paper had made the remarkable claim to have iden-
tified the last common ancestor of all living people, somewhere in Africa around 
200,000 years ago. The study also strongly supported the “out of Africa” theory 
of human origins, which said that modern humans emerged from Africa about 
100,000 years ago, replacing all prior extra-African migrants — such as, for exam-
ple, the Neanderthals, who already existed in Europe.
The inevitable debates
As Carl Sagan used to say, extraordinary claims should be backed up by 
extraordinary evidence, and so in the best tradition of science, research-
ers worldwide began to take Cann and her colleagues’ paper apart piece by 
piece. How carefully had the DNA been collected? Did the statistics check 
out? Why didn’t they consider this factor or that one? The main contention 
has been that that the overall rate of mutation in mitochondrial DNA isn’t 
constant, and therefore the paper’s molecular clock was suspect. The clock 
was suspect (no anthropologist believes the rate of mutation was entirely 
stable or completely constant over hundreds of thousands of years), but 
research has shown that the clock is reasonably accurate.

Part IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
Debate went on for some years, and today some questions remain, but later 
research largely backed up the out of Africa/mitochondrial Eve models. In 
fact, they were backed up not only by further genetic studies but also by 
independent lines of archaeological and fossil data that also suggest an 
African origin for all modern humans around 150,000 to 200,000 years ago. 
Now, I have to admit that I’m more convinced by the “Out of Africa” model 
for modern human origins than any other, but remember, the debate rages 
on; for more on that the debate, check out Chapter 7.
Neanderthals and You: The 
Neanderthal Genome
In recent years, molecular anthropology has also set its sights on one of 
archaeology’s greatest enigmas, the question of the fate of the Neanderthals.
Neanderthals first appear in Europe and the Near East around 200,000 
years ago, as one of the many regional variants of proto-human that had 
emerged from Africa for around 2 million years. For the next 170,000 years, 
Neanderthals were great survivors, adapting to the ice-age conditions of 
Europe by living in protective caves, using fire, wearing a basic kind of 
animal-hide clothing, and hunting as effectively as cave lions and other 
top predators. But suddenly, around 30,000 years ago, the Neanderthals 
Genetic trails
By genetically “fingerprinting” thousands of 
people around the world who represent differ-
ent ethnic populations and using the molecular 
clock to identify when they originated, anthro-
pologists have identified more than 20 main 
mitochondrial DNA groups, called mtDNA 
haplogroups. Groups L1, L2, and L3, for exam-
ple, are African in origin (with an origin date 
of around 150,000 to 170,000 years) and are at 
the root of all other groups including group U5, 
which appears in Europe around 50,000 years 
ago, likely originated in the Near East, and prob-
ably represented the individuals that replaced 
the Neanderthals. As researchers refine their 
methods and studies, anthropologists are 
increasingly able to track the migrations of 
ancient peoples in detail never before thought 
possible.
And although much of molecular anthropology 
has focused on mitochondrial DNA inherited 
only from the mother, recent advances have 
allowed anthropologists to also track the evo-
lution of the Y-chromosome inherited only by 
sons from their fathers. Y-chromosome haplo-
groups have also been identified and are cur-
rently being compared with mtDNA haplogroup 
data, with promising results.

319
 Chapter 19: Eve and the Iceman: The Cutting Edge of Physical Anthropology
vanished, their tool types disappeared, and their fossils stopped. In their 
place are the moderns, Homo sapiens sapiens — you and me. For a long time, 
anthropologists have wondered whether the Neanderthals evolved into 
Homo sapiens sapiens, were replaced by Homo sapiens sapiens, or were done 
in by something in between.
But by the late 1990s it was technically possible to extract DNA from the 
unfossilized remnants of some Neanderthal bones and compare them with 
modern human DNA. Since the first paper on Neanderthal DNA was published 
in 1997, several other studies have followed, examining DNA from relatively 
recent Neanderthals (within the period 50,000 years ago to their extinction 
around 30,000 years ago). What molecular anthropologists have found has 
helped solve the mystery of the Neanderthal’s demise. The main findings to 
date include the following:
 
 Neanderthal DNA is substantially different from modern human DNA. 
This fact strongly suggests that Neanderthals didn’t interbreed substan-
tially with the modern humans, which supports the out of Africa model 
mentioned earlier.
 
 However, studies show Neanderthal DNA is over 99 percent identical 
that of modern humans. Although this similarity shows how genetically 
“human” Neanderthals were, remember that a 1 percent difference can 
be significant: Chimpanzee genes are also about 99 percent identical to 
those of humans.
 
 The divergence between Neanderthals and modern humans occurred 
somewhere around 300,000 years ago. That is, Neanderthals appear to 
have been an offshoot or branch of the lineage Homo erectus, which many 
believe also gave rise to modern humans around 100,000 years ago.
Of course, not everyone buys the Neanderthal DNA data. Some say the 
samples have been contaminated, some say that the DNA analysis methods 
are faulty, and some say that DNA over about 10,000 years old is so degraded 
that anything that may be read from it would be highly suspect.
Despite these criticisms, though, Neanderthal genetics is a flourishing field. 
By the time this book goes to press, the full Neanderthal genome is expected 
to be completed by researchers at Germany’s Max Planck Institute for 
Evolutionary Biology and 454 Life Sciences, a biotech company in Branford, 
Connecticut. I’m sure the next decade will be as exciting as the last.
The Iceman
In 1991, two hikers discovered a body eroding from the ice of a glacier in 
northern Italy. Initially thought to be the corpse of an unlucky and forgot-
ten mountaineer, the strange artifacts near the body — including a fur hat, 

320
Part IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
a copper axe, and a stone knife — indicated that the find was much more 
interesting. When radiocarbon dating set the age of the Iceman at 5,300 years 
ago, archaeologists went wild: Here was a well-preserved human who was 
700 years dead when the first stones of the great pyramids of Egypt were just 
being laid. What could the Iceman tell humanity about the past?
At first, not much. Nobody could tell, just from looking at the relatively well-
preserved, naturally mummified body where he came from, where he was 
going, how he died, or whom he may be related to. Although speculation flew 
wildly (and still does today), DNA analysis answered some important ques-
tions and revealed a few facts that nobody expected:
 
 The Iceman’s arrows and clothing had the blood of several humans 
on them, strongly suggesting that the Iceman was in a fight just before 
death and didn’t simply freeze to death, as first believed. This evidence 
was backed up by the discovery of a stone arrowhead in the Iceman’s 
back and other wounds on his body.
 
 The Iceman may have been infertile, with a low sperm mobility; some 
have suggested that this characteristic may have had something to do 
with the circumstances of his death, though no case has been assem-
bled yet.
 
 Mitochondrial DNA showed that the Iceman’s mother had come from 
the K Haplogroup, a European group originating around 16,000 years 
ago and spreading widely throughout the continent after a dramatic 
recession of the great ice sheets.
As DNA extraction and analysis methods improve, I’m sure anthropologists 
are in for more exciting discoveries. Personally, I’m waiting for a frozen 
Neanderthal to be found thawing from the Siberian permafrost.

can help

rchaeologists are often depicted as crusty old professors obsessed 
with artifacts and working away, buried deep in some university base-
ment. Although that’s sometimes the case — I’ve spent entire winters basi-
cally confined to my basement lab, analyzing artifacts — it’s not always. 
Many applications of archaeology are relevant to modern daily life. Take 
tourism, for example. Go to the British Tourist Authority Web site and you 
immediately see ancient castles; nearly any Web site dealing with travel in 
England mentions Stonehenge. Tourism is a major industry contributing 
well more than 119 billion dollars per year to England’s economy, and much 
of it’s geared to visiting sites like Stonehenge. The same goes for a lot of 
other countries: Think of the pyramids of Egypt, Mexico, or Central America. 
Finding such archaeological sites and investigating them in detail is impor-
tant to maintaining a healthy tourist industry, and doing so demands a steady 
flow of archaeologists.
Archaeology is also useful for learning about your ancestors. Unless you’re 
royalty, you’re probably related by blood to the essentially voiceless multi-
tudes of citizens from the ancient civilizations, people living in a world where 
only the elites were literate. Without books or the ability to write, the peas-
ants and common citizens of the ancient world — your ancestors — have for 
a long time gone without representation. But archaeology can tell you about 
their lives.
And what about the historical record? Many are wary of official accounts of 
contemporary events because, frankly, they’ve been lied to so many times. 
So, big surprise, ancient state records also highlight the best times, glorify 

322
Part IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
their leaders, and so on. For these reasons, archaeology can help you under-
stand your history better than official records alone. Archaeology can test 
the historical record by comparing what was written down with actual physi-
cal evidence of what happened in the past.
 
In 1934, the Society for American Archaeology formed as a professional organi-
zation “dedicated to the research, interpretation, and protection of the archae-
ological heritage of the Americas.” Among its Principles of Archaeological 
Ethics is a statement written to ensure that archaeology reaches out from the 
so-called ivory tower to the general public; Principle Number 4, public educa-
tion and outreach, states that “Archaeologists should reach out to, and partici-
pate in, cooperative efforts with others interested in the archaeological record 
with the aim of improving the preservation, protection, and interpretation of 
the record. . . . explain and promote the use of archaeological methods and 
techniques in understanding human behavior and culture, and communicate 
archaeological interpretations of the past.”
For all these reasons and more, archaeology is an important part of any civi-
lization that values and wants to learn from its past. To understand how, in 
this chapter I share some examples of how archaeology can impact people in 
daily life.
History Is Written by the Winners: 
The Importance of Archaeology
You often hear that history is written by the winners, and indeed, a lot of his-
tory is recorded from a biased point of view; but archaeology seeks the truth. 
One benefit of archaeology, then, is that it can help correct the official record 
or even flesh out incomplete records. Archaeology can also speak for those 
who had no voice in the ancient world, and this goal is important for many 
archaeologists. Because official histories are features of civilizations and 
therefore only come after the millions of years of prehistoric archaeology, 
the kind of archaeology that investigates the accuracy of historical records is 
called historical archaeology.
For example, an official battle account describes the 8th-century BC God-King 
Sargon of Assyria laying waste to his opponents with a handful of men at his 
side: “[L]ike a mighty javelin I fell upon Rusash, his destruction I accomplished, 
I routed him. The bodies of his warriors like malt I brewed. . . . Two hundred 
and fifty of the royal seed, his governors, his officials and his cavalry in my 
hands I took and I broke his battle line.” A pretty remarkable account, and it’s 
backed up by official Assyrian sculptures that always show glorious Assyrian 
victories (but never defeats). Figure 20-1 shows an official state depiction of a 
7th-century BC battle.

Historical archaeology and written history
What actually happens in the world and what gets written down as history 
sometimes conflict, whether it’s because of deliberate mischaracterization, 
selective memory, or just generally incomplete record-keeping. Luckily, his-
torical archaeology can help resolve these conflicting stories and lead to a 
better understanding of history.
Historical archaeology combines the field and laboratory methods of prehis-
toric archaeology with the research methods of history to paint a more com-
plete picture of the past. This examination particularly involves the analysis 
of both primary documents (original accounts of an event by an eyewitness) 
and the context in which those documents were written. Is this document 
a personal journal or government record? Did a peasant write it, or was it a 
state scribe? These kinds of questions give historical anthropologists a better 
idea of a document’s historical significance.
Note also that historical archaeologists also often analyze quite a bit of oral 
tradition in their investigations; this tradition is the history of people who 
don’t read or write but pass their histories from one generation to the next 
through stories, myths, and so on. See Chapter 11 for more on oral tradition.
The following sections give you some examples of how archaeology can help 
people understand the past better than simply relying on official records can.

Part IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
Commoners of ancient Egypt
Until the last few decades, archaeologists have focused on large, spectacular 
finds like the tombs and palaces of Egypt’s kings and queens. But, of course 
other stories exist, stories that haven’t been told for thousands of years. Only 
archaeology can tell these tales, the stories of the common folk who built the 
great monuments, farmed the fertile soils, and supported the priestly classes 
who venerated Egypt’s hundreds of gods and goddesses.
For example, excavations at the ancient Southern Egyptian village Dier el 
Medina have revealed that workers lived in two-story apartments, each with 
several rooms, that were normally furnished with beds, a hearth and kitchen 
for grinding grain to flour, a storage cellar, and often a small shrine to the 
goddess Bes. Entire families may have lived in some of the buildings, called 
up to perform work for the state. For this work, citizens were paid in food, 
including wheat grain, fish, vegetables, salt, oil, and — occasionally, as a 
bonus — poultry or other special foods.
Although most Egyptians didn’t read or write — that was a special skill of 
elites such as priests and scribes — villagers of Dier el Medina occasion-
ally did mark business transactions and legal decisions on small ostraca, or 
pieces of clay marked with hieroglyphs found scattered throughout the site. 
Still, these records are few and far between, and they don’t flesh out the lives 
of commoners nearly as well as careful archaeological excavation.
New York’s forgotten African burial ground
For more than 100 years beginning in the late 
17th century, a 5-acre plot of what is today 
Lower Manhattan was used as a cemetery for 
more than 20,000 African Americans. By the late 
19th century, the site was paved over and for-
gotten as New York City grew. Only in 1991 was 
it rediscovered and investigated as an archaeo-
logical site.
The scientific excavation of the site, where 
over 400 skeletons were discovered and care-
fully excavated, was one aspect of the project. 
Analysis focused on the human remains, reveal-
ing relatively short lifespans for the adults (who 
rarely lived past their mid-thirties and often 
died between the ages of 15 and 25) and a high 
death rate for children; in fact, nearly half of all 
the bodies were prepubescent children. Those 
who lived to adulthood were worked hard; 
adult bones often bore signs of torn muscles. 
Despite these terrible realities, these early 
African Americans retained elements of their 
original cultures, such as decorating their teeth 
with distinctive filing patterns, and using West 
African motifs in decorating at least one coffin.
After analysis, in October 2003, the human 
remains were reburied. Excavating the site to 
learn about the lives of these largely forgotten 
slaves showed how archaeology can be rel-
evant in the real world, where slave descen-
dants powerfully felt the reconstruction of their 
ancestors’ stories. The African burial ground 
is now a national monument in downtown 
Manhattan. You can find out more at www.
nps.gov/afbg.

325
 Chapter 20: Stonehenge and You: Why Archaeology Matters
Studies of Dier el Medina’s graffiti, the quality of its pottery and the types of 
food people ate, and the afflictions and diseases revealed by their skeletons 
shows that Dier el Medina’s population included all kinds of tradespeople, 
such as masons to work the stone for the tombs, draftsmen to design them, 
artists to decorate them, and carpenters to work with wood. Work was gener-
ally plentiful because a new pharaoh’s first task was usually to command the 
design and building of elaborate tombs and temples.
Although pharaohs were buried in the tombs built by the citizens, citizens 
were buried in a graveyard just outside the town wall. Work group leaders 
and other people of relatively high status were sometimes buried beneath 
miniature pyramids, but most workers were buried in simple graves. Analysis 
of some bones has shown that workers received good medical care for the 
inevitable injuries received when working with heavy stone blocks. This 
consideration alone shows that the people of Dier el Medina weren’t slaves, 
because Egyptian slaves didn’t receive good medical treatment.
Skeletal analysis revealed that Dier el Medina was often mainly populated 
by women because males were off working on construction projects. And 
architectural analysis has shown that the town appears to have had its own 
judiciary system for solving disputes, and archaeologists have found ostraca 
bearing records of typical concerns: a minor theft, someone not paying for 
something, and so on.
When work was nearby, workers walked to the construction site in the morn-
ing and back home in the evenings. Each work group had a scribe who made 
sure that everyone showed up — these Egyptians were punching the clock 
just like many people do today. Thousands of clay jug pieces show that they 
also shared a love of a minor luxury: beer, one of Egypt’s greatest products. 
Once again, this is a detail often overlooked in official state records, but a 
facet of life that was important to the common person.
The archaeology of American slaves
As slave archaeology in the Americas continues to find and document sites, 
the details of lives long-forgotten will continue to emerge. Between the 1520s 
(when Africans were first brought to North America as slaves) and Abraham 
Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation freeing slaves held in territories still fighting the 
Union, at least half a million slaves were forcibly invited into North America. 
These ancestors of many African Americans today lived lives of terrible hard-
ship. Most never learned to read or write (at one point, teaching them was 
illegal), and what was written about them and their lives was rarely impartial. 
Some slave journals do exist in American history, but they’re pretty rare and 
tell only a little of the story. Archaeology helps to tell the rest.

326
Part IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
Reconstructing the lives of American slaves has been an important goal of 
many historical archaeologists over the last few decades. Many excavations 
have focused on slave quarters, often located on the edge of old plantations, 
far from the luxurious homes of their masters. Others, including excavations 
in Mississippi and Jamaica, have focused on the settlements established 
by maroons, which were escaped slaves. In fact, some archaeologists have 
shifted their focus away from enslavement and toward Africans’ freedom and 
resistance.
Excavations at George Washington’s estate at Mount Vernon, Virginia, have 
focused on a large house, near Washington’s own, that housed some of the 
60 to 80 slaves he owned at any given time. Artifacts found include buttons, 
probably indicating that some of these slaves wore somewhat finer European 
clothing than most, as well as a set of pottery of a style that had gone out 
of fashion; Washington probably gave the slaves this castoff set when he 
ordered newly fashionable Wedgewood ceramics from England. Further 
analysis at Mt. Vernon showed that slaves often ate from bowls rather than 
plates, suggesting stew-like foods; the small, highly-processed bones of 
animals, such as fish, beef, and pork, show that they often ate substandard 
foods. They apparently hunted to supplement their diet.
But these were the high-status slaves who lived near their master; life wasn’t 
the same for those who lived further away in small structures described by 
Polish visitor Julian Niemcewicz in 1798: “We entered one of the cabins of 
the Blacks, for one can not call them by the name of houses. They are more 
miserable than the cottages of our peasants. The husband and wife sleep on 
a mean pallet, the children on the ground; a very bad fireplace, some utensils 
for cooking, but in the middle of this poverty some cups and a teapot.”
Other important historical 
archaeology sites
In Peru, archaeologists have recently found evidence that conquistador 
Francisco Pizarro enlisted some native Peruvians to help in his conquest 
of the Incan empire. In a burial ground where more than 70 Incan skeletons 
were discovered, nearly half showed evidence of injury or death having come 
from native weapons rather than conquistador weapons. These new dis-
coveries confirm a previously held theory that Pizarro had some help from 
native Peruvians in conquering the Inca.
In December 2007, archaeologists using ground-penetrating radar discovered 
the remains of two Great Halls in southern Norway. Dating to around 700 to 
900 AD, the massive buildings would have been palaces where Viking kings 
lived, held court, entertained guests, and administered their kingdoms. This 
discovery requires historians to reevaluate the common concept that south-
ern Norway wasn’t a seat of power during the Viking age.

327
 Chapter 20: Stonehenge and You: Why Archaeology Matters
In the 13th century, several hundred Vikings settled in south Greenland, 
barely eking out a living as they farmed on the northernmost margin of the 
farmable world. They survived until around 1410, when suddenly mention of 
these settlements stops in all historical sources. Archaeologists have tried 
for decades to explain the disappearance of these settlements with theories 
as diverse as death by the Black Plague and murder by pirates or the native 
Inuit. Cemetery excavations have revealed a little evidence of interpersonal 
violence, with one man buried with a knife still imbedded in his body; how-
ever, this find isn’t evidence for widespread chaos.
Excavations of the farms have revealed that life slowly became worse for the 
Vikings as their livestock overgrazed the land. Excavations of houses showed 
that as the climate worsened, the Vikings put up walls inside their houses to 
make rooms smaller and easier to heat. One excavation showed that some 
Vikings ate their livestock one winter, which was unusual. But archaeologists 
haven’t found any mass graves, discounting the Black Plague as the killer of 
the Vikings. Similarly, no evidence of attack by either native Inuit or pirates 
has surfaced; rubble and unburied bodies are typical of such circumstances 
but were all absent. In the end, the Viking mystery appears to be solved: as 
the climate worsened (as evidenced by precise environmental records col-
lected from ice cores nearby), their farms simply failed. According to archae-
ologist Thomas McGovern, they failed to adapt to changing conditions, which 
they could have done by hunting seals like the Inuit.
Historical archaeology isn’t just limited to filling in gaps in the histories of 
specific groups of people. It can also clear up misconceptions about ancient 
humanity as a whole. For example, a lot of archaeological evidence contra-
dicts the idea that people in the ancient world lived in a state of noble har-
mony with nature and one another. In fact, warfare appears to have been a 
human occupation for a depressingly long time.
In Sudan, 14,000-year-old skeletons excavated in the 1960s have recently 
been reexamined and discovered to bear fractures and other evidence of 
interpersonal violence. At the site of Qermez Dere in Northern Iraq, discover-
ies of skeletons with violence-related injuries, defensive architecture, and 
war weapons all date to about 10,000 years ago. Australian rock art dated 
to 10,000 years ago depicts conflict between individuals, and by 6,000 years 
ago the depictions show large groups of individuals combating one another. 
And in China, 4,600-year-old farming villages have defensive architecture and 
scalped skeletons.
Widespread excavations in the Near and Middle East have shown that writing 
didn’t appear suddenly around 6,000 years ago, as many histories suggest, 
but as the result of a long evolution of longer-lasting communication systems 
that have roots going back to 9,000 years ago. The earliest writings appear to 
have been encoded on small clay tablets or tokens that early archaeologists 
dismissed as toys or gaming pieces. But new analysis — not believed by all 

328
Part IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
archaeologists — suggests these objects were the precursors to Sumerian 
cuneiform (the world’s earliest known writing system), which is found on 
thousands of clay tablets after 6,000 years ago.
Conversation Stoppers? Archaeology 
and the Unknown
People often theorize what’s best for mankind and base these theories on 
what they know of humanity’s past. “Well, if we ate the Palaeolithic (Stone 
Age) diet, we’d be just fine!” some may contend, as others lament that “We 
should never have come down from the trees in the first place.” Yet others 
may base their ideas of what men and women should do in the workplace on 
deeply held ideas about what people “have always done.”
In a lot of friendly discussions (which can become pretty heated because 
basic ideas of the past are at stake), people begin to look at the origins of 
things. Presumably, archaeology can serve as a guide. I often think these dis-
cussions could be smoothed out with a handy encyclopedia of archaeology, 
even if that encyclopedia had to often say, “We just don’t know yet.”
 
Just because archaeology hasn’t yet answered a question doesn’t mean the 
question is unanswerable. It will probably take time and energy; whole careers 
may be used just to answer simple questions about the past.
Archaeology can still be useful, even when it doesn’t provide concrete 
answers. For example, archaeology tells us that the idea of some ancient, 
pure Palaeolithic diet just isn’t possible. The Palaeolithic period (the “old 
stone age”) lasted for millions of years and was lived in by millions of hom-
inids across vast and diverse landscapes, and peoples’ diets would have 
reflected this diversity. Some Palaeolithic folks would have focused on 
hunting reindeer, or horses (like some European Neanderthals), and others 
may have had a broader diet; most foragers eat plenty of things other than 
mammal meat, including shellfish, nuts, fish, roots and tubers, and lots of 
other plant foods.
So what has archaeology done to (start to) answer some of the basic ques-
tions about the human past? In the following sections I want to show you the 
progress archaeologists have made toward answering two pretty big ques-
tions about fundamental aspects of humanity, even though they haven’t fully 
answered them yet. People have floated some good ideas, but none have con-
vinced all anthropologists that the essential questions have been answered.

329
 Chapter 20: Stonehenge and You: Why Archaeology Matters
Why did humanity take up farming?
Farming (which you can read much, much more about in Chapter 9) is a 
way of making a living based on raising plants and animals for food. It’s only 
about 10,000 years old and was invented after humans had spent millions of 
years as foragers. The obvious question is what compelled people to give up 
foraging and take up living in one place? Naturally, the world has turned to 
archaeologists to answer this question; because farming was invented long 
before writing, only archaeologists are equipped to investigate it.
But not even archaeologists are sure — or, more specifically, they think they 
may know, but they aren’t sure yet. None of their models seems to explain 
the advent of farming worldwide. Although archaeologists still don’t know 
why farming originated, they’ve at least proven the following theories, once 
accepted, as false:
 
 Farming is the easiest way to live: Foragers have a good living; in fact, 
they have less work than most farmers and also have better health than 
the first farmers.
 
 Farming is the most efficient way to use the land: This statement 
assumes that foraging isn’t efficient, which just isn’t true. If foragers 
keep their populations low and remain mobile, they very efficiently uti-
lize their landscapes.
 
 Farming is part of civilization, and all societies are on a single track 
evolving towards civilization: Each human society has its own adaptive 
solutions to its environments, and no internal engine drives all humans 
towards being farmers or anything else.
How did humans go from having 
leaders to having rulers?
Another big question: How is it that human societies went from being led 
(by someone who has the group’s best interest at heart) to being ruled (by a 
tyrant who’s mainly looking out for number one)? Why put up with tyrants in 
the first place? Archaeologists have tackled this topic as well, striking down 
other theories:
 
 Social hierarchies are part of civilization, and all societies in the past 
were on the single track towards civilization: Stop me if you’ve heard 
this one, but all societies aren’t on the same track toward any ideal 
state. Archaeology has shown that each society worldwide has found its 
own ways to survive, and the idea that the same engine drives them all 
just doesn’t fly.

330
Part IV: So What? Anthropology, the Modern World, and You 
 
 Humans are inherently hierarchical: This statement may actually be 
true — all primates have pretty rigidly structured societies that include 
some degree of status recognition. However, many human societies 
have managed to remain egalitarian, meaning that all members of the 
culture have basically the same rights and the same access to resources; 
although egalitarian societies do have to work to prevent individuals 
from gaining power, they manage to do it. Unfortunately, this presents 
an entirely new question: In societies that are now ruled, how did this 
egalitarian mindset get overturned in the first place?
As you can see, archaeology can answer a lot of questions, but it hasn’t 
answered them all. It also introduces more questions that need answer-
ing as well. And this is good news for archaeologists because it keeps them 
employed.
Does history repeat itself?
History, people often say, repeats itself. And looking at the historical records 
of the ancient civilizations, some things do seem to happen again and again: 
Civilizations expand, get overextended, and then collapse (as in the cases of 
Rome, which went under in 476 AD, and the British Empire, which fell apart 
more than a thousand years later in the post-WWII era.
But is this always the case? If so, archaeology would be pretty boring; one 
thing would happen again and again. But that’s not what archaeologists see. 
Some civilizations end abruptly, like the Aztec and Inca, conquered by invad-
ers in the 1520s AD; those empires never had the chance to collapse as a 
result of overexpansion. So in the case of civilizations, “history repeats itself” 
seems to be an oversimplification.
The statement has another problem: What about prehistory? What does it 
say about the millions of years of human or at least proto-human life that pre-
ceded historical records? As an archaeologist, I can tell you that prehistory 
says very little about those millions of years. Archaeology, then, has shown 
that this short and somewhat satisfying statement may be true about some 
things, but it’s just too short, too “bumper-sticker” to account for the whole 
human story.

Ten Things to Remember 
about Anthropology, 
Whatever Else You Forget
In This Chapter
 Recalling the main messages of anthropology
 Dispelling some anthropological myths
C
an a person boil the results of a four-field academic discipline over 100 
years old down to ten statements? Well, I’m going to try. For me, these 
are the most important lessons of anthropology to date.
We’re Not Just Like Apes, We ARE Apes
Humans aren’t mineral or vegetable, so we must be animal; of the animals, 
we’re clearly members of the primate order. Forget monkeys and small, cat-
like prosimians — genetically and anatomically, we humans are clearly most 
like the living apes, the chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon. And 
although we diverged from them millions of years ago, we don’t just look like 
them — we share much of their DNA. For all practical purposes, we are apes. 
(For more on our simian brethren, check out Chapter 4.)
Nobody Knows Why Hominids 
First Walked Upright (Yet)
Although someday anthropologists may find good evidence for exactly why 
hominids first walked upright, at the moment they just don’t know. (You can 
read about some theories in Chapter 6.) What they do know is that bipedalism 

334
Part V: The Part of Tens 
would have presented early hominids with both pros and cons including (but 
not limited to) the following:
 
 Pro: Ability to stand and look over tall grasses
 
 Pro: Ability to carry items such as tools
 
 Con: Less able to climb (to escape predation) than before
 
 Con: Slower and less maneuverable than main predators (like big cats)
Remember, just because anthropologists don’t know why hominids started 
walking on two legs doesn’t mean they can’t know, and it also doesn’t mean 
that all theories are equally valid.
Everyone Is in the Human Race
Biologically speaking, race is a slippery concept. Individuals capable of 
mating and having offspring that are themselves healthy enough to have off-
spring are considered members of the same species. Races or subsets exist 
within species — like different breeds of dogs, or people of slightly different 
skin colors or hair types — but, biologically speaking, these differences are 
quite insignificant. That hasn’t stopped humanity from making a big deal out 
of the differences between, say, native Africans and native Europeans and 
using those differences for all manner of mischief. But it’s all smoke and mir-
rors, from racial stereotyping to misguided attempts to engineer so-called 
super races. Everyone is in the human species, Homo sapiens sapiens. I dis-
cuss the intricacies of race in more detail in Chapter 14.
Tool Use Separated Behavior 
from Anatomy
For every living species aside from humanity, evolution is a matter of how 
well the body fits the environment. Complex behaviors can help nonhumans 
survive, of course, but for most animals anatomy pretty well constrains 
behavior. In stark contrast, humans make and use tools (and have done so 
for at least 2.5 million years) to allow survival in situations where the body 
couldn’t normally survive; that is, humans have severed the anatomical 
bonds of their behavior by relying on tools rather than their bodies. Now 
that’s what I call food for thought! Head to Chapter 6 for more on tools and 
behavior.

335
 Chapter 21: Ten Things to Remember about Anthropology
Civilization Is Brand-New
From about 2 million years ago to about 10,000 years ago, humans didn’t 
plant crops and raise animals; as a species we foraged, or hunted and gath-
ered, for our calories, water, and nutrients on a daily basis. Lacking substan-
tial storage technologies, our ancestors had to keep moving around their 
resource landscapes, which prevented the rise of cities or even villages. For 
most of our ancestors, life was a trek across vast landscapes in a continual 
food quest.
But the way people live today — moving thousands of miles per year in cars, 
freely choosing from various religions, even voting to choose their leaders 
(more or less) — is an extremely new way for humanity to live; for millennia, 
humans were hunter-gatherers (which I discuss in the next section), and even 
in the ancient civilizations things were very different. The ancient civiliza-
tions were dynasties, ruled for centuries and longer by royal families control-
ling the fates of millions, enslaving further millions, and dictating everything 
from taxes to worship schedules to the kinds of clothing people of different 
social ranks could wear. Today’s new civilization has many problems, but it 
has largely solved some as well. Check out Chapter 10 for the lowdown on 
civilization.
There Are Many Ways to Be Human
At its most basic level, being human is having modern anatomy and using 
symbolism, and these have been with us for at least the last 50,000 years. 
And every human today, from China to Nigeria to Finland, is equally human. 
Although humans everywhere have adapted their cultures to new circum-
stances by devising, inventing, and evolving different ways to survive, ulti-
mately each of these cultures is just another variation on the human theme, 
another way of being human.
Culture Doesn’t Ride on Genes
Culture — the whole set of ideas about what the universe is like and what 
you’re supposed to do about it — isn’t encoded in your genes. It’s not passed 
on biologically but rather socially through language. Culture is transferred 
from one generation to the next largely through written and spoken words. 
And because studies have shown that language isn’t hard-wired — any 
healthy human infant can learn any human language by about three years 
of age — culture clearly isn’t hard-wired either. An infant born in Japan but 
quickly moved to Denmark will grow up Danish, not Japanese. Chapter 11 
deals with culture in more detail.

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Language and Metaphor Are 
the Keys to Human Success
Although lots of animals communicate in all kinds of ways — using scent, 
bodily postures, and even sounds — human communication by spoken lan-
guage is particularly fast and conveys more information (and more subtle 
information) than any other system of communication. Importantly, human 
language also uses metaphor, in which one word can have several meanings. 
This flexibility in communication has many effects, one of the most impor-
tant of which is the fact that no two humans are identical in their thoughts. 
Because each mind interprets the language in slightly different ways, humans 
are distinctive and individualistic and not interchangeable automatons, a fact 
that has its own effects on the shape of human culture. Clearly, language is 
central to what it means to be human. See Chapter 13 for a more complete 
discussion of language.
Absolutely, There Are No Absolutes
Being human is a messy business; try as they might, anthropologists have 
had a hard time making any but the most basic universal statements about 
the biology or behavior of members of the human species. Yes, every society 
has rules for marriage, but they vary from polyandry (multiple husbands to 
one wife) to polygyny (multiple wives for one husband). Yes, every society 
traces biological descent — but the processes vary from matrilineal (tracing 
descent through the female line) to patrilineal (tracing through the male line). 
And so on. Humanity is characterized by diversity; themes and patterns do 
emerge, but not much is written in stone.
There Is No Ladder of Progress
For a long time, people thought that all human societies were evolving in the 
same direction, climbing a ladder of progress that passed through the stages 
of Savagery and Barbarism to finally arrive at the pinnacle of Civilization. But 
as it turns out, each society is really on its own path and has its own solutions 
to survival, and you just can’t compare one culture to another anthropologi-
cally. Now, this doesn’t mean that all cultures are perfectly adapted to their 
environments; some cultures clearly have self-destructive habits, and I person-
ally think having a Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a good thing (see 
the sidebar “The Universal Declaration of Human Rights” in this chapter). Still, 
anthropology has found that cross-cultural comparisons have more to do with 
justifying colonialism or imperialism than honest recognition of the fact that 
over many millennia, humanity has found many ways be human. Check out 
Chapter 17 for more on cultural diversity and human rights.

337
 Chapter 21: Ten Things to Remember about Anthropology
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
In 1948, the United Nations — an organization 
founded to foster international cooperation 
during World War II — presented the world with 
its Universal Declaration of Human Rights, call-
ing on all member countries “to cause it to be 
disseminated, displayed, read and expounded 
principally in schools and other educational 
institutions, without distinction based on the 
political status of countries or territories.” 
Among the 30 articles of the Declaration are 
the following:
  Article 1: All human beings are born free 
and equal in dignity and rights. They are 
endowed with reason and conscience and 
should act toward one another in a spirit of 
brotherhood.
  Article 4. No one shall be held in slavery or 
servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall 
be prohibited in all their forms.
  Article 16.1. Men and women of full age, 
without any limitation due to race, national-
ity or religion, have the right to marry and 
to found a family. They are entitled to equal 
rights as to marriage, during marriage and 
at its dissolution.
You can imagine that even as well-meaning as 
they truly are, some of these articles can be 
subject to some debate regarding definitions. 
This discrepancy emphasizes the importance 
of intercultural understanding generated by 
understanding the lessons of anthropology 
themselves.

Chapter 22
Ten Great Careers for 
Anthropology Majors
In This Chapter
 Identifying some good careers for people interested in any of the four fields of 
anthropology
 Looking at the educational requirements of anthropological careers
W
hat can anyone do with a degree in anthropology? Can you actually 
have a career in studying humanity? Sure you can. Here are ten sug-
gestions. Personally, I think that if you’re fascinated by the human species 
and your passion is studying humanity, you should find a way to make a 
living at it.
Academic Anthropology
If you’re really hooked on the study of humanity, you need to know two 
things: You’ll need a PhD, and you’ll need to specialize in one of the four main 
fields of anthropology. Remember, the field has four main divisions:
 
 Physical (or biological) anthropology: The study of human biology and 
biological evolution through fossils and (increasingly) DNA
 
 Linguistic anthropology: The study of human communication
 
 Cultural (or social) anthropology: The study of living human societies 
through participant observation
 
 Archaeology: The study of the human past through the remains of 
ancient people and their civilizations
Academic anthropologists in any of these fields normally work in a Department 
of Anthropology at a college or university. Being a professor requires a PhD 
and is normally a career-long decision because the PhD can take so much time 

340
Part V: The Part of Tens 
and effort to earn. The jobs are scarce and include a lot more than just teach-
ing and research, but if you’re hooked, this is one way to go. Be prepared to 
work long and hard for the coveted title of professor.
Cultural/Human Resources
Increasingly, corporate America is recognizing the value of improving inter-
cultural communication in its growing multicultural workforce. Students 
interested in cultural anthropology and working with people may be inter-
ested in careers in cultural or human resources, facilitating and improving 
workplace communication and understanding. For this career, a bachelor’s 
degree in anthropology may be sufficient, but increasingly a master’s degree 
is necessary.
Medical Examination
The popularity of crime novels and TV shows in America reveals a deep inter-
est in human fallibility and the solving of mysteries. Many of my students 
tell me they’re interested in becoming a medical examiner, a profession that 
investigates the cause of a human’s death in detail. The road to becoming an 
ME is long and difficult, but I imagine it could be a very rewarding career for 
the right person. Although requirements vary, most MEs need a bachelor’s 
degree (a BS in anthropology with a focus on physical anthropology would 
be perfect), then a medical degree, and then several years of post-MD train-
ing focusing on pathology. So, this career track isn’t for everyone, but it’s a 
possibility for those dedicated to understanding this facet of humanity. Try 
checking out www.thename.org/, the Web site for the National Association 
of Medical Examiners.
Crime Scene Investigation
Anthropology students who focus on physical anthropology, particularly 
human skeletal anatomy, are well-prepared for further training as a crime 
scene investigator (CSI) who specializes in documenting and investigating 
crime scenes involving human remains. A bachelor’s degree is normally suffi-
cient to begin the CSI certification process. Still, most CSIs are actually police 
officers who apply for the CSI position after a few years on the force (accord-
ing to the International Crime Scene Investigators Association — check out 
www.icsia.org/, the association’s Web site). Still, I feel a good background 
in human culture and anatomy must be a good background for anyone inter-
ested in law enforcement careers, particularly when that law enforcement 
has to do with human beings.

341
 Chapter 22: Ten Great Careers for Anthropology Majors
Primate Biology
Zoos, research facilities, and other places that maintain populations of nonhu-
man primates all employ biologists to maintain the primates’ health and well-
being. Although you must consider serious ethical concerns — conditions for 
the primates are better today than they have been in the past, but many abuses 
continue — you could argue that primate biologists are in the best position to 
better conditions from the inside. Primate biologists require a graduate degree 
in biology, but a good start would be a bachelor’s degree in anthropology with 
a focus on physical anthropology, particularly the physical anthropology of the 
nonhuman primates.
Primate Ethology
Zoos, research facilities, and other places that maintain populations of non-
human primates also employ ethologists to study nonhuman primate behav-
ior. (Ethology is the study of nonhuman animal behavior.) The same ethical 
considerations apply here as to primate biologist. Primate ethologists will 
need a graduate degree in biology (focusing on nonhuman primate ethology) 
or anthropology (focusing on the same field).
Diplomacy
Anthropology students focusing on cultural anthropology are good candi-
dates for careers in international relations and conflict resolution, and it 
seems clear enough that humanity could use a lot of that. The lessons of 
anthropology include statements about our unity as a species, the impor-
tance of genuine mutual respect between cultures, and recognition of some 
absurdities and aberrations like racism and slavery. (See Chapter 21 for a 
discussion of anthropology’s most important lessons.) These ideas shouldn’t 
be based on political grounds but on what we know of what it is to be human. 
The field of conflict resolution is new and thriving and may be particularly 
good for anthropology majors wanting to pursue graduate degrees that take 
advantage of the anthropological perspective.
Museum Work
Lots of anthropology graduates find positions in museums and historical 
societies managing collections of old documents and artifacts. For these 
positions, a general interest in the past, facilitated by an anthropological 
appreciation for the ancient past of our species, could be a good foundation. 

342
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Get started as early as possible by taking internship positions in museums 
and libraries while you’re an undergraduate to get a feel for what the work is 
really like.
Library Science
Because anthropology is such a massive field, with interests in so many 
facets of human existence, anthropology students tend to be Jacks- (or Jills-) 
of-all-trades. They tend to have a good knowledge of where to go for informa-
tion, and this quality can be a big advantage in working in libraries. A bache-
lor’s degree in anthropology can be a good background for getting a master’s 
in Library Science (MLS), which is commonly necessary for higher positions 
in library work in the United States.
Contract Archaeology
Contract archaeologists work for private firms hired to evaluate whether con-
struction projects will harm archaeological sites. They form a large portion 
of the professional archaeologists in the U.S., and, as opposed to academic 
archaeologists, they don’t necessarily need a PhD. You’ll need a master’s 
degree in the field of archaeology, focusing on Cultural Resource Management 
(CRM). A bachelor’s degree will be sufficient if you want to excavate for only a 
few years, but moving up into administrative positions will most likely require 
the MA. A PhD can be useful but isn’t necessarily required.
The American Anthropological Association on 
careers in anthropology
The American Anthropological Association 
is a professional society founded to promote 
the results and study of anthropology. About 
careers in anthropology, the AAA says, “More 
than 350 U.S. colleges and universities offer 
an undergraduate major in anthropology, and 
many more offer coursework. Because the 
subject matter of anthropology is so broad, an 
undergraduate major or concentration can be 
part of a broad liberal arts background for men 
and women interested in medicine, government, 
business, and law. More information on college 
and university anthropology can be found in the 
American Anthropological Association’s AAA 
Guide, published yearly.”

and job databases.

Ten Great Anthropologically 
Themed Movies and Books
In This Chapter
 Looking at some fictionalized big-screen anthropology
 Checking out some anthropology-related documentaries
 Heading to the library for some great anthropological fiction and nonfiction
W
e humans are fascinated by ourselves, and the themes and findings of 
anthropology have permeated our popular culture. In this chapter I 
recommend ten of my favorite anthropologically themed books and movies. 
I give each of them two thumbs up.
Once We Were Warriors (1995)
This film, produced and set in modern New Zealand, follows the story of an 
urban Maori (native New Zealander) family struggling to overcome addic-
tions and poverty, problems common to native people worldwide who have 
been moved from their ancestral lands to city environments. In the film, as 
in real life, one solution to these problems is a reconnection with traditional 
values and culture. The film’s scenes of grinding poverty and violence can be 
hard to watch, but they’re a reality. Directed by Lee Tamahori.
Gorillas in the Mist: The Story 
of Dian Fossey (1988)
This Hollywood film depicts part of the career of Dian Fossey, one of the 
three main women in living-ape studies. Fossey, played by Sigourney Weaver, 
diligently (or obsessively, depending on your perspective) studies gorillas in 

344
Part V: The Part of Tens 
central Africa, eventually spending as much time trying to protect them from 
poachers as study them. Fossey was murdered in 1985, and the scene depict-
ing this event in the film leaves the mystery open; to date, nobody has been 
charged with her death. Directed by Michael Apted.
Neanderthal (2005)
This BBC production for the television series Horizon presents some of the 
most interesting recent work on just what the Neanderthals were and how 
they may have become extinct. Of course, the documentary contains lots 
of theories, and each one will have some palaeoanthropologist or another 
shaking her head; however, this movie demonstrates how ingenious anthro-
pologists are with the bits of archaeology used to reconstruct the past and 
both how much and how little they really know. Some of the most prominent 
Neanderthal researchers appear in the video, which includes many realistic 
reconstructions of Neanderthal life. Directed by Cameron Balbirnie.
Quest for Fire (1982)
This French-produced film follows the lives of a band of hunter–gatherers 
attempting to find a new source of fire after their own is catastrophically 
snuffed out. The film is pretty dramatic, and many archaeologists would 
cringe at some of the technical details. Nevertheless, the film is thought-
provoking and I think in many ways a good depiction of what foraging life 
was like for our ancestors many thousands of years ago. Directed by 
Jean-Jacques Annaud.
Koyaanisqatsi (1982)
This film, with no narration or script, is an audio-visual meditation on human-
ity and its relationship to the natural world. By simply showing scenes of 
that natural world, with and without humanity, and then scenes of humanity 
alone without apparent connections to the natural world, the film forces you 
to think deeply about what our species is, for better and worse. Powaqqatsi, a 
later film in the same trilogy, focuses more on humanity than Koyaanisqatsi. 
Both films directed by Godfrey Reggio.

345
 Chapter 23: Ten Great Anthropologically Themed Movies and Books
The Places in Between (2006)
This book traces Scotsman Rory Stewart’s adventurous walk across 
Afghanistan in 2002. Yes, that Afghanistan, in 2002, with the Taliban holding 
sway in many regions. But most of the people Stewart meets aren’t Taliban 
members; they’re Afghan peasants who want to live the way they have 
lived for centuries, and he finds their attitudes of hospitality and generosity 
nearly everywhere he goes. He also comes across the remains of an ancient 
city being looted by pot hunters, the description of which is tremendous. 
The Places in Between won several awards and was on the New York Times 
Top Book Review list for 2006. Stewart has also published The Prince of the 
Marshes about his time in Iraq.
Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (1993)
In this grand tour of the human species, the late, great astronomer Carl Sagan 
and his still-living wife, Ann Druyan, bring the reader from the origins of life 
up to the present day, beautifully and accurately describing the fascinating 
details of every aspect of being human, from DNA to cell division to primate 
behavior and human evolution. Although some elements of the book are out 
of date today, none of these are critical errors that lead the reader astray; 
most of what the authors present here is profound and timeless.
Anyone enjoying this book will probably also like Cosmos, Sagan’s 1980 TV 
series (cowritten with Stephen Soter and Ann Druyan). It’s the most humanis-
tic perspective on the cosmos, and humanity’s place in it, that I’ve ever seen. 
It’s recently been digitally remastered from the original, 25-part TV series. 
Directed by Adrian Malone.
Maps and Dreams (1981; 
2nd edition 2002)
Writer-anthropologist Hugh Brody recounts his travels and investigations 
of the vast sub-Arctic regions of Canada in this beautifully-written book that 
puts the reader right on the tundra. This book made me realize just how 
important it is as an archaeologist to be careful about how much I believed in 
models (mine or anyone else’s) about human behavior in the ancient world. 
The decisions that Brody’s native hunting informants make — about hunting 
or anything else — are affected by subtle but powerful cultural factors that 
can be difficult to imagine.

346
Part V: The Part of Tens 
We, the Navigators: The Ancient Art 
of Landfinding in the Pacific 
(1972; 2nd edition 1998)
David Lewis-Williams was a sailor and amateur anthropologist fascinated 
by traditional Polynesian navigation methods, including steering craft by 
the stars and detecting far-off islands by cloud formations and swells in the 
ocean. He spent years learning these methods among the traditional naviga-
tors of the Pacific. His book details these astounding methods and is sure to 
thrill and educate anyone interested in Polynesia, ancient sailing, or details of 
how human cultures have adapted to life on the Pacific. Some of the methods 
Lewis-Williams describes are probably more than 3,000 years old, originat-
ing when the first Lapita people began to colonize the Western Pacific from 
Southeast Asia.
Lord of the Flies (1954)
In this novel by William Golding, a group of young boys stranded on an island 
try to build a society without any parental guidance. Golding uses this sce-
nario to speculate on how human society would naturally shape up if boys 
old enough to have ideas about how culture “should” be arranged were iso-
lated in a cultureless area. Whether or not Golding accurately depicts human 
nature, this book is thought-provoking and forces readers to ask themselves 
what human nature really is. Is it a product of our surroundings, or is it more 
deeply rooted in the fact that we’re basically large social primates? The book 
was adapted into films in 1963 (directed by Peter Brook) and 1990 (directed 
by Harry Hook.)
