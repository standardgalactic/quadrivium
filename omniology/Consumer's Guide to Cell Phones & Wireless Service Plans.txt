About GetConnected, Inc.
Founded in 1999, GetConnected, Inc. provides a suite of software
tools that facilitate the sale of wireless, broadband, local phone, long
distance, cable, and satellite television services.
The Telecommunications Deregulation Act of 1996 was the cata-
lyst for a proliferation of telecommunications services which made
the process of selecting the best providers and plans a daunting task
for consumers.The Internet offered a tremendous opportunity for
consumers to easily ﬁnd and compare all options available to them
and make the right choice through an informative and intuitive elec-
tronic shopping process.The Internet was also the ideal medium to
help telecommunications service providers cost effectively acquire
customers. www.GetConnected.com resulted from the conﬂuence
of these three market forces.
Named by Newsweek as one of the 103 Best Web Sites and by PC
World as Best Cell Phone Site, GetConnected.com, the showcase of
the GetConnected functionality, is an easy-to-use Web site that
empowers users with the information necessary to help them select
the services that best meet their individual needs. In addition to being
a source of the most comprehensive and accurate information avail-
able, the GetConnected site, shopping technology and transaction
processing capability make the purchase process simple and straight-
forward. Consumers are shown all plans, products, and special offers
available in their area. GetConnected.com also provides highly intu-
itive and interactive wizards and bill calculators that allow the user to
customize searches and make it easier to locate and buy the most
suitable plans.The end result? Consumers get the most for their
telecommunication dollar.
GetConnected, Inc. offers consumers and small businesses access to
its services directly through its Web site www.GetConnected.com, and
through a network of partner Web sites. Consumers will also be able to
access the GetConnected telecommunication shopping services in pri-
vate labeled applications at retail, where GetConnected will power the
shopping experience and order processing for its retail partners.

Exploring Domestic
Roaming Options
As with any other
calling feature, prices
and options for
domestic roaming vary
by where you live and
which service provider
you choose. If you are
the type of person that
travels within the
United States quite
often, you should look
for a plan that offers
the following:
• Coverage with no
roaming costs in the
cities and towns
from which you will
be making your calls.
• Low roaming costs
per minute with
roaming coverage in
all the areas to
which you will travel.
• A service that will
work when outside
your home area at all
times. Some new
wireless services offer
unlimited local calling
for a ﬂat fee per
month but do not
offer the ability to
roam outside of your
local area.

Telecommunications consumers are paying between 50% and 500% too
much every month for the services that keep them in touch, in-tune, and
informed.Why would anyone pay $0.30 per minute for long distance when
they could pay just $0.05? The answer is because there has not been a good
way to determine the correct services based on the way you use your
phone, or your high-speed Internet access, or your wireless phone.
The Consumer’s Guide to Wireless Phones and Service Plans will help you
determine what you need in a wireless phone and service plan.The infor-
mation in this Guide is compiled from the data that GetConnected, Inc.
collects directly from the wireless service providers and the tools that we
have developed to help direct you to the perfect plan and phone. On our
Web site, www.GetConnected.com, you can easily compare the data side by
side and use these tools to optimize your choices. Both on our Web site and
in this book, we help lead you through the maze of offerings based on how
you will use your phone to make sure that you spend wisely to take advan-
tage of today’s great wireless services.
There is no reason that you should buy a $200 phone and pay $75 per
month if you only need to use your phone in the case of an emergency.Are
you a techno-savvy road warrior or a minimalist? Do you need a wireless
phone that lets you read and send e-mail or do you just need it to call for
roadside assistance? Will you use your phone only as you drive around your
town or will you need it to work in Paris? All these questions will be
answered to make sure you buy the phone and service plan that are right
for you.
Wireless is everywhere—if you don’t own a wireless phone, you have
probably used one. If you haven’t used a wireless phone, you most certainly
have seen people using them.The number of people in the United States who
own wireless phones is well over 100 million and growing steadily.At around
40% to 50% U.S. market penetration, we are actually behind most European
countries. In Finland, the home country of Nokia, the leading wireless phone
manufacturer, over 70% of people own wireless phones.Today’s wireless
phones can give you access to the Internet, e-mail, your calendar from work,

Chapter 1 • How to Choose a Wireless Phone and Service
Introduction
The only answer to the question “Which wireless phone should I buy?”
is, unfortunately,“It depends.”There are so many choices out there today
that the only way to select the perfect phone for you is to look at many
different factors—put yourself in the middle of the process and ﬁgure out
how you will use the phone, where and when you will make most of
your calls, and how much you want to spend.
The ﬁrst thing to realize is that the phone is only as good as the
network on which it works. In the “old days” of wireless, a single phone
would work on either of the two cellular networks. So, when you
plunked down your $1000 for that huge phone and another $80 per
month with wireless carrier A, if you did not ﬁnd their service to your
liking, you could walk across the street to their only competitor and
switch to the competitor’s network using the same phone.That doesn’t
work any more.
In the early 1990s, competitors for the two original cellular compa-
nies started to spring up—they were called PCS or Personal
Communication Services carriers.The only difference between cellular
and PCS is that cellular started out transmitting your call using analog
technology and PCS started out using all digital transmissions. Cellular
companies have all gone over to digital technologies (see Chapter 2,
“Analog, Digital—What’s the Difference?” for more information on
analog versus digital technologies), so there really is no difference
between the original cellular carriers and the newer totally digital PCS
carriers any more. One of the things that digital technology allows the
carriers to do is to sell phones that will work only on their network—so
the days of walking across the street to sign up on someone else’s net-
work with the same phone are pretty much gone.
Thinking about making the switch to wireless full time and
ditching your home phone completely? Well, you are not alone, but you
are among a small group of techno-savvy users who are foregoing the
wires for the freedom of wireless.And why not? If you buy a wireless
plan with 3000 minutes of use included, you have to use them some
time, right? Just beware the pitfalls discussed in Chapter 13,“The
Future of Wireless.” So, what factors do you need to consider when
buying that perfect wireless phone? There are basically six steps that we
will detail in this chapter:
www.getconnected.com

www.getconnected.com
1.
Look for service providers with Coverage in your area—
Where will you use your phone and which wireless carrier has
the best service there?
2.
Choose the wireless Phone you want and/or need—Do you
need all the latest options or do you just need to make calls in
an emergency?
3.
Make sure you know how you will Use your wireless
phone—How many minutes will you use each month and at
what time of the day will you use the most minutes? Will you
call locally or long distance?
4.
Be aware of how much buying and using wireless will Cost—
How much are you willing to spend on the monthly service
and on the phone?
5.
Look for special Promotions—Are there any great deals out
there that will get you the best deal for the right phone and
plan?
6.
Don’t forget your Accessories—Will you need to use a
headset for your car, do you need a belt clip or extra batteries?

In the Beginning: 
An Introduction to Wireless
Think of the walkie-talkie as the electronic equivalent of taking your
ﬁrst step. For many of us, it was our ﬁrst introduction into the world of
wireless technology. Bewildering and exciting, but more importantly,
proof that even at an early age, humankind possessed some sort of
inherent need to ﬁnd new ways to communicate.The walkie-talkie was
wildly successful.

Chapter 1 • How to Choose a Wireless Phone and Service
Fast-forward a few years and we’ve grown into a more dependable
adult version of the walkie-talkie called the cordless phone—a true
introduction to what has permeated our lifestyles at home, work, and
play. But limitations of physical distance prevented us from taking the
cordless on the road until miraculously, the cellular, or wireless, phone
appeared and now it’s a vicious game of catch-up to understand what
wireless means to the average Joe.
The Basics
Today’s cellular service operates on much the same principle as our ear-
lier walkie-talkie devices.Your voice is still transmitted through the air
from point A to point B, but that’s where most of the similarities end.
With cellular technology, messages sound clearer, travel farther, and
are received by the second party (with a little luck) as if we were next
door.And it’s all done through a network built by breaking a geographic
region into small areas called cells, which include the cellular antennas.
Calls are transmitted from the antenna to the wired telephone system
until it reaches the target audience on the other end.The term cellular is
often used to refer to “traditional cellular” or analog technology (AMPS
or Advanced Mobile Phone Service), which utilized a network built at
800 MHz by two service providers, or carriers, in each market.This
simply means that 800 MHz is the wavelength or frequency at which
your voice travels from your phone to the antenna. It also assures you that
whether calling from the beach or from a trafﬁc jam, potentially life-
altering commands like “half pepperoni” will be heard at the other end.
The Digital Age
Just when you think that you’ve got a pretty good handle on what analog
is all about, digital technology joins the party.This essentially means a
second wireless technology; new terminology, products, and services; yet
another learning curve; as well as up to ﬁve or six new competitors in
each market. But the principle between analog and digital remains basi-
cally the same.The two most signiﬁcant differences are that calls now
travel at a frequency of either 800 MHz or 1900MHz and, unlike analog,
the digital network breaks down the sender’s voice into binary code,
transmits it as data, and reassembles it on the other end.These digital net-
works usually are referred to as Personal Communications Service (PCS)

networks, although the traditional cellular carriers also offer digital ser-
vice, and sometimes call their digital service PCS, also.The relevance of
these changes to the every-day consumer is that this break-through affects
everything from call quality to network access, and features like caller ID,
Internet access, and extended battery life.
Getting Started
Getting ﬁtted for a wireless service provider, plan, and a compatible
phone is as easy as doing some painless homework before you buy.
We’ve made the following descriptions as clear as possible for you to
understand before you make an educated buying decision, get hooked
up, charge your battery, and get ready for the air waves.To make sure
you have all the latest, up-to-date phone and plan information, you
should use online resources like www.GetConnected.com, the leading
communication resource with exhaustive lists of plans and services that
empower you, the user, to make the right decision for your lifestyle.
CHOOSE A SERVICE PLAN THAT BEST MEETS YOUR
DAY-TO-DAY NEEDS
How many calls will I make each day? Where will I call—local or
long distance? Will I travel out of my local area with my phone? Do
I need my phone to act as a pager, also? Make sure your service
plan and your phone meet your day-to-day needs.
I
Usage When will you use your phone? This can be a real
money-saving decision. Most wireless networks operate at or
near capacity during peak business hours, and carriers typi-
cally charge users for every second they tie up a circuit. If you
use your cellular phone heavily at night and on weekends,
many carriers cater to that need by offering off-peak specials
of 300, 500, or even 1000 minutes of evening and weekend
calling for a nominal fee with the purchase of a standard ser-
vice plan.These packages can be real money savers if used as
intended, but beware: different providers deﬁne peak, off-
peak, and weekend hours differently.

Traveling/Roaming Do you travel a lot? If you travel
outside of your local/home area or service provider net-
work, you can incur roaming charges, which means a sur-
charge will be applied for calls made and received while out
of your home area and your local rate plan costs no longer
apply.The good news is that most carriers have plans that
cover beyond your local calling area. From regional plans
(i.e., Northeast,West Coast, etc.) to national plans, the
monthly fees generally are based on the size of the coverage
area, and, though more expensive each month than local
plans, these plans can be worth it if you expect to incur
expensive roaming fees.
I
Traveling Abroad U.S. digital phones are mostly incom-
patible with worldwide networks except for parts of
Mexico and Canada, where some of the same technology
standards are used. If your phone has analog capability (i.e.,
it is an analog-only or dual/tri-mode phone), it could work
in some Caribbean countries, although it may not receive
calls. Europe and parts of Asia use mainly a standardized
digital network called GSM. Phones built with GSM tech-
nology can access the network, regardless of the caller’s
country of origin, although each wireless carrier has their
own charges for roaming into other countries and the
phone has to be programmed to work at the frequency of
that country.
Assessing Your Coverage Needs
You may have seen the coolest phone being used by your best friend
yesterday, but unless you have wireless coverage where you are going to
use your phone, it may end up being an expensive paperweight.There
are many ways to ﬁnd out which wireless carriers offer service in your
area—TV and newspaper ads, junk mail and inserts, and online sites
that show you the coverage maps for each company (see Chapter 9,
“Service Providers and Service Areas” for detailed maps).The problem
with all these indicators of the companies that say they offer service at
your house is that you don’t truly know how their service works where
you want it to work just by looking at a map.

Your Friends Are Your Best Resource
The best way to tell who has the best coverage where you need it
(home, school, work, downtown, etc.) is to talk to your friends. Even if
you call each wireless carrier in your area (up to seven or eight compa-
nies!), they will, of course, tell you that they have the best coverage
exactly where you need it—even though they may have minimal cov-
erage there.There is nothing more frustrating than buying a phone
with a zillion included minutes for $25 per month when you cannot
use it anywhere you want to use it.
The questions to ask your friends about their wireless phones
should be about their experiences with their phones speciﬁcally where
you want to use yours.Ask if the calls were clear or if they were hard to
hear (a sign of poor coverage).Ask if they had trouble making the call
and received many busy signals (a sign of low capacity—not many
people can make calls at the same time). Here are some starting places:
1.
Can you use your phone in your house?
2.
Can you use your phone in your ofﬁce?
3.
Can you use your phone in school?
4.
Does your call ever get disconnected or “drop” when you are
traveling—if so where?
5.
Can you use your phone reliably any time of the day or do
you get busy signals at certain times, like heavy commuter
times (7 A.M. to 9 A.M. or 4:30 P.M. to 7 P.M.)?
6.
Does your phone work where you travel—for example if you
take trips to the mountains, the beach, the mall, and so on?
Which Comes First, the Phone 
or the Service?
Should you look for a phone ﬁrst or a rate plan and wireless carrier?
The problem with buying a phone ﬁrst is that you don’t know if it will
work on the network that gives you the best coverage. Having said that,
it is common for people to see a phone being used by a friend or co-
worker, or on TV or in a magazine, and to be completely ﬁxated on
buying that phone.That’s not a problem—just realize that it may limit

10
Chapter 1 • How to Choose a Wireless Phone and Service
the places you can get the best use out of your phone. If you’ve got to
have that really cool red phone that you saw Billy using, then that is
how you need to start shopping.
Buying the wireless phone that is perfect for you is a big piece of
getting into wireless.You can spend lots of money on a wireless phone
with all the latest features, or you can get a phone that is practically
free with limited bells and whistles.The options seem to be limitless—
large phones, small phones, phones with speaker phones built in,
phones that can surf the Web.The choice is yours. Look at:

Features
If you do not have any speciﬁc phone in mind, you should do a
little research to make sure you are buying a phone that will suit your
needs. Chapter 6,“Guide to Wireless Phones” describes some of the
phones available in the United States right now, but as with any elec-
tronic device, there are new models coming out all the time, so be sure
to check www.GetConnected.com for the latest phones available.
What Features Do You Need 
in a Wireless Phone?
When choosing a phone or a service provider, the same is true—ask
your friends. People who have wireless phones are great resources when
you are looking for a phone.Ask them how the phone works, whether
it is too heavy, if you can see the numbers on the screen easily, and so
on. Be sure to think about all the things you can do with a wireless
phone and whether those things are important to you (see Chapter 6,
“Guide to Wireless Phones”). Here is a short list of the features that you
may want to use with your new phone:
I
Wireless Internet Access The ability to look at certain Web
sites.
I
Short Message Service (SMS) and E-Mail  The ability to
send and receive short messages and text e-mails.

I
Speaker Phone Some phones allow you to use them as a
speaker phone.
I
Two-way Radio Service  Nextel offers a “push to talk” ser-
vice that lets your phone work like a walkie-talkie for quick,
cheap conversations between two or more people.
I
Downloading Different Ring Tones You can customize the
way your phone rings, from a popular song to a classical hit.
What about the Technical Side of the Phone?
When you are looking at a phone, you also want to make sure its tech-
nical speciﬁcations meet your needs.These are things like the expected
battery life, the ability to add a headset, the size of the screen, and more.
You can see all the details of each phone at www.GetConnected.com,
but here is a short list of what you should consider:
I
Size considerations including the height and the weight of the
phone
I
Expected battery life for talk time and standby time
I
Lines of text and characters per line on the screen (how big
the screen is and how big the numbers are on the screen)
I
Internet capabilities
I
Messaging capabilities
Usage Considerations
The most important thing to understand, but the toughest to ﬁgure out,
is how you will use your phone. If you do a little simple planning now,
you will save some money in the selection of your monthly service plan.
Will you use it only when you get a ﬂat tire and need to call for help?
Or will you use it from dawn to dusk as your only phone? Will you call
long distance or just locally? How about international calls?
Rate plans offer the most confusing set of choices yet—peak time,
off-peak time, long distance included, roaming costs, wireless data, and
so on.To make sure that you buy the service that you need, you need
to look at how you will use your phone and make sure that you buy
only what you need.The majority of wireless users do not even come
close to using the minutes that the service providers give them in their

rate plan. How can you possibly use 3000 minutes on your wireless
phone? It is nice to have all these minutes, just in case, but if you can
pay $10 less per month, you can save $120 per year!
Your Day-to-Day Use
When you really think about it, you can pretty much tell when, where,
and how you will be using your phone. Set up a schedule based on
your use that will follow the basic parameters of the wireless rate plans.
I
How many peak minutes of calling do you need (typically
between 7:00 A.M. and 7:00 P.M.)?
I
What are your needs for off-peak minutes of calling (7:01 P.M.
to 6:59 A.M. and sometimes all day Saturday and Sunday)?
I
What percent of your calls will be local calls?
I
What percent of your calls will be long distance?
I
How often do you think you will use your phone when you
are outside of your local calling area (roaming)? 
An example of such a schedule can be seen in Table 1.1.

You can put the information from Table 1.1 into the Wireless Wizard
at www.GetConnected.com to see all the latest service plans that match
your intended use.You can also use this information to make sure that any
rate plan you are considering has all the minutes you need to use when
you need to use them, how you intend to use them, and where you intend
to use them. For this example, make sure that there are at least 160 min-
utes of peak minutes, 208 off-peak minutes, and that the costs for long dis-
tance and roaming are not too high if they are not included. Some plans
will include long distance and roaming minutes so you don’t have to pay
anything extra, but the majority of plans charge extra for each.
FOR MORE INFORMATION
For more details on service plans, see Chapter 8, “Understanding
Service Plans” or visit www.GetConnected.com.
The Bottom Line: Understanding Cost
When you are considering cost while picking the perfect phone and
plan, realize that there are many different costs involved: phone cost,
monthly service plan cost, activation fee, cancellation fee, long distance,
roaming, overage costs (using more minutes than are provided in your
rate plan). See Chapter 8,“Understanding Service Plans” for full details.
First, you need to have a feeling for the basics that constitute the major
costs: the phone and the rate plan.
How Much to Spend on the Phone
When looking at the phones available you will see phones that are free, or
effectively free with rebates and credits (see Chapter 11,“Understanding
Special Deals and Promotions”), and you will see phones that are very
expensive, which can act as two-way pagers, personal digital assistants, and
may even wash your car if programmed correctly. Free phones almost
always have a required contract, or length of service agreement of one or
two years. If you are looking to get into wireless on the cheap, then a free
phone may work for you, even with the contract. If you want your phone
to send e-mail, cruise the Web, and play Beethoven when it rings, you will

14
Chapter 1 • How to Choose a Wireless Phone and Service
have to pay from $100 on up for the phone. For the details on the wireless
phones, see Chapter 6,“Guide to Wireless Phones.”
How Much to Spend on the Rate Plan
Every month you will be charged for your wireless use. If you stay
within your allowed minutes, then you will pay the expected amount
that you sign up for (plus some taxes and fees that are charged by all car-
riers, usually a few dollars), but if you use more minutes than allowed in
your plan, you will be billed for the extra minutes at premium prices
and get a bill potentially much higher than you expect.That is why it is
important to think about your use prior to signing up for your service.
You can spend as little as $20 or so and as much as $200 or more
per month based on the amount of use you will have. Check out
www.GetConnected.com for the latest in phones and service plans.
WHAT ABOUT PREPAID?
Prepaid wireless is a great way to get a wireless phone with no
credit history, no credit card, and for a short periods of use. Prepaid
is perfect for:
I
Students and children
I
Gifts (no long-term contract needed)
I
Short-term use, for example when you need a phone for
three months
I
Very little monthly use (be careful to make sure the 
minutes don’t expire)
For more information on prepaid wireless, see Chapter 8,
“Understanding Service Plans.”
Bargain Shopping: 
Understanding Promotions
Every wireless service provider offers promotions throughout the year
to entice you to sign up for service.They may offer a free phone, a spe-
cial weekends-free package, or free accessories.When you are looking
to sign up for service and have an idea of which service you think you

How to Choose a Wireless Phone and Service • Chapter 1
15
want, which phones work on that service, how you will use the phone,
and how much you are willing to pay, you need to look at the available
promotions. Sometimes these promotions can save you hundreds of dol-
lars over the life of your wireless use. But beware of promotions that are
not exactly what you are looking for, such as those that may tie you
into a long term contract, offer features that you won’t use, or add min-
utes that you could never use even if you are on the phone every
waking moment.
For a complete breakdown on promotions, see the details in
Chapter 11,“Understanding Special Deals and Promotions,” and get the
latest available promotions from www.GetConnected.com.
Bells and Whistles: 
Looking at Accessories
The last things to consider when buying your new phone are the acces-
sories that you may need to make it perfect for you.Ask yourself these
questions to determine if you need these accessories:
I
Will I use the phone while driving?  If Yes, get a car kit
or a headset (many phones already come with some sort of
hands-free head set, so be sure not to buy an extra if it is
included).
I
Will I use the phone a lot while driving?  If Yes, then get
a car charger or a car kit.
I
Do I need to use my phone for long times while away
from my charger?  If Yes, then buy an extra battery and
make sure it is a long-life battery.
I
Will I need to charge my phone in more than one
place?  If Yes, then buy an extra charger for your ofﬁce or
home.
I
Will I need to carry my phone with me all the time?
If Yes, then buy a leather case for protection with a clip or a
belt clip that hooks onto the battery.
I
Do I want to personalize my phone with different
colors?
If Yes, then buy a phone that has faceplates and a
faceplate to your liking—there are many colors available for
some of today’s popular phones.

Making Sense of It All: 
The Phone and Plan for Me
So—confused? Buying wireless is not a simple process designed to
make sure you get the phone and service plan that you need.All wire-
less carriers try to differentiate themselves from their competitors and
by doing so, they do not make it simple to compare their plans to other
similar plans.The information in this guide will help you make an edu-
cated purchase for the rate plan that ﬁts your needs and the phone that
will do all that you need it to do.Why pay for a $60 plan when you
only need a $40 plan? Why buy a $200 phone when all you need is a
$40 phone? These are the questions that we help you ﬁgure out.
Many of the points in this book are based on offers and rate plans
that are available at the time of this writing.Wireless carriers change
their offers frequently, so the best thing to do after realizing how you
will use your plan and phone is to log onto the Internet and visit
www.GetConnected.com to make sure you see the most up-to-date
information.

DID YOU KNOW?
A wireless phone is a radio. It operates with a transmitter and a
receiver to make sure you can hear the message coming in and the
other person can hear you.
Introduction
Remember the days before cellular phones, when the only methods of
communicating while on the road were by using walkie-talkies or CB
radios? That equipment was so restrictive that you could call only one
or two select people within a very short distance (under 50 miles).
Well, believe it or not, that wasn’t all that long ago. Mobile communi-
cation has increased dramatically in popularity and availability in the
last 20 years.This can certainly be credited to the ever-improving,
ever-expanding wireless technology.
There are many types of wireless technologies available throughout
the nation.What are they? What’s the best technology for your needs?
Do you need more than one? And what do all those terms mean,
anyway? In this chapter, we will answer these questions for you.
Generally speaking, wireless technology can be broken down into
two categories, analog and digital.Analog has been around the longest
and as a result has a more expansive coverage area than digital. Digital is
a fairly new technology and therefore it may not be available in all rural
areas. However, digital wireless is growing rapidly and its coverage area
is expanding everyday. If digital technology is not available in your area
today, you could possibly wake up tomorrow and learn that it is.
Of course digital wireless is not the end-all and be-all of wireless
technology. It does have its restrictions.We will examine the pros and
cons of both analog and digital technology—and let you decide which
is best for you.
Evolution of the Wireless Phone
Wireless phones work using technology similar to CB radios,AM/FM
radios, and walkie-talkies. However, they are a bit more complex and

Analog, Digital—What’s the Difference? • Chapter 2

as a result, they are better suited to fit today’s needs for communica-
tions on the go—staying in touch no matter where you are.A simple
way to explain it is to compare a wireless phone to a CB radio or a
walkie-talkie.
Both CB radios and walkie-talkies are simplex devices.This means
that two people that communicate on a CB radio talk on the same fre-
quency; but only one person can talk at a time.A wireless phone is a
duplex device.A duplex device uses two frequencies. One frequency is
used for talking and a second, separate frequency is used for listening.
Among many other uses, a wireless phone (or duplex device), allows
both people on a call to talk at once. Not only does the wireless phone
eliminate the need to use terms such as “Roger” and “over and out,”
but also more importantly makes the ﬂow of the conversation
smoother. From a user’s standpoint, talking on a wireless phone feels
much like talking on your home phone.The only difference is that you
can be a hundred miles from any city, house, or telephone pole.
Wireless technology is based on the car-mounted police radios of
the 1920s. Mobile telephone service became available to private cus-
tomers in the 1940s. In 1947, Southwestern Bell and AT&T launched
the ﬁrst commercial mobile phone service in St. Louis, Missouri, but
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) limited the amount
of frequencies available, which made only 23 simultaneous phone con-
versations available within a service area (the mobile phones offered
only six channels with a 60 KHz spacing between them).
Unfortunately, that spacing schema led to very poor sound quality due
to cross-channel interference, much like the cross talk on wireline
phones.The original public wireless systems generally used single high-
powered transmitters to cover the entire coverage area. In order to uti-
lize the precious frequencies allotted to them,AT&T developed an idea
to replace the single high-powered transmitters with smaller, strategi-
cally placed transmitters throughout the metropolitan area; calls would
switch between transmitters as they needed a stronger signal.Although
this method of handling calls certainly eased some of the problems, it
did not eliminate the problem altogether. In fact, the problem of too
few voice channels plagued the wireless phone industry for several years.
The main problem was that demand always seemed to exceed supply.
Since the FCC refused to allocate more frequencies for mobile wireless
use, waiting lists became AT&T’s temporary solution as the company
strove for the technological advances necessary to accommodate

everyone. For example, in 1976, there were less than 600 mobile phone
customers in New York City, but there were over 3500 people on the
waiting lists.Across the United States at that time, there were nearly
45,000 subscribers, but there were still another 20,000 people on waiting
lists as much as 10 years long. Compare this situation to today’s, where
service providers give away free phones and thousands of minutes to gain
customers.Wireless technology has come a long way.The term “cellular”
describes how each geographic region of coverage is broken up into cells.
Within each of these cells is a tower or antenna, a radio transmitter, and
control equipment. Early wireless transmission operated at 800 MHz on
analog signals, which are sent on a continuous wave.Analog signals are
covered in more detail later on this chapter.When a customer presses the
SEND button on their wireless phone, the ﬁrst signal sent allows the net-
work to identify the caller as a recognized customer, then it veriﬁes that
he or she is a customer of the service with an active account and ﬁnds a
free channel to place the call to the other party.
Personal Communication Services (PCS), operating at 1900 MHz,
followed years later. PCS refers to the digital wireless services that a
given wireless carrier can bundle together for the user. Services like mes-
saging, paging, and voice mail are all part of the PCS environment. Most
of the wireless carriers in the United States offer PCS services, even the
carriers that operate at 800 MHz, or the original analog frequency. Some
wireless providers began looking into digital technology as a way to
increase the number of customers that could use their networks simulta-
neously, thus increasing the number of customers they could add to their
network (basically, digital signals are encoded voice delivered by bit-
streams, which is described more fully later in this chapter). Some wire-
less providers are using digital signals to send not only voice, but also
data. Digital signals are based on three technologies: Code Division
Multiple Access (CDMA),Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), and
Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM).A more detailed
description of these technologies can be found in Chapter 3,“CDMA to
TDMA—Digital Terms and Basic Deﬁnitions.”
Exploring Analog Technology
In the early 1980s, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
approved the ﬁrst analog wireless telephone standard known as Advanced
Mobile Phone Service (AMPS).The term “wireless” often is used to
www.getconnected.com

Analog, Digital—What’s the Difference? • Chapter 2
25
refer to “traditional wireless,” analog, or AMPS.Analog utilizes a network
built at 800 MHz.This simply means that 800 MHz is the wavelength or
frequency at which your voice travels in a continuous wave between the
wireless phone and the closest antenna at those frequencies.To put this
into perspective, an FM radio functions at between 88 and 108 MHz.
An easy way to think about analog voice signals is to realize that
when you talk to another person in the same room, your voice arrives
in his or her ears using analog voice waves.The sounds you make travel
through the air as a continuous analog sound wave.The biggest differ-
ence between talking to your friends in person and over an analog
wireless phone is the frequency at which your voice is transmitted.
So, in a sense, analog was the pioneer for today’s wireless tech-
nology.As with any new productivity enhancing technology, it quickly
became popular among business professionals, traveling salespeople, and
people who needed to be in touch wherever they were. Since the
new-found mobility of communications was primarily a business tool,
the prices were well out of reach for the every day consumer.
Fortunately for American consumers, in 1996 the FCC put the
Telecommunications Act into effect, which would increase competition
for all telecommunications services including adding up to six or seven
new wireless carriers in all major markets.To learn more about wireless
carriers and their coverage, refer to Chapter 9,“Service Providers and
Service Areas.”
AMPS
Advanced Mobile Phone service, or AMPS, was the original cellular
technology used in the United States. It offered basic voice service
and would connect a wireless phone user to the closest cellular
tower by sending the conversation over the airwaves in a contin-
uous ﬂow, or analog sound wave. This was a great starting point,
but it had many limitations. A version of AMPS known as
Narrowband Advanced Mobile Phone Service (NAMPS) incorporates
some digital technology to allow the system to carry about three
times as many calls as the original version. Even though it uses dig-
ital technology, it is still considered analog. AMPS and NAMPS
operate in the only 800-MHz band and do not offer many of the
features common in digital wireless service, such as e-mail and
Web browsing. For more information on AMPS, refer to Chapter 3,
“CDMA to TDMA—Digital Terms and Basic Deﬁnitions.”

Chapter 2 • Analog, Digital—What’s the Difference?
Examining Digital Technology
Just when you think that you’ve got a pretty good handle on what
analog is all about, digital technology joins the party.This essentially
means a second wireless network, new terminology, new products and
services, and yet another learning curve. But the principle between
analog and digital remains basically the same.The most significant dif-
ference is that unlike analog, the digital network does not send out
your voice on a continuous wave through the air, but breaks down
your voice into binary code (0’s and 1’s), transmits it as data, and
reassembles it on the other end.These digital networks are usually
referred to as Personal Communications Service or (PCS) networks.
(Refer to Chapter 3,“CDMA to TDMA—Digital Terms and Basic
Definitions” for more information on the various types of digital
technologies.) The relevance of these changes to the every-day con-
sumer is that this breakthrough affects everything from call quality, to
the number of people who can access the network in any geograph-
ical area, and to features like caller ID, Internet access, or extended
battery life.
Digital wireless phones use the same radio technology as analog
phones, but they use it in a different way.Analog systems use the
signal between the phone and the wireless network mostly on a one-
to-one basis (one channel for one call). Digital networks allow mul-
tiple calls per channel, or frequency, which allows the wireless carrier
to offer service to more people in their coverage area. Some of the
digital technologies have increased the number of people who can
talk at the same time by six to ten times that allowed by analog sys-
tems. So, in a nutshell, digital technology is more efficient than
analog.
The Pros and Cons of Digital
As with any comparison, there are pros and cons to each item.When
choosing between digital or analog, the most important thing to
remember is that analog is an established technology; it has been
around long enough and is available in most areas, even very rural
locations. However, established is not always good—there is always
room for improvement. Digital wireless uses newer technology;

although it may not be available everywhere, it offers many features
that are unavailable to analog customers. Because of the advanced
technology that digital wireless uses, it is the primary service being
offered today to customers by almost all wireless carriers.The fol-
lowing lists break down the pros and cons for digital technology and
can help you decide what’s best for you.
Advantages of Digital Phones
I
Clarity Digital wireless calls are often clearer than analog
wireless calls.
I
Capacity By enabling more calls to use the same bandwidth,
digital technology reduces the busy signals that occur on
analog networks when too many people attempt to use their
phones at the same time.
I
Value Digital plans tend to offer cheaper, bundled minutes
than the analog alternatives because the wireless carrier has
more bandwidth on digital than on analog.
I
Better Phone Choices Because digital wireless can utilize
more advanced features than analog, most digital phones come
with innovative features (like a calendar, calculator, and wire-
less Internet capabilities).The popularity of digital phones has
also created an increased demand for phones resulting in more
phone choices for the consumer.
I
Battery Life Digital wireless phones generally have a
longer battery life than analog phones.This explains why
digital phones are usually smaller and come with more talk
time than analog phones.Analog phones have to be in active
mode all the time, which drains the battery; digital phones
can use a standby or sleep mode, which saves battery use.
I
Security Digital technology breaks your voice into zeros
and ones before it transmits it through the air, making it
inherently more secure than analog technology.This makes it
more difficult for anyone to eavesdrop on your wireless calls.
I
Extra Features In general, digital networks tend to offer the
customer more network feature options like Caller ID,Text
Messaging, and even Web surﬁng.

Disadvantages of Digital Phones
I
Coverage  In the United States, the networks are still relatively
young and do not offer a coverage area as comprehensive as the
analog networks.
I
Single Band Phones Some digital phones operate only
on the digital network that is the primary network of the
carrier.These phones are great when they are in the digital
coverage of the carrier, but will not be able to make or
receive calls when outside of the digital network, for
example when in a rural area on vacation or while traveling
in nonpopulated areas.
I
Roaming Fees Some wireless carriers offer their low per-
minute cost or included minutes only while you are oper-
ating on their digital network, which may be only in a
metropolitan area and the immediate surroundings.When
you drive outside that area, you are using roaming minutes,
which are more expensive and often are not included in
your monthly service fee.
I
Digital Sound Problems Although digital sound quality has
dramatically improved since its introduction, you are likely to
ﬁnd areas on the edges of the digital coverage area where the
sound is like calling from under water, or where your call will
just be disconnected. Sometimes that is better than the analog
static, but other times it can be just as frustrating.
www.getconnected.com

Summary
Although the coverage areas when using analog is still superior to the
coverage you will ﬁnd on a digital phone, the advantages of a digital
phone far surpass those of an analog phone.The majority of wireless
phones available offer a secondary mode of operation on the analog
network to make sure you have as much coverage as possible, which is
an important factor when looking at phones.There is nothing worse
than spending $200 on a phone that offers the latest in digital capabili-
ties only to have it not work as soon as you leave the highway!

Chapter 3 • CDMA to TDMA—Digital Terms and Basic Deﬁnitions
Introduction
As wireless technology becomes more and more popular, service
providers and wireless providers will offer their customers more and
more advanced features. Since the introduction of digital into the cel-
lular world, the possibilities seem endless.Although analog technology,
the original wireless technology, continues to be the most expansive
network available, it is being challenged by digital technology as digital
technology offers superior abilities to better serve the consumer. One of
the major problems with digital wireless today is the sheer number of
digital wireless service providers that exist. For the average customer,
knowing what the different types of digital services are, what services
the different providers have to offer, and why one service provider is
better or worse than the other is almost impossible.
The only thing that matters to most people buying wireless is that
it works clearly and consistently and is relatively inexpensive.
Reasonable expectations, but when someone ventures online or into a
wireless store to buy a wireless phone and service plan, they are con-
fronted with so many similar choices that it can be overwhelming and
quite confusing.The reasons that the wireless carriers moved from
analog to digital or built their networks using only digital are many, but
the most compelling reason is that digital allows them to offer more.
More features. More customers per channel of frequency allocated by
the FCC. More seamless use across the country. Just plain more.
Early mobile telephone systems allowed only one conversation per
frequency, which was very limiting to the carriers in terms of how
many customers they could serve.There was nothing that could really
be done based on technology that did not allow for frequencies to be
reused in any single geographical area. However the demand for wire-
less phones has led to systems whose design is based on the reuse of
frequencies. One of the ﬁrst services to design a frequency reuse plan,
or cellular plan, was the Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS).
Before AMPS there were a limited number of channels available for
wireless phones; the towers to transmit and receive the signal from the
mobile units were designed to cover large geographic areas, so as to limit
the number of towers and to lower costs. However, this resulted in very
low user density and crippled the systems in highly populated areas.AMPS
was designed to allow frequencies to be reused in a smaller geographic
area, thereby increasing the available user density. Digital technologies

expanded on the reuse of frequency to allow each channel to carry three,
six, and even ten times as many calls as the older systems.The ability to
take a person’s voice, break it down into 0’s and 1’s, and reassemble it
when it got to a tower enabled each bit of frequency to be used for many
voice calls and for passing data back and forth across the network.
The types of digital service that have evolved in the United States
and around the world vary from each other mostly in technical ways,
but also in some very customer-affecting ways.There are four types of
digital systems is the United States:
I
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
I
Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)
I
Time Division Multiple Accessing (TDMA)
I
Enhanced Specialized Mobile Radio (ESMR)
The differences of the types of digital service are discussed in the
remaining sections of this chapter.
COMPETING DIGITAL STANDARDS
Wireless carriers are always trying to ﬁnd the best way to optimize
their networks with new technologies, while making sure that once a
customer is on their network, it is tough for them to leave for the
competitor. In the early days of wireless, the cellular providers all got
together, so the story goes, and agreed to move from their analog
systems to a common digital standard. This would allow for simple
customer roaming and migration from one network to another, thus
creating the easiest solution for the consumer. Immediately after the
hands were shaken to agree on this one standard, the carriers all
starting making their own arrangements and vendor choices based
on different standards, including TDMA, GSM, and CDMA, and the
simplicity that once existed in the analog world quickly ended.
Code Division Multiple Access
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is often referred to as the
most interesting, but hardest to implement method of carrying wireless
services. CDMA systems have no channels, but instead encode each call
as a coded sequence across the entire frequency spectrum. Each conver-
www.getconnected.com

34
Chapter 3 • CDMA to TDMA—Digital Terms and Basic Deﬁnitions
sation is modulated, in the digital domain, with a unique code that
makes it distinguishable from the other calls in the frequency spectrum.
CDMA is the newest of the multiple access technologies; it is not
yet as widely used but is showing great promise. CDMA does not
divide the allocated block of frequencies into individual channels. It
assigns a unique code to each signal and then combines all the signals
into a single large channel.The receiver receives the integrated signal
and uses the same code just to process the desired signal. CDMA is
gaining popularity as a third-generation (3G) wireless phone tech-
nology because it is very efﬁcient at utilizing bandwidth, plus it is
natively very secure because all conversations are uniquely encoded.
The fact that CDMA shares frequencies with neighboring wireless
towers allows for easier installation of extra capacity, since extra
capacity can be achieved by simply adding extra cell sites and
shrinking power levels of nearby sites.The downside to CDMA is the
complexity of deciphering and extracting the received signals, espe-
cially if there are multiple signal paths (reﬂections) between the phone
and the wireless tower (called multipath interference).As a result,
CDMA phones are sometimes more expensive than other digital
phones and CDMA antenna site equipment is three to four times the
price of the other digital network equivalents.
Beneﬁts of CDMA 
CDMA networks cover more wireless users in the United States than
any other digital standard and include beneﬁts such as:
I
Advanced features like caller ID, text messaging
I
Voice clarity and overall call quality 
I
The ability to ﬁlter out background noise and interference
I
Fewer dropped calls (as compared to analog)
I
Improved security and privacy—the digitally encoded, spread
spectrum transmissions minimizes eavesdropping 
I
Α large number of customers who can share the same radio
frequencies 
I
The greatest customer capacity of network equipment for
low cost 
I
Less battery power (when compared to analog)

Global Systems for Mobile
Communications
Global Systems for Mobile Communication (GSM) is the main
technology used by the international digital wireless systems; how-
ever, GMS is used only by a small percentage of wireless carriers in
the United States. GSM is interesting in that it uses a modified and
far more efficient version of TDMA (explained later in this
chapter). GSM keeps the idea of timeslots on frequency channels,
but corrects several major shortcomings. Since the GSM timeslots
are smaller than TDMA, they hold less data but allow for data rates
starting at 300 bits per second.Thus, a call can use as many times-
lots as necessary up to a limit of 13 kilobits per second.When a call
is inactive (silence) or can be compressed more, fewer timeslots are
used.To facilitate filling in gaps left by unused timeslots, calls do fre-
quency hopping in GSM.This means that calls will jump between
channels and timeslots to maximize the system’s usage. A control
channel is used to communicate the frequency hopping and other
information between the antenna tower and the phone.
The architecture used by GSM consists of three main components:
a mobile station, a base station subsystem, and a network subsystem.
These components work in tandem to allow a user to travel seamlessly
without interruption of service, while offering the ﬂexibility of having
any device used permanently or temporarily by any user. Utilizing the
three separate components of the GSM network, this type of communi-
cation is truly portable.A user can place an identiﬁcation card called a
Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) in the wireless device, and the device
will take on the personal conﬁgurations and information of that user.
This includes telephone numbers, home system, and billing informa-
tion.Although the United States has migrated towards CDMA and
TDMA as the premier mode of wireless communications, a large part
of the world uses GSM.
Beneﬁts of GSM
GSM networks cover the most wireless users around the world and the
technology is gaining favor in the United States because of the fol-
lowing beneﬁts:

Time Division Multiple Access
Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) divides wireless conversations
by frequency and time to increase the capacity of the network.TDMA
uses a single voice channel for multiple calls by taking each call,
breaking it into timed sections of a digital transmission to the tower,
and reassembling the call based on the timeslot. For example, call A has
all its parts put into timeslot A, call B has its parts put into timeslot B,
and each are sent in one transmission to the tower, where the calls are
put back together for transmission to the other party.TDMA was one
of the original digital systems used and has gone through many revi-
sions to make sure it utilizes the network to the best of its abilities.
Based on a limited number of timeslots for each call in a channel,
TDMA has no accommodations for silence in a telephone conversa-
tion. In other words, once a call is initiated, the channel/timeslot pair
belongs to the phone for the duration of the call.
Each channel using TDMA technology for wireless calls is further
divided into timeslots. Each timeslot is assigned to a different user.The
transmitter transmits information for all timeslots at the same frequency
and the receivers receive all the timeslots but listen only to the timeslot
they have been allocated.The net effect is that the efﬁciency of the
channel is increased by a multiple of the number of timeslots that are
being used. Most common second-generation TDMA phone systems
use three timeslots.

distances

Enhanced Specialized Mobile Radio
Enhanced Specialized Mobile Radio (ESMR) systems use digital radio
transmissions similar to other digital technologies. Spread-spectrum
modes, such as frequency hopping, are common. One major difference
from other networks is that in an ESMR system, connections between
users is almost instantaneous, compared to the typical delays required to
dial and set up a call in a public cellular network.This capability allows
the ESMR carrier to offer walkie-talkie–like services on its network, as
well as cellular calling.This is a great advantage for large work groups
who need to be in constant contact with just a touch of a button, for
example a construction crew. ESMR services also allow customers to
contact many people at the same time, much like a CB radio, thus cre-
ating a multiple person “call.”
Examples of ESMR networks include Ericsson’s Enhanced Digital
Access Communications System (EDACS), Motorola’s Integrated
Dispatch Enhanced Network (iDEN), and the Nextel System.
Delivery and courier services, which depend on mobility and speed,
also typically employ ESMR for voice communications between the
delivery vehicles and the ofﬁce.The technology consists of a dispatcher
in an ofﬁce plotting out the day’s events for the driver.When the driver
arrives at his location, he radios the dispatcher and lets him know his

to communicate personally.This arrangement allows the dispatcher to
coordinate schedules for both pick-ups and deliveries, and to track the
driver’s progress. Drivers with empty loads can be routed to assist back-
logged drivers. Drivers that are on the road can be radioed if a customer
cancels a delivery.This type of communication beneﬁts delivery services
in two major areas, saving time and increasing efﬁciency.

Summary
Digital technology is quickly outpacing analog with its advanced fea-
tures, incredible battery life, and voice quality.The limitation of cov-
erage for each of the four types of digital coverage in the United States
can sometimes be overcome by using a wireless phone that has digital
service and analog capabilities in order to maximize the places in the
U.S. where the phone will work.The differences between the types of
digital available to consumers is tough to discern, so the best way to
judge which one is best for you is to consider the features, coverage,
and quality of that digital coverage in your location.

Chapter 4 • Wireless Data and the Wireless Internet—Do I Need It?
Introduction
Imagine that the four hours you spent sitting in the airport waiting for
a delayed ﬂight yesterday could have been as productive as being in the
ofﬁce, sitting at your desk. Instead of getting friendly with the airport
bartender, you could have been browsing the 80 unread e-mails in your
inbox, checking your stock portfolios, or even looking up directions to
that impending business meeting.Yes, you can do all this in the palm of
your hand as long as you have the right phone and access to the
Wireless Internet.
What Is the Wireless Internet?
Like millions of others around the world, you use the Internet from
your home or work computer every day to communicate with friends,
family, and co-workers; check your stocks; keep up with the news and
weather; make travel plans; get directions; and check movie times.
Missing e-mail messages, updates on your stocks, or some news you just
need to know can be detrimental to your personal and professional life.
How would you like the freedom of leaving the ofﬁce for a while, but
still being connected to the world around you? 
Thanks to the Wireless Internet, you can get away from the ofﬁce
for a bit, while maintaining complete control over the information that
matters most to you.Answer e-mail, check sports scores and news, all
from the palm of your hand.
The Wireless Internet gives your phone a dual personality—one for
voice and one for data.All the data that you need every day may very well
be available to you by using your wireless phone.The Wireless Internet lets
you read, reply, forward, and manage your e-mail. It helps you to be more
efﬁcient when you are on the run, or when you need to access informa-
tion while you are away from the ofﬁce.There are many software compa-
nies today that are creating applications to allow you to see all the data
that you use at work through your wireless phone.Although the informa-
tion will not be presented in a format that your are familiar with, you will
be able to access and manipulate it—read it, fax it, e-mail it, delete it.
How Does It Work?
Perhaps the most important factor in the birth of Wireless Internet has
been the immense growth of wireless phones in the last few years.With

digital wireless networks expanding at record pace, a solid foundation
for Wireless Internet services was established. In 1997, Nokia, Motorola,
Ericsson, and Phone.com came together to create the Wireless
Application Protocol (WAP) because they believed a universal standard
was critical to the successful implementation of the Wireless Internet.
WAP uses Wireless Markup Language (WML), which includes the
Handheld Device Markup Language (HDML) developed by
Phone.com (now called OpenWave after their merger with
Software.com).The wireless phones are also equipped with a piece of
software called a micro-browser, which is analogous to the Web browser
you use to access the Internet from your home or work PC.The
micro-browser allows you either to enter a Web address or to click on a
page link, which will then bring you to that page.
Most wireless phones have data transfer rates of 14.4 kbps or less.
Compared to a typical home PC 56 kbps modem, cable modem, or
DSL connection (100 kbps+), wireless speeds are much slower.Wireless
Internet content is typically text-based, so the time it takes to download
content is less than if the page were loaded with graphics.And although
you don’t get the graphical beauty of the Internet, you are able to gain
access to the information that matters to you most, while on the go.A
comparison of a typical Web page and its wireless Web counterpart can
be seen in Figures 4.1 and 4.2.
The relatively small size of the liquid crystal display (LCD) on a
wireless phone certainly presents another challenge. Most Web sites are
designed for a resolution of 640 by 480 pixels, which is ideal for
viewing on a desktop or laptop computer.The page simply will not ﬁt
on wireless phone displays, which average 150 by 150 pixels.Also, the
majority of wireless devices use monochromatic screens. Pages are more
difﬁcult to read when the text and background colors become similar
shades of gray.WAP takes each of these limitations into account and
provides a way for pages to be displayed for optimal viewing capabilities
on a wireless phone screen.
New applications are being developed to allow more graphics to be
downloaded onto wireless phones. Given the limitations of the phone
screen, the normal graphics you are used to will not appear on your
phone. Some phones and wireless services can accept wireless bitmap
pictures (WBMP), which offer a taste of things to come in the delivery
of images to wireless phones, albeit not a high resolution, full-color ani-
mated picture like you’d see on your home computer.

Chapter 4 • Wireless Data and the Wireless Internet—Do I Need It?
There are many steps involved in accessing a Web page through
your wireless phone:
1.
The handset establishes a connection with its base station.
2.
Once this connection is set up, the micro-browser initiates a
connection to a WAP gateway predefined in the phone’s
configuration.

3.
The micro-browser requests a URL from the WAP gateway.
This is done via a compact binary encoded request.
4.
The gateway translates this request into an HTTP request, and
sends it over the wired Internet to the speciﬁed content server.
5.
The content server responds by sending a page of WML con-
tent, which may also contain WMLScript (similar to
JavaScript), and special graphics in WBMP format.
6.
The gateway compresses the response into a special binary
format optimized for low-bandwidth networks, and then
sends it back to the micro-browser. It also compiles any
WMLScript found in the response.
7.
The micro-browser decodes the compressed signal and
attempts to display it, if possible.
Don’t worry if this seems like too much information—there are
many steps involved in getting information from the Web to your small
wireless phone screen. Each step along the way may vary slightly based
on the kind of content you are requesting and the kind of phone you
are using.As the Wireless Internet matures, there will be fewer steps that
vary from the wired Internet, thus allowing any device to access the
online information in virtually the same way.
What Kind of Phone Do I Need? 
To access the Wireless Internet, you will need to get an Internet-ready
phone.These phones currently range in price from $100 to $500.
Three examples of Internet-ready phones can be seen in Figures 4.3,
4.4, and 4.5.
NOTE
For a more complete sampling of Internet-ready phones, refer to
Chapter 6, “Guide to Wireless Phones.”
Wireless Internet service also enables users to connect their laptops
to the Internet without plugging into the phone socket in the wall.You
can purchase a separate cable that will allow you to connect to the
Internet using your phone as your modem.The range of prices for

these kits covers the spectrum from $20 to $200, depending on the kit
and its accompanying services. Often, using your phone as a modem
will use minutes on your monthly rate plan, but sometimes you need to
get an additional rate plan speciﬁcally for data.
What Services Can I Get from 
the Wireless Carriers? 
Thanks to the advancements made in wireless phone technology over
the past few years, virtually every large wireless service provider now
offers Wireless Internet service to their customers, some including basic
Wireless Internet for no additional charge, with others charging an
additional monthly fee in addition to monthly service plan charges.
Some of the standard Wireless Internet services available include
stock quotes, show times, restaurant reviews, and door-to-door direc-
tions right from your Wireless Internet-ready phone.Wireless Internet
services that come standard on Internet-ready phones are pretty much
limited to the basic services at this point, but are expanding all the time.
Many companies are creating new ways to use the Wireless Internet
from all Internet-ready phones to allow the user to customize the
phone for Web surﬁng. Some of the services available today include
weather, sports scores, news headlines, horoscopes, e-mail notiﬁcation,
and calendar reminders.
The one feature that all Wireless Internet users love is the ability to
have e-mail access in their back pockets. Check your e-mail whenever
and wherever you want—while watching your daughter’s soccer game
or at the top of a mountain. Some wireless carriers e-mail packages
allow you to print your e-mail simply by faxing the e-mail to the
nearest fax machine.This is very handy if you need a copy of an inven-
tory list, or directions to hand to someone else.
Each wireless carrier will have slightly different services that
come with their Wireless Internet package, so be sure to look for one
that fits your needs. If you only want to casually cruise the Web, then
look for one that is free, or has a low per-use cost. If you will depend
on your wireless phone for data as much as voice, make sure that the
data coverage that you will receive is of similar quality as the voice
coverage that you expect. Also make sure that the e-mail use that you
want is what is available. Most e-mail accounts that reside behind a

firewall (for example Exchange or Lotus enterprise applications) can
be tricky to access with your wireless phone. It is easier to direct you
wireless phone to standard Internet e-mail accounts, called POP3 
e-mail.
What Services Can I Get 
from Third Parties?
Making a Web site accessible to a wireless device is quite a challenge. So
far only a small portion of sites, approximately 1.5 million of the more
than one billion Web sites, provide any Wireless Internet content.As the
use of Web-enabled wireless devices grows, you can expect increasing
numbers of Webmasters to create wireless content for their Web sites to
get the attention of the new wireless Web surfers.
TOP WIRELESS INTERNET PORTALS
These portals are the most popular available to send customized
information via the Wireless Internet straight to your wireless
phone:

Wireless carriers are partnering with many Internet content
providers to add value to their customer’s Wireless Internet experience.
Many of the content providers allow users to download simple content
for speciﬁc items like weather or airline schedules and the other items
mentioned earlier. Many of the top names on the Internet are creating
customized areas for wireless users to access their own customized
information wherever they are, whenever they want it.The wireless car-
riers are partnering with these portals to keep their customers accessing
their Wireless Internet often, adding to the value that they bring to the
wireless experience.

Portals that lead the Internet are hoping to get the same advantage
on the Wireless Internet and attract the new generation of Internet
users to their wireless areas. New names are trying to lead the charge in
the Wireless Internet and take a piece of the customer base away from
the established Web leaders by enhancing the experience beyond what
the existing Web portals are doing.The future of Wireless Internet is
looking to be a great one for what will be available, with increased
download speeds, graphics, color, and interactive access like games with
multiple players.
Wireless Data and Fax
An increasing number of digital phones can now be used as if they
were modems.Therefore, with a data cable, you can use your phone
and a laptop to connect to your usual Internet service provider
(AOL, Earthlink, etc.) while on the road.These phones can also be
used for receiving faxes, as long as your laptop has a fax software
application.
If you want to use your wireless phone as a modem, you need to
ask yourself the following questions:
1.
Does the phone I want to buy have data or/and fax
capability?
When you are purchasing a phone, make sure the phone is
Data/Fax Capable.This will assure you that your phone will
be able to operate as a modem.
2.
Does your wireless service provider offer that function?
There is usually a low monthly cost associated with the data
service. However, since you will most likely be using your
plan minutes to access the Internet on your computer, the
only charges you should incur would be for long distance
(if not included with your plan) or additional minutes (if
you exceed your included plan minutes). In any case, you
should check with your wireless service provider prior to
accessing the Internet on your computer with your wireless
phone.

52
Chapter 4 • Wireless Data and the Wireless Internet—Do I Need It?
3.
What data speed is supported on the network to
which you want to subscribe, and what kind of data
transfer is it?
This is a very important question because not all types of net-
works allow for the same data speeds and they don’t use the
same methods of transferring data.Wireless carriers use either
circuit-switched data transfer or packet-switched data transfer,
meaning that the network either ties up a single channel for
your data to be transmitted or it sends the data in small
packets from one end to the other, using multiple channels.
The difference is that typically, packet-switched data is faster
and more reliable, since the network has the ability to detect
corrupted data streams when a packet is missing and can cor-
rect itself or ask your computer to ﬁx it, whereas circuit-
switched data either will be working or it will not—the
channel will be on or off. If the channel turns off in the
middle of a data transmission, typically you have to start all
over again.

Summary
The Wireless Internet is basically a subset of the wired Internet.You
should remember that accessing the Internet with your cellular phone
does not give you to the same amounts of computer memory, pro-
cessing power, or monitor space as your desktop computer does, so
your experience will be quite a bit different.When you use your wire-
less phone as a modem from your laptop to access the Internet, you
can see the same things you do when plugged in at work or at home;
it just takes a bit longer—and is more prone to need reconnection.
Wireless phones are still basically meant to do one primary
thing—allow you to talk to any one, any time, from anywhere.The
addition of data capabilities is something that is incredibly useful for
many people and is adding to the overall features that you can get with
your wireless phone purchase—but the ability to toss your computer is
still years away.You can increase your productivity, access information
that is critical to you, and keep in touch with e-mail and short mes-
sages using your wireless phone; many users become quickly addicted
to this capability.
Do you need the Wireless Internet? If you are the type of person
who always needs to be in touch and know what is going on with your
e-mail and electronic calendar, but you also need to be in two or three
places at once, then yes, you should strongly consider the addition of
the Wireless Internet to your cellular phone service plan.

Chapter 5 • The Components of a Wireless Phone
Introduction
Choosing the right phone for you is important. For many people, a wire-
less phone is a constant companion and fashion accessory. For others, a
wireless phone is a functional device that they dig out when they need to
place a call. Determining how you feel about your phone will make it
easier to decide which features are more or less important to you.
The main components that make a phone more or less attractive
are size, standard features, advanced features, and accessory options.The
price of a phone usually is determined by these components.The
smaller the size and weight of a phone, the more expensive it tends to
be.The more advanced features (like wireless Internet access) the phone
has, the more expensive it tends to be.Accessory options such as higher
quality batteries, interchangeable faceplates, hands-free kits, and battery
chargers don’t change the initial price of the phone, but they do impact
the bottom-line price.
Wireless carriers tend to offer at least one less expensive basic
model phone with their plans.That phone is usually a good quality
phone with standard features, an average weight, and an average battery.
The section,“A Beginner’s Guide to Phone Features” will detail what
you can expect to get from that type of phone.
Every wireless carrier will also offer a “hot” new phone that has the
latest and greatest everything—and is the most expensive.These phones
are typically the latest innovation in size (palm size), exterior appeal
(stainless steel), advanced features (MP3 players), or a combination of
these components.The section,“The Cutting Edge” will review today’s
latest novelties.
If you want more than the basic phone but don’t need as much as
the hot phone, there are plenty of options. Knowing what the compo-
nents do will help you buy the phone that works best for you and that
ﬁts into your budget.
The Basics
The Ericsson R289LX is one of the most popular phones today
because it offers many of the best features for a reasonable price. Figure
5.1 shows the Ericsson R289lX and calls attention to the various ele-
ments you will ﬁnd on most wireless phones.These elements are
described in further detail in the following sections.
www.getconnected.com

The Components of a Wireless Phone • Chapter 5
59
Display Screen 
I
Screen Size If you plan to use the phone for wireless
Internet applications, then a larger, multiline screen is a
must. Look at how many lines of text can fit on a screen,
and how many characters per line.Also be sure to check if
you are able to read the letters on the screen or if they are
just simply too small.
I
Monochromatic versus Color Displays Most wireless
phones have monochromatic (i.e., black and white, all amber,
or all green) displays, but there are a growing number of
phones that offer color LCD displays.Wireless phones with
color screens use more memory and are more expensive; they
are the cutting edge of wireless phone display technology.
Antenna 
Antennas are internal, ﬁxed, or extendable. Extendable antennas must be
fully extended to give you their maximum range.The best kind of
www.getconnected.com
Figure 5.1 The Basic Components of All Cellular Phones
Illustrated Using the Ericsson R289LX

60
Chapter 5 • The Components of a Wireless Phone
antenna depends on where you use your phone and how strong the
coverage is in that area. Most of the time, an internal or ﬁxed antenna
works just ﬁne, but when you are at the edge of a wireless carrier’s cov-
erage area, you may get better quality from a phone with an extendable
antenna.
Menu Selection and Scroll Keys 
The look and feel of the menu selection and scroll keys varies by phone
model.The usability of these keys is very important if you plan to use
your phone for Internet surﬁng or for text messaging.
I
Scroll Keys Let you quickly surf through menus, submenus,
and phone books.
I
Menu Selection Keys Let you choose the option that is
currently displayed above the key.
I
Phone Menu Lets you customize your phone to make it
your own—for example, the sound of the ring, the volume of
the earpiece or the key pad when you press the numbers, and
so on.The phone menu is where you will ﬁnd all these set-
tings; every phone is slightly different as to how the menu is
laid out and displayed.The user’s manual for your phone will
walk you through all the selections.
Other Keys 
To save on size, most keypads have multiple functions. Many features
are available through the menus, but shortcuts and certain basic func-
tions are available only by pressing the keys in a certain order. For
example, to lock your keypad you may press *0, or to speed dial a
number you may press #8. Reading the user’s manual that comes with
the phone will explain exactly how this works for the phone you
choose.
I
Keypad Letters When you use a wireless phone to send
two-way messages or e-mail, you enter the text using your
keypad. Each number corresponds with certain letters, for
example A, B, and C are on the 2 key. In order to type a C
into your phone, you press the 2 key three times.
www.getconnected.com

The Components of a Wireless Phone • Chapter 5
61
www.getconnected.com
I
Clear Key Most phones have a key that will allow you to
erase the last number or letter you entered (usually labeled
CLR). Press the CLR button once to remove the last digit
entered or hold it down to erase the entire entry.
I
Message Key Most digital phones are able to receive text
messages and will also display when you have a voice mail
waiting for you.The message key will allow you to access
these messages for review.
PREDICTIVE TEXT ENTRY
Many wireless phones are loaded with software that helps you type
words with fewer keystrokes. Tegic (www.tegic.com) is one com-
pany that offers software called T9 (www.t9.com), which helps you
use the nine keys on your phone to type thousands of words by
pressing each number key only once, instead of up to three times.
When you are typing many short messages using your phone, it is
much easier to use predictive text entry software than continually
typing the number keys.
Battery 
The quality of the battery will determine the talk/standby time of your
phone. Generally, phones are sold with a standard battery that gives you
an average talk/standby time. Extra batteries can be bought as acces-
sories and upgraded later, so we do not recommend making the
talk/standby time of the standard battery the decisive factor in deter-
mining which phone you choose to purchase (see Chapter 7,
“Accessories for Your Wireless Phone”).
Jacks 
If you plan on charging your phone in the car or using a hands-free
accessory, then you want to make sure that the phone model that you
purchase will support these kinds of accessories.A quick way to verify
compatibility is to make sure the jacks for these accessories are physi-
cally available.

62
Chapter 5 • The Components of a Wireless Phone
I
Hands-Free Jack Some phones require a special attachment
for using a head set or a hands-free device. Others accessories
often offer a standard plug that will work with many different
types of phones.
I
Charger Jack (or connection) Most phones will have a
number of charger types available (standard charger, rapid
charger, and car adaptor charger).They each have advantages,
so if you want a speciﬁc charger, make sure the phone 
supports it.
A Beginner’s Guide to 
Phone Features 
No one can decide for you which features are more important than
others. However, knowing what the features are can help you decide for
yourself if it is something that you will never use or something you
can’t live without. Since the type of features a phone has is directly pro-
portional to the amount it may cost you, reviewing the list of features
will help you decide between the $400 phone and the $40 phone.And
when you are comparing similar phones, the one that has the right fea-
tures for you is the one you want.
Standard Features 
Standard features tend to vary by phone manufacturer (such as
Motorola or Nokia) and model rather than by wireless service carrier.
A Nokia 8200 model offered by Cingular will have the same standard
features as a Nokia 8200 model offered by AT&T Wireless (even
though they use different networks). How the different wireless car-
riers choose to highlight and advertise those features can vary widely.
The following features are in alphabetical order and are available on
most phones currently on the market. Some very basic phones may
not have all of these features.
I
Automatic Redial Let your phone do the work for you.A
wireless phone with automatic redial will continually dial a
call until you get through to the number you are attempting
to reach.

Battery Level Indicator Can’t remember when you
charged your battery last? This indicator is usually ﬁxed on
the ﬁrst screen, so you always know how much power you
have left.
I
Calculator Always have a calculator handy. Great for splitting
the bill at restaurants.
I
Calendar/Reminder Set up reminders for important meet-
ings, birthdays, and such.
I
Call Log Tracks recently dialed, received, and missed calls.
The number of calls stored varies by phone, but is usually
between ﬁve and twenty.
I

also have an alarm feature.
I
Display Own Phone Number Great for when you ﬁrst
get your phone and are updating all of your friends and family
on your new number, but you just can’t remember it.
I
External Volume/Ringer Control Turn the volume of
your ringer up when you are outside, turn it down when you
go out to dinner or to the movies.
I
Games Every manufacturer has their own games installed.
These are great for occupying free moments while waiting in
line, for example.
I
Incoming Number Storage This is a quick and easy way
to add phone numbers to your phone book.When you get a
call, choose this option and add the name later.
I
Keypad Lock Allows you to lock the keypad so you don’t
accidentally make a call while your phone is in your bag or
pocket. Especially useful for “non-ﬂip” phone designs.
I

I
Personalized/Custom Ring Tones Set your ring to what-
ever makes you happy.You will always be able to tell it’s your
phone. Or program a different ring for each of your favorite
callers, so you can tell who is calling before you even ﬁnd
your phone. In addition to the standard tones, many Web sites
also offer downloadable rings that increase your options (for
compatible phones).
I
Phone Book (size varies) Every phone has some type of
phone book.The most basic phone books allow you to store
about 20 phone numbers with names.The most advanced
phone books allow you to store over 100 entries with business
card information, e-mail addresses, and up to four contact
numbers per entry.
I
Security Lock Password-protect your phone so that only
you can use it. Most phones let you do this manually or
automatically.Advanced phones let you password-protect
sections of your information (like your phone book).A nice
feature to have in case you accidentally leave your phone
somewhere.
I
Signal Strength Indicator Like the battery indicator this
indicator is usually ﬁxed on the ﬁrst screen, so you always
know how good you can expect your reception to be.
I
Speed Dialing/One-Touch Dialing This feature allows
you to program certain keys to dial frequently called numbers.
Keeps the fumbling to a minimum when you are on the go
or in a hurry.
I
Vibrate Mode Similar to the ring volume, the vibrate mode
is considered most polite when you are at the movies or other
places where discretion is advised.Vibrate mode can also work
better than ring volume in extremely loud places like con-
certs. Depending on the manufacturer, vibrate can be a func-
tion of either the phone or the battery. If it is the battery, you
can always upgrade later.
I
Volume Controls Allows you to turn up the volume for
low talkers and turn down the volume for loud talkers.The
most advanced phones have a built-in function that modulates
the volume for you.

Features Requiring Service 
All of the following features are considered standard features on most
phones, but they also require your service carrier to provide the service.
These services can be included, or they can have a per-use monthly
charge, depending on the wireless service plan you choose. So in order
to use any of the following features, you need to check your phone
model and your service plan.
I
Call Forwarding Allows you to send calls to another phone
number when your wireless phone number is unavailable
(turned off, out of range, or busy). Depending on the primary
use of your phone, you can use this feature to redirect calls to
your ofﬁce or home and make sure your callers are always
taken care of.
I
Call Waiting If you prefer to take your calls as they come in,
you can use call waiting.This feature notiﬁes you if another
caller is trying to get through when you are already on the
telephone.Then, you can put the ﬁrst caller on hold while
you take the other call, switch between the two callers, or end
one call to take the other. Or, you can ignore the tones and
let the second caller be forwarded to your voicemail.
I
Caller ID Lets you see who’s calling before you answer. On
most models, it also works with your phone book to provide a
name if you have programmed the name into your phone book.
I
Emergency Calling Every network uses 911 for emergency
calls. Some phones also have preprogrammed “hot” keys that
allow one-touch dialing for personal emergencies.According
to the FCC, as long as you are in an area that has any wireless
coverage at all, and regardless of the activation status of your
phone, your 911 call will be placed.
I
Roaming Indicator This on-screen indicator lets you know
that you are entering an area where you will be charged addi-
tionally for your calls. It is up to the wireless carrier to decide
if they provide this service or not.
I
Three-Way Calling Need to make plans with more than
one person? Three-way calling lets you conference in two
other phones, so you don’t have to call anyone back. More

66
Chapter 5 • The Components of a Wireless Phone
advanced phones have multi-party calling, allowing you to
conference with up to ﬁve additional phones.
I
Voice-Activated Functions Talk to your phone and it does
what you tell it to.This feature can be as limited as the ability
to dial certain numbers or it can retrieve your sports score
updates, depending on the phone model.
I
Voicemail Allows people to leave you a message when your
phone is unavailable (turned off, out of range, or busy).This
feature can let you be a one-person ofﬁce, if you prefer not to
forward your calls.
Advanced Features Requiring Service 
These features are available on a growing number of phones. Every
manufacturer and every wireless carrier offers at least one phone that
allows you to use the following features.The usability and availability of
these features gets better every year. So if one of these features is inter-
esting to you, but not the right thing now, check back next year and see
how it has improved.
I
Text Messaging, or Short Message Service (SMS)
Allows you to exchange short alphanumeric messages with
other phones, wireless devices, or PCs. If you plan to use this
feature often, make sure you get a phone with a comfortable
keypad and large enough display area. Some text messaging
services are only for receiving messages, so if you want to send
messages, make sure it is two-way capable.
I
Wireless Internet Access (WAP)  Allows you to surf the
Web, in a manner of speaking. Sites that have created WAP
interfaces let you get the basics of what you need including
weather, stocks, news, and scheduled updates. May also allow
you to access e-mail, depending on the phone model and
plan. Keypad ergonomics and display screen size will play a
big part in how much you like this feature. (See Chapter 4,
“Wireless Data and the Wireless Internet—Do I Need It?” for
more information.)
I
Data/Fax Capable Allows you to use your phone as a
modem or a fax, if your wireless carrier supports this service.

Speeds are available up to 14.4 Kbps, but they vary by wireless
carrier (see Chapter 4,“Wireless Data and the Wireless
Internet—Do I Need It?” for more information).
The Cutting Edge
These features are available on a limited basis now, but they will be
widely available soon enough. Most of these features exist around the
idea of combining your wireless phone with your Palm or other PDA
(see Chapter 13,“The Future of Wireless Communications”) so you
end up with a phone, Palm, and Internet access in one device that goes
everywhere with you.
I
Business Card Exchange Allows you to use the infrared
port on your phone to send or receive data from other com-
patible phones or handheld devices.
I
Currency Converter Think of it as an advanced calculator
that helps you travel smart. If you are an international traveler,
this could be a very handy feature.
I
Infrared This is the physical feature that allows you to do all
that data beaming back and forth. Check around the
perimeter of the phone for a little red plastic rectangle.
I
MP3 Player This type of phone is a two-for-one bargain.You
only have to carry around one device and you get all your calls
and can listen to your favorite tunes in between calls.
I
Multicolor Display Screen Right now the colors being
offered are basic: red, blue, green, yellow. Some phones let
you switch from color to color for a monochrome view.
Other phones let you highlight certain features using the
colors. For example, your Mom’s number could be in red,
your best friend’s number in green, and your incoming stock
updates can be in blue.As the wireless Web applications
become more advanced, color may become more necessary.
I
Picture Messaging Allows you to store and send small
images with your text messages.The phone model may have
some pre-entered images already loaded.
I
Real-Time Clock Never have to set your clock again—let
your phone connect to the Internet and ﬁx itself.

Chapter 5 • The Components of a Wireless Phone
I
Speaker Phone Capability Eliminates the need for a
hands-free set, allowing you to do other tasks while you talk.
I
Sync Your Phone with a Palm or PC Whether you enter
your data on the go or in the ofﬁce, once you sync you will
have all of the information you need in all the places you use
it.This option requires additional software and may require
additional hardware.
I
To Do Lists Helps you keep up with your daily tasks. It also
coordinates with your calendar.
I
Voice Memo Recorder Need to remember something, but
don’t have time to enter it? Use your phone’s memo recorder
and leave yourself a message for later.
I
Predictive Text Input Sure, sending text messages, surﬁng
the Web, and using your phone as your Palm sound great, but
how are you going to enter all that data. One short-cut is to
sync with your PC.The other is to have this feature, predictive
text input. Using a stored dictionary, the phone “guesses” what
word you are typing in and lets you ﬁnish it faster.This fea-
ture also lets you insert certain words or phrases by using hot
keys you program yourself.

Chapter 5 • The Components of a Wireless Phone

Summary
The features available on a wireless phone are one way to differentiate
one phone from another. If you know the difference between the fea-
tures, you can quickly scan the lists of features and decide if a phone is
worth the price for you.You wouldn’t pay more for a car because it
comes with a steering wheel, and you shouldn’t pay more because a
phone offers different ring tones.
Knowing your preferences and potential uses is also important. If
you just need a phone that won’t break and won’t break your wallet,
any phone with standard features will suit your purposes. If you’re the
person on your block that always has the latest gadgets, then wireless
Web access is a must-have for you and your eye will be wandering
toward the PDA phones. If you are looking to combine all your devices
into one, then you are deﬁnitely looking at the cutting-edge phones.

Chapter 6 • Guide to Wireless Phones
Introduction
You have several options when selecting a phone that ﬁts your price
range, and with enough features to suit your lifestyle; there are many
diverse styles of phones.The form, color, and size of the phone you
carry can serve as a reﬂection of your character and speak volumes to
those around you as to what type of person you are.
As current general rules dictate, the most popular phones are
extremely small, thin, or lightweight.These days, it seems that just as
one manufacturer creates the smallest, lightest, or thinnest phone, there
is another company developing a phone that claims to be even better.
In addition to phones varying in size and weight, many phones let
you change the appearance of the phone by letting you change the
faceplate.The ability to make such transformations makes it feel as if
you have an entirely different phone, by spending only a small amount.
With so many options, the decision as to which style of phone is
right for you is a difﬁcult one to make. In this chapter, we explore the
variety of options that are available, hopefully making the choice clearer
for you.
Size and Weight
For the past couple of years, phones have become smaller and smaller,
to the point where it has become almost miraculous that even smaller
phones are being produced. In the 1980s, wireless phones ranged in size
from 8 to 12 inches. However, as with all technology, engineers devel-
oped methods of creating even smaller phones, to the point we are at
today, where we can tuck our phones away in a shirt or pants pocket
and forget about it.
Large Phones
Surprisingly enough, any phone that is more than ﬁve inches in length is
considered large.Additionally, these phones are usually the heaviest
phones on the market, with most weighing more than six ounces. Larger
sized phones may not necessarily be heavier than smaller phones, how-
ever, since several manufacturers are creating new phones that are long,
but extremely thin and light. If size or weight is a strong concern for you,
a small- or medium-sized, lightweight phone, which offers similar features
in a much more manageable size, may be a better option for you.

Some of the phones that are classiﬁed as large often are used in
promotions as free phones, but others, like the Kyocera (shown in
Figure 6.4), are the most advanced phones on the market today and can
be as expensive as $500. Figures 6.1 through 6.4 depict the most pop-
ular types of today’s large phones.

Medium-Sized Phones
A phone that is four to ﬁve inches long and three to ﬁve ounces in
weight qualiﬁes as medium-sized.These phones are typically in the
middle price range and have many of the latest features. Some exceptions
are phones that include the latest and greatest features, like the ability to
load and play MP3 music. Figures 6.5 through 6.8 are indicative of the
medium-sized phones that are most common with the general public.

Small or Compact Phones
Any phone shorter than four inches is considered to be small or com-
pact. In addition to being the smallest sized phones on the market, they
are usually the lightest.You will ﬁnd many of the cutting edge features
on these phones, including color screens and the ability to load pictures
that can pop up on the screen when certain people call you. Figures 6.9
through 6.11 illustrate some of the more popular compact phones avail-
able today.

Chapter 6 • Guide to Wireless Phones
Networks Available
Most of the phones available today are digital phones, but if they
operate only on a single digital frequency and not on the more ubiqui-
tous analog network, you may end up with a phone that works only in
very limited areas. Phones on the market today fall into three cate-
gories:
I
Single Mode 
I
Dual Mode
I
Tri-Mode
For more information regarding analog and digital technologies, see
Chapter 2,“Analog, Digital—What’s the Difference?”
Single Mode 
Some of the newest digital phones being introduced support only a
single digital network because the manufacturer wanted to get it to
market quickly to make sure they got the newest, coolest phone on the
shelf ﬁrst.All manufacturers produce single mode phones. But the
problem may be that it’s cool when it works downtown, but if you try
to use it when driving to your house in the suburbs you may be out of
luck. Before purchasing a phone, remember to check the phone’s speci-
ﬁcations, or ask a customer service representative to explain the phone’s
mode to make sure it will work everywhere you need it to work.
Dual Mode
Many digital phones are dual mode; that is, they work on two net-
works—digital and analog. Some of the phones that are available as dual
mode actually work on three networks—for example, the 800 MHz
analog network, the 800 MHz digital network, and the 1900 MHz dig-
ital network.These phones will allow you the most use, because they
are most likely to ﬁnd an available network wherever you are.
Tri-Mode 
A small number of phones available today are called tri-mode.This
means that they work on three frequencies: 800 MHz analog, 1900
MHz U.S. digital, and another international digital frequency.Tri-mode

phones are the ones that will work overseas in many countries around
the world.
Case Design
In addition to varying dramatically in dimension and weight, wireless
phones also differ greatly in their overall body style.All phones fall into
one of two categories:
I
Traditional
I
Flip 
Traditional Style 
Roughly 75 percent of wireless phones fall under the traditional design
category, incorporating a one-piece design, with keypad and screen in
plain view and accessible at all times. Nokia originally popularized the
traditional body style and has incorporated this design into most of the
phones it sells.The traditional-style phones vary dramatically in size in
weight. Figures 6.12 through 6.14 are good examples of the most
common traditional style.

Figure 6.13 The Motorola i2000

78
Chapter 6 • Guide to Wireless Phones
Flip Style
Flip style phones feature a cover that either partially or completely
encloses the phone in the closed position.The flip feature can serve
as an answer or end call function and protects the keypad and/or dis-
play screen, depending on the size of the flip. Almost all flip phones
can be classified as compact or small in terms of their size and
weight. Some of the most common flip phones can be seen in
Figures 6.15 through 6.17.
Color
Bermuda blue, gecko green, red pepper, brushed aluminum? With so
many options available, it is hard to decide which color will suit you
best.A phone that looks really fashionable when you purchase it may
lose its appeal as the months pass. One consolation is that there are sev-
eral phones available (i.e., Nokia 3360, Nokia 8290, and Kyocera QCP-
2035) that allow you to change the faceplate of the phone, virtually
giving you a brand new phone for just a fraction of the price. (See
Chapter 7,“Accessories for your Wireless Phone” for more information
on faceplates.)

Chapter 6 • Guide to Wireless Phones
Cost
Phone prices range from free to $600, with most of the phones aver-
aging between $100 and $200.The prices that you see are the retail
prices, which include the requirement to sign up for a service plan
when buying the phone. If you are looking to buy a phone without a
service plan, the prices tend to be higher.
In fact, there are few places where you can buy a phone without
the service plan attached today. Phones that cost $200 with a service
contract typically carry a list price of $500 if you would like to pur-
chase the phone without a designated service plan. Cellular service
providers pay a rebate to retailers in exchange for a service contract and
retailers pass on the cost savings to customers—as long as the service
contract remains in the deal.
You pay a premium for tiny, lightweight models whether they are dig-
ital or analog.Wireless phones that sell for under $100 are on the budget
plan.These phones are typically larger and heavier, with minimal features,
although they generally perform just as well as phones that are more
expensive. Mid-priced phones in the $100 to $250 range are smaller and
lighter, with extended-life batteries, alphanumeric text messaging, direc-
tory features, and more. High-end phones sell for $400 and up, and offer
the latest features, the smallest designs, and the most attractive styling.
Talk Time and Standby Time
Depending on how often you plan to use your phone, talk time and
standby time amounts are something that you should deﬁnitely consider
when selecting a wireless phone. If you are traveling across the United
States, do you want your phone to run out of power when you reach
Missouri? Of course not. However, if you plan on using your phone
only for short conversations and have the ability to recharge the phone
every evening, then talk time and standby time will not be as big of a
concern for you.Talk time is the actual amount of time spent on con-
versation, and standby is the time a phone is on and ready to receive a
call. Digital phones are more efﬁcient and have longer talk and standby
times than analog phones.A battery that offers 110 minutes talk
time/50 hours standby time in analog mode might deliver more than
three hours talk time or eight days standby when used with a digital
phone. If the battery runs out, it simply turns off the wireless phone
until you recharge it or you are able to replace the battery with a fully
www.getconnected.com

Guide to Wireless Phones • Chapter 6
81
charged one.A longer talk time could save you a lot of time and frus-
tration, but if you do not talk on your phone a lot, it could be unneces-
sary. Batteries generally have a range from 60 to 600 minutes for talk
time. Standby time ranges from 2 to 484 hours.
Another thing to remember when you look at the talk time and
standby time for a battery or phone—very seldom do you use only talk
time or only standby time; you typically use a combination of the two.
Just as your car’s mileage is better on the highway, your phone’s battery
lasts longer while you are not talking (standby). But always beware, just
like your car,“your mileage may vary” from what the manufacturer
states in the speciﬁcations.

Summary
There are many things to evaluate when deciding on the wireless
phone for you.The height, weight, features, and price are just some of
the things to consider when making your decision.
Quick References
Size and Weight
 For the past several years, phones have become smaller and
smaller.
 Large phones are ﬁve or more inches in length and usually
weigh more than six ounces.
 Medium phones are four to ﬁve inches in length and weigh
three to ﬁve ounces.
 Small or compact phones are less that four inches long and
usually weigh less than four ounces.
Networks Available
 Most of the phones available today are digital phones, but if
they operate on only a single digital frequency and not on the
more ubiquitous analog network, you may end up with a
phone that works only in very limited areas. Phones on the
market today fall into three categories:
I
Single mode 
I
Dual mode
I
Tri-Mode
Case Design
 In addition to varying dramatically in dimension and weight,
wireless phones also differ greatly in their overall body style.
All phones fall into one of two categories, traditional or ﬂip.
Color
 Phones come in many different colors.
 If you want to be able to change the color of your phone,
purchase one that allows you to change the faceplate.

Cost
 Phone prices range from free to $600, with most of the
phones averaging from $100 to $200.
 Most wireless phones must be purchased with a service plan
to get the retail pricing; buying a phone without a plan can
cause the price to skyrocket.
Talk Time and Standby Time
 Talk time is the actual amount of time spent talking on your
phone; it ranges from two to eight hours, depending on the
phone.
 Standby is the actual amount of time can be phone on and
ready to receive calls; it ranges from 50 to 300 hours,
depending on the phone.
Popular Wireless Phones
 Compare phones by service provider, price, weight, height,
mode, Internet capability, and text messaging capability.

Chapter 7 • Accessories for Your Wireless Phone
Introduction
When you are deciding on the wireless phone you want to buy, you
may want to consider what kind of accessories you will need.
Depending on how you use your phone, certain accessories, like a
hands-free kit or a cigarette lighter adapter, could come in quite handy.
If you are a fashion conscious individual, you may want to buy a colorful
faceplate or a light-up antenna.We especially recommend using a hands-
free kit in the car because talking on the phone while driving can prove
to be quite dangerous, and has even been outlawed in certain cities.
The accessories shown here are just a small number of the total
accessories available.We have broken them down into categories so you
can get an idea of the types of accessories you may want to add to your
phone purchase.The prices vary based on the model of phone and the
manufacturer of the accessory. Once you choose your phone, however,
make sure that the accessories you want are available for it before you
actually make the purchase.
Hands-Free Kits
Given recent national legislation outlawing operation of a wireless
phone while driving, hands-free kits quickly have become the most
popular type of accessory. Simple hands-free kits include an earpiece
www.getconnected.com

Accessories for Your Wireless Phone • Chapter 7
109
and microphone, allowing you to talk on your phone without using
your hands. Kits start at $20 and come in a variety of styles. Simple
hands-free kits come in a variety of styles, so it is important to check all
your options before purchasing. Many phones also come with a hands-
free earpiece/microphone, so check to make sure you do not buy one if
you don’t need to. Figures 7.1 and 7.2 show two the more popular
hands-free kits and car kits available today.
Car hands-free kits sometimes require professional installation
and include a microphone that typically attaches to a visor, a speaker
that is mounted near the dash, a cradle that holds the phone, and a
junction box where all cords connect. Prices range from $180 to
$300 for these more sophisticated kits, depending on the phone and
features.
Cases and Belt Clips 
Cases protect a phone from dust and moisture while still allowing you
to operate the phone. Dust and moisture can seep into your phone and
possibly ruin its inner circuitry. Cases are especially helpful if you know
that you will be submitting your phone to regular abuse because they
absorb some of the shock or cover the screen to prevent it from
cracking if dropped. Some cases cover the entire phone; others simply
protect the screen or keypad. Holsters are another kind of case that clip
onto your belt. Simply slide your phone in and out while the holster
remains fastened securely to your belt clip.These cases usually cost $10
to $20 on average.
www.getconnected.com

Chapter 7 • Accessories for Your Wireless Phone
Belt clips provide easy access to your phone when receiving a call.
Most belt clips also offer swivel features that allow you to access your
phone more easily. Holsters also cost between $10 and $20. Figures 7.3
through 7.5 show different types of carrying cases; the more common
types of belt holsters can be seen in Figures 7.6 and 7.7.

Chargers 
Phones are usually sold with standard AC battery chargers that you can
plug into the wall in your home or ofﬁce. Rapid travel chargers can
cut charging times in half. Charging times vary based on the type of
phone and battery.A typical rapid battery charger can charge a
lithium-ion (Li-Ion) battery used with a digital phone in two hours,
compared to four hours with a standard charger. Rapid chargers for
the car plug into the cigarette lighter adapter and can often provide a

full charge in two hours. Phones can often charge and be used for
conversation simultaneously, although the charging time lengthens
when the phone is in use.The price range for standard, rapid, and
vehicle chargers is between $15 and $30. Different types of chargers
can be seen in Figures 7.8 through 7.10.

Batteries 
All wireless phone batteries are rechargeable.A rechargeable battery can
accept 200 to 400 recharges before it needs to be replaced. Having a
spare charged battery ensures that you will always be able to make and
receive calls.Accessory batteries range from about $25 for a standard-
life battery to $80 for an extended-life lithium-ion battery. Battery
capacity is measured in talk time or standby time. Digital phones con-
sume less power than analog phones because the digital phones have
the ability to use the power they require more economically. Extended
lithium-ion batteries offer the best performance, usually allowing ﬁve
hours talk time or one to two weeks standby in digital mode.
The following is a breakdown of the three standard wireless phone
batteries: nickel cadmium (NiCad), nickel metal hydride (NiMH), and
lithium-ion (Li-Ion):
I
NiCad This is an older technology and has some technical
problems. Memory effect, also known as ledges, can reduce
the capacity of the battery if it is charged repeatedly without
being fully discharged. In addition, the battery must be dis-
posed of properly, because it is an environmental hazard.
I
NiMH  A newer technology that does not suffer from
memory effects like the NiCad battery. It also holds a charge
longer then the NiCad.
I
Li-Ion A long lasting and light battery that does not suffer
from memory effects. It is, however, more expensive than the
other battery types.
Faceplates 
If you’re the type of person who likes to change looks at a moment’s
notice, then a phone with the ability to change faceplates is the choice
for you. Faceplates allow you to feel like you have a new phone,
without having to shell out the cash.There are many different colors
and designs for many models of phones. If you want to be blue one day
and have tiger stripes the next, you can with certain phones. Look to
see if the phone you are interested in has changeable faceplates to be
sure you can customize your look. Faceplates usually cost under $20
and come in a variety of colors and textures.

Summary
Just as there are many wireless phones from which to choose, there are
even more phone accessories to consider buying.The basic categories of
accessories will help you determine if you need or want accessories.
Sometimes the accessories you want are necessities, like a car charger if
you use your phone while on the road. Other times, accessories can be
just for fun, like a faceplate that has your favorite college logo on it.And
wireless phone accessories make great gifts, too.You will get a standard
charger and a battery with your phone, although you may get more, like a
hands-free earpiece. If you want added convenience or added personaliza-
tion for your phone, then add some accessories when you buy your phone.

Chapter 8 • Understanding Service Plans
Introduction
Choosing your wireless phone is only one part of the puzzle—the
other piece is the wireless service or rate plan. Shopping for a wireless
plan can be an extremely overwhelming experience, especially if it is
your ﬁrst time.There are so many plans to choose from, so many
details, so many “great offers” to take advantage of. Understanding how
plans are structured, how they are priced, and how your usage patterns
ﬁt into these plans should help you ﬁnd the best plan for you.
Service plans have gone through some major changes over the
years. Originally, you would buy a rate plan, which would charge you
for simple network access, and for every minute you used to talk on
your wireless phone.You would be charged extra for long distance calls,
and if you wanted to use your phone while driving across the country,
forget it! You could use your phone when you were far away from
home, but you needed to carry a huge book with you full of 800 num-
bers to call based on where you were and on whose network you
would come up on—and then you would be charged incredible rates
per minute to make a call.That was early roaming—thankfully it is a
whole lot easier now, and a whole lot less expensive.
As wireless carriers are merging and forming more national net-
works, the nature of plan structures are also changing and becoming
more affordable.This affordability can be customized depending on
how you use your phone, as many service providers now offer different
ﬂavors of wireless rate plans:
I
All-inclusive plans, which offer one rate for all calls made or
received on that speciﬁc wireless carrier’s network
I
All-inclusive plans, which offer one rate for all calls made or
received on any wireless carrier’s network
I

local calling minutes
I

I

I

Understanding Service Plans • Chapter 8
121
Basically, there is something for everyone, which is why you need
to understand what this all means and how you will use your phone in
order to select the plan that is perfect for you.
Understanding Basic Plan Structures
After years of changing plan structures around, wireless service providers
seem to have agreed for the time being that offering three types of plans
makes the most sense.The three general types of plans are:
I
Local plans
I
Regional plans
I
National plans, available with or without roaming charges
Choosing the right type is key to getting the most for your
money.Although a local plan may offer you the most minutes per
dollar, it may not be the best plan for you if you travel frequently.
Choosing the best service plan for you will require you to understand
wireless plans, as well as to understand how, when, and where you plan
to use your phone. Refer to Table 8.1 for a quick comparison of the
different types of plans.
Local Plans
The service area (see Chapter 9,“Wireless Carriers and Service Areas”
for more information) for a local plan is usually your metropolitan
area and immediate surrounding areas. For example, a user with a
local plan in the Boston area would likely be able to make and receive
calls from inside the Boston metropolitan area and some of the sur-
rounding areas (some may include areas in Rhode Island, New
Hampshire, and Connecticut) without being charged extra fees.When
using your phone outside of your service area, you will be charged a
roaming fee. Some wireless providers will charge you a regional
roaming fee and a higher national fee, depending on where you are.
You should make sure you check out both the service area and
roaming rates of the plans you are considering.Additionally, if you are
making calls to places outside of your calling area, you will be charged
a long distance fee.

REALLY LOCAL WIRELESS
Cricket Communications is a unique wireless provider, as they pro-
vide only local service (currently in some areas of AZ, AR, CO, GA,
ID, KS, NM, NC, OK, PA, TN, UT, and WA). For around $30, Cricket
gives you unlimited local calling. Long distance charges are addi-
tional per-minute fees. Other wireless carriers are starting to offer
services similar to Cricket’s, such as NorthCoast PCS in Cleveland,
so this idea is catching on and may make sense if you use your
phone only in your local area. Another use for these types of wire-
less services are for use as a second phone line in your home
instead of adding another home phone number.
Regional Plans
Regional plans are the next level of service plans.They will be slightly
more expensive per minute than a local plan, but it may be well
worth it for you.The service areas for these plans include most of
your region; for example, most of the Northeastern states or
Southeastern states. If you travel and plan to use your phone in the
states surrounding yours, these plans are probably appropriate for you.
You will not be charged any roaming fees within your service area,
and you will not be charged long distance fees for making long dis-
tance calls from within your service area.You will be charged both
roaming and long distance fees (when applicable) for calls made from
outside of your service area.
National Plans without Roaming Charges
National plans (such as AT&T’s Digital One Rate plans, Cingular’s
Nation rate plans, or Verizon’s SingleRate plans) are examples of rate
plans with no additional roaming charge anywhere you make or receive
calls.These plans allow you to use your phone anywhere to call any-
where, without being charged roaming or long distance fees. Even
though these plans are the most expensive plans per minute, they may
be well worth your money if you travel extensively or make a consider-
able number of long distance calls per month.

Chapter 8 • Understanding Service Plans
National Plans with Roaming Charges
Some wireless carriers offer national plans with no roaming charges or
long distance fees when you are anywhere in the United States on their
network (for example, Sprint PCS).This is different from the other
national rate plans in that if you go outside of that wireless carrier’s net-
work into another network where you can make calls, you will be
charged roaming fees.This means that if you plan to use your phone
mostly in metropolitan areas where the wireless carrier’s network is
established, you will not be charged any additional fees. If you plan to
use your phone outside of their coverage areas, you will be charged
roaming fees.These national plans can be an excellent value if you will
be traveling across the country on the wireless carrier’s network. Just be
sure to check the coverage for the cities to which you plan on traveling.
NEXTEL AND VOICESTREAM NATIONAL PLANS
Nextel and VoiceStream are a little bit different as well. They, like
Sprint, have built their network in most major metropolitan areas.
Their current phones do not have the ability to work on an analog
network or other digital technology, so if you go off of their net-
work, you cannot make or receive calls.
Breaking Down Wireless 
Plans and Fees
Every wireless plan has some basics associated with it that you should
understand. Each plan has a monthly fee, a number of included min-
utes, and additional fees when you use your phone above what is
included in your monthly plan. For example, a typical wireless phone
plan (with local coverage) has a monthly fee of about $30 to $40, and
may include 400 local minutes.You would be charged additional fees
(say, $0.25 per minute) if you use more than your allotted monthly
minutes, if you make any long distance calls (another $0.25 per
minute), or if you make any calls from outside of your coverage area
(roaming fees of maybe $0.60 per minute). So that $30 to $40 plan can
end up costing you a great deal more if you don’t understand your plan
and what it includes (see Table 8.2).

you are allotted per month. Usually, the greater the number of
minutes included, the greater the monthly fee. Some plans
break their included minutes down further to let you know
when you can use them (i.e., anytime versus off-peak or
weekend minutes). Make sure you understand how these time
periods are broken down.
I
Monthly Fee This is the basic cost for one month of service.
I
Additional Per Minute Fee You will be charged a per-
minute fee after you have used all of your included minutes.
These fees can be as much as $0.45 a minute, so they can add
up quickly. Some service providers have ways you can check
to see how many minutes you have remaining on your
account for the month, but others do not.
I
Roaming Fees  These depend on the coverage of the plan
you choose, but you will be charged for using your phone
outside of your service area.You will be charged a per-minute
fee, and possibly a monthly roamer fee (usually around $3)
when you use your phone while roaming.
I
Long Distance Fees Again, depending on your plan, you
will be charged a per-minute fee for making calls to numbers
outside of your service region.
ALWAYS UNDERESTIMATE!
Wireless providers will often allow you to upgrade your plan if you
consistently use more minutes than your monthly allowance. You
may be required to renew your contract when you do this, but it
will probably be worth your while. However, they will not usually
allow you to downgrade your plan to a cheaper one. If you are not
sure which plan to go with, always go with the less expensive plan.
10 SECONDS = 1 MINUTE?
Most service providers have one-minute billing increments. This
means that on your bill, a ten second call counts as one minute.

YOU’RE NOT STUCK
You’re not stuck with the long distance service (and rates) that
your wireless provider offers. Ask the wireless sales representative
or customer service agent for other wireless long distance carriers
to see if you can save some money. Also, there are companies that
are similar to “dial-around” or 10-10 services from your home
phone. These companies can help cut your wireless long distance
bill and can help you make affordable international calls.
Additional Plan Features and Fees
There are many of other plan features that may be included in your ser-
vice plan, or you may choose to add onto your service plan. Each ser-
vice provider offers a different set of features, and will include different
features with their plans.The following includes a fairly standard list of
features to consider with your plan:
I
Activation Fee Most service providers will charge you a
one-time fee when you set up your service, usually along the
lines of $25 to $50.
I
Cancellation Fee Most wireless providers will also charge
you if you want to end your service before the end of your
contract.This can be as much as $150 to $250, so make sure
you know what it is before you cancel.
I
Taxes Depending on what state you live in, you will have to
add a couple dollars of taxes onto your monthly bill, as well as
a universal service fee.
I
Voice Mail Most service providers include some sort of
voice mail service in their plans. Enhanced voice mail service
may cost you extra, however.And consumers should keep in
mind that some service providers deduct minutes from your
included minutes when you check your voice mail from your
phone.
I
Caller ID The ability to see the number of the person
calling without answering the phone. Being able to screen
your calls can be a time and money saver.

Chapter 8 • Understanding Service Plans
I
Call Waiting The ability to receive incoming calls while on
the phone.
I
Call Forwarding The ability to send incoming calls to
another number. Even though the “ability” to do this is often
include in your plan, you may be charged for the airtime
when using it, or pay an additional per minute fee.
I
Three-Way Calling The ability to speak with two parties
simultaneously.
I
Wireless Internet Access The ability to access Internet-
based messages, news, and information from your phone.
I
Text Messaging The ability to receive textual messages on
your phone’s screen.
I
Directory Assistance Per-Call Fee Charging $0.99 per
call to call directory assistance is typical.
I
Mobile-to-Mobile Calling Some service providers offer
special rates for placing calls to other mobile customers on
their network.
I
Handset Insurance Most service providers offer you the
option to pay a monthly fee for insurance that will allow you
to replace your handset for free if it is lost or stolen.
I
International or Certain Country Calling Most wireless
carriers will restrict your calls to destinations in the United
States. Some are adding the ability to call Canada or Mexico
for a low monthly fee plus your minutes of use.
CONSERVE YOUR MINUTES
To conserve your minutes, you may want to check your voice mail
from a landline. Even though voice mail may be included in your
plan, the airtime will probably be deducted from your monthly
minutes.
The Prepaid Option
If you truly need a phone only for emergency uses (or very limited
use), it may be a good idea to consider prepaid plans (see Table 8.3).
ww.getconnected.com

Understanding Service Plans • Chapter 8
129
With prepaid plans, you don’t have a monthly fee or blocks of
monthly minutes. Instead, you purchase a package of minutes to use at
your convenience.When you run out of minutes, you purchase more.
One downfall of prepaid plans is that you will end up paying more
per-minute in lieu of the monthly fee you would be paying with a
standard plan. For most wireless providers, the more minutes you pur-
chase at once, the lower the “per-minute” cost will be (i.e., a $25 refill
card may work out to about $0.35/min, while a $100 card may work
out to about $0.25/minute).Additionally, the minutes that you pur-
chase won’t last forever. Most often, they will expire in two to three
months.

Chapter 8 • Understanding Service Plans
FOR THE CREDIT-CHALLENGED
All wireless service providers will run a credit check on you when
you order their service. Depending on what their criteria is and
what your credit history is, you may be required to have someone
cosign your account, you may have to give them a deposit, or you
may be denied service. Prepaid plans, however, do not require a
credit check, so this may be a good option for you. 
ww.getconnected.com

Summary
Wireless service providers generally offer three types of service plans
with three types of coverage: local, regional, and national.Within each
of those types, service providers offer plans with different numbers of
included minutes (the more minutes, the higher the monthly fee). Some
plans will include basic plan features. Beyond that, you will be charged
additional fees for extra features, for using more minutes than are in
your plan, or for roaming or long distance charges.
Quick References
Understanding Basic Plan Structures
 Local Plans You can use your included monthly minutes in
your local area, and will be charged roaming and long distance
fees outside of that.
 Regional Plans Your coverage area is larger than that of
local plans (usually most of your surrounding states).You will
be charged for roaming outside of your region.
 National Plans Your coverage area is the whole United
States.You will not be charged any roaming or long distance
fees regardless of where you are for some national plans, and
you will pay extra only when you go outside of the wireless
carrier’s network for other national plans.
Breaking Down Wireless Plans and Fees
 All plans have a basic monthly fee that includes a number of
allotted minutes every month.You will be charged for using
more minutes than are included in your plan.
 You will be charged roaming fees for making calls while out-
side of your coverage area.
 You will be charged long distance fees for making calls to
areas outside of your coverage area.
 Your plan will include some basic features like voice mail and
caller ID.You may be charged monthly for other features.

The Prepaid Option
 Prepaid plans are a good idea if you plan to use your phone
only in emergencies, or on a very limited basis.
 Prepaid plans allow you to pay as you go, so when you run
out of minutes, you buy more.
 Prepaid plans cost more per-minute than standard monthly
plans.

Chapter 9 • Service Providers and Service Areas
Introduction
So now you understand what wireless service plans are all about, how
the plans are structured, and how you will be billed (for more informa-
tion, see Chapter 8,“Understanding Service Plans”). Finding out what
service providers offer service in your area, what kinds of services they
offer, and which one has the best coverage, is a tough task. Each service
provider in your area will offer slightly different kinds of service. It’s
important to do your research to ﬁgure out which one will best meet
your needs.
What Services Are Available to You?
In most major cities in this country, you will ﬁnd that you have any-
where between three and eight wireless providers from which to
choose. Each of the service providers available in your area received
(bought) licenses from the FCC to offer wireless service in your area
and then built the wireless network from the ground up. Some of the
wireless carriers have been around for 20 years, and some have been
around only for four or ﬁve years.Although all networks are designed
to maximize the quality of each call made by the wireless customers,
some of the areas that supposedly are covered by the wireless carrier
have less than complete coverage.There are many factors that deter-
mine if the coverage area will be satisfactory or unsatisfactory—the
topography of the area, the number of users that will be using the net-
work, and the distance that the users are away from the closest tower.
Because each wireless carrier has built their own network, you will
never ﬁnd two wireless networks with the same voice quality in the
same place.The quality of service varies from service provider to service
provider.The quality of service from one provider will also vary from
city to city, as wireless carriers have developed their networks more
completely in some areas more than others. It is important that you
research the quality of service of the service provider that you are con-
sidering since you probably will be committing yourself to the service
for a year or so.
Wireless Service Providers
There are a multitude of wireless service providers out there—actually
between 350 and 400 licensed wireless carriers. Some service providers

you will recognize immediately, some service providers you may never
have heard of. Some offer national service, some regional, and some
offer only local service in just a few markets.Table 9.1 lists some of the
top service providers and what kind of coverage they offer with their
plans.This table also shows what kinds of rate plans are available from
the wireless carriers.A more complete service carrier directory can be
seen later in this chapter.

Finding Service Providers in Your Area
Simply paying attention to advertising is an easy way to ﬁgure out who
offers wireless service in your area.We’re sure that you have noticed
how inundated you are with ads for promotions and special offers on
wireless service in your area.To ﬁnd out if a speciﬁc service provider
offers service in your area, call them directly, or visit their Web site.You
can also visit www.getconnected.com to ﬁnd this information. Here,
you can enter your ZIP code and see all of the service providers and
plans that are available your area.

Chapter 9 • Service Providers and Service Areas
Service Areas 
The FCC defined the coverage areas and how they are broken down
from city to city when it sold licenses to the service providers. Each
metropolitan and rural area of the United States was mapped out and
given a number. Each wireless carrier knows within which areas it
can sell service and where they cannot.The networks that the wire-
less carriers have built have been based on where they are licensed to
sell service, and on their ability to cover those areas with their wire-
less signal.
You are probably used to seeing service areas represented by cov-
erage maps, which show you what areas are covered by your service
plan and what areas are roaming areas (for more information on
roaming, see Chapter 10,“Traveling:Your Domestic and International
Roaming Options”).These coverage maps typically show areas where
the wireless carrier offers service and areas where they will offer ser-
vice in the future. Although it is great that the service providers are
expanding their service areas, it will not help you if you live or work
in one of these future areas. Also, know that some maps represent the
areas where the wireless carrier allows you to use your phone
without getting charged roaming fees, but other maps represent
where the service provider has built its network.The difference
between these two types of rate plans are often referred to as rate
maps versus coverage maps.
Local Coverage
Figure 9.1 shows an example of a coverage map that represents the ser-
vice area for an AT&T Wireless local calling plan in Boston, MA.
In this example, the shaded area from Washington, DC to Maine
represents the home coverage area for the Boston service area.This is
the area where your included monthly minutes can be used. Outside of
this area, you would be charged roaming fees. In this case, there is only
one per-minute roaming rate, which would be charged anywhere on
the map that is outside of the shaded states. Some service providers will
charge you different roaming rates when you are outside of your home
service area but still in your general region, than they will if you are
roaming outside the region.You will also notice that there are some
areas on this map where there is no wireless service at all, shaded in

dark gray (for example, in northwestern Maine).These are areas where
there is no wireless system built that will work with the technology of
AT&T Wireless phones.
Regional Coverage
Figure 9.2 shows an example of a coverage map for a regional plan for
the northeastern United States from AT&T Wireless.
Notice the differences between the shaded area of this map and
that of the local plan.The shaded area is still the home coverage area,
but this area is much larger, extending from North Carolina to Maine.
And again, areas outside of the shaded area would be charged roaming
fees, with the darkest gray areas not offering any service.
National Coverage
Some service providers offer national coverage.This means that they
have built their networks across a good part of the country and offer
service in most major metropolitan areas, or they have agreements with
other service providers in areas where they have not built their net-
work. Over the past year or so, there has been a trend among wireless
service providers to merge and become larger, national providers.These
service providers are able to offer wireless customers all-inclusive,
single-rate plans.The Yankee Group, one of the leading telecommunica-
tions industry analyst companies, estimates that national service
providers account for about 75 percent of all wireless subscribers in the
United States. Figures 9.3 through Figure 9.6 represent some of the
wireless service providers who have a national network and offer
national coverage service plans.
NOTE
Verizon’s map (which can be seen on page 140) is not a map of
where your wireless phone will work, but rather a map to show
where your wireless phone will be charged the rates you signed up
for under their Single Rate plans. There are still areas of the
country where you will not be able to make or receive calls.

Chapter 9 • Service Providers and Service Areas
Quality of Service
Any wireless phone user will tell you that they do not always have per-
fect service. One of the trade-offs between being able to use your
phone while driving is that the science of wireless is not perfect.
Everyone occasionally must deal with dropped calls, dead spots in cov-
erage, and weak signals. But if you do your research to ﬁnd out which
of the service providers in your area have the best service, you can min-
imize these annoyances.

Why Is Service Quality Inconsistent?
Your service quality may vary from time to time based on a number of
factors including, but not limited to, the weather, your distance from a
tower, and large obstacles (such as buildings), which cause service inter-
ference. If you travel extensively, you may also ﬁnd that call quality
varies from city to city, as service providers are still expanding their net-
works, and they have done so at different rates in different cities.You

Chapter 9 • Service Providers and Service Areas
may notice that, on your drive to work, for example, that your recep-
tion gets fuzzy in the same place everyday.This may be because, as you
are driving, you are driving away from one service tower, and into the
service of another tower.The area where you are “handed off” from
one tower to the next may not have very strong service. Or, you may
notice areas in large buildings where you cannot get service (e.g., the
elevator, basement, or even areas behind some hills and mountains).The
signal cannot penetrate through the thick walls and sometimes has
trouble reaching phones in the “shadow” of a hill or mountain.
Who Has the Best Service?
This is a tricky question, because the answer is different in every city.
And the answer may even be different depending on where you live or

around a city.The best way to ﬁnd out who has the best service is to
ask friends and neighbors who use their phones in the same places you
plan to use yours. Even though one service provider is known for
having great service in your city, they may not have the best service in
your immediate area or where you need to use your phone (i.e., if you
can’t get service in your house or on your drive to work, you may
have a slightly different opinion of their service). Keep in mind that
you will not ﬁnd a service provider that has perfectly complete cov-
erage, and that all service providers are working to expand and
improve their networks.

Summary
There are most likely a handful of service providers that offer wireless
service in your area. Each will offer a variety of different service plans
from which to choose with different types of coverage and service
plans. It is important to understand the coverage area on which your
service plan is based, to make sure that you are not charged more than
you are expecting when you use your phone.The quality of service you
will get when using your wireless phone will also vary from service
provider to service provider, from city to city, and from place to place
within a city.Your best resource in ﬁnding good coverage is to talk to
people who use the service in those areas, so do your homework before
signing up with a service provider.
Quick Reference
What Services Are Available to You?
 There are between three and eight service providers who
offer service in most major metropolitan areas.
 Quality of service will vary from service provider to service
provider and from city to city.
 Service providers offer different kinds of coverage and dif-
ferent kinds of service plans.
Service Areas
 Wireless plans are based on service areas that are deﬁned by
the FCC who licensed the rights to the wireless carriers.
 Service areas are represented by coverage maps, showing the
areas that the wireless carriers have built their networks to
cover with their signal.
 Check out coverage maps closely to make sure you under-
stand your service area, and also understand that some wire-
less carriers present their maps as rate maps, showing where
you can expect to pay their rates, if you have coverage to
make a call.

Quality of Service
 Factors such as weather, your distance from a tower, and large
obstacles (such as buildings) can cause your service quality to
vary.
 Quality will also change as you get “handed off” between ser-
vice towers.
 All service providers have dead spots in their coverage, or
areas where their signal doesn’t reach.Talk to friends and
neighbors to make sure you will have coverage where you
will need it.

Chapter 10 • Traveling: Your Domestic and International Roaming Options
Introduction
Do you travel a lot? If you travel outside of the home calling area or
zone of your local service provider network, you can incur roaming
charges, which means a surcharge will be applied for all calls you either
make or receive from your wireless phone.The charges will vary from
wireless carrier to wireless carrier but are explained in the details of all
service plans.
When you travel in the United States, you can make calls from
almost anywhere—the only question is if you will be charged extra for
the call or if it is covered in your rate plan. National rate plans usually
include roaming charges so you don’t have to pay any extra for calling
from far away from your home. Regional calling plans usually include
your region—the Northeast, the Northwest, and so on, as deﬁned by
your service provider, and calls from those areas are usually at no extra
cost. Local calling plans, however, tend to allow calls only from your
immediate local area—your city or surrounding towns—and when you
travel a few states away or to the other side of the country, you will
have to pay extra per minute to make and receive wireless calls.
If you try to use your phone outside of the United States, the
chances are that it probably will not work.There are a few exceptions
to that rule based on three factors:
I
The country that you are in
I
The service provider that you have
I
The type of phone that you use
The types of services and wireless phones you can use outside of
the United States is presented later in the chapter.
What Is Roaming?
When you use your phone outside of your local calling area (as deﬁned by
your service provider), you are roaming on another wireless provider’s net-
work.Airtime minutes used when roaming are generally not part of your
basic calling plan. Check your service provider’s plan details to determine
when you are roaming, and how you are charged for these calls (see
Chapters 8 and 9 for more on service providers and service areas).
On the display screen of most digital phones, a symbol will indicate
when you are roaming.The symbol will vary from phone to phone, but

typically will be ROAM, Extended Area, R, or some other indicator
that is different than when you are in your home area.
Roaming was one of the most challenging issues the cellular phone
industry faced in the early days.The goal was simple: a phone that could
be used anywhere in the United States or the world where a compatible
network is available.The difﬁcult part is getting various systems to com-
municate and pass routing and billing information to each other.
When the initial cellular carriers built their networks, they enabled
wireless phones from other networks to operate on their network only
after dialing a special roamer port toll-free number prior to dialing the
phone number you wanted to call. So, in order to use your Dallas-based
phone in San Francisco, you would need to look up the roamer
number, dial it, listen for another dial tone and then dial the complete
11-digit phone number for whom you wanted to call.And your bill
may not reﬂect the charges for your call for a couple months.The chal-
lenge of making the ability to roam seamless and keep the billing
simple did not happen until years after the cellular carriers launched
their service.The fees associated with roaming included a high daily or
monthly fee and a high per-minute fee, which varied by location.
Domestic Roaming Options
Virtually every service provider offers domestic roaming options regard-
less of which service plan you select. (Go to www.GetConnected.com
for a comprehensive listing of plans available in your area.) However,
there are always exceptions to the rule. For example, Cricket does not
offer roaming service. Once you are outside of their coverage area, there
is no service.Another example is Nextel, who offers service on their
network across the United States and around the world; however, you
cannot use their phones where they do not have coverage.This has to
do with the type of network their phones work on—the newer digital
networks are not as widely available as analog networks, which are the
default networks for many who travel outside their areas.This is a good
thing to keep in mind as you research your roaming options.
When you are using your phone outside of your home area, you
will most likely not even notice that you are roaming unless you see a
roaming symbol on your phone, as mentioned previously.The sound
quality usually remains the same as when you are using your phone
from your local calling area. In some isolated areas in the country, your

Chapter 10 • Traveling: Your Domestic and International Roaming Options
wireless carrier may not have an agreement with whoever the local car-
rier is to allow seamless roaming calls, and you may end up being con-
nected to a roaming call service.These services usually start off with a
message like “Thank you for calling Wireless Express.We are happy to
place your wireless call for $1.95 per minute. Please enter your credit
card number now.”At this point, you have to decide if this call is really
important enough to pay $1.95 per minute for! Sometimes it is worth
the extra per-minute fee, especially in emergency situations when you
really need to get a call through.
As with any other calling feature, prices and options for domestic
roaming vary by where you live and which service provider you
choose. If you are the type of person that travels within the United
States quite often, you should look for a plan that offers the following:
I
Coverage with no roaming costs in the cities and towns from
which you will be making your calls.
I
Low roaming costs per minute with roaming coverage in all
the areas to which you will travel.
I
A service that will work when outside your home area at all
times. Some new wireless services offer unlimited local calling
for a ﬂat fee per month but do not offer the ability to roam
outside of your local area.
The following sections offer some additional details for the top selling
service providers and some of their roaming options to give you an idea of
what they offer. Refer to Chapter 9,“Service Providers and Service Areas”
for a listing of service providers and their domestic coverage maps.
AT&T Wireless: AT&T Digital One Rate Plans
These plans are great for frequent travelers:
I
No roaming fees—you can be on anywhere in the United
States where digital service is available.
I
There are no additional domestic long distance charges for
calls made to anywhere in the United States from anywhere in
the United States.
I
A digital multi-network phone is required.
I
Total minutes included vary from 450 to 2000 minutes per
month.

or visit the AT&T Digital Wireless Web site at www.attws.com.
Sprint PCS: Real Nationwide Long Distance
Sprint PCS plans have consistently added more customers per quarter
than any wireless carrier in the United States.They are great for
someone that travels around the country and needs coverage in major
metropolitan cities and their surrounding towns. Sprint PCS currently
covers over 300 metropolitan areas across the United States. Features
include the following:
I
Sprint PCS plans work in any Sprint PCS coverage area
across the country.This means on any plan you can call to
anywhere in the United States from your mobile phone and
you can call from any city in the United States that Sprint
PCS has covered.
I
Nationwide long distance is included when calling from the
Sprint PCS network.
I
Roaming is not included when off of the Sprint PCS net-
work, but no roaming fees apply when you are on their net-
work anywhere in the United States.
I
Roaming is $0.39 per minute outside Sprint’s network within
your home area and $0.69 per minute outside Sprint’s net-
work outside of your home area.
I
Included minutes vary from 40 to 3000 minutes per month.
Refer to Chapter 9 for more information on Wireless Service Plans
or visit the Sprint PCS Web site at www.sprintpcs.com.
Verizon Wireless: National SingleRate
SM
Verizon offers national plans (SingleRate) that are very similar in struc-
ture to the AT&T Digital One Rate plans:
I
Verizon offers the largest coverage area in the United States
and is the largest wireless carrier with the most customers.You
can call from anywhere there is digital or analog service; how-
ever, a tri-mode phone is required in order to get full service
with the Verizon Wireless national plans.

International Roaming Options 
Now that you know what to look for in order to make calls across the
United States, what about taking your wireless phone outside of the
US? This brings us to international roaming, which is quite bit more
complicated than domestic roaming.
The challenge that was overcome to allow seamless roaming
across the United States was simple in comparison to the ability to
take your phone with you around the world.The United States wire-
less carriers all operate on the same frequencies as licensed by the
FCC—either the cellular, or 800 MHz frequencies, or the PCS, or
1900 MHz frequencies—but they do not operate using the same dig-
ital technologies. So where your phone will work across the country
is dependent on the network that your phone uses—CDMA, GSM,
or TDMA. In many areas of the world, the type of network is not the
problem since the GSM standard is the primary technology for deliv-
ering cellular service to people in foreign countries. However, the
GSM frequency used for wireless phones internationally differs from
the frequencies on which GSM operates within the United States.
The European frequency is at 900 MHz, but the U.S. GSM fre-
quency is at 1900 MHz. Even GSM carriers in the United States like
VoiceStream have trouble operating in Europe unless the customer
buys a phone that works on both the U.S. frequency and the
European frequency.The customer will be able to use that phone
only in specific parts of the world. For instance, South America
works primarily on TDMA and many other areas use CDMA (see
“Guide to International Carriers,” later in this chapter).
www.getconnected.com

Traveling: Your Domestic and International Roaming Options • Chapter 10
165
The basics of using your wireless phone around the world are the
following:
I
The phone must operate on the network where you plan on
traveling.
I
Expect to be charged extra for calls made and received while
abroad.
I
Some international offers require a different phone than the
one you use in the United States, which you typically lease.
I
When you use your phone in other countries, your level of
service may not be what you have come to expect in the
United States, with instant connections and simple dialing,
you may need to dial additional numbers and call through
operators when you need to make calls.
I
Per minute fees vary by country and service provider.
I
Fees could vary depending on whom you call.You may be
charged one fee for placing calls to another cellular phone,
and be charged a different fee for placing calls to traditional
landline phones.
I
The countries where you will be able to use your interna-
tional wireless phone will vary greatly from wireless carrier to
wireless carrier—check the details of the international plans
for each wireless carrier.
Many U.S.-based service providers offer international roaming
(including Nextel,VoiceStream,WorldCell, and AT&T Wireless, which
are all discussed next). If you are looking speciﬁcally for a wireless plan
with international roaming options, you may be limited to speciﬁc
plans or need to have the international calling plan added to your reg-
ular service plan at an additional per month fee.
Nextel WorldwideSM
Nextel offers a wireless phone, the Motorola i2000plus, which works
anywhere in the world where Nextel has a working network (currently
over 80 countries). For more information you should visit their Web site
at www.nextel.com/phone_services/worldwide/NWWservices.shtml.
You do not have to have a separate phone, a different phone number, or
www.getconnected.com

166
Chapter 10 • Traveling: Your Domestic and International Roaming Options
a different bill.There are additional charges to use your phone over-
seas—a speciﬁed ﬂat rate per minute based on the country you are in.
Anyone trying to reach you can just dial your wireless phone number
and your phone will ring wherever you are in the world on Nextel’s
network, making this one of the simplest international offers.
AT&T WorldConnect® Service
AT&T Wireless (www.attwireless.com) offers a program called AT&T
WorldConnect that lets you use your existing wireless phone account
and phone number in many countries around the world, but not your
wireless phone.AT&T will lease you a GSM phone, which will be pro-
grammed to receive calls from people dialing your regular wireless
phone number.The charges show up on your monthly bill.This service
is available in many countries across Europe,Asia,Africa,Australia, Latin
America, and the Middle East.The ability to use your existing phone
number and pay for the international use on your normal wireless bill
allows you to change few things before traveling abroad.
VoiceStream
VoiceStream’s (www.voicestream.com) network uses the GSM standard,
which is the most prevalent standard around the world. If you buy a
wireless phone from VoiceStream that is capable of operating on the
GSM frequency in other countries as well as in the United States, for
example the tri-mode Ericsson World Phone, then you can use the
same phone here and in many places around the world. If you are a
current VoiceStream customer, you can also rent a tri-mode phone for
your international travels, if you do not have one.The calling patterns
may change from country to country, and the rate will be based on
where in the world you are, but the charges will all show up on your
regular bill and you do not need to have a separate phone.VoiceStream
has recently merged with Germany’s Duetsche Telecom, which will
prove to increase the global roaming capabilities for anyone traveling
between here and there.
WorldCell
There are some companies that have created partnerships with wireless
carriers around the world and will rent or sell you a phone that will

work in over 100 countries.These services are available for weekly or
monthly use and are available for ordering right over the Web or the
phone.
WorldCell (www.worldcell.com) offers many types of phones that
will work around the globe, and lists the prices for calls from many
countries as roughly between $1 and $3 per minute.As with the other
international roaming options, the typical user will be a business person
who needs to be in touch wherever he or she is, or a vacationer who
wants the security he or she enjoys at home with a wireless phone in
the glove box.WorldCell service is a great way to make sure you are in
touch while globetrotting.

Summary
Roaming per-minute fees can be pricey (typically $0.35 to $1 per
minute plus long distance charges in the United States and up to 
$3+ per minute internationally). If you plan on making a significant
number of calls to your family back in New York while on your
month-long trip to London and you have a domestic wireless plan,
be prepared for a big bill that month and you may have to carry a
different wireless phone than the one you use at home. As wireless
service becomes more and more popular across the globe, interna-
tional calling and roaming will become more available and less
expensive.You can make calls from almost anywhere in the world
using a satellite phone, but the cost of the phone (up to $1500) and
the calls per minute (approximately $2) may not make it the best
option for you.

Chapter 11 • Understanding Special Deals and Promotions
Introduction
There are many types of promotions to look for when signing up for
wireless service—not just one-time freebies that you get for signing up
for a new service plan.Wireless carriers offer rebates, service credits,
more minutes, free advanced services, free accessories, and additional
incentives for signing longer contracts.These promotional offers can be
combined with offers from the wireless phone manufacturers and offers
from the retailer. Finding the right promotion can signiﬁcantly change
the value of a plan over the length of a contract.
What about the ﬁne print? Every promotion has ﬁne print and wire-
less promotions are no exception.The promotions always have expiration
dates.They are available only on some plans or certain plan/phone com-
binations.They give you free features that work only with advanced
phones.The additional minutes may all be during off-peak hours when
you are more likely to be sleeping than using your phone.
How do you sort through it all? Relax, sit back, and read through
the following tips and tricks from veteran wireless phone researchers.
PROMOTIONS AT GETCONNECTED.COM
All of the promotions you will see on the home page and throughout
the site are promotions that are currently available through
www.GetConnected.com. If you click on any of the promotions, it will
lead you to the plan(s) that are eligible for that promotion.
Types of Promotions
First you want to determine the types of promotions that are being
offered to you to by the service providers to see which ones may make
your wireless service cost less, and which ones you will not need or will
not use.The following types are the most common, but creative mar-
keting teams are always working on new ones!
Service Credits
Service credits are similar to rebates, but the dollar amount is credited
automatically to your bill. Sometimes the service credits are spread out
over a certain length of time to ensure that you stay with the service.
www.getconnected.com

Understanding Special Deals and Promotions • Chapter 11
173
Because service credits are applied automatically to your bill, service
credits are more valuable to you than rebates as they require no effort
on your part to redeem from the service provider.
Rebates
Rebates range in dollar value, but they have one thing in common.You
have to send in the required information (receipts, wireless phone
number, etc.) to get them. Many rebates also have length-of-service
restrictions that require you to have your service activated for a certain
number of days or months, before you can send it in. Rebates are a great
way to get you to buy, but they should be only a part of your decision,
especially if you are not certain that you will get around to sending it in.
And don’t forget to send in the rebate or the value for you goes to zero.
More Minutes: “Sign Now and 
Get 1000 More Minutes!” 
This could be a great value—but then again, maybe not.There are
many questions to answer before you can decide:
I
Is it 1000 minutes each month or 1000 minutes over a one-
year contract? 
I
Are the 1000 minutes anytime minutes or just night and
weekend minutes? 
I
Are the 1000 minutes only in your local coverage area or any-
where on the network?
I
Are long distance calls included?
I
Are incoming calls included?
After you know the answers to all of those questions you can
decide if a free minute promotion is important to you or not.
Free Advanced Services: “Get One Year 
of MusicPlayer Free (A $120 Value)!” 
Are you already planning on buying the more expensive phone that sup-
ports this service? If so, then this is a great deal for you. If not, then this
promotion doesn’t mean anything to you. Other advanced services that
are promoted this way include Wireless Internet access or text messaging.
www.getconnected.com

174
Chapter 11 • Understanding Special Deals and Promotions
Contract Length-Based Incentives: 
“Sign Up for a One-Year Contract 
and Get Free Long Distance!” 
These types of promotions offer a variety of incentives, but they all
have one thing in common: you have to sign a one- or two-year con-
tract to get them. First, you have to decide if you are willing to
commit to a single service provider for a year or more. If you aren’t
willing to sign a long-term agreement, then you should stop looking at
these promotions. If signing a service agreement of an extended period
of time is not a problem for you, then you should examine the details
of what the service provider is actually offering you.The most
common incentives are free standard features such as long distance,
mobile-to-mobile calling minutes, or additional rebates. If you were
going to choose one of these options anyway, then this could be a
great deal for you.
Free Accessories: “Sign Up Now 
and Get a Free Headset Kit!”
These types of promotions offer you a tangible incentive, but make sure
you know the real value of what you are getting. Many headsets can be
bought for prices as low as $9.99 if you shop around. Is the service
provider offering you a free rapid charger? All phones come with a bat-
tery charger, otherwise how would you be able to keep using it?
Everyone loves free stuff, but view these types of promotion as gravy
after you have decided what service plan and phone you really need.
COMBINING PROMOTIONS
Q: Can I get more than one promotion?
A: Absolutely! Unless the promotion says “not available with other
offers” it can be combined with other promotions for which the
plan or phone qualiﬁes. 
Q: Why don’t they just make it all one big offer? 
A: Frequently the offers are from different sources; one from
the wireless carrier, one from the phone manufacturer, and one
from the retailer. Also different types of promotions may be
running over different time periods.
www.getconnected.com

Understanding Special Deals and Promotions • Chapter 11
175
Helpful Hints
Reading the ﬁne print is key for all promotions.Wireless carriers use
promotions to sell more of a certain type of plan or more of a certain
type of phone.You need to know what the restrictions on the promo-
tion are so that you can make sure your service plan choice qualiﬁes for
the promotion in question. Otherwise you could be disappointed once
you get your ﬁrst bill.
Limited Time Offer
Your wireless account will most likely need to be activated prior to the
expiration date, not just ordered, in order for you to qualify for the pro-
motion. If you waited until the last minute and something holds up
your order, you could lose out on the promotion.
Plan Restrictions
Plan restrictions refer to promotions that are valid only on plans 
with a certain monthly fee level and above.The promotion may be
further restricted to only local or only regional plans. Sometimes it is
just as important to understand what the restrictions on the promo-
tion are to truly understand what the promotional offer means to the
consumer.
Phone Restrictions
Some promotions are valid only if you buy a particular name brand or
model phone with a service plan within a certain price range. Or the
promotion may be for a service that is supported only on certain
phones.This is usually the case with features that are supported on
advanced phones only.
Minutes
How many minutes are too many? If you could talk for 24 hours
straight, you could use up 1440 minutes. Unless you are a teenager,
that’s almost impossible. More conservatively, if you talked for six hours
every weekend in a month, you would use up 1440 minutes. Before
you get overly impressed by the number of free minutes that you are
entitled to with the special offer, do the math.
www.getconnected.com

176
Chapter 11 • Understanding Special Deals and Promotions
The restrictions on the minutes are also important to check. Unless
the minutes ﬁt into your already determined usage times and patterns,
they won’t be valuable to you.
Services You’ll Never Use
Can’t pass up free long distance? Think again. If you don’t call anyone
outside of your metro area, you won’t get a lot of value. Free mobile-
to-mobile minutes? Are your local friends on the same network? If not,
try another promotion. Free Wireless Internet service? Is your phone
compatible? Have you tried it out to see if the usability will work for
you? The Internet service has been available for several years, but if you
aren’t comfortable with the limitations you won’t use it.
www.getconnected.com

Summary
Promotions are geared to get you to buy.They are supposed to look
like great deals and great values, and sometimes they are. Service
credits and rebates are guaranteed great values. Depending on how you
plan to use your phone, a promotion can increase the overall value of
your new plan. More minute promotions are like a free upgrade, if the
more minutes ﬁt your already determined usage patterns. Contract
length incentives are great deals, as long as you aren’t planning on
moving out of town next month. If you have already decided that you
need certain features or accessories, then these types of promotions
will be helpful to you.
The important thing to remember is that you should put your basic
needs before the promotions that make your heart race.Think of pro-
motions as extra values rather than as the main reason you are buying.A
plan that meets your everyday needs will save you more money than
free stuff that you never use.

Frequently Asked Questions 
about Phones
When you look at the hundreds of phones that are on the market
today, you are going to have questions about them.The previous chap-
ters gave an overview of the basics and differences. Here we will list
some of the most common questions with the short answers.
What are the differences between 
analog and digital phones?
I
Analog phones operate by sending and receiving signals in a
continuous sound wave; digital phones send and receive mes-
sages by converting sounds and voices into numeric code.
I
Analog phones generally are less expensive than digital
phones, but the service is usually more costly.
I
Analog phones have shorter talk and standby times than dig-
ital phones.
I
Analog phones offer more complete coverage in rural areas.
I
Digital phones offer better voice quality.
I
Digital phones have a longer battery life.
I
Many digital phones also work on analog networks.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 2.
What is the difference between 
PCS and cellular?
I
Phones that operate on a PCS system (personal communica-
tions service) use digital technology and offer advanced fea-
tures like caller ID.
I
Cellular phones can use either digital or analog technology,
or both.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 3.

Frequently Asked Questions • Chapter 12
183
What is Third Generation? 
The Third Generation (3G) mobile devices and services are the next
wave. 3G will provide the capacity for online, real-time transfer of
information, regardless of time and place. For example, you will be able
to send images or participate in live video conferencing by using your
3G mobile communications device.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 13.
What is a dual-band phone?
A dual-band phone is a PCS phone (digital) that can operate on analog
cellular networks when it is out of range of PCS network antennas.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 6.
What battery has the longest life, 
NiMH or Li-Ion?
Lithium-ion (Li-Ion) batteries tend to offer the longest talk times and
standby times in a lightweight package—and tend to be the most
expensive. Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries are the reliable
standard that offer average talk times (2 to 5 hours) and standby times
(24 to 48 hours).
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 7.
What is the difference between talk time 
and standby time? 
Talk time is the amount of time you spend conversing on your wire-
less phone, either making outgoing calls or receiving incoming calls.
Standby time is the amount of time that you have your phone on, but
are not actually talking on it.You do not have three hours of talk time
and thirty hours of standby time on one battery; you have either three
hours maximum to talk or thirty hours maximum to be on standby.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 8.
Frequently Asked Questions about
Service Rates and Plans
Even after you know all about the different rate plans, services, options,
and features you may still have a few questions that you want clariﬁed.
If this is the case, you are not alone.

Chapter 12 • Frequently Asked Questions
Why is the quality of my wireless service
sometimes inconsistent?
Your service quality may vary from time to time based on a number of
factors including, but not limited to, the weather, your distance from a
tower, and large obstacles (such as buildings) causing service interference.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 9.
Which wireless carrier has the best signal strength?
It depends.As mentioned earlier, the quality of your service will depend
on where you live, work, and play.Your best resources for this question
are your friends and family.They can tell you ﬁrst hand what their
experience with a network in your area has been.
What is roaming?
When you use your phone outside of your local calling area (as
defined by your wireless carrier), you are roaming on another wire-
less carrier’s network. Airtime minutes used when roaming are gener-
ally not part of your basic calling plan. Check your wireless carrier’s
plan details and coverage maps to determine when you are roaming,
and how you are charged for these calls. Most wireless carriers also
send an indicator to your screen display to tell you when you are
roaming.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 10.
If it is called a nationwide plan, then why are 
there roaming charges?
Nationwide plans tend to have no roaming charges if you are in your
wireless carrier’s network area. If you wander over to another wireless
carrier’s network, then you may incur roaming charges.
Although many of the nationwide wireless carriers have extensive
physical networks built, they don’t have every square inch of the United
States covered. So you could have a nationwide plan based in New York
City, and when you travel to Dallas, San Francisco, and Des Moines, you
may have no roaming charges.Then when you take a day trip to rural
Pennsylvania, you wind up with roaming charges. It’s not how far away
you go, but exactly where you go.
www.getconnected.com

Frequently Asked Questions • Chapter 12
185
What plans do not charge for roaming?
Find the plan that covers the areas in which you travel and you will be
all set. If you are trying to ﬁnd a plan that has absolutely no roaming
charges ever, then look for a service plan that will work with phones
that can work on digital and analog networks, and which states that
there are no roaming fees on any network.
How do I know which mode my phone is in?
Your phone display will have an indicator or symbol to show if you are
in a digital or analog mode.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 10.
What do peak and off-peak hours indicate?
Peak hours refer to the hours of highest wireless phone usage.Typically,
peak minutes are billed at a service plan’s highest rate. Conversely, off-
peak hours refer to the hours of the lowest wireless phone usage, and
are billed at lower rates.
Peak and off-peak times vary signiﬁcantly by wireless carrier. Check
the details to know for sure. Peak hours typically are between the hours
of 7 A.M. and 7 P.M., Monday through Friday. Off-peak hours include
the weekends, some holidays, and the hours from 7 P.M. to 7 A.M. during
the week.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 8.
How do service providers count anytime minutes 
versus evening and weekend minutes?
If you call during peak times, you will be using your anytime minutes. If
you call during off-peak times, you will be using your evening and
weekend minutes. If you call during peak times and talk straight through
to off-peak times, the minutes you talk during peak time are counted
toward your anytime minutes and the minutes you talk during off-peak
time automatically switch over to your evening and weekend minutes.
Do I get charged when people call me?
Yes.You are billed for the amount of airtime minutes that you use,
regardless if the call is incoming or outgoing. However, some service
providers have a feature that offers a free ﬁrst minute of incoming calls.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 8.

186
Chapter 12 • Frequently Asked Questions
Does it use up my minutes when I 
call other wireless phones?
Sometimes. Some service providers also offer a mobile-to-mobile fea-
ture for a monthly fee.This nice beneﬁt allows you free local calls to
other users of your service provider’s wireless phone service. If you call
a wireless phone on another network, you will be charged the same
number of minutes as if you called a regular phone number.
When I call my voice mail 
am I using my minutes?
It depends on the wireless carrier and the plan.When you call to
retrieve your voice mail messages, you may be charged airtime minutes.
You will need to read the ﬁne print or call customer service to verify
this on a carrier-by-carrier and plan-by-plan basis.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 8.
What is considered a long distance call?
A wireless call is considered to be long distance if it is placed to a
number outside of your local calling area (which is deﬁned by your ser-
vice provider). Make sure you’re familiar with the boundaries of your
service provider’s coverage map and local calling area.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 9.
Are toll free number calls free?
No.You will not be charged a long distance charge to call a toll free
number; however you will be charged airtime for the minutes you are
using your phone to call the toll free number.
What is the farthest I can call from my wireless phone?
You can call any phone number around the world with some wireless
carriers, but many restrict international calling. Read the details of the
service plan to see if international calling is allowed at all or if there is
an extra monthly fee to allow it.
Can all cellular phones be used worldwide? 
No.To be able to place a call while you are outside the United States,
you must have a wireless phone that is designed for use on the network

in the country where you will be traveling. Most countries have some
form of wireless phone service, but the phone that you use in a country
must be compatible with the prevalent technology in that country. For
example, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) is most
commonly used in Europe, and some phones sold in the United States
can work on the European network.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 10.
More Frequently Asked Questions 
Still have some questions left? The answers are in here somewhere.
Can I just keep the phone I have 
and change plans?
We recommend buying a phone at the same time you buy your plan to
be sure that your phone is technologically compatible with your plan.
For example, if you currently have an analog phone, but you switch to a
digital calling plan, your analog phone will be useless.Also, the phone
must be programmed for a speciﬁc wireless provider. So if you switch
wireless providers, your previous phone will not work.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 8.
Can I change my service plan at any time?
If you purchased your current phone in the past year and you want
to switch to a different plan that your current wireless carrier is
offering, you should be able to do that by contacting your wireless
carrier directly.There may be additional fees, depending on the 
wireless carrier.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 8.
Can I keep my phone number if I 
move or switch wireless carriers?
No.When you move or switch wireless carriers you will receive a new
phone number.The exception would be if you keep the same wireless
carrier and move within the same area code—then you may be able to
keep the same number.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 8.

Chapter 12 • Frequently Asked Questions
If I don’t like my phone number, 
can I change it?
Yes. If you do not like your assigned phone number, you can call your
wireless carrier and ask for a new phone number.There may be a fee
charged for this service, depending on the wireless carrier.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 8.
Do I have to sign a contract?
Usually, but not always.Although most wireless carriers have a standard
one-year contract length, there are wireless carriers who still have
month-to-month services available.There may be an additional
monthly charge if you do not sign a one-year contract. On the other
side, there are frequently incentives (promotions and additional services)
if you are willing to sign up for a two-year contract.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 8.
Why do I need a credit card to buy a phone?
If you want the convenience of purchasing online (or by phone), you
will need a credit card because computers don’t take cash. If you don’t
have a credit card but you are over 18 and don’t have bad credit, then
you can usually go to a retail store with two forms of ID and get set up.
For more information on this topic please refer to Chapter 8.
Are rebates for phones instant or mail-in?
It depends on the promotion. Most rebates do need to be mailed in by
a certain date to get the credit or check.Wireless carriers try to distin-
guish between types of rebates by highlighting immediate credit pro-
motions as instant service credits or instant rebates.

Chapter 13 • The Future of Wireless Communications
Introduction
Market analysts estimate the number of mobile phone users worldwide at
just fewer than 500 million, and projections place that number at around
1.25 billion within the next ﬁve years. In the United States alone, the
number of wireless customers is well over 110 million. People are also
starting to dispose of their home phones in favor of wireless phones.
These staggering numbers can mean only one thing: wireless net-
works are destined to rival the traditional phone services that Ma Bell
has been maintaining since before the turn of the century.Annoying
no-signal messages will go the way of the switchboard operator.
Roaming will cease to have anything to do with complex billing issues
and everyone—you, me, that guy who thinks wireless phones are the
downfall of society and culture—will carry a wireless phone.
The remaining hurdles for everyone to forsake their home phones
in favor of wireless are reliability, coverage, features, and cost. Cost is
becoming less and less an issue, as wireless phones and services are
becoming more affordable and comparable to home phones. Coverage
areas for wireless services in residential areas are getting better in both
service areas and quality of service; however, coverage is still an issue for
many individuals in overly remote or rural locations.The reliability of
wireless service is increasing as coverage areas are increasing, and the
features available on wireless phones are rivaling those available on your
home phone.
As Use Increases, Prices Fall
The cost of an average wireless minute continues to drop, bringing it
closer to the cost of an average minute of use from your home phone,
but with the additional features being offered to consumers, the average
monthly wireless bill may soon increase.As these per minute prices get
closer together, more and more people will abandon their home phones
altogether and go purely wireless.Today, according to the Yankee Group,
the leading telecommunications industry analysts, approximately 2 to 4
percent of people polled say they are using only wireless phones.That
number is a 100 percent increase from last year and is expected to con-
tinue to grow exponentially year.
Average monthly wireless bills are approximately $40, but that
number varies greatly between the wireless carriers.Wireless carriers
like Nextel, who promote directly to business users, have the highest
www.getconnected.com

The Future of Wireless Communications • Chapter 13
191
average monthly service fee, around $70.Wireless carriers who have a
high percentage of prepaid wireless users have lower average monthly
service fees, which could run anywhere from $20 to $30.As wireless
carriers start to add more and more minutes to their rate plans, the
average cost per minute of use will continue to fall and the $30 you pay
for your home phone will be an expense you can easily replace with a
$30 monthly service fee for a phone that you can take anywhere.
The average monthly mobile bill has decreased between 7 and 10 per-
cent per year for the past decade, making mobile phones an increasingly
practical investment.As that trend continues, it begs to ask the question,
“Why bother owning two phones at all?” In many instances, owning a
mobile phone has become more economical than owning only a landline.
However, the trend of lower average per-minute costs for wireless
has not escaped notice of the wireless carriers, who are adding new fea-
tures to their wireless services and charging customers extra to use
them, thereby trying to increase the revenue that the wireless carriers
see on a monthly basis. So, if you go totally wireless and want to send
e-mails from your phone you will pay extra for that, which only makes
sense—added features for added cost.
What to Consider before Throwing
Away Your Home Phone
Before becoming the savvy, unencumbered, and entirely mobile indi-
vidual that you aspire to be, consider the following:
I
Clarity Don’t toss out your big button classic until you are
comfortable that wireless service will function normally
throughout your home.Try a call from the bedroom with the
door closed, check your voice mail from the basement, sit in
your closet. Even give it a try from the bathroom.There’s
nothing worse than missing a call while brushing your teeth.
I
Internet Access Despite the busy signal or instant voice
mail that tells friends and family they have been forsaken for
the wonders of the Web, dial-up access is still the cheapest and
simplest game in town. So unless you are ready to lay down a
few bucks for alternate Web access like cable or a Digital
Subscriber Line (DSL), you’re going to be beholden to your
home phone line for a little while longer.There are a number
www.getconnected.com

192
Chapter 13 • The Future of Wireless Communications
of wireless Internet services out there, but they are still rela-
tively slow and expensive.
I
Equipment Many phones using digital networks offer
options like caller ID and voice mail, but they’re not yet as
full-featured as landlines.Also, keep in mind that mobile
phone technology is developing at an intense speed, so it’s
likely that you’ll be upgrading in less than a year (six to seven
months on average according to one telecom analyst) and at a
signiﬁcant cost.
I
Air Time Do you talk a lot? If you’re a phone junkie, it
doesn’t matter if you call local or long distance—you’ll use
most service providers’ free minutes plans in a matter of days.
And that’s when things get expensive.
I
Dead Battery Barring a compulsive urge to save energy at
all costs, you’re going to end up with a dead battery at some
point.
Wireless as the Only
Communications Network
The technology enabling you to dispense of your home phone is only
going to improve. In developing countries with little or no telecommu-
nications infrastructure, the obvious and inexpensive solution is wireless
for all telephone communications.The signal tower has replaced the
telephone pole and airwaves have replaced the wires. It is much less
expensive to build a few towers to cover a large population of people
for wireless phones than it is to put up phone poles and string tele-
phone cables to all houses in very remote areas.
Around the world, the push is on for reliable wireless service, and
the resulting effect of its rapid worldwide establishment is a pent-up
demand for wireless. Some countries create waiting lists for wireless
phones when a network is being built.And the customers are happy to
be on the list—they have been waiting years for a landline phone, so a
couple weeks to wait for a wireless phone is truly remarkable.
If you opt for a satellite phone, there is virtually no place in the
world where you cannot use the phone.The problem with satellite
phones is that they are still very expensive (approximately $1500 for the
phone) and the service is prohibitive for most (a call will cost well over
$1 per minute, sometimes four or ﬁve times that much).These prices are
www.getconnected.com

The Future of Wireless Communications • Chapter 13
193
decreasing, and as with all wireless technology, prices will become more
mainstream if the market place responds with a need for satellite phones.
Combining All Your Devices
Many people carry around multiple electronic devices to stay connected
and stay organized—phone, pager, PDA, MP3 player.The future of wire-
less, is that all these devices can be thrown away and one device can
replace them.Why carry a briefcase to lug around all your digital devices
when you can have a single device that ﬁts in your shirt pocket?
The struggle that is evolving today is one regarding the “form
factor” of the all-in-one devices. Do we want a PDA that works like a
phone and pager, or a phone that acts like a PDA? Do we need a full
keyboard on the device or will we use a regular phone keypad? Should
the device have a microphone built in or should it have an earpiece
that pulls out from the device with a wire to use as the earpiece and
microphone? They jury is currently out, with things like the formerly
voice-less Handspring Visor PDA adding the Visor Phone module to its
compatible product list. One sure sign of the push to get consumer
adoption of these devices can be seen in the rapid price reductions of
the Visor Phone—from $300 (on top of the cost of the Visor, from $200
to $500) to FREE—as long as you activate service with the wireless
carrier. On the phone with a PDA included side, Kyocera has come out
with a phone that has the Palm operating system built in so you can
throw away your Palm Pilot and make calls from their 6035 model
phone.The only problem is the price tag—$400 to $500.
One of the last hurdles to make that all-in-one device a must-have
item is the ability to tie into your information at work. Most companies
use an e-mail program and calendar program that sits behind a secure
ﬁrewall and is next to impossible to access from the outside world with
a wireless device—without getting help from the IT department.And
even if you can access your e-mail, you typically have to handle mul-
tiple e-mail accounts with duplicate e-mails all over the place if you use
your wireless phone to read and reply or otherwise manage your e-
mail.This is getting better with new applications that are being devel-
oped as well as with new technology that the wireless carriers are
starting to add to their networks to help make the whole process more
customer-friendly
So the future of wireless will see these all-in-one devices come
down in price, get smaller in size, and do all the things that your

desktop computer does—without having to work with your IT depart-
ment or completely reconﬁgure your computer.
3G—The Third Generation of Wireless
You may have heard about the next step for wireless phones that is
coming soon—Third Generation Wireless, or 3G. 3G is an umbrella
term covering all the new data services that will be coming soon to your
wireless phone and network.These services include high-speed data for
e-mail and Web content, downloading songs, and even video confer-
encing.Although all this sounds great, it will take a tremendous amount
of effort and money on the wireless carriers’ sides to update their net-
works for the increased amount of bandwidth that will be required to
send these services over the wireless network. Currently, many wireless
carriers are preparing their networks for higher speed and bandwidth
data requirements. Phone manufacturers are creating phones that will
offer these services. In the fall of 2001, NTT DoCoMo in Japan released
the ﬁrst ever 3G phone into the hands of their consumers, including
wireless video capabilities. Is 3G coming to the United States? Yes, but it
will take a while for it to succeed here with all the features that will
drive wireless demand and use (and revenue for the wireless carriers!).
The ﬁrst generation of wireless was pure voice without wires.The
second generation was the ability to send voice and data using digital
signals, which is where the majority of wireless users are today.There
are many phones out there that can access Web sites, send and receive
messages, and listen to music. Some wireless networks are being
upgraded to allow what is being called 2.5G services, higher speed data
than 2G with “always-on” capability, instead of making the user switch
from voice to data when they want to use one or the other. Carriers
are starting to prepare for 3G by moving to 2.5G and phone manufac-
turers are preparing by making phones that can work on today’s 2G and
2.5G networks, and that will be upgradeable to the 3G networks.
The only question remaining for the wireless carriers and the
phone manufacturers is “What will be the 3G capability that everyone
will absolutely need and be willing to pay extra for?”And the jury is
deﬁnitely still out on that question. Maybe those lucky enough to buy
the new 3G phones in Japan (costing approximately $600) will discover
the answer to that question and tell the rest of the wireless world.

Summary
The future of wireless is looking incredibly bright.The ability to use a
wireless phone as your only phone, with the same reliability and clarity
you are used to for your home phone, is coming soon—indeed, it is
already here in some parts of the country. New services are being added
to wireless phones, with more to come all the time, to make your wire-
less phone the only communication device you need for voice, the
Internet, video, music, and more!

As Use Increases, Prices Fall
; The average monthly cost for wireless use is around $40,
but varies from less than $20 for minimal use to over $100
for heavy use.
; Per-minute rates continue to fall with increasingly large
included minutes in rate plans.
; Carriers are looking to extra features like wireless messaging
and e-mail at extra cost to help offset the lower per-minute
prices or even to increase the monthly revenue.
; Only approximately 2 to 4 percent of wireless users use only
wireless and have no home phone.
What to Consider before Throwing 
Away Your Home Phone
; Consider clarity and coverage—make sure you have adequate
wireless service at your house.
; Consider other telephone line needs like Internet access, fax
machines, etc.
; Consider the need for power—make sure you have extra bat-
teries or a charger that allows you to talk and charge at the
same time.

Wireless as the Only Communications Network
; Wiring every home in remote areas of the world is incredibly
expensive and nearly impossible, so wireless networks can ﬁll
the need for developing countries.
; Waiting lists in countries for years is not uncommon for tradi-
tional telephone service, so waiting lists are being created for
wireless phones as soon as the ﬁrst shovel of dirt is taken for a
new antenna for a new wireless network.
; Satellite phones are available and cover virtually the entire
world, but are big, expensive, and mostly for individuals that
must be in touch wherever they are.
Combining All Your Devices
; Wireless phone, pager, Personal Digital Assistant, MP3
Player—it does it all, but do you or will you need it?
; Is the best ﬁt a phone with an added PDA or a PDA with an
added phone? The debate continues.
; Price is still driving the decision for potential users—all-in-one
devices are about $400—$500
3G—The Third Generation of Wireless
; The ﬁrst generation of wireless was voice.
; The second generation of wireless (2G) was voice and data.
; The second-and-a-half generation of wireless (2.5G) consists
of voice, data, Internet content, and higher speed data access.
; The third generation of wireless (3G) is virtually everything
you have with a wired device—voice, data, Internet, high-
speed data, video, music, and so on.
; Japan has 3G today—the rest of the world waits to see what
they think and will join them in 2002 or beyond.

Journey to the Center 
of the Internet
Wouldn’t it be great if you could learn about the
Internet by actually traveling through it the same
way your e-mail does? That’s what Journey to the
Center of the Internet is all about. It’s an effort to
de-mystify technology and allow the average 
noncomputer scientist (which is most of us) to inter-
act with the “stuff” that makes the Internet run; to
experience it in a fun and meaningful way. In this
book, we’ve created a spirit of adventure and dis-
covery as we use our imaginations to chart a
course through the Internet.

Journey to the Center 
of the Internet
Wouldn’t it be great if you could learn about the
Internet by actually traveling through it the same
way your e-mail does? That’s what Journey to the
Center of the Internet is all about. It’s an effort to
de-mystify technology and allow the average 
noncomputer scientist (which is most of us) to
interact with the “stuff” that makes the Internet run;
to experience it in a fun and meaningful way. In
this book, we’ve created a spirit of adventure and
discovery as we use our imaginations to chart a
course through the Internet.
