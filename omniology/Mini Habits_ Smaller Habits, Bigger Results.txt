Preface
I had experimented with personal
development strategies for a decade.
When I accidentally started my first mini
habit—and 
the 
changes 
I
made were actually lasting—I realized
the prior strategies I relied upon were
complete failures. When something
works, that which doesn't work is
exposed. 
The 
science 
in 
Mini
Habits 
exposes 
the 
predictably
inconsistent results of most popular
personal growth strategies, and reveals
why mini habits create remarkable
consistency.
A mini habit is a very small positive

behavior that you force yourself to
do every day; its "too small to fail"
nature 
makes 
it 
weightless,
deceptively powerful, and a superior
habit-building strategy.
This strategy will better equip you to
change your life than 99% of the
people you see walking around on this
globe. People so often think that they are
the reason they can't achieve lasting
change; but the problem isn't with them
—it's 
with 
their
strategy. You can achieve great things
without the guilt, intimidation, and
repeated 
failure 
associated 
with
strategies 
like 
"getting 
motivated,"
resolutions, or even "just doing it.” To

make changes last, you need to stop
fighting against your brain. When you
start playing by your brain's rules—
as mini habits show you how to do—
lasting change isn't so hard.

How This Book Is 
Structured
There are seven major parts in Mini
Habits. The end goal of this book is to
help you permanently add healthy,
habitual behaviors to your life. The
first three parts discuss habit-building,
the brain, willpower, motivation, and
how they relate to one another. The next
two parts discuss logical and scientific
conclusions about how to best utilize
this information. The last three parts
show you how to apply it. Here are the
seven parts in greater detail:
1. Introduction To Mini Habits

Here, you'll find out what a mini habit is.
This part includes the story of how I first
made one push-up a full workout (which
became a mini-phenomenon called “The
One Push-up Challenge”). We'll also
explore why habits are so critical to
actively develop.
What it establishes: what a mini habit is,
the importance of habits, and how I
stumbled upon my first mini habit.
2. How Your Brain Works
In part two, we're going to take a look at
the human brain. Understanding the brain
can help tremendously in new habit
formation, because you can employ
superior strategies with this knowledge.

We'll learn about the active and passive
(i.e. conscious and subconscious) parts
of the brain, and how they work together
to shape our daily behavior.
What it establishes: the inner workings
of the human brain as it relates to
behavior change and creating new
habits.
3. Willpower Vs. Motivation
We have two strategies for taking action
—either get motivated so that we want
to complete the task or force the issue by
using willpower. Is one better than the
other? Do we use both? Science reveals
the winner and suggests the single best
way to apply it.

What it establishes: why it's best to use
willpower 
exclusively 
(with 
mini
habits) and ignore motivation altogether.
4. The Strategy of Mini Habits
The first three parts laid the foundation
for this concept of tiny, daily actions; in
the next two parts, we’ll discuss why
that is the case and how it should work.
Mini habits are most effective with the
proper mindset, and this part gets you
into that mindset.
What it establishes: the connection
between the Mini Habits strategy and
everything we've learned about habit
change to this point.

5. The Mini Habits Difference
This part delves into the advantages of
the Mini Habits strategy’s differences
and how it can work for you when others
haven’t.
What it establishes: all that makes mini
habits uniquely effective.
6. Mini Habits – Eight Steps To Big
Change
These eight steps will show you how to
choose your habits, plan your journey,
and take your first small steps forward.
Each step is broken down into detail,
explaining exactly why it's necessary,
different strategies to employ, and how

to best execute.
What it establishes: how to apply mini
habits to your life, from the “I want to
create a new habit” stage to success.
7. Eight Mini Habit Rules
This last part covers the eight rules of
the Mini Habits strategy. These rules
will keep you on track and ensure you
maximize your potential and results.
What it establishes: the rules of mini
habits that will help you get great results
while avoiding habit-breaking mistakes.

Introduction To Mini 
Habits
“The journey of a thousand 
miles begins with one step.” 
— Lao Tzu 
Let's begin your first mini habit.
Read at least two pages of this book
every day until you finish it. You may

read more than that, but never less. It
won’t require much time or effort to read
two pages, so there are no excuses. Now
you can experience what it's like to have
a mini habit as you read about mini
habits.
Touch your nose right now. I'm serious.
I’ll explain later. Ok, now think about
what the following truths mean for your
life:
1. Big intentions are worthless if they
don't bring results. For example, I can
say that I will exercise for two hours
every day, but if I never do it, the size of
the intention doesn't matter. In fact,
intention without action harms self-

confidence.
2. People have been shown in studies to
chronically overestimate their self-
control ability.1
These two simple points reveal why so
many people struggle to change. They
have big ambitions, but overestimate
their ability to make themselves do what
it takes to change. It's a mismatch
between desire and ability.
Here are two more facts to consider:
1. Doing a little bit is infinitely bigger
and 
better 
than 
doing 
nothing
(mathematically 
and 
practically
speaking).

2. Doing a little bit every day has a
greater impact than doing a lot on one
day. How much greater? Profoundly so,
because a little bit every day is enough
to grow into a lifelong foundational
habit, and those are a big deal, as you'll
see.
If these statements seem reasonable to
you, the main conclusion to draw is that
small intentions are better than big
intentions. Interesting, right? We're just
getting started.
Have you ever felt stuck? Have you ever
tried to change yourself for the better
and failed? Have you done it over and
over again, and even stopped trying for

long periods of time?
We've all been there, I think, but let me
ask you these more interesting questions.
What if your failure to take action and
stick to your plan was never a problem
with you, but a problem with your
strategy—the strategy that most of the
world uses and endorses? And what if
the science about human behavior,
willpower, and the brain suggested a
better alternative for sticking to your
plans—one that is rarely practiced or
promoted? And what if a shift to this
new strategy changed everything for you,
and no matter how you felt, you knew
you could take action, reach your goals,

form good habits, and change your life?
Welcome to the world of mini habits.
It all sounds overblown, I know, but you
just read my mini-autobiography up
there. This is the exact reality and the
revelation that transpired for me starting
in late 2012. The previous ten years of
my life were a constant search and
struggle to grow, with disappointing
results. But then I tried something that
produced a breakthrough unlike I had
ever experienced before, so I scrambled
to understand exactly why this odd
strategy worked so well, and I was (and
am still) amazed at how everything fits
together. And now here's this book.

We're quick to blame ourselves for lack
of progress, but slow to blame our
strategies. Then we repeat them over and
over again, trying to make them work.
But here's the thing—if you fail using a
particular strategy more than a few
times, you need to try another one. It
doesn't matter if it works for everyone
else if it doesn't work for you! This is a
lesson I wish I had learned years ago.
I asked you to touch your nose earlier
because 
I 
wanted 
you 
to 
prove
something to yourself. First, notice that
there's no reward for touching your nose.
Second, consider that you did it anyway
because you can. If you didn't do it then,
do it now so the following words apply

to you (or choose another small action if
you're one of those stubborn types).
You were able to touch your nose
because the resistance you felt was not
stronger 
than 
your 
willpower.
Congratulations! You are now Mini
Habits approved.
That was a rudimentary exercise in
willpower. If you can force yourself to
touch your nose, then you can have
success with this book's strategy. I’m not
joking. This book exists because I did
one push-up on December 28, 2012. My
ability to do 16 pull-ups in a row and my
improved physique result from that same
push-up. I read and write every single

day because of that push-up. That one
push-up was the first step that led to all
of these great changes in my life.
Every great accomplishment rests on the
foundation of what came before it; when
you trace it back, you'll see one small
step that started it all. Without that one
push-up, I'd still be struggling to get
motivated to go to the gym, and to read
and write consistently. That push-up lead
me to discover this new strategy, which
turned into these great benefits. Are you
ready to hear the story of the one small
action that changed everything for me?

How It Began: The One 
Push-up Challenge
I'm thinking about naming it “the golden
push-up.”
It was December 28, 2012 and the new
year was near. Like many others, I
reflected 
on 
2012 
and 
was 
not
impressed. I wanted to live better in
2013; my top desire was fitness. I wasn't
about to set a New Year’s resolution
though—I had decided against them
years ago, because they have an abysmal
8% success rate.2
I felt like I had better odds of winning in
Las Vegas than in life. Ever since my

later years of high school, I had tried to
make exercise a habit. But for ten years
it never stuck, despite my efforts. Those
aren't the types of results that instill
confidence in oneself! My motivational
bursts to change would usually last me
about two weeks before I'd quit for one
reason or another. Sometimes there was
no reason; I'd just stop. Wanting to do
something before the arbitrary January
1st 
starting 
point 
associated 
with
resolutions, I decided to start by
exercising right there on the spot for 30
minutes.
But I stood motionless. I couldn’t get
motivated. I went through my usual “get
motivated” routine. Come on Stephen.

True champions put in the extra work. I
tried listening to up-tempo music,
visualizing myself with a great beach
body, etc. Nothing worked. I felt out of
shape, lethargic, and worthless to the
point that I couldn't do anything. A 30-
minute workout looked like Mount
Everest. The idea of exercise was
wholly unappealing. I felt so defeated,
and I was.
It wasn't just the time or the effort of a
30-minute workout that intimidated me,
it was the total amount of work I needed
to put in to reach my fitness desires. It
was the vast distance between here and
there. A year's worth of workouts
weighed on my mind. I felt guilty,

overwhelmed, and discouraged before I
had even done anything!
The Turning Point
Months earlier, I had read a fantastic
creative thinking and problem-solving
book called Thinkertoys by Michael
Michalko. One of the creative thinking
“toys” he talks about is called False
Faces. In False Faces, you consider the
opposite of what you're currently
thinking, and see what creative ideas
emerge from that. A crude example:
instead of building a skyscraper, what if
you built a structure deep into the earth?
This generates creative ideas by forcing
your mind to zoom out and see the
spectrum of possibilities.

I had a problem to solve, and this
technique popped into my head, so I
thought about the opposite of a 30-
minute workout. Eating ice cream and
watching TV would be one opposite of
exercise. Then I considered that a full 30
minutes just seemed like such a huge
challenge in that moment (i.e. Everest).
Another opposite, I decided, could be
the workout’s size. What if, instead of
this big 30-minute commitment of sweat
and discomfort, I did a single push-up? I
would have no requirement to do more
—just one push-up. It was the true
opposite of my Mount Everest workout.
I laughed off the idea, literally. How
pathetic! One push-up isn't going to

help anything. I really need to put in
more work than that! But every time I
switched back to my first plan, I couldn't
do it. After I got tired of failing to do the
30-minute workout, I thought, Whatever,
I'll do one push-up. I got down on the
ground, did one push-up, and changed
my life for good.
***
When I got into push-up position, I
noticed it was exactly the same as the
start to an actual 30-minute workout. I
did my push-up; my shoulder popped,
my elbows needed WD-40; it felt like
my muscles were waking up from a 24-
year nap. But I did a few more since I

was already in position. Every push-up
was an annoyance to my underused
muscles and stubborn brain.
As I stood up, I concluded that it was
better than nothing. Mind you, I still felt
like quitting at this point. But then I had
the idea to set another small challenge of
one pull-up. It was too easy to turn
down. I got my pull-up bar set up and
did one. Then I did a few more.
Interesting, I thought, this is hard, but
not as hard as I was making it out to
be.
My muscles were warming up. My
motivation to do more had definitely
increased, but it was so low to start with

(and I was so out of shape) that I still
had plenty of internal resistance. I
continued on with the same strategy,
going as small as necessary to continue.
During one push-up session in my
workout, I had to set seven micro goals
like so: ok, one more, ok, two more, now
one more. Every time I baited myself
with a beyond-easy challenge, I met or
exceeded it. It felt nice to hit my targets,
however small.
When I finished, I had exercised for 20
minutes, and felt great about it. Usually
at this point in a workout, I'd complete a
10-minute ab exercise video. But when
the thought crossed my mind, my brain
promptly shot it down like a bird

crossing the screen in the video game
Duck Hunt, saying, “You had your fun,
but don't push your luck.” You can
probably guess what I did next.
I decided to set up my floor mat. Brain
accepted that. Then I decided to find an
ab video. Brain accepted. Then I
decided to press play. 10 minutes later,
my abs were ablaze. It's important to
note 
that 
these 
were 
individual
decisions. At no point did I have the full
weight of completing a 10-minute ab-
ripping program on my mind. If I had, I
would have never done it.
The day after I had turned one push-up
into the impossible-seeming 30-minute

workout, I wrote “The One Push-up
Challenge.” It turned into one of my most
popular posts to date. I still receive
messages from people telling me how
it's helped them to exercise consistently.
As 2013 went on, I continued to require
one push-up per day from myself.
Usually, I did more than one. But one
day I forgot until I was already in bed.
So I flipped over onto my stomach and
did my one push-up in bed. I laughed at
the thought of meeting the daily
requirement at the last second. It sounds
meaningless, but it actually felt amazing
to succeed so easily and keep the streak
alive. Later, I would see how important
this was for my success.

I noticed two things. First, just a few
push-ups a day does make a difference
in how you feel. I felt stronger and my
muscles 
were 
better 
conditioned.
Second, I realized that exercise was
becoming habitual; even with such a
wimpy 
challenge, 
I 
was 
doing
something every day. Regular workouts
were 
becoming 
easier. 
After 
this
positive experience which lasted, I
wondered if a scientific explanation
existed for why “stupid small” steps
work better for me than larger goals.
Research showed that there are indeed
answers, and you'll see them peppered
throughout this book. There's no single
study that says “Mini habits are the

answer.” Instead, this philosophy of
habit-building rests on the shoulders of
dozens of studies that have revealed the
nature of willpower and the brain, and
what it takes to take consistent action.
Starting in late June, I made the jump
from home to gym, and I've built a few
pounds of muscle since then. On
September 20th, I realized the potential
of this formula for other areas of my life,
such as reading and writing. I've amazed
myself since then by increasing my
writing output fourfold and my reading
tenfold, all while staying in great shape.
All of the things I've been wanting are
happening now. I’ve even started eating
mega salads just because I want to do it.

When you invest in yourself in key areas
like fitness and learning, you tend to do
it in other areas too.

For Good Habits Only
Before we get any further, I want you to
understand that this book will not help
you quit smoking or control a gambling
addiction. Mini habits are for good
habits only—adding positive behaviors
to your life to enrich it for years.
Breaking bad habits and making good
habits do have the same goal—replacing
a default behavior with a better
behavior. With bad habits, your primary
motivation for change is an away
response from something bad. With good
habits, your primary motivation for
change is a toward 
response 
to
something good. Mini habits focuses on

the toward response.
Changing deeply-rooted active 
bad
habits like substance addiction involves
a different psychological process and
may require professional assistance.
That said, if you're looking for a long-
term play to help with passive bad
habits such laziness, fear, or wasting
time, then this book can help you
tremendously. Passive bad habits can
often be marginalized by incorporating
good habits into your life. How can you
continue with your bad habits if you
spend all of your time on good ones?
And honestly, adding good habits this
way is pretty easy to do. Quick fixes are
often bogus, but when you've literally

been fighting against your brain for a
decade (or more for some of you), then a
strategy that works with your brain will
be easy in comparison. With the right
knowledge and strategy to change, what
previously seemed impossible becomes
rather straightforward and possible. It's
like trying to open a locked door—it's
only easy if you have the right key (or
are a locksmith or thief, but now the
analogy is too complicated).
That said, those covered in darkness
(probably because of their bad habits)
need light in their life too. If your life is
a complete mess of bad habits, adding in
some good habits can change you.
Darkness is not something that exists on

its own—it's the name we give for the
absence of light. Perhaps people have
bad habits because they lack the light of
good habits, which permits a dark void
in their life. When you add good habits
into your life, it illuminates another
possible path, restores your confidence,
and gives you hope. It also serves as a
brilliant foundation from which to build.
This information doubles as a life
philosophy that demonstrates, explains,
and celebrates that the first step forward
is always the most important one…by
far. In other words, it can help you in
other areas besides your habits. I don't
merely hope that this book will help you,
I'm confident that it will…as confident

as I am that most people’s New Year's
resolutions will fail. That is, it's a high
statistical probability. With mini habits,
you can join the ranks of people who
change 
their 
lives 
in 
the 
most
unbelievable way.

A Brief Synopsis Of Mini 
Habits
Since I refer to mini habits throughout
the book, I want to briefly explain the
concept. A mini habit is basically a
much smaller version of a new habit you
want to form. 100 push-ups daily is
minified into one push-up daily. Writing
3,000 words daily becomes writing 50
words daily. Thinking positively all the
time becomes thinking two positive
thoughts 
per 
day. 
Living 
an
entrepreneurial 
lifestyle 
becomes
thinking of two ideas per day (among
other entrepreneurial things).

The foundation of the Mini Habits
system is in “stupid small” steps. The
concept of small steps is nothing new,
but how and why they work have not
been adequately dissected. Of course,
small steps are relative too; a small step
for you could be a giant leap for me.
Saying “stupid small” clarifies it,
because if a step sounds stupid relative
to the most you can do, it's perfect.
The power of the Mini Habits system is
in the application, mindset, built-in
positive feedback looping, naturally
increasing self-efficacy, and of course,
leveraging small steps into habits. This
will be explained, but it's also built in;
it's a simple system with a complex,

smart backing.
The way we act on these mini habits is
by using a small amount of willpower to
force ourselves to do them. It doesn't
take a lot of willpower to do one push-
up or come up with a couple of ideas.
The benefit from following the Mini
Habits system is surprisingly big results.
First, there's a great chance that you'll do
“bonus reps” after you meet your small
requirement. This is because we already
desire these positive behaviors, and
starting them reduces internal resistance.
The second benefit is the routine. Even if
you don't exceed your small requirement,
the behavior will begin to become a

(mini) habit. From there, do bonus reps
or scale the habit up. Another benefit is
constant success. A bank may be too big
to fail, but mini habits are too small to
fail; and so they lack the common
destructive 
feelings 
of 
guilt 
and
inadequacy that come with goal failure.
This is one of the very few systems that
practically guarantees success every day
thanks to a potent encouragement spiral
and always-attainable targets. Mini
habits have made me feel unstoppable;
prior to starting mini habits, I felt
unstartable.
To summarize, a mini habit is a VERY
small positive behavior that you force
yourself to do every day. Small steps

work every time, and habits are built by
consistency, so the two were meant to be
together. Hey, it’s still a better love story
than Twilight.

About Habits And The 
Brain
Why not just use small steps in daily
life? Well, you absolutely should! But
habits are the framework of your life, so
to ignore them is a pretty big mistake.
When I discovered the power of small
steps from the One Push-up Challenge, I
felt like a superhero who had just
discovered 
his 
superpower 
and
wondered, How can I use this for the
greatest good? Habits were the answer.
This book focuses on using small steps
for habits because there is nothing more
important than your habits. A Duke

University study concluded that about
45% of our behavior is from habit.3
They are even more important than this
45% stake suggests, because habits are
frequently repeated behaviors (often
daily), and this repetition adds up to big
benefits or big damage in the long run.
The habit of writing 1,000 words per
day would result in 365,000 words
written a year. That's equal to seven
50,000-word novels. Though it would
be shy of Leo Tolstoy's 580,000-word
behemoth, War and Peace (that guy sure
had a lot to say).
Consider these classic novels that weigh
in at about 50,000 words each:

• Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's
Guide To The Galaxy (46,333 words)
• Stephen Crane's The Red Badge Of
Courage (50,776 words)
• F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby
(50,061 words)
Now, you may not write a novel of such
world renown on the first try (or the first
100), but if you write seven per year,
you'll have quite a few attempts to
perfect your craft, right?
More potentially life-changing habits:
• The habit of exercising 20 minutes a
day is enough to change your physique.

• The habit of eating healthier foods may
add years to your life (and give you
more vitality throughout).
• The habit of rising one hour earlier
each morning to read would give you
365 extra hours more per year. At the
average reading speed of 300 words
per minute, this extra time would allow
you to read 6,570,000 words, or 131
more 50,000-word books per year.
That's a LOT of books, and a sure way
to increase your knowledge.
There are also less concrete examples
such as thinking positively and being
grateful that can have a dramatic impact
on your life. With mini habits, this

“store” of life perks is now open for
business. Choose your favorite habits
and add them to your cart. For more mini
habit ideas, visit minihabits.com. But
wait, come back here! You've got to
finish the book before you get too
carried 
away. 
There's 
important
information ahead that will help you
succeed.

Merriam-Webster's dictionary defines a
habit as “a usual way of behaving:
something that a person does often in a

regular and repeated way.” Since I tend
to think in terms of resistance and
willpower, I say it’s “a behavior that's
easier to do than not to do.”
Habits are not directly accessible—you
can't immediately create or remove one
right now. They are molded over time by
repetition.
What Do Habits Look Like In The 
Brain?
Neural pathways are communication
channels in the brain, and these
pathways are what habits “look like” in
the physical world.
Here's how it works: once a habit's
assigned neural pathway is triggered by

a thought or external cue, an electrical
charge fires along the pathway in your
brain, and you'll have an urge or thought
to engage in the habitual behavior. For
example, 
if 
you 
take 
a 
shower
immediately after waking up every day,
you'll have a neural pathway associated
with that behavior. You'll wake up, the
“shower neurons” will fire, and you'll
walk to the shower like a zombie—no
thinking required! This is the magic and
the curse of having habits, depending on
if they are good or bad. As a habit
becomes more ingrained, the associated
neural pathway will literally get thicker
and stronger. Yikes!
Knowing this information simplifies and

clarifies our goal. We want to create and
strengthen specific neural pathways with
repetition. It sounds easy when put this
way, but we'll have to overcome innate
human limitations to do it. Many
standard habit strategies you'll find don't
take these proven limitations into
account, underestimate how severe they
are, or make vague and unhelpful
statements like, “It's going to be hard;
you've got to want it.” Without a solid
plan to handle these limitations, you'll
suffer from burnout or inconsistency and
give up early, even if you go in “fired
up.” Can you tell I'm a bit anti-
motivational? That's because it failed me
for ten years, but we'll get to that later.

Habits Are A Matter Of Life And... 
Stress?
While we're discussing the importance
of habits, consider stress.
Today's world runs at a faster pace than
ever before, and we all seem to be more
stressed out as a result. Life is
imperfect, 
and 
it’s 
impossible 
to
navigate it without some stress. The
question that most people never think to
ask is, “How does stress impact my
habits?”
Stress has been shown to increase
habitual behavior—for better or worse!
Two experiments at UCLA and one at
Duke University found that stress

increased people's gravitation toward
habitual behavior. Based on her study in
the Journal of Personality and Social
Psychology, 4 Professor Wendy Wood
argues: “People can’t make decisions
easily when stressed, are low in
willpower or feeling overwhelmed.
When you are too tired to make a
decision, you tend to just repeat what
you usually do.”5 This holds true for
both good and bad habits and is a crucial
insight for their importance in our lives.
Just imagine for a second now what can
happen if your bad habits stress you out.
It's the perfect recipe for a negative
feedback loop. Your stress triggers a bad
habit, which triggers guilt, internal angst,

and more stress, which triggers the habit
again. But now imagine what could
happen if your habits are naturally
stress-relieving, such as exercise. In this
case, your stress will chauffeur you to
the gym, and the exercise will help you
to relieve tension. The difference in
impact on your life is mind-blowing, as
one puts you in a positive position to
succeed despite life's harsh occurrences,
while the other constantly threatens to
drop you into a negative spiral. Being a
football fan, I think of the big swings in
games where one team is about to score
a touchdown from the one-yard line, but
the quarterback throws an interception
that the other team returns for a

touchdown. That's not just seven points
for the other team, it takes away the
probable seven points his team was
going to gain! It's a 14-point swing.
Because of stress, all habits tend to be
“14-point swings.”
The other implication this has for us is in
the difficulty of change. Higher amounts
of stress make it more challenging for us
to change our lives. As Professor Wood
says, “You tend to just repeat what you
usually do.” If stress makes us run to our
habits, then it also makes us run away
from everything else, including that new
positive behavior that we'd like to make
into a habit. You can't see it, but I'm
smiling right now. The standard habit

formula crumbles when we're stressed
because our existing habits get stronger,
but the Mini Habits system won't fail
you here.
How Long Does It Take To Form A 
New Habit?
It depends. Anyone who tells you
differently is repeating what they've
heard (which is wrong).
It is NOT 21 or 30 days. For Pete's and
everyone else's sake, I want to put this
up on every billboard! The 21-day habit
myth was possibly started by Dr.
Maxwell Maltz, a plastic surgeon. Dr.
Maltz reportedly found that amputees
took about 21 days to get used to the loss

of a limb. So he argued that 21 days was
how long it took for people to adjust to
any life changes. Really, Doc? I would
argue that coping with losing a limb and
trying to drink more water are not the
same type of experience. And I'll add
that they're both quite different from
trying to do 150 push-ups a day.
The most-cited viable study on habit
formation duration was published in
2009 in the European Journal Of Social
Psychology.6 Each participant chose an
“eating, drinking or activity behavior to
carry out daily in the same context (for
example 
‘after 
breakfast’) 
for 
12
weeks.” And what did they find?

The average time for a behavior to
become habit was 66 days. But the
range was wild, from 18 to 254 days,
showing that there is huge variation in
people's time to reach habit automaticity,
and that it can end up taking a very long
time in some cases. 21- and 30-day
challenges are popular, but they're highly
unlikely to form many types of habits.
Drinking a glass of water every day
could fall into the 21-day window, but
something more challenging like 100 sit-
ups daily could take a couple hundred
days or more to become habit.
That's the bad news. The good news is
that habits aren't snap on, snap off—if
you do 100 sit-ups for 60 days, day 61

will be much easier for you than day one
was, even if it isn't completely automatic
yet. Building a habit is like riding a bike
up a steep incline that levels out, peaks,
and goes down. To start, you have to
push with all the force your legs can
muster. It gets progressively easier after
that, but you must keep pedaling until
you reach the top of the hill or you'll go
backwards and lose your progress.
In my experience, the first sign of habit
formation is decreased resistance, which
makes 
perfect 
sense. 
Our 
mind
communicates internally by sending
electrical impulses through these neural
pathways, and we know that electricity
always takes the path of least resistance.

Like this concept, our brain prefers to
perform habits because they have
existing pathways and known rewards.
But new behaviors are unproven, risky,
and have no neural pathway. So when
you don't have a solid pathway for this
behavior yet, you have to manually
override the typical behavior. As you do
it more, the “baby neural pathway” will
start to grow, and over time, it will
compete with the previous behavior.
As for the process, it doesn't matter how
long a habit takes you to form because
the goal is to do it forever anyway. Why
would you want to exercise for 6 months
and quit when you reached your goal?
Wouldn't it be disheartening to regress

after that point? What really matters is
recognizing the signs of a behavior
becoming a habit, after which you can
switch your focus to something else and
still maintain the behavior.
One more interesting note from the 2009
study: 
researchers 
concluded 
that
missing a day did not derail a habit,
physiologically speaking; one day didn't
make 
or 
break 
the 
process. 
But
psychologically, missing a day can be a
problem if you let it. It's better not to
miss a day, but keep this fact in mind if
you do—it might stop you from getting
discouraged and losing your progress.

How Your Brain 
Works
“I am a brain, Watson. The 
rest of me is a mere 
appendix.” ― Arthur Conan 
Doyle (Sherlock Holmes, The 
Adventure of the Mazarin 
Stone)

In this chapter, I've taken the liberty of
slicing the brain up into two different
entities—the subconscious brain and the
conscious brain. The brain is far more
complex than that with many parts, but
for our purposes, this is sufficient.
Let this next point seep into the deepest
depths of your mind and lodge there
permanently. Never forget this:
Repetition is the language of the
(subconscious) brain.
(Hint: If you repeat it, you won't forget
it. And there's the first and last brain
joke.)
The goal in creating habits is to change

your brain with repetition. But the brain
will resist changes unless they reward it
handsomely. So really, the two keys to
habit change as far as the brain is
concerned are repetition and reward. It
will be more willing to repeat something
when there is a reward.
Have you ever driven a car without
power steering? You have to turn the
wheel several rotations just to get a
small response from the car. Our brains
respond to change like cars without
power steering. Each iteration results in
a negligible difference, but repeated
consistently, these small alterations can
create a big change in your brain (and
your life).

Your 
subconscious 
brain 
loves
efficiency; this is why we have habits.
When you repeat a behavior over time,
your brain learns to automate the
process. It's more energy efficient to
automatically do something than to
manually weigh your options and decide
to act the same way every time. When
you make a decision very quickly, it is
probably from habit, even if you think
you're actively deciding. In a way, you
made the decision a while ago. Choosing
your favorite ice cream flavor is one
example.

Slow-Changing, Stable 
Brains
The human brain is slow-changing and
stable; it has routines and a framework
that allow it to respond consistently to
the world. Having a slow-changing brain
is frustrating at times, but overall, it's
highly beneficial. Imagine if your
personality and life could transform
overnight—you would go crazy!
Once you successfully develop new
healthy 
habits, 
everything 
becomes
easier. You can get up, eat your healthy
breakfast, and go to the gym every
morning 
automatically 
instead 
of

conducting a drawn-out battle with your
brain. You can do the right things with
little effort. For many, this feels like a
daydream. They only know the dark side
of stability: how the brain compels them
to eat junk food, watch TV, smoke, and
bite their nails. But good habits are as
amazing as bad habits are dreadful.
I know exercise is a habit for me
because my identity has changed with it.
It would feel odd and unsatisfying in a
that’s not me kind of way if I didn’t go
to the gym a few times per week. Last
year, however, my identity was as a
person who did just enough to stay in
average shape. Both scenarios emerge
from habit. Since 45% of our behavior is

automatic regardless of what we do, we
might as well make it beneficial to our
lives and goals. In order to do that
expertly, we need to understand the two
primary players in the brain.

A Stupid Repeater & A 
Smart Manager
Most of your brain is stupid. Well, not
yours specifically—a certain part of
every human brain is stupid, in the sense
that it doesn't consider lung cancer while
you smoke or the perks of great abs
before you exercise. Worse, this is the
strong part of your brain that usually
gets its way long term. It recognizes and
repeats patterns until told otherwise. It's
called the basal ganglia.
There is another section of your brain,
however, that is really smart. It's called
the prefrontal cortex and it's located

behind your forehead. It's the “manager”
that understands long-term benefits and
consequences, and thankfully, it has the
ability to override the basal ganglia. It
handles 
short-term 
thinking 
and
decision-making too.
Just now, we've covered the two critical
tools involved in habit change—the
basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex. I
like the way Psychologist Dr. David
Nowell differentiates the prefrontal
cortex from the rest of the brain. He says
that everything except the prefrontal
cortex determines “what is” and the
prefrontal cortex focuses on “what could
be.”

The only way to create habits is to teach
the rest of your brain to like what the
prefrontal cortex wants. The prefrontal
cortex is what resists chocolate cake (if
at all possible), wants to learn French,
wants to be fit, and would like to write a
book someday. It's the conscious part of
your brain that you'd identify as “you.”
But the problem is that it tires out easily.
Perhaps more accurately, because its
functions are so powerful, it's an energy
hog that tires you out. And when you tire
out (or are stressed, as we covered), the
repetitious part takes over.
The basal ganglia isn't conscious or
aware of higher-level goals that are
unique to humans. But it is an efficient

pattern-repeater that saves us energy. So
while it may not be “intelligent” like the
prefrontal cortex, it is an incredibly
important part of the brain. And once we
train the basal ganglia to do positive
behaviors automatically, we're really
going to love it.
This is the system we all have to work
with. It sounds poorly designed at first,
as the smart prefrontal cortex has less
stamina than the thoughtless, repeating
basal ganglia does, but it's actually
brilliant when you know how to work it.
How 
do 
clever 
weaklings 
ever
overcome 
their 
dumb, 
strong
counterparts? I'll give you a hint—it's
not through brute physical force. I'm sure

you already know that, perhaps because
you are now recalling the failed attempts
of your conscious mind to control your
subconscious mind by brute force or
willpower. The answer, of course, is to
employ smart strategies to overcome
the 
prefrontal 
cortex's 
natural
weaknesses.

The Prefrontal Cortex—
Your Defense Against 
Automated Behavior
In order to understand the prefrontal
cortex better, we're going to look at what
happens when it's gone. How does a
brain operate without one? Not well.
The upcoming study shows what the
prefrontal cortex does, as well as what
the rest of the brain does. When you
remove something, you can see the
impact of what it did and also how the
parts operate without its influence.
Francois 
Lhermitte 
was 
a 
French
neurologist who examined patients with

damaged frontal lobes. What he found in
the following study was evidence that
the brain’s operation changes drastically
without its “manager,” the prefrontal
cortex (which is part of the frontal
lobes). 7
There are two groups of interest in
Lhermitte's study—people with damaged
frontal lobes and people with healthy
frontal lobes. In the experiment, the
subjects would sit across from an
examiner, who asked interview-style
questions. The examiner’s task was to
display indifference to the interviewee,
refuse to respond to their questions, and
occasionally 
perform 
random 
and
puzzling gestures. He'd thumb his nose,

give a military salute, fold paper and put
it into an envelope, chew paper, sing, tap
his leg, whimper, and more. (Ha!
Science is fun[ny]!) Here's what they
found.
Healthy-lobed people, as one would
expect, found his behavior odd. In purely
scientific terms, the response was,
“What's wrong with this dude?” Many of
the younger participants laughed. And
when asked if they thought to imitate
him, they said, “No, not at all.” 8
But here's where it gets very interesting.
Almost all people with frontal lobe
damage did imitate the examiner's
absurd gestures—they imitated him with

great precision and without fail. For
example, the men willingly urinated on a
wall in front of others without any hint of
surprise or concern. When they lacked
the ability to imitate him exactly (such as
not having paper to fold or chew), they
were said to find ways to compensate
“perfectly.” 9
From the study: “When interviewed after
an examination, all [damaged lobe]
patients could remember the examiner’s
gestures and, when questioned as to the
reason for their imitative behavior,
replied that because the examiner had
made the gesture, they felt they had to
imitate him. On being told that they had
not been told to imitate the gestures,

their answer was that obviously since
the gestures had been made, they must be
imitated. After being told not to imitate,
most patients displayed the same IB
(imitation behavior).”10
Those with damaged frontal lobes
couldn't help but imitate the interviewer
(even when asked not to). With damaged
frontal lobes, it appears people lose the
ability to make “override” decisions
over their subconscious mind. The
subconscious is almost like a different
entity, a machine. Also interesting is that
the normal participants forgot some of
the gestures of the examiner, but those
with damaged frontal lobes remembered
every single one. This suggests that the

presence of healthy frontal lobes (which
again, contain the essential prefrontal
cortex) steals some of our focus away
from subconscious pattern recognition
and can inhibit or initiate behavior. This
is why we call it the “manager.” It
oversees automated operations and steps
in when it sees something that could be
done better. Now for the flip side—what
happens when it's the basal ganglia that
isn't functioning properly?

The Basal Ganglia—Your 
Pattern Detector
Your brain's basal ganglia is technically
a group of nuclei that act as a single unit,
and plays a central role in habit
formation and procedural learning.
But research also indicates that the
brain's many systems interact with each
other in complex ways and the basal
ganglia can't necessarily be isolated as
being “the habit part of the brain.”11
Neuroscience, while helpful, cannot
completely explain exactly how the
brain works. That's not to say it's
deceitful or inaccurate, but rather a

small glimpse into a big mystery. The
brain's workings are so intricate and
complex that modern science still has a
lot to learn. That said, knowing the basal
ganglia is the main player in habit
formation is useful. When combined
with experience, experimentation, and
good sense, our limited knowledge of
the brain's workings is a powerful ally
for personal growth.
Lhermitte's 
study 
on 
people 
with
dysfunctional or damaged frontal lobes
showed us the importance of the
executive function of the brain, which
can prevent us from robotically doing
undesirable things. But what happens
when it's the basal ganglia that's

damaged or functioning improperly?
There's a study on that too. It suggests
that a damaged or malfunctioning basal
ganglia causes you to lose your ability to
have any habits.12
Researchers gathered people of three
classifications—healthy 
people,
Parkinson's disease patients, and those
with memory problems. Parkinson’s
disease patients are those whose brains
struggle to deliver the neurotransmitter
dopamine to the basal ganglia due to cell
death. This causes dysfunction of the
basal ganglia.
Participants were given four cards with
random shapes on them, and asked to

predict whether each card meant rain or
sunshine. It would be very difficult to
consciously form relationships between
the cards and results, but there was a
subtle pattern that could be picked up
subconsciously. There were 50 trials,
and after about ten trials, both normal
participants 
and 
memory 
loss
participants gradually improved their
guessing percentage from 50% to 65-
70%; their subconscious mind picked up
the patterns that suggested rain or
sunshine. 
The 
Parkinson's 
disease
participants, however, did not improve
from 50%. Without a healthy basal
ganglia, their brain couldn't detect
patterns (and thus, it would be hard for

them to develop new habits).
From these studies, we can see the brain
is, in vastly oversimplified terms, a two-
part system of executive decision-
making 
and 
pattern-recognition 
for
automated behaviors. The management
functions of the prefrontal cortex can be
dynamic and responsive, but they use up
a lot of energy (and willpower). The
automation functions of the basal ganglia
are effective and efficient. They save us
energy and take care of tasks that don't
need constant monitoring.
This leads into the next important
consideration—how 
do 
we 
get
ourselves to do things consistently with

these two brain components?
Before a behavior becomes habit, the
two ways to get yourself going are
motivation and willpower. Before you
read this next chapter, say your final
goodbyes to motivation, because you're
not going to need it anymore.

Motivation Vs. 
Willpower
 
"Emotions will either serve or 
master, depending on who is 
in charge." — Jim Rohn
I'm about to unleash fury on motivation
as a starting strategy, but motivation and

willpower aren't such “either or”
strategies. They have an important
relationship with each other that the
chart below shows. The basic premise
of this chapter is NOT that motivation is
a bad thing, but that it's an unreliable
strategy for lasting change.
Now, before you interrupt me to ask,
“Hey, where are the mini habits?” give
me a moment to explain. I’ve created a
simple chart on the next page to show the
relationship between willpower and
motivation.

Chart explanation: Motivation 
is the x-axis, and willpower 
cost is the y-axis. When 
motivation is at its peak (lower 
right corner), willpower cost is 
zero or negligible. That's 

because you don't need to 
force yourself to do something 
you already really want to do. 
But when motivation drops to 
zero, strong internal resistance 
means that the willpower 
“cost” is high (upper left 
corner, where willpower cost 
is 100 and motivation is 0). 
More about this relationship will be
discussed in the willpower section, but
all you need to know for now is that
when you're not motivated to do

something, 
the 
“willpower 
cost”
skyrockets. And when willpower cost is
high, it makes it difficult for you to
sustain a behavior over time (and build
it into a habit).
Now, let's take a hard look at “getting
motivated,” which dominates self-help
literature 
despite 
being 
completely
ineffective long term.

The Many Problems With 
“Getting Motivated”
Does getting motivated work? The
answer is a maddening sometimes. At
times, you can conjure up the motivation
to exercise or write 2,000 words, but
other times, you might end up taking a
nap, watching TV, or drinking beer
instead. This is a huge problem
because…
If getting motivated is your strategy,
you can’t build habits.
We know that habits require consistent
repetition. It wasn’t until the 10th trial in
the prior study that participants’ brains

picked up the pattern, and behaviors take
much longer than that to be recognized.
Don't get me wrong here. Motivation is
an important feeling with many benefits.
But think of it as a bonus, something nice
when it appears. I know it’s possible
you currently rely on getting motivated,
so this next section's aim is to convince
you to drop it. I genuinely want you to
disown the concept for your own good,
and here are the reasons why.
Motivation Is Unreliable
Motivation is unreliable because it’s
based on how you feel, and we’ve
known for centuries that human feelings
are fluid and unpredictable. Many things

can alter your feelings: an event, blood
sugar 
levels, 
depression, 
chemical
fluctuations, hormones, health, external
stimuli, energy levels, beliefs, and cat
vomit. In other words, anything can
alter your feelings. Do you really want
to place your hopes on something so...
volatile? The #1 rule of any foundation
is that it must be solid. Motivation is
like building a house on liquid. (Don’t
you dare mention house boats—it ruins
the analogy.)
Everyone has “off” days when energy is
a bit lower. That means your motivation
to do productive things will be lower
too. This strategy makes us resort to
things like motivational videos, articles,

self pep-talks, and other short-term
boosts.
And think about this: with a “get
motivated” strategy, not only do you
have to be motivated to do something,
but you have to be most motivated to do
it. So, to get motivated to exercise, you
would have to want to exercise more
than you want to eat chips and watch TV.
You'll only succeed sometimes.
The activities that are good for us
(eating raw broccoli, running 8 miles,
and then eating more broccoli) are not
the kinds of things that are easy to get
motivated to do. The short-term rewards
of raw broccoli and exercise have a

really hard time competing with ice
cream on the couch while watching a
movie. My motivation to do the latter
stays high.
You Won't Always Want To Get 
Motivated
The motivation theory of growth goes
like this: if I want to do something, I
don't need to force myself to do it (use
willpower)! That's true. When you're
motivated, it's easy to do things, and it
doesn't require much, if any, willpower.
Remember the chart at the beginning of
this 
chapter? 
When 
you’re 
fully
motivated, willpower cost is zero. This
seems like the best way at first, and even
more so when you consider that

willpower 
is 
a 
limited 
resource
(covered later). This makes motivation
highly desirable in theory, but as they
say, “Every rose has its thorns, which
cut your finger and make you curse in
front of your nephew.”
Problem: motivation is not easy (and
sometimes 
nearly 
impossible) 
to
cultivate on demand. Look no further
than your own experiences to verify this.
How easy has it been to motivate
yourself when you're tired, sick, have a
headache, feel “off,” or just really want
to do something else more fun? This idea
of changing what you desire just by
focusing on benefits really discredits the
power and influence of how we feel. It's

hard to change your feelings by
thinking. It's when we have a lot of
energy, a healthy mindset, and no major
temptations that we succeed with
motivation. But when the time comes to
act and the scenario appears far less
favorable, we'll decide to “do it
tomorrow.”
When I was tired and had a headache
recently, there was no motivational
phrase or thought that was going to make
me work on this book. I didn't want to
get motivated either. I wanted to sleep!
Thankfully, I didn't rely on motivation.
There will be times in your life that you
won't be motivated to get motivated.

This means that you… bear with me
here…don’t want to want to want to
exercise. (Yes, that was three “want tos”
in a row!) That gives you a sense of how
far away from taking action you can get
with motivation-based thinking. Instead
of just doing something, you have to
want to do it, but sometimes you have
build up motivation just to want to be
motivated. It’s every bit as crazy as it
sounds. If you don’t want to get
motivated, and getting motivated was
your strategy for doing things, you have
lost the battle before it has begun. And
your habits will die young.
Some People Habitually Think 
Motivation Is The Only Basis For 

Taking Action
As 
getting 
motivated 
has 
been
established 
by 
parroting 
self-help
writers as THE way to get yourself to
take action and improve your life, few
people 
question 
it. 
It's 
standard
procedure. 
Motivational 
websites
abound and thrive as people visit them
for their “motivational fix.” I’ll admit
that getting motivated is a better strategy
than nothing, but nothing isn't hard to
beat.
The desired effect of exercise, as an
example, has three possible causes:
motivation, willpower, or habit. Though
every action is some combination of
motivation and willpower, we tend to

rely more on one or the other. Then there
is that weird hybrid of trying to get
motivated while saying you have to do it
anyway (it usually comes to this when
the battle is lost).
A destructive habit to have is believing
that you have to be motivated to act. It’s
not a problem when you would like to be
motivated, but when you can't do
anything unless you’re motivated. This
is the perfect way to enter a laziness
spiral. Being lazy makes you feel lazy,
and if you always feel lazy and follow
this motivation rule, then you'll continue
to be lazy. There's no way out!
This idea that motivation precedes

action can become deeply ingrained into
a person's psyche. But there's no rule
that says your feelings and actions must
always match. It creates a confining,
frustrating lifestyle.
Motivation Sets Us Up For Failure 
Through The Law Of Decreasing 
Enthusiasm
Ok, let's just say that you're able to get
motivated to read for two hours every
day. And say that you're able to do this
for three weeks straight. At this point,
you'd likely have a very weak habit
beginning to form for this behavior. But
since you've been relying on motivation,
this crucial transition period will likely
mean the end of your progress.

“The law of decreasing enthusiasm” isn't
a real law, but a term I made up because
it 
is 
more 
descriptive 
than 
the
corresponding economic principle: “The
Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility.”
This economic law says you will enjoy
your 5th slice of pizza marginally less
than your 4th slice, and your 4th slice less
than your 3rd. When it comes to behavior
repetition, the same sort of thing
happens.
As a behavior begins its transition into
habit, you will become less emotional
about it. It will even begin to seem
boring and mundane. Count on it. Jeremy
Dean says in his book, Making Habits,
Breaking Habits, that “A habit doesn’t

just fly under the radar cognitively; it
also does so emotionally. [...] The act of
performing 
a 
habit 
is 
curiously
emotionless.” 
13 Dr. Wood and her
colleagues noted this occurrence in a
study they conducted at Texas A&M.
When participants performed a habitual
behavior, they were decidedly less
emotional about it.14 This is why thinking
you need motivation to take action works
against you in habit-building. Repetition
doesn’t make us more excited to do
things, it makes us less excited; the perk
habits offer is less resistance and more
automaticity. Dean says, “The fact that
habitual behavior doesn’t stir up strong
emotions is one of its advantages.”15

That’s true, because anything dependent
on 
human 
emotion 
is 
completely
unreliable.
The 
initial 
excitement 
of 
starting
something is an ally at first, but it
becomes a formidable enemy when it
fades and makes you wonder if
something is wrong. You greatly reduce
this risk, however, by not relying on your
motivation and feelings in the first place.
It's great to be enthusiastic, but let's
assume that mindset as a bonus, rather
than the cue for taking action. It’s better
to do something because you choose to
do it, a solid foundation that does not
fluctuate wildly. Lack of enthusiasm

after some time is counterintuitively a
positive sign that control is moving to
the more stable and automated basal
ganglia.
This predictable enthusiasm decrease is
one reason why you see so many people
drop their exercise plans after January.
Despite their success exercising, they’ll
notice, I’m not feeling motivated
anymore, and stop going. Perhaps if they
understood 
why 
they 
didn’t 
feel
motivated 
anymore, 
they’d 
be
encouraged and continue.
As a main strategy, motivation might be
good enough to get you by in life
(maybe), 
but 
it’s 
a 
poor 
choice

compared 
to 
willpower. 
While
willpower is the best strategy, most
people don’t know how to use it and
drain their willpower reserves quickly.
Despite everything I just said, don’t
worry; you can still enjoy your routines
very much. You’ll always be a human
with feelings and emotions! I'm not
asking you to never feel again. I'm asking
you to never let your feelings stop you
again.

Why Willpower Beats 
Motivation
Now that I've bashed motivation, I'm
going to tell you how to get more of it.
Contradiction? No, the reason I don't
like motivation isn't because it's bad.
For example, I need a baseline level of
motivation to write these words. But
motivation, through no fault of its own,
has been masqueraded about town as the
solution to personal growth. It's like if I
told you carrots cured cancer. Carrots
are good for you, but they won't likely
cure anyone of cancer. So now this good
thing (carrot) has been made into an
enemy of the truth and is deceiving

people. In this way, motivation is an evil
carrot.
The Mini Habits willpower strategy is
very conducive to motivation, which
again, is good, but unreliable. I've found
that by using willpower, motivation
becomes 
more 
reliable; 
motivation
comes fast when you take action first.
There are three reasons why forcing
yourself to take action with willpower is
far better than trying to get motivated.
Willpower is Reliable
Unlike 
motivation-based 
techniques,
willpower is extremely reliable. If you
force yourself to do something no matter
what, that's dependable. Of course, that's

only if you can force yourself to do it.
And it just so happens that these next
two advantages of willpower make it
even more reliable.
Willpower Can Be Strengthened
Unlike motivation, willpower can be
strengthened like a muscle. Leading self-
control 
researcher 
Professor 
Roy
Baumeister found in 1999 that students
who had exercised their willpower to
improve their posture for two weeks,
“showed a marked improvement on
subsequent measures of self-control”
compared to those who hadn’t worked
on their posture. 16 Another study found
that a two-month aerobic exercise
program resulted in improvements in

other unrelated self-control activities. 17
This is self-improvement gold. These
studies suggest we can strengthen our
very ability to improve ourselves!
But if something neither works the first
time nor any time after, then you're
spinning your wheels by continually
trying. Motivation works sometimes, so
it’s tricky to evaluate. But if you look at
your long-term results using motivation,
you might see that it isn’t working
consistently. 
Motivation 
is 
not
something that’s easy to improve either
because when your dog dies, your mood
will darken; when you're tired or in a
bad 
mood, 
you 
won't 
feel 
like

exercising. You can, however, improve
your ability to take action despite feeling
resistance due to emotional trauma, lack
of confidence, bad moods, or low energy
levels. This is willpower.
Willpower Strategies Can Be 
Scheduled
If you rely on motivation, you will have
a difficult time sticking to a schedule.
When it's time to write, who knows if
you'll 
be 
motivated 
or 
not? 
It's
unpredictable and not calendar-friendly.
Using willpower, though, you can
schedule an activity and do it whether
you are motivated at the time or not. This
allows for consistency, which is both

habit- and calendar-friendly. Habits
aren't made from a general plan to write
when you can or exercise when the stars
align. You've got to put the task on your
calendar and do it, and that requires
willpower.
The big question remains—how can we
maintain 
consistent 
success 
using
willpower? To answer this question,
let's summarize what science tells us
about willpower and take it from there.

How Willpower Works
It used to be believed that willpower
was 
an 
unlimited 
resource 
of,
well...will. The idea was that if you
wanted something enough, you would
always have enough willpower to make
yourself get it. That idea changed when
Baumeister conducted a somewhat cruel
study in 1996. 18 It started with 67
people in a room, which was promptly
saturated with the tempting smell of
freshly baked chocolate chip cookies.
Then they brought the cookies and other
chocolate treats into the room. Here is
the cruel twist—only some of the
participants were given chocolate treats

to eat. Others, God help them, were
given radishes to snack on instead! Even
as a person who loves snacking on raw
radishes, I feel their pain.
Scientists from the study humorously
noted that quite a few of the radish
eaters appeared to “exhibit clear interest
in the chocolates, to the point of looking
longingly at the chocolate display and in
a few cases even picking up the cookies
to sniff at them.” (Ibid., 255) As I said,
cruel.
After 
this, 
chocolate 
and 
radish
participants alike were given a puzzle to
solve. Those who ate radishes spent less
than half the time attempting the puzzle

as those who had consumed chocolate,
and they attempted to solve it fewer
times before giving up. It appears that
having to eat radishes instead of cookies
drained their will to continue struggling
with the puzzle. Baumeister named this
phenomenon “ego depletion.” There
have since been dozens of studies
verifying 
the 
results 
from 
this
groundbreaking study.
Decisions Drain Willpower Too!
Don’t just blame the radishes. A self-
control study found people who made a
difficult decision earlier in the day were
more likely to cave in to a temptation
later, showing a decrease in self-
control.19 It seems that big decisions

share the same pool of energy as our
willpower. I imagine that anything that
uses the prefrontal cortex could have this
effect, because the prefrontal cortex
handles short-term memory and current
thinking. But you wouldn't typically think
that making a tough decision could
adversely affect your ability to resist ice
cream or force yourself to exercise later
in the day.
This means one thing—we've got to
maximize our self-control reserves to be
effective at changing ourselves. I include
this just to show how other things can
undercut 
our 
willpower 
reserves,
making the philosophy behind mini
habits even more important.

An Important Meta-Analysis Of 
Willpower
A meta-analysis is a “study of studies”
that 
attempts 
to 
extract 
important
conclusions from the body of related
work on a given topic. This helps to
smooth out possible aberrations from
individual studies. If something holds
true over dozens of properly conducted
studies and thousands of participants,
there's a very high probability of that
data being reliable, illuminating, and
useful.
In 2010, a meta-analysis of 83 studies
was done on ego depletion. 20 Ego
depletion essentially means the same
thing as willpower or self-control

depletion, so I will use these terms
interchangeably. 
From 
this 
meta-
analysis, the five biggest factors found to
cause 
ego 
depletion 
were 
effort,
perceived difficulty, negative affect,
subjective fatigue, and blood glucose
levels. These factors, then, are the five
biggest obstacles that keep us from
sustaining success with a willpower-
based strategy. What do we do once
we've exhausted our willpower? Is all
hope lost then? According to the
analysis, 
motivational 
incentives,
training on self-control tasks, and
glucose supplementation promoted better
self-control of ego-depleted people.
(Ibid.)

This gives us a wealth of information
about how best to manage willpower.
Here is an important motivation and
willpower recap to set up this next part
about the Mini Habits strategy for
adding healthy habits to your life:
• New (or non-habit) behaviors are
started 
by 
using 
motivation 
or
willpower.
• Motivation isn't reliable, so it can't be
the strategy for building habits.
• Willpower is reliable, but only if you
don't run out of it.
• There are five main causes of
willpower depletion: effort, perceived

difficulty, negative affect, subjective
fatigue, and blood glucose levels.
• If we can successfully overcome these
five hurdles, we should find success.
In the next chapter, we'll discuss how
mini habits fit everything we've covered
so far, starting with these five main
causes of willpower depletion.

 The Strategy Of Mini 
Habits
“It's not what we do once in a 
while that shapes our lives. 
It's what we do consistently.” 
― Anthony Robbins
The Mini Habits strategy is forcing
yourself to take 1-4 “stupid small”

strategic actions every day. These
actions are too small to fail, and too
small to skip for special occasions. They
serve dual purposes—to spark you to do
more, and to become (mini) habits.
Now we’ll look at how the Mini Habits
strategy generally applies the principles
we’ve learned thus far. The specific
step-by-step instructions of the Mini
Habits strategy come two chapters after
this one.

Using Willpower The Mini 
Habits Way
There was a study on ego depletion that
found 
some 
correlation 
between
believing willpower is limited and
willpower becoming limited.21 Those
who didn't believe their willpower had
a limit appeared to last longer in ego
depletion activities. At first, this appears
to be a strike against having mini habits,
because they’re designed around the
assumption that willpower is limited (as
shown in the meta-analysis). But let me
explain why mini habits are a failsafe
against either scenario.

If willpower is truly limited, then mini
habits preserve it by starting small. But
say that willpower is only limited by our
belief that it's limited. What would that
mean for mini habits? It's great news!
You’ll believe you have unlimited
willpower with mini habits because they
require almost no willpower. So in the
case that you're bursting at the seams
with willpower energy, mini habits will
get you started and allow you to make
great bonus progress. And in the case
that you're completely exhausted and out
of willpower, mini habits will get you
started anyway and allow you to make
the most of your capabilities at the time.
The belief that you can take action no

matter what is built into this theory, and
it has not failed me a single time. Not
once has my willpower been insufficient
to complete a mini habit.
Now, I want to highlight again the five
main causes of ego-depletion found from
the 83-study meta-analysis mentioned
earlier. The biggest five ego depletion
drains were found to be (in no particular
order):
• Effort
• Perceived difficulty
• Negative affect
• Subjective fatigue

• Blood glucose levels
Let's examine how all five of these
willpower 
threats 
are 
mostly 
or
completely nullified by mini habits.
Effort
Mini habits require very little actual
effort. You're going to be doing one
push-up, writing 50 words, reading two
pages, or other very easy tasks. The
subsequent 
bonus 
effort 
from
overachieving is variable, meaning some
days will be more productive than
others. This is a natural structure that
greatly reduces the chance for burnout.
I've often planned to write 50 words and
written 2,000 words. Other times, I've

written closer to 50 just to meet the
requirement.
The Mini Habits system is both rigid
and flexible in strategic places. It's rigid
in the beginning, forcing you to start, but
it's flexible after that, allowing you to
decide how much extra you want to do.
The initial effort requires hardly any
willpower.
Result with mini habits: very little ego
depletion.
Perceived Difficulty
Mini habits have almost zero perceived
difficulty by design, a primary benefit
that compounds when you do extra.
Remember when I talked about the big

“mountain” that my 30-minute workout
was to me? That workout had a very
high perceived difficulty—my sense of
the difficulty was greater than the actual
difficulty. But when I decided to start
with one push-up and continued in that
fashion, the perceived difficulty dropped
substantially. Setting mini goals is the
best way to drop the perceived difficulty
in any project.
Once you start and are free to continue,
your perceived difficulty will be much
lower due to the psychological impact of
having already started. Just like in
physics, the greatest inertia comes
before the start of motion. Once you're in
motion, everything gets easier as a result

of 
momentum 
(and 
increased
motivation).
Starting, even in a small way, also
brings your mind into reality, and this is
important. Before you take action, your
mind can only imagine what a particular
behavior would be like. My initial
projection of a 30-minute workout was
like scaling Mount Everest. It was
wrong. When it comes to activities that
require physical or mental effort, it's
extremely common to overestimate how
difficult they are. After I completed my
30-minute workout from force-starting
with one push-up, I realized how absurd
my initial perceived difficulty was.

Result with mini habits: very little ego
depletion (even as you continue beyond
your original target). The reason starting
is the hardest part is because it carries
the 
brunt 
of 
the 
weight 
of 
the
commitment. Once we start, we feel as if
we need to finish our original intention
to count it as a success. This is why we
tend not to start a project that intimidates
us. We’d rather not start if we won’t
finish. This is why mini habits are so
easy. The total intention is so small,
there's no risk of quitting too early. By
starting small and entering the reality of
doing the work, your mind will see that
one small step is not as difficult as it
first seemed, and that taking the next step

isn’t difficult either.
Negative Affect
Negative affect simply means the
experience of unpleasant feelings; it
clearly played a role in the chocolate
and radish study. Participants were
tempted by the sight and smell of
chocolate and were given the less
desirable radishes. Being tempted with
chocolate only to be denied even a taste
was a very negative experience, perhaps
more than we'd think (imagine someone
presenting you with cookies and then
withholding them. Ack!). As mini habits
are for adding good things, negative
affect is less relevant unless your action
is directly replacing another pleasure.

Eating radishes alone won't deplete
willpower, for example, but when
juxtaposed against chocolatey goodness,
you bet they will!
Result with mini habits: typically no
ego depletion. Even if you're replacing a
pleasure 
with 
a 
mini 
habit, 
the
commitment is so small that you won’t
feel negative affect from it. More often,
you’ll 
be 
replacing 
time-wasting
behaviors with beneficial ones, which
induces a positive feeling.
Subjective Fatigue 
This is an interesting one, isn't it? It
doesn't say fatigue; it says subjective
fatigue, 
implying 
that 
we're 
not

completely objective in our assessment
of our own fatigue. It turns out that
willpower is a battle of the mind, and
according 
to 
some 
of 
these 
top
willpower drainers, the battle appears to
be between the perception of your
strength relative to your task.
Mini habits thankfully come with a mini
amount of subjective fatigue. Subjective
fatigue depends on many factors, and a
big one is how you see yourself stacking
up against your goal. I've noticed that
when my goal is large, my subjective
fatigue worsens. This is logical, as the
mind “looks ahead” to the upcoming
work and perhaps feels the impact early.
A 
recent 
study 
found 
that 
our

imaginations are so powerful that they
can change what we physically see and
hear in the real world,22 so it is not at all
a stretch to think that expecting a heavy
workload can impact our energy levels
too. This idea was also supported by
researchers in the meta-analysis, who
noted, “expecting further acts of self-
control exacerbated the effect [of ego
depletion].”23 I noticed that when my
goal became j ust one push-up, my
subjective fatigue shrunk. In fact, I felt I
had plenty of energy to do a single push-
up, and the thought that I could easily do
something, albeit small, was energizing.
Result with mini habits: Nothing can
completely take away subjective fatigue,

but mini habits mitigate it very well. In
relation to your mini goals, you may feel
a sense of empowerment and energy.
Even 
when 
I've 
been 
exhausted
(subjectively), I've still felt sufficiently
energized to just read two pages or write
50 words. If you're wondering about the
value in “only doing that much,” it's high
and it’s covered later.
Blood Glucose Levels
Glucose (sugar) is your primary energy
source. If you have low glucose in your
blood, you're going to feel very tired. If
it's dangerously low, you can even pass
out. Your blood sugar levels are
determined 
by 
genetics, 
diet, 
and
lifestyle.

As for mini habits, they are independent
of your blood sugar, but they can help to
preserve it by being the most efficient
way to spend your willpower energy. It
is far more mentally energy efficient to
break 
things 
down 
into 
small
components that are easily “mentally
digested” and less stressful. The goal of
losing 100 pounds in a year is a constant
energy drain and burden. And with this
goal, it's possible to lose 50 pounds and
feel like a failure. Why would anyone be
interested in that?! One workout feels
like a drop in the bucket, and it is in the
grand scheme of your massive goal. It's
hard to feel good after a workout when it
represents almost nothing compared to

your goal. With mini habits, though,
willpower is preserved as much as
possible, every step you take feels like
success, and going beyond your goal
feels even better than that. It’s a system
that makes you feel like a winner,
because people who feel like winners
act like winners.
Result with mini habits: While blood
sugar levels are independent of mini
habits, the fact that they are energy-
efficient, 
willpower-efficient, 
and
empowering psychologically, preserves
blood sugar as much as any goal/habit
strategy could. And if you're tired from
low blood sugar, mini habits give you
the best chance to take action anyway.

How Mini Habits Expand 
Your Comfort Zone
Right now you have a comfort zone.
Imagine it as a circle. You're most
comfortable inside of this circle, but
outside of it are some of your desired
goals. Outside the lines, you might see
yourself physically fit and weighing less;
you might envision books you've written
or books you'd like to read; a happier
version of you with fewer negative
thoughts; a version of you who cooks
more meals at home; or whatever else
you're interested in improving. These are
outside of your comfort circle because
they require some discomfort to achieve

(due to straying from your basal
ganglia's current routines).
The common way people go about this
change is diving in and trying a
“whatever it takes to succeed” strategy.
This is like sprinting well outside of
your comfort circle and fighting to stay
there. That's when your subconscious
brain says, this is interesting, but I'm
really uncomfortable with this huge
change, and it forces you back inside
your 
comfort 
circle 
when 
your
motivation and willpower can no longer
support you out there.
Mini habits are like walking to the outer
edge of your circle and taking one step

outside of the boundaries. You're in less
comfortable territory here, but not by
much, because you know taking one step
back will put you back inside your
comfort circle. And maybe for the first
few times, you will step right back
inside your comfort circle (only meeting
your mini requirement). But when you
continue to step outside the circle, your
subconscious will get comfortable with
it and your circle will expand (we’re
talking about a mini habit forming here).
This expansion, unlike the sprints in the
prior example, can permanently change
your boundaries, and it is the magic
bullet of mini habits. Because while I
hope you get the urge to explore your

outer boundaries after you take that first
step outside, even if you don't, you will
eventually form a comfortable habit of
taking that first step into a new behavior.
This serves as the best possible
foundation for further steps and
personal growth in that area.
In the case of push-ups, the common mini
habit is to do one every day. This small
step creates a much broader effect than
you'd think, because not only will you
become comfortable with the idea of
doing one push-up, you'll also be more
comfortable with push-ups in general
and with doing them every day. This is
going to make scaling up a breeze.
Really. And this is the absolute worst

case scenario of the Mini Habits system
(in that you never do extra).
Chances are that you will do extra
sometimes. And the reason relates to
basic physics. Newton's first law states
that...
1. An object that is at rest will stay at
rest unless an external force acts upon it.
2. An object that is in motion will not
change its velocity unless an external
force acts upon it.
Can you see how this relates? Once you
take that first step, you are officially in
motion. You will find as I have, and as
Newton's law suggests (for physics

anyway), that once you get started it is
almost as hard to stop as it is to keep
going. Add to this that nothing is more
motivating and inspiring than seeing
yourself take action. Put it together and
we get a new equation:
One small step + desired behavior =
high probability of further steps

The Two Moments Of 
Resistance
I remember living in Virginia with a cat.
When it snowed, we naturally wanted to
see how our indoor cat liked the snow.
Cats don't like water, but do they like
fluffy, frozen water? Nope.
First attempt: We walked out into the
yard and tossed her into the snow.
Failure. 
She 
would 
stand 
there
motionless and confused for three
seconds, and quickly race back inside in
disapproval.
Second attempt (later day): We placed
her on the outskirts of the snow. Success!

She actually walked around in it and
explored some.
Your brain is just another cat in the
snow, and you can quote me on that
because I love out of context quotes.
Spring massive changes on it and it will
run back to its comfortable routines. But
introduce changes gently and in small
doses, and it just might be curious (not
scared) to explore them more.
Your brain is programmed to resist
change, but most of that resistance comes
at two particular moments.
Resistance Before Action
Think of yourself as a ball resting on a
track, or as Newton's law states, “an

object that is at rest.” Motivational
techniques insist that you get motivated
before you move, but isn't it easier just
to move forward one centimeter and let
momentum help you out? Yes, yes, it's
much easier! Move yourself slightly
forward to get rolling. Once you're
rolling, the equation changes to a more
favorable physics formula: “an object
that is in motion will not change its
velocity unless an external force acts
upon it.”
We want to be in motion in the direction
of our goals as much and as frequently as
possible. To do this, we need the first
action to be really easy, because that is
the first wall of resistance in any task.

Starting is the hardest part, but that
doesn't mean it has to be hard to start.
“Hardest” is relative.
When the first action is just a nudge,
initial resistance shrinks. Once you take
action, there is a second wave of
resistance. The strength of this second
“wave” depends on how much of an
impact your first step had (which
varies).
Resistance To Do More
The Mini Habits strategy addresses the
first instance of internal resistance by
requiring small steps to start and by
making the total requirement too easy to
fail. 
It 
keeps 
you 
from 
getting

overwhelmed and racing back to your
old routines (like a cat in the snow).
But once you start, there's another wave
of resistance. In my experience, taking
that first step often completely shatters
this 
second 
level 
of 
resistance,
especially once you have had some
practice. But starting out, it was FAR
less frequent. Can you guess why? Think
about the brain.
This resistance isn't a mystery. It's a
subconscious conflict with my typical
behavior. The basal ganglia can be
fooled into not resisting the first step, but
it still knows what it wants when you
attempt to do more. So, when the first

step isn't enough to break the resistance,
you can take another. The basal ganglia
doesn't care to “defend” against small
steps, only drastic changes. By changing
slowly and taking it one step at a time,
you're playing by your own brain's rules.
So when I kept setting mini goals in the
one 
push-up 
challenge, 
my 
brain
tolerated it. But once I thought about
doing even a 10-minute chunk, my brain
said, “No, absolutely not. Play video
games, young man. You're grounded.” So
I said, “But can I just get the exercise
mat out?” and it said “Yes.” You know
the rest.
If you're ever in a situation where you'd

like to do more than your minimum
requirement, simply continue to use
small steps (if necessary). But do not
come to expect this every time. Your
requirement is small for all of the
reasons we're discussing! You don't
want to jeopardize your long-term
success for a short-term gain. I don't
want to scare you into doing too little
either, so I'll just say this: if your
requirement is small on paper and in
your mind, you're fine.
Now, let's take a closer look at how mini
habits work in the moment.

Mini Habits In The Moment
We just talked about the two occasions
that we meet resistance (before and
during a task or project). Now I want to
discuss 
both 
common 
forms 
of
resistance—mental and physical.
Motivation can't overcome resistance
consistently. It is the sometimes solution.
The slogan for motivation should be the
quote from the movie Anchorman: 60%
of the time, it works every time.
It isn't just motivation though—using
willpower 
recklessly 
is 
equally
ineffective. 
Smart 
willpower
management 
is 
key 
to 
personal

development 
as 
smart 
money
management is key to financial success.
People working normal, relatively low-
paying jobs have becomes millionaires
through smart money management while
super athletes making millions of dollars
every year have gone bankrupt. If you
don't plan your action strategy out, you'll
flip-flop between poor willpower and
motivation 
strategies, 
and 
end 
up
frustrated.
Here's how mini habits overcome mental
and physical barriers. I'll use exercise as
the example, since it is such a common
desire.
Scenario #1: You have energy to

exercise, but don't want to do it
(mental barrier).
Since we're going to skip motivation,
we're left with using willpower. But
instead of saying you have to do a full
workout, we'll just say that you HAVE to
do one push-up. It's required. As you
have energy in this scenario, this isn't a
big deal. And once you start, you're
going to find the motivation kick in most
of the time.
You don't want to exercise right now in
this scenario, but you do want to
exercise generally in life. These are
conflicting desires between present
moment feelings and your life values.

When you do that first push-up, your life
values will often inspire you and
overtake your prior hesitation. If not, you
may have to set a few more micro-goals
like I did in the first One Push-up
Challenge, but as you lead yourself
along, your mind will adjust to what the
body is doing. And each small step you
take will make your long-term healthy
perspective more appealing.
In the willpower section, we saw how
willpower depends greatly on the
perception of the difficulty of the task,
and when you start “stupid small,” the
perceived difficulty and willpower cost
drop drastically. Once you take the first
step, your brain is forced to calculate the

true difficulty of what a full workout
would be like, instead of a biased, lazy
brain projecting it to be torturous! If
you've ever found yourself thinking it
wasn't so bad after a workout or trying a
new experience, you're already familiar
with this phenomenon.
Now what if you go overboard with
willpower even after starting small, and
burn yourself out? This is the situation
that life coaches are terrified of... what
if you simply don't have the energy to do
it? What if you have a headache? While
I'm not promising this as a panacea for
all action-stopping ailments, I do
believe it is the single best action-based
strategy—if anything can work, it's this.

Scenario #2: You don't physically feel
like exercising because you're tired
(physical barrier).
We think of tiredness as a physical
barrier, but it's also a mental barrier.
Having no energy usually means you
have zero motivation. I've overcome this
exact scenario countless times with mini
habits. For example, more than 1,000
words of this book were written while I
had a headache. Not just that, but I was
tired and wanted to go to sleep. I was
completely unmotivated to write, had
very little energy, and I did my 50 words
anyway 
(which 
grew 
into 
1,000
somehow).

In many ways, it's harder not to do a
single push-up than to do one. The
challenge is so easy that your pride
enters the equation: I may be stubborn
and exhausted right now, but come on, I
can do that. I encourage you to
frequently 
remind 
yourself 
of 
the
absurdity of not being able to meet your
mini habit requirement(s).
I was productive with a headache
because I started small. It seemed
literally impossible at first based on
how I felt. And in the past, there was no
way I would even attempt to write in
those circumstances with such a great
excuse. I would have cut my losses and
gave the standard promise to myself to

do it later. (As I age, I realize that now
is yesterday's later, and that later is a
bad plan.) It was the perfect storm
though—headache, late at night, and
dead tired. I swear my bed was giving
me pick-up lines.
“Your REM cycle is beautiful, Stephen,”
it said. My glazed eyes gazed lustfully at
the warm covers, and I replied, “In a
minute, honey.”
My requirement was so easy that I
decided to take a minute to meet it and
then quit. Instead, I wrote 1,000 words; I
was astonished. It was one of those
moments when I realized how powerful
this life strategy is.

Can you see how mini habits can make
you feel unstoppable? Can you see why
I'm confident that mini habits can help
nearly anyone add good habits? If I can
perform in those circumstances—when I
have 
weak 
willpower—then 
this
strategy is a good one. The basis of this
strategy 
rests 
not 
on 
my 
unique
experience, but on the science of
willpower. My experience coincides
with the science. Mini habits are
designed 
for 
minimum 
willpower
exertion and maximum momentum—the
perfect scenario.
Fitting Mini Habits Into Your Life
Are you busy? Do you frequently feel
overwhelmed with everything you want

and must do? A concern you should have
with any system is how it fits into your
life. 
Many 
habit 
books 
(wisely)
recommend that you only pursue one
habit at a time. This is due to our limited
willpower being unable to handle too
many habits at once. But who wants to
dedicate six months to one area of their
life and ignore the other things they want
to improve? Habits are so valuable that
it would be worth it, but it's frustrating
to only focus on writing when you want
to get in great shape too. This tension
between your current focus and the other
areas you want to improve can derail
you. This is a huge, largely ignored
problem that has been without a

solution... until now.
Mini habits are so small and willpower-
efficient, that you can have multiple
habits 
at 
once. 
Even 
busy 
and
overwhelmed people can succeed with
multiple mini habits. Look at mini habits
as your day's foundation—these are
things you MUST get done, but they only
take a few minutes total to do. After that,
you can do anything you want, whether
it's “bonus reps” or other activities. It's
completely flexible to fit your current
lifestyle, but it's the crowbar of personal
development, because it can leverage an
initially small habit in your life into
something much bigger.

The Mini Habits 
Difference
“Victorious warriors win first 
and then go to war, while 
defeated warriors go to war 
first and then seek to win.”  
― Sun Tzu, The Art of War
What makes Mini Habits different from

every other system out there claiming to
change your life? How can this system
improve habit development and personal
growth over traditional methods? These
are fair questions to ask, so here are the
answers.

Mini Habits Can Compete 
With Your Existing Habits
Studies on people attempting to change
existing habits have found discouraging
results.24 It turns out that once a habit
gets strong enough, even the strongest
intentions have a tough time turning it
around. In the context of a day, you'll do
many more habitual behaviors than it
seems, and these habits can interfere
with your attempts to add in a new
healthy habit.
Where Mini Habits trounces other habit
programs is in competitiveness. When
you attempt to introduce a new behavior,

it's like trying to enter a weight-lifting
competition without training. There is a
ton of competition there already, and
even worse, the competition is proven,
experienced, and stronger than you. Most
habit programs go wrong here. They
convince you that you can compete head-
to-head with these stronger habits right
away. (Sorry, I've got $400 riding on
smoking and watching TV.) They tell you
to introduce a huge change like going
from not writing much at all to 2,000
words per day, or being on the couch to
exercising for an hour every day. The
problem with this is the cost in
willpower. It's a math equation that
doesn't work out in your favor, unless

you already have a strong self-discipline
muscle. If not, you'll suffer "burn out"
(and I'll win $400).
The brain resists big changes. Have you
ever heard of people saying that you just
need to get your foot in the door for
employment opportunities? Mini habits
are that same concept, but instead of
getting into a company, we're talking
about your brain. I think of the prefrontal
cortex as having a spending allowance
before the automatic part takes over. For
every task, the subconscious brain looks
at what you're asking of it and charges
you willpower to get into the control
room. You're only allowed to ask for so
much manual control per day, but once

you're in, you're in. Mini habits are low-
willpower Trojan horses that can
leverage their easy access into the
brain’s control room into big results. I
noticed this when I did that first push-up.
It was the same physical action for how I
started every workout, but I didn't feel
the burden of a workout because I didn't
ask my brain for the whole thing.

Small Steps & Willpower 
Are A Winning Team
The 
perfect 
team 
in 
personal
development 
is 
small 
steps 
and
willpower. As long as you have enough
willpower for an action, you can take
that action. Small steps require little to
no willpower. So it's like having
unlimited willpower. You can get
yourself to do just about anything if you
guide yourself along in super small
steps. Try it.
If you resist walking up to a girl to ask
her out, decide to move your left foot
forward, and then your right foot, in her

direction. You'll get there, and she'll ask
you why you were “walking so funny.”
ICEBREAKER.
Live update example: After 3 hours of
basketball today, I was exhausted. My
brain and body told me there was no
way I could write. I was falling asleep. I
had no willpower. But I aimed for 50
words, which was too small to resist,
and once again I'm well beyond my
target now (and awake). Many times
when you're tired, engaging your mind or
body will wake you up.

Other Methods Will Tell 
You It's Ok To Let Up Too 
Soon
The common myth is that you can
establish a habit in 21 or 30 days. Some
books are wholly based around this false
concept. The truth is a bit uglier and
harder to predict—18 to 254 days until
habit formation, depending on the habit
and the person.
Mini habits don't have a specific end
date, because we don't know how long it
will take to form the habit. Instead, we'll
look for signs that the behavior is habit.
If your experience is like mine, you

could end up developing a bigger habit
than you planned. My mini habit of
writing 50 words a day has resulted in
writing more like 2,000 words per day
(though not every day).

Mini Habits Increase Your 
Self-efficacy
Self-efficacy isn't a term you hear much
unless you read behavioral science
studies. Self-efficacy is your belief in
your ability to influence an outcome. In a
two-year randomized trial, baseline self-
efficacy was shown to have a significant
impact 
on 
exercise 
adoption 
and
maintenance.25 This applies to people
who want to exercise as well as those
who need to exercise for medical
purposes (of course, we all should
exercise to stay healthy). As researchers
note in their review, “patient compliance
with exercise prescriptions is more

likely to be successful if exercise self-
efficacy is assessed and enhanced.”26
Self-efficacy helps us achieve goals and
create habits, but Psychologist Albert
Bandura clarifies that “Expectation
alone 
will 
not 
produce 
desired
performance 
if 
the 
component
capabilities are lacking.”27 Believing in
yourself isn’t enough. Lacking the
baseline 
self-efficacy 
required 
for
success, however, is extremely common
in people who suffer from depression,
weak willpower, and repeated failures.
If you expect to fail, positive results are
hard to come by.
Mini Habits are a self-efficacy-

generating machine, and importantly,
you can get started successfully with
zero self-efficacy. Your daily successes
will train you to have high self-efficacy.
How can you not believe in your ability
to do one push-up per day? You can do it
in between these two sentences. And this
amounts to strengthening your self-
efficacy through practice. Mini habits
double as training for believing in
yourself.
Remember, your brain latches on to any
repetition you throw at it. So a problem
many people develop is an expectation
of failing to reach their goals. Over time,
this crushes their self-efficacy because
it's hard to believe that next time will be

different (especially if you're using the
same strategy that failed last time). If
you've been feeling hopeless, this is
exactly what has happened to you.
But...you CAN do it. I'm not being
motivational; I'm being logical. You can
literally make positive progress in your
life. To think otherwise is irrational
nonsense, and it comes from training
yourself to believe you can't.
Mini habits are the perfect way to start
over. No longer will you be intimidated
by massive goals. No longer will you be
attacked with feelings of guilt and
inadequacy for falling short. No, this
time you're going to be succeeding on a
daily basis. The victories may be small,

but one small victory to a defeated mind
is a big victory.
Right now, you might be wondering,
"How can one push-up a day or writing
50 words a day help me? That's not
enough progress to matter."
First, that's wrong—when any small
behavior becomes a habit, it matters. A
lot. A habit is the strongest behavioral
foundation a human can have. It's better
to have the habit of one push-up per day
than to do 30 push-ups every once in a
while. Only habits can be built stronger
and higher.
Also, you're free and encouraged to
exceed your target mark—I blow my

targets out of the water on a daily basis
now. But it's only because I MUST write
a measly 50 words a day that I am
inclined to write 2,000. Before this, I
didn't write at all on some days. It was
my ambition to write a lot that made me
write very little. Now I write at least 3x
as much as before. It's because I'm no
longer intimidated to start. I love my
safety net, too. I can call the day a
success if I take a few minutes to write
50 words—this is so empowering.
Many times, I have planned to “just
write my 50” and ended up writing
3,000 words. As I mentioned earlier, I
once wrote 1,000 words with a
headache and no energy. I felt like

Superman after doing that. I looked back
on the times I was completely healthy
and energetic but wasted time, and then
saw what I did with a headache and no
energy, and got even more excited to
share this book with the world.

Mini Habits Give You 
Autonomy
In a 2012 job satisfaction survey of 411
people, 65% of American and Canadian
respondents said they were unsatisfied
or somewhat unsatisfied with their
jobs.28 I think it's partly because of the
traditional management philosophy that
aims to control employees rather than
enable them. Other surveys have found
autonomy, or the feeling that you have
control and can make decisions, is a
primary factor in job satisfaction. A
Denmark survey conducted by The
European 
Working 
Conditions
Observatory found that “Almost 90% of

male employees and almost 85% of
female employees with high job decision
latitude are satisfied to a high degree,
while only about 56% of those with low
job decision latitude report a high
degree of job satisfaction.”29 This is a
specific example of a universal truth—
when a person feels controlled, they shut
down. People hate it. Perhaps this is
because autonomy is strongly associated
with freedom.
This is the downfall of many self-help
books. They'll say that you have to sweat
blood to get what you want in life. Well,
isn't sweating blood a sign that a part of
you really doesn't like it? Wouldn’t you
rather treat yourself well in the process

of changing into a better person?
The other extreme of self-help books
includes fluffy, motivational BS, and
other non-threatening prose to make you
feel good. You might feel motivated
temporarily, but as we've established,
relying on feelings and motivation
doesn't work in the long run.
In your journey, you're going to love the
weightlessness of mini habits. But this is
not a pushover system without structure.
It's not a vapid attempt to get you
psyched up. You'll set strict daily or
weekly requirements for yourself, but
they're so easy that your subconscious
won't feel controlled by your plans

(important!). Then, after you meet your
small requirement, you're free to do
what you want. Without guilt, and
without an overbearing burden of heavy
goals, you're free to explore these
healthy behaviors. It makes the process
more fun too, and that is a scientifically
relevant benefit!
One study found that when people
perceived tasks and decisions to be fun
(as opposed to tedious, boring, or
difficult), 
they 
had 
stronger
persistence.30 Researchers in this study
also noted the powerful impact of
autonomy, which you’ll notice is a key
component of mini habits. After your
mini habits, you’re free to do what you

want. Autonomy appears to work by
means 
of 
activating 
our 
intrinsic
motivation. Examples they mentioned in
which increased autonomy gave better
results (each supported by their own
study) are morbidly obese people losing
weight, smokers quitting, and diabetics
controlling their blood glucose levels.31

Mini Habits Marry The 
Abstract & Concrete
The two types of goals are abstract and
concrete. An abstract goal is “I want to
be rich;” a concrete goal is “I want to
make $15 by selling lemonade at 3PM
today.” 
Most 
people 
strongly
recommend that you aim for concrete
goals, but it is important to also know
your abstract life goals and values (as I
have written about before on Deep
Existence). Abstract thinking helps with
abstract goals, but can hinder the self-
regulation required for concrete goals.
A study by Labroo and Patrick showed

the potential effect moods can have on
our thinking.32 The experiments involved
various mood manipulation techniques
(i.e. asking people to “think of the
best/worst day of their life”), and then
tests to measure abstract thought ability
or preference. They concluded from the
study's five experiments that happiness
caused people to think abstractly, which
helps us see the big picture, but can
create a challenge for pursuing goals
requiring concrete thinking.
Another problem is seen from a study
by Ayelet Fishbach and Ravi Dhar; it
suggests early satisfaction or a high
expectation of success can make us feel
as if we've already succeeded.33 Dieters

were split into two groups. The
researchers reminded only one group of
their dieting progress, and then offered
both groups a reward choice—an apple
or a chocolate bar. Of the group
reminded of their progress, 85% chose
the chocolate bar compared to 58% of
the other group, suggesting an “I deserve
a reward” mentality.
A primary benefit of mini habits is being
able to do them no matter how you feel,
including 
that 
sense 
of 
pre-goal
satisfaction 
that 
tends 
to 
disrupt
progress. Because the requirement is so
small, there is no valid excuse—not
from happiness or lethargy—to skip it.

Happiness decreases your ability to
perform concrete goals, but since the
concrete part of mini habits is, for
example, just one push-up, it's still easy
to do while in an abstract state of mind.
It's so small that it requires very little
mental energy and attention. And since
happiness increases performance and
focus on abstract goals, after your
concrete goal, you can rely on your
abstract goal of “being fit” to make you
want to exercise more.
As I've had success with mini habits,
I've been happier, and it does make
concrete mini habits slightly more
difficult to achieve (still easy). But once
I start on a mini habit, the relevant

abstract goals of writing more, reading
more, or getting in great shape are easier
to pursue.
Because mini habits empower progress
on abstract and concrete goals, people
who are generally stronger in one or the
other can find success. Remember when
in the One Push-up Challenge I had to set
multiple goals to complete 15 push-ups?
I had to rely on concrete, tiny goals to
finish the workout. This flexibility is
important for consistency because of the
psychological changes we experience on
a daily basis. It's being prepared for all
possible situations and setbacks. There's
almost no situation that will cause a
complete failure to meet your mini

habits, but there are many scenarios
where you'll find yourself exceeding
your mini habits. The only time I've
failed (just one) of my three mini habits
was when I forgot to read and fell asleep
for the night. Mini habits are perfectly
suited for any mood or situation. You can
be happy and motivated, tired and
depressed, or even sick, and still
complete your mini habits and possibly
more.

Mini Habits Destroy Fear, 
Doubt, Intimidation, & 
Hesitation
These things are best conquered by
action. Taking the first step kills fear
over time, if not immediately. I'm no
longer intimidated to write. I no longer
have guilt about not reading enough.
Going to the gym is not daunting now—
it's fun. Fear can't exist if you've
experienced something and it wasn't
scary.
Mini habits compel you to take that first
step, because it's so easy. And even if
you step back into your safe zone right

after that, you're stepping out again
tomorrow. Eventually, you're going to
take a second step too. Mini habits
expose you to your doubts and fears in a
way that feels safe and empowering.
You'll see that exercise isn't so hard and
you can do it. You'll see that daily
writing is easy and writer’s block is a
self-fulfilling prophecy. You'll start
reading more books. You'll have a
cleaner home. Whatever you've been
wanting to do will become possible.

Mini Habits Create Insane 
Bonus Effects Of Increased 
Mindfulness & Willpower
One of the most important skills a person
can develop is mindfulness, which is
being aware of what you think and do.
Being mindful is the difference between
living purposefully and going through the
motions.
If your mini habit is to drink one glass of
water per day, you'll be more mindful of
how much water you drink in general.
When you have to monitor something
every day, however small, it climbs the
ladder of your consciousness and you'll

think about it even after you've met the
requirement. I'm so mindful of my
writing now because of my mini habit
that I think about opportunities to write
all day long. You will simultaneously
and naturally develop a mindfulness
habit, which will help with all future
habit 
modification 
(including 
bad
habits).
The next bonus is a willpower increase.
Since willpower needs endurance more
than raw power, frequent repetition of
small tasks is the ideal way to
“exercise” the willpower muscle. The
stronger your willpower, the greater
mastery you'll have over your body.
Many people are slaves to their bodies,

responding to every feeling and whim.
They believe they can't do things if they
don't want to do them at the time. Adding
mini habits is a great way to fix this
mindset while building willpower.
Enough talk. Let’s move to action. The
next chapter will show you how to
create mini habits to last a lifetime.

Mini Habits – Eight 
Small Steps To Big 
Change
“If you don't execute your 
ideas, they die.” — Roger von 
Oech 
The real fun begins now. This is the

step-by-step application guide to choose
and implement your own mini habits. I
recommend that you get a pad and pen
now to go through these and write down
your plans and strategy.

Step 1: Choose Your Mini 
Habits & Habit Plan
Make a quick list of habits you'd like to
have at some point. The important ones
will come to mind quickly. This will be
your reference list for step one. Visit
minihabits.com for ideas.
Note: habit ideas from minihabits.com
are already in minified form—you can
write down these mini habits now as
long as you know the larger habit it
represents. One push-up could stand for
general fitness or for a larger push-up
goal of 100 push-ups daily. Otherwise,
write down full-size habits for now.

It's tough to pursue one habit when you
have a few more habits you're anxious to
create. It takes a lot of discipline to
ignore everything else for a few months
in order to solidly develop one habit. It's
worth the sacrifice to build one habit
that can last a lifetime, but it remains a
challenge.
Good news, everyone. As I’ve alluded
to already, you can build multiple mini
habits at once! This is due to their small
willpower cost and flexibility. Their
“size” will vary, though—both in initial
difficulty and how much extra you’re
likely to do. I have written far more
bonus words than I've read bonus pages.
Writing is a priority for me, so it's

naturally where I put in the most effort.
That said, I also read much more than I
previously did, and on some days, I read
much more than I write. You're going to
love this flexibility, because it allows
for parties, traveling, and other schedule
aberrations.
Lately, I have been pursuing three mini
habits with great success. It’s four if you
count exercise, but that’s already a habit
—I go to the gym 3x a week. I still track
it weekly, but it is no longer a willpower
challenge. My brain is more likely to
encourage exercise than resist it now.
I would not recommend that you pursue
any more than four mini habits at a time

(and four might be too much). While
these habits are individually easy to
accomplish, the larger the quantity, the
more your focus will be divided
amongst them and the more likely you'll
neglect or forget one of them. Not only
that, but imagine having to meet 100 tiny
requirements every day. Yikes! There is
a willpower cost for having to do a
certain number of things every day. Two
or three mini habits will be the sweet
spot for many people.
Here are the habit plans to choose
from...
One Week Flexible Plan 
(recommended)

In this plan, you start with one habit and
use the Mini Habits system for one
week. Then you evaluate and choose a
long-term plan.
Evaluation at one week: Do you feel
burnt out? Do you find yourself easily
surpassing your requirement every day?
Are you crushing it and craving more
good 
habits? 
Depending 
on 
how
challenging it is for you, you can stay
with one or add more. Since not all
habits are of equal difficulty, defining a
set number that works for everyone isn't
possible or wise. Also keep in mind that
the more mini habits you have, the less
likely you are to overachieve in them.

Finally, 
consider 
what 
your 
most
difficult day would be like. Maybe
you're driving all day on the road or
preparing for a big party—can you
complete your mini habits then? Don't
imagine the easiest days; imagine the
hardest days. If you can do something on
the day you're tired, stressed, and very
busy, you can do it every day.
Now, if you feel like your willpower
can handle an extra mini habit (or two),
add it! Notice that I didn't mention your
schedule, because your mini habits
should take you less than ten minutes
combined to complete (if you don’t
decide to do extra). Everyone has ten
minutes 
to 
spare 
for 
something

important.
The 
one-week 
flexible 
plan 
is
recommended for people who want to
try the Mini Habits system, but aren't
sure yet what's best for them. This plan
will automatically turn into one of the
other plans.
Warning: It's important to mark the one-
week mark on your calendar to make a
firm decision that day about your future
plans. Don't allow a gap!
The Single Mini Plan
Do you want to write consistently more
than anything? Do you really want to get
serious about your fitness? Do you want
to dedicate yourself to daily reading?

This single mini plan places all of your
focus on one habit; it comes with a very
high success rate. I started off doing this
with the One Push-up Challenge, in
which I was required to do at least one
push-up every day. If your willpower is
as weak as mine was or if you're
depressed, one might be all you can
handle. You've got to start somewhere!
This is recommended for people who
have a single goal that dwarfs the others
in importance right now. It's also a good
option for those with very weak self
control to help them improve it.
Remember, you can always add more
mini habits, but it's more painful to have
to drop one.

Multiple Mini Plan
This is my current strategy and the most
advanced one, but that doesn't mean it's
too difficult for a beginner to have
success with. I have three mini habits,
but you'll see that two of them are
practically the same thing: I write at
least 50 words for anything, write at
least 50 words toward a book, and read
at least two pages of a book every day.
This is in addition to my now regular-
sized habit of working out at the gym 3
times a week (which evolved from the
One Push-up Challenge). Even with
three distinct daily goals, I can complete
my entire list easily in less than ten
minutes if needed (and never fail).

If you really want to try four or more
mini habits at once starting out, be my
guest. It could work, but I don't want it to
spoil this great system for you if it's too
much for you to consistently complete.
While each mini habit is super small, it
takes some willpower and discipline to
do them all every day. And Mini Habits
aims for 100% success, not 95%. If you
fail at just one mini habit, you won't
have the feeling of total success, which
is important for maintaining high self-
efficacy.
Your ideal quantity of mini habits is
largely determined by how difficult each
one is for you. Drinking water is easier
for most people than a fitness habit

(even when minified). Habits that
involve having to drive somewhere are a
significantly more difficult 
option,
especially 
because 
it 
depends 
on
availability, location, etc. Mine are easy
because I can bring my laptop with me
everywhere. Previously, I'd think, I
guess I can't write because I'm going
on vacation for 2 days. Not anymore!
Now I can be productive on vacation too
(I know what you're thinking, but I can
just meet the minimum if I want to relax
instead).
The multiple mini plan is recommended
for people who have several good habits
they're eager to develop or would feel
unsatisfied to only develop one at a time.

If you're not sure which plan is best for
you, choose the flexible plan and pick
one habit for now that you'd most like to
form. Don't be afraid to name the full
amount of what you want in this step
(e.g. exercising 5x a week consistently).
At this point, you should have a habit
plan, and full-sized habits to pursue.
They may be related to fitness, writing,
reading, 
drinking 
water, 
habitual
gratefulness, meditating, programming,
etc. Now we're going to minify them!
Make Your Habits “Stupid Small” 
The reason we tend to resist giving
ourselves small steps has to do with
societal norms, a habit of thinking

bigger, and pride. I can do 20 push-ups
easily, a person will think, so there's no
need to say I'll do just one. But this
thinking only takes into account one type
of strength (physical). Every possible
action—such as 20 push-ups—has a
willpower requirement attached to it. If
you're motivated, full of energy, and in
shape, 20 push-ups might not "cost" you
much willpower. But when you're a little
bit tired already and not feeling up to it,
not only will you have less willpower,
but the activity will “cost” more of it! A
mistake people make when setting goals
is not taking into account that their
motivation and energy levels are going
to fluctuate dramatically. They'll assume

that their current state of mind and
energy can be preserved or reactivated
when the time comes to act. What ensues
is a losing struggle against a brain that
doesn't want to change (in that way). But
this time, we're going to trick our brain
and win the willpower game.
My rule of thumb is to minify my desired
habit until it sounds stupid. When
something sounds “stupid small,” your
brain sees it as nonthreatening. These
are examples that sound stupid small to
most people:
One push-up a day? You're joking!
Get rid of one possession every day?
Worthless!

Write 50 words a day? You'll never
publish anything!
A skill you'll pick up as you practice
mini habits is finding creative ways to
make your actions smaller and smaller if
you feel resistance. If you're resisting
your single push-up today—say you have
to get in push-up position, or easier, that
you have to lie on your stomach on the
floor. If your mini habit is to drink one
glass of water every day, you can make
it smaller by deciding to fill a glass with
water, or one step further, pick up a
glass. If your mini habit is writing 50
words a day and you're resisting, open
up your word processor and write one
word. You won't need to do this most of

the time as your mini habits are already
“stupid small,” but remember you have
this in your arsenal for times of extreme
resistance.
Too small does not exist in regards to
mini habits. If you're unsure, go with the
smaller option. For ideas of mini habits
to implement, visit minihabits.com.
This is the key of the Mini Habits
system. You're going to repeat this too
small to fail action every day.
Just as important as making your mini
habit small is making your thoughts
small too. You must embrace this mini-
requirement as if it is a full goal. This
means if you meet the tiny requirement,

you're successful for the day. If you can
do that, you will get the “big” results you
desire.
What To Do With Weekly Mini Habits
I can understand that some things aren't
suitable for a daily plan. Exercise is
something that many people will want to
do 3-5 times a week. Who would want
to drive to the gym seven days a week if
they're only working out three days a
week?
Weekly habits will take longer to form
into habit, but they are consistent enough
for the brain to recognize as a pattern.
So if you really want to set a weekly
mini habit, try it and see how it works

for you. We can do something creative
with 
weekly 
habits, 
however, 
to
transform them into a daily requirement.
If you want to drive to the gym weekly,
as an example, you can set a hybrid mini
habit.
A hybrid mini habit is when you give
yourself a choice between two options
(do A or B). I'm not overly fond of
hybrid mini habits because they add to
the willpower cost (making decisions
also uses willpower), but they are the
best option in some cases. And I like that
they have you do something every day.
Hybrid mini habit examples:
• Drive to the gym OR dance for the

duration of one song
• Drive to the gym OR do one push-up
• Drive to the gym OR jog for one
minute
With this example, on off days, you have
a replacement activity. Won't people just
choose the easy one every day? First, I
think you might be surprised at what
you'll 
do 
without 
any 
additional
requirements. Granting yourself freedom
in a smart way is very empowering. And
you want to be fit, right? Second, the
mini habit here is just to drive to the
gym. If you want to, you can simply
drive back home. It sounds crazy, but I
must stress the importance of giving

yourself 
a 
way 
out 
of 
a 
big,
overwhelming 45-minute workout. Your
subconscious brain is smart enough to
know when a goal on paper isn't your
real goal. And it's when we force
ourselves 
into 
an 
intimidating
commitment that our slow-changing
brain rebels.
For a hybrid plans, I recommend starting
with no strings attached. Just see how
often you decide to go to the gym. If you
never seem to choose the gym, then you
can start by requiring one gym day per
week. Later, you can scale up to two
days required per week. Take your time
with this though. Don't be in a rush to
change, because your brain can't and

won't change quickly. It will take time
anyway, so easing yourself into it is the
most logical method.
Alright, now check over your list:
• Do you have a mini habit plan? Did
you 
choose 
flexible, 
single, 
or
multiple?
• Are your mini habits “stupid small”?
Say them out loud. If you laugh, they
pass.
• Is everything written down on paper?
Scrap paper is fine.
If so, great! On to step two.

Step 2: Use The Why Drill 
On Each Mini Habit
Everyone prefers to be healthy, but not
everyone is willing to put in the work
required to be optimally healthy. There
are benefits of eating fast food and
watching movies all day too. If your
problem has been that you want to do
things, but struggle to do them, then you
have the right book.
The best way to know if the habits are
worth the effort starts by identifying the
source. The best habit ideas are sourced
straight from your life values. We're not
looking for ideas that come from peer

pressure and others' expectations for
you. If you try to change based on
another person or society's opinion, I
think you know what will happen, but I'll
say 
it 
anyway: 
massive 
internal
resistance.
Using The Why Drill To Get To The 
Source
Drills drill. That's what they do. And I
call the following the “why drill”
because the simple question “why?” is
the best way to drill down to the core of
anything.
Once you've listed your habits, identify
why you want them. But don't stop there.
Ask why again. Continue to ask why

until it becomes circular and repetitive,
which means that you've found the core.
Honest answers are absolutely necessary
for this to work, so dig deep. There will
be more than one answer to these
questions, so try to pick the most
relevant ones. Here are two real and
honest examples of mine. One is a great
choice to make habit and the other is
highly questionable.
I want to write every day. Why?
Because writing is my passion. Why?
Because it's my favorite way to express
myself and tell stories. I can connect
with and help people through writing,
and I enjoy the process. Why does that

matter?
Those things make me feel alive and
happy. Why?
Because writing is clearly something I
value and treasure in life. Next example:
I want to get up at 6 AM daily. Why?
Because it's what successful people
seem to do, and it's embarrassing to get
up later. Why?
Because I have the sense that society in
general and certain people I know look
down on me for staying up and waking
up later.
In the second example, you can see that

the main reason for change is external
pressure. That said, getting up at 6 AM
could still make me happier. Because of
the preconceived notions I have about
waking up late and early, it makes me
feel more successful and decreases my
general sense of guilt when I get up
earlier. So it's not a throwaway, but
when pitted against something like
writing (and I'm writing very late at
night right now), I'm not going to give it
precedence. By staying up late to write,
I'm being true to my inner values, even
though the world might not agree with it.
It's ok if the world doesn't agree with
you—don't get bullied into a lifestyle
that doesn't suit you.

Step 3: Define Your Habit 
Cues 
The two common habit cues are time-
based and activity-based. In a time-
based cue, you'll say, “I'm going to
exercise MWF at 3 PM.” In an activity-
based cue, you'll say, “I'm going to
exercise MWF 30 minutes after I take
my last bite at lunch.”
People with 9-5 jobs have very
structured schedules, so time-based cues
tend to work well for them. Those who
have a lot of flexibility in their schedule
might benefit more from an activity-
based cue that lets them keep a solid, yet

flexible schedule. Which cue you'll use
depends on your (desired) lifestyle.
Time-based schedules are rigid with
little ambiguity (e.g. you start at 4 PM
sharp). This helps you to get work done
and build discipline. The downside is
lack of flexibility—maybe you'll get a
headache at 4 PM when you're supposed
to do something active. Life has a way of
throwing off our schedules. And when
you miss a cue and do the task late,
you’ll hit that awkward stage where you
don't know whether to feel successful or
guilty.
Activity-based are more flexible with a
bit more ambiguity. They help you build

structure into a typically structure-less
life. The tricky part is in knowing
precisely when one activity ends and the
other begins. If I am to start writing
something after lunch at a restaurant, do I
get to settle in and check the mail before
I start writing? Must I go straight to the
computer? You may think, that doesn't
matter, but it does, because as the
power of mini habits show us, little
tasks can easily extend into bigger tasks.
Suddenly you'll find yourself organizing
your entire desk and remember, oh yeah,
I was supposed to be writing. Small
steps get us started and allow us to build
momentum towards a meaningful goal,
but it works the other way too. If you

allow yourself small concessions, soon
enough you'll find them growing against
your will.
The question of time-based or activity-
based cues isn't all that important. They
can both work just fine. What is
important is that you choose, and choose
firmly. Not making a decision here is a
big mistake, but before you lock down
your choice, there is one more option
that might surprise you. It is my
preferred choice for all of my current
mini habits.
Freedom-based, Non-specific Habit 
Cues (General Mini Habits)
Traditional habit books will tell you

about the cue-behavior-reward structure
of habits from studies, and then proceed
to tell you the obvious next step—pick
your cue, behavior, and reward. But
what if you want to do something like
think more positively in general? What
if you want to do something at varying
times? Mini habits open up a new realm
of possibility here. The following is
especially 
relevant 
for 
flexible
schedules and general habits like
gratefulness.
Mini habits are rooted in autonomy,
freedom, and flexibility. The goal is to
empower you to have constant success.
We can apply this philosophy to
restrictive habit cues by instead setting a

24-hour deadline with no specific cues.
Have you noticed that bad habits have
multiple cues, while everyone suggests
that a good habit should have one cue?
It's no wonder bad habits are so strong!
They have sprawling roots tied to many
different cues in your life. That's
because bad habits grow naturally
through 
repetition 
in 
various
circumstances, while we grow good
habits artificially with the “single cue-
behavior-reward” formula. It's true that
if you only have a single cue, you will
still be more mindful of that behavior.
For example, if you think two happy
thoughts at 2 PM every day, then you'll
probably think them more in general too.

But doing it at 2 PM every day can feel
restrictive and forced (depending on
your personality). In addition, when you
set a specific time to do something, it
can feel wrong to do it outside of that
time. For people who have a morning
habit of writing, many of them won't
ever write at other times of the day. I
write at any and all times of day—
whatever fits my schedule best.
Another problem with specific cues is
their additional load on your willpower.
When you have to run at some point
today, that's flexible. When you have to
run at 3 PM, that's inflexible. The
additional pressure to perform the task
on time increases willpower cost.

Traditional habits suggest you pair this
time-sensitive cue with a big task,
making it even more difficult for you to
succeed. But for us, the total willpower
required 
even 
for 
“cue-triggered”
actions will still be small because of the
mini size of the action. Therefore, mini
habits are a better fit into the current
popular 
model 
of 
“cue-behavior–
reward” than traditionally-sized habits
are.
Note: I'm not saying that non-specific
cues are always better; they're better for
some people and some habits. Each
habit should be decided on individually.
A general habit is a habit with more than

one cue for action. Most of us already
have 
general 
habits 
of 
eating,
entertaining 
ourselves, 
mindlessly
browsing the Internet, and so on. Due to
the staggering number of cues we
experience every day, there's something
appealing about not choosing just one
cue for a good habit.
The rigidity of having only one cue can
hamper 
social 
opportunities 
and
spontaneity. But with the dominant habit
theories, having one cue is the only
viable way to make something a habit.
Having multiple cues would require too
much willpower, and each cue would
need to develop individually, drawing
out the process of becoming habit. That's

why mini habits are a game-changer.
A general mini habit requires you to do
your little requirement once per day, at
your leisure. I don't recommend midnight
as the deadline, as this is also inflexible.
I recommend that going to sleep for the
night signifies the end of your day. This
gives you the greatest chance to succeed
because you can squeeze in your mini
habits at the last second. I realize how
bad that sounds, but it serves an
important purpose in the early stages of
mini habits—nurturing your feeling of
constant success, which builds your self-
efficacy.
I did the One Push-up Challenge for a

few months. One of my embarrassingly
common cues early on was right before
bed (the deadline). This is an indicator
of poor discipline because I failed to fit
the habit into my schedule during the
day. But, instead of going to sleep
disappointed, I still went to sleep with a
win (and usually, I'd get in some bonus
reps too). When you go to sleep feeling
like a winner, especially if you do it for
many days in a row, it creates an internal
desire to improve even more. You've
heard that success begets success, right?
It's true. Successful people work harder
than depressed people because they're
already 
successful. 
Success 
ignites
passion and action. This is what mini

habits will do for you too. You'll feel
successful, which will make you want to
succeed more and more. I say this not
just as the author of this book and the
mind behind this system, but as its first
guinea pig. I've tried a lot of other
systems, and my mini habits results crush
anything else I've tried.
Back to the one push-up story: after a
while of “stealing wins at the buzzer,” I
wanted to do better. I began to get my
push-ups in earlier. The timing still
varied (different cues). This is why it's
ok to meet the minimum just before bed.
It encourages you to build your own self-
discipline. True self-discipline is not
when you have someone ordering you to

do push-ups, it's when you decide on
your own to do them. It's SELF-
discipline.
Despite my great success in reading,
writing, and exercising consistently, it
was weird, because I felt like a fraud. I
didn't have “habit cues.” All of the
popular habit books talk about them. The
science said they were essential. All I
had were daily requirements and a
weekly exercise quota. This is supposed
to be how people fail their habits, and
yet I'm having wild success. Why?
The first thing I realized is that these
studies test big, willpower-guzzling
goals like going out for a morning run at

6 AM, doing 100 push-ups daily, or
sticking with a workout program. Mini
habits, I realized, are so different that
some of these rules change.
Mini habits are too small to fail, even
without a cue.
You'll always have the ability to fit in
your habit right before bedtime (mini
habits generally take about one minute
each to do). And this nightly habit check
will become a habit too, which is
wonderful because it keeps you mindful
of your life. Did I meet my easy
requirements today? Yes. Excellent!
*sleep*
So what happens when you have a habit

too small to fail that’s without cues? The
development of multiple habit cues.
And this is really exciting. While I love
morning routines in particular and may
choose to develop one, it's been great to
have a general habit of writing. Writing
for me resembles the structure of a bad
habit. I'm sure I have specific cues (one
cue I've noticed is after I eat something),
but because I have multiple cues, it
seems like I just do it randomly.
But wait just a second... if it can take
months to form even one habit with a
single cue, it must take years to create
multiple cues! Nope. Mini habits are
minuscule and easy, and remember the
study earlier on habit-formation length?

It concluded that the difficulty of a
behavior is a primary determinant of
how long it takes to make it into a
habit.34 This means that mini habits can
become habitual much faster than
traditional habits can. The caveat, of
course, is that when your goal is 50
words and you write 2,000 each day, it
might take longer to make 2,000 words a
habit. But if you're crushing it to that
degree, that's a great “problem” to have,
right? And yes, if you don't have one
specific cue, your brain will take longer
to make it habit. So if you've got ten
habits you want to add to your life and
are going for speed, it will be faster to
set single specific cues for your mini

habits. On the other hand, if you want to
flexibly “weave” something into your
identity and schedule like I have with
writing, then make it a general Mini
Habit.
A recap of cue options:
• General mini habits are done once per
day.
• Time-cued mini habits are done at 3
PM, 9:45PM, etc.
• Activity-cued mini habits are done
after lunch, before work, while
driving, after using the restroom, etc.
A Few More Details On My General 
Mini Habits Experience

Some people do their writing in the
morning. I write at all times of the day.
Writing has become a lifestyle habit for
me. You know what happens to me now?
I'll be watching a TV show and get the
urge to write (a great, weird thing!). But
when I'm watching something with other
people, I don't get this urge, because it's
a different scenario. I react dynamically
and naturally to situations. When a friend
was over for a couple of days, I didn't
write as much, and that's exactly how I
want to live. If that became a recurring
issue that was making me unproductive, I
could adjust.
As you can see, this has some positive
implications for fixing bad habits as

well. 
“Wild” 
bad 
habits 
grow
unintentionally, and grow everywhere.
You'll have 98 cues to smoke a cigarette,
53 cues to watch YouTube videos, and
194 cues to browse the Internet
mindlessly. It's possible to let your good
mini habits grow “wildly” like this. Like
plants competing for nutrients, your good
habits can then crowd out your bad
habits. You can see that writing now
competes with watching TV shows for
me. This is less likely with specific-cue
habits, as they're tethered to just one cue.
They can be very strong, don't get me
wrong, but unless it shares a cue with a
bad habit, it will be isolated from it.
A word of caution: You want to be

deliberate about what habits you “let
grow” wildly. For example, some
people can't relax now because they are
workaholics. The work habit gets so
ingrained 
into 
their 
identity 
that
retirement confuses and bores them.
They want to work. I've decided that I
want to write and write a lot for the rest
of my life, so I'm willing to let my
writing habit mesh into my identity
(same for reading and exercise). But I'm
not sure I'd like the same type of habit
for bathing (once a day is fine). For that,
I prefer a cued habit like showering once
I get out of bed. Sleep schedules and
meals might also be best structured so as
to let the body get into a circadian and

dietary rhythm, respectively.
If you want something to become an
encompassing part of your life—good
examples 
include 
thinking 
positive
thoughts, 
writing, 
being 
thankful,
exercising/being active, giving to others,
minimalist living, etc.—I recommend
setting no specific cue for your mini
habit. Only give yourself a daily
deadline of doing it before you sleep for
the night.
If you want a behavior to have a
specific, carved out place in your life,
set a specific cue for it. Some examples
include exercising on specific days,
reading before bed, and writing in the

morning. Some people like to have their
lives very structured, so they might
choose only specific cues. It's all up to
preference. You can even choose a
combination of “wild” and cued habits.
Decision-making In the Moment
Especially if you're choosing general
mini habits, understanding the decision-
making process will help you to do them
when necessary.
We have two states of mind when
making a decision. First, we weigh our
options, which is called the deliberative
mindset. Then we commit to act, which
is called the implemental mindset.35
The goal is to move to the implemental

frame of mind (instead of getting stuck in
the deliberative frame of mind).
One advantage of cues is they cut out the
deliberative process and help you get
more quickly to an implemental state of
mind. This is highly appealing. Cues are
the key factor in what’s known as
implementation intentions, which are
predetermined decisions of exactly when
and 
how 
you'll 
do 
something.
Implementation intentions are known to
improve goal success. A mini habit with
a cue has an even greater chance of
success because it does not require much
commitment. It's so small that it's a “no
brainer.”

Mini habits can work without cues too,
though; their minuscule size is what
elevates 
them 
above 
competing
behaviors. So while you'd need to go
through the deliberative process without
having a cue, you should not get stuck
when trying to decide whether or not to
do one push-up or write 50 words. It's
too easy to think too hard about it. If you
ever find yourself stalling, remind
yourself how small your task is.
Now, write down your selected cues for
each mini habit. I like to keep all of mine
under the once per day at any time
umbrella. This keeps things simple.

Step 4: Create Your Reward 
Plan
If you're a prisoner hoping for parole,
when do you think is the best time for
your parole hearing? I'll tell you. It's
right after the parole judge takes a food
break. A study found that judges ruled
more favorably for prisoners just after a
food break (presumably, they were more
willing to listen).36 When you view the
chart of parole grant rates, there is an
obvious spike after each food break.
Making a difficult decision like granting
parole is a part of ego depletion—the
same energy resource that determines
our willpower. And food is a proven

reward that can restore it.
What do you think would happen if you
tried to make a new habit of sticking
your face in the dirt and eating some of
it? (Let's assume that you wanted to
build this habit.) You couldn't do it. The
obvious reason is who would want to do
that? But the brain’s reason is there’s no
reward. It's more like punishment. Your
brain would be very adamant against
this.
If you're not playing sports, exercise can
feel like a drag. Most people don't feel
like running around in circles or
climbing a fake staircase; they don’t feel
like pushing, pulling, and lifting various

heavy objects at the gym. It comes with a
feeling of discomfort.
I can say from experience that going to
the 
gym 
is 
three 
times 
more
uncomfortable when you're out of shape.
It feels like your muscles are saying,
Hey, we were sleeping! After your hard
workout, you get home, look in the
mirror, and your reward is...sweat? At
this point, your brain is probably asking
you where the real reward is.
There is a natural reward for the brain
when 
you 
exercise. 
In 
anaerobic
exercise, the brain releases feel-good
endorphins, also known as “runner's
high.” Interestingly, weight-lifting causes

endorphin release too, but only if it is
heavy and intense. Light or medium
intensity 
lifting 
won't 
trigger 
an
endorphin release because it doesn't
cause the body to switch to an anaerobic
state. I like how writer Tom Scheve puts
it:
“When your body crosses over from an
aerobic state to an anaerobic state, it's
suddenly 
operating 
without 
enough
oxygen to satisfy the muscles and cells
screaming out for it. This is when the
‘runner's high’ occurs.” 37
Think of the anaerobic state as a retail
store during the holiday season. The
body isn't keeping up with its normal

operations, so it has to go into another
mode to meet increased demand.
Endorphins are a nice natural reward for
the brain, but they may not be enough of
a reward for some people, especially at
first. As exercise can feel a bit like
punishment, you might need a bigger
reward. They use exercise as punishment
in the military for a reason!
Exercise 
has 
significant 
primary
rewards of sculpted abs, feeling great,
and being healthy, but these are delayed
from the time you first exercise.
Meanwhile, your brain wants cake
NOW! Cake is a sensory (or primary)
reward because the sugar hits the taste

buds and activates the reward center in
the brain. Exercise though, offers mostly
abstract 
(secondary) 
rewards, 
like
walking on the beach with a great body,
feeling satisfied with your effort, and
other higher-level thinking. Secondary
rewards, as you might guess, take longer
to “take hold” in the brain.
Reward Association
If exercise's endorphins and the promise
of eventual results do not sufficiently
reward your brain at first, you need to
call in back up. And because the world
is awesome, we don't have to play the
habits game fairly. What we can do is
attach completely unrelated rewards to
certain behaviors. After some time, the

brain will associate the behavior with
the reward, and that's what we want!
And later, the brain won't need the
(attached) reward.
If you've ever wondered why so many
foods include sugar, it might be because
sugar is mildly to moderately addicting.
Pretty much anything that delivers a
reward to the brain can be addicting. It
isn't healthy to consume sugar in excess,
but consuming small amounts of sugar
for the sake of continuing an important
habit may be worth the calories.
Moderation is the key here.
A creative way I like to reward my brain
is with laughter, which releases feel-

good chemicals. I'll sometimes follow a
writing session by watching the hilarious
Bad Lip Reading videos on YouTube.
Just for fun, the next time someone sees
you watching a funny YouTube video,
tell them you're training your brain. It's
science!
The secret to building habits is like
teaching a kid to ride a bike. At first,
you're letting the kid pedal as you're
holding on. But at some point, you let go
and the child rides on without you. Just
like this, at first we offer the brain an
extra 
reward 
after 
exercise, 
but
eventually the sense of satisfaction and
endorphins are enough for it to sustain
the behavior on its own. It learns to see

the value of these secondary rewards,
which are more pleasing and stronger
than sugar-laden rewards in many ways,
but it takes time.
Sensory (primary) rewards last as long
as the experience lasts. But the feeling
you get from being in great shape, or
doing 
something 
positive 
for 
98
consecutive days stays with you. Right
now I'm looking at a giant wall calendar
full of check marks that reminds me of
the progress I've made. It sounds lame to
look at checks and feel good, but my
brain knows exactly what each of those
marks means. In fact, if you want to be
happier, 
one 
study 
shows 
that
celebrating wins is the most effective

strategy for making us feel good about
our lives.38 That’s quite the endorsement
for Mini Habits, which is based on
celebrating and leveraging small wins.
Reward Strategy
It's not all work in exchange for
rewards, though. It's fun to live well and
there is satisfaction in developing a
good habit. That means if you're
exercising, look in the mirror after a few
weeks and remind yourself how that
progress came about. If you're writing,
celebrate your beefed up word count.
And even if you're only meeting the
minimum requirements on these, think of
the great habit you're forming to serve as
a foundation for more.

But strategy matters too. If you're using
the no cue strategy, then you can either
seek rewards after you take action or
stay conscious of how you feel and
reward yourself when you think you
need it. Mini habits offer the perk of a
greater 
sense 
of 
satisfaction 
than
traditional 
habits 
(i.e. 
a 
greater
secondary reward!). If you think a great
accomplishment feels good, know that it
feels even better when you did 95% of it
as bonus work. Though when you do a
lot of bonus work, you might want to
reward yourself to encourage that
behavior.
Abstract rewards such as a sense of
satisfaction are largely tied to your

mindset. This is why I emphasize that
you celebrate your small successes.
Success leads to more success, because
we like the results and feelings of
success. You’d do well to learn to love
delayed 
gratification 
too. 
The
anticipation of a bigger reward later is a
form of reward that can often conquer
the temptation to cash in on a smaller
reward now. The more you practice and
experience delayed gratification, the
more responsive you'll be to it!
My rule of thumb is to keep myself
happy while doing this. I know when I'm
nearing burnout, and that’s when I'll take
a rewarding break.

Rewards Appear To Restore Willpower
Rewards encourage repeat behavior, but
did you know that they also restore our
willpower? Cognitive scientist Art
Markman says, “When you stand in front
of that buffet table filled with desserts,
seek out a friend and have a fun
conversation.” 39
It may seem like a puzzling suggestion,
but rewards of all kinds may be a viable
way to restore your willpower.
Based on Baumeister's “ego depletion”
concept, 
multiple 
studies 
have
concluded that people can overcome ego
depletion by restoring glucose.40 Some
scientists, however, wanted to put

another willpower restoration theory to
the test: rewards. Their theory was that
perhaps it is the reward from eating
sugar that restores willpower.41 Sugar is
known to activate the reward centers in
the brain.
They started with typical exercises to
deplete willpower. Then, one group
swished a solution sweetened with
artificial sweetener and spit it out
(artificial sweeteners do not activate the
brain’s reward centers). The other group
swished with a sugary solution and spit
it out (which activates reward centers on
contact with taste buds). The results
showed that the people who swished
with artificial sweetener showed no

improvement in ego-depletion, but those
who swished with sugar did (i.e. their
willpower was restored to normal
levels).42 Because glucose levels were
not restored, but willpower levels were
restored, it appears that at least some
part of willpower restoration comes
from rewarding the brain. This is good
news for people who want to lose
weight, as it means that non-food
rewards may be effective in restoring
willpower.
So when Markman says to “seek out a
friend and have a fun conversation,” he's
telling you to restore your willpower
with a brain reward. Then you'll stand a
better chance against that chocolate

cheesecake (hey, I said better chance).
Willpower is commonly associated with
avoiding bad habits like this, but we
also use willpower to force ourselves to
do good things, so rewards will help us
stick with our good mini habits by
encouraging 
further 
behavior 
and
restoring our willpower.

Step 5: Write Everything 
Down
Writing 
something 
down 
instantly
elevates it above all of your other
thoughts. One study found that all
thoughts (positive or negative) held
greater prominence in the mind when
written down on paper.43 The same
impact has not been found for typing.
You’ve got to hand write it to amplify it.
Here are some strategies for tracking
your progress. In whatever strategy you
choose, I recommend that you check off
your success before you go to sleep. If
you check off your task early in the day,

the sense of completion might make you
feel less motivated to do “bonus reps.”
Also, it's a good habit to check it off
before bed so that you don't forget.
The Big Calendar (Recommended)
This is the strategy I use for tracking my
mini habits. I use a large desk calendar
on the wall in my room. I write my mini
habits on a nearby dry erase board, and
check off every day on the calendar that I
complete them (which is EVERY day,
except for the gym, which is 3x a week).
In the lower left corner of my day boxes,
I'll note when I go to the gym. Then, in
the upper right hand corner of Saturday's
box (last day of the week), I draw a
small tick mark. That way I can look at

that corner and instantly see how many
times I've been to the gym this week (or
previous weeks). It's simple and it
works great. Checking off a successful
day still feels great after months of mini
habits!
If you have a hybrid Mini Habit like
driving to the gym or doing one push-up,
you can note them by writing G for Gym
or P for Push-up. Then you can look
back and see how often you've been
choosing each.
Another option is a yearly “at a glance”
calendar if you're just going to be
checking off days. And a smart budget
move is to print one of the many free

printable calendars you'll find online
(tip: simply print out your Gmail
calendar). Physically making a check
mark makes your success feel more
tangible than digital tracking does.
Additionally, if you put it in a prominent
place where you'll see it often, it's going
to make you mindful of your mini habits,
your progress, and your success. Don't
underestimate the impact of this!
Jerry Seinfeld appears to have been a
pioneer in mini habits. He famously
marked each day on his calendar with a
big X if he completed his joke-writing
task. He recognized that daily progress
was the key to forming a habit and
improving his craft of telling jokes.

He first told young comedian Brad Isaac
about his productivity secret before a
show one day. Brad wrote about
Seinfeld’s response in an article for
Lifehacker:
“After a few days you'll have a chain.
Just keep at it and the chain will grow
longer every day. You'll like seeing
that chain, especially when you get a
few weeks under your belt. Your only
job next is to not break the chain.”44
This is a good summation of mini habits.
We don't want to break the chain. And
the only excuse for breaking the chain is
forgetting, because mini habits are too
easy to fail. But forgetting is a poor

excuse too, because your calendar will
be in plain sight and every night before
bed you'll ask, “did I do my mini habits
today?” And just to throw this out there,
I don't see mini habits as a fad you'll
drop in a few months, but as a lifetime
pursuit. It works too well and is too
flexible to quit!
Both writing down your mini habits
initially and checking them off as you go
is extremely important for your success.
Don't skip it. Regardless of how you
track your mini habits completion, I
suggest you at least handwrite the habits
themselves in a place you can see.
Digital Tracking

Some people will want to use their
smartphone, and while I prefer the old-
fashioned way now, smartphones have
some significant advantages. The first is
accessibility—people 
carry 
their
smartphones with them everywhere,
even on vacations overseas. The second
advantage is in visibility and reminders
—some apps can remind you to do your
mini habits, or serve as a concrete cue to
take action.
Here are the best apps to use for mini
habits on IOS and Android.
Lift for IOS (free)
If you want to go digital and have an
iPhone, I highly recommend the Lift app.

It tracks your daily or weekly progress
in whatever habits you set. It meshes
perfectly with the Mini Habits system
and lets you see how many days in a row
you've completed your Mini Habit. It
even connects you to other Lift users to
give you a feeling of community support.
Warning: The app might suggest that you
set a vague goal like “drink more
water.” I’ve seen this exact goal
recommended. Never do this. How does
one “drink more water?” If you swallow
a few drops of water in the shower, is
that good enough? Vague goals aren't
measurable and don't give you concrete
“I succeeded” or “I failed” feedback.
Concrete 
feedback 
is 
critical 
for

reinforcing behaviors. Make your mini
habits very specific and very small. You
can set the mini habit of drinking one
glass of water (with any of the cues
types), for example.
Habit Streak Plan For Android (free)
There is a Lift app for Android too, but
it's in Beta and current reviews rate it at
3.1 out of 5 (not great). The most
popular and best-rated habit-tracking
app on Android is called Habit Streak
Plan. It even allows you to set
reminders, which can serve as your
daily cue to do your mini habits and/or
as a cue to check your mini habits before
bedtime.

The app also tracks how many days
you've done it. It will show 52/53 if you
miss one day out of 53 days. Aim for
100% success with no excuses, but if
something crazy happens—and it better
be crazy given the size of these
requirements—and you miss a day, it
won't hurt you. If you miss two days in a
row, something is wrong. These are way
too easy to be missing two days in a
row. Flukes happen, but they don't
happen that often.
Again, do not set any vague goals as a
Mini Habit. Vague goals or habits are
unfocused, meaningless, and a terrible
idea.

Desktop/Laptop Solutions
I think the best simple habit tracker for
the 
desktop 
is 
Joe's 
Goals
(joesgoals.com). It's very simple.
Lift.do is the website for the desktop
version of the Lift app. You can also use
any number of online calendars.
My friend Harry Che also has a solution
for goals/habits called Goals On Track
(goalsontrack.com). Of all the goal
systems I've used, his is my favorite. I
made a lot of progress when I started
using it. There is a habit-tracking feature
in his program, so if you're looking for
an all-in-one solution to track goals and
habits, I'd recommend this. I'm wholly

focused on building habits, but not
everyone has that desire or luxury.
Overall, I think the mobile apps are a
better 
choice 
than 
computer 
apps
because desktops and laptops lack the
24/7 accessibility of cell phones.
Final Note About All Digital Apps
You're going to see ideas for pre-made
healthy habits to add from these apps
and websites. Resist the urge to start
these habits unless they are already
minified (unlikely). If you really like one
of them, make sure that you minify it
before adding it to your repertoire! It
looks fun to try doing 100 push-ups per
day, but it's less fun when you quit. It's

more fun to have one push-up per day as
a goal and blow that tiny goal away for
200+ days in a row. You can find mini
habit 
ideas 
at
http://minihabits.com/mini-habit-ideas/.
That page will be updated regularly with
new habits and “combo plans.” Combo
plans are habit packages you can try that
work well together. They’re mainly for
fun, so you can call yourself cool
phrases like “The Fit Writer,” which
includes these daily mini habits:
• One push-up (or another exercise Mini
Habit)
• Write 50 words
• Read 2 pages in a book

Step 6: Think Small
Why are we making these habits so
small when we could aim higher? And
what if you stop at your small goal? Is it
still useful? Yes, and it has to do with
willpower.
The advantage of willpower is that it
can be strengthened. Very disciplined
people are those who have strengthened
their willpower. But that's only to get
them started. The extremely fit people
you see in the gym don't have to force
themselves to exercise anymore. They
don't actually need willpower anymore,
because exercise has become their
brain's first preference. When you

develop a habit, you'll say, “Brain, we
need to exercise,” and your brain will
reply, “I was already on my way to the
treadmill. Try to keep up.”
We want to do three things on the road to
habit:
• Strengthen our willpower
• Make progress in the present moment
• Not exhaust our willpower
Losing any one of those three things
would be a problem: Who is ok with
always having weak self-control? Who
wants to “train” for 3 months before
making any progress in life? Who wants
to burn out from willpower exhaustion?

Uh...nobody.
Seeing those three tall orders doesn't
instill confidence in a possible answer,
but 
small 
steps 
satisfy 
all 
three
requirements. We’ll cover them, one by
one.
Mini Habits For Willpower Strength
What good is strong willpower if you
only have it for two hours a day? We
want our willpower to last the whole
day. Endurance training at the gym
involves lifting lighter weights with
higher repetition, which trains the
muscle to endure. Mini habits are the
same way. We're giving ourselves low-
willpower 
tasks, 
but 
with 
high

frequency. It takes very little willpower
to do one push-up (perhaps just a sliver
more than you'd think though—starting
something truly is the hardest part,
especially in regards to willpower).
Over time, this frequent repetition of
forcing ourselves to perform achievable
tasks makes our willpower stronger. It’s
practice.
Mini Habits For Progress
The biggest question of the Mini Habits
system 
is 
surely 
regarding 
the
meaningfulness of doing just one push-up
a day or thinking one positive thought
per day. One way to answer this is to try
it yourself and see what happens, but this

question still needs to be addressed
logically. How can this practice of doing
seemingly meaningless quantities of
work pay off with real results? There
are two ways that it pays off.
A. Mini Habits Bonus Reps: Seeing
yourself take action is more inspiring
and motivating than anything else. In
fact, this is a key strategy of Mini
Habits—once you're fully motivated to
do 
something, 
you 
don't 
need
willpower. Even though we're relying
100% on willpower to do these mini
habits, motivation plays a role when
we choose to do more than that. I
usually find myself highly motivated
once I start my habits, but only

occasionally before I take action. Mini
habits aren't anti-motivational; they
generate motivation. I failed with
getting motivated first for ten years, so
I'm very familiar with it and slightly
grumpy about it.
Whenever I do any mini habit, I almost
always do more. And by almost
always, I mean well over 90% of the
time, and by more, I mean a lot more.
Lay's Potato Chips had the famous
slogan, “Bet you can't eat just one.”
Well, I bet you can't do just one push-
up or write a few words. Once you
start, you're going to want more. At that
point, it's as easy to continue as to
stop. But what if you don't continue?

What if you only meet the minimum
requirement every single day? Is all
hope lost? No, not at all.
B. The Mini Habits Safety Net
(developing actual mini habits): The
hope with mini habits is that you'll
shoot for 50 words a day and develop
the habit of 2,000 words a day, but that
may not happen right away. If you stick
with your mini habit despite only
meeting the small requirement, it will
form into a habit, which makes it much
easier to do more of it. I know the
biggest hurdle for some people is
going to be patience. You don't want to
be the person writing 50 words a day
—you want to catapult yourself into

4,000 words a day and get to your
dreams as fast as possible. I have good
news for you. If you can write 4,000
words a day, do it. With mini habits,
there is no upper limit. Knock yourself
out and overwork yourself. As long as
you can meet your mini requirement
the next day too, you're fine.
To conclude, if you can only meet the
small requirement, it will still become
a habit (and relatively quickly based
on the small size). Once it is a habit,
you're in perfect position to build upon
it. I mean that literally—the perfect
foundation for doing more of something
is having an existing habit of that
behavior.

Know this: mini habits never hold you
back. That would be like saying a spark
holds back a fire from starting. Mini
habits 
are 
sparks 
with 
unlimited
potential. “Normal goals” might be
2,000 words of writing per day, but that
can become a ceiling as well as a
minimum. You'll feel satisfied at 2,000
words and say, “That's enough.” With my
50-word goal, I have written more than
5,000 words in one day. This is so
important to understand, because with
the wrong mindset, someone could think
that a small goal could hold them back.
At some point, that spark is going to
become a small flame, and later we'll all
be roasting marshmallows over the giant

bonfire, telling stories of yore.
If you want progress right now, you'll get
it. Work yourself into the ground if you
please. And I mention that because many
of you are going to be motivated to start
off strong.
Mini Habits To Mitigate Willpower 
Exhaustion
I touched on this in the previous parts,
but what makes mini habits great is that
you'll never have an excuse for failure,
you'll never fear failure, and you'll never
feel guilty. Even if you run out of
willpower, the requirement is so small
that you can find a way to get it done. I
can't think of a time when my willpower

was so weak that I would be unable to
do a push-up, read a couple pages in a
book, or write 50 words. Not a single
time.
For all of these reasons, small steps
don’t hold you back—they’re critical for
success.

Step 7: Meet Your Schedule 
& Drop High Expectations
Expectations are a tricky thing in life. It's
helpful 
to 
have 
generally 
high
expectations for yourself, because it
increases your ceiling. In other words, if
you don't believe you can be in good
shape, you never will be (as shown in
the self-efficacy study). It's not that
belief increases your ability to do things
—it increases your willingness to try. If
you never try to get in good shape, it's
not going to happen!
High expectations of a specific nature,
however, such as running eight miles a

day or writing 3,000 words a day, are
best avoided. A problem you're going to
run into is “sneaky swelling” of your
targets. Even if you have your mini
habits written down in plain sight, your
brain might pick up on how for the last
20 days, you've actually written about
1,500 words a day, not 50 words (a
personal example from the early days).
Your brain is always going to “register”
the behavior, not the intention.
Subconsciously, overachievement can
set a new expectation in your brain—one
that carries all of the weight and
pressure of the typical goals you've set
in the past (you know, the ones that don't
work). So it's vitally important to remind

yourself that your daily goal has NOT
changed. It's still only 50 words a day. If
you're continuing to exceed it, this can
feel disappointing, because you won't
want to break your 1,500 words-per-day
streak. To soothe this concern, remind
yourself of how you got to that point
(with the low goal) and that you're
welcome to continue to write that much
if you want, but you are NOT allowed to
feel guilty or like a failure if you write
50 words. 50 words is SUCCESS.
PERIOD! Not even all caps can stress
this enough, because if you get this
wrong, then reading this book is a waste
of your time. All of the benefits, power,
and advantages of this strategy hinge on

your ability to keep your goal small on
paper and in your mind.
If at any time you feel hesitant to meet
your goal, check your mind for hidden
requirements. Are you really shooting
for your mini goal, or has your target
grown? Refuse bigger targets—you
can do more with smaller ones.
Instead of high expectations for quantity
of work, we're going to place our
expectations and energy on consistency.
Life's most powerful tool is consistency,
because 
that's 
the 
only 
way 
for
behaviors to become habits, and when a
non-habit becomes habit, it literally
means that you've gone from fighting

against your brain to joining forces with
it.

Step 8: Watch For Signs Of 
Habit, But Be Careful Not 
to Jump the Gun
This step is another reminder of
patience. The Mini Habits strategy
works, but if you drop a behavior before
it's truly habit and go on to add your next
set of habits, then you're going to risk
dropping everything like an unskilled
juggler. (I am an unskilled juggler, but if
I set a mini habit to practice juggling for
one minute daily, I bet I would get good
at it.)
Signs that it's habit:

• No resistance: it feels easier to do the
behavior than not to do it.
• Identity: you now identify with the
behavior and would feel completely
confident saying, “I read books” or
“I'm a writer.”
• Mindless action: you'll engage in the
behavior without making an executive
decision. You won't think, Ok, I've
decided to go to the gym. You'll just
gather your things and go because it's
Tuesday, or because it feels like it's
time.
• You don't worry about it: starting out,
you might worry about missing a day or
quitting early, but when a behavior is

habit, you know that you'll be doing it
unless there's an emergency.
• Normalization: 
habits 
are 
non-
emotional. You're not going to be
excited that “you're really doing it!”
once it is habit. When a behavior
makes the transition to normalcy, it's
habit.
• It's boring: good habits are not
exciting; they're just good for you.
You'll be more excited about life
because of your habits, but don't expect
it with the behavior itself.
Warning: How to Handle 
Overachievement
Overachievement is one reason I love

this system. We previously discussed
how 
overachieving 
your 
target
repeatedly can create an expectation to
do it consistently before your willpower
can support that much work. This is
somewhat good and somewhat bad—it's
good because your brain is beginning to
make it a habit, but it's bad because it
raises the bar too soon, which removes
the many benefits of having mini habits.
Starting small and removing the pressure
of expectations is the recipe we're using
for success, and it works well, so we
want to keep it as long as possible.
Again, I'm not saying you can't do more.
If you really want to run five miles
today, but your target is just to run out

the front door, then that's great! Go ahead
and run the five miles, but don't change
your requirement to five miles. Always
be willing to meet your tiny requirement
and go back inside (you won't usually
choose to go back inside, even being
completely free to do so).
If you’re not overachieving right away,
don’t worry. My writing mini habit
caught fire right away, but it wasn’t until
the 57th day that I saw consistently
significant 
overachievement 
in 
my
reading mini habit. Some mini habit
sparks will take longer to ignite than
others. It mostly depends on your interest
level in the habit and your perceived
difficulty in continuing beyond your

initial target.
I’ve written well over my requirement
almost every day, but I continue to take
comfort in my freedom. I can stop at 50
words. If I have plans, I can meet the
requirement in minutes and enjoy my
day.
If you overachieve, that's great. If not?
That's still great. Not just ok, but great.
We celebrate all progress, because it's
not easy to change your brain. But then
again, it is kind of easy to do it this way,
isn't it? Compared to wrestling with
some massive goal and running on
willpower fumes, this is a relative
cakewalk with better results.

Eight Mini Habit 
Rules
“Know the rules well, so you 
can break them effectively.” 
― Dalai Lama XIV
Some rules are meant to be broken.
These aren’t, but the Dalai Lama quote
still 
applies. 
Once 
you 
master

something, you can manage it without
rules. The key is in understanding the
principles behind these rules.
Since these rules are helpful and
positive anyway, you won’t need to think
about breaking them. In fact, if you find
yourself struggling to make progress
with your mini habits, it’s probably
because you’re breaking one of these
rules.

1. Never, Ever Cheat
There are a few ways to cheat the Mini
Habits system. The first, most common
way to cheat is to give yourself a mini
habit such as one push-up per day, but
secretly require that you do more than
the single push-up. The reason why you
need to be really, really careful not to do
this is because every extra ounce of
requirement you put on yourself is going
to require more willpower to meet. And
while you can likely handle that extra
willpower load, you may be pursuing
multiple habits at once, and we want to
guarantee success, not toe the line of
success and failure. You are always

allowed to do extra, so let the extra reps
come from you, not your requirement. If
you want to do more in any session but
feel resistance, set additional small
requirements after your Mini Habit.
Unlike other habit programs and self-
help strategies, discouragement is very
rare with mini habits. If you only have to
do a single push-up or sit-up, what can
stop you from succeeding? It doesn't
matter that your goal is small. You're
training your brain for success and
building up a smaller version of what
you hope to accomplish someday (and
depending on your eagerness, someday
could be very soon!). If your results are
like mine, you'll be hitting your bigger

targets sooner than expected. But please,
please, 
don't 
let 
that 
raise 
your
expectations. Expect little and you'll
have the hunger to do more. When you
realize how powerful starting is, and that
yes, you had plenty of motivation to do
these things all along (which was
dormant until you started), life gets very
exciting.

2. Be Happy With All 
Progress
Being happy with small progress is
different from having low standards.
There's a quote by Bruce Lee that sums it
up: “Be happy, but never satisfied.”
Bruce Lee did more with his limited
lifetime of 32 years than two typical
people do with 80 years each, so I listen
to him.
In Derek Sivers' TED Talk, he showed a
video of a man dancing in a field at an
outdoor event.45 The man looked a bit
silly out there by himself, dancing wildly
to the music. After a few seconds of

dancing, another person joined him.
Then there were two. After another
several seconds, another person joined
them. And then another. And when the
group reached about 10 people, a giant
crowd of people rushed in to join them.
Dozens of people were dancing wildly.
It is quite the spectacle!
And how did it start? One man danced.
This concept shows exactly what mini
habits can do for you. The crowd of
people who joined late are like your
dormant dreams—shy and scared to take
action. They aren't confident enough to
dance in the spotlight. That first man
dancing is like your decision to take the

first small step. Then you notice, hey,
I'm actually doing this right now. That's
when your dormant dreams and passions
rush in to encourage you. You already
have all the inspiration you need inside
of you, but it may be dormant. Awaken it
with mini habits.
Mini habits are a pretty simple brain
trick at the core, but also a life
philosophy that values starting, letting
action precede motivation, and believing
that small steps can accumulate into
giant leaps forward. When you complete
a mini habit, it means your mini man is
dancing—cheer him on, because he's
starting your personal growth party!
Celebrate all progress.

3. Reward Yourself Often, 
Especially After a Mini 
Habit
What if rewards themselves were
rewarding? That is, what if there was a
benefit to receiving a reward other than
the reward itself? We typically think of
rewards as things we get for doing
something good, but rewards can give
back too. When you complete a Mini
Habit and reward yourself—whether it's
with food, a fun night out, or a
monologue in the mirror about how
amazing you are—your reward is going
to pay you back by encouraging you to
perform your mini habit again.

Ultimately, this creates a positive
feedback loop. You will get “addicted”
to living a great life, and if that's not
ideal, I don't know what is. A perfect
behavior would reward you now and
later. Since most healthy behaviors (like
gnawing on raw broccoli) offer limited
reward now and greater long-term
rewards, it's helpful to attach some form
of encouragement to the activity in the
early stages. Later, when you notice how
great you look and feel, you can assume
it's from the broccoli and smile.
Starting is the hardest part, both in the
moment and in the early days of habit-
building. Initially, you will see limited
results. After a hard workout you will

feel sore, but look in the mirror and see
no change. After eating broccoli, you
will feel about the same. After writing
on day one, you will not have a full
book. But when you do these things over
the long haul, you can end up with a fit
and healthy body and several full-length
novels.
I don't imagine people will forget to
reward themselves, but this “rule” is
here just in case.

4. Stay Level-headed
Aim for a calm mindset and trust in the
process. In these past months that I've
seen so much progress, I have not been
overly excited and “pumped up.” It has
been boring at times. The difference
between winners and losers is that the
losers quit when things get boring and
monotonous. It's not about motivation;
it's about leveraging and conserving your
willpower to form lifelong good habits.
The calm mindset is the best mindset for
building habits because it's steady and
predictable. You may get excited as you
make progress, but don't let that
excitement become your basis for taking

action. This shift to a reliance on
motivation/emotions is what foils many
personal development plans!

5. If You Feel Strong 
Resistance, Back Off & Go 
Smaller
Common “wisdom” tells us that we've
got to push through strong feelings of
resistance. Well, that's stupid. We've
already established that willpower is
limited, and if you're pushing beyond
your means now, it means you're going to
crash and burn later. If you think that you
can just do it later as well, then you're
not taking into account that you might not
have enough desire or willpower to do it
later.
Let's picture it. You're sitting down, and

you want to exercise, but you really
don't feel like it. There's intense
resistance. What do you do? In this
scenario, you don't want to wrestle your
brain if you can coax it into doing things
your way. Suggest progressively smaller
and smaller tasks until the resistance you
feel is minimal.
If your goal is to work out at the gym,
scale back to requiring yourself to drive
to the gym. Say it's really bad, and the
best you can do is open your clothes
drawer. After you do that, pick up your
workout clothes and put them on. If this
sounds stupid to you, that's great! When
it sounds stupid, that means your brain is
giving the go-ahead. These “stupid

small” steps slide under the brain's radar
like an expert jewel thief avoids security
cameras and trip sensors. And before
your brain catches on, you'll be on a
treadmill at the gym. No step is too
small.
The good news is that even if you burn
yourself out, the solution for taking
action despite burnout is stupid small
steps. Burnout is willpower exhaustion
—it 
happens 
when 
people 
force
themselves to do too much for too long.
But as you're exhausted on the floor, you
can appeal to your brain and say, “Hey,
could we just do one push-up right
now?” After that, you might get
motivated to do more, or you could set a

few more of these stupid small steps.
If you think this strategy sounds
absolutely, completely ridiculous and
stupid, it's because you think you can do
more. Your pride is telling you that
you're better than having to break tasks
down into small steps. But every giant
accomplishment is made of very small
steps anyway, and to take them one at a
time like this is not weak, but precise.
Before I did the first push-up of the One
Push-up Challenge, I felt “above” doing
it. I thought that one push-up was
worthless (because it's about like
clapping my hands as far as exercise
goes). But when it helped me exercise
for 30 minutes, it changed my mind. So

try this out, and see for yourself how you
can be nearly unstoppable with this
strategy.
When I feel resistance to any task, I
make it smaller. Problem solved.

6. Remind Yourself How 
Easy This Is
When you look at your mini task and feel
resistance, you're probably not thinking
about how easy it is.
When I was a month into my mini habits,
I felt strong resistance to reading my two
pages late one night. I was thinking of
how much I had read the day before, and
assumed that I needed to replicate that. I
had 
to 
remind 
myself 
that 
the
requirement was still just two pages.
Another interesting and encouraging
anecdote in favor of mini habits is
related to Allen Carr's book titled The

Easy Way To Quit Smoking. Carr’s book
has 
produced 
greater-than-expected
results for helping people quit smoking.
And do you know what the basic
technique is? Do you know what the
difference between Carr’s book and
most other quit smoking strategies is?
Rick Paulas discusses the surprising
success in his article about the book:
What’s most shocking about the
book’s contents is perhaps what’s
missing. There are no stats about lung
cancer, heart attacks, or strokes. No
scare tactics like what the social
pranksters at TheTruth.com dabble in.
No veiled threats to the state of your

sex life by focusing on bad breath and
stained teeth. “The health scares
make it harder [to stop],” writes
Carr. And are obviously ineffective.
[Paulas mentions how the book
repeats] Quitting is easy. Quitting is
easy. Quitting is easy.
“It’s very repetitive,” says Tompkins
[a smoker]. “And I was aware of that
while reading. Like, is this some
hypnosis thing?” 46
Carr’s five-hour seminar based on the
book has a 53.3% success rate, and that
absolutely blows other methods out of
the water (other methods have a roughly
10-20% success rate). It’s surprising,

because it’s just information. It isn’t
hands on. It’s not a patch that delivers
nicotine to the bloodstream.
And the secret? The key ingredient? The
magic?
He gets smokers to believe, consciously
and 
subconsciously, 
that 
quitting
smoking is easy. When you believe, as
many do, that quitting smoking is so hard
—doesn't it make sense that maybe your
own mind is making it difficult?
Mini habits make you believe that
adding healthy behaviors is easy. Even if
you're skeptical now, you'll have no
choice but to believe when it starts
happening.

Forget failures to get motivated; forget
epic willpower battles. The bar is so
low here that it’s possible to never lose.
And when you never lose, you tend to
win. Over time, your subconscious mind
will change, and it gets easier to change
your behavior from there.
And let me ask you—why were these
(and other healthy behaviors) ever
difficult in the first place? What's
challenging about typing words? What's
so tough about moving your body?
What's the big deal with sitting still for
an hour to comprehend text? The reason
these became such giant challenges in
our 
lives 
is 
because 
we 
were
indoctrinated into a motivation-based

society that says you have to get pumped
up to live your dreams or do your
laundry. Our brains have been trained
incorrectly with societal norms, limiting
beliefs, and overwhelming goals.
The typical person’s subconscious mind
is completely feral, dominating the
prefrontal cortex, because people run out
of energy trying to change their poorly
calibrated brain all at once. Mini habits
are the way for you to say, No, you know
what? It's not hard to exercise. It's
easy. I'm going to drop and do a single
push-up right now, and that's really,
really easy. It's so easy, I can do it
every single day. And I will. Then you'll
be in push-up position, having started,

and realize that it's also easy to do one
more push-up... and that it's relatively
easy to do several more after that. And
by that time, you will be inspired to
continue because your existing desire to
exercise in life will connect with the
realization that you can actually do this.
I'm excited for you. You're going to
realize that easy and hard are relative.
Why else would some people struggle to
get out of bed and run around the block
while others run 100-mile races? It's a
difference of the mind. Using most of the
strategies available to you today, you're
going to struggle mightily to change your
brain. They're all based on motivating
you or telling you that you can't give in

when it gets tough. But that kind of cheap
inspiration isn't going to last.
Mini habits are designed to change your
brain and your life from the inside out.
Your mini requirement becomes a
recurring spark inside of you that will
refuse to die out. THAT is inspiring.
You'll be in week three and realize, wow,
I'm still doing this. In week six, you'll
see results (word count, muscle, weight
loss, etc.) and prior beliefs about what
you could do will shatter before your
eyes. As long as you think small, you're
going to be a juggernaut. The momentum
you build and the mindset shift that will
take place will amaze you, as it has me.

Did you know that you're reading proof
of mini habits? How did a chronically
undisciplined guy write this book while
writing 4,000-word articles for his
blog? I gave myself a small requirement
—just write 50 words a day. In the first
week, I averaged about 1,000 words. In
the second week, 1,500. In the third
week, 2,000 words every day. I wasn't
trying harder; it was easier than before.
I hope you can see the changes ahead
with using mini habits. It's ok to get
excited, but excitement won't sustain
you. That will be your daily devotion to
do the smallest thing in order to make the
biggest difference in your life.

If you’re skeptical, this is fine too—just
give it a try and you'll see.

7. Never Think A Step Is Too 
Small
If you think a step is too small, you're
approaching this from the wrong angle.
Every big project is made of small steps
just like every organism is made from
microscopic cells. Taking small steps
keeps you in control over your brain.
Small steps are sometimes the only way
to move forward if you have weak
willpower. Learn to love them and you'll
see incredible results!

8. Put Extra Energy and 
Ambition Toward Bonus 
Reps, Not A Bigger 
Requirement
If you're anxious to make big progress,
pour that energy into your bonus reps.
Bigger requirements look good on paper,
but only action counts. Be the person
with embarrassing goals and impressive
results instead of one of the many people
with impressive goals and embarrassing
results.

Final Words
An Optional Modification: 
Increase Mini Requirement 
Incrementally (Careful!)
There is a modified version of the Mini
Habits system where you scale up your
requirement gradually. I prefer not to do
this, because with a greater requirement,
you lose freedom, flexibility, and
autonomy. I have never found the need to

do this with my mini habits, because the
requirement only affects me when I meet
the bare minimum (and on those days,
I'm happy the minimum is easy).
The best reason for you to increase your
requirement would be if you find
yourself only meeting the minimum day
after day. I would still give it at least a
month before you try this. If you go a
long time without doing extra beyond
your easy commitment, then mini habits
might not be as effective for you as for
others. Don't forget the safety net though
—it will still develop into a habit, and a
small habit is relatively easy to scale up.
If you work better with a rigid structure,

it's something to consider. But until a
behavior is habit, it's risky to increase
your 
requirements. 
If 
you 
do, 
I
recommend doing it very gradually.
Once you have a habit, you can
experiment with higher requirements
(such 
as 
my 
normal-sized 
gym
requirement after 6 months of doing one
push-up daily). Since you're building off
of a strong base at that point, and have
built 
up 
your 
willpower, 
bigger
requirements are much more attainable.
But again, I would be in no rush to do
this if you're getting good results with
your mini requirements.
It may be that you need 60 days of

meeting the bare minimum before you
can leverage the habit. This is how it
was with reading for me (as noted, day
57 is when I saw a big improvement).
I first started with one push-up per day,
and for about six months I only did about
1-20 push-ups daily. I also exercised at
the gym occasionally, but to start, this
was all I had to do. In late June, I
changed my goal to driving to the gym
three times per week. I'm not sure I
could have done this to start with
(maybe), but I know that doing the one
push-up challenge helped me build up
my self-discipline and willingness to
exercise to make this leap easy.

Apply This Strategy 
Elsewhere
Mini Habits is more than just a system
to teach you how to develop healthy new
habits—it’s a guide for self-control.
Now you know how your brain works,
why motivation fails, and how to manage
your willpower to make it last. Use
these techniques for any situation in
which you want to take action. The
better you get at mini habits, the more
success you'll have in all areas of your
life.
That’s all there is to say for now. I hope
the end of this book is the new beginning

of a very exciting Mini Habits journey
for you. And I wish you very small
successes, over and over and over again.
Sincerely,
Stephen Guise
