Does ‘&’ mean ‘and’?
Is this what ‘and’ means?

Various uses of and in English
a. We went out and had dinner.

although not in that order.

Gricean Maxims: Manner
Be eﬃcient in what you say:
1. Avoid obscurity of expression.
2. Avoid ambiguity.
3. Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity).
4. Be orderly.
‘p and q’ means
the same as
‘q and p.’
We choose the one
that matches the
order that p and q
happened.

Conditionals and material implication
▶p ⊃q is false only if there is an explicit counter-example: if p
is true, and q is false.

▶p ⊃q is false only if there is an explicit counter-example: if p
is true, and q is false.
▶Many people ﬁnd this problematic as an analysis of the
meaning of English if ...then sentences.

▶It is odd to assert a conditional if there is no apparent
connection between the antecedent and the consequent.

Conditionals and material implication

no If the cake was poisoned, then the dog is a space alien from
Alpha Centauri.

Is this all there is about conditionals?

Is this all there is about conditionals?
▶False antecedent:
?? If it’s Tuesday, then the dog will die.

Is this all there is about conditionals?
▶False antecedent:
?? If it’s Tuesday, then the dog will die.
?? Either it isn’t Tuesday, or the dog will die.

?? Either it isn’t Tuesday, or the dog will die.
▶True consequent:
?? If the cake was poisoned, it’s Monday.

Implicatures and pragmatics
▶The theory of implicature is part of a domain of study of
meaning which is called ‘pragmatics.’

Implicatures and pragmatics
▶The theory of implicature is part of a domain of study of
meaning which is called ‘pragmatics.’
▶Pragmatics deals with language in use and the way in which
context contributes to our use of words and sentences.

Other puzzles about connectives
▶English ‘or’ often seems to have an exclusive rather than an
inclusive sense (‘but not both’): but some have argued that this
is again the result of pragmatics.

▶What is the meaning of ‘but’? It seems to share the truth
conditions of ‘and’:

Summary and further considerations
▶The propositional connectives account quite well for much of
the meaning of natural language connectives.

▶The propositional connectives account quite well for much of

▶But, it looks like there are some aspects of the meaning of
sentences containing connectives which are not explained by
their truth-conditional deﬁnitions.
