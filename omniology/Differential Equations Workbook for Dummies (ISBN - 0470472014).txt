Introduction
T
oo often, differential equations seem like torture. They seem so bad in fact that you may 
be tempted to cringe or shudder when you’re assigned homework that involves ’em.
Differential Equations Workbook For Dummies may not get you to embrace differential equa-
tions with open arms, but it will improve your understanding of the pesky things. Here you 
get ample practice working through the most common types of differential equations, along 
with detailed solutions, so you can truly master the subject. Get ready to add “differential 
equations expert” to your résumé!
About This Book
Differential Equations Workbook For Dummies is all about practicing solving differential 
equations. It’s crammed full of the good stuff — and only the good stuff. Each aspect of dif-
ferential equations is addressed with some brief text to refresh your memory of the basics, 
a worked-out example, and multiple practice problems. (If you’re looking for in-depth 
explanation of differential equations topics, your best resource is Differential Equations 
For Dummies [Wiley] or your class textbook.) So that you’re not left hanging wondering 
whether your solution is right or wrong, each chapter features an answers section with all 
the practice problems worked out, step by glorious step.
You can leaf through this workbook as you like, solving problems and reading solutions as 
you go. Like other For Dummies books, this one is designed to let you skip around to your 
heart’s content.
Conventions Used in This Book
Some books have a dozen confusing conventions that you need to know before you can 
even start. Not this one. You need to keep just these few things in mind:
 
✓ New terms appear in italics the first time they’re presented. And like other math books, 
this one also employs italics to indicate variables.
 
✓ Web sites appear in monofont to help them stand out. (In some cases, a Web site may 
break across multiple lines. Rest assured I haven’t inserted any extra spaces or punc-
tuation; just type the address as provided.)
 
✓ In the answers section at the end of every chapter, the practice problems and solutions 
appear in bold (the step-by-step info that follows is in regular text). Matrices and key-
words in bulleted lists are also given in bold.

Differential Equations Workbook For Dummies 
Foolish Assumptions
Any study of differential equations takes knowledge of calculus as its starting point. You 
should know how to take basic derivatives and how to integrate before reading this workbook 
(and if you don’t, I recommend picking up a copy of Calculus For Dummies [Wiley] first).
Most importantly, I’m assuming you already have an in-depth resource about differential 
equations available to you. This workbook is intended to give you extra practice tackling 
standard differential equations concepts; it doesn’t provide detailed instruction on the fun-
damentals of differential equations. I do include some brief refresher text on each aspect 
of differential equations, but if you’re brand-new to the subject, check out Differential 
Equations For Dummies or your class textbook.
How This Book Is Organized
This workbook is organized modularly, into parts, following the same organizational struc-
ture as Differential Equations For Dummies. Here’s what you’re going to find in each part.
Part I: Tackling First Order Differential Equations
First order differential equations are the easiest differential equations to solve. That’s why 
this part gives you practice finding solutions to linear, separable, and exact first order dif-
ferential equations.
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and 
Higher Order Differential Equations
The most interesting differential equations used in the real world are second order dif-
ferential equations. Here, you practice multiple ways of solving this type of equation. You 
also get to try your hand at solving third and higher order differential equations. Things get 
pretty steep pretty fast, but fortunately you have some surprising techniques at your dis-
posal, as you discover in this part.
Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques
I’ve pulled out all the stops in Part III. In these chapters, you find some powerful solution 
techniques, including power series, which you can use to convert a tough differential equa-
tion into an algebra problem and then solve for the coefficients of each power, and Laplace 
transforms, which can occasionally give you the solution you’re looking for in no time.

 Introduction
Part IV: The Part of Tens
The classic For Dummies Part of Tens provides you with a couple collections of top ten 
resources. Flip to this part to find help with the ten common ways of solving differential 
equations or to discover ten real-world applications for differential equations.
Icons Used in This Book
For Dummies books always use icons to point out important information; this workbook is 
no different. Here’s the quick-and-dirty of what the icons mean:
 
This icon points out practice problems that have been worked out for you to get you off on 
the right foot.
 
Looking for the juicy tidbits that are essential to your study of differential equations? Then 
watch for paragraphs marked with this icon.
 
This icon denotes tricks and techniques to make your life easier (at least as it relates to solv-
ing differential equations).
Where to Go from Here
You can start anywhere you feel you need the most practice. In fact, this workbook was 
written to allow you to do just that. However, if you want to follow along with Differential 
Equations For Dummies or your textbook, your best bet is to start with Chapter 1.
You may also want to grab a few pieces of scratch paper. I’ve tried to leave you enough 
room to work the problems right in the book, but you still might find a little extra paper 
helpful.

elcome to the world of first order differential equa-
tions! Here, you put your skills to the test with lin-
ear first order differential equations, which means you’re 
dealing with first order derivatives that are to the first 
power, not the second or any other higher power. You 
also work with separable first order differential equations, 
which can be separated so that only terms in y appear on 
one side of the equation and only terms in x appear on the 
other side (okay, okay, constants can appear on this side 
too). Finally, you practice solving exact differential 
equations.

Chapter 1
Looking Closely at Linear First 
Order Differential Equations
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing what a first order linear differential equation looks like
▶ Finding solutions to first order differential equations with and without y terms
▶ Employing the trick of integrating factors
O
ne important way that you can classify differential equations is as linear or nonlinear. 
A differential equation is considered linear if it involves only linear terms (that is, 
terms to the power 1) of y, y', y", and so on. The following equation is an example of a linear 
differential equation:
 
Nonlinear differential equations simply include nonlinear terms in y, y', y", and so on. This 
next equation, which describes the angle of a pendulum, is considered a nonlinear differen-
tial equation because it involves the term sin θ (not just θ):
 
This chapter focuses on linear first order differential equations. Here you have the chance 
to sharpen your linear-equation-spotting eye. You also get to practice solving linear first 
order differential equations when y is and isn’t involved. Finally, I clue you in to a little (yet 
extremely useful!) trick o’ the trade called integrating factors.
Identifying Linear First Order 
Differential Equations
 
Here’s the general form of a linear differential equation, where p(x) and q(x) are functions 
(which can just be constants):

Part I: Tackling First Order Differential Equations 
2. 
Is the following a linear first order 
 differential equation?
  
  
 Solve It
1. 
Is this equation a linear first order 
 differential equation?
  
  
 Solve It
A. 
Yes.
  
This equation is a linear first order differ-
ential equation because it involves solely 
first order terms in y and y'.
Q. 
Is this equation a linear first order 
differential equation?
  
  
Following are some examples of linear differential equations:
 
 
 
For a little practice, try to figure out whether each of the following equations is linear or 
nonlinear.

9
 Chapter 1: Looking Closely at Linear First Order Differential Equations
Solving Linear First Order Differential 
Equations That Don’t Involve Terms in y
 
The simplest type of linear first order differential equation doesn’t have a term in y at all; 
instead, it involves just the first derivative of y, y', y", and so on. These differential equations 
are simple to solve because the first derivatives are easy to integrate. Here’s the general form 
of such equations (note that q(x) is a function, which may be a constant):
 
Take a look at this linear first order differential equation:
 
Note that there’s no term in just y. So how do you solve this kind of equation? Just move the 
dx over to the right:
dy = 3dx
4. 
Is the following a linear first order 
 differential equation?
  
  
 Solve It
3. 
Is this equation a linear first order 
 differential equation?
  
  
 Solve It

10
Part I: Tackling First Order Differential Equations 
Then integrate to get
y = 3x + c
where c is a constant of integration.
To figure out what c is, simply take a look at the initial conditions. For example, say that 
y(0) — that is, the value of y when x = 0 — is equal to
y(0) = 15
Plugging y(0) = 15 into y = 3x + c gives you
y(0) = c = 15
So c = 15 and y = 3x + 15. That’s the complete solution!
To deal with constants of integration like c, look for the specified initial conditions. For 
example, the problem you just solved is usually presented as
 
where
y(0) = 15
Time for a more advanced problem! (Note that this one still doesn’t involve any simple 
terms in y.)
 
where
y(0) = 3
Because this equation doesn’t involve any terms in y, you can move the dx to the right, 
like this:
dy = x3 dx – 3x2 dx + x dx
Then just integrate to get
 
To evaluate c, use the initial condition, which is
y(0) = 3
Plugging x = 0 → y = 3 into the equation for y gives you
y(0) = 3 = c

11
 Chapter 1: Looking Closely at Linear First Order Differential Equations
6. 
What’s y in the following equation?
  
  
  
  
where
  
  
y(0) = 2
 Solve It
5. 
Solve for y in this differential equation:
  
  
  
  
where
  
  
y(0) = 4
 Solve It
So the full solution is
 
 
As you can see, the way to deal with linear first order differential equations that don’t involve 
a term in just y is simply to
 
1. Move the dx to the right and integrate.
 
2. Apply the initial conditions to solve for the constant of integration.
Following are some practice problems to make sure you have the hang of it.
2. Integrate both sides to get the follow-
ing, where c is a constant of integration:
 
 y = x2 + c
3. Apply the initial condition to get
 
 c = 3
4. Having solved for c, you can find the 
solution to the differential equation:
 
 y = x2 + 3
Q. 
Solve for y in this differential equation:
  
  
  
  
where
  
  
y(0) = 3
A. 
y = x2 + 3
1. Multiply both sides by dx:
 
 dy = 2x dx

12
Part I: Tackling First Order Differential Equations 
Solving Linear First Order Differential 
Equations That Involve Terms in y
Wondering what to do if a differential equation you’re facing involves both x and y?
 
Start by taking a look at this representative problem:
 
The preceding is a linear first order differential equation that contains both dy/dx and y. How 
do you handle it and find a solution? By using some algebra, you can rewrite this equation as
 
8. 
What’s y in the following equation?
  
  
  
  
where
  
  
y(0) = 12
 Solve It
7. 
Solve for y in this differential equation:
  
  
  
  
where
  
  
y(0) = 10
 Solve It

13
 Chapter 1: Looking Closely at Linear First Order Differential Equations
Multiplying both sides by dx gives you
 
Congrats! You’ve just separated x on one side of this differential equation and y on the other, 
making the integration much easier. Speaking of integration, integrating both sides gives you
ln |y – (b/a)| = ax + C
where C is a constant of integration. Raising both sides to the power e gives you this, where 
c is a constant defined by c = eC:
y = (b/a) + ceax
Anything beyond this level of difficulty must be approached in another way, and you deal 
with such equations throughout the rest of the book.
If you think you have solving linear first order differential equations in terms of y all figured 
out, try your hand at these practice questions.
A. 
y = 2 + e2x
1. Use algebra to get
 
 
2. Then multiply both sides by dx:
 
 
3. Integrate to get
 
 ln |y – 2| = 2x + C
4. Then raise e to the power of both 
sides:
 
 y = 2 + eC e2x = 2 + ce2x
5. Finally, apply the initial condition 
to get
 
 y = 2 + e2x
Q. 
Solve for y in this differential equation:
  
  
  
  
where
  
  
y(0) = 3

Integrating Factors: A Trick of the Trade
Because not all differential equations are as nice and neat to work with as the ones featured 
earlier in this chapter, you need to have more power in your differential equation–solving 
arsenal. Enter integrating factors, which are functions of μ(x). The idea behind an integrating 
factor is to multiply the differential equation by it so that the resulting equation can be inte-
grated easily.
Say you encounter this differential equation:
 
where
y(0) = 7
To solve this equation with an integrating factor, try multiplying by μ(x), your as-yet-
undetermined integrating factor:
 
The trick now is to select μ(x) so you can recognize the left side as a derivative of something 
that can be easily integrated. If you take a closer look, you notice that the left side of this 
equation appears very much like differentiating the product μ(x)y, because the derivative of 
μ(x)y with respect to x is
 
Comparing the right side of this differential equation to the left side of the previous one 
gives you
 
At last! That looks like something you can work with. Rearrange the equation to get the 
following:
 
Then go ahead and multiply both sides by dx to get
 
Integrating gives you
ln |μ(x)| = 3x + b
where b is a constant of integration.

16
Part I: Tackling First Order Differential Equations 
Raising e to the power of both sides gives you
μ(x) = ce3x
where c is another constant (c = eb).
Guess what? You’ve just found an integrating factor, specifically μ(x) = ce3t.
You can use that integrating factor with the original differential equation, multiplying the 
equation by μ(x):
 
which is equal to
 
As you can see, the constant c drops out, leaving you with
 
 
Because you’re only looking for a multiplicative integrating factor, you can either drop the 
constant of integration when you find an integrating factor or set c = 1.
This is where the whole genius of integrating factors comes in, because you can recognize 
the left side of this equation as the derivative of the product e3xy. So the equation becomes
 
That sure looks a lot easier to handle than the original version of this differential equation, 
doesn’t it?
Now you can multiply both sides by dx to get
d(e3xy) = 9e3x dx
Then integrate both sides:
e3xy = 3e3x + c
and solve for y:
y = 3 + ce–3x

17
 Chapter 1: Looking Closely at Linear First Order Differential Equations
Because the initial condition stated that y(0) = 7, that means c = 4, so
y = 3 + 4e–3x
Pretty cool, huh?

factors.

equation by μ(x) to get

product):
 
 
3. Then identify the right side of the

equation by the integrating factor

elcome to separable differential equations! You know ’em; you may even love ’em. 
After all, they let you separate out the variables so only one variable appears on 
each side of the equal sign. What’s not to love about that?
In this chapter, you’re not going to limit yourself to linear differential equations (like those 
covered in Chapter 1). That is, you may see something like this:
 
But because the equations in this chapter are still considered first order, you can expect to 
see something along these lines:
 
To restrict the form of this differential equation even more, say that M(x, y) is really just a 
function of x — that is, M(x). Similarly, say that N(x, y) is really just a function of y — that is, 
N(y). Combined, that gives you
 
This differential equation is considered separable, because it can be written in a form where 
all terms in x are on one side of the equal sign and all terms in y are on the other side.

30
Part I: Tackling First Order Differential Equations 
For instance, multiplying by dx gives you
M(x) dx + N(y) dy = 0
and that can be written as
M(x) dx = –N(y) dy
which means you’ve separated the differential equation so that only x appears on one side 
and only y appears on the other.
Now that that’s settled, check out the following sections. They help you find implicit solu-
tions, make the supposedly inseparable separable, and get a handle on how initial condi-
tions affect a separable differential equation.
The Ins and Outs of Working with 
Separable Differential Equations
 
If you can separate a differential equation, you’re that much closer to solving it. Here’s the 
general form of a separable first order differential equation:
 
Note that both M(x) and N(y) don’t have to be linear in x and y, respectively. For example, 
you may encounter this differential equation, which is separable but not linear:
 
You can separate this equation like so:
x dx + y2 dy = 0
which gives you
x dx = –y2 dy
As you can see, the resulting equation is clearly separated.
Now consider this differential equation:
 
where
y(0) = 0

31
 Chapter 2: Surveying Separable First Order Differential Equations
You can separate this one into
dy = x2 dx
Integrating both sides gives you the following:
 
When you apply the initial condition, y(0) = 0, you get
c = 0
So the answer is
 
Here’s another example of a typical separable first order differential equation, followed by 
some practice problems you can work out for yourself.

Finding Implicit Solutions
Separating differential equations into x and y parts is fine; it can also be quite helpful. Yet 
sometimes you just can’t come up with a neat y = f(x) solution, no matter how hard you try. 
For example, what if you encounter a differential equation like this one?
 
You can multiply both sides by dx to get
(1 – y2) dy = x2 dx
As you can see, this is a separable differential equation. Integrating both sides gives you
 
Doesn’t exactly look easy to write in the form y = f(x), does it? That’s because it’s an implicit 
solution, also known as any solution you can’t write like y = f(x). (Solutions that can be writ-
ten the easy way are considered explicit solutions.)

Getting Tricky: Separating 
the Seemingly Inseparable
Sometimes you can convert differential equations that don’t look separable into separable 
ones by using a cool trick. Why would you want to take the time? Because separable equa-
tions are usually much easier to solve than differential equations that don’t appear separable.
 
To work some conversion magic on a differential equation, simply substitute y = vx into the 
equation. Often the result is an easier-to-solve separable equation.
Using y = vx is a useful trick when your differential equation is of the following form:
 
 
Note that this trick only has a hope of working if f(x, y) = f(tx, ty) where t is a constant 
 (meaning when you put in tx for x and ty for y, the t drops out).
Take a look at this problem:
 

36
Part I: Tackling First Order Differential Equations 
This differential equation may seem hopelessly inseparable to the uneducated, but lucky for 
you, you’re armed with the y = vx substitution trick!
First things first though: Make sure that f(x, y) = f(tx, ty). Substituting tx for x and ty for y 
gives you
 
The t drops out, leaving you with
 
So f(x, y) = f(tx, ty), which means you can try applying the y = vx trick. Substituting y = vx 
into this differential equation gives you
 
which becomes
 
Looks like this equation can be separated. When you do that, you get
 
Not too shabby. Now you can integrate to get
 
where k is a constant of integration. If you use the fact that
ln (a) + ln (b) = ln (ab)
and
a ln (b) = ln (ba)
you get
v3 + 1 = (mx)3
where m is a constant.
This equation is still in terms of v and x, but you want a solution in terms of x and y. Start 
substituting! From
v = y/x

37
 Chapter 2: Surveying Separable First Order Differential Equations
you get
(y/x)3 + 1 = (mx)3
or
y3 + x3 = m3x6
Solving for y gives you
y = (cx6 – x3)1/3
where c is a constant. And that’s the solution. Pretty cool, huh?
Review the following problem if you want to see another example of how to apply this 
handy trick that will make you the envy of all your friends (well, probably not really, but 
it’ll definitely make your differential equations experience a little easier!). Think you have a 
handle on it already? Move ahead to the practice problems.
 Q. 
Solve this differential equation by con-
verting it into a separable form:
  
  
 A. 
y = (cx8 – x4)1/4
1. First, test whether f(x, y) = f(tx, ty). 
Substituting tx for x and ty for y 
gives you
 
  Because the t drops out, you can try 
the y = vx trick.
2. Substituting y = vx into the equation 
gives you
 
  which becomes
 
3. Separate this result and get
 
4. Then integrate (where k is a constant 
of integration):
 
5. Using the fact that
 
ln (a) + ln (b) = ln (ab)
  and
 
a ln (b) = ln (ba)
  you get
 
v4 + 1 = (mx)4
  where m is a constant.
6. Next, substitute v = y/x:
 
(y/x)4 + 1 = (mx)4
  or
 
y4 + x4 = m4x8
7. Last, but certainly not least, solve for y 
to get
 
y = (mx8 – x4)1/4
  where m is a constant.

n exact differential equation is a differential equation that can be cast into the 
following form:
 
You can integrate the derivative in this case and get the solution f(x, y), which is precisely 
what this chapter is all about: finding f(x, y). In the following pages, you practice a simple 
test to determine whether a differential equation is exact (so that you don’t waste your time 
looking for f(x, y) if it’s not), and then you work on solving exact differential equations.
Exactly, Dear Watson: Determining whether 
a Differential Equation Is Exact
Unlike a detective who has to spend time (sometimes lots of it!) analyzing evidence, you can 
figure out whether a particular differential equation is exact or not in a flash. The approach 
I show you in this section saves you a good deal of time in the long run because you don’t 
have to invest any effort in trying to find the function f(x, y) if an equation isn’t exact.
 
Here’s the test for determining whether a differential equation is exact:
If you have the differential equation

whether a differential equation is exact or not.

Getting Answers from Exact 
Differential Equations
To find the solution to an exact differential equation like this one:
 
in a systematic way, you need to find a function f(x, y) such that
 
and
 
The correct function allows you to write the differential equation like this:
 
Here’s your assignment, should you choose to accept it: Try to integrate M(x, y) and N(x, y) 
with respect to x and y to see whether you can find f(x, y).
 
In this case,
M(x, y) = 2xy
which means that
 
If you integrate both sides, you get
f(x, y) = x2y + g(y)
where g(y) is a function that depends only on y, not on x. What’s g(y)? Ah, but you already 
know the answer to that question because
 
and
N(x, y) = (1 + x2)

64
Part I: Tackling First Order Differential Equations 
so
 
Because you know that
f(x, y) = x2y + g(y)
you get this:
 
So
 
Integrating with respect to y gives you the following:
g(y) = y + k
where k is a constant of integration. And because
f(x, y) = x2y + g(y)
you get
f(x, y) = x2y + y + k
You now know that the solution is
f(x, y) = c
which can be rewritten as
x2y + y = c
Note that k, the constant of integration, has been absorbed into the constant c. That’s the 
implicit solution to the exact differential equation. Want the explicit solution instead? Here 
you go:
 
The following example walks you through this process again, but feel free to skip ahead to 
the practice problems if you think you’re ready to test out your skills.

 Chapter 3: Examining Exact First Order Differential Equations
 Q. 
Solve this exact differential equation:
  
  
 A. 
y = c/x
1. You can identify that
 
M(x, y) = y
  or
 
2. Integrate to get
 
f(x, y) = xy + g(y)
  where g(y) is a function.
3. Do the same with the second part of 
the equation. Identify that
 
N(x, y) = x
  Because
 
  that means
 
4. If
 
  then
 
5. Integrate again to get
 
g(y) = k
  where k is a constant of integration.
6. Because
 
f(x, y) = xy + g(y)
  you get
 
f(x, y) = xy + k
7. In general, the solution is
 
f(x, y) = c
  so
 
xy + k = c
8. Absorbing k into c gives you
 
y = c/x

Chapter 4
Working with Linear Second 
Order Differential Equations
In This Chapter
▶ Solving second order differential equations that are both linear and homogeneous
▶ Reveling in the three roots: real, distinct roots; complex roots; and real, identical roots
A
re linear second order differential equations keeping you up at night? You know the 
ones. They look like this:
y" + p(x)y' + q(x)y = g(x)
where
 
and
 
Then this is the chapter for you because it’s all about practicing solving linear second order 
differential equations that are also homogeneous.
Note: In this chapter, you only solve differential equations for regions where p(x), q(x), and 
g(x) are continuous functions (that is, where they don’t take quick jumps in value). Usually 
there will be an initial condition, such as
y(xo) = yo
and
y'(xo) = yo'

82
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
Getting the Goods on Linear Second 
Order Differential Equations
 
In linear second order differential equations, the exponent of y", y', and y is 1. Equations not 
in that form are called nonlinear (but don’t worry, I don’t deal with those nasty things here).
The equation I present at the beginning of this chapter is the typical form used for linear 
second order differential equations in most textbooks. However, some textbooks seem to 
just want to make your life difficult, so they write the equation as follows:
P(x)y" + Q(x)y' + R(x)y = G(x)
Note that the only difference in this form is that y" has a coefficient, P(x).
 
You can convert such equations into the first format I present simply by noting that
 
and
 
and
 
Of course, linear second order differential equations can also be homogeneous, meaning 
that in an equation such as the following, g(x) = 0:
y" + p(x)y' + q(x)y = 0
Using the P(x), Q(x), R(x), and G(x) terminology that some textbooks prefer, note that you 
can also rewrite this equation with G(x) = 0:
P(x)y" + Q(x)y' + R(x)y = 0
If a linear second order differential equation can’t be put into either form, the equation is 
considered nonhomogeneous.
So now you’re up to speed on what makes a second order differential equation both linear 
and homogeneous, but can you tell just by looking at an equation that it has both character-
istics? Test yourself with the following practice problems.

83

homogeneous?

 2. 
Is the following equation both linear and 
homogeneous?
  
  
(y")2 + 4y' + 8y = 0
 Solve It
 Q. 
Is this differential equation linear and 
homogeneous?
  
  
 A. 
Homogeneous but not linear
1. If you group all the nonconstant terms 
on the left side of the equation, the 
result equals 0, so you can cast the dif-
ferential equation in this form (where 
the function f( ) has no constant terms):
 
  Therefore, the differential equation is 
homogeneous.
2. You can’t, however, put the differential 
equation into this form, because the 
exponent of y is 2 (not 1):
 
y" + p(x)y' + q(x)y = g(x)
  Consequently, the differential equation 
isn’t linear.

Finding the Solution When Constant 
Coefficients Come into Play
After you know that the second order differential equation you’re working with is both 
linear and homogeneous, the next step is to work it out. This section offers you some 
practice doing just that.
Following is an example of a second order differential equation that’s both linear and 
homogeneous:
y" – y = 0
where
y(0) = 9
and
y'(0) = –1

85
 Chapter 4: Working with Linear Second Order Differential Equations
To solve this differential equation, you need a solution y = f(x) whose second derivative is 
the same as f(x) itself because subtracting the f(x) from f"(x) gives you 0. I bet you can think 
of one such solution: y = ex. Substituting y = ex gives you
ex – ex = 0
so y = ex is a solution.
In fact, y = c1ex is also a solution, because y" still equals c1ex, which means that substituting 
y = c1ex gives you
c1ex – c1ex = 0
Guess what? That means y = c1ex is also a solution. In fact, it’s more general than just y = ex, 
because y = c1ex represents an infinite number of solutions, depending on the value of c1.
You can keep on going if you note that y = e–x is also a solution because
y" – y = e–x – e–x = 0
Of course, that realization alerts you to the fact that y = c2e–x is yet another solution because
y" – y = c2e–x – c2e–x = 0
Hmmm. If y = c1ex is a solution and y = c2e–x is a solution, then the sum of these two solutions 
must also be a solution:
y = c1ex + c2e–x
To match the initial conditions, you can use the form of the solution y = c1ex + c2e–x, which 
means that y' = c1ex  – c2e–x. Using the initial conditions, you get
y(0) = c1ex + c2e–x = c1 + c2 = 9
y'(0) = c1ex – c2e–x = c1 – c2 = –1
which leaves you with these two equations:
c1 + c2 = 9
c1 – c2 = –1
So now you have two equations in two unknowns. To solve them, write the first equation in 
this form:
c2 = 9 – c1

86
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
Then substitute this expression for c2 into the other equation:
c1 – 9 + c1 = –1
or
2c1 = 8
so
c1 = 4
Substituting this value of c1 into the first equation (c1 + c2 = 9) gives you
4 + c2 = 9
or
c2 = 5
The values of c1 and c2 give you your solution, which is
y = 4ex + 5e–x
Rooted in reality: Second order differential 
equations with real and distinct roots
Guessing solutions is great when it works, but you can’t count on always being lucky 
enough to get your desired answer. Instead, try assuming a solution of the form
y = erx
and plug that into the differential equation you’re working on. In the case of y" – y = 0, 
you get
r2y – y = 0
Dividing by y gives you
r2 – 1 = 0
which is actually the characteristic equation (the equation you get when you substitute in 
your assumed solution) for the differential equation. After you find the roots of the charac-
teristic equation, r1 and r2, you can determine that the solution to the differential equation is
y = c1er1x + c2er2x

87
 Chapter 4: Working with Linear Second Order Differential Equations
 
Three types of solutions are possible for the characteristic equation:
 
✓ r1 and r2 are real and distinct
 
✓ r1 and r2 are complex numbers (complex conjugates of each other)
 
✓ r1 = r2 where r1 and r2 are real
Here’s an example problem that shows you how to solve a differential equation in which r1 and 
r2 are real and distinct. Check it out and then try to solve the practice problems on your own.
 Q. 
Solve this differential equation:
  
  
  
  
where
  
  
y(0) = 2
  
  
y'(0) = –3
 A. 
y = e–x + e–2x
1. Assume a solution of the form
 
y = erx
2. Plug the assumed solution into the 
d ifferential equation to get
 
r2y + 3ry + 2y = 0
3. Divide by y to get the characteristic 
equation:
 
r2 + 3r + 2 = 0
4. Use the quadratic equation to get the 
two roots of the characteristic equation:
 
r1 = –1 and r2 = –2
5. Plug the two roots in to get the follow-
ing general solution:
 
y = c1e–x + c2e–2x
6. Find the derivative, y':
 
y' = –c1e–x – 2c2e–2x
7. Use the initial conditions to get the 
first equation
 
y(0) = c1 + c2 = 2
  and the second equation
 
y'(0) = –c1 – 2c2 = –3
8. Add the first and second equations 
together to get
 
–c2 = –1 or c2 = 1
9. Then plug this result into the first 
equation:
 
c1 + 1 = 2, or c1 = 1
10. Finally, use c1 and c2 to get the solution:

Adding complexity: Second order differential 
equations with complex roots
Now it’s time to solve second order differential equations where the roots of the character-
istic equation are complex, meaning they involve the imaginary number i. In this case, the 
roots, which you get from the quadratic equation, are of the form
r1 = m + in and r2 = m – in
where m and n are both real numbers.
The solutions to the differential equation are
y1 = er1x and y2 = er2x
so
y1 = e(m + in)x
and
y2 = e(m – in)x

90
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
Time to resort to two well-known formulas:
eiax = cos ax + i sin ax
and
e–iax = cos ax – i sin ax
to get the following:
y1 = e(m + in)x = emx(cos nx + i sin nx)
and
y2 = e(m – in)x = emx(cos nx – i sin nx)
By adding these two solutions and doing a little trigonometry, you can cast the solution as
y(x) = c1emx cos nx + c2emx sin nx
Want to walk through the process again? Review the following example. Or if you’re feeling 
up to the challenge, skip ahead to the practice problems.
 Q. 
Solve this differential equation:
  
  
2y" + 2y' + y = 0
  
  
where
  
  
y(0) = 1
  
  
and
  
  
y'(0) = 0
 A. 
1. Get the following characteristic equation:
 
2r 2 + 2r + 1 = 0
2. Use the quadratic equation to solve for 
the two roots:
 
r1 = –1/2 + (1/2)i
  and
 
r2 = –1/2 – (1/2)i
3. Put the solutions in this form:
 
r1 = m + in and r2 = m – in
  In this case,
 
m = –1/2 and n = 1/2
4. Use the equation:
 
y(x) = c1emx cos nx + c2emx sin nx
5. So the solution is
 
6. Use the initial conditions to find c1 and 
c2. Plugging into the initial conditions 
gives you the following first equation:
 
y(0) = c1 = 1
  as well as this second one:
 
7. Substituting c1 = 1 into the second 
equation gives you
 
  so c2 = 1, which makes the solution

Look-alike city: Second order differential 
equations with real, identical roots
The third and final type of solution for a characteristic equation involves identical real 
roots. If you substitute y = erx into the following differential equation:
ay" + by' + cy = 0
you get this:
ar2 + br + c = 0
For the purposes of this section, the roots are
r1 = –b/2a and r2 = –b/2a
That’s a problem, because you get these two solutions (which differ only by a constant):
y1 = c1e–bx/2a and y2 = c2e–bx/2a
Because the difference between these two equations is merely a constant, they’re really the 
same solution. Ah, but the fun doesn’t stop there! The actual two solutions really differ by

a factor of x (see the proof for yourself in Differential Equations For Dummies), so the real 
solution is
y(x) = c1xe–bx/2a + c2e–bx/2a
Following is another example so you can see the process in action before trying to solve the 
next four practice problems on your own.
 Q. 
Solve this differential equation:
  
  
y" + 2y' + y = 0
  
  
where
  
  
y(0) = 1
  
  
and
  
  
y'(0) = 1
 A. 
y(x) = 2xe–x + e–x
1. Solve for the characteristic equation:
 
r 2 + 2r + 1 = 0
2. Then factor the characteristic equation 
this way:
 
(r + 1)(r + 1) = 0
  Looks like the roots of the differential 
equation are identical, –1 and –1.
3. Therefore, the solution is of the form
 
y(x) = c1xe–x + c2e–x
4. To find c1 and c2, use the initial 
conditions. Substitute the first initial 
condition into the solution to get
 
y(0) = c2 = 1
  So c2 = 1.
5. Differentiate the solution to get y'(x):
 
y'(x) = c1e–x – c1xe–x = c1e–x(1 – x) – c2e–x
6. From the initial condition for y'(0), 
you get
 
y'(0) = c1 – 1 = 1
  So c1 = 2.
7. Plugging in c1 and c2 gives you the 
following general solution:
 
y(x) = 2xe–x + e–x

Answers to Linear Second Order 
Differential Equation Problems
Here are the answers to the practice questions I provide throughout this chapter. I walk you 
through each answer so you can see the problems worked out step by step. Enjoy!
a Is this differential equation linear and homogeneous?
 
  
 
Answer: Homogeneous and linear
 1. If you group all the nonconstant terms on the left side, the result equals 0, so you can cast the 
differential equation in this form (where the function f( ) has no constant terms):
 
  
 
 Therefore, the differential equation is homogeneous.
 2. You can also put the differential equation into this form, because the exponent of y is 2:
 
  y" + p(x)y' + q(x)y = g(x)
 
 Consequently, the differential equation is linear.
b Is the following equation both linear and homogeneous?
 
 
( y" )2 + 4y' + 8y = 0
 
Answer: Homogeneous but not linear
 1. Because all nonconstant terms can be grouped on the left side of the equation, your result 
equals 0. Consequently, you can cast the differential equation in this form (where the function 
f( ) has no constant terms):
 
  (y")2 – f(x, y, y') = 0
 
 This differential equation is homogeneous.
 2. You can’t put the differential equation into this form, because the exponent of y" is 2 (not 1):
 
  y" + p(x)y' + q(x)y = g(x)
 
 This equation isn’t linear.
c Is this differential equation linear and homogeneous?
 
  
 
Answer: Nonhomogeneous but linear
 1. In this case, you can’t group all the nonconstant terms on the left side of the equation and have the 
result equal 0, so you can’t cast the differential equation in this form (where the function f( ) has no 
constant terms):
 
  

95
 Chapter 4: Working with Linear Second Order Differential Equations
 
 Therefore, the differential equation isn’t homogeneous.
 2. You can put the differential equation into this form, because the exponent of y is 2:
 
  y" + p(x)y' + q(x)y = g(x)
 
 Consequently, the differential equation is linear.
d Is the following equation both linear and homogeneous?
 
  
d
2 y
dx
2 + 5 dy
dx + 9 y
2 = 3
 
Answer: Neither homogeneous nor linear
 1. Not all the nonconstant terms can be grouped on the left side and have the result equal 0, so you 
can’t cast the differential equation in this form (where the function f( ) has no constant terms):
 
  
 
 This differential equation isn’t homogeneous.
 2. You can’t put the differential equation into this form, because the exponent of y" is 2 (not 1):
 
  y" + p(x)y' + q(x)y = g(x)
 
 This equation isn’t linear.

 2. Plug the assumed solution into the differential equation to get
 
  r2y +4ry + 3y = 0

 8. Add the first and second equations together to get
 
  –2c2 = –2, or c2 = 1
 9. Plug this result into the first equation:
 
  c1 + 1 = 2, or c1 = 1
 10. Then just use c1 and c2 to get your solution:
 
  y = e–x + e–3x

elcome to the wonderful world of nonhomogeneous second order differential equa-
tions! (If you’re thinking “Homoge-huh?” flip to Chapter 4 for a refresher on what 
makes a second order differential equation homogeneous in the first place.) In other words, 
here’s your chance to play with equations that look like this:
y" + p(x)y' + q(x)y = g(x)
where g(x) ≠ 0.
You, lucky person that you are, get to handle linear second order differential equations like 
this one in the following pages:
y" – y' – 2y = 10e4x
 
The method of undetermined coefficients advises that when you find a candidate solution, y, 
and plug it into the left-hand side of the equation, you end up with g(x). Because g(x) is just 
a function of x, you can often guess the form of yp(x), up to arbitrary coefficients, and then 
solve for those coefficients by plugging yp(x) into the differential equation.
 
This method works because you’re handling only g(x), and the form of g(x) can often tell you 
what a particular solution looks like. For example, if g(x) is in the form of
 
✓ erx, then try a particular solution of the form Aerx, where A is a constant. Because 
derivatives of erx reproduce erx, you have a good chance of finding a particular solution 
this way.
 
✓ a polynomial of order n, then try a polynomial of order n. For instance, if g(x) = x2 + 1, 
try a polynomial of the form Ax2 + Bx+ C.
 
✓ a combination of sines and cosines, sin αx + cos βx, then try a combination of sines 
and cosines with undetermined coefficients, A sin αx + B cos βx. Then plug into the dif-
ferential equation and solve for A and B.

You get practice with each of these problem types within this chapter as you work to find 
the general solution to each equation.
 
In order to find the general solution to a nonhomogeneous linear second order differential 
equation, you must add the corresponding homogeneous equation’s solution to a particular 
solution of the nonhomogeneous equation (a particular solution is any solution of the non-
homogeneous differential equation).
Finding the General Solution for Differential 
Equations with a Nonhomogeneous erx Term
As you may know from class or from Differential Equations For Dummies, you can’t just find 
the solution to a nonhomogeneous linear second order differential equation that happens to 
give you g(x) when you plug it in. You have to do some extra work by adding the solution to 
the homogeneous version of the same differential equation.
Think about it. Say you have this differential equation:
y" + p(x)y' + q(x)y = g(x)
and the following solution gives you g(x) when you plug it in:
y = yp(x)
In order for your answer to be correct, you must add in the homogeneous solution; when 
you plug that into the differential equation, you get 0. So the general solution to the differen-
tial equation is
y = c1y1(x) + c2y2(x) + yp(x)
where c1y1(x) + c2y2(x) is the solution of the corresponding homogeneous differential equation:
y" + p(x)y' + q(x)y = 0
That is, y1 and y2 are a fundamental set of solutions to the homogeneous differential equa-
tion, and yp(x) is a particular (or specific) solution to the nonhomogenuous equation.
 
So to solve a second order differential equation that’s both linear and nonhomogeneous, you 
follow these overall steps:
 
1. Find the corresponding homogeneous differential equation by setting g(x) to 0.
 
2. Find the general solution, y = c1y1(x) + c2y2(x), of the corresponding homogeneous 
differential equation.
 
 This general solution of the homogeneous equation is referred to as yh.
 
3. Find a single solution to the nonhomogeneous equation.
 
 This solution is sometimes referred to as the particular (or specific) solution, yp.
 
4. The general solution of the nonhomogeneous differential equation is the sum of yh + yp.

107
 Chapter 5: Tackling Nonhomogeneous Linear Second Order Differential Equations
 Q. 
Find the general solution to this 
differential equation:
  
  
y" – y' – 2y = 10e4x
 A. 
y = c1e–x + c2e2x + e4x
1. Start by getting the homogeneous 
version of the differential equation:
 
y" – y' – 2y = 0
2. Assume that the solution to the homo-
geneous differential equation is of the 
form y = erx. When you substitute that 
into the differential equation, you get 
this as your characteristic equation:
 
r 2 – r – 2 = 0
3. Factor the characteristic equation this 
way:
 
(r + 1)(r – 2) = 0
4. You can now determine that the roots, 
r1 and r2, of the characteristic equation 
are –1 and 2, giving you
 
y1 = e–x and y2 = e2x
5. So the general solution to the homoge-
neous differential equation is given by
 
y = c1e–x + c2e2x
6. Now you need a particular solution to 
the nonhomogeneous differential equa-
tion that you started with:
 
y" – y' – 2y = 10e4x
  Because g(x) has the form e4x here, you 
can assume that the particular solu-
tion has the form
 
yp(x) = Ae4x
7. Substitute yp(x) into the differential 
equation to get
 
16Ae4x – 4Ae4x – 2Ae4x = 10e4x
8. Cancel out the e4x term:
 
16A – 4A – 2A = 10
  or
 
10A = 10
  so A = 1.
9. Tada! Your particular solution is
 
yp(x) = e4x
10.  Now, because the general solution of 
the nonhomogeneous equation that 
you started with is the sum of the cor-
responding homogeneous equation’s 
general solution and a particular solu-
tion of the nonhomogeneous equation, 
you get the following as your solution:
 
y = yh + yp
  which is actually
 
y = c1e–x + c2e2x + e4x
The following example problem walks you through each of these steps. Take a few minutes 
to check it out and then try your hand at the practice problems.

Getting the General Solution 
When g(x) Is a Polynomial
Sometimes g(x) acts as a polynomial, like in the case of g(x) = ax n + bx n – 1 + cx n – 2 (where a, 
b, and c are all constants). You need to know how to handle such situations so you can find 
the general solution to the nonhomogeneous second order differential equation in question.
 
Here’s how to solve a differential equation of this form, ay" + by' + cy = g(x), where a, b, and c 
are constants and g(x) is a polynomial of order n:
 
1. If g(x) is a polynomial, you can assume the particular solution is of the same form, 
using coefficients whose values have yet to be determined.
 
 yp = Anxn + An – 1 x n – 1 + An – 2x n – 2 + . . . + A1x + A0
 
2. If g(x) is the sum of terms, g1(x), g2(x), g3(x) and so on, then you can break the prob-
lem into various subproblems.
 
 ay" + by' + cy = g1(x)
 
 ay" + by' + cy = g2(x)
 
 ay" + by' + cy = g3(x)
 
 The particular solution is the sum of the solutions of these subproblems.

3. Substitute yp into the differential equation and solve for the undetermined 
 coefficients.
 
4. Find the general solution, yh = c1y1 + c2y2, of the associated homogeneous differen-
tial equation.
 
5. The general solution of the nonhomogeneous differential equation is the sum of 
yh and yp.
 
6. Use the initial conditions to solve for c1 and c2, if the problem calls for that.
Take a look at the following example. Then, if you’re game, try the following practice prob-
lems that ask you to solve for the general solution when g(x) is a polynomial.
 Q. 
Find the general solution to this differen-
tial equation:
  
  
y" = 12x2 + 12x – 2
  
  
where
  
  
y(0) = 1
  
  
and
  
  
y'(0) = 3
 A. 
y = x4 + 2x3 – x2 + 3x + 1
1. The homogeneous equation is simply
 
y" = 0
2. You can get the solution by integrating
 
y' = c1
  and then integrating again to get yh
 
yh = c1x + c2
  So the solution to the homogeneous 
equation is yh = c1x + c2.
3. Now you need to find the solution to 
the nonhomogeneous equation. The 
g(x) term is 12x2 + 12x – 1, so you can 
assume that the particular solution has 
a similar form:
 
yp = Ax2 + Bx + C
  where A, B, and C are constant coeffi-
cients that you must determine.
4. Uh oh. Your assumed form of yp 
has terms in common with yh, the 
general solution of the homogeneous 
equation:
 
yh = c1x + c2
 
yp = Ax2 + Bx + C
  Both of these equations have an x term 
and a constant term. When yh and yp 
have terms in common — differing 
only by a multiplicative constant — 
that’s not good because those terms 
are really part of the same solution.
5. Handle this issue by multiplying yp 
by successive powers of x until you 
don’t have any terms of the same 
power as in yh. For example, multiply yp 
by x to get
 
yp = Ax3 + Bx2 + Cx
6. You still have a problem, however, 
because the Cx term overlaps with the 
c1x term in yh. Go ahead and multiply 
by x again:
 
yp = Ax4 + Bx3 + Cx2
  This result has no terms in common 
with the homogeneous solution, yh, so 
now you’re good to go on.
7. Substitute the assumed solution into 
the differential equation:
 
12Ax2 + 6Bx + 2C = 12x2 + 12x – 2

12A = 12
 
6B = 12
 
2C = –2
  So
 
A = 1
 
B = 2
 
C = –1
9. Here’s your particular solution:
 
yp = x4 + 2x3 – 1x2
10.  Now you can determine that your 
general solution is
 
y = yh + yp = c1x + c2 + x4 + 2x3 – x2
  or, rearranging, you get
 
y = yh + yp = x4 + 2x3 – x2 + c1x + c2
11.  You can find c1 and c2 by using the 
initial conditions. Substituting y(0) = 1 
gives you
 
y(0) = 1 = c2
  so c2 = 1.
12.  Take the derivative of the general 
solution:
 
y' = 4x3 + 3x2 – 2x + c1
13.  Then substitute the initial condition, 
y'(0) = 3, to get
 
y'(0) = 3 = c1
14. The general solution is thus
 
y = x4 + 2x3 – x2 + 3x + 1

Solving Equations with a Nonhomogeneous 
Term That Involves Sines and Cosines
The third form g(x) can take on is a combination of sines and cosines. Take a look at this 
differential equation:
y" + 3y' + 2y = sin (x)
Of course, the general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular 
solution:
y = yh + yp
Because g(x) = sin (x) in this case, you can make an educated guess that
yp = A sin (x) + B cos (x)
where A and B are undetermined coefficients. How do you find A and B? Simply plug yp into 
the differential equation and then solve to get your coefficients.
The following problems give you practice using the method of undetermined coefficients 
to solve for the general solution to the nonhomogeneous equation when g(x) includes sines 
and cosines.

 Q. 
Find the general solution to this 
differential equation:
  
  
y" + 3y' + 2y = 10 sin (x)
  
  
where
  
  
y(0) = –1
  
  
and
  
  
y'(0) = –2
 A. 
y = e–x + e–2x + sin (x) – 3 cos (x)
1. Start by getting the homogeneous ver-
sion of the differential equation:
 
y" + 3y' + 2y = 0
2. Assume that the solution to the homo-
geneous differential equation is of the 
form y = erx. When you substitute that 
into the differential equation, you get the 
following as the characteristic equation:
 
r 2 + 3r + 2 = 0
3. Factor the characteristic equation this 
way:
 
(r + 1)(r + 2) = 0
4. Determine that the roots, r1 and r2, 
of the characteristic equation are –1 
and –2, giving you
 
y1 = e–x and y2 = e–2x
5. Therefore, the solution to the homoge-
neous differential equation is given by
 
yh = c1e–x + c2e–2x
6. Now you need a particular solution to 
the differential equation:
 
 
y" + 3y' + 2y = 10 sin (x)
7. Assume that the particular solution is 
of the form
 
 
yp = A sin (x) + B cos (x)
8. Then plug the A sin (x) term into the left 
side of the differential equation to get
 
 
y" + 3y' + 2y = –A sin (x) + 
3A cos (x) + 2A sin (x)
9. Now plug the B cos (x) term into the 
left side of the differential equation:
 
 
y" + 3y' + 2y = –B cos (x) – 
 
 
3B sin (x) + 2B cos (x)
10.  So you can write the differential equa-
tion as follows:
 
 
–A sin (x) + 3A cos (x) + 2A sin (x) – 
 
 
B cos (x) – 3B sin (x) + 2B cos (x) = 
 
 
10 sin (x)
  which means that
 
 
3A cos (x) – B cos (x) + 2B cos (x) = 0
  and
 
 
–A sin (x) + 2A sin (x) – 3B sin (x) 
= 10 sin (x)
11.  Dividing by sin (x) and cos (x) as 
appropriate gives you the first equation:
 
 
3A – B + 2B = 3A + B = 0
  as well as the second:
 
 
–A + 2A – 3B = A – 3B = 10
12.  Add three times the first equation to 
the second one:
 
 
9A + A = 10
  Looks like A = 1.
13. Use the second equation to find that
 
 
A – 3B = 1 – 3B = 10
  Guess what? B = –3.
14. So the particular solution is
 
 
yp = sin (x) – 3 cos (x)
15. The general solution is
 
 
y = yh + yp
  so that’s
 
 
y = c1e–x + c2e–2x + sin (x) – 3 cos (x)

 11. Find the solution to the following non-
homogeneous second order differential 
equation:
  
  
y" + 5y' + 6y = 10 sin (x)
  
  
where
  
  
y(0) = 1
  
  
and
  
  
y'(0) = –4
 Solve It
 12. Solve for the general solution of this 
equation:
  
  
y" + 4y' + 3y = 5 cos (x)
  
  
where
  
  
y(0) = 
7⁄2
  
  
and
  
  
y'(0) = –6
 Solve It
16.  Use the initial conditions to find the 
first equation:
 
 
y(0) = –1 = c1 + c2 + sin (0) – 
 
 
3 cos (0) = c1 + c2 – 3
  (so you get c1 + c2 = 2)
  and the second equation:
 
 
y'(0) = –2 = –c1 – 2c2 + cos (0) = 
–c1 – 2c2 +1
  (which gives you –c1 – 2c2 = –3)
17.  Add the first equation to the second 
equation to get
 
 
–c2 = –1
  Tada! c2 = 1
18.  Plug that result into the first equation 
to get
 
 
1 + c2 = 2
  so c1 = 1.
19.  All of that means the general 
solution is
 
 
y = e–x + e–2x + sin (x) – 3 cos (x)

Answers to Nonhomogeneous Linear Second 
Order Differential Equation Problems
Following are the answers to the practice questions presented throughout this chapter. 
Each one is worked out step by step so that if you messed one up along the way, you can 
more easily see where you took a wrong turn.
a What’s the general solution to this nonhomogeneous second order differential equation?
 
 
y" + 3y' + 2y = 6ex
 
Solution: y = c1e–x + c2e–2x + ex
 1. First, find the homogeneous version of the original equation:
 
  y" + 3y' + 2y = 0
 2. Assume that the solution to the homogeneous differential equation is of the form y = erx. When you 
substitute that solution into the equation, you get the characteristic equation
 
  r 2 + 3r + 2 = 0
 3. Go ahead and factor that out as follows:
 
  (r + 1)(r + 2) = 0
 4. If you determine that the roots, r1 and r2, of the characteristic equation are –1 and –2, you know that
 
  y1 = e–x and y2 = e–2x
 5. Thus, the solution to the homogeneous differential equation is given by
 
  y = c1e–x + c2e–2x
 6. Now you need a particular solution to the differential equation:
 
  y" + 3y' + 2y = 6ex
 
 Note that g(x) has the form ex here, so assume that the particular solution has the form
 
  yp(x) = Aex
 7. Substitute yp(x) into the equation:
 
  Aex + 3Aex + 2Aex = 6ex
 8. Cancel out the ex term:
 
  A + 3A + 2A = 6
 
 or 6A = 6, so A = 1.
 9. Your particular solution is
 
  yp(x) = ex
 10. Because the general solution of the nonhomogeneous equation that you started with is the sum 
of the corresponding homogeneous equation’s general solution and a particular solution of the 
 
 nonhomogeneous equation, you should get the following as the solution:
 
  y = yh + yp
 
 which is actually
 
  y = c1e–x + c2e–2x + ex

116
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
b Find the general solution to the following nonhomogeneous second order differential equation:
 
 
y" + 4y' + 3y = 30e2x
 
Solution: y = c1e–x + c2e–3x + 2e2x
 1. Start by getting the homogeneous version of the differential equation:
 
  y" + 4y' + 3y = 0
 2. Go ahead and assume that the solution to this equation is of the form y = erx and that when you 
 
 substitute this solution into the equation you get the following as your characteristic equation:
 
  r2 + 4r + 3 = 0
 3. Factor the characteristic equation this way:
 
  (r + 1)(r + 3) = 0
 4. Determining that the roots, r1 and r2, of the characteristic equation are –1 and –3 gives you
 
  y1 = e–x and y2 = e–3x
 5. Therefore, you know that the solution to the homogeneous differential equation is given by
 
  y = c1e–x + c2e–3x
 6. Now you need a particular solution to the equation:
 
  y" + 4y' + 3y = 30e2x
 
 Note that g(x) has the form e2x here, so assume that the particular solution has this form:
 
  yp(x) = Ae2x
 7. Substituting yp(x) into the differential equation gives you
 
  4Ae2x + 8Ae2x + 3Ae2x = 30e2x
 8. If you cancel out the e2x term, you get
 
  4A + 8A + 3A = 30
 
 which is
 
  15A = 30
 
 and that means A = 2, which gives you your particular solution of
 
  yp(x) = 2e2x
 9. Put it all together and you get this equation as the answer:
 
  y = yh + yp
 
 or
 
  y = c1e–x + c2e –3x + 2e2x
c Solve for the general solution to this equation:
 
 
y" + 5y' + 6y = 36ex
 
Solution: y = c1e–2x + c2e–3x + 3ex
 1. First, find the homogeneous version of the original equation:
 
  y" + 5y' + 6y = 0

117
 Chapter 5: Tackling Nonhomogeneous Linear Second Order Differential Equations
 2. Assume that the solution to the homogeneous differential equation is of the form y = erx. When you 
substitute that solution into the equation, you get the characteristic equation
 
  r 2 + 5r + 6 = 0
 3. Go ahead and factor that out as follows:
 
  (r + 2)(r + 3) = 0
 4. If you determine that the roots, r1 and r2, of the characteristic equation are –2 and –3, you know that
 
  y1 = e–2x and y2 = e–3x
 5. Thus, the solution to the homogeneous differential equation is given by
 
  y = c1e–2x + c2e–3x
 6. Now you need a particular solution to the differential equation:
 
  y" + 5y' + 6y = 36ex
 
 Note that g(x) has the form ex here, so assume that the particular solution has the form
 
  yp(x) = Aex
 7. Substitute yp(x) into the equation:
 
  Aex + 5Aex + 6Aex = 36ex
 8. Cancel out the ex term:
 
  A + 5A + 6A = 36
 
 or 12A = 36, so A = 3.
 9. Your particular solution is
 
  yp(x) = 3ex
 10. When you put all that together, you should get the following as the solution:
 
  y = yh + yp
 
 which is actually
 
  y = c1e–2x + c2e–3x + 3ex
d What’s the general solution to this nonhomogeneous second order differential equation?
 
 
y" + 2y' + y = 8ex
 
Solution: y = c1e–x + c2xe–x + 2ex
 1. Start by getting the homogeneous version of the differential equation:
 
  y" + 2y' + y = 0
 2. Go ahead and assume that the solution to this equation is of the form y = erx and that when you 
substitute this solution into the equation you get the following as your characteristic equation:
 
  r2 + 2r + 1 = 0
 3. Factor the characteristic equation this way:
 
  (r + 1)(r + 1) = 0
 4. Determining that the roots, r1 and r2, of the characteristic equation are –1 and –1 (which means you 
have real, identical roots) gives you
 
  y1 = e–x and y2 = xe–x

118
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
 5. Therefore, you know that the solution to the homogeneous differential equation is given by
 
  y = c1e–x + c2xe–x
 6. Now you need a particular solution to the equation:
 
  y" + 2y' + y = 8ex
 
 Note that g(x) has the form ex here, so assume that the particular solution has this form:
 
  yp(x) = Aex
 7. Substituting yp(x) into the differential equation gives you
 
  Aex + 2Aex + Aex = 8ex
 8. If you cancel out the ex term, you get
 
  A + 2A + A = 8
 
 which is
 
  4A = 8
 
 and that means A = 2, which gives you your particular solution of
 
  yp(x) = 2ex
 9. Put it all together and you get this equation as the answer:
 
  y = yh + yp
 
 or
 
  y = c1e–x + c2xe–x + 2ex
e Find the general solution to the following nonhomogeneous second order differential equation:
 
 
y" + 6y' + 8y = 70e3x
 
Solution: y = c1e–2x + c2e–4x + 2e3x
 1. First, find the homogeneous version of the original equation:
 
  y" + 6y' + 8y = 0
 2. Assume that the solution to the homogeneous differential equation is of the form y = erx. When you 
substitute that solution into the equation, you get the characteristic equation
 
  r2 + 6r + 8 = 0
 3. Go ahead and factor that out as follows:
 
  (r + 2)(r + 4) = 0
 4. If you determine that the roots, r1 and r2, of the characteristic equation are –2 and –4, you know that
 
  y1 = e–2x and y2 = e–4x
 5. Thus, the solution to the homogeneous differential equation is given by
 
  y = c1e–2x + c2e–4x
 6. Now you need a particular solution to the differential equation:
 
  y" + 6y' + 8y = 70e3x

119
 Chapter 5: Tackling Nonhomogeneous Linear Second Order Differential Equations
 
 Note that g(x) has the form ex here, so assume that the particular solution has the form
 
  yp(x) = Ae3x
 7. Substitute yp(x) into the equation:
 
  9Ae3x + 18Ae3x + 8Ae3x = 70e3x
 8. Cancel out the ex term:
 
  9A + 18A + 8A = 70
 
 or 35A = 70, so A = 2.
 9. Your particular solution is
 
  yp(x) = 2e3x
 10. When you put all that together, you should get the following as the solution:
 
  y = yh + yp
 
 which is actually
 
  y = c1e–2x + c2e–4x + 2e3x
f Solve for the general solution to this equation:
 
 
y" + 6y' + 5y = 36ex
 
Solution: y = c1e–x + c2e–5x + 3ex
 1. Start by getting the homogeneous version of the differential equation:
 
  y" + 6y' + 5y = 0
 2. Go ahead and assume that the solution to this equation is of the form y = erx and that when you 
substitute this solution into the equation you get the following as your characteristic equation:
 
  r2 + 6r + 5 = 0
 3. Factor the characteristic equation this way:
 
  (r + 1)(r + 5) = 0
 4. If you determine that the roots, r1 and r2, of the characteristic equation are –1 and –5, you know that
 
  y1 = e–x and y2 = e–5x
 5. Therefore, you know that the solution to the homogeneous differential equation is given by
 
  y = c1e–x + c2e–5x
 6. Now you need a particular solution to the equation:
 
  y" + 6y' + 5y = 36ex
 
 Note that g(x) has the form ex here, so assume that the particular solution has this form:
 
  yp(x) = Aex
 7. Substituting yp(x) into the differential equation gives you
 
  Aex + 6Aex + 5Aex = 36ex
 8. If you cancel out the ex term, you get
 
  A + 6A + 5A = 36

120
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
 
 which is
 
  12A = 36
 
 and that means A = 2, which gives you your particular solution of
 
  yp(x) = 3ex
 9. Put it all together and you get this equation as the answer:
 
  y = yh + yp
 
 or
 
  y = c1e–x + c2e–5x + 3ex
g Find the general solution to the following nonhomogeneous second order differential equation:
 
 
y" + 3y' + 2y = 4x
 
Solution: y = c1e–x + c2e–2x + 2x – 3
 1. Get the homogeneous version of the equation first:
 
  y" + 3y' + 2y = 0
 2. If you assume that the solution to the homogeneous equation is of the form y = erx, you get the 
following characteristic equation when you substitute that solution in:
 
  r 2 + 3r + 2 = 0
 3. Factor out the characteristic equation as follows:
 
  (r + 1)(r + 2) = 0
 4. Then determine that the roots, r1 and r2, of the characteristic equation are –1 and –2. Doing so gives 
you
 
  y1 = e–x and y2 = e–2x
 5. So the solution to the homogeneous equation is given by
 
  y = c1e–x + c2e–2x
 6. Hold up! You’re not done yet. You still need a particular solution to the differential equation:
 
  y" + 3y' + 2y = 4x
 
 Note that here g(x) has the form of a polynomial, so you can assume that the particular solution has 
the form
 
  yp(x) = Ax2 + Bx + C
 7. Great. Now substitute yp(x) into the differential equation:
 
  2A + 6Ax +3B + 2Ax2 + 2Bx + 2C = 4x
 8. There’s no term in x2 on the right, so A = 0, giving you
 
  3B + 2Bx + 2C = 4x
 9. Looking at the coefficient of x gives you
 
  2B = 4, so B = 2.
 10. Now you can take a look at the remaining constant terms; doing so gives you
 
  3B + 2C = 0

121
 Chapter 5: Tackling Nonhomogeneous Linear Second Order Differential Equations
 
 Because B = 2, that means C = –3.
 11. So the particular solution is
 
  yp(x) = 2x – 3
 12. Of course, you haven’t forgotten that the general solution of the nonhomogeneous equation you 
started with is the sum of the corresponding homogeneous equation’s general solution and a partic-
ular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation. That means you’ve found this solution:
 
  y = yh + yp
 
 which can also be written as
 
  y = c1e–x + c2e–2x + 2x – 3
h Solve for the general solution to this equation:
 
 
y" + 4y' + 3y = 3x + 10
 
Solution: y = c1e–x + c2e–3x + x + 2
 1. Start by finding the homogeneous version of the original differential equation:
 
  y" + 4y' + 3y = 0
 2. Assuming that the solution to the homogeneous equation is of the form y = erx means that when you 
substitute that solution into the differential equation, you get this characteristic equation:
 
  r2 + 4r + 3 = 0
 3. Here’s how to factor it:
 
  (r + 1)(r + 3) = 0
 4. Now go ahead and determine that the roots, r1 and r2, of the characteristic equation are –1 and –3, 
which gives you
 
  y1 = e–x and y2 = e–3x
 5. Thus, the solution to the homogeneous differential equation is given by
 
  y = c1e–x + c2e–3x
 6. Now you need a particular solution to this equation:
 
  y" + 4y' + 3y = 3x + 10
 
 Note that g(x) has the form of a polynomial here, which means you can safely bet that the particular 
solution has this form:
 
  yp(x) = Ax2 + Bx + C
 7. Substituting yp(x) into the equation gives you
 
  2A + 8Ax + 4B + 3Ax2 + 3Bx + 3C = 3x + 10
 8. Without an x2 term on the right, A = 0, giving you
 
  4B + 3Bx + 3C = 3x + 10
 9. Look at the coefficient of x to get
 
  3B = 3, which means B = 1.
 10. A quick look at the remaining constant terms gives you
 
  4B + 3C = 10

122
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
 
 What do you know? B = 1, so C = 2.
 11. Your particular solution is
 
  yp(x) = x + 2
 12. Put it all together to get the following equation as your solution:
 
  y = yh + yp
 
 so
 
  y = c1e–x + c2e–3x + x + 2
i Find the general solution to the following nonhomogeneous second order differential equation:
 
 
y" + 5y' + 6y = 12x – 2
 
Solution: y = c1e–2x + c2e–3x + 2x – 2
 1. Get the homogeneous version of the equation first:
 
  y" + 5y' + 6y = 0
 2. If you assume that the solution to the homogeneous equation is of the form y = erx, you get the 
following characteristic equation when you substitute that solution in:
 
  r2 + 5r + 6 = 0
 3. Factor out the characteristic equation as follows:
 
  (r + 2)(r + 3) = 0
 4. Then determine that the roots, r1 and r2, of the characteristic equation are –2 and –3. Doing so gives 
you
 
  y1 = e–2x and y2 = e–3x
 5. So the solution to the homogeneous equation is given by
 
  y = c1e–2x + c2e–3x
 6. Hold up! You’re not done yet. You still need a particular solution to the differential equation:
 
  y" + 5y' + 6y = 12x – 2
 
 Note that here g(x) has the form of a polynomial, so you can assume that the particular solution has 
the form
 
  yp(x) = Ax2 + Bx + C
 7. Great. Now substitute yp(x) into the differential equation:
 
  2A + 10Ax + 5B + 6Ax2 + 6Bx + 6C = 12x – 2
 8. There’s no term in x2 on the right, so A = 0, giving you
 
  5B + 6Bx + 6C = 12x – 2
 9. Looking at the coefficient of x gives you
 
  6B = 12, so B = 2.
 10. Now you can take a look at the remaining constant terms; doing so gives you
 
  5B + 6C = –2

123
 Chapter 5: Tackling Nonhomogeneous Linear Second Order Differential Equations
 
 Because B = 2, that means C = –2.
 11. So the particular solution is
 
  yp(x) = 2x – 2
 12. When you put that all together, you should get this as the general solution:
 
  y = yh + yp
 
 which can also be written as
 
  y = c1e–2x + c2e–3x + 2x – 2
j Solve for the general solution to this equation:
 
 
y" + 6y' + 5y = 5x + 16
 
Solution: y = c1e–x + c2e–5x + x + 2
 1. Start by finding the homogeneous version of the original differential equation:
 
  y" + 6y' + 5y = 0
 2. Assuming that the solution to the homogeneous equation is of the form y = erx means that when you 
substitute that solution into the equation, you get this characteristic equation:
 
  r2 + 6r + 5 = 0
 3. Here’s how to factor it:
 
  (r + 1)(r + 5) = 0
 4. Now go ahead and determine that the roots, r1 and r2, of the characteristic equation are –1 and –5, 
which gives you
 
  y1 = e–x and y2 = e–5x
 5. Thus, the solution to the homogeneous differential equation is given by
 
  y = c1e–x + c2e–5x
 6. Now you need a particular solution to this equation:
 
  y" + 6y' + 5y = 5x + 16
 
 Note that g(x) has the form of a polynomial here, which means you can safely bet that the particular 
solution has this form:
 
  yp(x) = Ax2 + Bx + C
 7. Substituting yp(x) into the equation gives you
 
  2A + 12Ax + 6B + 5Ax2 + 5Bx + 5C = 5x + 16
 8. Without an x2 term on the right, A = 0, giving you
 
  6B + 5Bx + 5C = 5x + 16
 9. Look at the coefficient of x to get
 
  5B = 5, which means B = 1.
 10. A quick look at the remaining constant terms gives you
 
  6B + 5C = 16

124
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
 
 What do you know? B = 1, so C = 2.
 11. Your particular solution is
 
  yp(x) = x + 2
 12. Put it all together to get the following equation as your solution:
 
  y = yh + yp
 
 so
 
  y = c1e–x + c2e–5x + x + 2
k Find the solution to the following nonhomogeneous second order differential equation:
 
 
y" + 5y' + 6y = 10 sin (x)
 
 
where
 
 
y(0) = 1
 
 
and
 
 
y'(0) = –4
 
Solution: y = e–2x + e–3x + sin (x) – cos (x)
 1. First, find the homogeneous version of the differential equation:
 
  y" + 5y' + 6y = 0
 2. Work under the assumption that the solution to the homogeneous equation is of the form y = erx. 
Doing so means that when you substitute that solution into the differential equation, you get this 
characteristic equation:
 
  r2 + 5r + 6 = 0
 3. The next step is to factor the characteristic equation as follows:
 
  (r + 2)(r + 3) = 0
 4. Then determine that the roots, r1 and r2, of the characteristic equation are –2 and –3, which 
gives you
 
  y1 = e–2x and y2 = e–3x
 5. You now know that the solution to the homogeneous equation is given by
 
  yh = c1e–2x + c2e–3x
 6. Next, you need a particular solution to the differential equation:
 
  y" + 5y' + 6y = 10 sin (x)
 7. Assume the particular solution is of this form:
 
  yp = A sin (x) + B cos (x)
 8. Plug the A sin (x) term into the left side of the equation:
 
  y" + 5y' + 6y = –A sin (x) + 5A cos (x) + 6A sin (x)
 9. Then plug the B cos (x) term into the left side of the equation:
 
  y" + 5y' + 6y = –B cos (x) – 5B sin (x) + 6B cos (x)

125
 Chapter 5: Tackling Nonhomogeneous Linear Second Order Differential Equations
 10. Hmmm. It appears you can write the differential equation this way:
 
  –A sin (x) + 5A cos (x) + 6A sin (x) – B cos (x) – 5B sin (x) + 6B cos (x) = sin (x)
 
 which means that
 
  5A cos (x) – B cos (x) + 6B cos (x) = 0
 
 and
 
  –A sin (x) + 6A sin (x) – 5B sin (x) = 10 sin (x)
 11. Dividing by sin (x) and cos (x) as appropriate gives you the first equation:
 
  5A – B + 6B = 5A + 5B = 0
 
 as well as the second one:
 
  –A + 6A – 5B = 5A – 5B = 10
 12. Add the first equation to the second:
 
  10A = 10, so A = 1.
 13. Use the second equation to find the following:
 
  5A – 5B = 5 – 5B = 10
 
 so B = –1.
 14. Therefore, the particular solution is
 
  yp = sin (x) – cos (x)
 
 and the general solution is
 
  y = yh + yp
 
 so that’s
 
  y = c1e–2x + c2e–3x + sin (x) – cos (x)
 15. Use the initial conditions to find the first equation:
 
  y(0) = 1 = c1e–x + c2e–2x + sin (x) – cos (x) = c1 + c2 – 1
 
 and the second equation:
 
  y'(0) = –4 = – 2c1 – 3c2 + 1
 16. Add twice the first equation to the second one to get
 
  –c2 + 1 = 0
 
 so c2 = 1
 17. Plug that result into the first equation to get
 
  –2c2 – 3 = –5
 
 so c1 = 1
 18. That means the general solution is
 
  y = e–2x + e–3x + sin (x) – cos (x)

126
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
l Solve for the general solution of this equation:
 
 
y" + 4y' + 3y = 5 cos (x)
 
 
where
 
 
y(0) = 7/2
 
 
and
 
 
y'(0) = –6
 
Solution: y = e–x + 2e–3x + sin (x) + cos (x)/2
 1. Start by getting the homogeneous version of the original differential equation:
 
  y" + 4y' + 3y = 0
 2. Go ahead and assume that the solution to the homogeneous equation is of the form y = erx. When 
you substitute that into the equation, you get this characteristic equation:
 
  r 2 + 4r + 3 = 0
 3. Factor that out:
 
  (r + 1)(r + 3) = 0
 4. Determine that the roots, r1 and r2, of the characteristic equation are –1 and –3. Doing so gives you
 
  y1 = e–x and y2 = e–3x
 5. So the solution to the homogeneous differential equation is given by
 
  yh = c1e–x + c2e–3x
 6. That’s all well and good, but you still need a particular solution to the differential equation
 
  y˝ + 4y' + 3y = 5 cos (x)
 7. Assume that the particular solution is of this form:
 
  yp = A sin (x) + B cos (x)
 8. Then plug A sin (x) into the left side of the differential equation to get
 
  y" + 4y' + 3y = –A sin (x) + 4A cos (x) + 3A sin (x)
 9. Next, plug B cos (x) into the left side of the equation to get
 
  y" + 4y' + 3y = –B cos (x) – 4B sin (x) + 3B cos (x)
 10. Surprise! Turns out you can write the differential equation this way:
 
  –A sin (x) + 4A cos (x) + 3A sin (x) – B cos (x) – 4B sin (x) + 3B cos (x) = cos (x)
 
 which means that
 
  4A cos (x) – B cos (x) + 3B cos (x) = 5 cos (x)
 
 and
 
  –A sin (x) + 3A sin (x) – 4B sin (x) = 0
 11. Dividing by sin (x) and cos (x) as appropriate gives you this as the first equation:
 
  4A – B + 3B = 4A + 2B = 5
 
 and this as the second equation:
 
  –A + 3A – 4B = 2A – 4B = 0

127
 Chapter 5: Tackling Nonhomogeneous Linear Second Order Differential Equations
 12. Add twice the first equation to the second one; the result is
 
  10A = 10, so A = 1.
 13. Use the second equation to find that
 
  2A – 4B = 0, so B = 1/2
 
 which means the particular solution is
 
  yp = sin (x) + cos (x)/2
 
 and the general solution is
 
  y = yh + yp
 
 which is actually
 
  y = c1e–x + c2e–3x + sin (x) + cos (x)/2
 14. Use the initial conditions to find the first equation:
 
  y(0) = 7/2 = c1e–x + c2e–3x + sin (x) + cos (x)/2 = c1 + c2 + 1/2
 
 and the second equation:
 
  y'(0) = –6 = –c1 – 3c2 + 1.
 15. Rewrite the first equation as follows:
 
  3 = c1 + c2
 
 and the second equation like this:
 
  –7 = –c1 – 3c2
 16. Add the first equation to the second one to get
 
  –4 = –2c2, which means that c2 = 2.
 17. Plug that result into the first equation to get
 
  –7 = –c1 – 6, so c1 = 1.
 18. Consequently, your general solution is
 
  y = e–x + 2e–3x + sin (x) + cos (x)/2

Chapter 6
Handling Homogeneous Linear Higher 
Order Differential Equations
In This Chapter
▶ Reviewing the higher order process with real and distinct roots
▶ Adding complexity with complex roots
▶ Avoiding double duty with duplicate roots
T
his chapter is where you get to practice tackling higher order differential equations, 
where n > 2. (Note: Higher order equations are sometimes referred to as nth order 
equations.) A general linear higher order differential equation looks like this:
 
 
Solving higher order differential equations where n = 3 or more is a lot like solving differential 
equations of the first or second order, with two exceptions: You need more integrations, and 
you have to solve larger systems of simultaneous equations to meet the initial conditions.
Every linear higher order differential equation you encounter in this chapter has constant 
coefficients, and the main way you can plan to tackle these problems is by attempting a 
solution of the form
y = erx
Substituting in this attempted solution results in a characteristic equation in powers of r, 
just as it does for the linear second order differential equations covered in Chapters 4 and 5. 
The problem here is that you’re dealing with cubic (or higher!) characteristic equations, 
as well as 3 × 3 systems of simultaneous equations to handle the initial conditions.
 
Whenever you’re facing a characteristic equation that’s tough to solve by hand, I recommend 
turning to a Web-based equation solver. You can find a good one at www.quickmath.com. 
From the home page, look for the Equations listing on the left-hand navigation bar. Then click 
the Solve link under the Equations listing. You can also solve systems of simultaneous equa-
tions online at math.cowpi.com/systemsolver. To make your life a little easier, you may 
want to refer to these Web sites as you solve the practice problems in this chapter.

130
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
As with linear second order differential equations, the characteristic equation you find can 
have three types of roots:
 
✓ Real and distinct roots
 
✓ Complex roots
 
✓ Real and identical roots
In this chapter, you get to try your hand at each of these possibilities in homogeneous 
linear higher order differential equations.
Distinctly Different: Working 
with Real and Distinct Roots
In this section, you practice the case where the characteristic equation has real and distinct 
roots first — that is, the roots aren’t imaginary, and they’re not the same.
Here’s a linear second order differential equation that’s homogeneous and has constant 
coefficients:
y" + 3y' + 2 = 0
Given this equation’s form, you can safely bet that the solutions are something like
y = erx
Plugging that solution into the differential equation gives you
r2erx +3rerx + 2erx = 0
and dividing by erx gives you
r2 +3r + 2 = 0
Surprise! There’s your characteristic equation, which you can solve with the quadratic 
equation to get
(r + 1)(r + 2) = 0
So the characteristic equation’s roots are –1 and –2, giving you these two solutions:
y = e–x and y = e–2x
The process is similar for higher order differential equations, but the algebra is a little 
tougher because the characteristic equation is of a higher order. See what I mean in the fol-
lowing example problem and then try to solve a few of the practice problems on your own.

 Q. 
Find the solution to this differential 
equation:
  
  
y''' – 6y" + 11y' – 6y = 0
  
  
with these initial conditions:
  
  
y(0) = 9
  
  
y'(0) = 20
  
  
y"(0) = 50
 A. 
y = 2ex + 3e2x + 4e3x
1. This differential equation has constant 
coefficients, so you can start by assum-
ing a solution of the form
 
 
y = erx
2. Plugging your attempted solution into 
the differential equation gives you
 
 
r 3erx – 6r 2erx + 11rerx – 6erx = 0
3. Canceling out erx leaves you with
 
 
r 3 – 6r 2 + 11r – 6 = 0
4. Now you have a cubic equation. Curb 
that racing pulse and take a minute to 
really look at the equation. See how 
you can factor it into the following?
 
 
(r – 1)(r – 2)(r – 3) = 0
  If you’re not a fan of factoring the char-
acteristic equation by hand, try using 
the equation-solving function at www.
quickmath.com. (Flip back to the 
chapter introduction to see exactly how 
to access that part of the Web site.)
5. The roots are
 
 
r1 = 1, r2 = 2, and r3 = 3
6. Because the roots are real and distinct, 
the solutions are as follows:
 
 
y1 = ex, y2 = e2x, and y3 = e3x
7. Therefore, the general solution is
 
 
y = c1ex + c2e2x + c3e3x
8. Now you can apply the initial condi-
tions (about time, huh?). In addition to 
the form for y, you also need y', which 
you can calculate as
 
 
y' = c1ex + 2c2e2x + 3c3e3x
  as well as y", which you can calculate as
 
 
y" = c1ex + 4c2e2x + 9c3e3x
9. From the initial conditions, here are 
your three simultaneous equations in 
c1, c2, and c3 that you must solve to find 
those coefficients:
 
 
y(0) = c1 + c2 + c3 = 9
 
 
y'(0) = c1 + 2c2 + 3c3 = 20
 
 
y"(0) = c1 + 4c2 + 9c3 = 50
10.  If you solve this system of three 
equations by hand, you should get
 
 
c1 = 2, c2 = 3, and c3 = 4
  Of course, you can also take advantage 
of math.cowpi.com/systemsolver. 
Just click the 3 × 3 link and input the 
equations to solve the system.
11.  So the solution of the differential equa-
tion with the initial conditions applied is
 
 
y = 2ex + 3e2x + 4e3x

A Cause for Complexity: Handling 
Complex Roots
What if a differential equation’s characteristic equation has roots that are complex 
(meaning they involve the imaginary number i), such as
r1 = i and r2 = –i
You can handle such a case with these two relationships:
e(α + iβ)x = eαx(cos βx + i sin βx)
and
e(α + iβ)x = eαx(cos βx – i sin βx)
Spend a few minutes reviewing the following example of how to solve this type of equation, 
or if you’re feeling up to it, take advantage of the opportunity to work through some prac-
tice problems that feature linear higher order differential equations with complex roots.

134
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
 Q. 
Find the solution to this differential 
equation:
  
  
y(4) – y = 0
  
  
where
  
  
y(0) = 3
  
  
y'(0) = 1
  
  
y"(0) = –1
  
  
y'''(0) = –3
 A. 
y = e–x + 2 cos x + 2 sin x
1. You know that this differential equa-
tion has constant coefficients, so go 
ahead and assume a solution of the 
form
 
 
y = erx
2. Plug your solution into the differential 
equation to get
 
 
r 4erx – erx = 0
3. Then cancel out erx:
 
 
r 4 – 1 = 0
4. You can factor the resulting character-
istic equation into
 
 
(r 2 – 1)(r 2 + 1) = 0
5. So the roots of the characteristic 
equation are
 
 
r1 = 1, r2 = –1, r3 = i, and r4 = –i
6. Use these relationships to make the 
solution easier to find:
 
 
eiβx = cos βx + i sin βx
  and
 
 
e–iβx = cos βx – i sin βx
7. Okay, so you’ve determined that y3 and 
y4 can be expressed as a linear combi-
nation of sines and cosines (note that 
you can absorb the i into a multiplica-
tive constant). That means you have 
these solutions:
 
 
y1 = ex
 
 
y2 = e–x
 
 
y3 = cos x
 
 
y4 = sin x
8. So the general solution is
 
 
y = c1ex + c2e–x + c3 cos x + c4 sin x
9. To apply the initial conditions, you 
need to figure out y':
 
 
y' = c1ex – c2e–x – c3 sin x + c4 cos x
  and y":
 
 
y" = c1ex + c2e–x – c3 cos x – c4 sin x
  as well as y''':
 
 
y''' = c1ex – c2e–x + c3 sin x – c4 cos x
10.  Substituting the forms for y, y', y", and 
y''' into the initial conditions gives you
 
 
y(0) = c1 + c2 + c3 = 3
 
 
y'(0) = c1 – c2 + c4 = 1
 
 
y"(0) = c1 + c2 – c3 = –1
 
 
y'''(0) = c1 – c2 – c4 = –3
11.  Solve this 4 × 4 simultaneous equation 
system by hand or with an online tool 
such as the 4 × 4 system solver at 
math.cowpi.com/systemsolver:
 
 
c1 = 0, c2 = 1, c3 = 2, and c4 = 2
12.  After all that, the general solution with 
initial conditions applied is
 
 
y = e–x + 2 cos x + 2 sin x

Identity Issues: Solving Equations When 
Identical Roots Are Involved
Identical roots are a no-brainer to spot, but they can be a bit messy to solve if you don’t 
know what you’re doing. Why? Well, if you have a differential equation whose characteristic 
equation has the roots –2, –2, –2, and –2, then those four –2s are an issue, because you can’t 
just say the solutions are
y1 = e–2x
y2 = e–2x
y3 = e–2x
y4 = e–2x

136
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
Using all of these solutions would give you a general solution like
y = c1e–2x + c2e–2x +c3e–2x +c4e–2x
which is really equivalent to the following if you combine the constants:
y = ce–2x
where c = c1 + c2 +c3 + c4.
You can handle such scenarios by adding powers of x. For example, if y1 equals c1e–2x, then 
you get
y2 = c2xe–2x
y3 = c3x2e–2x
y4 = c4x3e–2x
for the rest. So the general solution is
y = c1e–2x + c2xe–2x +c3x2e–2x +c4x3e–2x
Take a look at this example to see another linear higher order differential equation with 
identical roots being worked out and then try a few equations yourself.
 Q. 
Find the solution to this differential 
equation:
  
  
y(4) + 4y''' + 6y" + 4y' + y = 0
 A. 
y = c1e–x + c2xe–x +c3x2e–x +c4x3e–x
1. Here you have a fourth order differen-
tial equation with constant coeffi-
cients, so try a solution of the form
 
 y = erx
2. Plug your attempted solution into the 
differential equation:
 
 r4erx + 4r3erx + 6r2erx + 4rerx + erx = 0
3. Then divide by erx to get the character-
istic equation:
 
 r4 + 4r3 + 6r2 + 4r + 1 = 0
4. Factor the characteristic equation as 
follows, either by hand or by using the 
equation-solving tool at www.quick
math.com (see the chapter intro for 
specifics on accessing this tool):
 
 (r + 1)(r + 1)(r + 1)(r + 1)
5. The roots of the characteristic equa-
tion are –1, –1, –1, –1 — all repeated 
roots. Because the resulting solutions 
are all the same, these are all degener-
ate solutions:
 
 y1 = e–x
 
 y2 = e–x
 
 y3 = e–x
 
 y4 = e–x
6. Multiply the degenerate solutions by 
ascending powers of x to get
 
 y1 = c1e–x
 
 y2 = c2xe–x
 
 y3 = c3x2e–x
 
 y4 = c4x3e–x
7. Put all four individual solutions 
together so that the general solution 
looks like
 
 y = c1e–x + c2xe–x +c3x2e–x +c4x3e–x

Answers to Homogeneous Linear Higher 
Order Differential Equation Problems
Here are the answers to the practice questions I provide throughout this chapter. 
I walk you through each answer so you can see the problems worked out step by 
step. Enjoy!
a  Find the solution to the following differential equation:
 
  
y''' + 7y" + 14y' + 8y = 0
 
  
with these initial conditions:
 
  
y(0) = 3
 
  
y'(0) = –7
 
  
y"(0) = 14
 
 Solution: 
 1. Because this differential equation has constant coefficients, start by assuming a solution of 
the following form:
 
  y = erx
 2. Plug your attempted solution into the differential equation:
 
  r 3erx + 7r 2erx + 14rerx + 8erx = 0
 3. Then cancel out erx:
 
  r 3 + 7r 2 + 14r + 8 = 0
 4. Now you have a cubic equation, which you can factor into the following either by hand or by 
using the equation-solving tool at www.quickmath.com (see the chapter intro for specifics 
on accessing this tool):
 
  (r + 1)(r + 2)(r + 4) = 0
 5. So the roots are

  y3 = e–3x
 5. Multiply the degenerate solutions by ascending powers of x:
 
  y1 = c1e–x
 
  y2 = c2xe–x
 
  y3 = c3e–3x
 6. Finally, put the individual solutions together to form this general solution:
 
  y = c1e–x + c2xe–x + c3e–3x

Taking On Nonhomogeneous Linear 
Higher Order Differential Equations
In This Chapter
▶ Finding answers with the help of Aerx
▶ Working with polynomial differential equations
▶ Knowing what to do when you see sines and cosines
I
n this chapter, you work with general nonhomogeneous linear higher order differential 
equations (which are sometimes referred to as nth order equations) that look like this:
 
Such an equation may seem complex, but you can easily solve it by using the method of 
undetermined coefficients for nonhomogeneous higher order differential equations.
 
The method of undetermined coefficients says that if g(x) has a certain form, then you must 
attempt to find a particular solution of a similar form. After you find the particular solu-
tion, you must solve for the general solution, which is the sum of the homogeneous solution 
(which you find by setting g(x) to 0) and the particular solution.
The various forms of g(x) give you a clue as to what the form of the particular solution may 
be. If g(x) equals
 
✓ erx, then try a particular solution of the form Aerx, where A is a constant. Because 
derivatives of erx reproduce erx, you have a good chance of finding a particular 
solution this way.
 
✓ a polynomial of order n, then try a polynomial of order n.
 
✓ a combination of sines and cosines, sin αx + cos βx, then try a combination of sines 
and cosines with undetermined coefficients (A sin βx + B cos βx), plug into the differen-
tial equation, and solve for A and B.
In this chapter, you practice working with each of these forms.
 
As you solve the practice problems throughout this chapter, you may need help factoring the 
characteristic equations that crop up in the process of finding the homogeneous solution. 
I recommend turning to a trusty Web-based equation solver, such as www.numberempire.

Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
Seeking Out Solutions of the Form Aerx
 
Solving for a solution in the form of Aerx is what you should try first when you want to find 
a solution to the homogeneous version of a nonhomogeneous linear higher order equation, 
like this one:
y''' + 3y" + 3y' + y = 432e5x
You know that the general solution of this equation is the sum of the particular solution and 
the homogeneous solution. You also know that in variable-speak, the general solution looks 
like this:
y = yh + yp
Perfect. So now you need to get the homogeneous version of the previous differential 
equation, which is
y''' + 3y" + 3y' + y = 0
Solve the homogeneous equation first; then plug in a particular solution of the form
yp = Ae5x
All that’s left to do is solve for A!
That was just a quick outline of the process; the following example walks you through the 
steps of solving the previous equation from start to finish. Check it out and then take a shot 
at solving the related practice problems.
 Q. 
Find the solution to this differential 
equation:
  
  
y''' + 3y" + 3y' + y = 432e5x
 A. 
y = c1e–x + c2xe–x + c3x2e–x + 2e5x
1. Start by realizing that obtaining the 
general solution to the problem means 
finding the sum of the particular solu-
tion and the solution to the homo-
geneous version of the differential 
equation:
 
 y = yh + yp
2. Then find the homogeneous version of 
the differential equation:
 
 y''' + 3y" + 3y' + y = 0
3. The homogeneous version has con-
stant coefficients, so you can assume a 
homogeneous solution of the form
 
 y = erx
4. Plugging your attempted solution into 
the differential equation gives you
 
 r 3erx + 3r 2erx + 3rerx + erx = 0
5. Canceling out erx leaves you with
 
 r 3 + 3r 2 + 3r + 1 = 0
6. Now you have a cubic equation, which 
you can factor into the following either 
by hand or by using the equation-
solving tool at www.numberempire.
com/equationsolver.php:
 
 (r + 1)(r + 1)(r + 1) = 0

155
 Chapter 7: Taking On Nonhomogeneous Linear Higher Order Differential Equations
 1. 
What’s the solution to this differential 
equation?
  
  
y''' – 6y" + 11y' – 6y = 18e4x
 Solve It
 2. 
Solve the following equation:
  
  
y''' + 7y" + 14y' + 8y = 378e5x
 Solve It
7. So the roots of the characteristic 
equation are
 
 r1 = –1, r2 = –1, and r3 = –1
  which gives you
 
 y1 = c1e–x
 
 y2 = c2xe–x
 
 y3 = c3x2e–x
8. So the solution to the homogeneous 
differential equation is
 
 yh = c1e–x + c2xe–x + c3x2e–x
9. Now you need to find a particular 
solution to the differential equation 
by using the method of undetermined 
coefficients. Start by assuming a 
solution of the form
 
 yp = Ae5x
10.  Substitute yp into the differential 
equation to get
 
 125Ae5x + 75Ae5x + 15Ae5x + Ae5x = 
432e5x
11. Then cancel out e5x:
 
 125A + 75A + 15A + A = 432
  which is actually
 
 216A = 432
  so
 
 A = 2
  and the particular solution is
 
 yp = 2e5x
12.  Add the homogeneous solution and 
the particular solution together to find 
that the general solution to the original 
differential equation is
 
 y = c1e–x + c2xe–x + c3x2e–x + 2e5x

 Chapter 7: Taking On Nonhomogeneous Linear Higher Order Differential Equations
Trying for a Solution in Polynomial Form
Whenever you come across a linear higher order differential equation that’s nonhomo-
geneous and in polynomial form, forget the other tricks to the method of undetermined 
coefficients and try for a polynomial of order n.
With that in mind, how would you handle this equation?
y''' + 3y" + 3y' + y = x + 5
Obviously the general solution you need to find is the sum of the homogeneous solution 
and a particular solution. The formula for that looks like this:
y = yh + yp
The homogeneous version of the original differential equation is
y''' + 3y" + 3y' + y = 0
Okay. Now what? Well, first you must solve this homogeneous equation and then plug in a 
particular solution of the form
yp = Ax4 + Bx3 + Cx2 + Dx + E
and solve for A, B, C, D, and E. Nothing to it, right? For the step-by-step process, take a look 
at the following example. Or if you think you have the hang of it from this general overview, 
skip ahead to the following two practice problems.
Q. 
What’s the solution to this differential 
equation?
  
  
y''' + 3y" + 3y' + y = x + 5
 A. 
y = c1e–x + c2xe–x + c3x2e–x + x + 2
1. First things first: Make sure you’re 
looking for the sum of the particular 
solution and the solution to the homo-
geneous version of the differential 
equation:
 
 y = yh + yp
2. Now you can find the homogeneous 
version of the equation in the 
question:
 
 y''' + 3y" + 3y' + y = 0
3. Because the homogeneous differential 
equation has constant coefficients, go 
ahead and assume a homogeneous 
solution of the form
 
 y = erx
4. Plug your attempted solution into the 
equation:
 
 r 3erx + 3r 2erx + 3rerx + erx = 0
5. Then cancel out erx:
 
 r 3 + 3r 2 + 3r + 1 = 0
6. The resulting equation is a cubic one 
that you can factor as follows either by 
hand or by using the equation-solving 
tool found at www.numberempire.
com/equationsolver.php:
 
 (r + 1)(r + 1)(r + 1) = 0

158
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
7. This equation’s roots are
 
 r1 = –1, r2 = –1, and r3 = –1
  so
 
 y1 = c1e–x
 
 y2 = c2xe–x
 
 y3 = c3x2e–x
8. Tada! The solution to the homoge-
neous differential equation is
 
 yh = c1e–x + c2xe–x + c3x2e–x
9. To find a particular solution to the dif-
ferential equation, assume a solution 
of the form
 
 yp = Ax4 + Bx3 + Cx2 + Dx + E
10. First, find yp''':
 
 yp''' = 24Ax + 6B
11. Then find 3yp":
 
 3yp" = 36Ax2 + 18Bx + 6C
12. Next, find 3yp':
 
 3yp' = 12Ax3 + 9Bx2 + 6Cx + 3D
13. Finally, find yp:
 
 yp = Ax4 + Bx3 + Cx2 + Dx + E
14.  Add together the results of Steps 10 
through 13:
 
 y''' + 3y" + 3y' + y = 24Ax + 6B + 
36Ax2 + 18Bx + 6C + 12Ax3 + 9Bx2 + 
6Cx + 3D + Ax4 + Bx3 + Cx2 + Dx + E 
= x + 5
15.  That’s a lot of terms to mess with. Why 
not combine them to get
 
 Ax4 + (12A + B)x3 + (36A + 9B + C)
x2 + (24A + 18B + 6C + D)x + (6B + 
6C + 3D + E) = x + 5
16.  Comparing the coefficient of x4 gives 
you
 
 A = 0
17.  Similarly, comparing the coefficient of 
x3 gives you
 
 12A + B = 0
  so
 
 B = 0
18.  Amazingly enough, comparing the 
coefficient of x2 gives you
 
 36A + 9B + C = 0
  so
 
 C = 0
19.  And comparing the coefficient of x 
gives you
 
 24A + 18B + 6C + D = 1
  so
 
 D = 1
20.  Finally, comparing the coefficient of 
the constant term gives you
 
 6B + 6C + 3D + E = 5
  so
 
 E = 2
21.  After all that work, you now have your 
particular solution, which is
 
 yp = x + 2
22.  Add that solution to the homogeneous 
solution and you get this as your gen-
eral solution:
 
 y = c1e–x + c2xe–x + c3x2e–x + x + 2

Find the solution to the following differen-
tial equation:

y''' + 4y" + 5y' + 2y = 4x + 16

Working with Solutions Made Up of 
Sines and Cosines
Spotting a sine or cosine in a nonhomogeneous linear higher order differential equation 
you’re facing is a surefire sign that you need to find a particular solution that includes sines 
and cosines so you can plug it into the equation and solve for A and B.
Say you’re tackling this differential equation:
y''' + 7y" + 14y' + 8y = 5 sin (x)
You’re well aware that the general solution is of this form:
y = yh + yp
where yh equals the homogeneous solution and yp equals the particular solution.
The homogeneous version of your original equation is
y''' + 7y" + 14y' + 8y = 0

160
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
What you need to do next is solve this homogeneous equation first and then plug in a 
particular solution of the form
yp = A sin (x) + B cos (x)
so you can solve for A and B.
The following example shows you how to solve this type of equation. Spend a few minutes 
reviewing it before trying out a couple practice problems on your own.
 Q. 
Find the solution to this differential 
equation:
  
  
y''' + 7y" + 14y' + 8y = 2 sin (x) + 
  
26 cos (x)
 A. 
y = c1e–x + c2e–2x + c3e–4x + 2 sin (x)
1. You already know that the general 
solution looks like this:
 
 y = yh + yp
  so start by finding the homogeneous 
version of the differential equation:
 
 y''' + 7y" + 14y' + 8y = 0
2. You can assume a homogeneous solu-
tion of the following form because the 
homogeneous version of the equation 
has constant coefficients:
 
 y = erx
3. Plug in your attempted solution to get
 
 r 3erx + 7r 2erx + 14rerx + 8erx = 0
4. Then cancel out erx:
 
 r 3 + 7r 2 + 14r + 8 = 0
5. Looks like you now have a cubic equa-
tion on your hands. Don’t worry. This 
one isn’t as scary as it may look. 
Simply factor it as follows (either by 
hand or with the help of the equation-
solving tool at www.numberempire.
com/equationsolver.php):
 
 (r + 1)(r + 2)(r + 4) = 0
6. Doing so shows you that the roots are
 
 r1 = –1, r2 = –2, and r3 = –4
  so
 
 y1 = e–x
 
 y2 = e–2x
 
 y3 = e–4x
7. Thus, your homogeneous solution is
 
 yh = c1e–x + c2e–2x + c3e–4x
8. Now you need to find a particular solu-
tion. Start that process by assuming a 
solution of this form:
 
 yp = A sin (x) + B cos (x)
9. Find the following:
 
 yp'''
  which is
 
 yp''' = –A cos (x) + B sin (x)
  then
 
 7yp"
  which is
 
 7yp" = –7A sin (x) – 7B cos (x)
  then
 
 14yp'
  which is
 
 14yp' = 14A cos (x) – 14B sin (x)
  and finally
 
 8yp

161
 Chapter 7: Taking On Nonhomogeneous Linear Higher Order Differential Equations
 9. 
Solve the following differential equation:
  
  
y''' + 10y" + 31y' + 30y = 20 sin (x) + 
  
30 cos (x)
 Solve It
 10. What’s the answer to this equation?
  
  
y''' + 11y" + 36y' + 36y = 75 sin (x) + 
  
105 cos (x)
 Solve It
  which is
 
 8yp = 8A sin (x) + 8B cos (x)
10.  Adding everything together gives 
you:
 
 y''' + 7y" + 14y' + 8y = –A cos (x) + 
B sin (x) –7A sin (x) – 7B cos (x) + 
14A cos (x) – 14B sin (x) + 8A sin 
(x) + 8B cos (x) = 5 sin (x)
11.  To get rid of some of the mess, go 
ahead and combine terms:
 
 (B –7A –14B + 8A) sin (x) + (–A 
–7B + 14A + 8B) cos (x) = 5 sin (x)
12.  Combining terms further gives you
 
 (–13B + A) sin (x) + (13A + B) cos 
(x) = 2 sin (x) + 26 cos (x)
13. When you solve for A, you get
 
 A = 2
  and when you solve for B, you get
 
 B = 0
  so the particular solution is
 
 yp = 2 sin (x)
14.  Only one thing left to do: Add the par-
ticular solution to the homogeneous 
solution to get
 
 y = c1e–x + c2e–2x + c3e–4x + 2 sin (x)

Answers to Nonhomogeneous Linear Higher 
Order Differential Equation Problems
Following are the answers to the practice questions presented throughout this chapter. 
Each one is worked out step by step so that if you messed one up along the way, you 
can more easily see where you took a wrong turn.
a  What’s the solution to this differential equation?
 
  
y''' – 6y" + 11y' – 6y = 18e4x
 
 Solution: y = c1ex + c2e2x + c3e3x + 3e4x
 1. First off, get the homogeneous version of the equation:
 
  y''' – 6y" + 11y' – 6y = 0
 2. Looks like the homogeneous version has constant coefficients, so go ahead and assume a 
homogeneous solution of the form
 
  y = erx
 3. Plug your attempted solution into the differential equation:
 
  r 3erx – 6r 2erx + 11rerx – 6erx = 0
 4. Cancel out erx:
 
  r 3 – 6r 2 + 11r – 6 = 0
 5. Now you have a cubic equation that can be factored into
 
  (r – 1)(r – 2)(r – 3) = 0
 
 Note: For some help factoring cubic (or higher!) equations, you can always turn to www.
numberempire.com/equationsolver.php.
 6. So the roots are
 
  r1 = 1, r2 = 2, and r3 = 3
 7. Hmmm. Those roots are real and distinct, which makes the solutions
 
  y1 = ex
 
  y2 = e2x
 
  y3 = e3x
 8. Therefore, you can calculate that the homogeneous solution is
 
  yh = c1ex + c2e2x + c3e3x
 9. Well done. Now you need to assume a solution of the following form in order to find your 
particular solution:
 
  yp = Ae4x
 10. Substitute yp into the differential equation to get
 
  64Ae4x – 96Ae4x + 44Ae4x – 6Ae4x = 18e4x

163
 Chapter 7: Taking On Nonhomogeneous Linear Higher Order Differential Equations
 11. Canceling out e4x gives you
 
  6A = 18
 
 which is actually
 
  A = 3
 12. The particular solution is therefore
 
  yp = 3e4x
 13. Add the particular solution to the homogeneous solution to get your general solution of
 
  y = c1ex + c2e2x + c3e3x + 3e4x
b  Solve the following equation:
 
  
y''' + 7y" + 14y' + 8y = 378e5x
 
 Solution: y = c1e–x + c2e–2x + c3e–4x + e5x
 1. Find the homogeneous version of the differential equation:
 
  y''' + 7y" + 14y' + 8y = 0
 2. Because the homogeneous version has constant coefficients, you can try a solution of 
the form
 
  y = erx
 3. Plugging your attempted solution into the differential equation gives you
 
  r 3erx + 7r 2erx + 14rerx + 8erx = 0
 4. Canceling out erx leaves you with
 
  r 3 + 7r 2 + 14r + 8 = 0
 5. Factor the resulting cubic equation as follows:
 
  (r + 1)(r + 2)(r + 4) = 0
 6. You now know that the roots are
 
  r1 = –1, r2 = –2, and r3 = –4
 7. The roots are real and distinct, so the solutions are
 
  y1 = e–x
 
  y2 = e–2x
 
  y3 = e–4x
 8. Thus, the homogeneous solution must be
 
  yh = c1e–x + c2e–2x + c3e–4x
 9. You still need to find a particular solution, so assume a solution of the form
 
  yp = Ae5x
 10. Substituting yp into the differential equation gives you
 
  125Ae5x + 175Ae5x + 70Ae5x + 8Ae5x = 378e5x

164
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
 11. Canceling out e5x leaves you with the following:
 
  125A + 175A + 70A + 8A = 378
 
 or
 
  378A = 378
 
 which means
 
  A = 1
 12. So the particular solution is
 
  yp = e5x
 13. To get the general solution you’re looking for, simply add together the homogeneous solution 
and the particular solution:
 
  y = c1e–x + c2e–2x + c3e–4x + e5x
c  Find the answer to this equation:
 
  
y''' + 8y" + 19y' + 14y = –36e–5x
 
 Solution: y = c1e–x + c2e–3x + c3e–4x + 6e–5x
 1. First off, get the homogeneous version of the equation:
 
  y''' + 8y" + 19y' + 14y = 0
 2. Looks like the homogeneous version has constant coefficients, so go ahead and assume a 
solution of the form
 
  y = erx
 3. Plug your attempted solution into the differential equation:
 
  r 3erx + 8r 2erx + 19rerx + 14erx = 0
 4. Cancel out erx:
 
  r 3 + 8r 2 + 19r + 14 = 0
 5. Now you have a cubic equation that can be factored into
 
  (r + 1)(r + 3)(r + 4) = 0
 6. So the roots are
 
  r1 = –1, r2 = –3, and r3 = –4
 7. Hmmm. Those roots are real and distinct, which makes the solutions
 
  y1 = e–x
 
  y2 = e–3x
 
  y3 = e–4x
 8. Therefore, you can calculate that the homogeneous solution is
 
  yh = c1e–x + c2e–3x + c3e–4x
 9. Well done. Now you need to assume a solution of the following form in order to find your 
particular solution:
 
  yp = Ae–5x

165
 Chapter 7: Taking On Nonhomogeneous Linear Higher Order Differential Equations
 10. Substitute yp into the differential equation to get
 
  –125Ae–5x + 200Ae–5x – 95Ae–5x + 14Ae–5x = –36e–5x
 11. Canceling out e–5x gives you
 
  –125A + 200A – 95A + 14A = –36
 
 which is actually
 
  –6A = –36
 
 so
 
  A = 6
 12. The particular solution is therefore
 
  yp = 6e–5x
 13. Add the particular solution to the homogeneous solution to get your general solution of
 
  y = c1e–x + c2e–3x + c3e–4x + 6e–5x
d  What’s the solution to this differential equation?
 
  
y''' + 9y" + 26y' + 24y = 12e–x
 
 Solution: y = c1e–2x + c2e–3x + c3e–4x + 2e–x
 1. Find the homogeneous version of the differential equation:
 
  y''' + 9y" + 26y' + 24y = 0
 2. Because the homogeneous version has constant coefficients, you can try a solution of 
the form
 
  y = erx
 3. Plugging your attempted solution into the differential equation gives you
 
  r 3erx + 9r 2erx + 26rerx + 24erx = 0
 4. Canceling out erx leaves you with
 
  r 3 + 9r 2 + 26r + 24 = 0
 5. Factor the resulting cubic equation as follows:
 
  (r + 2)(r + 3)(r + 4) = 0
 6. You now know that the roots are
 
  r1 = –2, r2 = –3, and r3 = –4
 7. The roots are real and distinct, so the solutions are
 
  y1 = e–2x
 
  y2 = e–3x
 
  y3 = e–4x
 8. Thus, the homogeneous solution must be
 
  yh = c1e–2x + c2e–3x + c3e–4x
 9. You still need to find a particular solution, so assume a solution of the form
 
  yp = Ae–x

166
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
 10. Substituting yp into the differential equation gives you
 
  –Ae–x + 9Ae–x – 26Ae–x + 24Ae–x = 12e–x
 11. Canceling out e–x leaves you with the following:
 
  –A + 9A – 26A + 24A = 12
 
 or
 
  6A = 12
 
 which means
 
  A = 2
 12. So the particular solution is
 
  yp = 2e–x
 13. To get the general solution you’re looking for, simply add together the homogeneous solution 
and the particular solution:
 
  y = c1e–2x + c2e–3x + c3e–4x + 2e–x
e  Solve the following equation:
 
  
y''' – 6y" + 11y' – 6y = 48e5x
 
 Solution: y = c1ex + c2e2x + c3e3x + 2e5x
 1. First off, get the homogeneous version of the equation:
 
  y''' – 6y" + 11y' – 6y = 0
 2. Looks like the homogeneous version has constant coefficients, so go ahead and assume a 
homogeneous solution of the form
 
  y = erx
 3. Plug your attempted solution into the differential equation:
 
  r 3erx – 6r 2erx + 11rerx – 6erx = 0
 4. Cancel out erx:
 
  r 3 – 6r 2 + 11r – 6 = 0
 5. Now you have a cubic equation that can be factored into
 
  (r – 1)(r – 2)(r – 3) = 0
 6. So the roots are
 
  r1 = 1, r2 = 2, and r3 = 3
 7. Hmmm. Those roots are real and distinct, which makes the solutions
 
  y1 = ex
 
  y2 = e2x
 
  y3 = e3x
 8. Therefore, you can calculate that the homogeneous solution is
 
  yh = c1ex + c2e2x + c3e3x

167
 Chapter 7: Taking On Nonhomogeneous Linear Higher Order Differential Equations
 9. Well done. Now you need to assume a solution of the following form in order to find your 
particular solution:
 
  yp = Ae5x
 10. Substitute yp into the differential equation to get
 
  125Ae5x – 150Ae5x + 55Ae5x – 6Ae5x = 48e5x
 11. Canceling out e5x gives you
 
  24A = 48
 
 which is actually
 
  A = 2
 12. The particular solution is therefore
 
  yp = 2e5x
 13. Add the particular solution to the homogeneous solution to get your general solution of
 
  y = c1ex + c2e2x + c3e3x + 2e5x
f  Find the answer to this equation:
 
  
y''' + 4y" + 5y' + 2y = 68e–3x
 
 Solution: y = c1e–x + c2xe–x + c3e–2x – 17e–3x
 1. Find the homogeneous version of the differential equation:
 
  y''' + 4y" + 5y' + 2y = 0
 2. Because the homogeneous version has constant coefficients, you can try a solution of 
the form
 
  y = erx
 3. Plugging your attempted solution into the differential equation gives you
 
  r 3erx + 4r 2erx + 5rerx + 2erx = 0
 4. Dividing by erx to get the characteristic equation leaves you with
 
  r 3 + 4r 2 + 5r + 2 = 0
 5. Factor the characteristic equation as follows:
 
  (r + 1)(r + 1)(r + 2)
 6. Notice that two of the roots of the characteristic equation (–1 and –1) are repeated. Does it 
look as if the solutions are
 
  y1 = e–x
 
  y2 = e–x
 
  y3 = e–2x
 
 The first two are clearly degenerate solutions because they’re the same.
 7. Go ahead and multiply the degenerate solutions by ascending powers of x to get
 
  y1 = c1e–x
 
  y2 = c2xe–x
 
  y3 = c3e–2x

168
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
 8. Put the individual solutions together so that the homogeneous solution looks like this:
 
  y = c1e–x + c2xe–x +c3e–2x
 9. You still need to find a particular solution, so assume a solution of the form
 
  yp = Ae–3x
 10. Substituting yp into the differential equation gives you
 
  –27Ae–3x + 36Ae–3x – 15Ae–3x + 2Ae–3x = 68e–3x
 11. Canceling out e–3x leaves you with the following:
 
  –4A = 68
 
 or
 
  A = –17
 12. So the particular solution is
 
  yp = –17e–3x
 13. To get the general solution you’re looking for, simply add together the homogeneous solution 
and the particular solution:
 
  y = c1e–x + c2xe–x + c3e–2x – 17e–3x
g  Find the solution to the following differential equation:
 
  
y''' + 9y" + 26y' + 24y = 24x + 2
 
 Solution: y = c1e–2x + c2e–3x + c3e–4x + x – 1
 1. First things first: Obtain the homogeneous version of the differential equation:
 
  y''' + 9y" + 26y' + 24y = 0
 2. Looks like the homogeneous version has constant coefficients, so you can safely try a 
solution of the following form:
 
  y = erx
 3. Now plug your attempted solution into the equation:
 
  r 3erx + 9r 2erx + 26rerx + 24erx = 0
 4. Then cancel out erx:
 
  r 3 + 9r 2 + 26r + 24 = 0
 5. You now have a cubic equation, which you can factor as follows either by hand or by using 
the equation-solving tool found at www.numberempire.com/equationsolver.php:
 
  (r + 2)(r + 3)(r + 4) = 0
 6. The roots are
 
  r1 = –2, r2 = –3, and r3 = –4
 
 so
 
  y1 = e–2x
 
  y2 = e–3x
 
  y3 = e–4x

169
 Chapter 7: Taking On Nonhomogeneous Linear Higher Order Differential Equations
 
 which makes the homogeneous solution
 
  yh = c1e–2x + c2e–3x + c3e–4x
 7. Now you need to find a particular solution to the differential equation by using the method of 
undetermined coefficients. Because g(x) has the form of a polynomial in the original equation, 
start by assuming a solution of the form
 
  yp = Ax4 + Bx3 + Cx2 + Dx + E
 8. First, find yp''':
 
  yp''' = 24Ax + 6B
 9. Then find 9yp":
 
  9yp" = 108Ax2 + 54Bx + 18C
 10. Next, find 26yp':
 
  26yp' = 104Ax3 + 78Bx2 + 52Cx + 26D
 11. Finally, find 24yp:
 
  24yp = 24Ax4 + 24Bx3 + 24Cx2 + 24Dx + 24E
 12. Add together the results of Steps 8 through 11:
 
  y''' + 9y" + 26y' + 24y = 24Ax + 6B + 108Ax2 + 54Bx + 18C + 104Ax3 + 78Bx2 + 52Cx + 26D + 
 24Ax4 + 24Bx3 + 24Cx2 + 24Dx + 24E = 24x + 2
 13. Looks a wee bit nasty, doesn’t it? Combining terms gives you
 
  24Ax4 + (104A + 24B)x3 + (108A + 78B + 24C)x2 + (24A + 54B + 52C + 24D)x + (6B + 18C + 26D + 
 24E) = 24x + 2
 14. That’s somewhat better. Try comparing the coefficient of x4 to get
 
  A = 0
 15. Then compare the coefficient of x3:
 
  104A + 24B = 0
 
 so
 
  B = 0
 16. While you’re at it, why not compare the coefficient of x2 to get
 
  108A + 78B + 24C = 0
 
 or
 
  C = 0
 17. Then compare the coefficient of x (this is almost the last time you have to compare 
coefficients in this problem, I swear):
 
  24A + 54B + 52C + 24D = 24
 
 so
 
  D = 1
 18. Finally, compare the coefficient of the constant term to get
 
  6B + 18C + 26D + 24E = 2

170
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
 
 or
 
  E = –1
 19. If you put all that together, you can figure out that the particular solution is
 
  yp = x – 1
 20. Take it one step further by adding the homogeneous solution and the particular solution to 
get your general solution of
 
  y = c1e–2x + c2e–3x + c3e–4x + x – 1
h  What’s the solution to this equation?
 
  
y''' + 4y" + 5y' + 2y = 4x + 16
 
 Solution: y = c1e–x + c2xe–x + c3e–2x + 2x + 3
 1. Find the homogeneous version of the equation in question:
 
  y''' + 4y" + 5y' + 2y = 0
 2. Because the homogeneous version is a third order differential equation with constant 
coefficients, assume a solution of the form
 
  y = erx
 3. Plugging your attempted solution into the equation gives you
 
  r 3erx + 4r 2erx + 5rerx + 2erx = 0
 4. Dividing by erx to get the characteristic equation results in this:
 
  r 3 + 4r 2 + 5r + 2 = 0
 5. Go ahead and factor the characteristic equation as
 
  (r + 1)(r + 1)(r + 2)
 6. Two of the roots of the characteristic equation are repeated roots (–1 and –1). Does it look as 
if the solutions are
 
  y1 = e–x
 
  y2 = e–x
 
  y3 = e–2x
 
 The first two solutions are degenerate because they’re the same.
 7. Multiply the degenerate solutions by ascending powers of x to get
 
  y1 = c1e–x
 
  y2 = c2xe–x
 
  y3 = c3e–2x
 8. Then put the individual solutions together to form the following homogeneous solution:
 
  y = c1e–x + c2xe–x +c3e–2x
 9. You’re halfway there now. The next step is to find a particular solution, which you can do by 
assuming a solution of the form
 
  yp = Ax4 + Bx3 + Cx2 + Dx + E

171
 Chapter 7: Taking On Nonhomogeneous Linear Higher Order Differential Equations
 10. Find the following:
 
  yp'''
 
 which is
 
  yp''' = 24Ax + 6B
 
 then
 
  4yp"
 
 which is
 
  4yp" = 48Ax2 + 34Bx + 8C
 
 then
 
  5yp'
 
 which is
 
  5yp' = 20Ax3 + 15Bx2 + 10Cx + 5D
 
 and finally
 
  2yp
 
 which is
 
  2yp = 2Ax4 + 2Bx3 + 2Cx2 + 2Dx + 2E
 11. Add everything in Step 10 together:
 
  y''' + 4y" + 5y' + 2y = 24Ax + 6B + 48Ax2 + 34Bx + 8C + 20Ax3 + 15Bx2 + 10Cx + 5D + 2Ax4 + 2Bx3 + 
 2Cx2 + 2Dx + 2E = 4x + 16
 12. If that’s a little messy for your taste, combine like terms:
 
  2Ax4 + (20A + 2B)x3 + (48A + 15B + 2C)x2 + (24A + 34B + 10C + 2D)x + (6B + 8C + 5D + 2E) = 
 4x + 16
 13. Now you can begin comparing coefficients, starting with the coefficient of x4, which gives you
 
  A = 0
 14. Next up, compare the coefficient of x3 to get
 
  20A + 2B = 0
 
 so
 
  B = 0
 15. Then compare the coefficient of x2:
 
  48A + 15B + 2C = 0
 
 which means that
 
  C = 0
 16. Comparing the coefficient of x gives you
 
  24A + 34B + 10C + 2D = 4
 
 so
 
  D = 2

172
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
 17. Last but not least, compare the coefficient of the constant term to get
 
  6B + 8C + 5D + 2E = 16
 
 which means that
 
  E = 3
 18. Thanks to all that work, you now know that the particular solution is
 
  yp = 2x + 3
 19. Bring it home by finding the sum of the homogeneous solution and the particular solution 
(which gives you the general solution you were looking for to begin with!):
 
  y = c1e–x + c2xe–x + c3e–2x + 2x + 3
i  Solve the following differential equation:
 
  
y''' + 10y" + 31y' + 30y = 20 sin (x) + 30 cos (x)
 
 Solution: y = c1e–2x + c2e–3x + c3e–5x + sin (x)
 1. Your first step is to get the homogeneous version of the differential equation:
 
  y''' + 10y" + 31y' + 30y = 0
 2. Try a solution of the following form because the homogeneous version of the equation has 
constant coefficients:
 
  y = erx
 3. Plug your attempted solution into the equation:
 
  r 3erx + 10r 2erx + 31rerx + 30erx = 0
 4. Then cancel out erx to get
 
  r 3 + 10r 2 + 31r + 30 = 0
 5. Factor the resulting cubic equation this way, either by hand or with the help of the equation-
solving tool at www.numberempire.com/equationsolver.php:
 
  (r + 2)(r + 3)(r + 5) = 0
 6. Looks like the roots are
 
  r1 = –2, r2 = –3, and r3 = –5
 
 so
 
  y1 = e–2x
 
  y2 = e–3x
 
  y3 = e–5x
 7. Thus, the homogeneous solution is
 
  yh = c1e–2x + c2e–3x + c3e–5x
 8. Well done. Now you need to assume a solution of the following form in order to find your 
particular solution:
 
  yp = A sin (x) + B cos (x)
 9. First, find yp''':
 
  yp''' = –A cos (x) + B sin (x)

173
 Chapter 7: Taking On Nonhomogeneous Linear Higher Order Differential Equations
 10. Then find 10yp":
 
  10yp" = –10A sin (x) – 10B cos (x)
 11. Next, find 31yp':
 
  31yp' = 31A cos (x) – 31B sin (x)
 12. Finally, find 30yp:
 
  30yp = 30A sin (x) + 30B cos (x)
 13. Add together the results from Steps 9 through 12:
 
  y''' + 10y" + 31y' + 30y = –A cos (x) + B sin (x) –10A sin (x) – 10B cos (x) + 31A cos (x) – 31B 
 sin (x) + 30A sin (x) + 30B cos (x) = 20 sin (x) + 30 cos (x)
 14. Messy, huh? Combine like terms to clean things up a bit:
 
  (B – 10A – 31B + 30A) sin (x) + (–A – 10B + 31A + 30B) cos (x) = 20 sin (x) + 30 cos (x)
 15. Go ahead and combine terms once more:
 
  (–30B + 20A) sin (x) + (30A + 20B) cos (x) = 20 sin (x) + 30 cos (x)
 16. Time to start solving! Solving for A gives you
 
  A = 1
 
 and solving for B gives you
 
  B = 0
 17. So the particular solution is
 
  yp = sin (x)
 18. All that’s left to do is add the particular solution and the homogeneous solution together to 
get your general solution of
 
  y = c1e–2x + c2e–3x + c3e–5x + sin (x)
j  What’s the answer to this equation?
 
  
y''' + 11y" + 36y' + 36y = 75 sin (x) + 105 cos (x)
 
 Solution: y = c1e–2x + c2e–3x + c3e–6x + 3 sin (x)
 1. Find the homogeneous version of the differential equation:
 
  y''' + 11y" + 36y' + 36y = 0
 2. Because the homogeneous version has constant coefficients, you can safely assume a 
solution of this form:
 
  y = erx
 3. Plugging your attempted solution into the equation gives you
 
  r 3erx + 11r 2erx + 36rerx + 36erx = 0
 4. Canceling out erx leaves you with
 
  r 3 + 11r 2 + 36r + 36 = 0
 5. The next step is to factor that cubic equation as follows:
 
  (r + 2)(r + 3)(r + 6) = 0

174
Part II: Finding Solutions to Second and Higher Order Differential Equations 
 6. The roots are
 
  r1 = –2, r2 = –3, and r3 = –6
 
 which means
 
  y1 = e–2x
 
  y2 = e–3x
 
  y3 = e–6x
 7. Tada! Your homogeneous solution is
 
  yh = c1e–2x + c2e–3x + c3e–6x
 8. You still need to find a particular solution though; go ahead and assume a solution of 
the form
 
  yp = A sin (x) + B cos (x)
 9. First, find yp''':
 
  yp''' = –A cos (x) + B sin (x)
 10. Then find 11yp":
 
  11yp" = –11A sin (x) – 11B cos (x)
 11. Next, find 36yp':
 
  36yp' = 36A cos (x) – 36B sin (x)
 12. Finally, find 36yp:
 
  36yp = 36A sin (x) + 36B cos (x)
 13. Add together what you found in Steps 9 through 12:
 
  y''' + 11y" + 36y' + 36y = –A cos (x) + B sin (x) –11A sin (x) – 11B cos (x) + 36A cos (x) – 36B 
 sin (x) + 36A sin (x) + 36B cos (x) = 75 sin (x) + 105 cos (x)
 14. Get rid of that mess by combining terms to get
 
  (B – 11A – 36B + 36A) sin (x) + (–A – 11B + 36A + 36B) cos (x) = 75 sin (x) + 105 cos (x)
 15. That equation still isn’t ideal to work with, so combine terms further:
 
  (–35B + 25A) sin (x) + (35A + 25B) cos (x) = 75 sin (x) + 105 cos (x)
 16. You’re almost done. You just need to solve for A; doing so gives you
 
  A = 3
 
 and for B, which gives you
 
  B = 0
 17. So the particular solution is
 
  yp = 3 sin (x)
 18. For your final act, find the general solution (which is the sum of the homogeneous solution 
and the particular solution):
 
  y = c1e–2x + c2e–3x + c3e–6x + 3 sin (x)

Using Power Series to Solve

In This Chapter
▶ Using the ratio test to see whether a series will converge
▶ Practicing your ability to shift the series index
▶ Applying power series to differential equations to find series solutions
A
 power series is an infinite sum of powers of x, which you can use to solve differential 
equations that can’t be solved in any other way. In this chapter, you practice working 
with power series to solve ordinary differential equations. (Keep in mind that this chapter 
focuses on ordinary differential equations; Chapter 9 deals with differential equations with 
singular points. A singular point is a value [or values] of x where a coefficient in the differen-
tial equation goes to infinity. An ordinary differential equation has no singular points.)
Kick things off by practicing the ratio test and shifting the series index. Then put your skills 
together to solve some equations.
Checking On a Series with the Ratio Test
Power series that become infinite aren’t of much help to anyone, which is why you only 
work with series that stay finite in the following pages. A finite series converges to a 
particular value.
 
A series such as the following:
 
is said to converge for a particular x if this limit:
 
is finite. It this limit is infinite, the series doesn’t converge.

178
Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques 
2. This ratio becomes
 
 
3. So the ratio is |x – 4|, and the series 
converges if that ratio is less than 1. In 
other words, the range in which the 
series converges is |x – 4| < 1.
4. Therefore, if x is in the range 3 < x < 5, 
the series converges.
 Q. 
Does this series converge?
  
  
 A. 
Yes, if 3 < x < 5.
1. Take a look at the ratio of the (n + 1)th 
term to the nth term:
 
 
 
How do you know whether a series converges? Just bust out the ratio test, which compares 
successive terms of a series to see whether the series is going to converge. If the ratio of the 
(n + 1)th term to the nth term is less than 1 for a fixed value of x, the series converges for 
that x.
For example, if you have this series:
 
then the ratio of the (n + 1)th term to the nth term is
 
The series converges if this ratio is less than 1 as n gets larger and larger.
Here’s another example of the ratio test. Take a look and then check out the following prob-
lems to practice using the ratio test to determine whether a particular series converges.

1. You know that the series starts at 
n = 3, so substitute n + 3 for n:
 
 
2. Subtract 3 from both sides of the 
expression to get n = 0:
 
 
 Q. 
Shift this series index to start at n = 0:
  
  
 A. 
Shifting the Series Index
Before you can start solving differential equations by using series, you need to be comfort-
able with a little trick called shifting the series index, which allows you to take two series of 
different indices and make them have the same index so you can compare the two series 
term by term.
In these two series:
 
 
one starts at n = 0, and the other starts at n = 2, which makes comparing the two series term 
by term rather difficult. Say you want both series to start at n = 0. To do that, just replace n 
with n + 2 in the second series, which gives you
 
Note that this series index now starts at n + 2 = 2. You can subtract 2 from both sides of this 
expression, which leaves you with
 
Tada! The second series now starts at n = 0, just like you wanted.
Following are a few practice problems (as well as an additional example) to get you shifting 
the series index like a math whiz.

  The general term here is

  which means you can state y" as
 
 
  Note that this series starts at n = 2, not 
n = 0, as the series for y does.
4. Now that you have y and y", go ahead 
and substitute them into the original 
differential equation for this result:
 
 
  That’s your differential equation in 
series form.
5. To compare these two series, make 
sure they start at the same index 
value, n = 0. Shift the first series (the

2. To find y", start by finding y'. Here’s 
what the terms of the series look like:
 
 y = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + a3x3 + . . .
  If you differentiate that equation term
by term, then y' equals
 
 y' = a1 + 2a2x + 3a3x2 + . . .
  The general nth term here is
 
 nanx n – 1
  so y' equals
 
 
3. You can find y" by differentiating the y' 
equation to get
 
 y" = 2a2 + 6a3x + . . .
Exploiting the Power of Power Series 
to Find Series Solutions
 
Power series are pretty handy for solving ordinary differential equations because you 
can express just about any solution by using one. When tasked with solving an ordinary 
differential equation by using a series solution, arm yourself with these essential 
substitutions:
 
✓ Substitute this series for y: 
 
✓ Substitute this series for y': 
 
✓ Substitute this series for y": 
After making these substitutions in your equation, compare the coefficients of x on each 
side of the equation to solve for the coefficients an in the series terms. (And don’t forget 
to use the initial conditions to solve for the coefficients as well.)
Following is an example of this type of problem with each step worked out. I recommend 
reviewing it before putting your skills to the test solving ordinary differential equations 
with series solutions.

(that is, if n is even), then
 
 
15. Now you need to find the odd coeffi-
cients. Remember that the recurrence 
relation for the solution is
 
 (n + 2)(n + 1)an + 2 + an = 0
  You can see that for n = 1 you get the 
following:
 
 (3)(2)a3 + a1 = 0
  so
 
 
16. Similar to what happened with the 
even coefficients, (3)(2) = 3!, so you 
wind up with
 
 
17. When you try n = 3 in the recurrence 
relation, you get
 
 (5)(4)a5 + a3 = 0
  or
 
 
18. Substituting the equation you found in 
Step 16 for a3 gives you this:
 
 
  or
 
 
7. Next, factor out xn:
 
 
8. Because this series equals 0 and must 
be true for all x, each term must equal 
0. In other words, you get
 
 (n + 2)(n + 1) an + 2 + an = 0
  This equation is called a recurrence 
relation; it relates the coefficients of 
later terms to the coefficients of earlier 
terms. In particular, you can get all the 
coefficients in terms of a0 and a1 
(which are set by the initial 
conditions).
9. First, you must determine the even 
coefficients, which means solving for 
a2 in terms of a0:
 
 (2)(1)a2 + a0 = 0
  so
 
 
10. Now find a4:
 
 (4)(3)a4 + a2 = 0
  so
 
 
11. Because you want the even coefficients 
in terms of a0, substitute the final equa-
tion in Step 9 for a2:
 
 
  Not so fast! Because (4)(3)(2)(1) = 4!, 
you get
 
 
12. For a6, you have
 
 (6)(5)a6 + a4 = 0
  or
 
 
13. Substituting the final equation from 
Step 11 for a4 gives you
 
 

186
Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques 
19. When you substitute n = 5 into the 
recurrence relation, you get
 
 (7)(6)a7 + a5 = 0
  or
 
 
20. Substituting the final equation from 
Step 18 for a5 leaves you with
 
 
  which means that
 
 
21. To summarize Steps 15 through 20, 
you now know that
 
 
 
 
 
 
22. If n = 2m + 1, you can generally relate 
the odd coefficients as follows:
 
 
23. You can now write the whole solution 
as
 
 
24. Surprise! The two series are recogniz-
able as cos (x) and sin (x):
 
 
  and
 
 
25. After all that work, you can write the 
solution as
 
 y = a0 cos (x) + a1 sin (x)

Answers to Solving Ordinary Differential 
Equations with Power Series
Here are the answers to the practice questions I provide throughout this chapter. 
I walk you through each answer so you can see the problems worked out step by 
step. Enjoy!
a  Does this series converge?
 
  
 
 Answer: Yes, if 4 < x < 6.
 1. Take a look at the ratio of the (n + 1)th term to the nth term:
 
  
 2. This ratio becomes

 3. So the ratio is |x – 5|, and the series converges if that ratio is less than 1. In other words, the 
range in which the series converges is |x – 5| < 1.
 4. Therefore, if x is in the range 4 < x < 6, the series converges.
b  State whether this series converges:
 
  
 
 Answer: Yes, if 0 < x < 2.
 1. Check out the ratio of the (n + 1)th term to the nth term:
 
  
 2. This ratio works out to
 
  
 3. As you can see, the ratio is |x – 1|; the series converges if that ratio is less than 1. So the 
range in which the series converges absolutely is |x – 1| < 1.
 4. Thus, if x is in the range 0 < x < 2, the series converges.
c  Does this series converge?
 
  

189
 Chapter 8: Using Power Series to Solve Ordinary Differential Equations
 
 Answer: Yes, if x > 3 or x < 1.
 1. Take a look at the ratio of the (n + 1)th term to the nth term:
 
  
 2. This ratio becomes
 
  
 3. So the ratio is |x – 2|–1, and the series converges if that ratio is less than 1. In other words, 
the range in which the series converges is |x – 2|–1 < 1.
 4. Therefore, if x is in the range x > 3 or x < 1, the series converges.
d  State whether this series converges:
 
  
 
 Answer: Yes, if x > 2 or x < 0.
 1. Check out the ratio of the (n + 1)th term to the nth term:
 
  
 2. This ratio works out to
 
  
 3. As you can see, the ratio is |x – 1|–1; the series converges if that ratio is less than 1. So the 
range in which the series converges absolutely is |x – 1|–1 < 1.
 4. Thus, if x is in the range x > 2 or x < 0, the series converges.
e  Shift the following series index to start at n = 0:
 
  
 
 Solution: 
 1. The series starts at n = 2, so substitute n + 2 for n:
 
  
 2. Subtract 2 from both sides of the expression to get n = 0:
 
  
 
 That’s it! Your work here (on this problem anyway) is done.
f  Make this series start at n = 0 by using the shifting the series index technique:
 
  

190
Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques 
 
 Solution: 
 1. You know that the series begins at n = 2. That fact is your clue to substitute n + 2 for n:
 
  
 2. To set n equal to 0, simply subtract 2 from both sides of the expression:
 
  
g  Shift the following series index to start at n = 0:
 
  
 
 Solution: 
 1. The series starts at n = 2, so substitute n + 2 for n:
 
  
 2. Subtract 2 from both sides of the expression to get n = 0:
 
  
h  Make this series start at n = 0 by using the shifting the series index technique:
 
  
 
 Solution: 
 1. You know that the series begins at n = 3. That fact is your clue to substitute n + 3 for n:
 
  
 2. To set n equal to 0, simply subtract 3 from both sides of the expression:
 
  
i  Solve this differential equation by using a series solution:
 
  
 
 Solution: y = a0 cos (2x) + a1 sin (2x)
 1. Start off with a solution y of the form
 
  
 2. To find y", start by finding y'. Here’s what the terms of the series look like:
 
  y = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + a3x3 + . . .
 
 If you differentiate that equation term by term, then y' equals
 
  y' = a1 + 2a2x + 3a3x2 + . . .
 
 The general nth term here is
 
  nanx n – 1
 
 so y' equals
 
  

191
 Chapter 8: Using Power Series to Solve Ordinary Differential Equations
 3. You can find y" by differentiating the y' equation to get
 
  y" = 2a2 + 6a3x + . . .
 
 The general term here is
 
  n(n – 1)anx n – 2
 
 which means you can state y" as
 
  
 
 Note that this series starts at n = 2, not n = 0, as the series for y does.
 4. Now that you have y and y", go ahead and substitute them into the original differential equa-
tion for this result:
 
  
 
 That’s your differential equation in series form.
 5. To compare these two series, make sure they start at the same index value, n = 0. Shift the 
first series (the one on the left) by replacing n with n + 2 to get
 
  
 6. Then combine the two series:
 
  
 7. Next, factor out xn:
 
  
 8. Because this series equals 0 and must be true for all x, each term must equal 0. In other 
words, you get
 
  (n + 2)(n + 1)an + 2 + 4an = 0
 
 This equation is called a recurrence relation; it relates the coefficients of later terms to the 
coefficients of earlier terms. In particular, you can get all the coefficients in terms of a0 and a1 
(which are set by the initial conditions).
 9. Your first step in relating coefficients is finding all the even coefficients in terms of a0. Start by 
solving for a2 in terms of a0:
 
  (2)(1)a2 + 4a0 = 0
 
 so
 
  
 10. Now find a4:
 
  (4)(3)a4 + 4a2 = 0
 
 so
 
  
 11. Because you want the even coefficients in terms of a0, substitute the final equation in Step 9 
for a2:
 
  

192
Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques 
 
 Not so fast! Because (4)(3)(2)(1) = 4!, you get
 
  
 12. For a6, you have
 
  (6)(5)a6 + 4a4 = 0
 
 or
 
  
 13. Substituting the final equation in Step 11 for a4 gives you
 
  
 
 But (6)(5)(4!) = 6!, so you actually have
 
  
 14. At this point, you know that
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 Believe it or not, you’ve just generally related the even coefficients! If n = 2m (that is, if n is 
even), then
 
  
 15. Now you need to find the odd coefficients. Remember that the recurrence relation for the 
solution is
 
  (n + 2)(n + 1)an + 2 + 4an = 0
 
 You can see that for n = 1, you get the following:
 
  (3)(2)a3 + 4a1 = 0
 
 so
 
  
 16. Similar to what happened with the even coefficients, (3)(2) = 3!, so you wind up with
 
  
 17. When you try n = 3 in the recurrence relation, you get
 
  (5)(4)a5 + 4a3 = 0
 
 or
 
  

193
 Chapter 8: Using Power Series to Solve Ordinary Differential Equations
 18. Substituting the equation you found in Step 16 for a3 gives you this:
 
  
 
 or
 
  
 19. When you substitute n = 5 into the recurrence relation, you get
 
  (7)(6)a7 + 4a5 = 0
 
 or
 
  
 20. Substituting the final equation from Step 18 for a5 leaves you with
 
  
 
 which means that
 
  
 21. To summarize Steps 15 through 20, you now know that
 
  
 
  
 
  
 22. If n = 2m + 1, you can generally relate the odd coefficients as follows:
 
  
 23. You can now write the whole solution as
 
  
 24. Move the factor of 4 to the x term:
 
  
 25. In this case, the two series are recognizable as cos (2x) and sin (2x):
 
  
 
 and
 
  

194
Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques 
 26. After all that work, you can write the solution as
 
  y = a0 cos (2x) + a1 sin (2x)
j  Find the solution to this differential equation by using a series solution:
 
  
 
 Solution: y = c0ex + c1e–x
 1. Begin with a solution y of the following form:
 
  
 2. Your next step is to use y' to find y". Here’s what the terms of the series look like:
 
  y = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + a3x3 + . . .
 
 When you differentiate term by term, y' equals
 
  y' = a1 + 2a2x + 3a3x2 + . . .
 
 The general nth term here is
 
  nanx n – 1
 
 which makes y' equal to
 
  
 3. Find y" by differentiating the y' equation:
 
  y" = 2a2 + 6a3x + . . .
 
 The general term here is
 
  n(n – 1)anx n – 2
 
 which means you can write y" as
 
  
 
 Note that this series starts at n = 2, not n = 0, as the series for y does.
 4. Refer to the original differential equation and substitute in y and y" to get the differential 
equation in series form:
 
  
 5. To compare these series, make sure they start at the same index value, n = 0. You can do so 
by shifting the first series index; just replace n with n + 2. The result is
 
  
 6. Next up, combine the two series to get
 
  

195
 Chapter 8: Using Power Series to Solve Ordinary Differential Equations
 7. Then factor out xn:
 
  
 8. This series equals 0 and must be true for all x, so each term must equal 0. In other words, you 
wind up with
 
  (n + 2)(n + 1)an + 2 – an = 0
 
 which is called a recurrence relation; it relates the coefficients of later terms to the coefficients 
of earlier terms. You can actually use this relation to get all the coefficients in terms of a0 and 
a1 (which are set by the initial conditions).
 9. Your first step in relating coefficients is finding all the even coefficients in terms of a0. Start by 
solving for a2:
 
  (2)(1)a2 – a0 = 0
 
 or
 
  
 10. Great. Now find a4:
 
  (4)(3)a4 – a2 = 0
 
 so
 
  
 11. Substituting the final equation in Step 9 for a2 gives you
 
  
 
 Ah, but (4)(3)(2)(1) = 4!, so in reality you actually have
 
  
 12. Now for a6:
 
  (6)(5)a6 – a4 = 0
 
 so
 
  
 13. When you substitute the final equation from Step 11 for a4, you get
 
  
 
 Wait a second. Because (6)(5)(4!) = 6!, you really have
 
  

196
Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques 
 14. To sum up Steps 9 through 13, you know that
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 All of that together generally relates the even coefficients:
 
  
 15. Time to turn to the odd coefficients. Because the recurrence relation for the solution is
 
  (n + 2)(n + 1)an + 2 – an = 0
 
 you can see that for n = 1 you get
 
  (3)(2)a3 – a1 = 0
 
 so
 
  
 16. No surprise that (3)(2) = 3!, right? So you’re left with
 
  
 17. Plug n = 3 into the recurrence relation to get
 
  (5)(4)a5 – a3 = 0
 
 or
 
  
 18. When you substitute the equation from Step 16 for a3, you wind up with
 
  
 
 so
 
  
 19. Substituting n = 5 into the recurrence relation gives you
 
  (7)(6)a7 – a5 = 0
 
 or
 
  
 20. Substituting the final equation from Step 18 for a5 leaves you with
 
  

197
 Chapter 8: Using Power Series to Solve Ordinary Differential Equations
 
 which means
 
  
 21. At this point, you know that
 
  
 
  
 
  
 22. You can now generally write the odd coefficients of the solution as follows, if n = 2m + 1:
 
  
 23. So the whole solution can actually be written as
 
  
 
 Technically that’s your answer, but you can keep going so as to get the solution into an easier 
form.
 24. In fact, the series are equal to
 
  
 
 and
 
  
 
 which means you can write the solution as
 
  y = a0 cosh (x) + a1 sinh (x)
 25. Write sinh (x) and cosh (x) in terms of exponentials as follows:
 
  
 
 and
 
  
 26. Because sinh (x) and cosh (x) can be written as a sum of exponentials, you can rewrite the 
solution as
 
  y = c0ex + c1e–x
 
 where c0 and c1 are determined by the initial conditions. Nice work!

Solving Differential Equations with 
Series Solutions Near Singular Points
In This Chapter

▶ Determining whether singular points are regular or irregular
▶ Getting familiar with Euler’s equation
▶ Solving general differential equations that look like Euler equations
D
ifferential equations can get a little unruly when terms within them head off into infin-
ity (meaning they become unbounded). The points where functions go to infinity are 
called singular points, and you can expect to encounter both regular and irregular singular 
points in your dabbling with differential equations.
 
The good news is you can handle regular singular points by using the methods in this 
chapter. As for irregular singular points? Forget ’em. They’re a lost cause because their 
differential equations can’t be solved near such irregular singular points.
This chapter has you find singular points, classify them as regular or irregular, and go about 
solving them. And to make solving differential equations near regular singular points that 
much easier, this chapter also shows you how to deal with a special class of differential 
equations called Euler equations. You can often create a series expansion around a known 
solution to Euler’s equation for a general differential equation with regular singular points.
Finding Singular Points
 
Singular points occur when a coefficient in a particular differential equation becomes 
unbounded.

unbounded when 4 – x2 = 0, so the 
singular points are

 Q. 
What are the singular points of this 
differential equation?
  
  
 A. 
x1 = 2 and x2 = –2
1. First, put the equation into the 
following form:
 
 
  where
 
 p(x) = Q(x)/P(x)
  and
 
 q(x) = R(x)/P(x)
For example, in this differential equation
 
where
p(x) = Q(x)/P(x)
and
q(x) = R(x)/P(x)
the singular points occur where Q(x)/P(x) and/or R(x)/P(x) become unbounded.
In the following problems, you practice finding singular points in differential equations.

 Chapter 9: Solving Differential Equations with Series Solutions Near Singular Points
Classifying Singular Points 
as Regular or Irregular
 
Singular points come in two different forms: regular and irregular. Regular singular points are 
well-behaved and defined in terms of the ratio Q(x)/P(x) and R(x)/P(x), where P(x), Q(x), and 
R(x) are the polynomial coefficients in the differential equation you’re trying to solve.
Irregular singular points are a totally different ball game — and one that I don’t get into 
in this chapter. As you work through the practice problems here, if the singular point in 
question doesn’t appear to be regular, you know it’s irregular.
Allow me to introduce you to this dainty differential equation:
 
In order for x0 to be a regular singular point, these two relations must be true:
 
and
 
If you define
p(x) = Q(x)/P(x)
and
q(x) = R(x)/P(x)
then the two limits become
 
and
 
If both of these statements are true, then the point x0 is a regular singular point.
In the following problems, you practice classifying singular points as regular or irregular. 
Don’t worry — it’s actually kind of fun!

204
Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques 
  So the singular points are x1 = 0 and 
x2 = 0.
3. Evaluate:
 
 
  The singular points, x0, are both 0, so 
this equation becomes
 
 
  and the value of the expression is 0, 
which is finite.
4. Next, evaluate the following:
 
 
  Again, the singular points, x0, are both 
0, so this equation becomes
 
 
  and the value of this expression is 2, 
which is finite.
5. Because the limits are finite, the 
singular points are regular. That 
wasn’t too hard, was it?
 Q. 
Are the singular points of this differential 
equation regular or irregular?
  
  
 A. 
The singular points are regular.
1. Start solving by putting the differential 
equation into the form
 
 
  where
 
 p(x) = Q(x)/P(x)
  and
 
 q(x) = R(x)/P(x)

Working with Euler’s Equation
 
Solving Euler’s equation allows you to find the solution to many differential equations with 
regular singular points. If you can put a differential equation into a similar form to Euler’s 
equation, you can use a series expansion around the solutions you develop for Euler’s 
equation. That’s a pretty cool trick in my book.
When you want to play nice with Euler’s equation, start by assuming a solution of this form: 
y = x r.
Then substitute that solution into Euler’s equation:
[r(r – 1) + αr + β] xr = 0
r(r – 1) + αr + β = 0
r2 – r + αr + β = 0
Ultimately, you wind up with
r2 + (α – 1) r + β = 0
The roots, r1 and r2, of this equation are
 
You don’t know what α and β are, so you’re forced to consider three cases for these roots:
 
✓ r1 and r2 are real and distinct.
 
✓ r1 and r2 are real and equal.
 
✓ r1 and r2 are complex conjugates.
Following are examples to illustrate each of the three cases. When you’re done reviewing 
them, get more acquainted with Euler’s equation in the practice problems.

 Chapter 9: Solving Differential Equations with Series Solutions Near Singular Points
 Q. 
Find the solution to this differential 
equation:
  
  
 A. 
y = c1x –2 + c2 ln (x) x –2
1. Notice that the equation in the ques-
tion has the form of Euler’s equation:
 
 
2. Go ahead and assume that the solution 
is of this form:
 
 y = x r
3. Then substitute your attempted 
solution into the equation:
 
 [r(r – 1) + 5r + 4] x r = 0
  or
 
 [r(r – 1) + 5r + 4] = 0
  which is
 
 r 2 + 4r – 4 = 0
4. Factoring this equation gives you
 
 (r + 2)(r + 2) = 0
5. So the roots are
 
 r1 = –2 and r 2 = –2
6. Therefore, the general solution to the 
differential equation is
 
 y = c1x –2 + c2 ln (x) x –2
 Q. 
Solve this differential equation:
  
  
 A. 
y = c1x1/2 + c2x –1
1. This differential equation has the form 
of Euler’s equation:
 
 
  which means you can assume its 
solution looks like
 
 y = x r
2. Substituting your attempted solution 
into the differential equation gives you
 
 [6r(r – 1) + 9r – 3] x r = 0
  or
 
 [6r(r – 1) + 9r – 3] = 0
  which is actually
 
 6r 2 + 9r – 3 = 0
3. Factor this equation to get
 
 3(2r – 1)(r + 1) = 0
4. It appears that the roots are
 
 r1 = 1/2 and r 2 = –1
5. So the general solution to the original 
equation is
 
 y = c1x1/2 + c2x –1

208
Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques 
3. Substituting your attempted solution 
into the equation gives you
 
 [r(r – 1) + r + 1] x r = 0
  or
 
 [r(r – 1) + r + 1] = 0
  which is actually
 
 r 2 + 1 = 0
4. So the roots are
 
 r1 = i and r2 = –i
5. All that mumbo jumbo means the 
general solution to the differential 
equation is
 
 y = c1 cos (ln |x|) + 
c2 sin (ln |x|), x ≠ 0
 Q. 
Solve this differential equation:
  
  
 A. 
y = c1 cos (ln |x|) + c2 sin (ln |x|), x ≠ 0
1. I bet you can guess by now that this 
differential equation has the form of 
Euler’s equation:
 
 
2. Next up, assume that the solution is of 
the form
 
 y = x r

chapter (so if you haven’t reviewed the previous sections, you may want to flip back a few 
pages). All set? Then take a look at this general differential equation and assume that it has 
a regular singular point at x = 0:
 
Multiply by x 2 to make sure that the terms xp(x) and x 2q(x) (at least one of which has a 
singular point at x = 0) can be expanded into a series:
 
and
 
The Euler equation that matches the general differential equation you’re handling is
 
which means you can assume the Euler equation has a solution of the form
y = x r
To handle the fact that the differential equation you’re working with isn’t an exact Euler 
equation, add a series expansion to the solution (with the assumption that the n = 0 term 
is the largest term and that all other terms diminish rapidly):
 
The result is the form of your anticipated solution, based on the assumption that the 
differential equation you’re trying to solve isn’t too different from Euler’s equation.

Putting all this information together gives you the following recurrence relation (see 
Chapter 8 for more practice with recurrence relations), which allows you to find the 
coefficients an:
 
Note: If you’re not sure how to put everything together to achieve the preceding equation, 
check out Differential Equations For Dummies (Wiley) for the formal theorem.
The differential equation you’re solving for has two solutions, y1 and y2, which correspond 
to the two roots, r1 and r2, of its characteristic equation. The first solution, y1, is
 
where an(r1) are the coefficients using the first root, r1.
If r2 ≠ r1, and if r1 and r2 don’t differ by an integer, then the second solution is given by
 
where an(r2) are the coefficients using the second root, r2.
The following problems give you practice solving differential equations that look very much 
like Euler’s equation.

substitute this form of y into the Euler

Answers to Solving Differential Equations 
with Series Solutions Near Singular Points
Following are the answers to the practice questions presented throughout this chapter. 
Each one is worked out step by step so that if you messed one up along the way, you 
can more easily see where you took a wrong turn.
a  What are the singular points of this differential equation?
 
  
 
 Solution: x1 = 0 and x2 = 0
 1. First, put the equation into the following form:
 
  
 
 where
 
  p(x) = Q(x)/P(x)
 
 and
 
  q(x) = R(x)/P(x)
 
 Doing so gives you
 
  
 2. Therefore
 
  
 
 and
 
  
 3. Looks like p(x) and q(x) both become unbounded when x2 = 0, so the singular points are
 
  x1 = 0 and x2 = 0
b  Solve for the singular points of this equation:
 
  
 
 Solution: x1 = 9 and x2 = 0
 1. Covert the differential equation to this form:
 
  
 
 where
 
  p(x) = Q(x)/P(x)
 
 and
 
  q(x) = R(x)/P(x)

216
Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques 
 2. Now you have
 
  
 
 which means
 
  
 
 and
 
  
 3. These answers tell you that p(x) and q(x) become unbounded when x – 9 = 0 (and that q(x) 
also becomes unbounded when x = 0). Consequently, your singular points are
 
  x1 = 9 and x2 = 0
c  What are the singular points of this differential equation?
 
  
 
 Solution: x1 = , x2 = –
 1. First, put the equation into the following form:
 
  
 
 where
 
  p(x) = Q(x)/P(x)
 
 and
 
  q(x) = R(x)/P(x)
 
 Doing so gives you
 
  
 2. Therefore
 
  p(x) = x
 
 and
 
  q(x) = 1
 3. Looks like p(x) and q(x) aren’t unbounded anywhere, except when x → ±, so the singular 
points are
 
  x1 =  and x2 = –
d  Solve for the singular points of this equation:
 
  
 
 Solution: x1 = –1, x2 = –2

217
 Chapter 9: Solving Differential Equations with Series Solutions Near Singular Points
 1. Convert the differential equation to this form:
 
  
 
 where
 
  p(x) = Q(x)/P(x)
 
 and
 
  q(x) = R(x)/P(x)
 2. Now you have
 
  
 
 which means
 
  
 
 and
 
  
 3. These answers tell you that the roots of the denominators are –1 and –2. Consequently, your 
singular points are
 
  x1 = –1 and x2 = –2
e  Are the singular points of this differential equation regular or irregular?
 
  
 
 Solution: The singular points are regular.
 1. Start solving by putting the differential equation into the form
 
  
 
 where
 
  p(x) = Q(x)/P(x)
 
 and
 
  q(x) = R(x)/P(x)
 
 Doing so gives you
 
  
 2. Therefore
 
  p(x) = 1
 
 and
 
  
 
 So the singular points are x1 = 0 and x2 = 0.

218
Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques 
 3. The next step is to evaluate:
 
  
 
 The singular points, x0, are both 0, so this expression becomes
 
  
 
 and the value of the expression is 0, which is finite.
 4. Nope, you’re not done evaluating yet. Now you have to look at
 
  
 
 The singular points, x0, are both 0, so this expression becomes
 
  
 
 and the value of the expression is 1, which is finite.
 5. Because the limits are finite, the singular points are regular.
f  Determine whether the singular points of this equation are regular or irregular:
 
  
 
 Solution: The singular points are regular.
 1. First things first. Convert the equation into the following form:
 
  
 
 where
 
  p(x) = Q(x)/P(x)
 
 and
 
  q(x) = R(x)/P(x)
 2. Now you have
 
  
 
 which means
 
  p(x) = 1
 
 and
 
  
 
 So the singular points are x1 = 2 and x2 = –2.
 3. Evaluate:
 
  
 
 The first singular point is 2, so this expression becomes
 
  
 
 and the value of the expression is 0, which is finite.

219
 Chapter 9: Solving Differential Equations with Series Solutions Near Singular Points
 
 The second singular point is –2, so that expression becomes
 
  
 
 and the value of the expression is 0, which is finite.
 4. Next, evaluate:
 
  
 
 The first singular point is 2, so the limit becomes
 
  
 
 which equals
 
  
 
 which in turn equals
 
  
 
 and the value of this expression is 0, which is finite.
 
 The second singular point is –2, so the limit becomes
 
  
 
 which equals
 
  
 
 which in turn equals
 
  
 
 and the value of this expression is 0, which is finite.
 5. The limits are finite, so guess what? The singular points are regular!

 or
 
  [r(r – 1) + 5r + 3] = 0
 
 which is
 
  r 2 + 4r + 3 = 0
 4. Factoring this equation gives you
 
  (r + 1)(r + 3) = 0

 2. Substituting your attempted solution into the differential equation gives you
 
  [r(r – 1) + 6r + 6] x r = 0
 
 or
 
  [r(r – 1) + 6r + 6] = 0
 
 which is actually
 
  r 2 + 5r + 6 = 0
 3. Factor that equation to get
 
  (r + 2)(r + 3) = 0
 4. It appears that the roots are

  y = x r
 3. Then substitute your attempted solution into the equation to get
 
  [r(r – 1) + 3r + 1] x r = 0
 
 or
 
  [r(r – 1) + 3r + 1] = 0
 
 which is
 
  r 2 + 2r + 1 = 0
 4. Factoring this equation gives you
 
  (r + 1)(r + 1) = 0
 5. So the roots are
 
  r1 = –1 and r2 = –1

222
Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques 
 6. Therefore, the general solution to the differential equation is
 
  y = c1x–1 + c2 ln (x) x–1
k  Determine the Euler equation that this differential equation is similar to; then determine the 
Euler equation’s two roots, r1 and r2:
 
  
 
 Solution: 
 1. First put the differential equation into this form:
 
  
 
 Doing so gives you
 
  
 
 and
 
  
 2. The Euler equation most similar to your differential equation is
 
  
 
 where
 
  
 
 and
 
  
 
 so
 
  p0 = 1/2 and q0 = 1/2
 3. Therefore, the Euler equation is
 
  
 4. Multiplying by 2 gives you
 
  
 5. To find the roots of the Euler equation, substitute this form of y into the Euler equation:
 
  y = x r
 6. Substituting y and dividing by x r leaves you with
 
  2r(r – 1) – r + 1 = 0
 
 which you can expand into
 
  2r 2 – 3r + 1 = 0
 7. Factor the resulting characteristic equation as follows:
 
  (r – 1)(2r – 1) = 0

223

 8. So the roots are
 
  r1 = 1 and r2 = 1/2
l  Find the Euler equation that this differential equation is similar to; then find the Euler

Solve Differential Equations

▶ Applying Laplace transforms when derivatives are in play
▶ Solving differential equations with the help of Laplace transforms
L
aplace transforms, a type of integral transform, are another good tool in your differential 
equation solving toolkit. They have the great charm of being able to turn differential 
equations into algebra problems. Using algebra, you then group terms and see whether 
you have the recognizable Laplace transform of anything. If you do, you can get the reverse 
Laplace transform and your answer all in one fell swoop.
Care to see a Laplace transform in action? Take a standard differential equation like this one:
y" + 5y' + 6y = 0
and find the Laplace transform of it, which looks like this (note that the L{y} term always 
indicates a Laplace transform):
 
From there you need to consult tables of Laplace transforms. If you can identify the Laplace 
transform of what you have, you’re in business!
In this chapter, you practice finding Laplace transforms and then solving equations by using 
them.
Finding Laplace Transforms
To unlock the magic of Laplace transforms, you need to be able to find the Laplace trans-
form of the differential equation you’re working with. That’s why this section gives you 
practice calculating Laplace transforms of various mathematical expressions, such as 
exponentials and trigonometry functions.

226
Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques 
Here’s what a general integral transform looks like (note that this transform is not yet a 
Laplace transform):
 
In this case, f(t) is the function you’re taking an integral transform of, and F(s) is the transform. 
K(s, t) is called the kernel of the transform, which is the function you mix into the integral. 
(When calculating a Laplace transform, you choose your own kernel because doing so gives 
you a chance to simplify your differential equation.) The limits of integration, α and β, can be 
anything you choose, but the most common limits for Laplace transforms are 0 to +.
 
To calculate a Laplace transform by hand, simply follow these steps:
 
1. Choose a kernel that transforms a differential equation into something simpler.
 
2. Try to invert the transform to get the solution of your original differential equation.
 
When you restrict yourself to differential equations with constant coefficients, which is what 
you’re doing in this chapter, a useful kernel is e–st. Differentiating that with respect to t gives 
you powers of s, which you can equate to the constant coefficients.
Here’s what this handy kernel looks like when placed in the previous equation (note that 
besides using the kernel e–st, the limits of integration are from 0 to ):
 
The symbol for Laplace transforms is L {f(t)}, which is the Laplace transform of f(t). So 
here’s what the Laplace transform of the previous equation turns out to be:
 
 
The good news is that you don’t always have to go through the work of integrating by parts 
to find Laplace transforms. Sometimes you can use a table of Laplace transforms instead. To 
do so, simply take the Laplace transform of a differential equation and review a table of 
Laplace transforms (such as Table 10-1) to see whether you can identify any terms. Finding 
the inverse Laplace transform of the terms is easy: Just locate the correct entry in the table!

4. Finally, do the k = 3 term:

 Q. 
What’s the Laplace transform of y'''?
 A. 
L{y'''} = s3 L{y} – y"(0) – sy'(0) – s2y(0)
1. Use the rule that relates Laplace 
transforms of derivatives:
 
 
Calculating the Laplace Transforms 
of Derivatives
Occasionally, you’re going to encounter differential equations such as the following that 
aren’t so easy to take the Laplace transform of:
y" + 5y' + 6y = 0
 
In order to find the Laplace transform of a derivative, all you have to do is follow this rule, 
which relates the Laplace transforms of derivatives:
 
Using this rule gives you
L{y"} = s2 L{y} – sy(0) – y'(0)
and
L{y'} = s L{y} – y(0)
In the following example, I show you step by step how to find the Laplace transforms of 
derivatives. I then give you a couple chances to try the process out for yourself.

 y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = –4
  to get
 
 (s2 + 4s + 3) L{y} – (8 + 2s) + 4 = 0
  or
 
 (s2 + 4s + 3) L{y} – 2s – 4 = 0
6. You now have
 
 
7. Go ahead and factor the denominator 
so that you’re left with this equation

and
  
  
y'(0) = –4
 A. 
y = e–x + e–3x
1. Take the Laplace transform of
 
 y" + 4y' + 3y = 0
  to get
 
 L{y"} + 4L{y'} + 3L{y}
2. Recall that the following equation is 
the Laplace transform of y":
 
 L{y"} = s2 L{y} – sy(0) – y'(0)
  and that this equation is the Laplace 
transform of y':
 
 L{y'} = s L{y} – y(0)
3. You wind up with this result for the 
differential equation:
 
 s2 L{y} – sy(0) – y'(0) + 4[s L{y} – 
y(0)] + 3L{y} = 0
4. Collecting terms gives you
 
 (s2 + 4s + 3) L{y} – (4 + s)y(0) – 
y'(0) = 0
Using Laplace Transforms to 
Solve Differential Equations
If you’ve reviewed the previous sections, you have all the tools you need to solve differen-
tial equations with the help of Laplace transforms. (If you haven’t, I suggest you flip back a 
few pages and take a quick look at the earlier sections in this chapter.) The following prac-
tice problems let you put your skills to the test to solve various differential equations by 
using Laplace transforms. If you’re feeling up to the challenge, skip straight to Question 5; 
otherwise, check out the following step-by-step example.

232

14. By using Table 10-1, you can see that 
the Laplace transform of eat is
 
 
15. Compare L{eat} to the first term in 
the Laplace transform of the solution, 
where a = –1, to find the solution’s first 
term:
 
 y1 = e–x
16. Then check out the second term in the 
Laplace transform of the solution:
 
 
17. Looks like the second term in the 
solution is
 
 y2 = e–3x
18. Because the solution to the differential 
equation is y = y1 + y2, your result is
 
 y = e–x + e–3x
  which means that
 
 1 = a
12. Now you can set s to –3 to get
 
 –2 = –2b
  or
 
 1 = b
13. So this equation:
 
 
  becomes
 
 
  Tada! You now know what the Laplace 
transform of the solution looks like. That 
means it’s time to find the inverse 
Laplace transform of this equation.

and
 
  
y'(0) = –3
 
 Solution: y = e–x + e–2x

Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques 
 1. Take the Laplace transform of
 
  y" + 3y' + 2y = 0
 
 to get
 
  L{y"} + 3L{y'} + 2L{y}
 2. Recall that the following equation is the Laplace transform of y":
 
  L{y"} = s2 L{y} – sy(0) – y'(0)
 
 and that this equation is the Laplace transform of y':
 
  L{y'} = s L{y} – y(0)
 3. You wind up with this result for the differential equation:
 
  s2 L{y} – sy(0) – y'(0) + 3[s L{y} – y(0)] + 2L{y} = 0
 4. Collecting terms gives you
 
  (s2 + 3s + 2) L{y} – (3 + s)y(0) – y'(0) = 0
 5. Now you can use the initial conditions
 
  y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = –3

 3. Consequently, your result for the differential equation is
 
  s2 L{y} – sy(0) – y'(0) + 5[s L{y} – y(0)] + 4L{y} = 0
 4. Collect terms to get
 
  (s2 + 5s + 4) L{y} – (5 + s)y(0) – y'(0) = 0
 5. At long last, you can use the initial conditions
 
  y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = –5
 
 which give you
 
  (s2 + 5s + 4) L{y} – (10 + 2s) + 5 = 0
 
 or
 
  (s2 + 5s + 4) L{y} – 2s – 5 = 0

  2s + 5 = a(s + 4) + b(s + 1)
 11. Then try setting s to –1. You wind up with
 
  3 = 3a
 
 which means that
 
  1 = a
 12. Now you can set s to –4 to get
 
  –3 = –3b

Solving Systems of Linear First 
Order Differential Equations
In This Chapter
▶ Reviewing the basics of matrix operations
▶ Calculating the determinant
▶ Figuring out eigenvalues and eigenvectors
▶ Seeking out the solution to various systems
T
his chapter is all about solving systems of linear first order differential equations and 
practicing various techniques involved in solving systems. First, you work out your 
matrix-handling skills by adding matrices, multiplying them, and finding their determinants. 
Then you practice finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Finally — drum roll please — you 
tackle solving some systems of differential equations.
Back to the Basics: Adding 
(And Subtracting) Matrices
Before you can solve systems of linear first order differential equations with the aid of 
matrices, you need to know how to handle some basic matrix operations, starting with the 
most basic of all: addition and subtraction.
 
Adding two matrices together involves adding the elements at corresponding positions in the 
two matrices. The same is true when subtracting matrices: Elements must be at correspond-
ing positions in order for you to subtract them.
 
When adding matrices, such as A and B, you can flip the order of the matrices and still get 
the same solution. In other words, A + B = B + A. However, subtracting matrices doesn’t work 
the same way. A – B can’t possibly equal B – A. In fact, when you flip the matrices within the 
operation, A – B = –(B – A).
Following is an example problem to refresh your memory on adding matrices. After review-
ing it, check out the following questions for some practice adding matrices. (Where are the 
subtraction practice problems, you ask? The process of adding and subtracting matrices is 
so similar that I’ve spared you the hassle of working on subtraction here so you can focus 
your energy on solving the differential equations presented later in this chapter.)

An Exercise in Muddying Your Mind: 
Multiplying Matrices
To effectively employ matrices when solving systems of equations, you need to have some 
matrix-multiplication skills in your arsenal. Multiplying matrices is a little more involved than 
simply adding them. Why? Because AB is defined when the number of columns in A is the 
same as the number of rows in B. That is, if A is an l × m (that’s row × column notation, 
so A has l rows and m columns) matrix and B is an m × n matrix, then the product AB 
exists — and the product is an l × n matrix.
 
If AB = C, then the (i, j) (that’s row, column) element of C is found by multiplying each ele-
ment of the ith row of A by the matching element in the jth column of B and then adding the 
resulting products. Following is the standard visual presentation of multiplying matrices:
 
 
Here’s a little tidbit that may come in handy for you: AB ≠ BA.
As you multiply matrices, you may occasionally encounter something called the identity 
matrix. It’s labeled I and holds 1s along its upper-left to lower-right diagonal; the other num-
bers in it are all 0s. Check out this 2×2 identity matrix to see what I mean:
 
A 3×3 identity matrix looks like this:
 
 
Multiplying any matrix, A, by the identity matrix gives you A back again. For example, take a 
look at this multiplication:

Determining the Determinant
When it comes to matrices, the determinant is your best friend because it reduces a matrix 
down to a single significant number. Whether or not that number is 0 is important because 
that can indicate whether there’s a solution to the system of equations.
The following problems give you practice finding the determinants of various matrices. 
Good luck!
 Q. 
What’s the determinant of this matrix?

for a 2×2 matrix:

More Than Just Tongue Twisters: 
Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are the last tools you need to solve systems of linear first

very simple forms.
Say you want to transform a matrix (such as A) so that when you multiply it by a vector 
(such as x), you get back A multiplied by some constant, which is λ.
Any values of λ that satisfy this equation are called eigenvalues of the original equation. The 
vectors that are solutions to this equation are called eigenvectors.
Take a few minutes to review the following example problem; then try your hand at finding 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
 Q. 
What are the eigenvalues and eigenvec-
tors of this matrix?
  
 A. 
The eigenvalues of A are λ1 = –2 and 
λ2 = –3. The eigenvectors are
  
  and
  
1. First, find A – λI:
 
2. Now find the determinant:
 
det(A – λI) = (–1 – λ)(–4 – λ) + 2
  or
 
det(A – λI) = λ2 + 5λ + 6
3. Factor this equation into
 
(λ + 2)(λ + 3)
  So the eigenvalues of A are λ1 = –2 and 
λ2 = –3.
4. To find the eigenvector that corre-
sponds to λ1, substitute λ1 into A – λI:
 
5. Because
 
(A –λI)x = 0
  you have
 
6. Every row of this matrix equation must 
be true, which means you can assume 
that x1 = x2. So, up to an arbitrary con-
stant, the eigenvector that corresponds 
to λ1 is
 

256

7. Drop the arbitrary constant and write 
the eigenvector simply as
 
8. What about the eigenvector that corre-
sponds to λ2? Plugging λ2 in gives you
 
  which is actually
 
9. So 2x1 – x2 = 0 and x1 = x2/2. So, up to 
an arbitrary constant, the eigenvector 
that corresponds to λ2 is
 
10.  Good news! You can safely drop the 
arbitrary constant and write the 
eigenvector simply as

Solving Differential Equation Systems
When you have matrices and determinants, as well as eigenvalues and eigenvectors, mas-
tered (work through the problems in the previous sections if you still need practice), you’re 
ready to solve systems of linear first order differential equations.
Take a look at this system of homogeneous differential equations:
y1' = y1 + y2
y2' = 4y1 + y2
These differential equations are linked, which means they both contain y1 and y2, and there-
fore must be solved together. You can write them in this form:
 
which you can then write like this:
y' = Ay
In this case, y', A, and y are all matrices:
 
 
 
If A is a matrix of constant coefficients, then you can assume a solution of the form
y = ξert
No, ξ isn’t just a random symbol I’ve thrown in to see whether you’re still awake. It actually 
stands for an eigenvector. Substituting your supposed form of the solution into the system 
of differential equations gives you
rξert = Aξert
Now you can subtract Aξert from both sides to get
(A – rI)ξert = 0
or
(A – rI)ξ = 0

259
 Chapter 11: Solving Systems of Linear First Order Differential Equations
Tada! You’ve just found the equation that specifies the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of 
matrix A. So the solution to this system of differential equations:
y' = Ay
is
y = ξert
provided that r is an eigenvalue of A and ξ is the associated eigenvector.
To see the previous differential equation system worked out step by step, be sure to review 
the following example problem. If you’re ready and raring to solve your first systems of the 
chapter, feel free to skip the example and dive into the practice problems instead.
 Q. 
Find the solution to this system of differ-
ential equations:
  y1' = y1 + y2
  y2' = 4y1 + y2
 A. 
y1 = c1e3t – c2e–t and y2 = 2c1e3t + 2c2e–t
1. Write this problem as
 
2. Because this system has constant coef-
ficients, try a solution of the form
 
y = ξert
3. Substituting your attempted solution 
into the system gives you
 
  which you can rewrite as
 
4. Divide by ert to get
 
5. This system of linear equations has a 
(nontrivial) solution only if the deter-
minant of the 2×2 matrix is 0, so
 
6. Expanding the determinant gives you
 
(1 – r)(1 – r) – 4 = 0
  which becomes
 
r2 – 2r + 1 – 4 = 0
  or
 
r2 – 2r – 3 = 0
7. Factor the characteristic equation as 
follows:
 
(r – 3)(r + 1) = 0
  to reveal that the eigenvalues of the 
matrix are
 
r1 = 3 and r2 = –1
8. Now you need to find the two eigen-
vectors. Start that process by taking the 
first eigenvalue, r1 = 3, and plugging it in:
 
  Doing so gives you
 
–2ξ1 + ξ2 = 0
  and
 
4ξ1 – 2ξ2 = 0
9. These equations are the same up to a 
factor of –1, so
 
2ξ1 = ξ2
  Therefore, the first eigenvector (up to 
an arbitrary constant, of course) is
 

260
Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques 
10.  Now on to the second eigenvector. 
This one corresponds to the eigen-
value r2 = –1:
 
11.  Plug r2 = –1 into the preceding matrix 
to get
 
  which gives you
 
2ξ1 + ξ2 = 0
  and
 
4ξ1 + 2ξ2 = 0
12.  These two equations offer you 
the same information: the fact that 
2ξ1 = –ξ2. So the second eigenvector 
becomes
 
13.  Therefore, the first solution to the 
system is
 
  and the second solution is
 
14.  As you can see, the general solution 
is a linear combination of the two 
solutions:
 
  which can also be written as
 
15.  So the solution to the system of 
differential equations is
 
y1 = c1e3t – c2e–t and 
y2 = 2c1e3t + 2c2e–t

  det(A) = ad – cb

264
Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques 
 
 where the matrix looks like this:

 which works out to be
 
  det(A) = (4) – (4) = 0

 where the matrix looks like this:
 
  
 
 the determinant is
 
  det(A) = (3)(9) – (7)(5)
 2. That makes the solution
 
  det(A) = (27) – (35) = –8

Solution: –8
 1. Here’s how the determinant is defined for a 2×2 matrix:
 
  det(A) = ad – cb

 which works out to be
 
  det(A) = (16) – (24) = –8
h Find the determinant of this matrix:
 
 

265
 Chapter 11: Solving Systems of First Order Linear Differential Equations
 
Solution: –2
 1. Because the determinant for a 2×2 matrix is defined as
 
  det(A) = ad – cb
 
 where the matrix looks like this:
 
  
 
 the determinant is
 
  det(A) = (9)(6) – (8)(7)
 2. That makes the solution
 
  det(A) = (54) – (56) = –2
i What are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix?
 
 
 
Solution: The eigenvalues of A are λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 3. The eigenvectors are
 
 
 
 
and
 
 
 1. First, find A – λI:
 
  
 2. Now find the determinant, which is
 
  det(A – λI) = (2 – λ)(2 – λ) – 1
 
 or
 
  det(A – λI) = λ2 – 4λ + 3
 3. Factor this equation into
 
  (λ – 1)(λ – 3)
 
 So the eigenvalues of A are λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 3.
 4. To find the eigenvector that corresponds to λ1, substitute λ1 into A – λI:
 
  
 5. Because
 
  (A –λI)x = 0
 
 you have
 
  

266
Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques 
 6. Every row of this matrix equation must be true, which means you can assume that x1 = –x2. So, up to 
an arbitrary constant, the eigenvector that corresponds to λ1 is
 
  
 7. Drop the arbitrary constant and write the eigenvector simply as
 
  
 8. What about the eigenvector that corresponds to λ2? Plugging λ2 in gives you
 
  
 
 which is actually
 
  
 9. So x1 = 0, which means that, up to an arbitrary constant, the eigenvector that corresponds to λ2 is
 
  
 10. Good news! You can drop the arbitrary constant and just write the eigenvector simply as
 
  
j Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix:
 
 
 
Solution: The eigenvalues of A are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = –1. The eigenvectors are
 
 
 
 
and
 
 
 1. Start off by finding A – λI:
 
  
 2. Then find the determinant:
 
  det(A – λI) = (3 – λ)(–2 – λ) + 4
 
 which equals
 
  λ2 – λ – 2
 3. Factor this equation as follows:
 
  (λ + 1)(λ – 2)

267
 Chapter 11: Solving Systems of First Order Linear Differential Equations
 
 to reveal that the eigenvalues of A are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = –1.
 4. Now it’s time to find the eigenvectors. Substitute λ1 into A – λI to find the eigenvector correspond-
ing to λ1:
 
  
 5. You already know that
 
  (A –λI)x = 0
 
 so
 
  
 6. Because every row of this matrix equation must be true, go ahead and assume that x1 = –x2. So, up 
to an arbitrary constant, the eigenvector corresponding to λ1 is
 
  
 7. Drop the arbitrary constant and write the eigenvector as follows:
 
  
 8. Great. Now plug λ2 in to get
 
  
 
 so
 
  
 9. Looks like 4x1 = x2, which means that, up to an arbitrary constant, the eigenvector corresponding 
to λ2 is
 
  
 10. For simplicity’s sake, drop the arbitrary constant:
 
  
k Find the solution to this system of differential equations:
 
 
y1' = –y1 – y2
 
 
y2'= 2y1 – 4y2

 1. Write this problem as
 
  

268

 2. Because this system has constant coefficients, try a solution of the form
 
  y = ξert
 3. Substituting your attempted solution into the system gives you
 
  
 
 which you can rewrite as
 
  
 4. Divide by ert to get
 
  
 5. This system of linear equations has a (nontrivial) solution only if the determinant of the 2×2 
matrix is 0, so
 
  
 6. Expanding the determinant gives you
 
  (–1 – r)(–4 – r) + 2 = 0
 
 which becomes
 
  (1 + r)(4 + r) + 2 = 0
 
 or
 
  r2 + 5r + 4 + 2 = 0
 
 which is also
 
  r2 + 5r + 6 = 0
 7. Factor the characteristic equation as follows:
 
  (r + 2)(r + 3) = 0
 
 to reveal that the eigenvalues of the matrix are
 
  r1 = –2 and r2 = –3
 8. Now you need to find the two eigenvectors. Start that process by taking the first eigenvalue, 
r1 = –2, and plugging it in:
 
  
 
 Doing so gives you
 
  ξ1 – ξ2 = 0
 
 and
 
  2ξ1 – 2ξ2 = 0
 9. These equations are the same up to a factor of –1, so
 
  ξ1 = ξ2

269
 Chapter 11: Solving Systems of First Order Linear Differential Equations
 
 Therefore, the first eigenvector (up to an arbitrary constant, of course) is
 
  
 10. Now on to the second eigenvector. This one corresponds to the eigenvalue r2 = –3:
 
  
 11. Plug r2 = –3 into the preceding matrix to get
 
  
 
 which gives you
 
  2ξ1 – ξ2 = 0
 
 and
 
  2ξ1 – ξ2 = 0
 12. These two equations offer you the same info: the fact that 2ξ1 = – ξ2. So the second eigenvector 
becomes
 
  
 13. Therefore, the first solution to the system is
 
  
 
 and the second solution is
 
  
 14. As you can see, the general solution is a linear combination of the two solutions:
 
  
 
 which can also be written as
 
  
 15. So the solution to the system of differential equations is
 
  y1 = c1e–2t + c2e–3t and y2 = c1e–2t + 2c2e–3t
l What’s the solution to this system of differential equations?
 
 
y1' = 3y1 + 2y2
 
 
y2' = 4y1 + y2
 
Solution: y1 = c1e–t + c2e5t and y2 = –2c1e–t + c2e5t

270
Part III: The Power Stuff: Advanced Techniques 
 1. Rewrite the original problem as follows:
 
  
 2. This system has constant coefficients, so go ahead and try a solution of this form:
 
  y = ξert
 3. Then substitute your attempted solution into the system:
 
  
 
 You can rewrite that result as
 
  
 4. Dividing by ert gives you
 
  
 5. This system of linear equations has a (nontrivial) solution only if the determinant of the 2×2 
matrix is 0, so
 
  
 6. Expand the determinant to get
 
  (3 – r)(1 – r) – 8 = 0
 
 which becomes
 
  r2 – 4r + 3 – 8 = 0
 
 or
 
  r2 – 4r – 5 = 0
 7. Factor the characteristic equation into
 
  (r + 1)(r – 5) = 0
 8. Now you can see that the eigenvalues of the matrix are
 
  r1 = –1 and r2 = 5
 9. Time to determine the two eigenvectors. First, take r1 = –1 (the first eigenvalue) and plug it in to get
 
  
 
 or
 
  4ξ1 + 2ξ2 = 0
 
 and
 
  4ξ1 + 2ξ2 = 0

271
 Chapter 11: Solving Systems of First Order Linear Differential Equations
 10. These equations give you the same info, which is that
 
  2ξ1 = –ξ2
 
 So, up to an arbitrary constant, the first eigenvector is
 
  
 11. How about the second eigenvector? Well, you know that it corresponds to the eigenvalue 
r2 = 5:
 
  
 12. Plugging r2 = 5 into the preceding equation gives you
 
  
 
 so you wind up with
 
  –2ξ1 + 2ξ2 = 0
 
 and
 
  4ξ1 – 4ξ2 = 0
 13. Surprise, surprise: These equations give you the same info, which is that ξ1 = ξ2. The second 
eigenvector therefore becomes
 
  
 14. Looks like the first solution to the system is
 
  
 
 and the second solution is
 
  
 15. The general solution you’re going for is a linear combination of the two solutions, which looks 
like this:
 
  
 
 which can also be written as
 
  
 16. Thus, the solution to the system of differential equations is
 
  y1 = c1e–t + c2e5t and y2 = –2c1e–t + c2e5t

Ten Common Ways of Solving 
Differential Equations
In This Chapter
▶ Surveying the different types of differential equations
▶ Taking stock of your solution-technique options
T
ackling differential equations effectively — and with the least amount of frustration — 
means knowing what type of equation you’re dealing with and having a solution tech-
nique in mind. For example, are you looking at a homogeneous or separable differential 
equation, and can you solve it with either a series or numerical solution?
Consider this chapter your overview of the ten common ways of solving differential equa-
tions and where to find online help.
Looking at Linear Equations
 
Linear differential equations exclusively involve linear terms (meaning terms to the first 
power) of y, y', y", y''', and so on. An equation that looks like this is considered linear:
y" + 3y' + 6y – 4 = 0
For a great explanation of linear first order differential equations and how to solve them, 
visit www.sosmath.com/diffeq/diffeq.html, look for the First Order Differential 
Equations bullet, and click the Linear Equations link. Then flip to Chapter 1 for some prac-
tice solving linear first order differential equations.
Scoping Out Separable Equations
 
Separable differential equations can be written so that all x terms appear on one side of the 
equal sign and all other terms appear on the opposite side. Here’s an example:
 

276
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
This differential equation can be separated as
dy = x4 dx – x2 dx
For additional help spotting and understanding separable differential equations, head to 
www.sosmath.com/diffeq/diffeq.html, find the First Order Differential Equations 
bullet, and click the Separable Equations link. Or if you’re feeling up to it, head to Chapter 2 
to start solving separable differential equations.
Applying the Method of Undetermined 
Coefficients
When your differential equation has constant coefficients, like this one does:
y" + 9y' + 8y – 4 = 0
then you should try the method of undetermined coefficients to solve it. Flip to Chapter 5 
for a demonstration of this technique; then check out this additional resource: tutorial.
math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/UndeterminedCoefficients.aspx.
Honing in on Homogeneous Equations
 
In a homogeneous differential equation, all the terms involve y, as you can see in this 
example:
y" – 7y' + 12y = 0
You typically write homogeneous differential equations by setting the right side of the equa-
tion equal to 0. For some online help with recognizing and solving homogeneous equations, 
check out en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_differential_equation.
Examining Exact Equations
If you encounter a differential equation that can be written in this form:
M(x, y) dx + N(x, y) dy = 0
then the equation can be called exact if
 

277
 Chapter 12: Ten Common Ways of Solving Differential Equations

diffeq/diffeq.html, find the First Order Differential Equations bullet, and click the 
Exact and Non-Exact Equations link. For some practice solving exact differential equations, 
flip to Chapter 3.
Finding Solutions with the Help 
of Integrating Factors
Whenever you see a differential equation like the following:
M(x, y) dx + N(x, y) dy = 0
but it isn’t exact — that is, this statement is true:
 
then you can try to find an integrating factor — μ(x, y) — such that the differential equation 
changes form to
μ(x, y)M(x, y) dx + μ(x, y)N(x, y) dy = 0
and becomes exact.
If you want a Web-based review on finding integrating factors, check out www.sosmath.

the Integrating Factor technique bullet.
Getting Serious Answers with Series Solutions
Is a tough differential equation like this one bogging you down?
y" + xy' + 2y = 0
Then try solving it with a series solution, which allows you to assume that y can be 
expanded in a power series like this:
 
For practice solving differential equations using series solutions, flip to Chapter 8. You can 
also check out this great online resource: tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/

Turning to Laplace Transforms for Solutions
Laplace transforms offer you a powerful tool for solving differential equations like the 
following:
y" + 5y' + 6y = 0
Take the Laplace transform of this differential equation and apply any initial conditions to 
get, for example,
 
Then take the inverse Laplace transform to get the solution to the differential equation:
y = e–2x + e–3x
Check out Chapter 10 for some practice using Laplace transforms, or head to tutorial.
math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/IVPWithLaplace.aspx for some additional refresher.
Determining whether a Solution Exists
Sometimes a differential equation may not have a solution. Fortunately, a number of theo-
rems are available to help you determine whether that’s the case. For more on the existence 
and uniqueness of solutions, head to www.sosmath.com/diffeq/diffeq.html, find 
the First Order Differential Equations bullet, and click the Existence and Uniqueness of 
Solutions link.
Solving Equations with Computer-Based 
Numerical Methods
Computer-based numerical methods are always an option when you’re faced with crazy, 
complex differential equations, such as
sin (y)y(4) – 93 cos (x)y''' + 3.7y' + 6y6 – 4ey = sin (x) cosh (x)
Several popular mathematical techniques, such as Euler’s method and the Runge-Kutta 
method, can be readily translated into computer code. Read all about these methods 
in Differential Equations For Dummies or at www.efunda.com/math/num_ode/num_

tional to the temperature difference of that object from the environment:
 
In this equation, T is the temperature of an object, t is time, k is a constant, and Te is 
the temperature of the environment. You can see this differential equation solved by 
going to www.analyzemath.com/calculus/Differential_Equations, clicking the 
applications.html link, and scrolling to Application 4.
Determining Radioactive Decay
Atoms in radioactive materials decay at a certain rate, which is given by this differential 
equation:
 
where N is the number of atoms of the radioactive material, λ is the decay constant, and t is 
time. To see a worked-out problem about radioactive materials in Moon rocks, take a look 
at www.tmt.ugal.ro/crios/Support/ANPT/Curs/deqn/a1/mrocks/mrocks.html.
Studying Inductor-Resistor Circuits
If you have electrical circuits containing inductors and resistors, use the following differen-
tial equation to determine the current in the circuit:
 

282
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
where I is the current, L is the inductance, R is the resistance in the circuit, and V is the 
voltage as a function of time of the driving voltage source. To see how to handle this kind 
of problem, check out www.analyzemath.com/calculus/Differential_Equations, 
click the applications.html link, and scroll down to Application 5.
Calculating the Motion of a Mass on a Spring
The motion of a mass on a spring that’s moving horizontally (which means gravity isn’t a 
factor) is given by this differential equation:
 
where x is the location of the mass, m is the mass, and k is the constant of the spring. Visit 
hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/shm2.html#c2 to see the solution.
