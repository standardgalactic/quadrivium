Porosity. Overburden. Sonic
Sonic log data are shown in Figure 1-4, recorded in formation starting at 600 m and one starting 1500 
m of sea depth, after performing calibration tests in the sea water. Assume a third data set was available, 
recorded onshore, and, for the sake of comparison, that the sonic velocities are the same for the onshore 
sediments as for the off shore sediments (not really true since compaction would probably be different 
for on- and offshore, but acceptable assumption for comparison purposes).
a)	 Find first the local overburden density (the data in Table are difficult to read. Use your 
interpreting ability).
b)	 Find then the equivalent, œÅovb, where the logged formation were placed onshore, (i.e. 0 m water 
depth), under 600 m and under 1500 m of water. Plot results for three conditions: 0, 600 and 1 
500 m water depth. Distance from RKB and to the surface is 32 m. Start by finding the average 
velocity for every 500 m interval and select an arbitrary midpoint in the intervals. The first 
midpoint, between 0‚Äì600 m could be at 332 m, the next one at 832 m etc.
c)	 Find pore pressure at 2¬†500 mRKB (in 600 m sea depth) by means of sonic log (Eaton‚Äôs method), 
œÅovb is assumed constant = 2 kg/l.
d)	 Find fracture pressure for the same case as in c, under the assumption that the Poisson‚Äôs ratio = 
0.25, and œÅpore = 1.73 kg/l.

Pore pressure, dc
The 17.5Àù section of a wildcat well was drilled in the Barents Sea. Applying seawater as mud, a WOB 
at 40 000 lbf and rotary speed at 90 rpm; the ROP was averaging between 14 and 12 m/h at the depth 
from 600 to 1 500 m as shown in Figure 1-6. At the depth of 1 600 m the gradual decline in ROP took 
an increasing trend. At the depth of 1 750 m an eruption of mud through the rotary table took place. 
The inexperienced drilling crew hadn‚Äôt noticed any changes in the operational parameters and the kick 
came therefore as a surprise.
While attempting to close the BOP, the well was already blowing gas, mud and sand. It turned out that 
the sealing elements were damaged, and the BOP could not be seated properly; the shear ram had to be 
activated. Six days in total were lost by killing, fishing and repairing before drilling could be resumed.

Formation Pressure
In the following evaluation-meeting it was agreed that this kick should not have been a surprise. A task 
force was set up to investigate the problem. One specific question was: Could the increased pore pressure 
have been avoided if the dc exponent method had been applied?
The task force was therefore assigned the responsibility of estimating the true formation pressure from 
1 600 to 2 300 m by means of the dc method. Pore pressure was known to be normal (1.04 kg/l) down 
to 1 600 m. The 12.25Àù hole section started at 1 750 m with the same drilling parameter as above, except 
for the mud weight which was increased from 8.8 to 10.5 PPG.
At the depth of 2 000 m the mud weight was increased to 13 PPG, and the well drilled at a constant 
WOB of 50 000 lbf and 90 rpm. ROP continued to increase and reached an average value of 15.5 m/h 
at 2 100 m, where it stabilized. Assume œÅovb to be 2.2 kg/l.

In all tasks assume the gas is ideal and that it follows the mud.
b)	 Standard Driller‚Äôs method (the effect of friction in annulus is ignored). Assume LDC = 0. Make 
a plot of SPP vs. strokes during the process of filling the drill string (DS) with kill mud.

Kill sheet. W&W. Conventional. Fracturing
This exercise of killing is conventional since the additional pressure loss in the annulus is negligible, 
due to the combined effect of shallow ocean depth and two choke lines are applied. Both are 4ÀùWhen 
a critical situation occurs it is important that all known data are pre-entered into the kill sheet  
(Figure 2-3.1). If a kick is encountered the remaining data in the kill sheet can then be quickly entered 
and estimated. The following operational data are given:
DP:	
5Àù . 4.127Àù	
	
Pump capacity:	19.57 l/stroke
DC:	
6.5Àù . 2.5Àù, 150 m

After having cemented the casing, a leak-off test with mud of density 1.61 kg/l resulted in a surface leak-
off pressure of 42.6 bars. The mud density was then increased to 1.67 kg/l. The following circulation at 
reduced pump speeds gave these results:

During killing assume the kick consists of ideal gas (weightless, Z and T = const.), gas appears as one 
bubble and travels along with the mud. The hydrostatic column of the mixed fluid/gas in the annulus 
together with the surface choke pressure is balancing the pore pressure. The hydraulic friction during 
killing is distributed like this in the circulating system:
Through drill pipe:	
50%	
(evenly distributed along the pipe)
Through bit:

Your task is to investigate how the well behaves in 3 specific points of time, and estimate 2 different 
drill string pressure and 2 different annular pressures for each of the 3 time points at the positions as 
stated below:
‚Ä¢	 Drill string pressure: At the bottom (just above the bit) and at the surface (SPP)
‚Ä¢	 Annular pressure: At bottom of the well and at the surface (the choke pressure)
The 3 specific points of time are:
1.	 Time of stabilized shut in pressure
2.	 Pump has just reached the speed of slow circulating rate (SCR), but gas is practically still at 
the bottom of the well
3.	 Top of gas has reached casing shoe

Driller‚Äôs. Conventional. Pressure in 6 points of time
This task is similar to the previous one, but now the friction in the annulus has to be accounted for. Your 
task is to investigate how the well behaves in 6 specific time points, and for each display four resulting 
pressures into a depth-pressure graph:
‚Ä¢	 Drill string pressure: At bottom (above bit) and surface (stand pipe pressure)
‚Ä¢	 Annular pressure: At bottom and surface (choke pressure)

In this exercise a potential problem could be an underground blow out. It is therefore especially important 
to determine if the formation can withstand the wellbore pressure. 
a)	 During drilling a serious kick results in high danger of blow out. Operational, wellbore geometry 
and well fluid data are given below. In addition some observations emphasize the severity of 
the problem: Immediate after the well is closed in, the casing and drill pipe pressure starts to 
rise slowly. After approximately 30 min. both the pressures starts to decrease!

b)	 In order to simulate a dangerous situation, a new situation or case is now presented:
The drilling situation is as described above, but now with these changes:
	
SIDPP = 15 bars, SICP = 20 bars, Vkick = 2.3 m3
Check the pressures at the casing shoe under these assumptions:
‚Ä¢	 Gas moves like one bubble and at the same speed as the fluid
‚Ä¢	 Temperature influence is negligible
‚Ä¢	 Gas density is not negligible. However, assume it is constant while rising through the annulus
Will it be possible to apply the W & W method without fracturing the formation at the casing 
shoe during killing?

During drilling at 3 000 m depth a 2 m3 kick is taken and shut in. Wellbore data are presented in 
Figure 2-9. The annular capacity is 0.02 m3/m from bottom to surface. The slow circulating rate has 
previously been recorded to 110 bars; of these 20 is lost in the annulus, the remaining 90 in the drill 
string. The 20 bar are subdivided, with 15 in the choke line and the remaining 5 linearly distributed in 
the annulus below the choke line. 
Check if a) Driller‚Äôs or b) Volumetric method can be applied without fracturing the formation below 
the casing shoe. Assume ideal, weightless gas which moves as a bubble along with the mud without 
dissolving. Include no safety margins.

Killing operation
Find pump schedule while killing by means of the Driller‚Äôs method. Figure 2-15 defines the geometry 
of the well. At 1 000 mTVD the wellbore becomes inclined 600, making the well from here twice as long 
vs. depth. Pressure loss through the bit is 50% of the total at SCR. Assume that the remaining drill pipe 
frictional pressure loss is linearly distributed with measured depth in each of the three drill pipe sections. 
The relative pressure loss in the three drill pipe sections are 0.4, 0.4 and 0.2 counting from the surface, 
respectively. The pressure loss in the annulus is negligible.

a)	 Previously a LOT has been performed and fracture gradient was determined to 0.14 bar/ m at 
the casing shoe at 1 000 m depth. At this time the mud density was 1.03 kg/l. What was the 
pressure at the surface when the formation started to leak?
b)	 The kick volume was measured to 3 m3. What does the kick fluid consist of?
c)	 Circulating pressure at slow circulating rate was 100 bars, measured through the choke line. 40 
bar of this pressure was lost in the drill string (including drill collar), 40 in the bit and 20 in the 
annulus. ¬æ of the mentioned 20 bar loss was lost in the choke line and ¬º in the remaining of 
the annulus. Sketch the dynamic pressure distribution in the drill pipe and the annulus, without 
calculations, one minute after having turned the pump on (when the flow is in steady state). 
Please indicate in the graph all your interpretation of the here presented text.
d)	 During the killing operation the pump breaks down and the well has to be closed. The drill 
pipe pressure and the casing pressure now read 3 and 29 bar respectively. How would you in 
detail, point by point, bring the situation under control?
2.17	
Volumetric method
After having drilled a vertical depth of 3 000 m it was decided to change the bit. While tripping, the 
wall started to kick and was properly closed-in. BHA was 500 m above the bottom at shutting-in time. 
Kick volume was 2.1 m3.
Shut-in pressure read 4.2 bars on both annulus and drill string side. A stripping-in procedure was initiated 
but was soon interrupted when the mud started leaking from the choke manifold simultaneously as the 
drill string was reported stuck.

Killing operation
This task was previously (2004) performed in groups of 5 students as a Problem Based Learning (PBL) 
task. The PBL-procedure is: 
Step 1: 	Define the problem so that all in group members agree and have the same understanding of it
Step 2: 	Any terms or expressions that needs to be clarified
Step 3:	 Brain storming session (normally lasting for 10‚Äì15 minutes): This always becomes a mixture 
between good and crazy ideas or explanations. No suggestion is wrong
Step 4: 	Prioritize suggestions and explanations 
Step 5: 	Learning goals: Must be both specific and general. This is how the students determine what 
critical knowledge is.
Step 6:	 Learn: Go out and approach the learning goals individually
Step 7:	 Solution: Suggest the problems you have been assigned first individually, then in group.
PBL is a technique applied in small and large corporations by engineers. It promotes teamwork and 
creativity. The real work and the research are like before; it is carried out through Step 6 and 7. The 
general part in Step 5 will ensure that all teaching goals are fulfilled.

3.1	
Gas transport percolation
At 3 400 meter, a 0.3 m3 gas kick was shut-in, resulting in 38 bar shut-in casing pressure. The gas started 
to migrate up the 12¬ºÀù hole, and after 15 minutes, the shut-in casing pressure increased further to 48 
bar. The mud weight was 1.75 kg/l. 
a)	 What is the gas migration speed?
b)	 Technical problems on the rig prevented the pressure to be bled off. What would be the 
theoretical maximum shut-in casing pressure when the gas reached the surface?
c)	 Discuss the two constants in the gas velocity equation vg = C1 ‚àô vm+ C2. Explain why c1 in the 
gas velocity equation is equal to approximately 1.2?
d)	 Prove that vg = vs
g /Cg where vs
g is ‚Äúsuperficial‚Äù velocity and Cg is the gas fraction.

Wellbore pressure during 2-phase flow
At the bottom of a 500 ft deep well gas at a rate of a) 6 000 and b) 1¬†185 scft/hr, together with 73 gpm of 
salt water (1.03 kg/l) is being injected simultaneously into an annular return pipe. The back-pressure is, 
as indicated in Figure 3-2, controlling the gas rate at surface. Assume dispersed bubble flow and assume 
for convenience that friction and acceleration accounts for a pressure loss equal to 5% of the hydrostatic 
pressure term. Assume further that:
	
vg = 1.2 vm + 0.8 (ft/s)
a)	 Apply the Newton Rapson forward iteration methods to verify that the pressure distribution 
in the well is in accordance with measured pressure in Figure 3-2. 
b)	 Determine also if the assumption of 5% friction loss was good or not.

Your general task is to present a method to determine the surface choke pressure during drilling. Use 
the Newton-Raphson forward iteration method.
Hint: In order to find the answer we need to guess a surface pressure gradient and find the bottom hole 
pressure through iteration. qg is related to standard conditions, i.e. 1 bar. Our first guess of flow rate is 
0.5 sm3/m. If time does not allow you to find the exact answer; just stop when you feel you have shown 
how to do it.

Real gas behavior
a)	 While drilling horizontally through a gas bearing formation the returning total volume at 
the flow line outlet is:
	
Vtot,0 = Vl,0 + Vg,0
The subscripts l refers to liquid, g to gas and 0 to the surface level.
Derive an expression of density, œÅ0, of the returning fluid at the flow line. Use this expression 
to derive an expression of the variable density down in the well, œÅ(z).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet‚Äôs 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF‚Äôs innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world‚Äôs wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Gas solubility
a)	 The 12¬ºÀù hole section crossed several unstable layers of shale, and WBM had to be replaced by 
OBM. Just before final depth was being approached (a horizontal well of 5 000 m MD (2 500 m 
TVD)), the well started to kick. The BOP, located on the sea bottom at 1 600 m sea depth, 
was closed properly. After closing the BOP, the mud continued to unload from the riser. The 
mudflow increased, and only 8 minutes after having closed the BOP, gas erupted through the 
rotary table. The eruption knocked down a pipe tongue which, when hitting the floor, ignited 
the gas, which exploded. In the explosion one crew member from the logging company was 
killed and two roughnecks got serious facial burns. The gas flow seized and stopped completely 
over the next 6 minutes. Give an explanation and a solution to the problem.
b)	 List situations within the drilling and the completion phase where gas diffusion has importance.
c)	 Bottle of Pepsi shaken. Then a) open immediately and b) wait for 5 minutes before open. What 
happens in the two situations?
3.6	
Gas solubility
It has been assumed that gas behaves like ideal gas, migrating upwards as one bubble; at the same speed 
as the drilling fluid and that the solubility of gas in mud can be neglected. This is not true in real cases, 
and this discrepancy will affect the killing operation. Evaluate therefore the following statements, and, 
in the case they represent a problem, what is the explanation/solution:
a)	 The annular surface pressure during killing operations is lower than theoretically calculated 
in WBM
b)	 Gas solubility influences the annular pressure during killing operations
c)	 Gas solubility is a function of salt content of the liquid
d)	 After drilling into a high-pressure zone with OBM, a 2 m3 gas kick was encountered and 
closed in. Due to bad weather conditions all systems were shut down for a period of 6 
hours. Assume that the total annular mud volume is 50 m3.

Cold water issues
Below are presented two statements. The task is to explain the problem and suggest possible solutions.
a)	 Hydrates are forming during drilling operations.
b)	 The mud develops high gel strength in the choke line since the sea temperatures here are 
especially low. How high is the pump pressure necessary to break the mud‚Äôs yield point in 
a 1000 m long choke line with an ID of 3Àù if the gel strength is 10 Pa? This is seen when 
circulation is initiated to kill the well.

c)	 Explain the problems that are stated in the text below. Make sketches.
On April 15th, 1988, the 10¬æÀù casing had been set at a depth of 1 000 m after a 14¬ΩÀù hole had 
been drilled to a depth of 1 003 m with 1.05 kg/l mud without experiencing any problems. The 
16Àù conductor casing had been set at 40 m and cemented to surface.
The cement company, here called A, cemented the 10¬æÀù casing with 1170 sacks of  ‚Äúlight‚Äù 
cement with 3% salt; slurry weight was 1.2 kg/l. This slurry was followed by 399 sacks of class 
‚ÄúH‚Äù neat cement; slurry weight 1.7 PPG. Full returns were obtained throughout the job. The 
plug was bumped with 50 bars, pressured up to 85 bars and held for five minutes. After releasing 
the pressure, the float held OK. The job was complete at 1400 hours.

Deep water and cementing issues
At 1800 hours the 16Àù conductor casing was cut without incident. At 1900 hours, the welder 
prepared to cut the 10¬æÀù casing. Upon lighting the torch, some small gas bubbles, breaking 
through the cement were ignited, causing slight burns on his face and arms. The escaping 
gas continued to gain volume, and by 2000 hours cement was being blown from the 16Àù 
conductor casing. 
By 0300 hours on April 16th, a well killer from Boots and Coots arrived on location. At this 
time the well was blowing its maximum amount and the rig motors were shut down. The well 
was blowing gas, fresh water and sand at least 15 m over the crown block. 
By daylight, with the well continuing to blow out of control, preparations were being made to 
skid the rig in order to facilitate capping the well. Vacuum trucks with 1.2 kg/l mud had been 
ordered. By 1300 hours the well died. Attempts to fill the hole with 90 m3 of 1.2 kg/l mud in 
the 16‚Äù conductor casing were made but the hole would not stay full.
At 1600 hours, with the well still dead, Cement company B arrived on location and began 
cementing operations through a string of 1Àù tubing down the 16Àù √ó 10¬æÀù annulus. The next 
several days were spent filling up the annulus in stages with some 1300 sacks of cement. Good 
cement returns were finally achieved with the final 40 sacks.
The ensuing 2 days were spent finishing and cleanup operations around the rig and nippling up a 
diverter spool and lines on the 10¬æÀù surface head. The 10¬æÀù casing was cleaned out down to the 
float collar and a noise log was run inside the 10¬æÀù to determine if there was any underground 
flow. The results of the survey indicated flow between the depths of 350 and 300 m. For this 
reason the 10¬æÀù casing was perforated and squeeze cemented to seal off any communications 
between zones. A casing inspection log was also run and showed no casing damage.
200 sx of class ‚Äì H cement were squeezed in at 350 m and 600 sxs of cement at 260 m. The 
cement was then drilled out and the casing cleaned out to the float collar. The casing was 
pressure tested again, and from this point on normal operations was resumed.
d)	 Gas Migration through cement is a dangerous phenomenon. Define the problem. Explain 
how the casing cement sheet can start leaking at any time after its initial set point and 
during the production phase. Suggest solutions respectively.
e)	 What factors would you recommend to be taken more seriously by the operator concerning 
cementing operations through gas bearing formations, and what are your recommendations 
in this respect.
f)	 Why do you need a diverter after the BOP is installed?

High pore pressure zone
a)	 Pore pressure is high (abnormal) whenever it is higher than the hydrostatic water pressure. 
Equivalent pressure gradients, in terms of density, up to 1.06 kg/l can be defined as normal.
b)	 Key processes involved in the forming of high pore pressure and its seal are:
‚Ä¢	 Compaction ÔÉ† porosity reduction
‚Ä¢	 Digenesis ÔÉ† water rich Smectite transform to Illite, which is more compact.
‚Ä¢	 Sealing of formations ÔÉ† both the compaction and digenesis will come to a halt after the 
establishment of impermeable boundaries. They are formed by either shale, salt or faults. 
Impermeable boundaries will hinder water to escape and thus stopping the compaction. 
‚ÄúRapid‚Äù sedimentation of clay increases the probability of the creation of seals. Other forms 
of high pore pressure are piezometric ground water and charged gas from lower formations.
c)	 In-situ key parameters characterizing the transition zone:
‚Ä¢	 Low vertical stress in the matrix ÔÉ† the overburden weight is supported by high pore pressure
‚Ä¢	 Higher porosity than expected at this depth ÔÉ† correspondingly high water content
‚Ä¢	 Darcy equation describes the water flow through the seal very well. The permeability is 
in the range of 10‚Äì15 Darcy. The time is in the range of 10 8 years.
d)	 Key parameters are described briefly below.
‚Ä¢	 Drilling parameters: ROP decreases with depth due to increased compaction. But in high 
pressure zones ROP becomes high due to low static and dynamic hold down)
‚Ä¢	 Logging parameters: 
ŒøŒø Mud: High gas cont. (from organic material). Low/high T-grad
ŒøŒø Cuttings: density, shape
ŒøŒø MWD/Logging: Gamma, sonic

h)	 Normal pore pressure is defined by the water gradient. Abnormal pressure occurs when the 
water level is higher; under-compaction occurs during ‚Äúquick‚Äù sedimentation of clay trapping 
much water; water expulsion, occurs during diagenesis; plate tectonic leads to high stresses 
and compressed reservoirs. Artesian water erupts after rainfall, causing the water floor to rise.
i)	 Overburden is compressing the sediments, water is squeezed out and flows slowly up or 
out sideways. When a seal exist, the leaks are stopped and pressure increases, depending on 
overburden and tightness of the seal. Latter is defined by Darcy‚Äôs law. A final remark; Maximum 
pore pressure = fracture pressure.
1.2	
Sedimentary formation pressure
a)	 Pore pressure is normal as long as permeability up to surface allows. Due to closures it may 
go up till fracture. Magnitude between the 2 boundaries is determined by the overburden 
(up) and Darcy flow (down). 
b)	 Overburden matrix loses porosity in the depths, œÅmatrix = 2.7 kg/l
c)	 Large water depth brings œÅfrac and œÅpore relatively closer together
d)	 Water is trapped and incompressible. Porosity stays at the level it was when trapped

Equivalent density of the overburden is referred to RKB, and its hydrostatic pressure starts from 
the RKB-level. The answer is depending on the selection of the data points. To obtain a correct 
answer one need to take the average between the selected data points. In practice a computer 
program would pick every single data point, and thereby eliminating this type of uncertainty.

Pore pressure detection.
a)	 Method	
Description, pros and cons
dc 	
	
dc is similar to the ROP indicator, but the influence on ROP from the most 
important drilling parameters (WOB and RPM) are accounted for (in a 
simple manner)
	
	
+ As opposed to ROP it includes the effect of ‚àÜ WOB and ‚àÜ RPM
	
	
+ Lithology changes are revealed through Gamma Ray. Non-shale areas are ignored
	
	
- Not available in real time
cgas in mud 	
Gas will always diffuse into the cap rock over the millions of years. Pore water is 
drilled out and even swabbed-in during cnx. Gas content in the mud is measured 
in the possum belly.
	
	
+ Reliable indicator in the overburden.
	
	
- Dependent on the existence of gas
Tmud	
	
High pore pressure zones act as insulators in sedimentary rocks due to the high 
heat capacity of water 
	
	
+ A simple method. Find deviations from the temperature trend vs. depth.
	
	
- Unreliable. Too dependent on pump flow rate. Have to use a more complex 
model in real time
	
	
- Large heat loss in marine riser increases the noise and thus decreases reliability
ROP	 	
Depends on pmud ‚Äì ppore; high differential pressure will statically hold cuttings 
down 
	
	
+ Simpler method than the dc method 
œÅshale	 	
Is a function of porosity, which is high in sealed, under-compacted, high  
pressure shale
b)	 The sealing mechanisms have been different. In addition also the compaction/charging-process 
may have been different.
c)	 Increase return flow; increased pit volume; pump pressure de- / increases when drilling into 
over pressure; SIDPP > 0 after shut-in

d)	 Hold-down effects are varying while drilling in porous formations. Establishing of a filter 
inside of the formation ahead of the bit is crucial. To establish a filter in front of the bit, average 
particle size must be 1/3 of average pore size. Both static and dynamic hold-down is affected 
by the permeability. The permeability which dictates how effective the pressure differences are 
preserved in the vicinity of the bit tooth action.
e)	 Clean shale can be found by means of Gamma. Shale must have been exposed to normal (slow) 
compaction and diagenesis. Pore water reaches equilibrium with surrounding water pressure.
f)	 Clay, and sometimes filter/filtrate-supported sandstone, can resist the pressure difference 
between wellbore hydrostatic pressure and pore pressure ahead of the bit (i.e. inside the 
formation). But only clay is impermeable enough to preserve this pressure difference as a 
function of depth. If sands are interbedded between tight shale, also the sand layers will contain 
pore pressure vs. depth information.
g)	 From data we read at 2 000 m, Œît = 110 as variable and 70 on the trend line (NB, Œît scale is 
logarithmic).

The graph reads a pore pressure density of 12 PPG = 1.44 kg/l. Conclusion: The two info 
sources give rather similar answers.
1.6	
Pore pressure, dc
Task force: Apply all possible warning signs from the well simultaneously, like cuttings density, ROP, dc, 
MWD etc. and increase the mud weight accordingly as soon as an increased pore pressure is positively 
identified. If the well kicks, close it fast in order to minimize annular pressures.
a)	 To find the d-exponent, solve the Rp eqn. and normalize it
	
Rp = Log (Rp/60RPN) / (log 12 WOB/106dbit)
Then solve for each point available, make graph, and establish a normal trend line from 500 m 
to 1 700 m (drilled with 8.8 PPG mud weight). Instead of calculating the d-exponent in every 
data point, we pick out 2 points on the established trend line; i.e.;
	
	
at 600 m; Rp = 14.0 m/h = 45.9 ft/h,
	
	
at 1 500 m; Rp = 12.0 m/h = 39.4 ft/h

The 84 l are applied to compress the involved fluid + expand the involved casing, drill string

leak off test of the 20Àù csg. To find the fluid compressibility the total mud volume must first 
be determined.

From a chemical handbook we find: cwater = 4.35 . 10‚Äì10 Pa-1
The 20% assumption of the fluid compression was therefore rather good. Now, with the 
correct date, we see that the true answer is that it accounts for approximately 18.5% of the 
total compression.
The practical consequence of large compressibility in the exposed system is that pressure is not 
immediately transmitted; some of the pressure or energy is spent on compressional work. This 
means that more fluid is needed before the pressure stabilizes. It will cause no practical problem.

Preparing for kick
a)	 By keeping bottom p > pore p. This is obtained partly by manipulating the surface choke at 
the choke line outlet, thereby adjusting the SPP.
b)	 Primary well control can be lost due to:
‚Ä¢	 High pressure zone not detected
‚Ä¢	 Mud density too low (gas cut)
‚Ä¢	 Drilling into neighbor, live well
‚Ä¢	 Lost circulation due to pwell > pfr
‚Ä¢	 Swab during tripping / Not keeping annulus full during tripping
‚Ä¢	 Emptying riser due to hidden gas (in OBM)

e)	 After pressing ‚ÄúClose upper pipe valve‚Äù a pilot signal is activated at the surface and sent 
through an 1/8Àù line to a 4-3 valve (4-openings, 3-positions) in the pod. It opens for and thus 
routes high pressure oil from the accumulators through a 1Àù line to the appropriate side of the 
selected piston. A shuttle valve makes sure one pod of two is selected (this is one more example 
of redundancy/high safety level). Make two principle drawing; the control system and a 4/3 
control valve. Give name to the relevant equipment parts. 
f)	 Quick changes during choke manipulation is now avoided + pressure is limited by the surface

h)	 Gas is light, has expanded and requires higher back pressure at the surface to balance

We need to check where the front of the kill mud is; has it entered the annulus? This we do 
by comparing the volume of old mud in the drill string with the volume in the annulus below 
the gas below the casing shoe.

Due to the high drill pipe volume we see that no kill mud enters the annulus before gas reaches the 
casing shoe. This makes it simpler for us.

Killing. Fracturing. W&W Conventional
a)	 Check first if casing shoe can resist the pressure at the moment of close-in:
	
MAASP = 62 ¬ò  105 ‚Äì (1 200 ‚Äì 1 060) ¬ò  9.81 ¬ò  1 200 = 45.5 ¬ò  105
Since SICP and MAASP are the same, it shows that the formation is about to be fractured. 
Fracturing is exactly what happened 30 minutes after shut-in (pressure decrease is observed). 
If we allow this to develop, or if common killing methods are applied, lost circulation will 
hinder a successful outcome.
	
Three options exist in such critical occasions:
1.	 Try circulating LCM + different pills like Gunk squeeze, Barite plug etc (expected 
success ratio: 7/10)
2.	 Reverse circulation (expected success probability e.g.: 10%. The low probability is 
caused by the MAASP being so close to SICP)
3.	 ¬´Bull heading¬ª + LCM or cementing (expected success probability e.g.: 30%, the 
low probability is caused by the large open hole length)

Solutions ‚Äì Pressure control
Bull heading and reverse circulation will, due to the long open section, often cause the casing 
shoe formation to rupture, causing lost circulation/underground blowout (which is highly 
probable in this case).
If, after having tried circulating LCM for a while, unsuccessfully, turn off pumps, check if the 
loss heals itself. It often will with WBM. If not hang DP in BOP, close BOP, pull away and start 
drilling a relief well.
b)	 Can Wait & Wait method be applied in the new case?
The difference between MAASP ‚Äì SICP has now improved by 25.5 bars compared to the previous 
example. We assume that the annular pressure loss from casing shoe and up hardly can exceed 
25.5 bars since the total friction loss in the complete well is 60.8 bars. But how will it be when 
gas is just below the casing shoe. This is a critical situation and must be checked. The critical 
situation is described in Figure 2-7: (one could argue that test if the Driller‚Äôs method will work, 
then also W&W will work. However, this is just an exercise)

Vkick ¬∑ pf = V ¬∑ px where V = hgas ¬∑ Capdp-w
	
2.3 . 368.16 . 105 = hgas 0.1 . px
	
ÔÉ† px = 8.47 . 108 / hgas
Combine the two expressions of px. Now hgas can be determined.

Is conventional killing acceptable?
For both evaluations we need some basic knowledge:
Mud pressure:		
p3000 = rmud ¬∑ gh = 1 500 ¬∑ 9.81 ¬∑ 3 000 = 441.45 ¬∑ 105 Pa

 pfracc,2000 = 1 700 ¬∑ 9.81 ¬∑ 2 000 = 333.5 ¬∑ 105 Pa 
‚Üí No fracture at shut-in moment, but close enough to suggest lost circulation material (LCM) 
to be added to the mud.
a)	 For the Driller‚Äôs method we need to add frictional pressure at the shoe. This includes 
friction in the drill string, the choke line and the friction lost between the choke inlet and 
the casing shoe:
	
p2000, dynamic = 326 ¬∑ 105 + 15 ¬∑ 105 + 5 ¬∑ 105 ¬∑ 950/1950 = 344 ¬∑ 105 Pa
	
√®	
Fracture will occur immediately after start-up of the pump. 
b)	 Now the volumetric method must be tested. Here is no friction. But we now need to check 
when the gas arrives at the casing shoe. The pressure becomes px. Follow the hydrostatic 
pressure line like in Figure 2-9.
	
px = 451.5 ¬∑ 105 (1000 hx) 9.81 ¬∑ 1500 = 304.3 ¬∑ 105 + 14 715 hx

 ÔÉ† Fracture will not occur under these conditions.
If the mud pressure was closer to the fracture pressure as gas passes the casing shoe, the only solution 
would be the modified method, where 15 bars can be subtracted from the surface pressures.
2.10	
Killing operations. Modified due to high choke line friction
a)	 Primarily by using a mud which results in higher pressure than the pore pressure. Primary well 
control may be lost by swab pressure, lost circulation, high pressure gas zone & barite sagging.
b)	 Modified method: 
In the modified method the surface pressure is modified at the start of the killing operation. 
Subtract choke line friction (or annular friction) from shut-in pressures.
Advantage: 
Engineer‚Äôs method: An extra safety factor is brought into the system because the annular 
pressure will be lower than in the Driller‚Äôs as soon as kill mud enters the annulus and kill mud 
is circulated from time zero. As a result the drill pipe or pump pressure is reduced immediately 
from the initial ICP.
c)	 Whenever it is not possible to circulate from the bottom. If not circulating from the very bottom 
there will be a part of the annulus which will be related to uncertainty.
d)	 To avoid quick changes in the choke pressure/limits in the surface equipment and to minimize 
annular friction.
e)	 In Figure 2-10 the surface choke pressure behavior is indicating the importance of friction in 
the annulus.

Estimate first two control information:
	
ppore = 1320 ¬∑ 9.81 ¬∑ 3000 + 11 ¬∑ 105 = 399.5 ¬∑ 105 Pa

During killing the well the three critical situations are the first, second and third danger. We 
start our evaluation with the standard Driller‚Äôs method, but without neglecting the annulus 
friction since it is so obviously high.
First danger; the formation may fracture during shut in:
	
pwell,2000 at shut in = 15 ¬∑ 105 + 1320 ¬∑ 9.81 ¬∑ 2000 = 274 ¬∑ 105 Pa
	
or MAASP = 17.5 ¬∑ 105‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ ÔÉ† Since MAASP > SICP‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ ÔÉ† no fracture
Second danger; start circulating. Will shoe strength be high enough?
We see from the slow rate tests that at 15 SPM the Dpchokeline is 10 bars more than up the riser. 
We assume that the pressure loss in the annulus is 10 bar. We understand immediately from 
the MAASP-info that the formation will fracture. Just to control:
	
pwell, 2000 = pwell, 1200 + Œîpann = 274 ¬∑105 + 10 ¬∑ 105 = 284 ¬∑ 105 Pa
The well will fracture. Use now the modified method. The pressure will then be reduced by 
10 bars, and no fracture.

Third danger; will formation hold when gas reaches casing shoe, after having switched to 
modified method?
The pressure at the casing shoe when gas is there we call px.
	
px + (1000 h2) 1320 ¬∑ 9.81 = ppore 
	
ppore ¬∑ Vkick = px ¬∑ Vx
The estimation will, in principle, be exactly like in the previous exercise. The casing pressure 
px when the gas is at the casing shoe becomes 210 which shows there will be no fracture. If it 
was closer the next option is the Modified Engineers. Then it must first be checked if the kill 
mud is entering the annulus before the gas reaches the casing shoe, in a sufficient manner. 
Otherwise the Engineer‚Äôs method would not improve the situation.
Start pump at a slow rate. When SICP starts to increase the control pressure is shifted from 
annular pressure to the corresponding pump pressure (the SIDPP).

Driller‚Äôs. Modified due to choke line friction II
The parameters are easier to estimate when you see the involved factors in a pressure depth view like in 
Figure 2-11.1. Modified involves reducing the SPP and the choke pressure by the amount corresponding 
to the choke line friction.

Figure 2-13.1: Pressure variation during killing. Red lines represent DS, black = csg.
b)	 The crucial question is if the casing shoe will hold. One (of several) ways to check this is 
through MAASP:
	
MAASP = pLO ‚Äì (r1 ‚Äì œÅLO) g hcsg =115 ¬∑ 105 (1 400 ‚Äì 1 060) ¬∑ 2 000 ¬∑ 9.81 = 48.3 ¬∑ 105 
This is well above SICP. However, with 15 bar pressure drop in the choke line (53 ‚Äì 38), the 
pressure at the casing shoe will increase by 37 + 15 = 52 bars when the pump is started. 
The formation will fracture at the start of the killing operation if the conventional method 
was selected.
c)	 In Figure 2-13.2 the pump was turned off and the well shut in at 1 000 strokes. Gas will rise and 
bring the pressure up in both the annulus and the drill string (left, assuming no gas dissolves 
in WBM), unless the gas starts dissolving as it percolates up into new, clean OBM (right). If 
dissolution dominate4s over rising-pressure effects, pressure will (eventually) decline.

Volumetric method
a)	 Steps to be critically analyzed.
Here is demonstrated how the task would be approached as a Problem Based Learning (PBL) task:
Step 1: Define the problem so that all group members can agree and have the same understanding 
of it: A kick was encountered when the drill string was off bottom. At the same time 
the killing equipment fails.
Step 2: Any terms or expressions that need to be clarified: The Geologist on the team may ask 
about;
	
 Stripping In: Run drill string through closed BOP into a pressurized well
	
 Stuck String: A sting which is not possible to move either axially or to rotate or both
Step 3: Brain storming session (normally lasting for 10‚Äì15 minutes): Normally a heated debate.
Step 4: Prioritize suggestions and explanations may be: 
‚Ä¢	 Swabbed in gas ‚Äì > expanding gas when it rises in the well ‚Äì > kick, 
‚Ä¢	 Gas must be below DP since SIDPP = SIC 
‚Ä¢	 Solve both leak and stuck if possible 
‚Ä¢	 Kill well by means of volumetric method 
Step 5: Learning goals:
	
 Specific: Swabbing, volumetric method, freeing stuck pipe, repairing leaks
	
 General: Causes of kick, killing methods, well problems during killing operations
Step 6: Learn: Go out and approach the learning goals individually

Step 7: Solution: Suggest the problems you have been assigned first individually. Come together 
and share and discuss to formulate a common agreeable solution:
	
 Isolate leaking manifold and start repairing it: Depending on the point of leakage we 
can isolate the leaking point through suitable choice of valves and reinforced hoses. 
Then start bleeding out the gas by means of the volumetric method. A more detailed, 
practical approach is shown below:
‚Ä¢	 Bleeding strategy; let out 1 m3 of mud through new choke each time pressure has 
increased estimated amount, after letting pressure initially increase additionally 
3 bars for safety reasons.
‚Ä¢	 Before we start the practical killing procedure, we check two issues:
Issue 1: Find the gradient of the influx through this relation (see Figure 2-17): 
Height of gas: ›Ñ‡µå

‡Æº‡Øî‡Ø£‡≥Ä‡≤π‡µå
‡¨∂«§‡¨µ

This 70 m column of gas produces a shut in pressure of 7 bars. We assume only 
the gas height is causing this pressure, since the well was in overbalance at the 
start of the tripping operation.
The pressure gradient œÅinflux can be found:

‚Ä¢	 After the gas has been let out at the surface, and a heavy slug placed in the well, the 
time has come to jar loose the drill string. After the string has been freed, RIH, and 
after the kill mud has been circulated from the bottom (add a safety factor to mud 
density to compensate for swabbing), the well is killed.
A previous group of participants suggested (under step 3) to jar loose and try to 
strip the drill string into the closed pressurized well. When planning to run the drill 
string back in hole (RIH) into a pressurized, closed well, the pressure increase caused 
by increased steel volume must be bled off. And the MAASP must be continuously 
supervised.
Another group suggested to Bullhead the gas kick back into the formation; The gas 
kick can be pushed or squeezed back into the gas bearing zone, if the formation is 
sufficiently permeable. A limitation of this method is the danger of fracturing the 
formation below the shoe; the bullhead pressure must be less than the MAASP 
pressure. Normally bullheading is limited to killing of producing wells.
b)	 Assume gas is swabbed in and will stay as free un-dissolved gas as it starts rising. The casing 
pressure profile during a volumetric killing procedure takes the form as in Figure 2-17.2 at 
the initial period of the killing procedure:
Safety pressure increase
Time (h)
Pressure change at surface (bar)
Shut In Pressure
Let out one unit of mud to allow 
for gas exspansion
Œîp - increase
Figure 2-17.2: SPP vs. time during initial stage of volumetric method. This step repeats itself until gas reaches surface.
c)	 Assuming no gas dissolves, the surface pressure becomes, when the gas reaches the surface:
	
psurface = pbottom ‚Äì rg ghx ‚Äì rmud (3 000-hx)g
	
hx = Vsurface / Capsurface
	
Vsurface . psurface = pbottom . Vkick
	
pbottom = œÅmud . g . hwell + pSIDP
Solving these equations results in: 
	
psurface = 60 ¬∑ 105 Pa
	
Vsurface = 16 m3
From bottom to top the gas bubble spend: 3 000 m / 500 m/h = 6 h
or, if using alternative info: 3¬†000 m / 0.3 m/s = 30¬†000 s = 8.33 h

Speed = 58.25 /15 min = 3.9 m/min = 233 m/h

The main reason for the 20% faster gas flow is caused by the coinciding velocity and concentration 
profile. The concentration profile is explained by means of the Bernoulli‚Äôs equation: The velocity 
is high in the middle and accordingly low pressure, sucking gas bubbles into the core flow. 
Surplus diffusion towards the center is also taking place due to the wall effect. And what is 
concentrated in the center of the pipe is transported at higher velocity.

e)	 Axial dispersion is the mixing of the displacing fluid with the displaced fluid. This process is 
taking place for one reason:
1.	 The flow in the pipe-center is moving much faster than the flow along the wall, and thus 
‚Äúshooting‚Äù through the displaced fluid, or stretching the mass volume.
2.	 When gas is involved, one additional but minor effect is involved:
The front velocity is higher than deeper down because of the addition of gas expansion due 
to buoyancy, towards lower pressure.

Wellbore pressure during 2-phase flow
The Newton forward iteration method in brief: Guess a fluid gradient near the surface between œÅmud and 
œÅgas, depending on their relative amount, estimate pressure at depth 1 and 2 and find the pressure gradient 
between surface and depth 2. Apply the gradient to depth 2 as the depth 1 gradient, and recalculate 
pressure at depth 1 and 2. Compare gradients of depth 1 and 2 until no substantial difference exists. Go 
to next depth and do the same. 
a)	 To give an estimate of the pressure at 55 ft depth an iteration procedure is suggested. Here, to 
demonstrate manually, we take the full interval of 55 ft since pressure is known here. Normally, 
in a data-program, we would have selected much smaller depth increment, typically 3 ft, to 
increase the accuracy. The index convention are:
0 = atmospheric condition
1 = first number, surface conditions (situation # 1)
2 = second number, surface conditions (situation # 2)
g = gas
l = liquid, sometimes also liq
m = mixture, sometimes also mix
The flow area and the surface pressure are needed:

Iteration is in accordance with Newton-Rapson forward iteration method, and starts with
	
p2.1 = p1 + G1 . h2 = 3.70 . 105 + 0.047 . 105 . 16.8 = 4.49 . 105 Pa
and results finally in
	
p2,n = 4.49 . 105 Pa = 65.1 psi. at 55 ft depth.
From the measured data at 55 ft we read 64.3 psi. Our result is 1.2% higher. To improve 
procedure of calculation the depth interval could be made shorter.

To make it simple we take the hydrostatic pressure of the mixture, based on the average gas 
concentration at bottom and surface, to be around 250 kg/m3 . 9.81 = 2 450 Pa/m. 
Now we check how large the friction is relative to the hydrostatic: (150 / 2¬†450) . 100% = 6%
The assumption of 5% was therefore a good guess under these assumptions.

You must assume a psurf from a guessed average reduced mixture density, e.g. 1.2 kg /l. This gives a psurf 
of 40 bar. On basis of this assumption Cgas is estimated, and it is possible to estimate the initial mixture

Gas solubility
a)	 Gas kick: The gas was already inside the riser when closing the BOP. It should have been diverted 
at surface (routinely done today). In an oil based mud the solubility is of great importance for 
small gas kicks. The complete gas volume can be dissolved in the mud and break out of the 
solution at a higher level in the annulus as the pressure decreases. Please verify these problems 
during the planning phase. In such cases it is difficult to detect the gas before it is too late 
to shut-in, like in this case. In the case of larger gas kicks not all gas can be dissolved and is 
therefore free, and easier to detect.
The solution to the problem is to always close the gas diverter to divert the gas, simultaneously 
while closing the BOP for deep water drilling operations. 
b)	
Situations involving gas diffusion
Role
1.	 Gas kicks may dissolve downhole
2.	 Gas may diffuse into the mud from a gas zone
3.	 While cementing through a gas zone, gas will 
dissolve in the filtrates from the cement slurry 
and later be sucked into the hydrating cement.
4.	 Gas will diffuse into the cap rock layers over 
millions of years and dissolve in the pore water.
1.	 More gas at surface than Vkick predicts.
2.	 After circulation a lot of gas will be liberated at 
surface.
3.	 Water is consumed during the hydration phase. 
Gas may liberate when inside the weak, hydrating 
cement and gas migration through the cement 
can be initialized.
4.	 When pore water is being mixed into the mud 
during drilling and is brought to the surface by the 
mud, gas can be detected if sensitive instruments 
are installed.
c)	 Case 1: High pressure (2 bars) escape and Pepsi and releases CO2 flow rigorously out of 
the bottle
Case 2: The released CO2 has re-dissolved. Only a faint pff is observed

Gas solubility
Assuming WBM and negligible gas solubility, surface pressure will, as gas arrives at the surface be lower 
than expected for two reasons:
1)	 The constant C, in the gas velocity equation is close to 1.2., practically independent of viscosity, 
flow regime, pipe dimension, and inclination angle. The main reason for gas to flow 20% quicker 
than the theoretical mean flow is caused by the fact that the velocity profile and the concentration 
profile coincide. Gas in the center of the pipe, travels faster than gas at its periphery.
2)	 The displacement front of the gas is shooting through the displacing fluid and resulting in axial 
dispersion. Additionally, the gas velocity at the tail of the bubble is slower than at the front of 
the bubble because of continuous fragmentation in the rear (wake of the bubble); every time a 
TJ is passed fragmentation will occur. And at the bottom the gas is more compressed and the 
buoyancy effect is lower. Velocity of a dispersed bubble is lower than a gas slug due to higher 
flow resistance (higher specific area).
For these two reasons the gas is therefore stretched out.
In case of OBM, much of the gas will be dissolved, and therefore the surface pressure increase becomes 
lower, as shown in Figure 3-6. The dissolved gas will exhibit a much lower, negligible volume, since the 
gas molecules have lost their kinetic energy while in the liquid state.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet‚Äôs 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF‚Äôs innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world‚Äôs wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Figure 3-6. Pressure evolution of shut-in gas in OBM (red, left) and in WBM (black).
The free gas will travel upwards due to buoyancy and dissolve in the mud. The initial free gas volume will 
therefore reduce, and pressure in the bubble will decrease as indicated in Figure 3-6 by small vertical, 
red lines or bars (vs. time).
When gas is dissolved we assume that the mud density is not influenced by the dissolved gas (negligible 
amount of mass). 
Gas solubility: In water based mud gas solubility is negligible. In Oil based mud the solubility is especially 
important for small gas kicks. The complete gas volume can be dissolved in the mud, and later go out 
of solution when circulated to a higher position in the annulus. It is thus difficult to detect small gas 
kicks before they flash out of the mud close to surface. For larger kicks the surface pressure is easier to 
interpret, but is different (lower) than for WBM.
d)	 Salt content: At high salt concentration, much of the water dipoles are bound in relatively rigid 
layers around salt ions and thus inaccessible for gas to be dissolved in. The part of the water 
which is still free and ‚Äúactive‚Äù will dissolve the same amount of gas pr. unit water volume.
e)	 2 m3 of gas entering a well drilled with OBM. The volume becomes 50 m3. The 2 m3 represents 
4% of the annular OBM-volume. OBM have normally a high YP and may therefore hold up 
to 5% gas in the form of dispersed gas bubbles (in addition to the dissolved volume). The gas 
may thus disappear completely.

Deep water and cementing issues
4.1	
Cold water issues
a)	 Hydrates 
Due to the low seafloor temperature and the high hydrostatic pressure, the formation of hydrates 
sediments below deep water can create problems in the drilling operation. They will thaw and 
cause the formation to destabilize if drilled through. Freed gas can create gas blowouts. 
The formation of deep water hydrates in the cold regions of the well can plug the choke and 
kill lines, BOPs and riser. Gas migrating from the reservoir along the outside of the surface 
casing and along wit	 h the mud inside the wellbore can form hydrates both outside of the 
BOP and on the inside of the wellhead. The formation of hydrate consumes water and will 
thus dehydrate the drilling fluids.
Recommended solutions are:
‚Ä¢	 Use hydrate simulators and modeling programs to predict the problem.
‚Ä¢	 Select the right mud system; WBM or Synthetic BM.
‚Ä¢	 Chemical inhibitors should be added to the drilling fluids.
‚Ä¢	 Add thermodynamic inhibitors (salt, glycol) to change equilibrium and conditions to 
hydrate formations.
‚Ä¢	 Add kinetic inhibitors (polymers, poly-butylene glycol) to retard the formation of 
the hydrates.
‚Ä¢	 Reduce non-circulation time to a minimum to keep the high mud temperature.
‚Ä¢	 The Driller‚Äôs method minimizes cooling of mud/gas mixture during kicks.
‚Ä¢	 Inject methanol into the BOP and wellhead connector.
‚Ä¢	 Add wellhead features to prevent gas slipping around the BOP and well head 
connector (mud mat).
b)	 Gel strength
High gel strength develops at low temperature. Differential pressure in a 1 000 m long choke-
line of ID = 3Àù = 0.0762 m if gel strength is 10 Pa:

10 bars, the YP or gel strength has to be 25 Pa: Dp = 4 ¬∑ YP ¬∑ L/d = 4 ¬∑ 25 ¬∑ 1 000 / 0.1 = 10 ¬∑ 105 Pa.

Viscosity-increase in the choke and kill (C&K) lines due to low temperature can mask the 
shut-in casing pressure (SICP). This effect increases with the use of synthetic mud (higher 
viscosity at low temperature). Kick detection may become difficult, as the well may flow during 
flow checks, but no shut-in casing pressure is seen. In order to reduce the viscosity problem 
the C&K lines can be filled with an anti-freeze fluid. Always consider the effects of mud solids 
settling in the C&K line and the resulting plugging or loss of hydrostatic pressure. In deeper 
water, the gel strength can be high also in the drill pipe, especially with synthetic mud. Slow 
rotation of the drill pipe can be used to reduce the mud gel strength when breaking circulation.

Deep water shallow formations
a)	 SWF = shallow water flow. Water starts flowing from pressurized sands. While flowing; it 
slowly erodes the sand zone, the cement behind the casing and the water may even find its 
way up to the surface through the weak, shallow formations. This may cause both the casing 
and fixed platforms to collapse.
Water filled shallow sands are not easy to predict, nor to detect or control. Unlike trapped 
gas, they will not give clear spots on the seismic surveys. Normally the upper sections are 
drilled riserless with no return to the rig and flow must be detected by means of ROV or video 
surveillance. The shallow water problem can be of a very local nature and safe areas can be 
found 50‚Äì100 meters to the sides.

b)	 Solution: Kill dynamically and drill further with heavy mud and set casing and cement in place 
when at TVD. Drill pilot hole without riser. Drill extremely carefully with sonar and regular 
checks. Avoid such areas when detected through radar surveys (mud volcanoes).
New casing program to seal off the SWF problem using the 20‚Äù casing and an external casing 
packer (ECP). Water zone requires sometimes an additional casing string. This adds complexity 
in the drilling operation. Top-hole drill-in casing is a potential solution to handle shallow water 
flows. This method allows the casing to be cemented in place in case of shallow water problems. 
No time is needed for retrieving the drill string and running casing. Use high quality cement 
and cement techniques.
c)	 Shallow water flow is occurring where the settling rate of clay has been high. We find these 
high rates in conjunction with large river systems like offshore Brazil, in the GoM etc. Here 
the probability of finding high pressure closures of water sands is high.
d)	 After a killing operation is completed the BOP need to be cleaned of trapped gas.
Step 1: 	
Clean out the trapped pockets of gas in the BOP 
Step 2. 	
Exchange the old, original mud in the riser (could still be free / dissolved gas there)
If step 1 is not completed, gas will rise up through the marine riser after opening the BOP, 
expand and partly empty the riser, which, in worst case could lead to collapsed riser. And the 
gas could ignite.
If Step 2 is not performed, the hydrostatic pressure may be too low when the BOP is opened, 
and a new kick may arise from the formation exposed to an underbalanced wellbore.
Typical abbreviations in daily drilling reports:
ann	
	
= annulus
lpr 	
	
= lower pipe ram
slug 	 	
= small volume of heavier mud
u	
	
= unit (gas unit)
upr 	 	
= upper pipe ram
stack 	 	
= all the individual preventers
u-tube 	
= here: use riser and kill line as a U-tube
e)	 Gas may be hidden in the riser, above the closed BOP, especially if OBM is used.

Cementing Operations
a)	 Objective:
‚Ä¢	 Protect and support the casing
‚Ä¢	 Prevent the movement of fluid through the annular space outside the casing
‚Ä¢	 Stop the movement of fluid into vugular or fractured formations 
‚Ä¢	 Close off an abandoned portion of the well
b)	 Squeeze cement (not part of the required knowledge in this course)
‚Ä¢	 Set the bottom retainer plug just under the zone of interest for squeeze cement
‚Ä¢	 Perforate casing at this zone
‚Ä¢	 Set the top retainer plug above the zone.
‚Ä¢	 Pump HCl + HF ‚Äì if needed
‚Ä¢	 Fracture zone of interest ‚Äì if needed
‚Ä¢	 Pump high hydraulic pressure cement through DP
‚Ä¢	 Wait minimum 24 hours
‚Ä¢	 Conduct cement evaluation
‚Ä¢	 Take decision if it is ok or not
c)	 This is an old story and the kick during cementing took most people by surprise at that distant 
time. However, today such cases are happening more rarely, but when they do, they take us by 
surprise. The phenomenon is called Gas Migration in cement. Please learn from the history.
d)	 Gas Migration: Cement shrinks and sucks water and gas from the surroundings. Gas has 
buoyancy and may break through the cement, erode it, and after ample time, cause a continuous 
flow of gas to the surface
Solution: Avoid suction of gas by 
Replace shrinking material (cement) by other non-shrinking materials
Use dispersed nitrogen in the cement slurry
Displace gas from near well bore formation before cementing (has never been done)
Always use best practice cementing technique.

e)	 There are 4 factors that could result in serious consequences (leaking cement) if not 
handled properly.
1.	 Water may be lost from the cement slurry when it is in place in the permeable wellbore 
due to high hydrostatic pressure of the slurry compared to the pressure in the permeable 
sedimentary formation
2.	 Cement slurry pressure will reduce during the hydration phase and may suck fluids and 
gas from the surroundings
3.	 Displacement of the mud by the cement will lead to some amount of leftover mud along 
the wall (axial dispersion), especially in the upper parts of the displaced wellbore
4.	 Bonding to the wall is poor. The main reasons behind this problem are; remaining 
filter cake, stresses provoked by shrinkage, temperature differences and/or pressure 
fluctuations during later operations
Preventive countermeasures
1.	 Remove cake/mud. Reduce permeability in cement (e.g. micro silica)
2.	 Minimize axial dispersion by pumping in turbulence, and pump in excess of 
theoretically necessary volume.
3.	 Use elastic cement 
f)	 To handle eventual gas in the riser after BOP closure.
