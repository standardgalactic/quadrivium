Registers       1 cycle          256-8000 bytes 
Cache             3 cycles            256k-1M 
Main memory   20-100 cycles    32M-4G 
Disk                0.5-5M cycles    4G-1T

Managing Caches 
•
Power usage limits  
– Size and speed of registers/caches 
– Speed of processors 
 
•
But 
– The cost of a cache miss is very high 
– Typically requires 2 caches to bridge fast processor with large main 
memory 
 
•
It is very important to: 
– Manage registers properly 
– Manage caches properly 
 

Alex Aiken 
Managing Caches 
• Compilers are very good at managing registers 
– Much better than a programmer could be 
 
• Compilers are not good at managing caches 
– This problem is still left to programmers 
– It is still an open question how much a compiler can 
do to improve cache performance 
 
• Compilers can, and a few do, perform some cache 
optimizations 

Alex Aiken 
Managing Caches 
• Consider the loop 
for(j := 1; j < 10; j++) 
for(i=1; i<1000000; i++)  
a[i] *= b[i]

Managing Caches 
• Consider the program: 
for(i=1; i<1000000; i++)  
    for(j := 1; j < 10; j++) 
a[i] *= b[i] 
– Computes the same thing 
– But with much better cache behavior 
– Might be more than 10x faster  
 
• A compiler can perform this loop interchange optimization
