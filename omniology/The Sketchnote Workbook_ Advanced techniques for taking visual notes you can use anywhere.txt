PRAISE FOR THE SKETCHNOTE WORKBOOK
“The practical lessons in The Sketchnote Workbook make it easy and fun 
for anyone to leverage visual note taking to help them remember more, 
communicate better, and develop ideas more completely.”
	
— Todd Henry, author of Die Empty
“If you want to succeed in capturing and communicating your ideas, 
you need to read this book. Because it’s not merely a book: 
It’s a blueprint for a new way of thinking, and it’s fantastically useful.”
	
— Daniel Coyle, The New York Times best-selling author of 
The Talent Code and The Little Book of Talent
“Mike has created a resource that will inspire anyone to take their doodling to a new level 
and begin using sketchnoting in every aspect of their lives. After reading this book, 
I know my recipe cards and travel journals will never look the same again!”
	
— C.C. Chapman, author of Amazing Things Will Happen
“Mike Rohde wants you to understand a simple idea: Drawing aids thinking. 
Or, even better, drawing IS thinking. I fully agree with him: Pen and paper amplify our 
thinking when we use them to record what we see, and to reflect on what it means. 
This book, as its predecessor, The Sketchnote Handbook, will not just make 
you a better artist, it’ll make you a better thinker.”
	
— Alberto Cairo, author of The Functional Art
“I present information as narrated visuals so Mike’s approach makes a lot of sense to me. 
Visuals are key to understanding complexity, and the combination of images and text
as notes is always more effective than notes alone. 
Sometimes they are more effective than the original presentation.”
— Horace Dediu, founder of Asymco
“We humans are visual! So if you want to build your creativity and communication skills 
in order to facilitate the most powerful business meetings and give genius presentations, 
then The Sketchnote Workbook is one of the most fun and effective ways I know to do it. ”
	
— Mark Bowden, president of TRUTHPLANE® Communication Training 
and author of Winning Body Language
“Learning to capture the world in pictures and words changed my life, but it took me years 
of trial and error. How I wish I’d had Mike Rohde’s generous books as guides!”
— Austin Kleon, author of The New York Times best-seller Steal Like an Artist

This book is dedicated to Gail, Nathan, Linnea, Landon, 
Mom, Dad, and all of my dear friends and community.
I couldn’t have created this book without your support. 
We did it!

THE SKETCHNOTE WORKBOOK WAS GOING GREAT, until it turned upside-down 
with a family medical emergency halfway through its creation.  Without a doubt, 
the supportive network and amazing editors and publisher kept this book you’re 
reading  alive. My deepest thanks go to family, friends, colleagues, and the 
sketchnote community for supporting us when everything seemed against us. 
GAIL, you’re the reason I do the work I do. We’ve been through some painful, 
difficult days in this season of our lives, but we’re hanging in there. Thanks for 
your consistent, amazing support of what I love to do.  I love you!
NATHAN, LINNEA, AND LANDON, thanks for your support as I worked on a 
second book project. My wish for you is that the work I’m doing makes you very 
proud and that you love telling people your daddy wrote some pretty cool books.
NIKKI MCDONALD, thanks for being my biggest fan and sticking with me, believing 
in me, and working so hard to make this second book come to life. In spite of all 
the challenges we’ve faced together, you’ve been steady. I’m so proud of having 
worked with you to create two amazing books that are like nothing else.
JAN SEYMOUR, I’ve had a blast having you as my editor. You’ve embraced my 
book from the start and together we’ve made this book even better than The 
Sketchnote Handbook. Thanks for cheering me on  when things seemed darkest.
PEACHPIT, your team was my secret weapon, once again. Thank you, Liz Welch 
for your eagle eye, James Minkin for another perfect index, Tracey Croom 
for making this a superb-looking book, and Eric Geoffroy for providing expert 
knowledge to create another fantastic video.
DAVID FUGATE, I appreciate your guidance as my agent through another book 
project. Thanks for answering every crazy question I come up with.
BRIAN ARTKA, thanks for telling my story with video and for being a great friend. 
You are always willing to push me to do my best and achieve excellence. I wouldn’t 
want to tell a story through video with anyone else.

MIKE ROHDE has a passion for simple and usable
design solutions. That passion, along with his lifelong
habit of recording concepts and observations
through sketching and doodling, inspired him to
develop sketchnotes—a practical art that translates
simple and complex ideas into easily recalled bits
of information. 
Professionally, Mike focuses on user interface, 
user experience, visual design, and icon design for mobile and web applications
at Gomoll Research + Design in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Mike’s popular first book, The Sketchnote Handbook, convinces people around 
the world to become sketchnoters every day. Translated into German, Russian, 
Chinese, and Czech, it guides readers in using their natural visual capabilities to 
create sketchnotes for better understanding, and to have fun taking notes.
He enjoys speaking publicly about his passion for sketchnoting, sketching, and 
visual thinking skills at venues across the United States.
In his illustration practice, Mike uses his unique drawing style to amplify and 
clarify ideas. His work is featured in REWORK and REMOTE, two best-selling 
books by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson; The $100 Startup, a best-
selling book by Chris Guillebeau; and The Little Book of Talent by Daniel Coyle.
Community and sharing are important cornerstones of Mike’s philosophy, as 
evidenced by the creation of The Sketchnote Army, a website dedicated to 
finding and showcasing sketchnotes and sketchnoters from around the world.
Mike has also shared his thinking, design process, and samples of his design and 
illustration work at his personal website, rohdesign.com, since 2003.
Mike lives with his wife, Gail, and children, Nathan, Linnea, and Landon, just 
outside of Milwaukee. He’s an avid Green Bay Packers fan.

CONTENTS


A YEAR AND A HALF AGO, THE SKETCHNOTE HANDBOOK WAS 
RELEASED INTO THE WORLD. Frankly, I was nervous about the launch. I 
had no idea how my first book would be received.
Boy, was I wrong to worry! The Sketchnote Handbook launched to immediate 
excitement from its readers. I received a constant stream of positive social media 
mentions, encouraging email messages, and more positive book reviews than I 
would have imagined. It was an awesome experience.
Invitations to appear on podcasts came in while reviews were posted on blogs and 
websites. Within a few months, Peachpit Press had to print more copies of the 
Handbook video edition due to brisk sales.
German and Russian publishers licensed and printed Handbook translations, 
which became hits in those countries, while Czech and Chinese publishers 
licensed the book for their own native versions of the Handbook.
I spoke on sketchnoting in Portland, Austin, San Antonio, and Chicago, selling out of 
the books I’d brought with me. I was stoked when Moleskine reached out to create a 
limited-edition custom sketchbook to give away at SXSW in Austin.
All I could think was, “Wow, this book is a hit!” And I still receive positive feedback 
from people all over the world. 
Why such positivity? Business owners, consultants, designers, developers, 
writers, doctors, teachers, students, and parents all tell me how my Sketchnote 
Handbook has changed their mindset. For many, the book has encouraged them 
to more deeply engage in and understand the ideas they’re seeing and hearing.
People tell me that sketchnoting has given them the freedom and flexibility to 
play with ideas, enabling them to create meaningful visual documents that help 
them better understand and remember ideas and experiences.
INTRODUCTION
xii

The constant flow of positive feedback, blended with my desire to share more 
ways to apply sketchnotes, inspired me to write The Sketchnote Workbook.
WHAT IS THE SKETCHNOTE WORKBOOK?
Capturing meeting notes or sessions at conferences is a great way for readers to 
immediately apply sketchnoting techniques and see great value in the approach. 
The hundreds of sketchnotes I’ve seen since the release of the Handbook verify it.
But there are still many more ways sketchnotes can be used that I want to share.
As a veteran designer, I use sketchnotes for idea generation and idea mapping 
daily. For years I’ve created travel and food sketchnotes that transport me back 
to memorable experiences.
My food sketchnotes from Portland, Oregon
xiii

But it’s not just me. Friends in the sketchnoting community constantly share how 
they use sketchnotes to document processes, plan projects, and capture ideas in 
books, movies, TV shows, and sporting events.
I’ve collected the techniques I’ve learned from fellow sketchnoters in the 
community, waiting for the right time and place to share them. You’ll find this 
workbook full of new sketchnoting ideas, plenty of worksheets, and a range of 
challenges designed to rapidly improve your sketchnoting skills.
My hope is that by working through this book, you’ll be inspired to try new 
sketchnoting ideas. I’d love to see you adopt advanced drawing techniques to tackle 
the tougher sketchnoting challenges you’ve been avoiding—until now.

HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
I’ve created this book and video to be enjoyed in one go, or used as a reference you 
can jump around in. If an idea grabs you, try it out! Experiment until it fits your 
way of working.
The ideas in this book are here for you to iterate on and improve. Worksheets and 
challenges in the book aren’t rigid or designed to have just one correct answer.
Rather, this book and its exercises should be seen as experiments and not 
assignments. Have fun playing and exploring!
JOIN THE COMMUNITY
As you explore ideas in this book, share your work with the sketchnoting 
community. We’re welcoming and encouraging to everyone. Start at The 
Sketchnote Handbook Flickr group, flickr.com/groups/thesketchnotehandbook 
and then stop by The Sketchnote Army, SketchnoteArmy.com.
You’ll see the work of many others that will inspire and challenge you. I look 
forward to you joining the discussion!
REACH OUT
Please reach out and say hello. Check out my sketchnotes, read my writing, and 
sign up for my free newsletter at rohdesign.com. I’m a very active Twitter user, so 
reach out at twitter.com/rohdesign. 
I look forward to hearing how you apply ideas in the Workbook and seeing what 
new ideas you come up with for using sketchnotes in your own life.
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH TALK—IT’S TIME FOR ACTION. 
GRAB A NOTEBOOK AND A PEN. 
LET’S SKETCHNOTE!
