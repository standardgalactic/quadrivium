ACID-BASE HOMEOSTASIS 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
 
1. Describe how the body buffers free H+ that either  
enter from the diet or are generated by metabolism daily.   
 
2. Explain the role of the lungs and of HCO3-/CO2 buffer 
pair in maintaining the stability of the pH in the body.  
 
3. Explain the role of the kidney in reabsorbing filtered  
HCO3-  to maintain plasma pH.  
 
4. Explain the role of the kidney in reabsorbing filtered 
H+ to maintain plasma pH.  
 
 

ACIDS & BASES 
ACIDS - substances that donate protons (H+). 
BASES – substances that accept protons (H+). 
pH is a measure of free H+ concentration. 
 
One pH unit = 10 fold change in H+ concentration.   
For example, at pH 7.0 the H+ concentration is 10 -7 M. 
 
*** Body’s pH is usually pH 7.35 - 7.45 

pH HOMEOSTASIS 

IMPORTANT TERMS 
Acidemia 
 
- state in which arterial blood pH < 7.35 
 
Alkalemia  
 
- state in which arterial blood pH > 7.45  
 
Acidosis 
 
- process that lowers arterial blood pH to < 7.35 
 
Alkalosis 
 
- process that raises arterial blood pH to > 7.45 

LUNG VERSUS KIDNEY 
Ratio of HCO3 to CO2 determines pH! 
As PaCO2 increases, more acidic 
As PaCO2 decreases, more basic 
 
As HCO3
- decreases, more acidic 
As HCO3
- increases, more basic  
H2O + CO2        H2CO3         H+ + HCO3
-  

REABSORBTION OF  
FILTERED HCO3
- in PCT 
PCT reabsorbs 70-80% HCO3
- 
Requires carbonic  
anhydrase activity 

INTERCALATED CELLS IN  
DCT & CD BALANCE pH  
2 types of intercalated cells (A and B) 
act to balance body’s pH .  
 
Type A secrete H+ (Acid urine)  
 
Type B secrete HCO3
- (Basic urine) 
 
ATP 
H+ 
K+ 

1. Daily diet and metabolism generates a net  
increase  in acids.  
 
2. The kidneys with the lungs maintain the body’s  
pH by regulating the HCO3-/CO2 buffer pair. The lungs  
exert an immediate effect by controlling PCO2; the  
kidneys exert a slower effect by controlling HCO3-  
and H+ concentration.  
 
3. The kidneys maintain acid-base homeostasis by  
reabsorbing filtered bicarbonate and excreting either 
bicarbonate or protons depending on the body’s needs.
