AS A YEAR ENDS, people get sentimental. 
Review the past, see what went right 
and what went wrong. I say, to hell with 
looking back. It’s all about the future.
While 2017 brought us some great 
hardware, 2018 is going to be even better. 
I feel this is the year when all the exciting 
innovation will happen. Case in point: 
AMD’s Radeon chief jumped ship and 
went to Intel. Days after, Intel announced 
that it plans to work on discrete GPUs! 
Are we going to see three main players in 
the graphics market? I hope so.
2018 will also be the year when VR 
gets really serious. Headsets are going 
wireless with full inside-out tracking that 
lets you move around in as much space 
as you can afford. This will force wireless 
video standards to improve. I hope that 
once this happens, content will improve.
Other fantastical things I’m looking 
forward to? Better screens. This means 
we’ll see screens with higher resolutions 
and higher refresh rates. And higher 
refresh rates aren’t just for gaming. They 
make a huge impact on the desktop, too. 
If you’ve never moved a window at 120Hz, 
you’re missing out! In fact, the screen is 
our number one driver of the PC. And to 
drive the increased pixel density, GPUs 
will need to really up the ante.
And wouldn’t you know—it’s all very 
convenient that we’re going to have three 
major players making GPUs now. Good 
times ahead!

Rivals to collaborate on hybrid mobile chips
Intel and AMD Inside
die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB) 
technology. This does pretty 
much what the name says—it 
links together components on a 
single die with high-speed die-
to-die interconnects. Coupled 
with the HBM2, it’ll give the GPU 
real room to breathe. 
Intel’s 
own 
efforts 
at 
onboard graphics have never 
really sparkled. This deal gives 
it the missing piece it needs to 
power mobile, NUC, and other 
skinny hardware that has the 
oomph to play games without 
the need for extra silicon. 
On the surface, it may look as 
if Intel is getting the better deal 
here, getting much-needed GPU 
technology, and giving its own 
APUs an edge over the Ryzen 
Mobile. However, Intel already 
has 70 percent of the integrated 
GPU market, and current Ryzen 
Mobile chips aren’t aimed at the 
gaming market. No, AMD and 
Intel both have another rival: 
Nvidia, a company that has 
70 percent of the discrete GPU 
market. This deal does Nvidia 
no favors; sales that the hybrid 
steals from the discrete GPU 
market are more likely to be 
Nvidia’s loss than AMD’s, which 
will get a cut into the bargain. 
Intel has always lacked high-
end GPUs, specifically ones that 
can compete in the lucrative 
server and AI markets. Here it’s 
Nvidia, rather than AMD, that is 
standing in the company’s way. 
How long this hybrid design will 
last is questionable. Intel has 
just hired one of the world’s 
best 
GPU 
architects, 
and 
created a new department for 
him to run: the Core and Visual 
Computing Group. Something 
is brewing here of much more 
importance in the long run—
another attempt at an high-
end GPU architecture is the 
supposition. Intel has tried this 
before. The last attempt was 
Larrabee, which was canceled 
in 2009, just as the first silicon 
appeared. It suffered from 
being based around x86 cores, 
which just weren’t suited to 
the job. This time around, the 
company has a man who knows 
how to build a modern GPU 
from the ground up.
AMD and Intel have not 
suddenly become good friends 
either; only this summer, Intel 
was trash-talking AMD as 
having a poor track record, and 
being an inconsistent supplier 
(despite making plans for it to 
become one of its own behind 
the scenes). This move is an 
expedient one by both parties.
The first fruits of the union 
are expected in the first quarter 
of 2018, codename Hades 
Canyon. They feature a quad-
core Kaby Lake H, and have 
tentatively been put at running 
at 68W and 96W. “Leaked” 
benchmarks show performance 
levels between a Radeon RX 
560 and 570. Expect thin, light 
laptops with some impressive 
gaming abilities to follow. –CL
AMD AND INTEL do not make 
a habit of cooperating. That’s 
putting it mildly; they enjoy a 
somewhat heated rivalry. It 
hasn’t stopped them cutting 
a deal, though—Intel is going 
to put a Radeon GPU into its 
mobile chips. Shock. Intel says 
the deal will bring together the 
“Intel Core H series processor, 
second-generation 
High 
Bandwidth Memory (HBM2), and 
a custom-to-Intel third-party 
discrete graphics chip from 
AMD’s Radeon Technologies 
Group.” Intel has also managed 
to get hold of AMD’s top GPU 
architect, Raja Koduri, to be a 
senior VP, and lead its high-end 
graphics development team—
quite an acquisition. 
It is the first time since 1980 
that the pair has collaborated 
over anything except writing 
industry standards. It has also 
been some time brewing. A year 
or so ago, rumors started that 
the two were in cahoots over 
GPUs, and both sides went to 
the trouble of denying it. Issuing 
strident denials is, of course, 
pretty 
suspicious, 
so 
this 
announcement hasn’t exactly 
come as a huge surprise. 
The new hybrid design will 
be the first mobile model to 
use Intel’s Embedded Multi-
A year or so ago, rumors 
started that the two were 
in cahoots over GPUs. 
Intel’s Kaby Lake H sharing silicon with an AMD GPU is as unlikely a 
pairing as in any sitcom, given how the two snipe at each other.

MICROSOFT’S SURFACE 2 is a nice bit 
of gear, and its ability to run games 
is impressive. As it should be—the 
15-inch model comes with an Nvidia 
1060 and costs $2,500. This ability comes at a price, though: The battery drains 
even when plugged in. Yep, turn the Power Mode slider up to max, and start 
playing a demanding game, and the battery starts to drain by 10 percent or more 
every hour. It transpires that the power supply (labeled as 102W) can’t cope with 
full-on games, which push the GPU into using 80W or more, leaving little power 
for much else. It won’t run ﬂat; it throttles back enough to keep you alive. 
Embarrassing for a machine marketed as high-power gear, Microsoft says 
it was designed to deliver “unmatched power and performance.” Only clearly it 
wasn’t thoroughly tested at the limits running games, despite the promotional 
material including images of hipsters gaming. –CL

APPLE AR BY 2019
APPLE IS WORKING ON an aggressive roadmap for 
augmented reality headsets, which it is hoped will be ready 
for 2019. It launched the developer’s kit, ARKit, in 2017. Unlike 
existing platforms, this won’t be tethered, or running from a smartphone, but rather a fully 
integrated standalone headset, complete with its own OS, and all the requisite hardware. 
CEO Tim Cook believes that “AR is going to change the way we use technology forever.”
Apple has just spent $30 million on buying Vrvana, which produced the acclaimed Totem 
headset. This was never ofﬁcially released, and instead of the overlay system of HoloLens, 
it uses cameras to capture the immediate environment, then mixes the results for display. 
There’s no transparent overlay effect; you get a full mix of real and virtual in one, as on a 
smartphone. This could be a clue to how the new kit will work. Apple might be a little late to 
the party, but it does has an enviable record of making cool stuff people want. –CL
FULLY STANDALONE 
HEADSET PLANNED
STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT II has caused a 
disturbance in the force, and not in the way 
that Electronic Arts wanted. It’s all down to 
how hero characters are unlocked. The likes 
of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader originally 
required crystals, which you earned in play, 
or bought. It took about 40 hours of play 
to unlock a single hero character. If you 
wanted to max-out on everything, it would 
take thousands of hours of play, unless you 
reached for real money. A system of Loot 
Crates also attracted criticism for being, 
essentially, akin to gambling. These can also 
be purchased, but the contents are random, 
making the process basically a slot machine.
Those unwilling to spend the extra 
felt unfairly disadvantaged by richer or 
less principled players who simply buy a 
bucketload of Loot Crates and start crafting 
high-power upgrades from the start. There 
followed an online storm. EA reacted poorly 
at ﬁrst, delivering an unconvincing rationale 
that merely added fuel to the online ﬁre. This 
was followed by a reduction in the number 
of points required. Finally, it dropped the 
in-game payment system altogether. In a 
statement it said that it was “sorry we didn’t 
get this right.” All upgrades and characters 
now have to be earned through gameplay. 
However, EA also said that the ability to 
purchase upgrades in-game may become 
available at a later date. 
Big games cost seriously big money to 
make, and in-game micropayments can be 
lucrative. However, they’ve previously been 
a feature of mobile games that are very 
cheap, or free to play. If you have to pay to 
win, having already paid, expect trouble. 
We may well have Disney to thank for EA’s 
climb-down; rumor has it that its executives 
were frustrated at the level of unhappiness 
toward one of its prime assets. It’s still not 
fully ﬁxed either. The Loot Crate system 
adds a randomness that doesn’t necessarily 
reward dedicated play. You can still grind out 
hours for little if you get the wrong drop. –CL

Intel Makes Major Moves 
in Graphics and Learning
And this isn’t a low-end graphics solution. Current 
indications are that the top conﬁguration will have 
1,536 AMD GCN cores, clocked at 1,000–1,150MHz. 
That’s somewhat slower than an RX 570, but for a 
laptop, it’s a huge step up from Intel’s previous HD 
Graphics and Iris solutions. More interesting is 
that the solution will also utilize HBM2 memory, 
potentially 2–4GB, which will provide signiﬁcant 
VRAM bandwidth advantages compared to previous 
integrated solutions. The only real question 
remaining is what sort of power requirements the 
chips will have, and how much the laptops will cost.
That’s a huge announcement, but it’s only the 
beginning. Days later, it was revealed that AMD’s 
Raja Koduri, former head of the Radeon Technology 
Group, was leaving the company. He will now be the 
chief architect and senior VP of Intel’s new Core and 
Visual Computing Group. Raja says he’s “incredibly 
excited to join the Intel team and have the opportunity 
to drive a uniﬁed architecture vision across its 
world-leading IP portfolio that helps accelerate the 
data revolution.” That sounds as though Intel wants 
to use his talent to do more than just faster graphics, 
which brings us to the third piece of news.
Intel already has products that compete in the 
machine learning and supercomputing arena, 
speciﬁcally its Xeon Phi processors. These are 
THERE HAS BEEN A SERIOUS SHAKEUP in the world of graphics technology 
this past month, with three major announcements. First, Intel announced 
a partnership with AMD, where it will integrate a custom Radeon graphics 
solution on a future Intel Core CPU. It will use Intel’s Embedded Multi-
Die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB) for communicating with a mobile AMD 
graphics solution. The goal is thinner and more powerful gaming laptops.
found in many of the world’s fastest 
supercomputers, including China’s 
Tianhe-2, which currently occupies 
the number two position on the 
Top 500. During the past year, Intel 
also acquired Nervana Systems, a 
company working on a custom ASIC 
for machine learning applications. 
Intel’s upcoming Nervana NNP 
(Neural Network Processor) will 
be focused on driving performance 
even higher, though Intel notes that 
standard performance metrics for 
deep learning don’t tell the whole 
story, and has thus far not revealed 
any speciﬁc performance ﬁgures.
The performance expectations 
for the Nervana NNP are high, and 
the retail products were slated to 
begin shipping by the end of 2017. 
Early hardware already exists, with 
Intel working to tune performance, 
and the results must be promising, 
because Intel also announced that 
Knights Hill, the 10nm successor 
to the current 14nm Xeon Phi 
line (aka Knights Landing), has 
been canceled. Knights Hill was 
slated 
for 
the 
Department 
of 
Energy’s Aurora supercomputer, 
with a performance target of 180 
PetaFLOPS, but the contract has 
been rewritten with a goal of being 
one of the ﬁrst Exascale systems 
(capable of at least one ExaFLOPS) 
in 2021. Whether that will come via 
Nervana or some other product 
isn’t clear, but it seems likely.
Given the growth in machine 
learning 
and 
supercomputing 
applications, 
where 
graphics 
technologies such as Nvidia’s Tesla 
solutions are major competitors, 
part of Raja Kudori’s task may be 
to unify the various solutions that 
Intel already offers, helping to come 
up with fewer products that deliver 
higher performance. Or perhaps 
Raja won’t be doing much with the 
Nervana or Xeon Phi products, and 
will instead work solely to improve 
Intel’s graphics IP. Regardless, Intel 
has made a lot of waves, and we look 
forward to seeing where this leads.
Raja Kudori’s task may be to 
come up with fewer products 
delivering higher performance.
Intel’s mobile Core processors will 
integrate AMD GPUs and HBM2.

Despite the drama surrounding operating systems, 
the web browser is central to today’s computing 
experience. For most PC users, the majority of work 
and social media use, and media consumption is 
handled by a web browser. For the Linux community, 
this has meant using one of the two good defaults that 
come in most distributions: Firefox or Chromium.
For years, Chromium (and Chrome) have reigned 
supreme due to page loading speed and lower 
memory use. But while Firefox was slower than 
Chrome, Mozilla’s browser focused on security and 
privacy. Users could be conﬁdent that telemetry data 
wasn’t being fed back to Big Brother in Mountain 
View to be used to generate ad revenue. Firefox’s 
solid base is implemented in the Tor Browser, for 
instance. But for some reason, Firefox was plagued 
by sluggish page loads and memory usage, that sent 
people scrambling back to Google’s warm embrace.
On November 14, Mozilla released Firefox 57—or 
Firefox Quantum—for mobile and PC platforms. No 
longer wishing to play second ﬁddle, Firefox is now 
much snappier and easier on the RAM. Its blog says 
that contributors triaged some 369 performance-
related bugs alone. The UI remains 
fairly minimalistic, though Firefox 
adopted a ﬂatter appearance that 
helps unify the mobile and desktop 
experience. Speaking of desktop, 
Firefox 57 looks great on HiDPI 
screens on GNOME with Wayland.
One thing I ﬁnd handy out of 
the box is Firefox 57’s screenshot 
tool. If you’ve ever used a web 
clipper from Evernote or OneNote, 
Firefox’s implementation will feel

Firefox Is Back With Its 
Quantum Update
DEAR CHROME USERS: If you haven’t tried the new 
Firefox, give it a go. Sure, some Chrome power users 
might not be convinced, but for privacy-conscious 
users who grit their teeth and use Chrome for its 
speed, Firefox 57 may upset the status quo.
convenience features, making it 
easy to save and recall information 
in your browser again.
While this update has a lot to enjoy, 
it falls short in one key area: There 
is little ofﬁcial support for ofﬂine or 
“standalone” Firefox apps. One of 
the coolest things about Chromium 
is that I can “install” a web app, 
such as Evernote or Spotify, add it 
to my application menu, and launch 
it in a standalone window (without 
tabs or a toolbar), so it feels like a 
native desktop app. Work has been 
done to be able to make Firefox 
compatible with Chrome apps, 
but the implementation is not as 
simple as it is in Chrome. Support 
for standalone Chrome apps is 
the main reason I will likely keep 
Chromium around.
I also noticed that Firefox 57 
still 
mucked 
up 
my 
YubiKey 
authentication when logging into my 
Google account. After several tries, 
I had to start Chromium in Incognito 
mode just to see if it was a bad USB 
port, or if my YubiKey had gone 
on the fritz. Sure enough, Firefox 
couldn’t handle Google’s two-factor 
authentication. Logging into the 
LastPass extension presented no 
problems when the app asked for 
the YubiKey two-factor auth.
I have to say, I’m impressed with 
the new Firefox, and I’m looking 
forward to using it more as a daily 
driver. After all, if Mozilla’s zippy 
new browser somehow manages to 
piss me off, Chromium will be there 
to pick up the slack.
Firefox looks great, loading pages lightning-fast.

If you’re ill-of-ears, you may never have considered the point in a serious audio smackdown 
between (arguably) the three major formats in digital tune management. But listen 
up: There’s a lot to learn here. That dusty folder full of MP3s from the original Napster 
days? That’s not the way music was meant to be heard, stored, or shared. So, let’s pull 
apart those formats, and ﬁnd the wins and losses in various categories, all while keeping 
the underwater garble of WMA at arm’s length, conveniently ignoring the fact that it has a 
lossless version that’s actually not the worst thing we’ve ever heard.
MP3 vs. FLAC vs. Ogg Vorbis
Compression Format
FLAC’s lossless compression can be 
hard to get your head around—how can 
the ﬁle size of music be compressed 
with no loss of sound quality? Think of 
it like ZIP compression; squashing ofﬁce 
ﬁles together reduces their size, but you 
don’t lose chunks of your PowerPoint 
presentation at the other end. Obviously, 
the fact that FLAC is digital means vinyl 
lovers will growl about the superiority 
of analog over the grainy waveforms of 
digital music, but FLAC’s one-to-one 
replication means dedicated lovers 
of needles bouncing around in dusty 
grooves may question their direction.
MP3 and Ogg Vorbis put up a good 
ﬁght. MP3’s method of perceptual noise 
shaping (chopping out frequencies your 
ear can’t hear) can compress audio by 
around 10–12 times without a noticeable 
loss in quality—you miss some subtlety, 
perhaps, but it’s not the swirling mess 
of compressed WMA. Ogg Vorbis, if 
anything, does slightly better, using a 
different psychoacoustic compression 
method from MP3, and concentrating 
on quality ratings rather than bitrates, 
which can make tracks of comparable 
size sound signiﬁcantly better.
Winner: 
Ogg Vorbis
File Size
For the most part, this factor isn’t a 
major concern now that we’re ﬁlling 
every available inch of our machines 
with an extra terabyte or 12, but your 
primary use of discrete audio ﬁles likely 
won’t be on the desktop—it’ll be on 
the move. And mobile devices, be they 
smartphones or the new generation of 
dedicated players, inevitably offer up 
pathetic storage options. 
FLAC produces, by its nature, the 
largest ﬁles by far of the compression 
methods here. If you generate your own, 
FLAC ﬁles are typically smaller than 
directly copying a CD into a bit-for-bit 
WAV ﬁle, but not by a massive amount. 
The usual ratio is around 10:6. Expect a 
typical track to weigh in at around 30MB, 
although commercial hi-res ﬁles tend to 
trend toward far larger sizes.
MP3 and Ogg Vorbis are equally 
miraculous when it comes to squashing 
listenable music into a small space— 
tracks that are listenable tend to weigh 
in at around 4–5MB, depending on the 
encoder used to compress them, and 
the speciﬁc settings fed into it. Arguably, 
Ogg Vorbis offers the best quality-to-
size ratio, but it’s a rather subjective win.
Winner: 
Ogg Vorbis
Freedom
Compressed music really came into its 
own with the popularity of MP3, despite 
a ton of other equally decent formats 
existing at the time. Blame WinAmp, the 
lousiness of WMA and RealAudio, and 
the fact that MP3 was easy to decode 
on the lesser processors of yesteryear. 
The problem is, MP3, for all its ubiquity, 
isn’t free. Or at least, it hasn’t been: 
The ﬁnal patent is due to expire right 
about now, and Technicolor’s licensing 
program for the codec ended in April 
2017. There’s now no need to illegally 
download 
the 
LAME 
encoder, 
no 
squabbles at trade shows, and the 
potential for MP3 to make a proper 
comeback. Not that it should.
The other two formats are both 
actually free. There’s a clue in FLAC’s 
name: It’s the Free Lossless Audio 
Codec. It’s free, as is Ogg. Both FLAC 
and Ogg Vorbis emerged from the open 
source community, and while they’re 
both venerable (the various technical 
aspects of Ogg’s bitstream format, for 
example, were frozen some 17 years 
ago), you’re free to chop either protocol 
up and create your own format if you’re 
a little bit crazy.

Compatibility
MP3 has been around for a long time, 
and it’s beyond rare for a device that 
supports audio playback not to support 
MP3—licensing fees and patents or not. 
There are MP3 decoder chips out there 
that can be tossed into all manner of 
electronics. Ogg Vorbis has moderately 
lower support, but only by a fraction—
you might ﬁnd a few Chinese players 
that can’t manage it. FLAC is, by a small 
margin, the least supported format, 
although each FLAC ﬁle cleverly builds 
in the algorithm required to decompress 
it; so, barring DRM-locked tracks, future 
FLACs should play back on any device 
that currently supports the format.
It’s also worth considering sharing. 
Digital distribution services such as 
Bandcamp demand a lossless format 
like FLAC on upload, since transcoding 
to a different format is relatively simple 
given a perfect master—so, if you’re 
creating audio, FLAC is a must. However, 
podcasts tend to be distributed in MP3, 
because that’s what most catchers/
players expect, it can be squashed 
small, and the effect its compression 
algorithms have on the spoken word 
isn’t quite as onerous as it is on music. 
Winner: 
MP3
Resolution
Though technically lossy, MP3s encoded 
at 320Kb/s, 48,000Hz challenge all 
but the fussiest ears to pick out the 
compression; at the standard 128Kb/s or 
192Kb/s resolution, though, MP3 creates 
a much ﬂatter sound. Check out Ryan 
Maguire’s experiments in rendering 
the audio lost in MP3 compression at 
http://vimeo.com/ryanmaguire for an 
audible example. Ogg Vorbis is also 
lossy, but if quality settings are pushed 
up during compression, it’s much more 
adept at retaining subtle sounds. Both 
can employ variable bitrate encoding 
to maximize compression, with a little 
extra attention paid to complex areas.
FLAC is the king, and there’s a good 
reason it forms the basis of most hi-res 
digital distribution networks. You can 
push it far beyond the limits of human 
hearing, and as it’s lossless, beautiful 
compositions can’t be ruined by audible 
artefacts. It’s also built for accuracy; 
tiny errors in rendering are contained 
and don’t ruin the whole track, and the 
checksums of compressed ﬁles can be 
compared against other copies to ensure 
they’re absolutely correct. If you’re not 
using FLAC, you’re doing it wrong.
Winner: 
FLAC
It’s not a categorical win, because 
format use is a very subjective thing, 
but we’re giving it to FLAC. It’s well 
established, but ﬂexible and powerful 
enough that it’s poised to be the de 
facto audio format of the future, 
and if quality is your goal, there’s no 
substitute for a lossless format. Ogg 
Vorbis’s open nature is to its credit, 
and it’s certainly capable of some 
serious quality, but it’s always sat as an 
alternative rather than a leader—it’s 
MP3 for those who wouldn’t use MP3 
because of its closed, patented nature. 
With that negative seemingly now 
crossed off the list, it’s likely that Ogg 
Vorbis will fade even further.
MP3 itself probably isn’t going 
anywhere, because  it’s perfect for a 
number of practical uses, but its 
position as a carrier for music might be 
endangered. 
Companies 
such 
as 
Amazon are unlikely to stop distributing 
it any time soon, but consumer demand 
is going to swing toward quality rather 
than ﬁle size, and we see FLAC  
moving in—particularly if labels think 
they can charge a little more for  
better quality audio. 
 
And the
Winner Is…

Troublesome Gear
Hi Doc, I have an issue with
my PC, where its screen goes 
black and all its fans start 
spinning at maximum speed. 
The system stays like this 
and is unresponsive until I 
reset it. This seems to happen 
randomly; sometimes it goes 
black while I’m gaming, but 
I’ve also seen it act up at idle. 
I checked the CPU and GPU 
temperatures, and they look 
normal (low 30s C). I updated 
my graphics drivers, but to 
no avail.
Do you think this is a 
software issue, or related to 
hardware? I know the BIOS 
hasn’t been updated, but I’m 
worried about the system 
crashing mid-upgrade.
Otherwise, the PC ran 
great since I built it in 2014. 
The only upgrade I added 
was a GPU about one year 
ago, and the problem started 
about four months ago. Any 
suggestions are appreciated.
The system includes a Core 
i7-4790K, an Asus Z97-Deluxe 
motherboard with BIOS 1008, 
an EVGA GeForce GTX 1080, a 
Samsung 840 EVO SSD, WDC 
Red hard drives in RAID 1, 
16GB of Corsair DDR3, and 
Windows 10.  
–Chris
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: It 
sounds like this issue can be 
traced to your graphics card or 
the power it’s receiving. One 
spec you left out was your PSU. 
But since the problem happens 
under load and at idle, it’s 
probably not a lack of capacity.
In general, the Doc would 
advise double-checking 
the power connections to 
your GeForce GTX 1080 and 
motherboard, and ensure the 
PSU is connected to a quality 
surge protector or UPS. Worst 
case, try another power supply 
to see if the issue persists.
In this speciﬁc case, since 
you did mention owning an 
EVGA card, there’s another 
possibility to consider. Last 
year, the company conﬁrmed 
that a small number of 1080 
FTW cards suffer this exact 
problem. It’s caused by an 
ON Semiconductor VRM 
component operating out of 
spec, triggering over-current 
protection. If this turns out 
to be your culprit, EVGA 
should be willing to issue an 
RMA. Contact the company 
at support@evga.com to 
determine if your board might 
be one of the ones affected.
Should this clear up your 
stability issues, deﬁnitely 
update your motherboard’s 
BIOS. Version 1008 was 
released in May of 2014. Asus 
has something like 12 newer 
builds posted to its support 
site, the latest from April of 
2016, most of which mention 
improving system stability.
New GPU
Dear Doc, my wife and I just 
bought a new LG OLED TV 
(model OLED65C7P). My kids 
have a PS4 Pro hooked up to 
it, and I built a home theater 
PC about four years ago that 
I’d like to connect as well.
It contains an older AMD 
FX-8350 processor on an 
Asus Sabertooth 990FX 
motherboard, with 16GB 
of DDR3-1866 memory. A 
Samsung 850 EVO SSD has 
Windows 10 on it, while a 2TB 
WD Blue mechanical hard 
drive handles bulk storage 
duties. My power supply is a 
Turbo-Cool 860W. Currently, 
there’s a Radeon HD 6950 
graphics card installed, and 
I know it runs well at up to 
1080p. I was hoping to reuse 
as much of that hardware as 
possible, but I know the GPU 
is going to be an issue.
I am a little confused about 
the TV’s refresh rate, which 
LG claims is 120Hz. Of course, 
I want to make sure I pick the 
right graphics card to go into 
this computer. I play World 
of Tanks, Fallout 4, and Call 
of Duty: Inﬁnite Warfare, as 
well as online Steam games. 
I’m looking for the smoothest 
experience possible with all 
of the eye candy enabled. My 
budget is 800–1,000 bucks, so 
I don’t know whether I need 
one or even two graphics 
cards. Any advice you could 
give me, Doc, would be very 
much appreciated.
–Christopher Leach
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: Your 
TV natively supports 1920x1080 
at 60/120Hz or 4K at 30/60Hz 
input. Regardless of whether 
you’re targeting the lower or 
higher resolution, though, a 
Check with EVGA to be sure your  
1080 isn’t affected by a faulty component.

substantial graphics upgrade 
over the Radeon HD 6950 is 
certainly warranted.
The latest generation of 
DirectX 12-based games 
and VR experiences have 
soured the Doc to multi-GPU 
conﬁgurations. He would 
rather buy the fastest single-
GPU solution possible, and 
circumvent compatibility 
problems and issues with 
frame time variance altogether.
With that said, your budget 
leaves plenty of room for 
high-end graphics. GeForce 
GTX 1080 Ti cards start around 
$720. And in the games you’re 
talking about, they should easily 
hit 60fps at 4K using cranked-
up detail settings. If you’d prefer 
a lower resolution and higher 
refresh rate, one or two steps 
down Nvidia’s hierarchy would 
probably be ﬁne.
There’s something else 
to think about, though. While 
reusing old hardware is 
commendable, graphics cards 
intended for 4K gaming are 
meant to be paired with capable 
platforms. More than likely, an 
FX-8350 is going to bottleneck 
high-end GPUs from AMD 
or Nvidia. You’re better off 
diverting some of your budget 
toward a new Core i5 or Ryzen-
based CPU, corresponding 
motherboard, and DDR4 
memory. Then, snag something 
like a GeForce GTX 1070, 1070 
Ti, or Radeon RX Vega 56 with 
what’s left. The resulting 
combination should be much 
more balanced, enabling you to 
set aside the old conﬁguration 
for another purpose.
Stranger Things
Hi Doc, I have been trying to 
ﬁx an issue with a friend’s 
computer, which came to me 
pretty much dead. So, I started 
troubleshooting. Since the 
power supply seemed ﬁne, I 
pulled the RAM out and tried 
to turn the machine on. I got 
no response, not even a beep. 
I shut the system off and 
reinstalled its memory. Upon 
hitting the power switch, the 
PC booted up ﬁne.
Please help me explain the 
cause of this issue, because 
it’s bafﬂing me. I think the 
motherboard is to blame, but 
I’m not sure. –Jason Echelar
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
Although more information 
would certainly help the Doc 
narrow down your issue, this 
certainly sounds motherboard 
or memory-related.
Do you have the latest 
BIOS installed? It’s common 
for updates to include 
optimizations for memory 
compatibility. Make sure the 
memory isn’t overclocked from 
within the BIOS, which could 
cause it to exhibit intermittent 
stability problems. If you’re 
using a dual-channel memory 
kit, try running with one module 
installed to determine if there’s 
any difference between them. 
You might also want to try 
running MemTest86, which 
can help ferret out hard-to-
replicate memory faults.
Building a Monster
Doc, I’ll start off with a bit of 
ﬂattery. I’ve been a long-time 
subscriber, and I remember 
the good ol’ days when you had 
two versions of the publication 
(magazine alone, and another 
with an included software 
disc). But more importantly, 
I truly look forward to ﬁnding 
the magazine in my mailbox 
each month.
My question concerns 
a new rig I’m building. The 
components are coming 
together slowly, and currently 
include: an Intel Core 
i7-6900K, which I’d like to 
overclock to at least 4GHz, 
a Corsair H100i closed-loop 
liquid cooler, an ASRock X99X 
Killer motherboard, 64GB of 
G.Skill Trident Z DDR4-4000 
(8x 8GB), a Crucial 512GB 
M.2-based SSD, a Crucial 
525GB SSD for my operating 
system, a Crucial 1TB SSD for 
apps, two Toshiba 6TB hard 
drives in RAID 0 for user data, 
a GeForce GTX 1080 graphics 
card, a 1,000W power supply 
(haven’t decided on the brand 
yet), and Windows 10 64-bit.
That’s more or less the 
direction I want to go. I plan 
on getting back into video and 
photo editing, but am watching 
my money like everyone else. 
I did reach out to ASRock to 
see if the G.Skill memory 
kit would run at 4,000MT/s 
on my motherboard. But 
company representatives 
can only conﬁrm a maximum 
of 3,400MT/s based on their 
internal testing. Overclocking 
the Core i7 to 4GHz should be 
easy, though.
I’m anticipating a price 
drop once the Skylake-X 
chips become available. Any 
possible info you can pass 
along would be appreciated 
and respected. If there’s any 
way for you or someone else 
to test that memory overclock, 
even better. 
–George Cora
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: As 
you no doubt saw, George, 
Intel’s Skylake-X CPUs did have 
a big impact on pricing. This 
was almost certainly related 
to newfound competition 
from AMD and its Ryzen 
Threadripper models.
Today, you can get a 
10-core Core i9-7900X for 
less money than the i7-6900K 
you were eyeballing. It’s not 
an overclocking beast by any 
means. Intel’s use of thermal 
paste between its heat 
spreader and die negatively 
affects thermal transfer 
performance, causing the CPU 
to run hot. But 4GHz shouldn’t 
be too much of a challenge 
under a capable all-in-one 
liquid cooler. Alternately, 
Core i7-7820X gives you 
the same eight cores as 
the 6900K for $500 less.
Regardless of the CPU, 
don’t worry too much about 
a 4GT/s memory transfer 
rate. Intel’s high-end desktop 
platforms employ quad-
channel conﬁgurations. At 
2,666MT/s, you’re looking at a 
theoretical peak in excess of 
85GB/s. Jumping to a 128GB/s 
ceiling sounds huge, but your 
critical apps would need to be 
memory bandwidth-bound 
before you saw any advantage. 
Rock-solid stability is more 
important from a workstation, 
in the Doc’s opinion.
Two Antivirus Apps?
I have been told to never 
install two antivirus programs 
on the same computer at 
the same time. Could this be 
achieved without issues if you 
keep the one you’re not using 
zipped? I vaguely remember 
doing this years ago with a 
program I believe was called 
Oil Change. 
–Bob McElwain
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
Security professionals agree 
that it’s ill-advised to install 
any more than one antivirus 
utility at a time. Performance 
concerns are commonly cited. 
Even one security suite can 
tie up signiﬁcant processing 
and memory resources. Worst 
case, they’d trip over each 
other’s efforts. Not only do two 
antivirus apps have their own 
policies for dealing with bugs 
they ﬁnd on your computer, 
but they might also see each 
other as threats.
Modern A/V apps typically 
get their hooks deep into your 
operating environment, and 
can’t simply be compressed into 
an archive and tucked away. 
There is a handful of portable 
antivirus/malware scanners, 
such as ClamWin Portable, that 
you can download and save on 
to a thumb drive for manual 
detection. You wouldn’t have 
them installed on your PC, 
though. Instead, they’d be part 
of an IT toolkit for diagnosing an 
infected machine. 
ASRock’s Fatal1ty  
X99X Killer is no longer  
top-of-the-line. Try an  
LGA 2066 platform instead.

PREVIEW
Twelve months is all it took to see 
revolutionary change in the tech 
industry. With the race to greater core 
counts in mainstream processing, 
the release of Intel’s Optane SSD 
drives, Ethereum mining pushing up 
GPU prices, and more, 2017 was a 
particularly interesting year. But that’s 
in the past, and 2018 is the future, so 
what do the next 12 months look like? 
It’s time to sift through the hype, and 
get down to the nitty-gritty of what is 
going to make 2018 great.

IT’S A RARE OCCURRENCE for the hype train to be not 
quite as overwhelming as the potency of the product 
it represents. And with Jim Keller masterminding the 
development of Team Red’s latest architecture, AMD’s Zen 
CPU lineup was hardly going to be a dud. However, none of 
us truly knew what to expect from the company that had 
otherwise disappointed us on the computational front for 
the previous six years. 
Ryzen was, and still is, a masterpiece. A once-in-a-
decade reinvention of a product. Something that AMD 
so desperately needed in order to assure its own future. 
Its effect on consumer computing has been vast and 
far reaching, pushing Intel to act, stop resting on its 
laurels, and raise its core counts higher, if only to retain 
anything like the market share it once had. And, at last, 
after six long years of waiting, there’s ﬁnally a choice—
consumers actually have a decision to make once again. 
Both processor manufacturers now provide options more 
than capable of succeeding the platforms of yesteryear. 
Whether it’s Skylake X or Threadripper for workstations, 
Coffee Lake or Ryzen 7 in the mid-range, or Ryzen 3 or 
the Core i3s at the budget end of the spectrum, there’s a 
processor for everyone.
However, Ryzen certainly isn’t perfect, and even 
Don Woligroski, AMD’s Desktop CPU Marketing Manager, 
when speaking to YouTuber JokerProductions, stated 
that Ryzen was a “worst case scenario” for AMD. A new 
architecture on a new node brings up a whole plethora 
of issues, including memory and BIOS bugs, power draw 
woes, and overall lower frequencies than what were 
originally intended.
Ryzen 2, known as Pinnacle Ridge, looks to correct 
these issues. Rumored to be released some time in the 
ﬁrst quarter of 2018, we’re expecting a drop to a 12nm 
production node (down from Ryzen’s current 14nm), higher 
base clock frequencies, lower power draw, and two brand 
new X470 and B450 chipsets to accompany the retention of 
the AM4 socket (allowing for backward compatibility with 
previous chipsets). All of which should bring up single-core 
performance to Skylake and Kaby Lake levels, and in turn 
enhance multicore performance as well. On top of that, it 
should also help reﬁne the platform further, with enhanced 
memory support, better overclocking, and improved 
motherboard design, and potentially also allow AMD to 
introduce more PCIe lanes to its newer chipsets.
It would also be highly surprising if we didn’t see AMD 
launch its range of Vega-powered Raven Ridge APUs 
some time around Q1 as well. Hopefully, they’ll bring 
more options to those interested in building a budget-
friendly low-spec gaming machine or media PC. Rumor 
has it, these should feature four Zen cores (or two Ryzen 
core complexes, with support for 8MB of L3 cache, and 
multithreading), and 11 Vega GPU cores, and should prove 
to be quite the beast at 1080p low to mid-range gaming.
REFINING SUCCESS
Intel may be rattled, but AMD needs to 
cement its success with revision
Zen is only the start of what Ryzen has to offer.
The genius of 
Ryzen lies within 
its Infinity Fabric 
interconnect.

BUT WHAT ABOUT our dear Team Blue? Well, Intel’s hardly 
out for the count—it still holds on to a massive chunk 
of that processor market share, and with that in tow, 
pumping more money into R&D is an easy task for the chip-
making giant. Combine that with its Core architecture still 
being far superior to AMD when it comes to single-core 
performance, and all is not lost. Coffee Lake proved to 
us that Intel was willing to listen, and at last we’ve ﬁnally 
witnessed more cores piled into its smaller form factor 
chips. With the 1151 socket now hosting up to six cores and 
12 threads on its highest Core i7 ﬂagship parts, the future 
certainly looks bright for those looking to stick with Intel. 
So, what’s next? Well, Coffee Lake is Intel’s fourth 14nm 
product, and the start of its eighth generation of processors. 
Although the company has conﬁrmed that Coffee Lake is 
the last of its 14nm product line (not including the Kaby 
Lake R 14nm++ mobile refresh), confusingly, it’s not the 
last of its eighth-gen chips. Cannon Lake will also fall 
under the same categorical nomenclature, even though 
it’s a process shrink down to 10nm. Confused? You’re not 
the only one. Typically, when Intel still ran its Tick Tock 
methodology, it would release an architecture, then shrink 
the process, with each step being a new “generation” 
of processors. Although Tick Tock was recently retired 
for PAO (Process, Architecture, Optimization, each step 
still being a new “generation”), Cannon Lake’s 10nm 
process shrink still falls under the “Eighth” generation 
of processors, according to Intel. 
From this, we can predict two things. Firstly, that 
Cannon Lake’s 10nm processors should be backward 
compatible with the Z370 chipset and socket; and secondly, 
that process shrinks will no longer be deﬁned as a new 
generation, presumably indicating that a reduction in 
transistor size isn’t providing Intel with the individual core 
performance boost that it was hoping for, with it more likely 
leading to reduced power draw instead.
That said, the drop to 10nm is intriguing, as it should 
reduce the overall size of the silicon die by 28.6 percent. 
Combined with a lower power draw, Intel should be able 
to incorporate more cores into its mainstream processors 
without increasing the size of its chip, or changing the LGA 
1151 socket design too signiﬁcantly. Intel has stated that it’ll 
be producing a “lower volume SKU” of Cannon Lake early 
in 2018, before ramping up production within the ﬁrst half 
of the year to full capacity.
Then, of course, there’s 
the chipsets. Expect a new 
one (likely Z390) before the 
end of the ﬁrst quarter, 
tapping 
into 
the 
full 
potential of these eighth-
generation processors. 
DECIPHERING INTEL’S NEXT GEN
What exactly does Intel’s hunt for that elusive 
10nm process node mean for us?
IT WOULD BE REMISS 
of us not to mention 
AMD and Intel’s 
recent partnership in 
bringing one of the 
world’s ﬁrst Radeon 
and Intel powered 
SOC Ultrabook combos 
together. The aim is 
to reduce the overall 
form factor of gaming 
notebooks, from the 
usual 26mm thickness 
to something more 
classy and compatible 
with the Ultrabook 
form factor, without 
compromising on 
performance. To do 
this, Intel’s taking 
advantage of its 
EMIB interconnect 
to incorporate HBM 
2.0 memory stacks, a 
bespoke Radeon GPU 
core, and its own Intel 
processors, to reduce 
the footprint of its 
internal componentry 
signiﬁcantly. We’ve yet 
to receive conﬁrmation 
as to whether this will 
be a Vega or Polaris 
powered GPU, but it 
looks promising.
EMIB is a multi-die 
interposer technology, 
which allows Intel to 
incorporate multiple 
individual dies, at 
varying processing 
node sizes, across a 
single substrate, in 
very close proximity. 
So, for instance, you 
could see a processor 
using a 10nm process, 
with a graphics core 
at 14nm, and the 
dedicated I/O chip at 
22nm, all within a 
single millimeter of 
each other, without 
issue. This leads to 
a cheap, small-form-
factor interconnect 
that reduces power 
draw, temperature, 
height, and cost, with 
very little diﬀiculty for 
the partners involved.
We expect to see 
Ultrabooks powered by 
this new technology 
in the ﬁrst quarter 
of 2018, potentially 
revolutionizing 
performance in the 
ultra-slim form factor 
sector of the industry.
In Cahoots?
Coffee Lake 
makes six cores 
the norm for 
high-end Intel.
Intel and AMD’s combined efforts reduce 
the overall footprint significantly.

found on both the current Pascal P100 GPU accelerator and 
the GTX 1080 Ti are the same. If that’s the case, it’s likely 
that Volta’s V100 and the consumer-side 2080 Ti (whenever 
that launches; think 2019) will be identical. We can then 
calculate the percentage difference between the CUDA 
cores on the GTX 1080 Ti and the 1080, apply that to the 
V100’s spec, and come up with a rough estimate of just how 
many additional CUDA cores Nvidia’s next-gen ﬂagship 
(the GTX 2080) might hold. The short answer is that it’s a 
33 percent increase in CUDA cores, and therefore pure 
GPU grunt over the last generation, and that’s not including 
any architectural magic, or transition across to GDDR6 or 
HBM memory. A 33 percent minimum increase in brute 
force performance, which is exciting enough, if current 
price points hold across the generational jump.
Nvidia’s co-founder and CEO Jen-Hsun hasn’t stipulated 
that we should expect an immediate response to Vega, so 
it’s unlikely we’ll see these cards before the ﬁrst quarter of 
2018. However, with SK Hynix’s recent announcement of its 
latest GDDR6 memory standard being produced for high-
spec cards already, and Volta enterprise-grade GPUs now 
being available to the public, we’d be very surprised if we 
didn’t see these launch before or at Computex 2018.
Can Nvidia’s 
GV100 show us 
what its next-
gen GPUs might 
look like?
IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY that Nvidia has demonstrated 
a good show of force when it came to the grand GPU war 
of the last two years. Pascal has been out for well over 18 
months now, and still continues to reign dominant over its 
red competitor. Radeon’s Technology Group simply hasn’t 
been able to compete, either at the mid range, with its 
Polaris-based RX 400 and 500 series cards, or even more 
recently at the very high end, with Vega falling ﬂat on its 
face, far from the hype that surrounded it. But with little 
competition, what’s the next step for the great green giant?
Well, that would be Volta. We’ve long been hearing 
rumors about Nvidia’s latest and greatest architecture 
ﬁnally making it to the consumer market, and it’s only 
now that we have any inkling as to what it might actually 
include. We know that TSMC is manufacturing the core, we 
know that it’s operating off the 12nm FinFET production 
node, and we also know that there are already enterprise-
grade accelerator cards in existence—powered, of course,

EVOLUTIONARY GREEN GPUS
Is Nvidia’s Volta architecture the revolutionary 
GPU we’ve all been waiting for?
THE BATTLE for VRAM 
dominance needs 
settling this year. 
With both Nvidia and 
AMD utilizing GDDR5X 
and HBM 2.0 in their 
product lineups, which 
is best, and what will 
we see on the GPUs 
of tomorrow?
Each has its 
advantages and 
disadvantages. HBM 
2.0 takes up less PCB 
space than typical 
GDDR5X stacks, runs at 
1.2V, has an incredibly 
low latency, puts 
out an astonishing 
amount of bandwidth 
(242GB/s per stack 
versus GDDR5/X’s 
44GB/s), and, more 
importantly, features 
Pseudo Channel mode, 
which splits a memory 
channel in two, with 
one pseudo channel 
dedicated to memory 
reads, and the other to 
writes. Think of it as 
multithreading, but 
for memory, and solely 
dedicated to read and 
writes, as opposed 
to processes. 
That said, it has 
issues: It’s expensive, 
in short supply (with 
only Samsung and 
SK Hynix currently 
producing it), and can 
be diﬀicult to design 
new GPUs around, 
especially if the GPU 
in question is used 
across a range of 
cards, at diﬀerent price 
points, such as the 
GP104, which covers 
the GTX 1070, 1070 Ti, 
and 1080.
GDDR5X did 
address some of 
the discrepancies 
between the two 
standards, especially 
from a bandwidth 
perspective, and only 
then when competing 
alongside more 
consumer-friendly 
dual-stack Vega GPUs. 
However, latency is 
still an issue, and 
it lacks any form of 
multi-channel support. 
Which is why Nvidia 
currently incorporates 
HBM 2.0 into its

HBM isn’t only seen on AMD-powered GPUs, but Nvidia ones, too.
Vega was disappointing, but 
Navi should correct its mistake, 
and step away from the 
underwhelming GCN architecture.
IT’S BEEN A ROUGH YEAR for AMD’s Radeon 
Technologies Group. A really rough one. We 
didn’t expect the slightly bashful underdog 
of GPU technology to produce anything 
astounding, but after delay, after delay, after 
delay, we did expect more than we ended 
up with. Vega feels very much like a dud, 
especially as far as gaming is concerned. 
And although it powers through crypto-
mining like a V8 through gasoline, when 
your ﬂagship card can’t compete with a 
competitor’s 14-month-old solution in the 
things that really matter, you know you’ve 
got problems. 
Combine that with the departure of Raja 
Koduri, AMD’s Radeon Tech Group Leader, 
leaving for Intel, from the outside, at least, 
things look dire. But are they really? We 
doubt Raja would have left if things with 
AMD’s next-gen architecture weren’t already 
shored up. And much like Jim Keller leaving 
before Ryzen made it to market, there’s the 
likelihood that Navi itself may also be ﬁnally 
on its way to completion, with the initial 
design stage out of the way. Sources suggest 
that AMD may indeed showcase one of its 
Navi GPUs at 2018’s SIGGRAPH event around 
August this year, with a full commercial 
release coming at the end of 2018.
So, what can we expect from the new 
architecture? Well, there are two exciting 
things to consider here. Firstly, there’s the 
drop to 7nm. Secondly, there’s AMD’s recent 
development of its new interconnect, aka 
Inﬁnity Fabric. What does that mean? In 
short, Vega currently operates off the 14nm 
manufacturing process; 7nm equates to a 
50 percent increase in the overall number of 
transistors and, in turn, stream processors. 
On top of that, with AMD’s Inﬁnity Fabric, we 
may see the end of old-school monolithic 
GPU dies from the company. Instead of 
having one hard-to-manufacture, massive 
GPU die, as we’ve typically seen from GPU 
makers, AMD could do something similar 
to how it produces its Threadripper and 
Ryzen processors. In brief, smaller, less 
complicated GPU core complexes, with an 
interconnected fabric bridging performance 
between them, without increasing the 
complexity or cost of manufacturing the 
processors themselves. 
It’s worth noting that both AMD and 
Nvidia are looking to move away from the 
monolithic designs, as dropping down to the 
next process node becomes too taxing a task 
to achieve in the current climate. 
Although we have no way of quantifying 
what kind of performance increase we could 
see here, the notion of adding more cores, 
at a fraction of the complexity and cost, 
may make Navi AMD’s saving grace, and is 
certainly interesting when it comes to the 
future of GPU development. 
But what about that 14nm+ refresh we 
keep hearing about? Well, our bet is we’ll see 
a 14nm refresh of the RX 580, Vega 56, and 
64, with a new low-power manufacturing 
process, being rebadged as new mid to 
high-end GPUs, followed by one or two Navi 
7nm cards in the same generation being the 
ﬂagships with the new designs.
AMD ON THE BACK FOOT?
Team Red needs Navi, and it needs it now
high-end Tesla cards 
available today.
Fortunately, Micron 
has announced that it’s 
mass-manufacturing 
GDDR6 modules, to 
be utilized by high-
end GPUs early next 
year. GDDR6 garners a 
4Gb/s bump in memory 
transfer speed, and, 
more importantly, also 
features dual-channel 
support, which could 
help combat HBM’s 
Pseudo Channel mode. 
For the time being, 
it seems we’ll still be 
stuck in this memory 
hierarchy, with GDDR5 
and 5X featuring on 
more budget-friendly 
cards, GDDR6 on the 
high end, and HBM 
typically utilized 
on Vega and more 
workstation-oriented 
variants instead.

store on a single bit of V-NAND both increases its latency 
and reduces the number of total read and write requests 
possible on the cell itself. SLC is far superior, but comes 
at a far greater cost and, unfortunately, lower density, 
meaning a larger PCB and, ultimately for Samsung, a PCIe 
add-in card, much like Intel’s 900 series drives.
Although, for the time being, Z-NAND is enterprise only, 
we do have some ﬁgures for the drives, which can give 
us a bit of an idea about where the consumer equivalents 
will sit. Samsung revealed that both sequential read 
and write speeds will operate at 3.2GB/s, compared to 
Intel’s 2.4GB/s read and 2GB/s write; random read IOPS 
will be up at 750K versus Intel’s 550K; write IOPS will be 
170K versus Intel’s 500K; random read latency should 
be around 12–20 microseconds, compared to Optane’s 
10 microseconds; and, lastly, the random write latency 
will be 16 microseconds versus Intel’s 10. Although not 
competitive across the board, if Samsung’s drives arrive 
at a signiﬁcantly lower price point than Intel’s (because 
they rely on already well-established technology), they 
could render Optane redundant, unless you need it for very 
speciﬁc use case scenarios.
There’s not been any conﬁrmation of exactly when we 
expect to see a Samsung Z-NAND consumer drive appear, 
but we do expect these to drop some time during the ﬁrst 
half of 2018.
THE STORAGE WARS have been waging for quite some time 
now. Samsung’s 960 series PCIe SSDs have comfortably 
sat top and center of the non-volatile hill for the last 12 
months. And with little challenge to the Korean giant, 
there’s been no need for the company to reveal any new 
devices designed to push the boundaries of solid-state 
storage further. Even Intel and Micron have struggled to 
put up any resistance to the dominance of Sammy’s 3D MLC 
V-NAND tech and its controller—at least, not until recently.
And then there are the connection standards, or 
perhaps it’s more apt to just say M.2 at this point. Because 
that’s the only connection standard still worth its salt in 
the PCIe board game. Intel’s U.2, like many—if not all—
closed-off proprietary connection standards, has fallen 
by the wayside, with lots of motherboard manufacturers 
no longer supporting it. With few devices operating on 
the standard, and the price-to-performance of Intel’s 750 
SSDs being less than desirable, there just wasn’t enough 
choice to see it used enough.
This year hasn’t been a complete dud for storage 
tech, though. Intel and Micron’s design teams have ﬁnally 
brought the true might of their Optane 3D XPoint memory 
technology to market. First in the less-than-stellar Optane 
cache M.2 sticks, then in the phenomenal power of the 
900P series SSDs. Although sequentials were lower than 
the competition, the stellar low latency and incredible 4K 
random reads and writes made it leaps and bounds more 
powerful than the prestigious 960 Pro. 
Intel has promised that there’s more to come from the 
ﬂedgling resistive tech, but for the time being, the battle 
seems to be shifting away from how fast a sequential ﬁgure 
you can get, and more toward low latency and higher IOPs. 
Samsung is well aware of this, too, recently announcing the 
launch of its Z-NAND consumer SSDs.
Z-NAND is, as far as we know, a derivation of Samsung’s 
3D NAND technology. Still built off the existing 40nm 
processing node, it’s expected to feature a brand new 
controller, and a single-level cell design, as opposed to 
the 960 series multi-level cell. In short, the more data you

Bear in mind 
that Asus, AOC, 
and Acer’s 4K 
144Hz panels 
are made 
by the same 
manufacturer.
AS FAR AS SCREEN TECH is concerned, we’ve stagnated 
over the last 12 months. Although HDR was promised as 
the “next big thing” from manufacturers across the globe, 
its impact on the computing industry has been stiﬂed. With 
quantum dot, OLED, and RGBW panels occupying the price 
point they do, and a lack of HDR content making it into the 
mainstream, the desire to invest in 
the new tech has been slim. Much 
like 4K before, it’s taking time for 
the uptake of both content and 
screens to occur.
Speaking of 4K, not a lot has 
changed in this arena either. 
Panels have reduced in cost 
as 
more 
manufacturers 
bump up their production 
lines, and we’re starting 
to see an abundance of 
screens pushing the 30-
inch barrier, but apart from 
that, 2017 has been relatively quiet. 
We’ve not seen as much of an uptake into 1440p 
and higher resolutions as was expected, 
so development has tended to focus around higher refresh 
rate monitors instead.
Which segues nicely into a discussion of where we’re 
going in the future. So, what can we expect from 2018? Well, 
as far as ﬂagships are concerned, we’re expecting high-
refresh 4K panels to ﬁnally arrive. Although DisplayPort 
has been capable of handling 4K at higher than 60Hz since 
way back in 2014, as far as GPUs are concerned, it’s been 
nothing more than a far-fetched fantasy. AMD’s RX series 
GPUs and Nvidia’s GTX 10 series were the ﬁrst to support 
DisplayPort 1.4, enabling enough bandwidth to go beyond 
60Hz at 4K. Technically, DisplayPort 1.3 supported that, but 
not with HDR as well. In 2018, Asus, Acer, and AOC are all 
producing 120Hz-plus 4K screens with HDR by default. We 
expect these to launch early in the year, presumably after 
CES. However, it’s likely that these will be priced out of the 
stratosphere, with most probably retailing close to the 
$2,000 bracket. 
Although not realistic for the majority of us, this does 
give us hope that the next generation of 4K screens will 
come down in price. Combined with more powerful, more 
affordable GPUs, the dream of an affordable 4K gaming 
combo is inching ever closer.
THE FUTURE OF DISPLAY
Is 4K the new mainstream?
AHH, THE JILTED LOVER of the computing 
world. The buzz word that was on every 
journalist’s lips. Was VR just another 
gimmick? Or was it misrepresented? Ahead 
of its time? It’s difﬁcult to say for sure, as sales 
have been reasonable, with both Oculus and 
HTC proﬁting from the VR experience, but 
little has come out of 2017 with regard to the 
new way of consuming media.
There have been price drops, for sure, 
with both platforms being reduced by a total 
of $200. And there’s plenty of content, too, 
from an army of indie developers, and other 
games being made VR-compatible (there are 
266 games and experiences currently listed 
in Steam’s Virtual Reality category). 
But the headsets still have problems. The 
2160x1200 (1080x1200 per eye) resolution, so 
close to your eyes, still features that visible 
screen door or grid effect, and the refresh 
rate is still locked to a nauseating 90Hz. 
Ideally, we need to see a pixel density two to 
three times greater than what we have today 
before VR becomes more akin to gaming on 
even a 1080p screen. However, with Oculus 
announcing it won’t be releasing a Rift 2 any 
time soon, and with HTC’s latest Vive Focus 
concentrating on mobile, it’s unlikely we’ll 
see these changes make their way into the 
consumer ecosphere in the near future.
All that aside, early last year, Samsung’s 
screen manufacturing division showcased 
a new display designed speciﬁcally for 
VR headsets. Cramming an incredible 
2024x2200 resolution into a 3.5-inch form 
factor, it added over 86 percent more pixels 
into the same space. That’s a pixel density of 
858, versus the 460 of the original. 
Perhaps 2018 will be the year when we 
ﬁnally see someone outside of the HTC 
and Oculus community bring a headset to 
market that actually makes sense for the 
graphically aware consumer. Or, better yet, 
see Microsoft’s AR HoloLens project reach a 
more affordable level than the $3,000 price 
tag it’s currently associated with. 
VIRTUAL RENAISSANCE
Does the resurgence of virtual reality lie 
with the next generation of headsets?
Although 
exceptionally 
interesting,  
AR is just too 
pricey right 
now to justify.

Want to run old games on new Windows? Here’s how
YOU PLACE A TREASURED CD-ROM into the disc 
tray, wistful about the good old days, and excited 
to see the familiar pixels of an old favorite 
game. Your PC reacts like a dog watching a 
magic trick. Autorun doesn’t work. Setup.exe 
doesn’t work. InstallShield is looking for a long-
forgotten Windows 98 library ﬁle in perpetuity. 
In a very real and upsetting way, your childhood 
is no longer compatible with the modern world, 
and you know that the only way to rekindle it 
involves hours of compatibility box-checking, 
Googling, and ﬁddling. A traumatic moment.
But it doesn’t have to be. Getting software that 
was designed for much older operating systems 
and hardware to run on modern machines offers 
its own intrinsic satisfaction. It’s like breaking 
the rules, somehow, raising dead software that 
was never intended to interface with silicon this 
powerful, and bending an operating system to 
your will. There are many different avenues to 
pursue when you’re attempting to do so, and 
that in itself has its own pros and cons. That 
variety of approaches means it’s unlikely you’ll 
truly reach a dead end, to stretch that avenue 
metaphor to breaking point. But it does also 
mean the plethora of conﬂicting information 
found on message boards suggesting this 
method or that can make this a tricky task to 
go about in a methodical manner. So, let’s do 
exactly that: Let’s turn what would ordinarily be 
an evening of directionless trial and error into a 
scientiﬁc process. The deﬁnitive and exhaustive 
guide to running old games on a new PC.
Lab coats are optional, but a willingness to 
install a few programs on your PC and a sound 
awareness of abandonware law are mandatory 
in this test environment. With those humble 
tools, you should be able to run any old game on 
a Windows 10 PC, however categorical the error 
messages seem upon the ﬁrst attempt.

BEFORE GETTING STUCK into the many-
branched 
methodology 
of 
old 
game 
necromancy, 
let’s 
examine 
why 
this 
problem exists. After all, if a PC can run 
The Witcher 3 at a dreamy 60fps, why does 
it struggle to render 1999 tactical shooter 
Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear at anything 
above single ﬁgures? And why is it so hard 
to get certain games even installed?
Essentially, it all comes down to 
operating systems. Whenever a piece of 
software or PC game is developed, its 
creators make a series of assumptions 
about the environment it’ll be used in. The 
developers of 1999, for example, might 
reasonably have expected that most users 
would be installing their game on to a 
Windows 98 or Windows 95 PC, both based 
around the 16-bit DOS operating system. 
That, in turn, means an assumption about 
the ﬁle libraries and drivers contained 
within those operating systems, and the 
kind of hardware that might be running it. 
Those developers couldn’t anticipate that 
later versions of Windows, from Win 2000 
onward, would only emulate DOS, rather 
than running it natively, and that the code 
that installs and runs the game on DOS-
based operating systems would eventually 
become gibberish to Windows 10. And they 
couldn’t have known—how could anyone?—
what a monumental pain in the posterior 
UAC would prove in later, more security-
conscious Windows iterations. 
Generally, then, programs don’t work 
on modern machines because those 
modern machines are running a recent OS. 
Hardware tends to play only an indirect role 
in incompatibility. For example, because 32-
bit systems recognize only a 4GB maximum 
of memory, most of us run 64-bit operating 
systems to accommodate more RAM. But 
unlike 32-bit versions, 64-bit Windows 
doesn’t include 16-bit emulation. That 
means it can’t fool a Windows 95 application 
that’s searching for recognizable libraries 
in order to install itself correctly. The 
same goes for today’s graphics cards and 
processors: It isn’t that they’re inherently 
too powerful for old software, but that the 
old software can’t interpret and harness 
their power correctly, because they don’t 
understand the drivers installed. 
The stumbling block for one particular 
vintage game might be DOS, driver support, 
missing libraries, security issues, or 
incompatibility beyond 16-bit systems, but 
the root cause is fairly universal: It’s the 
software environment. The obvious solution 
is to modify that software environment 
so the old game has enough information 
and security privileges to function. And 
that’s something you can go big or small 
with. Since we’re doing this methodically, 
it makes sense to begin with the small 
measures, such as patches and DOSBox, 
and work up to more drastic solutions, such 
as running a virtual Windows XP machine. 
SCOUR FOR UPDATES
If a game installs on your PC but won’t run, 
ﬁrst check online for ofﬁcial developer 
patches, and unofﬁcial patches created 
by users who experienced similar issues. 
Perhaps you’ll strike lucky with a game like 
Vampire: The Masquerade—Redemption. 
First released in 2004, it’s long since been 
regarded as a cult classic, but shipped 
with more bugs than a mail order ant farm. 
Developer Troika was still releasing patches 
for it ﬁve years later, and the community 
took it even further with an unofﬁcial patch, 
which still receives updates in 2017. Try the 
original disc, and you’ll have problems, but 
with those two downloads, it runs perfectly 
on Windows 10. 
Elsewhere, community modders have 
addressed issues pertaining to entire game 
engines, ﬁxing a whole suite of titles in the 
process. Black Isle’s Inﬁnity Engine hosted 
many of role-playing’s all-time greats, 
such as Baldur’s Gate I and II, Icewind Dale, 
and Planescape Torment, but relies on 
Microsoft’s defunct DirectDraw API, and 
thus has all manner of issues on modern 
machines. 
Aqrit’s 
DDrawFix 
resolves 
those issues in nine games with one 5MB 
download. There are other solutions, but 
this is certainly more elegant than running 
an entire OS in a virtual machine just to 
access DirectDraw. 
COMPATIBILITY MODE OPTIONS
Windows doesn’t have a great reputation 
for the efﬁcacy of its compatibility mode, 
but in certain circumstances, a checked box 
here and a drag-down menu option there 
might be all it takes to solve your problem, 
whether it be installing or running the old 
game in question. When you right-click on 
a program or installer, and navigate to the 
compatibility tab, you’ll see several options 
to emulate different Windows versions and 
alter display settings. When you run an 
application in compatibility mode, you’re 
telling your current version of Windows 
to lie to that application, and it does so by 
placing a layer of alternate code, known as 
a shim, between the application loader and 
Windows. File paths are translated from 
new to old, so C:\Users\You\Documents 
becomes C:\Documents and Settings\You\
My Documents. It modiﬁes the functions 
of certain .dlls so the application returns 
the expected information. For example, the 
GetVersionEx function used to determine 
which version of Windows an application’s 
working with would return data from the 
shim, rather than the true kernel32.dll’s 
information. In other words, when the 
application asks “Which version of Windows 
is this?” compatibility mode steps in and 
says “Windows XP, honest!” before your 
actual OS has chance to blurt out “Windows 
10,” and give the game away. 
In reality, setting the right compatibility 
mode options can often be part of the 
solution, but it’s rarely your one-stop 
1996’s Tomb Raider was among the first 
games to need a discrete graphics card, 
so it’s hard to run in a virtual environment.

shop. As a rule of thumb, it’s best to start 
by selecting the predominant OS at the 
time the game was released (Windows 98 
for Half-Life, let’s say), and running as an 
Administrator. This helps the application do 
what it needs to without Windows stepping 
in and halting it at an unexpected juncture. 
From there, you can experiment with 256 
colors and 640x480 resolution limiting, but 
it’s often best to move on and look for other 
solutions, rather than troubleshooting 
exclusively in the compatibility tab.
DOS AND DON’TS
Paradoxically, the further back you go with 
PC games, the easier it becomes to run 
them on modern machinery. That’s in large 
part thanks to DOSBox, which emulates 
an Intel x86-based system, complete with 
graphics and sound cards, mouse support, 
and a modem. DOSBox should be the ﬁrst 
port of call when running any pre-Windows 
XP game, which means it opens up about 20 
years of gaming, from the Commander Keen 
days to late-nineties gems designed for 
DOS-based Windows. Since it’s effectively 
a virtual machine, and you probably don’t 
have a ﬂoppy disk drive in your machine, 
you need disk image ﬁles of the games 
you want to play. DOS games are generally 
considered abandonware now, so although 
it isn’t legal to download them, it isn’t likely 
to get you into trouble (see “Abandonware, 
all ye who enter” over the page).
DOSBox works by mounting a virtual C 
drive created by the user, then navigating 
around using command prompts. For 
example, C:\DOSGAMES becomes your 
DOSBox’s virtual root drive with the 
command line “mount c c:\dosgames.” 
For convenience’s sake, it’s worth keeping 
all your DOS game image ﬁles within this 
directory, each in individual folders. The 
“cd” command changes directory, which 
means you can type “cd [game name folder]” 
to navigate to your chosen game, then type 
DOING IT THE HARD WAY
Depending on your 
motivation for coaxing 
an old game back into 
operation, simply getting 
it up and running on your 
current machine might not 
satisfy. A 4K HDR display 
might do wonders for 
your Steam library, but it 
only serves to highlight 
the shortcomings of a 
game designed to run 
at 640x480. And there’s 
something a bit strange 
about playing Quake 
with an RGB mechanical 
keyboard and a wireless 
mouse, when all’s said and 
done. When you feel that 
the modern technology 
ensconcing your old 
software is detracting from 
the experience, there’s 
only one thing for it: a retro 
gaming PC build.
A word of warning, 
though: This can be costly 
if you’re not smart about 
it. Perhaps it’s not a big 
surprise that giant beige 
boxes with Pentium IIs and 
Voodoo 2s are a thriving 
cottage industry on 
eBay—everyone has one 
in their attic or garage, 
and for some people, 
the only way to enjoy old 
games is in situ. But their 
appetite for tobacco-
yellowed Dell keyboards 
has driven prices well 
beyond what one might 
reasonably expect, so avoid 
searching speciﬁcally for 
“retro gaming PC” items. 
If you instead search 
for “Windows 98 PC,” 
for example, you’ll ﬁnd 
listings for near-identical 
machines that don’t carry 
a premium for their trendy 
vintage appeal. 
It is worth buying 
entire PCs in one package, 
though, rather than trying 
to source everything 
component by component. 
Unless you’ve been reading 
up on motherboard/CPU/

They really were the salad 
days, weren’t they?
ABANDONWARE,  
ALL YE WHO ENTER
Before even beginning to 
wrestle it into working, the 
act of acquiring an old PC 
game can be tricky in itself. 
Physical media drives are 
an increasingly rare sight 
on modern machines, and 
there’s every chance you 
threw all your old games 
out years ago. It might 
be tempting to hunt for 
a disc ISO ﬁle of some 
forgotten treasure on an 
abandonware site, but 
before you do, it’s worth 
knowing the legality of 
those actions, and what the 
term abandonware means.
Essentially, the term 
deﬁnes a legal no-man’s-
land in which a product’s 
copyright might not have 
expired, but since its 
owner no longer supplies 
it for legal purchase or 
supports it, it “abandons” 
copyright enforcement. It’s 
safe to assume Activision 
doesn’t have a legal team 
pursuing all those who 
download ISOs of its 1998 
shooter SiN, for example, 
but that doesn’t mean 
it’s legal to do so. Real-
world example: Since 
Microsoft ofﬁcially stopped 
supporting Windows XP in 
2014, numerous sites have 
offered it for free, and none 
has faced legal action.
So, if you own a 
physical copy of a certain 
abandonware game, but 
no longer have a CD-
ROM drive with which to 
install it, you’re still not 
technically within your 
rights to download a 
cracked version online. But 
since it can’t be purchased 
new elsewhere anymore, 
the copyright holder is 
unlikely to penalize you. 
If the company that holds 
the copyright no longer 
exists, you’re on even safer 
ground, and if the original 
software was distributed 
under a shareware license 
(like the ﬁrst third of 
Doom), well, the feds 
probably aren’t tailing you 
day and night and preparing 
to haul you off to San 
Quentin. Shareware is ﬁne. 
The important thing is to 
check whether something 
really is abandonware 
before downloading.
Sid Meier probably isn’t going to 
turn up irate at your door when 
you download Civilization I.
This is a copyright infringement notice.

the executable name to run it. Of all the 
methods available, DOSBox is one of the 
easiest and most reliable, and only requires 
a few command lines to get things up and 
running. Its limitations make themselves 
apparent when running 3D games that were 
considered demanding at the time, such 
as Tomb Raider, Quake, or Carmageddon. 
DOSBox runs these using its own software 
renderer, so for more advanced graphics, 
you need to seek out a 3DFX/Glide emulator 
designed for use in DOSBox. Some custom 
builds of the program, such as DOSBox SVM 
Daum, come with Direct3D, Glide, and other 
advanced features baked in, so are the 
best bet for running later DOS games that 
made use of graphics cards. Ah, the Voodoo 
days—brings a tear to the eye. And just to 
hammer the point home, don’t rule out 
DOSBox if you’re trying to run a game that 
was released for Win 95 or Win 98—they 
were DOS-based OSes, after all. 
VIRTUAL INSANITY
If you want to take this vintage gaming thing 
to a greater extreme, it’s time to consider 
running a virtual machine with an older OS 
installed. Broadly, this isn’t too different an 
approach from running DOSBox, but if you 
ﬁnd yourself playing a lot of games from 
that awkward post-DOS, pre-Win 7 era, it 
might end up being more convenient. Plus, 
there’s the heady nostalgia hit of seeing the 
old OS’s desktop, and enjoying all the sound 
effects—remember 
when 
performing 
almost any action on a PC came with its own 
bespoke sound effect?
VirtualBox is the go-to application 
for this. It’s relatively easy to install 
even dusty old Windows 3.1 on a virtual 
machine, complete with the required

CONSOLE YOURSELF  
(ACTUALLY, DON’T)
Creating an artiﬁcial 
software environment in 
which a program’s tricked 
into running successfully 
is one way to describe the 
resurrection of old PC 
games. It’s also one way to 
describe console emulation 
on PC, which has a history 
as long as it is illegal.
Its origins date back 
to 1990, when programs 
such as Family Computer 
Emulator v0.35 allowed 
a handful of NES games 
to run on PC. Since then, 
almost every console 
has been emulated on 
PC, and even Nintendo’s 
DS, with its unique 
control options, joined 
the ranks. As technical 
accomplishments, they’re 
impressive, and there’s 
a subversive thrill in 
seeing another platform 
holder’s ident appearing 
on a PC monitor. The key 
difference between using 
old PC games on a new 
PC and using old console 
games on a new PC is that 
you’re breaking two sets 
of copyright laws when 
you do the latter. Consoles 
are closed platforms, and 
their games are licensed 
strictly for use on that very 
speciﬁc hardware. What 
constitutes a PC is open to 
interpretation, when you 
factor in the Raspberry Pi, 
Steam OS machines, ofﬁce 
workstations, and quad-
SLI gaming rigs. What 
constitutes a PlayStation 4 
is not. There haven’t been 
many legal cases, but 
when Sony tried to sue 
two PS1 emulators in the 
1990s, an uneasy accord 
was established: As an 
emulator doesn’t re-use 
code, it’s not illegal. The 
games, however, are. 
The legality gets 
trickier when considering 
discontinued platforms. 
Arguably, since the Sega 
Saturn was discontinued 
long ago, it can be 
considered abandonware 
(along with its software 
library). But what if the 
platform comes back to 
life, as with Nintendo’s 
SNES Mini? Steer clear, and 
concentrate on PC gaming’s 
voluminous library instead.

it was intended for, however 
possible it may be to run on PC.
Classics like Doom don’t need much to get

patches. Mouse support—what a treat!
virtual hardware, although you either need 
an install disc and product key for the OS, or 
a disk image. Once again, we’re in the murky 
waters of abandonware here, but you can 
ﬁnd Windows XP and older versions for free 
online, and Microsoft hasn’t pursued any 
legal action against their distribution. 
It’s certainly preferable to be greeted 
by a familiar old interface when booting up 
games than it is to deal with DOSBox’s black 
and white prompt windows, but VirtualBox 
does have something of an Achilles heel: 
3D graphics support. Its native support 
is “experimental” (read: doesn’t really 
work with games), and its developers have 
long maintained that if the community 
wants 3DFX/Glide virtualization, it’s up to 
them to open-source it. Some members 
of that community have done exactly 
that (VirtualBox refers to this as Guest 
Addition content), but it’s not a simple task 
to install it, particularly when working in 
older operating systems. Having installed 
your OS via disc or image, restart in safe 
mode with networking, navigate to the 
Guest Additions ﬁle on VirtualBox’s site, 
then unzip and install it. Sounds simple, 
but if you’re on Win 95, there are many 
compatibility hurdles to overcome when 
using an unzipper program or downloading 
the ﬁle. Even when successfully installed, 
3D acceleration can be prone to crashing 
in VirtualBox, and has major performance 
issues that will impact your enjoyment 
of the game. If you had your heart set on 
experiencing old games through a trusty 
old OS, though, there is another way.
PARTITION LIKE IT’S 1999
Yep—partitioning your storage drive and 
installing an older operating system on to 
it might do the trick. This is overkill for the 
vast majority of troublesome retro games, 
because it’s a complicated task that risks 
data loss if performed incorrectly. But if 
you really want those old Win 98 themes 
and your favorite games, create a partition 
on your chosen disk, and mark it as active 
by navigating to the “Boot” tab in Windows 
System Conﬁguration, highlighting the 
desired partition, and selecting “Set as 
default.” Then reboot and use an old OS 
disk to install it to the partition; http://thpc.
info has a clear step-by-step guide on how 
to do this. Beware, though: Windows 98 
and older won’t have a clue what to make 
of your modern hardware. You will have 
countless driver issues and ACPI conﬂicts. 
You will have to spend hours getting it to 
recognize your graphics card. But for some, 
the satisfaction of achieving a resolution 
beyond 640x480 when those issues are 
resolved is reward in itself. 
Summoning the gaming greats of yore 
can be a knotty problem, then, and there 
are many ways to untangle those knots. If 
the game in question falls under the DOS 
era, DOSBox should be the ﬁrst port of call; 
if it doesn’t, try searching for patches and 
fan ﬁxes. Next, try compatibility mode. And 
if all else fails, well, your parents might still 
have that hearing-aid-beige Packard Bell 
tower in the attic.

Everything you 
need to know 
about your PSU, 
and some things 
you probably didn’t
YOUR RIG DRAWS every watt and volt it uses from one 
power supply unit (probably). All being well, it will sit 
quietly in a corner of your case and keep the magic 
happening. There are only three reasons to buy a 
new one: your existing one has gone bang or started 
to smell funny; you are about to embark on serious 
upgrading; or you’re building a new rig from scratch.
Its job may be vital, but the PSU is often left until 
last on a component list, using the remaining budget 
after you’ve picked out the good stuff. A power supply 
is a power supply—as long as it’s big enough, you just 
plug it in, and it works, right? 
There’s a bit more to it than that. A good one 
lasts a long time, stays cool, and enables future 
expansion and stable overclocking. Get it wrong, and 
you’ll be back ordering another, and possibly other 
components, too, because when a PSU goes bang, it 
can take other parts along with it.
The current standard for PSUs is ATX, which 
surfaced in 1996, replacing the ancient AT. The latest 
iteration is ATX 2.31, dating from 2008, which shows 
how leisurely the development of PSU standards 
is. That’s not to say PSUs aren’t evolving; the huge 
appetite for power of the graphics sub-system, and 
the world of overclocking, has put great demands on 
the PSU. The latest ones are adding digital control 
circuits; you can even get ones with Bluetooth, so you 
can run them from a phone app. So, how many watts 
do you really need? And why do prices vary so much?

THE ELECTRICITY FROM your wall outlet is 
completely wrong for your PC. It delivers a 
120V 60Hz alternating current (technically 
it is 120V +/-5 percent; the median value 
is actually 117V). This is great for chunky 
electric motors or making toast, but inimical 
for the delicate circuit boards inside your 
PC—nothing can use this unmodiﬁed, it’s 
way too powerful, and everything wants a 
direct current instead. The PSU’s one and 
only job is to transform this supply into 
tech-friendly low-voltage DC varieties. The 
original IBM PC’s power supply delivered 
63.5W—things are a little more taxing now.
A PSU is an SMPS—a switched mode 
power supply. It switches from full power 
to none and back quickly. The voltage is 
regulated by adjusting the switching ratio 
between full-on and off. The idea has been 
around since the 1830s, but it took modern 
transistors to put them into everyday 
consumer electronics. An SMPS is smaller, 
lighter, and more efﬁcient than plain old 
linear designs, which waste excess power 
as heat. Old-timers may remember when 
transformers were heavy bricks; no longer. 
The main drawback is that the switching 
introduces high-amplitude, high-frequency 
interference, which needs to be ﬁltered out. 
There are eight main stages in a 
switched power supply. These are: input 
ﬁltering, primary bridge rectiﬁer, primary 
capacitors, primary switching transistors, 
transformers, 
secondary 
rectiﬁers, 
output ﬁltering, and ﬁnally feedback and 
protection circuits. The bridge rectiﬁer is 
an arrangement of four diodes that only 
allows electricity to pass one way, thus the 
sine wave of an AC current is turned into a 
saw-toothed DC one. This is then switched 
on and off very quickly, and fed into the main 
transformers to be stepped down to the 
required voltage. And, yes, we have skirted 
around some of these stages, because, 
quite frankly, you don’t need to know, and it 
may involve diagrams.
What every component in a PC really 
wants is a steady voltage, but all the business 
of transforming and rectifying adds noise to 
the signal. Enter the capacitors. These are 
passive devices used in PSUs to smooth out 
the rufﬂes in a current. They are rapidly 
charged and discharged, but as they resist 
rapid changes in voltage, the peaks and 
lows of the signal are never reached. This 
turns a jagged signal into a much smoother 
one. You’ll ﬁnd them both on the primary 
side of the PSU, dealing with the incoming 
AC current, and on the secondary side, 
smoothing the DC current from the rectiﬁer.
The Japanese have something of a 
reputation here. Years of extremely high 
production standards, purity of materials, 
and quality control have given them an 
enviable reputation. Many spec sheets 
proudly boast of Japanese 105 C rated 
electrolytic capacitors, the ones to look for. 
Good capacitors are expensive, and this is 
one area where budget PSUs cut corners. 
A PC requires its juice in three strengths: 
12V, 5V, and 3.3V. The main 12V is used for 
the processor and PCIe cards, as well as 
fans, drive motors, and anything else that 
needs a decent amount of power. The 5V 
supply is used for drive controllers, parts of 
the motherboard chipset, including the BIOS 
and CMOS, and other sub-systems—USB, 
PCIe control circuitry, and such. The 3.3V 
rail typically runs your RAM, some graphics 
card functions, and other control circuitry. 
The majority of the power requirement of 
your PC falls on the 12V supply, and it’s this 
that needs the most attention.
The motherboard also has a number 
of VRMs—voltage regulation modules—
to supply the more delicate components. 
The processor has its own 12V supply, 
for example, but you couldn’t send that 
through any processor made since the 
1970s. VRMs use switching transistors to 
lower a DC current. They are multiphase 
synchronous buck converters. Note the 
term “multiphase.” Each phase means 
adding a set of transistors, which increases 
the stability of the output, reducing ripple 
(we’ll get to that). More phases doesn’t 
mean more power—that depends on the 
amperage rating of the transistors. More is 
deﬁnitely better, though. 
RAIL REALITIES
To supply the main voltages, the PSU has a 
number of rails. A rail is a separate line of 
connections, which has a set monitored and 
limited output, to avoid excessive heating 
and dangerous loads. There are 12V, 5V, 
and 3.3V rails, plus a small 5V standby rail, 
and a now virtually unused -12V rail kept for 
compatibility. 2003’s ATX 2.0 spec calls for 
two 12V rails: one for the processor, and 
one for everything else. Originally, these 
were rated at 20A each. This is equivalent to 
240W (watts = amps x volts).
Generally, a single 12V source was split 
into two rails, with the lower voltage rails 
The 6+2 PCIe 12V power connectors. These 
feed the appetites of GPUs. If your PSU has 
two of these, and two six-pin versions, it 
was designed to run two graphics cards.
The $450 EVGA SuperNOVA: 1,600W of 
power—far too much, of course. Unless 
you really do want four graphics cards. 
With modular cabling, you only install 
the cable you need. Better PSUs are fully 
modular, mid-range ones are often partly 
so; both reduce the colored spaghetti look.
Corsair’s ﬂagship AXi PSUs were the ﬁrst 
to use digital control circuits, enabling 
you to remotely monitor and control them.

running off the 12V supply, using VRMs to 
drop the voltage. Building fully independent 
rails is expensive. A few specialist PSUs 
boast 
“real” 
multiple 
rails—however, 
almost all actually run one and split the 
output. The high demands of graphics 
cards, all of which fell on a single rail, soon 
caused problems, and the power demands 
hit the buffers of the ATX speciﬁcations. 
PSUs started to split out more rails to cope. 
These were conﬁgured (or should have 
been; there were some early failures) to 
spread the power-hungry PCIe loads. Each 
rail’s power rating is its limit before circuit 
protectors cut in. It does not mean the PSU 
can supply that level of power across all 
the rails; there’s still a maximum 12V it can 
deliver, which may be lower. In 2007, ATX 2.3 
ﬁnally dropped the 20A limit, one which was 
increasingly being breached.
Enter the one big 12V rail design. Gamers 
have traditionally liked these—you don’t 
have to worry about spreading loads. Just 
connect everything, and let the hardware 
draw what it needs from a common pool. 
Job done. Splitting down is inherently safer, 
though—if a part fails on a single rail PSU, 
it can potentially get a huge amount of 
power sent through it, a hefty shock, and 
possibly a ﬁre. The single rail design is in 
favor these days, especially for enthusiast 
rigs, although the server room boys still 
like their safer multiple rail designs. Some 
PSUs offer both, with the ability to be 
conﬁgured as one big rail, or multiple lower 
amperage ones. A neat solution.
And now back to those ripples. These 
are tiny, rapid ﬂuctuations in the voltage. 
They are a consequence of the AC to DC 
conversion, a harmonic distortion at the 
switching frequency, and are expressed 
as a deviation in mV (millivolts). The ATX 
speciﬁcations lay down allowable levels: 
120mV on the 12V supply, and 50mV on 
the others. Excessive ripple can cause 
damage to hardware. Fortunately, not 
the burning and smoking kind, but it does 
stress electrolytic capacitors in particular, 
lowering their lifetimes. 
Good ripple suppression means better 
overclocking potential. Faster clock speeds 
mean less time for the VRM to reach the 
required voltage; a ripple at the wrong 
moment of a clock cycle can mean it never 
reaches the required operating voltage, and 
it becomes “unstable.” If you are intent on 
some serious overclocking, look for a PSU 
with good ripple suppression on the 12V 
rail. A lot of progress has been made here 
recently, and high-end PSUs can manage 
down to 30mV; the very best  boast 10mV.
FAILURE FACTS
Decent 
PSUs 
are 
reliable, 
but 
like 
everything, they don’t last for ever. The 
main reason for PSU failure is the fan. 
If this goes, your PSU rapidly overheats 
under load. A good PSU has a good fan—it 
should be as good as or better than your 
processor cooler and case fans. There’s no 
point in a PSU with a life of 100,000 hours 
being cooled by a sleeve-bearing fan with a 
life of 50,000. Single-fan PSUs always have 
an exhaust fan, sucking air from inside the 
case, across the PSU’s heatsinks, and out 
the case. Look for designs that can run 
without a fan at low loads, known as Eco 
mode. Some don’t need the fan until loads 
hit 40 percent—well above idle.
Capacitors have a limited lifespan, too, 
which is affected by how hot they get. They 
can leak, which gets nasty. At this point, 
WHEN IS 
200W  
ACTUALLY 
250W?
A 500W PSU uses 500W of power at 
full load, right? Nope, the work the 
PSU does in transforming, rectifying, 
and smoothing has its cost, in heat 
principally. This efﬁciency is expressed 
as a percentage. If your rig draws 200W, 
a typical 80 percent efﬁciency PSU 
draws 250W from the wall to do it. The 
efﬁciency is not constant—running 
ﬂat out or at very low levels is more 
inefﬁcient. The sweet spot is at a load of 
40–60 percent. A good quality PSU tends 
to have a ﬂatter efﬁciency curve. 
In the early days, efﬁciencies were 
low; ATX 2.01 only required 60 percent 
at a 20 percent load. To improve things, 
the 80 Plus program was launched by 
the American Council for an Energy-
Efﬁcient Economy in 2004. To earn the 
logo, a PSU must be a minimum of 80 
percent efﬁcient at loads of 20 percent, 
50 percent, and 100 percent. Further 
standards followed: 80 Plus Bronze 
takes us to 85 percent efﬁciency at 50 
percent loads, and 82 percent at 20 
and 100 percent loads. Silver added 3 
percent and Gold another 2 percent. As 
we approach 100 percent, it is harder to 
engineer. In 2009, the ﬁrst Platinum PSU 
appeared, pushing efﬁciencies to 90, 
92, and 89 percent. The highest current 
rating is Titanium—it appeared in 2012, 
and manages 92, 94, and 90 percent. 
Efﬁciency costs. You need more and 
better quality components. Electricity 
costs, too. If your rig is on for long 
periods, some calculations may be 
required to pick the most cost-effective 
PSU. A 500W Gold PSU over a Bronze 
may cost an extra $50, but only earns 
an extra 5 percent in efﬁciency, which 
may take years to get back in savings. 
However, high efﬁciency also gives a 
good indication of build quality. 
Of course, there are LEDs. Thermaltake’s 
$120 850W Toughpower Grand boasts a 14 
RGB LED fan—plus some decent specs.
CoolerMaster makes much of its fans, 
as you might expect. This compact V650 
comes in at about $180. Poky enough for a 
very demanding single graphics card box.
A basic $30 PSU, here from EVGA. This still 
delivers 400W in total, with 360W through 
a single 30A 12V rail.

you may get some capacitor squeal—this 
is gas venting through a pinhole in the 
casing, making a whistle. If you can hear 
this, failure is imminent. Less worrying, 
and more likely as a source of an annoying 
sound, is coil whine. This is when induction 
coils start to vibrate under load; this varies 
in pitch and intensity with the current. If 
these coils are inside your PSU, there is not 
a lot you can do. They may “bed in” after a 
while; they may not. A good PSU will have 
tested and damped its coils properly.
It may be tempting to use an old ATX 
power supply you happen to have hanging 
around, doing nothing, in a new system—not 
recommended. It may technically fall within 
ATX speciﬁcations, but these are pretty 
loose, and a lot has changed in the last 
few years, particularly the distribution of 
power requirements, which has moved off 
the 5V and 3.3V rails and on to the 12V 
one. A perfectly good, but old, ATX supply 
makes a poor partner for modern rigs. If it 
still has a 20A 12V rail, for example, you’ll 
struggle if you load the PCIe system.
Power is delivered to your system 
through a set of cables with standardized 
connectors for each job. The wires are 
color-coded (or used to be; it appears to be 
going out of fashion): The +12V power line 
is yellow, the +5V is red, and the +3.3V is 
orange. Time was a PSU came with a mess 
of cables dangling from it, each hardwired 
with a connector. This is unruly, because 
any connectors you don’t require are left 
dangling about inside, and you may have to 
start using adapters and splitters to get 
everything powered.
MODULAR MERITS
Better PSUs now have either 
a partly or completely modular 
cable system. The PSU has blocks 
of sockets, and it comes with a 
set of separate cables, often snazzy 
rounded, ﬂattened, or braided ones. 
You only need to install the cables you 
need. This looks good, improves airﬂow 
and is much neater. 
PSUs only draw the power they are 
asked for, so over-specifying won’t cost you, 
other than the initial outlay. The chances of 
you putting too much strain on the 5V and 
3.3V rails is next to none. These components 
simply don’t draw much power, and any 
decent PSU allows more than enough. It’s 
the 12V side you need to match with your 
hardware. So, where is the 12V power 
going? There are two devices that soak 
this up, and the culprits are the processor 
and the graphics card. Compared to these, 
everything else is a lightweight.
Processors have a TDP ﬁgure, expressed 
in watts. This is the thermal design power, 
and is the maximum heat a processor 
generates under a heavy load. It can be 
exceeded in certain conditions, and isn’t the 
same as electrical power consumption—
It’s usually not as many as you think. 
A decent single graphics card gaming 
rig is happy with 500–600W. Put very 
roughly, a nicely specced modern rig 
with multiple drives needs 200–250W at 
most, plus the CPU and graphics card. 
We did consider offering a quick list 
of what uses what—a 10TB hard drive, 
for example, needs 7–10W—but the list 
would be too long, and there are online 
calculators that can do this for you. 
OuterVision has a good one that includes 
processor and GPU overclocking, plus 
it shows potential savings obtained by 
using higher efﬁciency ratings. 
Plan ahead. Are you ever going to 
ﬁt two graphics cards, or overclock? 
Specify for the most extreme your rig 
is ever going to get—you do not want to 
buy twice. Given the graphics system 
is where the pressure is, look for 
recommendations from graphics card 
manufacturers. For example, an Nvidia 
GTX 1080 Ti or GTX Titan asks for 600W, 
and 850W if you double up. Drop to a GTX 
1060, and 450W will cover things. 
AMD cards are more demanding—the 
Vega 64 is notoriously power-hungry. A 
single Vega 64 wants 600W, but a dual 
rig asks for 1,100W. The most extreme 
recommendations include a dual Vega 
64 Liquid Edition or quad GTX Titan; 
these want 1,350W. A four-card Radeon 
R9 Fury X tops this at 1,600W. Yowsers. 
If you plan to overclock, another 50–
100W should cover things, but you need 
a good clean current, so go high quality. 
There is no ideal value. It just needs to 
be enough to run everything without 
stressing the PSU—an extra 100W over 
won’t hurt; much more means paying for 
something you’ll never use. 
Some nice Japanese electrolytic capacitors help to smooth out the current. 
“If your budget has scope, go 
for a better quality PSU in 
preference to a bigger one.”

INPUT FILTERING
Switching introduces considerable 
interference, which you don’t want 
getting out into the mains supply.
BRIDGE RECTIFIER
An arrangement of four diodes that 
converts the AC current into a DC one, 
although a rather ragged one.
PRIMARY CAPACITORS
These smooth out the saw-toothed 
unregulated signal from the rectiﬁer. 
The better quality these are, the 
smoother and more reliable the signal.
SWITCHING TRANSISTORS
This switches power on and off at  
very high frequencies—about 25kHz.  
By adjusting the relative proportions, 
you can modify the output levels, so 
the PSU can deliver only the level of 
power required.
MAIN TRANSFORMER
Two induction coils on a ceramic ferrite 
core. These step down the input into 
usable voltages. It also isolates the 
mains power from your PC’s insides. 
Its main job is making a 12V supply; 
there may be a “tap” for 5V, too.
+5VSB TRANSFORMER
This provides the standby power.  
It is always active, even when  
the PSU is “off.”
SWITCHING REGULATORS
More transistors and diodes working as 
switching regulators on the DC current, 
rectifying and ﬁltering the current.
SECONDARY CAPACITORS
Also used to smooth out signals, this 
time on the regulated DC current, ready 
to go outside the box to the case.
TOROIDAL COILS
An inductor made by wrapping wires 
around a donut-shaped ferrite core. 
The magnetic ﬁeld generated by the 
current through the wire induces 
a current in opposition. This resistance 
helps smooth out interference. There 
is quite a bit of this inside a PSU, and 
hence several of these in various sizes.

however, it is a pretty good indication of 
what you will need. For example, a Ryzen 
1700X has a TDP of 95W. Under very heavy 
test loads, it actually needs feeding about 
105W. An i7-6900K has a high TDP of 140W, 
and needs about 148W at its absolute worst. 
These ﬁgures are enough to run the rest of 
the system put together. The most extreme 
desktop chip is AMD’s Threadripper, which 
has a TDP of 180W. 
The processor isn’t the big one, though—
that’s the graphic card. The technology has 
really bloomed over the last few years, but 
so has power consumption. Originally, the 
PCIe slot was enough; it carries 75W, taken 
from the motherboard’s 12V feed. This was 
soon supplemented by a six-pin PCIe power 
connector, 
which 
added 
more 
12V 
power lines direct from the PSU, and 75W. 
A second six or eight-pin connector added 
up to another 75 or 150W, bringing our total 
to a potential draw from one graphics card 
to 300W. This pretty much matches the rest 
of the system, including processor, added 
together. Some cards are going beyond the 
PCIe 3.0 speciﬁcations by using two eight-
pin PCIe connectors, for a maximum of 
375W. PCIe 4.0 is expected to standardize 
this, or something similar, shortly.
The novice mistake is to spend your 
budget on a big wattage supply that you 
don’t really need. One matched to your 
components, with a moderate amount of 
breathing room, is enough. If your budget 
has scope, go for a better quality PSU in 
preference to a bigger one. Look for better 
ripple suppression, high-quality capacitors, 
fan and energy efﬁciency, sophisticated 
circuit protection, and such, rather than 
just getting the biggest headline number 
of watts. It’s about supplying the power 
reliably, efﬁciently, and smoothly for the 
whole life of your rig. Get it right, and you 
won’t be buying another for some time.

LET’S BE HONEST, this laptop is a lot 
of dollar. No, seriously: 3,650 of the 
smackers straight from your wallet and 
into a not-so-portable 17-inch, RGB-lit, 
behemoth of death. That aside, there’s 
good reason for the high price tag, and 
Gigabyte’s Aorus has certainly garnered 
a reputation recently for being quite 
the premium brand around the gaming 
sphere. Aorus is to Gigabyte as Shelby is 
to Ford. Well, maybe that’s being a touch 
too generous, but you get the gist. The 
X9 is currently one of the world’s better 
specced slimline-yet-powerful gaming 
laptops, featuring dual GTX 1070s in SLI, 
a quad-core Intel Core i7-7820HK CPU, 
32GB of DDR4, and a whole bank of PCIe 
solid-state storage to boot. But the big 
sellers reside with the screen and the 
keyboard (see below). Available with 
either an IPS 4K panel or a 1440p 120Hz 
VA panel, it’s entirely your choice as to 
whether you want a faster refresh rate 
or crisper visuals. –ZAK STOREY

Mech Heaven
The beauty of the X9’s design 
stems from its mechanical keyboard. 
With slim manufactured switches, these 
genuinely feel like the real deal. 
Impressively, Gigabyte has incorporated 
this without shifting the hardware 
around, or affecting the overall size of 
the device.

It’s up to you what screen you 
play with on the X9. You can 
either go for a more color-
accurate IPS 4K 60Hz affair, or, 
if you like your games buttery 
smooth and vibrant, a 1440p 
120Hz VA panel is available 
instead. However, there’s no 
sign of any form of sync here.
3 Subtle Lights
OK, so you can tell this 
is a gaming laptop. Whether it’s 
the hawk head on the trackpad, 
the sports car style air vents, 
or the angular design of the 
body, there’s little about this 
that says sophisticated. That 
said, the included RGB lighting 
is actually quite subtle. And 
we’ve gotta say, we like it.

DEPUTY EDITOR
A NEW DESK
I love custom desks. I’m not talking 
about crazy liquid-cooled gargantuan 
super-desks, but something a little 
more standard, yet still unique to me. 
My current setup is a cheap and simple 
reclaimed wood affair. Basically, I 
grabbed a ton of free pallets from my 
local wood recycling center, stripped 
and sanded them down, slapped them 
across ﬁve feet of 2x4, distressed 
them a little, painted them white at the 
request of the wife-to-be, and then 
sat them on top of two Ikea trestle 
legs, with a reinforced glass top. It 
looks lovely, but a little haphazard. 
Different pallets meant different-
height planks on top, and although the 
glass alleviates the effect somewhat, 
it’s starting to niggle at me, especially 
after a year and a half of use. So, then: 
new year, new desk, new build…. And 
screens. Oh god!
The biggest expense with the old 
desk was the glass top; this time, I’m 
going to invest my money in better 
quality wood, legs, and a few creature 
comforts instead, in an effort to 
make something that feels far more 
premium than the last one.
I’d love to include one of Ikea’s 
integrated wireless chargers, and 
get some smart cable management 
in as well. Warm LED backlighting is 
a must, and with my plans to invest in 
two 32-inch 4K screens from the likes 
of ViewSonic, a dual monitor arm is 
needed too. There’s a lot to it. I’m no 
carpenter, but I’m quite positive this 
shouldn’t be too difﬁcult to pull off….
SHUTDOWN TIMERS
Ever needed to run your rig for a speciﬁc length of time? If, like 
us, your download ETAs run late into the night, sometimes it’s 
easier to run a shutdown timer to get the job done. There’s a ton 
of free programs that do this, but we ﬁnd good old command 
prompt does the job best. Open a command prompt, and type 
“shutdown -s -t XXXX” where the Xs are the time in seconds 
that you want your system to wait before shutting down.

Apple iPhone X
Once you’re properly inside, 
there’s not much to see beyond 
a whole lot of battery.

FEB 2018
BACKGROUND
Ten years ago, Apple introduced the ﬁrst iPhone. Now we’re 
taking apart the 18th iteration—the iPhone X. With its rounded 
edges and edge-to-edge display, we’re sure this is the iPhone 
Steve imagined all those years ago—but now that his dream is 
realized, will it be as inﬂuential as the ﬁrst? Time will tell…. 
MAJOR TECH SPECS
•  A11 “Bionic” chip with neural engine and embedded M11 
motion coprocessor
•  5.8-inch OLED multitouch 2436x1125 (458 ppi) Super Retina 
HD display 
•  Dual 12MP cameras (wide-angle and telephoto), with f/1.8 
and f/2.4 apertures, and OIS
•  7MP TrueDepth camera with f/2.2 aperture, 1080p HD video 
recording, and Face ID
•  Support for fast-charge and Qi wireless charging
•  Our A1865 global unit has broad cellular band support as 
well as 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi, MIMO, Bluetooth 5.0, and NFC
KEY FINDINGS
•  The iPhone has come a long way in 10 years—so long, that 
the design has cycled back a bit, and this looks more like the 
original than we’ve seen in a long time. As with the iPhone 8, 
Apple has banished the unsightly (and environmentally 
responsible) regulatory markings from the back. 
•  The pentalobe screws at the bottom look weirdly unﬁnished 
—the bottom ones are more like pins. Luckily, they haven’t 
rearranged too much else, as our typical trifecta of iOpener, 
iSclack, and iFixit Opening Picks works, as in the past.  
•  Looks like sideways-opening iPhones are here to stay. 
Inside, a single bracket covers every logic board connector—
we’ve never seen this kind of connector density. We’re faced 
with tri-point screws standing sentry over any repairs once 
you get past the pentalobe screws guarding the door. 
Something tells us Apple doesn’t really want us tinkering. 
•  We ﬁnally free this most dense of logic boards to get a closer 
look—it is incredibly space efﬁcient. Comparing the two 
boards, the iPhone X motherboard is about 70 percent of the 
size of the iPhone 8 Plus board—more space for battery. 
•  The dual rear camera has a beefy bracket that looks like it 
might offer some bendgate-prooﬁng support for the delicate 
components. The cameras are also secured to the rear case 
with some foam adhesive to keep things from jostling out of 
place. These cameras really need to stay put for Portrait 
Mode and similar features to work their magic. Surrounding 
the camera housing cover glass, you can see tiny spot welds, 
likely holding the walls of the camera bump to the case.
•  Repairability Score: 6 out of 10 (10 is easiest to repair). 
Display and battery repairs remain a priority. A cracked 
display can be replaced without removing the biometric Face 
ID hardware. Liberal use of screws is preferable to glue—but 
you’ll need Apple-speciﬁc drivers (Pentalobe and tri-point), 
in addition to a standard Phillips. Waterprooﬁng complicates 
some repairs, but makes difﬁcult water damage repairs less 
likely. Fussy cables tie unrelated components into complex 
assemblies—expensive and troublesome to replace. Glass 
on front and back doubles the likelihood of drop damage—
and if the back glass breaks, you’ll be removing every 
component, and replacing the entire chassis. 
The iPhone X has arrived! 
Here’s the ﬁllin’ inside that 
glass sandwich.
Time to show off some 
double tweezer action 
while removing the 
lightning connector.

Make a Secret Kill
Switch for Your Pi
1
CREATE YOUR NEW USER ACCOUNT
Although you probably already have a user account on your 
Raspberry Pi, create a new one for this project by opening 
Terminal on your Pi, or connecting via SSH, and running:
 sudo adduser name
>> Add your new user as an Administrator with:
 sudo adduser name sudo
>> Substitute “name” with your chosen username [Image A].
2
CREATE YOUR NUKE SCRIPT
You should stay logged into the “Pi” user for now, and run 
the following command:
sudo nano /etc/security/security.sh 
>> In the new window, enter the following [Image B]:
 #!/bin/bash              
 read password    
 # If the username and password match...          
  if [ “$PAM_USER” = “name” ] && [ “$password” =
 “nukepassword” ]
 then         
 #Begin Nuke Process        
 echo “Nuke is starting.”        
 #Securely erase the home folder        
 srm -rvvv /home/name/        
 echo “Home folder has been erased.”
IF YOU’RE WORRIED about the somewhat Orwellian notion of a forced disclosure of passwords, this 
coding project posits a rather radical solution to the dilemma: Create a second password for your 
user account, which, instead of logging you in, nukes your home folder using special tools. 
As extreme as this sounds, it’s surprisingly simple to set up. A couple of disclaimers: Make sure 
you back up your personal data to a safe place before going ahead with this project. Also, bear in 
mind that it’s not an infallible method, because anyone with physical access to your machine may 
seize it before you have a chance to ﬂip this kill switch. –NATE DRAKE

 echo “RAM is clean”             
 echo “User data has been nuked.”

MODIFY THE SCRIPT
In the code, you need to substitute “name” and 
“nukepassword” for the username of your new 
account and the desired nuke password. Make sure this is 
different from your current one. You also need to change 
the line “srm -rvvv /home/name/” to reﬂect the path of 
your real home folder.
B
A
In addition to the “srm” command in the nuke script, 
which securely erases the home folder, you may 
have noticed that there are two other commands: 
“sﬁll” and “smem.” Remove the # at the start of these 
lines to overwrite the free space in the /home folder, 
and clean any ﬁles in the Pi’s virtual memory (RAM) 
respectively. This takes much longer than the “srm” 
command on its own, but is a good deal safer.

RUN NUKE SCRIPT ON LOGIN
Make your nuke script executable with the command:
 sudo chmod a+x security.sh
>> Next, run
 sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-auth
>> This opens the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). Find 
the line starting “auth    [success=1…” and change this to “auth   
[success=2…” Immediately below this line, type the following:
 auth  optional  pam_exec.so expose_authtoklog=/tmp/pam.log  
 /etc/security/security.sh

INSTALL SECURE DELETE TOOLS
Run the following command:
 sudo apt-get install secure-delete
This installs the tools that are necessary to erase your home folder 
securely [Image C]. 
D
C
6
MIGRATE YOUR DATA (OPTIONAL)
If you previously had personal data in another user 
account, you should take this chance to move data 
across from that account to another from your backup 
drive. If you wish to delete the originals, do so using the 
new secure-delete tools, for instance:
 srm -r /home/bob/Pictures
 
 
7
TEST YOUR NEW ACCOUNT
Reboot your Raspberry Pi and log into your new 
user account using the normal login password 
[Image D]. Take a moment to check that your ﬁles are 
where you need them.
8
TEST YOUR NUKE SWITCH 
If your data is backed up, there’s no harm checking 
that your nuke password works. Reboot the 
Raspberry Pi once again. Select your new username and 
enter the nuke password. The system will hang while it 
removes your ﬁles.
9
CHECK NUKE LOGS
You can still connect to the Pi via SSH while the 
nuke script is running. Use the following command 
to check the progress of the nuke:
 cat /tmp/pam.log
>> Any further attempts to log in just take the user back 
to the login screen [Image E]. 
E
A nuke switch may appeal to your sense of 
melodrama, but it’s likely that if an unscrupulous 
person seizes your Pi, they will make a copy of the 
contents of the SD card before trying to enter the 
password. Ideally, you should encrypt your home 
folder before using this script. Even if it does work, 
the script cannot delete itself, so it will be obvious to 
everyone that you have “gone nuclear.”

Harden Your
WordPress Security
1
HARDEN LOGIN
Log in to WordPress, navigate to “Users > Your Proﬁle,” 
scroll down, and click “Generate Password” to create a strong 
random password. Copy this somewhere safe (such as to your 
password manager), and click “Update Proﬁle.”
>> Next, let’s set up two-factor authentication, which means 
that even if someone breaks your password, they can’t log in to 
your account without your mobile device and a suitable app, such 
as Google Authenticator or LastPass Authenticator. Go to “Plugins 
> Add New,” and install Two-Factor Authentication from David 
Nutbourne. Click “Activate,” click the plugins icon to enable it, then 
scan the QR code into your mobile app [Image A].
2
INSTALL ALL-IN-ONE PLUGIN
Go back to “Plugins > Add New” to install All In One WP 
Security & Firewall, a 100 percent free plugin from Tips 
and Tricks HQ, which contains all the tools required to add multiple 
layers of security to your account. Once activated, look for the 
green shield icon in the left-hand pane, and click it. You’re whisked 
to a dashboard with a handy Security Strength Meter. Chances are 
its score is incredibly low [Image B]. 
>> Start by scrolling down to the Critical Feature Status. These 
four switches need to be on, so click the ﬁrst one, which allows 
you to change your username from the unsafe default (“admin”) to 
something more personal. Click the switch, then click “Edit User” 
to change your username. Also, switch to the “Display Name” 
A SELF-HOSTED WORDPRESS SITE—one not hosted on http://wordpress.com—is one of the easiest 
ways to build and maintain an independent web presence, whether it’s a blog, online magazine, or 
even an ecommerce store. But one thing that’s often overlooked with WordPress is security.
In this tutorial, we’re going to perform a security audit, and enact several additional layers of 
protection to “harden” your WordPress installation. Not only will you be surprised to learn how 
vulnerable your WordPress-powered site has been up until now, but you’ll also be relieved to learn 
that, armed with the right settings and plugins, you can close most of its loopholes.
There are plenty of other ways in which you can toughen your WordPress installation, too. First, 
make sure everything—WordPress itself, and any plugins and themes you’ve installed—is fully up 
to date. Second, perform an audit of all the plugins you have installed: Search for reviews to check 
they’re legit, make sure you only install through the WordPress website, and remove those you 
don’t need or use to free up resources. Once that’s done, you’re ready to make your WordPress site 
more resilient to hijackers and other malicious attacks. –NICK PEERS

REDUCE BRUTE-FORCE ATTACKS
Return to the main dashboard and click “Login 
Lockdown.” Start by checking the “Enable Login 
Lockdown Feature.” This allows you to block speciﬁc IP 
addresses when they attempt—and fail—to log in. You have 
control over the number of failed attempts, and the time in 
which those attempts occur, plus how long the IP address

is locked out. You can also instantly lock out attempts using invalid 
usernames, although a safer bet may be to add “admin” to the 
speciﬁc username list [Image C], now you’re no longer using it. 
Click “Save Settings.” You can be notiﬁed by email whenever an IP 
address is locked out, or just check the “Failed Login Records” tab.
4
ELIMINATE BRUTE-FORCE ATTACKS
Go further by restricting the opportunities for brute-force 
attacks. Select “Brute Force” under the WP Security icon, 
where you’ll ﬁnd several options for keeping hackers away from your 
site. Some can be potentially dangerous—”Rename Login Page” is 
one such option, but so long as you remember the name you give 
your wp-login.php page, you won’t have any problems [Image D]. 
Other options include using cookies to block brute-force attempts, 
and a “Login Whitelist” tab, where you can restrict access to speciﬁc 
IP addresses or ranges. If you’re tempted by this option, be sure 
to check with your Internet provider that your public IP address is 
static, or you’ll end up locking yourself out when it next changes.
5
MORE ESSENTIAL TWEAKS
Click “File Permission” to review the current permission 
settings of your WordPress installation ﬁles. Hopefully, 
they’re correctly set to prevent outside interference, but if not, you 
can click “Set Recommended Permissions” next to any that require 
it. Also consider disabling PHP File Editing, if you don’t normally 
edit these ﬁles.
>> Next, select “Scanner” to perform a check for ﬁle changes. 
This is a benchmark scan, so no problems will be detected—going 
forward, enable the automated ﬁle change detection scan to be 
alerted to any changes that could indicate the presence of malicious 
activity. The “Malware Scan” tab merely redirects you to a paid-for 
solution that provides a more robust scan for $6.95 a month.
E
6
SWITCH ON FIREWALL
Finally, click “Basic Firewall” to switch on the 
ﬁrewall, but click the link allowing you to back up 
your .htaccess ﬁle ﬁrst—just to be on the safe side (this is 
backed up to your web space, so you need to download it 
using FTP or via your site host’s control panel). Review the 
other options, too—for example, blocking remote access to 
the debug log ﬁle still allows you to access it when logged 
on through FTP. Also consider enabling the 6G Blacklist 
Firewall Rules [Image E]. Note, if any plugins stop working, 
either disable features or consider replacing them with 
similar plugins that do play nicely with your hardened blog.
7
LIMIT USER ACCESS
If your blog is used by more than one person, make 
sure you’re the only Administrator, and grant the 
minimum level of access required to other users for them 
to do their jobs. WordPress supports a wide range of 
user roles [Image F]—for those contributing to your blog, 
consider Author or Contributor to limit them to posting and 
managing their own posts. For trusted users, Editor allows 
them to manage other posts as well. Some plugins add 
additional levels—WooCommerce adds a Catalog Manager 
level, for example. 
F
D
Protect yourself further by encrypting the connection to your 
blog using the secure HTTPS protocol, insulating you against 
malicious scripts, protecting data submitted to your site by 
visitors or customers, and improving search engine rankings.
You need an SSL certiﬁcate to encrypt the connection, and 
this is done through the provider hosting your WordPress 
blog. You can purchase an SSL certiﬁcate, but check to see if 
your provider supports free certiﬁcates from Let’s Encrypt. If 
it does, you can encrypt your website for free—note that Let’s 
Encrypt certiﬁcates need renewing every three months.
Once set up—you may need to wait a few hours for DNS 
servers to update—install the Easy HTTPS Redirection 
plugin into your WordPress installation. Once installed and 
activated, switch it on under “Settings > HTTPS Redirection.” 
If you later get warnings about insecure content, install and 
use the SSL Insecure Content Fixer plugin to resolve them.

already built in to EAC. Finish clicking through the installer, then 
run EAC when prompted.

WIZARDING WORLD
There’s a wizard to get through now, but it’s a good one—it 
sets EAC up just about perfectly. First up: conﬁguring your 
optical devices. If you have more than one drive, you can select 
which one to use for ripping, although we recommend allowing 
EAC to conﬁgure both at this point. Different drives have different 
characteristics, and one may turn out to be better than the other in 
terms of stability and accuracy—given that an ultra-accurate rip is 
our goal, the better your drive the better. 
>> But wait: Conﬁguring your drive involves inserting a disc, and 
when you do, you’ll likely be interrupted by an alert [Image B] to set 
up AccurateRip. This service calculates the speciﬁc offsets of your 
drive’s laser, in order to compare the precision of your rips with 
OK, GRANDPA, it’s time to trash that dusty old CD collection, or at least consign it permanently to a 
box in the garage, by shifting it all to a purely digital format. But if you’re going to go through your 
whole collection, it pays to do it right the ﬁrst time, and that means ripping to a lossless format in 
a way that accurately replicates your discs. Once it’s there, you can do as you like with it; had you 
ﬁlled a hard drive with 128Kb/s MP3 ﬁles, you’d inevitably have to go through the whole task all over 
again later on. 
Our format: FLAC. Not only because it’s lossless and doesn’t introduce any compression 
artefacts, but because a same-res rip is up to half the size of the PCM WAV ﬁles that raw CDs 
carry. We’ll use Exact Audio Copy, which can both rip to FLAC and generate the relevant CUE ﬁles 
to perfectly duplicate a CD. It can also compare your rips against a database of known good rips, 
to ensure your captured sounds are 100 percent sound. Note that ripping CDs is neither explicitly 
allowed nor disallowed by 1947’s copyright-deﬁning Title 17 (funnily enough), but if you keep them 
to yourself, you should be OK. –ALEX COX

others online. This part’s a bit ﬁnicky—it asked us for three 
subsequent “key discs” after the original, and summarily 
rejected anything that may have been pressed more than 
once. So, you might need to search the more obscure 
corners of your collection to satisfy AccurateRip. It’s not 
essential, but it’s worth doing.

FURTHER CONFIGURATION
With AccurateRip out of the way, EAC’s own drive 
inspection can complete. Don’t panic if it looks as 
though EAC has crashed at this point. It probably hasn’t; 
give it a couple of minutes to complete. If it’s still spinning 
its wheels after that, you have permission to panic. When 
the results arrive, ideally you’re looking for caching to 
be a “no,” accurate ripping to be a “yes,” and C2 error 
information as “yes”—if these prerequisites aren’t met, 
you can still rip, but your digital copies might not be as 
accurate as they could be. Continue on through the wizard, 
and select FLAC when given the option of ripping formats, 
insert an email address (literally any email address will do, 
it doesn’t have to be valid) to link EAC to the Freedb track 
metadata service, and set your track naming scheme. 
Leave EAC in beginner mode for now.

TEST IT OUT
Before we rip our ﬁrst disc, there’s a small amount 
of additional conﬁguration to do. Hop up to “EAC > 
Compression Options,” and open the “External Compressor” tab. 
FLAC should be set up by default; hit the “Test Compressor” button 
to ensure the FLAC encoder is properly installed and working, 
and to automatically set the appropriate value in the bitrate box. 
Note that this won’t affect your eventual rips, because they’ll 
exactly match CD resolution. Next, head to www.pastebin.com/
EVHsFtWm and paste the parameters we’ve squirreled there into 
the “Additional command line options” box, to ensure that every ﬁle 
is tagged properly with as much information as possible.

LET HER RIP
Time to actually turn a CD into some FLAC ﬁles. Drop a 
target disc into your drive, head back to the main interface, 
and check the button on the top bar that looks like a CD with a red 
plus button next to it. Click the drop-down button next to it, and 
you’ll be able to select your metadata provider from one of two 
Freedb sources (realistically, there’s nothing between them) and 
CueTools DB. Select the latter for now, and click the button to drag 
in a bunch of information about your disc, including the cover. If it’s 
been released a number of times, you’ll want to select your speciﬁc 
version here [Image C]. When your track information has populated, 
click the “CMP” button on the left of the interface to start ripping 
your FLAC compressed ﬁles.

6
CHECK, CHECK
There’s not much you can do but watch the bars 
while the ripping process completes [Image D]. 
Don’t be concerned by the mention of .wav ﬁles at the top 
of the ripping window, because EAC pulls these down 
ﬁrst before converting them to FLAC, and it does away 
with them afterward. When everything’s complete, you’re 
shown your results, ﬁrst from AccurateRip (if you’ve made 
it though the arduous testing process), and then from 
CueTools DB. Here you can discover just how well your rips 
landed, and ﬁnd out about any dropped frames or errors 
encountered during the process. And that’s it, although if 
you’re concerned about the discs more than the tracks on 
them, you may wish to try using the “CUE” button on the 
left of the interface to generate a single massive .wav ﬁle 
with an associated .cue that exactly replicates the contents 
and track spacing of the original CD. 
D
Good news: Google Music accepts FLAC ﬁles, as long 
as your rips are broken up into tracks rather than in 
one enormous ﬁle. Bad news: They’re converted to 
MP3 as soon as they get there, and your source FLACs 
aren’t stored. It’s not the worst thing in the world, 
as Google does keep perfectly listenable 320Kb/s 
copies of your originals as long as the resultant ﬁle is 
smaller than 300MB, but it’s not suitable for backup 
if you’re concerned about staying lossless.
Spotify, which streams Ogg Vorbis ﬁles, doesn’t 
play nice with FLAC. You need to double up and 
convert your FLAC ﬁles to MP3 or Ogg Vorbis using 
a tool such as FlacSquisher (http://sourceforge.net/
projects/ﬂacsquisher) to add them to your library 
locally, and the service is yet to make good supplying 
its teased hi-ﬁ streaming tier to all but a few select 
testers. When it does, we expect local FLAC support 
to roll in, too, but there’s nothing conﬁrmed as yet.

Create Artistic Blur
in Photoshop
1
FIND YOUR FOCUS 
Selecting the sharp parts of your image is achieved with the 
Focus Area tool from the “Select” menu. This is a largely 
automated tool, with just a couple sliders to ﬁddle with, and 
selectors to add and remove areas from the selection. Open your 
image ﬁle, and choose “Select > Focus Area.” It gives your CPU 
fan a quick blast of speed, then settles down to show you the sharp 
areas of your image. You can choose how this is displayed from 
the “View Mode” drop-down on the “Focus Area” pop-up window, 
with the red of a Quick Mask or the checkerboard background of an 
empty layer available, along with other options.
2
IN A SNAP
The Add and Subtract tools to the left of the pop-up window 
are for adding to or removing areas from your selection. We 
left the two sliders on “Auto”—there’s a checkbox on the right of 
them—and used “Add” and “Subtract” to ﬁne-tune the selection 
[Image A]. You can output the selection in a variety of ways, but we’ve 
chosen the traditional selection with the marching ants outline. Hit 
“OK.” You can then reﬁne the selection further with “Select” and 
“Mask,” perhaps softening the edge with a little feathering, or 
turning on “Smart Radius” edge detection to snap the selection 
more tightly to the edge of your subject [Image B].
3
GO POP-EYED 
Invert your selection with “Select > Inverse,” and you now 
have the unsharp areas selected. To make the sharp subject 
pop out, we can blur the background as if we’d used a larger 
aperture setting on the lens when we took the photo. This is useful 
PHOTOGRAPHERS SPEND A LOT OF TIME ensuring their pictures are sharp—thousands of dollars’ 
worth of autofocus system will help you out, but there’s slightly more to it than that, just as cranking 
open your aperture may decrease your depth of ﬁeld, but also introduce some softness to your 
subject, unless you’re using the latest lenses, which can be mind-blowingly expensive.
Blur is an aesthetic issue, and as such, is subjective. Where one person may see the beauty of 
a small subject enhanced by a blurred background, others see a missed opportunity to show us 
what’s there clearly. This is where post-processing comes in. Photoshop has many tools to add blur 
to your images—some subtle, others less so—and even one to select areas of your image depending 
on how sharp they are. You can get enormously artistic with them, creating a masterpiece of 
blurred colors and details, or just ensure your subject pops out of a photo by blurring a distracting 
background away. The choice is yours. –IAN EVENDEN

are limited by tiny sensors and short focal lengths, even 
though some have pretty good light-gathering capabilities, 
with lens apertures of f/1.8 or wider.

PIN POINTS 
From the “Filter menu,” select “Blur Gallery,” then 
“Field Blur.” This ﬁlter uses control points, or pins, 
to differ the intensity of the blur in different areas of your 
image. We’ve started at the top with a strong blur, then 
lightened it as we proceeded down the side of our ﬂower, 
before strengthening it again at the bottom , but you can do 
whatever suits your image best. Use the slider on the Blur 
Tools palette to increase or decrease the intensity. You can 
move your pins by dragging them with the mouse, or delete 
them by selecting one, and hitting Backspace.  
5
GET BUSY WITH THE BLUR 
As we made a selection before applying the ﬁlter, 
you can place a pin right on top of an area you want 
to remain sharp, and as long as it’s outside the selected 
area, the blur has no effect—what does happen is that 
the effects of that pin are felt in the area between it and

the next pin, anywhere that was selected. You can even 
place a pin outside your image if needed, to draw the right 
amount of blur across the corner of the photo. Hit “OK” at 
the top when you’ve ﬁnished blurring, and a progress bar 
appears while your blurring is rendered and ﬁnalized. 
6 
EYE-CATCHING EFFECTS 
Another of Photoshop’s blur tools that’s worth 
looking at is the Iris Blur, which is found in “Filter > 
Blur Gallery,” just underneath “Field Blur.” It’s useful for 
blurring the edges of an image, so attention is drawn to the 
focal point or subject. In this way, the eye of the observer is 
guided to where you want it to look, rather than catching on 
some insigniﬁcant detail elsewhere.
7 
ADD INTEREST WITH IRIS 
Iris Blur places an oval over your image, and blurs 
everything outside of it, plus a little inside, as 
deﬁned by a series of draggable spots. There’s only one 
control slider, for the intensity of the blur, so it seems 
there’s not a great deal of depth to this tool—until you 
discover that you can place more than one oval. These are 
positioned using a pin system, just like Field Blur’s, each 
with an oval surrounding it, which can be rotated, resized, 
and repositioned as you like.
8 
NATURAL BEAUTY
The outer ring of the oval marks the point at which 
the blur reaches 100 percent of its intensity, as set 
in the Blur Tools palette [Image C]. The inner ring marks 
0 percent, and there’s a smooth transition between the two. 
This means you can have a sharp transition or a longer one, 
depending on the look you’re trying to achieve [Image D]. 
It’s easy to create something unrealistic here by using too 
much blur, or making the transitions between blurred and 
unblurred too sudden. To keep it natural, try combining 
both Iris and Field Blur, to gently soften the background of 
a photo, while maintaining the sharpness of the subject. 
D
C
Pixels are, of course, the basic building blocks of any raster 
display technology, but Photoshop uses them in a slightly 
different way when it comes to blurring or sharpening your 
images. Tools such as Unsharp Mask measure the intensity 
of their effect in pixels, because increasing the slider 
increases the distance the application looks for differences 
in contrast between pixels that may constitute an edge. 
Sharpening your image increases this contrast, and it 
becomes more obvious the greater the number of pixels that 
are counted as edges. Blurring an image, on the other hand, 
evens out the contrast, and averages the pixels over a greater 
or lesser area, depending on how many pixels you have 
chosen to select via the slider. In brief, more pixels means 
more of an effect, no matter whether you’re sharpening your 
image or blurring it.

ZAK STOREY, DEPUTY EDITOR
LENGTH OF TIME: 1–2 HOURS
Editorial Upgrades
UPON OPENING THE CHASSIS and dodging the 
cloud of dust containing every respiratory disease 
known to man, we bore witness to the true horror 
of an unloved PC. The panels, once standing proud, 
pristinely showcasing the hardware within, sheared 
off the side of the case with an eerie screech, the 
ﬁlth and grime breaking free as the thumbscrews 
gave up their long vigil protecting the beating 
heart of the machine inside. Fan blades littered 
the ﬂoor—the slow ravages of hard time in this 
technological gulag had stripped the polypropylene 
scythes from their housings. As once free-moving 
bearings glinted in the ephemeral twilight of the 
photography studio, we began to realize that this 
was unlike any horror we’d witnessed before.
The executive editor’s PC lay in ruins. Working 
hard, day in, day out, for years on end, to produce one 
of the world’s best-selling custom PC magazines, it 
was a rig that had suffered much. Yet all was not 
lost; this was not the end for the BitFenix Shinobi. 
Its pseudo Japanese-German heritage would live 
on, we would make sure of that.
The challenge that lay before us was undeniably 
daunting. Even though it was only ﬁve years of age, 
this machine had been through a lot. And with its 
vast arsenal of computational prowess within, once 
the pride of its generation, now falling defunct in 
its dotage, it stood in stark contrast to the other 
mechanical mammoths beavering away in the 
Maximum PC ofﬁce. The task at hand was simple: 
Sanitize it, gut it, and install the latest available 
hardware, bringing the lumbering beast of burden 
back to glory, to bear its might upon the transistor-
fused world once more.

LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: HAZARDOUS 
We’re not even sure what happened to this rig, but 
with lots of TLC, we injected it with a new zest for life

CLEANING THE UNCLEAN
RIGHT! Now we’ve got that out of the way, let’s talk about what 
we’re replacing in our executive editor’s machine. This isn’t a 
simple new build, but more of a core upgrade to some legendary 
componentry. And, while we’re at it, an attempt to retain that old, 
beaten chassis—because, y’know, we’re sadists.
This machine once hosted an Intel Core i7-3820 quad-core 
32nm processor, 16GB of quad-channel DDR3, an Asus X9 X79 
Pro motherboard, a Sapphire Radeon R9 390 GPU, a half-working 
Thermaltake 240mm AIO CPU cooler, a 250GB Samsung 840 Evo, 
and a 3TB WD Red hard drive.
To keep things fairly simple, and encourage good system 
maintenance, we’ve opted for a few more industrially centered 
components to power the magniﬁcent Shinobi and give it a bit 
more processing grunt. It may be powering a 1920x1200 screen 
(yep, one of those), but that’s no reason to deny it the juice to deal 
with more demanding titles destined to come out in the future.
We’ve gone for an Intel Core i7-7700K running at stock, a dual-
channel kit of 16GB DDR4, one of PNY’s GTX 1080 XLR8 cards, and 
a Gigabyte Z270X-Ultra Gaming mobo. But the more important 
changes come in the form of cooling. This time, instead of a liquid 
cooler, we’ve gone for one of Noctua’s NH-C14S towers, paired 
with two Noctua NF-A14 IP67-rated, dustproof, industrial-grade 
140mm fans. We’ve also included four 120mm EK Vardar Evos: 
one at the front, in the 5.25-inch drive bay, as an intake; two in the 
roof, exhausting; and one in the rear, also acting as an exhaust. 
We’ve also kept the massive 230mm BitFenix Spectre in the 
front, because it’s still too good an offer to pass up.
IT’S STAGGERING THAT this liquid cooler worked as long 
as it did, diligently cooling the Core i7-3820 for almost 
ﬁve years. However, it does illustrate how imperative it 
is to give your rig a good clean once in a while. Dust, 
grime, and condensation are major killers for hardware 
like this, and keeping your CPU cool should be one of 
your top priorities. We’re not saying go crazy on the 
cleaning, but every three to six months, take your rig 
outside, and take a can of compressed air or even a foot 
pump to it, to get rid of excess dust inside the chassis. 
In fact, this is why we recommend windowed cases, so 
you can avoid the “out of sight, out of mind” philosophy.
UPGRADING A CORE SYSTEM is much like building 
a new rig. In this case, we started by taking a can of 
compressed air and attempting to blow out as much 
of the dust as we could. Then, we removed as many 
panels as possible, before doing the same again, and 
began to remove the cooling after that. This gives you 
the opportunity to grab a microﬁber cloth and clean up 
any fans going back in, along with the areas on which 
they were mounted. We replaced a lot of the fans, so it 
was less of an issue, but if you’re reusing them, it’s not 
a bad idea to clean off the blades in particular, before 
installing them back into the chassis.

AND IN WITH THE NEW. Now we’re talking. Next up, you’re going 
to want to unplug everything from everywhere. You can leave 
the PSU installed in the chassis, especially in older cases. Then 
it’s a case of removing the old motherboard and installing a 
new one. It’s often easier to install the processor outside of the 
chassis ﬁrst. Fortunately, thanks to the Shinobi’s massive CPU 
cut-out, installing the backplate for the Noctua can be done 
after the motherboard is installed into the chassis. It’s also 
imperative (with this cooler) that you install the memory now, 
too, because the cooler will cover all the slots.
AND THERE YOU GO: one updated, cleaned-out system. We 
took some isopropyl alcohol to the soft-touch ﬁnish in an 
attempt to try to remove some of the grime and damage 
from the chassis, but there’s only so much you can do with a 
case this old, unfortunately. And don’t worry about that old 
quad-core Extreme Edition chip—it will be going off to work 
in a new home in our IT department, happily sauntering on 
toward retirement.

OUT WITH THE OLD
CABLES GALORE
COOLER MANAGEMENT
FINISHING UP 
WE’VE GOT TO GIVE CREDIT to BitFenix—the Shinobi XL is 
nothing if not well equipped. With four USB 3.0 ports and a 
powered USB port on the front of the chassis, ﬁnding places 
to route all of that front I/O was challenging. Fortunately, 
the Z270X Ultra Gaming comes packing two USB 3.0 
headers just south of the 24-pin. Impressively, we managed 
to route those two cables, plus the 24-pin, and the single 
8-pin PCIe power through a single rubber grommet—and, 
to be honest, it still looks fairly tidy, too.
SWAPPING OUT FANS on 
these kind of coolers isn’t 
ever going to be a picnic, 
especially given the nature 
of the clips that secure the 
fans in place. Because this 
is essentially a second-
hand tower cooler, the 
clips aren’t quite as rigid 
now as they should be. 
To counter this problem, 
we used a single cable tie 
between the top clip on 
the top fans and the top 
clip on the bottom fan, 
to secure them on place. 
Additionally, to generally 
tidy up the cables, we’ve 
wrapped them into small 
loops, to reduce mess. 
Because these fans are 
technically designed for 
radiators and case fans, 
the cables are fairly long, 
and so require a fair bit 
of inventive management 
to ensure they don’t get 
caught on anything.

We ended up using a three-
way PWM splitter to power 
the two fans in the roof and the front 
of the case, because the mobo didn’t 
have enough headers.

The Shinobi still had an 
archaic AC97 audio cable 
attached to the HD audio cable—
take a pair of scissors and cut it off 
to reduce clutter, and you should 
be ﬁne.

This 1,500W PSU is a bit OTT 
(about seven times too much) 
for this build, but it would be an 
unnecessary expense to change it 
over, and it still works a treat.
4
We moved both the hard drive 
and the SSD to the lowest 
rungs to allow for better airﬂow 
toward the GPU.
IT’S ALIVE! OK, so it wasn’t really dead to 
begin with, we’ll admit, but it was certainly in 
dire need of some TLC. The Intel Core i7-3820 
at its heart was an intriguing part for its time. 
Competing directly with the Core i7-2700K, it 
made little sense in the PC ecosystem, much 
like Intel’s current Kaby Lake X parts do. A 
quad-core Extreme Edition processor, back 
in the 32nm days? Odd. That said, it served its 
purpose, and played all the latest games and 
the programs needed to produce a magazine 
without a hiccup.
The build process, despite the excessive 
levels of dust and blackened hands we ended 
up with during construction (we’re still not 
sure what caused that; mold probably), was a 
relatively painless process. Using compressed 
air helped a ton with the initial clean-up, and 
after removing the fans and going over the 
whole build with a microﬁber cloth, it started 
to resemble a new chassis again. We have to 
give credit to BitFenix’s design team from back 
in the day, because this case is still fantastic 
to build in. Especially if you have a modular 
power supply. Fortunately, our Shinobi isn’t 
the windowed version, so cable management 
in this build was less about aesthetics and 
more about function than anything else. 
But it’s all about performance, and 
although neither storage nor memory capacity 
have changed much with this upgrade, the 
key 
components—CPU 
and 
GPU—have. 
And what a difference they’ve made. Single 
and multicore performance saw almost a 
50 percent improvement in performance, with 
graphics performance stomping its way up by 
a massive 100 percent in some cases. 
In its day, AMD’s Radeon R9 390 was an 
incredible piece of ﬂagship technology, but 
comparing it to Nvidia’s Pascal architecture 
is akin to comparing an ant to a cat. The 
difference is staggering. It’s difﬁcult for us, 
in the short term at least, to quantify just 
how much of a change the additional cooling 
solutions have added to this build, especially 
as we’ve swapped over processors as 
well. Hopefully, the IP67 ratings on the CPU 
cooling fans should ensure they last much, 
much, much longer than the Thermaltake 
stock fans that came with the previous AIO.
Things that are still due an upgrade? 
Outside of the case, there’s not a lot. It ﬁts 
the bill perfectly for the tasks we need it to 
do. Perhaps a Samsung 850 Evo would make 
more sense as a primary OS drive, because 
those read speeds are a little on the slow side, 
but aside from that, it’s all set for another ﬁve 
years of hard labor. At least until the case 
begins to rot away…. 
Our zero-point for this build was the system prior to its upgrades, featuring an Intel Core i7-3820, 16GB (4x 4GB) of quad-
channel DDR3, a Sapphire Radeon R9 390, and a 250GB Samsung 840 Evo.

WHY DOES THIS CARD even exist? Let’s get 
one thing straight: Unless you’re deep into 
cryptocurrency mining, this generation’s 
GPU war is over. Nvidia has won. Vega, 
although powerful, can’t compete from 
a price perspective, and thanks to its 
horrendous power draw and delayed 
launch, it’s not an attractive proposition for 
gamers. Vega 56 was the most intriguing 
offering, slotting between the GTX 1070 and 
the GTX 1080. And that, presumably, is why 
Nvidia has brought this card to market. The 
problem, however, is that in its eagerness 
to secure every corner of the GPU market, 
Nvidia has cut off its nose to spite its face. 
What do we mean? Allow us to explain….
The best way to understand why this card 
is such a confusing proposition from Team 
Green is to take a look at the basic specs of 
the models either side of it. The GTX 1070 
touts 1,920 CUDA cores, 120 texture units, 
and 8GB of GDDR5; the GTX 1080, on the 
other hand, features 2,560 CUDA cores, 
160 texture units, and 8GB of GDDR5X. 
That’s a pretty wide gap, especially with 
the memory conﬁguration. But when you 
consider that the 1070 essentially equates 
to a Titan X of Maxwell’s generation, it’s 
fair to say that both cards are attractive 
offerings for anyone looking to game at 
1440p or higher.
The GTX 1070 Ti, then, features 2,432 
CUDA cores, 152 texture units, and 8GB of

Best scores are in bold. Our test bed consists of an Intel Core i7-7700K, 16GB of Corsair DDR4 @ 2400,  
an Asus Maximus IX Hero, and a 500GB Samsung 850 Evo SSD. All games are tested at their highest  
graphical profile, with AA turned up, at 1440p.
GDDR5. That’s a difference of 128 CUDA 
cores between it and the GTX 1080. To 
put that into perspective, the difference 
between the GTX 1060 3GB and 6GB variants 
is—you guessed it—128 CUDA cores. If 
you’ve followed us for a while, you’ll know 
we stand by the GTX 1060 3GB as being the 
better value card, purely because, in our 
tests at least, the difference between it and 
its 6GB brother is just 1–2fps, and that’s 
with half the memory capacity.
INSANE IN THE GAME
It should come as no surprise, then, that 
in our tests the GTX 1070 Ti and the GTX 
1080 perform almost identically, even 
when compared against some of our more 
overclock-heavy aftermarket models. The 
maximum disparity between the two at 
1080p was 3fps; 5fps at 1440p; and 4fps at 
4K. That’s insane when there’s about $90 
difference in price between the two.
The lines become even more blurred 
when you enter the realms of overclocking. 
There were plenty of rumors concerning 
Nvidia requesting that AIB manufacturers 
not produce “overclocked” variants of 
its GTX 1070 Ti. And when you combine 
that knowledge with the fact that there’s 
an “advanced” sticker covering the word 
“overclocked” on our Asus GTX 1070 Ti box 
(no, seriously), well, we’ll leave you to be 
the judge of what’s really going on. But the 
fact is, you can easily add 220MHz on to the 
core clock, and 350MHz on to the memory, 
without temperature issues, and end up 
with scores and performance that actually 
surpass a stock GTX 1080. 
So, is this just a really dumb overreaction 
to Vega 56? Well, yes and no. We can sort 
of see the logic behind the design of the 
card. Firstly, GDDR5X is expensive to 
produce and in short supply. Secondly, the 
GTX 1080 has been out for near enough 
18 months now—if you were going to buy 
one, you would have done so already. What 
you’re getting with this is a GTX 1080 at a 
discounted price, which kind of makes 
sense. Nvidia gets to keep the prestigious 
nature of its product line, without calling 
it a cut-down or discounted GTX 1080, and 
at the same time, it shores up that extra 
acreage of market share. It’s a smart move, 
but if you recently bought a GTX 1080, it’s a 
bit of a slap in the face. –ZAK STOREY

WINTER IS HERE. Luckily, we have a new 
heater to keep us toasty through the 
coldest months of the year. A nice little 
space heater, and it’s even decked out with 
some sweet RGB lighting. Oh, and it’s a 
massively powerful gaming system, too. 
We’re talking, of course, about the 
Neuron, a high-end microATX custom 
build from Origin PC, outﬁtted in either a 
Phanteks EVOLV or Fractal Design Deﬁne 
Mini C case. The system we tested utilized 
the former, featuring tempered glass

Inside sits an Intel Core i7-8700K CPU 
overclocked to 5.0GHz, nestled in a nicely 
featured ROG Strix Z370 mobo from Asus. 
Intel’s Coffee Lake CPU shines here, able 
to stably handle Origin’s overclock up to 
5.0GHz. Origin’s Frostbyte 360 liquid cooler 
keeps CPU temperatures under control, 
hovering at just above 80 C during intense 
benchmarking load. 
It’s a good thing, because the rest of 
this system is a heat monster. The main

Our desktop zero-point consists of an Intel Core i7-6700K @ 4.5GHz, 32GB (2x 16GB) of Kingston HyperX

All games are tested at 4K on the Ultra Preset. 
a beast for gaming performance (more 
on that later), but also generate a ton 
of residual heat under intense load. We 
measured temperatures of 80–85 C both 
inside the case (measuring the outer panel 
of the top GPU) and pouring out the blower 
fans out back while playing games at 4K 
Ultra. These are well within normal GPU 
range, of course, and won’t throttle your 
performance, but it was still enough heat 
to warm our ofﬁce up a little. In a brief 
moment of genius/insanity, we decided to 
see whether we could cook an egg inside. 
The easy-open tempered glass panels 
functioned like an oven door as we popped 
an egg into a tin foil container on the GPU 
stack. It took about an hour, but the food did 
cook. You’ve had eggs over-easy—we call 
this eggs over-clocked. 
POWER OVERWHELMING
While it can pull double-duty as a backup 
breakfast oven, the Neuron’s primary 
function is that of an extreme gaming PC. 
That should be expected, with a pair of top-
end GTX 1080 Tis handling GPU duties, but 
it was still impressive to see in person. 
We ran all of our gaming benchmarks at 
4K, using the highest available graphics 
preset, and the pair of monster cards did 
not disappoint. In Rise of the Tomb Raider, 
the Neuron averaged 99fps across the 
three-part benchmark, returning 125fps 
in the Mountain Pass, 91fps in Syria, and 
81fps in the Geothermal Valley. More 
demanding was Total War: Warhammer II, 
which we tested using  DirectX 11 and the 
Battle benchmark. The score there was 
76fps, again at 4K max settings. 
Most demanding was Ghost Recon: 
Wildlands, a game that often cripples 
single-GPU systems, even when running 
at only 1080p. The Neuron was up to the 
challenge, but just barely, scoring 53fps 
using the Ultra preset—at 4K, of course. 
With a slight bit of tinkering, that number 
should stay above 60 without a problem. 
We also tested all three versions of 3DMark 
Fire Strike: The Neuron scored 34,380 in 
the regular Fire Strike test, 22,909 in Fire 
Strike Extreme, and 13,283 in Fire Strike 
Ultra, corresponding to performance at 
1080p, 1440p, and 4K respectively.
Unrelated to performance, but very 
impressive all the same, are the elegant 
RGB touches Origin has added to the 
already great Phanteks EVOLV case. All 
the components are tucked away tidily, 
while a strip of LEDs adorning the viewing 
panel gives everything a cool, pulsating, 
moonlit glow. This light show co-ordinates 
nicely with G.Skill’s Trident Z RGB RAM, 
an application of RGB lighting we thought 
was ridiculous on paper, but actually looks 
pretty awesome in person. 
All in all, we were very impressed with 
the Neuron, even if it does run a little on the 
hot side. Boasting top-end components 
(and a price to match), it’ll do just about 
anything you ask—including cook you 
breakfast. –BO MOORE

REMEMBER WHEN RYZEN ﬁrst launched? The 
gaudy little underdog pulled the rug out 
from under Intel’s feet with its eight-core 
masterpieces. It was beautiful, although 
not exactly smooth. The chips may have 
been legendary, but the platform was 
not. Memory issues and motherboard 
instability caused a lot of problems early 
on, and the selection of high-end X370 
offerings was slim at best. 
One form factor that was missing 
was ITX. And with good reason: Ryzen’s 
a hungry beast. Those eight cores need 
feeding with a lot of juice, which means 
most motherboards require a substantial 
VRM solution to balance out the horrendous 
level of power Ryzen draws from the wall. 
The issue, as is common with ITX, is a 
severe shortage of space. How do you 
accommodate such a power-hungry chip 
on a form factor that’s already so limited? 
There have been workarounds, of course, 
typically from those manufacturers with 
big R&D budgets. But, most of the time, 
the ITX form factor is avoided for anything 
featuring more than four cores.

us the X370-Gaming ITX. Both suffered 
from VRM throttling, however, especially 
when overclocking the eight-core parts.
Finally, though, we are witness to Asus’s 
Ryzen ITX masterpiece: the ROG Strix 
X370-I. It’s a true marvel of engineering. 
The huge bank of VRM situated alongside 
and above the AM4 socket provides a 
wealth of voltage balancing, without the 
need to include a large raised PCB, as 
seen in the company’s ROG Impact Intel 
ITX series. Instead, Asus has shifted its 
focus away from repositioning the VRMs to 
reworking the way it manages less integral 
motherboard components. In this case, it’s 
the audio and M.2 storage. Yep, that LED 
heatsink sitting just above the PCIe x16 slot 
is actually a raised chunk of separate PCB, 
which houses all the audio componentry, 
and supports the installation of a single 
M.2 PCIe SSD. It’s also situated above a 
small heatsink that simultaneously cools 
the PCH chipset. This makes a lot of sense. 
Typically, to improve audio, motherboard 
manufacturers introduce a polyethylene 
separator between the audio componentry 
and the rest of the motherboard’s PCB, to 
reduce interference from electrical signals 
on the board. The design seen in the ROG 
Strix X370-I, where the PCB is entirely 
separate and raised, is more often found in 
prosumer-grade DACs, such as the Schiit 
Gungnir, than in an A-grade motherboard. 
Now, we’re not saying the audio is going 
to be that good (there’s still an M.2 PCIe 
SSD on there, too), but it should equate 
to normal levels of audio quality, while 
freeing up space on the mainboard for that 
massive VRM solution.
So, on to performance. The X370-I is 
nothing short of a beast. We saw better 
scores here at stock than with any other 
X370 motherboard we’ve tested, which 
just goes to show how far the platform 
has matured in such a short time. Memory 
latency has plummeted as well. The only 
cause for concern we have is with power 
draw, because it topped our idle ﬁgures 
by 20 watts, and is the second highest 
motherboard we’ve tested under load.
But the biggy is overclocking, right? 
Well, it’s a mixed bag here. We only 
managed a stable 3.9GHz on our Ryzen 7 
1800X across all eight cores. 4GHz was 
just too far out of reach, alluding to the fact 
that even with all this motherboard magic, 
ITX still has issues holding higher clocks 
compared to its ATX rivals.
Asus’s ROG Strix X370-I is, ultimately, 
an impressive entry point to the Ryzen 
ITX ecosystem. It does have its ﬂaws, 
but it’s easily the best ITX AM4 board you 
can buy right now, and for that we have to 
applaud Asus. –ZAK STOREY

IT’S TEMPTING TO START by saying you can’t 
always get what you want, and in lieu of 
being able to afford a top-ﬂight monster, 
a budget chip like this will have to do. But 
questionable Rolling Stones references 
aside, it’s not the whole story when it 
comes to AMD’s most affordable Ryzen 
chip. This isn’t just a chip to turn to when 
forced to build on a shoestring; it’s a chip 
that shows how far CPUs have advanced 
in a year, and it’s a chip that punches far 
harder than its $100 price tag suggests. 
That single Franklin nets you a true 
quad-core processor. Yup, the sort of 
territory that was previously the preserve 
of a mainstream Core i5. The Ryzen’s base 
clock nominally runs at 3.1GHz, but you’ll 
rarely see it running the cores at that 
speed; instead it’ll operate closer to the 
Turbo of 3.4GHz. There’s no SMT included 
on AMD’s Ryzen 3s, presumably to help 
separate them from the Ryzen 5 chips, but 
it’s still a speedy chip, capable of handling 
four threads at once for bang on $100.
It should make for an interesting

BENCHMARKS
although we haven’t had those in our labs 
yet, so instead we’ve compared it to the 
8th Gen Core i5-8400, purely because 
that’s the chip to beat in the desktop space 
at the moment. On the face of things, that’s 
not a fair comparison, as the new Core i5 
is a six-core, six-thread chip, but it does 
cost double what AMD is asking for this, 
so bear that in mind when looking over the 
speciﬁcations and benchmark results.
Speaking of benchmarks, we can report 
there are no nasty surprises with the Ryzen 
3 1200—given the core count and operating 
frequency, it performs as expected. This 
means that it’s bringing up the rear of the 
benchmark tables, but it does so at a great 
price. The Cinebench R15 result of 478, for 
instance, may seem low compared to the 
Core i5’s 949, but in the context of price, 
you’re looking at a score of 4.78 per dollar, 
as opposed to 4.75 for Intel’s. Yup, you get 
more bang for your buck from AMD’s chip.
It is worth noting that the latest BIOS 
updates mean that the memory issues 
we saw at the launch of Ryzen have 
evaporated, and that getting the system 
up and running was a breeze. Gaming isn’t 
that big a differentiator anymore either, 
with a mere 2fps drop over the more 
expensive chip in Far Cry Primal. 
You’ll ﬁnd a Wraith Stealth cooler in 
the box alongside the CPU, and it’s a ﬁne 
cooler at stock performance. It’s worthy 
of its “Stealth” moniker, too. When it came 
to overclocking, we reached for our AIO 
cooler of choice, the NZXT Kraken X62, but 
you should be able to hit decent numbers 
with the Stealth as well. Overclocking the 
Ryzen 3 1200 is simple—set the target 
frequency in the BIOS (up the voltage if 
needed), and you’re done. In this case, 
we hit a stable 3.7GHz, which saw the 
Cinebench R15 score jump to 567 points. 
Overall, this is a lot of chip for not much 
money. If you need serious power, you 
should absolutely spend more, but if value 
is your main concern, there’s certainly a lot 
to love here. –ALAN DEXTER

PC TECHNOLOGY is pretty mature these 
days. That particularly applies to monitors. 
Usually, even a cursory perusal of the spec 
list gives you a good idea of what to expect. 
So, it’s not all that often a screen comes 
along and blows apart your expectations, 
but that’s exactly what the new Philips 
BDM4037UW pulls off. Unfortunately, it 
does so for all the wrong reasons.
On paper, it looks similar to its sibling, 
the BDM4065UC. That screen has been 
knocking around for a few years, but offers 
the same 40-inch diagonal and 3840x2160 
UHD native resolution. Both panels also 
leverage VA technology, and Philips claims 
similar speciﬁcations for everything from 
contrast to pixel response. Indeed, the only 
really signiﬁcant differences involve the 
BDM4037UW’s gentle panel curvature, and 
the fact that it’s a couple of years newer.
The former can be an acquired taste, 
but is at least a known quantity; that known 
quantity being a curvature of 3000R, and 
thus far less aggressive than most curved 
panels. The latter, you’d think, would, if 
anything, bequeath the BDM4037UW with a 
newer, more advanced panel, and perhaps 
some more reﬁned electronics. That would 
be no bad thing, given the old BDM4065UC 
had its fair share of image quality quirks.
Alas, no. The new BDM4037UW is a bit 
of a disaster. The main problem is what, 
in this day and age, can only be classiﬁed 
as appalling pixel response. Philips rates 
the panel at 4ms, versus 3ms for its more 
elderly sibling. But the gap feels more like a 
minute than a millisecond. The blurring and 
ghosting is absolutely grim. Unfortunately, 
ramping up the pixel overdrive setting 
in the on-screen menu barely puts a dent in 
the problem. Of course, VA panels have 
long suffered from the worst response of 
any of the major panel types, but it’s a while 
since we’ve seen anything this bad, and the 
older, ﬂatter 40-inch Philips has perfectly 
adequate response.
Another throwback to the bad old days 
of VA panels is the overly warm color 
temperature. It’s the kind of thing you can 
mitigate to some degree via calibration. But 
this is far from the most accurate LCD panel 
on earth, and you’re never going to achieve 
anything really neutral when it comes to 
temperature and overall gamut. While 
we’re sticking the boot in, the backlighting 
isn’t particularly strong, either.
What’s more, that shallowness of the 
curvature is such that it feels more like 
It’s big, but it ain’t beautiful

a gimmick than a practical feature. It’s a 
big old screen, so if you’re going to buy 
into the curved panel proposition, why not 
really go for it? The ﬁnal image quality 
demerit involves the viewing angles, which 
are merely mediocre. To all that, you can 
add a chassis and stand that look a little 
cheap and chintzy, at which point you’re 
probably thinking the BDM4037UW has no 
redeeming features. That isn’t quite right.
It boasts impressive contrast, with 
plenty of detail in black and white scales. 
It also renders virtually perfect, smooth 
gradients. Moreover, it’s still a 40-inch 
UHD panel, and that means it’s absolutely 
huge, and has literally millions of pixels. 
Just over eight million, in fact. That means 
oodles of desktop real estate, tons of detail, 
and an epic overall visual impact. What’s 
more, most of the time, that sluggish pixel 
response isn’t actually a huge drawback. 
It’s often not even that noticeable in games.
For those who want a very large screen 
and lots of pixels above all else, the Philips 
BDM4037UW holds a certain appeal. It’s 
just not a terribly robust appeal in the 
context of its $750 price tag. To take one 
example, Philips’ sister brand AOC offers 
the C4008VU8 with virtually identical specs 
for $250 less. Put simply, there are better 
options at this price point. –JEREMY LAIRD

BENCHMARKS
Best scores are in bold. Our test bench consists of an Intel Core i7-7700K, an Asus Maximus IX Hero, an Nvidia 
GeForce GTX 1080, 16GB of Corsair Dominator Platinum DDR4, and a Samsung 850 Evo 250GB OS SSD. 
combine the best attributes of an existing 
non-volatile technology like NAND ﬂash 
memory, 
which 
include 
solid-state 
robustness, with the speed of volatile RAM. 
Unlike NAND memory, which depends 
upon trapping electrons in an insulated 
gate, 3D XPoint uses bulk property change 
to alter the resistance of each memory 
cell, which in turn enables bits of data to be 
stored. The “3D” bit comes in relation to the 
stacked arrangement of the selector and 
memory cells, which are then connected by 
layers of interconnects, the idea being that 
multiple layers increase memory density. 
First-gen 3D XPoint involves two-layer 
technology, but Intel says future iterations 
will increase density both in terms of the 
lithography or size of the individual cells, 
and the number of layers.
Anyway, the upshot is a radically 
new memory tech that offers massive 
performance advantages. On paper, at 
least. With the new Optane 900P, we’re 
getting our ﬁrst chance for a true feel of 
what 3D XPoint can achieve in practice. 
Right from the get-go, what it can achieve 
is stellar. One of our pre-testing routines—
call it a habit if you like—is to completely 
ﬁll a given SSD with data, then delete it 
all before beginning testing. It’s a crude 
methodology, to be sure, but it does cut out 
the possibility, albeit one that applies more 
to older drives, that an SSD only performs 
optimal writing to virgin cells.
This usually involves copying data 
sequentially from a source drive over USB 
3.0 at about 300MB/s. Typically, attempting 
to copy some ﬁles over to the test drive and 
then multiplying them through internal ﬁle 
copies results in a fairly dramatic drop in 
performance, to 100MB/s or even less. But 
not with the Optane 900P. It motors along 
with internal ﬁle copies at a full 1GB/s 
indeﬁnitely, or at least long enough to ﬁll 
this drive’s 480GB capacity. We have never 
seen anything like it.
Firing up our test suite throws up 
further impressive ﬁgures. The plain and 
dirty sequential numbers aren’t actually all 
that impressive. Don’t misunderstand us—
two-point-something GB/s for both reads 
and writes does not constitute slouchy 
performance. It’s just we’ve seen similar or 
even bigger numbers before from several 
conventional PCI Express SSDs based on 
NAND memory. Samsung’s 960 Pro can do 
over 3GB/s in certain metrics, for example.
Turn your attention to CrystalDiskMark’s 
4K random results, however, and you’ll see 
further evidence of what makes Intel’s new 
drive so special. For writes, only Intel’s own 
750 NAND drive comes close. But for reads, 
the new 900P tears the entire market a new 
one—342MB/s is not far off an order of 
magnitude quicker than any previous SSD. 
It’s also the fastest drive we’ve seen on our 
formal internal ﬁle copy test, which isn’t 
a huge surprise, given its performance 
during our pre-benchmark prep.
None of this comes cheap, of course. But 
then nor do the fastest CPUs and graphics 
cards. Considered in conventional GB/$ 
terms, and where good enough sufﬁces, 
this drive makes no sense. But if you want 
the best, it doesn’t look bad value in the 
context of $2,000 CPUs. –JEREMY LAIRD

RAZER’S YELLOW SWITCHES are paradoxical: 
at once very cool and really odd, super 
practical and annoyingly ﬁnicky, luxurious 
and squishy. We, frankly, didn’t like them 
one bit, but it’s not hard to tease out their 
practical beneﬁts. They’re silent, for a 
start; the only sound you’ll hear is the 
unavoidable tap of a key bottoming out, and 
a little soft rubbing of the actuation shaft. 
For those with nearby ears exasperated by 
the audible click of, for example, Razer’s 
own ridiculously loud green switches, this 
is a boon. The springs don’t ring, even if you 
give the base of the board a solid whack—
one of our biggest keyboard bugbears 
slashed through on the list. They’re also 
incredibly sensitive. There’s no debounce 
delay, 
thanks 
to 
Razer’s 
upgraded 
transmission technology, and the company 
claims a 0.0mm distance between the 
actuation and reset points, and just 1.2mm 
travel to actuation. With a meager 45g 
pressure required to overcome the force 
of the springs, and no tactile bump, this 
keyboard feels as though you could type 
just by breathing heavily near it.  
Damn, though, we did miss that bump. 
While 
there’s 
still 
deﬁnite 
feedback 
coming from the springiness of the 
keys, their light nature means errant 
keypresses are incredibly hard to avoid, 
particularly if you’re sporting heavy 
ﬁngers and questionable motor skills. 
And the feedback that’s there really isn’t 
that great either. It’s spongy, bouncy, 
soft—everything mechanical keyboards 
shouldn’t be. If it weren’t for the light 
touch of its linear mechanism, we’d have 
whispered quietly that this was even 
moving toward the experience of typing 
on a dome-switched keyboard. Smooth, 
Yellow it from the rooftops!

silent, and mechanical may be your dream 
combination; it absolutely wasn’t ours.
The TE Chroma V2 has a lot going for 
it, even if those switches are contentious. 
It’s tenkeyless, giving it a tight footprint, 
but that amputation hasn’t left it lacking 
on the scales, as this is a heavy, unmoving 
slab of a keyboard. Its small size makes it 
inherently portable, as does the removable 
USB cable, and your lighting preferences 
(set via Razer’s moderately awkward, 
but generally very useable, Chroma app) 
are stored onboard, so they’ll follow you 
wherever you happen to be, and sync with 
your other devices when you’re at home. 
Unlike earlier entries in the BlackWidow 
series, 
the 
keyswitches 
are 
slightly 
recessed above a white background, which 
makes the awesome RGB colors really 
pop. There’s a wrist rest, which carries 
the spongy theme beyond the keyboard. 
It’s fat—too fat, perhaps, depending on 
the position your tendons have seized 
themselves in after years of keyboard 
abuse. Nonetheless, it’s very comfortable, 
and clicks soundly to the front of the TE V2 
magnetically, as long as you don’t have the 
keyboard’s fold-out feet extended. When 
raised, the attraction isn’t as strong.
There are times when reviewing tech 
feels a little cruel—sitting here as an 
unashamed fan of the clack, mashing 
stoically away at a squidgy keyboard, 
intensely disliking the experience of doing 
so, and having to crush the hard work of 
some of the brightest engineers in the 
ﬁeld by telling you so. Particularly when 
the BlackWidow TE Chroma V2 is, in no 
uncertain terms, a brilliant keyboard, 
brilliantly designed, brilliantly bright, 
heavy, and thick, and crafted to be perfect 
for just the right user. The expertise and 
care that’s gone into it shines through, the 
upgrades from the previous generation 
all make sense. It’s an awesome thing. 
Objectively, it’s a win. Subjectively, it really 
isn’t. The wash of post-review separation 
anxiety isn’t there. All because of a little 
keyswitch; had this thing thumped on to our 
reviews desk with Razer’s loud, physical, 
visceral, excellent green switches, or even 
the bumpy-yet-silent orange variety, it 
would have been a whole different story. 
Maybe if the yellow switched version hits 
your desk, the same will be true—but 
that’s for you to decide. –ALEX COX

THIS IS THE IPHONE X of mice. Let us 
explain: When a new Apple phone comes 
out, packed with features, and highfalutin 
suits get wind of their colleagues getting 
one, IT departments the world over get 
tickets demanding an upgrade. Denial 
often results in mysterious breakages, 
previously functional iPhone 7s making 
their way down ﬂights of stairs or under 
Lexus tires. If the appearance of this mouse 
on desks doesn’t cause a rise in fraudulent 
pointing device button-snapping or latte 
spillages, we’ll be surprised.
Not that it’s the perfect mouse for 
everyone. For example, the MX Master 2S 
lacks the Lightspeed connection tech that’s 
been exciting us so much recently, falling 
back on Logitech’s older Unifying Receiver 
module—still perfectly speedy and OK 
for gaming, but not the twitchy winner 
that gamers crave. Unless you conﬁgure 
it, there’s no DPI switching on the mouse 
itself, with that function transplanted 
instead into Logitech’s Options software 
suite. The molding deﬁantly pitches it 
solely at right-handers. Fans of light mice 
may also be dissuaded. This is a heavy thing 
that really feels it; it glides smoothly and 
calmly, responds in a slick manner, tracks 
almost deliciously. We’re not entirely sure 
of the physical reason for its catamaran-
style base, other than looking a bit cool, 
and separating the sensor and associated 
functions from the wing pieces—the MX 
Master 2S moves perfectly well without 
any additional aerodynamics. 
WHEEL OF FORTUNE
It’s the features that’ll make it so business-
attractive. Let’s move down from the 
top. Two acoustically independent main 
buttons, completely separate from the 
main upper shell. A rubberized, but not 
sticky, metal mouse wheel, weighted and 
smooth, with the option to switch between 
ratcheted 
and 
freewheeling 
modes.  
That ratcheting isn’t a physical thing, 
either—hit a button, and it electrically 
activates a mild catch; spin the wheel 
fast, and the ratchet disengages, dropping 
back into place when you’re done spinning.

facilities with the knowing chunk of a clicky 
wheel feels really good. 
On the left edge, there’s a syrupy 
smooth thumb wheel, useful for scrolling 
side to side, or any other function you want 
to conﬁgure it for. Behind that, realistically 
too far behind to comfortably reach with 
your thumb, is a pair of sliver-thin buttons 
that we’ll skirt over, because this is the 
bit where we tell you what’s great about 
the Master MX, and they’re really quite 
awful. On the thumb rest, a hidden gesture 
control button. Down the wire—an entirely 
optional USB connection, useful only really 
when charging—is the aforementioned 
Logitech Options driver, which lives up to 
its name with a cornucopia of conﬁguration 
choices. Further on from that, Logitech 
Flow, a multiplatform rip-off of Synergy, 
which enables you to seamlessly move the 
MX Master 2S’s cursor between multiple 
machines, even going so far as to copy 
and paste between them. You can hook up 
several devices without it, too—the mouse 
itself saves conﬁguration of up to three 
individual machines, either via the Unifying 
Receiver or Bluetooth. 
It's 
an 
absolutely 
gimmick-laden 
package, then, in a well-built, attractive, 
comfortable shell. It’s easy to see how 
those features would be highly attractive 
to creatives, professionals, and desktop 
users, and inspire scurrilous envy in those 
who don’t get to play with them. It really is an 
iPhone mouse. But like Apple’s handsets, 
it brings with it a couple of negatives. 
First, 
the 
ecosystem: 
Unless 
you’re 
happy to stick with the stock settings, you 
absolutely must use Options, and we had 
a couple of issues with software crashes 
and incompatibility on our travels. Second, 
something of a narrow focus. Those side 
buttons are almost unusable, and the 
thumb wheel is of questionable value to 
all but a speciﬁc sector. The MX Master 
2S does more than enough to deserve the 
"Master" designation, but a few design 
tweaks might have seen it earn an even 
stronger superlative. –ALEX COX

IT ONLY TAKES ONE LOOK at the H700i to  
ﬁgure out that this case isn’t messing 
around. Technically, you could build 
a super-efﬁcient Core i3 system on 
a microATX board within its roomy 
chambers, but you wouldn’t be fulﬁlling 
the purpose for which it was designed. 
A tempered glass side panel, ﬂashy LED 
strips, and a central CAM fan controller 
are all intended for high-end systems 
to be housed within, and shown off like a 
gaudy museum exhibit. Unsurprisingly, the 
pricing follows suit: At $200, is it worth the 
outlay on your already expensive build?
First things ﬁrst: It looks great. 
Aesthetic 
judgements 
are 
never 
unanimous, but the atmosphere of quiet 
reverence in the Maximum PC ofﬁce as we 
unboxed the H700i speaks for itself. The 
simplicity of its front panel and mesh-free 
top work well with the full tempered glass 
side panel to create an unfussy, angular 
look. Our review sample is plain black, but 
white, blue-black, and red-black options 
are also available should you wish to color 
co-ordinate your GPU, motherboard, and 
the like. The roomy look of this model is 
facilitated by some smart internal design—
it’s easy to keep cables tucked away and 
components positioned neatly. The PSU 
is ﬁtted under a shroud at the base of 
the case, which also has three mounting 
brackets for 2.5-inch SSDs. In fact, there’s 
room for seven 2.5-inch drives in total—
although, to our eye, installing a drive in 
each of those bays would compromise the 
clean look quite a bit. Two are on top of the 
PSU shroud, and another is on the side 
wall, facing out toward the glass panel as 
a showcase piece. 
It’s also a huge case. The CPU and 
GPU clearance heights are 7.2 inches 
and 16.2 inches respectively, which is 
about as roomy as you’ll ﬁnd anywhere 
in the market. In addition to giving plenty 
of space for multi-GPU builds without 
compromising airﬂow, it also allows ease 
of access when you’re building inside the 
case. We installed a 120mm air cooler 
during our test build, but liquid coolers 
are equally at home in the H700i, thanks 
to its many radiator mount slots. There’s 
room on the front and top panels for a 
radiator with three 120mm or two 140mm 
fans, and plenty of elbow room to ﬁt them, 
too. Despite the sleek panels, absent of 
mesh, the airﬂow is decent within those

panels. Three fans ﬁtted to the front and 
one at the rear disperse the hot air amply.
While we’re on the topic of airﬂow and 
cooling, it’s time to touch upon the H700i’s 
big selling point: a central fan and LED strip 
controller. The four included fans are all 
connected to this controller, as are the LED 
strips along the glass panel side of the case. 
The controller’s connected up by SATA and 
USB cables, and neatly positioned behind a 
central pillar on the far side of the case—
whose panel can be popped off with one 
handy button press. Connecting additional 
fans is therefore straightforward—hook 
them up to the controller rather than on 
to the motherboard directly. Some users 
have reported problems with the CAM 
software since the H700i’s launch. Certain 
ﬁrmware updates have rendered the 
whole controller useless in some cases, 
although by the time of publication, it’s 
entirely possible that subsequent ﬁrmware 
updates will have remedied that. That said, 
Corsair has been running similar systems 
without the need for additional software 
for several years now, although admittedly 
without LED support. 
Happily, that’s the only stumbling block. 
Elsewhere, it’s plain sailing, from the ease 
of access when building to the quality of 
its construction and overall appearance. 
It’s right up in the nosebleeds when it 
comes to pricing, and does everything 
you’d expect such an expensive model 
to do. It’s worth researching the state of 
play on that fan controller before taking 
the plunge, though, and we only wish 
there were a cheaper variant, sans smart 
CAM technology. –PHIL IWANIUK

OFFERING PHOTO EDITING for newcomers, 
the enthusiastic amateur photographer, or 
even those pros who don’t care about things 
such as CMYK or 16-bit color, Elements 
has long punched above its weight. 
Offering 90 percent of Photoshop’s most 
useful features for a ﬁxed price, rather 
than an annual subscription, and available 
as a standalone app or in a bundle with its 
video-editing brother, Premiere Elements, 
Photoshop Elements is one of the best 
ways to get into “proper” image editing, 
rather than playing with ﬁlters and emoji.
The 
Elements 
interface 
remains 
unchanged since version 11, released in 
2012. The shift to a year in the app title, 
rather than a version number, makes it a 
bit easier to tell how old your version is in 
future, which can only strengthen the urge 
to upgrade to the latest annual release.
So, you get the familiar troika of Editor 
modes—Quick, Guided, and Expert, plus 
eLive for help and inspiration, and Camera 
Raw for developing raw ﬁles—to choose 
from, depending on what you want to do 
and your own skill level. As is often the 
case, new features are mainly found in 
Quick and Guided, although Expert does 
beneﬁt from a new auto-selection tool that 
should take some of the frustration out of 
selecting areas with detailed edges. 
It works well; dragging a square around 
an object in your image triggers a short 
Adobe’s image-editing app gets yet another update
pause, followed by the familiar marching 
ants outline of a selection. We tried to 
confuse it with a brown bear against a 
brown backdrop, but it homed right in 
on what we wanted. There was a bit of 
backdrop retained between the bear’s 
legs, but nothing we couldn’t sort out with 
a few clicks.
Elsewhere, there’s the ability to open 
eyes that were blinking when the photo 
was taken—as long as you have another 
photo of the same person with their eyes 
open—and a whole lot of guided edits for 
replacing backgrounds, creating double 
exposures, and more. 
Then 
there’s 
Auto 
Curation. 
The 
Organizer half of the app—which, as 
you’ve probably guessed—organizes your 
photo collection, has beneﬁtted from face 
detection in the past, but now gets new 
powers to choose the best out of a group 
of photos. It’s activated with a simple 
checkbox at the top-right of the Organizer 
interface, and as you might expect, is 
quite 
processor-intensive, 
especially 
if you import a large photo library. The 
app also creates a slideshow from the 
photos Auto Curate selects, so you can 
show off your skills to family and friends 
with little to no interaction on your part. 
It’s worth reviewing the system’s choices 
yourself, however, as we found it tended to 
choose pictures so similar as to almost be 
duplicates. Sure, they were good photos, 
but we only needed to see each one once.
Elements gets better every year, but 
the changes are never big enough to make 
current users upgrade immediately. For 
new users, it’s a compelling package, but 
Afﬁnity Photo, the challenger to Adobe’s 
crown, is less than half the price for a 
package that concentrates on editing, 
rather than organizing and automation. 
For its target audience, Elements 2018 
is the best all-round photo-editing app, 
with the auto-selection tool taking away 
one of the biggest frustrations many new 
users ﬁnd with Expert mode, and the 
new Guided edits enabling spectacular 
transformations of your photos, while 
gently teaching you how the app works. As 
long as you can stomach the price, it’s hard 
to go wrong. –IAN EVENDEN

VIDEO EDITING is a skill that comes with 
practice and study, but Adobe seems 
determined to slacken the learning curve if 
this latest release of its beginner-friendly 
movie editor is anything to go by. However, 
with a plethora of free apps available 
online, is it worth using a paid-for one?
Much like its brother across the page, 
Photoshop Elements, the additions to this 
2018 addition are heavy on the automatic 
processing and time saving. It even claims 
to be able to teach you video editing.
The interface remains much the same, 
with a preview window up top, timelines 
below, and ﬁxes and effects on the right—
maddeningly for Photoshop users, who will 
want them on the left. It’s an old-fashioned 
look now, with the icons appearing too 
large. The app is split in three, with Quick, 
Guided, and Expert modes, plus eLive and 
the Organizer. Quick gives you a single 
video timeline, plus two audio ones, for 
quickly chopping up a movie you’ve made 
with a single camera, such as your cell, 
while Expert adds more video tracks, and 
opens up the number of effects available. 
Adobe’s 
machine-learning 
and 
AI 
research is starting to come to fruition, 
and it shows in this release of Premiere 
Elements. Similar to the Organizer’s Auto-
Curate, Auto Trim assesses your video and 
cuts it into just the best bits. This is likely 
to produce a result that needs to be looked 
Channel Howard Hughes with the latest video app
over by human eyes, as the software can’t 
know what was important when shooting, 
but it does a reasonable job of discarding 
bits where nothing much happens, and you 
can customize the algorithm to focus more 
on people or action.
Then there’s Candid Moments, which 
hunts through your footage for the best 
single frames to pull out and treat as still 
images, even opening them in Photoshop 
Elements for you. You’re probably going 
to want to be shooting 4K footage to take 
best advantage of this feature, and it’s 
support for this high-res format, although 
not a new feature, that marks Premiere 
Elements out above the slew of free editing 
apps, many of which top out at 1080p.
What Elements does well is to take 
the hassle out of video editing. Despite 
strong showings from developers such as 
Avid, Wondershare, and Lightworks, the 
beginner-friendly nature of Adobe’s app is 
one of its strongest features. The Organizer, 
shared with Photoshop Elements, makes it 
easy to import and locate your raw footage, 
then in Guided mode you can learn how to 
ﬁx it up, be that by removing the distortion 
inherent in movies shot on action cams (a 
new feature), or improving a dull-looking 
clip with tweaks to brightness, color, and 
contrast. Adjustment layers, familiar to 
Photoshop users, make it easy to apply the 
same adjustments or effects to multiple 
clips, and you can record narration directly 
into the app, rather than importing it from 
elsewhere. There’s a full suite of DVD 
menus, titles, and captions for you to play 
with, and the Time Remapping tool lets you 
experiment with slow or fast motion.
Video editing can be daunting, and for 
beginners and advanced amateurs alike, 
the value of an app that holds your hand, 
but isn’t afraid to let go when you want 
to run free, is huge. If you only shoot one 
or two movies on your cell phone a year, 
a package like this may be overkill, but 
for anyone with ambitions that include 
multiple 
cameras, 
soundtracks, 
or 
animated graphics, you’re not going to ﬁnd 
much better out there, even if the price 
may give you pause for thought in the face 
of free competition. –IAN EVENDEN

A leap into the unknown leads to revelations
Assassin’s Creed Origins
WE DON’T KNOW what’s what. Assassin’s 
Creed is no longer an annual event, and no 
longer a game in which you hold down your 
controller’s right trigger, and run at things. 
It might take us some time to get over this.
No more right trigger—that now 
unleashes a heavy attack capable of killing 
an unfortunate civilian in a single hit. You 
now run at things while holding the A button 
down, and this simple switch is just the tip 
of a whole iceberg of changes.
Ancient Egypt suits AC, what with all 
those big stone monuments to run at, 
holding A. It’s a wider environment than the 
cramped streets of Victorian London we 
slunk through in Syndicate, bringing back 
memories of the dreadful ACIII’s forests. 
But in a good way. The weapons are suitably 
deadly, too, all with extra effects such as 
bleeding or poison baked into them. This, 
combined with gaining XP to level up and 
put Ability Points into a range of skills, 
makes Origins feel more like an RPG than 
the series ever has before.

softened up for the day these are no longer 
optional extras, and are only available in 
exchange for real money, but for now, it’s 
a free way of getting additional gear, and 
doesn’t affect the game in a negative way.
The extra year in development shows, 
and Origins is the best AC title since Black

Egypt, getting into trouble with invading 
Romans, before becoming—with your 
sister, in a neat parallel with Syndicate—the

The inevitable modern-day sections are 
forgettable. Apart from conﬁrming that AC 
and Watch Dogs take place in the same 
universe, they add little other than acting 
as a framing device for the main action, 
providing a rationale for why it’s happening, 
and the usual nonsense about orbs and 
Pieces of Eden continues to make everyone 
shrug just as it did in last year’s movie. 
Microtransactions are again liberally 
sprinkled through the game, although it

Guns, grit, and Germans in a blazing, if familiar, sequel
Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus
MACHINEGAMES’ SUBLIME retrofuturistic 
reimagining of a Nazi-dominated 1960s 
has been screaming for another visit. The 
New Colossus moves things on ﬁve months 
from The New Order, with BJ Blazkowicz 
recovering from the injuries he suffered 
while taking out General Deathshead.
Which explains why he’s in a wheelchair. 
This doesn’t stop him from taking out Nazis, 
of course, even on a submarine. The opening 
sequence—after cutscenes establishing 
BJ’s father as a white supremacist, dog-
shooting scumbag—seems trickier than 
the previous game’s. The supersoldiers 
make an appearance much sooner, and 
while you’re able to salvage a suitably large 
weapon from their smoking biomechanical 
corpses, we do miss the armored dogs.
The New Colossus keeps The New 
Order’s hub level structure, from where you 
can initiate missions by talking to the right 
person, and carrying out activities such 
as the infuriating fueling of a helicopter by 
pumping gas from your own ﬂamethrower. 
Once you’re out in the world, one in 
which Germany won the Second World War, 
the ever-present threat of bonkers sci-ﬁ 
creations to shoot at, but you’re not going to 
ﬁnd an open world here. It makes up for this 
with guns that have heft, weight, and plenty 
of ammo, enemies who are so evil it would 
be a crime not to shoot them, and an actual 
feeling of sympathy for BJ, who believes 
he’s blown it, fears he is about to die, and 
worries about his pregnant girlfriend.
While this is a suitable sequel to The 
New Order, it lacks some of the freshness 
of that game. We’ve seen a lot of this before, 
but where The New Colossus does shine, 
it puts up a blinding display. –IAN EVENDEN

and the United States has fallen to fascist 
domination, there are some imaginative 
sights to see. A ruined New York City is 
starkly beautiful, picked out in shades of 
brown and gray, and patrolled by enemies 
who have the good grace to wear yellow 
suits. Roswell, New Mexico, is all sunny 
skies and bright colors, as a parade passes 
through, and jets stage a ﬂypast overhead. 
Roswell is the “disguise” section, like 
the Nazi moonbase in The New Order, and 
is again marked out by your disguise being 
almost perfect until you take it off. It’s less 
inexplicable than in the previous game—
you do at least eventually get recognized 
by a dolt of a Nazi ofﬁcer—but the period 
before this is one of the game’s best, as you 
admire the wonderfully designed cars, and 
wonder why every book stall sells the same 
books in the same order. Must be some 
Nazi law. Later, something remarkable 
happens, but all in cutscenes—something 
the entire game is guilty of.

is a linear corridor shooter. It mixes things

BO MOORE, TECHNOLOGY EDITOR
IF YOU READ OUR REVIEW of the Origin PC 
Neuron (pg. 74), you’ll notice a bit of an 
oddity. That’s right, we cooked an egg inside 
a PC. No, this won’t be a regular addition to 
our testing suite, but it was a fun experiment 
that really demonstrates how toasty it can 
get inside our gaming machines. 
Anyway, let’s talk about our egg-cooking 
methodology. I got the idea when I noticed 
heat pouring out the blower-style fans on 
the back of the Neuron. The rig sports dual 
GTX 1080 Ti GPUs, each of which can get 
pretty hot in their own right. I measured 
temperatures around 80 C coming out of 
the air vents in the back, while the top of the 
GPUs inside measured as hot as 85 C. This 
was while running The Witcher 3 at 4K ultra 
settings (which looked amazing, by the way). 
Using a little boat made of aluminum foil, 
we cracked an egg and set it on the GPU 
shelf. The temperatures there were hot, but 
not quite hot enough to directly cook the egg 
from the bottom. What really did the trick 
was putting a second piece of foil on top, 
creating a nice little mini oven within the 
larger oven-like enclosure of the system. 
Even better, the Neuron’s Phanteks Evolv 
case is equipped with easy-open doors on 
hinges, making the whole process feel a bit 
like opening an oven to check on a frittata. 
Speaking of frittatas, that probably would 
have been a better egg dish for our PC 
cooking adventure. The sunny side up option 
we went with here didn’t really play well 
with our double-oven situation. It did cook, 
but wasn’t exactly the most palatable dish 
on the menu. The top was cooked to a hard 
shell, while the inside was a bit of a goopy 
mess. Edible, but not exactly tasty. Next 
time, I’ll opt for a baked frittata.
Yes, we really cooked an egg in a PC

So, I’ve ﬁnally ﬁnished the 
preparatory 
work 
for 
the 
big build I’ve got coming up: 
another treacherous liquid-
cooled system. All the parts 
have been requested, and the 
plans have been made (boy,

While the world cheers on 4K,

It’ll support 10K at 120Hz. The 
problem is driving that many

usually maintain 4K at 60fps in 
current games, perhaps with 
a few tweaks to the settings. 
5K is 78 percent more pixels

liquid metal instead, and then 
gluing it back down again. The 
results have been incredible.

average of 13.5 C. Don’t worry, 
we’ll have more on this and

issue (in case you’re as insane 
as I am.)
than 4K, and 10K is four times 
as many as 5K. Then double 
the requirements again to hit 
120fps. That would be over 14 
times as many pixels as 4K, or 
55 times as many as 1080p. If 
we assume an increase in GPU 
performance of 30 percent 
per year, it will take 10 years 
before GPUs can handle 10K 
panels at 120fps in games. 
Your grandkids will love it.

TESTED &

APPROVED 
CONTROVERSIAL DEP ED TIME. We don’t 
really talk about climate change here at 
Maximum PC. It’s one hell of a polarizing 
topic. But what is hard to ignore is how 
much waste we produce as a species. In 
particular, the trash that ends up in the 
oceans. Great for survivalists stranded 
on a desert island; less great for the 
things living in the sea. 
One of the things close to my heart, 
however, is coffee. I pick up a cup of the 
good stuff every day on my way to work, 
drink my beany beverage, and chuck the 
not-so-biodegradable cup in the trash.
It’s a pretty shitty statistic, but an 
estimated 500 billion coffee cups are 
thrown away each year worldwide, with 
more than 99 percent of them non-
recyclable. To combat this, I decided to 
try out a more permanent alternative to 
my coffee conundrum: an Ecoffee Cup. 
Designed in the UK, and shipped to the 
US by the power of Amazon, Ecoffee 
Cups are predominantly manufactured 
from recycled bamboo husk. BPA and 
phthalate-free, they come with a food-
safe silicone lid and sleeve, and are even 
dishwasher safe (although you should 
dodge the microwave). 
All in all, it’s a nice cup. There’s no 
plastic aftertaste, and the only downside 
is the slight smell of silicone emanating 
from the lid, which I assume will dissipate 
over time. It’s not exactly cheap, coming 
in at $16.31, but that said, I do now get a 
discount with my local coffee shop, and 
the satisfaction of knowing that I’ve cut 
down on the amount of excess waste I 
produce, too. –ZS

GOPRO HERO6 BLACK
GoPro’s latest Hero6 
Black takes everything 
you love about GoPro 
and ups the ante. It can 
do 
4K60, 
1440p120, 
and 1080p240, all with the excellent image 
quality and versatility we’ve come to expect. 
This is thanks to the new GP1 processor, 
which also adds HEVC support, improving 
image quality with better colors and 
dynamic range, and less noise.
The Hero6 has waterprooﬁng to 10m, 
and mount and accessory compatibility that 
includes everything you’d need. Its compact 
size allows it to go places other cameras 
can’t, including drones, helmets, and more. 
For the perfect way to capture your sweet 
aerial moves, look no further. Improved 
5GHz Wi-Fi also enables faster uploads.
There are a few caveats. First, battery life 
is short, so take a spare battery or three if 
you’re planning on a lengthier session. The 
digital image stabilization also isn’t quite 
as good as optical image stabilization, so a 
good grip or clip is highly recommended.
If you don’t need the higher resolutions 
and frame rates, the Hero5 Black is more 
affordable, but if you want the best action 
camera this side of 2019, you’re unlikely to 
beat the Hero6. Just make sure you have a 
PC that can handle the demands of HEVC.

FCIV UTILITY
I’ve 
been 
snifﬁng 
around cryptocurrency 
mining again. Mainly out 
of curiosity, but also to 
see if it’s worth doing. 
I found myself looking at NiceHash (www.
nicehash.com), with its promise of a simple 
interface and support for all the main mining 
algorithms. You do get paid in Bitcoins, 
regardless of what you’re mining, but as a 
simple solution, it’s got a lot going for it. 
You may have noticed that NiceHash 
isn’t my “pick,” though, and that’s because 
after downloading the NiceHash utility, I 
did something I don’t do enough. I decided 
to make sure that the ﬁle I downloaded was 
indeed the one that the originator intended. 
I veriﬁed the checksum. There are plenty 
of stories of installers being replaced on 
reputable sites, and malicious software 
ﬁnding its way into our systems.
Windows 10 ships with a tool for checking 
a ﬁle’s checksum, called certutil, and you 
run it from the command prompt. However, 
there’s another Microsoft tool called FCIV, 
or the File Certiﬁcate Integrity Checker, 
which is a bit easier to use. Download it from 
http://bit.ly/2BvfQKQ, then check the MD5 
checksum with “fciv -md5 <ﬁlename>.” Just 
make sure the checksum you’re comparing 
it to hasn’t been compromised as well.

so which did he use?

EXECUTIVE EDITOR ALAN 
DEXTER RESPONDS: Well 
spotted. That’s a typo on the 
ingredients list—it should 
be 480GB. Normally, you’d 
look at the price and realize 
what it’s supposed to be 
from there, but $145 seems 
low for a 480GB drive, and 
too high for 80GB, so we 
see the confusion. We did 
review the drive on page 86 
of that issue, showing the 
right capacity, but normally 
we’d get the ingredients 
list correct, and you 
wouldn’t have to guess. The 
usual gremlins have been 
blamed and given the boot. 
Apologies for any confusion.

December issue, dead-
center, under the headline 
for the lead story, “Today’s 
Best Upgrades,” was a 
picture of a Corsair ML120 
Pro case fan. Except for an 
enlarged photo of the cover 
shot printed on page 27, I 
found no mention in that 
article of the Corsair ML120 
Pro case fan, case fans in 
general, or any mention of 
the Adata XPG, or Crucial 
Ballistix Sport DDR4, also 
in the photo.
So, my question is: Did 
parts of the article that 
may have covered these 
components end up on the 
cutting-room floor, or was 
this photo picked because 
the color red in these 
components went nicely 
with the yellow and red 
theme of the cover?
Also, I’d like it if your 
writers could mention what 
the cut-off dollar amount is 
for the budget, mid-range, 
and turbo builds for “The 
Builds” section located at 
the rear of the magazine. 
They seem to never mention 
what that magic number is 
that they’re trying to stay 
beneath. 
–Michael Knight
EXECUTIVE EDITOR ALAN 
DEXTER RESPONDS: We 
originally had the ML120 Pro 
shortlisted to be included 
in the feature, because it 
is certainly the case cooler 
we recommend, but then 
realized it didn’t fall under 
the remit of being released 
in the last year. So, we still 
definitely recommend it, but 
it didn’t make the feature on 
a technicality. 
As for the prices we aim 
for on the builds at the back 
of the issue, they’re not 
actually set in stone, but 
more nebulous ideas that we 
feel are right for the current 
market. Today’s prices for 
RAM and SSDs mean that 
systems are a little higher 
than we would like, so we 
tend to fight harder to find 
good deals there, but the 
figures we’re aiming for 
are definitely subjective. Of 
course, if there’s a price you 
really want us to build to, 
drop us a line to let us know.
Stay Safe
I have not seen the removal 
of Safe Mode from the Fall 
Creators Update mentioned 
anywhere. Am I the only one 
who has noticed?
I recently plugged in a 
second Bluetooth receiver 
by mistake, and then things 
went downhill. The PC got 
stuck in an endless boot 
loop, from which I could not 
recover. In trying to boot 
into Safe Mode to attempt 
the removal of any bad or 
corrupt drivers, I could find 
no way to do so—not from 
a recovery media or the 
install media.
What is one supposed to 
do if they need Safe Mode? I 
ended up doing a complete 
reinstall, losing all my 
activated software.
–Lee Boszak
EXECUTIVE EDITOR ALAN 
DEXTER RESPONDS: Safe 
Mode is still present, though 
it has shifted around quite 
a bit in recent releases of 
Windows, so I’m not at all 
surprised that you think 
it’s disappeared. To find it, 
type “Safe” into the Start 
menu to open the Recovery 
options page in the Windows 
Settings panel. Here you’ll 
find two sections: “Reset 
this PC” and “Advanced 
Startup.” Click the button 
titled “Restart now” under 
“Advanced Startup,” and 
then, after a reboot, press 4 
to start Safe Mode. If you’re 
having problems getting into 
Windows in the first place, 
rebooting your machine 
three times by holding 
down the power button

Bits of Coin
I read with interest your 
article “The Rise of New 
Money” in the November 
2017 issue. I’m still having 
a hard time getting my head 
around how cryptocurrency 
works. I have two questions 
I’ve never seen addressed: If 
I don’t mine cryptocurrency, 
how do I obtain the 
currency? And let’s say I 
have obtained one Bitcoin, 
and its value currently is 
$5,000. Now I go to a retailer 
who accepts Bitcoin, and 
I buy a $1,000 TV. In what 
form do I get my $4,000 
change? Are there fractional 
Bitcoins? 
–Jack Mangold
EXECUTIVE EDITOR ALAN 
DEXTER RESPONDS: The 
time to mine Bitcoins has 
definitely passed, but you 
can still buy and sell them 
using a Bitcoin exchange 
(such as Kraken, Coinbase, 
and so on). Once you do buy 
Bitcoins (or a fraction of 
a Bitcoin), they’re held on 
the exchange in a wallet, 
and any leftover coins (or 
fractions of) are left in the 
wallet. At the time of going 
to press, Bitcoin is enjoying 
another one of its volatile 
moments, which has seen 
its price hit over $10,000. 
So, buying a TV would leave 
plenty of coin left in your 
wallet for future purchases 
or investment. We’ll be 
visiting cryptocurrencies 
again soon, with practical 
advice for dealing with them 
on a day-to-day basis.
Viewing Events
Great article on speeding 
up the PC in the December 
issue. It made me think that, 
aside from always trying to 
get more speed, one of the 
things that has always driven 
me crazy about Windows 
is all the “administrative 
events” reported by Event 
Viewer. Ever since Windows 
and I have known each 
other, it says that my 
DistributedCOM is not happy, 
and my DNS Client Events 
are trying to warn me about 
something. I have always 
been told that all this can 
be fixed, and that all I had to 
do was ask Mr Google. Well, 
when I tell Mr Google that 
“The application-specific 
permission settings do 
not grant Local Activation 
permission for the COM 
Server application with 
CLSID,” he coughs a bit, 
then launches me into 
complex, multi-option 
proposals for fixing this 
problem, which seem to be 
mainly suggestions from 
well-meaning folk.
So, my question to you is: 
Would you write an article on 
the best way to get rid of all 
these errors and warnings? 
Tell us what the most 
common ones are, and how 
to fix them. Tell us about the 
most serious. Let us know 
if it’s worth investing all the 
time I have to fix these. Hell, 
why not start a contest to 
see if anyone can show us 
a clear Events log. I’d even 
contribute to a prize.
 
–Len Babin
EXECUTIVE EDITOR ALAN 
DEXTER RESPONDS: That 
sounds like a reasonable 
idea. While you should 
always be able to find 
responses for the more 
esoteric problems, common 
issues should be easily 
found. Leave it with us.
Secure Knowledge
I believe that there’s a 
significant error in the 
“Secure Your Network 
Devices” article, which 
appeared in the December 
2017 edition. When 
discussing subnets and 
VLANS, the author claims 
that “You can identify which 
subnet a device belongs to 
by the first three numbers 
in your IP address….” 
That’s only true when the 
device is configured to 
use a 24-bit subnet mask 
(255.255.255.0). Granted, 
that’s probably the most 
common configuration 
out there, particularly in 
small and home offices, 
but it simply isn’t possible 
to determine a subnet by 
looking at the IP address 
alone. 
 –Phil Hoffman
EXECUTIVE EDITOR ALAN 
DEXTER RESPONDS: You’re 
absolutely right in terms of 
the bigger picture, but at the 
same time, this was written 
in fairly basic terms for 
anyone trying to secure their 
home network. And from an 
internal perspective, this 
is enough to just know that 
you’ve set up a device on the 
right subnet (assuming, of 
course, that you’ve set up 
the subnets yourself).
Sound & Vision
I just installed GeForce 
driver 388.31, and my 
motherboard sound 
stopped working. I did all 
the usual things—changing 
default sound device, 
uninstalling sound drivers, 
rebooting, and so on. I found 
a workaround by using 
the audio jack on my Asus 
display, driven by my GPU, 
but hardly optimal.
 
–Rona Matllow
EXECUTIVE EDITOR ALAN 
DEXTER RESPONDS: It sounds 
as though your audio drivers 
have defaulted to the HDMI 
output supported by your 
graphics, as opposed to 
the one that was on your 
motherboard. The standard 
response here is to go to 
the Sound settings in the 
control panel, and make 
sure you have headphones/
speakers selected as the 
default playback device, 
and not the Nvidia Output 
option. However, as you’ve 
said you’ve already checked 
this, it is probably down 
to a driver conflict. The 
solution here is to uninstall 
your current audio drivers, 
then reinstall them again 
(you’ll find the drivers on 
Asus’s website).

WHAT THE THREAT 
AGAINST NET NEUTRALITY 
MEANS FOR PC GAMING
On November 21, 2017, FCC chairman Ajit Pai announced 
his intent to “repeal the heavy-handed Internet regulations 
imposed by the Obama Administration and to return to the 
light-touch framework under which the Internet developed 
and thrived before 2015.” These plans to limit the FCC’s 
power and remove regulations protecting Internet users 
in the US will give companies like Comcast more power to 
shape how we use the Internet, despite Pai’s claim that “the 
FCC would simply require Internet service providers to be 
transparent about their practices, so that consumers can buy 
the service plan that’s best for them, and entrepreneurs and 
other small businesses can have the technical information 
they need to innovate.”

BUY CLEVER, and this build could cost you a whole lot less. There are at 
least $65 worth of mail-in rebates lurking in there, and we canvassed 
prices (worst luck) just following the end of a big sale period. Times 
were not the kindest to us—they may be kinder to you. With our mid-
range monster suffering price hikes across the board, we’ve bitten 
the bullet and made a few switches. Zotac’s GeForce GTX 1070 Mini, 
once a bargain, leapt up to $420, making spending an extra $30 and 
jumping to Asus’s nice-priced 1070 Ti far less worrying. To offset that 
and other rises (cough, RAM, cough), we’ve switched out the cooler for 
the lowest-end AM4-compatible radiator we could ﬁnd ($40 saving), 
and specced down the SSD just a little to save another $60. Not that 
these changes will impact the grand vision of this machine: Ryzen 5 
and that 1070 Ti in tandem will tear through 1080 and 1440p games, 
and you can push the clocks if you wish. 
THE MEMORYPOCALYPSE has reared its ugly head again. Our Ryzen-
compatible DDR4, which gave us a saving last issue of $3, has leapt 
in price by a worrying $30. The world needs more RAM, dammit, and 
soon. We’re not just going to sit here and take this gouging—we’re 
going to complain about it. But, equally, we can’t let memory tell 
us what to do, so we’re sticking with our recent switch to an easily 
upgraded Ryzen 3 setup, the chip of which you may be able to pick up 
for 10 or so bucks less if you check on the right day. To make up a little 
of the cash absorbed by that RAM, we tossed out our old MSI 1050 Ti 
GPU, and dropped in an equivalent superclocked EVGA version that’s 
$5 cheaper. Then we cursed at the out-of-stock L5 LITE SSD, which 
forced us to switch to its 3D version, and that cost an extra $7 on top. 
So, our budget system is less budget than before, but that’s still a hell 
of a machine for the price.

TURBO
Moving backward from liquid cooled AIOs is an odd thing to 
do—we’d only just gotten comfortable—but the results of 
Noctua’s stand-up cooler, developed in the chilly mountains 
of Austria, really do speak for themselves. Given adequate 
airﬂow inside your case, you’ll see stability, you’ll see results, 
and the fans are large enough that you likely won’t hear 
about it even under heavy load, provided you have room for 
the massive 140mm heatsink. Don’t let the taupe and brown 
hardware put you off—this is PWM-controlled air movement 
that can’t be beat. Brown means good, see? Doubling up 
with a second, equally brown fan on the other side is highly 
recommended, too—it’s a quick ﬁt, and a cheap extra. 
$80, www.noctua.at 
BACK DOWN MEMORY LANE AGAIN. Last issue, we complained about 
having to pull our high spec rig down to using a lower spec RAM kit: 
four 8GB sticks of RGB-ﬂavored G.Skill TridentZ that cost a whopping 
$10 more than the RAM from our previous build. This issue, that same 
kit has jumped up another $10. No, wait, missed a zero: $100. Our 
solution, given there’s no other option, is to take the hit. Our PSU has 
gone up in price, but staying modular and keeping the wattage up is 
all but essential, so we’ve stuck with that, too. One saving grace: At 
press time, the fantastic 12-core 1920X was on offer, absorbing pretty 
much every cent of the additional outlay elsewhere, and if you see a 
Threadripper for under $700, you are under orders to snap it up. 
On top of that chip, we’ve ﬁnally switched out the NZXT Kraken 
radiator for a more traditional air cooling solution. It’s a chunk 
cheaper, but Noctua’s NH-U14S, ﬁnally available on Newegg, really 
works—with the airﬂow of an additional 140mm NF-A15 fan, it drags 
through enough air to quell the heat of even a fully clocked 4GHz 16-
core processor in the throes of epic rendering.
This machine can do just about anything. Its GTX 1080 Ti is nigh on 
unstoppable, the Ryzen CPU is, though, being stared down by Intel’s 
eighth generation crop—a real, ahem, bulldozer—and sticking with a 
reasonably high-end RAM setup means we’re not going to be ﬁghting 
with any bottlenecks any time soon. Expect the lineup to change 
signiﬁcantly over the next few months, though, especially that case.
