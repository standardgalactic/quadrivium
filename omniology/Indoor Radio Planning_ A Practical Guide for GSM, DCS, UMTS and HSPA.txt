Foreword by Professor Simon Saunders
The compelling need for in-building wireless systems derives directly from the needs of the
people who use wireless – and that means, increasingly, all of us. We spend most of our time
inside buildings, whether in the ofﬁce or at home, at work or at play. Typically at least two-
thirds of voice trafﬁc on cellular networks originates or terminates inside buildings, and for
data services the proportion is still higher – probably in excess of 90%.
Yet for too long, most indoor service has been provided from outdoor systems requiring
high transmit powers, major civil engineering works and using a relatively large amount of
spectrum to serve a given trafﬁc level. This makes great sense for providing economical
initial coverage to a large number of buildings and for ‘joining the dots’ to enable wide area
mobility. However, ‘outside-in’ thinking is ‘inside-out’, from a technical and practical
viewpoint, when attempting to serve users with very high quality and coverage expectations,
and for delivering high data rate services within limited spectrum. Buildings offer their own
remedy to these challenges, by providing signal isolation from nearby systems and enabling
the fundamental principle of cellular systems – that unlimited capacity is available from
limited spectrum if the engineering is done right.
Despite these compelling beneﬁts, in-building wireless systems have hitherto been a poor
relation of the ‘mainstream’ macrocellular network operations. With relatively few enthu-
siasts and a wide range of different favoured techniques for system design and installation,
the ﬁeld has at times resembled a hobby rather than a professional activity. The industry
desperately needs best-practice techniques to be shared amongst a wider base of individuals
to serve the growing demand – there are not enough engineers for the buildings requiring
service – and for these techniques to become standardised in order to drive down costs,
improve reliability and drive volumes.
Given this background, I welcome the publication of this book. Morten Tolstrup is a
leading practitioner in the ﬁeld and an engaging and entertaining public speaker. He has
written a truly practical and helpful guide to indoor radio planning, which will enable a
much wider audience to convert their skills from the old world of two-dimensional networks,
comprising macro cells alone, to the new world of three-dimensional hierarchical networks
comprising macro, micro, pico and femto cells delivering services to unlimited numbers of
users. Following the simple guidelines provided, built on years of real-world experience, will
help to avoid some very expensive mistakes.

Most of all, I hope that this book will help to professionalize the industry and encourage
sharing of best-practice to the ultimate beneﬁt of end-customers for compelling wireless
broadband services.

Foreword

Preface
This is Not a Book for Scientists
This book is intended for the RF planners, to serve as a practical tool in their daily work
designing indoor radio distribution systems. It is not a complete book about all the deep
aspects and corners of GSM, DCS, UMTS and HSPA networks, or all the core network
systems. It is dedicated to the last 10–70 m of the network, the indoor air interface between
the mobile user and the indoor mobile network.
I have spent the past 20 years working on various parts of the exciting business of cellular
communication. During this time I have mostly focused on the planning of the radio
interface between the network and the mobile user, with a dedicated focus on indoor radio
planning. I have always tried to approach that small part of the systems that involved me, the
radio interface, from a practical angle. I have struggled with most of the books available on
these subjects mainly due to a theoretical level far beyond my needs. My hope with this book
is to present a level of theory that is usable and accessible for a radio planner with basic radio
experience.
I also need to emphasize that no matter the radio platform or standard, GSM, UMTS,
HSPA or 4G, as long as the interface between the mobile and the network uses radio
communication, it will always be a matter of a link calculation with a given signal-to-noise
ratio for a given service requirement. After all, it is ‘just’ radio planning.
The Practical Approach
I am not an expert in cellular, GSM, UMTS or HSPA systems, far from it – but I have gained
a lot of experience with RF design, especially with regards to indoor radio planning. An old
mountaineering saying is that ‘good judgment comes from experience, but experience is
often a result of bad judgment’. I have made my share of mistakes along the way, and I will
help you avoid making the same mistakes when designing and implementing indoor
solutions.
It has been my goal to include what I believe are the most important considerations and
design guidelines to enable the RF planner to design and implement a high-performing
indoor distributed antenna system.
It was not my intention to provide a deep hardcore mathematical background on RF
planning, but to present the most basic calculations of the various parameters that we need to
consider when designing a distributed antenna system.

I hope you can use the result – this book. It has been hard but also great fun to write it and
to revisit all the background stuff, projects and measurement results that are the basis for this
book. I hope you ﬁnd it to be a useful tool in your daily work. That was my intention.

This book would not have been possible if it was not for my many colleagues and friends

Introduction
I often think that we have now ﬁnally come full circle in the world of radio transmission. We
are back to where it all started: after all, the ﬁrst transmission via radio waves by Marconi in
1895 was digital, using Morse code.
These days we are heading for a fully digitalized form of radio transmission, often using
Internet Protocol (IP). Most radio services – broadcast, voice transmission for mobiles and
television transmission – are being digitalized and transmitted via radio waves.
Radio waves – what a discovery that truly has changed our world! The effect of
electromagnetism was discovered by H. C. Ørsted in 1820. Samuel E. Morse invented his
digital system, the ‘Morse code’, in 1840. Through copper wires the world got connected via
the telegraph line, and cross-continental communication was now accessible. Marconi
merged both inventions and created the basis of our modern wireless communication
systems, performing the ﬁrst radio transmission over an incredible distance of 1.5 kilometers
in 1895. Now we live in a world totally dependent on spin-offs of these basic discoveries.
Marconi struggled to transmit radio signals over a relative short distance: a few kilometers
was a major achievement in the early days. Later, radio waves were used to reach several
hundred thousand of kilometers into deep space, communicating with and controlling deep
space probes and even vehicles on Mars.
Would it not be fair if we could bring back Ørsted, Morse and Marconi, and honor them
by showing what we can do today, using the same principles: electromagnetism, digital
transmission and radio waves? I am sure that they and the many other scientists who have
formed the basis of our modern communication society would be proud. No one today could
even consider a world without easy wireless communication; our modern lifestyle is highly
dependent on those small devices – mobile telephones.
Things in telecommunications industry are progressing fast. These days we are not happy
with anything less than several Mbps over the radio interface, mobile TV, internet, email and
mobile media.
Back in the early 1980s I was working on NMT systems. We used analog modems and
were able to achieve up to about 300 baud over the mobile phone network. That was truly
amazing at the time. People could send a fax from their car and, if they could carry the 18 kg

mobile cellular phone battery included, they could have a portable phone with up to 30–60
min of talk time. The cost of these types of cellular phones was equivalent to that of a small
family car in the early days, so the market was limited to very few professional users. Over a
few years the price dropped to about an average month’s salary, and mobile phones were
getting smaller and smaller. Some were even ‘pocket size’ – if your pocket was big and able
to support a weight of about 1 kg, that was.
At some point I was told about a new futuristic mobile telephone system in the making
called GSM. The plan was to convert the voice to data, and the network could support 9600
baud (9.6 kbps), 32 times more that we could do on NMT! This was an amazingly high data
speed – higher than we could get over ﬁxed telephone lines at the time. I remember being
highly skeptical. Who would ever need such high data rates for mobile use and for what?
Mobile TV? Absolutely mad! Man, was I wrong!
These days we are heading for 14 Mbps via HSDPA, more than 4600 times faster than we
could perform via NMT in 1980. In reality, we are now able to handle higher mobile data
speed to one user than the total data transmission capacity of the whole NMT network in
Denmark could handle then for all the users in the network!
The need for data is endless. Data rates via mobile will increase and increase, and actually
the radio link is getting shorter and shorter. In order to perform these high data rates, we need
a better and better radio link. The radio spectrum is getting more and more loaded, and we
are using higher and higher radiofrequencies and more and more complex and quality-
sensitive modulation schemes; thus the requirement for the quality of the radio link is getting
more and more strict.
It is worthwhile noting that high data rates are not enough on their own. It is also a matter
of services; if mobile users are not motivated by an attractive service, even the highest data
rate is pointless.
The need for high data rates is motivated by user demand for mobile email, internet and
multimedia services. Most UMTS mobile phones are able to support video calling, but it is
rarely used. This shows that, even though it is impressive from a technical viewpoint that it is
possible at all, the technology has no point if the service is not attractive to mobile users. It is
a fact that the most successful mobile data service to date is also the slowest data service in
operation over the mobile network, transmitted via a very slow data channel: SMS (Short
Message Service). SMS is still the most popular data service and still the ‘cash cow’ when it
comes to data services for most mobile networks. Who would have thought that mobile users
of all ages from 8 to 98 would key in long text messages via a 10 digit keyboard on a mobile
phone, when they can pick up the phone and talk? Some users in the network have an SMS
activity beyond 2000 SMSs per week!
When I was introduced to SMS, I thought it might be a good service to announce voice
mails etc. to mobiles, but when the ﬁrst mobiles arrived that were able to transmit SMS, my
thought was ‘why?’ Wrong again! It clearly shows that it is not only a matter of data speed
but also the value of the applications and services offered to the user.
I am happy to note that one thing stays the same: the radio planning of the mobile
networks. The air interfaces and especially the modulation schemes are getting more and
more complex, but in reality there is no difference when seen from a basic radio planning
perspective. The challenges of planning a high-performance HSPA link is the same basic
challenge that Marconi faced performing his ﬁrst radio transmission. It is still a matter of
getting a sufﬁcient margin between the signal and the noise, fulﬁlling the speciﬁc

requirement for the wanted service, from Morse via long waves to 14 Mbps via UMTS/
HSPA. It is still radio planning and a matter of signal-to-noise ratio and quality of the link.
In the old days it was all about getting the radio link transmitted over longer and longer
distances. These days, however, the radio link between the network and the mobile user is
getting shorter and shorter due to the stricter demands on the quality of the radio link in
order to perform the high data rates. Marconi struggled to get his radio transmission to reach
a mile. These days we are struggling to get a service range from an indoor antenna in a
mobile network to service users at 20–40 m distance with high-speed data and good quality
voice service.
We are now moving towards an IP-based world, even on the radio interface, and voice-
over-IP. We are now using IP connection to base stations and all other elements in the
network. The network elements are also moving closer to the mobile users in order to cater
for the requirements for quality of voice and data.
We are now on the brink of a whole new era in the world of telecommunications, an era
where the mobile communication network will be an integrated part of any building. The
telecommunications industry is just about to start integrating small base stations, ‘femto
cells’, in many residential areas in many countries around the world. People expect mobile
coverage and impeccable wireless data service everywhere.
When electricity was invented and became popular, existing buildings had to be post-
installed with wires and light ﬁxtures to support the modern technology of electrical
apparatus and lighting. Later it was realized that electricity probably was so popular that
it was worthwhile pre-installing all the wiring and most of the appliances in buildings from
the construction phase. I do believe that, within a few years from now, it will be the same
with wireless telecommunications. Wireless services in buildings are one of the basic
services that we just expect to work from day one, in our home, in tunnels and surely in
corporate and public buildings.
The future is wireless.

Overview of Cellular Systems
This book is concentrated around the topic of indoor radio planning from a practical
perspective, and it is not the within the scope of this book to cover the full and deep details of
the GSM and UMTS systems and structures. This book will only present the most important
aspects of the network structure, architecture and system components, in order to provide
basic knowledge and information that is needed as a basis for design and implementation of
indoor coverage and capacity solutions. For more details on cellular systems in general refer
to [2].
2.1 Mobile Telephony
2.1.1 Cellular Systems
The concept of cellular coverage was initially developed by AT&T/Bell Laboratories. Prior to
that, the mobile telephony systems were manual systems used only for mobile voice telephony.
Typically implemented with high masts that covered large areas, and with limited capacity per
mast, they were only able to service few users at the same time – in some cases even only one
call per mast! These systems also lacked the ability to hand over calls between masts, so
mobility was limited to the speciﬁc coverage area from the servicing antenna, although in
reality the coverage area was so large that only rarely would you move between coverage
areas. Remember that, at that point, there were no portable mobile telephones, only vehicle-
installed terminals with roof-top antennas. Over time the use of mobile telephony became
increasingly popular and the idea was born that the network needed to be divided into more and
smaller cells, accommodating more capacity for more users, implementing full mobility for the
trafﬁc and enabling the system to hand over trafﬁc between these small cells.
From this initial concept several cellular systems were developed over time and in
different regions of the world. The ﬁrst of these cellular systems was analog voice
transmission, and some ‘data transmission’ modulated into the voice channel for signaling
the occasionally handover or power control command.
Some of the most used standards were/are AMPS, D-AMPS, TACS, PCS, CDMA, NMT,
GSM, DCS and UMTS (WCDMA).

AMPS
AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System) is the North American standard and operates in
the 800 MHz band. The AMPS system was also implemented outside North America in
Asia, Russia and South America. This is an analog system using FM transmission in the
824–849 and 869–894 MHz bands. It has 30 kHz radio channel spacing and a total of 832
radio channels with one user per radio channel.
D-AMPS
D-AMPS (Digital Advanced Mobile Phone System) evolved from AMPS in order to accom-
modate the increasingly popular AMPS network with fast-growing trafﬁc and capacity
constraints. The D-AMPS system used TDMA and thus spectrum efﬁciency could be improved,
and more calls could be serviced in the same spectrum with the same number of base stations.
TACS
TACS (Total Access Cellular System) was also derived from the AMPS technology. The TACS
system was implemented in the 800–900 MHz band. First implemented in the UK, the system
spreadtoothercountriesinEurope,China,Singapore,HongKongandtheMiddleEastandJapan.
PCS
PCS (Personal Communications System) is a general term for several types of systems
developed from the ﬁrst cellular systems.
CDMA
CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) was the ﬁrst digital standard implemented in the
USA. CDMA uses a spread spectrum in the 824–849 and 869–894 MHz bands. There is a
channel spacing of 1.23 MHz, and a total of 10 radio channels with 118 users per channel.
NMT
NMT (Nordic Mobile Telephony) was the standard developed by the Scandinavian
countries, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, in 1981. Initially NMT was launched on
450 MHz, giving good penetration into the large forests of Sweden and Norway, and later
also deployed in the 900 MHz band (the band that today is used for GSM). Being one of the
ﬁrst fully automatic cellular systems in the world (it also had international roaming), the
NMT standard spread to other countries in Europe, Asia and Australia.
GSM
GSM (Global System for Mobile communication) was launched in the early 1990s, and was
one of the ﬁrst truly digital systems for mobile telephony. It was speciﬁed by ETSI and
6
Indoor Radio Planning

originally intended to be used only in the European countries. However GSM proved to be a
very attractive technology for mobile communications and, since the launce in Europe, GSM
has evolved to more or less a global standard.
DCS
Originally GSM was speciﬁed as a 900 MHz system, and since then the same radio structure
and signaling system have been used for DCS1800 (Digital Cellular Telecommunication
System). The GSM basic has also been applied to various spectra around 800–900 and 1800–
1900 MHz across the world, the only difference being the frequencies.
UMTS (WCDMA)
After the big global success with the second generation (2G) GSM and the increased need
for spectrum efﬁciency and data transmission, it was evident that there was a need for a
third-generation mobile system. UMTS was selected as the ﬁrst 3G system for many reasons,
mainly because it is a very efﬁcient way to utilize the radio resources – the RF spectrum.
WCDMA has a very good rejection of narrowband interference, is robust against frequency
selective fading and offers good multipath resistance due to the use of rake receivers. The
handovers in WCDMA are imperceptible due to the use of soft handover, where the mobile
is serviced by more cells at the same time, offering macro-diversity.
However there are challenges when all cells in the network are using the same frequency.
UMTS is all about noise and power control. Strict power control is a necessity to make sure
that transmitted signals are kept to a level that insures they all reach the base station at the
same power level. You need to minimize the inter-cell interference since all cells are
operating on the same frequency; this is a challenge.
Even though soft handovers insure that the mobile can communicate with two or more
cells operating on the same frequency, one must remember that the same call will take up
resources on all the cells the mobile is in soft handover with. The handover zones need to be
minimized to well-deﬁned small areas, or the soft HO can cannibalize the capacity in the
network.
UMTS has now become the global standard and has been accepted throughout the world.
Several upgrades that can accommodate higher data speed HSDPA (High Speed Downlink
Packet Access) and HSUPA (High Speed Uplink Data Access) can service the users with
data speeds in excess of 10 Mbps.
There are several current considerations about converting the current GSM900 spectrum
into UMTS900, giving a much higher spectrum efﬁciency, and better indoor RF penetra-
tion.
2.1.2 Radio Transmission in General
Several challenges need to be addressed when using radio transmission to provide a stable
link between the network and the mobile station. These radio challenges are focused around
the nature of the propagation of radio waves and especially challenges of penetrating the
radio service into buildings where most users are located these days.
Overview of Cellular Systems

The challenges are mainly radio fading, noise control, interference and signal quality.
These challenges will be addressed throughout this book, with guidelines on how to design a
high-performing indoor radio service.
2.1.3 The Cellular Concept
After the initial success with the ﬁrst mobile system, it was evident that more capacity
needed to be added to future mobile telephony systems. In order to implement more capacity
to accommodate more users in the increasingly more popular mobile telephony systems, new
principles needed to be applied. The new concept was to divide the radio access network into
overlapping ‘cells’, and to introduce a handover functionality that could insure full mobility
throughout the network, turning several masts into one coherent service for the users.
Dividing the network into cells has several advantages and challenges. The advantages are:
 Frequency reuse – by planning the radio network with relative low masts with limited
coverage area, compared with the ﬁrst mobile systems, you could design a radio network
where the cells will not interfere with each other. Then it is possible to deploy the same
radio channel in several cells throughout the network, and at the same time increase the
spectrum and radio network efﬁciency thanks to frequency reuse.
 Capacity growth – the cellular network could start with only a few cells, and as the need
for better coverage and more capacity grew, these large cells could be split into smaller
cells, increasing the radio network capacity even more with tighter reuse of the
frequencies (as shown in Figure 2.1).
 Mobility – it is paramount for cellular networks that handovers are possible between the
cells, so the users can roam through the network with ongoing connections and no dropped
calls. With the advent of the ﬁrst cellular systems, mobile users could now move around
the network, utilizing all the cells as one big service area.
Figure 2.1

network evolves, and the capacity need grows
8
Indoor Radio Planning

The challenges are:
 Network structure – when deploying the cellular structure one needs to design a
theoretical hexagonal roll-out, by deploying omni, three-sector or six-sector base stations,
and make sure the cells only cover the intended area. It is important that the cells only
cover the intended area, and that there are no ‘spill’ of radio coverage to the coverage area
of other cells in the network.
 Mobility – to offer full mobility in a cellular network you need to introduce handover
among the cells, in order for the call to proceed uninterrupted when a mobile moves from
one cell service area to a new one. The handover function creates a need to evaluate the
radio quality of a potential new, better cell, compared with the current cell servicing the
call. Complex measurements and evaluation procedures of adjacent cells are introduced in
order to control the handover decision and mobility management.
 Power control – to service the mobile user with coherent radio coverage throughout the
network area is a challenge. On the uplink from the mobile to the base station, one of the
challenges is for the mobile to reach the base station. However, it is also a challenge that
sometimes the mobiles can be close to the serving base station, and at the same time, the
same base station using the same radio channel might also serve a mobile at 20 km
distance. This can cause a problem known as ‘the near–far problem’, i.e. the mobile close
to the base station will generate a high-level signal in the base station receiver and will
simply overpower the low signal from the distant mobile. To overcome this issue, power
control of both the downlink (the signal transmitted from the base station to the mobile)
and the uplink (the signal transmitted by the mobile to the base station) was introduced.
This not only avoids overpowering the receiving end, but also limits the overall
interference in the network due to the lower average transmitted power level on both
uplink and downlink. It also increases radio quality and spectrum efﬁciency by tighter
frequency reuse among the cells. The challenge with power control is the need to evaluate
both the signal strength and the quality of the radio signal received in both ends of the link,
in order to adjust the transmitted power to an appropriate level, and ﬁrst and foremost to
make sure that the link is not overpowered.
2.1.4 Digital Cellular Systems
From only performing pure voice connections on the mobile networks around the world,
users slowly started to request the possibility of sending and receiving data signals via the
mobile connection. The ﬁrst applications mobile data were the use of analog modems to
transmit and receive fax signals over a purely analog mobile connection. Soon it became
clear that there was a need for real data transmission via the mobile network.
In order to accommodate the need for mobile data transmission, better voice quality and
spectrum efﬁciency digital technology were applied to the cellular systems. Many competing
2G (second generation) systems were developed, but on a global basis the most successful
has been the GSM system
By using digital transmission several advantages were achieved:
 Better spectrum efﬁciency.
 Lower infrastructure cost on the network side.

 Reducing fraud, by encryption of data and services.
 Lower terminal cost.
 Reduced transmission of power from the mobile, making it possible to have long-lasting
batteries for hand-held terminals.
This book mainly focuses on indoor radio planning for 2G (GSM/DCS) and 3G (UMTS)
systems. A more thorough introduction to the principles of GSM/UMTS and HSPA is
appropriate and is to be found in the following sections.
2.2 Introduction to GSM
To perform indoor GSM radio planning, the radio planner needs some basic information
about the network, signaling, etc. This section is not intended as a complete GSM training
session, but rather to highlight the general parameters and network functions in GSM
networks. For more details on the GSM please refer to [1].
2.2.1 GSM
GSM was launched in the early 1990s, as one of the ﬁrst truly digital systems for mobile
telephony. It was speciﬁed by ETSI and originally intended to be used only in Europe.
However, GSM proved to be a very attractive technology for mobile communications, and
since the launch in Europe, GSM has evolved to be more or less the ﬁrst truly global
standard for mobile communication. Even though GSM is relatively old (most mobile
network generations last about 7–10 years), it is still being rolled out all over the world, and
in particular, the focus on high indoor usage of mobile telephony has motivated a need for
dedicated indoor coverage solutions.
DCS
GSM was originally speciﬁed as a 900 MHz system. Since then the same radio structure and
signaling have been used for DCS1800. The GSM basic has also been applied to various
spectra around 800–900 and 1800–1900 MHz across the world, the only difference being the
frequencies.
Security Features
All GSM communication is data; essentially voice is converted from analog to data and back
again. Compared with the analog mobile telephony, the GSM system is much more secure
and is impossible to intercept. GSM applies digital encryption, authentication of call,
checking and validation of calls in order to prevent unauthorized use of the network. For the
ﬁrst time in mobile telephony systems, the identiﬁcation of the user in the system was not
tied to the mobile equipment with an internal telephony number (often an EPROM you had
to replace), but to the user by the use of a SIM card (Subscriber Identity Module). The SIM
is identiﬁed using an IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) – yes, International –
for the ﬁrst time the mobile user could roam in other countries or networks on a global basis
and use their mobiles and supplementary services as if they were in the own home network.

2.2.2 GSM Radio Features
Compared with the analog networks at the time, such as NMT and AMPS, new and
sophisticated radio network features were introduced in GSM. One new feature was DTx
(discontinuous transmission), which enabled the base station/mobile to only transmit when
there was voice activity. This prolongs the battery life of the mobile station, but also
minimizes both uplink and downlink interference due to the lower average power level. DTx
detects the voice activity on the line, and during the period of no voice activity the radio
transmission stops. In order to prevent the users from hanging up when there is complete
silence on the link, believing the line to be dead, the system generates ‘comfort noise’ to
emulate the natural background noise of the individual call.
The GSM system can also use frequency hopping, accommodating channel selective
fading by shifting between radio frequencies from a predeﬁned list 217 times per second.
This hopping is controlled by an individual hopping sequence for each cell.
GSM Data Service
Analog networks at the time were only able to transmit data via analog modems, and only up
to a maximum data speed of about 300 baud (0.3 kbps). The possibility of higher data rates
on mobile networks with the advent of GSM phase one, enabling data transfer up to
9.6 kbps, was stunning. Today this seems really slow, but at the time most of us were not sure
how we should ever be able to utilize this mobile ‘broadband’ to its full potential –
remember, this was before Windows 1.0 was even launched! You were lucky if you could do
300 baud over your ﬁxed telephone line. Over time new more sophisticated packet data
transmission modulations have been applied to GSM, GPRS and EDGE, now exceeding
200–300 kbps per data call.
During the speciﬁcation of the signaling of GSM, it became clear that there was a slight
overhead in the data resources, and that this overhead could be used to transmit short
portions of limited data – this eventually resulted in a new data service being introduced. The
data service that was originally speciﬁed and launched as a paging service was SMS. SMS
was originally planned to be used by the network to announce voice mails, cell information
and other text broadcast services to individuals or all mobiles within an area of the network.
The ﬁrst GSM mobiles were not even able to transmit SMS; no one was expecting mobile
users to struggle with using the small 10-digit keyboard to key in a text message. The
concept was that you could dial up a speciﬁc support number with a manned message center
that could key in a text direct into the network, and charge accordingly for this service. Well,
we all know today that, even though SMS has many limitations, the fact remains that this is
still the most successful mobile data service and a huge revenue generator for the mobile
operators.
Supplementary Services in GSM
With GSM several new services were introduced, such as call forwarding, call waiting,
conference calls and voice mails. All this today seems only natural, but it was a major leap
for mobile communications. It added new value for mobile users and the network operators,
making mobile communication a tool you could ﬁnally use as the primary communication

platform for professional business use, and a real alternative to ﬁxed line telephone
networks, especially if you had good indoor coverage inside your building.

a direct result of a good standardizing work by an ETSI/GSM Mou (Memorandum of under-
standing).ItenabledtheGSMstandardtospreadrapidlyacrosstherestoftheworld,becomingthe
ﬁrst truly global standard – even though some countries never implemented the standard.
The GSM Radio Access Structure
The most important part of the GSM network for the indoor radio planner is the GSM radio
structure and air interface. In the following the main parameters and techniques are introduced.
Idle Mode
A mobile is considered in idle mode when it is not engaged in trafﬁc (transmitting). The
mobile will camp on the strongest cell, monitor system information and detect and decode
the paging channel in order to respond to an incoming call.
Dedicated Mode
Mobiles engaged in a call/transmitting data to the network are considered to be in dedicated
mode. In dedicated mode a bi-directional connection is established between the mobile
station and the network. The mobile will also measure neighboring cells and report this
measurement information to the network for handover and mobility management purposes.
FDD + TDD
GSM uses separate frequency bands for the uplink and downlink connection (as shown in
Figure 2.2). The two bands are separated by 45 MHz on GSM900, and by 95 MHz on
GSM1800. GSM has the mobile transmit band in the lower frequency segment.
By the use of FDD (Frequency Division Duplex), the spectrum is divided into radio
channels, each radio channel having 200 kHz bandwidth. Each of these 200 kHz radio
channels is then divided in time using TDD (Time Division Duplex) into eight channels
(time slots) to be used as logical and trafﬁc channels for the users.
GSM is most commonly assigned to use on the 900 and 1800 MHz frequency bands (as
shown in Figure 2.3). However depending on local spectrum assignment in different regions,
other band segments are used, such as EGSM or GSM1900.
The GSM Spectrum
The GSM radio spectrum is divided into 200 kHz radio channels. The standard spectrum on
GSM900 is 890–915 MHz for the uplink and 935–960 MHz for the downlink spectrum
(CH1–CH124), a total of 2  35 MHz paired spectra, separated by 45 MHz duplex distance.
The DCS spectrum (as shown in Figure 2.4) uses 1710–1785 MHz for the uplink and

spectra separated by 95 MHz duplex distance.
In some regions other spectrum allocations for GSM around 900 and 1800 MHz have been
implemented, such as EGSM or DCS1900.
TDMA
In addition to the frequency separation, GSM uses time separation, TDMA (Time Divided
Multiple Access); TDMA allowsmultipleuserstooccupythesameradiochannel.Theuserswill
be offset in time, but still use the same 200 kHz radio channel. The radio spectrum (as shown in
Figure 2.3) in GSM (900) is separated into 124 radio channels, each of these radio channels then
separated into eight time-divided channels called time slots (TSL) (as shown in Figure 2.5).
Each TDMA frame time slot consist of 156.25 bits (as shown in Figure 2.6, 33.9 kbs per
TSL or 270.8 kbps per frame), of which 114 (2  57) are coded data, including forward error

correction. All transmitted information is transferred in blocks of 456 bits, divided into four
time slot periods (456 ¼ 4  2  57). The maximum net bit rate is per time slot is 13 kbps,
excluding the error correction.
The GSM Cell Structure
As we know, the GSM network consists of cells (as shown in Figure 2.7), the cells operate on
different frequencies and each is identiﬁed by the CI (Cell Identity deﬁned in the parameter
settings in the network) and the BSIC (Base Station Identity Code). Depending on the
geography and the design of the network, the frequencies can be reused by several cells,
provided that the cells do not ‘spill’ coverage into other cells’ coverage areas.
Capacity upgrade for a cell is done by deploying more radio channels in the cell; an
upgrade of a cell with one extra radio channel will give eight extra logical channels that can
be used for signaling or trafﬁc. In urban areas it is normal to have six to 12 radio channels
per cell. In a macro network the typical conﬁguration is to design with three sector sites (as
shown in Figure 2.7), where each mast is serving three individual cells.
Most GSM networks were initially deployed as GSM900, but in many countries DCS1800
has been implemented at a later stage, as an extra ‘layer’ on top of the GSM900 network to

add capacity to the network to fulﬁll the fast growing need for more trafﬁc channels and
spectrum.
In most cases (not all), the DCS1800 network has a shorter service range due to the higher
free space loss caused by the higher frequency (6 dB). If DCS 1800 is added onto the
existing GSM900 network, using the initial mast separation designed for GSM900 might
cause the 1800 cells not to overlap adjacent DCS1800 cells; therefore all handovers of trafﬁc
between cells have to be done via the GSM900 cells. This puts signiﬁcant signaling load on
GSM900 and increases the risk of dropped calls during a more complex handover. Therefore
it is preferred to decrease the inter-site distance between the masts, then the network has
coherent and homogeneous coverage on DCS1800. In practice DCS1800 has mostly been
implemented to add capacity in urban environments, where the inter-site distance is short
even on GSM900 and will provide a good foundation for DCS1800 deployment. In a dual-
layer GSM network (900 þ 1800) ‘Common BCCH’ (broadcast control channel) is often
used to combine all signaling into one layer and free up more TSLs in the cell for more user
capacity.
2.2.3 Mobility Management in GSM
Managing the service quality and mobility of the users in a cellular network like GSM
is important. The network must insure the best possible service quality and hand over
the mobiles between cells when the users roam through the network. Complex
measurements for radio strength and quality have been applied to cater for the mobility
management.
Radio Measurements
In dedicated mode (during a call) the base station measures the signal level and radio quality/
BER (bit error rate) of the received signal from the mobile. The mobile will also measure the
signal level and the quality of the serving cell, as well as the signal levels of the neighboring
cells deﬁned by the network in the ‘neighbor list’. The mobile reports these measurements
(measurement reports) to the network for quality evaluation, power control and handover
evaluation.
Rx-Quality
The radio quality (bit error rate) of both the uplink and downlink connection is divided into
eight levels and deﬁned as ‘Rx-Qual’ 0–7, 0 being the best quality. Rx-Qual 7 will start a
network timer that will terminate the call if the quality does not improve within a preset
time. If the Rx-Qual rises above 4 it will degrade the voice quality of a speech call to an
extent that is noticeable to the user. An Rx-Qual better than 3 must be striven for when
planning indoor solutions; preferably, an Rx-Qual of 0 should be insured throughout the
building.
The main cause of degradation of the Rx-Qual is interference from cells using the same
radio frequency, or by too low a reception level of the servicing signal.
16
Indoor Radio Planning

Rx-Level
The radio signal strength is measured as Rx-Level and is reported in a range from 0 to 64. The
Rx-Level is the signal level over 110 dBm. Rx-Level 30 is: 110 þ 30 dB ¼ 80 dBm.
The mobile will also measure the radio quality and signal strength of the serving cell, as
well as the other adjacent cells (speciﬁed by the neighbor list received from the base station
controller, BSC). The mobile measures and decodes the BSIC (base station identity code)
and reports the strongest cells back to the BSC for handover evaluation/execution.
Radio Signal Quality Control
Based on the radio measurements evaluation performed by the BSC and the mobile, the
network (the BSC) will control and adjust the various radio parameters, power level, timing
and frequency hopping, etc., in order to insure the preset margin for radio signal level and
radio quality is maintained
A neighbor list is deﬁned in the network and broadcast to the mobile in service under each
cell, with the frequencies and details of the adjacent cells to the serving cell. This list of
frequencies (the BCCH of adjacent cells) is used by the mobile to measure the adjacent cells.
These measurements are used for the handover evaluation. Normally this is a ‘two-way’ list,
enabling the mobile to handover in both directions, but it is possible to deﬁne ‘one-way’
neighbors, removing the possibility of the mobile handing back to the previous serving cell.
This use of ‘one-way’ neighbors can be useful for optimizing indoor systems, especially in
high-rise buildings, in order to make sure that the mobiles inside a building that camp
unintentionally on an outdoor cell can hand in to the indoor system, but not hand back to the
outdoor network; see Section 5.5 for more details.
Power Control
The network will adjust the transmit power from the mobile and the base station; the
downlink power control for the base station is optional. The primary function of the power
control is insure that the radio link can fulﬁll the preset quality parameters, and most
importantly to make sure that mobiles close to the base station will not overpower the uplink
and desensitize the base station, resulting in degraded service or dropped calls.
Adjustable target levels for minimum and maximum Rx-Level are set in the network,
individually for each cell. These Rx-Levels are the reference for the power control function,
and will adjust the transmit power to fulﬁll the requirements and keep the Rx-Levels within
the preset window. Separate triggers for Rx-Qual can cause the power to be adjusted up, even
if the Rx-Level is already fulﬁlled in order to overcome interference problems.
The power control in GSM is done in steps of 2 dB, and the power steps can be adjusted in
intervals of 60 ms.
GSM Handovers
Based on the measurement reports sent from the mobile to the network, with information
on the radio signal level of serving and adjacent cells, if the preset levels for triggering
Overview of Cellular Systems
17

the handover are fulﬁlled, the network might evaluate that the mobile could be served by
a new cell with better radio signal level and command the mobile to hand over to a new
serving cell. The handover requires the establishment of a new serving trafﬁc channel on
the new cell and, if the handover is successful, the release of the old serving trafﬁc
channel. Normally the handover is not noticeable for the user, but there will be ‘bit
stealing’ from the voice channel to provide fast signaling for the handover. This ‘bit
stealing’ can be detected as small gaps in the voice channel, and if indoor users are
located in an area where there is constantly handover between two cells (‘ping pong
handover’), the voice quality on the link will be perceived as degraded by the user, even if
the Rx-Qual remains 0.
The handover trigger levels and values can be adjusted in the network individually for
each handover relation between the cells. Various averaging windows, offsets, can also be
set. For planning and optimizing indoor systems it is very important that the radio planner
knows the basics of the parameter set for the speciﬁc type of base station network
implemented. This will enable the radio planner to optimize the implemented indoor
solutions to maximum performance, and compatibility with the adjacent macro network.
The handover in GSM can be triggered by:
 Signal level uplink or downlink, to maintain quality.
 Signal quality uplink or downlink, to maintain quality.
 Distance, to limit the cell range.
 Speed of mobiles.
 Trafﬁc, to distribute load among cells.
 Maintenance – you can empty a cell by network command.
Intracell Handover
If the Rx-Qual is bad but no adjacent cells with higher received signal level are detected and
reported by the mobile, the network may initiate an intracell handover, assigning a new TSL
or a new radio channel on the same cell. This can improve the quality of the call if
interference hits the used time slot or frequency.
Level-triggered Handover
Preset margins for Rx-Level can be set to trigger a handover level. Standard settings will
be so that when an adjacent cell measured in the neighbor list becomes 3–6 dB more
powerful, the mobile is handed over to the new cell. However, handover margins can
actually be set to negative levels, triggering the handover even if the adjacent cell is less
powerful.
Quality-triggered Handover
To insure that the Rx-Qual of the radio link is maintained, preset trigger levels for Rx-Qual
can be set to ‘overwrite’ the level handover, initiating a handover if the Rx-Qual degrades
below the trigger level. The typical trigger level for the Rx-Quality handover is Rx-Qual > 3.
If the quality degrades beyond this level, the network will initiate a handover. It does not
matter if the Rx-Level margin is fulﬁlled or not.
18
Indoor Radio Planning

Distance-triggered Handover
The maximum cell size can be set, and handovers triggered when exceeding this distance.
This can be useful for indoor cells, making sure that the indoor cell will not service
unintended trafﬁc outside the building, but remember to take into account the delay of the
DAS, this will offset the cell size.
Speed-triggered Handover
It is also be possible for the network to detect if the mobile is moving fast or slow through
the serving cell. This can be utilized by the network by limiting certain cells to serve only
slow-moving (hand-held) mobiles. This can be very useful when optimizing indoor GSM
systems, in order to avoid vehicular trafﬁc camping on the indoor cell if the indoor cell leaks
out signal to a nearby road.
Trafﬁc-triggered Handover
It is possible to predeﬁne a certain trafﬁc level for a cell to start handing over calls to
adjacent cells, and thereby ofﬂoad the cell. This can be very useful for cells that have
periodic hot-spot trafﬁc, and might save the expense of deploying extra capacity for
servicing only the occasionally peak load. However this is only possible if the adjacent
cells are able to service the trafﬁc at the expected quality level.
Maintenance Handover
It is also possible to order the network to empty a speciﬁc cell. Similar to the trafﬁc-
triggered handover, the cell will push all calls that can be handled by adjacent cells out and
wait for the remaining calls to terminate. During this mode the cell will not set up any new
calls, and once the cell is empty, the cell can be switched off for service and maintenance.
By emptying an operational cell using this method, there will only be limited impact on the
users in terms of perceived network quality. This method is to be preferred when doing
maintenance in the network rather than just switching off the cell and dropping all the
ongoing calls.
The Complexity of the GSM Handovers
In GSM there are basically three handovers seen from the network side (as shown in
Figure 2.8), involving several networks depending on the handover type.
Intra-BSC Handovers
Intra-BSC handovers are between cells serviced by the same BSC. This is the least complex
handover seen from the network side. Also, there are possibilities for using functions that
make the handover smoother and more likely to succeed – pre-sync (chained cells), etc.
These functions can be very useful in tricky handover situations, optimizing the handover
zone in tunnel systems, for example.
Overview of Cellular Systems
19

Inter-BSC Handovers
Inter-BSC handovers are done between cells serviced by different BSCs. The handover
function is basically the same as for intra-BSC handovers, but with limited functions like
pre-sync, etc.
Inter-MSC Handover
Inter-MSC handovers are controlled by the MSC, and the signaling is more complex due to
the implication on several interfaces and network elements. The number of inter-MSC
handovers should be limited in high trafﬁc areas (indoors).
Location Management in GSM
The GSM radio network is divided into regions (location areas).The most important
motivation for dividing the radio network into several location areas is to limit the paging
load. The mobile will monitor and update the network whenever it detects that it is being
serviced by a new location area. This is done by the mobile by monitoring the location area
code (LAC) broadcast from all the cells in the system information. In the VLR (visitor
location register) in the network, the information about the LAC area the mobile was last
updated in is stored. Using several location areas, the network can limit the signalling of
paging messages by only having to broadcast the paging messages to the mobiles currently
serviced by a speciﬁc LAC. If the concept of location areas was not implemented, the
network would have had to page all mobiles in all cells each time there was an incoming
call. This would have severely loaded the paging signalling resources and increased paging
response time beyond an acceptable level.
Timing Advance
All the active trafﬁc in a GSM cell is synchronized to the timing and clock of the base
station, in order to insure that the time slots are sent and received at the correct time. The

TDMA frame is 4.615 ms long, and each TSL is 577 ms. Radio waves travel with the speed
of light, about 300 000 km/s. Analyzing the example in Figure 2.9 with two mobiles in
trafﬁc, one is close to the base station (MS1) and the other (MS2) is 20 km distant. Owing to
the propagation delay caused by the difference in distance to the serving base station, the
mobiles will be offset in time by about 66 ms (one-way). Both mobiles are locked to the same
serving base station’s synchronization ‘clock’. Actually the distant mobile will in this case
be offset by 2  66 ms as the signal has to travel from the base station, to the mobile and
back so the synchronization of the distant mobile is offset/delayed in time by about 132 ms.
This delay corresponds to about 0.3 TSL, and will cause the transmitted TSL (TSL4) from
the distant mobile to overlap with the next TSL (TSL5 in this example), used by the mobile
closest to the base station (as shown in Figures 2.9 and 2.10).
To overcome this problem, one could consider including more guard time between the
time slots, but this would come at the expense of lower spectrum efﬁciency. In order to

preserve spectrum efﬁciency, the problem was solved using the concept of timing advance
(TA). In practice the problem is solved in GSM by having the base station continuously
measure the time offset between its own burst schedule and the timing of the received
bursts from the mobiles. When the base station detects that the TSL from the mobile has
started to drift close to the next or previous TSL, the base station will command a TA
step-up or -down. The network simply commands the mobile to send the TSL sooner, and
the offset will depend on the distance between the mobile and the serving mast. This
timing advance enables the GSM system to compensate for the delay over the air
interface.
The use of timing advance insures high spectrum efﬁciency (low guard times between
time slots) and at the same time solves the issue of the timing difference between distant
mobiles and mobiles near the base station.
The solution to this problem shown in Figures 2.9 and 2.10 is for the network to command
the mobile MS2 to use TA36, causing the mobile to transmit early. In this example, it insures
that the transmitted TSL4 from mobile station 2 will not overlap with TSL5 from mobile
station 1.
The GSM system is able to handle timing offset up to 233 ms, corresponding to a
maximum distance from the base station of 35 km. It has divided this timing offset into
64 timing advance steps, TA0–TA63, with a resolution of 550 m per TA step. However,
since the initial GSM phase one speciﬁcation, several manufacturers are now able to
support ‘extended cells’, thereby supporting trafﬁc up to 70 km and in some cases even
further.
TA and Indoor Systems
When designing indoor-distributed antenna systems, you need to keep in mind that all
the antenna distribution equipment, passive and active, will delay the signal timing,
and offset the TA. Even in a passive cable, the propagation speed and velocity are about
80% of the free space speed of light of 300 000 km/h. Active systems, ampliﬁers, optical
cables etc. might offset the TA by ﬁve to eight steps, depending on the equipment, cable
distances, etc.
When setting the maximum cell service range, it is very important to remember to
compensate for this timing offset, introduced by the indoor antenna system. One must not
be tempted to set the maximum TA to one or two per default for indoor systems, as the
indoor cell might not pick up any trafﬁc at all. The correct TA setting for the maximum
service distance can easily be evaluated on-site by the user of a special test mobile station,
where the TA step can be decoded in the display of the mobile, and the maximum cell
service range adjusted accordingly.
2.2.4 GSM Signaling
This section will present an overview of the channel types, and basic signaling and
mobility management in GSM. Not in a detailed level, but just to introduce the
principles.
22
Indoor Radio Planning

Logical Channels
Each TDMA frame consists of eight TSL, TSL0–7, which can be used for several types of
channels. Trafﬁc and control channels sometimes even combine channels. Several trafﬁc
time slots can be assigned to the same user for higher data rates.
Trafﬁc Channels (TCH)
The TCH is the channel that contains all the user data for speech or data. The TCH can be a
full-rate channel, or an enhanced full-rate channel with up to 13 kbs user data or good voice
quality. It is also possible to divide one 13 kbps TCH into two 6.5 kbps channels, thus
doubling the number of channels in the same TDMA frame. One TDMA frame can carry
eight full-rate TCHs or voice calls, or 16 calls of 6.5 kbps channels; for voice this is referred
to as ‘half-rate’ and will to some extent degrade the voice quality, although in normal
circumstances it is barely noticeable for the voice user.
By the use of half-rate, the GSM network can double the voice capacity, using the same
number of radio channels. The half-rate codex can be permanently enabled in the cell, or most
commonly the half-rate service will automatic be activated when the trafﬁc on the cell rises
close to full load. The mechanics of the half-rate is, for example: if a cell has six ongoing calls,
the network starts to convert these calls into half-rate trafﬁc rearranging the users from the
13 kbps full rate channel to two new 6.5 kbp half-rate channels. Now, instead of taking up six
TSLs, they will only use three TSLs, thus freeing capacity on the cell for new trafﬁc.
This function for automatic allocation of half-rate channels is referred to as ‘dynamic half-
rate’ and the trigger level for the capacity load needed to start the conversion can be adjusted
in the network.
When using half-rate trafﬁc channels; one radio channel can carry up to 16 voice calls.
This is a very cost-effective tool for providing high peak load capacity, for big sport arenas,
exhibition venues, etc. However it is not recommended to use permanent half-rate for high
proﬁle indoor solutions, where users expect perfect voice quality.
Control Channels
In order to handle all the signaling for the mobility management, trafﬁc control, etc., several
control channels are needed. Remember these are logical channels and might not be active
constantly(mostarenot),butwillbecombinedintousingthesameTSLasothercontrolchannels.
CCCH (Common Control Channels) and DCCH (Dedicated Control Channels)
One set of CCCH (BCCH þ PCH þ AGCH for downlink and RACH for uplink) are mapped
either alone or together with four SDDCH logical channels into one physical TDMA time
slot. The dedicated control channels, SDDCH, SACCH and FACCH, are not mapped
together with other control channels. These will have a dedicated TSL or ‘steal’ some
trafﬁc TSL for a period of time when needed.
BCCH
The broadcast control channel (BCCH) is a downlink-only channel, transmitted from the
base station to the mobile station. The BCCH broadcasts a lot of different information for
Overview of Cellular Systems
23

mobiles: system information, cell identity, location area, radio channel allocations, etc. The
BCCH is assigned using TSL0 of the ﬁrst radio channel in the cell.
PCH
The paging channel (PCH) is a downlink-only channel, broadcasting all the paging signals to
all mobiles currently registered in the location area (LAC). When detecting a page for the
actual mobile (IMSI), the mobile will respond via the RACH. Mobiles in the same LAC will
be divided into paging groups. The paging group is based on the IMSI (telephone number),
so the mobile knows when to listen for speciﬁc paging signals belonging to its speciﬁc
paging group. This enables the mobile to only use resources for paging reception in the short
time when its own paging group is active. The mobile can then ‘sleep’ during the period
when the other paging groups are broadcast, thus saving power and extending battery life.
This is referred to as a DRX, discontinuous reception.
RACH
The random access channel (RACH) is used when a mobile needs to access the network. It
transmits on the RACH as an uplink-only channel. The mobile will perform random access
when attaching to the network, when it is switched on, when responding to paging, when
setting up a call and when location updating from one LAC to another.
AGCH
The access grant channel (AGCH) is a downlink-only channel that is used by the base
station to transmit the access grant signal to a mobile trying to access the network on the
RACH.
SDDCH
The stand-alone dedicated control channel (SDDCH) is used for authentication, roaming,
encryption activation and general call control. The SDCCHs are grouped into four
(SDDCH/4) or eight (SDCCH/8), together with one set of CCCHs and mapped into one
time slot.
SACCH
The slow associated control channel (SACCH) is linked with a speciﬁc TCH or SDCCH for
radio signal control and measurements. One block of SACCH (456 bits) contains one
measurement report, sent every 480 ms, reported to the BSC via the base station. The
SACCH will use a part of the TCH or SDCCH for the SACCH.
FACCH
The fast associated control channel (FACCH) is for immediate signaling associated with
handover commands for the speciﬁc call. The FACCH will be transmitted using the TCH, by
means of ‘bit-stealing’ of the TCH (the small gaps in the voice stream that are noticeable
during a GSM handover).

GSM Signaling Procedures
Without going into speciﬁc details, we will take a quick look at what type of signaling
procedures are used in GSM in order to handle mobility and the overall function of the
mobile network, such as:
 Location management.
 Paging.
 Accessing the network.
 Authentication and encryption.
 Radio signal quality control.
 Radio measurements.
 Handover.
Location Updating and Roaming
The network is divided into sub-areas called location areas, identiﬁed by a speciﬁc location
area code (LAC). When a mobile detects a new LAC broadcast by the base station, it will
access the network and perform a location update, so the network (the VLR) is aware which
location area is currently servicing the mobile, and to which location area to send any paging
signal for the speciﬁc mobile.
Paging
The mobile is not permanently connected to the network. In idle mode the mobile will
monitor the PCH in the serving cell. In the case of an incoming call the mobile will respond
with a paging response, after connecting to the network via the RACH.
Network Access
Every time the mobile needs to connect to the network for a location update, paging
response, call set-up, SMS, data trafﬁc, etc., the mobile has to request a dedicated channel
via the RACH.
Authentication and Encryption
When performing a call set-up, the network will verify the identity of the mobile and provide
a speciﬁc encryption key for the trafﬁc. The network will encrypt the speciﬁc call, using a
speciﬁc key known only to the mobile (SIM) and the network.
2.2.5 GSM Network Architecture
This section presents a short introduction to the elements of the GSM network, in a simpliﬁed
example (as shown in Figure 2.11). This is not a detailed description of all network elements,
Overview of Cellular Systems
25

but merely an introduction to the general principle of how the GSM network elements are
interconnected and their primary function.
MS
The mobile station (MS) is the user terminal, telephone, data card, etc. The MS is connected
to the network (BTS) via the radio interface, the Um interface.
Um, the Radio Interface
The Um is the GSM air interface, the radio channel structure of 200 kHz channels and the
TDMA multiplexing presented on the previous pages, combining FDD and TDD. It
normally uses the 900 or 1800–1900 MHz spectrum.
Base Transceiver Station
The base transceiver station (BTS) contains all the radio transmitters and receivers that
service a speciﬁc area (cell). In macronetworks a BTS will typically service three sectors
(cells). Each cell can have several radio channels on air in the same cell, serviced by
individual transceivers (transmitter/receiver, TRX, TRU, etc.) A standard outdoor base
station will use one transmit antenna and two receive antennas (receiver diversity) for each
cell. The extra receiver antenna improves the uplink signal from the MS. Mostly, one
antenna is used for transmit/receive and one for receiver diversity.
Base Station Controller
The BSC controls large groups of BTSs over a large area. The BSC will perform the power
control, etc., of the base stations within its service area. The BSC will also be in charge of
handovers and handover parameters, making sure to establish the new connection in the new
serving cell, and to close the previously used connection. One BSC and all the BTSs
Figure 2.11
The network elements of the GSM network (simpliﬁed)

Indoor Radio Planning

connected are often referred to as a BSS (base sub system). The BSC interfaces to the BTS
using the A-bis interface.
Mobile Switching Center
The mobile switching center (MSC) services a number of BSS areas, via the A-interface
from the MSC to the connected BSCs. The MSC is in control of all the calls within the BSSs
connected, and is responsible for all call switching in the whole area, even two calls under
the same cell in the same BTS. All calls are sent back and switched centrally by the MSC.
The MSC is also responsible for the supplementary services, call forwarding and charging.
To support the MSC with the switching and services, it is connected to supporting network
elements; VLR, HLR, EIR and AUC are connected.
Home Location Register
The home location register (HLR) is a large database that contains information about the
service proﬁle and current location (VLR address) of the subscribers (SIMs) belonging to the
network registered on the particular HLR.
Visitor Location Register
The visitor location register (VLR) is, like the HLR, a database; it contains information
about all the mobiles (SIMs) currently camped on the network serviced by the MSC. In
the VLR we will ﬁnd a copy of all the HLR information with regards to the service
proﬁle of the user, and information about the current location (location area LAC) of the
mobile.
Authentication Register
The authentication register (AUC) contains the individual subscriber identiﬁcation key (this
unique key is also on the SIM) and supports the HLR and VLR with this information, which
is used for authentication and call encryption.
Equipment Identity Register
The equipment identity register (EIR) is a database that stores information about mobile
station hardware in use. If a mobile is stolen the speciﬁc hardware identity (IMEI,
International Mobile Equipment Identity) can be blacklisted in the EIR, baring calls to or
from the mobile.
Public Service Telephone Network
The public service telephone network (PSTN) is the outside network. It could be the ﬁxed
network a in this example, or another MSC or mobile network.

2.3 Universal Telecommunication System
This chapter is a short introduction to the universal telecommunication system (UMTS). For
more details please refer to References [3] and [4].
UMTS (WCDMA) was speciﬁed and selected for 3G system for many reasons, one of the
main ones being that it is a very efﬁcient way to utilize the radio resources – the radio
spectrum. WCDMA has a very high rejection of narrowband interference, and is very robust
against frequency-selective fading. It offers good multipath resistance due to the use of rake
receivers. The handovers in WCDMA are smooth and imperceptible due to the use of soft
handovers. During handover the mobile is serviced by more cells at the same time, offering
macro diversity gain.
However, there are challenges to UMTS radio planning, when all cells in the network are
using the same frequency. UMTS radio planning is all about noise and power control. Very
strict power control is necessary to make sure that all transmitted signals are kept to a target
level that insures that all mobiles reach the base station at the exact same power level. Very
good radio planning discipline must be applied and cells must only cover the intended area,
and not spill into unintended areas. The reason for this is that you need to minimize the inter-
cell interference since all cells are operating on the same frequency; this is one of the biggest
radio planning challenges when designing UMTS radio systems.
Even though the concept of soft handovers insures that the mobile can communicate with
two or more cells operating on the same frequency, you must remember that the same call
will take up resources on all the cells the mobile is in soft handover with, including the
backhaul resources of other network elements. Therefore you must try to minimize the
handover zones to well-deﬁned small areas, or the soft HO can cannibalize the capacity in
the network. This is a particular concern when the two or three cells that are supporting the
soft handover are serviced by separate base stations, and different RNCs (radio network
controllers) – this will cause added load to the backhaul transmission interfaces.
GSM/DCS and UMTS
UMTS is often added on to existing 2G networks, so in the UMTS speciﬁcation it has been
insured that handovers (hard handover) can be done between 2G and 3G and vice versa.
2.3.1 The Most Important UMTS Radio Design Parameters
UMTS is a very complex mobile system, even if you ‘only’ need to focus on the radio
planning aspects. It can be a challenge to understand the all the deep aspects regarding
UMTS radio planning. Many parameters and concerns are important but the most important
parameter the RF designer must remember when designing UMTS indoor solutions is that:
 UMTS is power-limited on the downlink (DL).
 UMTS is noise-limited on the uplink (UL).
The RF designer should always strive to design a solution that can secure the most power
resources per user, and the least noise load on the UL of the serving cell and other cells in the
network.
28
Indoor Radio Planning

Remember that all cells in UMTS are on the same frequency; therefore the coverage and
noise from one cell will affect the performance on other cells in the network. Do not apply
‘GSM planning’ tactics to UMTS planning, especially not to indoor UMTS radio planning.
When planning GSM you can to some extent just ‘blast’ power from the outside network
into a building to provide coverage. In GSM you will also often use few, high-power
(exceeding þ20 dBm) indoor antennas to dominate the building. What saves you on GSM is
the frequency separation; you can assign separate radio channels to the different cells. This is
not possible on UMTS. You might be tempted to use a separate UMTS carrier for indoor
solutions and by that separate the indoor from the outdoor network, but that is ‘GSM
thinking’ and is a very expensive decision; after all, the networks have typical only two or
three UMTS carriers as the total resources for current and future services. The only solution
is good indoor radio planning, controlling the noise and the power use to service the users –
this is the main topic of the rest of this book.
2.3.2 The UMTS Radio Features
Compared with GSM, the UMTS radio interface is totally different, and can take some time
and effort for the hard-core GSM radio planner to understand. Actually it is not complicated
at all; if you just focus on the important main parameters it is easy to understand and plan
indoor UMTS radio systems. There are in principle two different types of WCDMA –
WCDMA-TDD and WCDMA-FDD (as shown in Figure 2.12).
UMTS TDD
WCDMA-TDD uses the same frequency for the UL and the DL, alternating the direction of
the transmission over time. The equipment needs to switch between transmission and
reception, so there needs to be a certain guard time between transmission and reception to
avoid interference; after all, they are using the same frequency for both links, transmission
and reception.
Figure 2.12
The two principle types of WCDMA frequency allocation: FDD and TDD
Overview of Cellular Systems
29

FDD requires a paired set of bands, one for UL and one for DL. TDD can use the same
frequency for UL and DL, separated in time. The WCDMA-TDD system can be used in
parts of the world where it is not possible to allocate a paired set of bands.
UMTS FDD
The most used (currently only) standard for UMTS is WCDMA-FDD, which transmits and
receives at the same time (constantly). Different frequency bands for the UL and DL are
allocated as paired bands. The WCDMA-FDD requires a paired set of bands, equal
bandwidths separated with the 95 MHz duplex distance throughout the band.
Frequency Allocation
In most regions around the world the band 1920–1980 MHz is assigned for the UL of
WCDMA-FDD and the band 2110–2170 MHz is assigned for DL (as shown in Figure 2.13).
The frequency allocation for WCDMA-TDD will vary depending on the region, and where it
is possible to ﬁt the TDD frequency band assignment into the spectrum.
UMTS900
Commonly, most operators are assigned two or three WCDMA-FDD ‘2.1 GHz’ carriers per
license. Currently there are considerations on re-using the GSM900 spectrum, by converting
the ‘old’ 35 MHz GSM900 band to UMTS, raising the efﬁciency of the spectrum for better
data performance. The 35 MHz GSM spectrum will have the possibility to support seven
new UMTS WCDMA channels. Furthermore the 900 MHz band will penetrate buildings
much better compared with 2100 MHz, giving better indoor UMTS coverage.

Spread Spectrum, Interference Rejection
UMTS uses WCDMA; this is a spread spectrum signal. The narrow band information from
the individual user is modulated, and spread throughout the spectrum. This distributes the
energy of the user data over a wider bandwidth (as shown in Figure 2.14). Thus the signal
becomes less sensitive to selective interference from narrow-band interference. Typical
narrow-band interference will be inter-modulation products from narrowband services at
lower frequencies, such as GSM or DCS.
Fading Resistance
A common problem in radio communication is frequency-selective fading. This occurs when
reﬂections in the environment turn the RF channel into a multipath fading channel. The same
signal will have different signal paths, reﬂections and diffractions, thereby offsetting the
phase and timing of the signal arrival at the receiving end. Most of the fading is frequency-
selective (as shown in Figure 2.15), but the WCDMA structure solves the problem to some
extent. Even if a small portion of the WCDMA fades, most of the energy is maintained and
the communication is preserved intact.

Overview of Cellular Systems

The WCDMA RF Carrier
The bandwidth of the UMTS carrier (as shown in Figure 2.16) is about 5 MHz (4.75 MHz),
and is divided into 3.84 Mcps. The chips are the raw information rate on the channel, or the
‘carrier’ if you like. Each user is assigned a speciﬁc power according to the service
requirement and path loss to that particular user. The more user trafﬁc there is, the more
power will be transmitted and the higher the amplitude of the UMTS carrier will be (as
shown in Figure 2.17).
Coding and Chips
Each mobile in service is assigned an individual spreading code (as shown in Figure 2.18
and Figure 2.22). All of the users transmit simultaneously using the same WCDMA
Figure 2.16

frequency. The receiver is able to decode each individual user by applying the same speciﬁc
spreading code assigned to each user.
The fundamental difference from GSM is that the UMTS system uses the entire 5 MHz
spectrum constantly, separating the users only in the code domain, by assigning each
mobile a unique code sequence. This unique code is then used to encode the transmitted
data; the receiver knows the speciﬁc code to use when decoding the signal. This spreading/
despreading technique enables the base station to detect the user signal from below the
noise.
The coded signal is orthogonal to other users in the cell. The principle is that the code
is constructed in such way that one coded signal will not ‘spill’ any energy to another
coded user – if the orthogonality is maintained over the radio channel. Each individual
user signal can only be retrieved by applying the same speciﬁc code, thereby limiting the
interference between users. Essentially all transmitted UMTS information is data; each
bit of this data is multiplied by a sequence of code bits, referred to as chips. The number
of chips multiplied to each user bit is dependent on the service bit rate of the service
assigned to each user. The principle is that the transmitted data is multiplied by the ‘raw’
channel code rate of a much higher frequency in UMTS 3.84 Mcps (mega-chips per
second).
When multiplying the user data rate by a higher-frequency coded bit sequence, the
spectrum is spread over the 3.84 Mcps carrier, and becomes a spread spectrum signal. UMTS
uses a chip rate of 3.84 Mcps. This is the 3.84 Mcps that takes up the 5 MHz WCDMA radio,
but the ‘carrier’ is 3.84 Mcps.
Figure 2.18
The narrowband signal is spread using a dedicated spreading code, modulated into and
transmitted over the WCDMA carrier, to be despread and restored in the receiving end using the same
dedicated code
Overview of Cellular Systems
33

Frequency Reuse on UMTS
The cells in the UMTS system are operating on the same frequency (as shown in
Figure 2.19), using a frequency reuse of 1. UMTS cells are separated only by the use of
different primary scrambling codes; this is the ‘master key’ for the codes in that particular
cell.
Eb/No
The signal quality of the user data on UMTS is deﬁned as the Eb=No. The Eb=No is deﬁned
as the ratio of energy per bit (Eb) to the spectral noise density (No). Eb=No is the measure of
signal-to-noise ratio for a digital communication system. It is measured at the input to the
receiver and is used as the basic measure of how strong the signal is over the noise.

The Eb=No plays a major role in UMTS radio planning, as the reference point of the link
budget calculation. The Eb=No deﬁnes the maximum data rate possible with a given noise.
Different data rates have different Eb=No requirements: the higher the data speed, the stricter
the Eb=No requirements.
The Eb=No design level for the various data services are up to the operator, and are used as
the basis of the link budget calculation. A typical Eb=No planning level for voice will be
7 dB, and about 4 dB for a 384 kps service

Indoor Radio Planning

Common Pilot Channel
The common pilot channel (CPICH) does not contain any signaling. It is a pure DL channel
that serves two purposes only: to broadcast the identity the cell and to aid mobiles with cell
evaluation and selection. The CPICH is coded with the primary scrambling code of the cell; it
has a ﬁxed channelization code with a spreading factor of 256. The mobiles in the network will
measure the CPICH power from the different cells it is able to detect. It will access the cell with
the most powerful measured CPICH. The mobile will also measure and evaluate the CPICH
levels from other adjacent cells (deﬁned in the neighbor list) for handover evaluation.
A major portion of the total DL power from the base station is assigned to broadcasting the
pilot channel. Typically the base station will assign 10% (10 dB, see Figure 2.16) of the total
DL power for the CPICH. For a þ43 dBm base station the CPICH is transmitted at 33 dBm.
Ec/I0
The quality/signal strength of the pilot channel is measured as Ec=I0, the energy per chip/
interference density measured on the CPICH. It is effectively the CPICH signal strength.
When the mobile detects two or more CPICH with similar levels, the mobile will enter soft
handover. This is essential in order to secure the link. If the mobile did not enter soft
handover, the link would break down due to interference between the two cells transmitting
the same channel and received at the same power level.
The mobile continuously measures the Ec=I0 of the serving cell and adjacent cells (deﬁned
in the neighbor list/monitor set). The mobile compares the quality (Ec=I0) of the serving
CPICH against the quality of other measured CPICHs. The mobile uses trigger levels and
thresholds to add or remove cells from the active set, the cell or cells the mobile is engaged
with during trafﬁc. (For more details, refer to the description of the UMTS handover
algorithm, Section 2.3.4.)
The CPICH deﬁnes the cell size, and the service area and cell border can be adjusted by
adjusting the CPICH power of the cell. Thus it is possible to some degree to distribute trafﬁc
load to other cells by tuning cell size.
A sufﬁcient quality for the CPICH (not scrambled) will be a Ec=I0 of 10 to 15 (energy
per chip/interference) in the macrolayer. For indoor cells lower CPICH levels of 6 to
8 dB can be considered due to the high isolation of the macrocells (if the indoor system is
planned correctly).
Pilot Pollution
When a mobile receives CPICH signals at similar levels from more cells it is supposed to
enter soft handover – if it does not the quality will be degraded and the call might be
dropped. However there can be cases where a distant cell is not deﬁned in the neighbor list,
and thus the mobile is not able to enter soft handover. This will cause interference of the
serving cells’ CPICH; this is referred to as pilot pollution (as shown in Figure 2.20). This is
one of the main concerns when designing UMTS indoor solutions. The problem is often a
big concern in high-rise buildings, predominantly in the topmost section of the building,
where mobiles are able to detect outdoor cells. The problem is essentially a lack of
dominance of one serving cell (see Section 3.5.3).
Overview of Cellular Systems
35

Geometry Factor
The geometry factor is the power received by the mobile divided by the sum of noise
received by the mobile. The sum of noise is thermal noise plus interference (trafﬁc) radiated
by other base stations.
Geometry factor ¼ received signal=ðthermal noise þ interferenceÞ
The closer the mobile is to the servicing base station, the higher the geometry factor will be,
and the better the signal quality will be.
Orthogonality
Owing to the unique way the codes are constructed, they are orthogonal to each other. The
orthogonal structure of the codes insures that all the users can be active on the same channel
at the same time, without degrading each other’s service; that is, if the orthogonality is
perfect, or 1 (100%)
However, due to multipath propagation on the radio channel, especially in cities and urban
environments, the delay spreads of the phases and time of the same transmitted signal in the
receiving end will cause the codes to ‘spill over’, degrading the orthogonality and causing
the signals to interfere with each other.
The multipath environment will degrade the orthogonality, depending on how predomi-
nant the reﬂections/diffractions of the signal are. The degraded orthogonality will degrade
the effectiveness of the RF channel, degrading the maximum throughput on the WCDMA
carrier.
Figure 2.20
Pilot (CPICH) pollution is a big concern, when a mobile receives pilot power from
distant base stations without being in handover with these base stations
36
Indoor Radio Planning

In environments with low orthogonality, the data throughput of the WCDMA carrier is
degraded. In the example in Figure 2.21 we can see that users inside a building serviced by a
nearby macro base station typically have an orthogonality of less than 0.55. This is due to the
fact that most of the signal will arrive at the mobile as reﬂections, due to the absence of a
line-of-sight to the base station.

The maximum data throughput on the WCDMA carrier is dependent on the orthogon-

the efﬁciency of the RF channel
Figure 2.22

Overview of Cellular Systems
37

The degraded orthogonality causes degradation efﬁciency of the codes, causing the codes
to ‘spill over’, and this ‘code interference’ will degrade the total throughput of the UMTS
carrier. In the example from Figure 2.21, the capacity of the carrier is degraded to less than
1.5 Mbps. However, the same base station connected to an indoor distributed antenna system
would have a typical orthogonality of 0.85 and would be able to provide about 2.6 Mpbs, and
so is a considerable better use of the same resources. This is due to the fact that the indoor
user, serviced by indoor antennas, will mostly be in line-of-sight to the antennas, with only
limited reﬂections. By insuring a high orthogonality and efﬁcient use of the resources, an
indoor distributed antenna system can be used. This improves the throughput and efﬁciency
of the UMTS channel, improving the business case.
Processing Gain
When using the technique with spreading and despreading the signal over a wideband
carrier, a gain is obtained. This is referred to as the processing gain. The processing gain is
dependent on the relation between the carrier chip rate, and the user data bit (chip) rate, as
shown in Table 2.1.
Processing gain ¼ chip rate=user data rate
Processing gain ¼ 3:84 M=user rate ½linear
Processing gain ¼ 10 logð3:84 M=user rateÞ ½dB
Using these formulas you can calculate the processing gain of the speciﬁc UMTS data service
Examples
The processing gain for high-speed data, 384 kbps, is 10 log ð3:84 Mcps=384 kbÞ ¼ 10 dB.
The processing gain for speech, 12.2 kbps, is 10 log ð3:84 Mcps=12:2 kbpsÞ ¼ 25 dB.
The use of orthogonal spreading codes and processing gain is the main feature in UMTS/
WCDMA, giving the system robustness against self-interference. It is the main reason for a
frequency reuse factor of 1, due to the rejection of noise from other cells/users.
When you know the required bit power density Eb=No the speciﬁc service (voice
12:2 kbps þ 5 dB, data þ20dB) you are able to calculate the required signal-to-interference
ratio: voice at 12.2 kbps needs an approximately 5 dB wideband signal-to-interference ratio
minus the processing gain, 5 dB  25 dB ¼ 20 dB. In practice, the processing gain means that

2.3.3 UMTS Noise Control
UMTS is very sensitive to excessive noise, and noise control is essential. All trafﬁc is on the
same frequency and all signals from active mobiles need to reach the base station at the same

level. If one mobile reaches the uplink of the base station at a much higher level, it will
interfere with all the trafﬁc from other mobiles in service on the same cell. Every mobile
uses the same frequency at the same time.
To control this issue, UMTS uses very strict noise and power control. Trafﬁc in UMTS is
essential white noise to other users, and the amount of noise from a cell is directly related to
the trafﬁc.
Admission Control
More trafﬁc in a UMTS cell is equal to more radiated noise in the cell. This noise will impact
surrounding cells with interference, and therefore it is very important to limit the load in the
cells to a preset maximum noise level in order to control the increase in noise.
Loading a UMTS cell by 50% is equal to a 3 dB increase in noise; this is a typical value
for the maximum allowable noise increase. The value can be set in the network individually
for each cell. Indoor cells are more isolated from the macro layer, and can in principle be
loaded relative highly, maybe up to 60–65%, giving a higher capacity.
In order to evaluate the noise increase due to trafﬁc in the cell, node B will constantly
measure and evaluate the overall noise power received on the UL in order to evaluate the UL
noise increase in the cell. By doing so, the base station can calculate and evaluate how much
headroom is left for new trafﬁc, this in order to control the admission of new trafﬁc in the
cell (as shown in Figure 2.23).

Overview of Cellular Systems
39

The total noise power on the UL of node B will be a result of the sum of the noise
generated by the trafﬁc in the cell itself, noise (trafﬁc) from other cells and the noise ﬁgure
from the base station:
Noisetotal ¼ owntraffic noise þ othercells0 noise þ node Bnoise power
In addition to the noise generated by the trafﬁc in the cell, there will be a contribution from
noise from users in other cells and ﬁnally the noise ﬁgure (NF) of node B and other active
hardware in the system.
The base station noise ﬁgure (noise ﬂoor) is the reference for zero trafﬁc in the cell. If the
receiver only measures the noise power generated by the base station itself, the network
assumes that there is no trafﬁc in the cell/adjacent cells. The network assumes the load rate
to be zero and that the cell has its full potential for servicing new trafﬁc.
Using this noise measurement (including the hardware noise reference of the node B), the
network can evaluate if the new admitted trafﬁc will cause a noise increase that exceeds the
predeﬁned maximum UL noise increase in the cell, and the base station will keep admitting
new trafﬁc in the cell until the max noise rise is predicted or measured.
Impact of Noise Power from External Equipment
It is very important that the base station noise reference level for no trafﬁc is updated when
connecting any active equipment to the uplink of the base station. Repeaters, active
distributed antenna system, etc., will generate noise power on the uplink, and these systems
should be designed so that minimum noise power is injected into the UL port of the base
station.
Any noise increase will cause the base station to assume this noise power to be trafﬁc in
the cell, or adjacent cells – essentially offsetting the trafﬁc potential for the cell. It may cause
the base station to not admit trafﬁc to its full potential, and in severe cases to not admit any
trafﬁc at all. Therefore it is crucial to adjust the admission control parameters in the network,
with regard to the added hardware (HW) noise power on the UL of the node B.
For most UMTS base station networks these parameters can be found in the parameter set
for calibrating the system to connect to mast-mounted ampliﬁers or low-noise ampliﬁers
(LNA). However the main issue is to design the distributed antenna system so that you
minimize the noise load on the base station without compromising the performance of the
link; this can be done using uplink attenuators; see Section 7.5 on noise control for more
details.
Cell Breathing
Any trafﬁc in UMTS is equal to the noise increase on the radio channel. We know that
UMTS is very sensitive to noise increase, and therefore it is important to control the noise
increase in the network. When designing UMTS systems you need to decide how much
noise increase you will allow in the cell and adjacent cells. Noise from trafﬁc in cells will
also increase the noise in adjacent cells and impact the coverage and capacity of those
cells.

Indoor Radio Planning

In Figure 2.24 you can see an example of how the noise increase and power load in the cell
will affect the footprint of the cell; the greater the load, the more noise, the less the coverage of
the cell will be – this is referred to as cell breathing. It will be different for the uplink and the
downlink, so a cell can be both downlink and uplink limited, depending on the current load
proﬁle (as shown in Figure 2.26).
It is important that you design the system for a maximum allowable noise increase or load.
If you do not, the trafﬁc will cause the noise to spin out of control. The cell would collapse,
and drop the calls on the cell border due to excessive noise increase.
Noise Increase
You are able to calculate the noise increase in the cell. Using 50% of the remaining capacity
in a cell is equal to noise increase of factor 2, corresponding to 3 dB. Loading a cell from 0 to
50% load is a noise increase of 3 dB, and using another 50% of the remaining capacity, from
50 to 75%, is an additional 3 dB, a total of 6 dB, and so on.
You can calculate the noise increase as a function of the load rate:
Noise increase ¼ 10 log½1=ð1  load factorÞ
Typical cells will be designed to be loaded to a maximum of 50–60%, and the graph in
Figure 2.25, based on the noise increase formula, clearly shows why. A 60% load rate,
corresponding to a load factor of 0.6, will cause a noise increase of 4 dB. In Figure 2.25 it is
very clear what happens with the noise when you exceed 80% – the noise simply rises
abruptly, out of control. This excessive noise rise will cause the cell to collapse.

Cell breathing is caused by the noise increase owing to the load of the cell; more load
will give more noise increase and a smaller coverage footprint
Overview of Cellular Systems
41

The capacity in UMTS is directly related to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR; see the
geometry factor, Section 2.3.2) in the cell. The capacity is proportional to the interference in
the cell. Any added interference in the cell will impact the capacity.
UL and DL Load
UMTS is noise-limited on the uplink and power-limited on the downlink. In a typical cell the
link tends to be noise-limited during light trafﬁc load, and power-limited when the trafﬁc
load rises (as shown in Figure 2.26).
The service proﬁle of trafﬁc generated by the users in the cell will also affect the balance
of the cell between being downlink- or uplink-limited. Typical data users will use higher
downlink data speed, for downloads, etc.
The base station’s capabilities with regards to processing power, power resources and
receiver sensitivity also play a role, but the principle is that the same cell can be both uplink-
and downlink-limited depending of the load proﬁle.
2.3.4 UMTS Handovers
There are several handover scenarios in UMTS. The type of handover is dependent on
whether the handover is within the same node B, different node B, different UMTS
frequencies or even system handover to and from GSM and DCS. As we know, UMTS
uses the same frequency for all the cells and the only possible way for a mobile station to
hand over from one cell to another is to be connected with both cells in the area where

both cells are at equal levels. Typically a handover in UMTS involves two or three cells.
This handover function and algorithm is totally different compared with GSM handover
zones.
Softer Handover
When a mobile station is within the service area of cells originating from the same node B at
the same power level, the mobile station is in softer handover (as shown in Figure 2.27).
The mobile will use both RF links, and the node B will control and combine the signal
stream to the RNC (see Figure 2.37 for UTRAN network elements). Two separate codes are
used on the downlink, and the mobile will use rake receiving to receive the two downlink
paths.
On the UL the base station will use rake receiving for the two signal paths. The mobile
will provide some extra load on node B due to the double link for only one call. This extra
load is limited to processing power (channel elements) and impacts only the serving base
station.
Soft Handover
When a mobile is in the service area of two cells originating from different node Bs (as
shown in Figure 2.28) the mobile will use one RF link to both base stations; this is macro
diversity and both node Bs will send the call to the RNC (see Figure 2.37 for UTRAN

network elements). In this scenario the mobile will not only load both cells with regards to
power, noise and processing power (channel elements), but also double the load on the
transmission link (IUR interface) back to the RNC/RNCs from both node Bs.
As in softer handover, two separate air interfaces are used; the mobile combines the
downlink signals using rake receiving. The main difference is on the uplink, owing to the
fact that in soft handover the RNC not the base station will have to perform the combining of
the two uplink signal paths.
Typically the RNC will select the uplink signal path with the best frame reliability
indicator, which is used for outer loop power control. For indoor radio planning for UMTS,
you should aim to keep the soft handover areas to a minimum.
OBS!
Note that if a strong candidate neighbor cell is not monitored (deﬁned in the monitor
set/neighbor list), the mobile will not be able to enter soft handover with that nonmonitored
cell. If the signal from the nonmonitored cell is high, it will degrade the quality (Ec=I0) of the
serving cell, degrading the data performance, and even causing the call to be dropped.
The Soft Handover Algorithm
The handover algorithm in UMTS (as shown in Figure 2.29) evaluates the radio quality
(Ec=I0) of the serving and adjacent cells. The Ec=I0 measurement is used by the mobile
for evaluating the serving cell and handover candidate cells; the UMTS system uses the
following terminology for describing the handovers:
 Active set – this is the set of cells that the mobile is in connection with during a soft
handover; it is all the cells in the active set currently engaged with trafﬁc to/from the
mobile.
 Monitored set/neighbor set – these are the neighbors that the mobile must monitor (the
neighbor list), but whose pilot Ec=I0 is not strong enough to be added to the active set and
engage in soft handover.
Example
This is an example of how the soft handover algorithm works (shown in Figure 2.29).
Speciﬁc events are deﬁned in UMTS to describe the status/action.
Event 1A, Radio Link Addition The monitored cell will, if the serving cell pilot Ec=I0 >
best pilot Ec=I0 – reporting range þ hysteresis event 1A, for a period of dT, and the active set
is not full, be added to the active set, and engage in soft or softer handover.
Event 1B, Radio Link Removal In soft or softer handover, and if one of the serving cells
pilot Ec=I0 < best pilot Ec=I0 – reporting range – hysteresis event 1B, for a period of dT, then
this cell will be removed from the active set.
Event 1C, Combined Radio Link Addition/Removal (Replacement) If the active set is full,
and no more soft handover links can be added and the best candidate pilot Ec=I0 > worst old
pilot Ec=I0þ hysteresis event 1C, for a period of dT, then the cell with the worst Ec=I0 in the
active set will be replaced with the best candidate cell from the monitored set.

frequencies, the mobile will do a hard handover. This could be different frequencies within
the same cell, or between different cells. When the mobile station performs a system
handover, i.e. a handover between GSM/DCS and UMTS, it will also be a hard handover.
Hard handovers are more difﬁcult to control and more likely to fail, and therefore these
events should be limited to a minimum in order to maximize network performance and
quality.
2.3.5 UMTS Power Control
Compared with GSM, UMTS power control is complex and extremely strict; the motivation
is the need for strict noise control. All trafﬁc on the UL of the base station has to arrive at the
exact same level, or else one high signal would overpower the trafﬁc from all other mobiles.
They all operate at the same frequency at the same time.
The power control in UMTS has three different stages: no power control, open loop power
control (cell access) and closed loop power control, in dedicated (trafﬁc) mode. Figure 2.30
shows the principle of the UMTS power control.
Figure 2.30
The power control algorithm in UMTS
Overview of Cellular Systems
47

Idle Mode
No power control is needed when the mobile is in idle mode. The mobile will measure the
received CPICH power and monitor other power control parameters (PWR_INI and
PWR_STEP info). The mobile can thereby calculate what initial power is needed when
accessing the base station, in order to make sure it does not overpower the uplink of the base
station and degrade the performance for other users.
Open Loop Power Control
Open loop power control (PC) is used when the mobile is in transition from idle mode to
dedicated mode (setting up a call or responding to a paging signal). The mobile’s initial
power for the network attachment is estimated using the downlink pilot (CPICH) signal. The
mobile station will send aaccess probes to the base station when accessing the network. The
mobile will monitor the system information transmitted by the base station with regards to
the reference for the transmitted CPICH power. This enables the mobile station to calculate
the path loss back to the base station.
Access Procedure in UMTS
MS starts with low power, to prevent UL ‘blocking’ the base station (BS), calculating the
transmit power for the ﬁrst access burst (as shown in Figure 2.31):
PWR INIT ¼ CPICH Tx Power  CPICH RSCP þ UL Interference þ UL Required CI
where PWR INI ¼ initial access power; CPICH Tx Power ¼ transmitted CPICH power;
CPICH RSCP ¼ received CPICH signal strength; UL Interference ¼ uplink interference
measured by the node B; and UL Required CI ¼ uplink quality margin.

This procedure will insure that the mobile will not use a high initial access power,
increasing the noise on the UL, resulting in dropped calls for already ongoing trafﬁc. Then
the mobile station waits for response signal (access grant) from node B. If no access grant is
received, the mobile assumes that the access probe did not reach the base station. Then the
mobile station will increase the transmit power for the next access probe by the PWR_STEP
parameter broadcasted by the cell. There will be random intervals for these access bursts,
within a speciﬁed timing window, in order to prevent the access signals from several mobiles
colliding repeatedly if accessing the cell at exactly the same time.
Closed loop Power Control (Inner Loop)
Compared with GSM, where the power adjustment is done every 60 ms, the power control in
UMTS is very fast. With a power control rate of about every 666 ms, the mobile transmit
power is adjusted; this is a power control of 1500 Hz in closed loop power control. The
closed loop power control is active when the mobile station is in trafﬁc mode (dedicated
mode). On the downlink, power control on the base station preserves marginal power for
mobiles on the edge of the cell.
The Outer loop Power Control
The purpose of the outer loop power control is to adjust the Eb=No target in order to fulﬁl the
FER target (no more, no less). Owing to the multipath fading proﬁle, this will be dependant
on the speed of the mobile. Mobiles moving at faster speed will have more fading impact,
and need more power resources. The FER target will be adjusted accordingly (as shown in
Figure 2.32).
UMTS Power Control Compensation for Fading
Normally a fading radio channel will affect the signal strength on the uplink. This is
dangerous for UMTS because one mobile more powerful than others in the cell will affect

the performance – after all, all trafﬁc is on the same frequency at the same time. To
compensate for the fading, the UMTS power control is so fast (1500 Hz) that it is able to
level out the fading channel and to a large extent compensate for Rayleigh fading, at
moderate speeds.
In Figure 2.33 you can see the principle: the fading radio channel (the solid line) will
provide a large variance on the path loss, depending on the speed of the mobile. The power
control (dotted line) will compensate for this fading, and on the uplink of the base station the
topmost graph shows that the resulting radio channel is received compensated by the power
control, with a typical maximum variance of 2–3 dB.

2.3.6 UMTS and Multipath Propagation
Ideally the radio channel path should be direct, in line-of-sight (LOS), with no reﬂections or
obstructions between the base station and the mobile. However, in the real world, especially
in cities and urban environments, most RF signals reaching the receiver will have been
reﬂected or diffracted by the clutter of the buildings. Typically only a small portion of the RF
signal will be the direct signal from the base station; the main signal will derive from
reﬂections. This is called multipath, and the environment creates multipath fading due to the
phase shifts and different delays of the signals amplifying and canceling each other. This is
the main source for orthogonality degradation, especially when serving indoor mobile users
from the macro network.
An example of the fading environment with reﬂections can be seen in Figure 2.34, where
T1 is the direct signal, and T2/T3 are the reﬂected and delayed signals.
At the receiver T1, T2 and T3 will be offset in time and amplitude (as shown in
Figure 2.35). In a normal receiver this will mean that, depending on the phase and amplitude,
the signals will cancel each other out to some extent. However, the UMTS system uses a
clever type of receiver, the rake receiver.

Figure 2.34
In the outdoor environment the RF channel is multipath, having more than one signal
path between the mobile and the base station. The signal phase and amplitude of these signals will not

51

The Rake Receiver
Like the tines, or ﬁngers, on a rake, the rake receiver has more than one point. Actually the
rake receiver could be compared with three or four parallel receivers, each receiving a
different offset signal from the same RF channel. The rake receiver in this example (as
shown in Figure 2.36) uses three ﬁngers to receive the three differently phased signals, T1,
T2 and T3 (as shown Figure 2.35), so these three signals are phase-adjusted, aligned and
combined into the output signal by the rake receiver.
In order for the UMTS rake receiver to work, the delay separation between the different
signals has to be more than one chip duration (0.26 ms). Delays shorter than one chip cannot
be recovered by the rake receiver, and will cause inter-symbol interference.

2.3.7 UMTS Signaling
UMTS Transport Channels
The UMTS radio interface has logical channels that are mapped to transport channels. These
transport channels are then again mapped to physical channels. Logical-to-transport channel
conversion happens in the medium access control (MAC) layer, which is a lower sublayer in
the data link layer (layer 2).
Logical Channels
The logical channels are divided into two groups: control channels and trafﬁc channels. The
MAC uses the logical channels for data transport. The trafﬁc channels carry the voice and
data trafﬁc.
Control Channels
 BCCH-DL – this channel broadcasts information to the mobiles for system control, system
information about the serving cell and the monitored set (neighbor list). The BCCH is
carried by the BCH or FACH.
 PCCH-DL – the PCCH is associated with the PICH. The channel is used for paging and
notiﬁcation information. The PCCH is carried by the PCH.
 DCCH-UL/DL – this channel carries dedicated radio resource control information, in both
directions. Together with the DTCH, the DCCH can be carried by different combinations
of transport channels: RACH, FACCH, CPCH, DSCA or DCH.
 CCCH-UL/DL – this channel’s purpose is to transfer control information between the
mobiles and the network. The RACH and FACH are the transport channels used by the
CCCH.
 SHCCH-UL/DL – this channel is only used in UMTS TDD. It is a bi-directional channel,
used to transport shared channel control information.
Trafﬁc Channels
 DTCH-UL/DL – this is the bi-directional channel used for user trafﬁc.
 CTCH-DL – this is a downlink-only channel, used to transmit dedicated user information
to a single mobile or a whole group of mobiles.
Transport Channels
The user data is transmitted via the air interface using transport channels. In the physical
layer these channels are mapped into physical channels. There are two types of transport
channels, common and dedicated channels. Dedicated channels are for one user only;
common channels are for all mobiles in the cell.
Overview of Cellular Systems
53

Dedicated Transport Channels
 DCH-UL/DL, mapped to DCCH and DTCH – this channel is used to transfer user data and
control information, handover commands, measurement reports etc. to and from a speciﬁc
mobile. Each mobile has a dedicated DCH in both UL and DL.
Common Transport Channels
There are six common transport channels:
 BCH-DL – this channel transmits identiﬁcation information about the cell and network,
access codes, access slots, etc. The BCH is sent with a low ﬁxed data rate. The BCH must
be decoded by all the mobiles in the cell, therefore relative high power is allocated to
broadcast the BCH. The BCH is mapped into the PCCPCH (primary common control
physical channel).
 FACH-DL – this channel transmits control information to the mobiles that are in service on
the network. The FACH can also carry packet data. The FACH is mapped into the
SCCPCH (secondary control physical channel).
 PCH-DL – this is the channel carrying the paging signals within the location area, which
alert mobiles about incoming calls, SMS and data connections. The PCH is mapped into
the SCCPCH.
 RACH-UL – this channel is used by the mobile when accessing the network with access
bursts. Control information is sent by the mobile to the network on the RACH. The RACH
is mapped into PRACH (physical random access channel).
 Uplink common packet channel (CPCH)-UL – this channel is used for fast power control,
and also provides additional capacity beyond the capacity of the RACH. The CPCH is
mapped into the PCPCH (physical common packet channel).
 Downlink shared channel (DSCH)-DL – this channel can be shared by many mobiles and
is used for nontime-critical data transmission on the downlink, web browsing, etc. The
DSCH is mapped to the PDSCH (physical downlink shared channel).
Physical Channels
The transport channels are mapped into physical channels.
 CPICH – this channel identiﬁes the cell, used by the mobile for cell selection, and to
measure the quality of serving radio link and the adjacent cells. The CPICH enables the
mobile to select the best cell, and the CPICH plays a signiﬁcant role in cell selection and
cell reselection.
 Synchronization Channel (SCH) – there is both a primary and a secondary SCH. These
channels are used by the mobiles to synchronize to the network.
 Common control physical channel (CCPCH) – there are two types of CCPCHs, the
primary and the secondary:
– PCCPCH continuously broadcasts the system identiﬁcation (the BCH) and access
control information;
54
Indoor Radio Planning

– SCCPCH transmits the FACH (forward access channel), and provides control informa-
tion, as well as the PACH (paging channel).
 PRACH – this channel is used by the mobile to transmit the RACH burst when accessing
the network.
 Dedicated physical data channel DPDCH – this channel is the user data trafﬁc channel
(DCH).
 Dedicated physical control channel (DPCCH) – this channel carries the control informa-
tion to and from the mobile. The channel carries bidirectional pilot bits as well as the
transport format combination identiﬁer (TFCI). On the DL channel is included transmit
power control and feedback information bits (FBI).
 PDSCH – this channel shares control information (DSCH) to all mobiles within the
service area of the cell.
 PCPCH – this channel is for carrying packet data (CPCH).
 Acquisition indicator channel (AICH) – this channel is used to inform the mobile about the
DCH is must use to connect to the Node B.
 Paging indication channel (PICH) – this channel indicates the paging group the mobile
belongs to. This enables the mobiles to be able to monitor the PCH when its group is
paged, and in the meantime the mobile can ‘sleep’ and preserve its battery.
 CPCH status indication channel (CSICH) – this DL channel carries information about the
status of the CPCH. Can also be used for DL data service.
 Collision detection channel assignment indication channel (CD/CA-ICH) – this DL
channel is used to indicate to the mobile if the channel assignment is active or
inactive.
Power Allocation for Common Control Channels
In the network the power is allocated to the physical common control channels is deﬁned.
These power levels can be adjusted, but typical settings could be as shown in Table 2.2.
Even with no trafﬁc on the cell, 16% (8.1dB) of the power resource is allocated for
common control channels.
Measuring the UMTS Transmit Power
If you need to measure the power level at the base station antenna connector, you will need
to know these settings. If the settings are like the settings above, you will measure the
maximum power – 8.1 dB, so a 46 dBm base station will give a measurement of 37.9 dBm

when there is no trafﬁc on the cell. Most UMTS networks will allow you to preset a speciﬁc
load in the cell, and then this reference can be used for power measurements.
2.3.8 The UMTS Network Elements
This is a short introduction to the elements of the UTRAN (UMTS terrestrial radio access
network) and the key elements of the core network (as shown in Figure 2.37). This book is
not intended as a detailed training book about the UTRAN and core network, but it is
important that the indoor radio planner understands the general principles of the total
network, especially regarding the UTRAN.
User Equipment
The mobile station is referred to as the user equipment (UE). This indicates that the UE is
much more than ‘just’ a mobile telephone. The UE is a mobile data device (could be a
mobile telephone). However, throughout this book, the UE is referred to as the mobile
station, in order for the examples to be compatible with both UMTS and GSM.
Node B, Base Station
The base station in the UTRAN network is called node B. Node B consists of transceivers,
processing modules that provide the ‘channel elements’ that service the users. The node B
interfaces to the UE over the air interface, the Uu Interface. Interfacing node B to the RNC is
the Iub interface.
Node B will also perform important measurements on the Uu interface, and report these
measurement results (reports) to the RNC with regards to quality of the link. These are
BLER, block error rate, and BER, bit error rate. They are needed in order for the RNC to be
able to evaluate the QOS (quality of service), and adjust the power control targets
accordingly. Also, the reception level of the mobiles is measured and reported, as well as
the signal-to-noise ratio, etc.

Radio Network Controller
The radio network controller (RNC) is controlling the node Bs within its own system
(RNS). For speech service, the RNC interfaces to the MSC. For packet-switched data
service the RNC interfaces to the SGSN. The RNC is responsible for the load on the
individual cells in the RNS, and handles admission (trafﬁc) control, code allocation. Once a
connection has been established between UE and node B, signaling to the elements higher
up in the network is done by the RNC. This RNC is then referred to as the serving RNC, the
SRNC.
The SRNC is responsible for handover evaluation, outer loop power control, as well as the
signaling between the UE and the rest of the UTRAN. If the UE signal can be received (in
soft handover) by other node Bs controlled by other RNCs, these RNCs are called DRNC,
drift RNCs. The DRNC can process the UL signal from the UE and provide macro diversity,
transferring the data via the Iub/Iur interfaces to the SRNC.
Radio Network Sub-system
One RNC with all the connected node Bs is deﬁned as a radio network sub-system (RNS). A
UTRAN consists of several RNSs; each RNC within the RNS is interconnected with an Iur
interface.
 Uu interface – this is the radio interface of WCDMA, the air interface between the UE and
the node B.
 Iu interface – this is the link between the UTRAN and the core network. The interface is
standardized so a UTRAN from one manufacture will be compatible with a core network
form another manufacture.
 Iur interface – the Iur interfaces the different RNCs; it interfaces data from soft handovers
between different RNCs.
 Iub – between the node B and the RNC the Iub interface is used. Like the Iu interface, this
is fully standardized so different RNCs will support different vendors’ node Bs.
Core Network
The core network is not of interest of the radio planner on a daily basis, but a short
description and overview is appropriate.
 Mobile switching center – the mobile switching center (MSC) controls the circuit switched
connections, speech and real-time data applications for an active UE in the network. Often
the VLR will be co-located with the MSC.
 Gateway mobile switching center – the gateway mobile switching center (GMSC)
interfaces the MSC to external MSCs for circuit-switched data and voice calls.
 Serving GPRS support node – the serving GPRS support node (SGSN) switches the
internal packet-switched data trafﬁc.
 Gateway GPRS support node – the gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) switches the
external packet-switched data trafﬁc.

Visitor Location Register
The VLR is a database, with the location (location area) of all UEs attached to the network.
When a UE registers in the network, the VLR will retrieve relevant data about the user (SIM)
from the HLR associated with the SIM (IMSI).
Home Location Register
The HLR is a database that contains all the relevant data about the subscriber (SIM). This is
the subscription proﬁle, roaming partner and current VLR/SGSN location of the UE.
2.4 Introduction to HSPA
It is not within the scope of this book to describe all the details about HSPA. Only the issues
that important for maximizing the HSPA performance inside buildings will be covered.
Please refer to Reference [5] for more details about HSPA.
2.4.1 Introduction
Seamless mobility for voice and data service is of paramount importance for the modern
enterprise. In particular, service for mobile telephones and data terminals is important, as
most professionals leans towards ‘one person, one number’, also referred to as the mobile
ofﬁce. The service offering and quality should be seamless, no matter whether you are at
home, on the road or in the ofﬁce.
Ofﬁces with a heavy concentration of high-proﬁle voice and data users, in particular, pose
speciﬁc challenges for high-performance in-building data performance using HSPA. HSPA/
Super-3G is an alternative to Wi-Fi service. Mobile 3G networks are deploying HSPA on
their outdoor networks, and full mobility is now an option for high-speed data. Providing
sufﬁcient in-Building coverage on HSPA poses a major challenge for the mobile network
operators due to the degradation of the radio service when covering indoor users from the
outdoor network. The data users with the highest demand-to-data service rate and speed are
typically located indoors, so a special focus on how to solve the challenge is important.
2.4.2 Wi-Fi
Why will the users prefer to use 3G/HSPA rather than Wi-Fi? Wi-Fi is accessible in many
places, it is ‘free’ and the data speed is claimed to be high, in excess of 50 Mbps, so why not
just use Wi-Fi to provide mobile data indoors?
The Challenges for the Users, Using Wi-Fi
Lack of Mobility
There are no handovers on Wi-Fi, so users cannot roam around in the building without
dropping the service. However, developments are ongoing to make handovers possible
between Wi-Fi access points, and even to other systems.
58
Indoor Radio Planning

Hassle to get Wi-Fi Service
It is not very user-friendly to obtain Wi-Fi service. It is often expensive and you have to get a
speciﬁc user access code for every Wi-Fi provider in each building.
Wi-Fi Service is Slow
The data rate on the Wi-Fi–air interface is high, in excess of 50 Mbps. However, the actual
user data rate is not limited by the air interface but by the ADSL backhaul to the Wi-Fi
access point. Typical user data rates on public-access Wi-Fi services in hotels and airport are
often lower than 400 kbps, far below the 54 Mbps on the typical Wi-Fi air interface.
No Guarantee of Service
Wi-Fi uses free open spectrum, so there is no guarantee that other Wi-Fi providers will not
deploy Wi-Fi service in the same areas, using the same or adjacent frequencies and degrading
the current Wi-Fi service. Therefore there is no quality of service guarantee using Wi-Fi.
Wi-Fi Over Indoor DAS
Why not distribute Wi-Fi over the DAS? To understand why it is not advisable to distribute
Wi-Fi over the same distributed antenna system (DAS) that distributes the mobile service for
GSM and UMTS, you need to understand the basic characteristics of Wi-Fi, refer to Figure 2.38.
 Wi-Fi is distributed capacity – the basic concept of Wi-Fi is to distribute the data capacity
out to the location of the data users by the use of distributed base stations, Wi-Fi access

points. By using the strategy of distribution of the Wi-Fi data capacity and deploying the
Wi-Fi access points locally, combined with the limited coverage range from these access
points, you will be able to support high data rates in the building. This is exactly the same
principle as frequency reuse in a cellular network. If you have limited frequencies on a
GSM roll-out, you do not just deploy one tall macro site in the center of a city and blast
power on a limited number of frequencies. This is like Wi-Fi only having limited number
of frequencies; you need to distribute the GSM base stations to raise capacity. The same
principle applies to Wi-Fi: you need to distribute the access points to tender for the
capacity need.
 Hot-spot data coverage – Wi-Fi is designed to cover the hot-spot data need for
speciﬁc locations in the building. It is only possible to deploy three or four Wi-Fi
carriers in the same area without degrading the service, owing to adjacent channel
interference.
Why Not Distribute Wi-Fi Over the DAS?
It does not make sense to combine the RF signal of one to three Wi-Fi access points (APs)
and distribute it via the DAS, owing to the inherent difference between GSM/UMTS/HSPA
and Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi is distributed capacity via APs, and GSM/UMTS HSPA is centralized
capacity, distributed via DAS.
If you distribute the Wi-Fi RF signal over the DAS you face these limitations:
 Limited number of carriers in the same cell, limited capacity.
 Not enough capacity for the data users in most buildings.
 The concept of Wi-Fi is distributed capacity, not centralized in a DAS like the capacity of
mobile services such as UMTS/HSPA.
 Wi-Fi is TDD; with more than one AP in the same cell the effect is that the APs are not
synchronized and the transmission will collide, degrading the performance.
 Wi-Fi APs use antenna diversity; this is important to boost the performance, which is lost
in the DAS.
 The desired coverage area for the Wi-Fi and mobile signal might not correlate.
 The sector plan on the mobile system will dictate the capacity on Wi-Fi.

HSDPA High-speed Downlink Packet Access
HSDPA is a high-speed downlink data service that can be deployed on the existing 3G
network infrastructure. The operators can deploy the ﬁrst phase on the existing UMTS R99
network, using the same UMTS CH (as shown in Figure 2.39) and use the power headroom
not utilized by the UMTS trafﬁc.
This provides the mobile operator with a deployment strategy that can support the need
for high-speed downlink data rates, at a relative low deployment cost. Many operators will
prefer to use a separate CH for HSDPA, because loading the existing UMTS R99 carrier with

Indoor Radio Planning

HSDPA will cause the network to run constantly on a higher load rate, increasing the noise
on the existing UMTS CH, degrading the UMTS capacity.
Why will the operators prefer to use HSDPA?
 Typically the highest data load is on the downlink.
 HSDPA will have a trunking gain of the radio capacity.
 There is no need for distributed APs like with Wi-Fi.
 Operators can use their existing UMTS network to launch HSDPA.
 HSDPA is more spectrum-efﬁcient compared with EDGE and UMTS.
 There is higher spectrum efﬁciency, more data per MHz.
 There are fewer production costs per Mb.
 There are higher data speeds, up to 14 Mbps, with indoor DAS systems.
 Mobile operators can compete with Wi-Fi using HSPA.
HSDPA Key Features
HSDPA can perform high downlink data rates, provided that the radio link quality is high.
 Downlink data Rates up to 14.4 Mbps.
 No soft handover, so pico cells overlapping in the same building will produce ‘self
interference’ (see Figure 4.38).
 Can use the same channel as UMTS by utilizing the ‘power headroom’ for HSDPA (as
shown in Figure 2.39).
 Typical operators will launch HSDPA on a separate carrier, to minimize noise increase on
the UMTS service.
 HSDPA is a downlink data service; users will use UMTS on the uplink until HSUPA is
deployed.
 For the uplink data transmission from the mobile, UMTS R99 is used until HSUPA is
launched in 2008 to cater for higher uplink data rates.

Indoor HSDPA Coverage
Why do you need indoor active DAS systems to have high quality HSDPA?
 The data speed is related to the SNR. A good quality radio link is needed to produce
higher speeds.
 The macro layer will use excessive power to reach indoor users, causing interference and
degradation of the macro layer. Only in the buildings few hundred meters from the outdoor
base station will it be possible to service indoor users with HSPA coverage. In an urban
environment it is not likely to exceed 360 kbps in the major portion of the area.
 Production cost will be lower per Mb for the operators, using indoor systems where the
trafﬁc is.
2.4.4 Indoor HSPA Coverage
The best performance on HSPA is achieved by deploying indoor DAS. The data speed is
related to the SNR. A good radio link, with a high SNR, is needed to produce higher speeds.
Using the outdoor macro layer causes excessive power to reach indoor users, causing
interference and degradation of the macro layer. Only in buildings a few hundred meters
from the outdoor base station will it be possible to service indoor users with acceptable
HSDPA coverage. In urban environments it is not likely to exceed data speeds of 360 kbps
indoors, without the use of dedicated in-building systems.
It is possible to lower the production cost per Mb for the operators by deploying indoor
DAS to service HSDPA, as dedicated in-building systems help ofﬂoad the macro network.
The Impact of HSUPA
HSUPA (high-speed uplink packet access) will provide the users the possibility of high-
speed data rates on the uplink. HSUPA relies on the mobile’s ability to reach the network and
will be sensitive to bad macro network quality and to the high loss of passive in-building
systems. Therefore, an active DAS system will be essential for providing a high-quality
service. The low noise of the active DAS and the high power delivered at the DAS antenna
will give the highest possible data rate performance for HSUPA.
The Choice of DAS Distribution for HSPA
HSPA performance is very sensitive to the quality of the radio link, the dominance and the
isolation of the indoor signal. How to insure this is explored in Chapters 3 and 4. The DAS
that will perform the best is the DAS that will provide the highest downlink radiated power
at the antenna, and the lowest possible noise ﬁgure. For medium to large buildings it will
often be some form of active DAS that will perform the best HSPA service, owing to the
attenuation of passive DAS. Be careful and design the DAS solution to maximum isolation;
good indoor design strategy is very important for HSPA performance (refer to Chapter 5 for
more details). Passive coax solutions do not perform at the higher data rates. Whereas using
passive DAS was sometimes acceptable for 2G mobile services for voice only, the future is
data, and the high losses on the coax cables will degrade the data speed.

Indoor Radio Planning

Advantages of Using HSPA
Providing high-speed mobile data via HSPA distributed indoors via a DAS has several
advantages for the mobile operator:
 Better HSPA service – users on 3G (HSPA) will have coherent coverage; users can roam
from the outdoor network to the indoor DAS with full mobile data service.
 Laptops are HSPA ready – new laptops come with integrated 3G cards. Like the early days
of Wi-Fi, users on HSPA will initially have to use HSPA plug-in cards in their PC, but the
new generation of laptops comes with pre-installed HSPA support.
 Less production cost per Mb – the production cost on HSPA is signiﬁcant lower than for
EDGE and UMTS data service, boosting the business case for the operators.
 Seamless billing – the user does not have to purchase individual Wi-Fi service subscrip-
tions in the individual buildings from individual service providers, often at a high cost.
Users on HSPA can get all the data billing via their normal mobile subscription.
 Easy to connect with HSPA – users do not need to scan for Wi-Fi and try to connect at
various Wi-Fi service providers. Operators will have automatic algorithms enabling the
users just to ‘click and connect’.
 Better than Wi-Fi – HSPA service with indoor DAS can easily outperform Wi-Fi. The
DAS will distribute the HSPA service throughout the building, supporting the highest
possible data rate. 3G and HSPA will service the mobile data users with higher data rates.
The mobile system is not limited by the relative slow ADSL backhaul like the Wi-Fi AP.
Typically HSPA will provide DL data rates exceeding 6 Mbps, when using indoor DAS.
Table 2.3 clearly shows how competitive HSDPA can be compared with Wi-Fi service.
This example is a shopping mall where a mobile operator outperforms the existing Wi-Fi
provider, by deploying HSPA DAS antennas in the Wi-Fi hot spots.
2.4.5 Indoor HSPA Planning for Maximum Performance
The highest mobile data rates are typically needed only in hot-spot areas of the building.
Therefore you must apply a strategy to our indoor design that is based on the hot spot areas
of the building. Locating DAS antennas in these areas will provide the highest possible data

rate; the rest of the building can then be planned around these antenna locations. This
principle is described in Section 5.4.4. Hot spot areas will typically be areas where mobile
data users are able to sit down and use their PC or mobile data device.
Hot-spot data areas in buildings will typically be:

2.4.6 HSDPA Coverage from the Macro Network
It is possible to provide sufﬁcient levels of RF signal inside buildings to provide a strong
UMTS signal and to some extent HSPA coverage, provided that the serving macro base
stations are within few hundred meters of the building, and have direct line-of-sight. In
reality, however, only few a buildings will fall in that category. However, apart from the
signal level on UMTS, there are other important factors to consider:
64
Indoor Radio Planning

UMTS Soft Handover Load
UMTS service provided from the macro layer might be acceptable seen from the user’s
perspective. In Figure 2.40, three macro cells are providing good indoor coverage, indicated
by the three shades of gray.
The challenge for the UMTS network is the extensive soft handover area; the white area
seen in Figure 2.41. This large soft handover area will increase the load on the network for
UMTS trafﬁc, for the users in the part of the building serviced by more than one cell. But for
HSPA trafﬁc the data throughput wil be degraded caused by C/I (co-channel interference),
because the cells are operating on the same HSDPA frequency.
Degraded HSDPA Performance
The UMTS service will still be acceptable, but the price on the network side is the
large soft handover area for about 60% of the users inside the buildings as HDPA does
not use soft handover, the three serving all HSDPA cells are on the same frequency and
there is a large impact on the C/I. In Table 2.4, you can see an example of a HSDPA
link budget. In order to provide HSDPA service at high conﬁdence level, you need good
isolation between the serving cell and the adjacent cell due to the strict C/I require-
ments.
In the example shown in Figure 2.41, only 20% of the building has a C/I better than 5 dB,
the gray areas. Only in this area will the DL data rate be better than about 500 kbps. In the
major part of the building the data rate will be lower than 480 kbps.

Solution
The only solution for a consistent and high-performing indoor HSPA service is to provide
isolation between the intended serving cell and the interfering HSDPA cells from the outdoor
network. In order to be able to provide HSDPA service at the higher data rate, the only
solution is an indoor DAS system. The challenge is to dominate the building with the indoor
coverage, and at the same time avoid leakage from the indoor DAS system. This can be an
issue, especially in buildings with high signal levels from outdoor macro cells.
A viable solution is to deploy directional antennas at the edge and corners of the building
and point them towards the center of the building. Using this strategy, the total indoor area is

The three macro base stations give full coverage, but a larger portion of the indoor ﬂoor

dominated by the indoor cell as long as you dominate at the border. The reason is that the
indoor signal radiated by both the corner- and edge-mounted antennas and the outdoor cell
will have the same signal path and attenuation from the edge of the building throughout the
whole indoor area. Dominating the border of the building will give total dominance, and will
at the same time minimize leakage into the macro network.
The solution is described in Section 3.5. In order to archive high HSPA data rates, good
isolation between the cells is needed. The challenge with this strategy is the actual
installation of the antennas in the corners of the building. Normally there will be limited
access to cable ducts and installation trays along the perimeter of the building. This is even
more of an issue for traditional passive DAS based on heavy and rigid coax cables. However,
using an active DAS that relies on lightweight, ﬂexible IT-type cabling to reach the antenna
point, the installation of these antennas is less of a challenge.
2.4.7 Passive DAS and HSPA
Traditional passive DAS systems based on coax cables will in many case have too high an
attenuation to provide sufﬁcient HSPA data service inside buildings. Passive DAS can
perform on HSPA provided that the attenuation between the base station and the indoor
antenna is less than 20 dB. In practice, using passive DAS for indoor HSPA solutions is only
possible for smaller buildings that can be covered by six to eight indoor antennas. For larger
buildings the HSPA performance will be compromised due to the high losses of the coax
cables, splitters, tappers and other passive DAS components.
HSDPA on Passive DAS
In Figure 2.42, the HSDPA service range from the indoor DAS antenna in a typical ofﬁce
environment is shown. The graphs represent benchmarking of the HSDPA performance of
passive DAS with 20–30 dB of attenuation between the base station and the DAS antenna.
This is compared with the HSDPA performance of the active DAS from Section 4.4, with
þ20 dBm output power.
The impact from the attenuation of the passive DAS is evident. Only the passive DAS with
20 dB of attenuation performs slightly better than the active DAS owing to the DL power of
the þ43 dBm base station. This makes passive DAS only applicable for HSDPA solutions in
small buildings with less than six to eight antennas. However, the installation challenges
associated with the passive DAS remains. Therefore it will be hard to draw up the correct
antenna layout as shown in Section 3.5. The typical ofﬁce building implemented with
passive DAS and corner-mounted antennas will have losses exceeding 30–35 dB, limiting
the HDSPA service range severely.
HSUPA on Passive DAS
The degrading impact on the HSUPA performance by the attenuation of the passive DAS is
even more evident than the HSDPA degradation. The reason for this can be explained by basic
cascaded noise theory and practice. Any loss prior to the ﬁrst ampliﬁer in the receiver will
degrade the noise ﬁgure of the system, in this case the HSUPA receiver in the base station.

Figure 2.43 clearly shows the impact on the HSUPA performance, caused by the passive
losses. Even a ‘low loss’ passive DAS with ‘only’ 30 dB of attenuation cannot perform at
more than 700 kbps just 12 m from the indoor antenna. The active DAS will perform at about
1 Mbps up to 27 ms from the antenna, at the same location in the same environment.
2.4.8 Conclusion
The active DAS concept for distribution of HSPA signals is shown to be superior for the
provision of high-speed data services. Both for HSDPA and HSUPA, the conclusion is
clear – having the DL ampliﬁer and the UL ampliﬁer as close as possible to the indoor
DAS antenna will boost HSDPA and HSUPA performance to a maximum. The concept is
to use distributed ampliﬁers, and locate them at the antenna points, compensating for the
losses back to the base station. Delivering the DL power at the antenna and minimizing the
UL noise ﬁgure is the best solution. Calculations and real-life measurements and
implementations back up the theory. Chapter 7 covers the noise calculations for this
concept.

Indoor Radio Planning
There are numerous challenges, both from a business and a technical perspective, when
designing and implementing indoor coverage solutions. Indoor radio planners carry a major
responsibility for the overall business case and performance of the network. In many
countries 80% of users are inside buildings, and providing high-performance indoor
coverage, especially on higher data rates, is a challenge. It is much more than a technical
challenge; the business case must also be evaluated, as well as future-prooﬁng of the
solutions implemented, among other considerations. As an indoor radio planner, it is
important not to focus only on the technical challenge ahead, but to look a few steps ahead.
3.1 Why is In-building Coverage Important?
There are many reasons for the mobile operator, both technical and commercial, for
providing sufﬁcient in-building coverage. The technical motivations are typical; lack of
coverage, improvement of service quality, need for more capacity, need for higher data rates
and to ofﬂoad the existing macro network. In 3G (UMTS) networks, the need to ofﬂoad the
existing macro network is an especially important parameter. The need for higher-speed data
rates inside buildings also plays an important factor. It is evident that you will need
dedicated in-building (IB) solutions to provide high-speed data service on UMTS and
especially when deploying HSDPA/HSUPA high-speed data services.
This book will focus mainly on the technical part of the evaluation, and design of IB
solutions. However, even the most hardcore technical RF design engineer must realize that
the main driver for any mobile network operator must be to increase the revenue factor. The
purpose is to maximize the revenue of the network and to lower the production cost of the
trafﬁc. The cost of producing a call minute (CM) is a crucial factor for the mobile operator,
and so is the production cost per Mb of data transmitted in the network.
3.1.1 Commercial and Technical Evaluation
First and foremost, the mobile operator must do a business evaluation, before even considering
investing in any in-building coverage solution. The operator must use standard tools and
Indoor Radio Planning: A Practical Guide for GSM, DCS, UMTS and HSPA
Morten Tolstrup
# 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

metrics to evaluate the business case, in order to be able to calculate the revenue of each
individual user of the different user segments. This will enable the operator to compare the
business case on all the individual indoor coverage projects, in order to prioritize the projects.
This evaluation must be based on a standardized evaluation ﬂow (see Section 5.1.1), using
standard forms templates and metrics in order to secure a valid comparable business case for
each indoor coverage project.
3.1.2 The Main Part of the Mobile Trafﬁc is Indoors
Depending on what part of the world you analyze, it is a fact that the bulk of the trafﬁc
originates inside buildings. Therefore, special attention to the in-building coverage is needed,
in order to fulﬁll the user’s expectations and need for service. This is especially the case in
urban environments, and the focus from the mobile users is on higher and higher data rates.
3.1.3 Some 70–80% of Mobile Trafﬁc is Inside Buildings
In most cities it is very interesting to note that typically a few important buildings (hot-spots)
will produce the major part of the trafﬁc. In some cities more than 50% of the trafﬁc originates
from about 10% of the buildings. These buildings are referred to as the hot-spots. These
buildings will typically be shopping malls, airports and large corporate ofﬁce buildings.
3.1.4 Indoor Solutions Can Make a Great Business Case
Especially for UMTS, the power load per user (PLPU) is an important factor owing to the
fact that downlink power on the base station is directly related to the capacity. The higher the
PLPU, the higher the capacity drain from the base station per mobile user will be. This
results in relative high production costs for indoor trafﬁc on UMTS when trying to service
the users inside buildings, from the outdoor Macro network.
Not only will the coverage, quality and data speed be better on UMTS with dedicated
indoor coverage solutions, but the PLPU will be much lower due to the fact that with an
indoor system the base station will not to have to overcome the high penetration loss of the
building (20–50 dB). In addition, when servicing indoor UMTS users from the macro base
station, the signal will rely mostly on reﬂections in order to service the users, degrading the
orthogonality.
Implementing indoor coverage solutions is a very efﬁcient use of the capacity (DL power)
of the base station, and of the data channel. You can reduce the production cost per call
minute or Mb, using IB coverage solutions and also reduce the overall noise increase in the
network. The production cost per call minute or Mb on UMTS can be cut by 50–70% using
IB coverage solutions.
3.1.5 Business Evaluation
Even the most technical dedicated engineer must appreciate that the main reason for
providing IB solutions is to make a positive business case. The designer of the IB solution
carries a major responsibility, on the one hand, for a well-designed and high-performing
72
Indoor Radio Planning

technical solution, but also a solution that needs to be future-proof, and will make the
investment worthwhile. This is a ﬁne balance between investment and technical parameters.
Engineers are often tempted to overdesign the solutions ‘just to be sure’ – but the cost of
doing this is high.
3.1.6 Coverage Levels/Cost Level
Selecting the correct coverage design level for the indoor design is crucial, for the
performance of the indoor system, the data throughput performance and the leakage from
the building. We will take a closer look at these more technical parameters later on in this
book, but there is more to it than ‘only’ the technical part.
The radio planner must also realize that the design levels come at a cost, and this has a
direct impact on the business case. The higher the coverage level, the higher the cost of the
system, obviously due to the need for more antennas and equipment for the indoor system,
more equipment, more installation work and maintenance costs.
3.1.7 Evaluate the Value of the Proposed Solution
Before considering any indoor coverage solution, you must carefully evaluate the value of
the proposed solution. You will need to answer these questions:
1. Will the investment make a positive business case?
2. When will the investment begin to pay back?
3. Is the selected solution optimum for future needs:
 Higher data rates.
 New services.
 More operators.
 More capacity?
4. Can the selected solution keep up with the future changes in the building:
 Reconstruction.
 Extension?
5. Will the solution ofﬂoad the macro layer, and free needed capacity? This must be part of
the business case for the indoor solution; it is added value if you free up power or capacity
on the outdoor network that can service other users.
6. Are there strategic reasons for providing the IB Coverage Solution:
 Competitive edge over other operators.
 Increased trafﬁc in other parts of the network.
 International roamer value (airports, harbors, ships, ferries, hotels, convention centers)?
7. Can dedicated corporate buildings be covered, in order to secure the business for the
whole account:
 Better coverage.
 Better quality.
 Better capacity.
 Higher data rates.
 More loyalty from the users?

3.2 Indoor Coverage from the Macro Layer
Why not just use the macro coverage to provide the needed indoor coverage? When
designing a cellular network, especially in the ﬁrst phase of rollout, many radio designers
initially try to cover as many buildings from the macro layer as possible. This is despite
knowing that most of the trafﬁc originates from inside buildings.
To some extent, and in certain areas, this strategy makes sense. In many cases you are able
to provide reasonably good overall indoor coverage from the macro base stations, but it is a
ﬁne balance and a compromise.
In a typical suburban environment you need to rely on a very tight macro grid with an
inter-site distance of no more than 1–2 km, depending on the services that are offered. In
urban environments the inter-site distance can be down to 300–500 m to provide the deep
indoor penetration needed for GSM and UMTS. In many cases even this tight a site grid is
not sufﬁcient to provide the higher-data-rate EDGE coverage on GSM, and is not sufﬁcient
for providing higher data rates on UMTS (64–384 kps). On UMTS especially, HSPA will be
a major concern, when covering from the outside network into the buildings.
As you can see from trafﬁc data from many real-life examples like the one shown in
Figure 3.1, even a tight macro grid will in many cases be insufﬁcient to service the indoor
users, and certainly not the data users on the higher data rates in particular, but also even
voice users on GSM and 3G.
3.2.1 More Revenue with Indoor Solutions
This is an example of the trafﬁc production (Figure 3.1), after implementing solid indoor
coverage in a shopping area. This shopping area consists of two major shopping malls, as

well as many small outside shops. Prior to implementing the indoor coverage in the two
shopping malls, the whole area was covered by a tight grid of standard three-sector GSM
macro sites. The macro sites are separated by about 450 m, providing an outdoor coverage
level measured on-street of minimum 65 dBm (GSM900) in most of the area.
However, even this high a coverage level from the macro sites was not enough to service
all the potential trafﬁc in the area, and thus not able to cater for the actual service need. This
is clearly documented by the results shown in Figure 3.1.
Trafﬁc Boost
This example in Figure 3.1 clearly shows that, in the trafﬁc statistics for the total trafﬁc
production for the whole shopping area, there is an instant ‘jump’ in the trafﬁc production
when the indoor coverage system in the two shopping malls is set into service – the trafﬁc
rises 120% instantly.
The total trafﬁc in the area exceeded the existing trafﬁc on the macro (prior to the IB
coverage being implemented) plus the new trafﬁc on the IB solutions. Not only did the
indoor system pick up more trafﬁc, it also boosted the trafﬁc in the neighboring macro-
serviced area, by carrying more trafﬁc into this area due to the increased service level, and
reduced the number of dropped calls to less than 0.5% in the area after the implementation.
The growth rate of the trafﬁc in the area with 100% IB coverage also showed an annual
gain of trafﬁc of about 30%. This is more than double the growth rate in a similar reference
area.
Even High Coverage Level from the Macro was Not Enough
Even with an existing macro coverage level of 65 dBm there had been users that were not
covered, that you could now capture with the indoor solutions. This clearly shows that IB
coverage solutions are important revenue generators for the operators. This is, of course,
provided that the indoor coverage solutions are implemented in the right area, covering the
right buildings, and are designed correctly.
3.2.2 The Problem Reaching Indoor Mobile Users
Why is it a problem for macro sites to cover inside buildings? Let us explore some of the
challenges for the macro coverage penetrating deep inside buildings and providing sufﬁcient
coverage and service level where the users are located.
Urban and Suburban Environments Rely on Reﬂections
In urban and suburban environments macro coverage will typical reach the users by
reﬂection and diffraction – multipath propagation (see Figure 3.2). The delay proﬁle will
typical be 1–2 ms. Only a minor part of the trafﬁc is serviced by the direct signal in line-of-
sight to the base station antenna, having only the free space loss plus penetration loss of the
building (as shown in Figure 3.2).
Indoor Radio Planning
75

In most or all cases the resulting signal at the receiver will be a result of the multipath
radio channel – a ‘mix’ of different signals with different delays, amplitudes and phases. The
result is a multipath fading signal (as shown in Figure 3.3), with a fading pattern that mainly
depends on the environment and the speed of the mobile. Surprisingly, very often a building
with a macro site on the roof can have coverage problems at the core of the same building,
especially on the lower ﬂoors of the building and near the core.
This peculiar problem occurs due to the fact that coverage inside the building relies on
reﬂections from adjacent buildings. On the topmost ﬂoors the coverage might be perfect, but
the further down, problems starts to occur. Starting with lack of coverage in the staircase and
in the elevators, in many cases the inner core of the building might have performance
problems, especially with data service.

Indoor Radio Planning

If a building with the rooftop macro has no, or only low, adjacent buildings, this problem
can be a major issue, due to the lack of buildings to reﬂect the signal back into the servicing
building. However the problem can be easily solved by deploying a small indoor solution,
ﬁlling in the black spot. See Section 4.6.3 for details.
The Mobile Will Handle Multipath Signals
If the reﬂections are shorter than about 16 ms, the equalizer in the GSM mobile will to some
extent cancel the reﬂection (if longer, it will impact the quality as co-channel interference).
The rake receiver on UMTS will, if the reﬂections are offset more than one chip duration
(0.26 ms), recover and phase-align the different signal paths and ‘reconstruct’ the signal to
some extent, by the use of the rake receiver and maximum ratio combining; see Section 2.3.6
for more details.
3.3 The Indoor UMTS/HSPA Challenge
When providing radio coverage for mobile users inside buildings, you are facing several
radio planning challenges. It is mainly these challenges that motivate the need for indoor
coverage solutions. Radio planners with indoor GSM planning experience need to be very
careful not to apply all the radio planning strategy gained on GSM when designing indoor
UMTS/HSPA solutions. If you are not careful, you will make some expensive mistakes and
compromise high-speed data performance, as well as the business case for these indoor
solutions.
3.3.1 UMTS Orthogonality Degradation
The UMTS RF channel efﬁciency is sensitive to degradation of the ‘RF environment’,
typically caused by multipath reﬂections. Without going into mathematical details, the
efﬁciency of the UMTS RF-channel is expressed using the term ‘orthogonality’. The
higher the orthogonality of the radio channel is, the higher the efﬁciency of the radio
link is.
The Data Efﬁciency on the UMTS Channel
The same 5 MHz (3.84 Mcps) UMTS RF channel can in some cases carry high data rates, in
excess of 2 Mbps, provided that the users are in line-of-sight to the serving cell, and only if a
minor portion of the signal is reﬂected energy. This is the typical indoor scenario, with a
dedicated indoor coverage solution. In that case the orthogonality can be as high as 0.85–
0.90, so the channel is very efﬁcient in carrying high-speed data efﬁciently (as shown in
Figure 3.4).
However when covering UMTS indoor user from the macro layer in an urban or suburban
environment, the RF channel relies on many reﬂections, diffractions and phase shifts – a
multipath channel. This will degrade the efﬁciency of the radio channel, and under these
circumstances the orthogonality can be as low as 0.55.
Indoor Radio Planning
77

Degraded Orthogonality, Higher Costs for the Operator
The degradation of the orthogonality when servicing indoor users from the macro layer is a
major concern for the mobile operators. This concern is due to the degraded efﬁciency of the
channel, resulting in a lower data throughput. In practice a particular UMTS base station will
be able to serve line-of-sight users with high data throughput, whereas indoor users served
by the same base station will only be serviced at lower data rates, due to the degraded
orthogonality.
The orthogonality is directly related to the production cost per Mb, and thus directly related
to the business case of the operator. In addition to the less efﬁcient radio channel, there are
other negative effects, including higher power load per user due to the high penetration loss
into the buildings. We will elaborate more on these effects later in this chapter.
Degraded Indoor HSDPA/HSUPA Service from the Macro Layer
The modulation on HSPA service is very sensitive to interference and degradation of the
radio channel. HSDPA and HSUPA need a high-performing RF link, in order to support the
highest possible data rates. In reality this means that HSDPA/HSUPA will only be served in
the buildings in direct line-of-sight to the serving macro, and only in the part of the building
facing the nearby macro site. To provide coherent and high-performing indoor HSPA
coverage, dedicated indoor coverage solutions are needed.
The Macro Layer on 3G Will Take a Major Impact from Indoor Trafﬁc
As just described, the orthogonality is degraded when servicing indoor users from the
outdoor macro base stations. This is mainly due to the reﬂections and diffractions and phase
shifts of the signals from the clutter in the area, buildings, etc.

Indoor Radio Planning

More than Orthogonality Degradation
In addition to degraded orthogonality, there are several additional degrading factors to take
into account, in order to evaluate the impact on the macro layer from users inside buildings
(as shown in Figure 3.5).
The link loss increases with the distance from the base station, the free space loss and the
additional penetration loss into the building. The penetration loss depends on the wall type,
thickness and material. Typical penetration losses of the outer wall of a building can vary
from 15 to 50 dB or more, depending on the type and the frequency.
In addition to the penetration and free space loss from the base station, the clutter inside
the building will also add to the attenuation of the RF link. This is especially true for the
users at the core deep inside the building and those on the side of the building opposite the
servicing macro base station. These indoor users will have a relative high link loss, and
demand a high power resource on the base station.
In order to maintain the downlink, the base station has to assign more power to these high-
loss users inside the building. These mobiles will also need to power up their transmit power,
in order to maintain the uplink.
3.3.2 Power Load per User
The end result is a high power load per user for users with high link losses inside buildings.
It is a fact that the capacity resources of the UMTS base station are directly related to the
power resource. The higher the PLPU is, the higher the power drain off the base station and
Figure 3.5
The degradation of the UMTS channel, and power load when servicing indoor users from
the macro layer
Indoor Radio Planning
79

the higher the capacity drain off the base station will be per indoor user. This high power
drain per indoor user has a big impact on the remaining power (capacity) pool of the base
station, needed to service other users. This directly relates to the business case.
3.3.3 Interference Control in the Building
To add even more complexity to the matter, the higher up a building the users are, the more
likely it is that they will receive nonintended distant base stations (pilot pollution). This is
especially a concern in high-rise buildings in the topmost ﬂoors that rise over the clutter of
other buildings in the area (see Section 3.5.3) This is particular problem for those users that
are close to windows, opposite to the side of the building of the serving base station. These
users will be able to detect pilot signals from distant base stations. This pilot pollution will
degrade the quality; the Eb/No of the UMTS signal. For GSM the Rx-Qual (bit error rate)
will be degraded, and this might result in dropped calls even though the signal level is
relatively high. UMTS macro cells close to the building must always be in the neighbor list
(monitored set) as soft handover will be active whenever the pilot signals from outside the
building are high, in order to prevent pilot pollution and dropped calls. However, soft
handover will also pose a potential problem; when the mobile inside the building enters soft
handover, more links are used to maintain the same call, so all the degraded orthogonality
and power load will in reality hit even more outdoor base stations, draining even more
resources from the macro network. HSDPA planning mandates special attention to this
problem, as all cells are on the same frequency and interference from other cells will degrade
the HSDPA data rate.
3.3.4 The Soft Handover Load
As we know, all serving cells in UMTS are on the same frequency, only separated by codes.
Therefore UMTS has to use soft handover (SHO), as shown in Figure 3.6; this is the only
way to shift the calls smoothly when the user roams from one cell to another. Soft handover
is a main feature of UMTS, securing the trafﬁc transition between the cells, but it comes at a
cost. During soft handover the mobile takes up resources on all the cells engaged in soft
handover. Typically, with two to three cells, one mobile in soft handover will load the
network with a factor of 2–3. However, one must distinguish between softer handover, which
occurs within the cells on the same site, and soft handover between cells on different sites.
The latter takes more resources due to the need for double backhaul to the RNC/RNCs, see
Section 2.3.4 for more details.
3.3.5 UMTS/HSPA Indoor Coverage Conclusion
From the topics just covered, it is clear that it is very costly to cover indoor UMTS users
from macro base stations because of the impact of power drain of the macro layer, the
degraded RF channel due to low orthogonality, the pilot pollution in high-rise buildings and
the load increase due to soft handover (lack of dominance) when more macro cells are
servicing users inside a building.
80
Indoor Radio Planning

Even Perfect Indoor Coverage from UMTS Macro Sites can be a Problem
In the example in Figure 3.6 there are three surrounding macro sites providing good, deep
indoor coverage. These sites are close to the building, and the signal level throughout the
building is perfect.
Therefore all users inside the building are serviced with high RF quality and high-speed
data service. However, the users are covered by three different macro cells with a
considerable overlap. This is a big concern; the major part of the trafﬁc inside this building
will permanently be in soft handover.
In this example one mobile in the soft handover zone will be in simultaneous communica-
tion with all three cells. Therefore the same transmission will load three cells, and also put a
factor 3 load on the backhaul network. This has a big impact on the outside network, due to
the capacity load, increasing the production cost of the trafﬁc for mobiles in the SHO area.
The probability of soft handover decreases when the margin between the serving cell and
the other cells in the monitored set/neighbor list increases. As a guideline, one needs a
margin of about 10–15 dB to avoid soft handovers – that gives room for fading.
Trafﬁc inside buildings comes at a high cost when serviced from the macro base stations.
This might be a minor problem if this is a building with only few users, then the impact on
the surrounding macro network will be marginal. In the case of hot-spot buildings with high
trafﬁc density, like a shopping mall, a big corporate building or an airport, the impact on the
Figure 3.6
Three UMTS cells from the macro layer provide excellent indoor service, but most of the
building is in soft handover
Indoor Radio Planning
81

macro network will be severe. It is important to dedicate an indoor coverage solution for
these types of buildings, to secure a dedicated dominant indoor signal, with enough capacity
to accommodate the trafﬁc.
Cover the Hot-spot Buildings from the Inside, from Day One
The effects that occur when you try to cover indoor users from the outside are really
important to keep in mind; the fact is that only a few hot-spot buildings in a city can overload
the macro network. The users inside the building might have perfect service, but the fact is
that the macro base stations might not have any resources left to maintain service to other
users outside these hot-spots buildings.
This might not be evident in a UMTS macro network with only a minor load of trafﬁc, like
in the roll-out phase of the UMTS network. However it might become serious when the
trafﬁc increases in the network. Then it might be too late, and if you wait to address
the UMTS indoor coverage issue until then, you will compromise the user perception of the
UMTS service and the network quality. Users might turn to other operators and the business
case for the network will have been compromised. Yes, the radio planner has a direct impact
in the business case for the network; it is a big responsibility, one that is not to be
underestimated.
3.4 Common UMTS Rollout Mistakes
It is very tempting to place a nearby macro site close to one of these hot-spot buildings,
especially when coming from a GSM radio planning background. Often the result is that the
side of the building facing the macro site will have really high signal level. However,
eventually there might still be some areas on the far side and in the basement that still have
an insufﬁcient coverage level.
3.4.1 The Macro Mistake
The classic example is a shopping mall; these are usually important hot-spot buildings with
many users, and therefore on the top of the list when prioritizing the roll-out plan. A macro
site just across the street from the shopping mall could be a perfect solution, or is it?
Typically the operator will realize that sufﬁcient indoor coverage is still lacking in large
areas inside the building, especially for HSPA data service.
The capacity needed inside the building might also exceed the resources on the macro site,
mainly due to the high power load per user inside the building. Then the operator realizes
that the next step is an indoor UMTS solution.
3.4.2 Do Not Apply GSM Strategies
Trying to cover a shopping mall from the outdoor macro mast is tempting, but this is the
GSM experience that kicks in; this is how the GSM network has been and is still being
planned. However, this mindset is expensive to use for UMTS radio planning, because after
implementing the indoor UMTS system in the building, the operator will now realize that
82
Indoor Radio Planning

about 60–80% of the trafﬁc inside the building is in soft handover, due to the high signal
coming into the building from the nearby macro site, causing a lack of dominance. This will
also severely degrade the HDSPA performance in the building due to high interference
between the cells. This problem can easily be solved on GSM, by using different
frequencies, but UMTS uses the same frequency on all cells. You might be tempted to
assign a dedicated channel for the indoor UMTS solution, but once again this is GSM
planning, because by doing so you have used a huge part of your capacity. Typically you
have only two or three UMTS channels in total: one assigned for UMTS, one for HSPA and
if you have a third channel assigned to the indoor solution, there is no way to utilize this
channel for future capacity needs.
The best solution will then be redirecting or removing the sector of the macro that
covers the shopping mall. However, often this sector will also service other smaller
buildings and areas that cannot be serviced without this sector. Often the only valid
solution is to remove the sector and deploy a smaller site in the new problem area outside
the shopping mall.
3.4.3 The Correct Way to Plan UMTS/HSPA Indoor Coverage
The correct way to do UMTS indoor and macro planning, is to plan the UMTS network
‘from the inside out’ not from the outside in. This is especially important in the high-
capacity areas, that is, areas with hot-spot buildings. Operators doing UMTS roll-out need to
realize that a portion of the roll-out cost should be reserved for indoor coverage in the most
important high-trafﬁc buildings. Deploying indoor systems in these hot spot buildings will
save a lot of cost, grief and hassle in the long run.
This will for sure be the most economical strategy, providing better data service with
higher data rates and higher quality in the network.
UMTS networks should be planed, from the inside out.
Better Business Case with Indoor UMTS Solutions
It is a fact that the production cost when servicing the users inside the hot-spot buildings
from the macro base stations is very high, even if the service inside the hot-spot buildings
seems to be perfect. This is due to the less efﬁcient RF link from the macro base station,
mainly due to the high power drain per user that uses up the capacity of the UMTS base
station.
Depending on the scenario, a cost reduction of up to 65% can be achieved by covering the
UMTS users from inside the building with indoor coverage systems, rather than using nearby
macro base stations to provide solid indoor coverage.
It is not realistic to cover every building from the inside, but the hot-spot buildings at least
must be considered from the ﬁrst roll-out plan. These buildings will have a big impact on the
macro layer. If you cater for them, the macro layer can use their power resources to service
all the other buildings and areas, and the revenue in the network will be boosted.
Most operators do a roll-out plan for their macro network three to ﬁve years in advance;
the most important buildings should be a part of that plan, and this will give the best
performance and the best business case.

3.5 The Basics of Indoor RF Planning
No matter what the radio service, whether it is GSM, UMTS, HSPA or other technologies,
there are some basic design guidelines one must apply in order to design a high-performing
indoor coverage solution.
3.5.1 Isolation is the Key
If you must select one parameter and one parameter only that truly deﬁnes the most
important success parameter when designing an IB solution, it must clearly be the
‘isolation’. Isolation is deﬁned as the difference between the IB signal and the outdoor
network, and vice versa.
Users in ofﬁce buildings are typically close to the windows; therefore the dominance of
the indoor system must be maintained throughout the building, even right next to the
windows.
3.5.2 Tinted Windows Will Help Isolation
Modern energy-efﬁcient windows with a layer of thin metallic coating will attenuate the
macro signal servicing the building. This type of window will attenuate the RF signal from
the outdoor network, and create a need for a dedicated indoor solution.
The positive side effect of this ‘problem’ is that, once the indoor system is installed, these
metallic-coated windows will actually help the design, giving us good isolation. These types
of windows with a thin layer of metallic coating will typically attenuate the signal by 20–
40 dB, depending on the radio frequency, and the incident angle of the radio signal.
Recently new types of windows are being used, or ﬁlm applied to existing windows in high-
proﬁle ofﬁce buildings. These buildings are being ﬁtted with ‘Wi-Fi-proof glass’. This prevents
hackers with laptops outside the building camping on the Wi-Fi service from within the
building. This type of window or ﬁlm attenuates the radio signal even more, by up to 50–70 dB.
This will actually help in producing a good indoor radio design: these windows, together
with the aluminum-coated facade that is typical for many modern corporate buildings, are
relatively easy to plan, with regards to isolation (until someone opens a window. . .). With
40–70 dB of isolation, even a nearby macro site will be shielded efﬁciently, and you can rely
on omni antenna distribution inside the building, as shown in the example in Figure 3.7,
without leakage from the building to the outside network. This makes the ‘handover zone’
easy to design really close to the building, so that the indoor system does not service outside
users or leak interference outside the building.
3.5.3 The ‘High-rise Problem’
In some high buildings, typically older buildings with normal windows (no metallic coating),
you can experience very high interference levels from the outside macro network; even
strong signals from distant macro bases will reach indoor users at surprisingly high signal
levels. This is mainly due to the low (or no) attenuation from the windows, providing only
limited or no isolation between macro base stations and the area inside the building along the
84
Indoor Radio Planning

windows. Despite these physical factors, you need to insure isolation from the high-level
outdoor signal and dominance of the indoor coverage system throughout the building; you
need to carefully consider the strategy for designing and implementing the indoor coverage
solution.
The traditional approach would be to deploy omni antennas in the walkways near the core
of the building (like in Figure 3.7), but this can cause an unwanted side effect. These
‘central’ omni antennas must radiate high RF levels, in order to overcome the high signal
from the nearby macro base stations, and make the indoor cell also dominant along the
windows of the building.
The unwanted side effect of this strategy is that the high power from the indoor system
will leak high levels of signal from the indoor cell into the macro network, increasing the
noise, and degrading the quality and capacity in the outside macro network.
Solution to the ‘High-rise Problem’
The solution is to make the indoor cell the dominating cell throughout the building. The
indoor cell needs to dominate the total area from along the windows and all the way into the
center of the building, without leaking signal out to the outdoor network. You can achieve
this by deploying directional antennas along the border of the building, and direct them to
the center of the building (Figure 3.8).
This design will insure that the indoor signal is stronger than the outdoor signal, even
with very high signals from the nearby macro base station. This is due to the proximity and
line-of-sight of the user to the nearby serving indoor antenna. Thus the indoor cell is
Figure 3.7
A well-designed indoor solution will be dominant throughout the building, but not leak
access signal to the surrounding network
Indoor Radio Planning
85

dominant at the border of the building, and when the antennas are pointing inwards to the
center of the building, the indoor cell will be dominant throughout the indoor area. This due
to the fact that both the outdoor signal and the indoor signal are penetrating the same indoor
signal path, so the isolation between the outdoor and indoor signal will ‘track’ into the center
of the building.
Plan for Perfect Isolation
Exactly how efﬁcient the ‘corner antenna’ strategy is, is shown in the simulation in
Figure 3.9. The graph shows how efﬁcient the solution can be when you use the approach
of directional antennas pointing inward to the center of the building.
This is a simulation, with the indoor directional antennas mounted suspended in free
space, having only the front-to-back isolation of the antenna, 8 dB. In a real-life installation,
the antennas will be mounted on a corner pylon or on the outer wall, above the window, so
the front-to-back isolation ratio will be 5–20 dB better. In either case it is clear that this is a
very efﬁcient way to provide indoor dominance, even in buildings with little penetration loss,
and even in buildings with high signals from the outdoor network.
Installation is a Challenge
Placing antennas in the corners pointing towards the center of the building as shown in
Figure 3.8 might be a perfect radio planning solution to the ‘high-rise problem’, but one
Figure 3.8
The topmost ﬂoors in a high-rise building pose speciﬁc challenges to isolation due to
powerful macro signals. The key is dominate at the border of the building perimeter, in this example
using directional antennas mounted in the corners pointing towards the center of the building
86
Indoor Radio Planning

practical challenge remains: installing the antennas at this location can be an issue. In
particular, the installation of cables reaching these ‘perimeter’ antennas can be a problem,
especially when using passive distributed antenna systems that rely on rigid passive cables. It
can be difﬁcult to ﬁnd an appropriate cable route, and end up with an expensive installation,
but using active distributed antenna systems, relying on thin cable infrastructure, is a
possible solution to the problem (see Section 4.4.2).
What Level of Isolation is Needed?
You know now that the main parameter when doing indoor radio planning is isolation of the
macro layer, but how much isolation do you need in reality?
GSM
The GSM system will be less restricted in terms of the isolation issue, due to the fact that
different frequencies are assigned for the indoor and outdoor cells. However, isolation is still
important, especially when planning indoor solutions in high-rise buildings in high-capacity
macro networks. This is the typical example in cities; in these areas you have to deal with the
fact that the indoor frequencies might be in use even by nearby macro sites. When planning
GSM voice, the co-channel isolation must be more than 11 dB in order to secure the
quality – well, this is the theory, but in reality it depends very much on the actual fading
environment, so it is advisable to add a margin of 6–10 dB. When planning for GSM data,
EDGE MCS-6, you will need a co-channel isolation of more than 17 dB plus a margin! You
must plan for a very good signal quality inside the building; refer to Chapter 8 for more
details on EDGE planning levels.
Also for GSM, dominance is a concern in order to ease the optimization, and to avoid
‘ping-pong handovers’ where users toggle between the outdoor and the indoor cell. Even

87

with perfect Rx-Qual the user perceived quality during the ‘ping pong’ handover is
degraded. This is due to the ‘bit stealing’ of the trafﬁc channel in order to perform fast
signaling for the GSM handover. This often results in bursts of ‘clicks’ on the audio on the
call, degrading the voice quality.
UMTS/HSPA
As you know, on UMTS all users are using the same RF channel, and in order to maintain the
link when two or more serving cells are at the same signal level, the mobile enters soft
handover, loading more than one link and taking up resources on several network elements
and interfaces. If there is no dominant indoor coverage system, then typically two or three
base stations will service a user inside an urban building. Even implementing indoor
solutions you need to make sure that the mobiles inside the building will only be served by
the indoor base station.
You must make sure that this base station is dominant throughout the building; the less
dominance, the higher probability there is of soft handover. As a general guideline, you
should make the indoor cell 10–15 dB more powerful inside the building than any outside
macro signal. However this is a ﬁne balance; you must design the indoor solution in order to
make sure that the indoor system does not leak too much signal outside the building, thus
‘pushing’ the soft handover zone outside the building.
Luckily modern building design will help us, with aluminum-coated exterior walls,
metallic-coated windows, etc. In some cases buildings are being installed with ‘WLAN-
proof windows’ in order to protect the IT system within the building from hackers outside,
trying to lock in on the WiFi signal. Attenuation of more than 50 dB is in many cases a fact.
However, ﬁrst of all you need to apply really good radio planning when designing indoor
UMTS coverage systems. Use corner-mounted antennas to overcome the high-rise problem
and generally distribute more antennas inside the building, radiating lower power, to achieve
a good uniform signal level. You must deﬁnitely avoid ‘hot’ antennas, i.e. few antennas
radiating very high power (In access of 25–30 dBm) to cover large indoor areas. These ‘hot’
antennas will often cause more problems than solutions, mainly due to leakage from the
building into the nearby macro network, raising the noise load on nearby base stations and
degrading the capacity.
3.5.4 Radio Service Quality
The performance of any radio link, GSM, UMTS and HSPA included, is not related to the
absolute signal level but rather to the quality of the signal. This is described as the signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR), and the bigger the ratio between the desired signal – the signal from the
serving indoor cell – and the noise – the unwanted signals from the macro layer – the better
performance the link will have, and the higher is the data rates that can be carried on the
radio link.
The good radio designer, doing indoor coverage solutions, will make an effort to make
sure the design is maximized to have the best possible isolation from the outside network.
Leaving some areas of the building in service from the macro sites is tempting, in the areas
where the macro coverage is strong. However, this temptation should be avoided if possible;
the result on 3G will be large areas of soft handover, large areas with degraded HSPA
performance.
88
Indoor Radio Planning

3.5.5 Indoor RF Design Levels
Frequently operators use only one design level for indoor coverage and one level only.
However, as you know, the quality and data throughput of the radio signal is dependent on
the SNR, not the absolute signal level. How does this impact the radio planning design for
indoor systems?
As you know, isolation plays a major role in the performance of the indoor system.
Therefore the actual design level for the signal from the indoor system must be adapted to
the particular building, the existing macro coverage inside the building and the isolation of
the building. Using more than one design level in the indoor design procedure will also help
assure the business case. It is very expensive to provide too high a coverage level in areas of
the building where it is not needed.
3.5.6 The Zone Planning Concept
The advice is not to focus on the absolute signal level, and not to use only one planning
level. The planning level must be adapted to the project at hand. In practice you might need
to use two or three different planning levels in the same building, depending on the
‘baseline’ of the existing coverage from the surrounding macro sites. An example to describe
the need for adaptation of the design level is evident if you look at the typical high-rise
building in Figure 3.10.
Zone C 
Zone B 
Zone A 
Figure 3.10
Owing to different levels of interference inside the building, it is wise to adjust design
levels accordingly, dividing the building into different zones, each zone having individual design
levels; this can save cost and maintain RF performance
Indoor Radio Planning
89

Divide the Building into Different Planning Zones
For a high-rise building like the example in Figure 3.10 you can typically divide the building
into three different planning zones, each zone having special considerations and design
requirements.
Zone A: Coverage Limited Area
The isolation to the outside network in this part of the building is really good, which is
no surprise this part of the building is sub-ground level. Typical isolation is better than
70–80 dB and the design level for the indoor cell can be relative low, because you do not
need to account for macro interference affecting the performance.
The coverage level for the indoor cell and the noise ﬂoor of the indoor cell itself are the
main driving factors. One part of Zone A that needs careful consideration is the entrance and
exit of the building, if Zone A contains an underground parking area. You need to insure
sufﬁcient handover level, and allow time for the users entering and exiting the building.
Typical design levels for zone-A are:
 85 dBm for GSM BCCH level.
 90 dBm CPICH level for UMTS.
Zone B: Coverage and Interference Limited Area
This midsection of the building is often served by the nearby macro cells. The building is to
some extent isolated from the interference coming from distant macro sites, by the
neighboring buildings. When planning indoor coverage for zone B, you need to overcome
relative low interference coming from distant macro sites, and to insure that the indoor cell
will be the dominant server, overpowering the coverage from the macro cells that currently
cover this area. Typically a medium signal level is needed, to provide sufﬁcient dominance/
isolation in order to avoid ‘ping-pong’ handovers (GSM) and to limit the soft handover zones
(UMTS).
You must be careful with leakage from zone B, and make sure that the indoor DAS system
does not service outdoor users near the building, pedestrians or nearby cars. Typical design
levels for zone-B are:
 70 dBm for GSM BCCH level.
 80 dBm CPICH level for UMTS.
Zone C: Interference Limited Area
The topmost part of the high-rise building is typically above the local clutter of neighboring
buildings. Users along the perimeter of the building at the windows will have clear line-of-
sight to many distant macro sites. These distant base stations will cause co-channel
interference and all the usual high-rise problems. In order to overcome the raised noise
ﬂoor and pilot pollution due to the unwanted signals from all the distant macro sites, you
need a high planning level.
Interference and pilot pollution can come from even very distant macro sites, up to
10–20 km away, and therefore these cells will be impossible to frequency/code plan inside
the building. The interference has a side effect; with no indoor system the mobiles will

typical run on a relative high uplink power, to overcome uplink interference on the base
station, especially when camping on distant, unintended servers. This will generate noise
increase on the macro network and on the indoor cell, degrading the capacity and data
service on UMTS/HSPA, and degrading quality on the macro base station. The high transmit
power from the mobile will also expose the indoor user to higher levels of radiation.
Typically the users will experience high signal level in the display of the mobile, but suffer
degraded service, bad voice quality, reduced data service, dropped calls or even totally lack
of service, due to the high interference level. Typical design levels for zone C are:
 60 dBm for GSM BCCH level.
 70 dBm CPICH level for UMTS.
Be Careful with Leakage from Zone C
However in extreme cases you will need to plan for even higher signal levels from the indoor
system. Always be careful when radio planning in zone C and be sure not to leak out
excessive power from the building, due to the high indoor design levels. Use corner-mounted
antennas facing towards the core of the building, and use many low to medium power
antennas uniformly distributed throughout zone C. Do not be tempted to crank up the
radiated power in excess of 15–20 dBm in zone C, this might cause excessive leakage into
the macro network, degrading performance and capacity.
Beyond Zone C
For very high buildings, there is actually a zone D. In this zone the interference from the
outdoor network starts to decrease. However, you still need to be careful about leakage from
the building from Zone D.

Distributed Antenna Systems
The lesson learned from Section 3.5 is clear; you need to distribute a uniform dominant
signal inside the building, from the indoor cell, using indoor antennas in order to provide
sufﬁcient coverage and dominance. In order to do so you must split the signal from the
indoor base station to several antennas throughout the inside of the building.
Ideally these antenna points should operate roughly at the same power level, and have the
same loss/noise ﬁgure on the uplink to the serving base station. The motivation for
the uniformly distributed coverage level for all antennas in the building is the fact that all
the antennas will operate on the same cell, controlled by the same parameter setting. In
practice passive DAS will often not provide a uniform design to all antennas; you might have
one antenna with 10 dB loss from the base station, and in the same cell an antenna with
45 dB loss back to the base station, and the actual parameter setting for handover control etc.
on the base station might not be able to cater for both scenarios. Therefore uniform
performance throughout the distributed antenna system is a key parameter in order to
optimize the performance of the indoor coverage system.
4.1 What Type of Distributed Antenna System is Best?
There are many different approaches to how you can design an indoor coverage system with
uniformly distributed coverage level; passive distribution, active distribution, hybrid solutions,
repeaters or even distributed Pico cells in the building. Each of these approaches have their
pros and cons, all depending on the project at hand. One design approach could be perfect for
one project, but a very bad choice for the next project – it all depends on the building, and the
design requirements for the current project, and the future needs in the building.
Seen purely from a radio planning perceptive you should ideally select the system that can
give the most downlink power at the antenna points and the least noise load and loss on the
uplink of the base station, and at the same time provide uniform coverage and good isolation to
the macro network. On top of the radio planning requirement, other parameters like installation
time and costs, surveillance and upgradeability play a signiﬁcant role. In practice the service
requirements and the link budget (see Section 8.1.3) will dictate how much loss and noise you
can afford and still accommodate the service level inside the building you are designing for.

4.1.1 Passive or Active DAS
Traditionally passive distributed antenna systems have been used extensively for GSM in the
past 15 years. Therefore naturally many radio planners will see this as the ﬁrst choice when
designing indoor coverage for 3G systems. However, it is a fact that, for UMTS and
especially for HSPA, active distributed antenna systems will often give the best radio link
performance and higher data rates. The main degrading effect from the passive systems is
the high losses, degrading the power level at the antenna points and increasing the base
station noise ﬁgure on the higher frequencies used for UMTS/HSPA. UMTS and HSPA can
perform really high-speed data transmission, but only if the radio link quality is sufﬁcient,
and passive systems will to a large extent compromise the performance; see Section 7.2 for
more details on NF increase due to passive loss.
Another big concern with passive distributed antenna systems is the lack of supervision. If
a cable is disconnected the base station will not generate any voltage standing wave radio
(VSWR) alarm, due to the high return loss through the passive distributed antenna system.
Distributed indoor antenna systems are implemented in the most important buildings,
serving the most important users, generating revenue in our network. Surely you would
prefer to have surveillance of any problems in the DAS system.
On the other hand, passive systems are relatively easy to design; and components and
cables are rigid and solid, if installed correctly. Passive distribution systems can be installed
in really harsh environments, damp and dusty production facilities, tunnels, etc., places
where active components will easily fail if not shielded from the harsh environment. Passive
distribution systems can be designed so they perform at high data rates, even for indoor
HSPA solutions – but only for relative small buildings, projects where you can design the
passive distributions system with a low loss.
4.1.2 Learn to Use all the Indoor Tools
It is important that the radio designer knows the basics of all the various types of indoor
coverage distribution solutions. In many projects the best solution will be a combination of
the various types of distribution hardware. Good indoor radio planning is all about having a
well-equipped toolbox; if you have more tools in your toolbox, it is easier to do the optimum
design for the indoor solution. Having only a hammer might solve many problems, but only
having a hammer in you toolkit will limit your possibilities. If you only know about passive
distribution, learn about the possibilities and limitations of active distribution, repeaters and
Pico cells. This will help you design high-performing indoor coverage distribution systems
that are future-proof and can make a solid business case. After all that’s why you are here –
to generate revenue in the network.
4.1.3 Combine the Tools
Indoor radio planning is not about using one approach only. Learn the pros and cons of all
the various ways of designing indoor coverage, and then you will know what is the best
approach for the design at hand. Often the best approach will be a combination of the
different solution types.

Indoor Radio Planning

4.2 Passive Components
Before you start exploring the design of passive distributed antenna systems, you need to
have a good understanding of the function and usage of the most common type of passive
components used when designing indoor passive distributed antenna systems.
4.2.1 General
Inside buildings you must fulﬁll the internal guidelines and codex that apply for the speciﬁc
building. In general you will be required to use ﬁre-retardant CFC-free cables and
components.
Be very aware of how to minimize any PIM (passive intermodulation) problems. Also be
sure that the components used fulﬁll the required speciﬁcation, especially when designing
high-power passive distributed antenna systems. The effect of combining many high-power
carriers on the same passive distributed antenna system using high-power base stations will
produce a high-power density in the splitters and components close to the base stations. Use
only quality passive components that can meet the PIM and power requirements, 130 dBc or
better speciﬁed components (see Section 5.7.4).
4.2.2 Coax Cable
Obviously coax cable is widely used in all types of distributed antenna systems, especially in
passive systems. Therefore it is important to get the basis right with regards to cable types,
and losses. Table 4.1 shows the typical losses for the commonly used types of passive coaxial
cables. For accurate data refer to the speciﬁc datasheet for the speciﬁc cable from the
supplier you use. Often there will be a distance marker printed on the cable every 50 cm or
1 m, making it easy to check the installed cable distances.
Calculating the Distance Loss of the Passive Cable
It is very easy to calculate the total loss of the passive coaxial cable at a given frequency.

2 inch coax on 1800 MHz, according to
Table 4.1:
total loss ¼ distance ðmÞ  attenuation per meter
total loss ¼ 67 m  0:1 dB=m ¼ 6:7 dB
Reduce the Project Cost When Selecting Cable
The main expense implementing passive indoor systems is not the cable cost, but rather the
price for installing the cable. Installing heavy rigid passive cable can be a major challenge in
a building. In particular, the heavier types of cable from size 7
8 inch and up are a major
challenge. These heavy cables literally take whole teams of installers; after all the cable is
heavy, and a challenge to install without dividing the cable into shorter sections.
Carefully consider the price of installing the cable against the performance. You might be
alright with 2 dB extra cable loss, if you can save 50% of the installation costs by just
selecting a cable size thinner. On the other hand, do be sure that the distribution system will
be able to accommodate the higher frequencies and data speeds on 3G and HSPA.
4.2.3 Splitters
Splitters and power dividers are the most commonly used passive components in
distributed antenna systems, dividing the signal to or from more antennas. Splitters (as
shown in Figure 4.1) are used for splitting one coax line into two or more lines, and vice
versa. When splitting the signal, the power is divided among the ports. If splitting to two
ports, only half-power minus the insertion loss, typically about 0.1 dB, is available at the
two ports. It is very important to terminate all ports on the splitter; do not leave one port
open. If it is unused, terminate it with a dummy load.
Example
You can calculate the loss through the splitter:
splitter loss ¼ 10 log ðno: of portsÞ þ insertion loss
For a 1:3 splitter (as shown in Figure 4.2), the attenuation will be:
10 log ð3Þ þ 0:1 dB ¼ 4:87 dB
1:2
1
1:3

Figure 4.1

96
Indoor Radio Planning

In this example, when we feed a 1:3 splitter 10 dBm power on port 1, the output power on
ports 2–4 will be 10  4:87 ¼ 5:18 dBm.
4.2.4 Taps/Uneven Splitters
Tap splitters (as shown in Figure 4.3) are used like splitters, used to divide the signal/power
from one into two lines. The difference from the standard 1:2 splitter is that the power is not
equally divided among the ports.
This is very useful for designs where you install one heavy main cable through the
building, and then ‘tap’ small portions of the power to antennas along the main cable. By
doing so, you reduce the need to install many parallel heavy cables, and still keep the loss
low.
This is an application that is commonly used in high-rise buildings, where you install a
heavy ‘vertical’ cable and tap off power to the individual ﬂoors (as shown in Figure 4.14).
By adjusting the coupling loss on the different tappers by selecting the appropriate value,
you can actually balance out the loss to all the ﬂoors in the high-rise building, providing the
required uniform coverage level.
Taps come in various types, the principle being that there is a low-loss port (1–2) and then
a higher-loss port (3), where you ‘tap’ power of to a local antenna/cluster of antennas. In a
high-rise building, you install one vertical heavy 7
8 or 11
4 inch cable in the vertical cable riser,
and then use tappers on each ﬂoor to feed a splitter that divides out to two to four antennas
fed with 1
2 inch coax. Standard tappers are available with the values shown in Table 4.2.
Example of Use
In this example (as shown in Figure 4.4), we can see that, even over long distances (200 m at
GSM1800), using a 7
8 inch main cable, and different types of tappers and a splitter, we can

keep a relative constant attenuation of all of the antennas within a variation of 1.5 dB, even
though the longitudinal loss of the main cable varies up to 12 dB. It is evident that it is
possible to balance out the loss efﬁciently when using tappers.
4.2.5 Attenuators
Attenuators (as shown in Figure 4.5), attenuate the signal with the value of the attenuator. For
example a 10 dB attenuator will attenuate the signal by 10 dB (port 2 ¼ port 1  attenuation).
Attenuators are used to bring higher power signals down to a desired range of operation,
typical to avoid overdriving an ampliﬁer, or to limit the impact of noise power from an active
distributed antenna system (see Section 10.2).
Typical standard attenuator values are 1, 2, 3, 6 10, 12, 18, 20, 30 and 40 dB. When you
combine them, you can get the desired value; variable attenuators are also available, but
typical only for low power signals. Note that, when attenuating high power signals for many
carriers, typically for multioperator applications you should use a special type of attenuator,
a ‘cable absorber’, to avoid PIM problems.

4.2.6 Dummy Loads or Terminators
Terminators (as shown in Figure 4.6), are used as matching loads on the transmission lines,
often on one port of a circulator, or any ‘open’ or unused ports on other components. In
applications that are sensitive for PIM, the better option is to use a cable absorber
(160 dBc)
4.2.7 Circulators
The circulator splitter (as shown in Figure 4.7) is a nonreciprocal component with low
insertion loss in the forward direction (ports 1–2, 2–3 and 3–1) and high insertion loss in the
reverse direction (ports 2–1, 3–2 and 1–3).
The insertion loss in the forward direction is typically less than 0.5 dB and in the reverse
direction better than 23 dB. You can get ‘double stage’ isolators with reverse isolation better
than 40 dB if needed.
Examples of Use
The circulator can be used to protect the port of a transmitter (as shown in Figure 4.8)
against reverse power from reﬂections caused by a disconnected antenna or cable in the
antenna system.

A common application for circulators in mobile systems is to use the circulator to separate
the transmit and receive directions from a combined Tx/Rx port (as shown in Figure 4.9).
This is mostly used for relatively low power applications due to PIM issues in the circulator.
For high-power applications it is recommended to use a cavity duplex ﬁlter to separate the
two signals.
Circulators can also be used to isolate transmitters in a combined network for a
multioperator system (as shown in Figure 5.28).
4.2.8 A 3 dB Coupler (90 Hybrid)
The 3 dB coupler shown in Figure 4.10 are mostly used for combining signals from two
signal sources. At the same time the coupler will split the two combined signals into two
output ports. This can be very useful when designing passive distributed antenna systems.

Indoor Radio Planning

The 3 dB coupler has four ports; two sets of these are isolated from each other (ports 2 and
3=1 and 4). If power is fed to port 1, this power is distributed to ports 2 and 3 (3 dB). Port 4
will be powerless provided that ports 2 and 3 are ideally matched. Normally a terminator will
be connected to port 4.
Example of Use
If you need to combine two transmitters or two transceivers (TRXs/TRUs), you can use a
3 dB coupler (as shown in Figure 4.11). However, if you need to combine the two
transmitters and at the same time distribute the power to a passive distributed antenna
system with several antennas, you should connect one part of the DAS to port 2 and the
other to port 3 (as shown in Figure 4.12). Thus you will increase the power on the DAS by a
factor of 2 (3 dB). This method is to be preferred, and will increase the signal level by 3 dB
in the building, rather than burning the 3 dB in the dummy load on port 3 (as shown in
Figure 4.11) – this will only generate heat!

4.2.9 Power Load on Passive Components
One parameter that is very important to keep in mind when designing with passive components
is not exceed the maximum power rating that the passive component can handle. This is a
particular problem for high capacity or multioperator passive DAS solutions, where
you combine many carriers and base stations at high power levels into the same passive
distribution system.
Calculating the Total Power from the Base Stations
How do we calculate the total power?
Example, calculating composite power on a passive DAS
We have a multioperator system in an airport; there are three GSM operators connected at
the same point, and each operator has six TRX. The base stations output 46 dBm into the
distributed antenna system. In total we have 3  6 ¼ 18 TRX.
Worst case is that all carriers are loaded 100%; therefore each GSM radio transceiver
transmits a full 46 dBm constantly on all time slots. We need to sum all the power, but ﬁrst
we have to convert from dBm to Watt:
P ðmWÞ ¼ 10
dBm
10 ¼ 40 000 ðmWÞ þ ¼ 40 W
We have 16 signals of 40 W each; the total composite power is:
Total power ¼ 16  40 W ¼ 640 W
Then back to dBm ¼ 10log ð640 000 ½mWÞ ¼ 58 dBm
Therefore we need to insure that the passive components can handle 640 [Watt]/58 dBm
constantly in order to make sure the system is stable.
The PIM Power
PIM is covered in Section 5.7.4. However, let us calculate the level of the PIM signals. If we
take a passive component, with a PIM speciﬁcation of 120 dBc, the maximum PIM
product will be 120 dB below the highest carrier power. For example, continued from the
previous example, we can expect the worst case PIM product to have a signal level of
46 dBm  120 dB ¼ 74 dBm.
This is a major concern; 74 dBm in unwanted signal, especially if the inter-modulation
product falls in the UL band of one of the systems, it will become a very big problem that
will degrade the performance of that system/channel.
Exceeding the maximum the maximum power rating on a passive component will make it
even worse. Be sure to use passive components with very good speciﬁcations when
designing high-power, high-capacity solutions, and be absolutely sure to keep within the
power speciﬁcations of all the components.
102
Indoor Radio Planning

4.2.10 Filters
When designing indoor solutions there are basically two types of ﬁlters that you will
encounter, the duplexer and the diplexer or triplexer, as shown in Figure 4.13.
Duplexer
The duplexer is used to separate a combined TX/RX signal into separate TX and RX lines.
Bear in mind the isolation between the bands as well as the insertion loss and the PIM
speciﬁcations.
Diplexer/Triplexer
The diplexer will separate or combine whole bands from or with each other, for example,
input combined 2100 and 1800 MHz and output separate 2100 and 1800 MHz bands. Bear in
mind the isolation between the bands as well as the insertion loss and the PIM speciﬁcations.
A three band version that can separate or combine 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz is also
available, called a triplexer. Some manufacturers even do combined components that contain
both a diplexer or triplexer and a duplexer.
4.3 The Passive DAS
Now that we know the function of all the passive components, we are able to make a design
of a passive distributed antenna system. Passive DAS systems are the most used approach
when providing indoor solutions, especially to small buildings.
4.3.1 Planning the Passive DAS
The passive DAS is relatively easy to plan; the main thing you need to do is to calculate the
maximum loss to each antenna in the system, and do the link budget accordingly for the
particular areas that each antenna covers. You will need to adapt the design of the passive DAS
to the limitations of the building with regards to restrictions to where and how the heavy coax
can be installed. Often the RF planner will make a draft design based on ﬂoor plans before the
initial site survey, and afterwards adapt this design to meet the installation requirements of the
building. In fact, the role of the RF planner is often limited to installation planning, not RF
planning, when designing passive DAS.

It is very important that you know all the cable distances and types so that you can
calculate the loss from the base station to each individual antenna. Therefore you must do a
detailed site survey of the building, making sure that there are cable routes to all of the
planned antennas. When doing passive DAS design, you will often be limited and restricted
as to where you can install the rigid passive cables. Frequently, the limitations of installation
possibilities will dictate the actual passive DAS design, and because of this the ﬁnal passive
solution will often be a compromise between radio performance and the reality of the
installation restrictions. You need the exact loss of each coax section in the system, in order
to verify the link budget (see Chapter 8), and place the antennas.
A typical passive DAS design can be seen in Figure 4.14, showing a small ofﬁce building.
This design relies on a main vertical 7
8 inch cable, using tappers on each ﬂoor that tap off
power to the horizontal via 1
2 inch coax cables to 1:3 splitters on each ﬂoor.

The advantage is that the heavy 7
8 inch cable can be installed in the vertical cable raiser
where there is easy access and the installation of the rigid coax will be relative simple. On
the ofﬁce ﬂoors it is more of a challenge to installing coaxial cable as no cable trays are
available. By using ‘thin’ 1
2 inch coax for these horizontal cable runs, we can simply strap the
cable onto the frame of the suspended ceiling with cable ties, making the installation
relatively fast and inexpensive.
The coverage in this example is to some extent uniform; there is acceptable balance
between the antennas serving the three ofﬁce ﬂoors. It was decided to radiate more power
into the top of the three elevator shafts, in order to penetrate the lift-car, and provide
sufﬁcient coverage inside the lift for voice service.
When doing the diagram (Figure 4.14), all information must be documented, including
losses of components and cables, type numbers, component numbers and total loss to each
antenna. This design documentation must contain all relevant information, and must be
available on-site in case of trouble-shooting.
Trouble-shooting is an issue with passive systems. You will need to use a power meter
connected to selected points throughout the passive DAS in order to disclose any faults, in
case of a fault on the system. You could use the ‘one meter test’ from Section 5.2.9 for the
worst faults, but you need to connect a power meter to the DAS to be absolutely sure of the
power level.
This is the main downside of using passive DAS: trouble-shooting is painstaking. Also,
even realizing that there is a fault in the system is pretty much a question of customer
complaints from the building; even severe faults on the passive DAS will give no alarm at the
base station.
4.3.2 Main Points About Passive DAS
There are many arguments for and against the use of passive DAS. Remember that passive
DAS is just one of the tools in the indoor radio planning toolkit, sometimes passive DAS will
be the best choice, sometimes not. The clever indoor radio planner will know when to use
this approach, and when not to.
The advantages of passive DAS are:
 It is straightforward but time-consuming to design.
 Components from different manufacturers are compatible.
 It can be installed in harsh environment.
The disadvantages of passive DAS are:
 There is no surveillance of errors in the system – the base station will not give VSWR
alarm even with errors close to the base station due to high return loss.
 It is not ﬂexible for upgrades.
 High losses will degrade data performance.
 It is hard to balance out the link budget for all antennas, and to get a uniform coverage level.
 It requires a high-power base station and dedicated equipment room for site support
equipment, power supply, etc.
Distributed Antenna Systems
105

The fact remains that passive DAS is the most implemented type of DAS on a global
basis. However the need for 3G/UMTS and HSPA service and even higher speed data service
in the future will affect the preference for selecting DAS types.
The attenuation of the passive DAS is the main issue in this context: frequencies used for
future mobile services will most likely get higher and higher, and the modulation schemes
applied for high-speed data services are very sensitive to the impact of the passive cable loss.
This will degrade the downlink power at the antenna, and on the uplink the high noise ﬁgure
of the system caused by the passive losses will limit the uplink data speeds. Surely passive
systems will continue to be used in the future, but only for small buildings with a few
antennas, and the losses must be kept to a minimum.
4.3.3 Applications for Passive DAS
Passive DAS is the most widely used distribution system for indoor coverage systems for
mobile service. Passive DAS can be used for very small buildings with a low-power base
station and a few antennas, all the way up in size to large airports, campuses, etc.
The main challenge in using passive DAS is the installation of the rigid cables, which have
a high impact on the installation cost, and might limit the possibilities as to where antennas
can be installed. This could be an issue in solving the high-rise problem covered in
Section 3.5.3. The building will more or less dictate the design, because of the installation
challenge.
Degraded data service can be an issue if the attenuation of the system gets too high,
epically on 3G/HSPA. This problem can be solved by dividing the passive DAS into small
sections or sectors, each serviced by a local base station. However, this is costly and often
ineffective use of the capacity resources; refer to Section 6.1.9 regarding trunking gains. The
extra backhaul costs, interface loads on the core network and software licenses to the
equipment supplier also add to the cost of distributing the base stations.
High user RF exposure with passive DAS. Mobiles inside the building will radiate on
relatively high power, due to the fact that the mobile has to overcome the passive losses by
transmitting at a higher power level (see Section 4.13). Thus the mobile will expose the users
to higher levels of electromagnetic radiation.
Maintenance and trouble-shooting are challenging in passive DAS systems. Be sure to use
a certiﬁed installer, and do not underestimate the importance of proper installation code and
discipline when installing coax solutions and connectors.
‘Passive systems never fail’ – this is not true. Most likely, you just do not know that there is
a fault! Trust me, when an installer is on top of a ladder at four o’clock in the morning,
mounting the 65th coax connector that night, he might be a little sloppy. Even small
installation faults can result in severe problems, inter-modulation issues, etc. Do not under-
estimate the composite power in a passive system when combining many carriers and services
into the same system at high power.
4.4 Active DAS
The principle function of an active distributed antenna system is that, like a passive
distributed antenna system, it distributes the signal to a number of indoor antennas. However,
106
Indoor Radio Planning

there are some big differences. The active distributed antenna system normally relies on thin
cabling, optical ﬁbers and IT type cables, making the installation work very easy compared
with the rigid cables used for passive systems.
The active distributed antenna system consists of several components, the exact conﬁg-
uration depending on the speciﬁc manufacturer. All active distributed antenna systems will
to some extent be able to compensate for the distance and attenuation of the cables.
4.4.1 Easy to Plan
The ability to compensate for the losses of the cables interconnecting the units in an active
distributed antenna system makes the system very easy and fast to plan, and easy to
implement in the building.
Whereas, when designing a passive distributed antenna system, you need to know the
exact cable route and distance for each cable in order to calculate the loss and link budget,
when designing active distributed antenna systems it does not matter if the antenna is located
20 m from the base station or even 5 km. The performance will be the same for all antennas
in the system; the active DAS system is transparent. This ‘transparency’ is obtained
automatically because the active system will compensate for all cable losses by the use of
internal calibrating signals and ampliﬁers. This is typically done automatically when you
connect the units and commission the system. Therefore the radio planner will not need to
perform a detailed site survey. It does not matter where the cables are installed, and the
system will calibrate any imbalance of the cables. Nor does the radio planner need to do link
budget calculations for all the antennas in the building; all antennas will have the same noise
ﬁgure and the same downlink power, giving truly uniform coverage throughout the building.
These active DAS systems are very fast and easy to plan, implement and optimize.
It is a fact that modern buildings are very dynamic in terms of their usage. Having a
distributed antenna system that can easily be upgraded and adapted to the need of the
building is important. It is important for the users of the building, the building owner and the
mobile operator. The active DAS can accommodate that concern, being easy and ﬂexible to
adapt and to upgrade. There is no need to rework the whole design and installation if there
are changes and additions in the system; there is always the same antenna power, whatever
the number of or distance to the antennas.
4.4.2 Pure Active DAS for Large Buildings
Ideally in an active DAS there will be no passive components that are not compensated by the
system. Therefore the active DAS is able to monitor the end-to-end performance of the total
DAS and give alarms in case of malfunction or disconnection of cables and antennas. These
active DAS systems can support one band–one operator, or large multioperator solutions.
No Need for High Power
The philosophy behind the purely active DAS architecture is to have the last DL ampliﬁer and
the ﬁrst UL ampliﬁer as close to the antenna as possible. Co-located with the antenna is the
remote unit (RU), avoiding any unnecessary degrading losses of passive coax cables.
Distributed Antenna Systems
107

When using this philosophy, having the RU located close to the antenna, there is no need to
use excessive downlink transmit power from the base station to compensate for losses in passive
coax cables; therefore the system can be based on low to medium transmission power from the
RU, because all the RU downlink power will be delivered to the antenna with no losses.
Better Data Performance on the Uplink
Purely active DAS has big advantages for the uplink data performance. Having the ﬁrst
uplink in the RU, with no losses back to the base station, will boost the data performance.
This is very important for the performance of high-speed data, the higher EDGE coding
schemes on GSM, high-speed data on UMTS and in particular, HSUPA performance.
The main difference between the passive and active DAS on the uplink performance is
that, even though the active DAS will have a certain noise ﬁgure, it will be far lower
compared with the high system noise ﬁgure on high-loss passive DAS systems. The effective
NF performance is basic radio design; refer to Chapter 7 for more details on how the loss and
noise ﬁgure affect the system performance.
Medium to Large Solutions
By the use of transmission via low-loss optical ﬁbers, a typical active DAS can reach
distances of more than 5 km. The cable between EU and RU up to 250 m makes these types
of solutions applicable in medium to large buildings, typically large ofﬁce buildings,
shopping malls, hospitals, campus environments and tunnels.
Save on Installation and Project Cost
The active DAS will typically only require about þ10 dBm input power from the base
station; there is no need for a large, high-power base station installation, with heavy power
supply, air-conditioning, etc. A mini-base station can be used to feed the system, and the
system components are so small that an equipment room can be avoided; everything can
simply be installed in a shaft.
Less power consumption due to the need for less power from the base station with no
ventilation saves on operational costs, and makes the system more green and more CO2
friendly. The fact that the installation work uses the thin cabling infrastructure of an active
DAS can also cut project cost and implementation time.
Time to deployment is also short compared with the traditional passive design. You are
able to react faster to the users’ need for indoor coverage, and thus revenue will be generated
faster, and the users will be more loyal.
The Components of the Active DAS
In order to understand how you can use active DAS for indoor coverage planning, you need
to understand the elements of the active DAS. Some active DAS systems use pure analog
signals; other systems convert the RF to digital and might also apply IP transmission
internally.
108
Indoor Radio Planning

The names of the units, numbers of ports, distances and cable types will be slightly
different, but the principle is the same (Figure 4.15). Typically these types of DAS systems
will be able to support both GSM and UMTS, so you will need only one DAS system in the
building to cater for all mobile services and operators.

Main Unit
The main unit (MU) connects to the low-power base station or repeater; the MU distributes
the signals to the rest of the system via expansion units (EU). The MU will typically be
connected to the EU by optical ﬁbers. The MU is the ‘brain’ of the system and also generates
and controls internal calibration signals in the system together with internal ampliﬁers, and
converters adjust gains and levels to the different ports in order to compensate for the
variance of internal cable loss between all the units.
The MU will also monitor the performance of the DAS system, communicating data to all
units in the DAS. In the event of a malfunction or a warning it is able to send an alarm signal
to the base station that enables the operator to exactly pinpoint the root of the problem and
resolve the problem fast.
Detail about speciﬁc alarms is typically good; the system will normally pinpoint the exact
cable, antenna or component that is the root of the problem. Thus the downtime of the DAS
can be limited, and the performance of the system re-established quickly.
It is possible to see the status of the whole system and the individual units at the MU, using
LEDs, an internal LCD display or via a connected PC – it all depends on the manufacture of the
system.
It is also possible to access the MU remotely via modem or via the internet using IP,
perform status investigation, reconﬁguration and retrieve alarms in order to ease trouble-
shooting and support.
Expansion Unit
The EUs are typically distributed throughout the building or campus and are placed in
central cable raisers or IT X-connect rooms. The EU is connected to the MU using optical
ﬁbers, typically separate ﬁbers for the UL and the DL. The EU converts the optical signal
from the MU to an electrical signal and distributes this to the RU.
Ideally the EU will also feed the DC power supply to the RUs via the existing signal cable
in order to avoid the need for local power supply at each antenna point (RU). In many cases
LEDs will provide a status of the local EU and subsystem (the RUs).
Optical Fiber Installations
Some systems can use both single mode ﬁber (SMF) and multimode ﬁber (MMF), and some
systems only SMF. It is important to consider this when planning to reuse already installed
ﬁber in the building, since old ﬁber installations are typically only MMF. Installation of
ﬁbers and ﬁber connectors takes both education and discipline, so be sure that your installer
has been certiﬁed for this work, and always refer to the installation guidelines from the
manufacturer of the DAS.
Remote Unit
The RU is installed close to the antenna, to keep the passive losses to a minimum and
improve the radio link performance. The RU converts the signal from the EU back to normal
DL radio signals and the radio signal from the mobiles on the UL is converted and
110
Indoor Radio Planning

transmitted back to the EU. The RU is located close to the antenna, typically only connected
to a short RF jumper. This will insure the best RF performance and the possibility of active
DAS to detect when the antenna is disconnected from the system.
The RU should be DC fed with power from the EU in order to avoid expensive local
power supply at each antenna point. In addition, the RU should be designed with no fans or
other noisy internal parts, in order to enable the system to be installed in quiet ofﬁce
environments.
The RU is connected to the EU with a thin coax, or CAT5 cables or similar ‘thin cabling’,
making it very easy and quick to install compared with the rigid passive coax cables used for
passive DAS.
4.4.3 Pure Active DAS for Small to Medium-size Buildings
Even though that active DAS is normally considered applicable for large buildings, small
buildings can be designed with pure active DAS (Figure 4.16), thereby utilizing the beneﬁts
of having a high-performance DAS, with light cabling infrastructure, a small low-power base
station and full surveillance of the DAS.
Main Unit
The system consists of one MU connected directly to RUs with thin coax, CAT5 or other
‘IT-type’ cables; there is no use of optical ﬁbers. This small system has all the same
functions and advantages with regards to auto calibration, uniform performance and
improved radio link as the large systems. Even the detailed alarming is the same; full
monitoring of the system, including the antennas, is possible.
For medium-sized buildings, you can feed more of these systems in parallel to obtain
more antenna points. This makes this medium system a very cost-effective and high-
performing system.
Cost-effective Installation
Both of these pure active systems are very cost-effective and easy to install. Often the IT
team of the speciﬁc building can carry out the installation for the operator, thus sharing the
cost load with the operator. In this way the building owner or user pays for the installation
and the operator pays for the equipment and infrastructure. This will boost the business
case, and create a more loyal customer, who is now a part of the project. This also give an
advantages for system performance, as the end user can provide more detailed help with
inputs as to where in the building it is most important to plan and implement perfect
coverage, and also in understanding why certain areas have a lower signal. However, it is
important to note that the units in active DAS cannot always be installed in tough
environments, as moisture, vibrations and dust might cause damage. Therefore it is very
important to check the manufacturer’s guidelines and installation instructions. Many
systems can be installed in harsh environments, if shielded inside an appropriate
IP-certiﬁed box.
Distributed Antenna Systems
111

Applications for the Pure Active DAS
The large version of the pure active DAS as shown in Figure 4.15 is a very versatile tool for
large buildings or campuses. The low-impact installation of the pure active DAS, using and
reusing thin ‘IT-type’ cabling, makes this solution ideal in corporate buildings, hotels and
hospitals. The installation is fast and easy, making it possible to react to requests for indoor
coverage swiftly. The concept of having the RU close to the antenna boosts the data
performance in these high-proﬁle buildings, where 3G/HSPA service is a must.
Radiation from mobiles and DAS antenna systems are a concern for the users of the
building. The pure active DAS has the RUs installed lose to the antenna; this boosts the uplink
data performance. In addition there is a side effect: because the system calibrates the cable
losses, there is no attenuation of the signal from the antenna to the base station. Hence the
mobile can operate using very low transmit power, because it does not have to compensate for
any passive cable loss back to the base station in order to reach the uplink target level used for
power control. This makes this approach ideal for installations in hospitals, for example. See
Section 4.13 for more details on electromagnetic radiation.
The small version of the pure active DAS shown in Figure 4.16 has all the advantages of the
large system, but it does not rely on ﬁber installation. This takes some of the complexity out of
the installation process. The system is ideal and cost-effective for small to medium-size
buildings. Given that the system can reach more than 200 m from the MU to the RU, if installed
in the center of a high-rise tower it could cover a 300 m-high building without any need for
ﬁber (reserving some distance for horizontal cables). The systems are fully supervised all the
way to the antenna; there is full visibility of the performance of the DAS.
Reliability is a concern, due to the number of units distributed throughout the building.
You must select a supplier that can document good reliability and mean time between

failures (MTBF) statistics. You also need to make sure that the location of all the installed
units is documented, so they can be accessed for maintenance.
You must be careful when installing these types of systems in moist, damp, dusty
environments and shield them accordingly.
4.4.4 Active Fiber DAS
The increasing need for more and more bandwidth over the DAS to support multiple radio
services, GSM, DCS, UMTS, Wi-Fi, WiMAX, Tetra, etc. has motivated a need for the indoor
ﬁber DAS system to support a wider bandwidth to accommodate all the radio service, as
shown in Figure 4.17.

Although it is debatable if it is feasible to combine many radio services with quite
different design requirement into the same DAS, it is a fact that it is an installation advantage
to have only one system and one set of antennas. The compromise will often be the
performance on one or more of the services, and a costly DAS.
If all services require ‘full’ indoor coverage, the consequence is that you will have to
design according to the lowest dominator. For example, if the DAS design turns out to show
a coverage radius for GSM ¼ 24 m, UMTS ¼ 21 m, but WiMAX ¼ 10 m, you have to place
the antennas according to the WiMAX requirement, thus overdesigning the GSM and UMTS
system. In fact you often have to adjust the gain of the various services accordingly, to
prevent signal leak from the building.
Another concern is the sector plan. Be sure that the DAS allows you to granulate all the
different radio systems into independent sector plans.
The Components of the Fiber DAS
Main Unit
The MU interfaces the ﬁber DAS to the different base stations. The MH distributes the
signals directly to the optical remote units by the use of optical ﬁbers. In many cases this
ﬁber is a composite cable, containing both the ﬁber and the copper cable for power supply to
the remote unit. Alternatively the power is fed locally at the optical remote unit.
The MU is the ‘brain’ of the system and also generates and controls internal calibration
signals in the system together with internal ampliﬁers, and converters adjust gains and levels
to the different ports in order to compensate for the variance of internal optical cable loss
between the MU and remote units.
The MU will also monitor the performance of the DAS system. In the event of a
malfunction or a warning, it must be able to send an alarm signal to the base station, which
enables the operators to exactly pinpoint the root of the problem and resolve the problem
fast. Details about speciﬁc alarms is typically good; the system will normally pinpoint the
exact cable, antenna or component that is the root of the problem, thus the downtime of the
DAS can be limited, and the performance of the system quickly re-established.
It is possible to see the status of the whole system and the individual units at the MU using
LEDs, an internal LCD display or via a connected PC – it all depends of the manufacture of
the system. It is also possible to access the MU remotely via a modem or the internet using
IP, and perform status investigation or reconﬁguration.
Optical Remote Unit
The ORU is installed throughout the building; it converts the optical signal from the MU
back to normal RF and the RF UL signal from the mobiles is converted and transmitted to
the MU. The ORU will typically need to operate on medium to high-output RF power and
will often have two or more antenna connections, for the DAS antennas.
Daisy-chained Systems
A variant of the optical DAS system can be seen in Figure 4.27, where the optically remote
units can be daisy-chained, thereby avoiding the star conﬁguration of Figure 4.17, where all
114
Indoor Radio Planning

optical remote units need an individual ﬁber or set of ﬁbers back to MU. This makes the
optical system very applicable in tunnels, street DAS and high-rise buildings.
The downside with the daisy-chained system is that, if the ﬁber is cut, or the optical by-
pass in one optical remote fails, then the rest of the DAS on the chain will be out of service.
Applications of the Optically Active DAS
This system is ideal for systems where there is a need for multiple services, other than ‘just’
GSM and UMTS. However, combining all these radio services into the same DAS is a
challenge when it comes to inter-modulation and composite power resources.
Power supply to the ORU can also be a challenge; when using the composite cable that
has both the copper cable for the DC power and the ﬁber cable, you need to be careful about
galvanic isolation between the buildings and grounding. The concept of having the ORU
close to the antenna boosts the data performance in these high-proﬁle buildings, where 3G/
HSPA service is a must.
Radiation from mobiles and DAS antenna systems are a concern for the users of the
building. The optically active DAS has the ORU installed close to the antenna; this will
boost the uplink data performance. In addition there is a side effect; because the system
calibrates the cable losses, there is no attenuation of the signal from the antenna to the base
station. Hence the mobile can operate using very low transmission power, because it does not
have to compensate for any passive cable loss back to the base station in order to reach the
uplink target level used for power control. This makes this approach ideal for installations in
hospitals, for example. See Section 4.13 for more details on electromagnetic radiation.
The systems are fully supervised all the way to the antenna; there is full visibility of the
performance of the DAS. Reliability is a concern, due to the number of distributed unit
throughout the building. It is essential to select a supplier that can document good reliability
and MTBF statistics. You also need to make sure that the location of all installed units is
documented, so that they can be accessed for maintenance.
Care must be taken when installing these types of systems in moist, damp or dusty
environments and they must be shielded accordingly. This is a particular challenge in tunnel
installations, where the daisy-chained version of this type of DAS is often used.
4.5 Hybrid Active DAS Solutions
It is important to distinguish between the pure active DAS that we covered in the previous
section and hybrid DAS solutions. As the name suggests, a ‘hybrid’ DAS is a mix of an
active DAS and a passive DAS.
The passive part of the hybrid DAS will, as for the pure passive DAS, limit the installation
possibilities, impact data performance on 3G/HSPA and to some extent dictate the design,
due to installation limitations.
4.5.1 Data Performance on the Uplink
The basic of RF design is to limit any loss prior to the ﬁrst ampliﬁer in the receive chain. The
fact is that the passive portion of the hybrid solution between the antenna and the hybrid
Distributed Antenna Systems
115

remote unit (HRU) will degrade the UL data performance. This is explained in more detail in
Chapter 7. The impact of the passive portion of the hybrid DAS becomes a concern for
UMTS and HSUPA performance.
4.5.2 DL Antenna Power
Even though the typical hybrid DAS produces medium to high power levels out of the HRU,
the power at the antenna points will typically be signiﬁcantly lower. The reason for this is
that the power is attenuated by the passive DAS between the HRU and the antenna, but if you
only service a few antennas and keep the losses low, you can obtain relatively high radiated
power from the antennas.
4.5.3 Antenna Supervision
The small passive DAS after the HRU will give a high return loss back to the HRU; therefore it
is often a problem for the HRU to be able to detect any VSWR problems due to the attenuation
of the reﬂection from a disconnected antenna. This, in practice, makes the antenna supervision
nonexistent.
4.5.4 Installation Challenges
In order for the HRU to provide high output power levels, the HRU power consumption is quite
high.Thereforeyouwilltypicallyneedtoconnecta localpower supply totheHRU;alternatively
youcanuseaspecialhybridcablefromtheMUtotheHRUthatcontainsboththeﬁberandcopper
wires feeding the DC power to the HRU. The need to use a local power supply for each HRU will
add cost and complexity to the system, and more points of failure. Most likely, you will not be
allowed to use any local power group, but are requested to install a new power group for all the
HRUs in the DAS. Therefore, using the hybrid DAS type with composite ﬁber cables that also
accommodate copper wires for power supply of the HRU is often to be preferred; however, there
might be a concern in campus installations where you need to make sure that there is galvanic
isolation between the buildings. Therefore copper cables might not be allowed to be installed
between the buildings, due to grounding issues. Disregarding this might cause severe damage to
the DAS and the buildings, and in the worst case start a ﬁre.
Owing to the high power consumption, the HRU normally has active cooling, and often a
fan to help with ventilation. This might limit the installation possibilities because of the
acoustic noise, which is often restricted to the vertical cable raiser.
4.5.5 The Elements of the Hybrid Active DAS
Refer to Figure 4.18.
Main Unit
The MU connects to the low-power base station or repeater, and distributes the signals to the
HRUs in the system. Typically the MU is connected to the HRU using optical ﬁbers. The
116
Indoor Radio Planning

MU is the controlling element, the ‘brain’ of the system and also generates and controls
internal calibration signals in the system, and then adjust gain and calibration levels to the
different ports in order to compensate for the internal cable loss between the MH and HRU.
However the system cannot include the passive DAS after the HRU; this part still relies on
manual calculation and calibration.
The MU will also monitor the performance of the active part of the DAS system, and in
the event of a malfunction is able to send an alarm signal to the base station so the operator
can resolve the problem quickly. The system will not be able to detect any problems on the
passive DAS, as there will normally be no antenna surveillance. It is possible to see the status

connected PC.
It will often be possible to access the MU remotely via modem or the internet using IP,
perform status investigation or reconﬁguration, and retrieve alarms in order to ease trouble-
shooting and remote support.
Hybrid Remote Unit
The HRU is installed throughout the building. It converts the optical signal from the MU
back to normal RF, and the RF UL signal from the mobiles is converted and transmitted to
the MU. The HRU will typically need to operate on medium- to high-output RF power, in
order to compensate for the losses in the passive DAS that feed the signals to the distributed
antennas connected to the HRU.
Applications for Hybrid DAS
Hybrid DAS solutions are ideal solutions where you need high output power at the remote
unit. This could be in tunnels; for ‘T-Feed systems’ see Section 4.8. It could also be sports
arenas and multioperator systems where the composite RF power of the remote unit must be
shared by many channels.
However, you must be careful with the high output power, and make sure that the uplink
can track the coverage area of the downlink, or else the DAS will be out of balance. You
must also be careful not to use the high power to only power one ‘hot’ antenna in the
building; this could cause electromagnetic radiation (EMR) concerns (see Section 4.13) and
cause interference in the surrounding network.
The relative high cost of the hybrid DAS system normally makes it applicable only for
only large structures with high trafﬁc, and high revenue basis.
4.6 Other Hybrid DAS Solutions
Often it can be effective to combine different type of DAS designs in a project, using passive
DAS in one part of the building close to the base station, and active DAS in other more
distant areas.
It is also possible to combine DAS solutions with macro sectors; for example an outdoor
macro site might also be connected to an indoor DAS in the same building, for example
where the outdoor sites are located on the roof.
The combination of different concepts will often enable the radio planner to design the
DAS as economically as possible, and at the same time maximize performance. Once again
it is all about using more tools in the toolbox; do not always rely on only one type.
4.6.1 In-line BDA Solution
It is possible to add an in-line bidirectional ampliﬁer (BDA) to a passive DAS in order to
boost the performance of both the uplink and downlink on distant parts of the DAS, as shown
118
Indoor Radio Planning

in Figure 4.19. However it is a fact that all passive attenuation prior to the BDA, between the
BDA and antenna, will seriously impact the noise ﬁgure on the system, limiting the uplink
performance, which is especially a concern for 3G/UMTS/HSUPA indoor designs. Pre-
ferably the BDA should be installed as close as possible to the antenna. Refer to Section 7.2
for more details on how to optimize the BDA design.
As the name suggests, the BDA is a two-way ampliﬁer with two lines, two ampliﬁer
systems, one for the DL one for the UL, and a ﬁlter system at both input and output.
In some applications the DC power to the BDA can be fed via the coax. This is very useful
for tunnel solutions (see Section 4.9.2) and will save costs and complexity for power
distribution. In that case it is important to use passive components that are able to handle the
DC power that are feed over the coax cable.
Owing to the remote location of the repeater, the only way to get an alarm back to the
operations center is to use a RF modem located at the BDA location. Obviously this concept
only works if the RF modem does not have to rely on the coverage signal from the BDA
itself!
It is possible to cascade BDAs, i.e. have more than one BDA in the DAS system. This
could be done in a daisy-chain structure or even in parallel. However, it is important to be
careful about noise control for this type of application. The noise increase in cascaded BDA
systems can cause major problems with uplink degradation and have a serious impact on the
performance of the base station and the network if you are not careful in the design phase.
Refer to Chapter 7 with regards to noise calculation, and how to optimize the BDA design.
4.6.2 Combining Passive and Active Indoor DAS
Often the most ideal solution for an indoor project would be to combine the best parts of
passive and the best part of active DAS design (Figure 4.19). Passive DAS is cost-effective in

basements, easy to install in the open cable trays available in basements and parking areas,
and with low distances and only servicing a few antennas, the RF performance can be good.
Active DAS is often more expensive, but it has the edge on performance at longer distances,
and is easier to install in the more challenging parts of the building.
In the typical indoor project you will ﬁnd that the equipment room you are assigned for
the base station is located in the basement. Therefore it would be natural to cover the areas
near the base station, parking areas, basement, etc., using a passive DAS with few antennas.
This is ‘zone A’ (see Section 3.5.6), so you can get by with a relatively low coverage level.
In the areas far from the equipment room, however, the ofﬁce ﬂoors in the topmost part of
the building, the high loss on a passive DAS might degrade the performance. Also, the
installation challenge with rigid heavy passive cables might be an issue, and too expensive.
Then the natural choice would be to use passive DAS close to the base station, but active
DAS in the more challenging areas. Then you can use the best of both applications, and
avoid the downsides of any of them – now that is good use of the ‘radio planning toolbox’.
Mind the Noise Power
There is one issue you need to be careful about when combining active DAS with a passive
DAS, as shown in Figure 4.20 that is the noise power that the active DAS will inject into the

passive system (base station). If you have a scenario where the uplink in the passive part of
the DAS is the limiting factor, then the noise rise caused by the active DAS could degrade
the uplink coverage in the passive part of the DAS.
However the problem can be solved by carefully choosing the correct value of UL
attenuator on the main hub of the active system. Refer to Section 7.5 for more detail on how
to control the noise power.
4.6.3 Combining Indoor and Outdoor Coverage
Often you will ﬁnd that a building where a macro base station is located on the rooftop has
surprisingly poor indoor coverage near the central core, especially on the lower ﬂoors. This
is mainly due to the fact that the radio power is beamed away from the building by the high-
gain antennas; the coverage inside the building has to rely on reﬂections from the adjacent
buildings and structures. This is a problem especially in high-rise buildings that are not
surrounded by high adjacent structures that can reﬂect the RF signal back into the building
(as shown in Figure 4.21). In these cases it might make sense to use the rooftop macro base
station as a donor for an indoor DAS. This saves the costs of an indoor base station,
backhaul, etc. The capacity is trunked between the indoor and outdoor areas. If the trafﬁc
proﬁles between the two areas are offset, it can be a very efﬁcient use of resources; see
Section 6.1.9 for load sharing of the trafﬁc proﬁles.
Minimize the Impact on the Donor Macro Sector
When you split a rooftop macro cell into also serving an indoor DAS there are concerns that
need to be addressed. One option is to split the power to one of the outdoor sectors to a
passive DAS. However, this approach costs power and coverage area of the outdoor cell,
especially if you need to feed a large indoor DAS.
Figure 4.21
RF coverage in the building with the rooftop macro is low due to the need for reﬂections
to provide indoor coverage
Distributed Antenna Systems
121

The solution could be to tap off a fraction of the power (0.1 dB) to the macro cell to an
active DAS (as shown in Figure 4.22). The advantage of this approach is that the outdoor
coverage for the donor cell is maintained. The active DAS typically needs only þ5 dBm
input power, so only very little power needs to be tapped off from the outdoor sector.
Mind the Noise Power from the DAS
There is one issue you need to be careful about, which is the noise power that the active DAS
will inject in the UL of the macro donor sector. This can desensitize the receiver in the base
station, limiting the uplink performance and impacting the UL coverage area, and on UMTS
the noise load will offset admission control. The problem can be solved by installing an
attenuator on the uplink port of the active DAS and very carefully choosing the correct value
of the attenuator. Refer to Section 7.5 for more detail on how to control the noise power and
to Chapter 10 on how to optimize the performance.
Applications for Tapping of a Macro Base Station
Only a fraction of the power from the macro base station is needed, which will be more than
enough to feed a large active indoor system. This makes this solution shown in Figure 4.22
applicable to many cases, like shopping malls and sports arenas.
However it is a ﬁne balance; you must remember that all the downlink power and capacity
used inside the building will also be radiated from the rooftop macro sector, causing
interference load and noise increase in the macro sector. By conﬁguring the settings
correctly and carefully planning the indoor system to provide high levels of indoor coverage,
it should be possible to minimize this effect, and make sure that the power control on the
base station will power down the signals to the indoor users to a minimum.
4.7 Radiating Cable Solutions
This book is focused on indoor coverage solutions for buildings, and traditionally radiating
cable is only used for tunnel coverage solutions. However there are cases where a building
has one or several long tunnels interconnecting buildings in a campus, long vertical shafts,
emergency staircases or elevator shafts where a radiating cable could be considered as a
possible solution. It is not the intention to cover all the aspects of using radiating cable in
tunnel environments – covering this topic would take a whole book on its own. However, in
order to understand the basics with regards to radiating cable design, the most important
parameters will be addressed here, in order to enable the RF designer with the most basic
level of understanding of the issues to design these types of solutions.
4.7.1 The Radiating Cable
The radiating cable or ‘leaky feeder’(as shown in Figure 4.23) is typically based on a
traditional coaxial cable with (1) an inner conductor, (2) a dielectric, (3) an outer shield, (4)
tuned slots in the outer shield and ﬁnally (5) the jacket. The size, shape, orientation and
placement of the slots are optimized to tune the coverage from the cable. The cable can be

tuned with regards to coupling loss at certain distances, frequency bandwidths, insertion
(longitudinal) and loss.
The cable actually acts as a long antenna, or actually many small antennas. The slots will
radiate and pick up signal along the length of the cable. Typically the cable will be optimized
to serve a speciﬁc frequency range of RF spectrum, and optimized to maximum coverage
within a certain distance, within the space of the tunnel. Normally a radiating cable is not
applicable for servicing users who are not in the proximity of the cable; it is typically ideal
for distances of 2-10 m perpendicular to the cable.
The Technical Data of the Radiating Cable
Radiating cable might initially look very simple and easy to understand, but designing and
installing radiating cable coverage solutions is a challenge. To understand how to utilize the
cable, you ﬁrst of all need to understand the main parameters of the cable. The most
important parameters to consider when selecting, designing and installing radiating cables
are listed below.
Frequency Range
The radiating cable will typically be designed and optimized to support speciﬁc frequency
ranges or bands. For use in designing systems for GSM/DCS/UMTS you can ﬁnd standard
radiating cable optimized to support 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz. Be careful if you plan to
apply other radio services on the same cable system, and make sure that the cable will be
able to support it.
Longitudinal Loss
The longitudinal loss increases with the distance and will vary with frequency as with
standard coaxial cable. Note that the longitudinal loss is also related to the coupling loss of
the cable, so the lower the coupling loss the cable is designed for, the more signal is coupled
out of the cable, and hence there will be a higher longitudinal loss.
Coupling Loss
The coupling loss is the loss between the cable and the mobile terminal, speciﬁed at a given
distance and probability, typically 2 or 6 m. The speciﬁcation of coupling loss usually has a
relatively high variance margin, typically 10 dB. Be sure to include this in the design
overhead margin when calculating the link budget.
Note that the coupling losses stated in the datasheet are related to a certain probability. A
coupling loss of 80 dB at 50% probability could mean a coupling loss of 95 dB at 95%
probability.
Figure 4.23
Radiating cable, principle
124
Indoor Radio Planning

System Loss
The system loss is the sum of the longitudinal and coupling loss. This information is
sometimes used in data sheets.
DC Resistance
In many tunnel applications DC is injected onto the radiating cable at a central point, and
distributed via the inner and outer copper conductor of the coax. This is used for distributing
power supply to distributed active elements, ampliﬁers, etc., connected in the system. It is
important that the DC characteristics of the cable will be able to accommodate the power load
requirementsoftheampliﬁers,BDAs(bi-directionalampliﬁers)andotherequipmentontheline.
Mechanical Speciﬁcations
As for other types of cables, mechanical speciﬁcations, size, bend radius and ﬁre rating are
important. Be sure to fulﬁll the installation speciation and local guidelines for the speciﬁc site
wherethe cableis tobe installed,as wellas thespeciﬁcations from the manufacturer ofthecable.
Delays in the System
Owing to long cables, optical links, etc., delay and timing can be an issue in tunnel solutions.
Remember that the velocity of the coax cable and ﬁber as well as delays in active elements will
cause the timing to shift. This will offset the timing advance in GSM (and for very long tunnels
you might even reach the limit for maximum timing advance in the GSM system). For UMTS
you might need to widen your ‘search window’. Refer to Chapter 10.3 for more details.
4.7.2 Calculating the Coverage Level
Realize that fading in the tunnel and coupling variance from the cable as shown in Figure 4.24
has to be accounted for in the link budget. It is fairly easy to calculate the service level in the
tunnel. It is important to include fading margins; these margins will depend on several ‘tunnel
factors’ such as tunnel size, shape, material, speed of the users and obstructions in the tunnel.
Most manufacturers of radiating cable will provide you with design support and help with tools
that can help you do the radio planning of the tunnel sections.
Figure 4.24
Fading and variance of the signal in a tunnel can be high, so good design margins are
recommended
Distributed Antenna Systems
125

Ideally, especially on a large tunnel project, is recommended to verify RF calculations and
the link budget with a trial installation in a section of the tunnel. It can be very expensive if
mistakes are made in tunnel projects; be absolutely sure to check, re-check and double-check
everything, twice. Believe me, I learned that the hard way!
4.7.3 Installation Challenges Using Radiating Cable
In tunnel projects, installation challenges, limited space and lack of access play a major role
in the project, especially with regards to time consumption and installation cost.
 Grounding: installation of radiating cable inside tunnels, especially metro tunnels with
operational train services and high-power DC lines to feed power to the trains, is a major
challenge. The power supply to the trains via the typical third rail or overhead power line
is so powerful that it is likely to induct power on the radiating cable in the tunnel, therefore
grounding is very important.
 Follow the instructions: it is very important to install the radiating cable exactly as
speciﬁed by the speciﬁc vendor of the cable. It is equally important to carefully follow the
local on-site guidelines 100%. Terminate all points in the system, do not leave the cable
‘open’ at one end, terminate with an antenna or use a terminator (dummy load).
 Use cable clamps: special clamps that stand off the wall have to be used to install the cable
at a distance from the wall; if you do not do this, then the coupling loss will increase
drastically. Normally you will need to use metallic ﬁre protection clamps every 3 m or so,
to insure that the cable does not fall off the wall in case of a ﬁre and block rescue access.
In tunnels with a high speed train service, special attention must be paid to the mechanical
stress on the cable installation. Often a special type of heavy duty cable clamp has to be
used to make sure the cable is secured to the wall.
 Align the cable: normally, especially on higher frequencies, such as 1800 or 2100 MHz, the
cable has to be aligned perfectly so that the slots can leak to the environment with minimum
couplingloss;a guideistypicallyprintedonthe jacketofthecabletoassist withthealignment.
 Mechanical stress: do not underestimate the mechanical stress on a tunnel installation; this
applies to all equipment installed, and therefore also the cables. Normally you could get
by with letting a coax cable lean against the corner of a concrete wall, but vibration on the
coax caused by the vehicles or trains will cause the concrete to wear off the plastic jacket
and into the copper of the cable. Over time, moist and corrosion will degrade the
performance. It is very important to observe that, if you have to pass the radiating cable
through a heavy wall, you need to terminate the radiating cable, using a normal coax
jumper through the wall, and continue with a new section of radiating cable on the other
side of the wall. If this is not done correctly, the system loss will be increased.
 Clean the cable frequently: another practical issue with a major degrading impact on
performance is dirt on the radiating cable. Dust from diesel exhaust residue, brake dust
from trains, etc., will dramatically increase the system loss. Therefore routine cleaning of
the cables will need to be scheduled to preserve performance.
The biggest challenge in using radiating cables is the installation. It is often very expensive
and time-consuming. This is especially true if the system is to be installed in an operational
126
Indoor Radio Planning

tunnel. In this case you might only get access to the tunnel for a few hours every night, while
it is closed for scheduled maintenance. Only rarely will you be allowed to close the tunnel,
only for the purpose of installing the mobile radio system. Installing radiating cable is a
logistical challenge. The cables have to be transported on a special trolley, cable stands pre-
mounted and connectors ﬁtted. Everything needs to fall into place in order to be able to
install just a few hundred meters of cable during a night shift. Remember, you need to
evacuate and clean the site in good time prior to the trafﬁc opening in the tunnel. Tracks need
to be inspected in order to approve the tunnel for rail trafﬁc again; it takes just a small cable
stand on the track to derail a fast-moving train.
4.8 Tunnel Solutions, Cascaded BDAs
One way to design a tunnel system with radiating cable is to use daisy-chained BDAs to
‘ramp up’ the signal at certain intervals (Figure 4.25) in order to compensate for the
longitudinal attenuation and to keep the coverage level above the required design level.
In this type of application the gain of the BDAs will typically be adjusted in order to
compensate for the longitudinal loss of the preceding cable, but not higher – that would just
cause noise build-up and degraded dynamic range (see Chapter 7 for noise calculations).
This design methodology is sometime referred to as ‘zero loss systems’.
4.8.1 Cascaded Noise Build-up
One concern about these types of systems with cascaded ampliﬁers is the noise increase and
limitations in dynamic range. You will need to be careful when conﬁguring the gain of the
ampliﬁers in the system. This is because each ampliﬁer will amplify the signal and the noise of
the preceding link and also add its own noise ﬁgure to the performance. If you are not careful
there will be a severe cascaded noise build-up in the system. Noise calculations and guidelines
on how to design ampliﬁer systems and control the noise are covered in Chapter 7. In practice,
you should at a maximum cascade three or four BDAs, but this has to be veriﬁed in the link
budget of the actual project.

Distributed Antenna Systems
127

Cascaded System, Principle
The principle of the ‘zero loss system’ is shown in Figure 4.25, where a base station drives
the ﬁrst section of radiating cable and the handover antenna, before the longitudinal loss
attenuates the service level too much. The ﬁrst BDA ampliﬁes the signal and feeds the next
section of radiating cable. This section then drives another section of cable, and so on. The
two handover antennas will to some extent overpower the signal from the radiating cable
when the mobile is close to these antennas. Note that the BDA works only in one direction
(one direction for the downlink, the opposite direction for the uplink), unlike the ‘T-feed
system’ (Section 4.9), that radiates out in both directions of the radiating cable.
Power Supply to the BDAs
To save on project cost, limit failure points and ease maintenance, centralized DC power is
injected into the radiating cable near the base station. This DC will power all the BDAs on
the line. Make sure that all the components on the line are able to handle the DC power, and
are able to pass the DC when needed.
Supervision and Stability
One major week point in this type of system is that, in the case of an ampliﬁer malfunction
or if a cable is cut, all signals could be lost in the remaining part of the tunnel system.
Special BDAs for tunnels will often have a ‘bypass’ function, to make sure that signals are
passed on 1:1 with no ampliﬁcation in case of an error. In most cases this will make only a
small difference; the signal to the next BDA will be too low for the system to perform due to
the lack of signal.
Specialized inline BDA systems are available that are able to communicate internally via
the coax. Each active element will be assigned its own address, and the system will be able
to communicate internally, perform auto calibration and have a central point where the status
of the system, performance and alarming can be monitored and controlled locally or
remotely via an RF modem or IP connection.
4.8.2 Example of a Real-life Cascaded BDA System
The measurement shown in Figure 4.26 is a real-life measurement of a cascaded BDA or
leaky feeder system in a tunnel, showing a section of the tunnel with three BDAs.
You can clearly see the HO antenna that is placed just before the rightmost BDA, the
‘peak’ on the signal level, and on the left side of the graph is a similar peak from an antenna.
The measurement shown is over an 800 m section of the tunnel, from one metro station to
the next station. The radiating cable was placed in a 5 m wide circular concrete tunnel,
carefully aligned with the placement of the windows of the train. Measurements were made
at 2 m from the radiating cable, in the center of the track during a walk test by foot in the
empty tunnel. The distance between the BDAs was about 260 m, and the radiating cable was
a heavy 11
4 inch.
128
Indoor Radio Planning

The design level was 75 dBm at 98% GSM1800 in the empty tunnel (penetration loss
into the train was veriﬁed by measurements to be only 5 dB). The longitudinal loss per
100 m was 6 dB according to the speciﬁcation of the cable. From the measurement, the
longitudinal loss can be estimated to be about 15 dB. This conﬁrms the information on the
datasheet with regards to the longitudinal loss performance.
Note that the measurement was conducted during a walk test, at quite a slow speed
compared with the speed of the ﬁnal users (inside a metro train). This slow-moving
measurement tends to emphasize the fading, as can be seen in Figure 4.26.
4.9 Tunnel Solutions, T-Systems
One of the most commonly used designs is to use a ‘T-feed’ system. This system has several
advantages over the cascaded system from Section 4.8. Signal distribution to the BDAs is
done in parallel with the radiating cable system. Each BDA is fed an input, and provides
output in both directions of the radiating cable. In the case of BDA malfunction, or a broken
radiating cable, most of the system will actually still work.
Centralized control and monitoring are done at the ‘ﬁber unit’ co-located with the base
station. This main unit of the tunnel system also feeds the base station with external alarms
in case of malfunction. Remote conﬁguration can be done via an RF modem or IP for easing
trouble-shooting and maintenance.

Distributed Antenna Systems
129

Even though the optical transmission and converters add noise to the system, T-systems
will often be superior in performance on the uplink compared with cascaded systems.
4.9.1 T-Systems, Principle
The principle for the ‘T-feed’ system (as shown in Figure 4.27) is that the base station
connects to an optical converter that converts the RF into optical signals. Using optical
transmission the signal can be transmitted over relative long distances with only limited
degradation compared with RF transmission over coax.
Each BDA has an optical interface and converts the signal back to RF, and then a power
ampliﬁer that transmits the radio power in both directions on the radiating cable. Naturally
the BDA has a reverse ampliﬁer and RF-to-optical converter for the uplink signal.
The example in Figure 4.27 shows the principle of a commonly used ‘‘daisy-chain’’
distribution of the optical signal, from BDA to BDA, thereby reducing the need for optical
ﬁber to only one link. This is a big cost saver if you need to rely on renting pre-installed
‘dark ﬁber’ from a third party.
Better Noise Performance than Cascaded BDA Systems
Even with the optical links, converters and ampliﬁers, the ‘T-feed’ system is often to be
preferred to the cascaded BDA solution (Section 4.8). The reason is better noise control,
mainly due to the fact that the cascaded noise build-up is avoided because the BDAs do not
feed each other, thus ramping up the noise ﬁgure.
4.9.2 Example of a Real-life T-System with BDAs
An example of the signal in a tunnel using a T-system for signal distribution can be seen in
Figure 4.28. The measurement shows about 2.6 km of a 4 km-long tunnel. As you can see
Figure 4.27
Radiating cable fed by a ‘T-system’; the signal is distributed via optical ﬁber and fed via
a ‘‘daisy-chained’’ optical ﬁber system to each repeater
130
Indoor Radio Planning

there are four BDAs servicing this section of the tunnel, each supporting 660 m of tunnel,
330 m in each direction.
The system was designed using a 1 5
8 inch radiating cable installed in this large square-cut
(about 4  6 m) concrete rail tunnel. The measurement in Figure 4.28 was done sitting on
top of an open diesel-operated rail trolley at 80 km/h (while I tried to cling on to my PC,
measuring receiver and a faint hope of continuing my life!).
The design level for this tunnel was 75 dBm at 98% area on GSM900 for the downlink,
measured in the open tunnel. The measurement clearly shows that there are areas that are about
5 dB lower than the design level. In particular, the handover zone, shown in the leftmost part of
the measurement, caused problems. The main problem turned out to be caused by the installer
having used 1
2 inch coax instead of the speciﬁed 7
8 inch coax cables from the BDA equipment
rooms to the actual tunnel (no equipment was allowed in the tunnel itself; this was restricted to
emergency rooms placed along the tunnel), and the cable route was longer than expected.
According to the installer it was much easier to install the thin cable! It probably was, but this
resulted in about 10 dB extra loss, not accounted for in the link budget. This is a perfect
example on how the practicalities of tunnel radio planning can hit you like a ton of bricks!
Do include a level of safety margin, but on the other hand, overdesigning will be
expensive. However, the reality is that in a tunnel most of the cost is related to installation
work. Therefore, 10% extra on equipment expenses will have close to no impact on the ﬁnal
installed project price.
By the way, it also turned out that the penetration loss into the train was about 8 dB more
than expected! So do remember to measure the penetration loss on the actual trains that are

supposed to operate in the tunnel, at the service frequency, and using a radiating cable
outside the train, preferably in the actual tunnel, prior to committing to any design.
The radiating cable part of the system in the tunnel was actually performing as speciﬁed.
As can be estimate from the measurement, the longitudinal loss is about 15 dB per 330 m.
This is spot on the data from the manufacture of the cable. However, unfortunately the extra
loss from the coax cable caused some concern and reinstallation of new 7
8 inch cable (at the
expense of the installer).
4.9.3 T-Systems with Antenna Distribution
Owing to the installation challenges using radiating cable and time to deployment, radio
distribution using yagi antennas can be a viable option. If the distance between the tunnel
wall and the vehicles allows, an alternative to the radiating cable could be to use distribution
via yagi antennas. This still uses the ‘T-feed’ principle, but instead of a leaky coax you
connect the BDAs to yagi antennas installed ‘back-to-back’, as shown in Figure 4.29.
You need to be careful though; vehicles, especially trains, will to some extent act as a
moving ‘RF-blocker’ for the signal. Make sure that there is only one train in each section of
the tunnel at one time.
For the link budget calculation, do realize that the longitudinal loss of a train can be very
high. Using yagi antennas, clearance between the train and tunnel is important in order to get
the signal into the users inside the train, by reﬂections through the windows. Luckily many
metro trains are quite ‘open’ from an RF perspective.
If the clearance is very tight and you have to rely on the radio signals to penetrate along the
longitudinal axis of the train, the penetration loss can easily exceed 35 dB to the far end of the
train opposite theyagi antenna! This will depend on the RF frequency and how many passengers

that the train constantly is service by two yagi antennas, one from either direction.

Installation Challenges
Special yagi antennas are available, mechanically designed for installation inside tunnels.
These antennas will often be totally enclosed in a plastic tube (random) so no dust can
degrade the performance over time.
Mechanical stress and reliability is a real concern, especially in rail tunnels, where there is
mechanical stress due to air pressure and vibration caused by the moving train inside the
tunnel. Special ‘tunnel yagi antennas’ will often have mechanical ﬁxtures in both ends,
making installation more stable.
Be careful with any hardware that you install inside a tunnel. If the equipment detaches
from the wall, it can be a hazard for trafﬁc and the users of the tunnel.
Handover Design with Yagi Antennas in Tunnels
One major challenge with yagi-distributed systems is the handover zone design, if the system
uses multiple cells. Refer to the following section for more details on this issue.
4.10 Handover Design in Tunnels
Large tunnel systems often need to be divided into several cells, especially if it is a rail
tunnel system over a large area. Therefore you need to plan an adequate handover zone
between the overlap of the adjacent cells that will insure a successful handover of the trafﬁc.
There are some basic parameters and tricks that are essential for a successful design
handover design.
4.10.1 General Considerations
HO Zone Placement
In a metro rail application it is worthwhile considering having the HO zone planned at the
station area, preferably in a well-deﬁned zone, with clear deﬁnition of the level difference of
the two cells at the center of the platform. This approach will have several beneﬁts:
 Slow moving trafﬁc: a train fully loaded with mobile users will severely load the signaling
for the two cells handing over all the calls. The network will have to hand over all the
users in the trafﬁc within a limited time window if the train is moving at high speed
(relative of course to the planned handover zone). Therefore it is preferred not to do the
handover at high speed; you need a margin for ‘retries’ (GSM) if the ﬁrst handover fails.
 Capacity overlap: having the HO zone at the station actually means that there will be
capacity overlaps from both cells at platform level where most passengers are placed. This
helps in peak load situations as both cells will be able to carry the trafﬁc.
 Redundancy of the radio service: if one cell is out of service, there will to some extent still
be coverage from one cell at least at the platform level, even if the preceding section of
tunnel coverage is missing.
 UMTS: for UMTS you need to be careful not to create extensive soft HO zones; ideally
only the platform should be served by both cells, not the whole metro station.
Distributed Antenna Systems
133

 HO Zone Size: remember that the HO zone size will depend on the speed of the train, the
HO evaluation and the processing time, and an additional safety margin should be added
to make further HO attempts, should the ﬁrst fail.
4.10.2 Using Antennas for the HO Zone in Tunnels
As tempting as it might be, it is not recommended to use antennas as the primary source of
signal in the HO zone. Antennas should clearly be used in the station hall area and pedestrian
tunnels, but in the HO zone for the train the signal from two antennas is much too
unpredictable and too easily affected by the physical presence of the trains or cars occupying
the tunnel. It is very difﬁcult to install antennas in the tunnel, in such a way that they cover a
well-deﬁned handover zone with clear signal margin difference between the cells in order to
make a well-deﬁned handover zone. If needed, the solution in Figure 4.31 could be considered.
The example in Figure 4.30 shows the potential problem: there is no clear deﬁnition of the
HO zone due to the fading pattern of each antenna. Actually there is a potential ‘ping-pong’
HO, where the mobile will HO actually do ﬁve HOs in each direction, before ﬁnally settling
on the new cell.
This will increase the signal loading by a factor of 5, and increase the potential for
dropped calls and quality degradation (‘bit stealing’ on GSM for HO signaling can be heard
on the audio of the call during HO).
Example, Problems in an Antenna-controlled Handover Zone in a Tunnel
A real-life GSM example showed the extreme case of the problem (Figure 4.30), when it
turned out that there was an average of seven HOs in one direction, and nine in the other.
This multiplied the signaling load of the two cells when a train full of mobile users passed
Figure 4.30
HO zone designed with termination of the radiating cables with yagi antennas
134
Indoor Radio Planning

through the handover zone. After many nights of failed optimization sessions of the
handover parameters, the problem was ﬁnally clariﬁed and solved by resorting to the design
that can be seen in Figure 4.33.
Controlling the HO Zone with Antennas
In some installations it is not possible to install radiating cable in the tunnel, so you simply
must have the HO zone work, even with antennas. The trick is to have a clear-cut HO margin
as a speciﬁc point, preferably symmetrical in both directions (as shown in Figure 4.31). The
clear-cut handover is assured if both signals shift their relative signal strengths a certain
point, and if both signals use the same signal path, in this case the same antennas.
The HO zone in Figure 4.31 works by offsetting the two transmit signals with a speciﬁc
margin, in this case 4 dB. By choosing other values for the tappers, you can design the HO
zone to the exact margin you want.
The signals from the cells are separated in DL and UL; the DL is offset in level, and fed to
both antennas. The receive signal path is the same from both directions or cells. Therefore

the HO trigger must be the DL signal level. This design of HO zone will have a good margin
for handover retries, should the ﬁrst attempt fail.
In a tunnel where there is trafﬁc in both directions, the HO zone is designed to be
symmetrical. However, you could do an asymmetrical HO zone design if that is preferred in
a one-way tunnel.
4.10.3 Using Parallel Radiating Cable for the HO Zone
A commonly used method for designing the HO-zone on a radiating cable system is to
overlap the cable from the two cells (as shown in Figure 4.32). This is a valid design
strategy, but it will take some distance (time) before the difference between the two signals
is large enough to trigger the HO margin. In addition, you need to apply the time for the
HO evaluation and execution, and time to retry the handover if the ﬁrst attempt fails
(GSM).
Remember that the serving signal level still needs to fulﬁll the design criteria, so in
practice you do not want to get below this level before, during or after the HO, or the
following attempts should the ﬁrst HO fail. Note that the signal from the one cell will be
gone once the terminator has been passed.
In reality this means that you will need to start the HO procedure 6–10 dB before you
reach the minimum design level, so the two adjacent cells in the handover zone will not be
able to service the same distance of radiating cable as the other cells in the system.
In particular, if you need to place the HO zone in between stations in a metro, where the
train is moving at full speed, you will need a long (expensive) overlap to the two cells per
cable in the tunnel, in reality doubling the installation cost in this part of the system.
The overlapping cable handover zone is a possible solution, but it can be tricky to design
and optimize due to the long overlap of the two cells. The two end ampliﬁers will be located
relatively close to each other in order to be able to power the long handover zone. One big
advantage, though, is the galvanic isolation between the two systems.

4.10.4 Using a Coupler for the HO Zone
The design that will give the best deﬁned HO zone is to use a RF coupler to connect the two
cells on the same leaky coax cable (as shown in Figure 4.33). Thus the two cells will have
the exact same fading pattern and coupling loss to the mobile. However, the system loss will
be different; this is the result of the coupler ‘offsetting’ the longitudinal loss at the point
where the two cells are joined.
Normally a 3–6 dB coupler is used, giving a 6–12 dB signal offset between the cells. The
HO offset is instantly applied to the serving and adjacent cell once the location of the coupler
is passed in the tunnel. The result is a well-deﬁned HO point. You still need to make sure that
the HO is performed before reaching minimum required signal level.
The roll-off of the signal is not as steep as for the overlapping cable example in Section
4.10.2, but you need to incorporate a safety margin that allows for handover to be retried
without the serving cell falling below the design level. There is only one problem worse than
a handover problem in a tunnel, which is a handover problem in a tunnel at low signal levels!
This approach has been proven during many practical installations, and is highly
recommended. But you have to bear in mind the DC/grounding issue when connecting
the two cells, and you might be required to install a ‘DC separator’ that isolates the DC but
passes the RF signals
4.11 Designing with Pico and Femto Cells
4.11.1 The Pico/Femto Cell Principle
The pico base station (as shown in Figure 4.34) is a very effective tool for deploying in-
building coverage at low cost on a standalone basis. It is a small device with integrated
antenna, typically designed for visible wall mounting in an ofﬁce environment. Most pico
cells will use IP for transmission backhaul, making the pico a very fast solution to
implement.

The output power from the pico is sufﬁcient to cover about 20–40 m distance depending on
the service requirements, radio design level and the environment where the pico is installed. In
most cases the Pico cell will need a local power supply, although some types can be powered
over the Ethernet cable which also supplies the IP connection. A local power supply can be
expensive, and often you are not allowed to plug it into the existing power group in the
building, but will have to install a dedicated AC group for all of the pico cells in the building.
Femto Cells
Smaller versions of the pico cells are starting to emerge in the market, such as the femto cell
(for UMTS). The femto has very limited output and capacity and processing power, and is
typically only applicable for residential use. The low radiating RF power and autotuning
features in the femto make it to some extent ‘self-conﬁguring’ in the network. However
careful tests should be done before deploying femto cells on a large scale.
Many mobile users are likely to compare the femto cell with their WiFi access point, and
might be tempted to ‘improve’ the coverage around their house by installing the femto close
to the window, beaming out coverage into the surrounding area. Consider this scenario: in a
building with 50 rental ﬂats each having a UMTS femto cell beaming out coverage on the
same frequency to cover the common outdoor facility even with the low power of the femto
cell it might cause a considerable noise load in the surrounding network.
However, even with these potential issues, the concept of using Femto cells in the network
for covering some segments of the market is often attractive from a network revenue point of
view, but it is a ﬁne balance.
The radio planning principles are the same as for the pico cells, just radiating with a lower
power.
4.11.2 Typical Pico Cell Design
The typical pico application is a small to medium-sized ofﬁce building (as shown in
Figure 4.35), where two pico cells are covering an ofﬁce ﬂoor. This could be repeated
throughout several ﬂoors. In the case of a building with several ﬂoors, be sure to place the
pico cells ‘symmetrically’, that is, in the same place on each ﬂoor – so that the one pico

Indoor Radio Planning

cell will not leak coverage to adjacent ﬂoors, creating soft handover zones or degraded
HSDPA capacity. Remember that pico cells are individual cells, therefore the ‘interleave’
concept (see Section 5.3.9) cannot be applied.
Coverage Overlap
As for any other multicell environment, you need to design for some overlap of the cells to
insure coherent coverage and sufﬁcient HO zone, but try to minimize the HO zone, by using
heavy structures, ﬁrewalls, elevator shafts, etc., to separate the cells.
Capacity Overlap (GSM)
The coverage overlap of the Pico cells will, for GSM, give capacity overlap and trunking gain in
the overlapping area (as shown in Figure 4.36). In the area where only one pico is covering, the
capacity will be 2.15 Erlang (GSM, 7TCH 0.5% GOS, see Chapter 6 for more details), and in
the area where both cells are overlapping the users will have access to both cells, by the means of
trafﬁc controlled handovers; if one cell is loaded, they can set up calls on the other cell.
Figure 4.35
Two pico cells covering an ofﬁce ﬂoor
Figure 4.36

Distributed Antenna Systems
139

This capacity overlap of the cells yields 6.66 Erlang in trunked capacity in the overlapping
area; refer to Chapter 6 for trafﬁc calculations.
Hot-spots
The capacity overlap makes it possible to cater for GSM trafﬁc hot-spots in the building by
deploying overlapping pico cells in these hot-spot areas. However, in reality these hot-spots
in the building tend to be dynamic and do not always occur in the same place in the building.
This makes GSM hot-spot design with pico cells a challenge.
Coverage Overlap UMTS
In a UMTS Pico cell application (as shown in Figure 4.37) with the same two Pico cells
overlapping with a margin of 3–6 dB, there will be a large soft-handover zone. If you are not
careful and do not limit the overlap of the Pico cells using internal heavy structures in the
building when planning the pico cell deployment, the overlap might cannibalize the capacity
of the system; remember that this is two different cells so you need both radio processing
and transmission capacity on both cells for one call in soft-handover.
Coverage Overlap HSPA
The two indoor pico cells (as shown in Figure 4.38) will typically operate on the same
frequency. Unlike one carrier assigned to UMTS R99 trafﬁc, HSDPA does not use soft-HO.
The problem is that the cells will cause co-channel interference to each other (‘inter-cell
interference’).
This will severely degrade the HSPA performance in the building. There will be HSPA
throughput in the overlapping area, but the speed will be limited as the two signals become
more and more equal. When relying on pico cells for indoor HSPA applications, it is of the
utmost importance to use internal structures and ﬁrewalls to separate the cells and to avoid
coverage overlap in areas of high trafﬁc. With careful planning, pico cells could be a very
strong and viable tool for indoor applications, but try to avoid using more than one pico in an
‘open’ environment, with high trafﬁc density.

4.11.3 Extending Pico Cell Coverage with Active DAS
The pico base station is a very effective tool for deploying in-building coverage at low
cost on a standalone basis. However, there are circumstances in which the coverage area
of the pico base station needs to be extended without increasing the capacity of the
system, in warehouses (as shown in Figure 4.39) and residential building towers for
example.
If you combine the small active DAS system from Section 4.4.3, you can extend the
coverage footprint of a single pico cell. The reason for selecting the active DAS is the ‘no
loss concept’ of the active system. The attenuation of passive distribution will degrade the
performance of both downlink and uplink.
In GSM applications you can also increase the capacity by connecting two pico cells or
more to the same active DAS, and letting trafﬁc controlled handovers take care of the
trafﬁc ﬂow between the two cells. You do not want to combine two or more pico cells for
UMTS or HSPA into the same DAS; this will turn the whole cell into a soft-HO zone for
UMTS or give co-channel interference in 100% of the area and thereby degraded HSPA
performance.
4.11.4 Combining Pico Cells into the Same DAS, Only GSM/DCS
In some pico cell applications, there are scenarios where a highly mobile user community
within a building that has several pico base stations can overwhelm the capacity of a single
pico base station system (hot-spot blocking). An example is when employees congregate in
the lunch-room. This situation can be improved by taking the same number of GSM pico
base station systems and feeding them into an active DAS system to cover the same area.
The results is all the radio channels being available in all of the building, leading to higher
trunking efﬁciency, more capacity available over a larger area (as shown in Figure 4.40) and
hot-spot capacity throughout the building.
Some manufacturers of GSM pico cells let you combine the picos into one logical cell
with only one BCCH, thus freeing up capacity on the individual Pico cells and boosting the
trunking efﬁciency even more.

Only for GSM!
Do not combine two or more pico cells for UMTS or HSPA into the same DAS; this will turn
the whole cell into a soft-HO zone for UMTS or give co-channel interference in 100% of the
area, degrading HSPA performance on the whole coverage area.
4.11.5 Cost Savings When Combining Capacity of GSM Pico Cells
There is a big potential for cost savings by combining the capacity for two or three pico cells
rather than deploying several more pico cells to cover the same area. This saves on the

 Saving on BSC cost (need to support fewer BTSs in the same building) – each BTS is an
‘element’ on the BSC, and subject to annual license fee.
 Saving on transcoder and interface costs.
 Saving on MSC costs.
 Saving on ASDL costs.
Fast deployment will provide savings because of:
 The concept of distribution pico cells via a small active DAS providing the mobile
operator with the ability to react quickly to coverage requests from customers.
 Less churn.
 More revenue.
 Easy and fast extension of the coverage when new areas in the building need to be added
to the system.
Operational savings will come from:
 The uniform coverage from the DAS system, which is easy to plan, implement and
optimize.
 The fewer GSM RF channels used in the building, with less interference leaking out.
 Detailed alarming on the DAS, which will limit down-time.
4.12 Active DAS Data
Active DAS systems consist to a large extent of ampliﬁers and repeater/BDA systems;
therefore it is important for the RF planner to understand the basic data of these system
components. Many of these standard metrics are used to benchmark the radio performance
of different manufacturers and systems. Make sure that the data you are comparing all use
the same standard benchmark reference.
The ampliﬁers used in active DAS, repeaters and BDAs have to be very linear, in order not
to distort the signal and degrade the modulation. The more complex the modulation used, the
higher demands are on linearity and performance. This is very important for the higher
coding schemes on EDGE, UMTS and especially HSPA. Be careful when selecting
equipment used for indoor DAS systems, since performance of the system is often directly
related to the price. The most basic parameters and merits are described in this section.
4.12.1 Gain and Delay
Gain
Gain is the ampliﬁcation of the system (as shown in Figure 4.41), the difference between
input signal and output signal power. The power of the output signal is:
output signal ¼ input signal þ system gain ðdBÞ; or input  gain factor ðlinear valueÞ
Gain is typically stated in dB. For a system with a factor 2 power gain, for example, 1 W
input (þ30 dBm) will lead to 2 W output.
144
Indoor Radio Planning

Power gain in dB can be calculated as:
Gain ðWÞ ¼ 10 logðgain factorÞ ¼ 3 dB; thus the output power will be þ 33 dBm
For voltage, gain factors can be converted to dB using:
Gain ðvoltageÞ ¼ 20 log ðgain factorÞ
Gain can be negative; often it will be referred to as attenuation or loss.
Delay
Delay is the time difference between the input and output signal (as shown in Figure 4.41).
In practice this will offset the timing for mobile systems. In GSM the timing advance will be
offset (increased), and the synchronization window on the UMTS base station network may
have to be adjusted wider to accommodate the delay introduced.
Note that you have to include both the delay of the active elements, and the delay of cables
(also optical) due to the decreased velocity of the propagation on the cable, for large systems.
dBm
The signal level in RF design is described as absolute power related to 1 mW (in 50 V) and
expressed in dBm.

4.12.2 Power Per Carrier
Ampliﬁers in active DAS systems, repeaters and BDAs are normally composite ampliﬁers.
This means that the same ampliﬁer ampliﬁes all carriers throughout the bandwidth. All
carriers share the same ampliﬁer resource; the result of this is that the more carriers the
ampliﬁer must support, the less power can be used for each carrier. The sum of all the powers
will remain the same, hence the name composite power.
Every time you double the number of carriers, the power decreases about 3 dB per carrier,
depending on the efﬁciency of the ampliﬁer. For an example, see Table 4.3
4.12.3 Bandwidth, Ripple
Bandwidth
Normally, when deﬁning the bandwidth of an ampliﬁer, it is the 3 dB bandwidth (as shown in
Figure 4.42) that is referred to. The 3 dB bandwidth is the band that supports the
ampliﬁcation with a gain decrease of maximum 3 dB.
Gain Ripple
Gain ripple describes the variance in gain over the bandwidth (as shown in Figure 4.42).

4.12.4 The 1 dB Compression Point
The 1 dB compression point (P1dB) is a measure of amplitude linearity. This ﬁgure is used
for deﬁning output power capabilities (as shown in Figure 4.43). The gain of an ampliﬁer
falls as the output of the ampliﬁer reaches saturation; a higher compression point means
higher output power. P1dB is at an input (or output) power where the gain of the ampliﬁer is
1dB below the ideal linear gain. P1dB is a convenient point at which to specify the output
power rating of an ampliﬁer.
Example
If the output P1dB is þ20 dBm, the output power from this ampliﬁer is rated at þ20 dBm
maximum.
Avoid Intermodulation Problems
Reducing the output power below the p1dB reduces distortion. Normally manufacturers back
off about 10 dB from the P1dB point: an ampliﬁer with 20 dBm P1dB is normally used up to
þ10 dBm.
4.12.5 IP3 Third-order Intercept Point
IP3
IP3 is a mathematical term (as shown in Figure 4.44). It is a theoretical input point at which
the fundamental (wanted) signal and the third-order distorted (unwanted) signal are equal in
level to the ideal linear signal (the lines A and B).
The hypothetical input point is the input IP3 and the output power is the output IP3. IM3
‘slope’ (B) is three times as steep (in dB) as is the desired fundamental gain slope A.
Unlike the P1dB, the IP3 involves two input signals. The P1dB and IP3 are closely
related: roughly IP3 ¼ P1dB þ 10 dB.

Testing IP3
IP3 is used as a merit of linearity or distortion. Higher IP3 means better linearity and less
distortion. The third-order inter-modulation products are the result of inter-mixing the inputs
by the nonlinearities in the ampliﬁer:
fIM3 1 ¼ 2  f1  f2
fIM3 2 ¼ 2  f2  f1
The two-tone test (as shown in Figure 4.45) is often used to test IP3. Third-order inter-
modulation products are important since their frequencies fall close to the wanted signal,
making ﬁltering of IM3 an issue.

The harmonic distortion (Figure 4.46) speciﬁes the distortion products created at integers of
the fundamental frequency; dBc means dB in relation to the carrier.
4.12.7 Spurious Emissions
Spurious emissions (as shown in Figure 4.47) are emissions, which are generated by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission or inter-modulation products.

The noise factor (F) is deﬁned as the input signal-to-noise ratio divided by the output
signal-to-noise ratio. In other words the noise factor is the amount of noise introduced by the
ampliﬁer itself, on top of the input noise.
noise factor ðFÞ ¼ SNRðinputÞ
SNRðoutputÞ
noise figureðNFÞ ¼ 10 logðFÞ
The effect of noise and noise calculations will be described in more details in Chapter 7.
4.12.9 MTBF
Failures are a concern when installing distributed active elements in a building. All
components, active or passive, will eventually fail; the trick for the manufacturer is to
insure that the expected failure is after the expected operational time of the system (as shown
in Figure 4.48). Typically there will be an expected lifetime of a mobile system of 10–15
years. It makes no sense to design systems that can last for 130 years that are too expensive.
‘Infant Mortality’
The manufacture will perform a ‘burn-in’ test of the equipment in order to insure that the
‘infant mortality’ is cleared from the shipped equipment.
Operational Period
For an active element, it is assumed that during the useful operating life period the parts have
constant failure rates, and equipment failure rates follow an exponential law of distribution.
MTBF of the equipment can be calculated as:
MTBF ¼ 1=ðsum of all the part failure ratesÞ

Probability of Failures
The probability that the equipment will be operational for some time T without failure is
given by:
reliability ¼ expT=MTBF
Thus, for a product with an MTBF of 450 000 h, and an operating time of interest of 7 years
(61320 h):

There is an 87.3% probability that the system will operate for the 7 years without a failure,
or that 87.3% of the units in the ﬁeld will still be working after 7 years.
This is a useful guideline to estimate number of spares needed for your installed base of
equipment.
4.13 Electromagnetic Radiation
EMR is a concern for mobile users all over the world. From time to time there are heated
debates in the media, but indoor radio planners need to stand above these often emotional
discussions and try to be neutral and objective. Above all, you need to accept and respect
that this is in fact a concern for the users, however unlikely you yourself believe the danger
to. You need to comply with any given EMR standards and guidelines that apply in the
region you work in and make sure that the indoor DAS systems you design and implement
fulﬁll the approved regulations in the country where the systems are implemented. Often
you will have to accept that a neutral party conducts post-implementation on-site
measurements in the building, and certiﬁes that the design is within the applicable EMR
speciﬁcation.
Different regions around the world use different standards and regulations, and these
regulations change over time. Find out exactly what standard applies within your country.
4.13.1 ICNIRP EMR Guidelines
Currently many countries use the guideline laid down by the ICNIRP (International
Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection), who are recognized by WHO. This
guideline speciﬁes the maximum allowed EMR exposure for the general public 24 h/7 days/
52 weeks of the year (higher levels are allowed for professional users).
A measurement speciﬁcation (EN50382) speciﬁes how these measurements should be
conducted and that a mobile transmitter must radiate lower than:
 900 MHz, maximum 4.5 W/m2.
 1800 MHz, maximum 9 W/m2.
 2100 MHz, maximum 10 W/m2.
The measurement should be averaged over 6 min.
Distributed Antenna Systems
151

Guidelines are different for different countries, and will be adjusted over time. Check
exactly what applies in your case; some countries apply a standard that is much stricter than
the ICNIRP levels.
You cannot relate these values to a speciﬁc receiver level in dBm, due to the fact that the
ICNIRP levels are power density, and therefore will be the sum of all powers on air within
the measured spectrum. Measuring in dBm using a test mobile receiver will only indicate
the speciﬁc level for that one carrier you are measuring, not the sum of power from all
carriers.
Example
This is an example of a measurement at a real-life installation of a DAS, using DCS
1800 MHz 18 dBm radiated from the omni DAS antenna, four TRX with full load:
50 cm distance from the antenna : 0:630 W=m2 ðaverage over 6 minÞ
200 cm distance from the antenna : 0:0067 W=m2 ðaverage over 6 minÞ
The measurement clearly shows that, in practice, you are well below the maximum allowed
ICNIRP levels.
DAS Systems Are Normally Well Below These Levels
Typical DAS systems, passive or active, are well below these levels. However, I have seen
examples of high-gain outdoor sector antennas, connected directly indoors to a high-power
base station, and users able get so close that they can touch the antenna! This is clearly not
a correct design; this ‘hot’ antenna might blast away, providing a lot of coverage in the
nearby indoor area, and most likely leaking out interference outside the building. In this
extreme case you could exceed the limits. However, common sense must be applied both
with regards to good indoor radio planning and for minimizing EMR from the indoor
DAS.
When you are being questioned by the users in the building whether it will be safe to work
every day underneath the installed indoor DAS antenna, you should always ask yourself the
question whether you would want to sit underneath that antenna 24/7 and design accord-
ingly.
Is it Safe?
Well that is the question; the current EMR guidelines are deﬁned with a large margin to any
level that might cause any known effect on humans. Often you will be asked if you can prove
that these EMR levels are safe. This is an understandable question to ask, but science cannot
prove a noneffect, only an effect, and until now no effect has ever been documented when
adhering to these guidelines for the design levels.
To use an analogy, we cannot prove it is safe to drink a glass of milk each day for 50 years!
Still we drink milk every day. We might be able to prove that milk was hazardous, if we could
conclude an effect due to a level of toxin found in the milk, but with no toxin found, there is
nothing we can do but to accept that it is most likely safe to drink milk.

Indoor Radio Planning

4.13.2 Mobiles are the Strongest Source of EMR
Most users inside buildings are concerned about the radiation from the DAS antenna, but it is
a fact that the main source of human EMR when using mobile phones is not the indoor DAS
antennas, but the mobile handset. This is due to the proximity of the handset to the mobile
user. Even if a high-power outdoor base station may generate 700 W and the mobile only
2 W, the determining parameter is the distance to the antenna. Having the mobile close to the
user’s head will expose the user to more power than would an outdoor base station even as
close as 50 m! Indoors the margin is even clearer as shown by the measurement just
documented in the example above.
It is a fact that the main source for EMR exposure is the mobile, and the trick is to keep
the mobile at the lowest possible transmit power. This is the only way to minimize the
exposure of users inside the building. The power control function in the mobile network will
adjust the transmit power from the mobile automatically, in order to insure that the received
signal level on the uplink at the base station is within the preset level window for minimum
and maximum receive levels.
This power control insures that the more attenuation there is on the radio link (buildings,
walls etc.) and distance between the mobile and the base station, the higher transmit power
the mobile will use to compensate for this loss. Therefore the only way to minimize the
EMR exposure is to make sure to keep the attenuation on the link as low as possible. The
more indoor antennas you have in the building, the lower the link attenuation is to the users
and the lower transmit power indoor users will be exposed to.
4.13.3 Indoor DAS Will Provide Lower EMR Levels
The effect is that, even in buildings very close to an outdoor base station, and where the
mobile coverage seems perfect, the mobile will typically operate at or close to the full
transmit power. The high downlink power from the base station might provide high signal
levels received by the mobile, but the power control depends on the uplink level at the base
station, and the mobile transmits at far lower levels than the high power transmitter at the
base station.
Indoor antenna systems with low attenuation will help. By deploying an indoor DAS you
can create lower path loss for the mobile to the base station, and the mobile will operate on
lower transmit power.
Less Radiation with Active DAS
Installing a passive DAS inside a building will to some extent bring down the mobile
transmit power, but it is a fact that the mobile still needs to overcome the attenuation of the
passive DAS, thus operating on a relatively high power even on an indoor system close to the
DAS antenna. The mobile transmit power obviously depends on the attenuation of the
passive DAS, but with 20 dB of attenuation on the passive DAS, the mobile has to transmit
20 dB higher power compared with the active DAS from Section 4.4.2.
By deploying an active DAS inside buildings, the attenuation between the mobiles and the
indoor antennas is low. The result is that the mobile will run at or close to minimum transmit
Distributed Antenna Systems
153

power. This is due to the active DAS being a ‘zero loss’ system; it is an active system where
all the losses in cables are compensated by small ampliﬁers close to the antennas. This only
applies to pure active DAS; using hybrid DAS the mobile will still have to compensate for
the passive losses prior to the HRU (as shown in Figure 4.18).
Note that power control is triggered by the received level, and the noise ﬁgure of the active
DAS will not cause the transmit power from the mobile to be adjusted up.
Example, Lower Mobile Transmit Power with Active DAS
The low mobile transmit power, using an active DAS system, is evident in this graph (as
shown in Figure 4.49). The graph shows the typical mobile transmit power inside an ofﬁce
environment vs the distance to the indoor DAS antenna.
This is a DCS1800 example, where the minimum received level on the base station is set
to 75 dBm, so the base station will adjust the transmit power of the mobile in order to reach
this uplink level.
On the graph (as shown in Figure 4.49), the pure active system is compared with typical
passive systems with 20, 30 and 40 dB of attenuation from the base station to the DAS
antenna.
As shown, the transmit power from the mobile covered by a passive DAS will only use the
lowest power level when it is located very close to the antennas, whereas the same mobile in

the same type of environment on an active DAS will stay on the lowest possible transmit
power even up to a distance of 19 m from the indoor antenna, and stay at a low level
compared with the passive DAS.
The mobile connected to the passive DAS will ramp up transmit power even close to the
DAS antenna, and this is due to the passive attenuation. This is evident on the graph, even for
the ‘low loss’ 20 dB attenuation of passive DAS.
4.14 Conclusion
It is evident that the mobile connected to the pure active system consistently maintains an
output power below 0.01 W, and the mobile connected to a passive system can easily reach 1
or even 2 W (as shown in Figure 4.49). Using a traditional passive distributed antenna
system will to some extent help with radiation from mobiles, especially mobiles being
serviced by antennas with relatively low loss, close to the base station room. However, the
fact is that, due to the losses in the passive system, the mobile has to compensate for the
losses in the passive cable dB for dB, resulting in higher transmit power from the mobile and
thus higher EMR exposure of the users.
Even if you often need to install an uplink attenuator between the active DAS and the base
station to minimize the noise load of the base station, it is clear that the active DAS will keep
radiation from the mobiles to the lowest possible power.
Both passive and active DAS will help bring down the transmit power from the mobiles, if
the alternative is to rely on coverage via the outdoor macro net. All mobiles have to apply a
certain radiation limit (SAR value), so even when operating on the highest power level, no
mobile is dangerous.

Designing Indoor DAS Solutions
Before starting to design the ﬁrst indoor solution, it is highly recommended to develop a
well-structured and documented workﬂow for the task ahead. This procedure should include
every aspect of the process from start to ﬁnish. This will insure a uniform workﬂow from
design to design, and make sure that all these solutions (investments) follow the same
process, helping to prioritize the projects and the investment.
5.1 The Indoor Planning Procedure
Operators need a well-structured procedure to evaluate the business case and implementation
process of indoor solutions. Often the need for an indoor coverage solution in a particular
building is initiated by the sales and marketing department of the operator responsible for
that particular area or customer. The procedure must include all aspects of the process, in
order to make it visible for all working within the operator: how, why and when an indoor
DAS is to be implemented; who is responsible for what part of the process; what documents
are needed; and the general workﬂow of the process.
There are many valid methods to use when organizing the workﬂow; one typical structure
could be like the one shown in Figure 5.1
5.1.1 Indoor Planning Process Flow
Brieﬂy, these are the main parameters: in- and output of the different parts of the process
(as shown in Figure 5.1).
Input from the Sales Team/Key Account Manager
The process starts with the requirements from the potential customer, preferably at an early
stage, before the customer starts to use mobiles on a wider scale. The sales team then
provides an application to get approval to implement a dedicated solution. There must be a
clearly deﬁned revenue goal.

 Number of users.
 Types of users.
 Types of service requirements, data speeds, etc., needed.
 Duration of the contract.
 Expected airtime per user.
 Expected on-site trafﬁc in the building.
Documentation of the building
 Floor plans.
 Markings on ﬂoor plan showing the coverage needed in the different grades and areas:
– 100% coverage
– 90% coverage
– areas where it is ‘nice to have’ coverage.
 Markings on the ﬂoor plan showing different environment types:
– dense areas with heavy walls
– open ofﬁce areas
– storage rooms.
 Pictures of the building (often photographs can be found on the company’s web page).
 Details and drawings of planned reconstructions or extensions of the buildings.
 Details for the contact person, who is responsible for approving the installation.
Floor Plans are the Base of the Design
Often it can be hard to obtain usable ﬂoor plans, but in most countries it is mandatory to have
some sort of site plan in A3 format located at the central ﬁre alarm, so that the ﬁre
department can ﬁnd their way around the buildings.
These plans often provide excellent basis for the planning and can be used for:
 Design documentation.
 Installation documentation.
5.1.2 The RF Planning Part of the Process
The RF planner uses the input from sales to make a draft design. Often this draft design can be
done by an experienced radio planner without doing a site visit. This of course depends on the
quality and detail of the input, the size of the solution and the experience of the RF planner.
The RF planner provides the following output:
 Floor plans with suggested placement of antennas and equipment.
 Diagram of the DAS.

159

 Equipment list.
 Estimated implementation costs.
 Estimated project time.
These outputs from the RF planner are used as the ﬁnal input to the ‘Coverage Committee’,
which is responsible for a ‘go’ or ‘no-go’ implementation of the solution. The Coverage
Committee, which is also responsible for the roll out budget for indoor solutions, has technical,
sales and marketing representation.
5.1.3 The Site Survey
Prior to the site survey, the RF planner has done a draft design, using a link budget tool, RF
propagation simulation and experience. To do the ﬁnal design, the RF planner uses the draft
design as a basis for a site survey, and adjusts the draft design according to the results of the
site survey.
The purpose of the site visit is to:
 Get the solution approved by the building owner.
 Collect information regarding equipment rooms, installation challenges cable ducts,
etc.
 Take necessary photographs for the installation team, and for the RF planner.
 Take photographs of rooftop ‘line-of-sight’ possibilities to other sites, if microwave
transmission is to be used.
Participating in the site visit should be:
The RF planner
 The RF planner is the project manager.
 After the survey, the RF planner will provide the ﬁnal design to be approved by the
building owner, and used by the installer.
 The RF planner might need to take measurements of the existing coverage provided by the
macro layer.
 The RF planner also might need to do RF survey measurements inside the building, to
verify the draft design.
The acquisition manager
 The acquisition manager is responsible for the constriction permits, legal contract,
etc.

 The installer is responsible for the implementation.
 He will provide ‘as-built’ documentation after implementation.

 The building owner will approve the design, antenna placements, etc., as the team walks

Process Control
It is important that all the involved parties, all members of the Coverage Committee and the
implementation team, are all working with predeﬁned timeframes, and well-deﬁned input/
output documents and procedures in order to control the process.
5.1.4 Time Frame for Implementing Indoor DAS
For a normal indoor planning process, the typical timeframes would be:
Sales/key account meeting with the end-user, providing inputs and documentation
1–2 weeks.
Draft design from RF
1–2 days
Site visit
2–6 hours
Final design and documentation
1–4 days after site visit
Implantation start-up
1–2 weeks after site visit
Transmission
Based on experience, it is often the implementation time of transmission to the BS that is
the show stopper. Therefore it is very important that the transmission department is advised
as soon as the solution is approved by the Coverage Committee, to avoid the typical
situation where an implemented solution is still awaiting transmission 5–8 weeks after
implementation.
5.1.5 Post Implementation
The RF designer or installer is responsible for doing a walk test of the system once it is
operational. The coverage is documented on ﬂoor plans, using post-processing software. The
RF designer should also contact the end-user, to check that the coverage is as expected, and
monitor the performance of the system using the statistical tools available, evaluating the
Designing Indoor DAS Solutions
161

live network data and checking neighbor lists, quality, capacity, etc. These results (the walk
test and the performance tools) are used to ﬁne-tune the RF parameters of the cell, enhancing
the system performance.
An important check point is that the trafﬁc produced is within the expected range, based on the
input from sales, and the RF planner provides feedback on the total performance to the account
manager. After 2 weeks, the responsibility for the performance of the cell is handed over to
‘operations’; after this it is their responsibility to monitor the cell. The RF designer receives and
approves the invoices from the installers, so he knows (and can learn) if the estimated price was
within scope, and be better placed to predict project costs for future systems.
5.2 The RF Design Process
5.2.1 The Role of the RF Planner
After we have had a quick look at the general process of the total indoor implementation
process, we will have a closer look on the design tasks for the RF planner; after all, this is the
purpose of this book.
Draft Design and Site Survey
Based on the design inputs provided by sales, the RF planner will do a draft radio link
budget and prepare a draft design prior to the site survey. Thus the radio planner can check
all the planned antenna locations, and adapt the design accordingly. Based on the
experience from the site survey, the radio planner will be able to adapt the draft design
to the reality and restrictions in the building, in order to make the ﬁnal design. During the
RF survey, it is important to check the type of walls, take notes on the ﬂoor plans of the
different types, etc.
Take Photographs
The RF planner should bring a digital camera, take lots of photos and mark the position of
each photo on the ﬂoor plan; this will help in making the ﬁnal design. It is advisable to take a
photo of each antenna location, in order to document the exact antenna location.
It is a good idea to bring a laser pointer, and point at the exact planned antenna location
when you take each photo. The red dot from the laser will be very clear on the photograph.
In the design documentation, each photograph is then named according to the antenna
number, A1, A2, etc. This helps the installer to install all the antennas in the correct location
and avoid expensive mistakes.
5.2.2 RF Measurements
RF measurements are a crucial part of designing and verifying indoor coverage solutions. It
is important to know the ‘RF-baseline’ (the existing coverage) both inside and outside the
building in order to establish the correct design level and parameters to use when designing
the indoor DAS.
162
Indoor Radio Planning

Log and Save the Data
It is highly recommended to always use a measurement system that allows you to log the
measurement data on a PC for post analysis. You should preferably use a system that can
navigate and place the measurements on a matching ﬂoor plan, and indicate the measure-
ment result by color or text.
These ﬂoor plans, with plots of signal level, quality and HO zones are also crucial
documents to prove that the system implemented fulﬁlls the agreed design criteria, and are
very useful as a reference for trouble-shooting at a later stage. These measurement results
should be saved in a structured data base system. This can be very valuable experience in
future designs.
5.2.3 The Initial RF Measurements
The measurement routes for the initial measurements needed in order to design the radio
system are shown in Figure 5.2. The ﬁrst measurement that is needed is the outdoor
measurement 1 in Figure 5.2, in order to determine the outdoor level and the servicing cells.
It is very important to determine the outdoor signal level in order to design the HO zone
between the indoor solution to the outdoor network. This important HO zone will cater for
the handover of the users entering and exiting the building.
Measurement 1 in Figure 5.2 is also used to estimate the penetration loss into the building,
when compared with measurements 2 and 3 in Figure 5.2, and can be useful to calculate the
isolation of the building. In this way you can estimate the desired target level for the indoor
system.
Measurements 2 and 3 in Figure 5.2 serve the purpose of obtaining an RF baseline of the
existing coverage levels present in the building. It is very important to establish this prior to
the design and implementation of the indoor solution, in order to select the correct design
levels for the DAS design, according to any interference from outdoor base stations.
Measure the Isolation
Using the measurement method described above, you can calculate the isolation of the
building and plan accordingly. Typically you will need to perform measurement 2 at least on

the ground ﬂoor, middle ﬂoor and topmost ﬂoor. In a high-rise building it is advisable to
repeat measurement 2 on every ﬁfth ﬂoor.
When designing a GSM system, you should design for dominance of the indoor cell.
When designing GSM, the indoor system should preferably exceed the signal level of any
outdoor macro cells present in the building by 6–10 dB. This will ensure that the indoor cell
is dominant and prevent the mobiles from handing over to the outside macro network. This
can sometimes be a challenge to fulﬁll, especially with nearby macro sites adjacent to the
building; there are tricks on GSM that ‘lock’ the trafﬁc to the indoor cell, even if the indoor
cell has a lower signal level (see Section 5.5.1), but it is preferable to solve the dominance
problem with careful radio planning upfront.
For UMTS designs these measurements are also very important. Based on the measure-
ments you should try to design the indoor system to be 10–15 dB more powerful, in order to
avoid extensive soft handover zones. It is important to minimize the soft handover zones in
the building to avoid cannibalizing capacity for more than one cell. In particular, hot-spot
areas in the building with high trafﬁc density should not have any soft handover zones.
5.2.4 Measurements of Existing Coverage Level
Measurements of existing coverage, penetration losses and veriﬁcation measurements are a
crucial part of the RF design. These measurements provide the RF designer with valuable
information to be used for the design and optimization of the indoor solution. In addition to
the initial measurements just described in Section 5.2.3, several other measurements are
equally important. There are several types of measurements that needs to be done.
Channel Scans
You should always consider performing channel scans on the same ﬂoors as measurement 2,
preferably close to the windows (or even open the window if possible), in each direction of the
building. A channel scan can be performed by most measurement tools using a test mobile.
Typically the user deﬁnes the start and end channels, and the mobile will scan and
measure all the channels in that speciﬁed range. For UMTS you use a code scanner that logs
all the decoded cells, scrambling codes and CPICH levels. The purpose of this channel scan
is to measure potential pilot polluters, ﬁnd unexpected neighbors and establish the baseline
for the noise level on the radio channel.
Example Channel Scan GSM
In the example shown in Figure 5.3 the test mobile has been programmed to scan from CH01
to CH33, all the GSM channels of the speciﬁc GSM operator CH1–CH32 planning the
indoor system, including the ﬁrst adjacent channel of the next operator in the spectrum
CH33. It is evident that the high signal levels of CH29 (43 dBm), CH06 and CH26 are
powerful. They are probably nearby macro sites across the street from the building. You
cannot isolate against these powerful cells, and so you need to take them into account when
deﬁning and optimizing the neighbor list and HO zones.
The scan is also useful to select appropriate frequencies for the indoor system. In this case
CH20, CH02 and CH31 look like good candidates to use inside the building. However, be
164
Indoor Radio Planning

careful; the reason for these channels being low in level could simply be lack of trafﬁc on
these channels at that particular moment in time. You must always verify the channel you
propose to use inside the building in the macro frequency planning tool.
5.2.5 RF Survey Measurement
In some cases you should also verify the RF model that is used to simulate the coverage in
the particular building. This is especially important for the ﬁrst 10–20 projects. By then you
will have gained enough experience and measurement results to adjust and trust the
propagation model you have selected (see Section 8.1.5) and your ‘RF instinct’ for that
particular environment.
Performing the RF Survey Measurement

two antennas is to use the ‘corridor effect’ to a maximum; using the corridors to distribute
the signal around the more solid core of the building and reach the users in the ofﬁces along
the perimeter of the building. Since the two antennas are placed in the same type of
environment, with a symmetrical placement, you would typically only perform veriﬁcation
measurement on one of the antennas.
In the example shown in Figure 5.4 we want to verify the location antenna A, and in order
to do so we must place a reference signal source there, a test antenna. The test antenna
should preferably the same type of antenna, transmitting at the same power as you plan to
use in the ﬁnal design. It is also very important to place the antenna as close as possible to
the intended installation position. Preferably the RF survey transmit antenna should be
placed in the ceiling in the actual position or at least as close as possible.
The location of the test antenna is very important because the performance of antennas
will be highly inﬂuenced by their immediate environment. The performance can be different
if it is placed on a tripod 1.5 m off the ﬂoor, compared with the real position in the ceiling,
upside down. This is because the local structures and environment around the antenna will
affect the directivity performance of the antenna and you want the RF survey to be as close
as possible to the actual conditions of the ﬁnal installation.
Preferably you should perform measurements on the adjacent ﬂoors under and above the
ﬂoor with the survey antenna installed. This is to establish the ﬂoor RF separation, which is
useful when estimating whether ‘interleaving’ of the antennas is possible (see Section 5.3.9).
Normally you will not take measurements in the area very close to the antenna or the nearest
rooms because:
1. You will know that the coverage in the area only 5–10 m from the antenna is good. If not,
it will be evident in the measurement results further from the antenna.
2. In many cases, measuring close to the antenna will saturate the receiver of some test
mobiles, and this will distort the real measurement results, e.g. one mobile might not be
able to measure signals higher than 40 dBm (GSM example), and therefore measure-
ment values higher than this value will only be logged as 40 dBm, and will skew the
calibration of the model.
5.2.6 Planning the Measurements
The planned RF measurement route must represent all areas planned to be serviced by the
antenna location. It must be planned to measure with a good overlap to areas where other
antennas are intended to provide service. One example can be seen in Figure 5.4, where the
purpose of the measurement is to verify the planned location of antenna A.
It is very important to conduct measurements close to the windows on each side of the
building and in particular in corner ofﬁces. These areas are prone to ‘ping-pong’ handovers
(GSM) and soft handover zones (UMTS) and this might lead to degraded quality due to
interference and pilot pollution. Therefore you must carefully select a design level based on
the measurements with special focus on these areas to make sure you can overpower the
macro signals, and at the same time avoid leakage of signal from the building.
It is also important to conduct a measurement outside the building to estimate the leakage
from the building. However, for obvious reasons, this can normally only be done during
166
Indoor Radio Planning

measurement of the ground ﬂoor antenna veriﬁcation. It will not be possible to measure
every antenna location on each ﬂoor; typically only one or two antenna locations are selected
in each type of different environment to verify the model used.
These RF survey measurements are a crucial part of the experience you want to gain as
indoor radio planners. After you have conducted a few of these measurements and analyzed
the results, you will soon gain trust in your model and experience of when to trust the RF
model. Over time you will be able to ‘see’ the RF environment, and will be able to decide
when it might be necessary to perform RF survey veriﬁcation measurements when designing
future projects and when to trust your ‘RF vision’.
Save your measurement results in a database, to gain a knowledge database of penetration
losses for future projects, and for ﬁne-tuning your simulation models. This will enable you to
do statistical analysis of the results in a structured manner, which is useful for reference and
for sharing experience.

When conducting these RF reference measurements it is very important to use a calibrated
transmitter and receiver-calibrated test mobile. A test mobile is similar to a standard mobile,
but it has been calibrated and enabled with special measurement software. This software
enables the user to perform detailed measurements on the network. These measurements can
be conducted in both idle and dedicated modes. Typically the user will be able to read the
basic RF measurement information in the display of the mobile. This will typically be
channel number, cell-ID, RF-quality, information about neighboring cells, signal strength
and data rates. The simplest test mobiles let you read this information in their display; more
sophisticated models let you save the measurements for post processing.
Log and Save the Measurements
It is important to use a test mobile that is able to save the RF measurements on a connected
PC. In addition to the propriety data format that enables the user to save the results in a ﬁle
for post processing within the software package that comes with the test mobile, it is
important that the measurement system software also enables you to export the RF
measurement results in a text format so you can import the results in standard software
like MS Excel. This enables you to do various post processing analyses of the measurements
(this is how the measurements in Figures 4.26 and 4.28 were documented).
Log the Measurements According to the Measured Route
It is highly recommended to use a measurement software package that enables you to import
the ﬂoor plan of the building where the measurements are being performed. This enables the
user to mark reference points on the ﬂoor plan, and the software then distributes the
measurement samples between the markers along the route. This might even be the same
software platform you use for your RF planning tool, merging it all into the same tool.
The navigation works typically by marking the next point you are heading to on the ﬂoor
plan, and clicking when you arrive. Then the tool distributes the measured samples between
Designing Indoor DAS Solutions
167

the points. Typically this will be the corner points all along the route. Be sure to keep a
constant pace from way mark to way mark, in order to secure an even distribution of the
measurement samples along the route.
Some of the simpler measurement tools only allow you input ‘waypoint’ markers in the
measurement ﬁle for the position reference. These tools will be alright for a measurement in
a tunnel, where you can use typical reference points such as 100 m, 200 m, 300 m, since you
know the direction is from X to Y (there being no Z in a tunnel) and, by keeping a constant
speed, you can log the results accurately to the position. However, for a measurement in a
complex building it is close to impossible to use only waypoints for reference, unless you
break the measurement up into many ﬁles, each covering a speciﬁc room in the building.
Do Not Bias the Measurement Results
Make sure that the measurement receiver for these measurements is in a neutral set-up. Do
not carry the measurement receiver upside-down in your pocket when conducting the survey
measurements. You need to be sure that the antenna is unobstructed in all directions, in order
not to skew the measurements. During the post analysis of the measurement, you can always
add body loss and other design margins, but the measurement must be done as neutrally as
possible.
When performing RF-survey measurements be sure that you use a clean RF channel in the
spectrum for the survey transmitter, so no interference from other base stations will distort
the measurements.
5.2.7 Post Implementation Measurements
After implementation you will also need to perform a measurement in order to document the
‘as-built’ system. This will also help you to ﬁnd any antennas in the system not performing
as expected. You will need to measure all ﬂoors on all levels of the building, preferably
measuring ‘edge-to-edge’, and do samples of all the different areas of the building.
These measurements can also help you calibrate your design tools and models, for future
designs. Preferably the radio planner will do these measurements at least for the ﬁrst 10–20
buildings, in order to gain experience of how the building, walls and interiors affect the
signal and propagation of the signal. A copy of these measurement results should be kept as
a part of the on-site documentation; this is useful for trouble-shooting on the system in the
future.
The Simplest Measurements, Post Installation
The simplest measurement you can perform on an indoor coverage system is to stand below
each and every antenna in the building, and average out about 20 s of samples, just using the
display of the phone. Note this result on the ﬂoor plan as a reference for checking the
radiated power from the antennas, using the free space loss formula to estimate if all
antennas are performing as expected.
You will also need to perform measurements of more locations distributed throughout the
building, especially in the areas where you expect to ﬁnd the lowest signal. Typical this
168
Indoor Radio Planning

would be the corners of the building, the staircases and the elevators. Do not forget to
measure the executive ofﬁces as it is nice to be absolutely sure everything is alright in that
area – there is no point in claiming that the indoor system performs to the required 98%
coverage area, if the last 2% is in the CEO’s ofﬁce! See Section 5.3.10 for more details.
5.2.8 Free Space Loss
Free space loss is a physical constant. This simple RF formula is valid up to about 50 m
distance from the antenna when in line-of-sight inside a building. The free space loss does not
take into account any additional clutter loss or reﬂections, hence the name. The free space loss
formula is:
free space loss ðdBÞ ¼ 32:44 þ 20ðlog FÞ þ 20ðlog DÞ
where F ¼ frequency (MHz) and D ¼ distance (km). The free space loss for some standard
frequencies will be as shown in Table 5.1.
As we can see in Table 5.1, the loss on 950 MHz is 32 dB at 1 m, and each time we double
the distance or frequency we add 6 dB more in free space loss (as shown in Figure 5.5). We
can also see that the path loss on 1850 MHz is 6 dB more than on 950 MHz. The difference

in frequency between DCS1800 (1850 MHz) and UMTS (2150 MHz) is only about 1 dB due
to the relatively small difference in frequency.
5.2.9 The One Meter Test
After implementation of the solution, one can be in doubt whether an antenna is performing
as expected or not. Often you want to connect a power meter or spectrum analyzer to the
antenna system to check if the antenna is fed the correct power level. However this is often
challenging due to the installation, with the antenna connector hidden above the ceiling and
difﬁcult to access.
Another issue is that this will still not check if the antenna itself is working or not. Often
you will not consider the antenna to be a likely point of failure, Experience, however,
documents that this is a common issue in indoor antennas systems. A very practical way to
test if indoor antennas are performing correctly is to use the ‘1 m test’, based on the free
space loss.
Performing the One Meter Test
To test if the antenna is radiating the expected power is simple; all you need to do is to apply
the free space loss. After all, this is a physical reality, and a good guideline for a fast,
efﬁcient test.
Example 1800 MHz
The test mobile measures 35 dBm at 1 m distance
The radiated power from the antenna ¼ 35 dBm þ 38 dB ¼ þ3 dBm
Note that some mobiles ‘saturate’ at higher signal levels. You will often need to ‘average’
some samples. The radiation pattern of the antenna also impacts the level, so be sure to
measure in the expected ‘main beam’.

Indoor Radio Planning

The One Meter Test is Not 100% Accurate
This method is not to be considered 100% correct, but it is very useful for a quick
veriﬁcation, and one can easily estimate if the power is off by more than 6 dB. For an
accurate measurement, however, it is recommended to connect a power meter or spectrum
analyzer directly to the feed cable.
5.3 Designing the Optimum Indoor Solution
The optimum indoor solution exists only in theory. All implemented indoor solutions will to
some extent be a compromise. It is the main task of the indoor RF planner and the team
implementing the indoor solutions to make a suitable compromise between meeting the
design goals, securing the system for the future and designing and implementing the system
to maximize the business case. You must also design the DAS so the antenna system utilizes
the features, possibilities and limitations in the particular building to a maximum, in order to
make the system applicable for practical implementation.
5.3.1 Adapt the Design to Reality
Even with theoretical knowledge on how to design the perfect indoor solution, the main task
for the RF planner will often be to know when and where to compromise in order to
implement the system in practice and still maintain an economical and high performing
solution.
The preferred approach when designing and implementing an indoor coverage solution
would be based on site survey with measurements, experience and the link budget. However,
reality often dictates that the architectural and installation limitations, and cost concerns,
play a major role in the ﬁnal design (as shown in Figure 5.7).
5.3.2 Learn from the Mistakes of Others
An old mountaineering saying goes like this: good judgment comes from experience but
experience is often a result of bad judgment! This is also true for indoor RF planning. There
is no need to repeat the mistakes of others, so let us learn from some of the most common
errors. Here are a few tricks to share, most of them learned the hard way.

Keep the Simple Things Correct
Indoor antenna systems are often complex and the radio services operating on these systems
are getting more and more advanced, with higher data rates and multimedia applications.
However, do not forget to focus on the simple and trivial things. These simple things tend to
be underestimated, but can have a major impact on the performance of the implemented
system.
Remember that designing indoor distributed antenna systems it is still ‘only’ RF
planning, and good RF design and implementation is often a matter of understanding
why you need to pay close attention to RF components that might seem trivial. You must
also appreciate the importance of the craftsmanship needed to install these RF
components and antenna systems so they perform as planned over time. Education,
craftsmanship and common sense of the installers make the difference between success
and failure. Even the best designed DAS will not perform better than the weakest point
in the DAS, and a small problem with a connector, for example, will have major impact
on the performance.
Use Only Visible Antenna Placement
Often the RF planner is asked if it is possible to hide the antennas above the suspended
ceiling. This should be avoided at all costs and you should refrain from giving any
guarantee of the performance of the implemented system if forced to accept hidden
antennas.
The main reason is the consequent unpredictability. You don’t know what is hidden above
the ceiling tiles: ﬁre sprinklers, ventilation ducts, heating systems, electrical wiring. Worst of
all, you have no post installation control of objects close to the antenna after the installation
of the indoor system has been completed. Furthermore you have no control of the RF
properties of the ceiling tiles themselves. What happens if the ceiling is repainted, or
changed for tiles of a different material? Aluminium ceilings are in fashion in some parts of
the world, and would be disastrous for the performance.
Obtain a responsible architect or designer of the building to accept and appreciate that
the antennas must be ‘visible’ for the mobiles. After all, mobile coverage is a crucial part
of the buildings utility infrastructure. If you are forced to accept installation of antennas
above the ceiling or behind walls, be sure to note it in the design document and contract
that the performance of the system is ‘best effort’ and not guaranteed due to installation
restraints.
Use Only Quality Certiﬁed Components
Again, the importance of the performance of ‘simple’ RF components is often under-
estimated. It is normal to focus on the performance of the more complex components in the
indoor antenna system, the base station, repeater, the active distribution system etc. However,
the quality of the simpler passive components – antennas, splitters, tapers, connectors and
jumpers – may have a major degrading impact on the RF service performance if these
components do not perform to speciﬁcation.
172
Indoor Radio Planning

Use Only High-quality Antennas
One example of how important the performance of passive components can be is the
‘standard’ 2 dBi omni antenna. This antenna is used in 99% of installations, and therefore
will play a major role on the performance of all the indoor systems in the network.
This ‘simple’ antenna can be obtained from various suppliers but the different antennas
are markedly similar looking – if you compare the data sheets they will most likely also be
similar in terms of mechanical design. Even during an RF test the antennas perform the
same, but how about 5 years from now?
Is there a reason for one of the ‘identical’ antennas to be more costly? Could some
antennas be copies, where one manufacture has not taken into account passive inter-
modulation effects, due to incompatible metals inside the antenna? Could there be degrading
galvanic corrosion over time? This will cause bad connections, and passive inter-modulation
(see Chapter 5.7.3), with serious degrading performance of the indoor system.
Small Things Matter
The same goes for other ‘simple’ components like an RF connector. Could there be a reason
why one type of connector comes at a cost of 1 euro more a piece? Could the more expensive
connector be a better option?
Please do not misunderstand me – there is not always a 1:1 relation between price and
quality. The statement is only general; be careful, and choose a manufacturer that you trust.
Look, feel, measure, test and judge if you trust the quality of the component to hand.
Disassemble the antenna, have a look at the internal materials: does it appear to be good
craftsmanship? It is not always easy to estimate, but in many cases you will get a feeling for
the quality.
Use Only Educated Installers
The craftsmanship needed to install RF systems is often underestimated. Use only educated
installers who are certiﬁed to work with RF components and cables. There is a huge
difference in doing a quality installation of a mains power connector, and then doing a high-
quality installation of a coax connector operating at 2.1 GHz. Did you know that manu-
facturers of coax connectors recommend a speciﬁc torque for tightening the connector to
insure the performance?
Make sure that the selected installer only uses qualiﬁed and certiﬁed workers, who
know what is needed to do high-quality RF installation. Also make sure that all the
installation teams have the correct tools to hand, and not just one set of tools for the ﬁrst
team and ‘knife and spanners’ for the rest! This might seem obvious, but often you will
have four to six parallel teams installing the same building to be able to do it overnight.
It is very important that each of these teams is equipped with the correct tools, the
correct connectors, etc.
Use of quality components, tools and installers will pay of in the long run. Yes, it might
seem costly, but it is worth the investment. Believe me, I know how costly it is to have all
connectors replaced in an operating metro system, after the metro trains are operational!
Designing Indoor DAS Solutions
173

Design Documentation
This is another example of a very important issue when designing and implementing an
indoor solution. For the RF planner it might seem straightforward to decide where to install
what, and obvious what the correct orientation is for that directional antenna at the end of the
hall. However, again, produce detailed design documentation and installation guidelines.
This will also help with future upgrades, trouble-shooting and extension of the indoor
system. It can be a hard task to reconstruct the documentation of an implemented DAS
system four or seven years after implementation, even for the RF planner who initially
designed the system. If the same RF planner is still around, that is!
The design documentation should be easily accessible on-site in hardcopy, preferably also
in an electronic format that is easy to update with future changes.
5.3.3 Common Mistakes When Designing Indoor Solutions
Often new indoor RF planners will make the same initial mistakes. Let us try to avoid these.
Dimensioning Coverage on Downlink Only
It is a fact that GSM indoor systems are mostly downlink-limited, so most focus is on the
downlink. However, it is important not to forget the uplink part of the design, especially on
UMTS/HSUPA, depending on the service proﬁle of the trafﬁc on the cell. Remember that the
Link Budget consists of an analysis of both the downlink and the uplink.
We will focus more on the Link Budget calculation later in this book, in Section 8.1.
Underestimating Passive Inter-modulation
Do not underestimate potential passive inter-modulation (PIM) problems. Especially with
high-capacity passive DAS with many radio channels in service, the concentration of power
in the cables, connectors, splitters, tappers and antennas close to the base stations can be
high. If you use low-cost, low-quality components, the impact of inter-modulation can be
high. We will take a closer look at this in Sections 5.7.3 and 5.7.4.
Not Accounting for Coax Loss
Many good indoor DAS designs have been ruined by the reality of the installation, often due to
underestimating the shear length of the coax cable, and thus underestimating the passive losses
in the system. The passive losses in the DAS have a big impact on the uplink and downlink
performance of the system. It is very important to use realistic distances on the cable part of the
passive system, in order to be able to calculate the link budget correctly. It is recommended to
have a safety margin on the coax losses, by adding 10% to the length of the individual cables.
Underestimating the Costs of the Installed System
The business case is a crucial part of any indoor design. A major part of the cost of an indoor
coverage system is installation costs, especially when installing a passive system using
heavy rigid cables, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive to install.
174
Indoor Radio Planning

In order to estimate the DAS cost when designing passive systems it is very important that
you know the exact installation challenge, cable routes etc. upfront during the initial
evaluation of the project. If you do not, the cost of the project is impossible to estimate.
This means that the RF planner needs to ‘walk the building’ before he can do the cost
estimate, and it is as much installation planning as it is radio planning.
There are many examples of passive systems costing in excess of several times the
initial estimated costs once implemented. This is mainly due to lack of knowledge about
the installation challenges of rigid passive coax cables. Other unforeseen installation
costs, such as lack of installation trays, reconstruction of ﬁre separation barriers in the
installation ducts and access to the building only at night, will increase the labor costs
signiﬁcantly.
Not Accounting for the Total Cost of the Project
Mistakes in the business case are often caused by not including all the costs of the total
indoor DAS. An indoor solution is much more than ‘just’ the cost of the indoor system itself:
 DAS costs.
 Installation costs.
 Maintenance costs.
 Site-support costs (power supply, transmission, etc.).
 Upgrade costs for future services and capacity.
 Planning costs.
 Backhaul cost.
5.3.4 Planning the Antenna Locations
The Inter-antenna Distance, Theory
Once you have calculated the link budget you can establish what the limiting link is, the
uplink (from mobile to base station) or the downlink (from base station to mobile). For
multilayer systems, i.e. systems where several radio services are sharing the same
antenna installation, this could be GSM and UMTS on the same DAS. There might be
some difference in the service range from the two systems, using the same DAS antenna.
An example of service ranges from different mobile services could be: GSM DL ¼ 28 m;
GSM UL ¼ 78 m; UMTS DL ¼ 23 m; UMT UL ¼ 21 m. In this example the determin-
ing factor of the system will be the UMTS UL, and the antennas should be placed
accordingly.
For the theoretical example, imagine that the environment inside a building is like a
uniform pulp of RF attenuation, with uniform attenuation in all directions and no
‘corridor effect’ or similar real-life behavior. One could think that the inter-antenna
distance of omni antennas should be 21 m as calculated to fulﬁll the UMTS UL limit
above.
However, if an area is to be covered ‘100%’ (there is no such thing as 100% coverage, but
this is a theoretical example), one could believe that the inter-antenna distance must be
2  21 ¼ 42 m, but this is not the case.
Designing Indoor DAS Solutions
175

In order to have coherent coverage throughout the area, the inter-antenna distance has to
be shorter than twice the service radius; after all, the footprint of the ideal omni antenna is
circular, not square (as shown in Figure 5.8).
In theory the correct inter-antenna distance for omni antennas is radius 
ﬃﬃﬃ

p
. This clearly
shows us that there is a need for coverage overlap between the antennas in order to provide
good indoor coverage.
Adapt the Antenna Placements to the Reality
In the real world inside a building, you will never have uniform loss in all directions from the
antenna. In real buildings the antennas will typically serve many types of ‘clutters’ and
areas, e.g. open ofﬁce space, dense ofﬁce areas, dense areas (stair cases), heavy dense areas
(elevator shafts). Therefore you must adapt the antenna locations to these speciﬁc environ-
ments when applying the link budget-calculated service ranges from the antennas to the
reality of the building.

In order to provide ‘full coverage’, antennas need to be placed with a certain coverage
overlap
176
Indoor Radio Planning

In practice, this means that you will have a shorter range from the antenna towards the
denser areas, whereas you will have longer range in the more open directions (as shown in
Figure 5.9). This is where the radio planner must use his experience and knowledge of the
building gained during the site survey to adapt the design to reality.
The experienced RF planner will use the calculations from the link budget. The calculated
service varies from the individual antennas throughout the different clutters and areas of the
building, and the antennas should be placed so that the maximum footprint is obtained for
each antenna. The antenna locations have to be adapted to the reality of the building, taking
into account the installation limitations of the individual antenna placements, cable routes
and antenna overlaps.
5.3.5 The ‘Corridor Effect’
One effect of placing antennas inside a building that is very important to know and utilize is
the ‘corridor effect’. This is the distribution of coverage when placing an antenna in one of
the most typical locations, the corridor (as shown in Figure 5.10).
This antenna location will give you several advantages:
 Typically there will be easy installation access to cable conduits in the corridors of the
building, which will save implementation costs.
 Corridors are often ‘static’ when buildings are being refurbished, so the antennas are left
in place with no impact of service degradation caused by refurbishment of the internal
structure of the building.
 The users of the building are less concerned about radiation when they do not have
antennas installed in the ceiling above their ofﬁce desk.
 You can use the corridor to distribute the signal from the antenna; there is typically line-
of-sight throughout the corridor, and this is what is known as the ‘corridor effect’.

In reality the coverage from a typical indoor antenna will be uneven in different
directions, due to the service of different environments
Designing Indoor DAS Solutions
177

The downside is that it can be hard to dominate the area along the windows at the perimeter
of the building. Be sure to measure the level from any existing signals along the windows, to be
able to select your RF design target level. In many modern buildings metallic-coated ‘tinted’
windows are installed, this will help in solving this potential problem.
The corridor effect is a strong tool, but you need to be careful when you base the design on
using this method. By choosing the optimum location for the antennas, the building will help
distribute the RF signal and you can utilize the corridor effect to a maximum. However, if
you do not choose the antenna locations wisely, the building can limit the performance of the
system. You must pay special attention when designing buildings that are planned as
multicell systems, and try to minimize the areas of the handover zones.
5.3.6 Fire Cells Inside the Building
It is important to remember that most buildings are divided into several ‘ﬁre zones’. These
zones within the building are separated both vertically and horizontally by the use of heavy
walls and metal doors. The reason for this is to contain any potential ﬁre inside the building,
thus minimizing the damage to property and people. The heavy materials used to construct
these ﬁrewalls or cells will typically also attenuate the RF signal signiﬁcantly when it needs
to pass between these ‘ﬁre zones’. This has a major impact on the antenna layout in the
building. In reality there must always be minimum one antenna inside each of these cells, or
else the ﬁrewalls will attenuate the RF signal by 30–40 dB or maybe even more. The
example in Figure 5.11 shows a typical building layout including the heavy ﬁrewalls and
proposed antenna locations. Note that two antennas are placed near the elevator to provide
coverage inside the lift. Lift shafts are normally heavily ﬁre- and RF-isolated from the rest of
the building, although an exception to this is the ‘glass’ lifts used in some open atria. Two
antennas are placed on the edge between two ﬁre zones and will provide service on both
sides of the ﬁrewall, thus saving one antenna placement.

Indoor Radio Planning

To perform proper indoor radio planning, you must understand the basic function of the
indoor antenna. The behavior and quality of the indoor antenna have major impacts on the
performance of the indoor DAS system.
Antennas Have No Gain
I know this statement is a bit controversial, but nevertheless it is actually true. For the indoor
radio planner it is very important to realize that antennas do not have any gain! How could
the antenna have any gain – it is just a piece of metal? The gain of any system is deﬁned by
the difference between the power you feed to the system and the output power; the difference
is the gain. Antennas have no gain; the antenna consists of no active elements. No power to
the antenna is supplied besides the feed RF signal.
However in all datasheets you will ﬁnd data relating to the ‘antenna gain’. In reality this is
not the gain of the antenna, but the directivity of the antenna, relative to the ‘isotopic’ antenna.
The Isotopic Omni Antenna
The ‘perfect’ theoretical omnidirectional antenna is often used as the reference for this ‘gain’
when evaluating the performance of real antennas. This isotopic omnidirectional antenna
radiates its power equally in every direction, X, Y, Z, as a perfect RF sphere with 0 dBi ‘gain’
in all directions (as shown in Figure 5.5), hence the name ‘omnidirectional’ – but this
antenna exists only in theory.
A
A
A

Figure 5.11
The inside of the building will be divided into ‘ﬁre cells’, separated by heavy walls to
contain any potential ﬁre. These walls will attenuate the RF signal, and in most cases you will need an
antenna within each of these ‘ﬁre zones’
Designing Indoor DAS Solutions
179

Where Does the ‘Gain’ Come In?
In reality the term ‘antenna gain’ refers to the directivity of the antenna, in the main beam
direction of the radiation of the antenna. In practice the term ‘gain’ refers to the fact that the
power in the main beam direction will be higher compared with an isotopic omni antenna.
The power will be lower in other directions. This relative difference in performance
compared with the isotopic omni antenna is the gain data that the manufacturer refers to
as ‘antenna gain’, hence the name dBi (the ‘i’ stands for isotopic). It is used as a measure for
stating the gain of an antenna. However the ‘cost’ of this ‘antenna gain’ is less directivity in
other directions; the antenna is actually less sensitive in other directions compared with the
isotopic omni antenna. Sometimes the antenna gain is stated in dBd, where the reference is a
dipole antenna. The relative difference between dBi and dBd is 2.1 dB.
This principle is shown in Figure 5.12, where it is clear that the perfect theoretical omni
antenna distributes the signal equally in all directions, and forms a perfect sphere. The
þ3 dBi gain antenna is directive, more sensitive in the main direction, at the cost of less
sensitivity in other directions.
The Installation of the Antenna Plays a Role
The radiation and directivity of any antenna installed inside a building will be affected by the
actual installation and local environment close to the antenna. Objects inside the building,
walls and other objects will attenuate, reﬂect and diffract the radio waves radiated from the
antenna.
In a large open hall the antenna radiation pattern from the omni antenna might look like
that in Figure 5.13. In this example three different omni directional antennas are plotted: the
isotopic omni, a medium-gain omni and an omnidirectional antenna with þ7 dBi gain. The
‘low-gain’ antenna is actually more sensitive below the antenna, and the high-gain antenna is
Figure 5.12
Example of vertical and horizontal directivity of an antenna
180
Indoor Radio Planning

more sensitive to the sides and will give less coverage in the large area underneath the
antenna. However, the radiation pattern of the antennas will be inﬂuenced by the size and
shape of the room in which the antenna is installed due to reﬂections from the walls. These
reﬂections will to some degree decrease the relative difference between the antennas.
However, in large open areas with high ceilings low-gain omni antennas should normally be
considered, giving more direct power to the mobile users. This is important to remember
when designing large convention halls, sport arenas, production facilities, etc.
Another typical example of inﬂuence on the antenna by the local environment can be seen in
Figure 5.14, which shows three types of omni antennas, with three different gains in the most
typical placement: a low ceiling corridor in a building. The directivity of the antenna is highly
inﬂuenced by the physical constraints and shape of the corridor. The corridor masks out most
of the antenna gain or directivity due to the reﬂections caused by the walls. Therefore, once the
antennas are installed inside a building, it is often hard to measure the differences in gain of
various types of low/medium/high-gain antennas that are stated in the data sheets.
Owing to installation restraints, it often makes a lot of sense to use a ‘directional’ antenna
at the end of a long corridor. This is to save on installation costs by beaming the coverage
down the corridor.

There is Only a Minor Effect of the Gain of Indoor Antennas in Reality
The previous examples show that, in a typical indoor installation (as shown in Figures 5.13
and 5.14), the shape and size of the room where the antenna is installed will have a big
impact on the directivity. The installation masks out most of the ‘gain’ of different types of
antennas; often there is not a major difference in level when comparing a ‘0 dBi’ omni
antenna with a ‘5 dBi’ omni antenna, but installation might be less challenging for the small
‘0 dBi’ type, due to the smaller size and less visual impact.
5.3.8 The ‘Corner Ofﬁce Problem’
When designing a typical ofﬁce building, it can be tempting to install a centrally placed
antenna in a typical small ofﬁce ﬂoor (as shown in Figure 5.15). This will often save on
installation and project costs, and the solution might even fulﬁll the RF design levels, but be
careful as this approach has an inherent issue and potential problem: lack of dominance in
the corner ofﬁces.
This lack of dominance in the total area inside the building will degrade the quality, cause
handover loads on the network and even increase the risk of dropped calls. The centrally
placed antennas will often compromise the isolation and quality in the corner areas of the
building. In many cases the corner ofﬁces are occupied by the most important users in
the building, those with the highest use of mobile services and highest data speeds. These are
the high-revenue users, and often these will be the users who will decide to shift to another
operator if the indoor service is not accommodating their needs in terms of performance and
quality. The indoor radio designer should strive to design for perfect service inside the
building, especially in these important corner ofﬁces.
Solving the Corner Ofﬁce Problem
The solution to the problem is easy and inexpensive, especially when the extra cost is
compared against the gain in performance of the indoor system, and the solution has several
advantages. In order to provide a uniform, dominant indoor signal in the total area, the signal
is split into more antennas, as shown in the example in Figure 5.15 to four antennas. The
signal from each of these antennas will be attenuated by the 1:4 splitter by 6 dB and cable
attenuation, but the gain by distributing the antennas is actually greater; they are now closer
to the users with less free space loss, and the distribution is providing a more uniform
coverage level and much better radio link performance. This strategy will provide:
 A more uniform signal.
 An improved RF link.
 Better data services on GSM, UMTS and HSPA.
 A more future-proof solution.
 Dominance, even in the corner ofﬁces of the building.
 Limited soft handover load on UMTS to the macro network.
 Lower radiated power from the downlink power close to the antenna, and so less EMR.
 Loweruplinktransmitpowerfromthemobile,loweringtheEMRexposureofthemobileusers.
 Extended battery life of the mobiles.

5.3.9 Interleaving Antennas In-between Floors
If the ﬂoor attenuation in the building allows it (this must be conﬁrmed by an RF survey
measurement), one viable alternative to the solution shown in Figure 5.15 could be considered.
The principle is to rely on coverage penetrating the ﬂoor separations, and thus only to use half
the antennas per ﬂoor compared with the solution shown in Figure 5.15. In this example from
Figure 5.16 it will take two antennas on every ﬂoor, and by using offset of the antenna
placement on adjacent ﬂoors, you can interleave the coverage from the antennas in-between
the ﬂoors. One antenna on one ﬂoor will leak signal to the adjacent ﬂoors above and below, and
vice versa. The result of applying this method is that the antennas, in addition to the primary
service area, will also be servicing the adjacent ﬂoors, as shown in Figure 5.17.
When considering this interleaving design strategy, it is very important to measure the exact
attenuation of the ﬂoor separation. You need to take this measurement in order to estimate if
this solution is viable at all. Only based on the actual measured attenuation through the ﬂoors
are you able to evaluate this approach. However, even after analyzing these measurement
results, it is highly recommended to add extra margin to the design, to be on the safe side.
Normally I would recommend covering everything from the antennas installed on the
same ﬂoor as the intended primary service area, and then only using the coverage from the
offset antennas installed on adjacent ﬂoors as ‘extra’ added coverage and dominance. Be
sure that the antennas from adjacent ﬂoors that might service users on other ﬂoors are on the
same logical cell to avoid handover load and decreased UMTS/HSPA performance.
Do not be tempted to crank up the radiated power from the antennas to boost the effect of
ﬁll-in coverage from adjacent ﬂoors; this might result in unattended leakage of signal from
the building.
Example of a Measurement of the Floor-to-ﬂoor attenuation
Utilization of the coverage that might leak in-between ﬂoors is highly dependent on the
attenuation of the individual ﬂoor separations; it is therefore highly recommended to
measure the leakage from ﬂoor to ﬂoor, in order to evaluate this design approach. You
must pay special attention to the layout of any handover zones between internal cells in the
building. This is to avoid large soft handover zones between adjacent cells on adjacent ﬂoors
and degraded HSPA service.
Example
One example of measurement results of isolation between ﬂoors can be seen in Figure 5.18.
This is a GSM1800 indoor system in a typical modern ofﬁce building with ﬂoor separation
of 30 cm concrete slaps and suspended ceilings 50 cm under the slap with 3 m ﬂoor height.
In this RF survey measurement the surveyed omni antenna is located in the leftmost part of
the measurement route in Figure 5.18. Three measurements were taken, all using the same
route on three different levels; one on the serving ﬂoor, one on the ﬂoor below and one two
ﬂoors below.
The measurement samples were averaged and it was calculated that the attenuation of the
ﬂoor separation was about 20 dB. This is valuable information when evaluating if you can
use the effect when designing the solution by interleaving the antenna locations in-between
ﬂoors, thus saving costs and increasing performance.

It is important to measure on all the frequency bands that are supposed to be supported by
the indoor system. The penetration loss can be frequency-dependant, so make sure that you
measure both GSM900 and UMTS if both services are to be used in the building.
Measure on all the Frequencies that are to be Used
If you only consider the free space loss (Section 5.2.8), it is a fact that, the lower the radio
frequency, the less the link loss will be. Normally, when you analyze the loss through walls in
a building, this effect would also be true, that the higher the frequency the higher the
penetration loss. However, be careful with concrete walls and especially ﬂoor separations. The
internal structure of the wall consists of a metal grid that has the purpose of reinforcing
the structure of the wall or ﬂoor separation. Depending on the mask size of this internal grid
structure, it will attenuate the RF signal in a nonlinear relation to the RF frequency. The reason
for this is that a metal grid with a mask size of less than a quarter of the wavelength of the
radio frequency will heavily attenuate the radio signal. Therefore it is very likely that a higher
frequency UMTS/GSM1800 will penetrate ﬂoor separations and some types of wall better
than GSM900. In practice, always measure all bands when performing this measurement.
5.3.10 Planning for Full Indoor Coverage
The behavior of radio waves and unknown factors inside buildings will to some degree result
in unpredictable effects on the radio signals. Therefore radio planning is not 100%
predictable. As we have seen in Section 3.2.2, the radio signal will have a fading pattern.
This exact fading behavior depends on the environment and the speed of the mobile. The
consequence is that, even with a very tight layout of antennas inside a building, it is

impossible to guarantee ‘100%’ coverage. You could get close to 100%, but it would be very
costly.
The standard term for full mobile coverage indoors is often referred to as ‘98% coverage’
deﬁned at a given RF level. With this deﬁnition, it is possible to do a RF survey measurement
post implementation to verify and conﬁrm the design level. Based on these measurements, you
are able to produce statistical evaluation of the measurements that hopefully backs up the 98%
requirement.
It is very important to deﬁne whether the 98% is deﬁned as area or time, or a combination.
It is equally important to differentiate between the requirements in the different areas of the
building. It might be alright to have 90% coverage in the basement of the building and then
have ‘full’ 98% coverage in the ofﬁces ﬂoors.
Coverage of 98% Might Be Perfect, or it Might Not Be
The term 98% coverage is after all just statistics, and it is important to realize that even an
indoor DAS design that fulﬁlls the 98% level can be a bad design. Depending on where the
last 2% not covered is located (Figure 5.20), it might leave the mobile users inside the
building quite unhappy (as shown in Figure 5.19) and with a perception of far less than 98%
coverage. It might be that most of the trafﬁc is located in the last 2% of the building with low
service (as shown in Figure 5.19).
The trick is to be very careful about where the last 2% is located. You can have perfect
coverage throughout the building, but if the last 2% not covered is located in the executive
area where all the senior management of the building is located, high-proﬁle users with high
airtime and high expectations of high-speed services (as shown in Figure 5.19), there will be
a problem even if your statistics show 99.2% area coverage.
Therefore, always be sure to note on the ﬂoor plan where the heaviest users are located, in
order to make sure they have perfect coverage and capacity. That one extra antenna installed
from day one on the executive ﬂoor just might be money well spent and save you a lot of
worries in the long run!
Also, in indoor radio planning, where statistics and reality can be different issues, always
make sure you meet the demands of the users. Pay attention to ‘service areas’ like the
storage room and the IT server room.
Achieving 100% Coverage
It is not possible to design 100% coverage, but if the users of the building can use the mobile
service everywhere they expect, then the user perception can be 100% coverage. Therefore, a
thorough and detailed input of the user expectations is very important. This input should
preferably be a ﬂoor plan with clear markings of where the coverage is important, and where
it is nice to have. This simple input can help in making a perfect ‘100%-covered’ design, at a
reasonable cost.
5.3.11 The Cost of Indoor Design Levels
Indoor coverage levels come at a cost – the higher the design level the higher the cost. It is
crucial for the radio planner to select realistic indoor RF design levels when designing
188
Indoor Radio Planning

indoor DAS solutions, in order to make sure that the solution can service the needs of the
mobile users. It is always wise to include some extra design margins to be on the safe side. It
is also a good idea to look forward to the near future of the solution to make sure that the
design can handle expected upgrades to 3G, higher data speeds or HSPA. This is a ﬁne
balance and the RF designer will need to make sure the business case is still positive. The

189

cost of excessive design levels can be high. The example in Table 5.2 clearly shows that the
radio planner has a big impact on the business case when selecting the design levels.
Do Not Under-design
Surely one should not under-design the solution, but it is recommended to use realistic
design levels according to the speciﬁc building and the speciﬁc area in that building. One
example could be that a 16-ﬂoor building designed for 70 dBm could be cost-optimized by
using 85 dBm as the planning level in the basement and parking area. In these areas the
interference from the outside network is much lower. You could have perfect quality using a
15 dB lower planning level in these areas, saving 10–20% of the system cost, just by
selecting realistic design levels in these low-demand areas. Use ‘the zone system’ in Section
3.5.6 as a guideline, but always verify with measurements.
You can gain a lot in terms of performance boost and cost savings by pinpointing the high-
use areas, the indoor hot-spots. Make sure you place the antennas in these areas where the users
need higher-speed services and good quality, and plan the rest of the antenna placements with
the hot-spot antennas as the base. By using that strategy, these areas might get really good
service, 60 dBm or better when serviced by the nearby antenna. You can then without
additional cost plan the rest of the DAS system so that you still keep an overall design level at
75 dBm in the rest of the area. The concept of ‘hot spot’ planning known from planning the
macro network also applies indoors. See the example in the Section 5.4.1, where we provide
really high data speeds on HSPA that can compete with WiFi.
5.4 Indoor Design Strategy
When all the measurement results have been analyzed and link budget calculations have
been completed, you still need to place the antennas in the building. It is one thing to
calculate the antenna service radius (see Figure 5.21) and the antenna overlap, but how do
you actually use this information to implement the ﬁnal design?
5.4.1 Hot-spot Planning Inside Buildings
The term ‘hot-spot’ is often used when planning the macro layer. A ‘hot-spot’ is a place of
high trafﬁc density of mobile users, needing special attention in terms of coverage, quality,
capacity and data rates.

Hot-spots also exist inside buildings and, like in the macro network, these hot-spots can
produce the major portion of the trafﬁc in the cell. Indoor hot-spots will typically be areas
where users sit down and work using their PC and mobile for an extended time. Most high-
speed mobiles are actually data cards in PCs, so naturally the user will use a convenient
sitting area where he can work in relative quietness. Examples of indoor hot-spots with high
trafﬁc density and high requirements for data speed performance could be business lounges
in an airport, the food court in a shopping mall, the press area in a sports arena, the
conference area at a hotel and executive and meeting areas in a corporate building.
It is highly recommended to place antennas in these areas, thus securing a good design
margin for future data service. This strategy does not have to be costly – often it is just a
matter of using the hot-spot areas as the base for the antenna placements, and aligning the
placement of the remaining antennas accordingly.
UMTS/HSPA Can Easily Compete with Wi-Fi
Hot-spots in public buildings will often already be covered by Wi-Fi service, due to the high
concentration of data users in these areas. In many cases the GSM/UMTS indoor DAS
implemented by the mobile operator will be a direct competitor to Wi-Fi service. Therefore
the radio designer must be sure that he places the DAS UMTS/HSPA antenna in these hot-
spot areas. By doing so, the UMTS/HSPA data service and even the GSM EDGE can
compete with the speed of Wi-Fi.
In theory, the data speed on Wi-Fi is quite high, in many cases stated as better than 54 Mbps.
In reality the speed servicing the user will be limited by the ADSL backhaul from the Wi-Fi
access point to the internet, not the radio speed on the air interface. Therefore in reality the
speed is often less than 200–300 kps. Sometimes, however, it is up to more than 2 Mbps.

Mobile data services are also more user-friendly. There is no need for individual charging
in the local Wi-Fi hot-spot and all charging and roaming on mobile data are settled over the
normal billing system. The mobile GSM/UMTS/HSPA data service will also provide the
user with total mobility, with handovers of data service providing a global coherent data
service.
5.4.2 Special Design Considerations
Even though most of the design methods and considerations are the same no matter what
type of building you are designing, special attention needs to be addressed to the type of
building you are designing the DAS for. These are some of the points we need to address, in
addition to all the standard RF considerations.
 Make sure you prepare for more capacity or sectors for future upgrades.
 Make sure you cover the executive ﬂoor 100%.
 Is there a need for elevator coverage?
 Are there special installation challenges (e.g. ﬁre prooﬁng)?
 Pay attention to the service rooms or areas (e.g. IT server rooms).
 Are there special EMR concerns (like in a hospital)?
 What type of services might be needed in the future – 3G, 3,5G?
 Are there any hot-spots in the building that need special attention?
5.4.3 The Design Flow
When designing large projects, like campus areas, airports or shopping malls, it is worthwhile
structuring how you do the design. Done correctly, you will get the most performance of the
system at the lowest cost and will be able to do a rapid, future-proof design.
Let us do an example of a shopping mall (as shown in Figure 5.22), assuming that the site
survey has been done and the link budget has been analyzed and calculated. Now you have
Figure 5.22
Antenna placements in a shopping mall
192
Indoor Radio Planning

an idea of the coverage range of the antennas in this particular environment and can start
placing the antennas on the ﬂoor plan. First consider the characteristics of the particular
building. In this example, being a shopping mall there will be some basic characteristics:
 All the shops are likely to have 100% glass facades facing the internal streets; therefore
there is close to no wall attenuation from the street into the shops.
 Be careful about open skylights with regards to leakage and isolation to the macro layer.
There might be nearby macro base stations leaking inside the mall in this area.
 Often you are only allowed to place antennas in the internal ‘streets’ of the mall.
 Capacity load can be extreme at peak shopping time, e.g. during sales.
 Prepare the system for capacity upgrades by dividing it into more sectors in the future.
 Remember the parking area, often subground level, and do not forget overlap to the
outdoor network for the HO zone where the users enter and exit the mall.
 Try to avoid placing antennas near the PA speaker system to avoid interference.
 Is it necessary to cover the areas with no public access, e.g. storage rooms or ofﬁces?
Those areas can generate quite high revenue.
5.4.4 Placing the Indoor Antennas
The recommended breakdown of the actual antenna placements in the shopping mall is given
in Figure 5.22.
1. Place the hot-spot antennas and maximize data performance. Locate the hot-spots for
data users; they will be the most demanding areas with regards to good design margin and
level. In this case of a shopping mall, the hot-spots for data and voice are typically the
food court, internet cafes and sitting areas. If there is a Wi-Fi operator present in these
areas, you can compete against Wi-Fi on data by placing hot-spot antennas in these areas.
Therefore all the ﬁrst placements of DAS antennas, marked ‘1’ on the ﬂoor plan, are
placed in these areas, forming the reference for the next step in the design phase.
2. Place the ‘cost-cutting’ antennas. After the hot-spot antennas are placed you must place
all the antennas that will maximize the coverage per antenna, marked ‘2’ on the ﬂoor
plan. By using the ‘corridor effect’, you can maximize the coverage of each of these
antennas. You place these antennas in all the intersections of the internal streets of the
mall so that the coverage will be spread in the directions of the internal streets, which will
give good value for money.
3. Isolate the building. Dominance and well-deﬁned HO zones along the perimeter and the
entrances of the shopping mall are secured by the placement of the antennas marked ‘3’.
These antennas will often be directional antennas pointing towards the center of the
building as the preferred solution. This will isolate the building from even very close
outdoor sites.
4. Fill in the gaps. The last placement of antennas will be ‘ﬁlling the gaps’ between the
antennas just placed. It is often necessary to place an antenna in big shops inside the mall, if
you are allowed that is. Normally installation of antennas in shopping malls is restricted to
the internal streets. Therefore it can be hard to cover deep inside the larger shops; try to
cover them as much as possible by having more antennas in the internal streets of the
shopping mall.

5.5 Handover Considerations Inside Buildings
It is important to make sure that the indoor DAS system implemented in the building is
prepared for future trafﬁc growth. The best way to prepare this is to have a sector plan for
future sectorization of the system. Even if the system is implemented as one sector, you need
to look ahead, especially for UMTS, in order to prepare for more sectors.
Well-deﬁned HO zones are important for GSM and UMTS/HSDPA to avoid ‘ping-pong’
HO on GSM, extensive soft HO zones on UMTS and degraded HSPA performance. The
focus should be on well-deﬁned and controlled handover zones, preferably placed in areas
with low trafﬁc in the building. When the DAS is designed and implemented correctly, the
dominance and isolation of the indoor system will insure well-deﬁned handover zones to the
outdoor macro network. However, in extreme cases, like a rooftop site on the neighboring
building, you will sometimes have to deal with some signal leaking inside the building, even
with high signal level from the indoor system.
As a general rule you must try to avoid having the handover zones in large open areas inside
the building. Here it can be difﬁcult to design and control the handover zone. Try to take
advantage of the natural isolation provided by the building to separate the different sectors or
cells. This can be done by using the ﬂoor separations as the handover border, or the ﬁre
separation zones inside the building (Section 5.3.6). Typically these ﬁre zones will be divided by
heavy walls with high RF isolation, which are perfect for giving a well-deﬁned handover zone.
5.5.1 Indoor GSM Handover Planning
It is important to realize that the handover control parameters are a crucial part of the indoor
design and, in order to optimize the implemented solution, these parameters must be tuned.
The typical handover scenario in a GSM multicell building is shown in Figure 5.23. This is a
multicell indoor system with a total of ﬁve cells. Well-deﬁned handover zones between the
internal cells in the building are a must, and in this case the primary handover between the
internal cells are done via cell-5, which also serves the elevator, so no handovers will occur
when using the elevator. Even with cell-5 as the normal internal handover cell, there are
deﬁned handovers to the internal adjacent cells, just in case cell-5 is full and cannot tender
for the handover between adjacent cells.
Limit the Number of Macro Handover Candidates
Normally the internal cells in the building are limited to only having deﬁned handovers to
nearby adjacent indoor cells within the building. This to prevent those mobiles typical in the
topmost part of the building starting to make handovers to distant macro sites via nearby macro
sites. This is a common problem. The mobile might ﬁnally end up on a distant macro cell that
has no neighbor relations back to the indoor cell. The consequence is often dropped calls when
the users move from the perimeter at the windows back to the center of the building.
Keep Idle Mode Trafﬁc on the Indoor Cells
In GSM idle mode the mobile can be controlled with special cell offset parameters. You must
make sure that the mobile will camp on the indoor cell, even if nearby macro sites are leaking
194
Indoor Radio Planning

high-level signal inside the building. In practice, you use a combination of the lowest allowed
Rx access level on the mobile (RxLevAccessMin); in this example in Figure 5.23, it is set
to 90 dBm. Then by applying a cell offset (C2), for example, of 40 dB, the mobile will add
40 dB to the evaluation of the cell once the cell is received more strongly than 90 dBm. The
result is that the mobile evaluates the cell to be 90 þ 40 ¼ 50 dBm receive level.
This is very useful in keeping the mobiles on the indoor cell in idle mode; you can thus
dominate in areas with really high macro level leaking in the building. In addition, you can
use temporary offsets and time penalty periods; this also makes it a very useful tool to
control the trafﬁc if the indoor cell leaks out onto the nearby street.
Deﬁne ‘Emergency’ HO Candidates
It will always be a good idea to make sure you deﬁne a ‘one-way’ connection back to the indoor
cell if mobiles should camp unintended on the nearby outdoor cell. In extreme trafﬁc situations
where the indoor cell might be congested, it can be a good idea to have trafﬁc-controlled HO to
the nearby macro site, in order to unload the indoor cell and avoid capacity blocking of calls.
Handover Zone to the Macro Network
It is very important to have a well-deﬁned transit handover zone to and from the building.
Normally this zone is around the main entrance and the entrance to the indoor parking area.
Figure 5.23
The typical GSM handover scenario in a building
Designing Indoor DAS Solutions
195

Only the cell(s) covering the entrance or exit of the building should have normal HO
connections to the outdoor network and preferably to a very limited number of outdoor cells
in order to ease the optimization of the handover zone.
For GSM applications it is recommended to make sure you do not pick up any outdoor
trafﬁc on the indoor system, by outdoor mobile users close to the building. The handover
parameter should be tuned in order to insure that the handover takes place just inside the
building.
5.5.2 Indoor UMTS Handover Planning
In GSM there is some margin of offsets that can be applied in order to tune the HO zones and
areas. Adjacent UMTS cells will typically use the same frequency; the mobile has to be in
soft HO as soon as it is able to decode more cells. If not, the adjacent cells will cause
interference, degraded performance and dropped calls. Therefore there is not a large margin
for tuning the UMTS handover and only good radio planning will do the job.
The typical handover scenario in a UMTS multicell building is shown in Figure 5.24. This
is a multicell indoor system with a total of ﬁve cells. Well-deﬁned handover zones between
the internal cells in the building are a must to limit the soft handover load; in this case the
primary handover between the internal cells is done via cell-5. Cell-5 also serves the elevator
as the only cell, avoiding soft handovers in the elevator.
Figure 5.24
The typical UMTS soft handover scenario in a building
196
Indoor Radio Planning

However, you must also be sure to deﬁne handovers to the internal adjacent cells, in order
to perform soft handover in the limited areas where two cells might cover the same area.
Keep those areas to a minimum.
Good UMTS RF Planning is the Solution
The best way to optimize the handover zones on UMTS is by good RF planning, correct antenna
placement and careful attention to the handover zone planning from the initial design phase. The
solution is once again to provide dominance of the indoor cells and isolation between the cells.
This is the correct way to control the handover performance and to limit soft handover zones.
To some extent the CPICH (pilot channel) power can be used in order to offset the cell
sizes, thereby moving the soft handover zone slightly. However, the effect is fairly limited,
compared with the freedom of parameter settings for tuning the handovers on GSM.
The use of separate frequencies for the outdoor and indoor network can be a solution in
some extreme cases, but these hard handovers are often a challenge for the network as well
as many mobiles. Operators are typical assigned two or three RF channels for UMTS, so
spectrum- and capacity-wise this is a very expensive solution and should only be considered
as a last temporary resort, until the real problem can be solved or the macro sector removed.
Furthermore you might not be able to allocate a new RF channel for HSDPA, and HSDPA
will take a big hit from co-channel interference from the macro cell, degrading the speed and
performance.
The HO Zone to the Outdoor Network
Obviously there needs to be a handover zone to the outdoor network designed in the entrance
areas of the building. A well-deﬁned HO zone to the outdoor network is important, and on
UMTS it can be wise to consider having the soft HO just outside the entrance of the building.
The reason for this is that, if the soft HO occurs inside the building, it is likely the mobile will
be running on high transmit power in order to reach the outdoor cell. This ‘noise’ generated by
the high power mobile will raise the noise level on the UL of the indoor cell, thus cannibalizing
the capacity of the indoor cell. This can be a big issue when designing high-capacity indoor
solutions with many users at the entrance of the building or shopping mall.
5.5.3 Handover Zone Size
When designing handover zones it is importantthat youtake thespeed of thetrafﬁc into account.
Furthermore, you need to make sure that you include a safety margin in order to make several
handover attempts, should the ﬁrst attempt fail. The handover zone must accommodate this
safety margin, and you must make sure that you keep the coverage design level throughout the
full size of the handover zone. The last thing you want to encounter is problems with handover
retries once you are below design level. That is a sure recipe for disaster and dropped calls.
Example, HO Zone Size
If you use a HO time of 4 s as an example, you can evaluate the size of the needed HO zone.
If a car moves at 30 km/h out of the underground parking area (8.33 m/s), you would need a
HO zone of 33 m.

Example, Handover Zone Safety Margin
As pointed out earlier in this chapter, it is not enough to design the handover zone to the
minimum size. You must provide the mobile enough time to perform cell decoding,
measurement, evaluation and handover execution of both cells at the same time.
The signaling load of the cells can also be an issue. This is normally not a concern when
designing indoor solutions: indoor cells will typically only have to perform a few handovers
simultaneously. However, there are cases that might demand consideration of the signaling
load of many simultaneous handovers; consider a tunnel scenario where a train is moving at
relatively high speed, and inside the train there might be 40 users in trafﬁc performing
handover at the same time. In this case you must certainly include a safety margin in the
handover zone size. In addition GSM offers some presynchronization functionalities or
‘chained’ cells. On GSM, UMTS and HSPA it is recommended to have the two cells in the
critical handover zone serviced from the same base station. This will increase the handover
success rate and load the network far less for these critical handover types.
5.6 Elevator Coverage
Mobile users inside a building expect a good quality coherent service level throughout the
building, the elevators included. It is a major challenge to service elevators with RF
coverage, and requires special consideration. Most elevator lift-cars are a virtual metal
enclosure with very high RF attenuation, often exceeding 60 dB. The speed of the elevator
adds to the challenge, especially in very high buildings with high-speed express elevators.
However, the demand for mobile coverage inside elevators is growing, primarily motivated
by the normal requirement for voice and data coverage everywhere. The mobile is also
considered as an extra security line by the users, even though there is an emergency phone
installed inside most lifts. Therefore mobile coverage inside elevators is a must.
There are several options on how to provide mobile coverage in the elevator; the optimum
approach depends on the individual solution and the constraints of the actual elevator
installation. The best mobile performance is achieved if the RF design is done so that there
will only be one dominant cell covering the elevators throughout the building, thereby avoiding
handovers inside the lift. However providing sufﬁcient coverage inside the lift-car can be a
challenge and sometimes close to impossible, due to the metallic enclosure of the lift-car.
In small to medium-sized buildings it might be preferable not to have a dedicated cell for
the elevator only, but to use one of the existing cells in the building. In that case it is
recommended to use the topmost cell in the building to service the elevator shaft as well as
the indoor area.
5.6.1 Elevator Installation Challenges
To obtain approval and permission to place any equipment in the shaft that is not related to
the operation of the elevator itself can be difﬁcult. If you want to install antennas inside the
elevator shaft or in the elevator car itself, you will often need special approval of the cable
types and all other equipment used, and issues related to ﬁre rating and mechanical stress
need to be cleared and certiﬁed. Always check and make sure you follow the installation
rules and guidelines in the speciﬁc elevator in the speciﬁc building.

5.6.2 The Most Common Coverage Elevator Solution
The most used design when covering elevators is to place antennas close to the elevator shaft
on each ﬂoor, preferably in the lift lobby with the antenna 1–2 m from the lift door [as shown
in Figure 5.25(a)]. Often this design will work ﬁne, especially in small buildings with only
one sector/cell covering the building. For larger buildings with more sectors you must be
careful using this approach, and be sure not to create a handover zone inside the lift.
The situation is shown in Figure 5.26(a), where the potential problem is evident. The
handover zone must be designed just outside the lift shaft [as shown in Figure 5.25(b)], in
order to avoid handovers inside the lift-car when moving at high speed.
5.6.3 Antenna Inside the Shaft
This design is shown in Figure 5.26(a), with the antenna mounted in the lift shaft, most
commonly at the top, but it is also possible to have the antenna in the bottom and beam
upwards. Sometimes a bidirectional antenna mounted in the middle of the shaft can be
considered; it all depends on penetration losses into the lift-car and the height of the
building. For larger buildings, a combination of these antenna placements can be
considered.
Often the antenna inside the lift shaft has to be placed on a small bracket mounted on a
door to the elevator shaft. Thus you access the antenna by just opening the door from outside
the shaft. This provides easy access to the antenna without accessing the shaft itself; in that
case it is easy to install cables and other equipment on the outside of the shaft. This will limit
Figure 5.25
The typical way to provide elevator coverage
Designing Indoor DAS Solutions
199

the equipment inside the shaft to only the antenna. This approach might make it easier to
achieve the approval for implementing coverage in the shaft.
Be careful in very high buildings, as sometimes elevators come in two levels! One
elevator-car might actually be serving both even- and uneven-numbered ﬂoors at the same
time; you will have two levels of users inside the elevator. In that case it will be very difﬁcult
to cover the lower-most lift-car from an antenna in the top of the lift-car. A new variant of
this type of twin elevators is to have two cars moving independently in the same shaft. In this
case you need to cover the shaft from both the top and bottom of the shaft.
Special consideration needs to be given to the other cells in the building, and dedicated
attention to the layout of the handover zones is advisable. Often the antennas in elevator
shafts will be designed to radiate high power levels in order to penetrate the elevator-car.
However, be careful that this high level of signal inside the lift shaft does not leak out to the
ofﬁce area nearby the elevator lobby.
I have seen problems with this type of design, where all users within 20 m of the elevator
lobby handed over to the elevator cell once the elevator doors opened, and were then
dropped once the doors closed again, due to the abrupt loss of signal and lack of time to
handover back to the ofﬁce cell.
5.6.4 Repeater in the Lift-car
You could also consider installing a RF-repeater on the lift-car, using an external antenna on
the top of the car and a small antenna inside the car. In combination with the shaft antenna
installed in the top of the shaft, this can be a good solution, but you need to be careful with
the gain settings on the repeater. Preferably you should conﬁgure the repeater settings so it
Figure 5.26
Two options for covering the elevator
200
Indoor Radio Planning

just compensates for the penetration loss of the lift-car. If you use too high a gain you might
saturate the mobile and the base station when the lift-car is close to the shaft antenna on the
topmost ﬂoors. On UMTS this might have a serious impact on all the trafﬁc in the cell, so
caution is advised.
5.6.5 DAS Antenna in the Lift-car
Recently it has been possible to install an antenna inside the moving lift-car [as shown in
Figure 5.26(b)], as a part of the active DAS (Section 4.4.2). This antenna will be connected
to the active DAS system of the building like all the other antennas. This option, however, is
only possible when using pure active DAS. The active DAS relies on thin cabling to the
remote antenna unit that services the antenna. This cable will typically be CAT5 (LAN
cables) or CATV (cable TV cable), similar to the cables that are already being used to
service the lift-car, for control, communication and CCTV. By using similar cables to those
already installed to service the elevator, it is easier to get permission to install the DAS
antenna in the lift-car. The big advantage of this approach is full control of the RF
environment inside the lift and control of the zones.
The DAS antennas must be set to a very low output signal level, and you must be sure to
use a version that can handle mobiles not in power control close to the antenna radiating at
high power. Remember that some mobiles inside the lift are not being serviced by the
elevator antenna, but by the nearby macro site of the competing operator. Hence these users
are likely to transmit at full power and saturate the antenna unit in the active DAS installed
in the elevator. Therefore it is recommended to install an attenuator between the antenna unit
and the DAS antenna inside the lift. This attenuator (20–30 dB) will add sufﬁcient link loss
and prevent this potential problem.
5.6.6 Passive Repeaters in Elevators
Sometimes you get the question, ‘why not just mount two antennas back-to-back just
connected via the cable, one antenna on top of the lift-car, the other inside the lift?’ Let us
have a look at the set-up of this concept in Figure 5.27. First of all, we know that the free space
loss in this example of GSM 1800 MHz will be 38 dB at 1 m from an antenna. Applying the
free space loss, we can calculate the system gain of the passive repeater system. From 1 m in
front of the donor antenna to 1 m in front of the service antenna on the other side of the passive
repeater, you will have a ‘system gain’ of 2  38 dB þ antenna gain – feeder loss.
Example
You can try to do a link calculation of a 30 m-high building. According to the free space loss
(Section 5.2.8), the free space loss would be about 67dB at 30 m distance, and then 38 dB
from the antenna in the lift-car to the user.
Total free space loss ¼ 67 dB þ 38 dB ¼ 105 dB
If we use a donor antenna at the top of the shaft with 7 dBi gain beaming down the elevator
shaft, a 7 dBi pick-up antenna, 2 dB cable loss and 2 dBi antenna gain for the antenna in the
Designing Indoor DAS Solutions
201

lift, then we can calculate how much power we need to feed this antenna in order to achieve
the 85 dBm inside the lift-car when it is in the bottom of the shaft:
Total link loss ¼ total free space loss þ cable loss  antenna gain
Total link loss ¼ 105 dB þ 2 dB  2 dB  7 dB  7 dB ¼ 91 dB
Required power at the transmit antenna ¼ 91 dB  85 dBm ¼ 6 dBm
5.6.7 Real-life Example of a Passive Repeater in an Elevator
The concept of passive repeaters actually works ﬁne for elevator coverage in many cases. In
a real-life elevator shaft we placed a DAS antenna, with 7 dBi pointing down in the top of the
lift shaft, a feed to the antenna of 10 dBm and using a similar 7 dBi pick-up antenna at the
top of the lift-car and one 2 dBi antenna inside the lift-car. The signal from the passive
repeater inside the lift was better than 80 dBm at distances of up to about 80 m.
We can try to verify this by doing a fast link budget for the downlink:
free space loss ðdBÞ ¼ 32:44 þ 20ðlog FÞ þ 20ðlog DÞ
We can calculate the free space loss in the shaft at 75 m:
free space loss ðdBÞ ¼ 32:44 dB þ 20ðlog 1850Þ þ 20ðlog 0:080Þ
free space loss ðdBÞ ¼ 32:44 dB þ 65:3 dB  22 dB ¼ 75:74 dB
We need to add the free space loss at the inside of the lift (38 dB) and the antenna gains
[7 dBi þ 7 dBi þ 2 dBi þ 2 dBi (mobile antenna gain)] and the cable loss (2dB). The
Figure 5.27
Two antennas ‘back to back’ might work as a passive repeater, but it takes a high donor
signal
202
Indoor Radio Planning

system gain between the connector at the DAS antenna and the mobile user inside the lift can
then be calculated:
system loss ¼ free space loss shaft þ free space loss lift þ cable loss  antenna gain
system loss ¼ 75:74 dB þ 38 dB þ 2 dB  18 dBi ¼ 97:74 dB
calculated user level inside the lift ¼ DAS antenna power  system loss
calculated user level inside lift ¼ 10 dBm  97:74 dBm ¼ 87:74 dBm
You can see from the calculations that the measured level inside the lift is actually about
8 dB higher than the calculated level – why? Actually what happens here is caused by the
‘tunnel effect’ on the radio signal. Both the service antenna on top of the lift shaft and the
donor antenna on top of the lift-car are 7 dBi gain antennas. According to the data sheet, the
radiation pattern of the antenna is about 70 beam-width (opening angle), but the ‘gain’ of
any antenna is related to the directivity of the antenna – the more ‘narrow’ the beam-width,
the higher the gain.
The narrow elevator shaft has a big impact on the directivity; the radio waves are forced to
stay inside the elevator shaft, focusing all the energy down inside the shaft. Therefore the
‘gain’ (directivity) of the antenna is no longer 7 dBi, but slightly higher. The mobile used
inside the lift may also have been slightly closer to the service antenna, adding to the signal.
Using a passive repeater solution is deﬁnitely possible for small to medium-sized
buildings for servicing the elevator, provided you can get a DAS antenna installed at the
top of the lift shaft as the donor antenna to the system.
5.6.8 Control the Elevator HO Zone
The best performance is achieved if the HO zone can be placed outside the elevator, i.e. in
the lobby in front of the elevator. This can only be achieved if we make sure that the same
cell is covering the elevator from top to bottom, as in Figure 5.25(b). Often this cell will be
one of the existing cells in the building (the topmost cell).
In order to perform a successful handover, there must be some overlap of coverage
from the two cells. In a situation where you do not have antennas installed in the lift
shaft and are covering the elevator only from antennas in the elevator lobby for the
different ﬂoors, the RF signal has to overcome both the penetration loss into the lift-car
and the penetration loss through the ﬂoor separation in order to provide cell overlap for
the handover to succeed. Therefore, the speed of the elevator is an important parameter
of concern when designing this type of elevator coverage for multicell buildings. You
need the overlap of the two cells in order for the handover to succeed. Typically you
need a minimum of 3 s to perform handover measurement, decoding, evaluation
processing and signaling time in order to make the handover a success. In addition,
you need to add an extra margin of time in case the ﬁrst handover attempt fails, and time
to perform a new handover attempt. This makes this approach in multicell buildings
almost impossible in practice for use in high-rise buildings with fast-moving elevators.
The only solution is to dedicate a cell to cover the elevator shaft and sometimes include
the elevator lobby [Figure 5.25(b)].
Designing Indoor DAS Solutions

5.6.9 Elevator HO Zone Size
When designing handover zones with relative fast-moving users, attention to the size of the
HO zone is important. When designing indoor solutions, there are typical scenarios where
the speed of the users plays a major role in the size of the HO zone; elevators used in the
building and cars driving to and from the parking area inside the building are some
examples. It is recommended to have minimum of 3–4 s to allow for decoding, measurement
evaluation and signaling for the handover, especially for GSM. The handover might fail;
therefore you must include a safety margin for at least one handover retry to cope with
extreme cases where many mobile users will perform handovers between the same two cells
at the same time.
Example, Elevator HO Zone Size
Using 4 s as an example, you can evaluate the size of the needed HO zone. If an elevator
moved at 5 m/s, you would need a HO zone of 20 m. If the ﬂoor separation in the building
was 3 m, you would have to provide an overlap of about seven ﬂoors! This clearly underlines
the potential problem in multicell buildings in Figure 5.25(a).
5.7 Multioperator Systems
Often there is a need for the indoor DAS to support multioperator conﬁgurations, where
more than one operator or band is to share the same DAS. This will typically be the case in
large public buildings, airports, convention centers and tunnels, where there is a need for
high capacity and in many cases more than one type of mobile system on air over the same
DAS, GSM=DCS þ UMTS.
From an economic perspective there is much to be saved by the operators if they share the
DAS. Seen from the building owner’s perspective, it is also preferable to have only one
DAS, one installation, one set of antennas, one project to coordinate and one equipment
room.
In order to connect more operators to the same DAS, you need to combine several base
stations, repeaters and bands into the same system. Combining the operators and bands into
the same DAS is not a trivial issue; you need to pay close attention to many potential
problems that might degrade the service if you are not careful.
The principle of the active DAS, where DL and UL are separated at the interface to
the main unit, as well as the low power levels required at the input (typically less than
10 dBm), will ease the requirements and the design of the combiner. If considering a
passive DAS for a multioperator solution, then the combiner becomes an issue. Be
careful when combining several operators or bands at high power using many carriers on
air. This has the potential for some really big problems. However, if you select high-
quality components and a careful design, preferably using a cavity ﬁlter system tuned to
the individual bands, you succeed.
In many cases multioperator solutions will be installed in large buildings, airports, hotels
and shopping malls. Therefore active DAS is often the preferred choice due to the improved
performance on data services and ease of installation and supervision.
204
Indoor Radio Planning

5.7.1 Multioperator DAS Solutions Compatibility
There are important RF parameters to take into account when designing multioperator DAS,
but if you pay attention to the most critical parameters, then you will succeed.
Rx/Tx Isolation
The Rx/Tx signal from each individual base station must be separated according to the
speciﬁcation of the base station supplier. When using the combined Rx/Tx port on the base
stations, this will normally not be a problem, due to the internal duplex ﬁlter in the base
station, which will separate the uplink and downlink. However you must also make sure that
the downlink signal from one base station will not reach any of the other base stations
receivers, according to the isolation speciﬁcation.
When using an active DAS where the main unit needs separate uplink and downlink
signals, it is preferable to use the Rx diversity port for the uplink from the DAS to the base
station, and use the combined Tx/Rx port for the downlink only. This will help in designing a
combiner that can provide excellent isolation of the UL and DL signals. However, you must
be aware that most base stations will trigger a ‘main receiver fault’ alarm, due to the lack of
uplink signal on the main receiver port, the combined Rx/Tx. As long as you cancel this
alarm trigger in the network surveillance system, then you can avoid the alarm problems. A
typical value for Rx/Tx isolation requirements is 25–30 dB (without including the internal
ﬁlter and combiner in the base station), but refer to the speciﬁcations and guidelines for the
speciﬁc base station used.
Return Loss
This is the reverse power, the reﬂected power from the DAS–combiner system. In order not to
trigger any VSWR alarm on the base station, you need to keep the reﬂected power below the
trigger value. A typical value is >10 dB (the difference between forward and reverse power).
Inter-band Isolation
This is the isolation between GSM–DCS–UMTS. In order not to de-sensitize the receiver in
the BS it is important to achieve maximum out-of-band rejection. The basic speciﬁcation on
this issue is speciﬁed by ETSI. The exact value depends on the base station manufacture,
how much you will allow the base station to be desensitized and the band conﬁguration.
Look up the value in the speciﬁcation of the base station. A typical value for inter-band
isolation is better than 50 dB.
Passive Inter-modulation
PIM is one of the biggest potential problems in combiner systems. It is very important to select
a combiner system with a low PIM ﬁgure (155 dBc at 2  20 W). PIM is a major concern for
combiner systems, especially when combining many high-power (typical 20 W/43 dBm)
Designing Indoor DAS Solutions
205

carriers in multioperator systems. The power density of several operators operating with many
carriers can be high, as we shall calculate later in this chapter.
5.7.2 The Combiner System
There are many ways to combine operators and bands into the same DAS, from constructing
your own combiner using discrete broadband components (as shown in Figure 5.28) to
cavity ﬁlter combiners with ﬁlters tuned to the speciﬁc UL/DL band of each of the operators
(as shown in Figure 5.29).
The broadband system in Figure 5.28 is ideal for use when combining low power signals
into an active DAS. Note that the downlink attenuator, used for leveling the downlink signal
Figure 5.28
Three operators combined using discrete passive components
206
Indoor Radio Planning

to the correct value of input to the active DAS, is installed prior to the circulator. Standard
attenuators have rather poor PIM performance 120–140 dBc; therefore it is recommended to
use a low-PIM cable attenuator. This will keep power levels in the circulator to a minimum,
thus minimizing the potential PIM in the circulator. Note that this example is used for an
active DAS, where the downlink power requirement at the input at the main unit is about
5 dBm. Therefore low-power base stations are used with about 30 dBm output power.
You can keep the uplink and downlink separated by using circulators; this will make sure that
one base station’s transmitters downlink signal is not feed to the other base station’s combined
Tx/Rx port, via the 1:3 splitter–combiner, thus securing isolation. Note the speciﬁcation of the
circulator; it might be an idea to use a double circulator with high reverse attenuation.
The custom tuned ﬁlter combiner in Figure 5.29 will typically perform much better. This
combiner must have low PIM and high isolation, even at high power, which is typically used
when combining high power systems into a passive DAS. The combiner is tuned individually to
the speciﬁc frequency bands of each operator, and there is good inter-operator and inter-band
isolation. Only high-quality components are recommended for use in any combiner system.
5.7.3 Inter-modulation Distortion
When two or more signals are mixed in a nonlinear component, passive or active, there will be
generated other signals as a product of the two or more original input signals. Inter-modulation
Figure 5.29
Three operators combined using a cavity combiner
Designing Indoor DAS Solutions
207

distortion (IMD) will occur in ampliﬁers when operating in nonlinear mode. Therefore it is
very important to always operate ampliﬁers according to their speciﬁcation, and to keep below
a certain limit, e.g. ETSI 36 dBm at GSM900. Make sure you stay within the linear operating
window of the ampliﬁer, and the ampliﬁer will have linear performance with low distortion. If
you overdrive the ampliﬁer, you might get few dB more output power, but the side effect will
be IMD problems that will generate inter-modulation interference.
What is Inter-modulation Interference?
There are three basic categories of inter-modulation distortion:
1. Receiver produced IMD: when two or more transmitter signals are mixed in the receivers
RF ampliﬁer.
2. Transmitter produced IMD: when one or more transmitted signals are mixed in a
nonlinear component, in the transmitter.
3. Passive IMD: normally radio planners are only concerned about inter-modulation
problems caused by active components like transmitters, ampliﬁers and receivers.
However, you must realize that passive components like cables, splitters, antennas can
also produce inter-modulation – passive inter-modulation. Typically the source of PIM is
the junction between different types of materials, an example could be where the cable
connects to the connector. The connection between any internal or external point of
contact in a passive component can generate PIM.
The PIM performance is often the big difference between quality and low-cost passive
components. Normally good quality passive components, antennas included, will be
constructed using the same base material, with only a few or no internal connections or
assembled parts and a high level of craftsmanship.
The PIM problem is often underestimated, especially when designing passive systems for
large, high-capacity passive DAS, multioperator solutions and multiband solutions. The
concentration of the high power in the passive DAS, especially close to the base stations, can
be high.
Example
Let us look at a typical example of a multioperator solution in an airport, with this conﬁguration:
four GSM operators are each using eight carriers, transmitting 40 dBm (10 W) from their base
stations. This is a total of 32 carriers. The total composite power is up to 55 dBm (320 W) in the
ﬁrst part of the passive DAS. Even if the ﬁrst splitter in the DAS can handle 700 W, you might
have a problem. How high is the generated inter-modulation power?
A typical value for a ‘standard’ splitter is 120 dBc, meaning that the IM3 is 120 dB
below the c (carrier). With 40 dBm of power for one carrier to the splitter, the IM3 could be
up to 40  120 ¼ 80 dBm.
Depending on the frequencies used, this will generate a problem: it could hit the uplink of
one of the radio services on the DAS. If you exceed the power rating of the components, or
there is a bad connection somewhere in the passive DAS, then the PIM will increase
dramatically.
208
Indoor Radio Planning

5.7.4 How to Minimize PIM
Passive inter-modulation occurs when two or more signals are present in a passive device
(cable, connector, isolator, switch, antenna, etc.) and this device exhibits a nonlinear
response. The nonlinearity is typically caused by dissimilar metals, dirty interconnections
or other anodic or corrosion effects. Bad connections are also a typical source, and often the
effect does not appear at low power levels, but increases exponentially at higher power
levels. Then the passive device starts acting like a frequency mixer with a local oscillator and
an RF input, generating its own unwanted signals.
There are some rules of the thumb on how to design for low PIM:
 All passive components must fulﬁll a minimum speciﬁcation of 155 dBc at 2  20 W.
 Cable absorbers should be used as terminations.
 The 7/16 type of connectors should be used.
 All connectors should be tightened according to the speciﬁcations, using the correct torque
and tools.
 Low PIM cables should be used, with all connectors fully soldered.
 It is vital to maintain disciplined ﬁtting of connectors to the cable, craftsmanship, use of
correct tool and all metal cleaned before ﬁtting the connector.
 Tools, cables and connectors that match and are from the same manufacture should be
used.
 Proper installation means:
–no loose cables, everything strapped with cable binders;
–no mechanical stress on RF parts;
–all RF interconnections cleaned as speciﬁed by the manufacturer.
5.7.5 IMD Products
The frequencies that are generated by inter-modulation can be found by mathematical
calculations of the performance of nonlinear circuits (as shown in Table 5.3). The terminology
used to deﬁne inter-modulation products classiﬁes their order as second-order, third-order,
fourth-order, etc.
The frequencies generated are calculated as the sum or differences between these inter-
modulation products (as shown in Figure 5.30). In theory there are no limits to the number of
them; however, typically just a few can result in serious consequences.
The main concern in indoor DAS solutions is the IM3 product,
2f1 þ f2; 2f1  f2
and you must strive to minimize that problem. The powers of products of higher orders, such
as ﬁfth to ninth orders and even higher, are usually so low that they do not create serious
problems, but be aware of PIM and check.
The products of even second, fourth or sixth orders usually have limited impact due
to the fact that the resulting PIM frequency is attenuated by the ﬁlters the base
station.

5.8 Co-existence Issues for GSM/UMTS
When deploying different radio systems and frequency bands using the same DAS for
distribution, there are concerns that need special attention. You need to make sure that one
system does not cause IM problems that will degrade the performance on its own or on other
bands.

Indoor Radio Planning

The problem rises exponentially with the power you feed to the DAS. The more power,
the bigger the issue, mainly due to PIM (see Sections 4.3 and 5.7.3).
5.8.1 Spurious Emissions
A major source of co-existence problems is spurious emissions from the GSM transmitters
(as shown in Figure 5.31). Therefore it is highly recommended always to use high-quality
pass band ﬁlters on all transmitters, in a multioperator or multisystem DAS solution, when
combining GSM and UMTS. Those ﬁlters will normally be a part of the base station, the
combiner, but check the speciﬁcations of the base station to be sure.
Spurious emissions from GSM are restricted in the UL UMTS band (1920–1980 MHz) to
a maximum 96 dBm measured in 100 kHz bandwidth (equivalent to 80 dBm in a
3.84 MHz channel). Any multioperator or multisystem DAS should be designed accordingly,
in order to minimize the impact on the UMTS UL.
Big Impact on UMTS
As we know, the UMTS system is noise-limited; any noise increase on the UL of the UMTS
system will severely impact the performance. Just a slight increase in the UL noise load will
offset admission control; high noise increase will collapse the cell and cause the admission
control to block for any trafﬁc.
The number of GSM carriers in the system plays a signiﬁcant role: when doubling the
number of GSM carriers (with same level), the spurious emission is increased by 3 dB.
5.8.2 Combined DAS for GSM900 and UMTS
When combining GSM900 and UMTS on the same DAS, you must pay attention to the
second harmonic from GSM900 that might fall into the uplink band of UMTS (TDD) (as
shown in Figure 5.32).

5.8.3 Combined DAS for GSM1800 and UMTS
When combining GSM1800 and UMTS into the same DAS, you need to pay attention to the
third-order inter-modulation products. The third-order IMD from GSM1800 can fall into the
UL band of UMTS, if you do not pay attention to the frequency allocation on GSM1800 (as
shown in Figure 5.33). When doing the frequency planning on GSM1800, attention to this
problem is advised in order to minimize it. This can be a challenge in multioperator
solutions, where frequency coordination between competing operators must be carried out.
Example
Let us look at one example with 1800 MHz third-order IM. Using CH520 (1806.8 MHz) and
CH825 (1867.8 MHz) will produce this IMD3 (refer to Section 5.7.3):
2f1 þ f2 ¼ 5481:4 MHz
2f1  f2 ¼ 1745:8 MHz ðwill hit GSM1800 CH690 ULÞ
f1 þ 2f2 ¼ 5542:4 MHz
2f2  f1 ¼ 1928:8 MHz ðwill hit UMTS ULÞ
It is highly recommended to plan the frequencies on GSM1800 so they do not fall in
the UL band of any UMTS channels that are in use. The fact is that UMTS has good

narrow-band interference immunity, but a high narrowband signal on the UL of the
UMTS base station can cause receiver blocking.
Knowing that the ﬁrst DCS channel used is CH520 ¼ 1806:8 MHz and that the problem is
the third IMD ( 2f2  f1), we can calculate what the highest frequency can be, in order to
make sure that the third IMD will ‘hit’ just below the UMTS FDD frequency band
1919.8 MHz, and not cause any problems (if UMTS TDD is not used). The highest
allowable frequency is:
1919:8 MHz ¼ 2f2  1806:88 MHz ¼ ð1919:88 MHz þ 1806:88 MHzÞ=2
¼ 1863:38 MHz ¼ CH802 ð1863:2 MHzÞ
With CH520 as one of the frequencies in operation, we must make sure that we do not select
frequencies above CH802 as the other channel.
5.9 Co-existence Issues for UMTS/UMTS
In an indoor DAS system it is very likely that operators will have adjacent channels active on
the same DAS. Because of the limited selectivity of the ﬁlters used in the mobile and base
station, power from one channel will leak into the adjacent channels.
5.9.1 Adjacent Channel Interference Power Ratio
This is the major issue when co-locating UMTS operators in the same building. It is
speciﬁed that the adjacent channel suppression must be better than 33 dB (as shown in
Figure 5.34), but this is in many cases not enough, especially indoors where you
typically have users close to the antennas. A user being serviced by another operator
(and therefore not in power control of the cell) is likely to cause adjacent channel
interference power ratio (ACIR) when this mobile is close to the antenna, having low
path loss. Conversely, the adjacent operator might impact your user when he is close to
the other operator’s antenna.
Figure 5.34
Channel allocation on UMTS

213

Noise Increase on Node B
The adjacent channel interference will cause noise increase on the UL of node B, degrading
the capacity with noise load.
Example
We can calculate how much noise increase a mobile will generate and the noise load on our
cell, when this mobile is being serviced by an adjacent operator and when the mobile is close
to our antenna. The mobile on the adjacent channel is transmitting 21 dBm. The mobile (UE)
is 10 meters from our antenna (free space loss ¼ 59 dB), and then we have 10 dB loss from
the node B to the antenna and 2 dBi antenna gain; the path loss is 59 þ 10  2 ¼ 67 dB:
PRxAdj ¼ PTxUE  ACIR  PL
Where PRxAdj is the adjacent channel power level; PTxUE is the mobile transmit power on
adjacent channel; ACIR is the adjacent channel interference rejection; PL is the path loss
from the adjacent mobile to our node B.
PRxAdj ¼ 21 dBm  33 dB  67 dB ¼ 79 dBm
Now we can calculate the new noise level (assuming a noise ﬂoor on node B of 105 dBm).
We need to sum up the noise, by adding the power contribution from each different source
(the PRxAdj þ noise ﬂoor on node B of 105 dBm):
power total ¼ power 1 þ power 2 . . . power ðnÞ
We now need to convert the dBm to mW:
P ðmWÞ ¼ 10dBm=10
105 dBm ¼ 31:6  1012 ðmWÞ
79 dBm ¼ 12:58  109 ðmWÞ
Then we can add the two powers:
combined noise power ¼ 31:6  1012 þ 12:58  109 ¼ 12:62  109 ðmWÞ
dBm
We then convert the noise power back to dBm:
noise floor ðdBmÞ ¼ 10 logð12:62  109Þ ¼ 79 ðdBmÞ
The 105 dBm from the BS plays only a minor role; it is after all 26 dB lower than the
power from the adjacent mobile. This adjacent channel noise causes the uplink of the cell to
collapse, disabling the cell from carrying any more trafﬁc, and dropping all ongoing calls!

5.9.2 The ACIR Problem with Indoor DAS
ACIR is a major concern inside buildings, when the operator uses adjacent frequencies and
separate DAS systems. The problem is demonstrated in Figure 5.35 and 5.36. Two separate
DAS systems are deployed within the same building; one for operator 1 (OPR1) and one for
operator 2 (OPR2).
When we look at the signal power as a function of the location relative to the antennas (as
shown in Figure 5.36), it is clear that, when you are close to an antenna from the other
operator and have low signal from the serving cell, there is a real potential for ACIR.
The Potential ACIR Problem in the Future
There are many of these potential ACIR problems in real buildings around the world, but the
problem is not evident until the operators deploy more channels. This is due to the fact that
most UMTS operators have two or three UMTS channels allocated and if they deploy the
ﬁrst carrier only, there is still 10–15 MHz distance to the next channel from the other
operator, minimizing the ACIR problem. Most operators deploy UMTS (R99) trafﬁc on the
ﬁrst carrier, HSPA on the second carrier and leave the third channel for ‘future upgrades’.

This usage of the ‘future’ channel could be a potential problem in many buildings (as shown
Figure 5.35).
5.9.3 Solving the ACIR Problem Inside Buildings
There are means to solve the ACIR issue; the best way is for the operators to agree between
themselves to use the same DAS and antenna locations, and coordinate the roll-out in these
buildings.
It is always a good idea to place the indoor antenna so that the user cannot get too close to
it; however this is not always possible inside a building. After all, if the ceiling height is 3 m,
and the user is 180 cm tall, the mobile will come as close as 120 cm to the antenna (with a
path loss of about 40 dB).
Multioperator Systems will Help
When using the same DAS, the scenario can actually be controlled by the fact that both the
wanted and the unwanted signals track the same relative level. If both operators use the same
antenna locations (as shown in Figure 5.37), then the two signal levels will track and have
the same relative difference in level throughout the building, thus avoiding any potential
ACIR problems, on both UL and DL.
Offsetting the WCDMA Frequency
It is possible for the mobile operator to offset the WCDMA frequency in steps of 200 kHz,
thus minimizing the problem. If CH1 is used for UMTS, CH2 for HSPA and CH3 is unused,
then the two channels can be offset 1 MHz, improving the adjacent channel isolation in the
building (as shown in Figure 5.38).
5.10 Multioperator Requirements
The complexity of designing a multioperator solution is often underestimated. To design,
implement and operate a multioperator solution is much more than ‘just’ the RF design

issues. It is highly recommended that all the mobile operators in each country or region work
towards a mutual accepted document that deﬁnes all the parameters, interfaces and issues
with regards to multioperator DAS solutions.
Often RF planners focus on the RF design only and go ahead with the project. However
costly mistakes and performance degrading problems can be avoided if you plan more than
just one step ahead and pay attention to the whole process. It is recommended to prepare,
develop and agree on a multioperator agreement before the ﬁrst multioperator project is
decided. This agreement takes time to develop and obtain agreement on; therefore it is
highly recommended that you complete the multioperator agreement before the ﬁrst
multioperator DAS solution design is actually needed. If you wait until the ﬁrst project, it
will probably be delayed.
There are many issues, technical, political and legal, that must be clariﬁed in the process
of developing the multioperator agreement. In most cases it is worthwhile hiring a neutral
consultant to help the operators with this agreement. Compromises sometimes need to be
made, and it can be much easier for an independent consultant to make ends meet and come
to a mutual agreement and compromise.
5.10.1 Multioperator Agreement
The multioperator agreement (MOA) document must be agreed and must cover all aspects of
the process and lifetime of the DAS system. There must be clear deﬁnitions of all aspects of
the project, including technical, logistical, installation and legal aspects.
The MOA should ideally be a universal document that can be used for all projects in the
future and constantly be updated and adapted. Clear responsibilities must be deﬁned for all
aspects of the project. It needs to be precise and accurate, preferably containing document
templates to handle and control the process. The best way to handle any multioperator
project is to get the MOA in place before anything else is done. Even if you currently do not
have any multioperator projects in mind, start now to deﬁne the MOA, so it will be ready
when the ﬁrst multioperator project is initiated.
In many aspects we consider other operators as competitors, but it is important to agree on
a common MOA to handle these projects.

5.10.2 Parties Involved in the Indoor Project
We, RF planners, like to think that the whole indoor project revolves around us. In fact,
many other important persons and departments are involved, internally at each operator but
also quite a few external parties. Here are a few examples of parties involved in the typical
project:
 The building owner, and also the architect of the building.
 The local IT consultant or personnel responsible for the site.
 Radio planners from all operators.
 Co-location managers from all operators.
 Site hunters.
 Transmission planners.
 Parameter optimizers.
 Equipment procurement departments.
 Commissioning teams.
 Contractors and installers.
 Optimizing team.
 Operations and maintenance team.
5.10.3 The Most Important Aspects to Cover in the MOA
Indoor DAS projects are complex and many parameters and aspects need to be taken into
account. Obviously there is much focus on all the radio parameters, but many other
parameters and issues need to be taken into account when designing, implementing and
operating a multioperator system. Here are some examples of the most important aspects.
The Radio Design Speciﬁcation
This is the basis of the design. It is very important to absolutely crystal clear on the RF
speciﬁcations:
 RF design levels – UL and DL level and quality or BER levels.
 Data service levels – DL and UL speeds and EDGE or HSPA.
 Noise levels – UL noise power and DL noise level.
 Delay – maximum allowable delay of the system, end to end.
 Differentiated design goals – special design levels in speciﬁc areas.
 Link budgets – complete link budget for all services, all bands must be documented.
 General design guidelines – other, non-RF design parameters.
 Performance merits of the used DAS components – PIM speciﬁcations, power rating and
type approvals.
 Handover zones – HO zone size and trafﬁc speed, and GSM or UMTS zones.
 Capacity – number of channels needed for voice and data requirements.
 Maximum downlink transmit power at the DAS antenna – to avoid near–far problems,
especially on UMTS and HSPA.
218
Indoor Radio Planning

Co-existence Parameters
It is important to insure compatibility between all the operators and radio services, to make
sure that the radio services can co-exist on the same DAS without any service degradation of
any of the radio services.
 RF interface speciﬁcation – type of connectors, power levels and isolation between bands
and between operators.
 Inter-modulation optimization – frequency restrictions, spurious emissions, and ETSI and
other requirements.
 Public radiation safety guidelines (EMR) – WHO/ICNIRP and local limits.
 Co-existence issues with other equipment – EMC and RFI compliance.
 Leakage from the building.
Future of the Indoor DAS
We need to look into the expected future of the building and DAS project. We must be sure
that we deﬁne how to react on any changes in DAS:
 Future upgrades – more sectors, capacity, how and when new services are added to the
DAS, 3G, 3.5G, WiMAX, etc.
 Connecting new operators to the DAS in the future – legal issues and headroom in the link
budget.
 Disconnecting from the DAS – how this is handled if an operator wants to disconnect.
 Discontinuing the DAS – how this is handled when the DAS has to be removed.
Logistics
Clear deﬁnition of who is responsible for what in the project is very important. Gentlemen’s
agreements might be nice, but clearly deﬁned contracts and agreements in writing are a must.
These documents well help resolve any misunderstandings about responsibility in the future:
 Responsibility matrix – all parties included.
 Selection of DAS system – vendor and supplier, and request for quotation (RFQ) process.
 Selection and certiﬁcation of installers – education, tool requirements and certiﬁcation.
 Legal agreement and contracts – between operators, between operators and building owner,
between operators and installer or DAS supplier, on who owns the DAS and insurance issues.
 Documentation – specify function, in- and output of all documents, documentation control
and tracing updates, and design and as-built documentation.
 Installation guidelines – building code and ﬁre retardants.
 Implementation plan.
 Acceptance testing and measurements – pass or levels, test method speciﬁcation and
operations.
 Be sure to deﬁne how and who takes care of maintenance of the DAS in the future – site
access, alarm monitoring, spare parts, operation and maintenance service level agreement.

Trafﬁc Dimensioning
One of the most important design parameters for indoor DAS solutions is to deﬁne how many
speech channels you must provide for the users of the building in order to cater for their need
for voice trafﬁc channels. Voice trafﬁc is time-critical. Many data services can be degraded in
speed, offset slightly or delayed in time without any degradation of the user experience. It
does not matter if your mail or SMS is delayed by 30 s, but the voice connection must be
maintained 1:1 in time; one voice call needs one permanent trafﬁc channel.
How do you calculate the number of channels needed to cater for the capacity
requirements of the users in a speciﬁc building? And when you know the number of users
and the type of users, how do you then use this information to calculate the number of
channels? In the early days of telephony over ﬁxed lines, a Danish mathematician faced
similar challenges when dimensioning how many telephone lines were needed to inter-
connect ﬁxed telephone switches.
6.1 Erlang, the Trafﬁc Measurement
Agner Krarup Erlang (Figure 6.1) was born in Denmark in 1878 (close to where I live). He
was a pioneer in the theory of telecommunications trafﬁc and he proposed a formula to
calculate the percentages of users served by a telephone exchange that would have to wait
when attempting to place a call. He could calculate how many lines were needed to service a
speciﬁc number of users, with a speciﬁc availability of lines for the users.
A. K. Erlang published the result of his study in 1909: The Theory of Probabilities and
Telephone Conversations. Erlang is now recognized worldwide for this work, and his
formula is accepted as the standard reference for calculating telecommunication trafﬁc load.
The unit we use for telephony trafﬁc load is ‘Erlang’ or E. Erlang worked for the
Copenhagen Telephone Company (KTAS) for many years, until his death in 1929.
6.1.1 What is One Erlang?
An Erlang is a unit of telecommunications trafﬁc measurement. One Erlang is the
continuous use of one voice channel. In call minutes, one Erlang is 60 min/h, 1440 call

Morten Tolstrup
# 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

min/24 h. In practice, when doing mobile capacity calculations, an Erlang is used to describe
the total trafﬁc volume of 1 h, for a speciﬁc cell.
Erlang Example
If a group of 20 users makes 60 calls in 1 h, and each call had an average duration of 3 min,
then we can calculate the trafﬁc in Erlangs:
total minutes of traffic in 1 h ¼ duration  number of calls
total minutes of traffic in 1 h ¼ 3  60
total minutes of traffic in 1 h ¼ 180 min
The Erlangs are deﬁned as trafﬁc (minutes) per hour:
Erlangs ¼ 180=60 ¼ 3 E
Knowing the number of users (20), we can calculate the load per user:
user load ¼ total load=number of users
user load ¼ 3=20 ¼ 0:115 E ¼ 150 mE per user
Then, if we have the same type of users inside a building with 350 mobile users, we can
calculate what capacity we need:
total load ¼ number of users  load per user
total load ¼ 350  0:150 ¼ 52:5 E
Yet what do these 52.5 Erlangs mean in terms of number of voice channels needed? Do we
then need 53 channels in order to service the users? Not exactly. It depends on the user
behavior: how the calls are distributed and how many calls are allowed to be rejected in the
cell. In theory – if you do not want any rejected calls due to lack of capacity, you should
provide 350 channels for the 350 users, and then you would have 100% capacity for all users
Figure 6.1
The Danish statistician Agner Krarup Erlang

at any given time. However, it is not likely that all users will call at the same time, and users
will accept a certain level of call rejection due to lack of capacity. To estimate the number of
channels needed, we need to look at maximum call blocking we allow in the busiest hour
during the day.
6.1.2 Call Blocking, Grade of Service
We need to calculate how many lines, or in our case how many trafﬁc channels, we need to
provide in order to carry the needed trafﬁc. In this example we calculated that 350 users,
each of whom load the system with 150 mE, would produce a total load of 52.5 E. What if all
the users call at the same time? How are the calls distributed? How many call rejects due to
lack of channels can we accept? This was exactly the basis of Erlang’s work; he calculated
how many channels you would need to carry a speciﬁc trafﬁc load, with a speciﬁc service
rate or blocking rate, for a given distribution of the trafﬁc arrival.
The blocking rate (grade of service or GOS) is deﬁned as the percentage of calls that
are rejected due to lack of channels. If the users makes 100 calls, and one call is rejected
due to lack of channels (capacity) the blocking rate is 1 in 100, or 1%. This is referred to
as 1% GOS. Operators might differentiate the GOS target for different indoor solutions,
with a strict GOS of 0.5% in an ofﬁce building but allowing a GOS of 2% in shopping
malls.
6.1.3 The Erlang B Table
Provided that the calls are Erlang-distributed, you can use the Erlang B formula to calculate
the required number of channels at a given load rate, and a given grade of service. The
Erlang distribution is a special case of gamma distribution used to model the total interval
associated with multiple Poisson events. The Erlang B formula is complex; it is more
practical to use an Erlang B table based on the Erlang B formula (see Table 6.1).
Using the Erlang Table
First of all we need to decide the quality of service in terms of how many calls we will allow
the system to reject in the busiest hour. This is expressed as the grade of service. If we design
for a GOS of 1%, a maximum of 1 call out of 100 will be rejected due to lack of trafﬁc
channels. Using the Erlang table is straightforward; you simply select the GOS you want to
offer the users, and a typical number for mobile systems is 1%. Then you look up in the table
how many voice trafﬁc channels (N) you need to support this trafﬁc.
Example
If we have calculated that the trafﬁc is 5 E, and we will offer 1% GOS, we need 11 voice
channels (5.1599 E) to support the trafﬁc. We can also use the Erlang to work in reverse, and
conclude that having only 10 trafﬁc channels to support 5 E will give a GOS (blocking) of
about 2%. How do we determine what load in Erlang an indoor system will give? First of all
we need to know the trafﬁc proﬁle of the users in the building.

6.1.4 User Types, User Trafﬁc Proﬁle
Each user in the network will have a speciﬁc load proﬁle; the proﬁle may vary and some
days one user will load the mobile system more than other days. You need to use average
load numbers, based on the type of user, in order to make some assumptions to help us
design the capacity need (see Table 6.2). They can only be assumptions, but these
assumptions will be adjusted over time when analyzing the post trafﬁc on the implemented
solutions. Thus you will build up a knowledge database to help you be more accurate in
future designs. As a general guideline the typical numbers shown in Table 6.2 could be
used.
If you are designing an indoor system for a building with 250 users and the users com-
prise 40 heavy users, 190 normal ofﬁce users and 20 private users, you will need a capacity
of:
ð40  0:1Þ þ ð190  0:05Þ þ ð20  0:02Þ ¼ 4 þ 9:5 þ 0:4 ¼ 13:9 E
However we must remember that this load is only present when all users are in the building
at the same time. It may be more likely that on average 80% of the users are in the building,
and thus the trafﬁc load would be 13:9  0:8 ¼ 11:12 E.
If we design for a GOS of maximum 1%, we can look up in the Erlang table the necessary
number of trafﬁc channels. In this case we will need 19 channels in order to keep the GOS
below 1% (11.23 E).

Mobile-to-mobile Calls in the Same Cell, Intracell Mobile Calls
In a totally wireless environment where users generate a lot of internal trafﬁc in the same
cell, you must remember that to support one call where a user is calling another user in the
same cell will actually take up two trafﬁc channels. Therefore the ‘internal call factor’ must
be applied. This is an important parameter to take into account, when analyzing the capacity
need for the speciﬁc building.
In practice, if 10% of the load is internal mobile-to-mobile trafﬁc, the load per user can be
multiplied by a factor of 1.10; a heavy user that normally loads the network with 100 mE
must be calculated as 110 mE if the internal trafﬁc is 10%.
6.1.5 Save on Cost, Use the Erlang Table
If it is an indoor GSM cell you are designing, then typically the number of trafﬁc channels is
seven per transceiver (radio channel). The exact number of trafﬁc channels per transceiver
depends on the conﬁguration of the logical channels in the cell, but seven is often the
average.
To calculate how much capacity you need, take the calculated total trafﬁc in the cell, in
this case 13.9 E, and multiply it by the ‘intracell’ factor, 1.10 in this case. To calculate the
total capacity requirement:
13:9 E  1:10 ¼ 15:29 E
Using the Erlang table, you can determine that you would need a total of 24 trafﬁc channels
to make sure you can keep the voice service below 1% GOS.
You know that each radio channel comes with seven trafﬁc channels, so you would need to
deploy four TRX with a total of 28 trafﬁc channels – in fact an overcapacity of four trafﬁc
channels. The four TRX would be able to carry 18.64 E, or an overcapacity of 3.35 E, or 30
heavy users. Thus some extra margin is integrated for capacity growth in the solution.
However, there is also another option.
Instead of deploying four TRX, you could save the cost of one TRX and only deploy three
TRX with a total of 21 trafﬁc channels. You can now look up in the Erlang table the GOS of
a load of 15.29 E on 21 channels and see that you would have a GOS of 2–5%. Depending on
the solution, you might decide to go with three radio channels and save the cost of one
transceiver unit, and then analyze the call blocking performance once the system was on air,
over a period of 4–6 weeks, to make sure that the capacity was acceptable. In fact, the Erlang
table and trafﬁc calculation can help you cost-optimize the design.
You must remember that the cost of an extra TRX is not only limited to the HW price of
the TRX itself, there might be combiner and ﬁlter costs, BSC costs, A-bis interface and
transcoder costs, as well as annual license fees to the network supplier.
6.1.6 When Not to Use Erlang
There are cases where we cannot use Erlang for voice calls; the most common example is
when calculating the capacity for a metro train tunnel system. Even though the trafﬁc inside
226
Indoor Radio Planning

the trains is Erlang-distributed and has normal telephone user behavior, you must realize that
the trains moving the users are not Erlang-distributed! In practice, the arrival of trafﬁc in
cells in a metro train system is distributed by the train schedule, not by Erlang distribution,
thus Erlang cannot be applied.
In practice, these trains are ‘capacity bombs’ that drift around the network, so be careful.
In practice you might not even discover the real blocking of calls in a tunnel system; most
network statistics will not be able to detect the call blocking in this case due to the fact that
the blocking occurs only in a very short moment in time, maybe a few seconds when all the
users inside a train hand over (or try to hand over) to the next cell when traveling in the train.
To make sure there is no blocking, you might have to analyze the speciﬁc network counter
indicating blocked calls for the speciﬁc cell, not the Erlang statistics, which might be
averaged out over 15 min. Signaling capacity in this case is also a major concern when a
‘train-load’ of calls are to handover within the same 2–5 s.
6.1.7 GSM Radio Channels and Erlang
Now you know how to use the Erlang table, you can easily produce a small table that can
help in the estimation of how many voice users you are able to support for a given GSM
conﬁguration of radio channels in the cell (see Table 6.3).
Bear in mind that you also need to be able to support the required data services, and in
some cases you will dedicate speciﬁc time slots (trafﬁc channels) to data trafﬁc.
It is interesting to note that the capacity of two radio channels is more than double the
capacity of one! This effect is called trunking gain, and is explained in detail later in
Section 6.1.9.
Half-rate on GSM
Note that GSM can utilize ‘half-rate’ where two voice users share the same TSL, with half
the data rate. This will result in double the voice capacity for each radio channel. In cells
with high peak loads this is normally implemented as ‘dynamic half-rate’, where the voice
calls in normal circumstances gets one normal TSL per call. However, if the load on the cell

rises to a preset trigger level, the system starts to convert existing calls to half-rate, and
assigns new calls as half-rate, until the load fall below another trigger level.
The use of half-rate voice coding will to some extent degrade the perceived voice
quality, but in normal circumstances the voice quality degradation is barely noticeable, and
is to be preferred considering that the alternative is call rejection due to lack of voice
channels.
6.1.8 UMTS Channels and Erlang
The voice capacity on a UMTS cell is related to many factors. How much noise increase will
we allow in the cell? How many data users and at what speed do we need to support these
users? How much processing power does the base station have (channel elements) to support
the trafﬁc? Typically one channel element can support one voice connection. It also depends
on how much power is assigned to the CPICH and the other common channels.
Many factors interact, but assume that the only trafﬁc on the cell is voice calls and the
other parameters are set to:
 Sum of power assigned to CPICH and other common channels is 16% (8.1 dB).
 Maximum noise rise is 3 dB (load 50%).
 Voice activity factor is 67%.
Then one UMTS carrier can support 39 voice channels of 12.2 kbps. This corresponds
to 28.129 E at 1% GOS, enabling the cell to support 563 ofﬁce users at 50 mE per user,
or 33.609 E at 2% GOS, enabling the cell to support 1680 private users at 20 mE per
user.
However we must remember that this is pure voice trafﬁc, and data calls will take
up capacity. Using the same conditions, the same cell will only be able to support one
384 kps data call and 27 voice channels, or three voice channels and three 384 kbps data
calls. This is provided that there are channel elements to support the trafﬁc installed in the
base station.
6.1.9 Trunking Gain, Resource Sharing
Trunking gain is a term used in telecom trafﬁc calculations to describe the gain from
combining the load into the same resource (trunk). The effect of the trunking gain
can also be seen in the Erlang table, and in Table 6.3. If you look up in the
Erlang table the trafﬁc capability of a GSM cell using one radio channel with seven
trafﬁc channels and 1% GOS, you can see that the capacity for the cell is 2.50 E. Then
two separate cells with this conﬁguration of seven trafﬁc channels will each be able to
carry 2  2:50 ¼ 5 E.
However if we combine the resources, all of the 14 trafﬁc channels into the same cell, we
can see in the Erlang table that 14 channels can carry 7.35 E. This is 2.35 E more with the
same resources, 14 channels. This is a gain of 47% with the same resources, but combined
into the same cell; this effect is called ‘trunking gain’ (see Figure 6.2).
228
Indoor Radio Planning

Trafﬁc Proﬁle of the Cell and Shared Resources
The trafﬁc in different cells will often have different trafﬁc proﬁles, the proﬁle being the
distribution of the load throughout the day. A shopping mall will have low trafﬁc until
opening hours and almost no trafﬁc at night time. An airport might have a relatively high
load constantly. This offset in load proﬁle can be used to improve the business case of indoor
solutions.
Example
If we take two trafﬁc proﬁles, one from an outdoor cell, and the trafﬁc from the cell covering
inside an ofﬁce building and combine the load from the two areas (see Figure 6.3), we can
actually get ‘free’ capacity. This is the case for the solution shown in Section 4.6.3, where we
are tapping into the capacity of the outdoor macro cell, distributing the same capacity

resource inside the building. By combining the two load proﬁles, a high trunking gain is
obtained due to the offset in the trafﬁc proﬁle between the two cells.
Sharing Load on a Weekly Basis
The offset in trafﬁc proﬁle should not only be evaluated on a daily basis, but also over a week
(see Figure 6.4) or even longer periods. It might be that the capacity of a big ofﬁce building
next to a stadium could be shared if the game in the arena occurred outside shopping hours.
Thus you can save a lot of roll-out cost if you can share the load from different areas with
noncorrelated trafﬁc proﬁles.
6.1.10 Cell Conﬁguration in Indoor Projects
Trunking gain has a direct effect on the business case of the indoor system. The more trafﬁc
you allow to be serviced by the same cell, the better the trunking gain is, and the lower the
production cost per call is. Why then do you need to divide large buildings into more sectors?
UMTS
When designing UMTS indoor solutions it is evident that you cannot just deploy a new
scrambling code (sector) in the same cell. This would be an overlap of the two cells in 100%
of the area, and all the trafﬁc would permanently be in soft handover, using resources from
both cells, so actually nothing would be gained.
Dividing the building in to more sectors is the only way to add capacity in the building,
but UMTS needs physical isolation between the sectors in order to minimize the soft
handover zones and decrease cannibalization of the capacity of the cells.

GSM
On GSM you can add new radio channels to the cell; the limit is the number of channels the
operator has in the spectrum and restrictions with regards to frequency coordination with
other adjacent cells. Also, hardware restrictions on the base station will demand a channel
separation of typically three channels in the same cell. However, in theory you could deploy
16–24 channels or even more in the same cell. In practice it is preferable to keep the number
limited to a maximum of about 12 for an indoor project. In a high-rise building you should
use a maximum of four to six carriers in each of the topmost sectors, to avoid ‘leaking’ too
many carriers to the nearby macro area. However, there are other reasons – for the passive
part of the DAS it is a matter of keeping the composite power at a relative level when
combining several high power carriers to minimize inter-modulation problems. For active
DAS it can be a matter of a too low a power per carrier, due to the limited resources of the
composite ampliﬁer, where all carriers must share the same power resource, and this will
limit the downlink service range from the antennas.
6.1.11 Busy Hour and Return on Investment Calculations
Busy Hour
You must bear in mind that the capacity calculation for estimating the needed trafﬁc channels
must be based on the busiest hour in the week, whereas the business case calculation is based
on the total production of trafﬁc, or call minutes in the building. The number of trafﬁc
channels needed will be dependent on the GOS you want to offer in the busy hour.
Return on Investment
Return on investment (ROI) is mostly the motivation for implementing any indoor solution.
Usually an operator will know what the revenue is per call minute, but how do you calculate
the expected trafﬁc production for the system? It is actually quite easy: 1 E is, as we know,
deﬁned as a constant call. Therefore, you can calculate that 1 E is 24  60 ¼ 1440 min=day.
This will mean that a system with a trafﬁc load of 11 E will produce 11  1440 ¼
15840 call min=day. Knowing the revenue per call minute, you can then calculate the
revenue for the system, and do the business case evaluation.
Example, Shopping Mall
Sometimes it is a little more complex to calculate the trafﬁc and the needed trafﬁc channels.
If you have a case with a multioperator solution, you will need to divide the trafﬁc according
to the market share.
Inputs
The input is the statistics from the shopping mall: an average of 18 000 shoppers per day
each in the mall for an average time of 2.5 h. There are six shopping days; opening hours are
Monday to Friday 9.00 to 19.00 and Saturday 10.00 to 14.00. The busiest day of the week is
Saturday, when 25 000 shoppers are in the mall. The mobile penetration in the country where
the shopping mall is located is 85%. The market share for the operator we are designing for
is 55%. The operator allows 2% GOS in the shopping area.
Trafﬁc Dimensioning
231

Calculations
First of all we need to understand that there actually are two calculations of the trafﬁc:
one for the business case and one for the trafﬁc design. The business case should be based
on the total call minutes, but the trafﬁc design should be done to accommodate the busy
hour.
Busy Hour Calculation
From the data we can see that the busiest day is Saturday, with 25 000 shoppers in the mall,
and we assume that in the busy hour there are 20 000 shoppers present. We can then
calculate the trafﬁc load in the busy hour:
BHL ¼ users  LPU  MP  MS
Where BHL is the busy hour load; users is the number of users; LPU is the load per user
(assumed to be 20 mE); MP is the mobile penetration; and MS is the market share for the
operator.
BHL ¼ 20 000 shoppers  0:02 E  0:85 mobile penetration  0:55 market share
BHL ¼ 18:7 Erlang busy hour traffic
The GOS was 2%, so using the Erlang table we can see that we need 27 trafﬁc channels in
order to support this trafﬁc.
The Business Case Calculation
In order to evaluate the business case, we need to sum up all the trafﬁc for the week. On
weekdays the mall is open for 10 h, and on Saturday for 4 h. This is an average of 1800
shoppers per hour on weekdays and 6250 on Saturdays. Using the average of 20 mE per
shopper, we can calculate the trafﬁc production per hour: we know that 1 E produces 60 call
min/h; 20 mE will then produce 60  0:02 ¼ 1:2 call min=h on average.
We need to incorporate the market share of 55% and the mobile penetration of 85%, so for
the operator we have an average of 1800  0:55  0:85 ¼ 841:5 users=h on weekdays, and
6250  0:55  0:85 ¼ 2921:8 users=h on Saturdays. Using the 1.2 call min/h, we can
calculate the production:
daily production ¼ users  call min per user  opening hours
total all weekdays ¼ 842:5  1:2  10  5 ¼ 50 550 call min for all five days
Saturdays ¼ 2921:8  1:2  4 ¼ 14024:6 call min per Saturday
The total production per week is then ¼ 50 550 þ 14 024:6 ¼ 64 574 call min.
We could also have done the calculation in Erlang:
Erlang ¼ users  E per user  opening hours
All five weekdays ¼ 842:5  0:02  10  5 ¼ 842:5 E per week.
232
Indoor Radio Planning

Saturdays ¼ 2921:8  0:02  4 ¼ 233:7 E per Saturday:
One week is a traffic production of 842:5 þ 233:7 ¼ 1076:2 E
We know that one E is 60 call min, so we can easily convert back to call minutes:
call min ¼ E  60
call min ¼ 1076:2  60 ¼ 64 574 call min
6.1.12 Base Station Hotels
Load sharing can be used on a large scale, and be a type of ‘base station hotel’, where a
central resource of base stations distributes coverage and capacity to many buildings in the
same area, typically a campus environment. This has several advantages but the main points
are:
 Very high trunking gain.
 Low cost rollout – only needs one base station and site support.
 Only needs one equipment room.
 Easy upgrades in capacity.
Base stations are designed by deploying optical transmission between active DAS solutions.
One central point will have the base station and main unit located, and from there coverage
and capacity are distributed to nearby buildings. One must be careful with the total delay
introduced by the distribution system, and not exceed the maximum timing advance in GSM;
the synchronization window in UMTS must be tuned accordingly (see Chapter 10)
6.1.13 Data Capacity
Unlike voice service, data trafﬁc is normally not time-sensitive: short delays of SMSs, or
emails or slightly degradation of data speed will normally not impact the user perception of
the quality of service. Therefore, when designing capacity for data services there are more
dynamics, in terms of ‘blocking’, etc.
We cannot user Erlang to estimate the capacity need for data, but we must realize that the
amount of data trafﬁc will take up capacity that could have been used for voice. Normally
mobile operators will design the data capacity per user in kbps. Advanced trafﬁc control
parameter settings in the network allow us to adjust various margins to control the amount of
data trafﬁc, and the remaining capacity for voice service.
Design targets for indoor data service are normally expressed as maximum data speeds
and the maximum number of users for a particular data speed. Guarantees for quality of
service are relaxed.
The increasing need for high-quality data services puts special demands on delay and
round-trip delay. The speciﬁc design requirement is directly related to the speciﬁc service;
therefore it is hard to give any concrete guidelines here.
Trafﬁc Dimensioning
233

Backhaul Issues
On UMTS and HSPA the data service required in the indoor cell will demand bandwidth on
the backhaul transmission line from the base station to the network. This is a major issue for
the mobile operators; it does not make sense if the indoor system can support 14 Mbps if the
backhaul transmission is limited to 2 Mbps.

Noise
Noise performance and noise calculations are the most important aspects in radio planning.
The quality of any radio link is not deﬁned by the absolute signal level, but by the signal-to-
noise ratio. The lower the noise is relative to the signal level, the better the radio
performance. Radio quality and mobile data rates are dependent on a certain signal-to-
noise ratio. The better the SNR, the better the quality, the higher the data rate on the radio
link will be.
Many RF planners consider the issue regarding noise in DAS systems, on the UL of their
link budget to be ‘black magic’. However, if you do not overcomplicate the subject of noise,
the concept is really pretty straight forward and easy to understand. Understanding noise and
noise calculations is crucial for the radio planner in designing any RF system. Radio
planners need to understand that passive loss in a DAS system will also increase the total
system noise ﬁgure. Noise power generated by ampliﬁers and the base station also has a big
impact on the performance of the radio link.
Over the following pages, I will present the basics of noise, by presenting examples
of ampliﬁer conﬁgurations and analyzing the performance step by step. All the examples on
the next pages have been calculated on a standard scientiﬁc pocket calculator (the one on the
cover on this book). You do not need advanced computer programs to be in control of the
noise calculations when designing passive or active DAS solutions. However, the creation of
spreadsheets in Excel for doing the trivial part of the work with these calculations is
recommended. It saves a lot of time, and you can limit the mistakes.
7.1 Noise Fundamentals
Any object capable of allowing the ﬂow of any electric current will generate noise. The noise
is generated by random vibrations of electrons in the material. The vibrations, and hence the
noise power, are proportional to the physical temperature in the material. This noise is
referred to as ‘thermal noise’.

7.1.1 Thermal Noise
Thermal noise is ‘white noise’; white noise has its power distributed equally throughout the
total RF spectrum, from the lowest frequency all the way to the highest microwave
frequency.
Spectral Noise Density
In other words, the power spectral density of white noise is constant over the RF frequency
spectrum; hence the noise power is proportional to the bandwidth. If the bandwidth of the RF
channel is doubled, the thermal noise power will also double (þ3 dB).
Thermal Noise Level
In order to be able to calculate the noise power of a given bandwidth, you need to establish
the ‘base noise’, that is, the noise in 1 Hz bandwidth. Knowing this level, you can simply
multiply the noise power in 1Hz by the bandwidth in Hz. Thermal noise power is deﬁned as
P ¼ 10 logðKTBÞ
Where P is the noise power at the output of the thermal noise source (dB W), K is Boltzmann’s
constant ¼ 1:380  1023 (J/K), T is temperature (K) and B is the bandwidth (Hz).
Reference Noise Level per 1 Hz
At room temperature (17 C/290 K), in a 1 Hz bandwidth we can calculate the power:

where dBm takes its reference as 1 mW. The relation between 1 W and 1 mW is
1=0:001 ¼ 1000 ¼ 30 dBm, i.e. 1 W ¼ 30 dBm. Therefore you can calculate that the
thermal noise power at (17 C/290 K) in a 1 Hz bandwidth in dBm:
thermal noise power ¼ 204 þ 30 ¼ 174 dBm=Hz
where 174 dBm/Hz in noise power is the reference for any noise power calculation when
designing radio systems. Relative to the bandwidth, you can use the reference level of the
174 dBm/Hz and simply multiply it by the actual bandwidth of the radio channel. It
does not matter if it is a radio service that operates on 450 MHz or at 2150 MHz, the noise
power/Hz will be the same if the radio channel bandwidth is the same.
Reference Noise Level for GSM and DCS/UMTS
The noise power density is frequency-independent: the noise power remains the same no
matter what the radio frequency. The noise power is equally distributed throughout the
spectrum and is related to the bandwidth of the RF channel.

GSM and DCS
Using 174 dBm/Hz, we can calculate the thermal noise ﬂoor for the 200 kHz channel as
used for GSM/DCS. We just calculate the thermal noise in that bandwidth:
KTB for GSM ð200 kHzÞ ¼ 174 dBm=Hz þ 10 logð200:000 HzÞ ¼ 121 dBm
The 121 dBm is therefore the absolute lowest noise power we will have in a 200 kHz GSM/
DCS channel.
UMTS
The UMTS radio channel is 3.84 MHz. This makes the thermal noise ﬂoor for UMTS:
KTB for UMTSð3:84 MHzÞ ¼ 174 dBm=Hz þ 10 logð3:840:000 HzÞ ¼ 108 dBm
7.1.2 Noise Factor
The noise factor (F) is deﬁned as the input signal-to-noise ratio (S/N or SNR) divided by the
output signal-to-noise ratio. In other words the noise factor is the amount of noise introduced
by the ampliﬁer itself, on top of the input noise. For a passive system such as a cable, the
SNR would also be degraded, by attenuating the signal nearer to the thermal noise ﬂoor
would equally degrade the SNR.
The noise factor is a linear value:
noise factor ðFÞ ¼ SNRðinputÞ
SNRðoutputÞ
7.1.3 Noise Figure
The noise ﬁgure (NF) is noise factor described in dB, and is the most important ﬁgure to note
on the uplink of any DAS or ampliﬁer system. The NF will affect the DAS sensitivity on the
uplink, and will determine the performance of the uplink. This will be the limiting factor for
the highest possible data rate the radio link can carry, no matter whether it is GPRS, EDGE,
HSUPA or any other service. The lower the NF, the better the performance.
noise figure ðNFÞ ¼ 10 logðFÞ
7.1.4 Noise Floor
The noise ﬂoor is the noise power at a given noise ﬁgure at a given bandwidth; you can
calculate the noise power or noise level for a receiver, ampliﬁer or any other active component.
noise power ðnoise floorÞ ¼ KTB þ NF þ gain of the device
A typical case for a GSM BTS is shown in Figure 7.1.
Noise
237

7.1.5 The Receiver Sensitivity
Knowing the NF and bandwidth of the receiver in the BTS, you can calculate the receiver
sensitivity. However, ﬁrst you need to calculate the noise ﬂoor of the receiver.
Noise Floor
As an example, we can take a GSM receiver as shown in Figure 7.1 with an NF of 4 dB, then
the noise ﬂoor for that receiver can be calculated as:
receiver noise floor ¼ KTB þ NF
receiver noise floor ¼ 121 dBm þ 4 dB ¼ 117 dBm
This is the base noise power, the absolute lowest signal level present at the receiver input, a
noise power of 117 dBm, a noise level generated by the receiver itself.
Sensitivity
With reference to the noise ﬂoor, you can calculate the minimum signal level for any given
service that the receiver is able to detect; you just need to reference the required SNR for the
service, and make sure the service is the required level above the noise ﬂoor of the receiver.
If, for example, you want to provide a GSM voice service, you need a 9 dB SNR. You can
calculate the minimum required level the receiver will be able to detect to produce the
quality needed for voice (without adding any fading margins):
receiver sensitivity ¼ receiver noise floor þ service SNR requirement
receiver sensitivity ¼ 117 þ 9 ¼ 108 dBm
Thus the lowest detectable signal for a voice call will be 108 dBm. Therefore the receiver
sensitivity for GSM voice is 108 dBm in this example, excluding any fading margins.

7.1.6 Noise Figure of Ampliﬁers
As in the example with the receiver above, you can calculate the noise increase in a single
ampliﬁer, knowing the bandwidth of the signal, the NF and the gain of the ampliﬁer.
Example: 30 dB Ampliﬁer with 10 dB NF
Using an ampliﬁer for GSM with a 200 kHz bandwidth with 30 dB gain and an NF of 10 dB
(as shown in Figure 7.2), you can calculate what happens if you feed the ampliﬁer a signal of
90 dBm (as shown in Figure 7.3). Some would consider this a relatively low signal, but the
quality, the SNR of the input signal, is actually good because in this example there is no
interference from any source present at the input. The only noise power present on the input
of the ampliﬁer is the KTB (121 dBm/200 kHz). Therefore we can calculate that the signal
has an SNR of 31 dB [90 dBm  ð121 dBmÞ] – this is in fact a really good quality signal.
Nevertheless, you use the ampliﬁer to boost the signal level, and you can now calculate the
consequences for the signal, the noise and the SNR at the output of the ampliﬁer.
New Noise Floor
The input signal from Figure 7.3 is fed into the ampliﬁer shown in Figure 7.2 with the
speciﬁed 30 dB gain and 10 dB NF. Naturally the ampliﬁer will amplify the signal from 90
to 60 dBm, but it will also amplify the noise at the input (KTB in this example) from 121
to 91 dBm. In addition to the 30 dB ampliﬁcation of the noise, the ampliﬁer will add an
additional 10 dB to the noise power due to the 10 dB NF (as shown in Figure 7.3), so the
output noise level from the ampliﬁer is:
NFloorOut ¼ NFloorIn þ Gain þ NF
NFloorOut ¼ 121 dBm þ 30 dB þ 10 dB ¼ 81 dBm
The Noise Figure Degrades the SNR
The result is ampliﬁcation of the wanted signal by 30 dB, from 90 dBm at the input to
60 dBm at the output – so we have a higher signal level. However, what happened to the
quality of the signal, the SNR?
NF = 10dB (F = 10)
Output
Gain = 30dB (1000)

Figure 7.2

239

We actually degraded the SNR of the signal from 31 to 21 dB. In fact, we degraded the
performance and data rate for the base station on the uplink due to the 10 dB NF degradation
of the SNR. We can conclude that an ampliﬁer will always degrade the SNR, if you consider
the ampliﬁer as a single block.
Why Do We Use Ampliﬁers?
We just calculated that the ampliﬁer will degrade the SNR, due to the NF of the ampliﬁer.
Then why do we use ampliﬁers at all, if they degrade the SNR of the signal; after all, the
performance of the signal is not the level but the SNR? To understand this we need to
analyze the impact of loss of passive cable in the system (Sections 7.2.2 and 7.2.3) and the
impact of loss in cascaded ampliﬁer systems (Section 7.2.4).
7.1.7 Noise Factor of Coax Cables
To understand how and when you can use ampliﬁers, to maximize the performance of the
DAS system, you need to understand the impact of the attenuation of a passive coax cable or
component on the total system noise ﬁgure performance. You need to realize that any loss of
a passive cable or any other passive component prior to the base station will also impact and
degrade the SNR, like the path loss on the radio link or the NF of an ampliﬁer will.
This may sound a bit odd; after all the passive cable or component will not produce any
noise power, but it will degrade the SNR performance of the system just the same. The
passive losses will diminish the signal, the ‘S’ in the SNR, whereas active elements will raise
the ‘N’ in the SNR. Both will result in degraded SNR.
We know from the previous section that the noise factor (F) is deﬁned as the input SNR
divided by the output SNR:

Example of NF of a Passive Cable with 30 dB Loss
Let us analyze the noise performance of a passive coax cable with 30 dB loss, a typical
attenuation for a passive DAS. In the example we feed the input of the cable a GSM signal
level of 75 dBm, as shown in Figure 7.4. We can calculate the SNR at the input of the cable
to be:
SNR ¼ 75 dBm  ð121 dBmÞ ¼ 46 dB ðfactor ¼ 39811Þ
At the output of the cable the signal is now attenuated with the loss of the cable by 30 dB,
and the signal level is now:
output signal level ¼ signal input  attenuation
output signal level ¼ 75 dBm  30 dB ¼ 105 dBm
The SNR at the output of the cable is:
noise is still the KTB; so the SNR ¼ 105 dBm  ð121 dBÞ ¼ 16 dB ðfactor ¼ 39:8Þ
A value of 16 dB will be acceptable for most services, but might impact the performance on
HSPA.
Now that we have the SNR for the input signal and the output signal we can calculate the
noise factor:
noise factor ðFÞ ¼ 39811
39:8 ¼ 1000

Noise
241

The noise ﬁgure of the cable is 30 dB (noise factor 1000). We can then conclude that the
noise ﬁgure of a passive component is the same as the loss or attenuation of the
component.
The SNR of the signal is now degraded by 30 dB due to the loss of the cable. Like any NF
degradation this will severely impact the performance of the RF link.
The Good SNR is Lost Forever
Amplifying the signal at the end of the cable would not help; we would also amplify the
noise (the KTB) and degrade the SNR with the NF of the ampliﬁer.
Conclusion, Loss on Passive Cables
Any loss or attenuation of a passive cable or passive component will degrade the NF with the
attenuation in dB – dB per dB. Once the SNR is degraded cable, you are getting closer to the
thermal noise ﬂoor, the KTB. There is no way back, not even with an ampliﬁer at the output
of the cable; this ampliﬁer will only degrade the SNR even more – you simply cannot
retrieve the SNR once it is lost.
7.2 Cascaded Noise
Components rarely work on a stand-alone basis. You will need to connect the base station to
the DAS via cables. The passive DAS consists of many passive cables and many passive
components, adding up the losses from the base station to the antenna and vice versa. Using
active DAS you still need to use a passive cable to connect to the main unit, and the active
DAS consists of ampliﬁers and other active components. Hybrid DAS is a mixture of a large
portion of passive components and cables, with active ampliﬁers and distribution units.
When you chain ampliﬁers and passive components or cables in a system, it is called a
‘cascaded’ system. Most RF systems will be cascaded systems. The ampliﬁer will amplify
the signal and the noise of the preceding ampliﬁer or passive component or cable, and
therefore the NF builds up.
7.2.1 The Friis Formula
We can calculate the noise factor (F) of any number of chained ampliﬁers or passive
components (stages) using the cascaded noise formula known as the Friis formula. The Friis
formula can be used for any number of cascaded components, from 1 to n. F1=G1 is the noise
factor and gain of stage 1, F2=G2 is the noise factor and gain of stage 2, etc.

Linear Gain (G)
To calculate the linear gain to use in the Friis formula, or gain factor, we use this formula:
linear gain ¼ 10½gain ðdBÞ=10
Example: Linear Gain
6 dB gain will be G ¼ 3:98
6 dB attenuation ð6 dB gainÞ G ¼ 0:251
Linear Noise Factor (F)
We calculate the linear noise factor to use in the Friis formula, using the same formula:
linear noise factor ðFÞ ¼ 10½NF ðdBÞ=10
Example
20 dB NF ðamplifierÞ will be F ¼ 100
20 dB loss ðcable NF ¼ 20 dBÞF ¼ 100
Calculation of Cascaded Noise
Knowing the gain factor and noise factor of the elements in a cascaded system, we are now
able to calculate the performance of the whole system.
Include the Passive Losses
We need to include NF and loss (attenuation ¼ negative gain) of the cables interconnecting
the ampliﬁers in the system as stages in the cascaded system, in order to accommodate the
noise factor and attenuation of these losses.
The gain factor of a passive cable is of course less than zero due to the attenuation of the
cable. When a passive component or cable is one of the stages, we need to inset the noise and
factor of the cable, as just calculated in the example above.
7.2.2 Ampliﬁer After the Cable Loss
In Section 7.1 we calculated the degradation of the signal level and SNR caused by a passive
cable or DAS, so why do we not just use an ampliﬁer to boost the signal again? Let us have a
look; in this case the ampliﬁer is connected to the end of the coax cable to compensate for
the attenuation of the cable loss of the signal, as shown in Figure 7.5. However, is this the
best approach? Let us analyze the system performance end-to-end.
Noise
243

Example
This is a two-stage system. The passive cable is stage 1 and the ampliﬁer stage 2.
We can use the Friis formula to calculate the cascaded performance of the system: the ﬁrst
stage, as shown in Figure 7.5 (always counting the stages from the input of the system), is
the coax cable; the second stage is the active ampliﬁer. Inserting the values in the Friis
formula of this two-stage system we get the cascaded noise calculation

1, with a noise factor of 1000 and a gain factor of 0.001
Signal Power and Signal-to-noise Performance
We know now that the cascaded NF of the system is 40 dB, but what happens with the signal
and the SNR?
Input Signal
We input 70 dBm at the input of the cable.
Signal Power
We can calculate the signal level throughout the system:
Signal input ¼ 70 dBm
Signal at the output of the cable ¼ 100 dBm
Gain of amplifier ¼ 30 dB
Signal at the output of the amplifier ¼ 70 dBm

The ampliﬁer actually compensates for the loss of the cable. We have restored the signal level,
but what about the quality of the signal, what about the SNR? We can start by calculating the
noise power at the ampliﬁer output. We already know the signal level to be 70 dBm.
Noise Power
After we have veriﬁed that the system maintains the signal level, we must have a look at the
impact of the different stages on the noise power: noise input ¼ KTB ¼ 121 dBm; noise at
the output of the cable ¼ 121 dBm (it cannot be lower than KTB, and the cable does not
generate noise power); noise at the input of the ampliﬁer ¼ 121 dBm; noise output from
the amplifier ¼ noise input þ gain þ NF; ¼ 121 dBm þ 30 dB þ 10 dB ¼ 81 dBm. The
cascaded noise formula gave an NF of 40 dB for the system.
We could also have used this formula for the system:
NFloorOut ¼ NFloorIn þ gain þ NF
NFloorOut ¼ 121 þ 0 þ 40 ¼ 81 dBm
Signal-to-noise Calculation
Now that we have calculated the signal level as well as the noise level on the output, the SNR
is then easy to calculate:
SNR ¼ signal power  noise power ¼ 70 dBm  ð81 dBmÞ ¼ 11 dB
Knowing the cascaded NF of the system, we could also have calculated the SNR on the
output more easily using this formula:
SNR output ¼ SNR input  NF
SNR input ¼ 70 dBm  KTB ¼ 70 dBm  ð121 dBmÞ ¼ 51 dB
SNR output ¼ 51  40 dB ¼ 11 dB
Conclusion: Passive Loss will Degrade the System
According to the cascaded noise formula, it is clear that the ﬁrst stage of the system is the
dominant factor on the system performance. In this case, the passive coax cable has the
predominant role. The 30 dB factor of the cable plays a dominant role in the cascaded noise
performance, owing to the high NF caused by the loss of the cable.
The example clearly shows that all passive loss (loss ¼ NF) prior to the ﬁrst ampliﬁer can
be added to the ampliﬁer’s NF to calculate the system NF. We can conclude that, to obtain
the best performance in a cascaded system, we need to have a low NF in stage 1, and a gain
better than 0 dB.
7.2.3 Ampliﬁer Prior to the Cable Loss
As we just documented in Section 7.1.1, having the ampliﬁer placed after the cable did not
perform that well. We concluded that this was mainly due to the high NF of stage 1, the
passive coax cable. We need as low an NF as possible in stage 1 to optimize the NF of the
Noise
245

total cascaded system. Let us try to swap the cable and the ampliﬁer, making the ampliﬁer
stage 1 and the cable stage 2, and evaluate the performance to see if we can conﬁrm this
strategy.
Example
The ﬁrst stage in Figure 7.6 (always counting from the input) is now the ampliﬁer, and the
second stage is the passive cable. Inserting the values of this two-stage system in the
cascaded noise formula we get the cascaded noise calculation:
FS ¼ F1 þ F2  1

FS ¼ 10 þ 1000  1


FS ¼ 10 þ ½0:99
FS ¼ 10:99
NF ¼ 10 logð10:99Þ ¼ 10:41 dB
Better NF
We can see that now the NF is improved close to 30 dB, and the ﬁrst conﬁguration with the
ampliﬁer after the cable the NF is 40 dB. The NF in the new conﬁguration is only 10.41 dB.
This is almost the only contribution of the 10 dB NF of the ampliﬁer in stage 1. It is evident
in the formula that the passive cable, now stage 2, has only a minor impact on the total NF of
the system.
Let us have a look at what happens with the signal and noise level through the system, by
applying the same signal at the input as in the previous example.

Signal Power
We can calculate the signal level throughout the system:
signal input ¼ 70 dBm
gain of amplifier ¼ 30 dB
signal at the output of the amplifier ¼ 40 dBm
loss of cable ¼ 30 dB
signal at the output of the cable  70 dBm
As in the example from Section 7.1.1, the ampliﬁer still compensates for the loss of the
cable, with regards to the signal – the system is ‘gain transparent’: 70 dBm input and
70 dBm output.
Noise Power
We have veriﬁed that the system maintains the signal level; we need to analyze the noise
performance and the noise power throughout the system:
noise input ¼ KTB ¼ 121 dBm
noise output amplifier ¼ KTB þ gain þ NF ¼ 121 dBm þ 30 dB þ 10 dB ¼ 81 dBm
noise output cable ¼ noise input cable  attenuation ¼ 81 dBm  30 dB ¼ 111 dBm
Signal-to-noise Calculation
The SNR is easy to calculate:
SNR ¼ signal power  noise power ¼ 70 dBm  ð111 dBmÞ ¼ 41 dB
The SNR is now 30 dB better (compared with Figure 7.5), simply due to the ampliﬁer being
stage 1, prior to the passive cable (stage 2).
Conclusions: Ampliﬁers Prior to Passive Loss can Improve Performance
From the two examples in Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 it is evident that, by placing the ampliﬁer
at the input of the system and preferably having minimum a gain equal to the subsequent
cable loss, you can improve the link. In this example this is an improvement of 30 dB. It is
evident in the cascaded noise formula that F1 plays the major role.
In the example the noise ﬁgure of the link is improved from 40 to 10.41 dB; just by
moving the ampliﬁer to the ﬁrst stage of the signal chain you gain 29.58 dB in NF. This will
‘clean’ the UL signal and improve the SNR of the link dramatically.

247

7.2.4 Problems with Passive Cables and Passive DAS
In a passive DAS the ﬁrst ampliﬁer in the system is in the base station receiver. The loss of the
passive DAS will impact the NF of the system as we just calculated from Section 7.2.2. The loss
of the passive DAS will severely impact the NF and the SNR on the UL, limiting the UL data
service performance. One decibel of passive loss prior to the base station will degrade the
system NF by 1 dB; in passive systems the attenuation is typically in the range 25–40 dB. Every
decibel lost on the passive cable is to be subtracted from the maximum allowed path loss for the
given link budget. The passive losses of the coax cable do not have to be a problem, but they will
degrade the uplink service range of the DAS antenna, as with any other loss on the radio link.
Doing the link budget calculation for a passive DAS, you will need to calculate every
antenna individually if there is different loss to each antenna from the base station. However
we also must have a pragmatic approach: if the radio service we are designing the DAS to
requires an SNR of 14 dB, we should not worry much about whether the link is performing
at 20 or 34 dB in SNR.
This is How a Low Noise Ampliﬁer Works
This is the exact reason for deploying mast-mounted ampliﬁers (LNAs) in mobile systems,
which are frequently used in UMTS deployment. A small low noise ampliﬁer is mounted
close to the antenna, in order to compensate for the loss of the feeder cable running to the
base station. Often the local LNA inside the base station will be turned off, and the tower
mounted LNA will compensate for the gain in the system. By doing so, the loss of the feeder
is compensated and the gain in the system is applied where it should be, as close to the
receive antenna as possible, before any passive losses degrade the SNR.
The LNA boosts the performance and raises the data rate on the uplink. The UL is often
the limiting factor on UMTS, especially at the higher data rates; this will impact the more
demanding uplink data services like HSUPA most. The LNA will improve the cell range on
the uplink, and thus save on roll-out cost of the network operator, or obtain better
performance for the same roll-out cost.
This Also Applies for Active DAS Systems
The exact same principle is used by some manufacturers of active DAS systems; the best
performing active DAS will actually have the remote unit placed close to the antenna. Inside
this remote unit is the ﬁrst UL ampliﬁer, the LNA. However, this only applies for pure active
systems; hybrid active DAS will, as with any other cascaded system, suffer on the NF from the
passive losses prior to the remote unit. For DAS systems where the UL data performance plays
a major role, especially UMTS and HSPA systems, you need to be very careful. Do a detailed
analysis to see if the uplink data service you are designing can cope with the NF of the DAS.
Uniform Performance
The pure active DAS system in Figure 7.7 will have the same NF at each antenna. Therefore
there will be the same uniform uplink performance throughout the DAS system, making link
budget calculation and planning easy.
248
Indoor Radio Planning

For hybrid systems the loss of the passive prior to the remote unit will impact the
performance of the NF, and might limit the uplink data speed. Do check with noise
calculations of the total system from antenna to base station in order to be sure.
Conclusion: Higher Data Rates with Low NF
The impact from the NF on the UL is evident in the link budget, especially when the radio
channel is servicing higher data rates, for UMTS and for HSPA. Refer to Chapter 8 for more
details of the link budget.

7.3 Noise Power
From the example in Section 7.2, it is clear that the NF could be improved by installing the
ampliﬁer prior to the coax cable. Place the ampliﬁer as near as possible to the signal, the
antenna. However, it is also a matter of having control of the noise power, especially in
noise-sensitive systems like UMTS/HSPA. In these systems the SNR of the system plays a
major role for the high data rate services.
Let us have a closer look at what happens with the input signal as shown in Figure 7.9
(90 dBm) and the noise in the system. Backing up the calculations with a ‘spectrum
analyzer look’, it all becomes more obvious, compared with ‘just’ looking at formulas.
7.3.1 Calculating the Noise Power of a System
An example of a pre-ampliﬁer 30 dB gain with 10 dB NF and 30 dB loss on cable is shown in
Figure 7.8. The spectrum in Figure 7.9 looks at the input signal.

Signal-to-noise Ratio at the Input of the Ampliﬁer
This is a GSM system operating at 200 kHz bandwidth; the KTB is 121 dBm (noise ﬂoor)
and we can calculate the signal-to-noise ratio:
SNR ¼ signal=noise ðlinearÞ
or in dB,
SNR ¼ signal power  noise ðdBÞ
SNR ¼ 90 dBm  ð121 dBmÞ ¼ 31 dB
Output Signal from Ampliﬁer
Analyzing the output of the ampliﬁer (Figure 7.8) as shown in Figure 7.10, we can see the
gain of the signal, as well as the noise increase caused by the gain and the NF.
Ampliﬁer Output, Signal Level
The ampliﬁer has 30 dB gain and a NF of 10 dB, so the signal is now:
output signal ¼ input signal þ gain
output signal ¼ 90 dBm þ 30 dB ¼ 60 dBm

Ampliﬁer Output, Noise Level
The ampliﬁer also ampliﬁes the input noise, the KTB (121 dBm) and adds 10 dB of
noise due to the NF of the ampliﬁer; we can calculate the new noise power:
NFloorOut ¼ NFloorIn þ gain þ NF
output noise floor ¼ input noise floor þ NF þ gain
output noise floor ¼ 121 dBm þ 10 dB þ 30 dB ¼ 81 dBm
Ampliﬁer, SNR Degradation
The NF of the ampliﬁer will degrade the signal-to-noise ratio:
SNR output ¼ SNR input  NF
SNR output ¼ 31 dB  10 dB ¼ 21 dB
Output Signal from the Coax
Present at the output of the passive cable will be the attenuated signal level from the
ampliﬁer, as well as the noise power out of the ampliﬁer. Both are attenuated by the cable
loss (30 dB), as shown in Figure 7.11.
Figure 7.11
Signal at the output of the cable; the signal and raised noise ﬂoor are attenuated by the
loss of the cable
252
Indoor Radio Planning

Output, Coax Cable
The coax cable has 30 dB of attenuation, the same as the 30 dB gain of the ampliﬁer. We can
calculate the output of both the signal and noise power of the cable:
output signal ¼ input signal  cable loss
output signal ¼ 60 dBm  30 dB ¼ 90 dBm
output noise floor ¼ system input noise floor þ system NF þ system gain
output noise floor ¼ 121 dBm þ 11 dB þ 0 dB
output noise floor ¼ 111 dBm
SNR ¼ 90 dBm  ð111 dBmÞ ¼ 21 dB
SNR is Maintained
Obviously the cable will attenuate both the wanted signal and the noise, but as long as we make
sure that the signals are not attenuated down to a level where the noise power from the ampliﬁer
will reach the KTB ð121 dBmÞ (no other noise is present than the KTB in this example), the
SNR of the system will remain intact. In this example, 81 dBm  ð121 dBmÞ ¼ 40 dB, we
can keep the impact of the SNR minimal. However, if the attenuation of the cable is higher than
the input noise power – KTB, the SNR will be degraded by the difference between the
attenuation and the margin to the KTB. This is due to the fact that the KTB, 121 dBm (200 kHz
GSM), is the absolute lowest level. Once the noise power ‘hits’ the KTB the SNR will be
degraded and we will never be able to restore the lost SNR.
High SNR Means Higher Data Rates
The performance on any radio link is not related to the absolute signal power, but to the SNR
of the radio channel. This is demonstrated in Figure 7.12; signal 1 is ‘only’ 90 dBm,
SNR = 30dB

whereas signal 2 is 30 dB higher. However, the SNR in signal 1 is 10 dB better; therefore this
link will perform much better even if the signal is 30 dB lower.
Far too often all focus is on level, but keep in mind that the quality of the radio service is
not deﬁned by the signal level, but the SNR. The better the SNR, the higher the data rates on
the radio link.
When designing 3G DAS solutions, the loss of passive cables has a big impact, due to the
higher losses on higher frequencies. The stricter SNR requirements for high data rates will
also demand good radio link quality, especially when designing HSPA solutions.
Conclusion
From the examples just covered, we can conclude that, to some extent, we can compensate
for the loss of a coax cable with the use of pre-ampliﬁers. For maximum performance we
must have the lowest possible NF of the ampliﬁer, and a gain that can compensate for the
loss of the passive cable following the ampliﬁer.
7.4 Noise Power from Parallel Systems
Often there will be more than one noise signal (noise power sources) present at the input of a
system. This could be two parts of an active DAS, using two repeaters, that needs to be
combined to a base station receiver, like the GSM (200 kHz) example in Figure 7.13.
7.4.1 Calculating Noise Power from Parallel Sources
Random Power Signals
Noise is random (white noise), and two noise signals will be noncorrelated. Thus the noise
powers (in Watts) of two sources can be added in order to calculate the total noise power
from the system.

First we need calculate the noise ﬂoor for each of the two ampliﬁers (GSM):
NFloorOut ¼ NFloorIn þ gain þ NF
NFloorOut ¼ KTB þ gain þ NF
NFloor Out amplifier 1 ¼ 121 dBm þ 10 dB þ 16 dB ¼ 95 dBm
NFloor Out amplifier 2 ¼ 121 dBm þ 20 dB þ 22 dB ¼ 79 dBm
Watts
We need to sum up the noise, by adding the power contribution from each source.
power total ¼ power 1 þ power 2 . . . power ðnÞ
Now we convert the noise powers from dBm to mW:
P ðmWÞ ¼ 10dBm=10
95 dBm ¼ 136  1012 ðmWÞ
79 dBm ¼ 12:58  109 ðmWÞ
Then we can sum up the two powers:
combined noise power ¼ 136  1012 þ 12:58  109 ¼ 12:89  109 ðmWÞ
Convert to dBm
We convert the noise power back to dBm:
noise floor ðdBmÞ ¼ 10 logðmWÞ
noise floor ðdBmÞ ¼ 10 logð12:89  109Þ ¼ 78:89 dBm
The Combiner
The noise power is combined in a splitter with 3 dB loss (F ¼ 0:5); the output noise ﬂoor
will be:
noise floor output ¼ 78:89 dBm  3 ¼ 81:89 dBm
OBS!
Note that for the ease of the example, the loss of the cables and the insertion loss of the
splitter have not been accounted for.
7.5 Noise Control
Noise control is important, especially in cascaded systems with multiple ampliﬁers and
interconnecting cable. Gains have to be adjusted according to noise ﬁgures and losses of all
the individual system components in order to optimize the performance of the whole system,
end to end.

7.5.1 Noise Load on Base Stations
When an ampliﬁer or an active DAS injects a noise power signal on the uplink port of the
base station, it may potentially cause problems that will affect the performance of the base
station. The main issue is that the injected noise will desensitize the receiver in the base
station, limiting the performance of the uplink. This issue needs special attention in
applications where an active DAS is connected to a macro cell, or if the base station is
also serving a passive DAS. In these applications we need to insure that we conﬁgure the
active part of the DAS with regards to gain and attenuation to minimize the effect of the
uplink degradation. To select the correct UL attenuation in order to minimize the noise
power, refer to Chapter 10. Furthermore, the raised noise ﬂoor has additional side effects for
GSM and UMTS systems.
7.5.2 Noise and GSM Base Stations
Injected Noise Might give Interference Alarms
GSM base stations will monitor the noise level in idle mode time slots to estimate any
potential interference problems from mobiles in trafﬁc using the same frequency, in nearby
or distant cells, PIM products, etc. This enables the base station to provide warnings about
potential interference issues that might degrade the performance.
When the noise ﬂoor on the GSM base station increases due to any external noise source,
like the active DAS, which might inject noise power on the uplink of the base station, this
will cause the BSS system to generate an ‘idle mode interference alarm’. The trigger level
for this alarm can be changed, but the solution is to attenuate the noise to a level below the
alarm value (see Chapter 10 for more details).
7.5.3 Noise and UMTS Base Stations
UMTS Systems: Noise will Affect Admission Control
Noise control is paramount for the performance of any WCDMA system, like UMTS. This is
the motivation for very strict power and noise control in UMTS. UMTS base stations will
evaluate (measure) the noise rise on the uplink in order to evaluate the load in the cell (in
UMTS trafﬁc increase is equal to the noise increase).
The UMTS base station will have a preset reference for the base level of the noise ﬂoor
with no trafﬁc, i.e. the NF of the base station itself, and with this as a reference the base
station can calculate the current load (noise) in the cell. The purpose of this noise control is
not to admit new trafﬁc if the cell exceeds the pre-set maximum noise increase or load rate.
A load rate of 50% in a UMTS cell is equal to a noise rise of 3 dB.
If we inject noise into a UMTS base station that increases the noise ﬂoor by 3 dB, then the
base station might be tricked into evaluating the current trafﬁc load as 50%, even with no
trafﬁc. The base station will then only admit another 10% trafﬁc if the maximum load is
preset to 60%.
The result will be that this base station will only be capable of picking up 10% trafﬁc and
will be heavily underutilized if we do not minimize the noise load from the external source.
256
Indoor Radio Planning

Solution
First of all, the uplink gain of any in-line ampliﬁer in a DAS system should only be adjusted to
a level where it compensates for the losses of the subsequent passive network. This will insure
that the noise build-up is kept to a minimum, and the noise power injected into the base station
or ampliﬁer is at the level of the KTB, minimizing the ramped-up noise of the system.
The solution is to attenuate the noise (and signal), in order to lower the noise load of the
base station. As we have just clariﬁed, we can do that without affecting the SNR as long as
we keep clear of the KTB (see Section 7.3.1).
It is impossible to completely remove the noise power on the input without degrading the
SNR of the system. Luckily for UMTS, where the noise control is crucial for the
performance of admission control, you can offset the base station noise reference level.
For further details refer to Chapter 10.
7.6 Updating a Passive DAS from 2G to 3G
In recent years RF designers have tried to prepare their passive DAS designs for UMTS to
some extent. Often the planning of these passive DAS was done years prior to the launch of
their UMTS service. Thus, it lacks a UMTS link budget, guidelines and knowledge as to how
the NF caused by the attenuation of the passive system would impact the 3G uplink
performance once implemented.
Many of these GSM systems were ‘future proofed’ to support UMTS, normally by using
passive components that covered the 2100 MHz band, and sometimes a slightly heavier coax
cable.
For some of these projects it has become clear that, in some areas of the building,
especially in the areas serviced by the most remote antennas, the antennas with the highest
loss have problems with UL data speed on UMTS, and in particularly with HSUPA.
7.6.1 The 3G/HSPA Challenge
The reason for this is often the increased loss, the higher noise ﬁgure on the passive DAS
when the frequencies get higher, but also the much stricter SNR requirements for the high
data rate on 3G/HSPA. These requirements are covered in more detail in Chapter 8.
Solution
As we have just explored in the ﬁrst sections of Chapter 7, we can use ampliﬁers to improve the
performance in the part of the passive DAS that is having difﬁculties with the loss/noise ﬁgure.
Often antennas close to the base station and those with relatively low loss will perform
acceptable. Typically it will be just the more distant part of the passive DAS that needs an
upgrade to perform on UMTS/HSPA.
Example
This is a real-life practical example on why and how we can upgrade a passive DAS from 2G
to 2G þ 3G. This passive DAS, shown in Figure 7.14, was originally designed for GSM900.
All components, splitters, tappers, etc., were prepared for 1800 and 2100 MHz, so the system
Noise
257

was to some extent prepared for the UMTS upgrade, which was expected within 5–7 years
after installing the original DAS system.
7.6.2 The UMTS Problem
However, after the deployment of UMTS, it turns out that there are issues for the
performance on the uplink data service in the areas covered by the three most remote
antennas. The radio planner clariﬁed that the problem was due to the high loss on the three
remote antennas, as shown in Figure 7.15.
Cascaded noise calculations showed that the losses on the UMTS band (2100 MHz) were
now 37 dB, and that this increased the noise ﬁgure for the system performance for the three
antennas to 40 dB and degraded the data service in that area of the building.
The UL Problem on UMTS
The problem is related to the high NF that impacts the UL data performance. As we can see
in the calculation, stage 1 plays a major role in the degradation, being the passive DAS.

Conclusion on the Existing Passive DAS
The problem is related to the high NF, and impacts the UL data performance. As we can see in
the calculation, stage 1 plays a major role in the degradation, stage 1 being the passive DAS.
UMTS UL Data Coverage at 40 dB NF
When analyzing the link budget (Chapter 8), it becomes clear that the coverage range for
384 kbps is only about 11 m in the dense ofﬁce environment. The practical experience with
degraded uplink 384 kbps data performance is conﬁrmed by the link budget calculation.
Even the data services with lower data rates and less strict requirements are limited. For
UMTS UL Data service:
 384 kbps ¼ 11 m.
 128 kbps ¼ 14 m.
 64 kbps ¼ 16 m.
Several solutions were considered in order to solve the problem.
7.6.3 Solution 1, In-line BDA
The initial idea was to install one ampliﬁer after the last tapper, in order to boost all three
antennas as shown in Figure 7.16, thus only needing to install one active element in the
system, and thereby saving on hardware and installation costs.

NF ¼ 10 logð3168Þ ¼ 35 dB
Conclusion on Upgrade with Central BDA
This system with one in-line bi-directional ampliﬁer BDA and repeater is only a 5 dB
improvement on the uplink performance. The link budget calculation shows that this is
clearly not enough to get the noise ﬁgure down to a level that will improve the
performance to the required service level on higher data rates. The NF was only improved
by 5 dB.
From the cascaded noise formula we can see that stage 2 takes a big ‘hit’ from the 25 dB
loss of the passive stage 1. Thus we conclude that, in order to increase the uplink
performance of the system to a desired level, we must try to limit the impact of the passive
loss prior to stage 1 of the system. We must deploy the pre-ampliﬁer as close to the antennas
as possible to minimize the impact of the coax loss.
Solution 2, Active DAS Overlay
In order to minimize the impact of any passive loss prior to the ampliﬁer, we can now
analyze the performance if we install the ampliﬁer right next to each of the three antennas as
shown in Figure 7.17. By using the strategy, we can eliminate the passive losses in stage 1 of
the cascaded system. Note that the diagram only shows one ampliﬁer, but since the three
antennas have the exact same loss back to the base station, only one link is analyzed. The
performance for all three antennas with three ampliﬁers will be the same.

Conclusion with BDAs Installed Close to the Antennas
The cascaded noise analysis shows the result; there is a stunning 27 dB improvement of the
noise ﬁgure. This will boost the uplink performance on the desired UMTS data rates, and
even perform well on HSUPA. Furthermore, we can actually reuse most of the old GSM
installation by upgrading it with ampliﬁers close to the antennas. This will insure a fast
deployment and limited interruption of the mobile service in the building during the
installation of the upgrade.
The part of the existing passive system with relative low loss we can leave intact; here the
performance is acceptable. We only need to pinpoint the problem areas, and upgrade these
antennas.
Be careful about the noise power injected in the base stations uplink. In this case the
attenuation of the passive DAS components, from the BDA to the base station, will attenuate
the noise power, and minimize the noise load on the base station. See Chapter 10 for more
details on how to minimize the noise load on UMTS base stations using attenuators.
UMTS UL Data Coverage at 13 dB NF
The link budget analysis shows the boost in the uplink performance. The cure is clear: install
the ampliﬁer as close to the antenna as possible. This is actually how pure active DAS works

Note that ideally we should have calculated the combined NF of the three parallel BDAs, but
it turns out that the DL is now the limiting factor, and we must use another approach.
The Downlink
We just analyzed how to boost the performance on the uplink UMTS data performance, on a
passive DAS designed for GSM, but what about the performance of the downlink coverage?
After all we have 37 dB of loss on the DL from the base station room in the basement to the
topmost ﬂoors with the problem area.
In this case we are using a þ40 dBm base station (CPICH at 10% ¼ þ30 dBm), and the
CPICH power into the antenna will only be 3 dBm.
The Problem is in the Top of the Building
The problem area is actually located in ‘zone C’ of the building (see Section 3.5.6), on the
highest ﬂoors (the executive management ﬂoor), where we need a good dominant signal
from the in-building DAS system and preferably HSDPA performance.
Lack of DL Signal, CPICH Dominance
According to the free space loss formula (see Section 5.2.8), we have a path loss from the
antenna of about 67 dB at 25 m from the antenna, giving us a CPICH level of about
3 dBm  67 dB ¼ 70 dBm.
The design level for this ﬂoor is actually 65 dBm CPICH, so we need to boost the DL
power at the antenna in order to get dominance and good SNR and maintain pilot dominance
inside the building.
When analyzing the link budget, we see that for the data service for DL, we have less than
12 m of service radius.
UL/DL Service Balance
Often the highest data load is on the DL, and we have just improved the UL with the pre-
ampliﬁer to these service radiuses:
UL UMTS Service (Dense Environnent)
 384 kbps ¼ 39 m.
 128 kbps ¼ 51 m.
 64 kbps ¼ 59 m.
262
Indoor Radio Planning

There is an imbalance between the uplink and downlink performance, making the system
downlink-limited. We will need to boost the downlink level in order to balance the
performance and coverage on UL/DL.
Boost both UL and DL on UMTS
We need to boost the DL as well as the UL in order to balance the links; the solution would
be to install two-way (UL/DL) ampliﬁers close to all the distant antennas. These types of
ampliﬁers are often referred to as bi-directional ampliﬁes, but by installing remote BDAs in
the building, other considerations arise,
Installation and Performance Issues with Remote BDAs
Often it will be a major challenge to install all the required in-line UMTS BDAs, in these
typical, large indoor projects where a passive DAS designed for GSM needs an update to
perform on UMTS. The challenge is more than installing the BDAs.
Power Supply
You are frequently not allowed to tap into the existing AC power supply but will need to
install a new ‘AC group’ for the BDA cluster. Installing new AC power groups for this
throughout a large building is time-consuming, expensive and has a heavy installation
impact on the building. You also need to consider if power supply back-up will be needed for
these distributed BDAs. This distribution no-break power will further add to the cost and
complication of the system.
GSM Coverage
Make sure that the selected BDAs will not degrade the performance on the existing GSM
system. The BDAs must have a ‘bypass’ function that makes sure that any GSM (and UMTS)
signals will be bypassed through the ampliﬁer in case of malfunction or AC power loss.
Commissioning
The distributed BDAs frequently do not have a centralized control point, so setting and
tuning them must be done locally for each individual BDA. They are also often installed in
locations that are not easily accessible, such as above ceilings (they have to be close to the
antennas to perform).
Operations and Maintenance and Surveillance
In case of a fault on the system, it is challenging to ﬁnd the cause. A cluster of BDAs
often lacks a common alarm structure, and a common external alarm interface to the base
station.
7.6.4 Solution 2: Active DAS Overlay
There is actually a way to upgrade the passive DAS with remote BDAs located at the
antenna, having a common alarm infrastructure with the alarm interface to the base station
and a common centralized power supply, if we use the system from Section 4.4.3 (shown in
Figure 7.18). If you combine this small active DAS with the passive DAS in the problem
areas, the problem will be solved.

263

The Existing Passive DAS, Designed for GSM
This 14-ﬂoor ofﬁce building is designed for GSM (the passive DAS is shown in Figure 7.19),
and the performance on GSM is perfect. After several years of good GSM operation on the
DAS, UMTS was deployed. Initially the UMTS base station was connected to the DAS,
expecting full UMTS performance on the existing DAS. However it turned out that there
were problems similar to those described in the previous section: lack of pilot dominance
and high noise ﬁgure on ﬂoors 13 and 14. The users on these executive ﬂoors suffered from
degraded UMTS data performance, dropped calls and no HSPA performance. Measurements
on-site conﬁrmed the problem as lack of dominance in ‘zone C’ the most distant from the
base station, and with high signal levels from the outside network present inside the building.
As in the previous example, the cascaded noise ﬁgure of the antennas covering the topmost
ﬂoors was calculated, and link budget calculations conﬁrmed the problem.
The users on these executive ﬂoors needed an upgrade fast; the problem was solved by
deploying small local uplink and downlink ampliﬁers close to the antennas in the problem,
as described below.
The Upgrade to 3G
By deploying the small active system from Figure 7.18, you can increase the DL power and
improve the noise ﬁgure of the DAS on the two problem ﬂoors 13 and 14 (see Figure 7.20).
The downlink power from the active DAS is 15 dBm power per carrier (PPC), so the DL
could be boosted; 15 dB uplink gain and an NF of 16 dB could improve the performance of
the uplink.
You use ﬁlters installed in the base station room (S), and at the antenna locations on the
two topmost ﬂoors 13 and 14 (F) to inject the UMTS signal and to separate the GSM.
Noise Control
When connecting the active DAS system to the existing passive DAS, you must be aware
that the noise power from the active DAS can desensitize the base station and degrade the

uplink performance on the passive section of the DAS. In order to avoid this, we need to
insert an appropriate attenuator to attenuate the injected noise power. Refer to Chapter 10 for
calculation of the optimum attenuator.
The Performance
The link budget calculation shows that, after the upgrade, the DL will have more power,
producing higher downlink levels, and the uplink will perform much better due to the lower
noise ﬁgure of the system.

These measurements conﬁrm the theory, and results from other real-life upgrades and
implementations also show similar results. This approach is applicable on existing passive
DAS, boosting the DL signal and raising the UL data speed.
Still Full GSM Service
The GSM service is still maintained. The only ‘cost’ on GSM is the insertion loss of the
ﬁlters, less than 1 dB. In practice there will be no performance degradation, and the GSM
service in the building is maintained at the current level.
Conclusion: Upgrading Passive DAS to UMTS Performance
The use of remote located BDAs close to the existing antennas can increase the UL and DL
performance on an existing DAS originally designed for GSM. Using the small version of an
active DAS is applicable in practice, and use of thin IT-type cabling between the master unit
and the remote units ensures a rapid deployment of the system. In some cases you might be
able to reuse some of the existing IT cables, minimizing the need to install new ones. The
small active DAS uses central power, distributed to the remote units from the master unit, so
there will be no need for local power supply at the antenna locations. The master unit has
external alarm outputs that can be connected to the base station in order to maintain full
visibility of the status of the active elements (the MU and RUs).
7.6.5 Conclusions on Noise and Noise Control
All electronic components generate noise. The density of the noise is constant over the
spectrum, and the power is 174 dBm/Hz. This base noise is referred to as the KTB. By
multiplying the 174 dBm/Hz by the bandwidth of the radio channel, we can calculate the
absolute minimum noise level for GSM (200 kHz) as 121 dBm, and UMTS ð3:84 MHzÞ ¼
108 dBm.
The performance of a radio link is deﬁned as the signal-to-noise ratio, not the absolute
signal level. Any noise ﬁgure of an ampliﬁer or loss of a passive cable will degrade the radio
link. The loss or attenuation of a passive cable or passive component will degrade the NF
with the attenuation in decibels. Once the SNR is degraded by the passive cable, you are
getting closer to the thermal noise ﬂoor, the KTB. Then there is no way back, not even with
an ampliﬁer at the output of the cable. This ampliﬁer would only degrade the SNR even
more – you simply cannot retrieve the SNR once it is lost. Placing an uplink ampliﬁer at the
end of the passive DAS, close to the base station, will not improve the SNR, but degrade the
SNR with the noise ﬁgure of the ampliﬁer.
From the two examples in Sections 7.2.2 and 7.2.3 it is evident that you must place the
ampliﬁer at the input of the system. It is preferable to have a low noise ﬁgure in the ampliﬁer
and minimum gain as the subsequent cable has loss. With this strategy you can improve the
link, and compensate for most of the impact of the NF from the passive loss in the following
cable. In the example the link was improved by almost 30 dB. If you make sure you keep
below the maximum loss, SNR is maintained, and the performance on the RF link is
maintained.
Noise
267

When using ampliﬁers prior to the base station, you must be careful with the noise you
inject on the uplink of the base station. The uplink gain of, any in-line ampliﬁer in a DAS
system should only be adjusted to a level where it compensates for the losses of the
following passive network. This will insure that the noise build-up is kept to a minimum, and
the noise power injected into the base station or ampliﬁer is at a level of the KTB,
minimizing the ramped-up noise of the system. You can decrease the noise power down
close to the KTB with only minimum noise impact of the link.
It was also demonstrated how this basic knowledge about noise and noise control enables
us to upgrade an existing passive DAS designed for GSM to perform high data rates on
UMTS. By deploying an active DAS overlay on the part of passive DAS that are designed for
GSM, you could boost the performance on the uplink to service for UMTS/HSPA. This
strategy will boost the uplink as well as the downlink. Understanding noise and noise
performance and calculations is the basis of all radio planning.

The Link Budget
The link budget (LB) is the fundamental calculation for planning of any RF link between a
transmitter (Tx) and a receiver (Rx). In two-way calculations we actually have two LB
calculations, one for the DL and one for the UL.
The result of the link budget calculations is the maximum allowable path loss (APL) from
the base station to the mobile in the downlink and the maximum allowable link loss on the
reverse link, from the mobile to the base station the uplink. You need to include all
the attenuation and gains of the end-to-end signal path from the Tx to the Rx, the attenuation
due to the distance, adding the clutter loss of the environment, cable attenuation and antenna
gains. You will also need to include a safety margin to provide a given probability of the
desired signal, accounting for fading margins and body losses.
Depending on the type of distribution system you design, there are various parameters to
take into account when calculating the link budget. Based on these parameters for the DAS,
the radio service requirement, and the impact of noise from existing signal sources operating
on the same frequency or channel, you must calculate the link budget for both links, the
uplink and the downlink, to determine the service range of the system in both directions. The
link budget for the particular radio service range can be either UL- or DL-limited; this will
depend on the parameters affecting the links. One cell can be downlink-limited for one type
of service, and the same cell can be uplink-limited for another service (service proﬁle).
8.1 The Components and Calculations of the RF Link
Let us try to break down the link budget and have a look on the most important parameters in
the calculation. The simplest LB calculation looks, in principle, like this:
Rx level ðdBmÞ ¼ Tx power ðdBmÞ  cable attenuation ðdBÞ  propagation losses
þ antenna gain ðdBÞ
However, the real-life GSM and UMTS LB are more complex, so you will need to break
down the link budget calculation into more detail.

# 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

8.1.1 The Maximum Allowable Path Loss
The essential purpose of making the link budget is to calculate the maximum allowable path
loss, as shown in Figure 8.1. Once you have calculated the APL, you can calculate the
service area and service radius to use for antenna placement in the building.
Note that the example in Figure 8.1 is rather simpliﬁed, and merely shows a few of the
factors you need to take into account when calculating the link budget. This simpliﬁed
example shows only the downlink, but both the downlink and the uplink APL need to be
calculated, for all services on the DAS.
8.1.2 The Components in the Link Budget
In order to understand the details in the link budget for indoor DAS design, you need to
break it down to the all various components of gains and losses. Then you can understand
how the different parameters interact and affect the link budget calculation.
The components of the basic link budget are shown in Figure 8.2. To be able to do a
detailed analysis, you need to take a look at the different components of the link budget
calculation shown in basic form in Table 8.1, one by one (the symbols from Table 8.1 are
deﬁned below).
 a, BS power (dBm): this is the generated RF power from the base station, at the antenna
connector of the output of the base station rack.
 b, Feeder loss (dB): this is the attenuation of the coax cable from the BS to the antenna.
The loss is symmetrical for the UL and DL.
 c, BS antenna gain (dBi): this is the antenna gain (directivity) of the BS antenna.
 d, EiRP (dBm): effective isotropic radiated power – this is the radiated power from the
base station antenna. It is BS power  feeder loss þ antenna gain.
 e, MS antenna gain (dBi): the mobile terminal antenna has a gain that we need to include
in the LB. This antenna gain may in fact be negative! There are many measurements

available that show the gain for various types of mobiles. Some of these measurements
show mobiles with antenna gain down below 7 dBi. That is important to realize this
when doing the LB calculation.
 f, Mobile station noise ﬁgure, dB: the ampliﬁers and electronics inside a receiver will
generate noise. The relative power of that noise is deﬁned as the noise ﬁgure. This NF
together with the thermal noise ﬂoor will deﬁne the reference for the noise ﬂoor at the MS;
refer to Chapter 7 for more details.
 g, MS noise ﬂoor: as an example consider a typical GSM MS with an NF of 8 dB. You
simply add the NF to the thermal noise to calculate the noise ﬂoor in the MS
noise floor ¼ noise power at 1 Hz þ NF þ 10 logðbandwidthÞ
noise floor ¼ 174 dBm=Hz þ NF þ 10 logðbandwidthÞ
noise floor ¼ 174 dBm=Hz þ 8 dB þ 10 logð200 000 HzÞ ¼ 113 dBm
 h, Thermal noise ﬂoor (dBm): depending on the operating bandwidth of the radio
channel, there will be certain thermal noise ﬂoor. This is a physical constant. At room
temperature (17C), the thermal noise ﬂoor is deﬁned as:
noise floor ¼ 174 þ 10 logðbandwidthÞ
So for GSM(200 kHz) the thermal noise ﬂoor will be:
GSM ¼ 174 dBm=Hz þ 10 logð200 000 HzÞ ¼ 121 dBm
For UMTS (3.84Mc) it will be
UMTS ¼ 174 dBm=Hz þ 10 logð3 840 000 HzÞ ¼ 108 dBm
 i, Interference: interfering base stations transmitting on the same carrier must be taken into
account. This interference will add to the noise ﬂoor, increasing the signal requirement to
fulﬁll the SNR. It is very important to take this interference into account when doing the
LB. It is highly recommended always to perform a measurement (see Section 5.2.2) of the
interference level present in the building, and to use this input when calculating the link
budget. In this example the interference is set to 120 dBm (very low).
UMTS Noise Increase
On UMTS we also need to take into account the noise increase due to the trafﬁc load in the
cell. Therefore, with 50% of load in the cell we need to add 3 dB in noise increase; refer to
Section 2.4.3 for more detail on how to calculate the noise increase.
 j, Service SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) requirements (dB): for the speciﬁc service we need
to support over the radio link there will be a quality requirement, in terms of SNR. This is
272
Indoor Radio Planning

a deﬁnition of how strong the signal receive level has to be above the noise ﬂoor in the
channel in order for the RF service to work. If we have a service that needs 9 dB SNR (GSM
voice) in order to work, the lowest acceptable signal would be:
Required signal level ¼ 113 dBm ðMS noise floorÞ þ 9 dB ðservice requirementÞ
¼ 104 dBm
The SNR Requirement is Related to the Data Rate
The critical parameter that affects the service level on the UL and DL is not the absolute
signal level on the link but the quality of the RF link, the SNR. For different services
there will be different demands on the quality of the RF link. The higher the service
demands (data rates), the better the RF link needs to be. This is why the higher data rates
on UMTS and HSPA are more sensitive to any degradation of the indoor DAS noise
ﬁgure or attenuation. Therefore we must insure the lowest possible noise ﬁgure and
attenuation of the DAS, in order to perform at the higher data rates, and cater for future
data services.
UMTS
For UMTS design we need to deﬁne the desired Eb=No and also apply the processing gain of
the radio service.
Processing gain ¼ chip rate=user data rate
Processing gain ¼ 3:84 M=user rate ðlinearÞ
Processing gain ¼ 10 logð3:84 M=user rateÞ ðdBÞ
Using these formulas we can calculate the processing gain of the speciﬁc UMTS data service
as shown in Table 8.2.
Examples
Processing gain for high  speed data; 384 kbps : 10 logð3:84 Mcps=384 kbÞ ¼ 10 dB
Processing gain for speech 12:2 kbps : 10 logð3:84 Mcps=12:2 kbpsÞ ¼ 25 dB

The Link Budget
273

The use of orthogonal spreading codes and processing gain is the main feature of UMTS/
WCDMA, giving the system robustness against self-interference. The main reason is the
frequency reuse factor of 1, due to the rejection of noise from other cells/users.
When we know the required bit power density, Eb=No(energy per bit/noise) for the speciﬁc
service (voice 12:2 kbps þ 5 dB; data þ 20 dB), we are able to calculate the required signal-
to-interference ratio.
Voice at 12.2 kbps needs approximately 5 dB wideband signal-to-interference ratio minus
the processing gain, 5  25 dB ¼ 20 dB. In practice, the processing gain means that the
signal for the voice call can be 20 dB lower than the interference/noise, but still be decoded.
Soft Handover Gain (UMTS)
In traditional macro link budgets you will include a soft handover gain, typical using 3 dB.
This is because the users on the edge of the cell are in soft handover, and using macro
diversity improves the link. However, for indoor UMTS planning I recommend not using the
soft handover gain in the link budget. You should minimize the areas of soft handover, to
limit the load on the node B and the network.
GSM Example
The impact on the data service offerings in a typical indoor GSM900 system can be seen in
Table 8.3. This example shows ﬁrst and foremost the demand on the SNR and the C/I
(channel/interference).
For GSM voice the demand is a minimum of 9 dB C/I. In this example (the downlink
budget in Table 8.1), the maximum allowable link loss on the DL in order to provide voice
service is 97 dB. Therefore, the total loss from the base station to the mobile must not exceed
97 dB. In this environment (moderate dense ofﬁce) that corresponds to about 55 m (note that
other parameters and margins also play a major role – the sensitivity of the mobile, the noise
ﬁgure of the mobile, the fading margin, co-channel interference etc.; all these parameters
will be elaborated later on in this chapter).

Indoor Radio Planning

In this case the DL level needed to provide sufﬁcient signal level is 85 dBm. Whereas
one can see that the service requirement for EDGE-MCS9 (59.2 kbps) is 23 dB stricter on
C/I, with a maximum allowable path loss of 74 dB. This results in a service level of
62 dBm, or a reduction of the service range from the indoor DAS antenna from 55 m to
support voice to only 14 m to support EDGE-MCS9.
 k, Mobile sensitivity: interference, i.e. signals transmitting on the same frequency as the
supported service, will desensitize the receiver in the mobile.
Knowing the interference coming from other base stations using the same DL
frequency (measured with a test receiver as described in Section 5.2.2), and knowing
the mobile noise ﬁgure, the mobile antenna gain and the SNR requirement for the
speciﬁc service, you can then calculate the mobile receiver sensitivity for the speciﬁc
service:
Rx sensitivity ¼ 10logð10i=fþTHnoiseÞ þ 10ðMSNFþTHnoiseÞ=10  MS antenna gain þ service Req:
In this example, shown in Table 8.1, the MS sensitivity is calculated to 103.2 dBm.
The Radio Channel
 l þ m, Fading margins: in any RF environment there will be fading due to reﬂections and
diffractions of the RF signal. Several books and reports have been written about fading
margins and RF planning; this is beyond the scope of this book. Typically, in indoor
environments you should use a total fading margin of around 16–18 dB to obtain 95% area
probability of the desired coverage (Refer to [6]).
RF DL Planning Level
If we continue to calculate using the example from Figure 8.1, we can calculate the planning
level for the RF signal:
 n, Body loss (dB): the MS will be affected by the user, who will act as ‘clutter’ between
the MS and the BS antenna. To take this into account in the LB, you will need to apply
‘body loss’ to the calculation. A typical number used for body loss is 3 dB.
 o, Total design margin: in this example, for the total design margin i,
total fading margin ¼ log  normal shadow fading þ multipath fading þ body loss
total fading margin ¼ 10 dB þ 6 dB þ 3 dB ¼ 19 dB
 p, Minimum level at cell edge (RxMin): knowing the mobile sensitivity and the total
fading margin, we can now calculate the design goal at the cell edge:
RxMin ¼ mobile sensitivity þ design margin
RxMin ¼ 103:2 dBm þ 19 dB ¼ 84:2 dBm
The Link Budget
275

This is 0.8 dB higher than the signal requirement shown in Table 8.3, and is due to the
120 dBm interference on the channel, as shown in Table 8.1.
 q, Maximum allowable path loss: ﬁnally, we can calculate the maximum link loss that can
fulﬁll the design criteria. We know the radiated power EiRP and the minimum signal level
at the cell edge; therefore we can calculate the APL:
APL ¼ EiRP  RxMin
APL ¼ 7 dBm  ð84:2 dBmÞ ¼ 91:2 dB
 r, Calculating the antenna service radius: now we have established the APL, we can
calculate the service range of the antenna in the particular environment:
coverage radius ðmÞ ¼ 10ðAPLPL1mÞ=PLS
Remember the Uplink!
We have only done half the link budget at this point. We need to perform the exact same
calculation, in reverse, for the uplink (as shown in Table 8.4). For GSM indoor planning, the
LB will often be limited by the DL power. However, it is important to conﬁrm this in the LB,

so always perform a two-way link budget calculation for GSM as well. For UMTS/HSPA
you could well be limited by the UL, depending on the load proﬁle of the cell.
Balance the Link
You will have different service distance on the DL compared with the UL. Try to balance
your LB, maybe with parameter adjustments on the cell, once it is in service. It makes no
sense to blast to high power on any link UL or DL if you are dependent on the other link
limiting the service radius of the cell. Then you might as well power down the dominant link
and balance the LB, thus limiting the interference from that particular link to adjacent cells
or mobiles.
8.1.3 Link Budgets for Indoor Systems
When designing indoor systems, there are some additional parameters you need to take into
account in the link budget calculation. Different parameters need to be considered,
depending on whether it is a passive or an active DAS you are designing (see Figure 8.3).
8.1.4 Passive DAS Link Budget
The passive DAS is based on coaxial cables and splitters, as described in Section 4.3. From a
link budget calculation it is fairly easy to design a passive DAS. The attenuation of the DAS
Figure 8.3
Components of the indoor link budget
The Link Budget
277

will degrade both UL and DL with the same loss, corresponding to added link loss due to
distance. The challenge is to get the exact information regarding the attenuation to each
antenna in the system. This depends on the exact installation and cable route. Therefore
detailed information on the actual installation is needed, and this is upfront before any
system is installed. This can be a challenge for the radio planner, often making passive DAS
design more installation planning exercise than radio planning.
The Downlink Calculation
The passive DAS will attenuate the power from the signal source, base station or repeater, so be
sure to offset the DL power with the loss of the passive DAS when calculating the link budget.
Be aware that you need to evaluate the DL link budget for all antennas in the system, owing to
the fact that the individual antennas in the system will have different losses, and hence different
radiated power levels and service ranges. Be very careful not to overdrive the passive DAS,
especially when operating a multicarrier or multioperator system. It is often forgotten how high
the power on the passive DAS actually is, especially on the components close to the base
stations. One example is a system with four GSM base stations, each feeding 43 dBm to eight
carriers, a total of 24 carriers; 43 dBm is 20 W, and the composite power will be 58 dBm, or
630 W. Even using good PIM with speciﬁcations of 120 dBc, you might have severe inter-
modulation products (refer to Section 5.7.3 for more details on PIM).
The Uplink Calculation
The UL part of the link budget calculation of the passive DAS is also straightforward; the
attenuation of the DAS will impact the NF of the base station, as described in Section 7.1.7.
The different attenuation from the base station to each individual antenna will result in
different UL coverage ranges from each antenna, so be sure to calculate all antenna
locations.
8.1.5 Active DAS Link Budget
The active DAS is described in detail in Section 4.4. An active DAS will typically be
‘transparent’, so the downlink signal you feed into the DAS you will have out of the
antennas, and vice versa for the uplink plus or minus the gain you set in the system. This
makes active DAS very easy to design and implement since you do not have to take cable
distances and losses into concern. However, there are other things you need to pay attention
to when calculating the link budget for an active DAS.
The Downlink Calculation
The limitation on the downlink power in an active DAS is usually the composite power
capabilities of the DL ampliﬁer in the ‘remote unit’. The RU is located close to the antenna
and will have one shared ampliﬁer that the entire spectrum supported by the DAS is sharing.
For multiband DAS you would typical have dedicated ampliﬁers for each supported band.
Typically you would have a power level at one carrier of, for example, 15 dBm, and then
278
Indoor Radio Planning

every time you doubled the number of carriers you would back off about 3–3.5 dB in order
not to overdrive the system and cause distortion. Be very careful only to operate the active
DAS system at the speciﬁed PPC (see Section 4.12.2 for more details). Otherwise you might
cause interference problems for own and other services.
Hybrid DAS Link Budget
The hybrid DAS as described in Section 4.5 is a mix of passive and active DAS;
you need to incorporate both strategies from above when doing the link budget
calculation.
8.1.6 The Free Space Loss
The Path Loss
A major component in the LB is the path loss between the Tx and Rx antenna. This loss
depends on the distance between the Tx and Rx antenna, and the environment that the RF
signal has to pass. Free space loss (Figure 8.4) is a physical constant. This simple RF formula is
valid up to about 50 m from the antenna when in line-of-sight indoors. The free space loss does

not take into account any additional clutter loss or reﬂections, hence the name. The free space
loss formula is:
free space loss ðdBÞ ¼ 32:44 þ 20ðlog FÞ þ 20ðlog DÞ
where f ¼ frequency ðMHzÞ and D ¼ distance ðkmÞ.
8.1.7 The Modiﬁed Indoor Model
In addition to the free space loss, we have the loss due to the environment. The main
component from the indoor environment is penetration losses through walls and ﬂoor
separations. The complete ‘model’ for indoor propagation loss could look like this:
path loss ¼ free space loss þ wall loss
This simple model gives a fair accuracy, provided that you have sufﬁcient data for wall
losses for the particular building (see Figure 8.5).
Figure 8.5
Indoor ‘model’ calculator in Excel, the ﬁrst homemade tool I ever made for indoor
designs
280
Indoor Radio Planning

It is straightforward to create your own model and also to calculate the free space loss, and
add the losses of the various walls. Obviously this method is not 100% accurate – no
prediction tools actually are. However, it gives you a fair estimate of the possible path. The
tool shown in Figure 8.5 is my ﬁrst indoor link calculator; I have done about 75 indoor GSM
designs using this calculator.
8.1.8 The PLS Model
A widely used model for calculating the path loss relies on ‘path loss slopes’ (PLS). These
PLS are different attenuation slopes for different types of environments and frequencies. A
general model is based on empirical analysis of a vast number of measurement samples in
these different types of environments.
How is the PLS Established?
The PLS is derived from measurement samples in different environments (see Figure 8.6).
The path loss is measured at different distances from the antenna, and it is possible to
average out these thousands of measurements and calculate a path loss slope.
It is important to note that the PLS is an average value, and that there will be both positive
and negative variations from the PLS. It is my experience that these variations will be
covered by the fading margins suggested in Section 8.1.2.

It is very important to use the right PLS constant, according to the environment. The
model based on the PLS values from Table 8.5 looks like this:
path loss ðdBÞ ¼ PL at 1 m ðdBÞ þ PLS  logðdistance; mÞ
You can calculate the free space loss at 1 m, using the free space formula from Section 8.1.6:
 950 MHz ¼ 32 dB.
 1850 MHz ¼ 38 dB.
 2150 MHz ¼ 39 dB.
You will ﬁnd different PLS values from various sources; the internet is a good place to start.
You might even develop your own PLS based on indoor RF survey measurements (see Section
5.2.5) in thevarious environment types and on the frequencies you use. Or you can use Table 8.5
as a start, and ﬁne tune these PLS to match your needs. Do understand that these types of RF
models are just guidelines, and can never be considered 100% accurate. Use these models
accordingly, and apply some common sense based on your experience. If in doubt, then always
do an RF survey measurement toverify the model used (see Section 5.2.5). Thus it would also be
possible to establish the correct fading margin for the particular environment measured.
In Figure 8.7 you can see an example of the suggested PLS in Table 8.5 for a dense ofﬁce
environment, for GSM, DCS and UMTS frequencies. There is considerable difference
between the PLS attenuation and the free space loss, as shown in Figure 8.8. Note that these
PLS models assume that you use common sense when placing the antennas, so only use
visible antenna placement below the ceiling (refer to Section 5.3 for more details).

8.1.9 Calculating the Antenna Service Radius
When you have completed the link budget calculation and have established the APL, you
can calculate the service range of the antenna in the particular environment:
coverage radius ðmÞ ¼ 10ðAPLPL1mÞ=PLS
Examples of DL Service Ranges for Indoor Antennas
This is just an example on the downlink service ranges from an indoor DAS antenna
(Table 8.6). Make your own link budget calculation to establish what the actual service range
is for both uplink and downlink for your particular design.

Tools for Indoor Radio Planning
The trade of indoor radio planning relies on several types of tools to aid the radio planner
with the process. These tools help in accurately predicting and verifying radio coverage,
capacity and quality. More logistical tools may be also needed to calculate the component
count, equipment lists and project costs. Obviously tools for design documentation,
diagrams, etc., are needed as well. There are many different types of tools, and each
operator has a tool box that relies on different types of tools for the various aspects of the
process.
The choice of the tools you should select is must be relevant to your individual needs. If
you only design three to ﬁve indoor projects per year, it might be alright to use standard
spreadsheets for link budget calculations and simple diagram drawing programs for
documentation. However, if you are dedicated to indoor radio planning on a full-time
basis and design 20 or more indoor systems per year, it would be worthwhile investing in
automatic tools that can make your design process more cost-efﬁcient and improve the
quality of your work. Remember that the design documentation should also be used by other
parties in the project, so all documentation must be clear and precise.
In the following, examples of tools are presented. These are just examples, and many
different tools from various manufacturers are available, each with their own pros and cons.
9.1 Live and Learn
Whatever nice tools you might have on your PC, it is highly recommended to get out there in
the building, walk the turf, conduct measurements, take part in the optimization campaign
and try to participate in a couple of late-night installations of one of your designs. That will
enable you to get a feel for the whole process. Indoor planning is much more than ‘just’
desktop work on the PC.
An essential part of the learning process for the radio planner is also to gain experience
from the indoor solutions and installations that are live with real trafﬁc. Conduct the post
installation RF veriﬁcation surveys yourself; do these measurements enough times to gain
experience so that you can trust your ‘RF sense’. Real-life feedback from the designs you
have done is vital, and the launch pad for improvement.

Another valuable input for the radio planner is feedback on network performance statistics
of the indoor cells implemented. Monitor the call drop rate, quality, trafﬁc RF performance
and handovers to learn where the weak point in the design is.
9.2 Diagram Tools
All indoor radio designs need to be well documented, including diagrams. It is essential to
use an electronic tool that enables you to store and update the diagram documentation in the
future.
Always leave a set of diagrams of the DAS on-site, preferably with all components and
their location in the building. It can be very helpful if you draw the diagram, using the ﬂoor
plans as the backdrop.
9.2.1 Simple or Advanced?
The simplest tools can take you a long way. Most diagrams and an illustration in this book were
done using Microsoft Visio (as the example in Figure 9.1). Visio is very easy to use, and you
can easily create your own stencil containing the DAS components you use. You can also
import a picture format of the ﬂoor plan you are working on, and draw components on top. This
is a very easy approach and can be useful if you do only a few DAS designs a month. If you are
designing DAS on a larger scale, it is deﬁantly worthwhile considering a more automatic tool
that can help you with the total process. Many designers are also using AutoCAD for DAS
design; this can be advantageous if you can get the ﬂoor plans in AutoCAD format.

You are welcome to contact me if you want a copy of my Visio stencil I used for this book.
If you are doing a lot of indoor designs, the optimum solution would be to get a tool similar
to the one described in Section 9.7, which is what I use on a daily basis.
9.3 Radio Survey Tools
In some cases it is advisable to perform an RF survey in the building, to verify the antenna
locations and the model you are using for simulation of the coverage in the building (refer to
Section 5.2.5).
9.3.1 Use Only Calibrated Equipment
You will need a calibrated transmitter, preferably battery operated, and a pole or tripod that
enables you to place the survey transmit antenna at the same location as the planned antenna.
The transmitter needs to be able to have adjustable output power so you can simulate the
same power as the ﬁnal antenna.
Log the Measurement Result
You will also need calibrated measurement tools that are able to log the measurement, and
preferably save the data on a PC. The best system enables you to place the measurement on a
ﬂoor plan that is imported to the system (see Section 5.2.6). If you are using, or plan to use, a
design program that can do indoor modeling and RF prediction, it is important to chose a
radio survey tool that can export the measurement data to that tool, and thereby measure-
ments from the actual building can be used to ﬁne tune or calibrate the prediction model.
Needless to say, a radio planner never leaves home without a ‘test mobile’ that is able to
display, sometimes even log, the basic radio levels and parameters.
9.4 The Simple Tools and Tips
I am a big fan of simple, straightforward tools. In radio planning, as in so many other cases,
some of the best tool and tips are often the simplest ones.
9.4.1 Use a Digital Camera
A digital camera is a must for the radio survey, but also for installation documentation. It is
recommended to document all antenna and equipment locations with digital pictures. Name
the ﬁles accordingly, so the picture of the proposed installation location of antenna ‘A1’ is
saved as ‘A-1.jpeg’, etc. It is also useful to use a laser pointer to pinpoint the exact antenna
location when recording the picture; then there will be no debate with the installer as to
where the agreed antenna location is.
9.4.2 Use the World Wide Web
Prior to the survey it can be useful to visit the homepage of the company who owns the
building where you are implementing the DAS. Often you can ﬁnd site plans, photos and
other useful information that can help you prepare the draft design concept.

9.4.3 Trafﬁc Calculations
Obviously the Erlang table is one of the main tools when calculating voice capacity
(see Section 6), and you will ﬁnd a copy in the Appendix. Excel is a useful tool for the basic
trafﬁc calculations. It is very easy to produce a dedicated calculator for a speciﬁc need. The
example in Table 9.1 is a typical easily made tool for calculating the trafﬁc proﬁle of an indoor
cell, by adding the various users.
9.5 Tools for Link Budget Calculations
Any science pocket calculator will do ﬁne, but it is preferable to us a spreadsheet type of link
budget calculator, such as the example in Table 9.3 and 9.4. Most of my tools are done using
standard Excel for windows. Dedicated tools for link budget calculations are available, but
the ﬂexibility of a standard Excel spreadsheet makes it very easy to upgrade and maintain.
You can easily integrate the results of other calculations, such as cascaded noise (as shown in
Table 9.2) or power per carrier, into your link budget tool if it is all based on Excel.

9.6 Tools for Indoor Predictions
It is true that once you have done 20 or 30 indoor design, radio surveys and post
installation measurements, you will have a really good feeling, and even a sixth ‘RF
sense’. It is important to recognize and trust that feeling and experience, but always do a
link budget, and do use a link calculation, at least in the expected worst case areas of the
building.
If you only use your experience, you might make expensive mistakes, or expensive
overdesigns of the DAS solutions. If you want to utilize your experience, the best way is to
ﬁrst plot the antennas on the ﬂoor plan, then re-check with link budget and propagation
simulations, maybe even RF survey measurement with a test transmitter in the building, to
conﬁrm you are right. This will make your ‘gut feeling’ even better.
9.6.1 Spreadsheets Can Do Most of the Job
Like the link budget calculator, you can use a standard Excel spreadsheet to predict the
coverage in the building. This approach is limited to calculating a speciﬁc level or distance
in a speciﬁc area or place in the building. Therefore you will simulate the worst case in the
building, and also several location samples that represent the building.

9.6.2 The More Advanced RF Prediction Models
Some tools are able to import ﬂoor plans and to deﬁne the loss of the individual wall
and ﬂoor separations. The most advanced of these prediction tools can even calculate
‘ray-tracing’, estimating the signals being reﬂected throughout the building in three
dimensions.
It is very useful to use these types of tools, where you also can include the nearby macro
sites in your simulation. You can produce C/I plots or best server plots and save a lot of
investment, while keeping the planning mistakes to a minimum.
Any tool will only be good if you use it correctly; no tool is better than the quality of the
input you provide. Performing an accurate RF simulation of a building can be time-
consuming; you need all the details of penetration loss through walls and ﬂoor separations,
reﬂectivity of the surfaces, etc. It is evident that these tools cannot be 100% accurate, but
they allow you to simulate the environment and to experiment by moving antennas around,
thereby getting a good feeling on how and where to place the antennas. If in doubt, always
do a veriﬁcation survey with a test transmitter and receiver.

9.7 The Advanced Toolkit (RF-vu from iBwave.com)
There are many types of tools for the various processes with regards to indoor radio
planning. In many cases you end up with separate tools for each task: one tool for drawing
the diagram, one tool for the link budget, one tool for calculating the losses and powers at
the antennas, one tool for inter-modulation calculations, one tool to produce equipment
lists, etc. It can be challenging to handle all the different input and outputs of data from
these tools so that you are sure that each tool is updated with accurate project data.
However there is one tool that combines all the aspects of the indoor design process into
one (the tool I use on a daily basis). This is not a sales pitch for that speciﬁc tool, but I am
sure you will ﬁnd the software very useful and cost-saving if you do indoor radio planning
on a frequent base.
9.7.1 Save Time, Keep Costs and Mistakes to a Minimum
This tool is not only easy to use, but it saves a lot of planning costs, and keeps mistakes to a
minimum, because all data is linked, so if you update a component on the diagram, the ﬂoor
plan, simulation and equipment lists are updated simultaneously.

calculates cable distance, losses and installation costs
Tools for Indoor Radio Planning
291

9.7.2 Import Floor Plans
You can easily import any standard type of ﬂoor plan, e.g. *.gif, *.jpeg, *.pdf, and even
AutoCAD. When you have imported the ﬂoor plan, you scale it to match the actual size of
the building (as shown in Figure 9.2). All ﬂoor plan can be aligned together in order to have
a perfect three-dimensional modeling of the building. The cable lengths will then be
automatically measured horizontally and vertically based on the ﬂoor plan scales.
9.7.3 Diagram and Floor Plan
When you place components such as antenna, coupler, ampliﬁer, cable and others on the
ﬂoor plan, the schematic diagram is automatically drawn for the user, so the diagram will
always be accurate and match the ﬂoor plan, and vice versa.
In Figure 9.3 you can see a screen shot of a simple ﬂoor plan with two antennas. The
software automatically calculates the actual cable distance due to the scaled ﬂoor plan. The
cable distance and the predicted cell border are updated in real time when moving the
components on the ﬂoor plan.
You can choose what type of supplementary information you would like the diagram to
present; in the example in Figure 9.3 it is the power level in dBm at the input and output of
each component.
9.7.4 Schematic Diagram
The schematic diagram is where the user can see all the components connected together and
analyze the RF power at each single connector (as shown in Figure 9.3). Each component is
drawn for better identiﬁcation but also contains all its technical speciﬁcations in order for
the tool to simulate its action as it would perform in real life. Most of the new in-building
projects are now multiband and multitechnology so people are using the same infrastruc-
ture, as a big RF pipeline, to carry multiple types of signals at different frequencies. The
schematic view gives the ability to the user to analyze the interaction of all the signals going
through a component and perform the speciﬁc RF calculations based on the particularity of
Figure 9.3

component are calculated

the technology. The tool performs many downlink and uplink calculations, which is useful
to increase speed and accuracy of the design. Large quantities of projects are made using
passive DAS, which is hard to balance without a tool, especially when there are many
components. The uplink portion is even worse since the cascaded noise ﬁgure of the system
is crucial but very hard to calculate manually. When modiﬁcations are required due to a site
visit or other factors, the tool will save a lot of time by re-doing all the calculations in a
second. The link budget, noise calculations, power and inter-modulation calculations are
also done within the tool, and it supports the various mobile and communication protocols
from around the world.
9.7.5 Error Detection
The software has detailed warnings on many different topics and will prevent the user from
making errors on the projects. The software will check for errors such as connecting two
outputs together, incorrect connectors (gender and type), composite RF power going through
a component, overdriving an ampliﬁer, and many more.
9.7.6 Component Database
The tool has a large database of components from the different manufacturers, so the design
calculation and documentation will show and use the real data, updated online from the
manufacturer. This also includes the antenna radiation diagram, so you can make accurate
predictions, using the actual antenna you plan to implement. It is easy to create your own
components if needed, or change the existing component data.
9.7.7 Equipment List and Project Cost Report
You can deﬁne the cost per component, the installation cost per component or meter of
cable, and with the push of a button you will get a complete shopping list and project cost.
This enables the radio planner to fairly accurately estimate the project cost and the business
case.
9.7.8 RF and Installation Report
Many other reports are available to help the user to quickly analyze and optimize the project.
Other reports let the user look at the link budget of each antenna at each band, analyze the
average output power per antenna to better balance its system and give a detailed cable
routing report to installers in order to speed up the installation process.
9.7.9 Multisystem or Multioperator
The software is capable of planning dual band or multioperator systems, and will show the
different bands with different color coding.

9.7.10 Importing an RF Survey
You can import a results ﬁle from the RF survey measurement (as shown in Figure 9.4), and
compare data with the prediction model. It is very easy to ﬁnd installation problems when
comparing the post installation survey with the prediction.
9.7.11 Site Documentation
It is possible to include site documentation (as shown in Figure 9.5), as build pictures and
mock-ups in order to help the installers avoid mistakes and help the building owner to
understand the installation.
9.7.12 RF Propagation
You can select various prediction models and modes (as shown in Figures 9.6 and 9.7), from
COST231 to 3D Dominant Path, which is an optimized ray tracing model. The database

characteristics and the environment. Three-dimensional prediction can be performed and
analyzed for all the bands at the same time and displayed in different formats, such as Best
Server, Link Loss or Signal Strength. The threshold can also be deﬁned by the technology to
identify which band will meet the technology requirement and which one will need to be
improved.

The best thing about the tool is that all the data is integrated into the same platform, so it is
easy to update the project. The documentation, the calculations, reports, diagrams, ﬂoor
plans and all the project info is contain in one ﬁle and can easily be shared across the in-
building value chain. Replacing single or multiple components is a matter of a few clicks
with the mouse as all data is linked. This can save a lot of project time and limit the number
of mistakes.

Optimizing the Radio Resource
Management Parameters on
Node B When Interfacing to an
Active DAS, BDA, LNA or TMA
When connecting any external uplink or downlink ampliﬁers to node B, you will offset the
UL and DL. It will be necessary to evaluate and adjust the basic power control, system-info,
noise and timing parameters in the BSS system in order to optimize the performance of an
indoor active DAS system. If the parameters in the radio access network (RAN) (node B and
RNC) are not tuned to cope with the offsets in DL power, noise load and timing offset, there
will be a serious impact on the performance of the indoor system.
10.1 Introduction
UMTS is an advanced system. As it is noise- and power-limited, enhancement of the UL and
DL performance can be obtained by the use of UL and DL remote ampliﬁers to overcome
the passive losses from the base station (node B) to the antenna. This is the basic principle of
an active DAS, which functions as distributed ampliﬁers in the system, offsetting the DL
power and to some extend loading the base station with noise power on the uplink.
10.1.1 UMTS Radio Performance is All About Noise and Power Control
It is a fact that, in order to have optimum performance on a UMTS system, we need to
insure:
 Strict power control: all mobiles use the same UL frequency, so all mobiles have to be
controlled so that the received signal strength from them on the UL of the node B is kept at

the same receive level (see Section 2.4.5). The offset of the node B DL power caused by a
BDA, TMA or active DAS has to be considered in the node B setting.
 Noise load is controlled in the system: node B will measure the total UL noise (trafﬁc)
continuously, and use that measurement for admission control, to make sure that the
overall system noise increase on the UL is kept below the desired threshold. The added UL
noise from the active DAS, BDA or remote LNA has to be considered in the node B
evaluation of noise/trafﬁc increase.
 Delay of the DAS (synchronization window): delay in the external ampliﬁer system has to
be incorporated in the timing and cell size.
10.1.2 UMTS RF Parameter Reference is Different from GSM
In GSM the reference for the radio parameters is the antenna connectors on top of the base
station rack. However, for UMTS it was foreseen that external equipment between the base
station and the antenna would offset the downlink power, as well as the uplink noise load.
The 3GPP-UMTS speciﬁcation foresees that external equipment will be connected to the
node B antenna connector (3GPP no’s 25.215 and 25.104). This equipment will typically be
an LNA (to enhance the uplink) or TMA (tower-mounted ampliﬁer, to enhance the
downlink).
10.1.3 Adjust the Parameters
The 3GPP speciﬁcation takes the performance of this external equipment (see Figure 10.1)
into account in the parameter set, by having the BS antenna as the reference. This is different
from the GSM speciﬁcation where the antenna connector of the base station is the reference.
This change of reference for the node B parameter is motivated by the fact that UMTS is a
power- and noise-limited system, so it is crucial that the performance of any external
equipment is taken into account the radio resource management parameter evaluations.

10.1.4 How to Adjust this in the RAN
Typically, there will be some offset adjustments to consider in the parameter set of the speciﬁc
RAN vendor. The actual parameter name varies from vendor to vendor, but the principle is the
same. In order for node B to be 3GPP-compliant, these offsets must be tunable, in order to
offset the reference for the radio resource management in the BSS.
In the typical RAN you use the ‘external TMA/LNA’ function; here you deﬁne the DL
power at the antenna, the noise ﬁgure and gain on the uplink, and then the RAN tunes all the
control parameters accordingly.
10.1.5 Switch Off the LNA in Node B when Using Active DAS
When connecting an active DAS to node B, it is pretty much like connecting a TMA and a
LNA to node B. Some vendors to have an easy way of taking the offset off the DL power and
UL noise increase into account, by setting node B into ‘external TMA’ and ‘external LNA’
mode. Then you just deﬁne the NF and DL power of the DAS, and everything is taken into
account. Note that the pure active system has a UL ampliﬁer close to the antenna, and by
using the UL gain in the pure active system, and switching off the internal LNA in node B,
the UL performance increases because to the basics of cascaded noise; it is always best to
have the gain closest to the source (the antenna).
10.2 Impact of DL Power Offset
When node B is connected to an active DAS, e.g. a 40 dBm, the CPICH power will typically
be 30 dBm (10%/10 dB). With one UMTS carrier on the active system, the maximum
power will be, for example, 15 dBm, so the CPICH power of the remote access unit will be
6–10 dB lower. However the system information transmitted by node B will (if left
unchanged) still inform the mobiles that the transmitted CPICH power is 30 dBm from
node B. These 25 dB in offset between the system information and the actual CPICH power
will cause problems during access burst, if left unchanged.
10.2.1 Access Burst
When a mobile is in idle mode (open loop power control), it will monitor and decode the
system information broadcast by node B (transmitted CPICH power). In order to enable the
mobile to access the cell with the correct initial access burst level (not to overshoot the UL),
node B broadcasts the CPICH Tx Power as a reference to the mobile. This CPICH Tx power
level is used by the mobile to calculate the link loss. Therefore, the mobiles are able to start
the initial access sequence with a power level that will insure that this access burst does not
overpower all the other trafﬁc on the UL (as shown in Figure 10.2).
Example
A mobile is decoding a cell where the BS reports that the CPICH is transmitted at þ33 dBm;
the mobile receives the CPICH signal at 85 dBm. Thus the mobile will calculate the link
Optimizing the Radio Resource Management Parameters on Node B
299

loss to be:
link loss ¼ CPICH received  CPICH transmitted
link loss ¼ 85 dBm  33 dBm ¼ 118 dB
Using this 118 dB of link loss, the mobile can estimate the initial power needed to overcome
the link loss, for the ﬁrst access burst.
10.2.2 Power Offset Between Node B and the Active DAS
The active DAS has a remote unit with an integrated DL power ampliﬁer. The actual DL
power will therefore depend on the composite power resource of that speciﬁc DL ampliﬁer.
In a typical active DAS a RU would typically transmit the CPICH at þ5 dBm (one UMTS
carrier at full power is þ15 dBm, and with the CPICH set to 10 dB ¼ 5 dBm CPICH).
If the signal source to the active system is a þ43 dBm macro node B, the CPICH is
þ33 dBm, and the system information broadcasts þ33 dBm as the CPICH reference power
(not the actual þ5 dBm radiated from the RU), there is an obvious problem: using the same
example as above, where the mobile is receiving the CPICH at 85 dBm, the mobile will
still decode the information broadcast by node B, which the CPICH is transmitted at
þ33 dBm by the active DAS. The mobile will once again calculate the link loss to be

Indoor Radio Planning

118 dBm:
link loss ¼ 85 dBm  33 dBm ¼ 118 dB
The mobile will then calculate the needed UL power to overcome the 118 dB link loss when
accessing node B. However, in reality the CPICH is not transmitted at þ33 dBm, but at
þ5 dBm due to the power ampliﬁer (PA) in the RU, so the real link loss is actually:
link loss ¼ 85 dBm  5 dBm ¼ 90 dB
The result is that the mobile will use to high power in the access bursts. This erroneous
CPICH power information will cause the mobile to access the cell with a level 28 dB too
high (118–90 dB).
This overshoot on the UL will cause:
 Excessive noise increase on the serving cell and potentially in the neighboring cells.
 Degraded service for other mobiles in the serving cell and potentially in the neighboring
cell.
 Potential for dropped calls in serving cell and neighboring cell.
 UL blocking of the RU (trigging the UL automatic level control).
10.2.3 Solution
Thanks to 3GPP, the solution is easy. The broadcast information on the CPICH power has to
be changed to the actual level transmitted level by the RU. It is important to note that the
CPICH level itself (10 dB) is not changed, but only the information on the absolute
transmitted level is adjusted to the CPICH level of the RU.
10.2.4 Impact on the UL of Node B
The noise load of the UL is a limiting factor on the UL performance, so it is crucial for
UMTS to control the noise increase in the cells.
10.2.5 Admission Control
Node B will constantly measure the overall noise power on the UL to evaluate the UL noise
increase in the cell. The total noise power on the UL of the node B will be a result of:
noisetotal ¼ owntrafﬁc noise þ othercells’ noise þ node Bnoise power
So in addition to the noise generated by the trafﬁc in the cell, there will be a contribution of
noise from users in other cells and ﬁnally the NF of the node B hardware. Using this noise
measurement and adding the hardware noise of node B makes it possible to evaluate if new
admitted trafﬁc will cause a noise increase that exceeds the predeﬁned limit for the
maximum UL noise increase in the cell (as shown in Figure 10.3).

10.3 Impact of Noise Power
An active DAS consists of ampliﬁers and, depending of the actual conﬁguration, will have a
given noise ﬁgure that adds to the noise on the UL of node B.
10.3.1 The UL Noise Increase on Node B
The active DAS needs to be conﬁgured so that the active DAS and UL attenuators are set at
optimum values, minimizing the resulting noise increase on node B – without degrading the
performance of the UL. However there will be a noise increase on the UL of node B.
Therefore, it is crucial to tune the admission control parameter, with regards to the added
noise power on the UL of the node B
Solution
Tune the: node Bnoise power
This includes the noise increase caused by the active DAS (minimized by a correct UL
attenuator). If this is not tuned, the result will be that the admission control assumes too high
a UL trafﬁc (noise level), limiting the UL capacity. In extreme cases (if no UL attenuator is
used), this results in no call set-up in the cell.
10.4 Delay of the Active DAS
Connecting external equipment between node B and the antenna will cause an offset of the
timing in the cell. In reality this delay will result in an increase in cell size (timing window).

Indoor Radio Planning

An active DAS connected directly to the node B will typical add 2–3 km to the cell size. This
delay or offset depends on the delay in the active DAS ampliﬁers, but also on the length of
ﬁbers and CAT5 cables. The longer the ﬁber and cable runs, the longer the delay will be, in
some cases exceeding 15–20 km offset of the cell size. Some operators will set a given cell
size according to the environment the cell is serving.
Typically, a node B serving an indoor solution would be set to a cell size of 2 km, so that
node B does not pick up any trafﬁc distant to the cell. Therefore if one does not consider the
delay on an active indoor DAS, and sets the cell size to 2 km, the cell might not be able to set
up calls on the indoor system, due to the delay of the DAS.
10.4.1 Solution
Set the cell size to cope with the offset caused by the delay in the active DAS.
10.5 Impact of External Noise Power
It is crucial to select the correct value for the UL attenuator between node B and the active
system. The purpose of this attenuator is to minimize the UL noise power. However
the correct value of the attenuator needs to be selected in order to have the minimum noise
impact and not affect the UL (SNR) performance.
The ideal attenuator will be the difference between the noise power from the DAS and the
KTB. The ‘noise power normograph’ in Figure 10.4 will help you to calculate the noise
power in any given bandwidth, and thereby enable you to select the optimum UL attenuator.
It is the standard noise calculations from Chapter 7, although the noise normograph might be
easier to use. This is how to use the normograph.
 The left graph – this is the reference point for the noise ﬁgure from the DAS plus the UL
gain set in the system, so if your NF from the system is 12 dB, and you use 3 dB UL gain,
you should select 15 dB as the reference.
 The right graph – this is the reference point for the RF bandwidth for the noise calculation,
so for GSM you select 200 kHz for UMTS 3.84Mc (Figure 10.4).
10.5.1 To Calculate the Noise Power
You select the RF bandwidth and the NF and draw a line between the two points; then the
noise power is given by the point where this line crosses the center graph. Too calculate the
noise power of a UMTS node B with an NF of 4 dB, the two reference points are the UMTS
bandwidth (3.84Mc) on the right graph and the NF (4 dB) on the left graph. The line
connecting these two points crosses the noise power graph at 104 dBm [4 dB NF þ
ð108 dBmÞ], so this is the noise power loading the Rx port of node B, and this new
RAN admission reference for zero trafﬁc on node B.
10.5.2 To Calculate the UL Attenuator
The example shows a UMTS (3.84Mc) system, connected to an active DAS with 20 dB NF.
As we can see, the noise power is 89 dBm, loading the input of the node B, if we do not use
Optimizing the Radio Resource Management Parameters on Node B
303

any attenuator. The ideal attenuator is calculated as the difference between this noise power
and the KTB (the KTB is the noise power at 0 dB NF). In this example the ideal attenuator is
19 dB, so in practice you would select a 20 dB attenuator and adjust the UL gain of the DAS
to þ1 dB. Note that selecting a higher attenuator will degrade the UL dynamic range and
sensitivity of the node B. However, there will still be a slight impact of the noise power from
the DAS when node B has a noise power of 106 dBm and the DAS with attenuator has
108 dBm of noise power, and we will need to sum up these two noise powers by adding the
powers in Watts.
First we convert the dBm to W:
P ðmwÞ ¼ 10dBm=10
The idle noise power on the base station ¼ 106 dBm ¼ 1:58  1011 mW. The noise
power from DAS ¼ 108 dBm ¼ 2:51  1011 mW. Now we add the two noise powers:
noise power ¼ P1 þ P2 ¼ 1:58  1011 mW þ 2:51  1011 mW ¼ 4:09  1011 mW
Then we convert back to dBm:
P ðdBmÞ ¼ 10 logðmWÞ
P ðdBmÞ ¼ 10 logð4:09  1011Þ ¼ 103:88 dBm

10.5.3 Affect on Admission Control
The resulting noise power load would be about 104 dBm, and the admission control should
offset to take this into account. It would be a noise load increase of þ2 dB on the UL of the
base station, corresponding to a UL load of 37%. If the base station admission control was
set to a maximum UL load of 50% (3 dB noise increase), this ‘phantom load’ would have the
effect that the base station would only be able to admit 13% of trafﬁc load (50% max UL
load 37% phantom load). If no UL attenuator was used, the noise power injected to the
base station would saturate admission control with phantom noise, and no trafﬁc would be
admitted to the cell.
