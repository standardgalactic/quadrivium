Trigonometry Workbook For Dummies 

Introduction
W
hat in the world is trigonometry? Well, for starters, trigonometry is in the world, on
the world, and above the world — at least its uses are. Trigonometry started out as 
a practical way of finding out how far things are from one another when you can’t measure
them. Ancient mathematicians came up with a measure called an angle, and the rest is 
history.
So, what’s my angle in this endeavor? (Pardon the pun.) I wanted to write this book because
trigonometry just hasn’t gotten enough attention lately. You can’t do much navigating with-
out trigonometry. You can’t build bridges or skyscrapers without trigonometry. Why has it
been neglected as of late? It hasn’t been ignored as much as it just hasn’t been the center of
attention. And that’s a shame.
Trigonometry is about angles, sure. You can’t do anything without knowing what the 
different angle measures do to the different trig functions. But trigonometry is also about
relationships — just like some of these new reality television shows. Did I get your attention?
These relationships are nearly as exciting as those on TV where they decide who gets to stay
and who gets to leave. The sine gets to stay and the cosecant has to leave when you know
the identities and rules and apply them correctly. Trigonometry allows you to do some
pretty neat things with equations and mathematical statements. It’s got the power.
Another neat thing about trigonometry is the way it uses algebra. In fact, algebra is a huge
part of trigonometry. Thinking back to my school days, I think I learned more about the
finesse of algebra when doing those trig identities than I did in my algebra classes. It all fits
together so nicely.
Whatever your plans are for trigonometry, you’ll find the rules, the hints, the practice, and
the support in this book. Have at it.
About This Book
This book is intended to cement your understanding — to give you the confidence that you
do, indeed, know about a particular aspect of trigonometry. In each section, you’ll find brief
explanations of the concept. If that isn’t enough, refer to your copy of Trigonometry For
Dummies, your textbook, or some other trig resource. With the examples I give, you’ll proba-
bly be ready to try out the problems for yourself and move on from there. The exercises are
carefully selected to incorporate the different possibilities that come with each topic — the
effect of different kinds of angles or factoring or trig functions.
Conventions Used in This Book
Reading any book involving mathematics can have an added challenge if you aren’t familiar
with the conventions being used. The following conventions are used throughout the text to
make things consistent and easy to understand:

 New terms appear in italic and are closely followed by an easy-to-understand 
definition.
 Bold is used to highlight the action parts of numbered steps. Bold is also used on the
answers to the example and practice problems to make them easily 
identifiable.
 Numbers are either written out as words or given in their numerical form — whichever
seems to fit at the moment and cause the least amount of confusion.
 The variables (things that stand for some number or numbers — usually unknown at
first) are usually represented by letters at the end of the alphabet such as x, y, and z.
The constants (numbers that never change) are usually represented by letters at the
beginning of the alphabet such as a, b, or c, and also by two big favorites, k or π. In any
case, the variables and constants are italicized for your benefit.
 Angle measures are indicated with the word degrees or the symbol for a degree, °, or
the word radians. The radian measures are usually given as numbers or multiples of π.
If the angle measure is unknown, I use the variable x or, sometimes, the Greek letter Θ.
 I use the traditional symbols for the mathematical operations: addition, + ; subtraction, – ;
multiplication, × or sometimes just a dot between values; and division, ÷ or sometimes
a slash, / .
Foolish Assumptions
We all make foolish assumptions at times, and here are mine concerning you:
 You have a basic knowledge of algebra and can solve simple linear and quadratic equa-
tions. If this isn’t true, you may want to brush up a bit with Algebra For Dummies or a
textbook.
 You aren’t afraid of fractions. FOF (fear of fractions) is a debilitating but completely
curable malady. You just need to understand how they work — and don’t work — and
not let them throw you.
 You have a scientific calculator (one that does powers and roots) available so you can
approximate the values of radical expressions and do computations that are too big or
small for paper and pencil.
 You want to improve your skills in trigonometry, practice up on those topics that
you’re a little rusty at, or impress your son/daughter/boyfriend/girlfriend/boss/
soul mate with your knowledge and skill in trigonometry.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into parts. Trigonometry divides up nicely into these groupings or
parts with similar topics falling together. You can identify the part that you want to go to and
cover as much if not all of the section before moving on.
Part I: Trying Out Trig: Starting at the Beginning
The study of trigonometry starts with angles and their measures. This is what makes
trigonometry so different from other mathematical topics — you get to see what angle
2
Trigonometry Workbook For Dummies 

measures can do. For starters, I describe, pull apart, and inspect angles in triangles and 
circles. You get intimate with the circle and some of its features; think of it as becoming
well-rounded. (Sorry, I just couldn’t resist.)
One of the best things about trigonometry is how visual its topics are. You get to look at pic-
tures of angles, triangles, circles, and sketches depicting practical applications. One of the
visuals is the coordinate plane. You plot points, compute distances and slopes, determine
midpoints, and write equations that represent circles. This is preparation for determining the
values of the trig functions in terms of angles that are all over the place — angles that have
positive or negative, very small or very large, degree or radian measures.
And, saving the best for last, I cover the right triangles. These triangles start you out in terms
of the trig functions and are very user-friendly when doing practical applications.
Part II: Trigonometric Functions
The trig functions are unique. These six basic functions take a simple little angle measure,
chew on it a bit, and spit out a number. How do they do that? That’s what you find out in the
chapters in this part. Each function has its own particular definition and inner workings. Each
function has special things about it in terms of what angles it can accept and what numerical
values it produces. You start with the right triangle to formulate these functions, and then you
branch out into all the angles that can be formed going ’round and ’round the circle.
Part III: Trigonometric Identities and Equations
The trigonometric identities are those special equivalences that the six trig functions are
involved with. These identities allow you to change from one function to another for your
convenience, or just because you want to. You’ll find out what the identities are and what to
do with them. Sometimes they help make a complex expression much simpler. Sometimes
they make an equation more manageable — and solvable. (Believe it or not, some people
actually like to solve trig identities just for the pure pleasure of conquering the algebraic and
trigonometric challenge they afford.)
In this part, I introduce you to the inverse trig functions. They undo what the original trig func-
tion did. These inverse functions are very helpful when solving trig equations — equations
that use algebra to find out which angles make the statement true.
And, last but not least, you’ll find the Law of Sines and Law of Cosines in this part. These two
laws or equations describe some relationships between the angles and sides of a triangle —
and then use these properties to find a missing angle measure or missing side of the triangle.
They’re most handy when you can’t quite fit a right triangle into the situation.
Part IV: Graphing the Trigonometric Functions
The trig functions are all recognizable by their graphs — or, they will be by the time you
finish with this part. The characteristics of the functions — in terms of what angle measures
they accept and what values they spew out — are depicted graphically. Pictures are very
helpful when you’re trying to convince someone else or yourself what’s going on.
The graphs of the trig functions are transformed in all the ways possible — shoved around
the coordinate system, stretched out, squashed, and flipped. I describe all these possibilities
3
Introduction

with symbols and algebra and with the actual graph. Even if you’re graphing functions with
a graphing calculator, you really need to know what’s going on so you can either decipher
what’s on your calculator screen or tell if what you have is right or wrong.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This is one of my favorite parts of this book. Here I was able to introduce some information
that just didn’t fit in the other parts — stuff I wanted to show you and couldn’t have other-
wise. You’ll find some identities that fit special situations and all have a connection with the
minus sign. You’ll find everything you’ve always wanted to know about a circle but were
afraid to ask. And, finally, I explore and lay bare for all to see the relationships between the
angles and sides of a triangle.
Icons Used in This Book
To make this book easier to read and simpler to use, I include some icons that can help you
find and fathom key ideas and information.
You’ll find one or more examples with each section in this book. These are designed to cover
the techniques and properties of the topic at hand. They get you started on doing the prac-
tice problems that follow. The solutions at the end of each chapter provide even more detail
on how to solve those problems.
This icon appears when I’m thinking, “Oh, it would help if I could mention that. . . .” These

Where to Go from Here
Where do you start? You can start anywhere you want. As with all For Dummies books, the
design is with you in mind. You won’t spoil the ending by doing those exercises, first. You can
open to a random page or, more likely, look in the table of contents or index for that topic
that’s been bugging you. You don’t have to start at the beginning and slog your way through.
All through the book, I reference preceding and later chapters that either offer more explana-
tion or a place for further discovery.
There’s a great companion book to this workbook called, just by coincidence, Trigonometry
For Dummies. It has more detail on the topics in this workbook, if you want to delve further

Here you find all you need to know about angles, trian-

back again. All the basics are here for you to start with,

ngles are what trigonometry is all about. This is where it all started, way back when.
Early astronomers needed a measure to tell something meaningful about the sun and
moon and stars and their relationship between man standing on the earth or how they were
positioned in relation to one another. Angles are the input values for the trig functions.
This chapter gives you background on how angles are measured, how they are named, and
how they relate to one another in two familiar figures, including the triangle and circle. A lot
of this material is terminology. The words describe things very specific, but this is a good
thing, because they’re consistent in trigonometry and other mathematics.
Getting Angles Labeled by Size
An angle is formed where two rays (straight objects with an endpoint that go on forever in
one direction) have a common endpoint. This endpoint is called the vertex. An angle can also
be formed when two segments or lines intersect. But, technically, even if it’s formed by two
segments, those two segments can be extended into rays to describe the angle. Angle meas-
ure is sort of how far apart the two sides are. The measurement system is unique to these
shapes.
Angles can be classified by their size. The measures given here are all in terms of degrees.
Radian measures (measures of angles that use multiples of π and relationships to the circum-
ference) are covered in Chapter 4, so you can refer to that chapter when needed.
 Acute angle: An angle measuring less than 90 degrees.
 Right angle: An angle measuring exactly 90 degrees; the two sides are perpendicular.
 Obtuse angle: An angle measuring greater than 90 degrees and less than 180 degrees
 Straight angle: An angle measuring exactly 180 degrees.
Q.
Is an angle measuring 47 degrees acute,
right, obtuse, or straight?
A.
An angle measuring 47 degrees is acute.
Q.
Is an angle measuring 163 degrees acute,
right, obtuse, or straight?
A.
An angle measuring 163 degrees is obtuse.

Naming Angles Where Lines Intersect
When two lines cross one another, four angles are formed, and there’s something spe-
cial about the pairs of angles that can be identified there. Look at Figure 1-1. The two
lines have intersected, and I’ve named the angles by putting Greek letters inside them
to identify the angles.
The angles that are opposite one another, when two lines intersect, are called vertical
angles. The special thing they have in common, besides the lines they share, is that
their measures are the same, too. There are two pairs of vertical angles in Figure 1-1.
Angles β and ω are vertical. So are angles λ and θ.
The other special angles that are formed are pairs of supplementary angles. Two angles
are supplementary when their sum is 180 degrees. The supplementary angles in Figure
1-1 are those that lie along the same straight line with a shared ray between them. The
pairs of supplementary angles are: λ and ω, ω and θ, θ and β, and β and λ.

Writing Angle Names Correctly
An angle can be identified in several different ways:
 Use the letter labeling the point that’s the vertex of the angle. Points are labeled
with capital letters.
 Use three letters that label points — one on one ray of the angle, then the vertex,
and the last on the other ray.
 Use a letter or number in the inside of the angle. Usually, the letters used are
Greek or lowercase.

Finding Missing Angle Measures in Triangles
Triangles are probably one of the most familiar forms in geometry and trigonometry.
They’re studied and restudied and gone over for the minutest of details. One thing that
stands out, is always true, and is often used, is the fact that the sum of the measures 
of the angles of any triangle is 180 degrees. It’s always that sum — never more, never
less. This is a good thing. It allows you to find missing measures — when they go 
missing — for angles in a triangle.
Q.
If the measures of two of the angles of a
triangle are 16 degrees and 47 degrees,
what is the measure of the third angle?
A.
To solve this, add 16 + 47 = 63. Then sub-
tract 180 – 63 = 117 degrees.
Q.
An equilateral triangle has three equal
sides and three equal angles. If you
draw a segment from the vertex of an
equilateral triangle perpendicular to
the opposite side, then what are the
measures of the angles in the two new 
triangles formed? Look at the figure to
help you visualize this.
A.
Because the triangle is equilateral, the
angles must each be 60 degrees, because 
3 × 60 = 180. That means that angles A
and B are each 60 degrees. If the segment
CD is perpendicular to the bottom of the
triangle, AB, then angle ADC and angle
BDC must each measure 90 degrees.
What about the two top angles? Because
angle A is 60 degrees and angle ADC is
90 degrees, and because 60 + 90 = 150,
that leaves 180 – 150 = 30 degrees for
angle ACD. The same goes for angle BCD.

Determining Angle Measures along 
Lines and outside Triangles
Angles can be all over the place and arbitrary, or they can behave and be predictable.
Two of the situations in the predictable category are those where a transversal cuts
through two parallel lines (a transversal is another line cutting through both lines), and
where a side of a triangle is extended to form an exterior angle.
When a transversal cuts through two parallel lines, the acute angles formed are all
equal and the obtuse angles formed are all equal (unless the transversal is perpendicu-
lar to the line — in that case, they’re all right angles). In Figure 1-2, on the left, you can
see how creating acute and obtuse angles comes about. Also, the acute and obtuse
angles are supplementary to one another.
An exterior angle of a triangle is an angle that’s formed when one side of the triangle is
extended. The exterior angle is supplementary to the interior angle it’s adjacent to.
Also, the exterior angle’s measure is equal to the sum of the two nonadjacent interior
angles.

Q.
In Figure 1-2, on the right, what are the
measures of angles x and y?
A.
The angle x is supplementary to an angle
of 150 degrees, so its measure is 180 – 150 =
30 degrees. The measure of angle y plus the
65-degree angle must equal 150 degrees
(the exterior angle’s measure). Subtract
150 – 65 = 85. So angle y is 85 degrees. To
check this, add up the measures of the
interior angles: 65 + 85 + 30 = 180. This is
the sum of the measures of the angles of
any triangle.

Dealing with Circle Measurements
A circle is determined by its center and its radius. The radius is the distance, shown by
a segment, from the center of the circle to any point on the circle. The diameter of a
circle is a segment drawn through the center, which has its endpoints on the circle.
A diameter is the longest segment that can be drawn within a circle.
The measure of the diameter of a circle is equal to twice that of the radius. The diame-
ter and radius are used when determining the circumference (the distance around the
outside of a circle) and the area of a circle.

Solve It

Solve It
60°
Tuning In with the Right Chord
A chord is a segment that’s drawn from one point on a circle to another point on the
same circle. The longest chord of a circle is its diameter. The two endpoints of a chord
divide a circle into two arcs — the major arc and the minor arc. The major arc is, of
course, the larger of the two. A circle has a total of 360 degrees, so the sum of those
two arcs must equal 360.
Q.
The chord AB, shown in the figure, divides
the circle into two arcs, one of which is
100 degrees greater than the other. What
is the measure of the major arc?
B
A
A.
Let the measure of the minor arc be x.
Then the larger arc is 100 greater than that,
or x + 100. The sum of the two is 360. Write
that as x + x + 100 = 360. This simplifies to
2x + 100 = 360. Subtract 100 from each side
to get 2x = 260. Divide by 2, and x = 130.
This is the measure of the minor arc. Add
100 to that, and the major arc measures
230 degrees.

Answers to Problems on 
Tackling Technical Trig
The following are the solutions to the practice problems presented earlier in this chapter.
a
What type of angle is shown in the figure? Right angle.
The angle shown in the figure is a right angle, because it measures exactly 90 degrees.
b
What type of angle is shown in the figure? Acute angle.
The angle shown in the figure is an acute angle, because 31 is between 0 and 90 degrees.
c
What type of angle is shown in the figure? Obtuse angle.
The angle shown in the figure is an obtuse angle, because 114 is between 90 and 180 degrees.
d
What type of angle is shown in the figure? Straight angle.
The angle shown in the figure is a straight angle, because it measures exactly 180 degrees.
e
Give the measure of the angles that are supplementary to the angle shown in the figure. 
47 degrees.
In the figure, the measure of the angles that are supplementary to the 133-degree angle is 
47 degrees, because 180 – 133 = 47.
f
Give the measure of the angle that is vertical to the angle shown in the figure. 45 degrees.
In the figure, the measure of the angle that is vertical to the 45-degree angle is also 45 degrees,
because vertical angles always have the same measure.
g
Find all the names for the angle shown in the figure. A, BAG, and GAB.
h
Find all the names for the angle that’s vertical to the angle POT in the figure. NOD
and DON.
In the figure, you can’t use the letter O to name an angle. This is a case where just using the
letter for the point at the vertex doesn’t give enough information to identify which angle you’re
talking about.
i
Triangle SIR is isosceles. An isosceles triangle has two sides that are equal; the angles opposite
those sides are also equal. If the vertex angle, I, measures 140 degrees, what do the other two
angles measure? 20 degrees each.
If the vertex angle, I, measures 140 degrees, the other two angles have to be the angles that are
equal. The reason for this is that, if the 140-degree angle were one of the pair of equal angles,
the sum of it and its pair would be 280 degrees, which is already too much for the sum of the
angles in a triangle. So, to find the measure of the two equal angles, first subtract 180 – 140 = 40.
That leaves a total of 40 degrees for the two equal angles; they’re 20 degrees each.
j
A triangle has angles that measure n degrees, n + 20 degrees, and 3n – 15 degrees. What are
their measures? 35 degrees, 55 degrees, and 90 degrees.
The angles have to add up to 180 degrees: n + (n + 20) + (3n – 15) = 180. Simplifying on the left,
5n + 5 = 180. Subtract 5 from each side to get 5n = 175. Divide each side by 5, and n = 35. And 
n + 20 = 55. Lastly, 3n – 15 = 90. Adding the three angles: 35 + 55 + 90 = 180.

k
Find the measures of the acute and obtuse angles formed when a transversal cuts through two
parallel lines if the obtuse angles are three times as large as the acute angles. 45 degrees and
135 degrees.
Let the sum of the acute and obtuse angles be 180. This is true because the angles are sup-
plementary. Let the acute angle’s measure be x. Then the obtuse angle measures 3x. Adding, 
x + 3x = 180, 4x = 180. Dividing by 4, x = 45. If the acute angles are 45 degrees, then the obtuse
angles are three times that, or 135 degrees.
l
Find the measures of the four angles shown in the figure, if one is two times the size of the small-
est angle, one is 10 degrees less than five times the smallest angle, and the last is 10 degrees
larger than the smallest angle. 20 degrees, 40 degrees, 90 degrees, and 30 degrees.
The sum of the four angles is 180 degrees — the measure of a straight angle. Let the smallest
measure be x degrees. Then the others are 2x, 5x – 10, and x + 10. Adding them, x + 2x + 5x – 
10 + x + 10 = 180. Simplifying on the left, 9x = 180. Dividing by 9, x = 20. The angles are: 20, 40, 
90, and 30 degrees.

A chord divides a circle into two arcs, one of which is 15 degrees less than 14 times the other.
What are the measures of the two arcs? 25 degrees and 335 degrees.
Start by finding the measures of the two arcs. Let one arc measure x degrees. Then the other
measures 14x – 15 degrees. Their sum is 360 degrees. So x + 14x – 15 = 360. Simplify on the left
to get 15x – 15 = 360. 15x = 375. Dividing by 15, x = 25. The minor arc is 25 degrees, and the
major arc is 14 (25) – 15 = 335 degrees.

Three chords are drawn in a circle to form a triangle, as shown in the figure. One of the chords
is drawn through the center of the circle. If the minor arc determined by the shortest chord is

angle? 180 degrees and 120 degrees.
The diameter divides the circle into two equal arcs, so they’re each 180 degrees. That leaves
180 degrees for the top half. Subtract 180 – 60, and the other arc on the top is 120 degrees.

Let x represent the measure of the arc cut by the smallest piece. Then the other two arcs are 
3x – 1 and 2x + 1. Add all three together to get x + 3x – 1 + 2x + 1 = 360. Simplifying on the left, 
6x = 360. Dividing by 6, x = 60. The other two measures are then 179 and 121. The three different
areas can be found by multiplying their fraction of the pizza by the area of the whole pizza,
which is determined by multiplying π times the square of the radius. An 18-inch pizza has a
radius of 9 inches.

raphing points and figures is an important technique in anything mathematical, and it’s
especially important in trigonometry. Not only is the coordinate plane used to describe
how figures are interacting, but it’s also used to define the six trig functions in all their glory.
The values of the trig functions are dependent upon where the inputs are in the graph. And,
of course, there are the graphs of the functions, which I cover in detail in Part IV.
The important things to look for in the graphs of the trig functions and other curves is where
the graph is and when it’s there. The signs of the coordinates bear watching. The quadrant
that the curve lies in is important. These are all covered in this chapter.
Plotting Points
The traditional setup for graphing in mathematics is the coordinate plane, which is defined
by two perpendicular lines intersecting at the center (origin) and uses the Cartesian coordi-
nates. The coordinates are the numbers representing the placement of the points. These
numbers are in ordered pairs — they’re written in parentheses, separated by a comma, and
the order they’re in matters. The points are in the form (x,y) where the first coordinate, the x,
tells you how far to the right or left the point is in terms of the origin. The second coordinate,
the y, tells you how far up or down the point is from the origin. Positive coordinates indicate
a move to the right or up. Negative coordinates indicate to the left or down. In Figure 2-1, I’ve
graphed the points (3,2), (–4,3), (–5,–2), (6,–3), (0,5), and (–2,0). Notice that the points that
have a 0 as one of the coordinates lie on one of the axes.

Q.
Refer to Figure 2-1. Give the coordinates of
the points that are on the opposite side of
the y-axis from the points that are graphed
there.
A.
The point opposite (3,2) is (-3,2); the point
opposite (–4,3) is (4,3); the point opposite
(–5,–2) is (5,–2); the point opposite (6,–3)
is (–6,–3); and the point opposite (–2,0) is
(2,0). Since the point (0,5) is on the y-axis,
it has no opposite.
Q.
Give the coordinates of the points that are
on the opposite side of the x-axis from the
points (–2,3), (4,–7) and (–6,–1).
A.
The point opposite (–2,3) is (–2,-3); the
point opposite (4,–7) is (4,7); and the point
opposite (–6,–1) is (–6,1).

Identifying Points by Quadrant
The coordinate plane is divided by the intersecting axes into four quadrants. These
quadrants are traditionally given the labels I, II, III, and IV. The Roman numerals start in
the upper-right-hand corner and go counterclockwise from there. In each quadrant,
the points that lie there have some common properties. The quadrants are used when
determining values for the trig functions. Angles are graphed on the coordinate plane,
and their positions with respect to the quadrants is important. Figure 2-2 shows you
the names of the different quadrants.
The common characteristics of the points in the quadrants are as follows:
Quadrant I: Both the x and y coordinates are positive.
Quadrant II: The x coordinate is negative, and the y coordinate is positive.
Quadrant III: Both the x and y coordinates are negative.
Quadrant IV: The x coordinate is positive, and the y coordinate is negative.
The points that lie on axes are not considered to be in any quadrant.

Working with Pythagoras
The Pythagorean theorem is probably one of the most easily recognized rules or equa-
tions in all of mathematics. The equation itself is easy to remember. And even if you
can’t put it into words exactly, you pretty much know how it works.
Pythagoras recognized (as did others, but he got the credit for it) that the lengths 
of the sides of any right triangle have a special relationship to one another. If you
square the lengths of all the sides and add up the two smaller squares, that’s always
equal to the larger square. Here, in math-talk, is the Pythagorean theorem:
If the lengths of the two legs (shorter sides) of a right triangle are a and b, and if
the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side, opposite the right angle) is c, then
a
b
c

.
Q.
Find the length of side a in a right triangle
if the other leg, b, measures 32 feet and the
hypotenuse, c, measures 40 feet.
A.
Replace the a and c in the Pythagorean 
theorem with the two given lengths:

Keeping Your Distance
The distance formula for finding the length of the segment between points on the coor-
dinate plane finds the horizontal distance between the points by finding the difference
between the x-coordinates, finds the vertical distance between the points by finding the
difference between the y-coordinates, and then actually uses the Pythagorean theorem 
to solve for the slant difference between them. The formula d

Finding Midpoints of Segments
The midpoint of a segment that’s graphed on the coordinate plane can be found by
simply averaging the x and y coordinates. Finding the midpoint is important if you’re

and need the bisector. Here’s the formula for the midpoint of a segment with endpoints

Dealing with Slippery Slopes
The slope of a line or segment tells you something about the character of that line or
segment. The slope is a number — either positive or negative — that tells you whether
a line or segment is rising as you read from left to right or falling as you read from left
to right. The positive slopes rise; the negative slopes fall. The rest of the information
has to do with the steepness of the line or segment.
A line with a slope of 1 or –1 is diagonal going upward or downward and, if it goes
through the origin, it bisects the two quadrants it goes through. Slopes that are greater
than 1 or smaller than –1 (such as slopes of 7, –5, 4.2, –9.3, and so on) indicate lines that
are steep. They’re steeper than those with the benchmark slope of 1. Slopes that are
proper fractions — the values are between –1 and 1 — are for lines that are fairly flat. The
closer the value of the slope is to 0, the closer the line or segment is to being horizontal.
Slopes of lines can be determined by choosing any two points on the line and putting
them into the slope formula. If you have two points on a line,

Writing Equations of Circles
A circle plays a big part in trigonometry, because it’s used when formulating measures
of angles and function values for the trig functions. The unit circle, a circle usually cen-
tered at the origin and always with a radius of 1 unit, is used the most, but the rest of
the circles need to be discussed and worked with, too. Here are the equations of cir-

Graphing Circles
A circle is determined, uniquely, by its center and radius. Graphing circles is done
quickly and accurately by first determining where the center is on the coordinate
plane, and then counting off the radius to the left, right, above, and below that center.
The circle can then be drawn in using the endpoints of those radii.

rigonometry is all about angles. Angles can be measured in degrees or radians, but the
starting place is degrees, which is what this chapter is about. Angle measures are the
input values for the trigonometric functions. The size of the angle determines the value of
the function. An angle of 100 degrees makes some functions positive and some negative.
The positions of the angles with respect to the different quadrants is what determines the
signs of the different functions. This chapter acquaints you with the relative positions of the
angles so that the function values will make more sense.

Before any angle measures can be covered, the standard position of an angle has to be estab-
lished. An angle in standard position has its initial (beginning) side on the positive x-axis, and
the terminal (ending) side is rotated counterclockwise from that initial side. The sweep of that
terminal side determines the size of the angle formed. Figure 3-1 shows an angle of 30 degrees
in standard position. Notice that the positive x-axis is labeled with 0 degrees, and the positive
y-axis is labeled with 90 degrees.
The angles in Quadrant I are greater than 0 degrees and less than 90 degrees. They’re all
acute angles. In Figure 3-2, rays are drawn to indicate every 15 degrees in the first quadrant.
The 30-degree angle is drawn in again.

Expanding Angles to Other Quadrants
An angle of 30 degrees is a small part of the entire picture or of a complete circle. It’s a
good point of reference, but there are angle measures well beyond that measure. Any
angle measuring from 0 to 360 degrees can be placed in standard position before termi-
nal sides start repeating themselves. They’re all measured from the positive x-axis and
go counterclockwise from that ray. Angles in Quadrant I are greater than 0 degrees and
less than 90 degrees. Those in Quadrant II are greater than 90 degrees and less than
180 degrees. In Quadrant III, they’re greater than 180 degrees and less than 270 degrees.
And in Quadrant IV, they’re greater than 270 degrees and less than 360 degrees.

Expanding Angles beyond 360 Degrees
Just when you thought you’d seen everything there is to see as far as angle measures, I’m
here to tell you that there’s more — and more and more. Angle measures aren’t restricted
to numbers between 0 and 360 degrees. They can go on beyond 360. It’s just that angles
greater than 360 degrees have to share terminal sides with other angles. I provide more
information on that in the “Dealing with Coterminal Angles” section, later in this chapter.
Q.
What positive angle measuring less than
360 degrees has the same terminal side as
an angle of 930 degrees?
A.
An angle measuring 210 degrees has the
same terminal side as an angle of 930
degrees. I determined how many times the
terminal side goes completely around by
subtracting 360 twice. 930 – 360 = 570, and
570 – 360 = 210. Look at the graph of this
angle in the figure.
Q.
What positive angle measuring less than
360 degrees has the same terminal side as
an angle of 1650 degrees?
A.
An angle measuring 210 degrees has
the same terminal side as an angle of
1650 degrees. Subtract 360 four times
from 1650 to get 210.

Coordinating with Negative Angle Measures
Not all angles have positive measures. An angle in standard position starts its measure
on the positive x-axis and, if it’s positive, goes counterclockwise. You can draw angles
going in the other direction (clockwise) if you indicate that it’s a negative measure.
Why measure in the other direction? Maybe you get dizzy going counterclockwise and
need to turn clockwise. Figure 3-4 shows two angles that have negative measures.

Part I: Trying Out Trig: Starting at the Beginning 
Dealing with Coterminal Angles
An angle has an initial side and terminal side. When two angles share the same terminal
side, they’re said to be coterminal. Angles that are coterminal when they’re in standard
position have a particular relationship. Let angles A and B be coterminal. Then the
measure of angle A is equal to the measure of angle B + 360n, where n is some integer.
If n is positive, then angle A goes through one or more complete revolutions before
ending at the terminal side. If n is negative, then A is a negative angle (if B is less than
360 degrees) and may go through one or more revolutions, also. If n is 0, then A and B
are the same angle.
Q.
Show that the angles measuring 1280
degrees and –520 degrees are both cotermi-
nal with an angle measuring 200 degrees.
A.
Let the measure of all three angles be rep-
resented by 200 + 360n:
When n = 0, 200 + 360 (0) = 200 + 0 = 200.
When n = 3, 200 + 360 (3) = 200 + 1080 = 1280.
When n = –2, 200 + 360 (–2) = 200 – 720 =
–520

Answers to Problems on Measuring in Degrees
The following are the solutions to the practice problems presented earlier in 
this chapter.
a
Use the graph shown in the figure, with 15-degree increments, to determine the measure of the
angle in standard position. 60 degrees.
Each section is 15 degrees, so this angle measures 60 degrees.
b
Use the graph shown in the figure, with 15-degree increments, to determine the measure of the
angle in standard position. 45 degrees.
Each section is 15 degrees, so this angle is 45 degrees.
c
The graph in the figure shows 15-degree increments. Give the measure of the angle drawn on
the graph. 135 degrees.
This angle spans 9 sections, so that’s 135 degrees. Another way of looking at it is that Quadrant
I contains 90 degrees. This angle is 45 degrees (three sections) more than that: 90 + 45 = 135.
d
The graph in the figure shows 15-degree increments. Give the measure of the angle drawn on
the graph. 195 degrees.
This angle spans 13 sections, so that’s 195 degrees. Another way of looking at it is that Quad-
rants I and II contain 180 degrees. This angle is 15 degrees (one section) more than that: 
180 + 15 = 195.

j
Find the measures of two angles coterminal with an angle of –1000 degrees that both have
absolute values less than 360. 80 and –280.
First, –1000 + 360 (3) = –1000 + 1080 = 80 degrees. Second, –1000 + 360 (2) = –1000 + 720 = –280.
Both of these — 80 and –280 — have absolute values less than 360.

easuring angles in degrees is how trigonometry got started. The number 360 for the
number of degrees wasn’t completely arbitrary, but it was man-chosen and created
to be convenient. Radian measure is something more natural. It’s based on the circumfer-
ence of the circle and on another natural number, π. The advantage that radian measure has
over degree measure is that radian measures are already real numbers. The degree meas-
urement is something that doesn’t combine easily with other numbers. Multiplying degrees
times inches is like trying to multiply apples times cars — they just don’t compute.
A radian is about 57 degrees — and about is the best I can do. A circle is divided into
360 degrees, and it’s also divided into 2π radians — that means there are about 2(3.14) =
6.28 radians in the complete circle — as opposed to 360 smaller measures. Radian measure
is really more usable in science, engineering, and other mathematical applications, because
it’s directly linked to the size of the circle. It’s just that radians aren’t as nice a number to
work with.

Most radian measures of angles are given in terms of a multiple of π. But it’s still impor-
tant to acquaint yourself with the relative measures of degrees and radians. When
sketching radian measure, use an estimate of about one-sixth of the circle for each
radian, and you won’t go wrong.
Q.
In what quadrant will an angle measuring
2 radians lie?
A.
Quadrant II. Two radians is about
114 degrees.
Q.
In what quadrant will an angle measuring
3.2π radians lie?
A.
Quadrant III. This is slightly more than 3π
radians. 3π radians is equal to 540 degrees.
The terminal side of an angle of 540 degrees
is the same as an angle of 180 degrees. So
the angle of 3.2π goes slightly past that left
axis into Quadrant III.

Changing from Degrees to Radians
Working in trigonometry, calculus, and other mathematical areas can require you to
switch from degree measures to radian measures and back again. You may be lucky
enough to have a calculator to do the conversion for you, but it’s always a good idea to
have a backup in the form of a pencil and paper for computation. A fairly easy formula
will serve to change from one form to the other. You don’t need to memorize two dif-
ferent formulas for the two different conversions.
To change from degrees to radians or vice versa, use the formula 
π
180
R
c =
i
i , where c
i is 
the general angle theta measured in degrees, and 
R

is the same angle theta measured
in radians.

Measuring Arcs
The distance all the way around a circle is its circumference. A piece of the circumfer-
ence is called an arc. To find the length of a particular arc, all you need is the measure
of the central angle (an angle with its vertex at the center) that cuts off that arc, and
the radius of the circle. In Figure 4-2, there’s a picture of a circle with a radius of 6
inches and a central angle measuring 75 degrees. In the example, I find the length of
the arc cut off by that angle. The formula for finding the length of an arc is s
r
= i where
θ is the central angle given in radians, and r is the radius of the circle.

A sector of a circle is like a slice of pie or a wedge of a round cheese. In Chapter 1,
you’ll find a method for finding the area of a sector of a circle by figuring out what frac-
tion of the circle you’re dealing with, and then multiplying by the area of the entire
circle. Radians make the job easier, because they fit right into a formula for the area of

 Applying the right triangle to practical applications
T
he right triangle can take on many different sizes and shapes, but all right triangles have
one important characteristic: They have a right angle — the two shorter sides of the tri-
angle meet to form a 90-degree angle. Triangles can have only one right angle. The other two
angles are acute angles. The two acute angles are also complementary, and some interesting
properties arise in the trig functions because of this.
Naming the Parts of a Right Triangle
A right triangle has six parts, like any other triangle. Special designations for right triangles
are used to identify particular properties. The two shorter sides — the ones opposite the
acute angles — are called the legs. The longest side is called the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse
is always opposite the right angle. The legs also have special names, when they’re being 
considered with respect to a particular acute angle. A leg is called opposite or adjacent,
depending on whether it’s not a part of the acute angle (opposite) or whether it’s one of the
sides of the acute angle (adjacent). And the names change for the legs, depending on which
acute angle you’re talking about at the time.
Look at the triangle ABC in Figure 5-1 and the different descriptions that can arise. The seg-
ment CD is perpendicular to the side AB, creating two right triangles within a right triangle.

In Figure 5-1, when considering acute angle B in triangle ABC, side AC is opposite and
side BC is adjacent to angle B. When considering acute angle A in triangle ABC, side BC
is opposite and side AC is adjacent to angle A.
In triangle ABC, side AB is the hypotenuse. In triangle ACD, side AC is the hypotenuse. In
triangle BCD, side BC is the hypotenuse.

Completing Pythagorean Triples
A Pythagorean triple is a listing of three numbers that satisfy the Pythagorean theo-
rem. Some examples of Pythagorean triples are: {3, 4, 5}, {5, 12, 13}, and {21, 220, 221}.
A Pythagorean triple provides a solution to a

generate an infinite number of Pythagorean triples that are integers (not fractions).
You can choose any two positive integers — call them s and t. Let s be larger than t.
Then the following three numbers are a Pythagorean triple:

A.
The product st = 12 occurs when s = 12, 
t = 1; or s = 6, t = 2; or s = 4, t = 3. So there
are three Pythagorean triples to create.

Completing Right Triangles
The three sides of a right triangle must satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. This is very
useful to carpenters who can use this to be sure that the sides of a house meet in a right
angle. They’ll measure the distance from the corner to a designated point on one wall,
then the distance from the same corner to a designated point on the other wall (all of this
at the same level above the ground). Then, measuring from point to point, they expect to
get a value that will complete the Pythagorean theorem or they square the corner.

Working with the 30-60-90 Right Triangle
One of the two special types of right triangles is the 30-60-90 right triangle. What makes
it special is the relationship between the lengths of the sides. Oh, there’s always the
relationship of the Pythagorean theorem, but something even more special occurs in
these triangles.
In a 30-60-90 right triangle, the hypotenuse is always twice the length of the shorter leg
(the one opposite the 30-degree angle), and the longer leg (opposite the 60-degree 
angle) is always 3 times as long as the shorter leg (that’s about 1.73 times as long).
Figure 5-2 shows a 30-60-90 right triangle and the relative lengths of the sides.

If you know that the hypotenuse of a
30-60-90 right triangle measures 8 feet, 
then how long are the legs?

Because the hypotenuse in this triangle is

shorter leg is 4 feet long. The longer leg is

You may be tempted to say that the two
legs are each 2 inches, because there’s the

then the sum of the two legs would be 4, 
and the perimeter would be 2

Using the Isosceles Right Triangle
The other special right triangle is the isosceles right triangle, otherwise known as 
the 45-45-90 right triangle. There are special relationships between the sides of this 
triangle — in addition to the Pythagorean theorem relationship.
In an isosceles right triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is always 2 times the
length of either leg (which, of course, are the same measure, because the triangle is
isosceles). This means that the hypotenuse is about 1.41 times as large as the legs.
Figure 5-3 illustrates the 45-45-90 right triangle.

Using Right Triangles in Applications
Now it’s time to make use of these right triangles and show how they can solve practi-
cal problems. The right triangle can be used if you know the measures of two sides and
need a third. Also, if you have one of the special right triangles (the angle measures are
available) you just need the measure of one of the sides to get the others.
Q.
Clay has sighted his cat at the top of a tree.
He needs to find a ladder long enough to

of the tree. How long a ladder does he need
to reach the top of the tree? Look at the
figure, which shows the relative measures.

Answers to Problems on Right Triangles
The following are the solutions to the practice problems presented earlier in this chapter.
a
In Figure 5-1, what side is opposite angle A in right triangle ACD? Side CD.
b
In Figure 5-1, what side is adjacent to angle B, in right triangle BCD? Side BD.
The side that is adjacent to angle B in right triangle BCD is side BD. Side BC is the hypotenuse,
because it’s opposite the right angle.
c
In Figure 5-1, name the three right angles. Angle ACB, angle ADC, and angle BDC.
The vertex of the angle is always named as the middle letter.
d
In Figure 5-1, what acute angle in triangle ACD is the same measure as angle BCD in triangle
BCD? (The three triangles are all similar to one another — they have angles that correspond
and are equal to one another.) Angle A.
Both of the angles, BCD in triangle BCD and A in triangle ACD, are between the hypotenuse and
the shorter leg in their respective triangles.

How long a fishing rod can you put into a box that’s 3 feet by 5 feet by 8 feet? You need to find
the diagonal length from one corner to its opposite. ≈9.9 feet.
The fishing rod can be put in the box on the diagonal, so it’ll go from the bottom-front corner to
the top-back corner on the other side. Refer to the left side of the figure.
First, find the diagonal across the bottom of the box. This is one of the legs of the right triangle
needed to solve the problem. Let the diagonal distance across the bottom be represented by c.
Half of the bottom is a right triangle with legs measuring 3 feet and 5 feet. The value of c is the
hypotenuse of that right triangle. Solving for c, using the Pythagorean theorem,

When she stands in front of a picture that’s 6 feet high (its length is 6 feet), she can see 30 degrees

Stephanie walks 3 miles east and then 3 miles north. Chelsea joins her, but she walks on the
diagonal (the hypotenuse of the right triangle). Chelsea sits and waits while Stephanie walks
another 12 miles east and 5 miles north. Again, Chelsea joins her by walking the diagonal. How
much farther did Stephanie walk than Chelsea? 6 miles.
Stephanie is walking the legs of two right triangles, and Chelsea is walking the hypotenuses.
Look at the figure, and you’ll see what I mean.
Stephanie walked a total of 24 miles: 3 + 4 + 12 + 5 = 24.
Chelsea walked a total of 18 miles. The first part of her walk was 5 miles. This is the hypotenuse
of a 3-4-5 right triangle. The second part of her walk was 13 miles. This is the hypotenuse of a
5-12-13 right triangle.
So Stephanie walked 6 miles farther than Chelsea to get to the same place.
If the numbers hadn’t turned out this nicely, you could use the Pythagorean theorem to solve
for the missing values in the right triangles.

Crystal sights the top of a 100-foot tower and notes that the angle formed from the ground

Look at the figure for more information on this situation.
The distance between Crystal and David is the sum of the distances x and y. In the left triangle,
x is one of the two equal legs of an isosceles right triangle. The other leg is the 100-foot tower,
so x also is 100 feet long. In the right triangle, y is the longer leg of a 30-60-90 right triangle. The

he measures of angles, whether they’re in degrees or radians, are the input values
for trigonometric functions. There are six basic trig functions: sine, cosine, tangent,
cotangent, secant, and cosecant. These functions have output values that are real numbers.
These output values are the result of operating on angle measures. In this chapter, the func-
tions are defined in terms of the measures of the sides of a right triangle. These definitions
are expanded on in Chapter 8, where angles that couldn’t be in a right triangle are introduced
into the big picture.
The trigonometric functions, when defined in terms of a right triangle, are the ratios between
pairs of sides. An acute angle is chosen, and sides are considered with respect to this angle.
Use Figure 6-1 in the discussions of the different functions in this chapter.
A common way of labeling a triangle is to name the angles with capital letters and the sides
opposite the angles with corresponding lowercase letters.

Defining the Sine Function
The sine function (not to be confused with sign or sighing) is defined as being the ratio
formed when the length of the side opposite an acute angle in a right triangle is divided
by the length of the hypotenuse. In the triangle in Figure 6-1, the sine of angle B is b/c,
and the sine of angle A is a/c. The sine is abbreviated sin. So the correct mathematical 
notation for these relationships is

The cosine function is complementary to the sine function, sort of like cosigning a loan.
The cosine is defined as the ratio formed when the length of the side adjacent to an

the cosine of angle B is a/c, and the cosine of angle A is b/c. The cosine is abbreviated

Sunning with the Tangent Definition
The tangent function could be about soaking up rays (of angles), but it’s really more
down to earth. The tangent is defined as the ratio formed when the length of the side
opposite an acute angle in a right triangle is divided by the length of the adjacent side
of that same triangle. In Figure 6-1, the tangent of angle B is b/a, and the tangent of
angle A is a/b. The tangent is abbreviated tan. The correct mathematical notation for 
these relationships is

They’re reciprocals of one another. Maybe

where the tangents are b/a and a/b. This
property holds for all right triangles and
for complementary angles, in general.
Complementary angles have a sum of
90 degrees. The tangents of complemen-
tary angles are reciprocals of each another.
This comes up again when the trig identities
are formulated.

Hunting for the Cosecant Definition
The cosecant function often makes me feel like I’m telling an insect to look for some-
thing: Go Seek, Ant! Yes, that’s really stretching it, but sometimes it helps to insert
some levity when trying to differentiate among all these trig functions.
The cosecant function is defined as the ratio formed when the length of the hypotenuse
in a right triangle is divided by the length of the opposite side. This function is actually
the reciprocal of the sine function, which has the division in the opposite order. In
Figure 6-1, the cosecant of angle B is c/b, and the cosecant of angle A is c/a. The cose-
cant is abbreviated csc. The correct mathematical notation for these relationships is

Defining the Secant Function
If you keep mixing up the words of songs, you might sing Oh see can’t you say. . . . The
secant function is defined as the ratio formed when the length of the hypotenuse in a
right triangle is divided by the length of the adjacent side. In Figure 6-1, the secant of
angle B is c/a, and the secant of angle A is c/b. The secant is abbreviated sec. The correct

Q.
If the sides of a right triangle measure 28,

A.
The smallest side of a triangle is always
opposite the smallest angle, so the side
measuring 28 is the opposite side of this
angle, and 45 is the adjacent side. The
longest side of a right triangle is the
hypotenuse, so the ratio of the hypotenuse 
to the adjacent side in this case is 45
53.

How is a cotangent co- with a tangent? It’s because their function values are recipro-

the side adjacent to an acute angle in a right triangle is divided by the length of the
opposite side. In Figure 6-1, the cotangent of angle B is a/b, and the cotangent of
angle A is b/a. The cotangent is abbreviated cot. The correct mathematical notation

The measures of the three sides can be rep-
resented by: x, 2x – 1, and 2x + 1. The cotan-
gent is adjacent divided by opposite for
each acute angle, and the two legs are the x

The trig functions for specific angles are always the same, no matter what size right 
triangle they’re in. The sine of 30 degrees is 1⁄2 no matter what. Special right triangles
come in very handy when computing the values of the trig functions for their acute
angles. The two special right triangles shown in Figure 6-2 have the measures of their
sides indicated in general, but, no matter what you let x be (as long as it’s a positive
number), the different trig functions for the angles will come out the same.

Applying the Trig Functions
The right triangle is very useful when solving practical problems where the lengths of
two of the sides are known, and solving for the third measure ends up being the
answer to the problem. Good old Pythagoras comes in handy in those cases.
Using trig functions, problems can be solved when only one side has a known meas-
ure. What’s needed to complete the problem is the measure of one of the acute angles.
The applications here will deal with situations where the known angle is 30 degrees,
45 degrees, or 60 degrees. Other angles can be used if you have a table of values or a
scientific calculator, and those work the same way as these problems. Use the function
values for the angles from the previous section in this chapter.

Jim and Jane are walking east toward the main road. Jane decides to cut diagonally to the north
at an angle of 30 degrees north of east. Jim continues on for the last 20 feet to the road. How far
apart are they when they both reach the road? (See the figure for an illustration.) ≈11.5 feet.
Let x represent the distance between Jim and Jane. This distance is opposite a 30-degree angle.
The measure of 20 feet is the adjacent side of the 30-degree angle, so the tangent function
should be used. Set up a proportion using the tangent of 30 degrees and the opposite side

T
he trig functions act like other mathematical functions, because they follow the rule 
that there can be only one output for every input value. What makes the trig functions
unique is that the input values are all angle measures and, also, that the trig functions are
periodic — the function values repeat over and over and over in a predictable pattern. The
trig functions can be used to model natural occurrences that repeat over and over such as
weather, planet revolutions, and seasonal sales.
Defining a Function and Its Inverse
A function is a relationship between input and output values in which there’s exactly one
output for every input in the function’s domain. The domain consists of all the possible input
values. Some functions have inverses. An inverse reverses the result of the function opera-
tion and tells you what you started with or what was input to get that. Not all functions have
inverses. The trig functions technically have inverses only for small parts of their domains.
The inverse trig functions are thoroughly covered in Chapter 12.

Deciding on the Domains
The domain of a function consists of all the input values that the function has. The
domains of the sine and cosine functions aren’t restricted — they can be anything. But
the domains of the other functions have omissions or values that are skipped. Here’s a
rundown on the functions and their domains:
 Sine: All angles; all real numbers.
 Cosine: All angles; all real numbers.
 Tangent: All angles except 90 degrees, 270 degrees, and odd multiples of those 
angles; all real numbers except 
,
π

 Cotangent: All angles except 0 degrees, 180 degrees, and multiples of 180; all real
numbers except multiples of π.

angles; all real numbers except

Q.
Which of the trig functions have all angles

A.
The sine, cosine, cosecant, and cotangent

domains. The sine and cosine also include
0 and 180. The cosecant and cotangent
don’t include those two values. The tan-
gent and secant were excluded from this
answer, because neither includes the 
90-degree angle in its domain.

Reaching Out for the Ranges
The range of a function consists of all the values that are a result of performing the
function on the input. It’s all the output values. The following are the ranges of the
trigonometric functions:
 Sine: All real numbers between –1 and 1, including those two values
 Cosine: All real numbers between –1 and 1, including those two values
 Tangent: All real numbers
 Cotangent: All real numbers
 Secant: All real numbers 1 and greater, and all real numbers –1 and smaller
 Cosecant: All real numbers 1 and greater, and all real numbers –1 and smaller
As you can see, the sine and cosine are caught between –1 and 1, the secant and cose-
cant don’t have any range values between –1 and 1, and the tangent and cotangent are
all over the place.
Q.
Which of the functions have a range that
includes all the positive numbers?
A.
This can be only the tangent and cotan-
gent. The others have ranges that include
some positive numbers, but not all of them.

98
Part II: Trigonometric Functions 
Closing In on Exact Values
An exact value is a number that isn’t rounded off or truncated. It’s exactly the correct 
value. For instance, the fraction 8
5 is exact, and its decimal equivalent, 0.625 is exact. 
The fraction 6
1 is exact, but it has a repeating decimal, 0.1666 . . . that keeps going on 
forever. You can round this decimal off to 0.1667 or some other such value, but that isn’t
exact; it’s an approximation — even though the rounded version is more convenient.
The exact values for trig functions are the ones that are written as integers or rational
numbers or radicals. These values are often preferred for very exacting computations.
When someone is building a bridge, you’d prefer she be exact. The exact values of the
most commonly used angles in trig functions are those for the angles found in the spe-
cial right triangles.
Two more angles are going to be added here, 0 degrees and 90 degrees. An angle of
0 degrees has an opposite side that measures 0. The adjacent side and hypotenuse
are the same. Just for convenience, let the adjacent side and hypotenuse have 
measures of x. Then sin

. The 90-degree angle is a little harder to explain, because you 
can’t have two 90-degree angles in one triangle, but if you let the opposite side and the
hypotenuse be the same measure and let the adjacent side be 0, you’ll get the function 
values for 90 degrees: sin

Part II: Trigonometric Functions 
The value for the tangent of each angle is found by dividing the sine by the cosine.
The cotangent of each angle is the reciprocal of the tangent. The secant is the
reciprocal of the cosine. And the cosecant is the reciprocal of the sine. These are
all derived from the definitions of the different functions in the right triangle —
with a little hand-waving for the angles measuring 0 and 90.
Q.
How can you determine the exact value of
the secant of 60 degrees using a value in
Table 7-5?
A.
The secant is the reciprocal of the cosine.
Just flip the 1/2, and you get that the
secant of 60 degrees is 2⁄1 which is, of
course, 2.
Q.
How can you determine the exact value of
the cotangent of 0 degrees using a value in
Table 7-5?
A.
The cotangent is the reciprocal of the 
tangent. The tangent of 0 degrees is 0,
and that number doesn’t have a reciprocal
(you can’t divide by 0). So the cotangent
doesn’t have any value, let alone an exact
one, for 0 degrees.

escribing the trig functions using a right triangle makes sense and fosters good under-
standing of what the trig functions are and do. But there’s a much bigger picture to
consider when dealing with angles and the trig functions.
Instead of creating function values for every angle there is — positive or negative, one or
more full rotations — a better system exists. All angles can be related to other angles that are
within one full rotation. They’re related by their shared terminal side. You just have to focus
on the angles within one rotation — those between 0 and 360 degrees.
Finding Points on the Unit Circle
The unit circle is a circle that has a radius of 1 unit. It’s most often found with its center at the
origin. The equation of this unit circle is x
y

satisfy the equation. For instance, the point

of points on the unit circle. For example, the following points lie on the unit circle:

Determining Reference Angles
The values of the trigonometric functions can be related to the ratios of the sides of
a right triangle. Imagine a right triangle sitting in Quadrant II, with a negative value
assigned to the adjacent side. Or try Quadrant III, assigning negative values to both the
opposite and adjacent sides. This concept is used to assign values to the trig functions
that are greater than 90 degrees. You just have to figure out which triangle in which
quadrant is to be used. Hence, reference angles: The reference angle for a particular
angle helps determine the values of the trig functions. Table 8-1 shows you how to
determine reference angles.

Assigning the Signs of Functions by Quadrant
The position of the terminal side of an angle in standard position determines the signs
of the different trig functions for the angle. Think of a terminal side as being the
hypotenuse of a right triangle. A right triangle in Quadrant III would be assigned a 
negative opposite side and a negative adjacent side. The way that the different ratios
are put together creates either positive or negative results. Instead of trying to piece
together the quadrant and the ratio and the division result, you can use a quick, easy
method to remember the signs of the trig functions based on the terminal side of the
angle. Look at Figure 8-1.
The A, S, T, and C stand for:
 A: All angles
 S: Sine (and its reciprocal, cosecant)
 T: Tangent (and its reciprocal, cotangent)
 C: Cosine (and its reciprocal, secant)
The letters indicate which of the functions is positive in the particular quadrant. In
Quadrant III, for example, only the tangent and cotangent are positive — all the other
functions are negative. I was taught that the letters stand for: All Students Take
Calculus. You can make up your own saying, if you prefer.

Figuring Out Trig Functions around the Clock
Using reference angles and signs of angles in the different quadrants, you can deter-
mine the values of trig functions of many angles. The best angles to start with are
those that are multiples of 30, 45, and 60 degrees.
To find the value of the trig function:
1. Determine the quadrant in which the terminal side of the angle lies, and find
the sign of the function in that quadrant.
2. Determine the reference angle.
3. Use the chart on the Cheat Sheet (if you don’t have them memorized) that has the
exact values of many angles between 0 and 90 degrees to find the function value.
4. Apply the sign of the function to the numerical value.
Q.
Find the value of cos 135 degrees.
A.
The terminal side is in Quadrant II; the
cosine is negative in Quadrant II. Find the
reference angle by subtracting 180 – 135 = 
45 degrees. The cosine of 45 degrees is 2

Using the negative, the answer is

ne thing that makes trig statements and equations so interesting is their flexibility and
how many ways you can write them. If you don’t like what you see, just replace it with
something equivalent. There are several classifications of trigonometric identities — three
of which are covered in this chapter.
Using the Reciprocal Identities
The reciprocal identities deal with the ways that the six basic trig functions can be paired
up — three pairs of functions with their reciprocals (multiplicative inverses). The reciprocal

Creating the Ratio Identities
The ratio identities are the two identities in which the tangent and cotangent functions
are defined in terms of sine and cosine. The two ratios, tangent and cotangent, are
reciprocals of one another — just another confirmation of the relationship between
the tangent and cotangent. The ratio identities are:
tan
cos
sin
x
xx
=
cot

The ratio identities are helpful when solving identity problems where the technique
being used is to change every function to sine and cosine.

Playing Around with Pythagorean Identities
There are three Pythagorean identities. The first of these identities, the one involving
sine and cosine, is frequently used in all sorts of work dealing with trigonometric

Solving Identities Using Reciprocals,
Ratios, and Pythagoras
To solve an identity means to show that, in fact, it is a true statement — that one side
of the equation is equal to the other side of the equation. Many techniques can be
used, but the common thread through all of them is using the proper substitutions.
You have to look at the statement and decide what would work best (that is, most
quickly and efficiently). You won’t always make the best choice — that comes with
practice — but, if you always use a correct substitution and do correct manipulations,
you won’t destroy the truth of the statement. You just may not make it any better. Here
are some examples using better choices.

 Adding and subtracting in identities

 Taking half an angle in identities
 Solving identities with sums, differences, and multiple angles
T
he identities involving sums, differences, doubling, and other multiples all require you
to determine the exact value of angles that are results of these operations on the more
popularly used angles. These formulas are also valuable when changing the form of an
expression to make it more workable in a particular situation. The groupings of identities
have their similarities and differences.
Adding Up the Angles with Sum Identities
The identities for the function of the sum of two different angles allow you to write,
for instance, an angle of 75 degrees as the sum of angles of 45 degrees and 30 degrees.
The examples and problems here deal with angles you already have exact values for, but
these identities can be applied to any angles whose functions are known or unknown.

The sine of a negative angle is the opposite
(negative) of the sine of the corresponding
positive angle. With the cosine, though, the
opposite angle and its corresponding posi-
tive angle have the same function value.
The tangent works the same as the sine —
it’s a negative value.

Doubling Your Pleasure with 
Double Angle Identities
The double angle identities allow you to find the function value of twice the angle —
if you know the function value of the original angle. They’re also used to simplify

the solution to a problem.

Multiplying the Many by Combining
Sums and Doubles
The multiples of angles in identities aren’t restricted to just twice an angle. You can
also multiply an angle by 3, 4, 5, or whatever you want to find function values of those
multiples of an angle. The sin 7x can be found by using sin (4x + 3x), and sin 4x can be
found using sin 2(2x), while sin 3x = sin (2x + x). Whew! I’m not going to work through
all the identities it would take to write one for sin 7x. I’d need sines and cosines of 4x
and 3x, but the examples here show you the techniques needed.

Halving Fun with Half-Angle Identities
The half-angle identities can be used to find function values for angles of 15 degrees
(half of 30), 22.5 degrees (half of 45), and 7.5 degrees (half of 15 — which is half of 30).
The half-angle identities are also used a lot in calculus to change from an expression
that has a difficult solution to another form that’s more manageable. Having these
identities in your arsenal of possibilities is a good idea.
The half-angle identities are:

Simplifying Expressions with Identities
To simplify an expression in trigonometry means to make it simpler or more useable
for the particular application. You may want to change it so only one function is used
in the whole expression. You may want it factored so it can be set equal to zero or
reduced in a fraction. Whatever the case, the trig identities are available to make the
simplification possible.

Solving Identities
To solve an identity means to show that one side of the equation is equal to the other.
These statements are true for all values of the variable that can be used with the func-
tions involved. These are different from the equations in trigonometry where you have
to find the specific angle measures that make the statement true. This process of solv-
ing identities involves doing substitutions using the basic identities. It also means
using the rules of algebra and solving equations.

. The choice of the particular version of 
the double angle identity for the cosine wasn’t just random. I had in mind the next step — that
I’ll divide every term in the fraction by the square of cosine. (This is the same as multiplying
both numerator and denominator by the reciprocal of the square.) Then I’ll use the ratio iden-
tity to simplify the answer.

This looks very much like problem 22, but it isn’t. The goal here is to have both sides be
the same. Start with writing the left side as cos (2x + x), but choose a different double-angle 
formula — you want everything in terms of cosine.

One way to change to cotangents is to change all the tangent terms using the reciprocal iden-
tity. That will create a complex fraction (fractions within a fraction). Instead, a quicker, neater
approach is to just multiply each term in the numerator and denominator by the square of 
cot x. The product (tan x)(cot x) = 1.

olving trigonometric identities is good exercise for the mind. It’s also a great skill to
develop so you can become better at algebra, conquer trigonometry, and prepare for
calculus. Take your pick, the reason is here.
Sometimes, the best method needed to solve a trig identity just leaps out at you. Other
times, you just have to make an educated guess or jump in and try something. In this chap-
ter, I discuss many different options that you can use to solve trig identities. Often, more than
one technique will work on the same identity. Your goal is to pick the one that’s quickest and
easiest for you.
Working on One Side at a Time
The preferred method for solving identities is to work on just one side of the equation and
make it match the other side. You look for the more complicated side to work on — the one
with more terms or functions other than sine or cosine. It’s usually easier to make two terms
become one than the other way around. In the following two examples, I show you how to
solve the same identity working from one side and then the other. You can decide which you
think is easier and clearer.

A.
First split up the fraction on the left into

numerators and the same denominator.
After that, reduce the first fraction and
then change all the functions on the left
using reciprocal identities:

Working Back and Forth on Identities
The optimum situation when solving an identity is when you can work on just one side
of the equation and get it to match the other side. That isn’t always practical, though.
Sometimes you have to work on each side separately to get them to be the same.

cube of sine, use a Pythagorean identity,
factor the difference of squares, and reduce.

This identity particularly begs to be solved
by working on both sides at the same time.
There don’t seem to be any connections,
otherwise. Use the tangent sum identity on
the left, and use a Pythagorean identity in
the numerator, on the right. The tangent of
π is replaced with its numerical value, 0.

Changing Everything to Sine and Cosine
The two most basic trigonometric functions are the sine and cosine. They’re in the ratios
for tangent and cotangent. They’re the reciprocals of cosecant and secant. For this reason,
a good technique to use when solving identities is to change every function until it only
has sines and cosines in it. You have fewer variables to look at when solving the identity.
Q.

Multiplying by Conjugates
The technique of multiplying by conjugates comes up in several situations in mathemat-
ics. You use it with radicals, complex numbers, and now, in trigonometry. A conjugate
of an expression is similar to the original expression. It has the same two variables or
numbers, but the opposite sign is between them. The conjugate of x + 4 is x – 4. You
multiply by conjugates when solving identities and you’re stuck with a fraction with
two terms in the denominator — and there’s nothing else you can do with it.

Finding Common Denominators
Before you can add or subtract fractions, you have to be sure that the denominators
are the same. If they aren’t, you determine their common denominator and rewrite the
fractions. This process is actually very helpful when solving identities. It allows you to
add those fractions together, and it’s usually a big help in solving the identity. You use
this method when you have two or more terms on one side and only one term on the
other side of the equation. It’s a way of putting the terms together.

Writing All Functions in Terms of Just One
Each of the six trig functions has an equivalence or identity in terms of each of the other
trig functions. The sine function can be written as something equal to cosine or tangent
or cotangent or secant or cosecant. Here’s what they look like:

Writing a trig expression with just one function in it can simplify your work if you’re
having to put in function values for a lot of problems. You can just find the value for
the one function and use it over and over. I gave you the equivalents for sine. Here’s
how I got a couple of them. In each case, I chose an identity that involved the sine and
also the other function it’s to be written in terms of. Sometimes you have to also use a
reciprocal of the function you want.

assigned when you know which quadrant
the angle is in that you’re working with.

Q.
Write the sine in terms of the tangent.
A.
The sine and tangent aren’t alone in any
standard identity. Start with the ratio iden-
tity involving the tangent and solve for
the sine.

Use the reciprocal identity on the cosine,
so the expression is in terms of the tangent
and secant. Then you can use the
Pythagorean identity involving the tangent
and secant to solve for the secant in terms
of tangent and substitute it in.

nverse trig functions work much like the inverses of the algebraic functions. The inverse
reverses the operations and figures out what the input was. The main difference between
the algebraic and trig inverses, though, is that there are restrictions on the results of applying
the inverse trig functions. Each function has its own designation in terms of which quadrants
apply.
There are inverse trig functions and inverse trig relations. The functions act as all functions
do — one answer for each input. The relations give an infinite number of answers — 
everything that works. For example, the inverse sine function is designated with
x
x
Arcsin
or Sin
1
-
, and the inverse sine relation is designated with arcsin
sin
x
x
or
1
-
.
The rest of the functions have similar notation. To tell them apart, the inverse trig functions
are capitalized, and the relations aren’t.
The –1 superscript written between the function and the angle means that this is an inverse
function; it doesn’t mean that the function is being raised to that power.
Determining the Correct Quadrants
When applying the inverse sine function, the range (output) or results are always angles in
Quadrant I and Quadrant IV. The same is true of the cosecant and tangent. When applying
the inverse cosine, secant, or cotangent, the answer is always an angle in Quadrant I or II.
This way, there’s only one possible answer for each inverse function input.
Q.
If you input a positive number into the
inverse cosine function, in which quadrant
will the answer lie?
A.
Quadrant I. The cosine is positive in
Quadrant I and in Quadrant IV, but the
inverse cosine function doesn’t have
results in Quadrant IV.
Q.
If you input a negative number into the
inverse tangent function, in which quad-
rant will the answer lie?
A.
Quadrant IV. The tangent is negative in
Quadrant II and Quadrant IV, but the
inverse tangent function doesn’t have
results in Quadrant II.

Evaluating Expressions Using 
Inverse Trig Functions
The notation for the inverse trig functions involves either a –1 superscript or the word
Arc in front of the name. In either case, the inverse function finds the angle measure

Solving Equations Using 
Inverse Trig Functions
The whole point of having these inverse trig functions is to put them to use when solv-
ing equations involving trig functions. You start out with an equation that contains one
or more trig functions, apply any identities or algebraic operations necessary, and then
write the solution in terms of an inverse trig function — and evaluate that function.
The examples here and the practice problems for this section apply the inverse func-
tion property or definition: There’s one answer for each input. Sections later in this
chapter deal with some other cases — where there could be more than one answer to
an equation.
Q.

tracting 1⁄2 from each side. Then rewrite the

This last line is read, “x is the angle whose

sine function, the answer is 330 degrees.

appendix, or you can use the reference
angle of 30 degrees in Quadrant IV to
reason this out.

In the equation involving the inverse tan-

lies between Quadrant I and Quadrant IV,
where the inverse tangent is defined. In the

answer is x = 90 degrees. This angle lies
between Quadrant I and Quadrant II, where
the inverse sine is defined.

Creating Multiple Answers for 
Multiple and Half-Angles
The trig functions are periodic, which means that they repeat the same values over and
over again in a predictable pattern. Knowing when a particular value will occur if
you’re plotting temperatures or seasonal sales is helpful. Sometimes, more than one
answer is needed.
One trig relation can have an infinite number of answers. For instance, in 
sin
x
2
1
1
=
- c
m, 
x = 30, 150, 390, 510, 750, 870, . . . You can get pretty tired listing all of them. There is a
better way that uses a rule and the letter k to represent all the integers (positive and
negative whole numbers and 0).
Q.

sin

m in

A.
x = 30 + 360k or x = 150 + 360k. These two
rules will generate all the possible answers.
If k = 0, you just have the two angles 30
and 150. If k = 1, you have 30 + 360 = 390
and 150 + 360 = 410. Any integer will give
you another answer.

olving trigonometric equations involves many of the same techniques used in solving
algebraic equations, such as factoring, squaring both sides, and applying the quadratic
formula. One of the things that makes solving trig equations special is the ability to insert
completely different expressions by using the identities. Another thing that makes them dif-
ferent is that you can have multiple answers — mainly due to the periodic nature of the trig
functions and the way their values repeat.
Solving for Solutions within One Rotation
One rotation in trigonometry means a sweep of 360 degrees or 2π radians. It’s one time
around. Many times, this is all you need — just the answers to a trig equation within one
complete rotation. These answers usually come in pairs, because the same function values
occur in two of the four quadrants. The sines of both 30-degree and 150-degree angles are 1⁄2.

Solving Equations with Multiple Answers
Trig equations with multiple angles are going to have multiple answers. The coefficient
or multiplier on the variable is going to allow for more answers within one full rotation.
When solving equations for multiple angle values, there’s a technique to follow:
1. Solve for the angle measure, writing an equation involving an inverse trig
relation.
This isn’t a function; there’s more than one answer.
2. List all angles that satisfy this equation within one rotation.
3. Add 360 degrees (or 2π) to each angle measure, repeating for as many multi-
ples as are indicated in the problem.
If the angle is 2x, you want two rotations, so add the 360 once to each angle. If it’s
3x, add it twice, and so on.
4. Divide each angle measure by the coefficient (multiplier) of the x.

20, 40, 140, 160, 260, 280 degrees. First, solve for 3x. Then determine the two angles within

a lowercase s to show it isn’t the function.

The sine is positive in Quadrants I and II, and the sine is equal to 2

angles. Now add 360 degrees to each angle, and then add 360 degrees to those two results.
That gives you three full rotations of angles measuring 3x that have that sine.

Special Factoring for a Solution
The standard techniques of factoring out a greatest common factor (the largest value
that will divide all the terms evenly) or using unFOIL (factoring into the product of two
binomials) are the ones most commonly used when solving trigonometric equations.
The types of factoring that also may be needed are factoring binomials that have two
perfect cubes, factoring by grouping, and factoring quadratic-like equations. One that
can be dispatched rather quickly is the one involving perfect cubes. Doing the factor-
ization doesn’t really gain you much, so you might as well just take the cube root of
each side. I’ve included that little technique and explanation in this first example that
involves factoring by grouping.

A.
x = 60, 90, and 300 degrees. Factor the equation using grouping — the first two terms have
a common factor and the second two terms have a different common factor. Then factor
the common binomial out of those two results.

x = 0, 60, 300, and 360 degrees. This is a quadratic-like equation. It’s a trinomial where the
highest power is twice the other power, and the third term is a constant. You try to factor it
into the product of two binomials and then solve equations that are formed when those fac-
tors are set equal to 0. Here’s the factorization, first: sec

Using Fractions and Common Denominators
to Solve Equations
Fractions aren’t everyone’s cup of tea. People avoid them just because they’re so fussy
to deal with. What’s the fuss about? Oh, it’s those common denominators. In trig, though,
the tables are turned and you seek out fractions as aids to solving identities and equa-
tions. When you have a trig problem with fractions that have to be added, you find a
common denominator and then apply identities to finish up. And, even when you don’t
already have fractions, you introduce them by applying the identities, and then find
the common denominator. It just works so nicely.

A.
x = 30 or 150 degrees. This is a case where introducing fractions is to your benefit. Using a
reciprocal and ratio identity, the two fractions have a common denominator cos x and can
be subtracted to form one fraction.

These seem like perfectly nice answers, but they’re not. Each of these values for x makes the
denominator of the fraction equal to 0 — and you can’t have a 0 in the denominator. And, if
you look at the original equation, the tangent and secant aren’t defined for 90 or 270 degrees,
and the cosecant isn’t defined for 180 degrees. There’s no answer, but that’s an answer.

Using the Quadratic Formula
It’s always so nice when a quadratic equation factors and behaves as you’re on the
road to a solution. This isn’t always the case. Luckily, though, there’s the quadratic for-
mula to supply the answer — when all else fails. The quadratic formula works on the
general quadratic equation ax
bx
c

+

, and works just as well on trig functions.
The only change is that the x variable will be a function instead.

Revisiting the Triangle with New Laws
In This Chapter
 Finding missing parts of triangles with laws of sines and cosines
 Determining areas of triangles
 Applying triangles to practical problems
T
he right triangle plays a huge role in trigonometry. It’s used to establish the trigonomet-
ric identities and to solve interesting applications — those where a right angle can be
drawn into the picture. How about the other triangles, though? The oblique triangles —
those that aren’t right (no, they aren’t crazy) are just as useful. The oblique triangles come
with some laws and formulas that make their application possible.
A ground rule for using these oblique triangles is in the naming of their parts. By convention,
the angles are named with capital letters, and the side opposite each angle is named with a
corresponding lowercase letter. Look at Figure 14-1 for the naming that will be used in this
chapter.
Using the Law of Sines
The Law of Sines says, basically, that the ratios between the sides and sines of the angles
opposite those sides of a given triangle are the same. Refer to Figure 14-1 and look at this 
statement of the Law of Sines. sin

You can take any pair of ratios within the equation, substitute in the three values that you
know, and solve for the fourth, or unknown value. This law is used to solve for the missing
parts (sides and angles) of a triangle if you know two angles and a side opposite one of them,
or two sides and an angle opposite one of them.

A.
Angle C = 105 degrees; side b = 14.14, and
side c = 5.18. The measure of angle C is
determined by just adding the measures of
angles A and B and subtracting from 180.
180 – (30 + 45) = 180 – 75 = 105. To find the
measure of side b, use the Law of Sines
with the proportion involving angle A and
angle B. Even though you have exact values
for these angle measures, use the table
of trig functions and round all answers to
three decimal places.

Adding the Law of Cosines
The Law of Cosines is used when you have the measures of two sides of a triangle and
the angle between them and need to find one or more of the other measures of the tri-
angle. You can’t use the Law of Sines unless you have a pair made up of an angle and
its opposite side. The Law of Cosines takes care of that shortfall. You can also use this
law when you have all three sides.
The Law of Cosines is:

. It says that the square of the measure 
of some side of a triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides
minus two times the measures of those two sides times the cosine of the angle oppo-
site that first side. Whew!
The Law of Cosines has three different versions, but they all mean the same thing —
the letters are just different. Essentially, the law solves for the measure of the side
opposite the given angle.

Dealing with the Ambiguous Case
When something is ambiguous, it can have more than one meaning. The ambiguous
case in solving triangles occurs when there can be more than one angle that works in
the problem. This happens when you have the measures of two sides and an angle not
between those two sides. The sine of 30 degrees and the sine of 150 degrees are the
same value, so, if you come up with a solution that says that sin A = 0.5, which angle
do you choose for A? What you do is pick the answer that fits that particular practical
application and discard the other. The example here shows how there can be two
answers. Figure 14-2 shows the two different triangles that can have a = 4, b = 5, and
angle A = 30 degrees.

Investigating the Law of Tangents
The Law of Tangents isn’t used as much as the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines, but
it’s unique because it uses the tangent function with the angles that are formed by find-
ing the difference and sum of the angles that occur in the particular application. The
Law of Tangents is used in the same situations as the Law of Sines — when you have
two angles and a side opposite one of them. Here is the Law of Tangents:

Finding the Area of a Triangle
the Traditional Way
The best known formula used to find the area of a triangle is A
bh
2
1
=
. The only problem 
with it is that you need to know the measure of a side called the base, b, and the meas-
ure of a segment that’s perpendicular to that side drawn to the vertex opposite the
side. This is the height, h. What if you can’t find the height? That’s what the rest of the
sections in this chapter are about. This section, though, will deal with the traditional
formula, and it will incorporate some properties from trigonometry.
Q.
Find the area of a right triangle with a
hypotenuse 26 yards long and one leg
24 yards long.
A.
A = 120 square yards. The two legs of a
right triangle are perpendicular to one
another, so they form the base and the
height. To find the missing leg, use the
Pythagorean theorem.

Flying In with Heron’s Formula
Heron’s formula for finding the area of a triangle requires that you have the measures
of the three sides of the triangle. You don’t need any perpendicular measure across the
inside of the triangle. Let a triangle have sides measuring a, b, and c. Then let s be the
semiperimeter (half the perimeter — add up the sides and divide by 2). Heron’s formula 
says that the area of the triangle is: A

Finding Area with an Angle Measure
Trigonometry allows you to use another method for finding the area of a triangle.
If you know the measure of two sides of the triangle and the angle between those 
two sides, you can use the formula 
sin

Applying Triangles
The Law of Sines, Law of Cosines, and Law of Tangents allow you to find missing sides
and angles in triangles. The various formulas for area provide you with lots of options
for finding area, depending on the information that’s available. What kinds of applica-
tions are there that use these wonderful formulas? You’ll see!
Q.
Helene stands at the foot of a ladder that
reaches to the top of a large boulder. The
ladder forms a 30-degree angle with the
ground. When Helene walks 50 feet away
from the base of the ladder — away from
the boulder — the angle of elevation from
her feet to the top of the boulder is now
10 degrees. How long is the ladder? (See
the figure.)

A.
About 25 feet long. The angle supplemen-
tary to the 30-degree angle measures 
180 – 30 = 150 degrees. To find the measure
of the angle opposite the side measuring
50 feet, 180 – (150 + 10) = 180 – 160 =
20 degrees. Using the Law of Sines,

You have to choose the 8.5-degree angle, because there’s already an obtuse angle in this trian-
gle. This means that angle C is 180 – (150 + 8.5) = 180 – 158.5 = 21.5 degrees.

Doug has a triangular yard with sides that measure 100, 200, and 240 yards. He would like to
double the size of the yard in terms of square yards. If he doubles the lengths of the sides, will
it double the area? No.
Doug will get much more than twice the area by doubling the sides. This is the effect of multi-
plying the lengths and using square measures. The area of the original yard is found with 
Heron’s formula. The semiperimeter is s

his part could also be called the EKG: Extra Kindly
Graphs. Graphing the trig functions takes special care
at the onset, but then they’re so very cooperative. The
graphs repeat themselves, so you always know what’s going
on with them. I show you how to find the points of reference
for each graph, and then you see how to sketch in the rest
of the graph from them. I introduce you to the world of
asymptotes — those lines that aren’t really there. You’ll
see how this all fits together to draw an accurate graph.

he graphs of the sine and cosine functions are used extensively to model what goes on
every day, every week, and every year. These functions are periodic. They repeat their
values over and over, in predictable periods of time. Seasonal sales, temperatures, moon
phases, and other phenomena are illustrated by some version of the sine or cosine function.
The graphs of the sine and cosine functions look like waves moving across the page (see
Figure 15-1). The details involved in these graphs are covered in the sections in this chapter.
The graphs in Figure 15-1 are shown on the coordinate system, with each tick mark on the 
x-axis representing π
2 units. That’s about 1.57 units in the real-number system, and it’s equal 
to 90 degrees. Graphs of the trig functions in this chapter use these multiples of π on the 
horizontal axis. This way, both the x and y axes are using the same number system —
the real numbers.
Determining Intercepts and Extreme Values
The x-intercepts of a function are the points at which the function crosses the x-axis. The coor-
dinates of these points look like (1,0) or (–2,0). The y-coordinate is always 0. The y-intercept is
the place where the function crosses the y-axis. There’s only one y-intercept for any function
y = cos x
y = sin x

(that’s part of its definition). The coordinate always has an x-value that’s 0. Graphing the
trig functions requires that you know where the intercepts are.
Extreme values of the sine and cosine functions are where they’re the highest or
lowest. The sine and cosine functions are periodic, so these highs and lows will occur
over and over in a regular, predictable pattern. The functions y = sin x and y = cos x
have extreme values when y = 1 or y = –1.

Graphing the Basic Sine and Cosine Curves
The graphs of the sine and cosine curves are already done for you in Figure 5-1, but
the technique outlined here is used when graphing any variation on either of these
functions. Use the following procedure when graphing these functions:
1. Draw x and y axes, marking the x axis with tick marks that are a multiple of π
and the y axis with integers to fit the problem.
2. Determine all x-intercepts by solving an equation such as x = sin–1(0) or 
x = cos–1(0) for all x-values in the interval you’re graphing.
3. Graph the intercepts.
4. Determine the y-intercept by letting x = 0 and solving for y in the equation.
5. Graph the y-intercept.
6. Determine where the extreme values are by solving an equation such as 
x = sin–1(±1) or x = cos–1(±1) for all x-values in the interval you’re graphing.
7. Graph those values.

Changing the Amplitude
The amplitude of the sine and cosine function is a number telling how much it deviates
from the average value or middle value. In the graphs of y = sin x and y = cos x, the
amplitude is 1, because each of these curves has a maximum y value of 1 and a mini-
mum y value of –1. The deviation from the average or middle value (0) is 1 in either
direction. You can tell what the amplitude is by looking at the coefficient (multiplier) of
sin x or cos x in the equation. The amplitude of y = 5sin x is 5; the graph goes to a high
of 5 and a low of –5.
Q.
Sketch the graph of y = 2sin x.

Notice that, where the extreme values used

Adjusting the Period of the Curves
The period of a trig function is how long it takes for the function to move through all its
values and start all over again. The period for both the sine and cosine functions is 2π. 
The sine function starts at 0 when x = 0, goes up to 1 when x = 90 degrees or π
2 , goes 
back down to 0 at x = π, goes down further to –1 at x = π
2
3 , and comes back up to 0 at
x = 2π. Then it starts all over again.
If you’re going to use the sine and cosine functions to model what goes on in real
life — such as the temperatures during the day — you need a period that’s longer than
2π (about 6.28). You need the sine curve to have a period of 24 for the hours in a day.
The period of the sine and cosine can be changed by putting a coefficient or multiplier
on the angle variable. For instance, the graph of y = sin 2x has a period of just π, and 
the graph of 
cos
y
x
3
1
=
has a period of 6π. You determine the period by dividing 2π
(the normal period) by the coefficient.
Q.
Determine the period and graph y = sin 2x.

The period is π, because when you divide 
2π by 2, π

. When the equations are written in this form, you can determine
the amplitude, period, shift left or right, and shift up or down. A represents the ampli-
tude; B is the value you divide 2π by to get the period. (For more on either of these,
refer to “Graphing the Basic Sine and Cosine Curves,” earlier in this chapter.) C helps
you find out how far to the left or right you shift the graph. You first divide the C by B,
and then you shift that much to the left if it’s positive and to the right if it’s negative. D
is the shift up or down — positive is that much up, and negative is that much down.
Q.
Use the standard equation to graph 
y = 4 sin (2x – π) + 3.
A.
Whew! This one is packed full of adjust-
ments. The amplitude is 4. The graph will
go 4 units above and below the average or
middle value, which is 3. Where did the 3
come from? That’s the shift up, denoted by
the 3 added at the end. The period is π,
because you divide the usual 2π by 2. You
get twice as much graph as there usually is 
in that interval. The shift is π
2 to the right, 
dividing the π by 2. The figure shows what
it looks like, all put together. Notice that
I’ve put in y = 3, to show you the middle or
average value.

Applying the Sine and Cosine Curves to Life
I keep talking about how the sine and cosine curves can model what goes on in real
life. Now’s the time to come through and show you an example.
Q.
The temperature in a refrigerator doesn’t
stay the same — even when you keep the
door closed. The compressor comes on to
cool it down, whenever the temperature
gets too high inside. Here’s a sine curve
that models the temperature in a particular
refrigerator: y = 2.6 sin (0.1x – 0.5) + 35,
where the temperature is in degrees
Fahrenheit, and x is the number of minutes.
What is the average temperature? How
high does it rise, and how low does the
temperature fall? How often does the 
compressor work?
A.
First, look at the graph of this model,
shown in the figure. This graph shows you
how the temperature stays within a certain
range — between 37.6 degrees and 32.4
degrees — the high and low. How do you
get that range? The average temperature
is 35 degrees. So you add and subtract the
amplitude, 2.6, from that average to get the
high and the low. The amount of time it
takes to go through a complete cycle is its
period. And the period is found by dividing
2π by 0.1, which comes out to be about
62.8 minutes — a little over one hour. The
shift to the right is 5 minutes (divide 0.5
by 0.1), which means that the cycle starts
5 minutes after the beginning of the hour.

particular city can be modeled by 
H = 2.5sin (0.02x – 1.28) +12, where H is
the number of hours and x is the number
of days since January 1. What is the aver-
age number of hours of daylight? What is
the most daylight and the least? What is
the period (how long is this cycle)?

22. The time that the sun rises can be modeled
by T = 40sin (0.524x + 1.53) + 1.75 where
T is the number of minutes before or after
6 am, and x is the month (January = 1,
February = 2, and so on). To use this, if 
T = –3, that corresponds to 3 minutes before
6 a.m. or 5:57 a.m. On average, what time
does the sun rise? What is the earliest and
latest that it rises? How long is this cycle?

The number of hours of daylight in a particular city can be modeled by H = 2.5sin (0.02x – 1.28) + 12,
where H is the number of hours and x is the number of days since January 1. What is the aver-
age number of hours of daylight? What is the most daylight and the least? What is the period
(how long is this cycle)? The average number of hours of daylight is 12. The most daylight is
14.5 hours, and the least daylight is 9.5 hours. The period is about 314 days.
The average number of hours is 12; that comes from the 12 at the end of the equation. The
most daylight is 12 + 2.5 = 14.5, and the least amount is 12 – 2.5 = 9.5. You get the period by
dividing 2π by 0.02, to arrive at about 314.
v
The time that the sun rises can be modeled by T = 40sin (0.524x + 1.53) + 1.75 where T is the
number of minutes before or after 6 am, and x is the month (January = 1, February = 2, and so
on). To use this, if T = –3, that corresponds to 3 minutes before 6 a.m. or 5:57 a.m. On average,
what time does the sun rise? What is the earliest and latest that it rises? How long is this cycle?
On average, the sun rises at about 6:02 a.m. The earliest it rises is 5:22 a.m., and the latest it
rises is 6:42 a.m. The cycle is 12 months.
You get the average sunrise by adding 1.75 minutes to 6 a.m., to get about 6:02 a.m. The earliest
it rises is 40 minutes before the average, or 5:22 a.m. The latest is 40 minutes after the average,
or 6:42 a.m. The cycle is determined by dividing 2π by 0.524.

The sale of a particular brand of soccer shoe is seasonal. The sales, in millions of dollars, can
be modeled by M = 2.4sin (0.524x – 0.942) + 3.3, where x is the month of the year. What are the
highest and lowest levels of sales? What is the average? The highest level of sale is $5.7 mil-
lion, and the lowest level is $900,000 (or $0.9 million). The average is $3.3 million.
To get the amount of the highest level, add 3.3 + 2.4. This is the average value plus the ampli-
tude. The average value is that constant amount at the end of the equation.
x
The average daily temperature in a Midwestern city can be found with T = 26sin (0.017x – 1.9) + 48,
where T is in degrees Fahrenheit, and x is the day of the year (January 1 = 1, February = 2, and
so on). What is the highest average temperature? What is the lowest average temperature?
What is the length of this cycle? The highest average temperature is 74 degrees, and the
lowest is 22 degrees. The length of this cycle is about 370 days.
You get the high by adding 48 + 26, the average temperature of 48 plus the amplitude of 26; the
lowest value is 48 – 26. Then, to get the length of the cycle, divide 2π by 0.017.

from left to right, while the other moves downward, and that they have different intercepts.
Graphing these curves just takes knowing how to recognize these two characteristics and
then fitting the graphs to them.
Establishing Vertical Asymptotes
The tangent and cotangent functions are not defined for all real numbers. Each can be writ-
ten as a ratio (a fraction) of the sine and cosine. Because of this, when the sine or cosine is
equal to zero and in the denominator of that ratio, an undefined value occurs. The way this is
shown in the graph of the function is to sketch in a vertical asymptote. A vertical asymptote
isn’t a part of any graph. It’s a line that’s drawn in with dots or dashes to show where it is but
indicate that it’s just there for help in drawing. Asymptotes, in general, help with the shape of
a curve when you’re drawing it in.
The vertical asymptotes for y = tan x occur when the cosine is equal to 0. That occurs 
when x
kπ
2
=
; k is some odd integer. This means that they occur for any odd multiple of π
2 . 
The vertical asymptotes for y = cot x occur when the sine is equal to 0. That happens when
x = kπ, or any multiple of π. Figure 16-1 shows what the asymptotes look like.

Graphing Tangent and Cotangent
The graphs of the tangent and cotangent function are essentially flattened-out curves
that fit between the vertical asymptotes. The graph of the tangent function moves
upward as you move from left to right. It crosses the x-axis halfway between the
asymptotes. The same curve keeps repeating over and over. The graph of the cotangent
function moves downward as you move from left to right. It also crosses the x-axis
halfway between its asymptotes. In Figures 16-2 and 16-3, I’ve drawn in one piece of the
graph of each. You get to draw in more of the graphs in the exercises in this section.

Altering the Basic Curves
The graphs of the tangent and cotangent can be changed in many ways — most of which
are covered in Chapter 18. For this section, though, I concentrate on the ways that the
functions can be changed — and their graphs can be changed — that make the graphs 
appear to be the same (have equal values). Identities such as sin

m means to move the graph of the sine to the left by π
2 units. Adding 
or subtracting values from the variable in tangent and cotangent curves has the same
effect.
Q.
Graph y = tan (x + π). What function has the
same graph?
A.
It’s the same as y = tan x. Moving the graph
π units to the left results in the asymptotes
falling onto one another and the intercepts
lying on top of one another. It’s the same
graph. You can see this in the figure.

he secant and cosecant functions are reciprocals of the cosine and sine functions,
respectively. Their graphs don’t look anything like their reciprocals, but the graphs of
the sine and cosine are very helpful when doing the graphing of the cosecant and secant.
There are asymptotes to consider in these graphs, as with the tangent and cotangent. But
there are no x-intercepts to help with the graphing.
Determining the Vertical Asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes (sort of “ghost” lines that help with graphing) indicate where the function
isn’t defined. They’re lines drawn in to help when sketching the graph of a curve. The verti-
cal asymptotes for the cosecant occur when the sine function is equal to 0. The cosecant is
the reciprocal of the sine, putting the sine in the denominator of the equivalence. You can’t
have a 0 in the denominator. The sine is 0 for all multiples of π, so that’s where the vertical
asymptotes of the cosecant are: x = kπ (where k is any integer).
The vertical asymptotes for the secant occur where the cosine is equal to 0. Their equations 
are: x
kπ
2
=
, where k is an odd integer.

Graphing Cosecant and Secant
Graphing the cosecant and secant functions is a two-step process. First, sketch in
the asymptotes for the function, and then lightly sketch in the reciprocal function for
whichever you’re graphing. The extreme values of the reciprocal functions will be the
tops and bottoms of the curves you draw in for secant and cosecant.
Q.
Sketch the graph of y = sec x between 
x = 2π and x = 4π.

The top figure shows the final answer
for this graph. Look at the bottom figure
for the steps needed to sketch the graph.
Showing the first two steps, the graph on
the left in the bottom figure shows the

graph in the middle shows the cosine func-
tion sketched in lightly between those
asymptotes. The final step is the graph
of the secant, shown on the right, drawn
down to the cosine or up to the cosine
between the asymptotes.

Making Changes to the Graphs 
of Cosecant and Secant
The graphs of the cosecant and secant functions look very much alike. The things that
make them different from one another are where the asymptotes and extreme points
are. Just as there are identities and shifts that can change from sine to cosine or vice
versa, the same type of changing can be done with the cosecant and secant.

Analyzing the Graphs of

corresponding inverses and ranges that consist of angle measures that come from
two of the four quadrants. For instance, y

Sin
1
=
-
has input values between –1 and 1,
including –1 and 1, because those are the values that y = sin x produces. The output
values of this inverse function are angles from Quadrant I and Quadrant IV. There’s
only one output for each input — as is befitting a function. The graphs of the inverse
trig functions are pretty stunted. They don’t go on and on as their counterparts —
their inverses — do.

Transforming Graphs of Trig Functions

 Sliding graphs all over the place
 Reflecting over axes

A
ll sorts of transformations can be performed on the graphs of functions. In Chapter 15,
you can read about how to make the graphs of sine and cosine slide all over the place
or get taller. In Chapters 16 and 17, you can see how a phase change (changing the starting
place) can happen when numbers are added to the angle variable. In this chapter, all the
possible transformations that are performed on all the trig functions are put into one, neat
package and related to the functions in general. Also, you’ll see what happens when a for-
eign function is introduced — when a polynomial is added to a trig function.
Sliding the Graphs Left or Right
The function transformation called a slide or translation moves a function around the coordi-
nate axes without changing the shape. It can change where the function has intercepts or
where it starts its cycle (in the case of these trig functions). The transformations that slide the
functions left have the form f (x + k) and those that slide the functions to the right have the
form f (x – k), where k is some positive value and f is whatever function is being transformed.

Sliding the Graphs Up or Down
The previous section shows you the translations or slides that move a function to the
left or right. The other type of slide moves the graph up or down. The transformations
that slide the functions up have the form f (x ) + k, and those that slide the functions
down have the form f (x ) – k, where k is some positive value. The best way to graph
these — or to determine that the transformation has occurred — is to look for a spe-
cial or identifiable place on the graph. In the case of the tangent and cotangent, look
for where that flattening-out place is. Has it moved up or down? And, in the case of the
cosecant and secant, look for the tops and bottoms of the curves. Where are they
now? The upward and downward movements of the sine and cosine functions are dis-
cussed in Chapter 15, if you need to refer to them.

Part IV: Graphing the Trigonometric Functions 
Changing the Steepness
The steepness, or slope, of a function is changed by multiplying the function by a
number. Multiplying by a number greater than 1 (or less than –1) makes the curve
steeper — it rises or falls more quickly. Multiplying by some proper fraction (a number
between –1 and 1) makes the curve rise or fall more slowly — it’s flatter. And, of
course, you never multiply by 0. That gives you nothing at all. The amplitude of the
sine and cosine curves is covered in Chapter 15. The amplitude is a multiplier, too, and
has the same effect on sine and cosine as the multiplier does on the curves shown in
this section.
Q.
Sketch the graph of y = 6tan x.
A.
Multiplying by 6 makes the function values
six times as great. Instead of having a tan-
gent equaling 1 unit at 45 degrees, it’s now
6 units. As the numbers you multiply by get
larger, the curve gets steeper and looks
less like a tangent (see the figure).

Reflecting on the Situation — Horizontally
Another transformation that can be performed on functions is reflecting them over the
x-axis or some other horizontal line. When you see a negative sign in front of the func-
tion rule, as in y = –f(x), every y value that was positive becomes negative and vice
versa. When you see a negative sign in a rule such as y = –f(x)+k, the reflection is over
the line y = k. Graphically, the graph looks like a mirror image above and below the line
it’s reflecting over.
Q.
What is the function rule for the graph in

This is a graph of y = –tan x. The graph of

Reflecting on Your Position — Vertically
There are two types of reflections in the world of transformations. Reflections over a
horizontal line are covered in the preceding section. The others, covered here, are
reflections over a vertical line — most often the y-axis. The function equation for these
transformations has the variable for the angle negated. You’ll see f (–x). Everything
switches sides from left to right and right to left. The functions that are already symmet-
ric with respect to the y-axis (they’re a mirror image on either side) can be reflected,
but you’ll never know it; they reflect back on themselves.

Transformations can be performed on functions that raise, lower, shift left, shift right,

chapter. For the most part, in those earlier sections, only one transformation has been
applied each time. In this section, I show you how two or more transformations can
affect the function.

This graph is really loaded. It’s flatter,
because of the fraction multiplier. It’s
flipped over the line y = 1, because of the
negative in front of the 1⁄3 and the added 1. 
And it’s shifted to the right by π
2 units. The 
figure shows you the end result.

Combining Trig Functions with Polynomials
Some of the prettiest (beauty is in the eye of the beholder) graphs are achieved when
you combine two different trig functions or a trig function and a polynomial together.
Graphing calculators come in handy here, but you can also do a good job of combining
these functions by just doing the math yourself and plotting the points.
Q.
Sketch the graph of y = x + cos x.
A.
This would make a wonderful bunny slope
for some skiers (see the figure). But, it’s
also a wonderful curve to graph. You start
by finding some points and then connect-
ing them. Make a chart with the x-values,
the values of cos x, and then the sum of
those two (see the chart). The radian
measures are changed to decimals for the
addition. You don’t get a feel for the
smoothness without trying some points
in between the points in the chart, but
the rises and plateaus are completely pre-
dictable with the cosine function having
those values between –1 and 1.

Its function equation is y = csc x – 1.

Sketch the graph of y = 4cot x. See the following figure.
This is much steeper than y = cot x. The multiplier of 4 is what makes it steeper. Notice, though,
that the intercepts are the same. That’s because 0 times 4 is still 0. The asymptotes stay the
same, too.

Sketch the graph of y = 3sec x + 2. See the following figure.
There are two factors seeming to operate against one another here. Multiplying by 3 makes the
lower part of the upper curve come down to 3 and the upper part of the lower curve come up
to –3. But then, adding 2 and raising the whole thing by 2 units makes the lower part seem to
come back up where it belongs. There is a new steepness to the curve. The multiplier of 3 does
make it steeper.

Ten Identities with a Negative Attitude
In This Chapter
 Soothing negative angle identities
 Complementing and supplementing angles
 Factoring in some positive approaches
 Changing the demeanor of angles
T
here are oh-so-many identities. In Part III of this book, you find the most commonly used
identities and see how they can be used to simplify trig expressions and solve trig equa-
tions. Here I list ten identities, three of which you may recognize, and the others of which
crop up in graphing and simplifying situations.
Negative Angle Identities
There are three negative angle identities that tell you what the function of a negative angle is
with respect to the corresponding positive angle. For example, if you want to find the sine of
an angle of –45 degrees, you can find it by just negating the sine of a 45 degree angle that’s
positive. Here are the identities:

Complementing and Supplementing Identities
This next grouping of identities relates the complement of an angle (complementary angles
add up to 90 degrees) and relates it to a supplement of an angle (supplements add up to
180 degrees). Complements are very important in right-triangle trig, because the two acute
angles in a right triangle are always complementary. The supplements are great when dealing
with angles that lie along the same straight line.

Doing Fancy Factoring with Identities
The Pythagorean identities do a pretty good job of covering all the different ways that
those equations can be written and substituted in and used in solving equations. These
last identities take the difference between the squares of sine and cosine functions and,
instead of factoring, relate them to some sum and difference identities.

Ten Formulas to Use in a Circle
In This Chapter
 Finding your way around a circle
 Sectioning off the area of a circle
 Inscribing and circumscribing a circle
T
he circle is one of the most familiar and useful objects. Even young children who haven’t
been to school know how to form a circle around a playmate or run around in circles.
The different formulas and properties that I list here may make it even more interesting and
useful to you. Some of these formulas are probably familiar; many are probably not.
Running Around in Circles
The circumference, or distance around the outside of a circle can be found if you know the
radius (distance from the center to the circle) or the diameter (distance across the circle
through the center). To find the circumference, C
r
d
π
π
2
=
=
where C is the circumference,
π is about 3.14, r is the radius, and d is the diameter.
Adding Up the Area
The area of a circle can be found if you have the radius of the circle. A
r
π
2
=
where A is the
area, π is about 3.14, and r is the radius.
Defeating an Arc Rival
An arc is a piece of a circle. It’s usually measured by the angle formed between two radii of
the circle and is how much of the circle is cut off. In Figure 20-1, the arc AB is a part of the
whole circle. The angle that’s cut off is Θ.
A
B
θ
Figure 20-1:
Arc AB on
the circle.

To find the length of the arc, use the formula s
r
π
180
=
i when Θ is in degrees and s
r
= i
when Θ is in radians. The letter s is the arc length and r is the radius of the circle.
Sectioning Off the Sector
The sector of a circle is a like a piece of a round pie. It’s sandwiched between two radii
of the circle. You can find the area of a sector if you know the angle of the circle that’s
being cut off and the radius of the circle. Figure 20-2 is a picture of a sector.
To find the area of the sector, use A
r
π

=
i if Θ is in degrees and A
sr
r

2
=
=
i if Θ is in 
radians. The r is for the radius, and s is the arc length.
Striking a Chord
A chord of a circle is a segment that’s drawn from one point on the circle to another
point on the circle. The longest chord is the diameter. You can quickly find this length if
you know the radius of the circle and the measure of the angle that’s formed from the
radii touching the two ends of the chord. Look at the picture of the chord in Figure 20-3.
The length of the chord is found with the formula 
sin
r
2

i , where r is the radius and Θ
is the angle between the two radii.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Ringing True
A ring in a circle is the area sandwiched between the circle and another circle drawn
inside that has the same center. To find the area of a ring, you just need to know the
radii of the two circles. Figure 20-4 shows a circle with a ring drawn inside.
The area of a ring is found with A
R

h, where R is the radius of the
big circle, and r is the radius of the circle inside it. If you do a little algebra to this 
equation — multiply the two binomials together and distribute the π — you see that
it’s the area of the small circle subtracted from the area of the large circle. This for-
mula is just a little more convenient.
Inscribing and Radii
A circle can be inscribed in a triangle. This means that the circle touches each side of
the triangle it’s in. You can see how that can happen in Figure 20-5. A nice thing is that
you can find the radius of the circle that’s inscribed inside if you know the lengths of
the sides of the triangle.

Circumscribing and Radii
A circle can also circumscribe a triangle. A circle can be drawn through all three vertices
of any triangle (see Figure 20-6). The radius of that circle can be found if you know the
lengths of the sides of the triangle.

Righting a Triangle
If you draw a triangle inside a semicircle (half a circle) where one side of the triangle
is the diameter, some wonderful things can happen. The triangle has a vertex at any
point on the semicircle, and two endpoints of the diameter are the other two vertices.
Look at Figure 20-7 for examples.
In every case, the triangle that’s drawn in the semicircle is a right triangle. The angle
that has its vertex on the circle is a right angle. This is true because the angle (the right
angle) cuts off an arc of 180 degrees, or half the circle. An inscribed angle (one that has
its vertex on the circle) is always half the measure of the angle it cuts off.
Inscribing a Polygon
A polygon is a figure made up of a bunch of segments that are connected from endpoint
to endpoint. A regular polygon is a polygon that has all those sides or segments equal in
length. When a regular polygon is inscribed inside a circle, you can find the perimeter
and area of the polygon, as long as you know the radius of the circle. 
To find the perimeter of the polygon, use 
sin
P
nr
nπ

the number of sides, and r is the radius of circle. To find the area of the polygon, use

Ten Ways to Relate the Sides
and Angles of Any Triangle
In This Chapter
 Putting sides and angles in ratios
 Being radical with the sides
 Using trig functions in relations
T
he sides and angles of any triangle are related to one another in many ways. The longest
side of a triangle is always opposite the largest angle, and the smallest side is opposite
the smallest angle. The Law of Sines and Law of Cosines show some other relationships, but
here are some you may not have seen before.
The sides of these triangles are labeled with lowercase letters, and the angles opposite them
have corresponding uppercase letters. For simplicity, they’ll all be for triangle ABC, shown in
Figure 21-1.

Hatching a Little Heron
Heron’s rule for finding the area of a triangle (see Chapter 14) uses the semiperimeter
(half the perimeter) and the square root of a product. You can see some of Heron’s rule
in this relation. The s stands for the semiperimeter.

he values for trig functions come in handy when solving problems, sketching graphs, or
doing any number of computations involving trig. The values here are all rounded to
three decimal places; if you need more decimal places than that, you can use a scientific 
calculator. If you need values for angles larger than 90 degrees, check out Chapters 3 and 8
to see how to use coterminal and reference angles. If you need radians instead of degrees,
