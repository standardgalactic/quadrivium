Foreword
The Security Operations Center (the SOC for short), for those companies who have 
the means to operate their own cyber security organization, is a required central 
nervous system – a place where all of the sensors, security devices, and personnel  
report back; the location from which the networks are fought during times of crisis, 
and the location from which routine day-to-day operations are carried out, standing 
vigil.
In the past twenty years, I’ve been involved in the building of several intelligence 
and analysis or security operations programs. As technical controller and communi-
cations watch officer as a young enlisted man to building the early cyber intelligence 
and analysis center for the Navy’s Fleet Information Warfare Center, to Cisco, and as 
the Director of the DoD/Defense Industrial Base’s Collaborative Information Shar-
ing Environment, I watched dozens of operations mature, from intelligence consum-
er to intelligence producer; from immature ad hoc security operations to integrated 
and automated processes.
Upon the realization that a company has a security issue (…often times when 
they decide to build a SOC), many of the companies have one or two security people; 
maybe they have a Chief Information Security Officer. In every case, that small team – 
if they exist –will fight an incident manually. They’ll operate as individuals with 
little or no coordination, and when that first incident is over, and they realize that 
there was more at play than a simple hacker with a simple tool, and likely the entire 
network has been compromised… this is when the C-Suite steps in. In many cases, 
this is when the company builds a security program; and in nearly every instance, 
they start with a security operations program.
When it comes to building security operations, there are a thousand directions 
one can go, and with every choice comes risk. Add to that risk the fact that the se-
curity landscape changes, seemingly minute by minute, and the need for ensuring 
that consistent, reliable security operations are properly configured, staffed, and 
trained becomes more important with every passing event.
In today’s world, when breaches translate to dollars on the balance sheet and 
cyber claims are fought every step of the way, being prepared becomes an im-
perative. And one of the most important items in the Security Officers toolkit is a 
security operations center. This is the spinal cord at which every nerve terminates, 
sending signals back and forth to the brain –the CISO. If the spinal cord or any 
of the nerves feeding it are not operating at peak, the brain receives bad signals 
and makes an incorrect decision. The Security Operations Center must be able to 
perform three tasks to operate successfully during an intrusion: Identify those suc-
cessful attacks that are currently operating in the environment, while maintaining 
day-to-day operations, and while creating strategy for successfully operating with 
now, untrusted networks into the future.

DEFINING AN OPERATIONS CENTER
Normally, the term “operations center” conjures the image of a NASA-like environ-
ment where people are sitting at desks arranged in a semi-circle with an operator at 
a computer facing a large wall of video monitors and projectors broadcasting critical 
information. That is the general conception of a standard operations center. Many 
types of operation centers exist, all of which have the same general purpose: a variety

CHAPTER 1  Efficient operations
of tasks to be performed by a group of people who interact with the data/information 
and with each other.
A network operations center (NOC), for example, will have someone focused 
on telephony or communications equipment or messaging and may even be more 
focused, stove-piped, on instant messaging or telephone communications. Someone 
else may be fully focused on web services, Internet access, and connectivity. Each 
will have different skill sets, but will operate in the same room because, many times, 
they need each other. A lot of the information each handles is interconnected with 
the other, so they will be focused on their own tasks day in and day out but will work 
together in a group operations environment. There are clear escalation paths, a clear 
management chain, and there is information being broadcast to them to help them do 
their jobs better and more efficiently, or provide them information very quickly that 
enables them to spot a problem or be able to resolve a problem before it becomes a 
larger more impacting issue.
That is a rough overview of a traditional operations center. There also might be 
other types of operations centers, such as a security operations center (SOC). The 
concept is the same and the focus is different, this time on system security. Another 
type may be something like an emergency operations center (EOC), which may not 
be stood up full time and actively providing services, it may not look like a NASA 
site, but rather be set up virtually or in response to a crisis. It may not have the fancy 
monitors nor semi-circle arranged desks, but it will have different people with differ-
ent skill sets who come together to respond to a crisis, make decisions, assess dam-
age, manage the crisis, and be able to do all of this in real time in a temporary tent. 
Once the crisis has ended, that particular type of operations center may just go away 
and its participants return to their regular jobs, only to be recalled if there is another 
emergency that needs to be attended to.
You can spend years and tons of money building the best security for your in-
frastructure, hire the best security people, and provide them with the best tools, and 
you still will not be able to guarantee that security breaches or compromise of your 
systems will not happen. When computer security issues do occur, it is critical for 
an organization to have an effective means of managing and responding to them. 
The speed with which an organization recognizes or detects, analyzes, prevents, or 
responds to an incident will limit damage done and lower the cost of recovery.
Having an effective and efficient SOC or incident response capability is an im-
portant part of the deployment and implementation of any technical infrastructure. 
With the number of breaches and amount of data loss over the past few years, orga-
nizations are beginning to realize that security is a key component to any business 
operation.
In direct support of the business and partnered with information technology (IT) 
services or operational technology services, a SOC must reduce both the duration 
and impact of security-related incidents exploiting, denying, degrading, disrupting, 
or destroying systems required for normal business operations. This needs to be done 
through effective monitoring—timely and alerting—and consistent tracking of inci-
dent progress. The SOC should be a vehicle where the customer or internal business 

3
﻿ Purpose of the operations center
partner is represented with respect to incident prevention, and is a proponent and ex-
ecutor of proactive remediation’s and communications. A SOC needs to maintain an 
effective staffing level appropriate to the size of the business and the responsibilities 
given, with continual training and improvement, and should always able to respond 
effectively and efficiently.
PURPOSE OF THE OPERATIONS CENTER
In essence, the operations center is to be whatever the goal is for the particular 
focus. Thus, you may choose to have an operation center running 24/7, or one that is  
operating only from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. You may find it beneficial to have an opera-
tions center that is a NASA lookalike, or a center consisting individuals sitting in 
normal cubicles as one would see in any office situation. This latter group still works 
together as a “center” team. The key is a synergy among the different people, even 
though performing different tasks. Whatever physical format is employed, there is 
clear management to handle particular events, make decisions, bring situations to 
resolution, and provide a service to the larger business or organization.
A SOC has a key, albeit sounding simple, mission: security. The overall concept 
of having a SOC is to provide a real-time view into a network or an organization’s 
security status, assuring that systems are not being negatively affected and has the 
ability to execute agreed upon protocols and processes in a consistent manner when 
issues arise as well as someone keeping an eye on the facilities at all times. This is 
similar in concept to physical security, where guards walk the premises to be certain 
that everything is in the right place and no thieves are about, no one is attempting to 
break in, and there are no other issues that threaten the security of the facility. The 
only, and obvious, difference is that the SOC does not monitor in the physical world 
so the operators cannot shine a flashlight into a corner to see if anyone is hiding there. 
The SOC requires a very different skill set.
Although there are varying degrees of SOCs, generally they are charged with 
the responsibility of monitoring and managing all aspects of the enterprise, in real 
time. Varying degrees of a SOC, with different facility types, depends on your or-
ganization and your objectives. The typical approach is a centralized entity in an 
organization or business where all necessary skill sets in the security-focused area 
are working together in one location, but everything in one location is not a require-
ment. Larger companies with a global footprint may have skill sets in Europe that 
are different from the skills available in the Pacific Rim that are also different from 
those in the United States. In such instances, you would leverage those abilities, split 
the work among the key areas, and establish a global SOC. Then, you would need 
to figure out how to build that together and make components work effectively and 
keep all eyes on the network to protect the company.
Size of the organization and threat to the organization can drive the size and look 
of the SOC. Throughout this volume, we discuss what you need to consider when 
designing a SOC, as well as some of the challenges you will have in making correct 

4
CHAPTER 1  Efficient operations
decisions and some of the thought processes needed in order to get to the proper 
result. No matter what the configuration, ultimately the SOC monitors and manages 
potential threats, analyzes the threats, determines risk level, and then either recom-
mends or executes some form of remediation action to protect the company. How 
you go about doing all this needs to be effective, efficient, and measurable.
Somewhat of a “Nervous system” is fabricated when you build out a SOC. There 
is an intelligent “brain” that essentially works to gather data from all different areas. 
There is an automated process that attempts to prioritize events so that the more criti-
cal issues are dealt with by the trained experts and remediated in priority order. Need-
ed are the proper tools, equipment, and people. Not unlike elsewhere in the industry, 
we refer to the three-legged stool of people, process, and technology. Most books on 
IT and security tell you that you need to focus on those three things. I tell you that is 
not true. You must have people and you must have processes. You do not, however, 
necessarily need to have technology. While it is true that you need to have all three, 
the reality is that it is your people who make your operation work and make it success-
ful. The people will implement the proper processes. It is your people who will imple-
ment the technology correctly to achieve the goals. So, when building a good SOC, 
your focus primarily needs to be on people, and the remainder will fall into line. In 
subsequent chapters, we will get into very detailed presentations about how we focus 
on our people to be successful as the “brain” of the nervous system within the SOC.
When completed, the SOC will provide you situational awareness from a security 
perspective. It will give you a detailed picture of what is occurring in your enterprise 
from that same perspective. It will leverage the tools you have deployed specifically 
for security, and even other tools that were not deployed for security but have secu-
rity value. A SOC does not need to be an entity of its own. I argue that a SOC can-
not operate all on its own. It needs to have partners to be successful. In many larger 
organizations, a successful SOC is working alongside an NOC. Or, if a NOC is not 
present, the SOC will create partnerships with other IT units within the enterprise.
It is one thing to stay focused within a SOC and make certain nothing bad is hap-
pening on the network; but, you also must make certain when building a SOC—any 
type of operation center, but even more so for a SOC—that you are a partner to the 
business, to the IT coworkers, and you need to be certain you extend outside of your 
operations center to enlist support of all your users to be additional eyes and ears 
relative to what is going on within the network. Certainly not an empty statement, it 
is everyone’s responsibility when it comes to security.
EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER
An EOC is the physical location where people come together during an emergency 
but it does not specifically have to be anything relating to IT security. This could 
be for almost anything such as a natural disaster, or even civil unrest. These centers 
alternatively may be called command centers, situation rooms, war rooms, crisis 
management centers, or other similar terms. This is where the coordination of in-
formation and resources takes place to respond to and perform recovery actions. As 

5
﻿ Network operations center
with other types of operation centers, it should be an effective and efficient facility 
for coordinating emergency response efforts. An EOC may be made up of a number 
of people from different organizations, such as state or federal emergency workers, 
and the users may have various types of skills and training.
MISSION OPERATIONS CENTER
The more typical NASA environment, a mission operations center (MOC) is a place 
where many people of different skills and focus sets come together for a single purpose 
or event. A space shuttle launch is a good example. All aspects of the launch would 
be represented by people in the operation center who have their own sets of priorities, 
focus, and tools vital to the overall mission. The operation center comes together for 
a single planned event and then either be would disbanded or left with only core crew 
positions to maintain ongoing operations. Air Traffic Control centers are a type of 
permanent MOC and similar organizations may be seen in larger busy train stations.
THREAT OPERATIONS CENTER
This type of operation center primarily is focused on threats, characterization, and 
attribution of those threats, creation, and sharing of situational awareness, and the 
development of mitigation strategies. Its primary focus could be in intelligence gath-
ering and the dissemination of that information to the proper groups and teams that 
can do the most with it. The mission is to perform in-depth analysis using specific 
technology and techniques that would be proprietary to the organization. This could 
include identifying vulnerabilities and the potential for attacks; discovering methods 
of protecting global networks, computer systems, specific hardware or software; or 
specifically looking for threats to a business or organization. A good example of this 
may be the NSA’s threat operations center (TOC) that has a very specific mission 
to discover cyber threats, characterize them and find attribution of those threats, in 
addition they publish information for other government organizations to use and 
review. Managed Security Providers may also build TOCs either as a standalone 
organization or within a SOC to help feed security relevant information back into the 
SOC for enhancing and developing rules and signature to be implemented into se-
curity infrastructure in order to better protect their customers. A larger organization 
or enterprise can also build a TOC specifically designed to research threats, fraud, or 
other potential risks to the business.
NETWORK OPERATIONS CENTER
NOCs are responsible for monitoring IT infrastructure for alarms or certain condi-
tions that may require special attention to avoid failure in a business system. For 
example, a NOC may monitor hard drive space on servers to detect when critical 

6
CHAPTER 1  Efficient operations
storage may be getting low. Or it may monitor services to ensure they are available 
to the user or customer; and, when they are not available, provide remediation and 
restoral services or contact the appropriate escalation point of contacts to institute 
a repair. NOCs can analyze problems, troubleshoot, communicate with site techni-
cians, and even other NOCs such as vendor NOCs or regional NOCs, and track 
problems through resolution. They normally are able to escalate issues to the appro-
priate personnel, including contacting technicians to remedy problems not otherwise 
addressable.
Operation centers’ core functions are:
• 
Can optimize communication and coordination by effective information 
management and presentation.
• 
Example process of how information flows in an operation center:
• 
Event occurs
• 
Detection\recognition of relevant event
• 
Notification sent to front line personnel or analysts
• 
Status evaluated and action begins
• 
Incident log opened or initial comments made
• 
Standard operating procedures implemented using checklists
• 
Tasks for remediation or restoration assigned, as needed
• 
Escalation performed, as required
• 
Status briefings and updates to stakeholders
A successful operation is one where a team of people are working together to 
consistently achieve or exceed goals. In a SOC, the team’s goals are to monitor and 
protect the organization from internal and external threats as defined by security 
experts, internal IT and security leaders and the business or organization who ulti-
mately owns and funds the SOC.
LET US BUILD A SOC!
The majority of SOCs are built out of necessity, which is the nice way of saying that 
SOCs are built as a “knee jerk” reactionary response to a significant security issue 
in an organization, such as a breach or identification of data loss. This reactionary 
approach is due to the fact that even today most companies do not understand the 
current climate and risks associated with IT, or for some reason, do not believe that 
they are or would be a target. It is unfortunate that these “instant SOCs” are put to-
gether more often than not. It is disastrous because companies are not secure and are 
having issues at an alarming rate but it is also regrettable that a lot of planning cannot 
be done upfront so that the effectiveness of the SOC could turn positive results faster 
for organizations during a time of great need.
In some cases, SOCs get “stood-up” while security issues are underway and im-
mediately after a breach has been recognized. This gives a company very little in 
the way of planning or establishing an approach or following a sane methodology 

7
﻿ Let us build a SOC!
to building a SOC. It may not even allow the organization to hire the right people. 
There are times where a breach is so significant to an organization that a company 
would call in an outside company of experts to establish a SOC and staff it just to 
stop the bleeding. Or, organizations could hire a Managed Security Service Provider 
to take over their devices and start monitoring for problems. In all of these situa-
tions, everyone is going to have a very difficult time. Organizations assuredly will 
be stressed out from the issue and their heads will be spinning and not know what 
to do, and service providers, whether off site or onsite, will find it difficult to get the 
information they need to build out infrastructure to protect the organization the way 
they want. There are many different companies that provide this kind of service and 
they do a decent job, but almost every engagement begins like sticking your finger 
into an electrical socket. The reason for this is that the organizations in these critical 
situations need to rapidly work to take responsibility for security away from tradi-
tional internal IT departments and give it over to an outside organization. This hurts; 
people in IT usually are very passionate about what they do and treat networks they 
manage like their own baby and take great pride in what they do. When someone 
takes things away from them, it is a clear indication that they were not performing 
their job adequately. Additionally, further making these rapid transitions difficult is 
a usually large amount of knowledge transfer that must occur regarding technology 
configurations, such as what systems perform what function and why, organizational 
structure, geographical layout, and, of course, the current political climate and issues 
inside the organization.
Organizations do not typically include building a SOC into their growth plans un-
less they are going to offer security as part of their business. It almost goes without 
saying that there is little to no profit for a company to focus on its own security. Most, 
if not all, money spent on an organization’s effort to secure its network is considered 
capital and/or operational expense and affects the bottom line. Today, as companies 
grow, it is typical that their IT infrastructure grows as well; and as the infrastructure 
grows, the potential security issues and risk to that infrastructure and its data also 
grows. At some point, an organization needs a SOC; but, at what point can vary 
greatly and depend on many different factors. Most organizations have some kind of 
security deployed, even if it is a simple off-the-shelf router with a built-in firewall, 
but they have no SOC. While other organizations can have large IT departments that 
manage infrastructure around the world to include many different types of security 
devices and still no SOC. Clearly there is a point in time when a company should be 
looking to build a SOC and it would be between, if not including, both of the previ-
ous examples. Security should be built from the ground up in any organization, and 
the concept of building or employing a SOC should all start with an organization’s 
realization that it has something to lose, critical systems to protect that help run its 
organization, or regulations that it needs to comply with or else face consequences. 
These realizations should come with a business decision to focus on the security of 
its IT infrastructure, not after the fact when security is already a critical issue.
There are times when a company does not intend to build a SOC, but it just hap-
pens naturally. As stated before, when a company grows typically so does its IT 

8
CHAPTER 1  Efficient operations
infrastructure. When IT infrastructure grows, traditional IT organizations typically 
do a good job purchasing security tools along with that growth. I believe that the 
traditional IT departments in organizations are very capable and do think about se-
curity. Unfortunately, their focus is in other areas such as managing critical services 
like email or web. They focus on keeping the network up or performing upgrades 
to applications to support the business, and so on. The traditional IT department 
will install traditional security devices such as firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems 
(IDS), and antivirus solutions. These almost always will ensure that the basics are 
there. But having these devices alone is not enough. There needs to be daily reviews, 
care, and maintenance along with regular application of vendor updates. At some 
point, maintaining the security devices cannot be an ad-hoc job for a generalist in 
the IT department because it takes too much time, and time is not the only issue. The 
knowledge to maintain these systems and make them work to their fullest capabili-
ties requires specialized knowledge. Someone needs to become a security specialist 
and take the time to learn and then properly care for the security of an organization. 
If the expertise does not reside within an organization, then an additional employee 
may need to be hired who has some experience and can perform those responsibili-
ties. Once an organization has a single full-time resource dedicated to security, there 
essentially is a SOC in place, albeit of one person.
Whether or not you are building or employing a small SOC, large SOC, instant 
SOC, or outsourced SOC, there typically are five phases of growth and maturity that 
a SOC goes through as it is being established. These phases are loosely related to 
the five stages of team development1 but modified to fit what happens inside a SOC.
Technology > Organizational > Policy > Operational > Intelligence
TECHNOLOGY PHASE
In the technology phase, there may not be any kind of resemblance of a SOC, although 
you may intentionally or unintentionally work to establish one. Instead, what  
you have is a bunch of security systems and tools that may or may not be deployed 
in an organization’s environment. In this beginning or first stage, there may be one 
or more people in an IT organization who’s responsibility is to control and manage 
all of the technology. The starting efforts are likely to be very rudimentary, such as 
just trying to figure out what tools are deployed, how many, and where. The focus in 
this phase is more of just trying to understand the area of responsibility. For example, 
maybe IDSs and antivirus management but not firewalls are part of the scope for 
the new security team. As you further look to see what you have protecting your 
organization with, this is where new equipment will begin to be installed to meet the 
needs of the organization. This is not the only phase for new installations of security 
technology, but this is where it will begin. In the case of instant SOCs, it is typical

﻿ Policy phase
that new technology will be installed specifically to address any issues or vulner-
abilities that were detected as being the cause or significant contributor to a breach 
or data loss.
ORGANIZATIONAL PHASE
In this phase, most if not all of the basic security equipment under management and 
utilized by the organization is already known to the security organization. Respon-
sibility for the security equipment is handed over or in the process of being handed 
over to one or more people heading up the security operations team. At this point, 
security operations personnel start to make sure that systems are in good health. 
This is also the phase where initial training on the security tools should take place if  
individuals are not fully qualified or experienced enough to manage the systems.  
It is really important during this phase that processes begin to be developed to manage 
and maintain systems to keep them up to date. Also, processes to modify and change 
the systems need to be established into some form of documented change manage-
ment approach. The organizational phase could be a very troubling thing for an or-
ganization to go through. There can typically be a lot of struggles for a new security 
organization to gain control over equipment typically maintain by a traditional IT 
department such as firewalls or corporate web proxies. These types of changes can 
bring out a lot of emotion in people as sometimes people feel as though they are los-
ing responsibility and giving it up to a new emerging empire in the organization. In-
stead I urge anyone building a new security organization to ensure they partner with 
all aspects of the IT department and gain strength and support from within the overall 
organization. Organizing a SOC should be a positive event in an organization and 
everyone should feel as they are part of the solution. When organizing your SOC, it 
is not always good to bring everything in new, make sure you work with, engage and 
include resources from other departments inside your organization.
POLICY PHASE
Policy in this section is really two different things. First is a review of existing policy 
related to IT security of the organization that is standing up the SOC. Most organi-
zations have at least some policies that govern the control and acceptable use of IT 
systems such as computer use and the use of the Internet. If complete IT security 
policies have not been created, then this is a good time not only to create the policies 
but get them approved by senior management and then communicated around the 
company. There are many examples of polices available for view that you can use as 
examples, and many companies even in your industry may be willing to share their 
policies with you so you can draft ones that are the best for your organization. I do 
not want to get into published standards and guidelines too much, but if you need to 
start from scratch, ISO/IEC 27002 is a good beginning point from which to establish 

10
CHAPTER 1  Efficient operations
basic guidelines and general principles for initiating, implementing, maintaining, 
and improving information security management in your organization. The standard 
provides general guidance on the commonly accepted goals of information secu-
rity management and contains best practices. It is intended as a functional guideline 
for developing organizational security standards and effective security management 
practices. The SOC should not perform this task alone, but could be a great help in 
developing these policies. The policies should be reviewed carefully and then all the 
deployed security tools and future security purchases need to be evaluated to ensure 
that they are enforcing those policies as best as possible. Second, this is when the 
SOC really starts to develop internal policy as how it controls and governs the con-
figurations of the devices it is now managing. Modifications are made to ensure the 
devices are in alignment with policy and doing the job expected of them.
One of the primary policies and procedures that need to be developed in this 
phase is communication. A SOC needs to make sure that information system security 
incidents are promptly reported, system security events and weaknesses are promptly 
communicated to the appropriate system administrators, and timely corrective ac-
tions are taken. Additionally, the SOC must establish a formal information security 
event reporting procedure with proper points of contact so it can perform incident 
response effectively.
OPERATIONAL PHASE
This is where it all starts to come together and the SOC begins to operate, systems 
are configured properly and tested to be working well. Regular monitoring of the 
security systems is occurring and investigations are taking place to understand activ-
ity that is out of the ordinary or in violation of established policies. IDSs signatures 
are updated regularly, systems are properly maintained, and any vendor updates are 
applied within internally accepted change management procedures. During the op-
erational phase, there is also ongoing activity to integrate tools and products. This 
could take the form of integrating tools, ticket systems, or processes that make the 
whole operation easier. So how do you know when your operation center is fully 
operational? This means different things for different organizations but for me typi-
cally when things are up and running if I can sit back and know for a fact that there is 
paper in the printer and I know exactly where the stapler is, then we are good to go! 
Ultimately you are in the operational phase if you are getting expected results and are 
following the established processes.
INTELLIGENCE PHASE
Although there are a lot of attributes that a SOC shares with other types of operation 
centers, the use of intelligence is a clear differentiator between a SOC and others. 
The utilization and application of intelligence is also what can set apart different 

11
﻿ Plan your SOC
SOCs from each other. Intelligence gathering and usage is also how a SOC can begin 
to become proactive in the IT security fight. In this phase, SOCs take information 
from various sources and use the data as input into security tools. It is the hope that 
this intelligence data will help to spot issues or potential problem areas. In Chapter 9, 
we will cover this in great detail and review where and how to get the information 
you need, as well as how to use it. But ultimately in this phase, a SOC has the ability 
to take information from external sources, apply it internally, and utilize the infor-
mation appropriately. Additionally, a SOC in this phase will seek out new sources 
of intelligence, create their own or have a natural desire or thirst for more and more 
information that will help to tune their tools to provide more qualified information or 
precursors that would indicate a negative event.
PLAN YOUR SOC
As you can see, before building a SOC, there are a huge amount of things we need 
to consider. The planning should not happen at a single level in the organization; 
there are too many issues and questions that need to be answered. Several areas from 
across the organization should be involved, such as finance, human resources, legal, 
and any critical lines of business you may have, not just IT. Getting people involved 
from the beginning as part of the project and its planning will go far down the road 
for you when your SOC starts performing its mission. By getting other groups in-
volved, the mission and overall business issues the SOC will resolve need to be 
socialized into these groups so that there are no surprises later. More often than not, 
when planning a SOC, people focus on the technology, staffing, training, and other 
technical aspects; but you cannot forget the business reasons why you are doing this 
in the first place. Communication is a key to moving your SOC forward with as little 
friction as possible. Sometimes the SOC is not a welcomed addition to an organiza-
tion. By being transparent in your mission, giving outside groups and even the gen-
eral IT organization the ability to help develop processes, makes the SOC something 
that everyone understands, welcomes, and can be a part of.
Now that we have gone through some of the basics of what an operation center 
is, let us discuss terminology. Because there will be many people involved in the 
planning and building the SOC, one of the keys to making the process smooth and 
successful is building a lexicon as early as possible. Organizations typically have 
an internal language that takes a while to understand. Add to that organizational 
language the complex terms of IT security and you will have a lot of people who do 
not know what each other is talking about. For example, imagine your company has 
a business unit called IDS, if you are a security person, you can already see how that 
can be confusing because conversations about IDS could mean the security tool IDS 
or it could be a business unit inside the organization. The formal lexicon is a great 
tool not only to build for your SOC, but also for other people outside the SOC. Some 
information will be nonsense for people but other information will be helpful. The 
lexicon is a tool that should be shared freely. As contractors or new employees come 

12
CHAPTER 1  Efficient operations
in and out of the SOC, share this with them to help them understand who you are 
and use the same language. For the SOC, IT security can be a language of its own 
that people who are not in the security business will find hard to understand and use 
to talk knowledgably about security topics and issues. Additionally, there is a lot of 
debate among security people on the meaning of some things and it is important to 
have a common set of definitions from the beginning.
What is an “event”; what is an “alert”; what is an “incident”?
It is all right if you disagree with some of the definitions I present here because 
there always seems to be some confusion and arguments around the words, “event,” 
“incident,” and “alert.” We also cannot forget about what a “log” is. Everything 
starts out with a log so it will need to be addressed and defined along with the others 
key terms. It is important to figure out what these mean to you because your SOC 
will be working with these terms every single day. The SOC will analyze them, 
report on them, correlate them, create metrics on them, and pull their hair out over 
them. Particularly during stressful periods, such as anything that would cause an 
operations center to be called into action for incident response, it is critical that all 
personnel involved use and understand key terms effectively. Even if you use those 
terms incorrectly according to someone else outside of your organization, as long as 
there is an acceptable understanding of the use in your organization, you will be fine. 
For example, if someone said, “we receive 1,000 logs a day” I may think that is a bit 
low, but on the other hand if someone said “we receive 1,000 events a day,” I may 
be a bit worried.
The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) V3 provides some clar-
ity and uniformity in the definitions. ITIL defines an event as a change of state that is 
significant to service management, but possibly could be a normal change of state op-
posed to a negative change such hard drive error. An incident is unplanned interruption 
of an IT service, reduction in quality of service, or a failure of a configuration item. 
Thus, an incident characterizes a negative impact on the service or service quality.
Every incident needs to be recorded and needs to be tracked as well as docu-
mented to make sure that everyone is doing what they are supposed to be doing and 
following the correct procedures; a system like this that automatically numbers the 
incidents recorded is called ticket system. There are many ticketing systems out there 
and we will cover some of the features later on. But, it is important to note that each 
ticket system may have its own way of viewing and defining these terms as well. 
There are additional terms that ticket systems understand, such as “problem,” “ex-
ception,” or “change,” but we will not get into those right now. Instead, be advised 
that if you already have a ticket system in your organization, you may want to review 
how it handles these terms and adopt the terms used by the ticketing system because 
it will make your life much easier. Otherwise, you will have to go out and find a new 
ticketing system that agrees with your definitions and that could be expensive and 
time consuming.

﻿ Logs
LOGS
Logs are the most basic form of information a system can generate. An operating 
system, application, service, or almost anything can generate a log that records basic 
information about something that just happened. Typically logs are produced by sys-
tems as a form of audit trail. This would give a system administrator, or in our case 
the SOC, an indication of something that may have gone wrong and would provide 
hints on how to diagnose a problem. Transaction logs are similar but do not typi-
cally depict a fault. Instead, it is a recording of something that happened, such as an 
entry or record deletion from a database. Correlation is where you can combine logs 
from different systems and apply analysis to those logs. This is where most modern 
Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) systems really prove their value. 
By taking logs from different systems that appear unrelated and correlating them 
together to generate something new can be a very influential and useful system. For 
example, by taking a database transaction log that shows a record entry by a user 
and then a firewall log showing network activity from an IP address registered to the 
same user who made the record entry, we can validate that if the user is who he says 
he is and has authorization to make that entry, then all is well. This is a very simple 
example and there are hundreds more, how you correlate logs is up to you and your 
objectives. In Chapter 3, we will spend much more time on SIEM tools, correlation, 
and the value of the log as well as log collection. For now, it is important to define 
what a log is, how it can be used, and then build on that.
System logs have many good uses and have more purposes than you may real-
ize. For example, one great use for logs is forensics. There are many organizations 
that archive log data for long periods of time for potential future reference. These 
types of logs usually are protected by an organization’s log repository or storage 
system and kept according to an organizations retention policy. The usefulness of 
keeping logs can come from any situation where a system problem is discovered to 
when a possible fraud has been detected and historical logs need to be reviewed to 
see how long this issue has been happening and possibly when or how it started. In 
criminal or legal cases, logs can help prove an action and are typically allowed as 
evidence in court. Because logs can be used as evidence, it is important that your 
logs are protected forensically. This means that once a log is written, if you can 
prove that controls are in place so that no one can alter, or delete that log, they are 
considered protected. Typically, to protect the logs, you would send the logs from 
the system that generated it to another system designed to receive those logs and 
store it securely.
As we began to discuss above, logs can help you triage and diagnose system 
problems or even tell you when everything is working correctly. Problems could 
consist of services not starting properly, users failing to present their username or 
password correctly, or a record of tasks an administrator is performing. Additionally, 
logs can be generated showing errors on a hard drive or other hardware-related is-
sues. Logs can provide information such as which accounts were accessed and what 
actions were performed.

14
CHAPTER 1  Efficient operations
Unfortunately, in a lot of situations within organizations where SOCs do not 
exist, an “Instant SOC” or an incident response team will find during an incident 
that logs contain no information or evidence because logging was either completely 
disabled on a system or configured improperly. Organizations should baseline all 
their systems to ensure a level of logging appropriate for each system, and look to 
enable a higher level of logging on more critical systems. All systems should have 
file auditing activated and should log audit those events, particularly administrative-
level activity. If you are running a central logging system, you should have a log 
health monitoring system to verify that logging is functioning properly and you are 
receiving events properly. In addition, you should audit your logs on a regular basis 
to ensure that the logs contain the proper information that you need. Do not just log 
everything, make sure you make conscience decisions on what to log as it can get 
very expensive to store all that information and you will need an ever increasing 
high-powered system to use large log storage systems for anything meaningful.
Logs always should contain some basic information and include the required in-
formation you need to make it valuable enough to keep it. One of the primary items 
you need in a log is a time and date stamp. It is very important that you have all 
your systems configured to have their time updated from a central authoritative time 
source. Thus, when you are reviewing logs from several systems you can be rela-
tively certain that logs were generated at or near the same time and would be likely 
generated by the same action or user. Additionally, the time stamp is vital to be able 
to correlate events among different systems and piece together a real picture of an 
event. Next you need some kind of description as to what the log represents or why 
the log is being generated. For a network-based event, you also may want the log to 
contain IP address information such as the source IP of the system that took an action 
and/or the DNS name; you also may want the authenticated user information. The 
items that can go into a log are almost endless and depend greatly on the capability 
of the system or application that generates the log. Logging mechanisms and the 
ability to track user activities are critical. The presence of logs in all environments 
allows thorough tracking and analysis if something does go wrong. From a log, you 
should be able to answer the basic questions of, who, what, when, where, and why? 
Additional information that you may find in a log or events that may be required by 
regulations to ensure they are logged could be:
• 
User identification information
• 
Type of event
• 
Success or failure indication
• 
Event origination point
• 
Description
• 
Severity
• 
Time
• 
Service name
• 
Protocol
• 
User

﻿ Logs
There are also a bunch of things that you have to be careful of when setting up 
your logs. You want to ensure that private or protected data are not going to be sent 
to the log files or transmitted from system to system. This is a vital concern for a SOC 
as it is one of the things a SOC is looking to protect against. A quick list of things that 
you do not want to see in a log:
• 
Source code
• 
Passwords
• 
Encryption keys
• 
Bank information
• 
Credit card information
• 
Personal identifiable information (PII)
• 
Personal health information (PHI)
• 
Information that is illegal to collect
The type of information for which you may want to consider ensuring there is a 
log may include:
• 
All actions taken by any individual with root or administrative privileges
• 
All administrative access and action taken by administrators
• 
Access to the logs
• 
Use of identification and authentication mechanisms, success, and failure
• 
Initialization/clearing of the audit logs
• 
Creation and deletion of system-level objects
Systems typically give you the ability to set different logging levels and you 
sometimes can find documentation on how configure the levels and what informa-
tion you get at those various levels. You also may find that some systems will even 
give you a severity level in the log, where each individual log entry is marked at a 
level such as “Warning,” “Error,” or “Information.” This is very helpful because you 
may decide to filter for all events at a Warning level that could help you reduce the 
amount of noise you need to review or collect. If you are filtering logs such as this, 
it also could be very helpful to reduce the amount of hard drive space you require to 
store all the necessary information.
In looking at the different logging levels, you may decide that one level will work 
on one system and another is needed somewhere else. Logging levels are a good way 
to squelch the noise and tune the log information to just the right level for what you 
need. Most systems will follow some kind of escalating scale of verbosity in their 
level of logging. Typically you will see Debug, Information, Warn, Error, and Fatal. 
Different systems may call them by different names, but those are the basic levels 
you typically will see. Ideally, you will want to tune your logs to get just the right 
information you need.
The Debug level is the most verbose logging level. Because debug will produce 
a large amount of logs, you have to be very careful when enabling this setting on 
production systems because it could cause latency or performance impact to the in-
dividual system required to produce the logs. Also, be warned that in some cases the 

16
CHAPTER 1  Efficient operations
debug level of logging in application can write personal identifiable information, 
financial, or other types of data that you may not want to be exposed inside a log.
The Informational level, which is one step below debug, typically is used to out-
put information that is useful to the running and management of a system.
The Warning level often is used for handled “exceptions” or other important 
log events. For example, if an application requires a configuration setting but has 
a default in case the setting is missing, the Warning level should be used to log the 
missing configuration setting.
Error is used to log all unhandled exceptions. Some error logs list every single 
error that may occur. Others may be configured to save information about errors se-
lectively, listing only certain error codes. However, the system may work, each error 
log entry should include an error code, a time, and may add other information such 
as an action someone was trying to complete, someone’s location, and whether or 
not the error was resolved. Error logs can be searched to identify specific patterns or 
errors encountered by a particular user or application.
Fatal is reserved for special exceptions/conditions where it is imperative that you 
can quickly pick out these events.
Auditing is another important area for logs, and at some organization, this is 
where logs are used the most. Reports from system logs for audit and compliance 
may satisfy requirements in regulations such as PCI, SOX, or HIPAA. Log auditing 
should be automated, and logs can be used to reconstruct events.
An example requirement from PCI pertaining to logs:
• 
10.3 Record at least the following audit trail entries for all system components 
for each event:
• 
10.3.1 User identification
• 
10.3.2 Type of event
• 
10.3.3 Date and time
• 
10.3.4 Success or failure indication
• 
10.3.5 Origination of event
• 
10.3.6 Identity or name of affected data, system component, or resource
EVENT
An event can still be a log, but it is a log that has specific context for you. Events can 
come from multiple sources, not just logs. For example, a user calling to complain 
about too many spam messages in his email is an event. Additional examples are 
provided below. In all cases, an event is an input to the SOC that needs to be filtered 
and reviewed to determine if it warrants further investigation or analysis. It is typi-
cally a log of significance that someone wished to record about what is happening but 
mostly will not require a user’s attention or intervention. It really has or should not 
have any level of importance, but typically can include the notation of Information, 
Warning, or Exception.

17
﻿ Alerts
Examples:
• 
Disk space has exceeded a certain threshold, such as 95%
• 
CPU utilization exceeded 99%
• 
A user logged into the system
• 
Starting a print job
• 
Updating a database
Not all logs that you collect will be worthy enough to be an event that someone 
may have to review. For example, you may log CPU performance over time so you 
can graph it later; this would not constitute an event. Many events are not necessar-
ily bad things and could even be an expected outcome. It is important to think about 
what events are relevant to your SOC and what other types of events you receive 
that may be relevant to other parts of the organization, such as an application support 
group, a NOC, or help desk.
ALERTS
Alerts are a graduated event, an event of interest that typically sets off a preconfig-
ured notification or alarm because something has reached a specified threshold and 
requires attention by a responsible person with the appropriate tools and authority to 
investigate. It does not have to stem from a log, but typically alerts begin as events 
that are critical enough to require some level of attention. In the previous section, we 
gave an example of a user calling about too much spam, but in the case of an alert, it 
would be a user calling to report a suspicious email with a potentially malicious at-
tachment. It could also be a notification from an external organization or government 
agency telling you that something is wrong. An alert is an event that is of special note 
because someone or something has indicated an interest in that event and wants to 
be alerted to it. It is also very important to note that alerts are indicators of Incidents 
and/or Problems, as we will discuss later.
There are many different types of monitoring tools, but they typically do the same 
thing: monitor logs or system changes on devices and then somehow notify an opera-
tor or system administrator that there is a problem underway. In our case, it raises the 
awareness on a potential security issue that needs further investigation by the SOC.
Not all events are worthy enough to be considered an alert. Years ago, if a CPU 
spiked on a server or a user’s workstation it caused an alert, one of the main things 
you may think of in the realm of security is that the system may have contracted a 
virus, but that is not necessarily the case with most modern malware. So, for security 
considerations, a short burst of a CPU spike most likely will be noise and not impor-
tant. If there is a CPU spike on a web server once every day and a NOC is monitoring 
the server, then the NOC could use something like a problem management system or 
a ticket system and by using reports on these types of events can see this as an ongo-
ing pattern of a potential problem and investigate. Other examples like this could be 
the failure of a print job or an unsuccessful attempt to update a database. All alerts 

18
CHAPTER 1  Efficient operations
should create incidents and/or problem tickets indicating that something is amiss or 
is soon to be, requiring immediate or near immediate action/work.
Key Points: The more alerts your SOC receives, the more work your SOC needs 
to perform. As your tools tell you something is wrong, the SOC needs to analyze 
these alerts to ensure that SOC staff understands why the alert was triggered and to 
remediate any issues related to that alert. So, the more alerts you have, the more re-
sources you need to address those alerts. Efficiencies can be created to reduce alerts, 
and make alerts easier and quicker to respond to or remediate. This is called tuning, 
just as we discussed with logs and events but now we are doing it with security tools 
to reduce the number of alerts to something meaningful, actionable, and important 
that the organization can handle. Keep in mind that tuning is a bit of an art and should 
be handled by skilled individuals only and in some cases, depending on the sensi-
tivity of the network the tools are protecting and the type of tools being tuned, they 
should also conform to a security review board or some form of change management 
process. In some cases, an organization can become overtuned and therefore essen-
tially blind to real security activity.
Typically, security tools not only will produce alerts to tell you that there is a 
potential security issue, but they almost always produce too many alerts that do not 
really have meaning. When you plug a security tool into your network, you will see 
tons of alerts, as every vendor wants to show you the “value” of its system as quickly 
as possible. Unfortunately, these devices always need initial tuning as well as essen-
tial ongoing tuning that will be a critical function of your SOC. There are different 
types of alerts that the tools will produce; it is up to your SOC to determine the va-
lidity, criticality, and importance of these alerts and then do something about them. 
Understanding the various categories of alerts the system can produce is important to 
your operation. It will help your SOC follow key processes that we will discuss later 
and also will help you with key metrics that we also will review later.
There are four primary categories of alerts that you may see:
• 
False positive
• 
True positive
• 
False negative
• 
True negative
FALSE POSITIVE
A false positive alert, as it relates to our world of IT security, occurs when an action 
or transaction occurs and a tool is configured to detect that action and then fires off an 
alert, although the action or transaction is actually legitimate traffic or not the right 
situation it was supposed to be a trigger This can occur when you create a rule to 
catch something seemingly bad but find out that some applications in your environ-
ment do that “bad thing” you are seeking to detect as one of its normal functions. 
Because the application performs this action that triggers the alert does not make it 
something worrisome, but rule you created will cause a false positive alert. In that 

19
﻿ False negative
case, you should attempt to filter out that known normal behavior to reduce the num-
ber of false positive alerts. Another way a false positive can be generated is when 
the SOC creates an incorrect or too-broad of a rule in the security system, causing 
the tool to find too many things that match the conditions of the rule. There are many 
other ways a false positive result can be generated from your tools, and these were 
just quick examples of why this would happen. It is also important to understand that 
a false positive alert can have two different outcomes. First, the false positive can 
be determined to be a false alarm; it is a false alarm when it requires an unnecessary 
intervention to analyze and diagnose the alert because there is nothing wrong. False 
positives also can be a true alert, this happens sometimes when a rule is created to 
detect a specific kind of traffic and when an alert is triggered the information that 
triggered the alert is not the same information or reason the alert was established 
but is still bad in nature and needs to be investigated further or even remediated. A 
simple analogy for this would be that your fire alarm sounds indicating a fire, but in 
reality there is a flood.
TRUE POSITIVE
True positive alerts are those that you really never want to see because it means 
something bad happened from a security perspective. These are alerts that are con-
figured correctly and are triggered properly to notify the right people that a security 
issue exists and further analysis or remediation is needed. Depending on your view, 
obviously true positive alerts are what you want to have and the closer to 100% of all 
your alerts are true, the closer you are to maximum efficiency. An intrusion detection 
signature is a pattern created by your IDS detection vendor, by you or by your com-
pany to match known traffic against unknown traffic and is applied to currently tra-
versing data on a network. A pattern or signature that matches an installed signature 
for the exact reason you want it to match, whether good or bad, is considered a true 
positive. The accuracy of your rules, signatures, and configurations will determine 
the percentage of how true your alerts are. Therefore, with an IDS system, a signature 
may fire 10 times and only one is a true positive event. This will need to be reviewed 
to see if the signature could be fixed to make it more true or accurate.
FALSE NEGATIVE
A false negative occurs when the security system fails to detect the specific transac-
tion or event it was designed to find. It can also be a security tool’s inability to detect 
true actions under certain conditions. A false negative is very serious because it is 
the failure of the tools, your operations, and your SOC to detect and respond to a real 
event that could harm or damage your organization. When we discuss moving your 
SOC into the intelligence phase or maturity, this is where we get your SOC to close 
the gap on false negatives. Additionally, when a SOC focuses on tuning the tools and 
trying to reduce what is perceived as noisy signatures or events, a condition known 

20
CHAPTER 1  Efficient operations
as being “overtuned” can begin to become a problem. As in the true positive example 
where only 1 out of 10 times an IDS signature fires is true and the other nine are false, 
we then have to ask the question, do you turn this signature off until it can be fixed? 
In tuning, this may be the question you face. In other words, is it better to not have 
nine false positive alerts and risk missing the one true alert? Being overtuned means 
that the squelching and turning off of rules, signatures, or events was too aggressive 
and you are now missing relevant information. This is a very difficult thing to mea-
sure, but you can test for it using vulnerability scanners and exploit testing tools to 
ensure you have some good level of fidelity. These tools will generate or simulate a 
desired attack against a system or network of you are choosing and will allow you to 
test your systems to help ensure you are not overtuned.
TRUE NEGATIVE
When no attack has taken place and no alarm is raised, you have a true negative condi-
tion. Another way of describing a true negative is that all your rules, tools, and signa-
tures have evaluated a packet of data or log and there were no matches to indicate a 
condition that would trigger an alert. When tuning, you must be mindful of true nega-
tives because as you tune you will change the sensitivity of your security systems and 
may turn true negatives into false positives. The true negative also can be considered 
an event that promoted to an alert. These are all important things to view; it will help 
you ask questions such as why are you collecting that information? Can you eliminate 
the generation of that event to help save on resources? Or, what can you do with that 
information to make it more relevant. In many cases, you can take several events that 
are truly negative events and correlate them together to make alert of significance.
INCIDENTS
Now that we have some good definitions to work from, we can start to assemble our 
SOC and provide the security services that our organization needs. But, in order to 
do this, we need something to happen!
We need an incident, well actually we really do not want an incident because that 
means something bad has happened … but that is why we are here. As National In-
stitute of Standards and Technology defines an incident, it is a violation or imminent 
threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard 
security practices.2 Although that is a very good raw definition of an incident, I be-
lieve that we need to break that down a bit further. An incident can be very detailed 
or contain very limited information. After investigation, it could turn out to be a false 
positive or a very serious breach, but in all cases, an incident is something that needs 
to be dealt with quickly and effectively. The reason we need to break this down is

﻿ Incidents
because when we talk about incidents, people automatically will start talking about 
incident response. Although it is true that the generation of an incident means that 
you need incident response, the SOC will handle incident response all day long and 
it may never go beyond a single analyst’s review and closure where other incidents 
will require the involvement of senior leaders, legal teams, line of business represen-
tation, outside vendor support, and so on.
It is all right to interchange the terms alert and incident, the classification of the 
two are so loose that it would not be wrong to speak in terms of alerts opposed to in-
cidents or vice versa. In some businesses, it is better to not use the word incident be-
cause of how it is perceived or understood culturally. As you build your SOC, these 
terms will settle in with your organization and will start to mean things to you unlike 
it means outside your organization. In some places, alerts may not become incidents 
until they involve resources outside the SOC. In other places, alerts do not become 
an incident unless there is a negative impact of some degree. We will discuss incident 
response, communications, and thresholds later in the book. For now, it is important 
to know that just because your tools generated alert or incident notices does not mean 
you should overreact … there are many more items to consider.
An incident could be a virus that infected a single computer and could not be 
cleaned by the antivirus tools. It could also be the correlation of 500 logs showing 
a rapid failure of a user logon occurring all within three seconds of each other and 
for a user account of an employee who was previously terminated. Another example 
could be a single event showing a successful administrative login from a known bad 
IP address. Other examples of potential incidents could include:
• 
Denial of service
• 
Inappropriate or unauthorized use or access
• 
Vulnerability identification
• 
Hacker activity
• 
Data loss
• 
Lost or stolen devices
See appendix A for more.
All of these examples require very separate responses. Some can be and should 
be handled inside the SOC, where others require more involvement and the enact-
ment of a full incident-response plan.
For a SOC to function correctly and to be able to produce meaningful metrics, 
there must be a record of the incident. Therefore, all incidents must be ticketed and 
tracked in some form of ticket system. Later we will discuss ticket systems and the 
ways they can help or hurt an organization. For now, it is important to know that all 
these incidents need to have a place to be recorded and tracked. If for nothing else, 
there needs to be a clear record of what happened, what was done, and what the re-
sults were regarding the specific incident. In all cases, an incident requires some kind 
of after-action review or root-cause analysis. This practice will help spot problem 
areas, help define never repeat action items an organization needs to implement, or 
what failures need to be avoided in the future to prevent these types of incidents from 
occurring again.

PROBLEMS
I do not want to step on any toes when it comes to ITIL definitions or practices and I 
certainly do not want to start any wars over incident management and problem man-
agement, but it is worthwhile to understand “problems” as they relates to security 
incidents and ticketing systems. There are several ways that a problem can be gen-
erated. In some cases, hopefully rare, there will be an incident generated that when 
investigated, a root cause is found right away and restoration or a fix action can take 
place right away. For example, an incident can be generated into the SOC that a criti-
cal server failed to update its antivirus definitions. After a quick look, it appears that 
the hard drive on which the antivirus application is installed does not have enough 
space to handle the update. A quick bit of housekeeping may resolve this incident. 
This is an important classification change because it would not be right to include 
this in any kind of incident or alert metrics. Instead, it is a problem and once the root 
cause of the problem is resolved, the problem is resolved and there is no adverse im-
pact. It would not be fair to call this an incident; similarly an incident that turns out 
to be a false positive should be recycled back into the system as a problem needing 
further investigation and the determining of root cause so that future false positives 
can be avoided. A problem can also be created if after reviewing several incidents, 
a pattern emerges and a root cause is found for why these incidents were generated. 
Then a problem can be created to resolve those issues maybe from a tuning perspec-
tive. A problem would be generated and escalated as needed for a request of some 
kind of work to be performed in order to resolve or solve an issue.
An entire chapter is dedicated to metrics, but it is good at this point to introduce 
some elementary metrics. Below is a typical funnel chart that you eventually will 
want to generate for your SOC. This shows that you have collected some number of 
total events, in our case, it is 9 billion events over the course of whatever time frame 
you are observing. Out of those 9 billion events, there were 645 alerts/incidents that 
the rules, tools, and signatures generated that the SOC investigated. After all the hard 
work, your SOC performed in investigating all those incidents, you very success-
fully had responded to 85% security issues, where the remaining 15% was probably 
recycled back for tuning or further review.

23
﻿ Define your requirements
DEFINE YOUR REQUIREMENTS
With the basic understanding of what we will be dealing with in the SOC and that we 
have now established a bit of common language, we can begin to think about what 
we need the SOC to do and start to build requirements. Every SOC is different and 
every organization is different that employs a SOC. You have to define what is im-
portant and focus on operationalizing that aspect to make it successful. The SOC can 
provide many, many different functions based on your organization’s requirements. 
For example, the SOC could be focused on unauthorized data access and closely 
monitor file servers, or the proper handling of virus and IDS events. Maybe the SOC 
does IDS monitoring and handles incident response as a computer emergency re-
sponse team. A SOC can handle all aspects of IT security from the monitoring and 
management of antivirus, web proxies, log management, firewall policy approvals, 
and all the way to defining configuration standards of technology deployed at the 
organization and penetration testing the environment. This was not presented to be 
an all-inclusive list of functions a SOC typically can perform, more it is to give you 
an idea and help start you on a path of defining the required functions you need from 
a SOC. A larger list is available in Appendix C. If you are reading this book, you 
probably already have a few key requirements, but that does not mean they are your 
only requirements.
As you define and then subsequently build your SOC, you should always con-
sider how to build it efficiently and cost effectively. You need to make sure you can 
scale and grow with as little impact to the overall organization as possible. This will 
help the SOC become or continue to be a vital asset to your organization, as opposed 
to a drain on funds and resources. As you build or redefine and understand your 
requirements for the SOC, the next chapters will help you scope, size, and better ad-
dress all the items you will need to consider for you to be able to run and maintain a 
successful SOC organization.
SUMMARY
You have taken on the task of building a SOC and after reading this chapter, you 
have a good understanding of the fundamentals. I believe this is a lot of information 
for defining an operation center and although some does not seem to directly pertain 
to the center itself, without doing some up front fundamental definitions, we cannot 
all be singing from the same sheet of music. As stated before, I strongly recommend 
that as you build your SOC, you also build an internal lexicon document: a document 
that defines terms that mean something to you, which outsiders may not necessarily 
know, or what is commonly referred to as internal knowledge. This will go a long 
way when you have both new employees and external auditors.
We have discussed the different types of operation centers and when you may 
use one opposed to the other, and the purpose of the SOC. Your SOC is going to go 
through phases of development and maturity. Because every organization is different, 

24
CHAPTER 1  Efficient operations
the path you go with your SOC will be different. There are things that are important 
to you that may not be important to other organizations. Because of this, you need to 
make sure you measure yourself against the needs of the organization you are pro-
tecting, as well as external security organizations, to see where you need to improve 
and find your areas of focus. It is all right to not be in the intelligence phase on Day 
1, you will get there if you employ continual improvement programs and focus on 
your team. The business of logs, events, alerts, and incidents can be very confusing. 
In the end, all that really matters is that when you receive something from a tool, you 
investigate it, and if needed, resolve it properly and with minimal negative impact to 
your organization as possible.
In today’s cyber security environment, it is not a matter of whether an organiza-
tion will be compromised, but when and how badly. It is your SOC’s responsibility  
to find the indications that something is wrong and put a stop to it as quickly as 
possible and before any real damage is done. More now than ever, it is vital for 
operations to be efficient, capable of proper reaction, and knowledgeable enough to 
guide remediation efforts when needed. The SOC needs to understand organizational 
policy and be able to configure the security tools to find violations. But it is also more 
important for the SOC to understand the organization or business it protects so that 
when rules, tools, or signatures fire, the SOC can put the information into the proper 
context of those policies and the operation of the organization or business. This will 
help to level-set the severity of an incident and ensure that proper attention is paid  
to the right things.

CHAPTER 2  Identify your customers
If you are building a SOC you should already have some kind of idea of who your 
customers are or why you are doing this whole SOC thing in the first place. The 
SOC may have been kick started because of a recent event or as a precaution to a 
potential event that could bring great risk to an organization. The charter for a SOC 
may just be simply to ensure a repeat event does not happen or that your organiza-
tion does not get into as big trouble as some other organizations in your industry. It 
could also be that your organization has a lot to protect and needs the right monitor-
ing and safeguards put in place. For whatever the reasons are that you want to build 
a SOC, you will quickly find out that the initial reasons that you wanted to build it 
will be greatly increased as soon as you start to build it. The scope of your project to 
build a SOC could become very large; therefore, it is important that you identify all 
the potential customers for the SOC prior to or during the initial phases of building 
the SOC. Once you identify who the potential customers are for the SOC, you can 
then start to design services and objectives to meet the needs of those customers. 
The various types of customers you may have will help dictate the types of services 
you will provide, the service level agreements you will need to maintain, and the 
key success metrics or key performance indicators that you will need to provide on 
an ongoing basis. Once you have a good idea as to who your customers are, you 
need to sit down with each of them and discuss what their goals and objectives are 
so that you can build out use cases that document what the specifics are that you 
are going to be providing and the reasonable expectations for the outcomes of those 
use cases.
In this chapter, we are going to explore the various types of customers that your 
SOC may be providing services for. We will also take a look at how different cus-
tomers may have different objectives, but if you build efficient operations you will 
find easy ways to service almost any type of request. Documenting use cases for 
your customers will not only help your operations understand their performance 
requirements but will also help customers understand what they will be getting from 
you. We are also going to discuss several different types of use cases for the SOC to 
give you a broad-spectrum understanding and a basic list of what a SOC could do 
for the organization. No two SOCs are alike. Your customers may be very different 
from the customers of other SOCs. The objectives and tasks may be similar, but the 
processes, risk tolerances, and reporting requirements along with the culture inside 
your SOC would almost always be different from any other SOC. This does not 
mean that you cannot share ideas and learn from other SOCs, as each SOC should 
strive toward being better and better with every ticket for every incident they face. 
As we discussed prior, a SOC is typically built out of necessity. There is a very 
specific and direct need to build an operation center that is responsible for the man-
agement and monitoring of the security infrastructure. The SOC needs to ensure 
that alerts and events are addressed in a timely manner and that all incidents are 
handled appropriately and escalated effectively. Once we have a clear understand-
ing of what the expectations are, we then need to address the customers’ concerns 
and ensure that the tools and processes in the SOC are going to appropriately meet 
those expectations.

27
﻿ Human resources
INTERNAL VERSUS EXTERNAL CUSTOMERS
A general understanding of who the customer is, is a vital step when looking to build 
a SOC for the first time. Initially you may think that the customer is just internal, that 
it is the IT department or the entire organization or company the SOC is working for. 
You may also think that if you are a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP), it is 
easy to see who your customers are because they are whoever is paying you for your 
services. These would all be dangerous assumptions, and the SOC leadership needs 
to dig deeper and make sure that not only do they understand who the customer is 
but also that everyone working in the SOC understands. All too often working in a 
SOC I hear people complain about users who constantly get viruses or try to access 
blocked sites. The analysts get frustrated because the users never learn and just make 
more work for the analysts because all the tickets need to be addressed no matter 
how many times the user gets a virus or accesses something bad on the Internet. 
These types of events can happen often, but when you realize that it is the user in this 
case that you are working for then it should be easier to deal with. In other words, 
when a SOC analyst understands that their responsibility is to protect the users and 
ensure that they do not lose their identity or that malware does not access or transfer 
protected data off of a user’s computer, then their attitude may change. In the above 
example it is the user the SOC is working for, but users can be a part of many dif-
ferent internal organizations and may have different needs other than just having 
someone make sure their endpoints are safe and clean of malware. A data breach 
is a good reason to set up a SOC but what data do you protect, where is the data to 
protect? Typically, organizations that have had an issue start off looking in one direc-
tion for their security requirements but soon realize that there are a ton more areas 
that need to be protected. From an organization’s standpoint, a SOC is a great way to 
get experts focusing on a problem. From a security or SOC’s perspective, there are 
many different things to focus on. Building an efficient Security Operations Center is 
a corner stone of execution to any organization’s security program and is an essential 
element in achieving the overall organizational goals.
Let us take a look at who the customers are and how the SOC can help each one. 
Keep in mind that the security infrastructure and tools may be the same but how 
the systems are configured, designed, licensed, or used may be different in different 
organizations.
HUMAN RESOURCES
The human resources (HR) department is typically a very important customer of a 
SOC. The ethical behavior of the people inside an organization is a great concern to 
the HR department. For many years organizations have authored codes of conducts, 
ethical behavior policy, harassment policies, acceptable use policies, and more. But 
until recently an HR department was at the whim of the people in an organization 
to report issues or bubble up real problems to be addressed or investigated. But now 

28
CHAPTER 2  Identify your customers
with the availability of the types of tools being installed to protect an organization’s 
infrastructure, HR can become a valuable customer and partner of the SOC and get 
regular services to help them evaluate what is going on inside an organization.
In many organizations. the policy applied to a web proxy that allows or disallows 
access to certain types of websites has been contested. In a lot of cases, it is the IT or 
security department that owns the web proxy devices, so consequently they own the 
policy. In a mature organization, it would be the HR department that owns the proxy 
policy and collaborates with the SOC. HR should be the organization that directs 
and controls who is allowed to access what, as this is a personnel and organizational 
policy issue. As a customer of the SOC, HR would be given the opportunity to set 
policy and the SOC would configure that policy and monitor against that policy. 
When issues arise or requests come in to open websites previously blocked to users, 
the SOC can either grant that access if it falls within a specified or previously agreed 
parameter or if in question they can engage HR for a ruling. This is a simple example 
of how HR can be a vital customer of the SOC. Additionally, the protection of us-
ers’ computers from malware or the management and control of lost mobile devices 
are also elements of services that can be provided via the HR department. As a fur-
ther example, it may be the IT department that issues mobile devices to employees, 
but who enforces policy on lost devices or the repeat offender who keeps loosing 
devices? Eventually these types of things go to HR but what about the data on the 
mobile device, who manages the risks associated with that? If the SOC is effectively 
working with HR from the beginning, then tight controls, processes and expectations 
can all be worked out from the start. Once you start effectively working with an 
internal HR department, there will be many things a SOC can provide as a service, 
such as disciplinary review of web accesses habits or other employee system reviews 
that are legally allowed such as in the case of harassment. Ultimately it comes down 
to a violation of policy by a member of an organization that the SOC would need to 
aid HR in investigating or vice versa. People will always find ways to circumvent 
security and violate the rules. Sometimes it is in an effort to get their jobs done in a 
perceived easier way or because they are dishonest and want to steal or defraud the 
organization. As a customer of the SOC, HR can consistently enforce organizational 
policy and avoid discriminatory or unfair issues in a way that they never could have 
done before.
LEGAL
The relationship the SOC has with legal is very symbiotic in that the SOC needs the 
legal department while the legal department needs the SOC all for different reasons. 
The fact that the SOC may be in existence in the first place could be because of the 
legal department. It may have been a mandate that due to a breach of the organiza-
tion’s computing systems or a loss of data, the legal ramifications were so great that 
very specific steps needed to be taken to ensure that the issues were either contained 
or prevented from happening again and the answer was to set up a SOC. In some 

29
﻿ Audit
cases this could have been the legal department or as an action of an organization’s 
board of directors at the discretion of the legal department. Services that a SOC pro-
vides directly to a legal department can vary depending on the organization’s goals 
or industry. One of the very important services that could be provided to legal is that 
of e-discovery. The SOC has tools it uses that perform e-discovery, and the SOC will 
typically have a much larger headcount than the legal department that it can utilize 
for these operation of those tools. Because of specific industries becoming more and 
more regulated, various types of court case are requesting reviews of electronically 
stored information. This could be data stored in email, on file servers, or even backup 
systems. Legal needs experts that not only know the tools but also know the organi-
zation’s infrastructure and where all the data are stored and if encrypted, the mecha-
nisms to access that information. The legal department also needs the SOC to be the 
watcher of data and to not only protect the organizations data or monitor access to 
data but also quickly notify the legal department of any loss of protected data. Many 
data protection laws have been created around the world and the legal department is 
required to make determinations on the organization’s legal requirements surround-
ing the loss of specific types of data. Additionally, the legal department needs to de-
termine what the requirements are to notify regulatory bodies or publicly announce if 
there was any loss of that protected data, and they need to do this in a timely manner.
AUDIT
Nobody really likes being tested and when auditors come around, it can often seem 
like a bad day is about to happen. Spending time documenting and making someone 
believe you do what you say you do instead of actually doing it can be a drag when 
there are “real” tasks that need to be completed. But it does not have to be that way, 
especially for a SOC. The SOC should see auditors as a customer and should look 
for opportunities to help the overall organization not only perform audits easier but 
more efficiently and effectively. The SOC should be a high quality, well defined, 
and repeatable processes-driven organization, which must have fully documented 
procedures and reports that support the actions of the SOC. This aligns perfectly with 
what audit groups are looking for and as such, the SOC should be able to leverage the 
tools they already have to build additional services for audit that can help cover the 
IT department or other departments that have reporting requirements. Additionally, 
by producing specific reports designed for internal or external auditors, the overall 
process to complete an annual audit can be done in just a matter of a few days instead 
of weeks. The SOC should be ready to contribute to, and perform, an audit every 
day, as long as the SOC documentation is prepared, put it all in a single or series of 
binders for easy access and also store it logically on a common file share. This way 
the SOC already has it ready to go. Lastly, the SOC should sit-down and work with 
the auditing department to help define additional audits or controls that should be 
measured. Auditors are not going to be as savvy security experts as the people in a 
SOC or sometimes they will be smarter depending on who they are. The SOC needs 

30
CHAPTER 2  Identify your customers
to look at the auditing department as a customer that needs to be provided metrics, 
documentation and training so that what is going on in security or other departments 
inside an organization can be well understood and everyone can agree that the out-
comes are proper and appropriate but if not, then the right corrections and recom-
mendations can be made.
ENGINEERING/R&D
Not all organizations have a large security department, and as we will discuss in 
later chapters the SOC may be run by a Chief Information Security Officer or could 
even only consist of a single person. Organizations that are producing products and 
services for customers or for internal purposes such as governments or military need 
to be more and more focused on security. This is not only the security of the prod-
ucts and services they are providing, but organizations also need to be aware of the  
how what they do affects the overall security of their customers. Whether it be 
information security of IT systems or operational security of automation systems, the 
entire enclave needs to have security considerations consistent with the customer’s 
goals. When designing and building products and services, developers typically do 
not worry about security. They are focused more on the functions or components 
they are given to build. The requirements for building come from design require-
ments, feature requests and validated bugs of previous versions. The requirements in 
building, designing and upgrading products and services have also come from secu-
rity especially when security flaws and issues have been discovered or are publicly 
disclosed. The SOC can work with engineering departments to help apply security 
best practices into their products. From a customer standpoint, the SOC is a great 
resource as a consultant to engineering or R&D. Since the SOC understands industry 
best practices and sees all kinds of threats every day, they are well suited to work 
with the Research and Development teams to guide and make recommendations as 
to how best to secure new products, enhance old ones, or install compensating coun-
termeasures around others. The SOC’s understanding of the System Development 
Life Cycle and its ability to use tools such as application fuzzers, packet captures, 
and vulnerability scanners make them a great resource to engineers. In addition to 
engineering working with the SOC as a consulting customer, engineering and de-
velopment organizations may also get the SOC to send them advanced vulnerability 
information on third party software and also have the SOC scan and interpret pen-
etration tests and vulnerability scans as needed on new projects.
IT
Having the IT department as a customer is going to be a hard concept for a lot of 
existing SOCs to comprehend. Most of the time the SOC is born out of IT or people 
are taken out of IT to be a part of the SOC or a larger security department. As such, 

31
﻿ External customers
sometimes people think that this is a step up and that the IT department is filled with 
people that are beneath them or not worthy or smart enough to be in security. In some 
organizations I have seen there being an outright adversarial relationship between the 
SOC and the larger IT organization. This relationship could be because of a breach 
and IT was not given an opportunity to clean up the mess, as they were perceived to 
be the cause. It could also be because as a SOC finds vulnerabilities, gaps in secu-
rity, and other issues they dump it all on to IT and point fingers. IT departments are 
having a very hard time these days and it is very difficult for them to keep up. Tech-
nology has outpaced most IT departments, and users in an organization constantly 
want the latest and greatest gadgets and gizmos but traditional IT departments cannot 
successfully support one off toys for everyone. Instead they have to figure out how 
to manage the needs of the organization as best possible. The last thing they need 
sometimes is a security operations group breathing down their neck pointing to and 
reporting on everything they are doing wrong. This type of attitude and environment 
plays heavily when we discuss organizational structure and where a SOC reports 
into. The bottom line is the SOC needs to view IT as a customer if not their most 
important customer. The majority of what the SOC needs to protect the organization 
will come from IT, but what will IT get out of it? The SOC needs to spend time up 
front and understand what the best services are that it can provide for IT. It needs to 
be customer driven and services provided in a way that can best be consumed by IT. 
So for a SOC, sending over a thousand pages of vulnerabilities from the last scan is 
not going to help, but maybe there is a benefit for a SOC to send over a simple report 
of the top ten must critical vulnerabilities affecting the most number of systems. This 
way IT can take care of critical issues that will have the most impact first. There are 
a ton of different ways that a SOC can be a great provider of services to IT, such as 
infrastructure troubleshooting, anomaly investigations, bandwidth issues and more. 
By sitting down with IT as a customer, the SOC can find great ways to provide value 
to not only IT but the overall organization.
EXTERNAL CUSTOMERS
If your SOC is looking to provide services externally, then your customers are not 
going to be as obvious as the finance department or HR. As an individual organiza-
tion that is not looking to manage security as a service and make money, external 
customers could just be interested third parties. They could be other organizations 
that use your organization’s services and as such are connected to your network in 
some way. It could be external engineering companies, or contractors that you need 
to provide protection for. Your organization could have wholly owned subsidiaries, 
partnerships with other organizations, or sister services and departments that need 
to leverage your SOC’s capabilities. The security services your SOC would provide 
to these customers may be limited to what equipment and visibility they have into 
those other organizations but may also be dictated by organizational requirements, 
regulatory restrictions, policy, or even international privacy laws. It could be that 

32
CHAPTER 2  Identify your customers
your organization provides IT services to third parties or they provide IT infrastruc-
ture to contractors who need to support your organization. Either way, the SOC may 
have deep responsibilities in protecting the two organizations through virtual envi-
ronments, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) or shared infrastructure. Sitting down 
with these types of customers may uncover many different ways that the SOC can 
provide value.
On the other hand if you are a Managed Security Service vendor, you instead 
need to find companies that want to pay for your security services. Your specific 
skills or expertise in the SOC will determine who you get as customers and how you 
acquire them when you first start up. An MSSP will focus on a vertical market and 
try to specialize in security services for that market. But once the MSSP, especially a 
small start-up, starts to gain customers it needs to work hard to keep those customers. 
The service it provides has to be good, it has to show value, and it needs to work hard 
to stay salient to its customers. One way to do that is to work with the customers and 
see how it can better serve the needs of its entire customer’s organization. An MSSP 
may have only been hired to monitor IDS logs, but if it can work with departments 
internal to the customer such as HR and gain support to monitor proxy logs or per-
form Acceptable Use Policy violations, then it can increase its value to the customer. 
For an MSSP, it’s not just about providing service but also about providing a valuable 
and expandable service that is scalable and that a customer can trust and rely on.
CUSTOMER OBJECTIVES
Regardless of who your customer is or where they are located, you need to make 
sure that you understand their needs completely. Additionally, a SOC needs to make 
sure that the services they provide are going to meet their requirements and expecta-
tions. In order to ensure that both the SOC and the customer are speaking the same 
language, service level agreements (SLAs) need to be documented but also the SOC 
needs to produce use cases for the individual elements of security services they will 
be providing. These documents are a critical step in establishing the parameters of 
how a SOC will operate and what are the elements for success.
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS
SLAs are documents that are drafted and agreed upon between the SOC and the 
customer (internal or external) needing security services. You would typically see 
an SLA document drafted as part of an overall contract between an outsourced pro-
vider and the customer, but internally a SOC can build an SLA as well. These could 
be traditional SLAs or even Service Level Objective (SLO) more common in inter-
organizational relationships. Regardless of what it’s called, most organizations that 
operate internal to an organization will not fully engage in this type of activity and 
will instead just focus on operations. In order to be a world class or best in class,

the SOC needs to invest the time it takes to build these documents. The SOCs that 
I have been a part of that have been the best will spend the time documenting their 
services as best possible. Having a service catalog of capabilities, communicating 
those services, and then documenting expectations go a long way in helping ensure 
that everyone is on the same page and that the SOC is meeting its goals. There are 
several types of SLA documents that can be written. Depending on your SOC and 
who you are focused on protecting, one or the other will suit you best. First you can 
have a customer SLA. This is a document that details your SOC’s services that will 
be provided to a specific customer. This would be a custom document that would 
be discussed, negotiated, and agreed upon as a collaboration between the SOC and 
the customer. Next you may want a specific service SLA. This is a document that 
details an agreement specific to an individual service that your SOC may provide. 
The service specific SLA is nice as it would be the same for every customer and 
would just detail all the relevant information regarding how the service was going 
to be delivered and executed. Lastly there is a multi-level or tiered SLA that can be 
written. This tiered SLA document can detail the level of services you may provide 
if you give customers the option to pay for different levels of service delivery such as 
24/7 versus 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The SLA document should include some basic sections with as detailed informa-
tion as possible. To start off, a summary and overview of the agreement should be 
created. This would detail key dates and a basic mission overview. Next there should 
be a section outlining the specific goals and objectives of the services to be provided. 
This is where a service catalog comes in handy. Items from the SOC service catalog 
can easily be listed. By listing from the catalog, it ensures that services being provid-
ed to multiple groups are consistently named and that there is no ambiguity in what 
people think the services are. For example, security intelligence services may be the 
same as threat intelligence service, or they may be different, who knows? But if you 
have documented use cases, as we will discuss, and each use case is part of your 
service catalog that gets called out in the SLA document, then you have consistency. 
Consistency in your documentation will help reduce errors and misconceptions.
Use cases <> SOC service catalog <> SLAs
Next you will want to document how the SOC is going to be measured against 
their execution of the services to be provided. This could be specific metrics that the 
SOC will produce on an agreed upon frequency of periodic reviews or in an annual 
customer review. This measurement may not just be about how well the SOC did but 
it could also be about how the services were utilized and how the customer could 
improve its security posture. It may also allow a customer and the SOC a predefined 
time that allows each group to review the services together and see if they are still 
in line with expectations or if adjustments need to occur. Making adjustments to 
services is a good thing and should be welcomed by an operations group. It is an 
opportunity to better align the team’s efforts with customer expectations or to reset 
those expectations if needed. If a SOC is inflexible and unable to adapt or change, 
then the SOC may soon find itself not only at odds with its customers but it may also 
find itself in a losing battle with malicious adversaries.

34
CHAPTER 2  Identify your customers
The stakeholders and members of the team should also be documented in the 
SLA. It should clearly state who is responsible for what. There are many different 
stakeholders that can be identified in this section of the SLA. First you may want to 
detail who are the primary individuals responsible and accountable for the relation-
ship between the SOC and the customer. These individuals would be considered the 
primary stakeholders of the agreement and would have ultimate power to change or 
modify the SLA. The primary stakeholders or their designees should be the individu-
als responsible to review metrics and service expectations. Next, the SLA document 
should detail any individuals who are required to be a part of any escalations. Ad-
ditionally it may be good to also detail under what circumstances or how escalations 
are to be made. Sometimes SOC’s will have an additional document detailing esca-
lation conditions, contacts, rotations, and their contact methods, so in the SLA you 
could just refer to that additional document and then ensure it gets filled out when 
the service starts for that customer. You should also make sure that not only are there 
named people who are the primary contacts for escalations but also backup personnel 
that should be notified by the SOC in case of any incidents.
Service scope is a big meat and potatoes section of an SLA. This is where you 
will detail some of the finer points around how your services are going to be deliv-
ered and what is covered. The SOC level of service and methods would be stated in 
this section to start with. Depending on if your SOC has a tiered level of service, you 
may want to state all the levels and then specifically call out the level of service that 
the customer has agreed to. This is typically something that you may see more in an 
outsourced relationship with an MSSP, but if you are building an internal SOC for 
your organization you may want to list your level of service as well. In some cases, 
larger enterprise organizations will have different levels of service in the SOC, es-
pecially for internal customers or business units that are allowed to operate indepen-
dently, but may use shared enterprise-based services. The business units would sign 
up for a level of service just the same way an external customer would and internal 
transfer of charges would reflect that level of service.
For example, the SOC can divide its service into multiple tiers. It may start off 
with a trial service that is 24/7/365 but has no cost during the trial period. Next it 
could feature three levels of service options that include silver, gold and platinum. 
All three may include a virtual helpdesk system through a web based or mobile 
portal system and troubleshooting information through a chat function online. Ad-
ditionally it may include software and signature updates for specific devices, and 
professional help for managing security incidents. The biggest differences in the 
services could be in the hours of operation; for example, platinum would provide 
24/7/365 live phone support, and if an incident occurred, the SOC would phone 
the primary and secondary contacts to notify and engage on the problem. Next, 
gold would provide 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. live telephone support, seven days a week and 
email notifications of incidents after hours. Finally, silver service would provide 
9 a.m. to 6 p.m. live telephone support, Monday to Friday, and email support for 
escalations after hours. There are many ways to tier the services a SOC offers. 
They could limit the number of incidents per month and charge additional fees for 

35
﻿ Service level agreements
excess. They can also charge for different types of services or even the number 
of devices, such as for the management of different types of devices like IDS, 
Firewall, web proxy, antivirus, and so on. There can also be additional charges for 
enhanced services, such as threat intelligence, forensics, log storage charges or 
incident response. However the SOC slices and dices the service they are going 
to provide. The service scope section of the SLA should detail what the customer 
has available to them and what they are signing up for. Additionally the service 
scope section should detail what the customer has that is coming under the SOC 
for service. It should detail for each capability what devices or assets are going to 
be managed. If the SOC is going to manage antivirus, then the number of servers, 
desktops and antivirus server systems being managed should be listed. If it is IDS/
IPS devices that will be managed and monitored by the SOC, then the device count 
should also be listed. Similar to how the customer contact and escalations docu-
ment can be separately documented, the listings of devices and equipment that are 
going to be monitored and managed by the SOC can also be separately listed. You 
will want some indication of what is covered as far as devices per service in this 
section, but the larger details could be acknowledged as an additional document. 
Service scope could also include items such as the SOC’s planned maintenance 
schedules, shift schedules and holiday schedule. You may want to consider listing 
any additional items that are available that a customer may want to take advantage 
of but would incur additional costs. Those could be professional services, consult-
ing, or even staff augmentation for specific security-related projects or issues that 
are performed at the customer’s site.
Customers should also have their own section in an SLA that captures any spe-
cifics or custom requirements that they may have imposed on them. It should detail 
what their responsibilities are to the SOC for ensuring the SOC can provide adequate 
services. It could include items such as payments or frequency of payments. You may 
decide that it should include what would happen if payments were not made. You will 
also want to include the responsibilities of the people that were named as primary 
contacts for the customer. If the SOC analyzes an incident and reaches out to one 
or all of the customer’s contacts with no reply, then the customer’s requirements to 
engage with the SOC service are not met and the SOC should not be held responsible 
for any damage. The customer may also be responsible for keeping maintenance 
plans on all hardware being monitored and would also be responsible for managing 
the process of device replacement if needed. Sometimes the SOC can handle these 
types of things for a customer but those responsibilities should be carefully spelled 
out to ensure both parties understand the expectations. Additionally, even though the 
SOC may manage devices for the customer, it may be the customer’s responsibility 
to ensure the SOC has access to those devices. So if the network goes down or the 
SOC loses access for some reason, the escalations go to the customer and it would 
be the expectation that the customer will work to resolve the issues for the SOC. A 
lot of times you will see the same type of device health and connectivity expectations 
between an internal SOC and an internal IT group as the SOC does not control the 
network but would need IT to help manage and maintain connectivity. If this is the 

36
CHAPTER 2  Identify your customers
case in your organization, then an SLA would help set the expectations between the 
two groups as an outage of security devices may not carry the same priority to IT as 
it does to the SOC. But if it is documented and agreed upon, then the expectations are 
there for everyone to see and for each team to execute on.
Just as we have a section on customer expectations and requirements, there should 
also be a section of the SLA that details some requirements for the SOC. This could 
include the number of dedicated hours a customer will get from a service representa-
tive or engineer in working with the customer on evaluating the effectiveness of the 
service, fine tuning the service, or building custom rules and signatures. It could also 
detail any required notifications to customers for planned or unplanned service out-
ages. It should also detail the expectation of how long it will take the SOC to address 
newly created tickets, emails and phone calls placed into the SOC. As mentioned 
before under customer expectation, when there is a critical incident that needs to get 
escalated the SOC requirements section should detail the level of effort that is going 
to be made to make positive contact with the customer to escalate and inform them 
of the situation.
The recipe of how you build your SLA documentation will be up to you, and if 
you are providing external services for a fee it may also be up to your legal depart-
ment. Regardless, the documentation surrounding what services you will provide, 
how you will provide them, and the expectations for your SOC and the customer is 
an invaluable tool especially for SOCs that are responsible for protecting a single 
organization that may have multiple departments. The SLA documentation may be a 
luxury for new SOCs that are just starting up especially if it is in response to a breach 
or compromise, but do not neglect it forever. The full and complete understanding 
of what the SOC does for an organization is critical and once documented, the SOC 
needs to execute and strive to always exceed expectations.
BUILD AND DOCUMENT YOUR USE CASES
Now that we understand the circumstance of how we are going to provide our ser-
vice and who we are going to provide it to, we need to start to understand what we 
are going to provide in the SOC. There are so many different types of service that a 
SOC can provide to an organization and the core function of a SOC in the beginning 
may be to stop another breach from happening, but a SOC needs to understand what 
it is doing. Understanding what to do is best achieved through the documentation of 
use cases. I have spent many hours in front of a SIEM tool developing rules or an 
IDS building signatures and although I have solved the world’s security problems 
only to find out the next day that I can remember what I did. Even worse, I have cre-
ated very complex series of rules and chains that seemed to work great but because 
I did not document them, I could not troubleshoot them and had to reinvent them all 
from the beginning. I have also created so many rules that when they started trig-
gering alerts and were ticketed into the SOC, they were all true positive events but 
I could not, for the life of me, remember why I wanted the event or what the event 

37
﻿ Build and document your use cases
meant. I know this sounds silly but when you create hundreds of rules and signatures 
and if your documentation is lacking, there is no way you will remember what you 
did or why and it will be next to impossible to tell an analyst what to do with the 
ticket once it gets created. The better your documented use cases are, the less trouble 
you are going to get into. I started to document every rule, no matter how simple or 
how complex. Once I got into the habit of documenting my rules and building use 
cases, the world seemed so easy to navigate, and as an additional bonus when audi-
tors came around and asked what the SOC does, I could just hand them my use case 
book, perfect!
I hope that short rant gave you enough of a kick to believe me that documenting 
use cases is a good thing to do. It will also help you when you sit down with custom-
ers and try to explain what you do or how you do it and the value of why they need 
you to do it. Keep in mind that your use cases should be a guarded secret, it is your 
internal play book and needs to be confidential. This is because you are building use 
cases that are important to your organization or customer’s organizations. It could 
detail vulnerabilities, gaps, or risks that you would not want to let outside entities get 
a hold of. Let us go through a few use cases but first let us describe some of the key 
elements you should think about documenting for each.
First you will want a use case name and identification number. You could have 
many if not hundreds of use cases that you will use. These use cases could be active, 
inactive, or in development and you need an effective way to track them. Trying to 
find some simple naming convention will help you. You could even use your tick-
eting system to help, by creating a ticket and then giving your use case the ticket 
number and common name, you can easily track not only the use case information 
but also comments, suggestion, issues, or known issues with the use case. Addition-
ally by tracking the use case in a separate queue in your ticket system, it would give 
analysts easy access to the use cases and any needed reference documentation all 
inside the ticket. You may also want to name your rules in your SIEM tool by the 
ticket number and simple name so that when the system does generate an alert that 
gets ticketed you will have an easy reference. For example “Virus found – 1337”, this 
would be an alert for a virus found but the use case ID leads you to find the ticket 
number 1337. Just a suggestion but having an easy-to-use reference system that ties 
your tickets back to each use case its generated from is an invaluable reference for 
the SOC (and for auditors) to have.
Next you will want to describe your use case; this should be a detailed description 
of not only what the use case is but how it is going to work and why you need it. You 
want to start with a justification or a short statement as to what the problem is that 
you are trying to solve. For example, if you have a use case that is designed to detect 
brute force attacks against your users passwords in active directory, you might state 
that since password cracking tools have become so efficient and that computers have 
become extremely fast that the detection of brute force password guessing or the 
rapid creation of invalid logon attempts need to be detected quickly to interrupt any 
unauthorized attempts to gain access to the organizations systems. Your organization 
may have a policy that locks accounts out after three failed password attempts but 

38
CHAPTER 2  Identify your customers
this does not stop the usage of a use case like this since an attacker may not know 
that policy is in place. The description does not have to be very long; it just needs to 
state the facts.
You will also want to detail any specific stakeholders or any interested parties that 
the use case would affect. For example, in the case of a virus, it may affect an end 
user or a server system. In those cases, there are two separate groups that may need 
to get involved and need to be notified. If the virus infects a desktop then there may 
be a desktop or helpdesk support system that needs to get an alert from the SOC so 
that they can resolve the issue. On the other hand, if it is a virus on a server it may be 
a specific server team that needs that information and may even need some incident 
response or remediation support from the SOC to perform containment and cleanup. 
Either way, it is good to detail who would be the primary stakeholder groups or teams 
in these cases. It will help coordinate escalations when needed and can lead analysis 
and incident response managers in the right direction when they reference other SOC 
documentation like escalations trees or incident response communication plans that 
we will talk about later.
Lastly, a SOC will want to detail any rules, tools, or processes used in the detec-
tion and creation of a ticket for the specific event. As a best practice policy, it is al-
ways good to directly copy or make a screen shot of the actual rules or signatures that 
are configured in the security devices. This way not only do you have a complete use 
case documented but also that use case can become a nice reference document. Each 
and every time you need to update the rule or signature you can document that update 
by updating the use case documentation and the ticket. This is a great change control 
process and can also save you in a pinch when something goes terribly wrong, as it 
is also a kind of off line backup to your rules.
Here are a few examples of some simple use cases that the SOC can use to help 
monitor and manage the security of an organization. This is not intended to be a 
complete list, instead it is just a few basic services that the SOC can provide detailed 
in a simple format. Your organization may need something more robust as far as the 
format is concerned but if you are just getting started then this should be a great list 
to get you going in the right direction.
USE CASE: UNAUTHORIZED MODIFICATION OF USER ACCOUNTS
Description: In our environment, we do not have a good way to track which admin-
istrative account is authorized to add, delete, or modify user accounts. According 
to our regulatory requirements, we need to ensure that all user modifications are 
appropriate and have the correct approvals in place. This rule is designed to capture 
evidence of user modifications that take place by administrators that are not autho-
rized to make those changes. There is no need to escalate these events, all violations 
will be documented in a report sent to the primary stakeholders and interested parties 
listed below monthly.

39
﻿ Stakeholders: HR and IT
STAKEHOLDERS: COMPLIANCE AND AUDIT DEPARTMENTS
Detect condition: The servers that maintain all the primary user accounts for the or-
ganization have been configured and validated to generate appropriate logs to signify 
an addition, deletion, or modification to any and all user accounts. Lists of these log 
types and codes have been placed inside a rule for the SIEM tool to monitor for. A 
list of administrative accounts will be maintained who are the authorized individuals 
that are allowed to make user changes and modifications. These admins will be put 
on a list in the SIEM tool so that any account modification they make will not result 
in an alert. The SOC will still be able to run reports from the operating systems logs 
collected for all administrative account actions but no alerts will be generated for any 
admins on the authorized list.
Rule: Unauthorized modification of user accounts
If administrative account is not in “authorized administrators” list
& (Windows event or *nix event list)
Then create ticket
USE CASE: DISABLED USER ACCOUNT REACTIVATED
Description: It is organizational policy that user accounts are retained for 90 days 
after an individual leaves. This is due to management issues or legal issues and IT 
has been instructed to retain these accounts. As such, the organization may have 
many accounts that are disabled, which present a risk to the organization. In order to 
ensure that insider threats or attackers are not able to take advantage of these disabled 
accounts the SOC will be monitoring the accounts for unusual activity.
STAKEHOLDERS: HR AND IT
Detect condition: The servers that maintain all the primary user accounts for the or-
ganization have been configured and validated to generate appropriate logs to signify 
an when an account is disabled and when an account is re-enabled. Lists of these 
log types and codes have been placed inside a rule for the SIEM tool to monitor for. 
Any account that gets disabled will automatically be placed on a “Temporary dis-
abled user list.” The temporary list will place the account on a 24-h hold to prevent 
false positives as sometime people lock out their accounts with excessive incorrect 
password attempts. After 24 h,, the account information will come off the hold list 
and get placed on a disabled account list. When an account is re-enabled the SIEM 
rule will look at the temporary list first, if the account is there then it will not do any-
thing, if not on that list, it will look on the disabled user list. If the account is found 
on the disabled list then an alert will be generated and a ticket created for the SOC 
to investigate.

40
CHAPTER 2  Identify your customers
Rule #1: User disabled
If user account is disabled (Windows event)
Then place account name in SIEM “Temporary disabled account list”
Rule #2: Disabled temporary hold
If user account has been on “temporary disabled account list” > 24 h
Then delete account from “temporary disabled account list” and add to 
“disabled account list”
Rule #3: Disabled user account re-activated
If user account is enabled (Windows event)
& Account is not the “Temporary disabled account list”
& Account is on the “disabled account list”
Then create ticket
USE CASE: ANY IDS EVENT THAT SCORES OVER  
A SEVERITY OF 7
Description: IDS/IPS events happen on a regular basis, as such every effort has been 
made to tune the IDS/IPS system directly to provide the best threat information as 
possible. Additionally each event in the IDS/IPS systems has been configured with a 
reasonable priority or severity level. These severities have been assigned by engineer-
ing to ensure that signatures that are triggered have the correct value assigned to them 
as related to the devices they are configured to protect as well as according to the 
organizational and business risks. This rule will detect any event with a severity rat-
ing of 7 or greater and will trigger and event for the SOC to analyze and respond to.
Stakeholders: IT System owners
Detect condition: IDS/IPS events with a severity rating greater than 7
Rule: IDS alert
(IDS/IPS Signature) > = 7
USE CASE: AV FAILURE
Description: Malware remains a reliable tool for attackers and the primary way at-
tackers are able to breach inside network boundaries. As such, the direct installation 
of malware by an attacker remains to be the single common risk vector for an orga-
nization. Successfully finding, containing, and removing malware not detected by 
antivirus software from our network involves a series of steps and must be addressed 
properly. There are several rules in this use case that will be used to alert the SOC 
to perform an investigation. Antivirus is not enough to combat this issue, so several 
open source and close source intelligence feeds will also be used to help detect mali-
cious activity.

41
﻿ Use case: security device outage
STAKEHOLDERS: DESKTOP SUPPORT TEAM, IT SERVER 
MANAGEMENT TEAMS
Detect condition: The first way that we will detect malware is by identifying traffic 
from one of our internal address going to a known malicious destination. This will be 
accomplished by regular downloads of malicious IP address and domain names from 
our reliable sources, both free and subscription based. The SIEM will be configured 
to evaluate all external firewall traffic against these lists. If any internal system com-
municates with an IP address or domain name on that list then an alert will be gener-
ated and a ticket created for the SOC to analyze.
The organization’s antivirus system also generates a number of different alerts 
based off the policies set by security engineering. The system will alert on the detec-
tion of malware, but in some cases, the malware is automatically cleaned. In other 
cases, the malware is detected but cannot be cleaned for various reasons. It is im-
perative that every system be cleaned of malware and before it spreads beyond a set 
number of hosts. The rules below detail how we are going to detect a system internal 
to our organization communicating with a malicious host as well as when a system 
gets a virus that is not cleaned or when we have a potential outbreak of the same virus 
on five or more systems.
Rule:
Rule #1: Load and fire, lists of bad IP address and domains
Add Malicious IP and domains to list “Bad list”
If (from firewall log) Any internal IP communicates with “Bad list”
Then create ticket
Rule #2: Virus found
If alert = “virus found” & Status = “not cleaned” or “left alone”
Then create ticket
Rule #3: Potential virus outbreak
If alert = “virus found” & Status = “not cleaned” or “left alone”
Add to list “Virus infection”
If “Virus infection” list contains > = 5 count of same virus
Then create ticket
USE CASE: SECURITY DEVICE OUTAGE
Description: Monitoring the health of all the logs and events that feed a SIEM or 
that are received into a SOC ticketing system is vital to the success of the operation. 
Without logs and events, the SOC is blind and will not be able to detect any signifi-
cant events. Systems can stop sending logs for a number of reasons. One of the worst 
reasons is that after an attacker gains access and control over a system, one of the very 
first things they will try and do is cover their tracks and they want to hide their actions 
so they will accomplish this by turning off logging. Other reasons could be that the 

42
CHAPTER 2  Identify your customers
system stopped responding, crashed, or that there is a network outage causing the 
problem. Either way, rules are created so that when logs stop after a preset time limit 
an alert will be generated. Systems are configured into three different groups, high, 
medium, and low. Devices in the high group are expected to constantly log so any loss 
of logs greater than 5 min will trigger an alert, whereas a medium is one day and a 
low will be 3 days. Once an alert is generated and a ticket created the SOC will begin 
investigation and analysis. Additionally there will be devices that maybe only send a 
log once every few months such as backup firewalls or failover proxies, in this case, a 
permanent suppression will be created to prevent false positive tickets being created. 
Any device not designated as high, medium, or low will not be ticketed against.
Note: Depending on your SIEM, there can be several ways to configure this type 
of alert, some may be fancier where others may not have the capability at all. You 
cannot provide security monitoring for devices that do not send you logs.
STAKEHOLDERS: SECURITY AND IT
Detect condition: If a system is configured to send logs, it will be rated high, me-
dium, or low. These ratings are based on the expected number of logs over the time 
period configured and is not a priority or severity associated with the device itself, 
just an expected log frequency.
Rule#1: Security device outage
If device = “High” and log count = 0 in 5 min
Then create ticket
Rule#2: If device = “Medium” and log count = 0 in 24-h
Then create ticket
Rule#3: If device = “Low” and log count = 0 in 72-h
Then create ticket
USE CASE RULE SUMMARY
The use cases just described are basic in nature, they are a good example of the 
simple items that a SOC is going to have configured and be able to monitor for on 
a daily basis. It also demonstrates a nice and easy way to document your use cases 
that you can share with your customers and auditors but also use the documentation 
to review with stakeholders, engineers, and security researchers in your organization 
to ensure you are configured to capture the right types of events for the right reasons. 
The documentation is also a great reference for your SOC analysts and great train-
ing information for new SOC employees. Also if you encounter any issues or you 
discover that the tools are not triggering on the right thresholds or you are not seeing 
the right kinds of logs then it will give you an opportunity to review the logic in your 
use case and match it up against the configuration of all the systems involved in an 
effort to resolve any issues in configuration. Many times I will add flow charts and 

43
﻿ Use case rule summary
diagrams to use cases so that all the rules can be seen together and the logic and flow 
of the information is presented in an organized and relevant way.
There are plenty of resource on the internet that will not only give you great ideas 
on what rules and use cases to build but they will even tell you the types of devices 
you need to collect logs from and what specific events you need to be looking for in 
order to make the use cases and rules work properly. Just as a quick added benefit, 
here are a few other items the SOC can get tickets for that you may want to think 
about configuring and creating use cases for. Again, not a complete list but just a few 
extra items to start off the conversation on what is right for your SOC and what types 
of use cases you can build for your rules.
• 
Malicious SQL commands issued by external, internal users, or administrators
• 
Cross site scripting attempts
• 
Transmission of PCI, PII, ePHI data in plain text.
• 
Resource access outside business hours.
• 
Sensitive resource access failure by user.
• 
Privileged user access to sensitive resource
• 
User logged in locally and on VPN at the same time
• 
User logged into VPN from foreign country
• 
Brute force authentication attacks
• 
SSH, LDAP, NetBIOS, and so on.
• 
Distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS)
• 
Common network attacks (e.g., IP spoofing, hijacking attempts, etc.)
• 
Acceptable Use Policy violations
• 
Anonymous proxy use, BitTorrent, P2P, and so on.
Rules are not the only time you will want to build use cases. Reports can be an-
other great item to document for auditors as well as customers and even for manage-
ment. By documenting your reports into a use case, you can make sure that everyone 
understands the data that they can get from the SOC but once they get it they can 
have a reference as to what it actually means and how the information was derived. 
Having some context as to what information a report is showing or not showing is 
very important especially when you are trying to get key messages across to your 
customers. Although you may perfectly know how a report is generated, do not as-
sume that everyone else does. We will discuss later in the chapter on metrics you can 
get pretty lost in reporting. Having well-documented use cases for your reports are 
not only professional but will also help clear up a lot of confusion. Take for example 
a simple report of the top vulnerabilities detected on your organizations network. You 
may think this is a simple report but how do you calculate the top? Is it the number 
of times an individual vulnerability is seen across the network of devices or is it the 
most critical and subsequently the highest priority vulnerabilities detected? Were 
there any filters to the report, such as only Windows devices or only desktops or was 
it the entire network. Often when I go into a new SOC environment I start to look 
at reports and metrics and have no idea what they are tracking. It takes a while to 
understand it all and to understand what the SOC is trying to report on and why. The 

44
CHAPTER 2  Identify your customers
reports need to be designed to be factual and supportive of the data and the informa-
tion it presents. It is not meant to pinpoint failures or to call out individuals that may 
not be doing their jobs. Ensure you work with your customers to get the right data 
built into your use cases for reporting before you start sending graphs and charts 
around. People may get the wrong idea of what you are trying to do, make sure you 
are viewing the reporting process as a service you are providing. Here are a few use 
cases for reports as some food for thought, the use cases are written as service docu-
ments and detail how the SOC supports the data and the efforts.
USE CASE: TOP VULNERABILITIES DETECTED IN THE NETWORK
Description: The top vulnerabilities detected report is a series of several data points 
consolidated into a single page of relevant graphs. The first graph is a list of the top 
10 vulnerabilities recommended for priority remediation on the network. This is a 
filtered list of the highest priority vulnerabilities detected on the highest number of 
individual systems. For each vulnerability, the number of hosts affected is shown. 
The list is sorted so that the highest number of systems detected for that vulnerability 
is at the top of the list. Implementing the remediations necessary to eliminate these 
vulnerabilities will have the greatest impact in significantly decreasing the vulner-
ability and risk to the network and the overall organization.
The second graph is a listing of the 10 most vulnerable subnets in the organi-
zation. This graphed report demonstrates where in the organization the most risks 
from vulnerabilities are currently residing. Subnets on this report need to have patch 
processes reviewed or have focused efforts to upgrade and patch the systems in those 
areas. The report is unfiltered and includes all devices grouped only by the IP subnet 
they reside on.
Third graph is a list of the top 10 devices that have the most vulnerabilities de-
tected. This is an interesting chart to highlight systems that may have been forgotten 
or that are having issues and need specific attention to be remediated.
Last we will include a report of the least number of devices with open ports in 
an effort to detect anomalous services. Ports that are only open on a small limited 
number of unrelated systems could indicate the presence of malware or unauthor-
ized applications running malicious services. The combination of all of these reports 
detail systems that are currently the most vulnerable and should be patched updated 
or removed from the network as soon as possible.
STAKEHOLDERS: SECURITY, IT, AUDIT, AND MANAGEMENT
Report notes: Vulnerability scanning activities run on a 30-day rotation. All systems 
are scanned and data are refreshed every 30 days. The details of the report will be 
published and be made available for all interested parties and stakeholders every 

45
﻿ Use case reporting summary
30 days. If any teams or departments are involved in remediation activities, the SOC 
will support those efforts with ad-hoc scans and individualized reports to aid in the 
cleanup efforts. Additionally the SOC is available to discuss any issues or techni-
cal concerns related to the patching or applying of remediation’s detailed in these 
reports.
USE CASE REPORTING SUMMARY
Without going through many different examples I think you get the idea. Ensure 
your reports make sense. Make sure you have the right detail and that your filters 
and criteria for your graphs are easy to understand and transparent. Here are a 
few others with short descriptions to help you get started in your reporting use 
cases.

CHAPTER 2  Identify your customers
EXPECTATIONS
A SOC is the primary team responsible for the active monitoring of an organizations 
infrastructure as part of an overall security department, security strategy, outsourced 
provider or a trusted third-party partner. It should be the expectation of any organiza-
tion that the SOC has to be aware of any security situations that affects the organi-
zation it is charged with protecting, it is responsible for the monitoring of logs and 
security alerts and to facilitate required communication and remediation of analyzed 
incidents. But it cannot do everything alone; it is the entire organization and every-
one in it that has the responsibility to maintain security. The organization for which 
a SOC functions in should have very specific expectations of what the SOC does 
and how. The SOC must be fully integrated into the larger organization, not just the 
larger security organization or even IT but the entire organization with transparent 
and easy information flow and involvement in business activities. Information about 
the organization needs to freely flow through the SOC in order to ensure that relevant 
information for detecting incidents is acted upon. As organizations continually fund 
the SOC, the expectations for results climb. The SOC needs to provide trained ana-
lysts in all areas important to the organization from managing malware infections to 
forensic analysis and intelligence gathering. The SOC needs to be on its toes and be 
capable of agile and dynamic incident response and be seasoned at handling certain 
types of incidents that are ultimately important to the organization. The SOC has to 
have great communication skills in order to bring cross-functional teams from many 
different departments together to work cohesively in the effort to resolve incidents. 
It is an easy measure of how successful a SOC is by how it is able to dynamically 
change membership of its incident handling teams and easily integrate people from 
all areas of the organization from one incident to another and be able to manage 
many different incidents all at different phases all at once. Integration of the team is 
essential to be effective in quickly addressing, containing, and remediating incidents 
in an organization and it should be the expectation of the organization that the SOC 
would drive this. Another important characteristic of an expectation an organization 
should have on a highly functioning and effective SOC is transparency. In order to 
be a good communicator and team player, the SOC must share its information. It 
should share its tools, data, reports, and any information it has that could benefit the 
organization as a whole or in part. For example, vulnerability-scanning tools have a 
great amount of valuable information in them, providing reports may not be enough. 
In the spirit of transparency and being good corporate citizens the SOC should share 
the vulnerability tools with the teams responsible for remediation. Let them have ac-
cess, let them run their own reports and let them self-serve the information they need 
to be successful. Controlling who can run actual scans may be required but limiting 
access to information creates more problems than it solves. During attacks it should 
be expected that the SOC would share information about what is going on as well 
as the overall security of the business with all the members and stakeholders of the 
incident team and management. Holding back information will only serve to alienate 
groups; the flow of information needs to be proper and candid so that sound business 

47
﻿ Expectations
decisions can be made. Security does not have to be secret internally to an organiza-
tion or even externally in the proper forum and sharing environment.
There are a great many expectations that should be placed on a SOC in how it 
executes, in how it communicates and in how it protects an organization. The SOC 
you build should be as open as possible, be integrated into the organization and most 
of all transparent in its efforts.

CHAPTER 3  Infrastructure
When building a SOC, you not only need to think about all the security tools, sys-
tems, and infrastructure needed to protect your organization but you also need to 
think about all that is needed to support the center as well as the infrastructure the 
team is going to use to do its job. There are three specific and distinct areas of infra-
structure that you must look at when planning your SOC.
• 
Support infrastructure
This infrastructure is really your SOC’s eyes, ears, nose, and throat. These are all 
the things a SOC needs in order to be able to maintain access to and interact with all 
the other infrastructure devices, assets, and tools. If required, this will also contain 
the needed systems to maintain visual representation of real-time statistics such as 
video walls and projectors so that the SOC can react and be sensitive to potentially 
negative statistic fluctuations. These are the items along with other physical equip-
ment that you would mostly find inside the SOC being used by the staff.
• 
Organizational security infrastructure
This infrastructure consists of the technology that is needed to protect your orga-
nization. This includes all the items out in the wilds of your network that need tender 
loving care and need to be reviewed by experts to ensure nothing bad is going on. 
This is the nuts and bolts of your security footprint and can consist of many, many 
different types of technologies applied in many different ways all in the effort to pro-
tect your organizations confidentiality, availability, and integrity, the triad of security 
goals. Your SOC may own and manage all or some of these devices or may just be 
the recipient of the systems technical output or logs.
• 
Operation center infrastructure
This is where we are going to spend most of our time in this chapter. Infrastructure 
needed to support your SOC is vital to your organizations security success. There are 
a lot of things to consider, a lot of important tools to review, and there are many dif-
ferent philosophies on how to approach these different topics. Typically these are the 
things that the SOC needs to operate but may be installed at remote locations, inside 
a data center or somewhere outside the physical SOC location.
The first area that we need to address is obviously your organization’s overall 
security infrastructure; this includes any IDS, firewalls, web proxy systems, antivi-
rus, data loss prevention systems, and so on that the SOC might be using or are even 
responsible for maintaining, see Appendix B. Second you need to look at any special 
requirements for servers the SOC will need such as the ticketing systems, a security 
event management system or any other specialized tools needing separate servers. You 
also need to consider if the SOC will operate its own private protected network and 
what impact that will have. Lastly you need to think about all the equipment your ana-
lysts and engineers will need. This includes not only the Macs or PCs at their desktops 
but also any video projectors, special monitors, or even separate Internet connections. 
All three of these technical areas, organizational security infrastructure, SOC infra-
structure, and SOC support infrastructure must be addressed when building your SOC.

51
﻿ Organizational security infrastructure
ORGANIZATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE > OPERATIONS 
INFRASTRUCTURE > SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE
If you ever thought you could just sit back and wait for the screen to tell you some-
thing bad happened on your network or with a host system and have lights and sirens 
go off when someone accesses something they should not, then you are about to have 
a rude awakening. In most cases, there is no silver bullet to security that will show 
you an attack has taken place. Most times to catch the bad guy an analyst will need 
to be patient and also be very determined not to give up looking for that “needle in a 
hay stack” that will lead them to find security issues needing to be addressed. When 
it comes to building a SOC, it can be as simple as one person looking at an IDS all 
day long or it can be as complex as a disperse team of 2500 people all managing and 
maintaining hundreds of different types of devices around the world. In either case, 
large or small, you have to take into consideration the same three areas of infrastruc-
ture when you are building your SOC.
ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE
As defined above, the organizational infrastructure deployed at the enterprise level 
is the actual infrastructure you are going to use to protect all the required areas of 
your organization. These are the devices and technology that will be deployed across 
the entire enterprise in key locations that will perform the actual job of protecting, 
detecting, or stopping malicious behavior or attacks. This can be the firewall used at 
the perimeter or in your network or even at third-party companies and cloud service 
providers all the way to the antivirus software on a user’s endpoint computer. When 
you look at a defense-in-depth approach to security, you will find many different 
systems that all need to be managed and monitored by trained security profession-
als to ensure they all work and are configured properly, they are being looked at and 
important alerts are being addressed. This section is not here to help you design or 
build the security of your network. Instead it is here for you to get a feeling, appreci-
ate, or to help others understand the daunting task your SOC may face in managing 
and monitoring your organizations security. Some people believe that it is not a big 
deal to run a SOC, you just sit in front of the computer and read whatever the screen 
tells you and then call someone. I wish it was that easy because then we would not  
see so many data breaches in the news. When we look at a typical organizational 
security infrastructure, some people like to talk in terms of a defense-in-depth 
strategy because it is easy to break down the things needed for security into areas 
that will be deployed on the network infrastructure.
Let us take a quick look at some of the organizational security infrastructure that 
would be needed at various levels of that defense-in-depth strategy. This is not a com-
plete or exhaustive list but rather just a sampling to help your thought process around 
what is really going to be needed by your SOC if you have to manage, maintain, or 
monitor all this stuff. Keep in mind that I am not going to explain the function of 

52
CHAPTER 3  Infrastructure
these devices but rather how these technologies are viewed from a SOC perspective 
or how they would integrate, be managed by, or be utilized within your SOC.
PERIMETER DEFENSES
At your perimeter, there are a few different types of technologies that you may want 
to use. But first understand that the perimeter is where your organizations control 
and management stop and some other service provider, business partner, or untrusted 
connection begins. The security model here is to prevent as much getting into your 
network as possible and detect all that you can if you cannot specifically stop it.
The first type of device in this area that you may think of is a firewall. Firewalls 
are vital to a SOC, they can tell you a lot about what is going on and what is com-
ing into your network. The logs from a firewall need to be collected and analyzed, 
they are where you are going to find performance issues related to denial of service 
attacks, attempts by systems to violate access rules or devices being denied access 
due to many other reasons. But it is not always what is being denied on your firewall 
that is important. You almost always need firewall logs to help you determine the 
real IP address of an external system that is accessing your network if you are using 
Network Address Translation. When you translate real routable internet addresses to 
internal non-Internet routable addresses, you have to have a way to lookup the rela-
tionship to determine who is doing what. Without your firewall logs, the SOCs task 
of translating back and forth is going to be nearly impossible.
Next, we can think about a VPN or remote access system, this is where members 
of the organization will connect from outside the network to access internal resourc-
es. It is vital to maintain this system to ensure appropriate access is granted to users 
and that when people leave or no longer need the access it is revoked or taken away. 
So, monitoring users that access this resource is very important but also looking at 
where someone is accessing the system from may be even more important. If you 
see someone logging into the VPN from half-way around the world but they are cur-
rently in the office and you just saw them getting a cup of coffee then you may have 
a problem. Your SOC should be able to utilize these basic systems to gain valuable 
visibility into what security issues may be impacting your organizations network 
perimeter and who may be getting unauthorized access. Of course there are many 
more devices like proxy servers you may find in the perimeter of your network but 
let us move on.

53
﻿ Host defenses
NETWORK DEFENSE
The next ring or layer deep in your defense strategy is the internal network. This is 
the internal portion of your organization that communicates together in potentially 
one or more different segments or areas. Security-relevant items you will typically 
find here are things like intrusion detection or prevention systems, network access 
control (NAC) systems, along with data loss prevention systems and behavioral or 
anomaly detection systems. IDSs should be set up wherever there is a network seg-
ment that can communicate with another network segment and data traffic passes 
between those two different networks or areas. This will act like a choke point and 
allow you to see all the network traffic that are successfully passed and evaluated by 
signatures internal to the IDS and determined if anything was bad or not. This could 
be traffic such as hackers trying to exploit vulnerabilities. The output of the IDS is 
vital for the SOC to review and evaluate but to also manage and to keep the system 
updated with the latest signatures to detect bad network traffic. NAC systems are also 
great at helping to prevent systems that are not owned by the organization to connect 
to an internal network. The SOC should keep a close eye on the changes to a network 
and what devices are connected or not connected. An attacker does not need to be 
outside the network in some far off place, they could be inside an organization’s own 
four walls trying to get access to data and resources or they could be from an unat-
tended conference room. Logs and alerts from these types of systems are important 
information that should be collected and analyzed by the SOC, this could also in-
clude systems that attempt to connect to any wireless networks or try to impersonate 
the real wireless network the organization is running.
HOST DEFENSES
Quickly thinking about host defenses you would want your SOC to manage and monitor 
would include systems like antivirus, device controls for USBs or host-based data loss 
prevention systems. When antivirus software detects the presence of a virus there are a 
number of things that happen, one of which is hopefully cleaning the virus. But often 
times there are viruses that get detected that cannot be cleaned. There are many reasons 
for this but more importantly there has to be some notification of this type of condition 
that gets back to the SOC so that manual intervention can take place and the impacts of 
the virus will not cause any real issues. Often viruses are designed to steal data or open 
up doors to allow attackers easier access into protected networks. When data are going 
to leave your network, you should evaluate them to ensure they are supposed to leave 
and that they are being sent by the right person who has permission to send it and that 
its going to a known or reliable destination. Data loss prevention systems can operate 
at the network level and the host level, these systems are configured with rules to detect 
important data that an organization owns and ensure it is being moved across a network 
properly. The rules that these systems operate with have to be maintained and alerts for 
violations of those rules need to be reviewed and acted upon by the SOC.

54
CHAPTER 3  Infrastructure
APPLICATION DEFENSES
Applications that perform critical functions or store important data for your organiza-
tion need to be protected as well. These applications can live almost anywhere in your 
network at your organization from individual hosts to primary servers or mainframe 
computers. This is a fairly large and broad area for security as there are many differ-
ent considerations in how to protect different applications but also for how a SOC 
would interface with those protection systems. It is important that applications are 
patched, a SOC that runs regular vulnerability scans should be able to detect when an 
application is out of date with its patches and escalate that information as a notifica-
tion to the application owner in order to get it updated. Viruses, shellcode, and other 
malicious logic can take advantage of your applications and make them do things 
that they were not supposed to. Being able to detect when application files are inap-
propriately being modified or when a user keeps trying their password over and over 
again 1000 time per second are all things that the SOC needs to be on the look out for.
DATA DEFENSE
You have all these layers of defense but it all comes down to the data and the re-
sources storing that data. What kind of protections will you put in place to protect 
your data? Will you use file and volume encryption on your endpoint devices, secure 
vaulting on your servers, special group access, or even physical protections? Regard-
less of how you decide to protect your data, someone has to watch and react to alerts 
or modify the systems rules as needed.
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
Although not as technical as a ring like we have just been reviewing, policies and 
procedures will have large impacts to not only how your SOC operates but also what 
they are able to do and how they will do it. When you have a web proxy in place to 
protect your users from going to malicious sites, your SOC needs to review those 
events to ensure there are no infected systems with malicious software causing sys-
tems to access bad websites but your organization may also have policies on what 
can be download or what an employee is allowed to view on their computer. If you 
have a policy that says nobody is allowed to research guns and weapons while at 
work on a work computer then it may be the responsibility of your SOC to catch that 
and to properly report it to the HR department. There are many other policies and 
procedures that will impact the operation of your SOC, carefully review what your 
organization has and see what can be included into the SOC as part of their business 
objectives and help business controls. The policies and procedures will touch every 
aspect of not only how the SOC operates but how devices are configured, tuned, and 
deployed to protect against.

55
﻿ Security architecture
SECURITY ARCHITECTURE
Now that we have talked about some of the enterprise level devices and organization-
al infrastructure out there that your SOC may be responsible for or get information 
from we need to talk about how this all comes together. If you were starting off from 
scratch or if you really need to take a good look at what you have and want to make 
sure you have the right equipment to protect your network, you would need the help 
of a security architect. This is someone who understands the needs and goals of the 
organization and who has a good understanding of where potential weaknesses could 
be. They will then work to recommend technology or configurations of existing sys-
tems to improve the overall security posture of a network. They will work with the 
larger IT organization to purchase, configure, and install security products that will 
monitor and protect the infrastructure. The architect should design countermeasures 
for different types of attacks such as unauthorized user access, data loss, hacking, 
malware, and many others. It is worth mentioning this role here because it is vital 
to the organization but will not always be a part of the typical SOC unless you are 
an MSSP. In many MSSPs, you will indeed find or should find security architects in 
the SOC. This does not mean that architects cannot be a part of the SOC but they are 
typically part of a larger security organization and will work along with the SOC to 
identify areas of weakness or areas that need improvement. These architects need to 
be responsible for understanding industry standards and best practices and be able 
to convert those to realistic technical controls. They have to keep up with not only 
networking trends but also emerging security technology as it relates to your core 
organizational security needs. They should be able to work effectively to help an or-
ganization design, size, and scale security solutions specific to organizational needs 
on a project by project basis or as part of an overall security strategy. Your architect 
will know what tools are out there to achieve security goals.
There is too much security technology that can be implemented at an organization 
to be covered in this one small chapter. Whether it is the access management system, 
network-based intrusion system, or core information technology infrastructure, you 
have to understand the size of the overall infrastructure you are protecting in order to 
make the right decisions on sizing your security solutions to be implemented. Basic 
example of this is if you plan to implement an access management system, you need 
to know how many users you have so that you can install the software on the right 
sized hardware meaning, memory, hard disk drive, as well as processing power, then 
you need to buy enough licenses to cover all of your users who will be accessing the 
system.
In keeping with the same example when we start to look at the structure required 
to run your SOC, we also need to know what the expectations are for the SOC in 
utilizing the implemented organizational security infrastructure. The requirements 
for your SOC will be very different if your access management system is fully auto-
mated opposed to a system where the SOC will be managing access grants and revo-
cations from the system. You also have to consider if the access management system 
will talk to other systems such as sending logs to an SIEM infrastructure. So, for each 

56
CHAPTER 3  Infrastructure
IT system implemented in your organization, you need to have an honest and open 
discussion about what needs to be protected how it is to be protected and what the 
expectations are for the SOC in protecting those systems. For some companies, this 
is a standard risk assessment. In many cases, there may be systems where the SOC 
may not be directly responsible for managing such as a web server, but there may be 
very real and specific requirements for the SOC to protect that web server from in-
trusions. Different organizations will employ different technologies for this purpose, 
all depending on the risk assessment of that device and the organizations desire to 
protect it. This could mean the implementation of application layer firewalls all the 
way to just collecting logs in a centralized log management system. But you do not 
need to boil the ocean when looking at your organizational infrastructure and how 
it is secured before you set up your SOC. You do, however, need to create a positive 
forum in your environment in which information technology, security, and business 
representatives can openly discuss what needs to be protected and what the risks are 
to an organization compared with the level of security currently being provided for 
a specific asset. Once you get a good idea about the entire organizational security 
infrastructure that needs to be either managed, control or utilized by your SOC can 
you then start to think about what is needed for your SOC in order to perform the job. 
Even if you think you have everything covered and you were correctly sized in your 
environment you still need to make sure that you allow enough capacity to grow. 
You want to make sure that as you develop your security infrastructure you are flex-
ible enough to scale up or even down depending on your company or organizational 
needs and financial condition.
SIEM/LOG MANAGEMENT
There are a ton of papers and books1 written on the topic of SIEM or just security 
event management, whichever you choose to call it. There are also a ton of papers 
and books written about log management. Since both are very heavily covered top-
ics there is no real reason to cover them in-depth in this book except for the fact that 
they are critical and extremely functional components to a SOC and deserve a review.
Years ago when the function of security was really just starting out people who 
were trying to protect a network from hackers would build a basic IDS or a file in-
tegrity checker. They would build this system, get it up and running, connect it to 
the right part of the network, and watch it like a hawk. Their eyes would be glued 
to the screen waiting for something to happen and then pounce on every alert like 
a cat chasing a mouse. After a while, it tends to get boring or you have to install 
several systems on different parts of your network and the review of the information 
gets very tedious. I am talking about a time when we did not have fancy graphical 
interfaces and webpages to look at. Everything was command line and stored in 
1NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log Management, which is available at http://csrc.nist.
gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.

57
﻿ SIEM/log management
files. When you have several different systems, going back and forth to each system 
looking for events and chasing down potential issues becomes difficult and very time 
consuming. To help resolve these issues programs were created to generate emails 
when changes were detected. Similar to the way email groups worked these mes-
sages could be sent for every alert or digest versions could be sent once a day. This 
helped make things a bit more manageable but there was just too much information 
to consume. Now, fast forward time to today where we have more advanced systems 
each with their own graphical interface, dashboards, and charts along with raw data 
visualizers, all viewed as a web page or inside a custom application, it does not make 
things any easier. Although these systems have come a long way to provide better 
value in managing their data and events, a typical security infrastructure can employ 
hundreds of different types of security systems, and thousands of rules that all gener-
ate an amazing number of events 24 h a day. To really manage these events properly 
you need to be able to prioritize and address as many of the most critical ones as 
close to near real time as possible. SIEM tools have really helped in this area. By cre-
ating a system that can consume events from hundreds of different types of devices 
and systems and then build rules around those events, the SIEM has become what is 
known as a force multiplier, meaning it can make a few people do the job of many. 
By collecting all these events and building rules around them, you can really ensure 
that your SOC works what you want as a priority and stays on top of events. The 
SIEM can handle reporting to your ticket system and even perform any additional 
communication or notifications you need. Today, a SOC that operates without some 
kind of a SIEM tool is seriously handicapped. A SIEM tool is one of the best ways to 
utilize security intelligence data to proactively monitor for suspicious indications of 
threats. Additionally a SIEM tool is going to be able to provide you a significant abil-
ity in metrics reporting and security analytics that may be required to not only spot 
problem areas but to also provide reports to management. I am not saying that every 
organization needs to go out and buy their SOC the best tool money can afford, and 
there are even some low cost if not free ones out there, you can definitely find cham-
pagne on a beer budget, but to not aggregate and collect events from your security 
tools into a central repository that has been built with your organizations workflow, 
priorities, and objectives in mind will significantly reduce the efficiency of your SOC 
and reduce the effectiveness of your overall security strategy.
Log management is a bit of a different story and I want to separate it out from SIEM 
because they are really two entirely different things. Some people believe or understand 
log management and SIEM to be relatively the same but they are really not and should 
not be considered the same in any way. I would like to place a clear definition on each 
for the purpose of how a SOC and your organization should view these systems.
SIEM should be considered as a system that is capable of the short-term collec-
tion and storage of security-relevant data and information that has functions and con-
trols to aggregate like events, correlate multiple events in a series or chain in order to 
build new security-relevant events to be investigated by trained security personnel. 
High speed and performance are going to be your two primary concerns for the hard-
ware running your SIEM solution.

CHAPTER 3  Infrastructure
Log management should be considered as a system that is capable of the long-
term protected collection and storage of complete raw event data that has advanced 
search and reporting capabilities for auditors to ensure compliance with organiza-
tional controls and for security personnel to perform forensic and historical research. 
Large storage and backup capabilities are going to be your areas of focus for your 
log management solution.
All too often I see organizations trying to use a log management system to per-
form the tasks that a SIEM was created to do and vice versa. This does not mean that 
the two types of systems do not have similar capabilities but they will usually ap-
proach the problems from different perspectives. A system that is designed to evalu-
ate events against hundreds of rules at high speeds will be a very expensive system 
to use as a log aggregation repository. A log management solution should be able to 
store logs at a much cheaper cost.
Let us look at a typical scenario where this difference can be expressed. When 
a hacker attacks a server, there can be hundreds of unique requests to that server 
being made and can typically be very noisy as far as the volume of events. In a log 
management system, this noise can be very difficult to see with thousands of other 
logs all being collected at the same time. With a SIEM tool, rules can be created to 
see this type of activity automatically and create a single new alert that notifies your 
SOC that a potential attack is in progress. A more difficult example of this may be 
an attacker who tries to disguise a server attack by initiating requests very slowly 
and waiting long amounts of time between attack requests. In this case, reviewing a 
single day or week’s worth of logs may not show you any recognizable trends, like 
a needle in the haystack. But with the right rules and properly trained SOC staff, 
they will be able to recognize these trends when they are analyzed over a week, or 
month inside a SIEM. The attackers source IP address may even be automatically 
captured by the SIEM tool immediately upon the first detected event and then as the 
attacker gets more aggressive or performs other threat-based events the system will 
automatically raise the criticality of what that IP address is doing on the network to 
raise the awareness, whereas the log management system will just simply collect all 
the events.
I do not want to diminish the needs of collecting logs at all, it is a vital part of 
any complete and robust security operation. You must be able to collect the right data 
in your logs, monitor for anomalies and store them for a reasonable amount of time. 
Not only do logs need to be collected they also need to be protected especially if an 
attacker is able to compromise a server. A log management system serves a great 
purpose as it gives you the ability to move log files off of a system so that an attacker 
who wishes to cover their tracks cannot alter those logs. This goes well beyond set-
ting permissions on a system log or encrypting the logs, it takes them well out of 
reach by ensuring they are safe on a completely separate system. Most all servers 
and systems today provide some kind of log or Syslog2 capability and these logs are

org/rfc/rfc3164.txt

what tell you something has gone wrong. The logs, regardless of how or if you col-
lect them will tell you very important information, if configured correctly. They can 
tell you when suspicious activities have occurred and that something requires further 
investigation, they can also tell you what an attacker is doing by recording their 
commands or actions. Last but not least, your logs can become the subject of legal 
proceedings and therefore should be captured and stored in a safe and sound place. 
Most larger organizations will have audit departments that will work with a SOC and 
will help provide guidance on what reporting they need, how long to store the logs 
and what kind of storage system is acceptable from a legal perspective.
SIEM and log management can become a very expensive, systems can generate 
a ton of logs and these logs take up huge amounts of storage. For larger systems, this 
could be billions of events per day and when designing a system, it is very easy to 
under estimate the space that would be required to keep these systems running. Typi-
cally auditors and regulators like to see storage of specific logs for a year or more, 
when looking at the storage needs for billions of daily events over the course of a 
year the storage will get expensive. A log management system will understand the 
long-term storage needs and will be able to address that with data compression and 
other interesting and inexpensive ways to achieve your goals. The storage needs can 
fluctuate depending on what you are doing and what investigations you are perform-
ing, for example, you may decide to pump up the log detail on a specific device to 
get more information temporarily, this can easily become a concern for storage. Ad-
ministrators of these systems have to closely monitor the size of the storage systems 
in the log management and SIEM environments to ensure they continue to operate 
properly. It is also worthwhile to note that as an organization grows systems, serv-
ers and networking equipment being used in an organization can grow in numbers 
or drastically increase in event rates, you need to take that into account and plan for 
storage growth in these tools and consistently revisit those plans. To help combat 
increasing log sizes and running out of storage, your SOC should work with your 
organization and auditors if you have them, to level set what is actually needed, and 
what can be removed from being captured in the logs. What is relevant and what can 
be eliminated are important items to review as some types of network devices and 
servers will allow you to select what types of events get logged and have the capabil-
ity to turn off what you do not want. By eliminating what you do not need will help 
you store those important events at a lower cost. Do not just collect everything, make 
sure that your SOC, engineering, and management work together to ensure you get 
what you need.
OPERATION CENTER INFRASTRUCTURE
TICKETING SYSTEMS
An issue tracking system or ticket system is a vital part of your operation center. 
You need to be able to create, update, and resolve reported issues as well as track 
work progress. Just using a single security tool in your infrastructure may not be 

60
CHAPTER 3  Infrastructure
sufficient to properly analyze an event, though using all of the tools you have avail-
able combined to effectively monitor the network will empower the analyst to be 
successful. Each analyst over time will develop his or her own style of monitoring. 
Using a ticketing system will allow for a central repository of all notes and data used 
to perform each events analysis. This will not specifically instruct an analyst on how 
to do a particular job but help contribute to a better understanding of work flow and 
best practices and will allow others to follow behind them, read their notes, and vali-
date their findings.
A ticket system can often also contain a knowledge base containing information 
on resolutions to common problems or may even have indicators about what true 
positive event looks like opposed to a false positive and can include ticket numbers 
that were previously solved as actual references. Consistent use of a ticket tracking 
system is considered one of the fundamentals of a good operation team. As such, 
we are going to spend some good time talking about different systems and what are 
some needed and optional components to your ticketing system for your SOC. This 
is such a vital resource to the SOC that you need to spend some good time thinking 
about what the requirements are before you implement anything. You need to know 
what the SOC team members will need and what kind of metrics you would like to 
get out of the system.
One of the primary features of a ticket system that you should look at is its ability 
to capture analyst’s notes. This is critical as you analyze events, you need to make 
sure that notes are properly captured, time stamped, and easy to follow. The flow of 
notes can be cumbersome, you need to make sure you know what works for you. One 
time I worked in a SOC that had a ticket system that took me forever to find notes, 
they were buried somewhere and you could only see one note at a time. So I had to 
open the note, see if it was the one I wanted, then close it and open another. Each 
opened a new screen, it was a huge hassle even after I figured out how it worked. 
Some systems make you click on every note to see what is written, whereas other 
system list out all the notes in a very long linier way then there are other systems that 
have separate notes but as you click on each a text box activates with the information 
that you can easily see.
If you have a lot of devices in your security infrastructure or are protecting a large 
device list then it may be important for you to have your ticket system include an as-
set database to collect information on devices under management or being protected 
by the SOC. This is optional as this can also be accomplished if your organization 
already has an asset database so your needs may vary. Having an asset database 
included in your ticket system may afford you additional automation, workflows or 
easier access to information customized inside every ticket.
An array of communication methods such as text, email, or SMS text is also a 
major requirement you should think about with your ticket system so that you can 
automatically notify people of required actions. Additionally you will want to see 
what other systems or integrations are possible with your ticket system. For example, 
maybe your ticket system can automatically communicate with a change database or 
asset database. This will help you deconflict issues that arise looking like a security 

61
﻿ Operation center infrastructure
problem but is really an authorized change. There may be many different types of 
communication integrations possible with your ticket system so spend some time 
evaluating the possibilities as this will only extend your capabilities and improve the 
performance of your SOC.
A good basic ticket system will allow team members to create new entries that 
are individually numbered for easy tracing, and then allow the members of the SOC 
to make free form text entries regarding a specific case, events, or issue. The ticket 
system should track who made the entry, what time and date the entry was made 
and allow for different ticket statuses. Ticket statuses can be as simple and as basic 
as open or closed but can be also be very complex and detailed such as “waiting for 
system administrator call back” or “escalated to management”.
Event analysis/investigation is a time-sensitive process and crucial information 
can be flushed or overwritten from security devices or sensors lacking large stor-
age devices. if the processes take too long to retrieve the information you need. 
No matter what, you are going to work against the clock if you are under attack 
and you want to reduce the impact of that attack. Quickly reacting to threats and 
attacks may allow you to get an intrusion prevention block in place or shut down a 
system to prevent the spread or escalation of an attack. The SOC needs to always 
perform work quickly, but not hastily. They should not have to think about the cur-
rent process and what the next steps should be, the ticket systems and workflows 
should be there to support them. In order to make your ticketing system work best 
for you, think about your events and what problems or malicious activities might 
cause a certain set of system alerts to be ticketed, then build your ticketing system 
to match those events and the workflow you will need to be the best at effective 
analysis, communication and ultimate conclusion of those events your SOC will 
address.
When an analyst has used all of the security tools available to them and deter-
mined that an incident has occurred or further validation is needed, entering infor-
mation into a ticket should always be the next feasible step an analyst will need to 
do. It is crucial that all of the information available is put in the event ticket that was 
generated or created and the information should be in great detail. Capture all of the 
logs, screen shots, and network flows as possible during the investigation and include 
it in the ticket. There should be no issue with information overload inside your tick-
eting system. The robust information you include in each and every ticket will only 
help when more than one person in the SOC gets assigned to work a ticket so that 
everyone can better understand what the original analyst was seeing or what they are 
basing decisions on. You should also consider that tickets may need to be reviewed 
hours, days, or even months after an incident and it can be difficult to remember all 
the gory details, good data in your ticket will help. Multiple people working a ticket 
is common as this can happen for example, if an event gets created during first shift 
and another analyst picks up and works the event on second shift. Or if an analyst 
needs to escalate a ticket to a more senior person such as an engineer, that second 
person who gets the escalation should not have to redo all the original research as all 
the required information needs to be in the ticket.

62
CHAPTER 3  Infrastructure
You should also consider using the concept of queues. This will allow you to 
split up your tickets into different areas for either team focus or organization. For 
example, you may want a general queue where all tickets get automatically created 
or created by your tier-1 analysts. Next you may want a separate engineering queue, 
this is where your analysts can place existing tickets that need the attention of the 
engineering team. This type of queuing will allow different teams to focus and see 
only the tickets they are concerned about and remove extra information and noise 
that they do not.
BUILDING THE TICKET SYSTEM
There are many different ticket systems out there to choose from. There are free 
and open source ticket systems and also very expensive ones that you can choose. 
From a technical or implementation perspective, there are many different decisions 
about features, functionality, licensing, support, and platform that you will need to 
consider.
But, before we dive deep into what your ticket system should look like or do for 
you, your first step should be to see if there is anything that is already being used in 
your organization that you could leverage and utilize for your own needs. It may be a 
very simple process and much cheaper to work with an already established system in 
your organization. By working inside an established system you can gain significant 
advantages as there may be existing support structures and knowledgeable people 
that you can work with on training, design and development in getting new queues 
and workflows built just for your SOCs use. By utilizing an existing ticket system 
you will be able to easily move tickets around your organization for when issues need 
to be addressed by teams outside your SOC or if issues arise that external teams want 
the SOC to address.
One drawback of using an existing system that you will need to ponder is the 
security and permissions of how the system is managed. What I mean by this is you 
need to carefully review who will have access to your tickets and your queues. For 
the most part having people who are not in the SOC look at tickets will not be a big 
deal but if your SOC is performing investigations on employees of the company 
then very tight controls will need to be placed on this data. Investigations in a SOC 
can and regularly will contain information about users but may not be because of 
something that a user directly did. For example, assume a user visited a normal and 
typical news website that happed to display a link or advertisement that was detected 
by your security infrastructure as malicious. An alert may be generated and a subse-
quent ticket created. Then inside this ticket, an investigation would be performed that 
would include the users browser activity, their system logs or antivirus scans plus a 
bunch of other things depending on your tool sets. All of this investigative activity 
would be performed to ensure that the computing assets and network components are 
safe and free of malware but will have little or nothing to do with the actual user. To 
the casual or mistaken uninformed onlooker, it could be interpreted that the user did 

63
﻿ Building the ticket system
something bad, rumors, and water cooler talk could start and even though the user 
may never have not known their activity was being investigated people around them 
could build an unfair negative opinion about them. Without going into another long 
example, imagine if the SOC was investigating someone for insider threat, stealing 
data, or unethical behavior. Bottom line is that if you are going to use a ticket system 
that is already widely used in your organization, make sure that access is well under-
stood, appropriate, logged, and controlled.
When you decide that you want to have your own brand new ticket system either 
because I scared you off from using the one your organization already has or there 
is nothing so you need to start from scratch anyway, the first thing you want to think 
about with a ticket system is its ease of use. An overly complex system or one that 
does not visually flow properly or make sense will be difficult to use and train people 
to be successful. The last thing you want is for investigations to get lost, and for your 
SOC to spend more time using and working the ticket system then analyzing security 
issues.
Next you will want to think about how you view information and may create dif-
ferent views to support various activities or different uses. For example, your main 
screen may show you a list of all open tickets but will give your SOC analysts the 
ability to sort those tickets by date created, criticality or any other criteria you want.
Here is a simple ticket view:

The ability to include tickets or give the SOC users the ability to change the 
filter of what is being displayed to different statuses may also be something you will 
want to consider. You might also want to allow for the inclusion of other fields to be 
viewed. This could be items like the last modified date, the name of the analyst that 
owns the ticket if it was previously opened and so on. When filtering you may want 
to only see tickets that are new and nobody has addressed yet, or maybe you want to 
only see tickets that you own or have been working on. Another option you may also 
want to think about are using different colors of text to help highlight critical tickets, 
new tickets, or a tickets that need some kind of special attention.
Here, is the simple example again but with color, the color can be automatic 
workflow built into your ticket system to help point what the priority events are 
based on criticality or some automated workflow logic. You will need to make sure 
you document your workflow so that everyone clearly understands what things mean 
and how it all happens. In the example below, the different colored text of ticket 1875 
may indicate that the ticket has been in a “NEW” status for too long and someone 

64
CHAPTER 3  Infrastructure
needs to open it and address it. While ticket 1882, that is all shaded in, may indicate 
a critical event that needs to be address before all others. Do not be afraid to use dif-
ferent colors to mean different things as long as you do not make it too complex. The 
idea is to be able to quickly highlight the important tickets when viewing a large list. 
At one SOC, the fact that tickets were red was not enough, they used the system’s 
ability to blink/flash the ticket text on and off to add an extra sense of urgency on that 
item. Hopefully your ticket system will be versatile enough for you to be creative on 
how to color coordinate your ticket views. Remember, make sure that the colors of 
all the views make sense and are easy to use or are customizable by the user to their 
preference.

The basic fields that you should have in your ticket system are fairly straightfor-
ward. Even though the various fields should be standardized, typically ticket systems 
are not designed for a SOC but rather a more general purpose like a help desk or call 
center, so there will be a fair amount of customization you will want to make and will 
need to think about. In addition to the various important fields of information, you 
may want to customize workflow to streamline a process or ensure compliance with 
required steps you want your analysts to take.
Let us take a look at some of the primary fields your SOC will rely on and may or 
may not be part of a standard ticket system installation.
SUBJECT
This may seem like a no brainer but the actual subject of a ticket is very important. 
When you are looking at the queue of your ticket systems, you may see rows and 
rows of tickets and if they all have the same subject then how would you know what 
ticket you need or would like to work on. The subject of the ticket can be passed 
to the ticket system by the device that generated the original event. In the case of a 
SIEM tool, you may even have the ability to customize this field’s value. If for ex-
ample you were sending IDS alerts directly to your ticketing system then the subject 
field may just be the name of the signature that fired such as “MSSQL Overflow”, 
“New server on network” or “Virus found”. If you are able to customize the out-
put of the system that generates an event or if you are going to manually create an 
event, try and keep the subjects standardized. This way, as you look through tickets 
or search historical tickets you will find it much easier to get what you want. Some 

65
﻿ Parsed values from events
SOC environments may want to have the source IP address of the device that caused 
the alarm as part of the subject. That way if you have multiple tickets with the same 
alert name you can quickly see if it is all coming being caused by the same device 
or multiple devices.
Example:

Once you are able to find a ticket you need to work on you should be able to 
select that ticket to begin work and perform your analysis. Once you select a ticket it 
should open up to the “ticket view”. This is a view where you can see all the impor-
tant elements of your event. It should be arranged in a way that is easy for an analyst 
to quickly assess the event and make quick decisions on what to do next. It could 
include asset information, and knowledgebase information all on the same screen as 
the basic event information.
In most cases, your event information and details should be on the top and the 
rest of the majority of the screen should be dedicated to allowing the analyst to make 
notes, upload documents, and perform actions on the ticket such as escalating it, 
changing its status, or even closing it.
PARSED VALUES FROM EVENTS
Your ticket system may have the ability to parse, chop, or read raw events that gets 
sent to it. When it reads these events, it can place key information into separate fields 
of the ticket. This is extremely valuable as it allows you to perform key reporting or 
search for specific elements of events and build metrics or to even spot trends. Values 
such as Source IP, Destination IP, Source Port, Destination Port, and of course the 
time the actual event occurred are all values that you should be able to read from a 
raw event and place into its proper place. Parsing can be valuable when you want 
to custom design your ticket view as we discussed above. Parsing events will allow 
you to put important data elements into the correct locations for easy viewing and 
searching.

66
CHAPTER 3  Infrastructure
TIME TICKET CREATED
For automatically generated tickets, the time a ticket is created is typically later than 
the actual time an event was generated. It takes some time for a security device on a 
remote network to generate a log, have that log get sent either directly to the ticketing 
system, or be processed in a central log management or correlation engine. Know-
ing the time difference between when an event was generated and when a ticket was 
created can be very important especially if the time difference is hours not seconds 
or minutes. This may indicate problems on your network or some difficulty in pro-
cessing. This lag is a metric that you should watch very carefully, it may help you to 
spot busy devices, or configuration errors with your security devices or even network 
congestion at a customer site. You need to learn what the normal deviation is and 
monitor or watch for any significant changes.
In the case of tickets that get manually generated, the ticket created time is also 
important because that will be the start of any event. This is where the timeline 
begins and without this it will be very difficult to figure out the chain of events 
when you start putting all your notes into the logs of the tickets. Sometimes ana-
lysts will do some research or complete an investigation prior to creating a ticket. 
Do not let this happen, anyone performing an investigation needs to have an open 
ticket first. This not only helps you track time people are spending on tickets 
doing analysis but it also allows your SOC supervisors the ability to watch the 
ticket queue to see who is working on what. Not only does it help them see what 
everyone is working on but if there is a ticket that stays open for a while it will 
allow the supervisor to check in with the analyst working on it to see what is go-
ing on and make sure they have all the resources they need and to make sure they 
are not dealing with a issues that will require additional attention from other SOC 
resources or engineers. Additionally if an analyst works an issue outside of the 
ticket system, you will lose track of what they are doing and will not know how 
to properly apply your resources. When an analyst is done with his research they 
may open a ticket and then just dump all their notes into that ticket and then close 
it. The results of that will make it look like they only had the ticket open for a 
minute but in reality they worked the issue reported inside that ticket for 2 h. It 
is very hard to capture the actual time worked on an individual ticket but as your 
build your system it is something you may want to keep in mind, or the system 
you select may have enhanced capabilities that allow you better visibility and 
reporting into how much time is actually spent on any given ticket. Time tracking 
systems built into your ticketing software can pay big dividends for you when cre-
ating metrics and evaluating your SOC. This is critical for resource planning and 
evaluating where bottlenecks may be in your processes. For more information on 
these types of metrics, refer to the chapter metrics. In the end, you really want to 
ensure your analysts are working inside the ticket system because things happen, 
documents get closed and information gets lost, or people get pulled in multiple 
directions and then it is difficult to go back to what you were doing if you did not 
keep accurate records.

67
﻿ User\group\queue
USER\GROUP\QUEUE
Tickets can be broken down and organized in many different ways. You need to make 
sure your organization of open tickets make sense and that they are easy to find, 
track, and address. All tickets except new tickets should be assigned to either a user 
or a queue. So when a new ticket is created, if it was created by a user, than that ticket 
should be assigned to that user automatically or if it was automatically generated 
then the ticket owner should be blank and it should be in a primary queue waiting 
for an analyst to open it and address it. If a ticket gets transferred to another group or 
queue then the ownership should be that queue until another user opens it. The his-
tory of actions, notes and ownership should all be logged and tracked inside the ticket 
for easy viewing. You may have different groups in your SOC such as your tier-1 or 
tier-2 analysts, engineering, or management and each of these groups should be a 
different ticket group in your ticket system.
Key point: The more granular the queue you can create the better metrics you can 
generate to see what is going on. But the more granular the queues, the harder it is for 
people to notice tickets that may be waiting for their attention. Make sure the division 
of groups and queues make sense for your workflow and reporting purposes.
Under each group there may be different queues for that group to organize tickets. 
Depending on your workflow you may only have one global queue for everyone to 
work out of but if you do have different requirements here is a quick example of what 
a group and queue structure may look like.
• 
Tier-1
• 
General queue (all new tickets)
• 
Health queue (security device or internal system issues)
• 
Waiting for callback (tickets that have been addressed but waiting on an 
external resource to call/email back)
• 
Tier-2
• 
Main escalation queue (location of general tickets that are being escalated to 
the tier-2 team)
• 
Health queue (security device or system issues)
• 
Waiting for callback (tickets that have been addressed but waiting on an 
external resource to call/email back)
• 
Engineering
• 
Main escalation queue (location of general tickets that are being escalated to 
the engineering team)
• 
Device based queues (individual queues based off of device type)
• 
Provision/decommission (location of tickets for the installation of new 
devices or the removal of old ones)
• 
Global issues (Tickets that effect overall service or delivery of service)
• 
Management/team leads
• 
Main escalation queue (location of general tickets that are being escalated to 
management)

68
CHAPTER 3  Infrastructure
• 
Customer complaints (tickets that need loving care)
• 
Unresolvable issues (tickets that cannot be resolved due to technical issues, 
limited information or outages)
SOURCE (SIEM, EMAIL, PHONE)
Ticket generation should come from many different sources. The ability to generate 
tickets from email messages is almost a no brainier. Emails can be automated from 
your security devices or they can come from users or customers. Tracking emails 
by converting them into tickets is a great way to ensure that all communications 
coming into your SOC are addressed and resolved professionally. Security systems 
like SIEM system or log management systems will have their own ability to create 
rules that trigger some action. That action could be a direct connection to your ticket 
system and have a new ticket opened that needs to be evaluated. The tight integra-
tion of your SIEM system and your ticket system is invaluable. Some SIEM systems 
include their own light weight incident management tracking system but you really 
need a way to handle tickets and incidents competently, so make sure you are able 
to effectively get important data from your SIEM to your ticket system. There are 
also automated ways to integrate your phone system with your ticket system. These 
integration systems are really nice for organizations that have a heavy call volume 
or in a MSSP operation, especially when an analyst is able to answer the phone and 
have a new ticket automatically open with the customer details already populated. 
This is a great way to make the SOC more efficient and provide great customer 
service. It also helps the SOC management ensure that all phone calls are tracked 
and logged appropriately in the ticket system for later review and to ensure that all 
work being performed in the SOC is being tracked. The sources of your tickets are 
an important value to keep track of and should have a field in your ticket system. You 
need to know where your tickets are being generated from for several reasons. First, 
if you are getting a ton of junk or false positive tickets being generated you should 
know where they are coming from. If you have many different systems all automati-
cally reporting and sending in information to generate tickets and you do not have 
the source information then it will be extremely difficult to know what system needs 
to be adjusted to resolve or tune the problem. You also need to know how your SOC 
is being informed of issues that need to be addressed. If you are properly engaged 
with your organization and have effectively communicated what you do, what your 
specialties and responsibilities are then your tickets should not all come from your 
automated tools. You should expect a percentage of your tickets to be coming in from 
phone calls, emails, your portal system, and possibly ticket escalations from outside 
the SOC. It is very important to track these sources so that you can run effective 
metrics to determine and evaluate where your most critical or even reliable source of 
events are coming from. Additionally you should be able to run reports on the kinds 
of issues you are getting from each source so that you can better understand the value 
you are getting from that device or team.

﻿ Category
CATEGORY
An incident should be categorized as one of the categories as listed in the below 
table based on the type of incident. These categories are fairly standard in the indus-
try and are regularly used by computer emergency response teams everywhere. the 
table provides a listing of the different categories and a definition/description of each 
category.
Category
Name
Description
CAT 1
Root-level 
compromise
This category is used when an individual gains 
unauthorized root-level access (logical or physical) to the 
organization’s network, any of the systems, applications, 
data, or other resources.
CAT 2
User-level 
access
This category is used when an individual gains 
unauthorized user-level access (logical or physical) to the 
organizations network, any of the systems, applications, 
data, or other resources.
CAT 3
Attempted 
access
This category is used when an unauthorized user 
attempts to gain unauthorized access to the organization’s 
assets (local or remote)
CAT 4
Denial of 
service (DoS)
An attack that successfully prevents or impairs the 
normal authorized functionality of networks, systems 
or applications by exhausting resources. This activity 
includes being the victim or participating in the DoS.
CAT 5
Poor security 
practice
This category is used when misuse or unauthorized use 
of an organization’s information technology assets is 
discovered. Also, covers violation of the organizations 
computer security policies such as weak password, or 
misconfigured system.
CAT 6
Scanning/
probing
This category includes any activity that seeks to access 
or identify a company or organizations computer, 
open ports, protocols, services, or any combination 
for exploit. This activity does not directly result in a 
compromise or DOS.
CAT 7
Malicious  
code
Successful installation of malicious software (e.g., virus, 
worm, Trojan horse, or other malware) that infects an 
operating system or application.
CAT 8
Unknown
This category can be used for a ticket that does not 
currently have a determination of what is happening. 
A ticket with this category selection cannot be closed 
until a specific category has been determined
CAT 9
Exercise
Since categories will be used for metrics, any tickets 
generated while exercising or testing should be closed 
with this category in order to keep these types of events 
separate from all the real events.
CAT 0
Discard
This category should be used for falsely generated tickets, 
bad tickets, or any tickets that should just be discarded 
and not counted.

CHAPTER 3  Infrastructure
STATUS
The individual status of ticket is important, it tells you very quickly what is going 
on with that issue and when combined with other key values it can really help you 
to manage your flow and rate of ticket closures. You will have to think about what 
values will make sense to you as your SOC gets going but there are a few basic ones 
you can start with.
• 
New—The value of any ticket that was just created and has had no work done or 
nobody has touched it yet.
• 
Assigned—Someone is currently assigned to the ticket work may or may not 
have begun on it.
• 
In progress—Tickets that are being worked on but that may be scheduled for 
resolution during a change window or at some agreed upon time.
• 
On hold—Tickets that cannot be completed right now, something is needed or 
other actions need to happen before these tickets can move forward.
• 
Reopened—This is a ticket that was previously resolved and closed but had to 
be reopened for some reason.
• 
Resolved—Tickets that are presumed to be closed and have a clear resolution.
It may be a good idea to set time limits on tickets or even force workflow for 
tickets in different states so that nothing gets lost or forgotten. For tickets put into an 
“On hold” status maybe you can force a user selectable timeout. So when a user puts 
a ticket on hold they have to select a specific date and time the status will automati-
cally change from “on hold” to “In progress” or “New”. Then you can put specific 
time limits on tickets that are “in progress” and change their color to signify that they 
have not been addressed or looked at in too long of a time period. Your imagination 
can run wild with possibilities, make sure your ticket system is capable of meeting 
your imaginative needs in this area.
REASON CODES
Not every system uses reason codes but it is a great way to help build metrics or gain 
better visibility into why a ticket is in a particular state. For example, if you have a 
ticket that was resolved, why or how was it actually resolved is a bit of a mystery 
unless you open the ticket and look for a “reason” as to how it was deemed to be 
resolved. By using reason codes it will help you understand specific states of your 
tickets and also give you nice clues for tickets that may be in the wrong state or need 
additional work. A good example of a ticket that is properly resolved would have a 
reason code of “Infection Cleaned”. An example of a ticket in the wrong state would 
be a ticket that is marked resolved but has a reason code of “waiting for call back”. 
Running reports that show different statuses and their associated reason codes will 
help you see what is going on very quickly. We talk more about metrics in a differ-
ent chapter but it should be easy to see how valuable combining fields help build a 

71
﻿ Reason codes
very clear picture of what is going on. The reason codes should make sense to your 
workflow and mean something if you want to pull reports and build metrics. As a 
quick example, searching for every ticket in a given month that has a reason code of 
“Infection Cleaned” could be used very effectively. Those may not only be tickets 
you want to report on but also review to find out what is causing all the infections or 
what is missing to allow viruses to get in.
Here are a few reason codes that will help you get started
• 
Waiting for external ticket update
• 
This is good if you are using a different ticket system than the rest of your 
organization and you want to keep checking the other system or you are 
waiting for an email to be generated to let you know when your ticket in the 
other system has been updated. It would be a good idea to also document 
what the external ticket number is so that you have an easy cross-reference.
• 
Waiting for a child ticket to close
• 
This can indicate that another subordinate ticket is linked to the parent ticket 
and a child ticket issue will need to be resolved before the parent ticket can 
be closed. This is good if you have an incident that spans multiple devices, a 
primary ticket can be created for the main event while individual tickets are 
created for the review of each potentially effected system.
• 
Waiting for call back
• 
A call from the user or another support group is expected to update or 
confirm that the issue has been resolved.
• 
System not vulnerable
• 
After your investigation into an event, you determine that the system has 
been fully checked and is not vulnerable to whatever attack or events alert 
triggered.
• 
No infection found
• 
For virus alerts, the system has been checked and no infection has been 
found.
• 
Infection cleaned
• 
For virus alerts, the system has been checked and the infection was cleaned.
• 
System remediated
• 
The system has been checked and a patch, software upgrade, or 
configuration change has been applied to correct the vulnerability or issue.
• 
False positive
• 
A triggered alert without the presence of proper evidence to support the 
alert.
• 
Confirmed security incident
• 
Evidence has been collected to support that a security incident has 
occurred. Tickets with this reason code should have a complete root cause 
analysis.
• 
In progress
• 
Evidence to support the alert is actively being gathered.

72
CHAPTER 3  Infrastructure
• 
Review ticket/needs follow-up
• 
More evidence is needed within the ticket to support the alert or an assigned 
group needs to review the information.
• 
Signature tuned
• 
The generating source system signature or rule has been tuned and will not 
generate another alert like this one.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT/TICKET FEEDBACK
There are two external communication mechanisms that I grouped together but are 
actually completely separate functions you may want for your ticket system. For 
acknowledgement, you may want a customer, device owner, or even an internal 
SOC analyst to acknowledge the creation of a new ticket that was generated in 
your system. This can be a great customer notification mechanism that alerts them 
to a potential issue that your SOC is working on and gives them an opportunity to 
weigh in on the issue right from the beginning. When a customer gets a notification 
they may look at it and immediately know why the ticket was generated and can 
help you close it quickly. In the acknowledgement function, you can track to see 
how long it takes someone to respond and you will have good metrics on response 
times to your issues. Also, if you require him or her to click on something to record 
the acknowledgement, it is a good way to make sure you confirm they know about 
the issue. The acknowledgement could just be a simple reply to an email, click to 
a website or logging into a portal to view the issue that generated the ticket. Since 
your SOC will be either working with external customers to your organization or 
internal customers inside you may want the ability to customize acknowledgements 
based off of customer or department preferences. May be it is critical that for ev-
ery ticket generated in the SOC for your organization’s web servers, the web team 
needs to actually acknowledge the ticket whereas another external customer may 
just want to be notified with no acknowledgement. Customization of how your 
ticket system interacts with people is vital to the level of customer service you want 
to provide.
Acknowledgement is typically at the beginning of the process of working an issue 
but ticket feedback is at the end. It is always a good idea to try and find out how you 
are doing and by giving people a quick short survey whenever you close a ticket can 
be extremely helpful. You will want to make sure that you can customize this feature 
as well or it can become a burden quicker than it can be helpful. Make sure that you 
are asking the right questions for the survey and change the questions often so that 
you are getting a good review of different parts of the service you are offering. Also, 
be mindful of peoples email inbox, do not flood them with a ton of surveys, try to get 
some built in capabilities to limit how many surveys you send someone out of your 
ticket system in a span of time. Otherwise people will just ignore these requests as 
an annoyance.

73
﻿ Portal interface
WORKFLOW AND AUTOMATION
In order to make your ticket system more capable and really aid your analysts, you 
will need to add some workflow and automation. Workflow can consist of predefined 
tasks that need to be completed for the type of ticket an analyst is working on. The 
tasks will need to be performed in order, will dictate the specific details of what needs 
to be done, and will require input for the task to be completed. This can help if you 
need to collect specific information for tickets and want to ensure that each analyst 
collects all the required information and in the correct order prior to closing a ticket. 
It will also make sure that information is collected and posted to a ticket in an orga-
nized and expected way.
Automation is a great way to aid in the regular analysis of information. For ex-
ample if you could automate the login process to a specific system or external de-
vice from the ticket system, it would save you a ton of time having to look up login 
details. I am not condoning hardcoded password here, I am assuming there is some 
secure functions happening in the background. For example, if your ticket system 
had an asset database and when a ticket was generated for a specific device in that 
database, you automatically had a remote desktop button that you could press. An-
other good automation idea maybe that when a ticket is generated for an IDS event, 
the ticket system will automatically pull health information from the device that was 
the suspected target of the attack and post those details into the ticket notes. It could 
tell your health information of the device like if the device is still up and online, 
CPU statistics, network statistics, and so on. This may give your analyst a quick bit 
of information to tell them if there was any impact associated with the event. The 
ticket system you evaluate may have many different automation and external system 
integration capabilities, spend time evaluating these features, and see what you may 
be able to take advantage of. Having this type of automation will reduce the analyst’s 
manual involvement in gathering data and information by having the system execute 
rules that automatically perform an action on a ticket when certain conditions are 
met. There is nothing quite like opening up a ticket to see all the research you need 
right in front of you, there ready to be evaluated without lifting a finger.
Key point: Count your mouse clicks, if it takes to many clicks to get information 
or you cannot quickly find information to analyze a ticket then you are wasting time. 
Figure out how to automate tasks, reduce the number of mouse clicks it takes to per-
form tasks, and make your SOC faster through automation.
PORTAL INTERFACE
You may think that discussing a portal interface is kind of odd in this section but it 
is very worthy topic right here. Most ticket systems these days will have some kind 
of web interface. Even if the ticket system you select does not operate completely 
through the web, there will typically be some kind of interface that you can leverage. 

74
CHAPTER 3  Infrastructure
This is a great feature to offer your internal or external customers. If you are able 
to give customers an account so that they can see all their tickets, interact with your 
SOC by placing notes in tickets or be able to even pull custom reports you will be 
giving them a great self-service capability and making your SOC more efficient at 
the same time. The portal does not have to be just for tickets, you can use it for 
posting special information, posting client specific reports or generic reports for all 
customers to review. You can use the portal to sell additional services or make sure 
all customers have key contact information to work with in the SOC. Your portal can 
be anything you want, but having your ticket system be integrated with that portal 
can really add to the professionalism of your SOC and provide customers with great 
value.
MOBILE DEVICES
Being able to respond to tickets or just having the ability to quickly look at new 
tickets once it is generated can mean the difference between saving your organiza-
tion from a significant breach or being able to finish your lunch. There are many 
technologies out today that allow you to securely connect to your ticket system and 
see basic information that allow you to make split second decisions on whether or not 
something needs to be addressed right away or if it can sit for the time being. As was 
mentioned previously, your ticket system should have the ability to set a criticality 
levels to the ticket. The ticket system can email specific types of events to you based 
on rules you create or for more serious events or special events you should be able to 
create text alerts as well. These types of remote alerts should be configurable not just 
to one person but an entire group of people or specifically assigned people based on 
rules. You should also be able to acknowledge or respond to tickets just by replying 
to emails and of course all of this interaction should be automatically recorded in the 
logs of the ticket.
Additionally you may want a mobile application for customers so they can moni-
tor their security posture. This could be done with a small dashboard that details 
how many open tickets they have, the criticality of those tickets and even the event 
generation rates over the course of a day, week, or month.
SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE
It all starts off with the SOC computer, many times I have been asked, “What’s better 
for a security analyst to use, Mac or a PC?” What makes this question so difficult is 
that many organizations have a standard, and because the standard exists, all depart-
ments inside of an organization should comply with organizational standards. For 
many years, now most enterprises have been using Microsoft Windows devices as 
the common go to platform for most employees. These organizations have spent a 
lot of time and money building corporate infrastructure to support and manage a PC 

75
﻿ Physical
environment. So because these corporate infrastructures already exist to support the 
PC environment, the security analyst wishing to utilize a different platform such as 
a Mac or even a Linux platform could prove to be challenging. I really do not care 
to be in the middle of this debate other than to say that some of the best analysts I 
have worked with will of course have their favorites, but will confidently be able to 
operate inside any platform or all platforms. In many cases, they will utilize a Mac 
or PC and Linux operating system in one way or another each and every day in order 
perform their core job functions. I am sure nobody reading this book will thank me 
for this section because I know that I am not providing any real definitive answer, 
nor am I loading up any arguments for one operating system opposed to another. The 
reality is that I do not see any SOC truly being successful without having access to 
multiple if not many versions and distributions of different operating systems if not 
for testing purposes than for special analysis functions. For example, there are many 
tools written for the Linux platform that make forensic analysis easier when deal-
ing with certain types of cases. The Windows operating systems maybe better when 
trying to perform malware analysis. Finally the Mac OS X operating system may be 
easier to work with as it combines many features of the other operating systems but is 
also extremely capable of running several virtual machines with different operating 
systems all at the same time.
PHYSICAL
There is a lot to think about when you are designing the physical layout of your 
SOC. As with any build out of any space there are a ton of considerations that have 
to be made, many more than this book could detail. Instead of diving too deep into 
physical space considerations I am only going to touch lightly on some options and 
important considerations that you should think about, but again this is no way a 
comprehensive list by any means. Keep in mind that if you are providing a SOC as 
a service to external customers or you may want to showcase your SOC to internal 
or external customers then the aesthetics become very important. Your SOC should 
reflect the work you do and the quality of the services you provide. Be proud of what 
you do!
Typically organizations will give all employees a desk, computer, desk phone, 
and any other desk accessories someone may need to perform the basics of the job 
they were hired to do. In a SOC that may not be the case and you need to think care-
fully about the environment that you create to ensure it is comfortable and healthy. 
Some of you that have never worked in an operation center before many think I am 
a bit weird about now to bring up comfort and health but it is a real concern that you 
have to consider. For other more experienced people who have worked a few years 
in an operations center you know exactly what I am talking about. Working in an 
operation center is not for everyone and the decisions you make here could be some 
of the biggest differences in being able to retain good talented people or even keep 
your SOC up and running.

76
CHAPTER 3  Infrastructure
Take for example a SOC that is chartered to run 24×7 on three shifts 365 days a 
year or two shifts for 16 h 7 days a week. You would not necessarily give everyone 
that works in your SOC their own desk, phone, and stapler. Instead you would create 
shared workspace so that you could reduce costs and reduce the size requirements of 
your space. Regardless of the physical layout of the SOC it makes perfect sense to 
utilize shared space if you are running multiple shifts. One of the very first lessons I 
learned managing a shared space work environment is to always be mindful of health 
concerns. One person coming into the SOC with a common cold could wipe out all 
your staff for a few weeks. You may think this is normal for any work environment 
but in a shared space, operational environment it is intensified. Multiple people are 
using the same handset on phones, a quick call is one thing but if your SOC analysts 
are spending a good amount of time on escalation calls or support calls then for the 
next shift to come in and pick up the same phone is kind of unpleasant. People are 
sitting at a computer for an 8 h shift using a mouse that someone else was just using 
for 8 h. Does it make you feel a bit sick thinking about using a mouse that someone 
else’s sweaty hands were just using for the last 8 h? There are other considerations 
but these two alone are a huge way to pass on germs, virus, and sicknesses to each 
other. To combat these issues, there are a few easy things that you may want to do. 
First, consider allowing SOC staff to either bring in their own compatible headsets 
and mice at their cost to use for work or provide them a standard model of each. Dur-
ing each shift change, each analyst would change over to his or her personal headsets 
and mice. This could also be a design consideration for the desks and consoles that 
you would purchase for the SOC. You needed to make sure that the USB ports and 
phone ports are accessible enough to allow for easy changes or purchase quick con-
nect cables to perform the same function. Moving slightly away from the phones 
and mice, the desk surfaces were also a major concern. People regularly will eat at 
their desk during work, whether it be a quick snack or a major meal. Typically not 
a big deal but now your SOC desks are cafeteria tables and need to be taken care of 
as well so that people do not get sick. Think about it, do you really want to come to 
work and sit at a nasty desk that someone was just using who may not have the best 
personal grooming habits and use their phone and mouse and eat your lunch right 
where they ate there is a few hours ago? I know that I do not what to go anywhere 
near that place. Anyway, I think I have grossed everyone out by now just by thinking 
about this but this is a serious issue and if one person gets sick in an environment like 
this then you are going to quickly find yourself with an extremely light staffing level 
as everyone is going to be calling in sick. Depending on the size of your SOC, some-
times it may seem that as soon everyone gets over one round of colds it starts back 
up again. Allowing people to use personal headsets and mice is one way to combat 
a part of this issue but you also need to make sure you keep your SOC clean. You 
may think that regular cleaning would resolve this issue but in a 24×7 SOC there is 
almost no down time.
Do not let people leave food around. I have a few good stories about this one, as 
I am sure many other people do as well, people that have worked with me in the past 
may be chuckling, as I know there are a few pictures out there that bring this point 

77
﻿ Physical
home very graphically. So make sure that you have adequate garbage facilities or 
plenty of caution tape. You may also want to think about not allowing food or drinks 
into the SOC but this could prove to be challenging as well.
Ensure that your organization’s facility services has access to your SOC and 
is able to get in to clean and vacuum on a regular basis just like they normally 
would any other part of the organization. This all sounds logical but in some of 
the secure and cleared facilities I have been in I have found it to not be so easy. 
Plus, you have to remember that depending on your SOC schedule there could be 
people working around the clock so what is the best time to make noise vacuuming 
and cleaning. If you are in a secure space the cleaning crew may be required to be 
escorted at all times but any classified or sensitive processing has to stop and be 
covered up while they are in the room. Finally, and this is no joke, at one SOC I 
managed I actually had a budget line item for disinfectant wipes and sprays. I had 
a regular shipment of wipes brought into the SOC and spread around the various 
workstations so that during each shift change over people could wipe down and 
disinfect their areas.
Ventilation is also a key aspect to your SOC space. Most SOC’s are behind closed 
doors or in secure areas and as such needs extra ventilation. There will always be tons 
of computers in your SOC unless you are using remote technology so you need good 
airflow for the systems but your people need air as well. By having good airflow and 
ventilation, you will keep your systems cool and your SOC healthy.

78
CHAPTER 3  Infrastructure
Comfort is another area of concern that you need to spend some time and focus 
on. The job of working in a SOC primarily consists of sitting in a seat and staring at 
a monitor for 8 h. There are some very serious ergonomic considerations that need to 
be addressed. I have found that comfort is an individual taste and that tastes can rap-
idly change. I am in no way an ergonomist but I do know that issues such as Carpal 
tunnel syndrome, Tendonitis, and Tension in the neck and shoulders are very real and 
serious issues that need to be taken into consideration. The quality and efficiency of 
the work being done may improve in a carefully planned ergonomic and comfortable 
work environment. Additionally, health care costs may be reduced, and worker mo-
rale may be greatly improved by taking your time in this area when designing your 
SOC. When looking at chairs, I have spent tons of money on high quality top of the 
line ergonomic chairs for the SOC just to have people swap them out with crappy 
old chairs from other parts of the organization. Some people like cloth, others like 
leather and some like mesh, some like adjustable arm rests while others like adjust-
able reclining. I have personally tried several so-called “8-h” chairs and I could not 
sit in them for 8 min. Honestly I am convinced that you will never get this right and it 
is better to have a sampling of chairs so that people can have the option to switch off 
from time to time which is probably your safest bet. There is no denying, you have 
to watch the chair issue, sometimes people can get very possessive about chairs and 
there always seems to be a time in the SOC where there is a single coveted chair. I 
have actually seen people arrive to work early for their shift just to claim a favorite 
chair before anyone else does. I have also seen people get upset because someone 
changed the settings on “their” chair because they had it perfect last time they were 
on shift. As if you did not already have enough to worry about in a SOC but I would 
be surprised if at some point down the road, you do not have a “chair issue”. In the 
next chapter, we discuss some fun ways to combat this issue.
Monitors are also another concern that you have to address in the SOC. It has 
been widely argued that staring at a computer screen for eight hours or more a day, 
every day will not harm your eyes from a medical standpoint; but, ultimately it could 
contribute to eyestrain or “tired” eyes. We have all had those days where it feels like 
our eyes are going pop out of our head if we stare at the screen for one more second, 
but we push through it and move on, because there is so much to do. To help combat 
these issues, make sure your SOC staff is taking breaks every hour if for nothing else 
then rest their eyes by briefly focusing on other things, this should go a long way in 
to reducing eye fatigue but also keep them relaxed and focused while working. This 
could even be considered exercise for the eyes. By adjust the lighting in the SOC to 
keep it at a comfortable level, too much light causes strain to your eyes when you 
look at the screen. Too little light will make it difficult to read papers and books on 
your desk. Most SOC’s I have built or been in keep it pretty dark where most of the 
lighting comes from everyone’s computer screens or the large video walls and/or pro-
jected wall images. In some cases, SOC employees will bring in small desk lamps to 
augment their light if they feel they need it. It is also important to keep your monitor 
clean and free of dust as these tiny particles can contribute to eyestrain when trying 
to focus on the screen. Finally, consider the mounting of the screens. Fixed mounting 

79
﻿ Physical
can be very hard to deal with as people shift positions all day long, monitors would 
be best mounted on free swinging arms if possible to give people the greatest range 
of motion and ability to adjust to their position, height and distance they want to be 
from the actual screen. Also, considering that your staff are highly trained security 
wizards you should safely assume that the bigger the monitor the better and nobody 
should have less than 2 per machine. Video real-estate (size of actual viewing space) 
is something that most everyone in security takes full advantage of.
Some people may find it hard to work in this type of environment due to the lack 
of personal space. When people float from desk to desk or share a desk area with 
other people an individual does not really have a place to hang his or her hat. This 
problem can be hard to deal with especially if SOC employees are regularly meeting 
with or visiting other employees in other parts of the company who may have per-
sonalized cubes or offices with windows. It can be fairly undignified for an individual 
to not have an identity or a place to call his or her own at work. Unfortunately in a 
shared workspace environment this is something hard to combat. You may have some 
creative ideas of your own but I equate this to grade school or high school where 
you switch from class to class and do not really have a desk of your own to keep 
your favorite pen and notebook. One idea you can try is to have desk draws at each 
workstation or console and make sure you assign a draw to each individual so they 
can keep their stuff in a central location. Another idea is to have personal lockers for 
people to store stuff. Having personal storage is important, you want people to have 
books, reference materials, notebooks or other items that may help them with their 
job. But sometimes it is not necessary to carry these things home every day, instead 
people need a place to store stuff that they can feel confident will not be disturbed 
by others. SOC people are a special breed, give them some space and let them have 
some ability to customize their environment, it will be best for everyone involved.
Do not lock down SOC computers to much, these are trusted security profes-
sionals and you should therefore trust that they can have some flexibility in their 
computer environment without damaging anything. I am not saying that everyone 
should be a domain admin, but some custom applications shared across the SOC and 
some ability to customize the environment should be allowed. Roaming profiles in a 
SOC is a great thing if you can support it. By allowing your SOC employees to cus-
tomize their profiles you are in effect allowing them to personalize their living space 
and that space will follow them around no matter what workstation or console they 
need to log into, this also works great in remote desktop or terminal service environ-
ments. Because as security professionals we all live on the computer, and we like the 
programs that we like and the SOC should be allowed to use just about any software 
they need to get the job done, within reason.
You can have fun and laugh about some of this but I will honestly tell you that a 
clean and healthy work environment with some ability to make personal customiza-
tions will create a significant and positive impact to your organization.
As for the layout of your SOC, you may decide to keep your SOC open and free 
flowing. This is ideal to help keep the SOC from becoming stale and looking like a 
regular office with cubes. In an open environment the idea is to eliminate many of 

80
CHAPTER 3  Infrastructure
the barriers that create that office style environment in the first place. Getting rid of 
cubicles and replacing them with desks or modern work area furniture creates open 
spaces which is an environment that allows employees to interact with one another, 
share ideas and interact. Console desks are a great idea and accommodate flat panel 
monitors and hide all the cables required to run multiple computers. You want to 
take a look at all the possible furniture options from traditional to specialty console 
furniture. You want to ensure people have enough storage to eliminate daily build-up 
of clutter
Space is not usually an abundant commodity, plan carefully when building your 
SOC and purchasing furniture. There are a lot of space saving options that can maxi-
mize the number of people you can accommodate with the least amount of floor 
space, offering a clean and uncluttered workspace. Another option is to create clus-
ters, at the same time as keeping the physical layout as open as possible, you can 
also give emphasis to teamwork and cooperation for select groups of people such 
as tier 1 or 2 analysts and engineers by keeping them localized to specific areas. 
Clustering desks throughout the office, you can create teams to spur competition 
as well as cooperation. This also gives teams the ability to discuss issues and work 
together without interfering or bothering other teams or nearby people who may not 
be involved in the issues the team is currently working on. Open spaces tend to cause 
people to swarm and issue, where several people overhear a conversation or issue and 
the swarm together to contribute or help resolve the issue. This is great teamwork 
and can sometimes help expedite the resolution of issues as well as provide a training 
mechanism for less experienced people. But there are diminishing returns when too 
many people are involved and other issues get dropped. Clustering helps eliminate 
that problem by keeping swarms localized to specific teams or groups. I am not par-
tial to one or the other, the decision depends on what you have to work with, the size 
of your teams and your furniture choices.
If you are looking to build a bigger SOC then a more traditional operation center 
built on a stadium model may be more of what you need. In this layout you would 
have a large video wall and rows of desks or consoles positioned in the room to give 
everyone a good view of the wall. In some cases the floor will be sloped so as the 
front desks are lower than the back to give it a stacked or stadium feel. In the back 
of the room, you would have management desks or offices for supervisors or watch 
officers. You may even have small conference rooms in the back as well. In working 
in a busy SOC with lots of people walking around you need to take great care in not 
only how you position the furniture but that you have the proper ventilation for all the 
computer systems and that cables are neatly tucked away.
PRIVATE SOC NETWORK
There is no doubt that your SOC will have special computing needs. The software 
that will be used to access security devices and resources are going to be very dif-
ferent than what is installed in the rest of an organization. The information and data 

81
﻿ Video walls
the SOC will be looking at is sensitive if not extremely critical to an organization. 
Knowing all that plus the fact that in some cases your SOC analysts may have 
administrative credentials to lots of IT systems it is extremely important to ensure 
that all the security systems, your SOC users and their equipment are very secure 
and protected. In larger SOC environments and at MSSP organizations it is not 
uncommon to have resources fully dedicated to the security of the SOC. These re-
sources would work as a regular analyst or engineer but would be solely dedicated 
to supporting the security of the SOC, this could include the networking of system 
resources, the management of computers, laptops, and servers, and the safeguarding 
of data. You could almost picture this as a SOC inside a SOC. When deciding on 
if a SOC should operate on a completely separate network or just a private virtual 
network take data flow into consideration. I have seen situations where and IDS 
event was generated and when that single event was sent to the SOC it passed by 
another IDS sensor and generated another alert as the second IDS system detected 
the bad data being transferred as well and had the same rule configured. Having a 
private network is not a must have item especially for smaller organizations. But 
just because your SOC is focused on security and you have extremely smart security 
people working there does not mean they are not susceptible to attacks. Attackers 
will target users in the SOC just like any other user in your organization but there 
will be increased focused attacks on your SOC by attackers looking to gain internal 
network knowledge or credentials to key systems. To better protect your organiza-
tion and to give your SOC a bit more freedom a separate network infrastructure with 
proper firewalls and security controls should be used. This also helps separate your 
SOC and their equipment from directly being exposed to key business resources 
and systems.
VIDEO WALLS
These are often very impressive in a SOC and can also be very expensive. Although 
a video wall is another optional component for running a SOC you may have very 
good reasons to use one. There is a wide range of sizes and resolutions as well 
as different technologies to build a video wall. Having visualizations of big data 
sets that engage with your analysts and engineers daily activities can be invalu-
able especially if it enables them to make real-time decisions. From cubes to long 
stretches of seamless border LEDs there are almost an endless array of options 
these days. The video walls can be used to display metrics to indicate performance 
health of customers systems, changes in network activity or special alarms gener-
ated out of the SOC’s ticketing system. The screens of the wall could also be con-
figured to display important news channels or the entire screen could be utilized to 
present training videos to the entire group. The screens should be standardized and 
organized as we will discuss during the chapter on metrics but keep in mind that 
there are no set rules as to what you can do and the screens can be changed to suit 
your needs of the day.

82
CHAPTER 3  Infrastructure
VIDEO PROJECTORS
Projectors are an absolutely viable option as opposed to a complete video wall or in 
addition to a video wall. There are projectors that are designed for 24/7 continuous 
use if that is how you are running your SOC. This could be a great cost effective 
alternative to more expensive video walls. Additionally video projectors can be more 
versatile in that the size of the screen can be adjusted as your needs change.
LABS
The building of lab can be a vital part of any SOC and a critical tool used every single 
day if done correctly. A lab environment is typically a self-contained network that 
includes many different types of devices, virtual machines and may even include a 
separate Internet connections all built for multiple purposes. The lab can be used to 
train new analysts on how to manage and maintain equipment that you use on your 
network. It can contain the equipment necessary for analysts to train towards certifi-
cations and you can even use the lab for people to learn new skills that will help ad-
vance their careers. It can also be used by engineers to try new mitigation technics or 
test newly developed IDS signatures before sending them to production equipment. 
The lab is a great place to try new things that is consequence free if things going 
bad. These SOC labs can also be used to develop security intelligence by trying new 
exploits and performing security research and testing.
The value of real hands on experience cannot be matched and with a lab you can 
give people that experience at any time.
Labs can quickly become very expensive so you will have to build it wisely. To 
give your SOC the ability to manage and maintain equipment in a lab environment 
is a huge gift that will pay big dividends. Those dividends will be paid in the form 
of better-trained staff, better execution of changes and management of your security 
infrastructure.
The lab environment can also be used to test changes to your critical infrastruc-
ture before you do it in your production environment. This will give you a higher 
degree of confidence that changes are implemented with a lower risk of causing 
negative impact to your organization.
In your lab you can have virtual systems that contain specialized software and 
different operating systems for people to try or use. Depending on the size and ability 
of your lab infrastructure, you can give everyone in your SOC their own server to use 
and play with. Allow them to develop new tools, test out new skills or install differ-
ent hacker tools to see what the capabilities are. You can help train your SOC staff to 
perform different tasks that may be needed from time to time like performing vulner-
ability scans or even give them the ability to do penetration tests of other systems in 
the lab. For your analysts you may want to consider training them on passive tools 
that would aid them in their jobs like being able to port scan systems to see what is 
responding or banner grabbing of known open ports to help figure out what applica-

83
﻿ Labs
tion a server is running. These are all things that can be done in a safe environment in 
the lab. When your SOC is dealing with more real and live incidents such as malware 
analysis or performing forensics, a lab is a great tool to be able to contain these types 
of activities so that it would not affect normal SOC operations if something bad got 
loose. When looking to purchase new equipment to add to your security infrastruc-
ture you can install demo versions of the systems in your lab and perform tests to see 
how it works and test its reactions to your simulated environment. Additionally you 
can use the resources of your lab to test your staff with exercises and training materi-
als that will be elaborated on in a later chapter. There is no right recipe for the build-
ing of labs, just make sure that if you are going to build one that its proportional to 
your SOC organization and that you build clear roles and responsibilities and ensure 
its properly maintained.
There is a lot that goes into what you need to build your SOC. There are 3 dis-
tinctly separate areas you need to consider, organizational security infrastructure, 
operation center infrastructure and support infrastructure. When you evaluate the 
needs of your organization first it will help dictate what you need in your SOC to 
support those organizational needs. Then the support infrastructure needed for your 
SOC will almost design itself but putting good upfront time and creative efforts into 
that support structure will enable your SOC to perform at the peak of its ability.
The SOC will never run out of things to do as attackers get more sophisticated 
and running a good SOC will increase your organizations ability to detect and re-
spond to those attacks. With the right tools and right reporting you will quickly gain a 
positive opinion of the SOC outside your organization regarding what you are doing 
for them that will result in additional tasks and responsibilities. The infrastructure 
you design that runs and supports your SOC is just like building a house, you want to 
ensure you have a good foundation. Do not be afraid to use what you have, no reason 
to run out a make tons of purchases. Building your SOC can be an iterative and incre-
mental process that grows and builds. It is ok to start small and add people, processes 
and technology as you mature your organization and develop your goals. It is also ok 
to look for tools and products that are a champagne taste on a beer budget to get you 
going, just make sure you are not sacrificing on key features that you will need to be 
successful. Your organization may just be building its security infrastructure so build 
your SOC along with it, make sure you are efficient and have all the tools to be suc-
cessful. I did not even come close to discussing all that is need to support a SOC or 
an organizations security infrastructure but I hope that I have at least got you going in 
a good direction, have provided you with some deep thoughts on direction and have 
given you some insight into some key considerations.

When it comes to organizational structure, one of the questions I hear the most is 
who should a SOC report to? The issue and topic of where a SOC belongs in an or-
ganization can be very political and a hot topic. Typically before I answer a question 
like this, I would need to know more information about the organization, but it seems 
to always typically lead to the same answer. If you are questioning whether your 
SOC is reporting up through the correct management chain, then you are probably 
not happy with your management or leadership. When you start to focus on manage-
ment outside the confines of the immediate SOC, then there are problems that need 
to be dealt with and addressed overall. There are many reasons why a SOC would 
report up through a different management chain in different organizations and each 
may have its benefits as well as drawbacks.
Organizations are challenged in today’s technology environment in that new prod-
ucts are popping up every day with a cool new toy or feature that users want or even 
demand that their organizations support. Technology for organizations has evolved 
into a highly distributed, mobile centric and global footprint that not only has to work 
for every user but also has to be scalable and accessible from almost everywhere in the 
world. Adding to the fact that technology is changing at a break neck speed, security 
and security-related organizations, especially SOCs, are still a relatively new entity. 
The SOC as we know it today has not been around that long as a standard department 
in an organization comparative to IT, marketing or public relations. These nuances 
make the placement of security and its operation center in a bit of limbo and up for

CHAPTER 4  Organizational structure
interpretation by the organization that runs one. Ultimately there are no right or wrong 
answers, as different organizations have different needs, but at the same time healthy 
organizations with supportive management that work well with its staff will ultimately 
be successful no matter what the overall organizational reporting structure is.
Really, whom a SOC reports to is not as important as the security mission and goals 
the SOC needs to perform and provide for the business or organization. Focusing inter-
nally to the SOC, there are many different ways you can structure your SOC to provide 
the best value. Over the next chapter, we are going to explore the role of the SOC in the 
organization in greater details and then we will take a look at different options for how 
to structure the SOC internally. How you structure the SOC is vitally important to ensure 
you are keeping in alignment with your customers, objectives, and organizational goals. 
When building a SOC, you need to ensure that you are able to bridge any gaps between 
the business and technology while focusing on addressing the risks of your organization.
Security operations have ever growing tasks and responsibilities from network 
security and application security to intrusion detection and risk management. Add 
into the mix that some SOCs will be asked to perform encryption, user management, 
eDiscovery, and web content filtering, it’s easy to see that security will touch every 
aspect of a business. Even though the SOC’s role is very technical, educational train-
ing and policy development are also being required of the operations teams and are 
a cornerstone to a good security program. Depending on the focus of the SOC and 
the current needs of an organization, the logical reporting structure may change and 
should change when it makes sense.
One of the greatest challenges security managers and their operations teams face 
is getting recognition from senior or executive management. Organizational security 
is not just an IT issue as it has great impacts on the business and the overall organiza-
tion and as such must receive attention from the highest levels in any organization. 
The SOC and the larger security department must work closely with business leaders, 
legal, HR, internal and external audit groups, compliance, physical security, and of 
course IT managers to develop a comprehensive approach to managing risks associ-
ated and becoming interconnected inside the organizations. Using metrics, as we will 
discuss later in the book, is a great way to get some of the efforts of the SOC out into 
the general organization. But organizationally, the SOC needs to be in the right place 
to ensure that it’s supported and that its higher-level management supports it fully and 
gives it the right visibility in the larger overall organization. If the SOC is doing what it 
is supposed to be doing and generating the right reports, then the business will notice.
There are a number of different reporting structures that are possible, and each 
organization will have to figure out what is best. Whether the SOC reports through 
IT, legal, compliance, finance, audit, or another arrangement is made, there will al-
ways be impassioned arguments as to why it is best that security be situated in one 
of these departments. Regardless of where security is in the organization, there must 
be a level of independence to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest, 
and the team must be able to work with the larger organization in order to strike a 
balance between the risks of the organization and business need. There should be 
regular updates on security with metrics to an organization Board of Directors or 

87
﻿ Organizational structure
senior executive leaders who are ultimately responsible for the acceptance of risk, 
especially in regulated industries such as financial services, energy, and healthcare.
Organizations these days must ensure that sufficient security is in place to mini-
mize risk to an acceptable level, and only the leaders of an organization can know 
what that level really is, if they are properly advised. In order to ensure that se-
nior leaders are indeed properly advised, they have to make sure that regardless of 
how the reporting structure is designed, the security organization including the SOC 
reports high enough in an organization to have the respect, political influence, and 
visibility it needs in order to be effective. We will discuss positions along with roles 
and responsibilities of individuals later in the chapter on staffing, but it is also im-
portant to acknowledge here that security operations must have a strong leader, be 
it a SOC manager, a director or the chief information security officer (CISO). A 
security leader needs to be not only a strong advocate for the security mission but 
has to also be highly technical and an effective communicator. The leader needs to 
be able to translate important security issues received from the SOC’s highly techni-
cal resources and communicate those issues as effective business risks, objectives, 
and responsibilities that are suitable for executive leadership to understand and ap-
preciate. Additionally, technical skills of the security leader must be sharp enough 
to communicate executive leadership concerns into objectives that are effectively 
transferred to and developed with SOC staff that must implement and execute.
Over the last few years, security professionals have seen their tool sets grow at an 
amazing pace. The modern cyber threat and increasing skills of the advisory have de-
manded that defensive systems designed to protect our networks be quickly deployed 
and professionally configured to prevent what seems like an almost inevitable breach. 
In some cases, budgets for security to make capital purchases are increasing and in 
other cases, organizations are fighting to hold on to existing budget to maintain what 
they already have, yet it never seems like enough. But as tools are added to defend 
organizational networks, we also need to maintain those tools, manage the tools, and 
monitor their outputs. You could have a security team armed with arguably the right 
tools but nobody to truly harness their full potential, and that would be a waste.
In order to run and maintain a successful security organization and an effective 
operations center, you need to annex your resources from the entire organization you 
work for. It is everyone’s responsibility to protect the organization where they work, 
so help them be a part of the solution. This goes beyond security awareness training; 
make people an extension of your team. When developing policies or new security 
programs, engage your business and bring people together from many different areas 
of your organization. This extended team can help to provide insight into how they use 
technology every day, how they can help the organization be more secure, and how 
to best implement technology in a secure way. Train them on how to best help your 
SOC and how to be a part of the solution, but listen to them and learn about them as 
well. It is not always about bits and bytes and the latest zero-day exploit; it is about 
how we interact with people and technology. Allow IT teams to get involved in your 
security processes and tools, let them help guide you, let them use the tools you have, 
show them how powerful the tools are, and allow them to be partners. For example, 

88
CHAPTER 4  Organizational structure
do not just provide security metrics but give people access to your metrics tools. You 
have to weave the security fabric into all of IT and an organizations business. It is no 
longer about intrusion detection or prevention; it is about network architecture, patch-
ing, DNS, proxies, among many other things, but most importantly it is about people. 
Get out into your businesses community and see how security can positively affect 
them and learn what you can do to help enable the business no matter where security 
organizationally reports to, and they will help enable you and your security programs.
An organization can never hire enough people to get the job of security done. In-
stead, SOCs need to ensure they elicit the support of the entire organization. Putting 
processes into place for users to report security issues to the SOC and training users 
not only on security awareness but also on what to look out for and what to report are 
a great boost to an organization’s security program. Enabling and arming users with 
essential information on security will not only help keep your organization safer, 
but it will effectively expand your security team and become a force multiplier. Not 
everyone needs to be a skilled analyst, but if users get strange emails, unrecognized 
attachments, or have unexplained things happening on their computer and know 
(whatever your processes is) to contact the SOC, contact IT, or open a help desk 
ticket, then the result will be an investigation closer to the time of the incident and 
an increased chance to prevent a bigger issue by either blocking or remediating risks 
or by communicating to the user population about a current threat to watch out for.
SOCs that get buried in an organization typically do not have the real support to 
be effective and will not likely be able to gain the respect of other IT groups and as 
a result, will be shielded from senior executives and other organizational leaders. 
This leads to important security issues going un-noticed and significant breaches 
can occur. The senior management needs to support an appropriately sized security 
organization and program with the right skilled resources in order to be successful. 
It also needs to fund the security program appropriately and if security spending has 
been inadequate or non-existent, then it may take a few years of higher-than-normal 
spending to catch up to where you need to be. This does not mean that you need to 
hire an army of people; instead, it may be that you just need to give the responsibility 
of security as an additional duty to someone in IT, or maybe that is all you can do. 
But having at least just that one person spend some time on the issue will help the 
organization start to understand the magnitude of the task or the seriousness of the is-
sues. Additionally, focus on educating the senior executives and organizational lead-
ers, as well as the security team, on the linking of good security with good quality 
business and then link individual success to good security practices. An organization 
needs to also enforce policies when bad behavior occurs in the area of security. if not, 
then nobody will take it seriously and security will just be brushed aside.
DIFFERENT REPORTING LINES
Typical, SOCs have no reporting lines inside an organization. By that I mean inter-
nally, a SOC has some typical organizational structures, but where a SOC lives in an 
overall organization varies greatly. Different organizations will have a SOC reporting 

89
﻿ Legal
up through a wide range of structures, and it seems that no two organizations are alike. 
Sometimes this is due to who senior leadership feels is a strong enough executive to 
oversee the operation and ensure the objectives of the group are met. In other organiza-
tions, the SOC or security would come under the IT department just because it makes 
sense. Whereas organizations that have suffered large breaches may have the SOC re-
port up through the legal department or an audit and compliance group. In larger orga-
nizations, a SOC would report up through a CISO management organization. A CISO 
could have any number of different managers they report to in an organization, even in 
some cases you may see them reporting directly to the CEO. There are some impacts 
and implications into how a SOC reports up through an organization. Ultimately, as 
mentioned before, security must support business initiatives and be an enabler for the 
business. A clear mismatch in reporting lines and overall department responsibility is a 
recipe for a SOC and an entire security program that is destined to fail. Do not have se-
curity for the sake of security; instead, develop data classification and information risk 
or operational risk management processes to direct resources toward the protection of 
agreed-upon risks, and protect the critical assets deployed in an organization. Lastly, 
ensure that your SOC has the authority to make or impact change in the organization 
as it relates to containment and recovery activity to protect an organization.
LEGAL
In some cases where the security of an organization or the lack of appropriate secu-
rity controls may have caused significant issues, the management and oversight of 
security may need to come under the direct control and administration of the legal 
department. This does not mean that anyone in legal knows about security or has spe-
cial skills to improve security, but security will hopefully get the focus and support it 
needs to resolve any current significant issues trending in the organization. The legal 
department may also need to work closely with security or directly control the secu-
rity organization during a significant breach that is in the public eye. This could be 
because the legal ramifications, regulatory violations, or the potential significant loss 
of business security actions are not handled properly or taken seriously. Additionally, 
if an IT organization’s lack of focus or mismanagement of security is seen as the 
cause to significant compromises and breaches, then legal may need to take over the 
direct administration and control of security to ensure that the right risks are being 
addressed in the priority directed by senior leaders and not of the general business or 
IT, a very quick way to make security a priority for everyone. The tolerance of secu-
rity issues and risks may be very low and the timeline to implement changes in an un-
healthy and politically charged organization may be difficult. Bringing security under 
the direct purview of legal will help cut through any cultural challenges. If there is no 
security organization to begin with and a significant issue occurs, then an organiza-
tion’s board of directors or senior leaders may demand the immediate establishment 
and building of a security organization that would include a SOC. This is typically an 
extreme condition, and a security group with an operations function is not correctly 
aligned in this configuration. Direct legal oversight is a heavy-handed way to enforce 

90
CHAPTER 4  Organizational structure
immediate and significant change in an organization. This is an approach that is not 
meant to make friends; it is a way to implement immediate and decisive change.
Once significant changes have been made and organizational objectives have 
been accomplished, then alternative long-term and sustainable reporting-structure 
changes should be made in order to have security become a regular part of the orga-
nization and culture. Eventually, an organization would need to heal the wounds of 
its significant security issues and work collectively to integrate or reintegrate security 
into the normal fabric of a successfully operating organization. Organizations that 
move from an improvised, fire-fighting launch of its implement of security and work 
to develop sustainable security programs that are cost-efficient and quality driven 
will accomplish greater benefits and reduce costs to the entire organization. Where 
security moves to will depend on the needs of security, the structure of the organiza-
tion, and the overall maturity level of the different departments.
CISO
The CISO should ultimately be in charge of and responsible for security and as such, a 
SOC. If in smaller to medium-sized businesses there is no real security group or depart-
ment, then the SOC is the entire security organization or vice versa. This means that the 
SOC manager would also be the CISO. The CISO position is still a relatively new role 
in many organizations. How serious security is to an organization and how closely that 
organization wants to manage its risks will determine how high up in an organization 
a CISO will report to. In some cases where the primary business of the organization is 
security or managing security for customers or if security is a true success factor for 
an organization, the CISO could be seen reporting directly to the CEO. Even without 
a direct reporting line, the CISO should have regular meetings with the CEO, board 
of directors, and other senior executives to ensure that security risks and successes are 
being discussed, acknowledged, and addressed at the highest level of any organization. 
As a company progresses forward, typically new technology can help with innova-
tion by bringing new products to the market, improving on existing products, opening 
up new revenue streams, or modernizing existing ones. Security teams and operation 
groups should enable this forward technical progress by figuring out ways to implement 
it securely instead of slowing progress or impeding progress. A CISO and his or her 
organizational leaders need to be able to direct technical staff to ensure that business 
objectives and risk tolerances are met. Attacks and attack groups are ever increasing in 
sophistication, and technical staff that is part of a CISO’s organization need to be fo-
cused on cyber security operations and keeping up with new and changing threat trends.
Further, a CISO needs to be able to speak to senior members of an organization 
and in some situations a board of directors. This is no easy task, as the person fill-
ing the CISO role needs to be able to articulate complex technical issues and risks 
effectively and in a way that is clear, quick to the point, can be well understood, and 
does not cause any unnecessary panic. Not only do the CISOs need to be good com-
municators at this level, but they also need to ensure they understand their audience 

91
﻿ Compliance
and make the right decisions on what to bring to their attention. More often than not, 
a CISO may only get a small amount of time every few months to be in front of a 
board, and he or she needs to know how to make it time well spent. The CISO needs 
to ensure that he or she has an organization that makes sense and that works effec-
tively to address the goals of the organization and that it is being heard.
CIO
The Chief Information Officer (CIO) as an executive level member of an organiza-
tional leadership group and the senior leader for IT is the typical place where you 
would find CISO, the security organization, and the SOC. This makes the most sense 
for the majority of organizations, as the security teams must work effectively along-
side the IT teams. IT being responsible for the implementation and management of 
technology and the SOC being responsible for monitoring and managing security on 
their technology is a natural partnership. An organization that is security operations 
focused would report through IT, and may be a part of an overall infrastructure and 
operations department. It would be primarily focused on deploying, managing, and 
monitoring of security tools and technologies within the IT environment. Because of 
this it would lead the organization to focus on best-of-breed products, cost efficiency, 
and integration with existing tools and technologies.
Unfortunately security and IT being under the same organizational umbrella also 
brings great challenges that should be addressed. Unfortunately a CIO who has the 
clear direction to deliver IT solutions may not properly balance security risks that add 
additional requirements or impediments in implementations to projects and as such 
could introduce great risk to an organization. This can be seen happening when a 
CIO’s main focus is the implementation of projects on a timeline target while reduc-
ing costs, instead of implementing effective technology timely and under budget while 
reducing risk. If an organization wants a great CIO, not a good one but a great one, 
then his or her task should not be to just reduce costs but also to reduce unnecessary 
risk to the organization as well. Having security operations report in a management 
chain under the CIO can be a conflict of interest and may cause significant separation-
of-duties issues. Oftentimes security metrics can be taken as a report card on how well 
IT is doing, and a CIO who wants to hide those shortcomings or security issues can 
do so especially if security does not have the right visibility in an organization. Not all 
CIO’s are bad, but the days where a CIO can ignore security or not be security focused  
are essentially over regardless if security reports are up to them or not.
COMPLIANCE
In one of the most mature types of organizations, a well-funded and focused audit 
and compliance department could be a beneficial group to house a security team 
and security operations. Typically, this organization would have an operational 

92
CHAPTER 4  Organizational structure
mission but would be more strategy focused on security and is much more con-
cerned with meeting business objectives while assigning all security priorities 
based on risk and compliance. In this type of organization, there would be a large 
focus on aligning the organization on governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) 
metrics along with reporting. This type of department is more progressive and 
forward looking and has more of a capability to be proactive in managing secu-
rity as its focus is really to try to anticipate threats and organizational needs. For 
security professionals, this sounds like the best place to be and it can be, but there 
are, just as there is with all things, some drawbacks. Namely, if your organization 
is still building, implementing technology or bolting on security to IT infrastruc-
ture, then the reporting lines of this type of structure are going to inhibit a close 
relationship with IT. This is not the environment you want while you are building 
a security program, as it is a maturity level that good organizations need to grow 
into. For example, whereas compliance may not have the capital to spend on infra-
structure, existing IT budgets could cover many security tools and infrastructure 
that may need to be purchased. But if the organization is mature and the entire 
security infrastructure is implemented, then you may be making a great move. 
Moving a security operations group or an entire security team will not happen 
overnight because most people view security as an IT function, but as people take 
on risk functions and those roles are more formalized, responsibilities will change 
and evolve.
To help with this evolution, senior security managers and / or CISOs need to 
make sure they are running effective continuous improvement programs and have 
metrics that ensure security focus areas are inline with the overall organizational 
objectives. Additionally, do not operate in a bubble; network and share with other 
security professionals in other organizations to help develop ideas, solutions, and 
measurements so that everyone can grow and learn from one another.
SOC ORGANIZATION
Now that we have discussed where a SOC reports to and even discussed a larger 
security organization, it is time to focus deeper into the SOC. This should be not 
just where a SOC reports to inside an organization, but it is time to cover the over-
all organizational structure of the SOC. Depending on your organization and your 
needs, you may have big differences in not only the structure but also some of the 
roles and responsibilities that are placed in the SOC as opposed to the roles that are 
placed elsewhere. We cover individual roles and responsibilities in the chapter on 
staffing, so here we are going to primarily focus on the groups, teams, and struc-
ture. In a typical SOC, you would see three different and distinct groups that are all 
responsible for working together and have tasks and goals that are interwoven. As 
shown in the chart below, a SOC should consist of an analyst layer and an engineer-
ing layer at a minimum. In a traditional SOC, you would have your level 1/level 2 
analysts, engineers, and then a management layer.

93
﻿ SOC organization
You can also split out your engineering group into functional areas such as device-
based or platform-based. This means that you may have engineers that specialize in a 
specific device function like IDS or are more focused on windows security at the soft-
ware or host level. Also as part of engineering, you may want to break out intelligence 
into its own group to give them the ability to explore, learn, and investigate to get all 
the new information they can in order to feed back the relevant information and intel-
ligence back into the SOC ecosystem. The chapter on intelligence details a lot about the 
efforts of intelligence building in a SOC. This group can either be under the engineering 
organization or on its own, and depending on how your build your SOC it could even 
be operated under an analysis group. Either way, the goals and objectives of any team 
need to be communicated in an easy way and managed appropriately to be successful.
In a larger SOC environment, you may find many other roles and groups being 
formed in order to expand and build on key activities. This could include everything 
from an architecture group all the way to a metrics and reporting group. As the SOC 
expands and requirements build, the functions that were once performed by a single 
person will have to be expanded out to multiple people. This is a natural growth pat-
tern and is important for the maturity of the SOC. It is important for leadership to 
not only recognize when growth into other areas is required but to also pre-plan for 
that growth. The pre-planning should help ensure that the proper funding, space, and 
equipment are available and that departments like HR are involved so they can help 
to establish the proper job descriptions and compensation structures and to coordi-
nate interviews. Do not be afraid to explore and change roles, job descriptions, and 
organizational structure. Re-defining your SOC and changing things around can be 
a good way to mature the organization because it gives people an opportunity to rise 
up to new challenges and shine or emerge as a leader under new direction and focus. 
Shifting management and people in different roles or areas helps to see who can 
perform and under what conditions people thrive the best.

94
CHAPTER 4  Organizational structure
An example of a larger SOC organizational structure

95
﻿ Engineering
The organizational structure of one SOC to the next is going to be very different. 
It should mimic the requirements and focus that an organization has on the SOC and 
the SOC’s ability to execute with the resources it has available. If you are a SOC in 
the government, there may be significantly different requirements than if your SOC 
was inside an educational organization. You will find similarities as well as differ-
ences in the way you build the SOC and those differences should be in meeting the 
needs of the organization and not necessarily the needs of security. What that means 
is that your SOC has to take care of security whether facing known or emerging 
threats and should be agile enough to perform those functions every day, but more 
long-term organizational expansion happens slowly. Do not make gaps in security a 
resource issue. Prioritize properly, execute, and plan appropriately.
ENGINEERING
The main support for the overall SOC and analysts comes from the security engineer-
ing team. The engineers can be engaged in multiple different areas and broken out 
into several teams depending on the organizational requirements and current focus 
areas. Primarily, the engineering group should be responsible for the security infra-
structure that has been deployed across the enterprise to protect the organization. 
This would include the care and feeding of those devices to include any signature 
and rule creation as well, and it typically includes the new deployment of security 
infrastructure. Engineering can be broken up into several areas such as maintenance 
and intelligence. The engineering team could also be where you find your forensic 
and malware analysis experts. Depending on the size of your organization, security 
implementation may be the function of an architecture team that works directly for 
a chief technology officer, but it would be the SOC or the larger security team that 
would direct the use and ultimately operate the systems being installed. It would 
be the SOC engineering team who would work directly with the architecture group 
on the installation of a new system or new security device. Engineering is also a 
likely place to have a liaison for IT change management. This individual would not 
only participate in the organizational change management processes but would also 
maintain an internal change process for the SOC team. This would include ensuring 
that all changes to security infrastructure are documented and that any changes that 
would affect the larger organization are properly communicated and approved prior 
to implementation.
Engineering being a highly technical organization can also play the role of de-
veloping security standards and evaluation systems against those standards. They 
would build and generate documentation on how new technology should be secured 
and what settings would be required for safe and secure operations. For example, if 
IT decides to implement a new mobile device management system, there should be 
collaboration with security architecture and engineering, where security engineering 
would evaluate the solution against any existing organizational security documenta-
tion and then provide a whitepaper on how the new solution should be configured. 

96
CHAPTER 4  Organizational structure
Then IT and a system architecture group can implement the new solution and meet 
business objectives and security engineering can come back around at the end of the 
implementation to see whether the security objectives were met or additional chang-
es need to be made. Additionally, engineering would keep tabs on all of an organiza-
tion’s technology, and as new vulnerabilities and security issues are discovered, the 
team could make key recommendations to a security architecture group who could 
evaluate the implementation impact and timelines.
One of the key and primary goals of the engineering team is to support the ana-
lyst team. The engineering group would be the third tier or in most cases the final 
escalation tier of an issue prior to going outside the organization. The engineer’s 
role in this case is to help investigate why something is not working, how an event 
was generated, or even why an event was generated in the first place. Engineering 
would support security architecture as part of the SOC or a system architecture group 
as part of an IT team. The engineers would be able to help architecture understand 
the proper intent of a security standard and provide clarification to standards from a 
technical perspective when needed. Additionally, when there is a significant environ-
ment change or a new infrastructure being designed, architecture may call upon the 
engineering team to help provide technical guidance on the capabilities and capacity 
of the existing security infrastructure. This is also a valuable partnership as engineer-
ing may be able to help spot operational trouble areas with an implementation plan 
prior to executing, saving an organization time.
Security engineering teams in a SOC should also work closely with IT and be 
very knowledgeable about an organization’s overall IT infrastructure. This way when 
things are being analyzed in the SOC, engineering can make quick determinations on 
the behavior of systems and know whether something is just not right and warrants 
a further and deeper review.
SECURITY ARCHITECTURE
This team inside the SOC (not all architecture teams are in a SOC) is developed 
to ensure that the required level of security assurance as defined by organizational 
policy and standards is fulfilled. It would also be this team’s role and responsibility to 
develop and administer an exception process. This is a process where when technol-
ogy is implemented that will not or cannot meet the standards, a risk-based process 
kicks in and the deficiency gets documented. Then it would be the architecture teams 
along with the engineering teams working together to see whether there is an accept-
able mitigating control or compensating countermeasure that could be implemented 
to reduce the risks. If an exception is needed, the architecture team would lead an 
exception review board that consists of multiple groups, including groups in IT and 
in the business, to review and approve. This is done in an effort to minimize secu-
rity risks to the ongoing operation of the organization and in new implementation 
of technology for the organization. By working closely with the SOC analysts and 
engineering teams, the architecture team would bring forward security initiatives 

97
﻿ Security monitoring and analysis
that are developed to provide better visibility to analysts or close gaps in security 
found by engineering or anyone else for that matter. This team should work with a 
larger architecture team or IT implementation team to review system and technical 
designs to ensure that they meet or exceed security guidance in their deployment and 
configuration plans. The team would also be a liaison to the organization and differ-
ent business units within an organization and would consult on how new technology 
implementations would be secured. The team would also be able to take new changes  
going on in the business back to the SOC so that the overall team could prepare or 
at least be aware of changes that may affect the monitoring and the management of 
security infrastructure. The security architecture team would also be a helping hand 
to the legal department in ensuring that contracts and agreements have proper security  
considerations built in. When working with third party technology providers, this 
relationship becomes especially useful if any specific security controls or changes need 
to be implemented to support the relationship. Another aspect of this beneficial rela-
tionship is that during acquisitions and mergers, security architecture can help design  
a process that on boards or slowly severs a relationship that keeps both organizations 
secure while meeting the needs of any legal contracts. The team can also make sure 
that any legal contracts contain appropriate language for third parties to maintain 
security standards that are equal to or that exceed the standards of the organization. 
This way, the external relationships do not become a risky program and it also en-
sures that any required monitoring of third party network or user activity is known 
and agreed to. From a security perspective, the security architecture team should be 
the knowledge source for the implementation of any technical controls for regulatory 
compliance. The team would provide the needed guidance to the engineering teams 
or IT for any new concerns or the resolving of open compliance items. Security 
architecture would also work closely with the audit and compliance departments to 
ensure that the required reports are being generated and that metrics are developed 
to support the audit and compliance initiatives. These tasks can be performed from a 
single team or separate teams that roll up into a larger architecture group. If different 
business units seem to be heavily engaged in technical projects, it may make sense to 
have permanent architects be assigned to those groups and just let them be the single 
point of contact for those groups into security operations.
SECURITY MONITORING AND ANALYSIS
This is the main area that makes up the operational capability of a SOC. A large por-
tion of this entire book is dedicated to what this team is focused on inside the SOC. 
The overall structure of this team is dependent on the size and number of tasks that 
the analysts need to perform. It is also largely dependent on how many shifts there 
will be and how many people will be on each shift. Primarily, the tasks that are 
going to be performed in this group are the monitoring of the networks and ensuring  
that the assets of the organization are safe from malicious attacks internally as well 
as externally. The makeup of the team needs to lend itself to be the first responders 

98
CHAPTER 4  Organizational structure
to event escalations and to address all critical security incidents. The team may also 
have a group or crew that is solely responsible for scanning and monitoring for vul-
nerabilities and analyzing what those weaknesses expose from a risk perspective in 
relation to the rest of the organization. A larger extent of what the monitoring team 
or any organization for that matter should be focused on is detailed in Appendix A. 
The tools and devices that can be used to defend and detect an organization from a 
security perspective are detailed in Appendix B.
Analysts can be broken down into triage or tier one and escalation analysts in tier 
two or senior analysts. Again, depending on the focus of your SOC activities you 
may want to split your analysts up into business areas. For example, you may have 
one set of analysts who watch international traffic and another set who watch only 
domestic traffic. The breakout could also be by different business groups. This can 
be effective if the types of traffic and systems being monitored are so different that 
the singular focus of an analyst needs to be on that area only to ensure that nothing is 
missed or that a specific analyst team is well versed in the technology being used in 
that specific group or area. Another effective split in monitoring may be by classifica-
tion, if one group monitors public or general systems and another monitors classified 
or sensitive systems. Organizations that make a technical product or provide a techni-
cal service to customers may find that two distinct monitoring and escalation groups 
are needed but that still work closely together. For example, a vendor that provides 
technical products and services may want an architecture and product security expert 
team that is focused on the items necessary to guide the development of a secure 
product and deliver secure services but also be able to respond to customers’ issues 
if security issues occur or vulnerabilities are discovered. This is a split focus on the 
vendor’s products in one team and its own network in another team.
A good example of how different security operations teams can split focus yet still 
work side by side is how the U.S. Government and military operate. For example, 
the U.S. Army, Air Force, and Navy each has its own operation centers responsible 
for monitoring the networks of its own service groups. They do this while the U.S. 
Department of Defense has its own team that coordinates across all the U.S. military 
teams as well as monitoring of their own networks.
RESPONSIBILITY
In any organization and in any structure, the SOC has to have a clearly defined, del-
egated, and even documented list of responsibilities. The key place to document the 
SOC’s responsibilities would be in the organization’s policies. Depending on how 
your organization operates and the various teams and departments you have, the pol-
icy could say many different things. Ideally, you would want to start off with the fact 
that your SOC has the clearly stated mission to monitor and respond to all digital-
based network and system security issues. This prevents any other department in your 
organization from deciding to just start its own SOC. Next, you will want to have a 
list of other departments and what their responsibility is to support the SOC efforts. 

99
﻿ Fulfilling needs
For example, if your SOC does not own or have the ability to modify firewall policy, 
then critical block requests made to the IT networking team should be addressed in a 
timely manner. But if the IT networking team does not have a clear responsibility to 
respond to the SOC, then the efforts of the SOC to block or mitigate and attack could 
go un-addressed. Not all of these responsibilities need to be documented in policy. 
The leaders of the SOC or a larger security organization need to spend the time to sit 
with each group it would require services and response from and clearly document 
what each group’s roles and responsibilities would be. Then, internal SLAs and SLOs 
could be established to ensure that there are measureable success criteria. Everyone 
needs to work together to achieve the same goals for the organization. Clearly docu-
menting responsibilities is a great way of not only defining what you need but also 
working with other groups to help you determine what they can offer to you as well.
AUTHORITY
What does your SOC have the authority to do for your organization? Just because 
you have the responsibility to monitor a few systems and devices does not give you 
the authority to do anything with that information. The SOC needs to have the sup-
port from senior executives, directors, and the rest of management to act on behalf of 
the organization in the interest of protecting them from risks associated with cyber 
threats and attacks. That authority should be known and defined so that when the 
SOC needs something, it can get it. For example, when someone in the SOC notices 
that a critical asset on the network is not configured to send its logs to the central log 
management system or the SEIM, then the SOC should have the authority to make 
the proper requests to have that system properly configured. System administrators 
should not push back thinking that they do not have to send their logs because the 
SOC does not have the authority to request those types of actions. This just makes 
everything less efficient and creates problems. The SOC needs to have visibility into 
as much activity as possible in order to protect its organization from harm. This does 
not mean the SOC should collect every type of log from every system, but needed 
logs that are necessary to get critical information should be easily obtainable if the 
SOC is given the proper authority.
There are many other types of authority your SOC should have depending on its 
responsibility and its capability to defend your organization and reduce risk. Detail 
the authority your SOC needs and work with the management to gain approval before 
issues occur and systems are needlessly compromised.
FULFILLING NEEDS
Along with responsibility and authority, a clear definition of the organizational needs 
should be documented, but many times people do not go in-depth with this. You can 
consider this a charter or mission statement for your SOC. Once you have a clearly 

100
CHAPTER 4  Organizational structure
defined mission statement, the SOC can list all of its services and its service catalog 
for departments or groups to see. The organizational needs are typically derived from 
and driven by security risk either known or perceived by the organization. The SOC 
should only perform activities that respond to the underlying organizational risks and 
needs of the organization as clearly defined. If the SOC is able to build new use cases, 
communicate needs in areas it is currently not focused on, and gain buy-in from 
organizational leaders, then it can expand its role and capabilities in those areas. In 
addition to focusing on needs, a continuous assessment of security posture, the cur-
rent industry risks, and any audit findings should be used as a foundation for adding 
to SOC activities. This evaluation process and SOC capabilities need to be revisited 
periodically to ensure that the SOC functions are still needed and that the resources 
are appropriate to accomplish tasks. The senior leaders in security operations must be 
certain the SOC is meeting the strategic needs of the organization on a regular basis.
Making your SOC a part of the organization and its critical mission will be far 
more effective if it is properly supported than if you just bury the group under several 
layers of misaligned management. Some functions can be outsourced, but ultimately, 
someone in your organization needs to take responsibility and have the authority to 
coordinate, communicate, and take action on incidents that arise out of monitoring 
and managing risk.

Building a SOC is not an easy task, certainly not easy when all you hear is that there 
is a massive shortage of security experts and if you can find one, he or she will come 
at an exceptionally high cost. At the time of writing this chapter, it is true that well-
trained security professionals are far and few between and they are expensive, but 
that does not mean it is impossible to find great people for your SOC or to secure 
your organization.
The first thing you need to do is evaluate the skill sets you would like to have in 
order to make sure you are really looking for exactly what you need. All too often 
when I look at a security organization and an operation center, their open requisitions 
for new employees go unfilled for long periods of time. Typically, the answer to these 
unfilled positions is that they cannot find the right qualified candidate. But when 
looking a bit deeper, I usually can find that they looking for someone who just does 
not exist. For example, their job descriptions may detail a role for a junior analyst 
but requires a master’s degree and 10 plus years of experience along with a ton of 
industry certifications. It is great that they have high ambitions, but this is a bit unbal-
anced and would not necessarily attract the right candidates to the job. Sometimes 
Your most valuable 
resource is your people

102
CHAPTER 5  Your most valuable resource is your people
this can happen in an organization where HR requires specific education or industry 
experience in order to command the types of salaries that are needed to attract secu-
rity professionals. Since cyber security professionals are still somewhat new roles in 
organizations, there are not very many precedents set for salary or compensation lev-
els across different types of industries. This means that HR is forced to try and find 
other similar roles to model benefit packages after and although they may find similar 
technical descriptions of these roles, they are actually quite different. These discon-
nects can happen for a number of reasons, but as universities have started building 
programs and are granting degrees in these specialty areas, these issues are beginning 
to get resolved. Let us take a closer look at some of the representative positions in a 
SOC and some of what the real requirements are for various positions you may find 
in a typical SOC. We will review some of the technical and soft skills required to be 
successful in these positions and let us also look at some of the basic job descriptions 
and associated job postings that you can use to attract top talent.
Where you get your people from is also very important to understand before you 
start writing job descriptions. There are four main ways to get a new person to work 
in your SOC.
• 
Off the street
• 
From another internal department
• 
Contractors
• 
Managed security services provider
First you can hire them right off the street as most organizations traditionally 
do. This is always a gamble because you only have basic references, phone calls, or 
interview meetings you have had with the individual to determine his or her personal-
ity, technical strengths and willingness to be part of the team. It is hard to determine 
what is real or what is showmanship when you are putting someone through the in-
terview process. Make sure that you expose potential candidates to as many people as 
reasonably possible during your interviews to gain a well-rounded perspective. Make 
sure you meet together as a team, if possible, to discuss the candidate and see if there 
is a good fit culturally as well as technically. Do not discount people that have desire 
or passion for learning and cyber security. One of the best ways to build a loyal, high-
ly trained staff is to grow them organically inside your SOC. If you are able to keep 
people engaged and interested and you have the ability to invest in their knowledge, 
then you will reap the rewards of growing your own cyber security professionals in 
your SOC. Not only should you focus on external resources but you should focus 
on growing all your staff to make them the best operations team you can. When you 
focus on expanding their skills, you will be able to retain them as valued employees. 
People want to grow and if they become stagnant in your organization, then you will 
see a high rate of turnover. Do not be scared to invest in your people. It is true that 
some will take their skills and leave, but the better you treat them and the more you 
invest in them. the more you will be able to retain them.
Next you can bring someone into your SOC who is from another department of 
your organization. This could be someone from IT or another technical area who is 

103
﻿ Your most valuable resource is your people
interested in cyber security and wants to explore other technical spaces than the one 
he or she is in now. Bringing existing employees into your SOC, especially people 
from IT, can be an incredibly positive boost to an operation’s organization. They may 
already know a lot about the IT infrastructure and the key people that your SOC will 
have to work with. They may be well liked and respected in the organization with 
established relationships and can help pave the way for a new organization such as 
a SOC that is being formed. I cannot stress enough the value of having an existing 
employee coming to work in your SOC. For a new SOC or new security program 
just starting up, getting existing people in the organization who know the ropes to 
help get you get going is a must have. Security is not always looked upon favorably 
as your organization may require the SOC to watch what people are doing. I do not 
mean spy on people and certainly there are some different privacy laws from country 
to country that prevent the actual watching of people, but as rules are broken, events 
are triggered that will cause an investigation. That is not such a big deal, but catch 
someone doing something wrong and it becomes a very big deal. Not only that, but 
when the SOC finds vulnerabilities or sees attacks on the network, people in IT may 
not view the SOC’s investigations and the answering of questions as their favorite 
things to do during the day. Having people on staff with already established rela-
tionships in the organization can help smooth over these types of issues before they 
become bigger problems. Not only that, but existing employees may know what dif-
ferent servers are used for and what oddly named servers are for and who is respon-
sible for managing them. These are all things that the SOC will have to figure out, 
but having someone on the team who already knows and has some of this knowledge 
will help the SOC progress and mature faster in gaining the required familiarity it 
needs to protect the network.
A SOC can also hire a professional services organization to place contractors in 
key roles. These contractors will typically be more senior security analysts or engi-
neers who have been in the same role at other companies and have general knowl-
edge of the tasks that need to be performed in a SOC environment. Not only have 
these contractors likely done a role at another company previously, but they also will 
typically be trained by the contracting company to ensure that their clients are getting 
a seasoned resource for the time they are onsite providing value for that customer. 
Contractors are not always the best solution because you have to pay them to learn 
your processes and procedures and help them learn where everything is, but that is 
typically offset by the skills they can quickly bring to the table. The right contracting 
agency that specializes in cyber security staff augmentation will have a deep well 
of resources that can be tapped for almost any need. Have a new intrusion detection 
system being installed or need help implementing a new intelligence program? Pro-
vide the contracting agency with your specialized needs, and they will work to find 
someone who can get the job done. Staff augmentation agreements with contracting 
companies can be for general analysis roles to help build up your staff temporarily 
or can be for the implementation of specific projects. Most of the time you will also 
get the option to hire a person full time from the contracting agency if you really get 
along with them and believe a more long-term relationship is beneficial. There will 

104
CHAPTER 5  Your most valuable resource is your people
be costs associated with hiring a contractor full time so make sure that if you are 
going to use this option, you understand those charges up front.
Managed Security Services (MSS) is something that we will discuss in more 
length during another chapter, but it is worth it to mention that organizations can be 
very successful using a provider. Although an MSS can also provide professional 
services engagements and staff augmentation, in this case we are talking about not 
hiring someone to work internal but instead removing the function internally and 
outsourcing. In this situation, you will outsource specific functions to an external 
organization and only have response requirements for the activity when the MSS 
finds something that requires your attention. The MSS will provide the resource 
coverage you need remotely and will take over the key functions you need to have 
managed. They will do this with highly qualified and specialized employees that may 
be unavailable or unaffordable for some organizations. The key to a successful MSS 
relationship is being a good partner and making sure your expectations are reason-
able by only outsourcing functions that lend themselves to easy execution without 
intimate knowledge of your organization or business.
OPERATIONAL SECURITY
When you are out there in the market for new staff to fill your SOC, make sure you 
think about the operational security of your organization. I know that there is a work-
ing balance, but you should put some thought into what you want to tell people and 
what should be kept a secret as to how you run your operations as this is a way to 
further protect your organization. For example, if you need a front line tier 1 analyst 
in your SOC and you create a job description stating all the vendor names of all the 
security products you use and would require a junior analyst to have experience with, 
you may be giving away a bit too much. By listing all these products, you are giving 
away potential social engineering, marketing, and intelligence information that an 
attacker can use, and you may also create a bias to potential candidates. Maybe a po-
tential candidate has great experience, but because you are using one type of antivi-
rus product in your organization versus another, it may make them skip over applying 
for your job posting. I know this seems silly as they should just be glad you are using 
antivirus, but do not lose out because of brand recognition or vendor preferences. On 
the other hand, it is ok to discuss what compliance or regulatory requirements you 
have as knowledge of those programs is helpful when framing out work that needs to 
be done in security. Being familiar with programs such as the Payment Card Industry 
(PCI) Data Security Standard and the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) helps to 
give you a good gauge as to a person’s experience and his or her capabilities in help-
ing your organization stay compliant. Again, when you are looking for a more junior 
person, having knowledge of products and programs is what you want; for example, 
familiarity with antivirus is what you want, and the specifics of the product they 
will get when they are on the job with you. Additionally, how you use the product, 
what your processes are, and the tasks you are going to require them to perform will 

105
﻿ Culture
almost always be new to them because they are your processes and nobody else’s. 
Of course there will always be similarities from organization to organization that 
are using the same tool sets, but you will almost always have some distinctions that 
are specific to your operations or your organization. Also, when an attacker may be 
looking to infiltrate your organization’s network, knowing that you use one brand of 
IDS versus another may give them an advantage in crafting their attacks to help them 
be more successful in being able to get past the kind of IDS they know you use. You 
need to think about what information is important for all job descriptions, not just 
junior analysts. A person’s exposure to SEIM, firewalls, data loss prevention systems 
or whatever is vitally important, their knowledge of specific brands may not, but that 
will be up to you. If you really do need someone who has mastery level skills in a 
particular brand of SEIM, then think about getting an outside hiring agency to market 
the role for you. That way people will not be able to directly associate your internal 
operational security controls to the security of your specific organization.
CULTURE
The culture that develops in a SOC is fairly unique. It is true that when you have any 
group of people that all work closely together at length, they will develop their own 
culture, will enjoy a specific sense of humor, and have shared personal feelings and 
developed trust. But in the case of a SOC, it may be different; it may be more of a 
group culture of acceptance, knowledge, and general weirdness. There are people 
that will thrive in these types of environments and those that will not. In larger SOC’s 
that run 24×7 operations, people may not have real personal space. They may share 
a desk and a computer with people who work on other shifts. They use the same 
keyboard and mouse as the others and will work on some of the same projects, tasks, 
and tickets and at times may even operate as if they shared the same brain. Anyone 
who is lazy or messy will be spotted right away. Someone who is a clean freak sitting 
at a desk right after someone who is a slob is a type of the cultural and interpersonal 
clashes that you will need to deal with in a SOC. As a SOC grows and matures, ev-
eryone in the SOC grows and matures. When one person in a SOC learns something 
new and shares it, everyone in the SOC learns something new. Everyone who lives in 
a SOC will benefit from the knowledge brought in from the outside and from creative 
people who figure out how to do things better and then share those skills. This hap-
pens much in the same way as when one person comes to work sick and a few days 
later everyone in the SOC is sick. It did not take us long at one high security SOC to 
figure out that we needed hand sanitizer right next to the biometric hand scanner that 
everyone used to gain access to the operations floor.
Not unlike other areas of IT, people who are focused on cyber security are very 
passionate. There is a sense of pride in making sure that the network and all its re-
sources are protected. Bringing someone new into this culture is not always easy. In 
great SOC cultures that I have worked in, you know it just clicks, you have fun, you 
respect the people you work with and you learn something new everyday that you 

106
CHAPTER 5  Your most valuable resource is your people
go to work. And when you have stayed in touch with the people you have worked 
with for over 10 years after you left that SOC, then you know you had and still have 
something special.
A single bad apple can absolutely poison the well in a SOC, so you have to be 
careful. When a person is not pulling his or her weight, not properly documenting 
tickets, showing up late, or passing work off to others, the moral in the SOC can go 
down fast and people can start to gang up on the offender. Unlike other work environ-
ments where some of this may go unnoticed, in a SOC it will become very obvious to 
team members who are picking up the slack. Make sure you stop this early because 
as things become toxic, work will suffer.
The cultural fit is extremely important in a SOC environment. People have to 
work very close to each other and will work under some extreme conditions that can 
also be very high stress. Making sure you have the right personality mix is vitally 
important.
PERSONALITY
Personality is a key ingredient for an individual in a SOC environment. You need 
to find people that are naturally curious and want to uncover the real or root cause 
of events. These are your modern day Sherlock Holmes who will leave no stone or 
packet of data unturned in order to get not just an answer but the right answer that sat-
isfies their curiosity. People that thrive in a SOC environment do not need their own 
office and like working together as a team. They are able to ask for help appropriately 
and when needed, and will always look for opportunities to share their knowledge in 
order to better the group. In some very positively charged SOC environments I have 
been in, positive competition was also a large part of the personality of the people. 
They would compete to see who could find the most zero day exploits, or who could 
write the best intrusion detection signatures, or who could develop the best rules to 
capture new hacking attempts or abnormally behaving devices. They would also at-
tack each other in a lab for bragging rights. This was all in great fun and not only did 
it inspire people to learn, but it also helped in developing leaders and trainers, not 
to mention how it benefited and advanced the security of the organization. Without 
positive personalities like this in the SOC to drive development, innovation, and in-
spiration your SOC will get stagnant, stale, and filled with people coming in every 
day to punch a clock.
CORE SKILL SETS
There are some basic skill sets you should look for in someone you are considering to 
work in your SOC. These skills are the basic core skill sets that anyone in any posi-
tion in your SOC should have, and this includes management. One of the basic skill 
sets that are important for people in a SOC to know at a minimum is rudimentary 

107
﻿ Core skill sets
networking. They should know IP addressing, basic routing, and basic protocol in-
formation. They should understand what protocols are and how they operate as well 
as what ports they use. They do not necessarily need to know an extensive list of ports 
and protocols, but the more common ones are fine. Do not interview someone just to 
blow him or her away technically, which is not fair. Instead, gauge where they are and 
determine if they are trainable to the position you need. Next, they should understand 
some simple attack methodologies like brute force, overflows, and denial of service 
as well as how some types of malware work. These simple attacks combined with 
basic networking skills will give anyone in the SOC a running start when the first 
real event comes in that they need to address. Obviously the more advanced a person 
is in these areas the better he or she will be, but do not discount a potential candidate 
who does not have advanced skills in these topics but has a strong willingness to 
learn. When we get to the chapter on training, you will see how easy it is to bring 
people in and give them the skills they need to be successful. You need to be able to 
get junior analysts in the door and invest time and knowledge on them. I have many, 
many examples where I have brought someone into a SOC as a junior analyst. They 
have only had a basic understanding of IT in general but because of their positive 
personality, drive, determination, and willingness to learn, not only did they come in 
to the organization and do a great job, they excelled, exceeded expectations, and rose 
through the ranks to become some of the best platform, intelligence, or general cyber 
security engineers in the business. So an individual coming into a SOC needs to have 
a good attitude in order to be successful but also having had some exposure to some 
programing languages, hex code, and the use of command line instruction from dif-
ferent platforms are a big help as well. Even though you may need a more seasoned 
and senior person today, look to promote from within and develop your staff to take 
on greater roles and responsibilities, and then hiring may be easier as you will be 
freed up to find people who you can train.
To break it all down, here are some of the core skill sets needed for an individual 
to be successful starting out in a SOC:
• 
Basic networking
• 
Simple attack methodologies
• 
General understanding of malware
• 
Must have a passion for technology
• 
Must be genuinely curious
• 
Should be good at deductive reasoning and critical thinking
• 
Be creative
• 
Have a general quest to learn and gain knowledge
Roles and responsibilities
In a typical SOC, there are various job functions and roles inside those functions 
that you need to have in order to build out your operation center. We talk more about 
organizational structure later, but this is as good a time as any to look at a basic or-
ganizational chart to frame out the positions we are going to discuss. Each position, 
although related to each other, is very different and will have a different focus and 

108
CHAPTER 5  Your most valuable resource is your people
different skill sets. As such, each position should have a different job description, 
and individuals in those positions should be held accountable for very different goals 
and objectives.
You start off with you basic analyst; this role is your front line initial triage staff. 
Their jobs are very regimented and prescriptive. They are to do what is documented 
and nothing else. Anything outside what is documented needs to be escalated. Your 
second layer or tier 2 is your senior analyst. These folks are there to take more com-
plex escalations from your front line and quickly resolve any issues they can. They 
also need to make critical decisions to escalate problems to an engineering group or 
to an incident response lead if the problem deems it. Their position is also prescrip-
tive but has room for flexibility and they have decision capability for escalation pur-
poses. An incident response lead can function in many different capacities depending 
on the situation. They are there to control the flow of information between analysts, 
engineers, management, and the customer. They should follow very prescriptive pro-
cesses to ensure that everyone follows the right process and that all key decision 
makers are properly informed during crisis times. Engineers can be broken down in 
many ways and depending on your organization, you may have many groups or just 
one group. Either way, your engineers should be your most technically skilled SOC 
staff in a specific area. They operate at a descriptive as opposed to prescriptive level. 
They will typically be writing rules, building infrastructure, solving problems, and 
working with vendors to address functional or implementation issues. They can also 
be research engineers that focus on security intelligence or special projects needed 
at your organization. Depending on the size of your SOC, you may also have a layer 
of management in the basic design. If you run several shifts for 24×7 coverage, then 
you may need a shift supervisor, someone who makes sure that tickets are addressed 
properly during shift hours. This is also someone who can take customer escalations 

109
﻿ Analysts
and deal with management problems as they arise, such as employees calling in sick. 
The shift supervisor should be one of your best technical analysts who can operate at 
an engineering level but wants to take their career on a management track. This way 
they can jump into any issue and make sure that each team is moving along smoothly 
during that shift. They will also be the liaison for management to report issues, com-
municate objectives, and resolve any potential problem areas. In addition to shift 
supervisors, you can have team leads that are directly responsible for individual team 
performance. These are individuals who work inside a team such as engineering but 
manage the people, projects, and workflow in that group on a daily basis.
Lastly, there is the SOC manager. This person is responsible for the entire opera-
tions of the SOC and will typically have all shift supervisors and team leads reporting 
into him or her, again depending on the size of your operations team.
You may have many other types of positions in your SOC. This is just a basic 
framework to begin the conversation of the roles and what the staff should look like 
from a skills perspective and how you should view them. The perfect SOC employee 
will be one that you grow and you keep engaged and keep happy, and they will in turn 
help keep your organization secure.
ANALYSTS
Your first line staff—the people that answer the phone, triage most of your issues, 
and review most all your events—are your security analysts. There are many dif-
ferent types of analysts you may have, but your most junior analysts are tier 1/level 
1 or the first tier of people who evaluate events. They are the first to open a ticket 
and peek inside to see what is going on. Your tier 1 analysts are typically not given 
very much flexibility in how they handle issues. They are given a rigid and prescrip-
tive approach in dealing with events. They are to follow predefined and documented 
procedures and escalate anything that does not fit the norm to a second tier or a tier 
2 senior analyst. It is critical to train your analysts on how to spot problem areas in 
order for them to be the first and best line of defense for your organization. The more 
time you spend training your front line analysts, the easier it will be to protect your 
organization and run an efficient SOC. You also need to listen to your front line ana-
lysts. They will tell you where they are wasting their time, how to improve processes, 
and what they could be doing to make things better and more secure. Give them the 
opportunity to help shape the SOC, as it should be your hope that one day your front 
line SOC analysts will become your trusted engineers or managers. I will also argue 
that you should never hire tier 2 senior analysts. The skills that make a senior analyst 
are specific to your operation and the operation of your processes, programs, and 
procedures. While it is true that you can hire people that have more technical skills 
and require less training, technically there may be no end to the training you can 
give someone on soft skills that will help them. Being an effective analyst requires 
a good balance between being technically competent and being able to work with 
people. A senior analyst will have these skills, will understand the finer points of 

110
CHAPTER 5  Your most valuable resource is your people
your processes, and will be able to execute key tasks with finesse, a style that nobody 
off the street will be able to do until they really learn the ropes of your organization.
When thinking about this position and what you need the role to perform for 
you, think about the technology that they will need to interact with. Will they access 
devices directly, will they just work out of a ticket system and nothing more, or in 
smaller SOCs will your tier 1 and tier 2 really be the same people? Although it is 
nice to have clearly defined roles with junior people working alongside more senior 
people, it is sometimes a luxury as not all organizations can afford an army of cyber 
warriors. This does not mean the job descriptions change or that the functions are 
different; you just need to combine the functions and merge the responsibilities into 
one person’s core competencies.
Sample job description and posting for a tier 1 or 2 analyst includes key technol-
ogy that the particular SOC is focused on from an organizational perspective but as 
mentioned above, the names of the specific vendors or products are omitted. The 
omission of product and vendor names does not diminish the description; in fact, 
it makes it more focused and more to the point as you are not instantly drawn into 
thinking about the products but focused more on the skills.
SECURITY ANALYST—JOB DESCRIPTION
DESCRIPTION:
This position manages and monitors events from internal security devices, and 
authentication services associated with the organization’s security controls. Incum-
bents will possess strong technical analytical skills while providing accurate analysis

in a timely manner. These needs may involve resolving hardware/software failures, 
investigating and responding to security threats, and making change requests to the 
security policy of company devices.
ESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
Provide technical support for an on call 24×7×365 basis. This involves handling 
events such as identifying user security issues, extensive troubleshooting, and coor-
dinating resolution or restore using a variety of applications and testing tools. The 
events can include hardware/software failures as well as security breaches, threats, 
or network connectivity issues. Regularly provide high-level proactive technical sup-
port, including security configurations, security policy modification recommenda-
tion, and diagnostics of remote network security issues.
Professionally and courteously answer inbound security-related calls and provide

SECURITY ENGINEERING
When you look to fill the role of security engineering, your descriptions are going 
to vary greatly. Engineers can be highly specialized and focused on the very specific 
needs of your organization. They can be platform focused such as IDS, proxy, or 
Data Loss Prevention or they can be threat based for the purpose of building intel-
ligence. You may even have network or system engineers that are more IT focused 
and support the SOC and all its equipment. You have to keep in mind that with your 
engineering staff, their main purpose is to support the SOC who in turn supports 
the customer weather internal or external. So it is important that your engineers un-
derstand that with every device they deploy, ever rule they create, every piece of 

112
CHAPTER 5  Your most valuable resource is your people
intelligence they collect, the analysts will be on the front end of their efforts, and 
will be responsible for acting on whatever they put in place. Although your security 
engineers are highly technical and will work on long projects they should not operate 
in a bubble and need to keep focus on the rest of the organization. This will become 
obvious when an engineer creates a new rule in a SEIM environment that generates 
thousands of false positive events that flood your ticket system all for your analysts to 
fix. As uncle Ben said to Spider-man, “With great power comes great responsibility”. 
Your engineers will have great power over your security infrastructure, make sure 
they are responsible and accountable.
Engineers should be responsible for looking over tickets that have been closed by 
the SOC analysts. They should review a specific percentage of tickets each week to 
ensure that not only are the analysts properly working the tickets but that they agree 
with the analysis conclusion that was used to close the ticket. This exercise will help 
not only build better quality control into the overall SOC system but it will help 
highlight areas that the engineers need to train the analysts on or even areas where the 
engineers need to fix a system to make things easier or to work better for the analysts.
Sample job description and posting for an engineer, again this will include tech-
nology but will not specifically call out brands or products. Below is an example of 
a job description and posting for a security engineer who has overall critical respon-
sibility for the management and configuration of host-level security on an organiza-
tions server network. This could easily be transitioned to be a job for an engineer 
focused on intrusion detection, intelligence, or Security Event Management.
SECURITY OPERATIONS ENGINEER—JOB DESCRIPTION
DESCRIPTION:
This position manages and monitors events and performance from host-based 
security products associated with the company’s security controls. Incumbents 
will possess strong technical analytical skills while providing accurate analysis of 
security-related problems. They have a well-rounded networking background and 
are responsible for performing extensive troubleshooting of customer issues in the 
fast-paced SOC. This individual is user focused and works to resolve user needs in 
a timely manner. These needs may involve resolving hardware/software failures, in-
vestigating and responding to security threats escalated from the analysis group, and 
making change requests to the security configuration and policy of company devices. 
Candidates will be the subject matter expert on the team for patching, application 
whitelisting, hardening, scanning and monitoring as well as security metrics for all 
severs on the organizations network.
ESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:

SECURITY ARCHITECT
Although the security architect is not always in the basic SOC organizational chart, 
it is worth putting a bit in about this role. The architect can be a critical function in 
a SOC environment and needs to work closely with a SOC. This role can either be 
managed inside the SOC under an engineering function or can be outside but still 
under an information security department or CISO function. An architect must be la-
ser focused on the operational functions of any infrastructure or control that they are 
recommending for implementation. An infrastructure that is not properly managed 
or the output not properly addressed is a waste of time and the results from those ef-
forts will be lost. The architect must understand how the SOC works and be in lock 
step with the operations team. They need to ensure that any new technology can be 
properly managed in the operations center, which is fully integrated with the SOC 
tool sets and that the proper training and support functions exist for the ongoing care 
and feeding of that new technology.
SECURITY ARCHITECT—JOB DESCRIPTION
DESCRIPTION:
The security architect will achieve organizational security goals by determining 
technical security requirements, planning, and guiding the implementation of security 
systems. The incumbent will enhance security team accomplishments and compe-
tence by planning the delivery of solutions, answering technical and procedural ques-
tions for less-experienced team members, teaching improved processes, and mentor-
ing others. Architecture will determine security requirements by evaluating business 
strategies and requirements, researching information security standards, and conduct-
ing system security and vulnerability analyses. Risk assessments and the studying of 
proposed architecture/platform of business systems will support any identified inte-
gration issues. Lastly, the architect must verify installed security systems by develop-
ing and implementing test scripts to ensure the success of requirements being met.
ESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
Analyze and design security solutions for business and organizational applica-
tions and infrastructure, and provide expertise and consulting to internal or external 
clients. Will identify and document information security risks and propose mitigat-
ing or compensating controls based of best practices, industry standards, or regulatory 
requirements. Will have the responsibility for understanding complex business needs, 
requirements, and project scopes, with a focus on information security requirements. 
Will research, design, and develop new information security controls and will have the 
ability to assess current IT environments and make recommendations to increase secu-
rity. Will work closely with compliance, IT, and security organizations to achieve goals.

SOC TEAM LEAD
I cannot say enough how important the SOC team leads are in your SOC and in 
your overall organization. These are the key people that you will need to ensure 
that everything is running smooth and that issues are being addressed appropriately, 
they are the ones driving the ship. Your team leads may be a single-shift supervisor 
or could be stove piped into different functional areas such as an analyst lead, and 
incident lead and an engineering lead. The larger the SOC the more leads you may 
want to have to manage individual functional teams, so depending on what makes 
sense to you and the roles you need you will split these job functions out. Ultimately 
you need to have a single person who is responsible for what happens on a shift and 
this is going to either be a lead or a senior lead. A senior lead may be whom all the 
other leads report to if you need more than one team lead. When looking at the SOC 
team lead, this should be the single person who is operationally responsible for what 
is going on during a shift across all teams. This person will ultimately reports to the 
SOC manager and who will be responsible for executing on the SOC managements 
requirements.

116
CHAPTER 5  Your most valuable resource is your people
The lead must be able to do almost every job proficiently and in most cases better 
than anyone else in the SOC. Not only is this one of the most technically competent an 
experienced people in the SOC but they must also be very aware of any and all situa-
tions happening in the SOC. They need to have sharp instincts to know when an analyst 
or engineer is having trouble and be able to step in to provide guidance. The team leads 
are not only your top technical people but they are also management. Because they are 
management they need to have people and management skills to ensure that everything 
runs smooth. Your team leads are going to be the leads for just about everything such as 
scheduling, training, work load and the handing out of any special projects. They will 
also be the people that should recommend individuals for promotions and raises during 
review times. These are the lieutenants of the technical front line and need to be able to 
keep cool at times of extreme stress like when a major incident is happening. They will 
direct operations and ensure that all requirements are taken care of and that processes 
are followed, all the while providing support and cover as needed.
Quality control is another area that should be the responsibility of the team leads. 
They should be responsible for reviewing tickets in the system and spot-checking 
the work of the analysts. They should review a set percentage of tickets every week 
to ensure that quality work is being accomplished and they should be looking to see 
if there are common errors or issues that may require additional training for either 
individuals or the group as a whole. These spot checks could revel that people are 
not following process but it is also a great way to see if there are any tickets being 
improperly addressed or filed or even lost in the system.

SOC MANAGEMENT
Not unlike the SOC team leads people in SOC management rolls need to also be 
technical, they need to be able to translate organizational objectives into technical 
controls that everyone in the SOC can understand. They need to also understand 
technical issues being dealt with during an incident or when supporting critical 
infrastructure issues. The SOC manager needs to know their people really well and 
be able to think on their toes. During incident repose or times of crisis they need 
to be able to put the right people in the right places at the right time to efficiently 
and effectively deal with any issues that may arise in order to prevent or limit any 
exposure an organization may have during an attack or breach. In working with the 
team leads, they need to address organizational concerns, grow the team’s collective 
knowledge and ensure that the entire operations group is meeting or exceeding stan-
dards. Additionally, management needs to be responsible for deploying, maintaining, 
tuning, monitoring and managing all aspects of the organizations SOC. Additionally,

the SOC manager has to be a liaison between the operations team and the rest of the 
organization. In some cases, the SOC manager may also need to be the primary point 
person for any external agencies or governing authorities. This is very important 
when incidents have a criminal implication or when auditors come in to check on 
regulatory controls. All of that has to be properly managed and controlled so that the 
organization can maintain its compliance and ensure that there is cooperation with 
any authorities that may need to be involved in incidents.
The SOC manager is also the key person responsible for all the metrics in the SOC. 
This would be to ensure that the SOC is operating effectively, efficiently, and that the 
metrics demonstrate an acceptable level of performance. The manager needs to also 
perform predictive analysis to ensure they are brining in the right staff to fill critical 
roles, promoting the right people and ultimately achieving organizational security ob-
jectives. Management should also always be on the lookout for new ways to build met-
rics that demonstrate effectiveness or weaknesses and use these tools at all levels of the 
SOC to help engage everyone to better bring them into alignment with expectations.
The SOC manager needs to also work with the rest of the organization and if avail-
able a larger security organization to identify areas where the SOC is causing prob-
lem or for areas of opportunity for the SOC to further help meet security objectives. A 
SOC can create problems for other groups such as IT, in that escalations may need to 
be handled better or information flow needs to be done differently. In these cases, it is 
important that the SOC manager work with these external teams to understand what 
they need or how the SOC can work with them better so as to not cause issues and 
make life easier for everyone involved. Additionally the person in this role needs to be 
an evangelist for the operations group and ensure that the right amount of publicity is 
being heard internally to the rest of the organization. All too often the SOC goes un-
noticed behind closed doors unless there is an issue or someone is helping to promote 
the great work everyone is doing in security operations. A SOC manager must create 
value out of the SOC for the organization, effectively communicate that value, and 
provide people with the tools and products that demonstrate that exceptional value. 
The manager who is able to place the interests of their customers internal or external, 
clients, and other groups in the organizations first will succeed the best.
In a later chapter, we talk more about structure and reporting but it is important to 
think about how a SOC manager plays a role in the overall organization. This person 
could be the CISO for a smaller organization or report into a larger security or IT 
department.

Shall we play a game? (War Games, 1983)
SOC GAMES
Now that we have reviewed all the personnel and their functions in the SOC, we 
now have to get them to start protecting our organization and we need to keep them 
engaged. We know who the players are, what their functions are and what they are 
supposed to be focused on accomplishing in the SOC. But let us be real honest for 
a moment, depending on the size of your SOC and the size of the organization you 
are protecting or if you are a managed security services provider, the daily grind of 
working in an operations center can be very boring at times with limited sprits of 

121
﻿ SOC games
excitement, it is like fishing without the sun and beer. Analysts review tickets and 
decode packets of data and try to find out if the bad things their systems are telling 
them that happened really did happen or if it is just a false positive. Typically the 
work should be a dull roar unless you are dealing with active threats on the front line 
and engaged in crazy attacks and breaches every day as some MSSP organizations 
are. For an analyst that is required to work tickets and may even have a quota of tick-
ets they need to work are going to suffer eye strain and after a time will want to start 
to skipping steps just to get the work done. Another thing that might happen is that 
they analysts will only pick the tickets they want to work on instead of the tickets that 
are a priority to work on. This does not do anyone any good and drastic mistakes can 
occur, things can get missed or signs of larger issues can go ignored. To combat the 
eye strain, and sometimes repetitious work people have to do in the SOC the manage-
ment team needs to come up with creative ways to give them frequent breaks, help 
keep people engaged, excited, and also progressing in their career.
One of the ways to help keep people sharp and engaged is to play fun games that 
help keep the focus on the prize of securing the organizations environment. To start 
you could run a contest that keeps score of analysts and engineers ability to stop 
specific types of threats. The more creative you are the better it will be and the more 
fun you can have with it. This could be games that run a full month with a total scor-
ing system or a one hit wonder with a single prize at the end. You can allow people 
to wear funny hats or dress causal for a month and you could even award the win-
ners with an assigned parking space until someone beats their score or maybe until 
another winner is announced.
The cricket dartboard game is a good example of how you could accomplish this. 
You assign different types of true positive events to a value that aligns with your or-
ganizations security policies, for example: The numbers 20 thru 15 and the bull’s eye 
are used and are assigned a specific true and validated event that an analyst or engi-
neer needs to find. Anyone can “hit” any number in any order but once an individual 
has scored three hits on the same number that number is closed for them and they 
cannot score any longer on that value. A player who has closed all of the numbers by 
finding these types of events first wins the game.
Bulls eye = Unauthorized data transfer out of the network
20 = Detection of advanced persistent threat (APT)
19 = Successful use of default passwords on the network
18 = Successful cross site scripting attack
17 = Phishing email found with malware
16 = Unauthorized device found on the network
15 = Active virus found on system
You can also provide a double and triple score for each of these based on who the 
user is or how serious the event is. For example, if someone finds a virus talking to 
a command and control server on the CEO’s laptop (or if you are in the military you 
can do it by rank) that may be an instant triple 15. Or for example, if it is determined 
that an Advanced Persistent Threat actor has compromised a system and you have 

122
CHAPTER 5  Your most valuable resource is your people
evidence that they tried to move laterally to another system then that may be a double 
20. You will have to come up with your own system and score values but you should 
be able to see how this could be an easy and fun game to play. You should also add a 
prize value to winning, for example you could take the first three people to complete 
the board out for a nice dinner or give the first winner $500, second winner $250 and 
the third place winner $100. Either way, it is something that can help keep people 
engaged, get them thinking about different types of threats and will make them seek 
out different types of events that are important to the organization and not just work 
the issues they are comfortable working, or focus on one specific issue that may be 
in their comfort zone.
First one to root wins!
Defending your network or servers from being breached by a hacker or by ad-
vanced persistent threat actors should be amongst one of your biggest concerns. Or 
if you are trying to strengthen your controls because this has already happened once 
before and now you realize that you are more of a target now than you were before 
then you can set a bounty on a specific event that would find evidence that this is type 
of activity is taking place. The contest would simply be the first person that finds an 
unauthorized external actor accessing an internal system or server with administra-
tive level credentials wins. Of course you never want to see this happen but we all 
know that having a system compromised is not a matter of if but when. So when this 
does happen, are you able to detect it and is the unauthorized access at an administra-
tive level. In different SOCs, I have tried this game with a $1,000 prize to the first 
person that was able to find this activity on the network. It was a great motivator and 
the direct result was that analysts and engineers were evaluating and analyzing events 
and tickets to a depth that were never seen before. They were really taking the time 
to ensure that they knew what was going on and why something was happening in 
the hopes it would lead them to the prize. The direct benefit to the organization was 
a better quality of analysis on tickets and a nice motivator for the staff. The positive 
effects lasted long after the contest was over because the analysts were more edu-
cated in evaluating these types of events and the quality of work in the related type of 
tickets improved tremendously.
Other simple games can be played as a group that will help motivate your SOC 
to support them in avoid the day-to-day grind. You could offer them simple rewards 
like bringing in food for lunch if they meet or exceed specific Service Level Agree-
ment goals like answering the phone by the third ring 100% of the time in a week. 
Another goal may be to ensure every new ticket is addressed in 15 min or less for 
a month. The prizes and contests should be customized to your SOC and what will 
motivate your people. Take a look at your metrics or your security goals and you will 
easily find areas that will need improvement, then try to see how you can rap those 
improvement areas into very specific targets. Then ask your team what they want for 
a prize and see what kind of answers you get, you may find that they would love to 
have a more comfortable chair, or a bigger desk. If your SOC manager or even your 
CEO has a really comfortable chair, maybe you can offer up your CEO’s chair for 
a week to the winner. Not every game has to have a cash value, make it fun and be  

123
﻿ Do not forget your people
consistent, you could do a game every month or just on special occasions or when you 
see issues and need a shot of motivation. Be creative, just because the SOC has a serious 
role does not mean you cannot have fun while you are keeping watch of the network.
SPECIAL PROJECTS
Sometimes games are just not enough and will certainly not resolve all problems. 
Sometimes people in a SOC just need a break and need to get away from the ticket 
queue for a while. This could become a big moral issue and when people really start 
to get eyestrain and board as an analyst they will want to move on and leave the 
organization. If you are properly investing time and money into training your staff 
then you will not want them to move on so you need to keep them interested and 
engaged. One great way to do this is to assign special projects. There is almost never 
a shortage of things to do in a SOC or in the overall security organization so special 
projects should always be available, if not then there may be something else wrong. 
Anyway, figuring out a list of special projects that needs to get done is a great way to 
not only help mature your SOC and move forward but giving out those special proj-
ects can greatly help and motivate people in your SOC. By giving someone a special 
project even a short-term special project you are telling them that you are confident 
in their abilities and that they have skills that you would like for them to utilize. Not 
only should they be excited to take on a special project but this should also be a nice 
break from working a ticket queue for a while. Special projects can really be almost 
anything and will greatly depend on what your needs are for your SOC and your 
organization. But they could be something as simple as updating training documenta-
tion or building a new training program or as complex as helping an engineer with a 
new product implementation. Another great project is the developing or exploring of 
new metrics or reports or even giving someone the opportunity to build new visual 
displays for the SOC video wall or projectors. These are just really simple ideas but I 
am sure you could find better ones in your SOC. The special projects can be simple or 
complex, they can be a way for you to see if an individual is ready for advancement 
or just a way to help break up the work load and definitely a great way for you to help 
give people a break from a relentless queue of tickets.
DO NOT FORGET YOUR PEOPLE
You SOC will only work as hard as you work for them. People like to be recognized 
for the work they do, sometimes they want this a bit too often or even when they 
do not deserve it but that is just human nature. Sometimes people working for an 
organization think they should get an award for just showing up to work on time. 
Whereas other people pull their own weight as well as the weight of several other 
people and never get recognized for all that they do. The people who work in a SOC 
environment need to constantly dig deeper, they need to be on the lookout for attacks 
coming from every direction and they need to be able to detect and defend against it 
all whereas the attacker just need to be right once. The members of a SOC have to 

124
CHAPTER 5  Your most valuable resource is your people
monitor several to several hundreds if not thousands of servers when an attacker just 
needs to focus on one. The people in a SOC work hard to keep their skills up and 
constantly learn new things so that they can be better prepared for whatever comes 
their way. A SOC can see hundreds or even thousands of events populated into tickets 
a day out of billions of possible logs but an attacker just needs to hide one malicious 
payload inside one needle in that haystack. Analysts and engineers need to remain 
focused and ensure they get the best fidelity they can with the tools they are given or 
have designed. Make sure you take care of your SOC so that they can take care of 
the entire organization.
Some organizations have formal recognition programs such as employee of the 
month. If they do, then it is important that SOC management make sure that every sin-
gle month someone from the SOC team is nominated. Continue to nominate people 
even if the nominations are not accepted. It may seem like a small thing but to some 
people simple recognition goes a long way and management should never miss an op-
portunity to positively recognize the efforts of individuals. Other organizations have 
informal recognition programs that allow anyone to nominate any other person for a 
nominal cash reward for going above and beyond. These programs should be popular 
and encouraged by management. If none of these formal organizational programs ex-
ist, management can still take the initiative to support the SOC and do special things 
as a group. The SOC is a team, they work hard together so getting them involved in 
team or group activities should not be very difficult. Plan a team BBQ or cookout dur-
ing working hours and rotate people from the SOC to take a break outside for a while. 
Since most SOCs are dark and closed off rooms this should be a welcomed change on 
a nice day. If you run a 24×7 SOC, plan on doing the cookout later in the day so that 
your first and second shift can overlap. For the third shift you can do an early morn-
ing cookout before the other shifts. I know cooking steaks at 7:00AM may not be the 
most appetizing things for you but I am sure the people who have to work the over-
night shift will appreciate it. If doing a big BBQ or cookout is just not possible then 
there is always the ability to bring in Pizza, or have you ever thought about how many 
burgers you can get from the drive through window for only one dollar each, it is a 
lot and you can feed quite a large SOC for very little money. Food is typically always 
a welcome treat in a SOC, so do not think you need to go overboard to recognize the 
efforts of the SOC, sometimes it is the small things that go the furthest.
As it has been mentioned before there will come a time in which the organiza-
tion your SOC is working to protect will be successfully attacked and compromised. 
Keep in mind that this is not the time to beat up the SOC, instead you need to look at 
how it happened, perform root cause analysis and ensure that the SOC has the right 
tools, processes, and procedures to prevent it from happening again. Additionally 
you should think about what would have happened if the SOC were not there and 
what kind of chaos would have ensued if professionals were not available to find the 
issue, even if it was after the fact. The SOC will not always protect the organiza-
tion from every attack but will be able to defend against most. They should be able 
to detect and limit the exposure from a successful attack while being able to direct 
incident response and help guide any recovery efforts.

A SOC is not your normal business office atmosphere where people show up to 
their offices or cubicles everyday on mostly their own schedule or within an accept-
able time range. In most office environments, people can customize or personalize 
their offices or cubes to give them a sense of comfort or a feeling of home. In a 
typical SOC that operates 24×7 that is not possible, shifts will share desks and 
computers where personalization is difficult or impossible. The life of someone 
who works in a SOC is different, make no mistake about it, no matter how it looks 
or what the space is that you use, if you have a SOC, it is going to be different. 
Your SOC is on the front line protecting your company by paying close attention to 
details while rushing to address all priority events stacking up in the ticket queue. 
It needs to be different, the environment needs to be open, people need to work 
together, work with each other and count on each other for knowledge, direction,

CHAPTER 6  Daily operations
and information. Your SOC needs to be a supportive environment where people 
are challenged so they can grow and so they come in every day ready to find that 
needle in a haystack.
It is an interesting ecosystem that needs to be protected and understood to ensure 
that your staff continue to perform at their best. Your daily operations are critical to 
the flow of this ecosystem. You have to be mindful of the work tempo, the workload, 
and individual relationships between people on-shift, between shifts, and with man-
agement. Set up your operational schedule up front but do not be afraid to experiment 
and try new things, as no two SOCs are ever alike.
The SOC is charged with the responsibility of being the first responders to infor-
mation security incidents and events, they are also protectors of the organizations 
infrastructure, data and, in some cases, the personal electronic protection of the or-
ganizations employees and members. Analysts and engineers need to be held to high 
standards of conduct, integrity, and job knowledge. As such there are specific expec-
tations and routine daily tasks that need to be performed to ensure that operations 
happen smooth and efficiently. To ensure continuity and job process integrity are 
maintained by everyone in the SOC and across all SOC shifts or all geographically 
separated SOCs. Specific policy and procedures need to be developed in the SOC 
and documented for everyone to follow. One of the most important of these policies 
and processes is the SOC daily standard operations procedure (SOP) that provides 
guidelines for everyone to follow. This chapter represents some of the items you will 
want to consider implementing in your SOC as part of the daily SOP. It is not meant 
to be all inclusive as your organization will have other considerations or items that 
are specific that will need to be included here.
PROBLEM AND CHANGE EVENT COMMUNICATIONS
MASTER STATION LOGS
Sometimes referred to as an analyst log, a Master Station Log (MSL) is a great way 
to capture events that happen outside of a ticketing system or does not have a place 
to be ticketed such as something that occurs around the SOC but has no place for a 
true record to be stored. Additionally, the MSL is a great place to highlight items of 
importance that need to be communicated across multiple teams, shifts, or SOCs. The 
MSL can be a simple text document that is shared, a workgroup based website like 
SharePoint or a formal software application that is installed on a server. Either way, 
the MSL is the official narrative record maintained to document and communicate 
significant events. As a minimum, like a mini ticketing system, all the entries should 
contain, the time of the entry, the name of individual making the entry, and the specific 
details relative to the entry. These entries are necessary for internal communication 
between shifts and the security groups to affectively monitor ongoing organizational 
issues that could affect security visibility or the operations in general. It is also a good 
tool in helping to bridge the gap between shifts or SOCs when issues span multiple 
time zones or have a lasting impact from one shift to the next.

127
Shift turn overs
The events below are an example of what should be reported at a minimum within 
the MSL.
• 
Network outage—Any disruption in services that affects the organizations users 
the ability to perform their job function such as the loss of LAN, WAN, or VPN 
connection.
• 
Security outage—Any disruption in security equipment or networks that reduce 
the visibility of the SOC and limits the ability to perform security services.
• 
Patching/update notifications from IT or security engineering—Any patching/
update notifications to include but not limited to IDS updates, SIEM rule 
updates, security system reboots, or major maintenance and upgrades. This 
should include expected service and server down times and what loss of 
functionality should be expected.
• 
Hardware failure—server, router, or switch that is has been determined as down 
or offline and could be degrading performance or causing latency in event 
detection.
• 
Special visitors to the SOC such as management, contractors, or auditors.
• 
Environmental issues such as construction, heating and cooling issues.
• 
Special announcements made by management
A team leader at the end of every shift should email the MSL or a copy out to the 
entire SOC organization. This will help ensure that everyone is on the same page and 
that items that need to be closely watched are documented and communicated effec-
tively. It should be everyone in the SOCs responsibility to review the MSL upon start 
of their shift to ensure they are familiar with anything that may affect their ability to 
perform their job function or for anything that they may need to be addressed while 
on shift. It should also be very easy for SOC leadership to read three reports from the 
previous three shifts and be completely up to date on what is going on and any issues 
the SOC is currently facing.
SHIFT TURN OVERS
Shift turnover is an extremely important part of the shift in a SOC. This is the chaotic 
time where one shift of people is ending their day and the next shift of people has 
arrived to start their day. Procedures for performing a shift change should be agreed 
upon by all the team leads and then posted, trained, and adopted by all members of 
the SOC. Everyone should know the process to start a new shift and exit the old shift 
to ensure that there is a clean handoff and that all the required important information 
is passed along.
To help facilitate the handoff process, each shift should be scheduled with an 
approximately 15–30 min overlap. This allows for a bit of flexibility in case there 
are ongoing issues that people need to finish up or if there are unforeseen issues 
with people showing up on time. The process should start off with all SOC employ-
ees spending the first 10 min of his or her shift communicating with the analyst or 

128
CHAPTER 6  Daily operations
engineer they are replacing regarding special concerns or critical information. While 
this conversation is happening, the outgoing analyst or engineer should be finishing 
up any tickets or calls they may be engaged in and then focus on cleaning their work 
area for the next person.
The senior shift lead would be responsible for putting together a turn over report 
that would be emailed to everyone along with the MSL. The shift lead should gather 
everyone from the shift prior to them leaving for the day and interview each person 
in a quick stand-up round robin fashion. If any analyst or engineer has a specific issue 
or items of importance then they communicate it in this rapid-fire forum. The team 
lead should make notes, ask questions and ensure that they have all the information 
they need to pass along and ensure that items are addressed properly. Depending on 
your SOC you may want to formalize roles for this end of shift stand-up report. You 
could include specific metrics like the number of open events that are being left for 
the next shift to address, or any specific outages or viruses that are causing problems. 
Set a specific starting time for the shift change meeting for each shift and enforce 
it consistently. Make sure you emphasize how important it is for everyone to attend 
and to not hold up the group, everyone wants to leave work at the end of their shift so 
being held up by one person is not fair. Because one shift is ending and another shift 
is starting, the meeting must be completed in a timely manner as to not interrupt the 
work of the incoming shift and you do not want this to go very long, just long enough 
to transfer the important details.
The senior lead gathers all the information deemed important to the oncoming 
shift from the analysts, engineers, and intelligence teams and generates an end of 
shift email report. The turn over email report will need to be emailed to all SOC ana-
lysts, SOC management, or anyone else that would benefit from the information dai-
ly at the end of each shift. It should at the minimum captured any critical events that 
happened on shift that the oncoming shift needs to make a priority, a brief rundown 
of shift happenings such as system changes, signature updates, rule modifications to 
SIEM tools, a list of tickets that was worked and that need continued investigation, 
any other information that the current shift might think will be helpful to the oncom-
ing shift and last but not least it should include relevant cyber intelligence or attack 
trends that may impact ticket-able events that the shift will likely see.
Between the SOC shift report and the MSL, it all seems like a lot of information 
and can even be information overload. If you have never been a part of the process 
before or you are new to the SOC it will be overload but you will quickly get the 
hang of it and will be able to quickly pick out the important bits that relate to you 
fairly easy. These reports will change over time and I encourage everyone to try and 
make these processes better and find better ways to pass on information. More is 
better when you are doing your shift change, just try and work on how to present the 
information as best and clear as possible to ensure that everyone has a good grasp on 
what is going on and what is required for them on their shift.
Each shift coming into the SOC needs to perform some procedures to ensure that 
everything is setup and working properly. As we discussed, there will already be a 
hand off process so the incoming shift should be fully updated in the previous shifts 
activities. The next set of tasks they need to perform is to ensure that all required 

129
Daily operations calls
tools and systems are properly functioning. They should reset the video wall and any 
projectors to make sure that nothing is hung or stuck, the shift team should check the 
phones, network connections or any other important technology. If you not running a 
24×7 SOC then you need to make sure that phone lines ring into the SOC instead of 
going to voicemail or an on-call pager. A written process should be created that each 
shift follows and any issues or discrepancies should be noted or escalated to the proper 
people to be resolved. Another important consideration is if your handoffs are prob-
lematic and items are being dropped or lost, consider staggering your team leads. Have 
the team leads shifts start and end a few hours overlapped into each shift. That way 
you have a single team lead spanning two partial shifts as continuity. Also as we will 
discuss later, having different people in different roles work different length shifts may 
also help with continuity between shifts. For example if you have the majority of your 
shift working 8 h but two people work 12’s then they can help with the change overs.
DAILY OPERATIONS CALLS
Depending on the activity level in your SOC or current threat level of your 
organization you may want to institute a daily operations call. This call would be 
for your SOC management, team leads or engineering leads that need to perform 
a verbal review of the day’s activities or expectations for incoming shifts. It could 
be a stopgap measure for management to get better control and visibility into daily 
operations or it could be a permanent tool that is used to keep everyone in the loop 
as to what is going on for hot items in the SOC. This is very different from a shift 
change process, as it will include people who are either not in the SOC or not even 
be in operations, it could include leads from sales, customer service or IT, depending 
on your organization. The daily operations call is a management review where SOC 
leadership gets to report on highlights of the day to management. This could include 
internal or external customer issues, missed SLAs, ongoing incidents or upcoming 
events that are significant to the operations team such as network maintenance or 
outages that may impact operations. The SOC leadership can bring people into the 
call that they think will add value, this could even be an analyst that is working on 
a particularly sensitive issue that would be able to answer questions or add valuable 
details. The meeting should last no longer than one hour and in most cases should 
be less. During times of critical issues the meeting could include individuals internal 
to the organization that want to keep close tabs on issues but this is not the time to 
perform incident response (IR), it is a management review and update call.
The format for this call should be very simple, it should be the senior team lead 
or manager reporting on activity that they deem to be important or what they think 
will impact performance moving forward, such as an outage. Then SOC management 
or security management such as a CISO would have an opportunity to comment or 
weigh in on each of the topics and provide guidance or take action items to resolve 
problems. This is a great way to ensure that there is good communication throughout 
the entire SOC organization and that management is properly engaged. Not only is 
it good to ensure management is engaged but it also gives them a good opportunity 

130
CHAPTER 6  Daily operations
to ask questions, make course corrections or provide them with valuable inputs that 
they need in order to address issues externally. There are two possible times that this 
call should happen. The first logical time would be after the first shift change, at the 
start of second shift. This would typically be at the end of the normal workday about 
5:00 p.m. Depending on your SOC and if you run a 7×24 or have many SOCs around 
the world you may also want to consider a morning call as the primary call. By doing 
this call in the morning at about 8:00 a.m., you can get information at the end of third 
shift and help set the stage for first shift, but it may also be the start of second or third 
shifts elsewhere in the world. If the management calls seems to work then do not shy 
away from using it, there is no reason to not have two calls, one could be in the morn-
ing and the other can be in the evening, either way you will be able to capture inputs 
from all shifts and have good high level discussion, if you place the calls carefully 
in-between shifts and logically to how you split your shifts then you should be able to 
keep up to date on all important activity.
CRITICAL BRIDGES
Because the SOC deals with critical issues that affect the confidentiality, availability, 
and integrity (CIA) of an organizations data and systems, it is important that when 
there is an incident that impacts the CIA for an organization that communication be 
handled quickly, efficiently, and properly. Sometimes depending on how the incident 
effects an organization or who it affects you will need to swarm the issue. An emer-
gency hotline or critical bridge may be a way to break outside of the normal processes 
and get the right people to the table to address and resolve issues quickly.
In many cases, escalation to authorities, engineers with different skill sets or to 
people with different access privileges may be necessary. The SOC is sometimes 
not in a position to take action all on its own. In some cases, the SOC is only  
responsible for monitoring a system but cannot make any decisions about it. The 
analyst needs to know who to call to get approval to remediate a threat or to get 
someone who can make a needed change that would prevent or fix an issue. The 
SOC procedures must be documented and have some rules on escalations or when 
to establish a critical bridge. It should be noted that an analyst should have the 
power to establish a critical bridge at any time if they deem it necessary, nobody 
should get in trouble for starting up a critical bridge if it was determined that it was 
not necessary. You need to make sure that your analysts feel comfortable engaging 
and asking for help.
Depending on your organization, the critical bridge escalation procedures could 
be based on the type of system, the type of attack or the business/organizational unit 
affected. The choice very much depends on how your organization operates, where 
the risks are, and what works most efficiently for your organization.
Ever wish you had a big red phone that you could just pick up and the right person 
or people will already be at the other end of the line waiting to help you? Well this is 
how you can accomplish pretty much the same thing at the time of crisis.

131
Critical bridges
Swarming is not a new concept but using it in a critical operational environment 
with potential remote or geographically separate resources can be a simple thing 
to overcome. By swarming an issue, you quickly bring a diverse group of experts 
together in order to assess and solve complex problems as a team. When you swarm 
a technical issue like this it could be a quick 5-min call where someone jumps in 
after hearing the initial problem and then clicks a few buttons and all is good or it 
could be several hours where multiple people are diligently working to resolve a 
large problem.
A phone bridge or standard conference call number can be established and all 
the key people you want to be a part of the critical call or emergency hotline can be 
given that information to be programed into their phones. Then a webpage can be 
established that includes the ability to send out a group text/SMS message that noti-
fies everyone that his or her presence is required on the conference call for a critical 
issue. The text message can either go out to a primary person or if you are able to add 
logic to your system a secondary or backup person. You also want to ensure you have 
a paper version that documents this process that details everyone who would need to 
be on the emergency hotline, their phone numbers and who their backups are in case 
they are unreachable or on vacation.
In case of a critical or major incident defined by your organization, which could 
include a system being attacked, a potential compromise, a denial of service attack 
or even an unplanned outage, an analyst can, as part of or in addition to IR processes 
initiate a critical bridge. This can happen any time day or night, it does not matter 
what time it is as long as the bridge is established in a reasonable time after a critical 
incident is detected and not too long where participants cannot be effective in mak-
ing positive remediation’s or key decisions. If it takes too long to establish the bridge 
and get all the right people engaged then there may be too much damage for anyone 
to do any good, so the calls need to be made quickly after incident discovery and 
classification. Because these calls can happen at any time you may want to develop 
a process that has different people on an easy to understand call rotation so that the 
same people are not being woken up every night.
Once the bridge has been opened and all required personnel are present the SOC 
will brief everyone of the status of the incident. This brief will consist of where the 
incident is occurring, who is causing it (if known), what the incident consists of, how 
long the incident has been going on, and what the potential root cause of the incident 
is. After the briefing, the SOC will give its recommendations for remediation of the 
incident, and then open the floor for discussion. During this time, the remainder of 
the SOC team who are involved will continue their investigation of the incident and 
provide updates to the bridge as necessary. Once an approved remediation step has 
been decided upon, the SOC or engineering will implement the solution and provide 
an ongoing status to the bridge. If it is considered necessary by the bridge team to con-
tact the vendor of the system, the owner of the system or anyone else that can provide 
value to the team, the SOC will initiate the contact with them. The addition of any 
further resources can be done on an as-needed basis and would depend on the issue. If 
the initial remediation action fails or is not complete, the SOC may deem it necessary 

132
CHAPTER 6  Daily operations
to escalate to a management in order to inform them of any potential impacts or cus-
tomer issues that may result from the event. This gives management an opportunity 
to get ahead of the problem and make any arrangement for initiating proper customer 
communications or may even allow them the chance to authorize a partial disaster 
recovery plan to get business flowing again if it is impacted. Management may also be 
needed to approve the removal of systems from service or to rapidly rebuild systems, 
regardless of action, management should know if there is any impact to business ser-
vices or any impact to customers.
Additionally if the critical incident is deemed to have a data loss that would be 
consider a breach or loss of credit and payment card information or a loss of personal 
health information then other specific groups must be involved as part of the bridge 
escalation process. The groups that you may want to include are legal or a privacy 
department but maybe if you are a large retailer you may have a banking depart-
ment or credit department that has ultimate responsibility for breach notification to 
the acquiring banks or credit card companies as required by contract. There may be 
very specific state, federal, or international laws that you will need to follow after 
detecting a data loss. By including other groups in the call once you have positively 
determined a data loss then you are going to give those groups the best opportunity to 
make key decisions and to make notification to the proper authorities in a reasonable 
amount of time. It is important for effective daily operations that the SOC work with 
the organization to understand who would need to be contacted and when for various 
types of incidents and who would need to be engaged on a critical bridge at the time 
of significant incidents. Depending on the type of incident, its criticality and who 
needs to be engaged, it would not be uncommon to have two critical bridges going 
at once. The first bridge can be for technical experts working together to resolve the 
issues and the second bridge can be for management and other business resources. 
This way the conversations can be kept separate and will not get people confused or 
taken off track of their primary focus. The SOC would act at the liaison between the 
two calls and would provide updates to both bridges on regular intervals or when 
important information needs to be relayed.
Once remediation is successful, the incident is considered closed. The bridge 
will be closed and the SOC will begin building a post-mortem briefing that will be 
delivered to all involved parties and should include any compliance teams in the or-
ganization as well, if available. The briefing will include details around the original 
event, a complete timeline, who participated on the bridge and what remediation 
actions were taken. It should also include a root cause analysis and a list of action 
items that would be needed to prevent future occurrences. It is important that when 
performing root cause analysis and post-mortem briefings that the documents are 
kept factual and that the process is not used as a weapon against other teams or evi-
dence as to how someone is not doing their job. For example, if the IT department is 
responsible for security patching on servers and an attacker is able to take advantage 
of a vulnerability that was not patched, this is not the time to beat up the IT depart-
ment. Instead, make sure that you detail the vulnerability, the time frame in which 
the patch for the vulnerability was available and then you can make comments on the 

133
Critical bridges
need for increased efficiencies in patch management. The post mortem process can 
quickly turn to finger pointing and will often put people on the defensive, this takes 
away from the core focus of helping an organization becoming more secure. The 
SOC should always ensure they take a factual and passive approach to documenting 
deficiencies and let management and business leaders work through the challenges 
that may be present in an organization. Do not let passion to be secure or passion to 
provide the best service possible get in the way of achieving the goals of the SOC.
The following is a flow of how the critical bridge process can work, it is very 
similar to the overall incident flow but has the deviation of opening the critical bridge 
and managing the bridge process.

134
CHAPTER 6  Daily operations
IR
Auditing to regulations whether it be Sarbanes Oxley (SOX), Payment Card Industry, 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or whatever your indus-
try requires is a necessity. It is a good tool and sometimes is required to get Information 
Assurance goals moved forward. A security department and especially a SOC need to 
embrace auditing and work with auditors as best as possible and make things as easy 
as possible. But it seems that without fail, whenever I have built an enterprise SOC in a 
regulated environment I seem to always get an auditor from an external company that 
comes around to ask when the last time the SOC tested and practiced an IR.
Key point: You can interview your auditors, even ones provided by large external 
auditing companies to ensure you are getting the best value for your money.
Joking aside, the SOC performs real IR every single day and with every event that 
has a ticket created for it. The processes that the SOC has are exercised and used for 
the most part every single day. The SOC lives and breathes IR and as such are experts 
in this area. Everyone has different ideas about what should be or not be included in 
an IR process and many aspects of that process are specific to the organization that 
the SOC is working for. To that point, I do not want to spend a ton of time going over 
IR other than to lightly cover key elements in the SOC’s view into those components.
Incidents can occur in many different ways, so it is not realistic to provide de-
tailed instructions for every imaginable combination of attack or type of incident. 
Organizations should strive to prepare processes for incidents that use common at-
tack vectors or cases that are commonly seen in the environment. Different types of 
incidents merit different response tactics. There are many different types of attack 
vectors and specific handling measures that should be followed so all IR will follow 
a normal process that is repeatable, efficient, and logical.
Detection → Confirmation → Analysis → Containment → Recovery → Review
DETECTION
IR starts off with someone or something detecting and reporting of an event that 
needs a closer look. This could be a security system or IT infrastructure that sends a 
log into the SIEM environment and then gets ticketed into the SOC because it met 
specific thresholds or triggered specific rules. It can also be a user, system adminis-
trator or external entity that calls or emails in to report something. No matter how it 
happens, someone or something detects and reports an event.
CONFIRMATION
Once the SOC has a ticket with all the relevant information, the analysis can begin. 
The analyst will triage an event, work to categorize the event and try to find what the 
root cause of the event was. It is vitally important at this step that the analyst do their 
best to answer the basic question of how an event occurred. It is the real root cause 

135
Containment
answer to how it occurred or what impact it caused that sets off other wheels in mo-
tion. If an analyst confirms an event that has been ticketed is true and that it is either 
a threat from a malicious threat source or needs further action, then more processes 
will take place. If on the other hand if an analyst sees the event as a non-issue and can 
confidently close the ticket with a reasonable explanation as to why, then the ticket is 
closed and no further action would be required.
ANALYSIS
An in-depth investigation must occur by the SOC to know the full scope of what 
happened. Analysis or IR teams must establish how successful the attack was, all 
the systems that were compromised and all data that was access or removed from 
the devices if applicable. The full extent of the incident needs to be well understood 
and a complete timeline needs to be documented to ensure that all questions about 
the incident are answered. For example, analysts should not have any network traffic 
that is unaccounted for or that cannot be explained. Was there privileged access, were 
all logs collected, how long did the incident takes place, and what was the ultimate 
method of compromise. If any data was accessed an in-depth review needs to be per-
formed to understand the nature of the data and if it was intellectual property or regu-
latory protected data. During this analysis phase is when a determination should be 
made on how to escalate and communicate the incident. As we will discuss later, the 
communication plan will be a key document to use once analysis has been performed.
CONTAINMENT
If an event indicates that there is something bad happening or about to happen, then the 
event can instantly become an incident and the SOC needs to direct activity in order to 
have the event contained. The primary purpose of containment is to ensure that further 
negative impact does not occur. This could be the removal or isolation of a system from 
the rest of the network, enhanced monitoring, rerouting of network traffic or even the 
blocking or removing of an email now known to contain malicious attachments. There 
are many different ways to contain an incident and each will depend on the type of 
threat, devices, or data that is being threatened as what techniques you will use. Also, 
during the containment phase the SOC should be rapidly collecting information to un-
derstand the full scope of the incident. This information should include a list of any 
compromised systems or accessed systems, data accessed and a timeline should be gen-
erated. Additionally, network flows, IDS events, or any other data related to the attackers 
activities or the particular incident should be captured and stored in the ticketing system.
Just a word of caution, before you perform containment actions ensure you are 
working with the system owners in your organization or you are very aware of the 
outcome of any containment actions you take. If you are not careful the actions you 
perform could cause a worse consequence than the security issue you are trying to 
protect against.

136
CHAPTER 6  Daily operations
RECOVERY
The recovery phase can be as simple as reinstalling a server or workstation from back-
up or performing a fresh install all the way to a planned remediation event that includes 
a complete network shutdown and rebuild. A complete recovery event could include 
changing everyone’s passwords, making significant active directory policy changes to 
harden the environment, and applying security patches to everything. Depending on 
the type of event and what you need to do, your actions should not only recover your 
computing environment back to normal but also keep that type of event happening 
again. The analysis performed in the previous phase should be detailed enough and 
clear enough to know exactly what the vector of the incident was and how you would 
need to prevent it from happening again. The changes needed to be performed could 
be specific application changes, business processes, or network policy rule changes.
REVIEW
All incidents should have some form of a review whether it be a quality review, a root 
cause analysis review or an administrative review by legal, compliance, management 
or other interested parties depending on the scope and degree of the incident and out-
come. The final review and reports that the SOC generates for critical or high priority 
incidents must be completed in a reasonable amount of time to allow for external 
notifications within any legally mandated time period, if appropriate.
The review document, or root cause analysis document should answer all the ques-
tions anyone would ask. It should at a minimum answer who, what, where, when, 
how, and the impact of the incident. All of that information must be in the report so 
that there can be a better understanding of root cause or what deficiencies were pres-
ent in the network or the individually affected systems to allow the incident. It is also 
important to understand trends or motives of around the incident. A SOC needs to ma-
ture and these types of review documents will help make that happen faster and faster. 
By doing the reviews of individual tickets or incidents for quality control and getting 
feedback and questions about the incident and the analysis from different viewpoints 
is extremely valuable, but also doing larger more visible root cause analysis reports 
gives a SOC a detailed understanding of how they did and what they could have done 
better. It is a good learning tool and will help the SOC move from a reactive to proac-
tive mentality and will ultimately lead them to be more predictive.
We spoke about the maturity of the SOC before but this kind of review is a key 
ingredient to help make that maturity happen. You will know if your SOC is reactive 
in securing the organization because they will be focused on post incident detec-
tion, confirmation, analysis, containment, and recovery as we have just discussed. 
The SOC should always perform their tasks in the above way but if the focus is on 
the process and executing the process then they are reactive. Once the SOC starts 
to grow and mature they will start to be more proactive. This happens when the 
SOC has the ability to avoid threats against computers and networks through the 

137
Communication plan
understanding of the environment, working with different groups or departments in 
the organization and IT and be able to analyze potential future impacts along with 
the ability to implement defensive measures. Lastly, the analysis done on incident 
reviews and understanding trends and motive will allow the SOC to become more 
predictive. They will be able to anticipate future threats and vulnerabilities based on 
that strategic analysis along with threat intelligence, and the understanding of how 
the correlation of the two will impact the organization. The goal of maturing the SOC 
should not be to move the entire operations into a predictive mode. Instead you need 
to stay focused in each area while you move toward a predictive security posture. For 
example, performing forensics and malware analysis is an advanced skill set that you 
can either have in your SOC or use the services of an external third party or MSSP. 
The forensics and malware analysis function is reactive in nature but advanced as far 
as skill sets. The SOC should have advanced skill sets across each of the evolutionary 
areas in order to provide the best operations to secure an organization.
COMMUNICATION PLAN
The SOC should have a standard communication plan above and beyond what we 
have already talked about in daily operational management calls or critical bridges. 
This communication plan should detail all the different scenarios where distinc-
tive people should be contacted and what their contact information is when specific 
events or incidents occur. Organizations should work hard to establish the best IR 
communication plan as possible and it should be reviewed on a regular basis to en-
sure that lessons learned and organizational changes are accurately reflected.
The communications plan should include an easy to read table of contents that 
list specific types of incidents and page numbers or tab number. Each incident listed 
should have a short description of the event along with conditions in which an analyst 
would execute the communications procedure.
The procedure should be a list of functions or roles of people in the organization or 
outside the organization that would need to be contacted. Some of the communications 
would be through email where as more critical notifications would be direct phone call. 
Each incident would have its own listing of who gets emails versus who would get the 
phone call. The variation of who gets what would be listed on a case by cases basis 
based on the incident as different incidents would have different importance’s to differ-
ent departments or groups. The plan may just list the departments or individual roles 
that an analyst is to call, such as V.P. of IT Infrastructure or Security liaison to Legal, 
external marketing or communications. The plan should not list individual’s names in 
the description or procedure portion, instead the specific names and contact informa-
tion should be included as an easy reference in the back of the plan. This way the plan 
does not need to be updated every time someone changes phone numbers or positions.
Each person assuming a role in the organization that would have incident or 
breach notifications should have a simple record of contact information in the back 
of the procedure book. The information to include is basic:

138
CHAPTER 6  Daily operations
• 
Name
• 
Title
• 
Phone #
• 
Alternate phone #
• 
Email address
The number of people that can be included in the communications plan can be 
extensive, it may be more manageable to split the contacts up into different groups. 
For example, the first group could just be general SOC and IT management along 
with other closely interested people. For example, if you had an internal incident 
that was a violation of policy you may want to include SOC and IT management 
and also HR, but it may not necessarily be appropriate to contact legal right away. 
Instead you may want to save notification to legal as a secondary escalation. Then if 
legal believes that the person should be arrested or if there is going to be an external 
agency brought in then you may want to include public affairs as a third level of 
escalation notifications.
Additionally your notifications may not necessarily be just to individuals that 
are assuming roles in your plan. You may also want to reach out to vendors or third 
parties that may need to get involved to help or provide services. This could be an IR 
team as part of your managed security services, or just your Internet provider that can 
help you block specific types of unwanted traffic. If your SOC has a relationship with 
local law enforcement you may want to include them as well.
Here are some of the people you may want to consider being part of your 
communications plan:
• 
SOC manager
• 
Incident handler
• 
Legal affairs
• 
MSSP
• 
Privacy officer
• 
CIO or CISO
• 
Public affairs
• 
Internet service provider
• 
Internal audit local law enforcement
• 
Local FBI
• 
Bank
• 
Human resources
REGULAR WORKSHOPS
Once you have established your incident processes and communication plans you 
need to get on a program of continually improving upon the program and making 
sure everyone is up to date. You cannot just sit back and feel good that it is done be-
cause sometimes as soon as it is done you will find its time to update it.

139
Checklists
Annual or quarterly workshops are a great way to not only make sure that all the in-
formation is correct in the communications plans but that everyone still agrees with the 
processes. Brining organizational leaders together and the people who are part of the 
communications plan to discuss the detail of the plan will help to keep everyone knowl-
edgeable and up to date. The workshops can consist of an update of everyone’s personal 
contact information. It should also then talk about any metrics or challenges the SOC 
has had regarding the execution of the communications plan. Lastly there should be a 
table top discussion and sample scenarios that are discussed to see how people would 
respond, who would want to be notified and what details would trigger additional ac-
tions. These regular workshops are a great tool to help validate that the SOC processes 
are not only the right processes but that they are appropriately up to date.
The workshop is also a great training opportunity not only on the process itself 
but not everyone lives with security everyday like a SOC, so it is a good opportunity 
to discuss security, its importance, and the value the SOC brings to an organization. 
Do not miss a great opportunity to market the SOC and help bring the mission of 
security to the front of people’s minds.
CHECKLISTS
It is important to have some basic checklists that the SOC will use in the daily envi-
ronment. These checklists can be built into the ticket system that is used in the SOC, 
be a webpage, word document, or can just be paper copies. Either way, it is important 
for processes to be consistent and to ensure that analysts and engineers capture the 
right and complete information that is needed, make sure you have checklists that 
mimic your important processes.
The example below is an incident report form, this form could be used to document 
a specific incident and that would be used to distribute information to interested people 
or management. It should be factual and accurate and should include all the relevant 
information someone would need to make basic conclusions about the incident. The 
form should relate to a specific ticket and the ticket would have more detailed informa-
tion and back-up data to support the completion of this form. A status should be stated 
on a form like this, an open status would indicate that the form is being worked on and 
could be waiting for more input. Whereas an in-progress status may indicate that the 
form is complete but that action items or activities are still pending. Lastly, a closed 
status would mean that all actions have been take and the issue is now fully resolved.
The type of issue could be related to the category of the threat such as a virus, 
insider threat or denial of service and the result of the activity would also be detailed 
to include an indication if there was any outage as a result. To answer the question of 
who did it, you should try and determine the origin of the attacker. Sometimes it is 
easy because it could be an insider or unknowing accidental system administrator or 
it could be an external hacker and even a former employee.
The rest of the form is fairly straightforward and should be self-explanatory. Once 
complete a copy of the form should be associated or uploaded to the original ticket that 

140
CHAPTER 6  Daily operations
was used for the investigation and then it can be emailed or stored in a central location 
for others to review and comment on. The form can also be established inside of your 
ticketing system or in an IR portal. Completed form submissions can be automatically 
emailed out and also have the answers stored in a database. Depending on the criteria 
you use to complete these types of forms and how frequently you use them, it may not 
be a bad idea to perform a weekly or monthly review of all incident reports. You could 
have management representation as well as technical experts review the forms to make 
sure that needed action items are being taken care of and that if specific trends are 
emerging then those issues can be bubbled up to a more strategic level to be dealt with. If 
you have enough of these forms being filled out, you may even want to perform regular 
metrics and trend analysis on various elements in these forms as well, it may help you 
get a better idea on some of the organizations weak spots or at least be able to quantify 
the costs associated with your efforts in dealing with issues that are not getting resolved.

Shift schedules
Other types of forms can be useful but as you develop them but do not make 
them too ridged, allow for modification and alteration. All too often when you put 
a new form into operation you may quickly discover deficiencies or issues. Allow 
your forms and checklists to change as you grow, mature, and learn the needs of the 
organization you are protecting. Sometimes forms and checklists can come from 
necessity, if there are operational issues where people are not following direction or 
mistakes are occurring too frequently, enforcing that a checklist be completed can 
help not only be informative to ensure everyone knows the process and the required 
steps but will also help resolve any issues with people cutting corners or just not fol-
lowing process.
Other types of forms and checklists you may want to consider using are specific 
incident forms such as a checklist regarding what to do in the case of a credit card 
breach or loss of Patient Health Information. If your organization has lots of direct 
connections to other organizations through VPNs or direct links then you may want 
to checklist for how to handle incidents regarding third parties. The checklists do not 
have to be based on incident workflow, it could be for any process, but the primary 
checklist you will likely have will be based on either incidents or troubleshooting of 
tools in the SOC.
SHIFT SCHEDULES
Planning security operation shift schedules can be an art but the goal is very simple 
right? Just make sure you have the proper coverage during the hours you need it 
most.
One of the main questions I get asked about running a SOC is what the best 
schedule is to maintain and how to maintain schedules with SOCs that may be spread 
out all over the world. SOCs that want to run 24×7 will have its own unique staff-
ing problems and many of these will concern what the right recipe is for staffing 
levels and who they have to fill needed shifts. The fact that an organization offers 
security services or wants to monitor its network around the clock does not always 
mean that the staffing requirement will remain constant. You will need to make sure 
that the ebb and flow of staffing changes and fluctuations are properly reflected in 
your scheduling. You will most likely have your workday divided into something 
that resembles a shift, even if there is only one shift, which is a normal workday or 
weekend. Each shift will have different requirements in regards to staffing levels, 
skill mix and the type of role you need to be present in the SOC. For example, the 
workload in the SOC may require two people during the week but only one during 
the weekends. You will need to make sure that whoever is responsible for managing 
the staff schedule is fully aware of what will be needed for each shift and that they 
have the right reports and metrics to back up the schedule. For large operations, this 
is not just a case of devising one schedule and using it continuously without regard 
for changing conditions, you have to be able to adapt. The demands in regard to work 

142
CHAPTER 6  Daily operations
will always be changing in most organizations and staffing levels will need to reflect 
this, especially around the holidays and for international organizations you will need 
to consider staffing in all your SOC locations based on international holidays, not 
just the more popular or local holidays. The person looking after scheduling should 
be able to anticipate what is going to be needed for each shift and should be able to 
plan accordingly far in advance. Determining and maintaining optimal staffing levels 
is critical to efficiency of your operation. Overstaffing is costly and you may not have 
the required resources such as computers and desks to allow everyone to work, this 
may result in you sending people home so it is not just a cost to payroll, it is also a 
moral issue. If overstaffing happens to the same person over and over it could cause 
that person to lose interest in the organization and result in them having poor per-
formance on the job, as they will feel underutilized and not needed. On the flip side, 
understaffing creates can create stress and pressure on your SOC staff and also can 
cause excessive overtime. It can also become a safety risks from fatigue, absentee-
ism, and even cause burnout.
In SOCs that needs to operate 24-h a day will require several shifts filled with 
different people performing in different roles and who have distinctive skills sets to 
ensure that all the hours are covered and the right resources are available to deal with 
any incident or event that occurs during that shift. The first shift or day shift usually 
would start around 8 a.m. and go until 4:30 p.m. The day shift is a nice shift to have 
in a SOC because it is the most normal working hours. It would mimic what the rest 
of the organization and the world work for the most part. Second shift, evening shift 
or what is also commonly called the swing shift is a shift that starts in the late after-
noon at about 4 p.m. and runs into the late evening typically until about 12:30 a.m. 
Working on the swing shift can be demanding, especially for parents, as it requires 
unusual sleep schedules and does not work well with school hours for kids who may 
need daycare. Nevertheless, there are some advantages with being on the second shift 
for students as it may allow them to take courses in the morning and early afternoon, 
and then go to work in the evenings.
The third shift is also known as the night shift or graveyard shift. This shift will 
typically start at 12 a.m. and go to 8:30 a.m. The night shift can be very difficult to 
adjust to even if it is your permanent shift. A nice benefit to the night shift is that 
it does give you the day off to do errands, attend to kids or anything else you want 
because most places will be open for business once you get off work. People who 
work the night shift will typically stay awake for the day and sleep during swing 
shift so that their daily routine is the same as most people where they wake up, 
get dressed, and go to work albeit midnight. There are many different variations 
of shifts and schedules, and organizations will have to figure out what works best 
for their organizational goals, the SOC and their people. Typically, the more senior 
someone is in a SOC, the more he or she will be able to control their own work 
schedule or choose the shift that works best for them, while less senior people will 
usually find themselves on graveyard and swing shifts, rather than the usually cov-
eted first shift.

In smaller organizations, doing a standard workweek where people come in and 
work in the SOC an average of 8 h a day Monday to Friday may be sufficient. This 
does not mean that people will only work standard hours. Instead they can be on-call 
or configure their SIEM to alert them via SMS or email when something passes a 
threshold and triggers an alert that needs to be addressed. This is a great option for 
smaller organizations that cannot afford to hire lots of people for round the clock 
shifts. With a simple schedule like this you could run your SOC with only one or 
more people. Also, in smaller organizations it is typical to see network traffic be 
dramatically reduced after the normal workday is over. This is because there are 
less people on the network generating events, and triggering rules. This means that 
the rate of incidents will go down that require investigation and the SOC can let the 
system run on autopilot and just get alerts remotely when something is going bad. If 
this is a problem and people are not able to sleep at night because they feel nobody 
is watching the security of the organization then instead of hiring more people you 
can consider outsourcing to a MSSP. During the day, the internal SOC will handle all 
the regular Tier-1 events all the way up to the engineering issues but at quitting time 
the SOC can just turn over the initial triage and Tier-1 analysis to the MSSP. With an 
MSSP doing the overnight monitoring you can rely on them to analyze events and 
only call you when needed. Instead of handing off the analysis to an MSSP, you do 
not have to be an on or off type of relationship, you can keep the MSSP monitoring 
24×7 and your internal SOC can just handle escalations by the MSSP around the 
clock and perform IR as needed. If you only have one person running all of your 
security then you may also want to look to see if you have anyone in your IT orga-
nization that could be a suitable backup resource in case of that one person going on 
vacation or taking sick time.

CHAPTER 6  Daily operations
If the SOC needs to cover weekends because the organization is active or there 
are specific risks that need to be monitored for, then an 8×7 schedule can be used. 
In this schedule, you can do multiple things and start to get creative but as before the 
SOC is only staffed during normal business hours. You need at least two people to 
accomplish this schedule and have your weekends covered. With this schedule you 
have each person work one weekend day and only four work week days. This way 
each person still gets two standard days off but each has to work only 1 weekend 
day. This is also a nice option because they will still be able to work together, train 
together and advance security together during the 3 days that they are overlapped. 
Sometimes this schedule can get in the way of peoples personal time or family vaca-
tion plans when it is every single week that they need to cover a weekend day. The 
two people may be able to cover a shift for each other from time to time or a week, 
and then have it made up to them in a later week. Another option is to bring in a third 
person assuming the workload warrants it. This third person could work a normal 
Monday through Friday shift and cover on the weekends when needed. Also, keep 
in mind that having three people at the same time in the middle of the week may be 
too much, but it gives you the option of spreading things out and creating an optional 
rotation.
15×7
The next logical step once you need to grow the number of hours people are in the 
SOC is to move to a 15×7 schedule. This is a great option for an organization that 
may need to cover hours of operation in multiple time zones. If the SOC is located 
in the eastern part of the US and business hours need to be maintained in the SOC 
for the west coast then there are additional hours that need to be covered. Adding 
a second shift would easily cover the 3-h time zone difference. You can also easily 
move the two SOC shift hours to start earlier to cover GMT, Eastern, and Pacific 
Time zones.

When you move to a 24×7 schedule you need at least six people but with only 
six you leave no room for sick time or vacation time. It would be best to have at a 
minimum nine people working in your SOC for complete 24×7 coverage. This will 
allow several overlap opportunities and shift rotations to cover for any absenteeism. 
Adding in the third shift is an interesting dynamic and you need to pay close atten-
tion to how you operate this. The third shift can easily start to feel left out, as there 
may be less management members on a night shift, fewer opportunities for special 
projects and less options for training. If most training opportunities happen during 
the day then your third shift will be left out. Make sure you give them the option to 
stay late for early morning training or allow them to temporarily switch their shift for 
the duration of a training program.
As you grow larger you may have several combinations of each of the previous 
schedules all going on at the same time. You may find that what works best is that the 
analysts will cover 24×7 monitoring but engineers will only work 8×5. To compen-
sate for not having engineers physically available for every shift, the engineers can 
work out an on-call rotation. This way the SOC analysts can reach out to an available 
engineer at any time to assist with issues or problems. These on-call engineers would 
also be the ones to participate in management calls and critical bridges if needed. 
Additionally, SOC management may only work normal business hours but can also 
be on call for any critical problems that arise.
Different roles and responsibilities may be needed in the SOC at different times 
of the day or night or even weekends. The size of your SOC and the volume of work 

146
CHAPTER 6  Daily operations
that your SOC performs will also be a driving factor in how you manage your shift 
schedule.
OTHER SHIFT OPTIONS
12’s
One popular SOC shift schedule is to run is to have a few people on 12-h shifts. 
This is a great idea if most of the SOC members are on 8-hour shifts and a few are on 
12’s. This allows for greater consistency between shifts as you have individuals who 
overlap and are able to blend information for those two shifts. An individual who is 
going to work 12 h shifts will typically do 3 days of 12 h shifts in a week with 4 days 
off and then do 3 days of 12-h shifts with 1 shift of 4 h in a 2 week period. This way 
the SOC member gets a full 80 h across 2-week schedule. It is not advisable to try 
and run two 12-h shifts as your only shifts to cover the complete 24-h day. The 12-h 
shift can be popular with some people but not everyone as it could lead to a drop in 
productivity and fatigue. But some people will enjoy the extra days off that a 12-h 
shift will bring them.
4 Tens
Sometimes there are SOCs that will run 4 tens as an optional rotation. This is 
where people will work four 10-h shifts in a row with a 3-day weekend. You would 
run this the same as the 8×7 schedule where you will have overlapping days. The one 
advantage of doing this is you can get greater overlap in the shifts across 24 h and 
you will also have greater flexibility when looking to provide training to everyone in 
the SOC. Not everyone is cut out for this type of schedule and this will typically have 
the highest burnout rate. On the other hand people will enjoy having 3 day weekends 
every week and that may be a great moral booster.
FOLLOW THE SUN
I often hear about operations groups doing a follow the sun rotation to manage 
needed coverage for their SOC. The follow the sun shift rotation is where a SOC 
located in the Americas, Europe, India, and maybe the Far East have been estab-
lished. Each SOC will work during normal daytime business hours and hand over 
tickets and issues to the SOC in the next time zone as the day goes on. This seems 
to be a popular option and a logical one but I have seen more problems with this 
model then any problems it was designed to solve. This can be very expensive as 
you have a duplication of offices and facilities that go unused for 16 h out of 24 
when you are only running an 8-h shift. You also loose efficiency and accuracy in 
shift hand-off because it is not happening face to face unless you use video con-
ferencing. You also have to deal with inconsistency in training, customer service 
and skill sets. A better practice for the follow the sun shift rotation is to have one 

147
Shift rotation
primary SOC run 24×7 and have other SOCs around the world take on work as 
needed. This helps establish a base with core skill sets that will control the flow of 
work and will stay on top of escalations. The SOCs located in different countries 
can be established to help with international privacy laws regarding the moving of 
protected data outside of the country. Having international SOCs around the world 
can also help with local language support if you have customers or business units in 
foreign speaking locations. If you do have international or geographically separated 
SOCs make sure you work to blend them as best as possible. All the SOCs will 
need to share processes, knowledge and work load. If travel budgets are available, 
move people around from SOC to SOC, this will give them exposure to coworkers 
and allow them to build good working relationships with each other. It may also be 
a nice benefit to allow someone to do international travel for a few weeks, it gets 
them away from the daily grind and helps expand their experience while building 
new bridges with coworkers.
SHIFT ROTATION
Shift rotation is a practice followed by many organizations that work 24×7. Ana-
lysts and engineers working in the SOC will do a rotation of nights to days to swing 
shift and back again on a regular basis. Some people may feel that this is a fairer way 
of assigning shifts especially when people do not really like working nights. Keep 
in mind that people will encounter problems with this rotation system as it can be 
difficult for people to adjust to the time changes. Try to make sure that people have 
a few days gap to adjust otherwise people can start to have some health problems. 
Alternatively, it is preferable to have a permanent night shift where people are hired 
specifically to perform during those times. Keep in mind that for people who work 
the third or overnight shift you want to work out a way for them to get any training 
the rest of the SOC may get such as switching their schedules temporarily or trading 
them temporarily with someone who is on first shift that may already have the train-
ing. This training can also be given early in the morning as they are finishing their 
shift or later in the evening and they can come in earlier to start their shift.
The way you run a shift rotation is based on a 28-day revolution. A slow, forward 
rotation from day shift to swing shift to night shift will happen across the 28 days. 
It will take your four teams of people (which could only be 1 person per shift) to ac-
complish a complete 24×7 rotation and the average hours worked will be about 42. 
Because this is a shift rotation you provide at least 2 days off after any 7 working 
days and 3 days off after seven consecutive night shifts. This allows for recovery time 
and lets people adjust to their next 8-h shift schedule. The down side to doing this is 
that an individual will only get a free weekend once every 7 weeks and they will have 
to work one 7 consecutive days stretch and one 7 consecutive night stretch during 
that 28 day cycle. The good news is that everyone is only working 8-h shifts and the 
average overtime would only be about 2-h per employee per week unless you can cut 
people early off of a shift. Here is how it would look:

Deciding on the best shift rotation or schedule for your SOC can be a tough 
choice but do not do it alone, it is often a good idea to allow the people in the SOC 
to have some say in what way they would like to approach it or what schedules they 
would prefer to work. This way the people in the SOC will have more say in their 
schedule rather than having a certain shift rotation just thrown at them. It will never 
be possible to please everyone with any type of shift rotation or schedule but a gener-
al consensus should be able to be reached. Some SOCs will have less flexibility when 
it comes to deciding on the form of rotation and schedule because of the organization 
they work for and the hours that need to be covered, so it may be necessary to assign 
people purely on the basis of skill mix and availability to a specific shift.
DEALING WITH ABSENTEEISM
Nobody likes to have to deal with a member of the team that just cannot make it to 
work. That being said, it is going to happen and you will have to deal with it. The first 
thing you need to consider is a policy on not coming into work. In a SOC, it is differ-
ent that working a regular job especially in a SOC that operates 24×7. Typically an 
individual coming to start a shift in a SOC is going to relieve someone else so they 
can go home, but if they do not show up and your short-handed what are you going 
to do. From a policy perspective if a member of the SOC wants to call in sick they 
should do it at a minimum of 8 h prior to their shift. This gives team leads or manage-
ment time to find someone who can cover that shift. If the person calling out does 
so any less than 8 h it should count against them during review time and should af-
fect any raises or promotion opportunities and if continued issues occur they should 
be terminated. It is just not fair for everyone else when there is a lack of respect by 
someone who cannot plan far enough in advance as to not negatively impact other 
people, it does not make a good teammate and will lower moral in the SOC. How 
should sick calls handled? The shift lead or senior team lead needs to begin calling 
people who are not schedule to work to see of anyone can cover the shift. Optimum 
coverage would be the preplaned number of people who were designated to cover 
the shift but the team lead or shift supervisor may feel that one person will not make 
a difference and could decide to go without that one person for a day. Typically it 
would be best to find someone to cover the whole shift but you could also offer over-
time to people to work a half shift by asking them to stay late or even ask someone 

149
Dealing with absenteeism
on a later shift to come in early, as this may be a bigger attraction to an individual 
and it may help you get over a potential busy rush. Another option may be to offer 
call-back pay and round trip mileage for anyone willing to pick up an extra shift as 
well to entice people to help cover required shift gaps. This all seems logical when 
you are paying people hourly but it is also possible to give people additional pay and 
bonuses when they are salary so get creative, it will work.
There are a ton of sites on the web that can give you different ideas about how to 
best work your shifts, how to split the shifts and make things as efficient as possible. 
This brief overview of the different kinds of shifts and patterns that you can use in 
your SOC should help get you going in the right direction. Knowing where and what 
time you need the bulk of your SOC to operate is half the battle. Keep a good eye on 
your staffing levels for each of the different roles and skill sets you need in the SOC. 
Then make sure you monitor how effective events and incidents are being worked. 
Based off of those metrics you can add date and time stamps to see when things are 
falling through the cracks or when you have everything covered, then adjust your 
staffing levels accordingly.

Frequently I get questioned on how to train a SOC. The questions are also com-
pounded with issues regarding training across shifts or even how to apply consis-
tent training across multiple SOCs in different geographic locations. These are great 
questions and it is obvious that no SOC can be effective without the appropriate 
training of its staff.
With the number of people it takes to staff an operation, it is unlikely you will 
have the budget and capability to hire fully trained and proven staff that can come 
into your organization and hit the ground running. There are more things that a per-
son needs to know about security and working inside an operational environment 
than you can get out of any book. Every operation is different, objectives are dif-
ferent, and processes are different. So although you may be able to find people who 
know what an IP address is or how to read a packet capture, you are almost always 
going to have to train people on how to be successful in your organization.
Just a quick warning, you can always train someone who wants to learn and 
who is new to the career field. If they are hungry for the knowledge and have an 
aptitude for the technology then you should have no issues growing people in your

CHAPTER 7  Training
organization. It will be important for you to work hard to keep them motivated and 
interested. On the other hand, if you can afford to bring in people to your SOC that 
are experienced and skilled then you are very lucky but being able to do that brings 
other challenges. Typically seasoned security professionals will want to make some 
changes, re-engineer how operations work, or make modifications to the way they 
like to do things. This may not be a bad thing if that is what you are after but if not 
then you may have a challenging time ahead trying to teach an old dog new tricks.
Luckily, there are very good options for building an effective training program 
both free and at a cost but you will have to devote time to any program that you de-
velop. The good news is that costs can be controlled and easily budgeted for but at the 
same time you need to allow for ample training time for each and every employee. 
At the time of writing this, there can be found no real formal educational or train-
ing path specifically for security operations staff and there is limited documentation 
available, almost all the written material found comes from white papers, workshops, 
or internal slide presentations. Most of all training documentation is on specific tech-
nical tasks and skills, and while that is all very important, it is not specifically about 
job training in a SOC or how to apply those technical skills to a SOC environment. 
Organizations should use a wide variety of training programs, tools, and resources to 
train their staff. Training should be performed to bring new employees up to speed 
and help them quickly become proficient in their required job functions. The train-
ing should also help keep staff sharp and up to date with emerging technology or 
adversarial trends.
A good training plan will be well rounded and should include items such as:
• 
Internal functional training
• 
Internal skill set training
• 
Job task qualification training
• 
Tools and product training
• 
Formal training and certifications
•

INTERNAL FUNCTIONAL TRAINING
You have to give people a leg up when starting a new job; do not assume they au-
tomatically know where all the light switches are or where the bathrooms are. You 
should ensure you welcome your new people into your operation properly by giving 
them a few days if not a few weeks of new hire training. In many companies, a brand 
new employee may go through basic HR training to learn about the company, its 
health plan options, and other benefits but that is about it. Think about taking this a 
step further, ensure that your new employee gets a tour of the place and they know 
where all the important things are in the facility. Show them where important people 
sit and introduce them around to help them get acclimated to their new environment.

153
﻿ Internal functional training
Continue this training by teaching them how to do basic tasks like how to use the 
phone system, especially if you have a complex automated call distribution (ACD) 
system. Teach them about the computing environment that they are going to work 
in, ensure they know how to access all the tools and that they have all the internal 
company links that they will need, access to SharePoint or wiki or whatever.
Specifically, you need to focus on internal functional training that includes how 
to use the phones, access the building, where important documentation is stored or 
anything else that is very specific to your organization or your site that someone 
may need to know. This information is typically what is known as viral or tribal 
knowledge and is often never written down or documented. You may have internal re-
sources such as websites, databases, or information stores that are built and managed 
by employees and are extremely valuable resources. But they only get announced 
(maybe via a group wide email) to the people who need to use them once and if you 
hire a new person after the announcement of the availability of the tool then the only 
way they will find out about that resource is if someone thinks to tell them about it. 
This significantly reduces overall effectiveness of an organization and should be pre-
vented. Make sure that as you mature your operation center that you document any 
internal controls, tools and especially policies so that anyone new walking through 
the door can take advantage of all of it and be “in the know”.
As an example of what not to do, one organization I worked with was very proud 
of how they handled internal resources and believed that everyone had access to the 
tools they needed to be successful. Not only did they push out browser bookmarks 
to their SOC computers but they also had a resource page on their internal Share-
Point site that listed all the links to their tools. Unfortunately new employees did not 
automatically get access to the SharePoint site and each of the 50+ links required 
a user account to be set up and all were completely different access accounts from 
their network login, additionally there was no indication of whom to request access 
from or what even the resource was there to do. So they had a ton of great stuff but 
no documentation as to what it was or how to get access to it. Most people will take 
the approach that if I need something then it will be given to me instead of them ask-
ing for a resource that they think will help them or they may even be shy to ask for 
access to something they know exists. In most cases, people do not even know what 
to ask for because they do not know what is available. Spending time ensuring that 
internal knowledge and functions are documented and passed on to everyone in the 
organization is an invaluable activity that should not be overlooked.
Due to its extreme importance, as part of internal functional training, data han-
dling and classification should be fully reviewed on a regular basis. As your SOC 
is most likely responsible for breach and IR due to loss of data or compromise to a 
system potentially containing protected data, its vital that all members of your SOC 
fully understand and be trained on how your organization views the importance of 
data, what data is important from not only an internal intellectual property perspec-
tive but also a customer, regulatory, or government perspective. During an incident 
even the most experienced staff members can feel a high level of stress, this is when 
mistakes can happen, repetitive training on how to deal with sensitive information 

154
CHAPTER 7  Training
will help prevent what may already be a bad situation from getting worse. Unfortu-
nately, some of that stress results from the potential consequences of handling infor-
mation inappropriately.
Regular refresher courses should be conducted, as they are necessary to maintain 
a firm awareness as to why it is important to follow the established policies and 
procedures. But, by also performing repetitive training and even exercising some of 
that training you create muscle memory in the hopes that when something bad does 
happen your people will execute their duties properly, effectively, and professionally. 
It is also important to emphasize people’s responsibility to actually execute those 
procedures and enforce those policies.
INTERNAL SKILL SET TRAINING
Your employees need to know their job, this seems like an obvious statement but in 
an operations center it is more of a true statement than anywhere else. By the very 
nature of how the operation center is supposed to function, a tier 1 analyst has a very 
specific role and must be able to perform that role as flawlessly and as efficiently as 
possible. Later we will talk more about some of the specifics but as an example, for 
a tier 1-analyst function, the tasks they perform must be more prescriptive with very 
clearly defined outcomes or escalations. As you move up the tiers, you will move 
your tasks from being rigid and prescriptive to being more investigative tasks that 
require more thought in the process. The more you can document and train your staff 
to ensure repeatable outcome, the more consistent your SOC will be and the easier 
it will be to control. Some SOC’s management has even spent the time and effort to 
create an IR “runbook” or “playbook”. This is a very descriptive and prescriptive 
step-by-step process or checklist for different tasks that must be followed verbatim. 
This can even become part of an audit process by organizations outside the SOC. 
This way you can further help ensure expected results with specific and important 
types of tasks.
PLAYBOOKS AND RUNBOOKS
There is a reason why professional sports teams create binders of documentation de-
tailing their plays and executions of specific offense or defenses. This is because they 
train to those exact specifications and details in order to help predict or guarantee 
an outcome. When you have very specific steps that you can train people to, you are 
giving them a process that not only can be followed but also can more importantly 
be memorized. Memorization can make an individual more efficient in performing 
tasks and achieve predictable and desired results. If every time we did something it 
was new and we had to learn it from scratch then we would almost never get any-
thing done and never have processes that we can repeat. As you look around your 
organization you will find many different things you can document into your play/
runbook. But if you are looking around scratching your head because you just cannot 

155
﻿ Internal skill set training
find anything that would fit then you really need to look at your processes and review 
how productive your operation center really is.
Here is a basic idea of what some positions should be like in regards to training 
and documentation and in most cases playbooks can be created for each role or level 
in your operation.
Level
Training objective
Documentation needs
Tier 1
Quick, rigid analytical triage
Heavy and specific in processes, 
procedures
Tier 2
Deep analytical triage
Heavy and specific, room for 
some variance in analysis
Tier 3
Investigative, deep look
Resource refiner, trainer, 
documentation specialist
Engineer
Implement, repair
Vendor or outside resources, 
documentation creator
Management
Efficiency, reliable, and repeatable 
response
Heavy and specific, processes, 
procedures
JOB TASK QUALIFICATION TRAINING
As an extension of the skill set training, task qualification training is the next logical 
step in learning. This is not specific to just internal skill. Once someone reads about 
a function they are to perform and receives instruction on that function or even has 
it shown to them then they should demonstrate that they could do it. If the person is 
successful in performing a task and it is reviewed by an instructor or supervisor then 
they can be considered qualified. I know that this sounds very basic and maybe a 
bit of a pain but imagine the alternative. Suppose your internal or external customer 
satisfaction was being reduced because your level of communication has dropped off 
and after investigation you find that a few new employees were not comfortable with 
operating the phone system so they stayed away from using it. Once your employee 
has successfully demonstrated they can perform a function is a good idea to maintain 
a training record that specifies what the task functions are and a date when they dem-
onstrated they could perform it along with a signature of the person who witnessed 
it. This is extremely helpful not only to management who need to ensure they have 
properly training people working but also to the analyst or engineer who may want to 
know what they need to learn to better perform their job. Not all tasks are going to be 
able to be identified or built into a training plan or even tested as part of a qualifica-
tion but the more you can formalize the closer you can guarantee outcomes in your 
SOC as well as when you perform critical functions such as IR.
TOOLS AND PRODUCT TRAINING
Training your staff on the specific operation of the tools and products in use at your 
operations center is essential. You may hire specific individuals to perform various 
functions in your organization but it would be very rare to find someone who knows 

156
CHAPTER 7  Training
how to use all the systems deployed in your organization. Even if you could find 
someone who knows most of the products they will not know how you have them 
configured, deployed, or the processes you use to maintain them on a regular basis. 
Additionally, depending on the position of the person they may only need a basic 
understanding of the tool where others may need a more in-depth education on it.
Specific tool and product training does not have to be something that you pay for 
or that the vendor needs to provide for your organization but it can be if you want it 
to be. Instead you could easily have a SOC engineer or an internal security engineer 
develop specific training for the team. This does not have to be formal training where 
you have a professional set of slides, no need to boil the ocean here. Just focus on 
specific topics, it may be a good idea to use this type of training to address common 
mistakes or issues that you find happening in your SOC. To address those issues, 
reduce errors and make the team more efficient, run a training class on a specific tool 
or product and then focus on the problem areas. Show people the “right” way to do 
things and the way to drive better results. These focused trainings only need to be an 
hour long and will have an extremely positive impact on your team and their moral. It 
will help promote the individual who puts the training together and teaches the class 
to a team mentor as it helps expand the knowledge of the entire team. Some of the 
topics you could train on:
• 
New product management processes
• 
New futures coming out
• 
User interface tips and tricks
• 
General “How to”
• 
Advanced operations, hidden functionality or secretes
• 
Integration aspects with other tools or products
Typically tool and product training in your SOC would not cover topics such as 
setup and deployment of technology but rather the operation of the items as it is cur-
rently used in the environment. It should cover special configurations, rules, purpose, 
and any restrictions on use such as any adherence to audit requirements, change man-
agement, Privacy or data handling issues. You may also want to consider performing 
training on escalation procedures, fault or failure resolution of any tools, and even 
current known issues or problems. Product and tool training should be included in 
your regular refresher-training program. This way you can continue to build on pre-
vious trainings and advance the SOC together on specific topics. For these training 
sessions, it is best to keep the material very focused, short, and sweet; it should be a 
short session (1 h or less), do not try and teach an entire weeklong course in just an 
hour. People will be able to better grasp the materials and absorb the information you 
are trying to present when you bite it off in small chunks for them.
FORMAL TRAINING AND CERTIFICATIONS
If you asked me several years ago about formal training and certifications I would 
have dismissed them as a waste of time and money. I would have even gone as far 

157
﻿ Internal skill set training
as to tell you that a college degree is not a requirement to be successful in a SOC 
and that real world experience beats everything else. You might have guessed from 
my tone of the last two sentences that I have changed my view, but that would only 
be partially correct. As Information Assurance and network security has grown due 
to large public breaches and news stories about government sponsored cyber attacks 
there has been a focus by training organizations to produce content and programs 
designed around the skill sets needed for various positions in cyber security. Several 
organizations have really stepped up and are now providing real and valuable train-
ing that all security organizations should look into and be investing in their people to 
take some of the training. But like all training courses and programs in any industry 
you have to ensure that what they say they are going to teach in the brochure is really 
what you want your people to learn. So, before you spend around $5,000 dollars and 
lose a person for a weeklong training course you need to read through sample course 
documents to ensure you are going to get the best value for your money.
A word about certifications, although certification training just prepares you for 
the certification exam and not necessarily gives you any ability to perform a job func-
tion. It does certify that the individual has been exposed to specific information and 
has retained that information to certification standards. This is not necessarily a bad 
thing but be warned that just because someone has heard about a concept, applica-
tion, or process does not mean they can execute in that space.
I do not want to recommend one specific training company, program, or course 
over another simply due to the fact that this changes so frequently. Courses are con-
stantly being developed, improved, redesigned, and recreated. The security industry 
is moving fast as well. Something that may be a hot topic today may not be tomor-
row. Instead I would like to point you in the direction of a few organizations that have 
programs worth looking into and should be on your list of potential training options.
www.opensecuritytraining.info
There are a lot of open or free courses out there on the Internet and even univer-
sities that are out there that offer free courses. Performing a basic search for cyber 
security training or open training will yield a long list of options and opportunities. 
Specifically opensecuritytraining.info helps us in security by not only offering course 
material for free but also collecting materials that can be used as formal training. This 
training can be used by an individual to teach an entire class or can be used by the 
individual as a self-study guide. Currently there is great content on the basics of in-
formation required to reverse engineer applications specifically related to malware.
www.Sans.org
Starting off as a simple organization designed to teach topics of security by 
security practitioners, it has grown to an international training and certification 
organization that offers a wide variety of course topics and training paths for in-
dividuals and companies. Recently, Sans has opened their Sans university which 
offers accredited courses to its students. This is a great resource and a win/win 
for organizations and their employees. Not only do organizations get to send their 
people to good quality training but the employee gets to use the credits toward 
degree awarding programs.

CHAPTER 7  Training
SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES
Over the last few years, schools and universities have really caught up and have de-
veloped great programs that focus on cyber security, Information Assurance or even 
specializations such as computer forensics. Some leaders in this area include:
• 
Maryland Cybersecurity Center (http://www.cyber.umd.edu)
• 
Regis Universities Information Assurance Masters program  
(http://www.regis.edu)
• 
University of Rhode Islands digital forensics and Cyber Security Center 
(http://www.dfcsc.uri.edu/academics/)
• 
Carnegie Mellon University (http://www.cmu.edu)
• 
Norwich University (norwich.edu)
This by far is not an exhaustive list of schools and universities offering programs 
and there are more and more everyday. Many of these schools also offer online pro-
grams and degrees in areas that people who are working in a SOC can take advantage 
of. The online options also allow people working odd shifts in the SOC to take ad-
vantage of the great educational opportunities now available.
Some other commercial training and certification programs worth looking into:
CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker), CCNA/CCNP (Cisco Certified Network Asso-
ciate/Professional), CGIH (Certified GIAC Incident Handler), GCFA (GIAC Certi-
fied Forensic Analyst), GCIH (GIAC Certified Incident Handler), OSCP (Offensive 
Security Certified Professional), CISM (Certified Information Security Manager), 
CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional), and CISA (Certified 
Information System Auditor)
Other nonsecurity related but important certifications may be:
ISO27001 Lead Auditor Exam PMP (Project Manager Professional)* ITIL 
v3 foundations
Never underestimate the power of skills that can support effective process, help 
define common language, and work to blend security personnel with other profes-
sionals in the technology field.
VENDOR TRAINING
It seems like common sense but vendors that have supplied your tools are an excel-
lent source of training for your SOC. Most often vendors can bring people into your 
organization and provide focused or custom training and more often than not this 
can be FREE training. The vendors have a vested interest in your continued use and 
satisfaction with their product, so depending on what you need they may be more 
*Typically you would not think of project management as a certification or desired skill but much of 
security is about implementing the right equipment in the right places. Having project management 
skills and training helps ensure that there is structure, communication, and proven processes that can 
be applied in a project team that may have been assembled from various departments in a larger orga-
nization.

159
﻿ Internal skill set training
than happy to provide you with some real training. Additionally, vendors should be 
more than willing to come in and speak with your SOC about new and upcoming 
product enhancements, features and capabilities. Larger vendors have offices and 
resources around the United States and even around the world, so vendor training 
that you want to get for one SOC site you may be able to arrange at multiple SOC 
sites if you have them. This way you are helping to maintain constant training for all 
your SOC locations. Also, if you feel like your SOC or specific team members need 
enhanced or in-depth training, most vendors will also provide extensive or weeklong 
training courses but these typically do have a cost associated with them. Make sure 
you maintain a good working relationship with your vendors, as it will always pay 
dividends in the long run.
OJT
The positive impact that this type of training gives cannot be under estimated. OJT 
can give people one on one time with senior people who can show them step by step 
how to perform specific tasks. It is a very cost effective training tool as it is given 
by existing people in the SOC and can be almost any topic. It is also a great way to 
ensure that material is consistently taught as the materials such as tools and docu-
mentation are your own.
The process of OJT is to help build up a new person and make them proficient 
in specific tasks. This typically starts off with a senior or more experienced person 
in the SOC showing the new person how to perform a task. The observation of the 
task being performed should be discussed in detail and the new person would have 
an opportunity to ask questions during each step. As the new person becomes more 
comfortable with the task being trained they can “drive” and perform the task with 
the senior SOC member looking on and correcting any issues they see. As the new 
person performs the task better and more confidently, then they become proficient 
enough to handle that task without any additional assistance. Keep in mind that some 
tasks are easier than other and therefore will require different levels of effort on the 
part of the student and the trainer. Specific task training may take minutes, hours or 
even days and weeks before someone is really proficient. If your SOC is responsible 
for breach and IR or if your SOC is a managed operations center servicing many 
clients then there will no doubt be some very stressful situations where SOC team 
members need to be able to stay calm, ensure they are using the correct words in 
their communications, and they know who to call, what to say, and what to do. The 
best way to ensure all of this gets done right is through OJT and by running several 
training scenarios and exercises. Training through repetition along with easily acces-
sible and clear documentation is the best way to ensure that SOC staff will execute 
properly during extremely stressful times. OJT does not always have to be for new 
staff, it is also important that existing staff and even your senior or more experienced 
staff maintain their proficiency on specific tasks in your organization. This is a great 
way to ensure that highly important tasks but infrequently used skills can remain 
sharp in your operations.

160
CHAPTER 7  Training
The more tasks you can identify the more you can standardize and train people 
with the OJT process. Keep in mind that this does not take place of properly docu-
mented processes and procedures. In fact you should have all of these tasks docu-
mented and a proficiency checklist should be created that you can have the senior 
SOC member performing the OJT sign and document that the training was accom-
plished to proficiency. Training checklists and documentation are a critical compo-
nent to any training program, an example checklist is provided later in this chapter 
for your reference.
Because OJT is such an effective training tool, I want to further this discussion 
with some specific examples of how OJT could be beneficial above and beyond the 
basic SOC analyst core functions. Having the skills and technically knowing how 
to analyze security information is extremely important for an analyst in a SOC but 
being training on communication is vital to everyone’s success. Through OJT an 
analyst can be taught valuable skills on interpersonal communication as well as cus-
tomer service. It is one thing to be able to spot a security incident but it is completely 
another thing to be able to effectively communicate that issue to the right people with 
the right tone using the right words. Although you should have specific documented 
processes and procedures on when to contact people via email or who to call or who 
to assign tickets to, it is vital that the correct information be placed into those com-
munication methods to ensure the correct message is received. Interpersonal and cus-
tomer service training is vital to ensure the SOC’s message is received appropriately, 
at the right level and does not cause any undo pain and suffering to the recipient of 
an escalated event.
TRAINING PLANS
I have worked at several large security operation centers and inside these operations 
centers people are performing multiple functions and multiple jobs and one of the 
key elements of success is having a training plan suitable for your organization and 
for the positions that people are holding. Without a proper training plan it is hard 
to ensure that all of your employees in your security operation center are meeting 
expectations and are capable of doing the job that you expect. Additionally without a 
documented training plan, it is very difficult to communicate to your employees what 
the expectations are for them to advance their career and move on to higher positions 
inside your organization.
It is important to develop not only a training plan but also a checklist that help en-
sure that each person going through the training plan documents the training they are 
doing and each task gets signed off by a more senior person in the SOC. Additionally, 
when they do OJT alongside other analysts or engineers that work with them or trains 
them there is a sign-off for those tasks as well. The Military and U.S. Government 
organizations do this very well. If you want to see very detailed and robust training 
plans look at some of the U.S. Air Force Career Field Education and Training Plan 
(CFETP) documents which are mostly available on the web. These documents detail 

161
﻿ Internal skill set training
all the skills, tasks and training that are required for an individual to progress over 
a 20 year career. The one CFETP that is most related to the content of this book is 
for the Air Force career field number 1B4x1. That training plan should be located 
on www.e-publishing.af.mil or more specifically, http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/
production/1/saf_cio_a6/publication/cfetp1b4x1/cfetp1b4x1.pdf
You may not want to lay out a 20 year career for your SOC but a good expla-
nation of this in a simple organization that has a tier one, two, and three security 
analyst position structure where each had a different role or more advanced func-
tion than the other. You can build a similar document that helps people progress 
from day one of a new analyst coming on board to the organization where they 
would be handed a new hire checklist, and a training book with a training checklist 
all the way to completion of their tier 1 training. The new hire checklist would 
include certain things that are important for SOC management to keep track of, 
like issuing of their badges, issuing of a token for VPN access, and issuing of their 
network credentials. It also included checklist items for a laptop, cell phone or any 
other items they might need in order to do their job. All of these items also had a 
name or department associated with them so the new employee knew a direction or 
someone they needed to speak to in order to get the items. After each item was is-
sued the respective department or responsible person would check off and sign that 
the items was indeed issued. In addition to this list, the training checklist detailed 
all the various elements of a documented training plan and materials that they need 
to go through and one by one get signed off on. The analysts would go through an 
on the job-training program augmented by technical reading and computer based 
training where possible.
New hire SOC documentation is always an important document to generate 
and give to employees. This is in addition to the documentation your Human 
Resources department may distribute, because a SOC can play by different rules 
and have very different procedures than what you would find in the rest of an 
organization.
An Administrative SOC book can be created and issued to include items like:
SOC SHIFT OPERATIONS
Shift responsibilities may seem like common sense type items that you should not 
have to tell a reasonable adult about and if you have ever worked in an operation 
center or have done any kind of shift work these type of things will be fairly com-
mon but in a SOC or any other type of operation center you have to ensure that 
everyone is operating with the same set of rules. For example, when arriving to 
work all analysts must be ready to begin work at the start of their shift (i.e., login 
to their computers, access the phone queue, and read up on all their email). Then 
all analysts would be required to ask the previous shift for updates about any re-
curring issues (these issues should also be documented on a SOC SharePoint site, 
or portal system.) Departing at the end of the shift is also something that should 

162
CHAPTER 7  Training
be documented; your expectations for the analysts to close out their work and any 
preparation items you need for them to complete for the next shift should be docu-
mented. For example, maintenance tasks, systems updates, that is, change manage-
ment items. A lot of these items were reviewed in the daily operations chapter but 
keep in mind that simple training documentation becomes reference information 
for people to use later. Train people on these basic operational items now and save 
many problems in the future. One essential rule you may need to communicate and 
train people on is if you require all tickets to either be closed or passed on to the 
next shift. This helps in ensuring that tickets do not get orphaned and remain open 
in the system forever.
General responsibilities are items you need to train people so that there is com-
mon set of practices on how you want everyone to act and interact with each other 
and with your customers. For example, you may want to train people on the precise 
procedure of securely dispose of any paper that has customer names, IP addresses, 
IDS or firewall rules or any other sensitive information. It is also important for new 
staff to review internal documents, such as policies and procedures, case studies, 
or past incidents that have been documented by the team or information in past 
tickets.
LEADERS
It is also very important to know who is in charge in the SOC and to make sure that 
there is someone in charge at any given time so you may need some training on 
what it means to be in charge. You may want to designate the most senior analyst 
to be acting as the team/shift lead if no actual lead or manager is around. In this 
case that senior person will assume the duties and responsibilities of the team lead 
and therefore will be granted the same respect from the SOC staff as they perform 
leadership duties.
Train your staff to take charge. Give them the right process to perform IR, or give 
them a calling tree so that when something goes wrong they have the right phone 
numbers for the right people they can call. Train them to reach out properly to cus-
tomers or internal departments, and as discussed previously, ensure they understand 
how to appropriately communicate. If you are running multiple shifts, you may need 
aids to help communicate issues across different shift, do this you may need a shift 
log, well then you need to train your people on how to complete a proper shift Log 
report at the end of every shift.
Leaders in your SOC need to know how to monitor the workflow, ensuring that 
tickets and appropriate email accounts are worked on in conformance with any of the 
SLA or internal SLO you have signed up to support. Also, leaders need to be trained 
to review representative sample of tickets for accuracy and content and produce 
reports on procedure discrepancies, anomalies, or good samples. They also need to  
know how to review tickets to ensure that your SLAs are being met. If they are not 
being met, what type of course corrections can they take to get back on track. A 
leader in a SOC may have to make constant changes to get the right tickets moving in 

163
﻿ Internal skill set training
order to keep up with the SLAs. Teaching them how to do this is critical in ensuring 
you are successfully meeting your obligations. Your leaders are responsible to take 
escalations from the SOC floor and do something with them. They need to be able 
to either technically handle all escalations or know who to reach out to. In many 
organizations, this information is never written down. Do not be like that: train your 
staff to handle issues appropriately, effectively, and efficiently. Ensure you document 
everything for training purposes as well.
CUSTOMER NOTIFICATIONS
We discussed this before, but it is worth mentioning in more detail. It is very 
important to train your SOC how to properly communicate. The SOC is dealing 
with what could be very critical information and incident details. If you do not 
train your SOC to handle this information accordingly then nobody else will. 
What this means is that sometimes security professionals can become complacent 
with incidents as we may see them all the time. It is not always up to the SOC 
to decide how to react or respond to an incident, which may be up to some other 
department or a Computer Emergence Response Team (CERT). Regardless how 
your organization handles an incident you need to respond appropriately and that 
usually entails a notification to an internal or external customer. If all you do is 
call someone but do not leave a message, was the information important? Your 
SOC needs to be trained on who to call and the proper frequency and escalation of 
those calls. This may be different based on the customer, type of incident, severity 
of the incident, or even the time of day. These notification details may change as 
people leave the company, go on vacation or move positions within a company. 
Not only do you need to train your SOC on these notification procedures but you 
also need to keep your documentation up to date so that your analysis will always 
call the correct point of contacts. Lastly, when communicating with customers a 
SOC needs to be trained in customer service, they need to know what to say and 
how to say it. Often you may hear the story about someone getting a security alert 
for something and then immediately shutting down a company’s critical server, 
which in turn shuts the company down. The analysts need to be trained to be calm, 
to help customers understand the criticality of a situation but without rising any 
unneeded alarms or panic. They also need to understand that their customer may 
not be an IT person; therefore, they need to be able to communicate in ways so 
the customer understands what just occurred and how it needs to be handled and/
or resolved.
SOC PHONES
It is kind of weird that culturally we are such technically minded people but I cannot 
believe how many times I see several very smart IT people struggle to get a video 
projector to work. There are just some technologies that happen to evade our ability

CHAPTER 7  Training
to command that will always frustrate us the most. The phone and connected phone 
systems you may typically see in a SOC environment may be quite complex and may 
be worth some training.
Many operations centers use ACD systems. These systems allow an incoming 
call to be routed to an appropriate analyst in the SOC who is available and ready 
to take the call. This requires an analyst to log into the phone queue using a unique 
code or agent identification number. This allows the tracking of calls, call times, 
call frequency, and so on. This is definitely a great tool for getting metrics. It is also 
something you want to think about when reading the SOC metrics chapter. Due to 
some of the complexities of these systems it is important that you train your SOC on 
its proper use. For example, when you step away from your desk usually there will 
be an away button that needs to be pressed, this helps pull you out of the call queue 
so that someone calling in does not waste time ringing your phone. Also, to ensure 
basic customer service and as to not upset anyone calling into the SOC, everyone 
should be trained on basic call set up like, transferring calls, creating a conference 
call or answering voicemail.
Here is a quick list of items you may want to have in a communications document 
that you want to train people on.
• 
Inbound call handling procedures
• 
What you say when you pick up the phone
• 
Caller authentication (optional depending on your organization)
• 
Incident notification procedures
• 
Outbound call handling
–	 What to say during an incident escalation
• 
Email handling
–	 What to write
• 
Group email handling
• 
If you SOC shares a single group email box, how do you handle ensuring all 
emails are acknowledged and handled, what do you do with the email once it 
is been addressed
It is not just about communications, it is also important for an analyst to know 
about the organizations they work for. It is the core reason you are there; therefore, 
you need to train your SOC on who you are, what your mission is, and who your 
customers are. If you have external stakeholders or customers then your SOC needs 
to know who they are and what specifics are important about them. It is not enough 
for you to just give your SOC a phone number to call your customers, you need to 
train them in the right way to deal with those customers regardless if they are internal 
or external to your organization. They need to know that if they call Bob between the 
hours of 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. they better have a damn good reason or they will make a 
very powerful and influential customer very upset, but calling him any other time for 
even a minor issue is required. Customers have specific expectations and your SOC

needs to do its best to meet those needs, spending time training your staff on how to 
deal with them will pay huge dividends.

During initial OJT, the new analysis should sit with various analysts. The more 
experienced analysts or engineers should work through the training manual with the 
new person. They should be taught all the various sections and then they would 
have to demonstrate proficiency in that section before they could get that section 
signed off. This always seems to be the most effective way because in busy SOC 
environments there are no guarantees that a single senior analyst would be able to be 
dedicated to train new employees. With the checklist and training documentation, a 
new analyst can bounce around from person to person getting the required training 
without having to explain where they are, what they have done and what they feel 
they need to know. Everything gets documented and signed off before it is reviewed 
by management. Once the training plan is completely signed off then that was the in-
dication the new employee could begin to work on his or her own. Ensure they retain 
all their training materials to be used as a guide and reference.
The signoff sheet should be filed away in a personnel folder where you could 
track any annual refresher training, certifications they may get or other various items 
you wanted to track for either your own use or for compliance needs.

﻿ Internal skill set training
PROGRESSION AND VISIBILITY
If after, let us say six months, a new tier one analyst may be looking for a promo-
tion to a tier 2 analysts. If they are doing a good job, you can give them the training 
documentation and materials to learn and study for what is required for a tier two 
analyst. (I am not saying 6 months is the right amount of time to start progressing 
your people, which is something that you have to decide on your own in your own 
SOC based on the person, on your needs and the needs of your organization.) Every 
organization is different and progression will happen in different ways at different 
times for different people working in different organizations. You figure out what 
the right balance is best for you. It is not uncommon to see organizations that will 
not even begin to think about advancing someone to the next level for 2 years. Again 
your organization might be different and 2 years might be too long and in other orga-
nizations that might not be long enough, 2 years, 6 months, whatever works for you 
is the best thing.
Of course this does not mean that your analysts cannot work to train themselves 
to get better and advance themselves. When it comes time for them to step up, they 
are already prepared. I would highly encourage you to allow your analysts to prog-
ress and learn as much as they possibly can whenever you can. Never prevent them 
from growing. Growing is a vital and important part of your organization, the more 
they learn the better they are going to be and the better security they can provide for 
your organization. You need to embrace training and you need to embrace the people 
who are willing to go out on their own and learn. There is nothing more valuable than 
an employee that goes out on their own and brings knowledge into the organization. 
It helps rejuvenate the organization, and helps advance the entire organization’s body 
of knowledge.
In the best SOC I have ever worked, training was a daily occurrence. An environ-
ment where you come to work every single day with the objective to either learn one 
new thing or impart some knowledge on someone else is truly a magical place to 
work. In these lucky environments, people feed off of each other and learned collec-
tively. People would come in to work and talk about new vulnerabilities, mitigation 
strategies, news stories or experiences they had with some tool or program. Sharing 
is caring, and in an organization that values open sharing of information, skills and 
knowledge will become a world-class operation.
Some organizations worry that they train their employees at a high cost. They 
even invest in getting them professional certifications but then their employees be-
come more valuable and eventually leave the organization. The concerns is that the 
organization invested lots of money training people when all they are going to do is 
leave once they are trained for bigger and better jobs. Although this is true, you are 
making your employees more valuable but you also need to value them more as well. 
The more time and dedication you provide to your employees, the more time and 
dedication they will have in return. Making your organization a place where people 
want to work, enjoy working and a place people feel they get benefit from is a great 
way to retain your people and ensure they will not leave as soon as they are trained. 

168
CHAPTER 7  Training
I assure you that if you put no value into training and advancing your staff they will 
leave you anyway and go work for company that does value them and does want to 
advance them personally and professionally.
Some ways to help retain your people once they are trained is to not just promote 
them but promote their knowledge. Make sure you have open forums with your SOC 
to discuss operational challenges. As people progress in you SOC environment they 
will absolutely find ways to improve processes, documentation or technical controls. 
By listening and implementing these improvements, you not only build a better SOC 
but you also give your people a sense of accomplishment and pride in what they are 
doing in their job. This is a great way to retain people, they want to part of the solu-
tion and if you do not give them a way then they will just go away. You may even 
want to try and build a continuous improvement program. This program may require 
annual documentation reviews, tool configuration audits or whatever you need. The 
bottom line is do not just audit your SOC, have your SOC perform audits on them-
selves, have them be part of the solution, and get them working together as a team 
that can better themselves. It will help keep them current on training, documentation, 
and ensure integration of new information back into your tools.
Employees, especially new ones can easily be overwhelmed with the sheer vol-
ume of information, policies, and procedures that you may have in your company but 
especially in your SOC. You should be careful and take precaution on exposing staff 
to tasks where they might not be fully trained especially when there is a possibility of 
inadvertently disclosing sensitive information. By focusing efforts on training, you 
not only invest in your employees by helping them learn their profession but you also 
help prevent costly mistakes.
TRAINING EXERCISES
Learning out of a book or classroom or even in the SOC working along side other 
more seasoned people may not ever be enough to prepare someone for that big event. 
It is not just that large breach you need to be worried about it is also the smaller suc-
cessful attacks or the activities of real advanced persistent threats that you need to 
worry about. These are hopefully not things you see every day, so in order to be best 
prepared for those types of events are to exercise your SOC. Applying your knowl-
edge in scenario-based training such as an exercise is a great way to not only stress 
test your staff but give them ultimate on the job training and the ability to test out 
their skill sets without having to worry about a real negative impact to a customer or 
the organization.
To perform a simple training exercise you can have internal members of your 
team try to stage an attack by tripping signatures on sensors or generate logs that 
should create an event into your SOC. This is a good way to ensure that your SOC 
is paying attention and that they handle the event appropriately if they even see the 
event in the first place. This simple exercise ensures tools, processes and procedures 
are working the way they are supposed to and that people know how to access them 
and use them all to be successful. After the event is over and the SOC has completed 

169
﻿ Internal skill set training
its process everyone should get together and discuss what happened, what went 
wrong, and how to improve it for the future. This is a very effective way to test your 
SOC and make sure everything is working as expected. Do not get this type of ex-
ercise mixed up with other types of testing. This is not a penetration test. It is not a 
vulnerability test of the network. This is purely a controlled test to ensure the SOC is 
operating properly and to train staff on proper operations.
For a more advanced test, you can setup something like a network war game 
where with a controlled set of rules you can have a team be “red players” that are go-
ing to safely attack the network. Then you will have “blue players” that are protecting 
the network. A lot of companies, as well as governments, use this type of exercise 
to not only find weaknesses in network infrastructure or other security vulnerabili-
ties but also to help train security and information technology personnel and their 
management. To start with, I would not recommend you hire an external company 
to bring in penetration testers to beat up your network. Instead, bring your manage-
ment and security experts to a room with a whiteboard and do a series of tabletop 
exercises. In this format, you can have lively discussion on different attack or defend 
scenarios. You may find that just through exercises like this you will find issues with 
your SOC processes or even weaknesses in your organizations network that the SOC 
is not prepared to defend against. In these cases you can bring your results to the 
attention of the appropriate management to have them look into it for further resolu-
tion. This whiteboard approach is great for organizations that have never done any 
real exercises before and gives you great opportunities to learn and talk about risks, 
weaknesses or items to improve upon. If you involve business leaders in the exercise 
they can also help you with your hypothetical discussion as to what impact specific 
events would have on the operation of the company. It is good to do these types of 
exercises at a technical level but do not be afraid to expand upon it and get your busi-
ness, finance, legal department, HR, or even customers involved in the discussion.
Once you are ready and you feel that you have worked out all the kinks and issues 
you can from your whiteboard discussion you can then start to think about taking 
it to the next step. This is where you do have people actually perform live attacks 
on the network, these could be either internal resources or you can hire an external 
company to come do this for you. The red team in this case would actually attack 
either the entire network or just specific parts while the blue team detects, responds, 
and defends the network.
I will strongly caution you that you need to make sure you bring a wide audience 
into the planning part of this type of exercise. One of the first things you should de-
cide on is what you want to test. The SOC is obviously going to be tested but what 
part of the network do you want to test is what you need to decide. You need to figure 
out if it is the organization’s externally facing systems and DMZ or internal database 
system that you want to test. Either way, you do not want to put any real production 
equipment in jeopardy by performing any unsafe vulnerability exploits. It is always 
best, but not always possible to launch real live attacks against test or development 
systems. Do what you can to make the exercise as real as possible but without caus-
ing any real impact to the organization. In some cases, controlled red team activity 

170
CHAPTER 7  Training
can be performed on production systems as long as the testes and attacks have been 
previously validated to not cause and production performance issues. A test can even 
be as simple as placing a desktop computer on a server network and see if detec-
tion tools or your SOC is able to see that change. Another simple test may be the 
performing of a simple vulnerability scan that does not change, alter or damage the 
network in any way but would look like a potential attack to the security operation 
center. Keep in mind that depending on what your organization does there may be 
systems you never want to subject to live attacks even if performed by skilled and 
trustworthy people. These may be isolated systems running critical infrastructure or 
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems that manage power, gas 
or other dangerous systems. In these cases, it is not that you do not want to discover 
vulnerabilities or security issues, you just do not want to find those issues on produc-
tion systems actually performing critical functions.
When you feel confident in your SOC’s abilities to detect, protect, and defend the 
network appropriately and you have a consistent set of policies and procedures that 
your SOC is following then you may want to consider bringing in an external team to 
perform red team functions. By bringing in an external company, you can really be-
gin to test the effectiveness of all of your security equipment and your SOC by allow-
ing the extra company to utilize known emerging threats, new threats, or even threats 
your security team has not seen before. This is a great way to help improve your secu-
rity operations and start to introduce security skill sets and intelligence from outside 
sources to better your infrastructure, better your security operations performance and 
increase your overall protections for the organization. Some government regulations 
or industry regulations such as PCI may require your organization have a vulnerabil-
ity scan performed by an authorized scanning vendor. The vulnerability results would 
be reviewed by your organization and ultimately be part of your regulatory compli-
ance documentation. It is great to be able to utilize these required vulnerability scans 
to test the effectiveness of your security operation center. Essentially you are able to 
kill two birds with one stone, comply with your regulatory requirements for also us-
ing the same money to test yourself. Most external security scanning vendors will be 
more than happy to work with you to create this type of training environments while 
providing necessary documentation for compliance. In some cases, your regulatory 
compliance activities may dictate that a test of your SOC or IR is performed on a 
regular basis, by integrating all these activities, you are reducing the workload burden 
on all of your participating organizations while reducing costs.
This type of exercises can be a huge learning environment for everyone involved. 
Not only will it help your SOC learn and improve processes but it will also help them 
learn about your company or the network they are charged in protecting. Further, you 
can even find competitions that mimic the same kind of exercises. These are typically 
called cyber capture the flag exercises and competitions. They are run on networks 
built just for this type of activity and some have very well defined and mature rules 
and scoring systems for participating teams to follow. These events are usually run by 
universities or sponsored by vendors and you can also find one at the Defcon (www.
defcon.org) conference in Las Vegas every year.

171
﻿ Internal skill set training
This does not always have to be training for the SOC personnel participating on 
the red or blue team but this can also be training for the company and its users. In 
today’s modern threats, the weakest links are typically the non-IT users. By perform-
ing red team tactics on your users, you can effectively help train them on how not to 
click on suspicious links, open email attachments from people they do not know or 
give out their passwords to anyone who asks. Your red team can be the ones to send 
out phishing email to employees and provide immediate positive feedback or training 
opportunities to the people that perform specific actions.
There are many different options and scenarios you can play out with exercises 
and it can be free or as expensive and elaborate as you want it to be. But in the end 
the training everyone can gain from this type of event can be invaluable to everyone 
involved.
SUMMARY
In looking at all the different training options, scenarios, and programs that are avail-
able out there, there is really no reason an organization could not provide ongoing 
and continuing education to its SOC while maintaining consistent training across 
shifts or sites. The extent of free training and online resources these days is nothing 
short of massive. All it takes is for one person in your organization to seek out the 
effective resources you need and assemble it into a cohesive program that can be 
tracked and monitored. Although there is plenty of free training, you should set aside 
a training budget and get enough funds yearly to expand the proficiency of your SOC 
in technical areas and new disciplines or even legal aspects of security. Funds can 
also be spent on bringing training in-house for everyone or rewarding individuals 
that stand out by sending them to popular conferences. You should also have a library 
setup where people can access either physically or digitally books, magazines, and 
other technical references that will not only help encourage learning and expanding 
of knowledge but also help in keeping people up to date with emerging trends in the 
security space.
Ask someone in the SOC to build a 1-h training presentation. It does not need 
to be a seasoned professional; it could even be someone new who is seeing things 
through a fresh pair of eyes. Then when he is ready to teach the lesson, buy the SOC 
lunch, it will get everyone there and help them pay attention.
As I mentioned before, do not boil the ocean. There are many different ways to 
train your SOC. Be creative, be focused, and make sure you carve out the time for 
training as it will only benefit the entire organization in the long run.

Information is the key to success in anything that you do and knowing that you are on 
the right track and you are being successful is a great feeling. Without metrics we are 
just guessing that we are doing the right thing. We need numbers in our jobs to track 
what we are doing, to show we are being successful, or that we are failing for some 
defined reason that can be shown through metrics. In security and especially in secu-
rity operations, we collect a lot of data, a huge amount of data and for some people 
too much data. But, data are an invaluable raw material that must be harvested. Once 
you have data, you can turn it into information. The information tells you something, 
it has structure and tells you a story, and allows you to organize into meaningful 
metrics. You need to analyze metrics, it causes you to think and evaluate. In order to 
understand what the metrics tell you, you need to question it. The analysis of those 
metrics gives you what you need so that you can act. Metrics are a product of that 
process where you take data, turn it into information, and analyze that information 
in order to take action.

Metrics for the sake of metrics does nobody any good. I have spent a great deal 
of time creating metrics out of ticketing systems, security devices, end point devices 
and a combination of devices, you name it. I have created some of the most visually 
appealing, interactive charts, images, and dashboards that you have ever seen and 
that nobody will absolutely ever use because the data are completely worthless to

CHAPTER 8  Metrics
anyone. You can get lost in metrics for years and make some of the most complicated 
and complex data sets that even you will not be able to figure out what you did a week 
later. Once I sat down to make some metrics and focused on nothing else for a week 
to generate some useful data. At the end of the week I had just over 100 different data 
sets and metrics. All individual reports, charts, graphs, and spreadsheets that were 
easy to update and were all interlinked to each other. I presented my weeks’ worth of 
hard work to my leadership team and I got looks like I had three heads. They all had 
the same question, what do you want us to do with all this?
I realized one critical value that I was missing from all my cool wizardry, the 
user! I did not think about the practical application of any of the metrics I had cre-
ated. Instead I just created some very powerful and visually appealing junk. This 
does not mean that the data were bad but once I put the reports into context of who 
could use it and why then the reports took on a life of their own and became one of 
the most powerful tools an operation center could ever utilize.
In the next few sections I am going to discuss metrics as it relates to various 
people and positions. The idea is not to give you a prescriptive metrics list of who 
needs what, but instead to help you put valuable data sets in focus of the user who 
needs it most. It is very important that you have accurate representation of metrics 
in a SOC. You may not have all of these positions in your SOC or you may call them 
something different or may even combine some of these into one, it does not matter 
how you break it up or combine them. Take the concepts and apply it appropriately 
to your situation as you desire.
What are the types of metrics to use and how you use them are almost as im-
portant as the information they represent. Simple visualizations may include a table 
showing the metric result for the organization whereas graphical visualizations where 
the metric result is plotted on the graph. Additionally you can use complex visualiza-
tions for displaying the metric result for cross-sections by organization or ticket type, 
incident classification, or incident priority. Additionally your metrics may indicate 
threats to high valued assets (targets) in your organization. This could include assets 
that contain valuable data but are vulnerable due to missing patches or updates. Later 
in the chapter we will talk about using metrics to prioritize assets in order to gain a 
clear vision of how critical an incident is to your organization, which will ultimately 
help you communicate the criticality of an event to your senior leadership or it may 
help you highlight the fact that there are a large number of assets that are largely 
un-managed or owned in your organization which could quickly become targets for 
attackers.
HEADS UP DISPLAY
If you have ever seen an operation center, the first thing you may notice are the large 
monitors, projectors, or video walls of what seems like really cool graphics, moving 
charts, TV channels, and so on. It is the one major impressive thing that an operation 
center has for eye candy. All too often I have been in an operation center and have seen 

175
﻿ Supervisor metrics
tons of money spent on these large walls of impressive multimedia but when the work 
begins nobody really uses it. Nobody looks up at them and the screens just blink away 
silently. Seems like such a waste of money and energy powering all that eye candy.
It is such a shame when that happens because these massive video walls can be 
an operation centers must valuable asset. Take a good look at what you display on 
your wall, if something is not useful in keeping analysts informed or updated about 
important events then get rid of it. These large video walls are large for a reason, 
they are needed to help convey important information and there is what seems like 
never enough real estate to display it all. If you do not believe this is true, turn all 
your monitors off for a day, does your operation still run? Did things still go as they 
should? If so, you may need to rethink what you are displaying and evaluate the met-
rics that you cannot live without.
SUPERVISOR METRICS
Let us take a look the purpose of your supervisor or shift lead you may have at your 
SOC. They may be there to ensure people show up on time, take escalations from 
more junior analysts or help to resolve unforeseen problems, customer issues, or be-
gin the incident response and communication process. Additionally supervisors may 
be ultimately responsible to ensure that organizational service level agreements are 
consistently met. Metrics for this position is your first line of defense to combat any 
issues and to keep everyone focused. It is important to give them real-time metrics so 
that they can make on the spot course corrections as needed.
If you have priority ticket types or priority customers how do you know that those 
tickets are actually being worked in a priority manor or are given the special attention 
they deserve. One key metric would be a simple visual or heads up display that would 
alert the supervisor to the presence of a ticket or issues that meets those criteria. Your 
ticketing system may be able to do this for you or maybe you can develop a way to 
make this a visual or noticeable item that would attract some attention on a video 
wall or projector screen. Once a supervisor sees that something like this exists they 
can then evaluate what work is being performed currently in the SOC and assign the 
priority event to the next best analyst to work on or even handle it themselves.
A supervisor needs to be aware of all the work that is going on during a shift, 
knowing who is working on what and for how long is critical to keeping things mov-
ing. Sometimes analysts can get hung up on a specific problem or issue and dive into 
it for extensive periods of time. When dealing with technical issues it is hard to ask 
for help, technical people typically want to be the problem solver, there is an ego and 
pride to it all. At the same time, there is a business to run or company to protect and 
other issues to solve. A supervisor needs to know what analysts are working on and 
how long they have been working it. In a small operation, this is easy because you 
can verbally check-in with people on a regular basis, there is conversation going on 
and everyone may be in-tune. In larger organizations, a more technical approach is 
needed and a metric should be developed to track this.

176
CHAPTER 8  Metrics
Time-based service level agreements or objectives are also a metric that is vi-
tally important to a supervisor. Knowing how many tickets are in a queue that are 
untouched or unresolved or how far an operation is getting behind on issues will 
allow supervisors to evaluate the work and see where they can apply additional 
resources or maybe even the supervisor can jump in to help out the queue for a 
bit to elevate a backlog. Sometimes analysts working tickets will not always take 
tickets in priority order, instead they may be more selective and only take tickets 
for issues they feel more confident in handling sometimes called “Cherry Picking”. 
This is not necessarily a problem but a supervisor needs to be able spot when this 
becomes an issue because select tickets may be in the queue for too long, they can 
then direct people to take specific tickets to keep things moving. A simple metric  
showing analysts the top 10 oldest tickets in the queue may help motivate them to 
resolve those issues first, or they may just get sick of seeing them and want to close 
them out the best they can. No matter how you make these metrics work they are a 
key component to allowing your supervisors to make course corrections to help the 
entire operation stay on track and meet obligations. Supervisors also need to know 
how the people on their shift are doing, what their skill levels are and be able to 
rate the quality of work people are doing. This is because we want to provide the 
best possible service to our organization and the supervisor needs to know where 
problem areas are.
To evaluate analysts, one type of metric that can be useful is a ticket type met-
ric. This is where you look at the types of tickets being worked by each of the 
analysts on shift. For example, if you notice that a specific analyst is working 
mostly IDS generated tickets but not working any virus issues then there may be a 
problem here. This may indicate that the analyst does not feel strongly enough in 
the skills that it takes to properly analyze and investigate those types of tickets. A 
supervisor needs to evaluate his staff to ensure everyone has the right training to 
be able to appropriately respond to potential incidents. A metric like this could be 
a good indication of a problem where someone needs additional focus, training, or 
mentorship.
Time based metrics can also be very valuable for a supervisor but are also very 
hard to create. Your ticketing systems need to have a time tracking function build in 
and then you can begin to track all kinds of interesting things. For example, imagine 
a report that tells you the average time a new ticket has to wait before being taken out 
of the queue and worked on by an analyst.
So for your supervisors as well as the managers it would be important to know the 
number of tickets per analyst that has been opened as well as closed. This will help 
you understand the number of tickets that your operation is actually dealing with on 
a regular basis. By looking at the same information by day as well as by week and 
month will also help you in understanding what your maximum load may be as well. 
You should also look at the number of individual closed versus open instead of a total 
SOC average. I would not use this metric to see how Bob is doing compared with 
Charlie but instead see who is doing what and like what was discussed previously 
who may need training.

177
﻿ Supervisor metrics
Average time from ticket creation to ticket closure is a another nice ticket based 
metric, depending on how detailed you can get you will be able to find out not only 
how long it takes each ticket or ticket type to be worked to completion but you will 
also be able to spot problem areas that can be addressed to help you close tickets 
faster. You may even find that you need to work on your communication skills or 
relationships outside the SOC as the longest time to resolve tickets may be getting 
action or information from other departments.
Average time worked on the ticket is always good to try and figure out. Un-
fortunately time is not always an exact value to measure. Depending on how you 
implement the time tracking your results will vary. If you ask analysts to enter time 
values for each work log entry into the ticketing system, you may find that they are 
not very accurate as sometimes when people get heavily involved in technical issues, 
time escapes them and 3 h may seem like 30 min. When a ticketing system tracks 
time the system can only do so much. If an analyst opens a work log entry and the 
system starts to track time based on the fact the log is open you might think that is a 
nice automation until the analyst goes to lunch and forgets the clock is ticking in the 
ticket. Another issue regarding this is when an analyst does the majority of the work 
outside the ticketing system and then just copy and pastes their work into the ticket. 
Then 45 min of work could look like 4 or 5 s of logged work. Sometimes to most 
basic of time based measurements are the best like total average time/days open or 
a weekly metric to show how many tickets are open, closed, or currently open but 
neither closed or opened that week.
Ticket type is another interesting ticket based metric that can be interesting and 
fun to look at. I typically design my tickets systems to have tickets be categorized 
based on the US-CERT incident categories as we detailed in Chapter 3.

178
CHAPTER 8  Metrics
Once you have all your ticket categorized properly you can start to track what 
tickets are being opened for and really get a sense of what your SOC is doing.
Number of tickets by division, location, or industry is also helpful so that you can 
easily identify where problem areas may be.
For the supervisor here is an idea, how about one of the simplest yet effective 
metrics you could ever display on a video wall. A single value that shows the num-
ber of tickets in a queue. Simple, right? But effective! People want to get the queue 
cleaned and if supervisors push the priority to get it cleaned out then people will 
always glance at this number to see how they are doing or where they are or how 
they are doing.
Got a problem with missing SLAs on tickets? How about a simple metric that 
shows how many ticket SLAs have been missed. Of course these are all metrics about 

179
﻿ Supervisor metrics
tickets but there are plenty of other metrics that are important like if your network is 
up, are your devices up, web sites alive, and so on.
In one SOC, we had a 15-min service level agreement to acknowledge all new 
tickets. Using the time based functions of the ticketing system we were able to proj-
ect on our video screen ticket numbers that were in jeopardy of missing the SLA be-
cause nobody has touched them. This quickly became known as the jeopardy queue 
and when things were busy, this is where everyone would go to get their next ticket 
to work on. You can even take the approach of changing the visualization of a ticket 
based on time. For example, if your ticketing system displays tickets with a ticket 
number and short description and date/time created then you should be able to dis-
play the oldest ticket first at the top of the list. To go a step further, taking the 15-min 
example, if all your tickets are displayed in black text maybe you can get your ticket-
ing system to display all new tickets 5 min old as red text to visually separate them 
from the rest of the tickets, then you may even be able to get tickets 10 min old to not 
only be red but blink. These are good examples of how to get your SOC to take notice 
of priority work through visual metrics.
Time based metrics can also help you maximize your staffing efforts and make 
you more efficient. By looking at how many tickets are in the queue when you most 
frequently miss your SLAs for new tickets can help you determine the backlog levels. 
After you obtain your backlog levels, you can then map that against the time of day 
and the number of analysts you have on shift. Depending on the frequency of missed 
SLAs and the volume of tickets you may discover that you have too many people on 
one shift and not enough on another and therefore need to make some shift staffing 
changes. Depending on your SOC and the volume this metric may just tell you that 
you are getting overwhelmed. Your next step would be to look at the ticket types and 
how long it takes each of them to get resolved. If you find that there are always the 
same ticket types that take the longest maybe you can look into the processes and 
procedure the analysts are performing to see if there are any efficiencies that can be 
gained to improve the time it takes to resolve the tickets. In some cases, this time to 
close metric can mean two different things. First you can look at the overall time it 
takes from when a ticket is open to when it is completely closed. The other way to 
look at it is how much time was actually spent working on the issue the ticket was 
opened for. In other words, a ticket may be open for 5 days but only 10 min of actual 
work was performed to close it out. The two metrics mean very different things and 
actions you would take to reduce the time of each are very different. Continuing to 
make efficiency changes in your processes or apply automation will help you resolve 
tickets faster but it will also help your increase your ticket to analyst ratio. You need 
to maximize the number of quality tickets your SOC analysts work on and resolve, 
that is a lot to say in one simple sentence. What is a quality ticket how do you find out 
the analyst to ticket ration and how do you know when you are maximized. All good 
questions can be answered by looking at very simple metrics.
The total number of resolved tickets divided by the total number of analysts obvi-
ously would show you the average number of tickets an individual analyst resolves. 
For many reason this is not a fair average. For example, one analyst may be very 

180
CHAPTER 8  Metrics
fast at investigating and resolving tickets where another is slower but maybe more 
methodical. Another reason this metric can get thrown off is if there are a few par-
ticularly hard tickets to resolve that take long amounts of time and work. In order to 
help offset these issues are to look at types of tickets resolved divided by the total 
number of analysts. This way you can dissect the information in a bit more granular 
way and address specific issues with ticket types. You may find that virus events take 
longer to resolve but there are more virus tickets the second week of the month com-
pared with any other week, whereas IDS generated tickets occur more frequently on 
Wednesdays but are relatively quick to resolve. Further investigation of these occur-
rence may help you realize that Wednesdays are the day the IT department typically 
patches systems which set off the IDS systems and generate a ton of false positive 
events. Similarly you may find that the second week of the month is more frequent 
for antivirus events because that is when patches are typically announced and when 
zero-day exploits are attempted more frequently.
If your SOC is receiving 5000 or whatever number of tickets per week or per 
month, take a regular look at those tickets. See what they are and how the staff is 
handling them, are they resolved, are they remaining open for long periods of time, 
ask some hard questions about the tickets and the associated events. This may sound 
silly but ask why the tickets are open in the first place.
Let us say that IDS devices generate a majority of your tickets. Which is not un-
common, many companies like to constantly keep their IDS devices up to date with 
the latest and greatest signatures treating them like some kind of antivirus update. So 
they just add signatures as they come from the vendor and take little regard for what 
the impact or need is to the organization. Take a good look at the top three events 
that open tickets. There are a lot of questions that need to be asked about these three 
events. One easy question could be regarding the percentages of false positives each 
of the three events are generating. If your staff is spending an average of 5 min per 
event investigating and working an IDS ticket and there are a total of 600 of these 
three events combined per week then you are spending 50 h of your staff’s time on 
these, is that worth it?
Efficiencies can be gained by performing regular reviews of work being per-
formed and ask the basic questions such as do we need to be doing this? Is there a 
better way?
Depending on how your SOC is setup, you may want to set a threshold of a false 
positive rate on IDS signatures if you can quickly determine that more than 90% of a 
single signature generating tickets is false positive then take it out of rotation and let 
someone evaluate it. Can you make the signature better and less false positive? Is it 
something that the organization can live without? Maybe the signature does not need 
to be on all devices and only on some that it matters more to. After asking the right 
questions and reviewing the information take these signatures out of production if 
you can, let your engineer fine tune them to reduce the false positives or even evaluate 
whether or not the IDS event is even worthwhile to the organization it is protecting.
Imagine the engineer who on a Friday evening and has been working on a new 
IDS signature all day. In his rush to get out the door, he installs the signature on 30 

181
﻿ Vulnerabilities
production devices and leaves for the weekend. The signature is not too bad but 
maybe not fully tested and it starts to fire once every other hour, so each hour 15 
tickets are generated from the 30 devices. In a small SOC with only one or 2 weekend 
analysts, this may be obvious but in a larger organization with 10+ analysts it may 
not be noticed because everyone is grabbing tickets and doing their work. At the end 
of the weekend, 24 h later using the same 5 min per ticket average you would have 
wasted 30 h of your analysts time working a bad signature. 15 × 24 = 360 tickets at 
5 min each
There are many built in tools from the vendor to help with this problem but it is 
not always possible to get it right. A good solid process to evaluate, test and install 
new things that trigger tickets for analysts to work on will pay huge dividends in the 
long run. One way that I like to measure my engineering staff is by false positive rate. 
Since the engineering staff can have a dramatic positive or negative effect on SOC 
analysts performance I will typically make a line item in every engineer’s yearly re-
view regarding false positive rates. Installing a bad IDS signature can open thousands 
of tickets in an automated system and waste a huge amount of time cleaning up un-
less you have an automated way to do the clean up. There should be a fair amount of 
testing before putting anything new into the SOC for analysts to react to. A simple 
metric to use would be percentage of overall tickets closed by the SOC analysts as 
false positive. This also has another advantage, in several organizations I have been 
at there is a divide between the annalists and the engineers, this metric gives the SOC 
back some power and creates a feedback look to measure how well the engineers are 
doing their job. Do not wait until the end of the year to pull this metric, evaluate every 
week and see where the problems are, make quick course corrections, and that ensure 
your annalists are able to focus on the tickets that matter the most.
Getting into more specific security metrics you may want to calculate the number 
of detected security events the SOC has experienced during a specific time period 
such as a shift, a day, a week, a quarter, and so on. This metric can further be split by 
business division or customer type or even by region. You can also define the metric 
by event type such as policy violation opposed to attempted exploit. In combination 
with other metrics, this can indicate the level of threats, the effectiveness of a specific 
security controls, or your incident detection capabilities. Additionally this could also 
help you see if changes to the environment are positively or negatively affecting your 
security posture. It will help you to strike the right balance, to find what is too many 
incidents and what is not enough, this is a good way to see some of that.
VULNERABILITIES
Vulnerability management is a vital part of keeping an organization’s assets safe; 
identifying and mitigating weaknesses found on systems especially priority or criti-
cal systems and applications reduces the risk of negatively impacting the business 
should these vulnerabilities be exploited. It is worth mentioning that it is impossible 
to predict or anticipate what vulnerability is going to be exploited. Because of this it 
is imperative that IT organizations and individual system, administrators work hard 

182
CHAPTER 8  Metrics
to get as close to 100% vulnerability free as possible. The SOC plays a key role in 
this area on several levels and can become a great partner in this effort. The primary 
question this activity is concerned with is: “Are my systems safe?” In vulnerability 
management terms, this question can be decomposed to: “Are there vulnerable sys-
tems? Have systems been checked, and if so, what was found?” and additionally how 
soon after a vulnerability was found did it get fixed. Finally, the last question is how 
well are system administrators managing and maintaining systems in the environ-
ment? Vulnerability assessment is the process of scanning networked devices and 
discovering vulnerabilities before hackers can exploit them, which is a perfect task 
for a SOC. Whereas vulnerability management is the process of evaluating vulner-
abilities, communicating required patches, escalating missing patches and vulner-
abilities to the right teams as well as approving exceptions and then overall reporting 
of open vulnerabilities in the environment.
An organizations network relies on accurate and timely exchange of informa-
tion. Due to the increase of threats and well-known vulnerabilities, an organization 
must have a vulnerability Management system or process that provides the latest 
vulnerability fixes and security updates to the organizational network. The SOC can 
provide analysis on the latest vulnerability information, fixes, and security updates to 
all divisions responsible for maintaining network and computing assets. The purpose 
of the SOC engaging in this effort is to monitor and identify new threats and new 
vulnerabilities (hardware and software) that might affect the confidentiality, integ-
rity or availability of the organizational IT assets. Also, these SOC services should 
be designed to aid system administrators in identifying existing and known vulner-
abilities as they emerge and to look for the successful application of security updates 
and configuration as recommended by the vendor. Additionally the SOC should be 
the point of contact to support IT system administrators in the correct application or 
support of applying patches.
The SOC can also be a focal point for collecting and approving exceptions to 
patching and vulnerabilities. If a vulnerable system cannot be patched due to opera-
tional constraints, the patch breaks core functionality or a system administrator is 
just too scared to apply a patch, the SOC can help. I say this last sentence partially 
joking, sometimes system administrators maintain legacy systems that are so old and 
have been so problematic that they are afraid to touch it because something always 
goes wrong. The bottom line is that you are only as strong as your weakest link and 
the process of approving exceptions in a vulnerability management process is one 
that should not be taken lightly. System/network administrators in cooperation with 
the SOC should put a mitigation plan in place of each vulnerability that cannot be 
properly patched in a production environment. Mitigation plans could consist of IDS 
block rules for the specific attempted exploit for the vulnerability, Removal of the 
system from a production VLAN, significantly limiting or blocking of the effected 
ports on the firewall to the vulnerable system or even removing the system from the 
network till a fix, security update or some kind of mitigation can be applied. I am 
sure there are many other mitigations you can apply and your organization may even 
have some unique mitigations. As always it is up to your organizations practice on 

183
﻿ Vulnerabilities
how you want to apply mitigations as part of the exception process but it should be 
a joint process between the SOC, your system administration team and your risk or 
compliance departments if you have them.
Typically the SOC team is responsible for keeping up to date with the latest 
threats and vulnerabilities and recommending mitigating strategies, solutions or fixes 
to System Administrators to be pushed to systems connected to the organizations 
network. The SOC can receive notifications/security alerts of new vulnerabilities and 
exploits related to security bugs or issues that may affect the network from places 
such as, US-CERT; full-disclosure; and Bugtraq. Any vendor’s technology that you 
have widely deployed in your environment will likely have a mailing list, twitter ac-
count or some kind of news announcement related to vulnerabilities that your SOC 
can subscribe to and upon receiving an alert of a new vulnerability, the SOC perform 
vulnerability management processes to determine the vulnerability criticality as it re-
lates to your organization. For example, if your SOC receives a notification that there 
is a critical vulnerability effecting Firefox on Linux but your organization does not 
use Linux then the SOC can downgrade the alert from its original critical to some-
thing that does not affect the organization and therefore would ignore. Conversely 
if that same alert effected Firefox in Windows and your organization heavily uses 
Firefox then the SOC could make the vulnerability widely known throughout the 
organization that it needs to be patched. There is also a large amount of data that can 
be obtained from intelligence sources and industry organizations sharing intelligence 
information but more of that is covered separately in chapter 9.
As part of the vulnerability assessment process I like as a best practice to ensure 
that every IP address in an organization is tested for vulnerabilities every 30 days. 
If you want to go back and read the last sentence that is ok because I did say “Every 
IP!”. I typically do not believe in scanning known assets because a network can be 
a living-breathing thing and as the network gets larger the movement and changes 
of the network happen faster so you are more likely to miss assets. By scanning 
IP address ranges you are scanning all possible locations for a device to exist 
regardless of where it is, how it got there or where it came from. Even in a very 
strict IT change management program things can take a long time to get updated 
or can be temporarily missed. By scanning all available IP addresses you can feel 
confident that you are going to get a large percentage of devices on the network at 
the time of the scan. The SOC can have another critical role in this area by reviewing 
scanning results and performing a comparison to an asset management tool to 
obtain a total percentage of devices scanned. In almost every environment there is 
a likelihood of having devices off, not connected to the network during the scan 
or that are transient such as laptops that do not get scanned on regular schedule 
because they are not always on the network. Keep in mind that various mandatory 
regulations may have an opinion in this area, which is something the SOC can help 
ensure compliance with. For example, the Payment Card Industry—Data Security 
Standard (PCI-DSS) states “all devices that store, processed, or transmit Primary 
Account Numbers” are in scope for PCI audits and as such must be scanned quarterly 
for vulnerabilities and have 4 quarterly clean reports. Something like the PCI-DSS 

184
CHAPTER 8  Metrics
limits your tolerance for devices not being scanned on a regular basis especially if 
it is in scope for the audit. Ultimately, you will have to figure out what is acceptable 
percentage for your organization. As I stated before, I like as a best practice in your 
vulnerability management program to scan IP on a 30 day rotation, this is typically 
due to the fact that new vulnerabilities are released every month and systems should 
be patched within 30 days of a patch being announced and available from a vendor. 
Again, for organizations complying with PCI, the PCI-DSS states that you have to 
have document quarterly clean scans, but if you only scan once a quarter it is not 
likely you are going to be successful in producing clean reports. By scanning every 
30 days you give system administrators or your patch team three shots at getting 
a clean scan. This cycle is long enough to not to cause undue network bandwidth 
or impact performance of servers and desktops but quick enough to be able to see 
improvement metrics. The SOC has another important role here as vulnerabilities and 
patches are announced. The SOC should have the ability to pull in patch compliance 
of something that is deemed highly critical to an organization. This would require all 
system administrators (assuming system patching is not a responsibility of the SOC) 
to patch in some time frame less than 30 days. In my experience, there seems to be 
one or two times a year where a SOC I was building would require quick compliance 
for patching in 7 days. This is because the vulnerability the patch protected against 
was severe and that the risk of exploitation was so great that waiting 30 days would 
be too risky for the organization. Typically in those situations I recommend the SOC 
hold a conference call or meeting and invite all of IT or all interested parties to 
join together where the technical implications of the vulnerability and impact to the 
organization can be discussed. This will allow for clear communication regarding the 
time compliance expectations and what the requirements are to resolve the issue. It 
also affords the IT organization to ask questions, raise concerns or offer up ideas on 
how to move the process faster.
So what is a vulnerability and why does all this stuff matter?
Vulnerabilities are security holes and bugs that are typically defects, or errors in 
software such as operating systems, drivers, and software applications. Unauthorized 
users and/or malware can use vulnerabilities to access desktops, laptops, servers or 
computer networks to steal data, degrade performance or disrupt services, and so on. 
As these vulnerabilities become known, software publishers develop patches, fixes, 
or updates that can be downloaded to fix the problem.
A good resource for vulnerability information can be found here → http://nvd.
nist.gov/.
VULNERABILITY PRIORITIZING
There are many different ways to score vulnerabilities but the principles are the same, 
the highest score equals the most critical vulnerability. An organization needs to have 
a fair and easily understandable way to score vulnerabilities and different methods 
mean different things for different people. What is right for your organization is up 
to you and there are many tools for you to use to help you in this area.

185
﻿ Temporal CVSS2 threshold
For example here are some ways to score vulnerabilities:
Simple
PCI
Vulnerability vendor
CVSS
Low = 1–4
Medium = 4.1–7
High = 7.1–10
Level 1
Level 2
Level 3
Level 4
Level 5
Low
Important
Medium
Severe
Critical
0–10
CVSS2
CVSS2 provides a universal open and standardized method for rating IT vulner-
abilities and scores range from 0 to 10.0. The scoring system is fully documented and 
available for use by the public.
BASE CVSS2 THRESHOLD
The base equation evaluates the access vector, the complexity involved to exploit a 
vulnerability and the level of authentication required to perform the exploit as well as 
the impact of a successful exploit on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of 
data. So an exploit of a vulnerability that can be performed over a network connec-
tion is easy to perform and requires little or no authentication receives a high score 
for exploitability. An exploit that reveals confidential information, damages or modi-
fies the information in some way, or makes information unavailable to those who 
need it receives a high score for impact. The calculated values for exploitability and 
Impact are used in the base formula to determine the CVSS2 score. The base score is 
a value ranging from 0 to 10.
More information about CVSS2 Base scoring is available here → http://www.
first.org/cvss/cvss-guide.html.
Calculations to establish base score can be found → http://www.first.org/cvss/
cvss-guide.html#i3.2.1.
TEMPORAL CVSS2 THRESHOLD
The temporal equation produces a score based on the base score as well as the current 
exploitation, remediation, and validity ratings of the reported vulnerability. A con-
firmed vulnerability for which a highly effective exploit is available, and for which 
no fix is available, will have a high temporal score. Temporal scores range from 0 to 
10 can be no higher than the base score and no more than 33% lower than the base 
score.
More information about CVSS2 Temporal scoring is available here → http://
www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide.html.
Calculations to establish base score can be found → http://www.first.org/cvss/

186
CHAPTER 8  Metrics
If you are required to comply with PCI then you have to use an authorized scan-
ning vendor/product to perform your scans and as a scoring system PCI uses the 
CVSS2 system but puts things into their own categories for compliance purposes. 
For example, scores range from 0 to 10.0, with 4.0 or higher will indicate a failure 
to comply with PCI standards and must be patched or an exception must filed and 
approved. There is also the legacy PCI scoring system that can still be used, as sanc-
tioned by the PCI DSS. This system ranks vulnerabilities on a severity scale from 1 to 
5. Any vulnerability ranking above 2 indicates failure to comply with PCI standards.
Level 5 vulnerabilities permit attacks with remote root or remote administrator 
capabilities that can compromise an entire host.
Level 4 vulnerabilities permit attacks with remote user capabilities and partial 
file system access.
Level 3 vulnerabilities permit access to specific stored information, such as 
security settings.
Level 2 vulnerabilities expose some sensitive host information, such as precise 
versions of services.
Level 1 vulnerabilities expose information such as open ports.
Also with PCI, any vulnerability leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL 
injection will indicate failure, regardless of CVSS score.
ASSET PRIORITIZING AS A PART OF METRICS
Now that we have reviewed how to categorized vulnerabilities, we need to do the 
same with assets. Just as a reminder from above, the idea with vulnerabilities is to 
shut the door on hackers and malware as quick as possible. You want to be 100% 
patched across your entire organization but need to make sure you compliant as ef-
ficiently and as effectively as possible. Prioritizing assets are a great way to measure 
your overall risk exposure and give the senior leadership a level of comfort that risk 
is always being reduced in priority order. If you have a system that uniformly ap-
plies patches across your organization regardless of criticality I would still perform 
this exercise. Focused metrics and performance statistics on key or critical assets are 
extremely valuable and if you are always patched then that is a great metric to pro-
duce. This also allows you to measure the effectiveness of risk mitigation by setting 
goals of reduced vulnerability exposure and speedier mitigation. As you look at these 
valuable assets in your organization you can use them to audit the performance of 
security and IT teams performance, and implement process improvements to build a 
culture of refining your security operations.
Defining the relative criticality of assets is an essential step in your disaster re-
covery and business continuity planning process; as such this is a great opportunity 
for you SOC to get involved in detester recovery (DR)/business continuity (BC). In 
addition, the contingency plan standard in the HIPAA security regulation calls for or-
ganizations to “Assess the relative criticality of specific applications and data….”. If 
you do this right it will save you a significant amount of time because the information 

187
﻿ Asset prioritizing as a part of metrics
is reusable in many different areas. Here are some things to consider before embark-
ing on your asset prioritizing effort.
Keep in mind that the criticality of your information assets is nothing more than a 
business decision about what systems or applications are more important than others. 
You should work to get a varying degree of opinions on each system or application. 
The more views the better. Chances are that an engineering team will have a very 
different viewpoint than a finance department. The relative criticality analysis is a 
team effort.
In managing critical assets, many organizations fail to fully understand the mean-
ing behind a criticality ranking of systems. A “critical” asset may have the greatest 
impact on the organizations function, be it production rate, quality of product pro-
duced, cost per product produced, core network functionality or key financial system. 
Through proper construction of criteria and analysis of systems against that criteria 
will result in an analysis model that an organization can live by to determine what 
their critical assets are.
Here are some of the things you may want to consider:
• 
Business or customer impact
• 
Financial impact due to downtime
• 
High availability/uptime requirement (e.g., 7 × 24 availability)
• 
Safety or environmental impact
• 
Preventive maintenance history
• 
Mean time between failures (MTBF) or “reliability”
• 
Probability of failure
• 
Replacement or parts lead time
• 
Asset replacement value
• 
Planned utilization rate
• 
Number of users (i.e., large number of users)
• 
Stores critical information (e.g., grades, social security number)
• 
Impacts to reputation of the organization due to downtime
Also keep in mind that systems may be a critical part of your organization ac-
cording to legislation, regulation, policy, contractual, or other predetermined means. 
There are many books and documents out there to help you in this process, I am 
merely using these points to show how a SOC can provide value in this area as part 
of the overall vulnerability management program.
The most common examples of critical servers are departmental file servers, web 
servers, mail servers, and database servers. A “critical” server can be classified as 
such by being important to accomplishing organizational missions or one that stores 
legally protected or other important non-public data. Here are some examples of 
what you may find as critical servers in your organization:
• 
Enterprise level services that is used by all employees or significant to one or 
more lines of business.
• 
Servers storing significant amount of legally protected data

188
CHAPTER 8  Metrics
• 
Availability is critical or important
• 
Servers hosting key financial applications
• 
Servers running or hosting applications for industrial control systems

Now that we have an idea about vulnerabilities, ways to prioritize them as well 
as assets, we need to put it all together to demonstrate some useful metrics. These 
metrics are key to how your SOC is viewed outside of its area. It can very quickly 
become a critical product that becomes one of the key faces of the SOC.
Scanning metrics can be tricky and time consuming to produce, you have to be 
careful that you represent what is truly happening in an environment. Good vulner-
ability metrics can be vital to an organization and a key product of your SOC. Vul-
nerabilities are very dynamic in any environment and it is not always easy to get a 
handle on it in a consistent way. Creating metrics in this area is highly valuable in 
order to continually improve your security risk posture, you must measure it using 
common metrics and compare it to past measurements in some meaningful way.
Some of the challenges come from how often new vulnerabilities are announce 
or the frequency of when patches become available. Additionally, vulnerability-scan-
ning vendors regularly update how they detect vulnerabilities by changing specific 
methods to verify or discover that a system is indeed vulnerable to an issue they were 
checking for. For example, this means that in some cases if you have a system where 
10 vulnerabilities are detected today and report it as such and then next week you de-
tect that there are 12, did you increase by 2? In fact, all 10 of the previously detected 
vulnerabilities may have been resolved but 12 new ones were detected. In this case if 
you reported the metric of 12 you are going to upset the system administrator or the 
person in charge of patching systems unless you can accurately reflect the previously 
accomplished work.
For another example to help understand the complexities, let us say that you de-
cide to only report on newly detected vulnerabilities 30 days or older. As scanning 
vendors update their detection engine you may find that a system was vulnerable to 
something several months old but not detected until now due to the updated detection 
method. This is because the scanning vendor constantly tries to improve its product 
and customers constantly provide feedback and various false negatives get fixed. 
This does not mean that the system was not vulnerable until it was just detected but 
it could be that nobody knew about it until it showed up in the scan results. So let us 
say that this occurs and the newly detected vulnerability was actually announced by 
the vendor a year ago. This vulnerability has affected the system for a year but it was 
just detected, so do you beat up the system administrator for having an un-patched 
vulnerability on their system for a year or do you expect them to patch during their 
normal cycle now that they know about it and you can hold them accountable to the 
results? Some would say that administrators should patch their systems regularly and 
should be fully aware of any vulnerability that affects the systems that they manage 

189
﻿ Asset prioritizing as a part of metrics
regardless of scanning and reporting. Unfortunately this is not always reasonable in 
large organizations so be aware of this pit fall and make sure when you report your 
metrics that you are not alienating your IT staff, you need their help.
Now that we have discussed some pitfalls of vulnerability metrics, let us look at 
some other more specific metrics you may want to consider. This is where a SOC can 
provide some great benefit. As security professionals the SOC should be able to look 
at the results of a scan and be able to quickly determine the validity of the results, 
rule out any obvious false positive items and craft meaningful reports for the various 
levels of people in the company who need them.
A simple metric is the number of current vulnerabilities detected in an organiza-
tion. This metric can be shown against the total number of devices in the organization 
by region if you want.
Sources of vulnerabilities could include new un-patched systems or applications 
introduced to the organization’s environment or the discovery of new vulnerabilities 
on existing systems and applications. Unfortunately this can be a fairly large number 
and a bit scary if you are just starting out. As we previously discussed, one of the very 
first things you can do is work to classify vulnerabilities and your assets into priori-
ties to help make the process more efficient. If you have a high priority system with 
a high priority vulnerability then it is obvious you need to fix this first. Then a simple 
report can be generated to show the top 10 vulnerabilities that exist on the top 10 
critical assets. Seems like an ideal punch list for someone to focus on if you ask me!
Let us break this down further and see if there are other interesting metrics that 
can be produced.
The vulnerabilities can be breakdown by operating system, application, or or-
ganization division. The intent is for the metric to show the number of high, me-
dium, and low vulnerabilities that exist in a specific area in the company. Again, as 
discussed before, you may use a different breakdown of vulnerabilities other than 
high, medium, or low. This metric provides a high level measurement of how the 

190
CHAPTER 8  Metrics
organization is doing, cut across several dimensions. You can break it up as much as 
you need to in order to fit your organizational requirements.
A nice example of this metric may be the following:
# Critical vulnerabilities detected
# Devices
Operating system
Department
3474
247
Windows 7
Finance
Another important metric is the most vulnerable applications, with a breakdown 
into vulnerability score by application version—this metric helps highlight old, vul-
nerable versions of software that should be upgraded or eliminated. This also dem-
onstrates the risk to an organization associated by a specific piece of software that 
is not being managed or updated properly. There are many ways to show this and 
depending on your organizations patch management practices this could be very use-
ful to highlight areas that need more focus.
How about unowned devices and unapproved applications? Vulnerability scan-
ning systems typically do a good job at enumerating device names and if you are 
performing authenticated scans then the system should be able to provide you a list 
of installed applications by devices and as an entire list. Assuming your organization 
uses a standard naming convention for devices, when you look through a sorted list 
of device names you should be able to easily spot devices that do not belong. If you 
are able to filter out devices that were detected on guest networks then you should 
have a fairly good listing of devices that are either misconfigured or just do not be-
long on your production network. Having your SOC track down these devices and 
determine why they are connected and who connected them may be a smart thing to 
do. This metric is very useful to track “unowned” devices that may be rogue devices 
or simply contractor/consultant systems, as well as the trend of applications that are 
not specifically allowed on the network.
HISTORICAL MONITORING OF PATCHES
If your SOC announces patches to the organization and tracks those announcements 
then you can chart metrics based on those previously announced patches between 
specific dates. Take a look at the announced patches against the number of assets 
detected to be missing those patches. This will help you determine the number of 
patches still not installed. This could indicate entire software updates that have not 
begun to be installed by system administrators or by patch management tools. As a 
result this can easily tell you the number of open vulnerabilities due to the missing 
patches that currently exist on your network. Although this is a risk metric it is also 
a good metric to give your system administrators as they can use it as a priority list 
of patches to be installed if you assume the highest number should be patched first.
After the fact metrics are also vitally important, you need to know how long 
patches are an open issue. This will tell you how long your systems are vulnerable 
for but will also tell you what the average time to remediate systems needed patches 

191
﻿ Historical monitoring of patches
take. Like some of the other metrics you can slice and dice this up by device group, 
by category or by patch type. From a compliance perspective, this metric also tells 
you how many patches are behind per your organization policy that has a dictated 
deadline. Additionally this metric can be further expanded and compared with other 
metrics such as what vulnerabilities are currently being exploited in the wild, are 
currently not patched in your organization but are also being taken advantage of by 
malware that AV may not be catching.
Finally your SOC can track how many systems are being compromised due the 
malware and exploits taking advantage of known missing patches on systems that 
have been reported to be out of compliance. Depending on how bad this situation is 
in your organization it would also be important to create a metric show how much 
time it takes for the SOC to go through this entire process of announcing patches, 
scanning for vulnerabilities, remediating systems, and providing metrics.
Putting this all together, you can create what I consider a metric of the window 
of opportunity. This is the time from when patch is available until there is 100% 
application of that patch is the “window of opportunity” to have that vulnerability 
exploited and leaves the enterprise at risk. Although you may think there are other 
items that can be in this list, the basic concept is the same no matter how you want to 
slice it up. The order usually looks like this.
1.	 Vulnerability discovery
a.	 This is a “negative day” event; this is where an attacker discovers a 
vulnerability and creates to software needed to take advantage of the hole. 
The attacker will then devise a mechanism to deliver and properly exploit 
that vulnerability. This could typically happen several days or months before 
the next step of zero day.
2.	 Zero day
a.	 Typically zero day refers to an attack that exploits a previously publically 
unknown vulnerability in a computer application. This also means that there 
is no patch to address the vulnerability and close the security hole.
3.	 Public exploit code available
a.	 In this stage, the code needed to exploit a vulnerability is no longer in the 
hands of the select few. It is either published by the original creators or 
someone else and is now freely available to the general public who are 
interested in using it.
4.	 Mitigations deployed
a.	 Depending on how much you know about a particular vulnerability you may 
be able to perform several actions to reduce your risk and exposure without 
actually patching. This could be closing off or restricting firewall rules, 
deploying intrusion detection signatures for the type of activity that might 
occur, and so on.

192
CHAPTER 8  Metrics
5.	 Patches available
a.	 This is the day the vendor publishes the required software patch and 
procedure to fix the hole.
6.	 Patches deployed
a.	 This is the day your organization deploys the required patch.
There are many metrics you can make if you track any of the above information 
for an individual vulnerability and its specific patch. Select metrics could consist of 
the mean time to risk reduced. This is great to show how proactive your SOC is and 
the steps you take to protect the company. A residual risk metric could be a tail value, 
which would be calculated after your set policy deadline for patching, the number 
of devices where the vulnerability still exists and the criticality of the vulnerability 
associated with the effectiveness of the mitigations you deployed. It will also help to 
demonstrate the current state of risk your organization is in when the vulnerability 
begins to be exploited and malware begins to arrive targeting the issue.
The numbers should help drive the point home that patching in the first place 
is cheaper, more efficient and just better for everyone involved. Otherwise you are 
demonstrating through metrics all the hard work of your SOC, which is not a bad 
thing at all.
Keeping on the trend of incident based metrics, and using them for security anal-
ysis, threat based metrics can have some very interesting results and can also help tell 
you and your organization how well you are doing in specific areas.
Have you ever wondered how many viruses were blocked by the antivirus sys-
tem? As a security practitioner this is not a value that is very important to you but if 
your antivirus (AV) systems are doing a good job then people may forget how impor-
tant the tool is in protecting the computers they are installed on. Your management 
and leadership may not realize that the care and feeding your SOC puts into making 
sure systems are kept up to date with AV and how that pays off. Of course the number 
of viruses AV let through and how many systems get infected on a regular basis is 
also an important metric and one that should be tracked on a much closer basis.
Sticking with the malware theme, understanding the types of malware encoun-
tered (i.e., virus, worm, Trojan) and how this compares to other similar organizations 
or the universe as reported by an authoritative source is very important. There are a 
few magazines and websites that publish weekly or monthly virus metrics, you can 
use these sources to compare what you are seeing on your network. You want to 
make sure you are seeing and catching the right things or you may find that you are 
missing something. If possible you also want to find out how the threat penetrated the 
organization in the first place (i.e., email attachment, website visits, hacking). This 
information is vital when you look to see how you can improve the overall security 
of an organization. It will also help you evaluate the need for additional purchases 
of threat mitigation solutions. It should also help you understand how you should 
prioritize different threats and which ones you may need to monitor more closely or 
even which assets you should monitor closer.

193
﻿ Historical monitoring of patches
Overall metrics are also important to calculate and use especially if the metrics 
show the effectiveness and efficiency of the SOC. The SOC needs positive press to 
ensure that people can appreciate the hard work they do. A great way to present the ef-
forts of a SOC into an easy to understand metric is a funnel chart. The funnel chart can 
show all the data feeds the SOC is currently collecting, such as Firewall data, VPN, 
IDS, and so on. There is a raw number of events that are generated by all these devices 
and fed into a log collector or SIEM tool. Based on rules, correlation, and aggregation 
of these events only a few incidents are generated into tickets that the SOC actually 
has to analyze. Then there is a false positive rate that can also be calculated based off 
of ticket information. To build this chart you need to look at every aspect of the SOC.
We start off looking at every single individual event that was either collected or 
generated into the SOC tools inside of a single month. In the case above, we are look-
ing at 9 Billion events total for the month, this can be broken out by device type or 
what device generated the event if you want that level of detail. Next, all the events 
go through a SIEM tool or some kind of collection point that is able to look at the 
events and determine their validity for a SOC review and analyze. There are many 
ways that events can be condensed down. First you can have an aggregation process, 
this is where you take multiple events that are the same, count them up and produce 
only a single incident representative of all the others. So for example, does a SOC 
need to see 10,000 deny logs from a firewall or just a single event that states there 
were 10,000. Aggregation saves a ton of time and dramatically reduces the number 
of investigations a SOC needs to perform. Multiple events that are generated by the 
same session or packet, same host or destination or that has similar attack attributes 
can all be condensed into smaller or single events opposed to sending the raw infor-
mation to an analyst.

194
CHAPTER 8  Metrics
Rules and correlation are a way to take events that mean almost nothing and join 
them together to mean something that is worth an investigation. For example, one 
user visiting a website is not necessarily bad unless there is a rule that states the web-
site is bad and an incident gets created for the SOC to investigate.
The reduction of raw events by aggregation and the creating of new events with 
rules and correlation in the above chart shows that 645 incidents were generated in 
total for the month out of the 9 Billion presented. This is a good metric to look at and 
can help you understand many different aspects of your SOC. For example, if the 
total time it takes to address an incident ticket, analyze, and escalate if needed is ap-
propriately 15 min, then this translates to approximately 161 h of work for the month 
by an analyst. That is enough work for a single analyst working a 40-h workweek and 
they will have no time to do anything else.
The next value we see is the 85% true positive rate, this is a very important metric 
because it shows the overall effectiveness of the system. Out of the 645 tickets gener-
ated less than 100 were created falsely. If you have an engineering team responsible 
for tuning all the devices, creating rules and making everything work then this is a 
great tribute to their efforts or whoever is responsible for all that hard work. It also 
gives the team a nice metric to look at when compared to the total number of events, 
the number of rules and the total effort going into managing the entire system. The 
focus should be on working hard to get the true positive percentage higher so that 
nobody is working tickets that do not matter and everyone can work on tickets that 
do. These types of metrics should also be reviewed along with how many new rules 
were created in a month, alongside new rules created in security devices such as 
IDS signatures or data loss rules and how those new additions effected the overall 
total incidents generated into the SOC and if the overall true positive rate rose or fell 
for the month. Additionally, these metrics can help you understand the overall level 
of work being performed in the SOC and what the total capacity is for the SOC to 
perform its function. If you use the graphed example above in your SOC and you 
had two analysts then you can deduce that if all the tickets were evenly worked than 
each analyst worked 20 h a week on incident tickets. Knowing that the average ticket 
takes 15 min then each analyst has the capacity to work an approximate additional 
80 tickets per week, assuming that analysts do nothing else but work tickets. This is 
important as you look to put more security tools in place and increase the workload 
in the SOC. This metric allows you to see how efficient the SOC is running and what 
your overall capacity may be to perform incidents. Obviously there are many other 
factors that need to be reviewed and a single significant incident that takes all day 
to resolve or many days or weeks to resolve may cause these numbers to change 
dramatically.
Lastly you can break down what type of incidents occurred in what parts of the 
organization against what assets or types of assets. This will help you evaluate repeat 
issues or targets that may be too soft and needs some hardening or even users that 
may needs some extra security awareness training. Additionally, by looking at these 
types of metrics you may even be able to understand better who are our attackers and 
specifically what are they targeting or possibly trying to steal from you.

195
﻿ Historical monitoring of patches
As you progress in building your operations, the metrics will help you evaluate 
your response to security threats. You can ask important questions like how many 
incidents are you tracking and how long did it take to investigate and remediate inci-
dents or even how effective the security systems are that you have in place. Are your 
resources allocated appropriately? Do you have the right number of people reacting 
to issues? Only your metrics can tell you. Your operations center will have largely 
different metrics than others, that mean something to you and that help identify how 
well or how bad your tools are behaving for you. Different security suites of tools 
will lend its self to different metrics that you will want to track. Do not worry about 
having too much, or metrics that are not good enough, metrics that work and that tell 
the right story will be asked for by others. Try making metrics, use spreadsheets or 
pull them from your tools directly, not matter how you get them just get them and 
try to use them, try to make sense out of them and try to see if others would benefit 
from them as well.
Every SOC should see themselves as a service organization. Even if you are an 
internal operations center or especially if you are an outsourced security provider you 
need to define and identify who your customers are and make sure you are continu-
ally providing value to them. Keep your customers engaged, show off your value, 
produce quality metrics that mean something to them and that is as actionable as pos-
sible. Engage with them and ask if there are more metrics you can provide or work 
with them to define better metrics. The SOC is on the front like every day battling 
the cyber war, unfortunately there are no physical wounds or physical costs associ-
ated with this as it is all virtual. You need to demonstrate your strength, efforts and 
communicate your weaknesses effectively so that others easily see your value and 
understand your struggles.
Provide daily metrics to your SOC to keep them on task but do not overload them 
with meaningless information. Keep it simple, useful and easy to understand. Pro-
vide supervisors with a nice mix of daily, weekly and monthly information to help 
them ensure they are steering the ship in the right direction and have enough real-
time data to make immediate course corrections. Provide management with weekly, 
monthly and yearly metrics to help educate them on trends and ensure they are kept 
up to date on trends, issues and of course successes. If at all possible, ensure that 
senior leadership also gets metrics specifically designed to keep them updated on 
what is going on and things that may be important to them. The SOC may never get 
a seat at the table with senior leadership but that does not mean you should not pro-
vide regular information and updates to the best of your ability. It will go a long way 
when problems do arise and you can be assured that they will. Do not forget that data 
become information that can be turned into metrics. It is those metrics that you must 
analyze in order to take the right actions.

“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred 
battles. If you know yourself but not your enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer 
a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”
Sun Tzu
Security intelligence is critical for a SOC to have in place. It is the single greatest 
tool that is used to help protect an organization’s network. What is security intel-
ligence as it relates to the protection of information technology and why do you 
need it?
Intelligence information can come from many different sources and is the process 
of gathering information, evaluating it, correlating and interpreting, and then dis-
seminating it to decision makers or, in the case of the SOC, applying it to rules and 
tools that make it valuable.
There are arguably more than two types of intelligence, but I want here to break 
intelligence down into two simple types based on ultimate source.
First, you have reactive information gathered internally by fully evaluating sys-
tem compromises, forensic examinations, malware analysis, and also by asking key 
questions and building metrics to explain an increase in successful security incidents 
or if there is some kind of trend underway. This information is typically more in 
line with traditional security and is a trailing or lagging indicator of something gone 
wrong. An absolute critical component to your intelligence program is that once you 
know something bad about one system, you can then go look for that same bad thing 
on all your other systems to see if there is more out there. You can “wash, rinse, 
repeat” this information over and over again and every time you find something new 
on your network you can go over it again and again.

CHAPTER 9  Intelligence
Next you have proactive threat information or leading indicators. These typically 
are gained from external sources. This is information that is open source (OSINT), 
purchased information, or information gained by being a part of an organization that 
shares threat data. This is information that is gained from other organizations that 
may have already seen this activity but is advanced knowledge to you because you 
may not have known about it previously. These proactive methods employ the use 
of information from partners, suppliers, reputation, and trust databases. The intel-
ligence information can be extracted from web pages, blogs, wikis, IRC chat ses-
sions, search engines, phishing emails, open FTP sites and file sharing networks, P2P 
networks, newsgroups, online auctions, and many others. It is a move from a more 
tactical approach to a more strategic focus.
This is an approach that integrates intelligence analysis methods, tools, and pro-
cesses proactively to address security risk in today’s highly threatened environment. 
This is an equal part practical application of traditional Internet and network moni-
toring with applied intelligence analysis. Your SOC will need to perform advanced 
search strategies and pattern recognition techniques to identify, detect, and analyze 
actual and potential threats to your organization. The use of intelligence is uniquely 
able to protect an organization or enterprise as well as individuals and their identities. 
By identifying threats generated by criminals, predators, extremists, activists, insid-
ers, and other blackhats, information can be collected and analyzed and actions can 
be taken toward the prevention and mitigation of security risks.
By using these two types of intelligence, you can create a new form of warning 
system or warning intelligence. This is collective information that can alert you to 
emerging threats and can be inputs to your risk management system. For example, 
if you know of a piece of malware that is taking advantage of an exploitable bug in 
software you run on a critical system, but were not able to patch previously, you may 
be able to do something about it now knowing your risk may be increased. Some of 
the warning intelligence is a bit of a no brainer. For example, if you are seeing nine 
out of 10 of the latest malware variants taking advantage of holes in Adobe Flash, 
then perhaps you should make sure that all Adobe Flash players on your network are 
up to date to mitigate that threat. Other times it may not be so obvious, but knowing 
how a specific malware family works may help you dial-in to effective mitigations. 
A good example is how the Blackhole exploit kit works. I don’t want to get into too 
many technical details here, but it’s worth a quick look.
A user who visits a web page hosting the Blackhole exploit kit becomes compro-
mised. How this works is simply that JavaScript quickly determines via a vulnerabil-
ity scan what applications and versions of those applications, such as Adobe Flash 
or Acrobat, Microsoft Office, or Internet Explorer are on the user’s computers and 
loads exploits to which it thinks the computer is vulnerable to and tries to exploit 
those applications. Once the computer is compromised, it will download further mal-
ware. Your intelligence research may yield you two things: first is a list of known 
domains and links that are hosting the exploit kit. If you are able to load up those 
domains into a SIEM or other log management system or build rules around the do-
mains in other tools, then anyone on your monitored network going to those domains 

199
﻿ Intelligence
will be spotted and you can react appropriately. Second, you may discover that there 
is a loose pattern around how the domain names are built or what the links are and 
you can build a regular expression rule to catch anyone going to a URL matching 
that pattern. In this case, you may have a high degree of false positives; but, if you 
correlate that information with antivirus logs, you may be able to detect the exploit 
activity to some degree of success. Short of having a rock solid intrusion detection 
rule built and deployed on your network, this is a great example of how multiple 
pieces of intelligence can be used to build an effective warning system. Getting this 
information, digesting it, and being able to use it in an innovative way to protect 
your organization is just another way your SOC will provide continuing value and 
remain relevant.
The previous example seems fairly straightforward. You can argue the effec-
tiveness or the accuracy and by the time this book is printed, the exploit example 
may be old news, but the point remains the same. Your effective use of intelligence 
information will go a long way to protect your organization. In that pursuit, you also 
always need to keep in mind the quality of the intelligence you receive from outside 
sources and ensure that the information is accurate and as complete as possible. You 
also should make sure that the information you are getting is timely and that it’s real. 
Timely may not be that big of a deal if it’s ongoing and valid data, but depending 
on what you are dealing with you need to make sure your information is as accurate 
as possible. A good example of this is in one SOC where I worked. The thinking at 
the time was that creating a massive MD5 database of all known good and bad files 
would help to make things much more secure. You can block the known bad or only 
let the known good execute or both. There are plenty of tools and hash databases out 
there to help you with this as well. The National Software Reference Library is a 
good example of where you can get this type of data (http://www.nsrl.nist.gov/). I am 
not going to tell you that MD5 hashing is good or bad, but as an example of inaccu-
rate intelligence, this MD5 system will choke you. You see, the SOC was putting so 
much time and effort into creating MD5 hash databases that a good hash got into the 
bad hash system. There obviously was a process step missing to validate information 
and the quality of the intelligence that was being fed into the database. Unfortunate-
ly, the bad hash database was preventing any files from executing on participating 
systems that matched the bad hash list, essentially creating an execution black list. 
The hash that was incorrectly inserted into the database was a key file needed to run 
the endpoint antivirus software, which essentially caused a shutdown of antivirus on 
all the workstations and laptop systems on the network. HaHaHa, very funny, well 
let your imagination run wild a bit and see how badly this error could have impacted 
an organization’s operation such as a hospital or power plant. Again, I am not saying 
that MD5 hashing is a bad idea, but this example shows you how bad intelligence 
fed into the wrong system can have very negative impacts. Make sure you have high 
quality of data and that you have the right processes and procedures to validate and 
test that data.
You need to know the quality of the intelligence you are receiving and also need 
to do some evaluation of that information as you apply it to your tools. Change 

200
CHAPTER 9  Intelligence
management in this case becomes a very important function that your SOC needs to 
engage not only internally but also with the remainder of the IT organization on an 
ongoing and regular basis.
When one of your SOC analysts or engineers generates intelligence infor-
mation internally, using your tools, that information should be considered both 
highly reliable and trusted, especially if they are following internal SOC pro-
cesses to develop that information. If you get some intelligence from a magazine, 
newspaper, TV, or some random blog site, then its source and reliability may 
not be of such high quality. Information Security Intelligence is very fast mov-
ing, and can change in seconds. You are not always able to get verification of 
information from multiple sources, thus you have to trust the original source as 
much as possible and do the right thing with the information. Good intelligence 
information can include IP addresses, domain names, strings found inside an 
executable, and file hashes but these elements can be highly volatile or they may 
stick around for a while. Whether you generate your own intelligence informa-
tion, purchase it, or get it for free, keep in mind that the more generic your in-
formation, the more false positives you likely will have; but, at the same time, 
intelligence that is too specific will not be agile enough to spot minor variations 
in your applied data.
Security intelligence is a constantly growing collection of information from 
outside sources (know thy enemy) and from within your own organization (know 
thyself).
KNOW THYSELF
Adversaries are constantly changing their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP). 
SOCs need information related to these new TTPs to ensure their tools are config-
ured properly to see and/or stop the attacks the adversaries are making or be able 
to detect malware coming into the environment. By collecting all usable informa-
tion from every incident, performing forensics, network analysis, malware analysis, 
and discovering new ways to better detect those events is intelligence you build 
yourself. They all are part of the “know yourself” side of the equation. But that 
is only part of the battle, you need to know how your network is configured, how 
your desktops and servers are hardened and protected, what active directory group 
policies are applied, and how your networking infrastructure—such as routers and 
switches—are managed. As stated before, if your organization has a mature IT de-
partment, your SOC also need to be a part of change management and have access 
to asset management tools. SOCs need to know what systems are doing on the 
network, what is their purpose, who put them there, and who must be contacted if 
there are questions or issues. This may appear like a lot, but it is basic information 
that helps the SOC determine if there are issues or if they are just chasing ghosts. 
It also helps the remainder of the IT organization because the SOC is not typically 
involved in building infrastructure. Thus, when there is an issue, the SOC will need 

201
﻿ Know thyself
to call people from IT to get answers instead of being able to help themselves. For 
example, just knowing that a specific server is a database server such as MySQL 
may be very helpful to a SOC instead … of guessing it is a web server that an at-
tacker just compromised.
Having access to an asset management system goes a long way for an organiza-
tion like a SOC in the “know thyself” part of the equation.
There are several places from which an organization can obtain intelligence. 
The type of information you can use depends on the level of sophistication in 
your SOC and the tools you have deployed. Information such as honey-pot-
captured payloads may be used to create your own IDS or you can even find 
already-built signatures to try. Sometimes you can find IDS or scan logs of large 
sensor networks that can indicate trends you may want to search for on your net-
work. Intelligence related to denial of service attacks (DoS) statistics may prove 
helpful if you can translate the information into something with which you can 
tune your devices to protect against or detect. Of course, there is also a wealth of 
information out there regarding general security news and vulnerability reports. 
These are helpful for noting how your organization is effected or protected and 
can even help prioritize needed upgrades or remediation issues. Captured mal-
ware samples are good to see trends and test your anti-virus tools to ensure you 
are properly protected. Phishing infrastructure and sample data is good to use to 
help tune your spam filters and prevent these types of email messages from get-
ting to you users. Also botnet command and control data are fantastic intelligence 
data that you can use to check if systems on your network are talking to known 
bad servers.
Let us get into a bit more detail and describe what you can do with this infor-
mation, how you can benefit, and perhaps even spark some ideas for you. Getting 
information and finding good sources of information are the first steps. But, be 
sure you evaluate the information you find and ensure you can build a valuable use 
case for that information. Being an intelligence hoarder does not sound like a bad 
idea, but collecting information for the sake of having it will only overwhelm you 
and your tools. You need to make sure you have the right information to achieve 
your goals.
The information you collect should all be actionable; then your actionable threat 
intelligence must be optimized for collection, analysis, and delivery.
When building an intelligence component of your SOC, you must gather, corre-
late, and aggregate events from across many different threat vectors and then apply 
them appropriately to the tools you have. Then you need to focus on how to pres-
ent the information in a way that provides context and relevance. The intelligence 
information will then provide you situational awareness and actionable data and 
give you the visibility you need to protect your organization or begin your incident 
response and notification processes. In order to make this work in your SOC envi-
ronment, you need to ensure your events are properly correlated and aggregated into 
incidents that matter to your organization and to organize the threat landscape to 
provide situational awareness. Then, as discussed in other chapters, your incidents 

202
CHAPTER 9  Intelligence
will then be prioritized by relevance and severity for incident response actions and 
remediation efforts.
Key point: Sometimes intelligence information can come in the form of a single 
string or thousands of IP addresses. Your SOC should work to automate as much as 
possible: automate the collecting of the information and the application of the data. 
Scripts can update different tools or software and in some cases can be created by 
the SOC team.
The following are examples of current intelligence feeds that your SOC can 
use in its tools arsenal to help combat such things as advance persistence threat 
and common botnets, but also the more common financial cybercrime and identity 
theft.
KNOWN IP SPACE, KNOW THY ENEMY
A quick search on the Internet can get you lists of IP addresses by country. This in-
formation may not appear like very useful cyber intelligence, but blocking as much 
IP space as possible is always a good way to start protecting your network. The SOC 
should always be aware of what IP space an organization does not need to allow ac-
cess. If there are specific countries with which you do not work, then shut out their 
IPs from connecting to your network. There may be IP addresses from countries or 
locations you are unsure of and can’t block, by identifying these IPs you can put 
them on watch lists and see what they do. There are also lists of other classifications 
of IP addresses you may be interested in watching. Known proxy IPs, VPN net-
works, and transient DHCP networks may also be of interest to you. By classifying 
these external IP addresses, you can categorize the connection information and begin 
to build some intelligence from them.
There are also many other types of bad-IP lists that your SOC can use to give 
you greater fidelity into what may be going on with your network or hosts in your 
organization. Known spamming IPs … botnet network IPs … there are also many 
different block lists of IP addresses that have done various bad things for which you 
may want to be on the alert. These lists can get more and more fine-tuned as you get 
into it and as you find them. There are also various intelligence exchange networks 
that you can become join. These exchanges can offer you IP reputational databases 
that are updated in real time and tell you of bad-acting addresses. This can help you 
find internal IP addresses that may be communicating with known Command and 
Control (C&C or C2) servers. These C2 servers may be master consoles of botnet 
or zombie networks and if you discover internal systems communicating with them, 
you have some incident response and possible forensic work to do. The exchange 
also may be able to give you information that will help you spot peer to peer (P2P) 
botnet activity. P2P activity can be very difficult to spot on your network and any 
information or intelligence about the different botnets out there can only help.
Various companies and the open source community have installed sever-
al honey-pot networks. These honey pots collect information about attacks and 

203
﻿ Blacklists
probes and then publishes that information for you to consume and use to help pro-
tect your network. One such honey pot watches and monitors how data is stolen or 
exfiltrated from a network. This server network allows an attacker to compromise 
the server systems and then watches what the attackers do to remove data from 
the network. The attackers are observed using the normal web protocols of HTTP, 
FTP, SSH, or they even just email the information to themselves. An attacker will 
use these methods as well as more covert data transfers like DNS or ICMP. This 
by no means covers all the ways an attacker can steal data, but the important thing 
is that this information can be observed and valuable intelligence can be gained 
from watching the actions of the attackers. This information can then be shared 
in the cyber defense community and be used by your SOC further to advance the 
capabilities of the tools deployed in your organization’s network to detect this type 
of activity.
Another such intelligence database focuses on malware. I am not talking about 
an antivirus database or how antivirus software detects malware but something even 
more. This database catalogs the network exploit packets, which are the actual pack-
ets that are seen on the network that indicate a system has been compromised. These 
packets are sometimes too sophisticated for intrusion detection and need advanced 
correlation between DNS requests and web proxy URL requests to be seen prop-
erly. Additionally, this database can be used to help spot how the C2 connection 
appears on the network. Sometimes a system will only send one packet or beacon of 
information to a peer or central server to register itself to the botnet network. This 
is like looking for a needle in a haystack. If you employ the information from the 
malware database properly, however, then you ultimately will be more successful 
and prepared when that one packet of information gets transferred. You may think 
this information is fairly static, but if you look at the statistics from any of the major 
antivirus vendors regarding the number of new malware entered into the wild every 
day, you easily will realize that this is a large set of information with which to deal. 
Over the last year or so I have seen this information grow and change to the point 
where there are 400 new communication strings and hosts a day that a SOC needs to 
be aware of and track.
BLACKLISTS
A few years back, a new tool in the network defense arsenal started popping up. 
Blacklists containing information about IP addresses that exhibited poor behavior 
started growing. Each blacklist created focused on a different thing in an effort to 
differentiate themselves. These lists ranged from spamming IP addresses to websites 
hosting malware. Many lists were created to track spammers and some lists have not 
survived over the years, but there are a few out there that are worth a look.
Most commercial vendors, spam filters, and web proxy companies will use these 
blacklists as well. It is important for a SOC to be aware of them in case they need to 
further apply specific lists that their tools may not be utilizing or if there are technical 

204
CHAPTER 9  Intelligence
reasons why they want to apply the information in a different way or with different 
tools.
As with what I mentioned before, the biggest lists contain IP addresses of systems 
that have been seen sending various types of spam. But others also include informa-
tion on universal resource identifiers (URI) that are typically seen inside of phishing 
emails that entice a user to click a link. Email can easily be spoofed so the true sender 
may never be known and mail servers from which the messages are sent can change 
rapidly, but the link the attacker wants a user to visit will change less frequently. By 
adding this type of intelligence to your tool set, you will be adding one more piece 
of information that will help you see when something bad goes wrong on your orga-
nizations network.
As mentioned before, knowing what IP addresses are operating as a proxy can be 
an important piece of intelligence information. There are free and open public block 
lists that are dedicated to tracking IP addresses that are being used for this purpose. 
Some lists track IP addresses that are purposefully operating as a proxy such as IPs 
that are on the onion routing (TOR) network, but there are also lists that actively go 
out and scan systems looking for those that are open proxies where the owner may 
not know they are being used to proxy network traffic. The use of this information 
can be invaluable, for example, knowing that an IDS attack is coming from a proxy’s 
IP address helps you validate the malicious intent of the traffic.
Phishing has become one of the most effective vectors for attackers these days. 
The way the attackers can entice a user to click a link to open an email attachment is 
nothing short of genius. We as security professionals have to hand it to our adviso-
ries, they really do their homework and have studied our users, their habits, and what 
will get unsuspecting users to click on something. I mean, why play the lottery when 
there is a general in Nigeria hiding from political prosecution that we can help out for 
a few million bucks, that is worth it, do not you think? Or how about those loveable 
cats, who can resist a few pictures of a few cute cats, I know I cannot. What about 
when our bank emails us to tell us there has been fraud on our account, are not we 
concerned about that? When I get those emails I click the link right away! But I am 
not looking to get what they want to give me, instead I want their malware, their do-
mains, their IP addresses and everything and anything I can get from their miserable 
attempt to compromise our organization’s users. There are several phishing databas-
es and working groups that can help you spot when a user is in trouble. But first you 
have to understand the problem we want to solve. Phishing is a simple-to-understand 
concept, but at the same time takes a complex technical execution to make it work. 
Phishing attacks use both social engineering and technical knowhow to achieve the 
attackers goals. Social-engineering schemes use “spoofed” e-mails to lead users to 
counterfeit websites designed to trick people into giving out information that they 
should not, such as company financial data, credit card numbers, account usernames, 
passwords, and social security numbers. You need to keep in mind that phishing is 
always a multi-stage attack. What I mean is that it does not stop with an email, it only 
starts with the email and then further advances via malware and then unfortunately 
attacker activity on the compromised system.

205
﻿ Blacklists
This is not your regular run of the mill spam. Phishing or even spear phishing 
(the practice of sending malicious emails to senior executives) takes finesse, skill, 
and a command of the language of the people that may be targeted. I say language 
because this is not specifically an American or English problem, instead, depending 
on who you are and where you are this may be a criminal problem, advanced persis-
tent threat, or a money-making venture for the attackers. So whether or not you are in 
the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Japan, Italy, or somewhere 
else that has money, you are a target. Years ago it was easy to spot spam or emails 
that contained viruses because the spelling of the worlds in the email was so horribly 
wrong that you would just delete it without a second thought. These days’ emails are 
“spoofed” to look like they are from people you know, they are written in the same 
voice or tone that you would expect and contain information in which you may be in-
terested. In some cases, the email accounts of your friends, coworkers, colleagues, or 
associates are compromised and used further to send out malicious emails to you as 
well as others. This is not like the viruses of old either where the virus automatically 
would send or email itself to the first 50 people in your contact list, but instead the 
attackers would handcraft these emails to users you may typically email but include 
malicious attachments of documents in which they may also be interested. This all 
makes spotting the bad messages much harder for the end users. So knowing all, this 
how would you stop it, slow it down, or detect when it is going on? That is something 
for your SOC to work on and is an invaluable service that you can offer the organiza-
tion that you serve.
Because email addresses can be changed and spoofed, the addresses themselves 
are not reliable … so blocking will not work. Even if you are sure that bad emails 
are coming from a specific address, that address is easily changed. Not only are these 
attributes easily changed, but they can be changed as frequently as each email so that 
you cannot spot a common pattern of these messages so you would be able to add to 
a rule to block them. But there is still hope, as we have discussed before, there is in-
telligence to which you can subscribe that may help open up a wealth of information 
that will help you spot this activity without using email attributes.
Going back to the example we had before, what if we knew the links that were 
bad and were being included in the emails that were being sent out? We can protect 
our users in several ways with this information. First we can block those domains 
and make sure that if a user goes to that URL or domain that it’s blocked. Second, 
when a user does go to that URL it sets off an alarm that the SOC can respond to and 
ensure that not only the access was blocked but that no harm came to the computer or 
the network. Then an investigation can take place to see what emails were sent that 
got the user to click and some internal intelligence can be gained and used to further 
strengthen the SOC’s tool sets.
Several open source intelligence databases are available to aid in this effort and 
can be used as real-time sources of information to either block users from accessing 
or to import into other tools such as your log management system to detect when a 
user clicks a link. But again, when you use this as a detection method it’s a lagging 
indicator, meaning the event already happened by the time the SOC gets to it so you 

206
CHAPTER 9  Intelligence
are in reactive mode. You job is then to only ensure that no harm came to the end 
user and that there are no other emails or events of significance for which you need 
to search. As stated before, the phishing is only the first part of the attack; if success-
ful, then you may see password dumping, privilege escalation, and eventually data 
exfiltration. Ultimately, your SOC has many opportunities to detect and prevent this 
type of activity and protect the network.
As a side note, this may differ from your experiences but as a rule you may want 
to use the number five as a magic number. What I mean is that when you are inves-
tigating attacks such as this, they rarely ever happen as a single instance. When you 
spot something, use the Rule of Five, which means that when one thing happens look 
for at least four more. You may find that with specific malicious emails they oper-
ate in campaigns of multiple victims of either a specific group of employees, all the 
people in one specific department, or several people who are part of a project team 
but otherwise are not associated inside a company. Once you are able to discover 
who, if any, are the other people in your organization receiving the same malicious 
email, then you may be able to draw a conclusion as to how the attacker got those 
email addresses. This information can then lead you to a completely different com-
promise of another system or data. Further, this also can help you develop some great 
indicators or internally generated intelligence information. For example, your SOC 
may be able to create a rule that when the same five people get the same email, send 
an alert for an analyst to investigate to see if it is indeed legitimate or another attack.
Certainly to fight this battle there is nothing more powerful, more effective and 
beneficial in the field of information security then user-based security awareness. 
Security professionals have fought this battle with users time and time, again but or-
ganizations struggle to secure their computers and networks while users fall prey to 
these phishing tactics. So, while technology and intelligence plays an important role 
in doing so, end user education is vital to securing your organization and you need to 
make sure your SOC is educating users at every opportunity it can.
I know that this is a chapter on intelligence, but this seems like a good time to 
mention user intelligence, meaning how do we make the user smarter. We have to 
face it at some point, because it’s not a matter of if we will be compromised by a 
phishing email, but rather when. When we talk about educating our users, we should 
not just focus on one specific area such as phishing, but rather give them a broad 
range of topics to think about that can help the organization become more secure. 
Topics that you may want to include are things like password safety and security, how 
to store passwords, not sharing passwords, and that tech support will never ask you 
for your password. Remember that social engineering does not always come in the 
form of email, but may be a phone call. Users are accustomed to multitasking, so you 
need to hammer in the concept that they are not to give out their password under any 
circumstance. Additionally, you obviously want to focus on email safety and giving 
them the tools to be able to detect current trends in phishing, scams, spam, abuse, and 
harassment types of email messages. You also may want to educate your users con-
sistently on your organization’s acceptable use policy. This will help users to under-
stand better the dos and don’ts of the organization and how to steer clear of trouble.

207
﻿ Blacklists
You can have too many resources in your SOC, but chances are that you will 
never have enough. In order to increase your effectiveness as a security organization, 
not only do you need to use effective intelligence as we are describing here, but also 
you need to employ your users to be an extension of your SOC and educate them on 
what to look for and how to properly escalate and report malicious behavior so that 
you can engage effectively and efficiently to prevent any damage to the organization.
Phishing intelligence is very broad and there are many lists to which you can 
subscribe that will give you very good information. There are even a few lists out 
there that are actually master lists that they include information from several lists in 
one easily formatted location. But, again, you have to think about how you are going 
to use these lists and what they means to you. In some cases, these lists will include 
the domain or the IP address where the hosted phishing site is located, but your web 
proxy vendor may already know that information and will very quickly block access 
to that site before your users go to that link. Is it enough for you silently to block that 
nugget of information? If it were my organization’s network, I would want to know 
that a user clicked on a bad link so that I can investigate how and why and if there are 
any other systemic issues I may need to address or remediate. So, your tools may be 
configured properly to block the link in a phishing email and your alert system may 
be configured properly to notify you when a link is clicked, but what you do next is 
really up to you. In the case of an efficient and mature SOC, I usually will want to 
run this to the ground, meaning that I will investigate it until I find the original email 
or website that was sent or viewed and all the users to whom the phishing email was 
sent. I say this is for mature a SOC only because new security organizations typi-
cally will not have time to chase down failed or blocked incidents and should focus 
on more specific threats that require immediate attention. If possible, I will work to 
get the offending email, extract all the attributes from the email, and create new rules 
that in the future may help me detect this same activity or block it from happening 
again.
With a bit of focus back on open source intelligence, there are a few lists that you 
can find out there that give you a lot of the information in an easily formatted way that 
includes multiple data sources combined into a single list. What this means is that 
there may be several lists out there, but some are masters that deduplicate entries, do-
mains, or subnets to give you a clean and efficient list that you can use for your tools.
Again, you do not want information just for the sake of information. You want to 
be efficient in the data that you collect and apply to your tools. As you collect more 
and more intelligence data, you will have to be very mindful not only of the false 
positive rate but also the sheer volume of information because your tools may not 
be able to handle the load. Ensuring you are not duplicating information or crating 
rules that max out your processing power will be a key to your success. As you look 
at generating lists that include phishing links you want to use, be certain you know 
what sub-lists they include and how they are gathering the information.
Although phishing may be your number one attack vector, it may not be your 
number one intelligence source or intelligence-based information to include in your 
tools. For years, we security practitioners have known some very obvious facts. 

208
CHAPTER 9  Intelligence
These are facts that are not able to change in the world of networking or the Internet. 
There are just some things that will always stay the same and the knowledge of these 
things can help us apply intelligence to our network defense systems and spot prob-
lem areas before they actually become a real problems. Sounds like something will 
really want to do right? Is it magic or is it reality?
BLACK LISTING PROJECTS
To further the discussion on open source intelligence, we can review a few more fo-
cused projects that collect IP address, domain names, or URLs of known bad actors. 
Some of these also are lists you may want to generate yourself, as well. What I mean 
is that if you can see this type of activity on your own organization’s network, then 
you can apply real-time actions in response to the activity and be proactive in your 
response, but also have it automated.
One such list that you may find out there captures and logs IP addresses that 
are seen performing brute force attacks. With the correct configuration and col-
lection of logs, this is also a list you may be able to create for yourself. If an IP 
address somewhere on the Internet is tying administrative SSH logins and you 
can learn that information before that IP address tries it on your network, then 
that list may be of value to you. A simple tool that you may use to see if this 
happens on your devices is Logwatch. This tool reviews all your local logs and 
generates an email that summarizes activity on the devices. The tool is also able 
to store that information locally as well, if you want to parse the data further and 
script it into something that you can use elsewhere, such as block rules for your 
firewall.
These logs may look something like this:
(As is in common practice the “x” in the IP addresses are to obfuscate the real IPs 
because this is for example purposes only)
SSHD authentication failures:
root (182.62.x.x) 1388 Time(s)
root (80.91.x.x) 965 Time(s)
root (121.8.x.x) 220 Time(s)
root (203.122.x.x) 180 Time(s)
If Logwatch is not something you wish to deploy or you would like to have a 
sampling of IP addresses that are broader than what you are seeing on your network, 
then you can find SSH blacklists that include this information. You may also find 
blacklists of IP addresses that are trying administrative windows logins as well. The 
honeypot network is once such place where you can find this information. An attack-
ing IP gets published on a blacklist, which is updated every few minutes and contains 
IP addresses of hosts that tried to brute force into any of the honeypots hosts. The 
honeypot hosts are located all around the world and are setup to report and log those 
attempts to a central database.

209
﻿ Other types of lists
Again, if you are able to automate blocking of these IP addresses on your net-
work, then this may be an extremely valuable exercise to try. In some cases, your 
organization’s SOC may not have permission to implement automated IP blocking 
or even have access to modify firewalls. In this case, correlating logs from multiple 
sources may be very important.
If you are have firewall logs and are able to detect these IP addresses making a 
successful connection to your organizations network and are able to match that at-
tempt up against a device log in your DMZ, then that may be something you want 
to know if the authentication is successful. A nice metric for later review may be a 
report showing the number of IP addresses from your list that attempted but failed 
to login, but also the total number of failed vs. successful (there should be none) 
login attempts. As mentioned in the metric chapter, this is a really valuable way to 
show how your SOC is implementing effective monitoring. Once the automation is 
in place, there should be no real effort to alert on successes and report on success and 
failure attempts on a regular basis.
By way of comparison to similar things that you may implement, typical instal-
lations of this type of list could see up to 7000 new IP addresses per hour become 
added. Because the number of IP addresses is so high, you may want to implement 
an expiration period where the IP address would automatically fall off of your list. I 
do not believe there is any hard and fast rule as to what is typical for how long you 
would want to keep using this data. Then, again, you will need to determine what the 
odds are that an IP address once seen performing a brute force attack of an adminis-
trative account across the Internet would no longer be a threat.
OTHER TYPES OF LISTS
If you believed that an IP address had done something bad in the past, maybe even 
the most recent past such as just a few seconds ago, would not you want to know 
about it? This is where intelligence can play a key role in your overall security strat-
egy. If you could have a lists of IP addresses that are likely to perform malicious be-
havior or have recently even been detected attempting SQL-injections attacks, DOS 
attacks, or any other confirmed type of behavior on someone else’s network, what 
would you do with that information? I know that if I have that information, I can 
monitor it, respond to it, and most importantly prevent it from causing a problem on 
my system. The information is out there and available and open to the public, all you 
have to do is search for it.
Those are just a few examples, and I bet you would love for me to call out a few 
specific examples and give you a few types of places that you can get a lot of this 
intelligence information from. I do not like to endorse a product, website, or tool, but 
also want to be as helpful and complete as possible. Because these sites are providing 
free open source intelligence information, mentioning them here is a simple way of 
saying “Thank You.” Again, as mentioned many times before, please evaluate this 
information for you own use. You may find it a great starting point, invaluable data, 

210
CHAPTER 9  Intelligence
or not for you. Any or all of the possibilities are fine because this includes free pub-
licly available websites that regularly publish trends and emerging threat informa-
tion. Organizations freely publish information for several reasons: For one, vendors 
publish security relevant information from their own products to help protect their 
customers, but also to help market the power of their products. This information 
includes announcements of security relevant patches or bugs and how to resolve 
those issues. Additionally, there are several organizations that like to publish limited 
general security intelligence to show off how their products work. Even though these 
are just small samples of intelligence, they can be incredible resources. There are 
many sites available with free IT security intelligence and here are a few examples 
to get you started:
• 
Atlas.arbor.com: Arbor has a product suite that actively monitors a customer’s 
network and can identify many different types of security related traffic. The 
Atlas site is a public resource that provides intelligence derived from its own 
sensor network, as well as opt-in customer networks that provide data on 
host/port scanning activity, zero-day exploits and worm propagation, security 
events, vulnerability disclosures, and dynamic botnet and phishing infrastructures.
• 
Senderbase.org: SenderBase is a website with data from Cisco’s IronPorts 
network that collects information on email traffic and gives a view into 
email-based security threats. Organizations can use this site to research 
reputation scores on specific domains or IP addresses or even use the top 100 
spammers report to block or report on spam email for their own organization.
• 
securityfocus.com: A community driven website that contains information on 
vulnerabilities, exploits, and emerging threats. It is also the home for BugTraq, 
where typically all new vulnerabilities are announced and discussed. There are 
also several mailing lists that you can join that contain a wide array of security 
topics to keep your SOC up to date on security issues.
• 
ThreatExpert.com: This site gives you the ability to post suspicious files and 
have them analyzed to obtain a report if the files are a computer viruses, worm, 
trojan, adware, spyware, and other security-related risks in a fully automated 
way. The site also provides interesting reports on other samples and is a good 
resource when looking for intelligence to add to your systems.
• 
Spamhaus.org: Spamhaus is a non-profit organization that has been around for 
many years and includes several spam lists and blacklists. I highly recommend 
you visit this site and review the many lists it has to determine how you 
may benefit from its information. Specifically, its XBL list contains good 
information on known IP addresses performing exploits in real-time.
ORGANIZATIONS AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS
Paid-for and purchased intelligence services can be a bit more focused and tailored 
to your organization and even provide you relevant information regarding security 
issues and attacks across your industry. More specifically, these types of services 

211
﻿ Organizations and industry partners
can help you monitor your name and brand on the Internet. If your organization is 
worried about unauthorized use of your brand in domain names or phishing emails, 
paid-for intelligence services can help by monitoring for this type of activity and 
alerting you to any issues. They also can watch for unauthorized disclosures of cor-
porate information in blogs, message boards, social networking, and other online 
areas and alert you before any damage can occur. Additionally, some of the paid-for 
intelligence services, like the open source services, can provide advanced informa-
tion regarding IP addresses of known bad servers, websites, or where malware is 
being stored on the Internet so that you can configure your tools to keep users away 
from those places.
Other paid-for services may give you much more details that just IP addresses. 
Depending on the intelligence you are looking for, these services can provide you 
in-depth analysis on attacker groups and help you understand who these people are 
that are attacking your networks and what they seek. By understanding a bit about 
these groups, you can further asses the risk you have, ensure your security systems 
are deployed in the right place to protect against the areas they want to attack, and, 
if their habits change, your paid-for intelligence service may be able to provide you 
with that information as well.
These services also work very hard to provide real value in the intelligence 
they are selling. Some companies perform reverse engineering on malware and 
gain very detailed understandings of what the malware is designed to do, how it’s 
doing it, and in some cases who programed it. This detailed intelligence informa-
tion is key to finding and remediating threats such as the advanced persistent threat 
(APT). APT is the name typically given to very skillful, well-funded, and some-
times nation-state supported attackers. The groups that make up APT understand 
technology very well, they understand their target very well, and they also under-
stand how to circumvent security controls and avoid detection. This is largely due 
to the fact that APT uses all the same tools your organization uses, except instead 
of using all those security tools to protect their network, they use them to test out 
all their attack tools and ensure they can sneak in to your network undetected. 
Furthermore, they know how to beat most all antivirus tools. Because of this, it is 
very important that when you find any evidence of APT activity or APT malware 
that you analyze it as fully as possible. These paid-for intelligence services can 
do that for you, but can also share information with you regarding other types of 
APT attacks and malware they have seen. They can provide you information that 
not only contains MD5 hashes of files, but what windows registry keys typically 
get changed or added. They may be able to tell you what to look for in running 
memory of a system that is exhibiting odd behavior. Other valuable information 
they may be able to provide include services, ports that may be running on a com-
promised systems, or even what special strings in packets a system may be sending 
to remote C2 servers. So, for example, an intelligence service may be able to give 
you all the relevant components of a post-attack analysis and attribution informa-
tion. This could be explained through a series of indications that match up to a 
certain group.

CHAPTER 9  Intelligence
So, if a particular registry key is changed while at the same time a new service 
is running on a precise port number and is sending a string of “A(j@@7” to what 
would seem like random IP addresses or domains on the Internet, then this is known 
as an “xyz attack” and is attributable to “xyz gang.” Make sure that if you subscribe 
to any of these services, your SOC has the right tools in place to use the information 
and find the bad guys on your organization’s infrastructure.
Industry organizations are arguably one of the best places for security intel-
ligence. It has been shown repeatedly that security attacks across an industry 
usually have the same or very similar characteristics. By sharing security in-
formation with partners and competitors, you can see very quickly who or what 
is targeting your industry and use that information to see if you have also been 
targeted and use that information to configure your tools to prevent those at-
tacks from being successful. An organization such as an Information Sharing 
and Analysis Centers (ISAC) is a great place to participate and share. A review 
of the National Council of ISAC1 will help you learn if there is an organization 
out there for you and should help to put you in touch with the right people to 
begin. Constant participation by industry organizations allows for the gathering 
of reliable and timely security intelligence information from industry partners, 
but also other organizations that may have been invited to join the community 
such as commercial security firms, government agencies, law enforcement, and 
other trusted resources. Typically in these types of organizations, information 
is not just one way; they operate quickly to disseminate threat alerts and other 
critical information to you as a member. The information often not only includes 
IP addresses and malware analysis, but can also include recommended solutions 
and protections from leading security experts in your industry. These organiza-
tions are built on trust and are very careful to not expose individual organizations 
information publicly or attribute information to a single entity in any way. The 
generic sharing of information is based on trust. Normally, industry members 
of these information-sharing organizations will sign non-disclosure agreements 
(NDA) with each other. The NDAs help to enforce rules, such as all sharing by 
default is non-attribution and cannot be shared outside of the sharing organiza-
tion without permission from the original data owner. These organizations also 
will have standardized and reliable procedures for submitting and distributing 
information and will even regularly exercise critical notification processes to en-
sure everything is working.
If there are no industry groups that appear to match up with your business, you 
can also look at participating with a local chapter of ISACA. These are local groups 
usually sponsored by or run by the local or regional branch of the FBI. Depending 
on your area, you will see different levels of value in this group, but it can never hurt 
to partner with a law enforcement agency that thrives on the collection and analysis 
of intelligence data.

﻿ Proactive activity monitoring
PROACTIVE ACTIVITY MONITORING
Security intelligence information is a critical ingredient to the SOC and invaluable 
in the efforts to protect your organization’s network. The SOC needs to work hard 
to know what is “normal,” whether network traffic is normal or not, and what the 
“normal” processes and files are on an end-user computer. A network, its configura-
tion, traffic patterns, and the hosts that reside on it need to be as quiet and stable as 
possible. Similar to how ballistic gel works, when something goes wrong, the SOC 
needs to be able to see clearly into what happened and determine all the attributes 
necessary to make an assessment on its threat and risk to the organization. Although 
user monitoring does not appear like intelligence, information it can be the most ef-
fective key to alerting your SOC that something just went horribly wrong. Similar 
to the lists of IP addresses discussed previously, a list of system administrators or 
privileged accounts on your organization’s network is critical. If you are able to use 
that information against administrative functions being performed on the network, 
you will be able quickly to see problems. For example, when a user with administra-
tive permissions logs into a system that houses users account information, that oc-
currence can be matched up with your administrative user account list to ensure that 
user is on the administrative-permissions list. If they are not on the list, then either an 
attacker got onto a system and was able to elevate the user permissions or someone 
else gave an employee administrative permissions when they should not have. Of 
course, if it is a legitimate employee then it is less of an issue, but can still be a viola-
tion of security procedures or policy and in any case would be important to detect.
I bring these examples up now because all along we have been discussing the 
type of intelligence you can get from outside sources that are in the form of distinct 
data elements that you can use to find indications of malicious activity. But that does 
not always need to be the case. In many instances, intelligence can be in the form 
of logical rules that help detect behavior indicative of malicious behavior. Build-
ing intelligent rules may be your best defense; nobody is going to give you a list of 
900,000 IP addresses that just participated in the last distributed denial of service 
attack (DDOS). Instead, an intelligence rule that can detect what a DDOS looks like 
on the firewall allows you to spot trouble the second it happens and respond to ap-
propriately. In the SOC world, or security world, for that matter, real-time detection 
and appropriate response are activities we live by. It is impossible to think that the 
SOC can stop all attacks or even stop all successful attacks. Sometimes the best we 
can hope for is to see a successful attack and be able to respond to it quickly and 
avoid any residual negative effect of the attack such as data loss.
If you are at the phase of maturity in building your SOC where you are active in 
these intelligence organizations and are leveraging the information you are receiv-
ing, you should have a realization that you will never build a big enough SOC to 
combat the enemy. By participating in consistent collection of reliable intelligence 
from a range of free and paid subscriptions; and government, industry, and internal 
sources will allow you effectively to create a force multiplier for your organization. 
It will give you a more complete picture of what your advisories are doing, what their 

214
CHAPTER 9  Intelligence
motivations may be and you will be able to categorize their activities. Focusing on 
these areas will allow you to fuse the information together in order to develop action-
able intelligence from all these sources and then feed it back into your tools. This 
will keep you focused, fresh, and make you as proactive as you can be and allow you 
to be more precise in your defense in depth strategies against any evolving threats. 
Lastly, you will see your overall security improve at a more cost-effective rate.

Summary�����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������241
Outsourcing is an interesting discussion topic as there are many different aspects 
and opinions on it. Certainly contracting to a third party to perform some business 
function is not new and neither is IT outsourcing, and outsourcing security has been 
around for a little while as well but that does not mean outsourcing vendors have

CHAPTER 10  Outsourcing
worked out all the kinks to be able to support all the businesses of the world. For 
people that have never outsourced, there can be a huge barrier to trying it and an even 
bigger challenge trying it with their IT security. For those that are more comfortable 
with outsourcing and have had success with it before will ultimately find it easier to 
transition security functions to an outsourcer but that does not ensure success. In this 
chapter, we are going to discuss what outsourcing security operations looks like, its 
challenges as well as its benefits but we are also going to make comparisons with 
building it on your own and keeping the functions in-house and what the success fac-
tors are of each. Although it may seem that when you outsource you are relinquishing 
the burden of security to a third party but keep in mind that if there is a significant 
compromise or a material breach the impact is not at the third party, it is still at your 
organization and you will be effected. Therefore, you really need to think about what 
you are doing and what your goals are. Whether or not you are building a SOC in-
ternally, going to outsource or some hybrid variation, you should make sure you are 
comfortable with your goals and the success criteria you are going to use for either 
situation.
First, let us define what outsourcing security operations mean so that we are on 
the same page because there are a lot of different names and understandings. We 
have to make sure that when we look at outsourcing operations we are not mixing it 
up with other functions.
A company that offers security services may also offer what is called MSS, this 
makes that company a provider of MSS or what is known as a MSSP. Security opera-
tions outsourcing is not the management of a device or specific consulting services. 
So, for example, although a company may offer MSS, if all you purchase from them 
is an external penetration or vulnerability test then you are not outsourcing your 
operations, you are just purchasing a single service or what is sometimes called a 
professional service. In the definition of outsourcing operations that we use here, to 
an MSSP you must contract with the company to provide at a minimum, ongoing 
operational functions such as tier 1 or 2 security analysis along with the additional 
possibility for management of your internal IDS, firewalls, antivirus or any other 
security relevant devices in an operational function. There are a lot of ways to slice 
and dice operations and you can contract with an MSSP for almost any portion of 
your operations. From remote perimeter management and security monitoring with 
incident response to penetration testing and ongoing vulnerability management with 
system patching. This can also include added value services like fraud detection, 
intelligence services and more.
There are a number of very significant advantages to outsourcing your security 
to an MSSP. The advantages are so significant that you really need to think twice 
about building a SOC yourself. But of course if it were so easy to just outsource 
all this security stuff I would not have too much to write about in this book. After 
being on both sides of the equation, meaning running large MSSPs and buying 
services from them, I can tell you that in order for you and the MSSP to be suc-
cessful you have to have some level of responsibility for security inside your own 
organization and be a good partner with the MSSP all at the same time. It is not 

217
﻿ Types of MSSPs
realistic to think you can turn all security functions over to an external company 
and be done with it unless you are going to contract for services to be internal to 
your organization as well. That does not mean you still need to have a full blown 
internal SOC but you still will need some level of internal security functions and 
the balance of what you need will be dependent on what you outsource, how 
secure your organization needs to be and how sensitive you are to combating 
security treats.
TYPES OF MSSPs
There are several types of MSSPs that you can choose from and the specific kind will 
depend on your overall technology strategy, your financial situation, and your toler-
ance for risk. Because there are different types of MSSPs, there may be significant 
advantages of one over the other just in how they deliver their services. For example, 
some communications providers may be able to provide managed security in the 
cloud before issues even get to your network. Need more visibility then you may 
want a more hands on approach using your own equipment but want external experts 
to manage them.
STRATEGIC PARTNERS
In the case of strategic partners, your organization may already have an established 
relationship with an outsourcer or provider of professional services in the IT industry. 
This provider may already have a good working relationship with your compa-
ny or organization and can provided some of the managed security services you  
are looking for. This can make things really easy since you are already using their 
services and have experience with them then it is just a matter of adding to what is 
already there. Keep in mind that since this type of MSSP is involved in other areas, 
their security service may not be as strong as other services they provide. They may 
employ some key experts and do a great job but their breadth of services and capa-
bilities may not fully match with what you need. This does not mean you should shy 
away from using them, just make sure you understand what you need opposed to 
what they can provide.
PURE PLAY PROVIDERS
For a pure play provider, security is all they do. They live and breathe security ser-
vices and are constantly looking for new and innovative ways to provide their ser-
vices or enhance their capabilities. Security is definitely their core competency and 
the price of their service may reflect that. If you are looking for a complete turnkey 
solution to manage your security and reduce your risk, then look at these types of 
providers. Chances are they will provide much more than you could over hope for to 
protect your interests.

218
CHAPTER 10  Outsourcing
BOUTIQUE PROVIDERS
Smaller MSSPs that look to fill very special market gaps are great to look at if you 
are concerned with very specific issues. You could find MSSPs for example that just 
manage endpoint security, this is especially useful if you have having problems with 
data loss, users and overall patching of systems. Use these types of providers as stra-
tegic tools to solve a specific problem but do not be upset when they will not scale as 
you grow or be able to provide other services you may need or want.
Later we will discuss other factors that differentiate different MSSPs that you 
will have to choose from. Ultimately you need to make sure that the provider you 
pick will perform the services you want, the way you want them, and that they are a 
good cultural fit for your organization.
Here is a quick chart detailing some of the services you may be able to contract 
with an MSSP for, these are a security focus as there may be many other services that 
are offered but may be more IT specific:

ADVANTAGES OF MSSP OUTSOURCING
MSSP SOC in action
7:35 p.m. EST, all is quiet. The only sounds are the whirls of computer fans, a faint 
hum of a video projector, and someone quietly tapping on a keyboard. The blue 
glow of computer screens in contrast to the backdrop of 8-ft video walls displayed 
up and down rows of the security operations center is the only real lighting in the 
room. It is peaceful and quite, almost makes you want to put your feet up and take 
a nap.
7:36 p.m. EST, an event comes in to the SOC ticketing system labeled critical. A 
tier-1 analyst looks at the event and sees that it is an alarm from a customer’s firewall 
that was correlated by the SOC’s threat engine and details a security event that shows 
the device just processed 10,000 drops. Subsequent events start to come in, all with 
the same information, 10,000 then 50,000, then 100,000 and more.
The tier-1 analyst quickly notifies the senior engineer on duty that a potential 
denial of service is taking place on a customer’s network. The engineer then looks at 
the data the analyst provided and immediately confirms the findings. The engineer 
then engages a SOC communication analyst to notify the customer and open a criti-
cal phone bridge. The communication analyst then sends out the details of the phone 
bridge to the customer, SOC management and the security intelligence engineers on 
staff. Meanwhile, details of the event are passed on to all the rest of the tier-1 ana-
lysts in the SOC to be on the lookout for similar activity at other customers and an 
immediate performance impact assessment is taken.
Security engineers analyze network traffic and with the help of a security intel-
ligence engineer they apply signatures down to the customers network to block the 
known attack vectors. As the actions are being performed the communication analyst 
verbalizes the actions on the phone bridge and relays any customer-determined im-
pact to the SOC team.
Then on behalf of the customer, the SOC engineer engages the customers Internet 
provider and alerts their network operations center of the ongoing activity. The SOC 
and the provider monitor the attack and any changes due to the mitigations the SOC 
put in place. Noticing changes in the behavior of the attack, the provider works to 

220
CHAPTER 10  Outsourcing
reroute the customer network traffic while the SOC deploys new signatures to block 
the changes in attack patterns.
7:42 p.m. EST, No additional events populating into the SOC ticketing system 
regarding this event.
Monitoring statistics, visual charts and graphs detailing the health of the custom-
ers network returns to normal.
Customer confirmed that no service impact or outage was detected onsite. Com-
munication analyst updated ticket entries on the customer’s portal.
SOC management reviewed all the details of the events, actions performed and 
issued a general watch alert to all analysts for increased attack activity.
7:43 p.m. EST, all is quiet
The above was a simple review of what happens over and over again inside an 
MSSP’s SOC. This type of activity usually can happen very quickly and depending 
on how large the MSSP is and how many services and customers they manage, this 
can happen not only several times an hour but multiple events like this can be, and 
typically do happen at the same time. An MSSP is designed to deal with these types 
of events on a regular basis and it is the norm for them. They are staffed with fully 
trained and qualified people who can react properly under stressful situations and 
have a great deal of experience in handling all types of security events effectively 
and efficiently.
COST
Building a SOC can be expensive and if your organization does not have the capabil-
ity or capacity to make capital expenses or to hire new resources then cost becomes 
a significant factor in deciding to outsource to an MSSP. Depending on the services 
that you are going to outsource, the MSSP may come with their own equipment so 
you will not have to purchase anything. All the software licensing, equipment costs, 
and even most if not all the setup and configuration of everything may be included 
in the monthly charge of the service you are contracting for. Additionally, as we 
previously discussed, the need for investment in a SIEM system is critical for a suc-
cessful operation. These systems most often do not come cheap and typically require 
significant hardware, software and specialized skill sets to manage and maintain. 
Outsourcing to an MSSP may elevate the need for the purchase of an internal infra-
structure of SIEM as the MSSP can collect your logs and do it all for you as part of 
the service.
If your organization is not IT centric then you will need to hire new people to 
setup, manage, maintain and monitor in your internal SOC if you do not outsource. 
Depending on the goals of your security and risk program this can be a significant 
number of new hires. Not only do you need to hire new people but you will also 
need to keep them trained like we spoke about in the chapter on training. An MSSP 
brings an established core of people to the table, most all of them will have or will 
be in the process of getting professional security industry certifications. They have 

221
﻿ Advantages of MSSP outsourcing
established training programs for their staff and they have programs to keep their 
people up to date and current on emerging threat trends. In some cases, the staff at an 
MSSP can be so good at managing equipment that product vendors look to hire them 
away from MSSPs due to not only their knowledge of the equipment but also their 
practical experience of managing large volumes of devices in enterprise production 
environments.
Do not forget that when you are looking at security monitoring and management 
that it is a 24/7 job. Not only do you have to have the right resources, tools, and staff 
but you need to have them available and engaged around the clock to support your 
operation. Failures in IT infrastructure can happen at any time and security tools and 
technology are no different. In the case of your security tools, if they go down you 
may lose significant visibility into what is going on in your network and be blind to 
a potential breach.
ORGANIZATIONAL
Internal IT departments and SOCs inside large enterprises may not play well to-
gether. This is important when you are looking at trying to perform security analy-
sis across multiple technologies that may be managed by different departments in 
your organization. In order to get a clear picture of security, you need to be able to 
combine all your security relevant technology into a security event management 
ecosystem as we previously discussed. This system will normalize, aggregate, and 
correlate information to produce the essential security information and operation 
needs to effectively monitor a network. If your organization has one team supporting 
firewalls, another supporting network IDS and yet another supporting application 
or host based security tools then your monitoring may be fractured. Not only is it 
fractured but also piecing it all together to investigate an attack or even monitor a 
potential event in real time will be an incredibly difficult task. An MSSP can help 
break down certain barriers in this situation by working with the various groups, 
teams, and departments to collect the needed security relevant information and bring 
it all back to their analysis tools for processing. Additionally an MSSP may be able 
to break down political barriers by providing services not just for the security de-
partment but for other IT groups as well. They may be able to provide professional 
services and consulting work in many different technical areas. This becomes a win-
ning situation for all concerned where everyone can benefit from the relationship in 
one way or another.
ENHANCED CAPABILITIES
MSSPs work with many customers, some of the customers may even be in the same 
industry as yours. This can be a significant advantage for outsourcing your security, 
as the MSSP should be able to leverage security intelligence knowledge across the 
same or similar industries to yours. So, if there are specific attacks targeting one 
company in your industry it stands to reason that the attacks may be seen at other 

222
CHAPTER 10  Outsourcing
companies as well. If the MSSP is postured properly and have mature intelligence 
services then they should be able to spot these emerging trends and apply detection 
or protection mechanisms for your company ahead of the threat or extremely quickly 
in response. Not only should an MSSP be able to leverage industry threat informa-
tion but if they have enough customers in a specific industry they can participate in 
industry information sharing programs which enable them to apply protections in 
your outsourced services even more often and with greater efficiency. This does not 
have to be just and industry specific focus, in that if there is a threat no matter where 
it is discovered the MSSP services should be able to apply some kind of detection 
or protections to your network for that specific discovered threat. This can help an 
MSSP leverage the intelligence information for vertical markets and make them ex-
perts in that specific industry.
These vertical specialties could range from government, energy, and critical in-
frastructure, to pharmaceutical, healthcare, retail, finance, or more. An MSSP may 
be able to specialize in several industries at once depending on their operational size, 
focus and their ability to gather intelligence to learn what is important to each.
SLA
Properly responding to an alarm and deciding that a specific even warrants a deeper 
analysis is extremely time sensitive. It is so time sensitive that it could make the 
difference between one system infected with malware opposed to 300 systems com-
promised with APT tool sets and potential data loss. Because of this time sensitivity 
MSSPs can offer you SLA that dictate how they are going to provide the service to 
you. Initially you should see some SLAs around the provisioning of services, deploy-
ment of any equipment and documentation. Next you should see SLAs around how 
they are going to perform the service and around how they will respond to events and 
what the level of effort they are going to put forward to get resolution to those events. 
Depending on the level and type of service you subscribe to there can be many dif-
ferent types of SLAs offered by your MSSP.
SLAs are a nice benefit to outsourcing your security to an MSSP, again, it is not 
a consolation prize if something goes wrong but it is nice to know the company is on 
the hook to perform at a level you are comfortable with. SLAs do not all have to be 
time based, they can also dictate a specific process that they need to follow such as an 
escalation process or it could be the frequency of updates they will apply to a system.
When you begin working with an MSSP, ensure you establish well-defined and 
understood SLAs. These SLAs should be understood from a contracted perspective 
as well as realistic perspective. What I mean by that is if you are told that all incidents 
will be responded to in 4 h be aware that this may not be an SLA. The contracted 
SLA may be that they will respond in 24 h but will make a best effort to try and 
respond in the first 4. You should also know what “responding” means, I know that 
sounds silly but responding could be an automated response or a human analyst re-
sponse. Another ambiguous example of where you may need to further define or un-
derstand an SLA is one that states a “100%” guarantee, so if your MSSP is patching 

223
﻿ Advantages of MSSP outsourcing
your systems, they may say that they guarantee 100% compliance with patching for 
all managed systems within 30 days of patch availability. But, reading the fine print 
you may find that 100% accounts for unreachable systems, failed patching systems 
or systems in some funky state. So 100% may really be 70% with justifications up to 
100%. Make sure your expectations are being met and that you are going to get what 
you think you are paying for.
Once you fully understand the SLAs and you are comfortable with all of them, 
the next step for you to do is to figure out how all the SLAs are going to be measured. 
Some MSSPs may have this all done already for you when it comes to their standard 
SLAs but if you agree to establish anything custom then you need to make sure you 
and the MSSP also agree on how to measure the SLA compliance. Last but not least, 
you should know what the process is when SLAs are missed, meaning what the 
escalation plans and paths are for you to take action and enforce compliance with 
the SLAs. When dealing with your security being outsourced do not let them off the 
hook, they need to be responsive because that is what you are paying them for, hold 
them accountable to the SLA.
This is not really like a company’s internal SLA, these agreements are hard pa-
rameters that could have serious consequences for being missed. Although it is not 
consolation prize if something bad happens, the SLAs contracted in your relationship 
with an MSSP may provide you with service credits or even significant monetary 
fines for the MSSP failing to meet those agreements. What I mean is that it is not 
great to have an MSSP refund you a measly $10 or event $1000 for being late in 
responding to an alert that unauthorized data was potentially leaving your network. 
I personally would just rather have them be responsive and meet all their contracted 
obligations. To add a bit more teeth, SLAs could even include additional monetary 
penalties above service credits for the MSSP in that they could have to pay recover 
fees for any losses as a result their missing of the SLA, this could be a situation that 
is similar to cyber insurance.
DOCUMENTATION
Since MSSPs are typically mature operations with large numbers of customers, 
there are a few things you should expect when working with them. These are not 
necessarily things that you cannot get from your own internal SOC but an MSSP 
should be able to start giving them to you day one of your service whereas your 
internal SOC may not see these as priorities and may take a long time to develop.
First, a MSSPs service is usually designed with an outward interface to interact 
intelligently with their customers. A web portal provided by your MSSP is a great 
resource for you and for the MSSP. Your account should give you visibility into all 
your services and let you interact with the company on various levels. For example, 
if you are using an MSSP for log management services then you should be able to 
access your logs and have a robust interface for searching those logs and generating 
reports. Additionally you should be able to see all your MSSP generated tickets and 
inside those tickets you should be able to see the log entries that not only you have 

224
CHAPTER 10  Outsourcing
made but all the entries of the analysts in the MSSP’s SOC that include their analysis 
and conclusions of the event that generated the ticket.
All of this information should be documented and the MSSP should even provide 
your organization training on how to use their tools, work their processes and get the 
best possible service.
MSSPs will typically have a very well established run book that includes all 
the steps they go through in responding to a wide variety of different events. These 
processes are typically well thought out, tested and executed with relative ease by 
the MSSP. Additionally, since MSSPs do typically have larger numbers of skilled 
security resources then most enterprises, it puts them in a good position to work with 
your organization in either developing your internal security policies or revising your 
existing ones to match your security needs and goals. Do not be afraid to ask your 
MSSP to review internal processes with you and to help educate you on how they 
do things. The more you know about how they do things and what they do the more 
you will be able to take better advantage of the services they offer and you will build 
a better relationship.
MSSPs will also have a good documentation regarding their security policies and 
procedures. These will be comprehensive documents that are periodically reviewed 
and updated as well as enforced. You should be able to review this information to 
make sure they are compatible or exceed your own.
DISADVANTAGES TO MSSP OUTSOURCING
As much as MSSPs hate to admit it, there are a number of disadvantages to outsourc-
ing and you will need to carefully consider the importance of each one to your orga-
nization. Of course there are pros and cons to everything but when you are looking to 
trust such a sensitive and important function to your organization to a third party you 
should not go into the relationship lightly. As I stated before, you need to make sure 
you understand the goals and requirements of your security program well in order to 
evaluate if an MSSP relationship is right for you.
LARGE NUMBERS OF CUSTOMERS
As was discussed before, it makes sense that an MSSP would have a large customer 
base. Some MSSPs have more customers than others and some have larger enter-
prises than others. An organization benefits from having an MSSP with a strong 
customer base with its ability to leverage intelligence from that customer base but 
at the same time there comes a strong disadvantage. Because MSSPs do have many 
customers it is very difficult for the MSSP to have intimate knowledge of a single 
customer’s network and infrastructure. This is a significant disadvantage because 
without that knowledge it is difficult for an MSSP to perform effective analysis of 
events. For example, if there was an attack and the log of the event had an internal IP 
address on your network an MSSP SOC may deem the event a false positive because 
that type of attack is only effective on the external side of an organizations network. 

225
﻿ Disadvantages to MSSP outsourcing
An analyst at an MSSP may fail to properly analyze this event because of their in-
ability to know how every customers network is built. In the case of an internal IP, 
although the MSSP SOC is correct in their analysis of the event being only effec-
tive externally, because they are not as intimately familiar with each organizations 
network they may overlook the fact that the target system in this scenario is on the 
external side of the network but has network address translation on the inside and 
it was the inside intrusion detection system that kicked off the initial alarm. MSSPs 
have worked hard to resolve these issues by making sure they have good knowledge 
bases and ticketing systems to help their analysts but the reality is that on average 
an analyst in the SOC of an MSSP may work 50 tickets a shift and each one may be 
from a different company. That type of volume is just going to make it very hard for 
analyst to get real familiar with any customers network.
LACK OF DEDICATED RESOURCES
You may be a small fish in a big pond, meaning that you are using shared resources 
when working with an MSSP. So, in the case of a crisis where multiple customers 
in an industry, region or with a specific technology are affected, you may not get the 
attention you want when the company that has a contract worth 100 times what yours 
is wants something first. Although MSSPs work hard to provide personal service to 
each and every customer, unless you are large enough or pay enough, you are not 
going to get dedicated support when those issues occur. On that note, you have to 
remember that MSSPs are a business so they are going to do things as profitable and 
as efficient as possible. What this means is that their services may not be flexible 
enough to match your exact needs or may not be able to scale up enough to meet your 
demands at your time of critical need. You have to make sure that the service you 
are going to get from them will meet your expectations. MSSPs will try to present 
a custom tailored service as much as possible but in the end they need to stack their 
service high and deep and have as much of a repetitive service as possible to be prof-
itable. If you have a clear goal in mind and you select the right MSSP who understand 
the detailed specifics your goals and can they accommodate your needs contractually 
then you will have a winning relationship. Draw too far outside the lines of their 
service offerings and you are going to have some trouble. MSSPs are great for pro-
viding standard security services but providing custom security solutions to just your 
business will not scale properly in most organizations. So, in order to effectively use 
an MSSP, make sure that you are purchasing standard services with realistic expecta-
tions and then look to perform more of your custom programs either in-house with 
your own SOC or security team or with other consulting firms and/or contractors.
DATA STORAGE ISSUES
When we typically think about data storage, most of us can recall how limited stor-
age was in the past and how large and inexpensive storage media has become. But 
when looking at large enterprise data storage systems that collect millions of events 

226
CHAPTER 10  Outsourcing
per day and need to be online and available for audit purposed typically for a year 
or more the storage requirements start to become massive in size. Then add in the 
fact that MSSPs need to store all this data for possibly hundreds of clients the issues 
become as large as the data itself, and the when you start to think about backups and 
redundancy it could be a nightmare. Many MSSPs have addressed issues with large 
or what some people call big data, they have addressed it by adding costs to service. 
What I mean is that some MSSPs require that you send your logs to their central 
logging facility. This is how they perform correlation, aggregation, and eventually 
ticketing security issues to alert you on. Normally this should not be a problem, but 
if that log data can potentially carry protected information such as payment card 
transaction information, personal identifiable information, controlled unclassified in-
formation, or other intellectual property then you start to have an even larger mess on 
your hands. Further, most MSSPs will have multiple processing centers and multiple 
data storage and back-up facilities. This can cause problems if those locations are not 
in a country that meets your regulatory or government requirements for the protec-
tion of that information. To resolve this some MSSPs may be able to control the loca-
tion of your data but it will come at a premium price. Further you should be aware 
that most if not all MSSPs will not store all your data indefinitely for free. Instead 
they will only store your data for a short period of time before its purged unless of 
course you pay extra for longer storage. Also, be careful of data size limits, an MSSP 
may charge you for the amount of data you send them as well.
This leads us into a quick discussion on what the costs of working with an MSSP 
could be.
COSTS
It is very difficult for me to give you any kind of real cost numbers associated with 
working with an MSSP. These numbers can change greatly depending on what you 
are looking to purchase, the terms of the contract and your relationship with the 
vendor. They will most always work with you to size and scope the service and  
try to give you the best deal they can based on your needs, the devices you want 
monitored/managed and the levels of service you are looking for. In some cases, an 
MSSP may charge you per device, this is great if you are small and have only one 
firewall but bad if you are large and have several thousand firewalls. There may be 
Internet bandwidth charges for you to send them logs, so not only do you have to 
pay for the bandwidth leaving your network but you may also have to pay band-
width charges for logs entering your provider’s networks. Bandwidth charges may 
be good if there are no device charges, this way if you have many IDS but they are 
fairly quite and properly tuned and do not produce many alarms then this may be 
cheaper for you. Then there is the data storage charge like we spoke about above. 
Depending on if you need 1 month of logs available online and a year off-line or 
a 1 year online and 10 years off-line or online forever, I am sure there is a pricing 
model just for you.

227
﻿ Disadvantages to MSSP outsourcing
Threat intelligence is much of the same way, there are multiple flavors, versions, 
and services that you can choose from. Depending on what you need or what you 
want to add onto your MSSP contract may also greatly affect your price. You can 
almost certainly choose between vulnerability feeds that give you instant notifica-
tion when a vendor you are interested in publicly announces patch or security flaw. 
Then there are threat feeds and advisory feeds that help keep you informed on the 
latest trends or potential threats to your system. Further an MSSP may charge you 
to participate in live monthly webinars that discuss vulnerabilities, current risks and 
emerging trends. Then there are vertical threat intelligence services that you can 
leverage from your industry partners or equipment providers through the MSSP. All 
of these can be very valuable services but they can come at a cost that may make you 
think twice about signing up with an MSSP especially if cost was what made you 
look at outsourcing to begin with instead of doing a SOC in-house.
QUALITY OF WORK AND STAFFING
When building any security operations center you want to make it as effective and 
as efficient as possible. Therefore you are going to make decisions that prevent 
SOC personnel from performing needless functions and allow them to focus on 
core tasks that give the organization the best bang for the buck. This is all well and 
good if you own an internal SOC, but at an MSSP, it is a bit of a different story. 
The MSSP is going to squelch and tune customer logs and sensors so that they get 
what they believe is the sweet spot of signal to noise ratio. They understand very 
well that there is going to be a certain percentage of false positive tickets generated 
but they will work very hard to reduce that as much as possible. They do this so that 
they can perform more work for more customers and make more profit. What this 
means to you is that they may tune or turn off completely an IDS alert, log entry 
or other indicator of attack that they deem to be no threat, low threat or otherwise 
a waste of their time. Typically an MSSP will do this across all their customers or 
with sections of customers depending on how their back end infrastructure is built. 
This matters because you are trusting them to make the right decision for your busi-
ness based on what is ultimately more profit for them. This is in no way malicious, 
it is just economies of scale for the business. To help combat these types of issues 
you need to engage with the MSSP and see if there is are ways you can be part of 
the change tree that gets notified about these types of things or if there is a technical 
customer advisory board that you can participate with that discusses these types of 
technical issues.
Quality of work may also suffer if the MSSP is struggling to manage their work-
load and is starved for resources. In this case, you may find tickets that have quality 
issues like missing information, wrong information, and so on. Some of this is fine 
as you cannot expect everyone to be perfect all the time but it can be cyclical in a 
MSSP. If there are significant changes in an MSSP SOC environment such as per-
sonnel churn over, infrastructure maintenance issues or just generally being short 
staffed for any one of many reasons.

228
CHAPTER 10  Outsourcing
Just like in any business a MSSP may have waves of employee turnover. Since 
security is a fairly active job market, anyone getting good quality training at an 
MSSP does have a fair number of job options out there. An MSSP has to work hard 
to retain their people, keep them happy and keep them engaged. Even if they are 
able to keep their people retained it still may impact customers. Because people get 
promoted or move on to other roles you can see a drop in work quality, mishandled 
ticket escalations, or any number of other quality issues.
Questions you need to ask a potential MSS provider
Although we just discussed pros and cons of working with an MSS provider, let us 
assume you decide to move forward and want to outsource. You have to make sure 
you are going to work with the right company. This is not simply signing up, hand-
shaking and away you go. There is a significant level of trust you need to have in the 
MSSP you are going to partner with and you need to make sure they are going to be 
able to get the job done or that you can hold them accountable for when they do not. 
Also, you need to be aware that even if you have a long-standing relationship with 
a company for other reasons and you are beginning to look at their MSSP service 
offerings, it does not mean that it will have the same level of quality or capabilities 
of their other businesses, this is due to the heavy mergers and acquisitions that go 
on in the Information Technology area and especially in Cyber security. In some 
cases where an MSSP was acquired, it may take several years for that business to be 
fully integrated with the larger parent. They may have different management, billing 
systems and a laundry list of other differences. Regardless, there are a number of 
questions or topics of conversation you should have with any potential MSSP to get a 
better idea on how they handle specific issues that may work with your requirements, 
culture, infrastructure, and philosophy of security.
So, you want to outsource? What are the questions you need to ask?
Where do you begin? There always seems to be a growing number of companies 
willing to provide security services. Then it seems that there are always a number of 
organizations being purchased by larger organizations, and then there are also orga-
nizations providing security services that may go out of business. This raises a lot of 
fears and a lot of questions that need to be answered, ultimately you need to find and 
select an organization that is going to partner with you and be there for you when 
an incident occurs. There are a lot of questions that come up that you need to have 
answered, these are questions that come from the business or may come from your IT 
department or may come from anywhere in the organization that may have concerns, 
issues, or just general questions regarding the hiring of a company to perform such 
a critical service. Understanding some of the more high-level questions you need to 
ask and filtering the answers in order to be able to reduce the number of potential 
outsource organizations to select from is a major task to be performed.
HOW THE SERVICES WILL BE DELIVERED
The first question you may want to ask is how they are going to provide the service 
you are contracting for. For example, are they going to provide any hardware or do 

229
﻿ How the services will be delivered
you have to make additional purchases per their specifications. You need to know 
how they are going to access your network or the resources they need in order to get 
the information they require to perform the proper service. You may need special 
firewall rules or need to understand the protocols they are going to use to connect 
to your devices. You may even have to restrict your network and not allow them to 
access the devices, in that case you need to figure out how they will get the data they 
need to perform the services you want them to. These are important issues that need 
to be well understood so that the MSSP can securely and successfully do their job 
and that there are no hidden infrastructure costs that you were not aware of. Also, 
you should find out if you will be assigned a dedicated engineer that will work with 
you to provision the services and any equipment needed. They should act as a project 
manager for you and help make sure that you have a smooth on boarding process. 
When you on board to an MSSP it should not just be a network connection and you 
start getting alerts. You need to engage with them fairly closely to make sure that any 
new equipment gets provisioned correctly or that any changes to existing equipment 
are fully vetted and well understood and that all changes are properly documented 
and approved by your change management board if you have one. You also need to 
ensure that your information properly gets loaded into any ticket or database systems 
the MSSP may have. This could include an asset database and a contact database or 
even an intelligence database. You need to also work with the SOC up front to ensure 
that they know who you are, what your IP address schemes are and what they need to 
do when there is an issue. Most MSSPs will have this process pretty nailed down and 
will load you up with all kinds of forms to fill out. Just be aware of who you have to 
deal with, what the processes are or any other odd things that you will need to do in 
order for them to provide you the best possible service.
PEOPLE
Next you want to make sure that the MSSP is using people above and beyond your 
standards to service your account. What I mean there is that you want to ensure 
that the company you are contracting with is using the same if not better standards 
to employ people than you do. This could include security clearances, background 
checks, credit checks or any other research that may be needed. Although difficult 
to protect against you want to ensure (to the best ability that you can) that there are 
not going to be any public leaks of information that may be seen on your network by 
the MSSP. Therefore you need to know about the hiring practices of the MSSP, do 
they require drug tests, do they only use citizens of the country you are contracting 
in, do they hold country government or military clearances and so on. Do not forget 
to find out if there are any suppliers, partners or resellers involved in either your re-
lationship with the MSSP or in how the MSSP provides the service as the personnel 
in those organizations may need to comply with your requirements or regulations 
as well. Anyone involved in the processes of providing MSS who may touch, see or 
interact with your data needs to be understood from all these perspectives to ensure 
you are working within the confines of your organizations requirements or even 
your customer’s requirements and commitments. As we discussed before, there may 

230
CHAPTER 10  Outsourcing
be a lot of moving around and turnover at an MSSP so you need to make sure they 
have and only bring in the highest caliber of people possible and that they will meet 
your requirements.
Then you need to ensure that once they have found those great people that they 
are all properly trained and kept current. In a previous chapter, we spent a con-
siderable amount of time discussing what it takes to train a SOC. When it comes 
to an MSSP, we should expect that the training of the staff to far exceed what we 
could ever hope to do in our own private SOCs. Do not be afraid to ask what kind 
of training they provide their staff on a regular basis and to see a list of credentials 
that their SOC members currently hold. Because all of the people that work in the 
SOC are in the security field, you should expect their certifications to be an over-
whelming list. But do not just stop at certifications, ask about other training like 
PCI or data handling processes, even ask about their new employee training. You 
should not expect issues and errors to happen just because there is a new employee 
or junior person on the job. Get a full view of what their knowledge level is in their 
SOC and what they do to keep everyone learning, make sure that there is ongoing 
education at your potential providers that will also include threat trends, new and 
emerging security research and that it is performed at a rate that is frequent enough 
to stay current.
SIZE VERSUS EXPERIENCE
Once you feel comfortable that they have adequate or even incredibly worthy people 
providing the service you want, the next thing you need to know is if you will have 
access to those people. You will need to know about how many customers and what 
the MSSP does to provide all their services to those customers. What you want to 
look for is that the MSSP is adequately staffed with enough fully trained and experi-
enced people to handle your needs. To ensure they have enough people they need to 
make sure that they can keep their customer to staff member ratio in balance and that 
they do not incur too much churn over in staff. As mentioned before, high turnover 
of quality staff members are not going to win any MSSP security awards in service 
delivery.
SERVICE EXECUTION
Once you understand how your service is actually going to be delivered and 
who is delivering it you need to know what is actually being delivered and how 
they are going to execute on the service commitments. For example, you need to 
know how communication is going to work and what communication you should 
expect.
When there is an incident that needs to be addressed, what is the outsourced 
organization providing your security services expected to do? Who are they sup-
posed to call and what is the urgency of the call? These are all things that you need 
to understand yourself and then ensure your outsourced security organization can 

231
﻿ How the services will be delivered
meet your needs of who is to be notified when there is such an incident that needs 
to be addressed. You need to make sure that the outsourced organization can call 
the right people at the right time and solicit the right response to ensure that your 
organization gets the needed information quickly and efficiently in order to be 
able to address any security issues. You cannot expect an outsourced organization 
to be successful if you do not provide them the right communication methods for 
your organization and your staff. If you provide your outsourced security company 
with a method of communicating to you, then you need to make sure that you 
meet them halfway and respond to those communications. Communication is key 
between the two organizations, everyone must do their part to ensure that there 
is a successful partnership between the two companies so that the organization is 
able to stay safe.
TOOLS
There are many tools that may be provided by the MSSP to help you protect your 
organization or allow you to get needed information when you want it. One of these 
tools may be a self-service portal, this is a website that you can go to in order to see 
any activity that the outsourcer is performing on your behalf or to make changes, 
open trouble tickets or event create new incidents for the outsourcer to investigate. 
Self-service portals are a great way to communicate with your outsourcer and have 
been an invaluable resource for outsources to provide information to their custom-
ers. Many outsource security providers use their portals as a place for the customer 
to be able to retrieve compliance reports, metrics, or even disseminate information 
regarding new vulnerabilities and exploits that are being detected in the wild. Some 
of these portals can be so advanced that your internal SOC may use it as its primary 
security tool and real-time interface with the MSSP.
Depending on what you need from your security outsourcer the self-service portal 
may be a fully functional system for you to utilize as a cornerstone of your internal 
security operation center in partnership with your outsourcer all the way to a mini-
malistic system that allows you to just retrieve basic information regarding escalated 
of events. Some outsourced organizations may even have Mobile applications that IT 
or security managers can utilize to address or acknowledge security events wherever 
they are. These mobile apps maybe fully functioning security portals or just simply 
notification mechanisms. Depending on your internal level of security these mobile 
device applications may or may not be something that you can utilize but you should 
at least be aware that as technology progresses outsourced organizations will con-
tinually adopt new technology to better provide their services, or look for a new ways 
to charge for their services and they will leverage technology as a differentiator of 
their services in the market.
When selecting an MSSP these are many features and functions that you 
have to take into consideration as part of service execution and understand that 
there may be added costs or efficiency gains that coincide with these features and 
functions.

232
CHAPTER 10  Outsourcing
SMALLER VERSUS LARGER MSSP
If you are looking at a larger enterprise organization to outsource to then many ques-
tions about how long they have been in business or if they are financially stable are 
not really applicable. But if you are looking at a smaller organization than those 
are absolutely appropriate questions and smaller managed security services provider 
should be able to help make you feel comfortable with the appropriate answers to 
those questions.
With a larger MSSP you get the comfort of knowing their backed by a giant orga-
nization is most likely financially stable that has been around for many years. These 
larger organizations have typically been very successful in providing IT related ser-
vices to organizations around the world for many years and their ability to provide 
your organization security services would certainly be no different than their ability 
to provide services to other companies like yours or ones much larger. One of the 
major drawbacks of working with one of these larger organizations it they are typi-
cally not agile or flexible enough to meet some of your more demanding or special 
needs. Larger based organizations are not well suited to handle one-off scenarios or 
special situations for each and every one of their customers, they are able to profit 
by providing standard solutions that they can sell to multiple companies over and 
over and over. Although this is a sound business model and it works well as they 
are capable of providing unparalleled operational services they may not meet your 
specific needs if you are too far outside of their standard box. This does not mean 
that they are going to be completely inflexible but there is only so much they will 
be able to customize. Additionally if there is a crisis situation that affects multiple 
customers, organizations much larger than yours may get better service because they 
can command better attention or have paid for better attention from the provider. 
But with these larger outsourcers they do have deep pockets and wells of resources 
that they can throw at problems if needed. This helps them win up new services and 
develop new markets much faster than their smaller counterparts. One thing to keep 
in mind as was mentioned before, with the larger more established providers is they 
may have gone through several acquisitions and internal restructuring that has frac-
tured the organization. They may not have been able to fully integrate their services 
with the rest of their company. So although they may be able to provide excellence 
security operations if for example, their billing and finance services are not fully in-
tegrated you still may not be able to get the right level of service that you need from 
these larger organizations.
On the other hand with the smaller security providers you may be able to be a 
bigger fish in a small pond. This may help you get better service and a more flexible 
service commitment from the organization your outsourcing to. Of course you will 
now have concerns on the stability of the organization, the financial wellbeing of the 
organization, and its potential of being acquired by another larger company. All too 
often I have heard stories about an organization being very happy with a managed se-
curity service providers quality of products and services but when after another larger 
company acquired it, those same services failed to meet the customer’s expectations. 

233
﻿ How the services will be delivered
I have also heard of a companies who left a large outsourcer because they were too 
large and went to a smaller outsourcer and was very happy, only to have that smaller 
outsourcer be acquired by the very same larger outsourcer that they had just left. This 
may sound funny or even very familiar but ultimately it is extremely disruptive to in 
organization that is focused on securing their infrastructure. It takes away from the 
core focus of managing and monitoring an organizations internal network to manag-
ing and monitoring your outsourced provider of these very same services.
When looking at smaller organizations to outsource to versus larger organiza-
tions there are challenges on both sides and both sides all come with their own prob-
lems that you need to address. If you thought making the decision to outsource your 
security was going to be a very difficult decision to make hopefully you are realizing 
now that it is not your only difficult decision you need to make. Ensuring that you 
are going to partner with the right outsourced organization that you are going to be 
successful with whatever organization you choose is not an easy task.
It is always good to get some honest feedback from counterparts in your industry. 
If you are in a group of industry professionals I am sure you have a forum in which 
to ask other organizations if they outsource, who they use and what their experiences 
have been. It is also a good idea to ask the outsourcer for references inside your 
industry or for references from companies that are the same size as yours or maybe 
even in the same local area. All too often I have seen organizations that ask for these 
references but would never follow up on or never make the phone calls and never 
speak to people on the reference list. Make sure that you are not one of those orga-
nizations. At a minimum get on the phone and speak to somebody who has used the 
security outsourcer services so that you can get a first-hand account of what it is like 
working with this potential outsourcer.
Diving deeper into the MSSP selection process there are a lot of other questions 
you may need to ask, a lot more technical, organizational, management, and service-
related questions you need to ask.
Although security services are fairly similar across all organizations not all or-
ganizations are the same. As your organization looks to outsource, you are going to 
have several issues, needs, and requirements that may be very specific to your orga-
nization. You should ask a potential managed security services provider if they offer 
any additional services and if so what are the charges for those services. For example 
if there are services that you need in order to make the necessary changes in your 
infrastructure to allow the managed security services provider to get the information 
they need or access devices they need to, is there a charge for these type services and 
if so at what rate. You need to make sure that you understand all the services you are 
going to be getting from your outsourced provider and what if any additional charges 
there would be for services considered out of scope of services you purchased. Ad-
ditionally you need to understand any charges and fees you may incur during your 
contract period. For example your contract may cover the monitoring of 10 security 
devices but if you decommission one of those 10 and then bring up a new security 
device onto your network there may be a charge to swap monitoring from one de-
vice to another. That is just a simple example, I am sure there are hundreds of much 

234
CHAPTER 10  Outsourcing
more complex examples, ultimately your situation will be different and you need to 
have a lengthy conversation with your provider regarding the complexities of your 
infrastructure and what it would take for them to provide the services you need and 
at what cost.
You should be aware of any contingency-based services or emergency services 
that you may need to take advantage of in the future. For example, if you are in a 
situation where you have detected a potential breach what are the additional costs as-
sociated with having your managed security service provider assist you with breach 
containment activities or incident response. Maybe your provider might not have 
those services available or they might not be able to even provide forensic services. 
That does not mean you should not work with that company but it is good to know 
upfront that it is not available or if it is available and at what the associated costs are.
SECURITY
This seems kind of a silly topic but even though you are thinking about purchasing 
security services it does not give you license to forget about how to securely employ 
these services. An MSSP is a third party provider of these services and your orga-
nization might have (should have) strict guidance on how third party providers are 
handled and managed. This can include administrative items like contracts and legal 
requirements but also how they will technically connect to your network. Not only 
how will they connect but how will they protect those connections and who will be 
accessing resource on your network. This is a great topic of conversation to have 
with any provider but especially with your managed security services company. You 
need to know how they are going to manage access to your network and your devices 
and what is going to stop them from accessing devices that they do not manage while 
on your network, what audits are available and what kind of access reports will you 
be able to receive. You may think that you have this all covered with what is in place 
today but if the MSSP takes over management of your devices you may not be able 
to log into them to poke around and see what is going on.
Many providers have a policy of not allowing co-management of security equip-
ment. This policy is there to protect the MSSP from things going wrong due to issues 
or changes they did not initiate, so what this means is that you may not be granted 
any kind of access to security devices on your network while the contract is in place. 
There are many ways around this if you have a hard time with it. For one, you 
could choose to mirror data to another system that they do not have access to. This 
sometimes works great in the IDS world where you can replicate events to multiple 
places. One main server sends data to the MSSP and sends data to you that you col-
lect somewhere else. This kind of split or stacked solution can be costly depending 
on the types of devices and number of technologies you want to do it with but it will 
allow you to continue to have some visibility.
You cannot blame a provider for wanting complete control over your security 
devices because this is the best way and sometimes the only way for them to be able 
to provide the best and most reliable service. Additionally they may implement spe-

235

cial controls and protection or signatures in your devices that are proprietary to the 
provider. These special configurations could be for a number of reasons such as for 
testing and alerting on the health of the environment or could even be special intel-
ligence based events that they are using. Either way, they may configure your devices 
to alert on events that are meaningful for them and not you but if you saw them you 
would not understand them and may even raise unneeded concerns.
As stated before, you should feel completely comfortable with the level of access 
logs and change reporting that they provide you and if not, then work with them to fix 
the reporting so that you are completely satisfied and your regulatory requirements 
are also satisfied.
Last but not least you should be able to get a fully understanding of what the 
MSSP has done to protect their own network. This should be from not only a techni-
cal safeguard but also a physical perspective. The last thing you want is to have a 
breach or some kind of unauthorized access from your own security provider. Make 
sure you understand what controls are in place and that they are using world class 
processes, procedures, and technology to protect their own network.
From a technical perspective, how are they going to handle your data. You may 
provide them with tons of internal documentation from policies to network maps 
and device configurations. All of this information must be properly handled but also 
your real time threat data, vulnerability status and any ongoing or active attacks need 
to be protected as confidential. Having an analyst tell one company that they have 
seen this type of attack before at company XYZ is not very good. All employees of 
an MSSP need to be properly trained on how to handle data and information and the 
MSSP’s network and processes must be enabled to technically safeguard data from 
intentional or inadvertent disclosure.
Key point: Your MSSP’s security should be a model of what a secure environ-
ment should look like, and be well beyond the level of security you could hope for, 
so if it is not then maybe you should move on to another provider.
DR
There are two main things you want to think about when it comes to DR as it relates 
to outsourcing your security. The first is obviously what devices you want to have 
protected during a DR situation but secondly what are the charges for monitoring DR 
or failover devices. These are two very different topics as it relates to DR and should 
be thought about in separate contexts in order to ensure you make the right decisions 
and get the most cost-effective solution.
When you think of your entire security infrastructure you hopefully have in-
stalled some level of failover and DR infrastructure to support your efforts when 
a problem does arise. In larger organizations, this could be entire data centers just 
sitting there getting replicated data from the primary data center. In these situations, 
you have to decide on if you are going to just outsource security for your primary 
network or backup infrastructure as well. You may have a different mix of devices 
in your DR network, with very different controls, access, and support staff. In some 

236
CHAPTER 10  Outsourcing
organizations it may be completely the same and fully replicated in real-time. What 
is it that you need to protect during a DR and what level of protection is desired. 
In one example of a DR outsourced agreement I have seen the company asked that 
the IDS and firewalls be fully monitored and managed but no threat intelligence or 
managed SIEM. This is because during a DR (that was not security induced) they 
wanted to have some level of protections but did not want the full expense of a fully 
managed environment. The company felt that in a DR situation only the basics were 
necessary to keep their eyes on security while they were able to focus attention and 
support into normal business recovery operations. Call this silly or call it smart, the 
reduction of services and security controls for them were proportional to their overall 
DR strategies. In your case, you will have to decide not only what security equipment 
you want protecting your DR environment but what level of support and services you 
will need during that critical time.
The second topic relates to the failover devices and the costs associated by your 
MSSP in managing those. In a simple scenario where you have two firewalls, one as 
the active and the other as a standby, if your MSSP was monitoring and managing 
those devices, do they charge you for 2 or 1. Maybe they have a partial charge for the 
standby since there may be ongoing configuration and maintenance that needs to take 
place on those standby devices to ensure they will properly failover when needed. As 
for your DR facility, network or data center, will your security devices be responsible 
for protecting that network all the time, so they are live and active devices or are 
they just devices that function when there is a failover. You will need to think about 
how you employ DR designated devices against how the MSSP will charge you for 
services on those devices.
Once you think you have all these items figured out make sure you talk to your 
MSSP about being involved in any DR tests. Also make sure you fully communicate 
to them what your expectations are for a DR environment and understand the proper 
way to involve and engage your MSSP when those DR scenarios do occur.
EXIT STRATEGY
This is not something we want to think about but sometimes in a relationship we just 
have to call it quits. For whatever reason, be it poor service, a change in direction, 
costs or looking to try out another provider you have to have a plan to cut the cord 
and move on. When you have a company managing security for you this may not be 
as simple of a process as you may think. Tons of things can get broken as you discon-
nect or remove services, there has to be a well thought out, documented and defined 
change process that you need to go through so that you do not impact your operations 
and you maintain security throughout the transition.
You need to make sure that the provider removes any configurations that are 
specific to their needs and access but will not affect your security or performance. 
Additionally you need to make sure you have all the administrative credentials to 
all the systems that were managed and that all of the MSSP’s accounts will be 
removed.

MSSP SELECTION
After you have reviewed all the important elements you are looking for in a provider 
and you have developed your comprehensive request for proposal, send it out to the 
companies you think will work the best. Then after you get back all your responses 
try to quickly narrow it down to only three providers. Once you think you have the 
three best, start your detailed questioning, review, site visits, and negotiations.
Once you enter the negotiation phase is when you can develop your contract and 
select the best service agreement possible. See what contract modifications you can 
make to best fit your needs and ensure the MSSP’s operating procedures are accept-
able to you. Do not be afraid to continue to ask questions and also interview current 
or past customers. Additionally you can ask an MSSP for third party audits and 
reviews. It should go without saying, but your legal counsel should review all the 
contracts. When you are asking a third party to play a role in managing your risk, it 
is very important to know where your liabilities are and what recourse you have as 
well as what the limits on damages are when something goes wrong.
Make sure you are fully satisfied with the terms of the service as you are going 
to have to live with it.
PROVIDING THE SERVICE
There are many questions that need to be asked regarding how an MSSP is going to 
provide services, what their SLAs are and what recourse a customer has for mistakes 
and issues. There is an almost exhaustive list that can be asked of a provider, some 
questions will pertain to you and some will not and I am sure I missed some, but 
what is below is just an attempt to rapid fire a bunch of questions that may help spark 
thoughts and debate for you without having to go into deep discussion as to why it 
may need to be asked.

TESTING YOUR MSSP
A very good practice that you must perform is a test against your MSSP. Similar to 
how we spoke about exercising security staff in the training chapter we need to think 
about training or testing our MSSP. Performing a simple penetration test or short 
scan that looks like a type of attack or even just taking a security device off line can 
do this. The test should be to see the entire process and the length of time it takes 
them to execute their processes. During several tests I did at one company to test 
an MSSP I kept triggering IDS events or simulated denial of service events, I even 
attacked a server using commercial penetration tools while spoofing my IP address. 
None of my efforts were escalated by the MSSP and there was not even an email that 
was sent to tell us something was going on. I further attempted to exploit the network 
and attacked from the outside, I began getting louder and louder meaning sending 
more bad data and finally after a week of penetration testing and even exploiting 
several system vulnerabilities I was able to get the MSSP to issue a low value alert 
to suspicious activity.
After meeting with the MSSP and reviewing my tests with them we discovered 
several really interesting things. First, some of the events I generated were events 
that they do not look at because they were not “interesting” to them. They felt that 
the number of alerts they get are too high so they tune down the events so their 
SOC does not get inundated. Wow, so I was able to find out that the MSSP was 
making decisions not based on security but pure efficiency, I guess they were not 
able to correlate events so that they could get the notifications of malicious activ-
ity in a more efficient manner without overwhelming their SOC. To their defense 
the events were indicators of potentially bad activity not a smoking gun but still, 
there should be more analysis going on. Next we found that some specific activity I 
performed was not seen by the MSSP at all, it turns out that there were gaps in the 
MSSPs visibility of the organizations network. In this case, there was no fault of 
the MSSP but some very quick corrective actions could be made to resolve these 
issues on our end.
That is just a quick example of many issues that can be found and there are many 
others. You need to test to make sure they see something and then escalate the issues 
properly and in a timely manner that meets your expectations. Then once complete 
talk to your MSSP, tell them you tested them and how they did even if they did well. 
Also, do not be afraid to include your MSSP in your tests, you do not always have to 
keep it a secret from them although from time to time you should. This type of testing 
can be good for both of you, to ensure services are being provided accurately and to 
see where there are areas for improvement.

SUMMARY
There are many different reasons an organization may build a SOC in-house or out-
source to an MSSP. If you decide that an MSSP is right for you, make sure you go 
into the relationship with a clear understanding of your goals and objectives. This 
will make it much easier for you to contract the proper services at the right price but 
it will also help the MSSP ensure they can sell you the services you really want and 
need. I would recommend that initially you focus on outsourcing basic consistent 
functions and aspects of your security. Once you feel comfortable that things are 
working well make sure you implement a testing program. This should be something 
you do that you feel should trigger a response from your MSSP. Make sure they are 
seeing the right traffic, getting the right logs, and responding the way you expect. 
If this is all working right consistently and you see no issues then you should feel 
comfortable to move forward and re-engage with our MSSP reps to look for other 
functions you may want to outsource. Keep in mind that you can never fully out-
source security to the point where you have no control or worries. Security is always 
your problem and when working with an MSSP you have to treat the relationship as 
a partnership and a good MSSP will always meet you half way. They will work with 
you in that partnership to ensure they are providing the best quality of service they 
can, and although at times it may not seem that way, they do care and want to do their 
part to protect your organization.

CHAPTER
In my travels, the many SOCs I have visited, seen, and worked in, I have yet to find 
a single individual that did not care about security, the mission of protection, or have 
a passion to learn. Being in the security field, we are all surrounded by a passion to 
guard and defend the network, we are all monitoring and looking to develop new 
ways to do so. It is an amazing feeling to be surrounded by that kind of focus and 
energy and just walking into a SOC and listening to the general conversations or ar-
guments that may fill the air can detect that spirit. It is also that passion that can derail 
an operation and cause it to stray from its intended purpose while creating a riff in an 
organizations cultural eco-system.
Running a SOC is a careful balance between what an organization believes it 
needs to reduce risks and the threats the SOC sees it needs to protect the organiza-
tion from. Everyone in the SOC needs to remember why they are here, to protect 
the organization and its users the best way they know how with the best tools and 
capabilities they can get a hold of.
No matter what type of SOC or what your focus is, make sure you are making 
good on your core responsibilities and you are taking care of not only the people you 
protect but also the people who are doing the protecting. The SOC has an amazing 
list of tasks to accomplish and it’s an ever-growing list. Make sure that you properly 
define that list of tasks, generate all the detailed requirements, and get the proper au-
thority to take on those responsibilities. Your SOC needs to know who the customers 
are and why the SOC is here doing its job. Once you lose sight of the fact that it is 
a services organization that must meet the demands of its customers and users then 
the SOC has failed in its mission regardless of how smart it is or how technically 
able it is to defend against threats. Customers can be anyone, it is not the servers and 
networks it monitors but rather the different departments, groups, teams, or external 
third parties that an organization works with. Sit down with your customers and go 
over the services the SOC has and its areas of responsibilities so that each and every 
customer has a good idea of why the SOC is here and what it can do for them. Engage 
with the customers, keep them up to date, and build use cases with them to make 
them part of the solution. Do not forget about meeting the expectations of the SOC, 
ensure that you constantly drive toward making improvements, and listening to your 
customers on how you can improve and ultimately protect the organization better.
It is not cheap to build a SOC and all the hardware, software, and equipment 
needed to protect an organization can be mind-blowing when you add up all the 
costs. Make sure you start small and focus on key areas. Do not take on more than 
Do not forget why you 
are here

CHAPTER 11  Do not forget why you are here
you can handle, start with small key successes, and build over time. Look for key 
capital purchase such as SIEM systems that help you organize and prepare for future 
expansion and give you tomorrow’s capabilities inside of today’s tool sets. Make 
sure you track your events and incidents so that you can gain valuable insight into 
trends and review key analysis. Ensure that your tracking and documentation pro-
cesses of analysis are not harder than the analysis itself. Customize your internal 
tracking system when you can and simplify your processes at every opportunity. 
Build yourself a knowledge base, do not leave anything up to anyone to remember. 
Make sure that your key documentation is always available, easily accessible, and 
easy to read and understand.
There is nothing wrong with building your own tools opposed to going out and 
buying commercially available tools. In fact, some of the very best commercial sys-
tems being used to monitor and defend networks today were once a home-grown 
system. Ensure that if you do decide to build your own system, no matter what its 
used for or its intended purpose, that you are not spending more time developing and 
supporting that tool then actually using the tool for its designed value and purpose. 
When you make a strategic decision to purchase a commercial tool, it is not just an 
investment in a capability, it is an investment in the vendor and a vote of confidence 
in the product line. Work closely with your vendors, make sure you hold them ac-
countable for the features and functionalities that they said you can get from their 
products. Building positive relationships with your vendors will aid in getting appro-
priate support, training and ultimately satisfying your requirements that led you to 
purchase in the first place. Looks for ways to reduce costs, if you do not need 100% 
of your organization covered by licenses today then see if you can get a volume 
discount that can be phased in over time. This gives you the ability to save money 
while you go through the long process of implementing new systems and technol-
ogy. Additionally, do not pay for functions that you do not think you will be able to 
take advantage of right away. Negotiate pricing up front but hold off on any add-ons 
or features that you will not need right away if possible. There are many things that 
your SOC is going to need and it is not feasible that they will be able to take full 
advantage of every feature or capability of every product right out of the box from 
the start. Make sure that your purchases are cost effective for your organization and 
that you get only what you need. You will find that this practice will help you negoti-
ate better terms with your vendors but also help contribute to internal budgets and 
potential cash flow constraints.
Build a SOC organization that makes sense for your needs, add the required lay-
ers of management only when necessary to stay operationally focused in ensuring 
your meeting expectations. Split up your teams in focus areas that make sense either 
to the technology they are using, or the areas that they are monitoring. The structure 
of the team should make the SOC more efficient and quicker to act. Reporting lines 
for the SOC is important but not as important as the overall mission. If the mission 
is impacted by the SOC management or senior leaders then look to fix those issues 
through effective communication, proper metrics, and market the successes. Make 
sure that you have a fully vetted and supported charter that sets the tone for the 

245
﻿ Do not forget why you are here
overall SOC mission. Ensure that the organization takes the mission of the SOC 
seriously by empowering the SOC’s responsibilities and authority through policy. 
Do not wait for someone to intervene or an incident to occur in order to build a rela-
tionship. Work closely with all the different departments in your organization to help 
establish proper roles and responsibilities, then authority will not matter because 
everyone with work together in achieving common goals.
Your people are your most important asset and well training security people are 
difficult or expensive to obtain. Clearly define the roles in your SOC for everyone to 
see and for everyone to know and understand how they fit into the overall big picture. 
Analysts come in many different shapes and sizes and although they are typically 
looked at as some of the most junior of people in the SOC they are characteristically 
your most important. Having analysts that can spot issues before they become prob-
lems is worth a lot. The ability to triage an issue and make the right calls during the 
incident response process is paramount to the overall success of the SOC in protect-
ing the organization. Engineers need to work hard to stay on top of the equipment 
and infrastructure that they manage and maintain for the SOC. One bad configuration 
can flood the SOC and effectively blind the organization. Engineers being some of 
the most technical resources in your SOC need to be held accountable. They need to 
make sure that they can help move the SOC forward but not at the expense of others. 
They need to lead by example for others in the SOC and continually strive to learn 
their craft to continually increase the security posture of the organization. All the 
while, engineers need to be monitoring and adjusting in order to defend against the 
ever increasing skill and stealth tradecraft of the attackers.
Managers and supervisors need to know their people, they need to know their 
organization and know security. They need to be able to translate all that knowledge 
into action and execution while ensuring transparent communication throughout the 
entire organization.
Build your people and build your team, promote from within and grow. Find 
the right people who have an aptitude for technology, a passion for security and a 
personality that fits. Train them and provide them with the skills and knowledge to 
be successful. Give them opportunities to advance and keep them going with posi-
tive reinforcement, acknowledgement of achievement and increased responsibility. 
Work does not have to be boring, have fun, and come up with creative programs 
that keep people engaged and focused. Allow people to take a break from the norm 
to work on special teams or special projects and not always suffer with the routine 
daily grind.
Your SOC has a mission, make sure that you can carry out that mission appropri-
ately for your organization. Weather you need to run a business hours only SOC in 
one location or a follow the Sun model across many international SOCs ensure that 
you have the right processes in place to address critical operational needs. Commu-
nication is key to ensuring that nothing gets missed and that key tasks and problems 
do not get dropped. Communicate from shift to shift and SOC to SOC, put impor-
tant processes in place for people to get help when needed and ensure that manage-
ment can address issues before they become bigger problems. Performing incident 

246
CHAPTER 11  Do not forget why you are here
response can be stressful, make sure that you have well thought-out checklists avail-
able to ensure that in the heat of the battle all required items are properly covered. 
Create exercises that test people under real conditions and evaluate responses. Get 
everyone from the organization involved, security is a team sport.
Train each person in the SOC how to do their job and the required functions of 
each role. Make sure that training is conducted on the job along with more senior 
people so evaluation of proficiency and support can be provided. Vendor training and 
third party certification training reinforces needed job skills and gives organizations 
good measures to help evaluate training needs of the individual. Make sure that all 
training is not technical, ensure that everyone understands who the customers are and 
how to best serve the customers. The SOC must be customer focused and everyone 
must have the soft skills to ensure they are providing the best possible service. The 
best security teams and SOCs will go un-noticed, un-funded, and undervalued if the 
proper attitudes and customer service is lacking or non-existent.
Make sure you build a continuous improvement program for as many areas of the 
SOC as possible. Ensure you are providing the right training for the right services 
and in the right areas.
Measure as many of the areas of the SOC as you possibly can, if you cannot mea-
sure it then you cannot improve it. The metrics and data that are generated should 
be geared for the specific user who will review the reports and associated informa-
tion. Do not just build charts and graphs because they look good or that they are the 
ones everyone makes. Ensure that you are getting the right metrics to improve your 
programs, spot trouble areas or to track efficiency. Think about metrics that support 
the efforts to secure the organization and how different metrics can be leverage to 
make real-time decisions and course correction. Good actionable metrics should be 
displayed for everyone to see and should help guild work efforts or indicate prob-
lems. Put key metrics and performance indicators out on a reliable time schedule for 
all to see and look at. Use the metrics as fact-based justifications for change and for 
a service impact to show all the value of your SOC to the customer.
Building intelligence is one of the primary methods of a mature SOC to stay 
one step ahead of threats and be proactive in its approach. Ensuring that complete 
analysis details are wrapped back into the SOC tools sets to ensure the detection 
of additional activity is critical. Sharing information and participating in external 
intelligence-driven communities not only helps your organization but others as well. 
Participation in intelligence networks can provide the SOC an invaluable informa-
tion source that can help detect activity never previously known about or that would 
have taken several months to figure out. Combine malware analysis, forensic analy-
sis, and key event analysis along with external intelligence information to better arm 
your SOC with specific signatures and rules that are custom tailored to your environ-
ment and that is designed to defend against key threat actors.
All of these tasks and activities are vital the successful defending of an organiza-
tions computing assets. Building, designing, and executing on all of this is too much 
for many organizations to handle. Instead look for key business relationships that can 
be leveraged and outsource the specific items that are modular enough for an external 

247
﻿ Do not forget why you are here
entity to be successful with. Ensure that the partner you choose is capable of meet-
ing your demands but at the same time make sure that you are asking for something 
that is reasonable. Metrics and SLAs are there to guide you and keep you and your 
outsourced partner on track. If your expectations are not being met then put in tests 
to find out why, work with your outsourcer to resolve the issues before they become 
unmanageable problems.
The SOC is a fun and rewarding place to be, work and live. It is the epicenter of 
security and can be magical when everything goes right and can be a dungeon when 
everything goes wrong. There are new SOCs being built every day and many exist-
ing SOCs looking to make things better. Use the tactics, techniques, and procedures 
in this book to build your SOC or make it a better place but most of all I hope that 
this book will help give you the ideas, motivation, and direction that will ultimately 
help you protect your organization.
