Preface 
This is a book for a lab course meant to accompany, or follow, any standard course in 
industrial/power electronics. This book has the following objectives: 
1. To support, verify, and supplement the theory; to show the relations and differences 
between theory and practice. 
2. To teach measurement techniques. 
3. To convince students that what they are taught in their lecture classes is real and useful. 
4. To help make students tinkerers and make them used to asking “what if” questions. 
This book contains 50 experiments, which help the reader to explore the concepts studied 
in the classroom. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the working principles of 
circuits. The references given at the end of chapters helps you to refresh your theoretical 
knowledge. Here is a brief summary of chapters and appendixes: 
Chapter 1 studies the most commonly used measurement devices that are used in the 
laboratory. 
Chapter 2 studies the most commonly used switches (i.e., relay, BJT, MOSFET, 
temperature, and reed switches). 
Chapter 3 studies the thyristor and triacs. 
Chapter 4 studies the different types of power supply circuits. 
Chapter 5 studies the DC-DC converter circuits. 
Chapter 6 studies the different types of ﬁlter and comparator circuits. 
Chapter 7 studies the speed and direction control of DC motors. 
Chapter 8 studies the delay generator circuits. 
Appendix shows how to draw different types of graphs with MATLAB®. 
I hope that this book will be useful to the readers, and I welcome comments on the 
book.

Commonly Used Laboratory Equipment 
1.1
Introduction 
This chapter studies the most commonly used devices in the laboratory. Measurement 
devices that are used in different laboratories are made by different companies. Working 
with each device has its own details. Therefore, you are encouraged to read the user 
manual of devices that you will use during the experiments. Another good reference is 
your laboratory instructor. Studying the Ref. [1] is recommended as well. 
1.2
Digital Multi Meter (DMM) 
Digital multimeters are measuring instruments that can measure quantities such as voltage, 
current, and resistance. Measured values are shown on a digital display, allowing them to 
be read easily and directly, even by ﬁrst-time users. 
Study the user manual of the DMM that you will use in the experiments. Ensure that 
you are able to do the followings: 
(a) Measurement of resistance. 
(b) Measurement of AC/DC voltages. 
(c) Measurement of AC/DC currents in the range of Amps. 
(d) Measurement of AC/DC currents in the range of milli/micro Amps. 
Ask your laboratory instructor to make an explanation to you if you are not able to do 
one or more of the above tasks.

Commonly Used Laboratory Equipment
1.3
Function Generator (Signal Generator) 
A function generator (sometime is called signal generator) is used to generate different 
types of electrical waveforms over a wide range of frequencies. Some of the most common 
waveforms produced by the function generator are the sine wave, square wave, triangular 
wave and saw tooth shapes. 
The FG’s are divided into two groups: Analog FG’s and Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) 
FG’s. As the name suggests, the analog FG’s, uses the analog circuits in order to produce 
the output waveform. DDS FG’s use digital circuits (i.e. a microprocessor) in order to 
produce the output waveforms. Accuracy of DDS signal generators is better than analog 
signal generators. 
Beside the standard waveforms (i.e. sinusoidal, square, triangular and saw tooth), some 
DDS FG’s are able to produce arbitrary waveforms. These type of FG’s are called Arbi-
trary Waveform Generator (AWG). They have software which permits you to draw the 
waveform that you want. After drawing the waveform in the software environment, the 
hardware of AWG produces the waveform for you. 
Output of function generator is connected to the circuit under test with the aid of a 
cable (Fig. 1.1). Black wire is connected to the ground of the signal generator as shown in 
Fig. 1.2. R1 shows the output resistance of the signal generator which is generally 50 Ω.

Study the user manual of the function generator that you will use in the experiments. 
Ensure that you are able to do the followings: 
(a) Generation of a sinusoidal signal with amplitude of 5 V and frequency of 50 Hz, i.e., 
v left pa renthesis t ri ght parenthesis equals 5 times sine left parenthesis 2 pi times 50 times t right parenthesis upper V. 
(b) Generation of a sinusoidal signal with amplitude of 5 V, frequency of 50 Hz and 
average value of 3 V, i.e., v left pa rent hesis t right parenthesis equals 3 plus 5 times sine left parenthesis 2 pi times 50 times t right parenthesis upper V. 
(c) Generation of a sinusoidal signal with peak value of 50 mV, i.e., v lef t paren th
esis t right  parenthesis equals 0.05 times sine left parenthesis 2 pi times 50 times t right parenthesis upper V. 
(d) Generation of a triangular wave with frequency of 50 Hz and peak value of 5 V 
(Fig. 1.3).
(e) Generation of a pulse with frequency of 50 Hz and duty cycle of 25% (Fig. 1.4).
Ask your laboratory instructor to make an explanation to you if you are not able to do 
one or more of the above tasks. 
1.4
Oscilloscope 
An oscilloscope is an instrument that graphically displays electrical signals and shows 
how those signals change over time. Scientists, engineers, physicists, repair technicians 
and educators use oscilloscopes to see signals change over time. These days generally 
digital scopes are used in laboratory.

that you are able to do the followings: 
(a) Measurement of peak value of a signal. 
(b) Measurement of period and frequency of a periodic signal. 
(c) Use the cursors to read voltage or time difference between two points. 
(d) Observing two waveforms simultaneously. 
(e) Measurement of phase difference between two waveforms. Remember that you can 
measure the phase difference between two waveform easily with the aid of nor m
al upper Delta phi equals StartFraction normal upper Delta t Over upper T EndFraction times 360 Superscript ring
no rmal upper Delta phi equals StartFraction normal upper Delta t Over upper T EndFraction times 360 Superscript ring formula (Fig. 1.5).

one or more of the above tasks. 
1.5
Power Supply 
All the circuits require an energy source in order to work. The power supply (PS) is 
responsible for providing the required energy for the circuit. The power supply takes the 
AC electric energy from the grid and converts it into a DC voltage. Generally, they provide 
the voltages in the 0–30 V range. Generally, the output current could be up to 3 A. The 
outputs of a PS are called a “Channel”. So, when we speak about a 3 channel PS, we 
mean a PS with three outputs. Generally, the outputs are variable and the user could set 
them to the desired value he/she wants. Generally, PS’s have one regulated output with 
voltage of 5 V. This output is used to supply digital circuits. Remember that traditional 
digital circuits work with 5 V (However this voltage decreased to 3.3 V and even 1.1 V 
these days!). So, it is a good idea to use this ﬁxed 5 V when you work with traditional 
digital circuits. You can connect a digital circuit to variable outputs of a PS. However, 
if you increase the voltage of that variable channel by mistake, then your circuit may be 
damaged. So, always use this ﬁxed 5 V when you are working with traditional digital 
circuits.

Different Types of Switches 
2.1
Introduction 
In electrical engineering, a switch is an electrical component that can disconnect or 
connect the conducting path in an electrical circuit, interrupting the electric current or 
diverting it from one conductor to another. Switches play an important role in industrial 
electronics. Important types of switches are studied in this chapter. 
2.2
Relay 
Relay is an electromechanical switch. You can use a relatively small current to control a 
large current. Relays are thousand and million times slower than electronic switches like 
BJT and MOSFET’s. Relays are bidirectional switches. Therefore, you can use them in 
both AC and DC circuits. 
Each relay has a coil. The current passes through the coil makes an electromagnet. 
The electromagnet closes or opens the relay’s contacts. 
Important types of relays are shown in Fig. 2.1. In Fig.  2.1, SPST, SPDT, DPST and 
DPDT stands for Single Pole Single Through, Single Pole Double Through, Double Pole 
Single Through and Double Pole Double Through, respectively.
Each relay works with a certain voltage. The required operating voltage for the coil and 
current allowed to pass through relay contacts is printed on the relay case. For instance, 
for the relay shown in Fig. 2.2, the operating voltage for the coil is 12 V. The contacts of 
this relay can handle 250 VAC/10 A or 30 VDC/10 A load. Why the allowed DC voltage 
is much smaller than the allowed AC voltage?

Relay Test Circuit 
Circuit shown in Fig. 2.3 is a simple circuit to test a SPST relay. VDC equals to the 
nominal voltage of the relay coil. AC sinusoidal signal is large enough to turn on the 
light bulb. When you press the push button, the coil is energized and the lamp turns on.
Test circuit for a SPDT relay is shown in Fig. 2.4. When the push button is not pressed, 
L1 is on and L2 is off. When you press the push button, L1 turns off and L2 turns on. 
VDC equals to the relay’s nominal coil voltage. AC sinusoidal signal is large enough to 
turn on the light bulb.
Assume that the available DC voltage is bigger than the nominal voltage of the coil. 
You can use the circuit shown in Fig. 2.5 in this case.
Let’s calculate the value of required resistor R1 in Fig. 2.5. When the push button 
is pressed, the nominal current must pass through the coil. So, upper  I  Subscript n o m Baseline equals StartFraction upper V upper D upper C minus upper V Subscript r e l a y Baseline Over upper R 1 EndFraction right double arrow upper R 1 equals StartFraction upper V upper D upper C minus upper V Subscript r e l a y Baseline Over upper I Subscript n o m Baseline EndFraction

. For instance, assume that we have a 12 V relay with coil resistance 
of 400 Ω. In this case nominal current is upper  I  Subscript n o m Baseline equals StartFraction 12 Over 400 EndFraction equals 30 mA
uppe r I Subscript n o m Baseline equals StartFraction 12 Over 400 EndFraction equals 30 mA. When VDC  = 15 V,

You can use the circuit shown in Fig. 2.7 to control a relay with a microcontroller. The 
microcontroller pin generates 0 and 5 V (or 0 and 3.3 V). When the microcontroller

Let’s design the circuit shown in Fig. 2.7. Assume that given relay is a 12 V relay 
with nominal current of 30 mA. This means that resistance of the coil is 400 Ω. TIP  
41 is a good option for Q1. Let’s take the current equal to 40 (beta Subscript m i n Baseline equals 40). Therefore,

uper I Subscript upper B shows the base current of Q1. Vrelay equals to 12 V since selected relay requires 12

the turn off time. 
Design the circuit shown in Fig. 2.7 based on relay available in your lab and test it. 
Use 0 and 5 V to test the circuit. 
2.5
Control of Relay with MOSFET Transistor 
You can use a MOSFET to control a relay as well. The circuit shown in Fig. 2.8 can be 
used for this purpose. Diode D1 protects the MOSFET against the induced voltage of relay 
coil. The microcontroller pin generates 0 and 5 V. When microcontroller generates 0 V, no 
current passes through the relay coil and the pole is connected to normally close terminal. 
When it generates 5 V, the coil is energized and connects the pole to normally open 
terminal. According to IRFZ 44 N datasheet, maximum of gate-source threshold voltage 
is 4 V. Therefore, 5 V can turn on the transistor since 5 sem icolon n ormal upper V grea ter than max left parenthesis upper V Subscript upper G upper S comma t h r e s h o l d Baseline right parenthesis equals 4 upper V.

Make the circuit shown in Fig. 2.9 and ensure it works properly. 
You can use NTD3055L170 MOSFET if your microcontroller generates 0 and 3.3 V. 
Maximum gate-source threshold voltage for NTD3055L170 equals to 2 V. Therefore, 
3.3 V can turn on the NTD3055L170. 
2.6
Optocoupler 
Optocoupler (Opto-isolator) is device that transfer electrical signals between two isolates 
circuits with the aid of light. Generally, one of the isolated circuits works with a high 
voltage. We want to isolate this high voltage from the other circuit, which works with a 
low voltage and contains sensitive components like IC’s and transistors.

Different Types of Switches
Fig. 2.10 Simple test circuit for optocoupler 
Let’s see how an optocoupler works. Prepare the circuit shown in Fig. 2.10. When the 
LED is not energized, the collector-emitter connection behaves like an open circuit and 
collector voltage equals to VCC which in Fig. 2.10 is 12 V. When the LED is energized, 
the collector-emitter behaves like short circuit and collector voltage is a small value. 
Apply the 0 and +5 V to the resistor R1 (Figs. 2.11 and 2.12) and measure the collector 
voltage. Does it work as expected? Measure the voltage drop across the LED in Fig. 2.12 
as well.
Search the internet and see what an optocounter is and how it works.

2.7
Control of Relay with an Optocoupler 
The optocoupler can be used in control of relays as well. The circuit shown in Fig. 2.13 
can be used to turn on/off a light bulb. When control signal is +5 V the LED turns on 
and the phototransistor energizes the relay coil. When control signal is 0 V the LED is 
reverse biased and no current passes through the phototransistor. In this case the relay 
coil is not energized and the contacts are in the NC state.
You can use the circuit shown in Fig. 2.14 if your relay requires more current than the 
maximum current of the optocoupler. When the LED is forward biased (control signal = 
+5 V), the phototransistor turns on and cause the Q1 to enter into the cut-off mode. The 
relay coil is not energized in this case and the relay contacts are in the NC state. When the 
LED is reverse biased (control signal = 0 V), the photo transistor is in the cut-off mode 
and Q1 is in the saturation mode. When Q1 is saturated, the relay’s coil is energized and 
the relay’s contacts are in the NO mode.

Darlington Pair 
The Darlington transistor named after its inventor, Sidney Darlington. Basic Darlington 
transistor conﬁgurations are shown in Fig. 2.15. Providing a high current gain is the 
advantage of the Darlington pair. Equivalent current gain for Darlington pair is around 
beta 1 times beta Subscript 2 where beta 1 and beta 2 shows the current gain of the ﬁrst and second transistor. Note 
that we have two base emitter junction; therefore, a voltage drop of 1.4 V is expected. 
ULN2033 is a famous Darlington array.

load). Set the VB equal to 0 V and start to increase it slightly. Pay attention to the value 
shown by the voltmeter. What is the minimum value shown by the voltmeter?
Measure the circuit currents (base of Q1, collector of Q1, emitter of Q1, collector of 
Q2 and emitter of Q2) for VB = 10 V. Measure the voltage of base Q1 as well. Use the 
measurements to calculate the equivalent current gain (beta  S

BDX 33 contains two transistors connected in Darlington conﬁguration. You can use 
this device instead of using two discrete transistors. 
2.9
MOSFET as Switch 
MOSFET’s can be used as switches to connect or disconnect load current. The MOSFET 
turns on when you give a gate-source voltage which is bigger than the threshold voltage. 
Let’s get started. Make the circuit shown in Fig. 2.17. Increase the  VG  from 0 to 5 V  
with 0.5 steps. Pay attention to the collector voltage. Find the minimum value that turns 
on the MOSFET.

You can control the load power with the aid of pulses applied to the gate terminal of 
the MOSFET. Make the circuit shown in Fig. 2.18 and apply pulses with different duty 
cycles to the gate terminal (Fig. 2.19). Observe the output (drain voltage) and input (gate 
voltage) simultaneously. What is the relationship between input and output?
Use the oscilloscope to measure the RMS of load voltage. Use the RMS value to ﬁnd 
the power dissipated in the load. 
You can use the circuit shown in Fig. 2.20 to control the speed of small DC motors. 
The diode protects the transistor against the high voltages generated by armature winding. 
Make the circuit shown in Fig. 2.20 and apply a gate pulse with duty cycle of 20% and 
frequency of 500 Hz (Fig. 2.21). Increase the duty cycle from 20% up to 80% with 10% 
steps and observe the change of DC motor speed.
You can use the TL 494 to control the speed of small DC motors as well. TL 494 
generates the required pulses for you and eliminates the need for a signal generator.

Transistor 
The circuit shown in Fig. 2.22 can be used to control a load current. Vload is the voltage 
required for the load. When control signal is +5 V, the LED is forward biased and the 
phototransistor is in saturation mode. Q1 is reverse biased and Q2 charges the gate-source 
capacitor of the MOSFET. This turns on the MOSFET and load current starts to ﬂow. 
Diode D1 protects the MOSFET against the inductive loads.
When control signal is 0 V, the LED is reverse biased and the phototransistor is cut-off 
mode. Q1 conducts and cause Q3 to discharge the gate-source capacitor of the MOSFET. 
This turns off the MOSFET and load current stops.

Temperature switches (thermostats) are a type of switches that change state based on the

(A) Contact opens when temperature rises to set point (Normally Closed), 
(B) Contact closes when temperature rises to set point (Normally Open). 
Two type of temperature switches are shown in Figs. 2.23 and 2.24.

magnetic ﬁeld exists, the reed switch acts as short circuit. When magnetic ﬁeld does not 
exist, it act as open circuit.

switch and observe what happens.

compatible. Therefore, you can use an Arduino board to read them [1].

Thyristors and Triacs 
3.1
Introduction 
Thyristor (or Silicon Controlled Rectiﬁer, SCR) is an important solid-state switch. It is 
a unidirectional device. This means that current can pass from anode to cathode only 
(Fig. 3.1).
Triacs (Fig. 3.2) are bidirectional switches (current can go from MT1 to MT2 or from 
MT2 to MT1). Being bidirectional makes triacs suitable for AC circuits.
This chapter studies the important circuits that can be made with thyristors and triacs. 
3.2
Relaxation Oscillator with UJT 
Relaxation oscillator is the most common use of Uni-Junction Transistor (UJT). The 
relaxation oscillator can be used to trigger the thyristors. 
A relaxation oscillator is shown in Fig. 3.3. Explain how the circuit shown in Fig. 3.3 
works. Make the circuit shown in Fig. 3.3 and observe the waveform of different nodes. 
What role is played by the potentiometer?
Observe the voltage of Emitter node (node E in Fig. 3.3) and measure the maximum 
and minimum value of the observed waveform. For 2N2646, typical intrinsic standoff ratio 
(eta) is around 0.7. Therefore, peak value of Emitter voltage is around up er V Subscri pt

Thyristor 
Thyristor is a unidirectional switch (Fig. 3.4). The user can apply a gate pulse to turn 
on the thyristor. When the thyristor is on, the current goes from anode to cathode. The 
thyristor conducts current until the voltage between the cathode and anode is reversed or 
reduced below a certain threshold or holding value.
Circuits of this chapter used TIC106 thyristor. Pinout of TIC106 thyristor is shown in 
Fig. 3.5.

Thyristors and Triacs
Fig. 3.4 In thyristors current ﬂows from anode to cathode
Thyristors are operated in one of the following three states. 
Forward conducting: This is a thyristor’s primary operating mode. Current ﬂows from 
anode to cathode until the current falls below a speciﬁc level, called the holding current. 
Forward blocking: In this case upper V Subscrip t a n o d e Baseline minus upper V Subscript c a t h o d e Baseline greater than 0. However, lack of gate pulse causes 
the thyristor block the ﬂow of current. 
Reverse blocking mode: In this case upper V  Subscript a n o d e Baseline minus upper V Subscript c a t h o d e Baseline less than 0 and no current (except of a 
small leakage current of order of few micro amps) pass through the thyristor. 
Let’s get started. Circuit shown in Fig. 3.6 helps you to understand how thyristor works. 
Make the circuit shown in Fig. 3.6 (Set VG to 0 V). Use a DC voltmeter to monitor the 
load voltage (i.e., up er V Subscript upper A Baseline minus upper V Subscript upper B). Increase the VG slightly until the thyristor enters the forward 
conducting mode (when DC voltmeter shows a voltage around 10–10.5 V the thyristor is 
in the forward conducting mode). Measure the gate current (current through resistor RG) 
and voltage drop across the anode–cathode of the thyristor. Disconnect the connection 
between RG and gate terminal (Fig. 3.7) when the thyristor is in the forward conduction 
mode. Does the thyristor continue to conduct current in this case?

Thyristor Turn Off Methods in DC Circuits 
Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 3.8. When you press the S1 push button, the thyristor 
starts to conduct current and enters the forward conduction mode. When you press the 
S2 push button, the load current starts to pass through the push button S2 and thyristor 
current decreases to zero. When you release the push button S2, the thyristor is in the off 
state and stays in the off state until the user press the push button S1 again.

Thyristors and Triacs

Make the circuit shown in Fig. 3.8 and ensure that it works as expected. Press the 
push button S1 and measure the voltage of different nodes. Release the push button S1 
after measurement. Then press the push S2 and measure the voltage of different nodes. 
Compare your measurements with hand analysis results. 
Another technique to turn off a thyristor in a DC circuit is shown in Fig. 3.9. When  
you press the S1 push button, the gate current ﬂows and the thyristor enters the forward 
conduction mode. This charges the capacitor C1 to around 10–10.5 V.

Fig. 3.7 Gate current is zero
When you press the S2 push button, the capacitor is connected to the thyristor and 
applies a negative voltage it. This negative voltage cause the thyristor to enter the reverse 
blocking mode and stops the load current. 
Make the circuit shown in Fig. 3.9. Press the push button S1 and measure the voltage 
of different nodes. Release the push button S1 after measurement. Then press the push 
S2 and measure the voltage of different nodes. Compare your measurements with hand 
analysis results.

Diac 
The diac is a diode that conducts electrical current only after its break over voltage, VBO, 
has been reached momentarily. I-V characteristic of a diac is shown in Fig. 3.10. Diacs 
are usually used for triggering the triacs.
Let’s use a simple circuit to see how diacs behave. Make the circuit shown in Fig. 3.11. 
Set V1 equal to 0 V and increase it with 3 V steps until the LED turns on (up pe r V Baseline 1 almost equals 30 upper V
turns on the LED). Measure the voltage drop across the diac when the LED is turned on.

Repeat the previous experiment with the polarity of V1 reversed (Fig. 3.12).
3.6
Pulse Generation with Diacs 
You can use the diacs for pulse generation as well. Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 3.13. 
The capacitor starts to charge through R1 and potentiometer. When voltage of capacitor 
wants to go over the break over voltage of DB3 diac, the diac enters the conduction mode 
and discharges the capacitor. Capacitor starts to charge again after the discharge and this 
process repeats.

Dimmer Circuit 
A dimmer circuit is a circuit which can be used to control the intensity of incandescent 
light bulbs, speed of small universal motors or amount of heat generated by a heater. A 
dimmer works by essentially chopping parts out of the AC voltage. 
A dimmer circuit is shown in Fig. 3.14. The triac is triggered when voltage of capacitor 
C1 is bigger than the break over voltage of DB3 diac. Break over voltage of DB3 is around 
30 V. The time instant that capacitor voltage reaches 30 V is controlled by potentiometer 
and its series resistor R1. R2 and C2 form a snubber circuit and protest the triac.
Simulate the circuit shown in Fig. 3.14 and observe the waveforms of different nodes. 
Study the effect of potentiometer on the load voltage. Don’t try to make this circuit on 
breadboard. Realization of this circuit requires a printed circuit board and it must be tested 
under the supervision of lab instructor.

Controlled Rectifiers 
Thyrsitors can be used to make controlled rectiﬁers. Controlled rectiﬁers generally use a 
pulse transformer to trigger the thyristors. Reference [1] shows how to make a controlled 
rectiﬁer with thyristors and an Arduino board.

You can use a diode bridge instead of using four separate diode. A sample diode bridge 
and its equivalent circuit are shown in Figs. 4.4 and 4.5, respectively.

Symmetric Power Supply 
The previous circuits provides positive voltages only. In this section, we want to study 
the generation of symmetric outputs (i.e., both positive and negative voltages). Symmetric 
power supplies require a center tap transformer. 
The transformer required in this section is shown in Fig. 4.6. Waveforms of this 
transformer are shown in Fig. 4.7.

while 7905 provides a −5 V output. Pinout 78xx and 79xx ICs are shown in Fig. 4.10. 
For correct operation, absolute value of input voltage must be bigger than output voltage 
by at least 2–3 V.
The circuit shown in Fig. 4.11 shows how to convert +12 V into +5 V. 7805 can take 
input voltages in the [+7 V, +35 V] range and can give up to 1.5 A of output current.
Addition of a diode between input and output nodes (Fig. 4.12) is recommended.
The circuit shown in Fig. 4.13 shows how to convert −12 V into −5 V. 7905 can take 
input voltages in the [−7 V,  −35 V] range and can give up to 1 A of output current.
Addition of a diode between input and output nodes (Fig. 4.14) is recommended.

The circuit shown in Fig. 4.32 or 4.33 can be used to disconnect the energy from a load 
when temperature is beyond a certain level. When temperature rises, the NTC resistance 
decreases and potential of positive terminal of Op Amp increases. Output of the Op Amp 
is low (i.e., around 0 V) when potential of positive terminal is less than
StartFraction 8.2 Over 8.2 plus 4.7 EndFraction times 12 equals 7.63 upper V
StartFra ction  8
.2 Ov er 8.2 plus 4.7 EndFraction times 12 equals 7.63 upper V. Output of the Op Amp is high (i.e., around 12 V) when voltage of positive 
terminal of the Op Amp is bigger than 7.63 upper V. The thyristor is triggered when output of 
the Op Amp is high. The user needs to press the push button to reset the circuit.

DC-DC Converters 
5.1
Introduction 
DC-DC converters take a DC voltage as input and generate a different DC voltage (i.e., a 
DC voltage that is bigger or smaller than input) as output. This chapter studies some of 
the important DC-DC converter circuits. 
5.2
Boost Converter 
The circuit shown in Fig. 5.1 shows a Boost converter circuit. The Boost converter pro-
vides a output voltage that is bigger than input voltage. The gate signal is a pulse with 
amplitude of 5 V, frequency of 25 kHz and duty cycle of 0.6. You can use a signal 
generator to make this pulse.
Analyze the circuit shown in Fig. 5.1 and calculate the average value of output voltage 
and output voltage ripple using hand analysis. Make the circuit and measure the average 
value of output voltage using a DC voltmeter. Then use an oscilloscope to measure the 
output voltage ripple (connect the oscilloscope to load and use AC coupling to observe 
the ripple only). Compare your measurements with hand analysis results. Calculate the 
efﬁciency of the circuit as well (eta equals StartFraction upper P Subscript o u t Baseline Over upper P Subscript i n Baseline EndFraction
eta equals StartFraction upper P Subscript o u t Baseline Over upper P Subscript i n Baseline EndFraction ). Change the duty cycle and measure the average 
value of output for different duty cycles. 
A DC-DC converter requires a closed-loop control system to give a stable DC output. 
Without a closed-loop control system, disturbances like: input voltage changes and output 
load changes affect the output voltage. Closed-loop control system design for DC-DC 
converters is studied in [1].

Buck Converter 
We used discrete components to make a Boost converter in the previous example. Many 
ICs were made to simplify making the DC-DC converters. You need to add few external 
components to these ICs to make the desired converter. In this experiment, we will use 
LM 2576 to make a Buck converter. Study the datasheet of this IC (This IC has 52 kHz 
switching frequency). Functional block diagram of this IC is shown in Sect. 7.2 of [2]. 
Let’s get started. Make the circuit shown in Fig. 5.2. Measure the output voltage and 
efﬁciency. Observe the waveform of diode D1 as well. Measure the frequency of observed 
waveform. 
See [3] to see another IC that can be used to make DC-DC converters.

Voltage-Inverting Converter with TL7660 IC 
Sometimes you need a negative voltage to supply your circuit (i.e., circuits made with Op 
Amps) but you have only one power supply (for example you have only one 12 V batter). 
In these cases you can use TL7660 to convert a positive voltage into a negative voltage. 
Note that TL7660 provides a small output current for you. It is suitable for light loads 
only. 
Let’s get started. Make the circuit shown in Fig. 5.3 (input voltage is less than 3.5 V). 
Use a DC voltmeter to measure the average value of the output voltage. Connect different 
loads to the output (upper V Subscript upper O upper U upper T node) and use an oscilloscope to observe the load voltage. 
What happens to the load voltage waveform when the load current increases? 
Repeat the experiment with the circuit shown in Fig. 5.4.
5.5
Voltage-Inverting Converter with MC33063 IC 
You can use a MC33063 IC for voltage polarity reversal as well. This IC provides more 
output current in comparison to TL7660. However, it requires more external components 
in comparison to TL7660. 
Let’s get started. Make the circuit shown in Fig. 5.5. Use a DC voltmeter to measure 
the average value of the output voltage. Connect different loads to the output (upper V Subscript upper O upper U upper T node) 
and use an oscilloscope to observe the load voltage. What happens to the load voltage 
waveform when the load current increases?

Control of DC Motors 
7.1
Introduction 
A DC motor is an electrical motor that uses direct current to produce mechanical torque. 
Control of DC motors (i.e., control of shaft speed or position) is relatively easy. This 
makes the DC motors a good choice for many applications. This chapter shows how speed 
and direction of rotation of a permanent magnet brushed DC motor can be controlled. 
7.2
Direction of Rotation Indicator 
You can use the circuit shown in Fig. 7.1 to show the rotation direction of the motor. 
When motor rotates clockwise, one LED turns on and when the motor rotates counter 
clockwise, the other one turns on.
Make the circuit shown in Fig. 7.1. Apply up e r V 1 equals plus 12 upper V and up e r V 1 equals negative 12 upper V and see the 
behaviour of the circuit. 
7.3
DC Motor Speed Control 
The circuit shown in Fig. 7.2 can be used to control the speed of a small DC motor. You 
can’t use this circuit to control the direction of rotation of motor. This circuit controls the 
speed of motor only. The PWM pulses (Fig. 7.3) turns on and turns off the MOSFET. 
In fact, the MOSFET control the average value of voltage applied to the armature and 
average value of armature voltage changes the motor speed. The diode is required to 
protect the MOSFET.

Control of DC Motors
Fig. 7.1 Direction of shaft rotation indicator
You can use a small sense resistor to measure the motor current (Fig. 7.4). Voltage 
across this sense resistor is proportional to the motor current. Sense resistor voltage is 
representative of motor current.
Let’s get started. Make the circuit shown in Fig. 7.2 and apply a gate pulse with duty 
cycle of 20% and frequency of 500 Hz (Fig. 7.3). Increase the duty cycle from 20% up 
to 80% with 10% steps and observe the change of DC motor speed. 
7.4
Control the Direction of Rotation 
The circuit shown in Fig. 7.5 can be used to control the direction of rotation of the motor. 
This circuit can’t be used to control the speed of the motor.
When the switch is in position A, transistor Q1 turns on and motor starts to rotate. Q2 
is in cut-off mode in this case. 
When the switch is in position B, transistor Q2 turns on and motor starts to rotate in 
the reverse direction. Q1 is in cut-off mode in this case. 
Let’s get started. Make the circuit shown in Fig. 7.5. Put the switch in position A and 
B and see how the circuit behaves. Measure the voltages of the circuit and compare them 
with hand analysis results.

Full-Bridge Driver 
L298 is a full bridge driver. You can use it to control the direction and speed of two 
separate DC motor. Operating supply voltage of L298 is up to 46 V and it can handle up 
to 4 A of current. L298 is used in closed-loop rotor position control systems as well.

Control of DC Motors
Fig. 7.4 Voltage of RSENSE is a representative of motor current
L298 pinout is shown in Fig. 7.6. The IN1 and IN2 pins control the direction of rotation 
for motor 1. Similarly, the IN3 and IN4 pins control the direction of rotation for motor 
2. PWM signal for ﬁrst motor is applied to ENA pin. PWM signal for second motor 
is applied to ENB pin. Armature of ﬁrst motor is connected to OUT1 and OUT2 pins. 
Armature of second motor is connected to OUT3 and OUT4 pins. Motor power supply is 
connected to VC and GND pins. VCC is connected to +5 V.
Let’s get started. Make the circuit shown in Fig. 7.7. Connect the ENA pin to a pulse 
with frequency of 500 Hz and duty cycle of 20% (Fig. 7.8). Increase the duty cycle from 
20% up to 80% with 10% steps and observe the change of DC motor speed. RSENSE can 
be replaced with a short circuit. Voltage drop across RSENSE is representative of motor 
current (upper V Su bscript u p er R s e n s e Baseline equals upper R upper S upper E upper N upper S upper E times upper I Subscript m o t o r).

experiment. Note that this time direction of rotation of the motor is the reverse of previous 
case.
Connect both of IN1 and IN2 to ground (Fig. 7.10) and repeat the experiment. What 
happens?
7.6
Speed Control of Universal Motors 
The universal motor is a type of electric motors that can operate on either AC or DC 
power. A dimmer (Fig. 7.11) can be used to control the speed of universal motors. Simu-
late the circuit shown in Fig. 7.11 and observe the waveform of different nodes. You can 
use a 484 Ω resistor as load. Don’t try to make this circuit on breadboard. Realization of 
this circuit requires a printed circuit board and it must be tested under the supervision of 
lab instructor.

Delay Circuits 
8.1
Introduction 
Sometimes you need to turn on/off a load with a certain delay after a speciﬁc event. For 
instance, consider the staircase corridor lighting system: when you press the key, the lights 
are turned on for a speciﬁc time (typically 2–3 min.). Then they turn off automatically. 
This chapter shows how different types of delay circuits can be made. 
8.2
Delay Circuit with Transistor (Normally on Circuit) 
The LED is on in Fig. 8.1. When you press the push button, the LED turns off for a 
while and it turns on again after a delay. Amount of delay is determined by the capac-
itor C1 and Thevenin resistance seen from its terminals. The potentiometer affects the 
Thevenin resistance seen from the capacitor. Therefore, we can say that amount of delay 
is determined by the potentiometer.
Make the circuit shown in Fig. 8.1. Measure the minimum and maximum delays 
that you can generate with this circuit. Replace the 1000 µF capacitor with a 2200 µF 
capacitor and repeat the experiment. What is the relationship between the results of two 
experiments? Use hand analysis to obtain a formula for the amount of delay. Explain how 
this circuit works.

8.4
Delay Circuit with 555 IC 
The mono-stable circuit shown in Fig. 8.3 can be used to generate delay. The output by 
default is at low level (i.e., 0 V). When you press the push button, the output becomes 
high (i.e., VCC) for duration of t eq uals  1 .1 ti mes upper R 2 times upper C 1. After  t eq uals  1 .1 ti mes upper R 2 times upper C 1, the output 
returns to low level.
Make the circuit shown in Fig. 8.3. Press the push button and measure the amount of 
delay that you observe after releasing the push button. Use an oscilloscope to observe the 
waveforms of the circuit.

Output of 555 can stimulate a relay. In Fig. 8.4 the red LED is on by default. When 
you press the push button the green led turns on for duration of t eq uals  1 .1 ti mes upper R 2 times upper C 1. After  
t eq uals  1 .1 ti mes upper R 2 times upper C 1 the red led turns on again.
Make the circuit shown in Fig. 8.4 and ensure that it works as expected.

Table A.4. We want to plot the graph of this data. We want to show the data points with 
circles and connect them together using dashed line with black color. The vertical axis 
and horizontal axis must have the labels “Current (A)” and “Voltage (V)”, respectively. 
The title of the graph must be “I-V for a resistor”. The commands shown in Fig. A.7 do 
what we need. The result is shown in Fig. A.8.

Exporting the Drawn Graph as a Graphical File 
You can copy the drawn graph to the clipboard easily with the aid of Edit > Copy Figure 
(Fig. A.12). After copying the graph to the clipboard you can easily paste it in programs 
like MS Word® by pressing Ctrl + V.
You can save the drawn graph as a graphical ﬁle as well. To do this, click use the File 
> Save As (Fig.  A.13). After clicking, the save as window appears. Select the desired 
output format from the Save as type drop down list (Fig. A.14).

Drawing Two or More Graphs on the Same Axis 
Sometimes you need to show two or more datasets on the same graph. You need to use 
the hold on command to show two or more graphs simultaneously. Assume that we have 
another dataset (Table A.5) and we want to show both datasets (Tables A.4 and A.5) on  
the same graph.

Fig. A.10 Output of code in Fig. A.9
The commands shown in Fig. A.15 draws the graph of both datasets on the same graph. 
Output of this code is shown in Fig. A.16.
You can use the Insert > Legend to show which graph belongs to which resistor 
(Fig. A.17).
After clicking the Insert > Legend, the legend shown in Fig. A.18 will be added to the 
graph.
Double click the data1 in the legend box (Fig. A.18) and enter the desired text. Repeat 
this for data2, data3 and data4 in Fig. A.18. You can move the legend box by clicking 
on it, holding down the mouse button and dragging it to the desired location (Fig. A.19). 
You can even right click on the legend box and use the predeﬁned locations (Fig. A.20).

Logarithmic Axis 
We used linear axis in order to draw the I-V graph of studied resistors. If you want to 
draw the frequency response graphs you need to use logarithmic axis. The linear axis is 
not a suitable option for frequency response graphs. 
Let’s study an example. Assume the frequency response given in Table A.6. This table  
shows the frequency response of the circuit shown in Fig. A.21.
The commands shown in Fig. A.22, draws the frequency response of the data in 
Table A.6. The command semilogx is used to draw the frequency response graph. Output 
of this code is shown in Fig. A.23.
