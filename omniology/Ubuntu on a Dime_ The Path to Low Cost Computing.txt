About the Author
IJAMES FLOYD KELLY is a freelance writer who lives in Atlanta, Georgia. He
has degrees in both English and industrial engineering because he couldn’t
decide between majoring in liberal arts or math and science. Fortunately,
technical writing uses both sides of the brain, and James has been able 
to write on a variety of topics, including LEGO robotics, free software, 
netbooks, and building a homemade CNC machine. James is the editor 
in chief of the number one LEGO NXT Robotics blog, The NXT Step (http://
www.thenxtstep.com). When not writing, he and his wife enjoy watching their little boy dis-
cover all kinds of new and exciting things about the world.

Acknowledgments
I’m one of those people who are always hoping that their skills are improving instead of rust-
ing. When it comes to my books, I have a great little collection of people at Apress who have
made certain that my writing skills are improving with every new title. Any positive feedback
you have for the book must be shared with Dominic Shakeshaft, Frank Pohlmann, Michelle
Lowman, Denise Santoro Lincoln, Harrison Sia, Ellie Fountain, and Nancy Sixsmith. My
Ubuntu on a Dime team kept this book on target and helped me track down all those pesky
technical, spelling, and grammar errors that many authors won’t admit ever happen. I’m not
one of them. I must yell loudly and proudly a huge “Thank you!” to all of them for the great job
they did in helping my book shine.
I now understand why so many authors thank their spouses for support during the writ-
ing of a book. Writing isn’t always a 9-to-5 job for me; it’s an up and down, when-the-muse-
strikes ordeal for me. Unfortunately, my wife is often scratching her head and wondering why
all of a sudden I have to be typing in my office late at night or rising with the chickens to get
working on a chapter. Thank you, Ashley, for your understanding and patience. The nomina-
tion for Wife of the Year is in the mail.
I have a home office that is very quiet at times. As someone who worked in an office 
environment for the first four years after graduating from college, I sometimes need some
background noise and hustle and bustle. When I have to get out of the house and actually
work, I head down to my favorite hangout and “second office,” Atlanta Bread Company, which
has free WiFi, free refills, and a staff who recognizes me and usually has my chocolate chip
cookie ready before I make it to the cash register. The music is quiet, the temperature is just
right, and the booths let me spread out and get to work. A huge thanks to ABC for a great place
“to get some writin’ done.”

Introduction
I will never—never!—purchase an expensive computer again. It’s getting almost as bad as
purchasing a new car. You drive it off the lot and it immediately drops 10 percent or more in
value. And when you buy new hardware and software, one week later the same computer is
$200 cheaper or—even worse—a newer model with more and better hardware is out and is
$300 cheaper! Argh!
I go through computers fast in my line of work. I wear out a laptop in about two years. My
desktop computer frequently has half a dozen or more operating system reinstalls in a year so
that I can take screenshots of the installation, test software compatibility, and more. I’m
always pulling out some piece of hardware to pop in a newer piece of hardware. (I’ve been
known to drop a piece of sensitive hardware—another trip to the computer store!) Costs start
to add up.
In late 2008, my test computer (nicknamed FrankenPC) died. The autopsy I performed
was inconclusive; I think the little desktop just lost the will to compute: RIP, FrankenPC.
I found myself sitting down and listing the things I wanted in a basic little desktop test PC:
• I wanted to keep the cost down. Under $250 would be great, but was it realistic?
• I needed to be able to access the Internet (a realistic expectation these days, right?).
• It would be one of three computers that I would use for e-mail: laptop, netbook, and
desktop.
• I needed some basic apps such as a word processor, spreadsheet, and such to run on it.
• I planned to use it to store my large music collection (more than 2,000 songs).
• I needed it to have a CD/DVD writer so I could back up my data to disc (and make
music CDs).
Not a whole lot to ask for, in my opinion. I went online and started my search with the
usual suspects: Dell, HP, and so on. But what I found was that the low-end computers they
were selling were still being packed with the latest/greatest hardware and a lot of software that
I didn’t really want or need. Why couldn’t I tell them the exact processor and amount of mem-
ory I needed as well as the speeds and specifications of the other hardware I wanted? I asked a
friend who keeps up on all the computer technology much more than I do. And (here’s where
the story gets interesting!) he dared me to build my own computer and satisfy my require-
ments including the low price. A dare? Is he kidding? Aren’t we both out of school?
After much deliberation and soul searching, I came to one simple conclusion: I would
accept his challenge and prove to all our colleagues that an inexpensive yet useful computer is
easy to build and install with loads of free software. 
Oh, and because I was writing another book for Apress at the time, I politely inquired
whether they might be interested in a book about building a cheap, no-frills computer. They
were interested. The story ends with the book you’re holding in your hands.
xix

It was a fun experience. There was the research required to keep my costs low—I found a
free operating system that I can’t wait to introduce to you. There were the numerous visits to
my computer store to shop for the ideal hardware components (I kept my receipts and have
provided you with the exact shopping list in Appendix A). There was the actual building of my
new computer: I wrote down everything and photographed all my steps so you can follow
along and build your own. And finally there was the installation of the free operating system
and testing of various applications (all free!) to make sure that my new computer worked. 
My new computer is sitting beside my desk and I use it daily; I check my e-mail, back up
my chapters as I write them, and listen to music and browse the Internet for my next book
idea. The final price? Two hundred dollars! You’ll have to keep reading to find out exactly what
I purchased and how it all came together, but I can promise you that building a similar PC is
within your grasp. For me, the days of spending huge amounts of money on the latest PC are
over; when I need a new desktop computer, I’ll build it myself, thank you very much. 
Are you ready to do the same thing? Have you decided that a new computer would be
nice? How about a new computer that has inside what you want at the price you decided on?
If this sounds great to you, welcome to Ubuntu on a Dime. You’ll have fun, save some money,
learn a new skill, and end up with a whiz-bang new PC to brag about. Don’t believe me? Keep
reading. I dare you.
IINTRODUCTION

The Hardware
First, the good news: every piece of software you’ll learn about in this book, including the
Ubuntu operating system, is 100 percent free—free to download, free to install, and free to use. 
I might as well go ahead and say that the software is also free to uninstall, free to love or hate,
free to complain about, and, of course, free to rave about to your friends and family.
And now the bad news: unless a major breakthrough in direct-to-brain downloading has
occurred as you read this, that 100 percent free operating system and software will need a
home. And that means a computer—a whirring, beeping, plugged-in personal computer (PC)
that contains a few basic components that are absolutely required for you to download, store,
and use the previously mentioned software.
But there’s more good news. It is no longer mandatory that you spend a bundle of money
to be able to install an operating system and all the software you know you’ll want to use. Let
me explain. 
In early 2007, Microsoft introduced its latest operating system, Vista, to the world. It then
promptly informed everyone that running the operating system properly would require some
hefty computer hardware requirements: more hard drive space than any previous operating
system, more memory, and a much faster processor. And those requirements were the mini-
mum just to run Vista; other limits existed. For example, if you wanted to have all the fancy
new graphics features, you’d have to invest in a faster (and more expensive) video card. It 
wasn’t uncommon to find users spending $500 or more on hardware upgrades. And in many
instances a completely new computer would need to be purchased if the user wanted to run
Vista; older computers simply didn’t meet the requirements.
Have you had enough? Are you tired of spending dollar after dollar chasing the dream of
the “perfect PC?” Are you looking for an inexpensive but scalable (upgradeable) computer that
can provide you with basic services such as e-mail, word processing, and Internet browsing?
And don’t forget other features, such as Internet messaging, VOIP (using your Internet connec-
tion to make phone calls), photo editing, and games. You shouldn’t have to skimp on any
services or features. Does this sound like a computer you’d enjoy owning and using?
If so, today’s your lucky day. Because I’ll show you how easy it is to put together your own
computer using inexpensive components. And because you won’t be spending any money on
software, you’ll have the option to put some (or all) of those savings into your new computer.
You might splurge and buy a bigger LCD panel (or a second LCD for multiple-monitor usage!)
or add some more memory so you can run more applications at once. Or you can spend the
bare minimum on hardware, keeping your expenditures low without skimping on software
and services. (And if you want to get some more life out of your existing computer, I’ll explain
how you can possibly give it a second life by installing Ubuntu to save even more money!)

C H A P T E R  1

This chapter is all about the types of hardware you’ll need to run Ubuntu as well as a good
collection of free software such as a word processor, calendar, e-mail application, and more. 
I gave this computer the nickname U-PC for purposes of talking about it throughout the
remainder of the book’s chapters. So, let’s get started building the U-PC.
Basic Components
You’ve probably heard the phrase, “Your mileage may vary,” and it’s no truer than when deal-
ing with different computer hardware settings running Ubuntu (or any operating system). 
But when it comes to the Ubuntu operating system versus the Windows operating system,
there is one large difference in hardware requirements: Ubuntu requires substantially less
“oomph” when it comes to the basic components you need inside your computer. By this, 
I mean you don’t need the fastest processor, a huge amount of RAM memory, or even a large
capacity hard drive. 
The recommended Ubuntu hardware consists of the following:
• 700MHz x86 processor 
• 384MB system memory (RAM) 
• 8GB disk space 
• Graphics card capable of 1024x768 resolution 
• Sound card 
• Network or Internet connection
Note that you don’t need an Intel 3GHz (gigahertz) Core 2 Duo processor with 2GB 
(gigabytes) of RAM and 500GB hard drive to install the Vista Ultimate operating system. You
can install the latest version of Ubuntu on cutting-edge hardware found in a computer from
2000. Back in 2000, a good computer might typically come with a 60GB hard drive, 512MB or
1GB of RAM memory, and a Pentium 4 processor; as well as a built-in network card, video, 
and sound on the motherboard. Surprised?
This means that it’s possible for you to install Ubuntu on your current computer (or an
older one you’ve packed away and hidden in a closet somewhere). Ubuntu doesn’t put a lot of
demand on hardware, so you can use your current computer or build your own, but avoid the
latest bleeding-edge technology (that also comes with a bleeding-edge price).
Not convinced? Okay, here’s where I put my money where my mouth is and show you just
how easy it is to build a computer that will run Ubuntu and hundreds more applications for
very little money. What’s even better is that I’m 99.9 percent certain that in five years this com-
puter will most likely run the latest version of Ubuntu. Can you say that about your current
computer and, say, Windows 2014 Home Edition?
In the introduction of this book, I mentioned that I wanted to build a basic computer that
would satisfy a number of requirements:
• It must cost me less than $250.00.
• It must allow me to access the Internet.
• It must also let me access my e-mail, either via the Internet or stored on my hard drive.
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
2

• It must provide me with basic productivity features: word processor, spreadsheet, and
slideshow-creation software.
• It must allow me to play music and create my own CDs or DVDs.
This list helps define the hardware I need to purchase to build my U-PC. What hardware?
Well, even if you’re not familiar with the inner workings of your computer, I’ll make this as
simple as I can for you.
Case
All computers require a case to hold the hardware; inside that case must be a power supply
that plugs into the wall and provides power to all the hardware that will be added inside 
the case. 
ITip Cases come in various shapes and sizes. You’ve probably seen desktop models in which the 
computer case sits on top of the desk and usually under the monitor or LCD panel. Tower cases are 
usually found sitting on the floor; they can be short or tall. There are also all sorts of odd shapes, colors,
and materials available for cases.
Inside the case you’ll always find a motherboard (MB) and a processor. A motherboard
can look intimidating (see Figure 1-15 later in the chapter), but it’s simply a component that
allows all the PC hardware to communicate. Think of it as Grand Central Station, in which all
your hardware must come together—and work together—to run the operating system and
applications that you install. One nice feature of most MBs is that they also can provide sound
and video and network connectivity. So you can see words and pictures on the screen, hear
music and any beeps your computer might make, and get connected to the Internet. (Sound,
video, and network connectivity can also be provided by separate hardware called peripherals
that plug into the MB, but they typically cost more money because they sometimes provide
more features.)
Memory and Hard Drive
All computers must have memory (also called RAM memory) and a hard drive added to store
information and work with it. There are better books out there on how computer hardware
components work, but just know that a computer hard drive retains all the information stored
on it when the power is turned off; the RAM memory can hold information when the com-
puter is powered and it provides that information to the processor (and you) faster than the
hard drive can do. 
CD/DVD Drive
I also need a CD or DVD drive (or combination of the two) to install any software that comes
on CD or DVD discs. And if I want to create my own CD/DVD discs by writing information to
them (also called burning), I need my drive to be the read/write (R-W) type. 
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
3

ITip The standard CD or DVD drive can only read discs, not write data or music. If you want to back up
your files to a disc or create your own music CDs, you’ll need a drive that can write data to discs. Look for a
drive labeled as RW. To add to the confusion, CD and DVD drives can be found in CD+RW, DVD+RW, CD-RW,
and CD-RW. The +/- symbols indicate a specific way that data is written to a disc by the drive and the type
of disc that goes in it. Purchase blank discs that match the drive type; for example, buy DVD-RW discs if you
have purchased a DVD-RW drive. Not sure which to buy? I recommend a CD/DVD combo unit that writes in
all formats; they are available! With this combo you can create music CDs (to play in your car, for example)
as well as back up your data to DVDs that can hold much more data than a CD.
Buying the Necessities
Add to this mix a handful of cables to connect everything together (which I’ll cover in more
detail later), and this is the list of parts I need to purchase for my bare-bones U-PC:
• Computer case
• Motherboard (with built-in video, sound, and network connectivity)
• CD/DVD-RW (read/write)
• Processor (AMD or Intel brands are perfectly suitable for Ubuntu)
• RAM memory
• Hard drive
Not a long list, is it? And what’s so great about buying hardware these days is that the stuff
is so compatible—almost all components have standard sizes and shapes that will fit perfectly
inside specific locations in the computer case. Memory chips have their own place on the MB
where they fit; and it’s the same with a hard drive and even the MB. There are always excep-
tions, however. For example, processors come in different sizes and shapes, and you must
make certain to buy a MB that will accept a certain type of processor; the place where the
processor is inserted is called a socket. (My recommendation is to always decide on the
processor you want to purchase first—it might very well be the most expensive part found in
the case—and then purchase the MB that is compatible.)
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
4

ITip When in doubt, always ask. Ask your salesperson if you’re buying the components locally. If 
you’re ordering online, call and ask questions before placing your order. Most reliable companies that sell 
hardware are glad to help you buy the proper components. (Always ask about the return policy—30 days 
for substitutions and 15 days for returns are reasonable expectations.)
Okay, I made my list and paid a visit to a local computer store. I had a salesperson help
me so I could be absolutely certain I was getting the right components. Note that a keyboard,
mouse, and monitor/LCD are not included in the overall price. A mouse/keyboard combo can
be purchased for about $10.00, and a monitor/LCD is a personal choice you’ll need to make
based on the size you want and the price you’re comfortable with. In my case, I had a spare
mouse/keyboard and an extra LCD panel from a much older retired PC.
INote Space prevents me from providing details on each and every hardware purchase I made or why
one component was selected over another. Computer building does require knowledge of how components
work together, and I’ll do my best throughout the chapter to explain my choices for purchasing a specific
component. But if you’re interested in learning more about how computers work and all the nitty-gritty
details on computer hardware, I recommend a visit to http://www.webfreebees.net/
howtobuildpc.html. You can find discussions there on all the components used in the U-PC—plus 
many more.
I purchased the following for a total of $203.00 (see Figure 1-1):
• 1 black case with built-in 300-watt power supply: $39.00
• 1 ATX motherboard (built-in video, sound, network card and AM2 socket): $44.00
• 1 AMD 1300 processor 2.3GHz for an AM2 socket: $44.00
• 1 Western digital hard drive, 160GM capacity: $39.00
• 1 Crucial RAM memory chip, 1GB capacity: $13.00
• 1 CD/DVD-RW: $24.00
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE

Figure 1-1. My U-PC components came in a variety of bags, plastic containers, and boxes.
Also included with the case are the power cord (to plug into the wall) and all the cables
that will connect to the components: the hard drive, CD/DVD drive, processor, and so on.
My overall goal, of course, was to keep my costs low while meeting the minimum hard-
ware requirements needed by Ubuntu (and listed earlier in the chapter). In many instances, 
it was impossible to purchase components near the recommended requirements; for exam-
ple, Ubuntu requires 8GB of hard drive space, but the smallest capacity hard drive I could find
was 80GB. The 160GB hard drive I ended up purchasing was only $5.00 more than the 80GB
drive, so I ended up spending a few extra dollars for double the storage space. This was also
the case with RAM—memory chips were not sold in anything less than 512MB, even though
Ubuntu requires only 384MB.
INote When purchasing a case, always make certain that it comes with a power supply. If it doesn’t, you
have to purchase one. Don’t skimp here—go for a minimum of 300 watts or higher. The power supply
comes with all the power cables that connect to your hardware components.
I might have all the parts of my U-PC, but until I put them together, they won’t be of 
much use. 
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE

Putting It All Together
If you’re going to follow along with my instructions and build your own U-PC, you might be a
little nervous or concerned, especially if you’ve never built a computer before. So let me reveal
a dirty little secret that most computer salespeople don’t want you to know: 
With a Phillips head screwdriver and a little patience, building your own PC is a piece of
cake.
I’m not kidding. Follow along with my steps, and when your U-PC assembly is done, I’m
betting you’ll be asking “Is that all there is to it?” (Okay, so maybe you won’t be asking that, but
I promise that it doesn’t get more complicated than the following steps, and I’m not a com-
puter building expert. If I can do it, so can you.) 
And here we go . . .
U-PC ASSEMBLY STEPS IN A NUTSHELL
1. Open all the components and sort them out, including any screws, cables, and so on.
2. Install the processor (and the processor’s cooling fan) on the MB.
3. Install the RAM memory on the MB.
4. Open the computer case.
5. Install the MB.
6. Install the CD/DVD drive.
7. Install the hard drive.
8. Connect all cables from the power supply to individual hardware components.
9. Connect a keyboard, mouse, and monitor/LCD, and turn on the computer for a test.
10. Close up the computer case.
Step 1: Taking an Inventory of the Components
This was actually a fun step—it felt like it was my birthday when I opened all the boxes and
bags and pulled out the shiny new parts. Figure 1-2 shows all the major parts of my U-PC.
They’re not so scary. (I left the MB and the processor in their protective containers; static elec-
tricity is a serious threat to some computer components and keeping them in their bags
protect them from static charge until needed. That little pop you sometimes get when touch-
ing a doorknob is enough to damage a MB or RAM chip, believe it or not. )
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE

Figure 1-2. All my U-PC components are opened and ready for assembly.
ICaution When dealing with computer parts, always be aware that small amounts of static electricity
have built up on your body. Even this small electrical charge is enough to damage some of these computer
components. To prevent this type of damage, I recommend that you always touch something to discharge
this static electricity (options include the metal external cover on the computer case or even a chair or table
leg). Do this occasionally as you build your computer. Don’t touch a monitor/LCD panel, however, because
screens are notorious for static buildup instead of removing a static charge.
Step 2: Installing the Processor and Cooling Fan
I opened the MB and set it carefully down on the foam that came in the bag. I also touched my
computer case to discharge any static electricity that might have built up. (The processor can
be installed on the MB only one way, so be sure to read the documentation that comes with
your processor and/or MB to determine the proper orientation and method for inserting your
processor.)
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
8

ITip When purchasing a processor, you’ll probably end up purchasing either an Intel or AMD product. Cost
is one factor; another is compatibility. All MBs come with a place to insert the processor. Because processors
come in different shapes and sizes, it’s important that you purchase a processor that matches the MB’s
processor slot. My MB provides an AM2 socket, so I purchased an AMD processor that fits in that AM2
socket. Make certain that your processor and MB sockets match. For more information on socket sizes and
types, visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_socket.
For my AMD processor, a small gold triangle in one corner (see Figure 1-3) matched up
with a small triangle printed on the MB. My instructions told me to lift up the lever on the
processor’s AM2 socket (also seen in Figure 1-3), place the processor in the socket, and then
press down and lock the lever. Figure 1-4 shows the processor inserted and the lever locked.
Figure 1-3. Lift the lever and insert the processor into the socket.
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE

Figure 1-4. After inserting the processor, lock down the lever.
Next, I needed to install the processor’s cooling fan. Processors get extremely hot, so most
processors are sold with cooling fans included. If your processor does not come with a cooling
fan, be sure to purchase one; without it, your processor will most assuredly be damaged by
heat and become useless. (This can happen in minutes, days, or hours, but it will happen, so
be warned.)
INote When installing a cooling fan on top of a processor, documentation will frequently tell you to place 
a small amount of thermal paste on top of the processor before placing the cooling fan on top. Thermal 
paste can be purchased inexpensively from most computer stores. My cooling fan came with thermal paste
already applied to the surface of the fan that touches the processor; check with a salesperson to see if yours
does as well.
I followed the instructions that came with my processor and clamped the cooling fan
down on top of the processor, as shown in Figure 1-5. A small locking arm (not visible in the
figure) ensures that the fan is clamped down securely.
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
10

Figure 1-5. Install the processor’s cooling fan as described in the processor’s documentation.
Finally, I needed to connect the cooling fan’s power cable to the MB. Figure 1-6 shows the
cable connected (consult your MB’s documentation for the location of this plug). The cooling
fan’s plug is written on my MB and is easy to locate: it says CPU FAN (visible in Figure 1-5).
Figure 1-6. The cooling fan gets its power from the motherboard.
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE

Step 3: Installing RAM Memory
Installing RAM memory is super easy. Figure 1-7 shows one of the memory slots with the
clamps opened. (My slots are labeled DIMM1 and DIMM2.) I inserted the chip(s) in the lowest
slot first (DIMM1 in this instance). You can see DIMM2 labeled in Figure 1-9, but DIMM1 is
obscured in Figure 1-8.
Figure 1-7. Open the clamps on a memory slot before inserting a chip.
Memory chips typically have a notch along the bottom edge (see Figure 1-8). This 
notch helps determine the proper way to insert the RAM memory chip (it fits in the slot 
only one way). 
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
12

Figure 1-8. The memory chip fits only one way in the slot.
Figure 1-9 shows the RAM memory inserted. I pressed down firmly (but carefully) on the
chip; the clamps closed and locked in the chip automatically.
Figure 1-9. The clamps close and lock in the 1MB RAM memory chip.
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE

Step 4: Opening the Computer Case
My case has two sides that can be removed. How did I know which side to remove? Although 
I could remove both, I opened the side that allowed me to install the MB. (Once the MB is
installed, the other side can be removed.) To find the right side, I looked on the rear of the case
and opened the side farthest away from the slot and/or open bay shown in Figure 1-10. I sim-
ply removed the screws holding it and slid the side panel off. (Your case might use clips or
some other method in place of screws; most cases are not complicated, so just look carefully
and you should be able to determine how to remove the side.)
ITip Earlier I mentioned that MBs and processors should be matched when it comes to the socket used 
by the processor. Well, your MB should also be matched to your computer case; it is called a form factor.
Fortunately, today’s cases are fairly typical in size (called an ATX form) and most MBs are, too. But just to be
certain, make sure to verify that the form of your MB will fit inside your case. Visit http://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Motherboard_form_factor for more information.
Figure 1-10. Locate the screws and remove one side of the computer case.
After removing the lid, I took a look inside. The inside of the case should look somewhat
similar to the one shown in Figure 1-11. (My computer’s power cord to plug into the wall was
stored inside the case, but isn’t shown in the figure.) If your case does not come with a power
supply already installed, follow your power supply’s instructions for connecting it to the case.
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
14

Figure 1-11. The computer case is open and ready for parts to be added.
If your MB comes with a small faceplate such as the one shown in Figure 1-12, insert it by
pressing it against the bay opening (shown in Figure 1-10) from the inside. It should snap into
place, as shown in Figure 1-13.
Figure 1-12. Some motherboards come with a faceplate like this one.
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
15

Figure 1-13. The faceplate must be inserted in the case before connecting the motherboard.
Step 5: Installing the Motherboard
Figure 1-14 shows the case with all the cabling moved out of the way. (Notice that there 
are a handful of mounting posts on the exposed side of the case.) 
Figure 1-14. Mounting posts hold the motherboard securely to the case.
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
16

I carefully inserted the MB into the case (it’s usually safe to grip it by the cooling fan and
then lower it in), aligned the holes on the MB with the mounting posts, and used the screws
that came with the case to secure the MB, as shown in Figure 1-15. (In some instances, not all
mounting posts will be used, and some might not match up exactly; use as many as you can.)
Figure 1-15. Screws and mounting posts hold the motherboard securely to the case.
Step 6: Installing the CD/DVD Drive
I popped out one of the black panels on the front of the computer case (see Figure 1-16). 
I then reached inside the case and gently pushed against the panel—it popped out easily. This
is where the CD/DVD drive will be inserted. (If you have multiple bay choices, pick the one
you like best. I chose the top one because my case will be placed on the floor when in use.)
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
17

Figure 1-16. Pop out one of the case’s front bay panels for the CD/DVD drive.
Next, I inserted the CD/DVD drive in the slot, as shown in Figure 1-17.
Figure 1-17. Insert the CD/DVD drive into the open bay slot.
I used the screws that came with the case to secure the CD/DVD drive to the case. To do
this, I removed the other side of the case. With both sides open, I could insert the CD/DVD
drive (and the hard drive in the next step) and secure them with screws on both sides, as
shown in Figure 1-18. 
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
18

INote For both the CD/DVD and the hard drive, I highly recommend using as many screws as possible to
secure them. Both drives contain spinning parts and over time the subtle vibrations they cause can loosen
screws and/or cause a drive to move around. I used four screws per CD/DVD side (see Figure 1-18) and had
no problems; likewise, I used two screws per side for the hard drive (see Figure 1-19).
Figure 1-18. Use screws to securely connect the CD/DVD to the case.
Step 7: Installing the Hard Drive
The hard drive is inserted in the case from the inside. (You might have to experiment with
locations for the hard drive because it will share a cable with the CD/DVD drive that connects
to the MB.) For this reason, I chose to mount the hard drive in the highest drive spot in the
case, as indicated in Figure 1-19. After I inserted the hard drive, I connected it to the case
using only two screws per side, not three. If you have the option to connect using three 
screws per side, I highly recommend it.
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
19

ITip Hard drives and CD/DVD drives connect to the MB using a special cable—typically either a SATA
cable or an IDE cable (but others do exist). SATA drives and cables allow for faster data transfer, but cost
more. Always check your MB specifications to determine whether it will support IDE or SATA (or both) and
purchase a matching CD/DVD and hard drive. Your hard drive will typically come with the proper cable to
connect it and the CD/DVD drive, but double-check this when you make the purchase. (Some MBs also
include the proper cable.)
Figure 1-19. Use screws to securely connect the hard drive to the case.
Step 8: Connecting the Cables
There are lots of cables in the case, aren’t there? This step can be the most frustrating, but 
with some patience and a checklist (provided as follows), it’s not as difficult as it looks. The 
following must be connected and receiving power:
• The MB must be given power.
• The processor must be given power.
• The hard drive and the CD/DVD drive must be connected to the MB with special cable:
either IDE or SATA (see previous Tip).
• The hard drive and CD/DVD drive must be given power.
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
20

• The power button and miscellaneous lights on the case front must be connected to the
MB. (The miscellaneous lights are not required to be connected, but most motherboard
documentation provides easy-to-follow instructions for this. Be patient; sometimes the
connectors are small and can be tricky to connect.)
• Any USB ports on the case front must be connected to the MB.
• The case speaker must be connected to the MB.
• The case fan must be connected to the MB for power.
First, I connected power to the MB. The connector (shown in Figure 1-20) has a special shape
that fits in only one place on the MB. Figure 1-21 shows the plug where the MB connector
attaches. Again, don’t force it; the connector is shaped so that it connects properly in only one
way (this is the same for all other power connectors, too).
Figure 1-20. The ATX motherboard power connector looks like this one.
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
21

Figure 1-21. The ATX motherboard power connector plugs in here.
I found the secondary power connector coming from the power supply that fits the loca-
tion shown in Figure 1-22. There’s only one connector that has this shape, and the plug is
located close to the processor.
Figure 1-22. The secondary power connection
I then located the special data cable shown in Figure 1-23. This data cable is used to con-
nect the CD/DVD and the hard drive to the MB. There should be a red line along one edge
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
22

(other colors are possible, too). When this cable is connected to the CD/DVD and the hard
drive, the colored line must be facing the power connection on those drives (but again, the
cable can really be connected only one way, so don’t worry if your cable doesn’t look exactly
like this one). 
Figure 1-23. The CD/DVD and the hard drive use this IDE cable to connect to the motherboard.
One end of my data cable was blue; I located the blue plug on the MB and made the con-
nection (see Figure 1-24).
Figure 1-24. Connect the CD/DVD and hard drive cable to the motherboard.
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
23

Next, I connected the hard drive to the data cable using the connector in the middle of
the cable. I connected the remaining connector (on the end of the cable) to the CD/DVD
drive. (You might have to move the CD/DVD drive and/or the hard drive to get them close
enough for the cable connectors to properly connect; another option is to purchase a longer
data cable from a computer store.) Figure 1-25 shows my data cable connected to both drives.
Figure 1-25. The data cable is connected to the CD/DVD drive and hard drive.
The CD/DVD drive and hard drive must now be given power. I located the power 
connectors, called Molex connectors (see Figure 1-26). 
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
24

Figure 1-26. Molex connectors provide power to the CD/DVD drive and hard drive.
I found two Molex power cables and connected them to the CD/DVD drive and the hard
drive, as shown in Figure 1-27.
Figure 1-27. The Molex cables are connected to the CD/DVD drive and hard drive.
The case has a small cable like the one shown in Figure 1-28. This cable connects the
power button and lights on the front of the case to the MB.
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
25

Figure 1-28. The case’s power button and lights are controlled by this cable.
There’s a plug located on my MB labeled PANEL1 where this connection was made. Con-
sult your MB’s documentation if you have any difficulty locating where this cable will connect.
Figure 1-29 shows the cable plugged in.
Figure 1-29. Plug in the case’s power button and light controlling cable.
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
26

If your case has one or more USB ports on the front (my case does), you have to locate 
the cable(s) coming from the front of the case and plug them into the MB. Look carefully at
Figure 1-29; you should see some connections labeled USB1 and USB3; the USB cable(s) con-
nect to them. Figure 1-30 shows my USB cable plugged into USB3. (If you have only one cable,
it can plug into any of the USB connections with no problem.)
Figure 1-30. Plug in the USB cable to one of the USB connectors.
The last two things to connect were the case’s speaker cable (coming out of the front of
the case) and the case’s rear fan. Figure 1-31 shows where these two final connections were
made. On my MB, they are labeled SYS FAN and AUDIO. (Consult your MB’s documentation
for these locations if you’re having trouble finding them.)
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
27

Figure 1-31. The case’s fan and speaker need to be connected to the motherboard.
Figure 1-32 shows the case’s speaker cable connected, and Figure 1-33 shows the case’s
fan cable connected.
Figure 1-32. Connect the speaker cable to the motherboard.
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
28

Figure 1-33. Connect the case’s fan to the motherboard.
Step 9: Testing the U-PC
I connected a keyboard, mouse, and monitor; plugged in the computer; and then turned it on.
Because there was no operating system installed, I saw a warning message (see Figure 1-34).
This message simply says that the computer doesn’t know where to find its operating system,
or at least a bootable CD/DVD. (This process will be handled in Chapter 2.)
Figure 1-34. The U-PC tells you it needs an operating system installed.
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
29

TROUBLE WITH YOUR U-PC?
If you followed the steps along with me, did you get some other errors? First, look inside and make certain
that both fans are spinning—the one on the processor and the one built into the power supply. You might not
be getting power. Is there a light on the front of the case? Usually one of the lights blinks on and off to indi-
cate the hard drive is working, but many errors cause the light to stay solid. Go back and check all your
connections: make sure that all power cables are pushed in correctly (and tightly) and that the data cable is
properly connected to the hard drive and CD/DVD drive. Make certain that the motherboard and processor are
both receiving power from the power supply (refer to step 8) and that you used the proper power connectors
in the proper locations.
Other methods for verifying a working U-PC include ensuring that the LED light on the ATX motherboard
is lit (indicating that power is being received by the MB), checking that the BIOS setup is accessible (check
your MB’s documentation), and finally booting up a working Ubuntu operating system from the CD (see 
Chapter 2 for more details).
Is the computer still not working? Don’t panic. Computers are fairly rugged these days, and the most
likely problem is a loose or improper connection, or a cable that has been plugged into the wrong location.
Start by returning to step 8 and double-checking all your connections—you might even consider unplugging
everything and starting over. Your power supply most likely has unused power cables; feel free to use a 
different power connector—maybe the one you were using doesn’t fit properly or is just “bad.” The thing 
to remember is that you have a minimum number of components to check and it’s likely that you'll find the 
culprit during a second visit.
If after you double- and triple-check the connections your computer is still not working, you have a few
options. If you purchased your computer parts locally, you might call the store and ask if you can bring it in
for someone to quickly look over. My local computer store has some really helpful employees who enjoy
helping customers solve problems. If you bought the parts online, however, you might have to resort to hav-
ing your computer looked at by a professional. (I know that’s not the answer you want to hear, but consider
how much money you're saving by buying the parts and building the computer yourself. Hiring someone at 
a reasonable hourly rate to look over your work can help find the problem and you’ll most likely learn some-
thing, too. And the total cost of your U-PC plus a technician’s fee will still be less than what you’d spend on 
a new computer from a store, right?)
Another resource is a local Linux user group. These groups usually consist of Linux hobbyists and 
professionals, and members are usually very patient and helpful with new Ubuntu Linux users trying to get 
a computer working and ready for an Ubuntu installation.
Step 10: Closing the Computer Case
This step is easy; I just put the case sides back on and screwed them down securely. (You can
reconnect them using whatever method your case uses for keeping the sides from falling off.)
All that’s left is to move the U-PC to its final location. Well, almost . . . it’s time to begin the
next part of the process: installing an operating system. 
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
30

What’s Next?
Congratulations! If you’ve gathered the parts and assembled them as I’ve described, you’ve got
a great little computer that’s ready for a great operating system: Ubuntu. In Chapter 2, I’ll pro-
vide you with detailed steps for installing Ubuntu on your new computer. After the operating
system is installed, the sky’s the limit, as they say. So much software (free software!) is waiting
for you to download, install, and use: business software, productivity software, game software,
and more. 
But I’m getting ahead of myself; first you’ll get Ubuntu installed on your new U-PC and
learn a little more about how it works. (And if you’re a Windows user, you’ll be pleasantly 
surprised at how easy the transition is to Ubuntu.) 
CHAPTER 1 I THE HARDWARE
31


The Ubuntu Operating System
Whether you have decided to build your own U-PC, as I described in Chapter 1, or elected
to use an existing computer, this chapter will provide you with the basic information you need
to obtain the Ubuntu operating system and install it on the PC of your choice.
In the pages that follow, I’ll provide a detailed walkthrough of the screens you will en-
counter during the installation and the desktop you will see after the operating system is up
and running. But before all this can happen, you have to obtain a copy of the Ubuntu operat-
ing system (OS). There are three ways to do this, and they are covered in detail in Appendix B
at the end of this book. 
After you obtain your CD or DVD containing the Ubuntu installation files, grab a chair
near your computer and let me show you how amazingly easy it is to get Ubuntu installed and
working.
An Installation Overview
There’s nothing complicated about installing Ubuntu. In fact, if you’ve ever performed an
installation of the Microsoft Windows operating system, you’ll be shocked at how simple and
fast the Ubuntu install is when compared with its Windows counterpart. 
INote An Ubuntu installation doesn’t always go smoothly, but the U-PC hardware I purchased (covered 
in Chapter 1) is fully compatible with Ubuntu, and the installation I performed and will cover shortly went 
off without a hitch. I’ll show you in a bit how to test Ubuntu on your own computer without installing any files
on your hard drive, which lets you take the OS for a test drive and ensures that certain things are working
before you move forward. And, just in case there are problems, I’ll provide some troubleshooting tips at the
end of the chapter as well as some web sites you can visit for help.
Following is a short summary of what will happen in this chapter. Each of the following
steps in this summary will then be covered in more detail later in the chapter:
1. Inserting the Ubuntu CD/DVD in the CD/DVD drive and turning on the computer
2. Selecting the language
3. Trying Ubuntu first without making any changes to the computer
33
C H A P T E R  2

4. Testing various items: sound, video, and network connectivity
5. Configuring the hard drive partition
6. Installing Ubuntu files on the hard drive
7. Logging in
8. Taking a tour of Ubuntu
INote You might need to configure the motherboard’s bootup settings to check for a CD/DVD inserted in
the CD/DVD drive. Consult the motherboard documentation for instructions on setting the boot device order.
This setting simply defines the order in which the computer will look for operating system files to load; 
typically you want your operating system to be started from a hard drive, but with a new computer there 
is usually no data on the hard drive. So you must tell your computer to look for OS files on a CD/DVD.
Your Ubuntu CD/DVD will contain the proper files for it to start up. (This is covered in more detail in the next
section.)
Ubuntu Installation
If your U-PC is built and ready to go, it’s time to get Ubuntu installed. For purposes of this
chapter, I’ll use the term U-PC in the steps, but don’t let that confuse you—if you’re using an
existing computer, just perform the same steps.
Step 1. Inserting the Ubuntu CD/DVD and Turning on the Com-
puter
The Ubuntu CD/DVD is also called an Ubuntu Live disc, so it can run the Ubuntu operating
system from the disc itself and doesn’t require installing any files on your hard drive. This is a
perfect way to test the operating system’s user interface and see how you like it. But it also
offers you the ability to test the U-PC’s hardware to see whether there are any compatibility
issues.
Begin by turning on the U-PC. You haven’t inserted the Ubuntu CD/DVD yet, so once the
computer has booted up, you’ll see the message shown in Figure 2-1.
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
34

Figure 2-1. The U-PC lets you know that it doesn’t have an operating system installed.
Why Ubuntu uses the word FATAL is a mystery; in fact, the U-PC is just fine. It’s the rest of
the message that tells you what you need to know: No bootable medium found! (Your error
message might differ—various motherboards have different warning messages when bootable
files aren’t found.)
To fix this, you simply have to provide the U-PC with some bootable files (the Ubuntu
CD/DVD will provide them). Open the CD/DVD drive tray, place the Ubuntu disc on the tray,
and close it. Next, turn off the U-PC and then turn it back on. (I configured my U-PC mother-
board to look at the CD/DVD drive for a bootable disc before examining the hard drive for
bootable files.) Lo and behold, the CD/DVD drive will begin to spin, and the little light on the
front will flicker. Something’s happening.
Step 2. Selecting the Language
Next, you’re presented with a selection screen similar to the one shown in Figure 2-3. It’s a list-
ing of all the languages supported by Ubuntu. Use the up and down arrow keys to choose the
language and then press the Enter key. (At this point during the installation, the mouse won’t
work; use the up and down arrow keys to make selections.)
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
35

Figure 2-2. Select the language you want to have Ubuntu use from the list provided.
Step 3.Trying Ubuntu First Without Making Changes to the 
Computer
After the language is selected, Ubuntu displays a simple screen (see Figure 2-3). For now,
ignore everything but the first option in the list labeled Try Ubuntu without any change to
your computer. (It should be selected by default and displayed in white letters; all other
options will be displayed in an orange-brown color. Use the up and down arrows to select 
this option if it’s not already selected.)
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
36

Figure 2-3. Selecting the first option lets you test Ubuntu without risk to your computer.
After making the selection, the CD/DVD drive begins to read files on the disc; Ubuntu is
preparing to launch its desktop. This could take a few minutes or more; because files are not
stored on your hard drive, all the information that the U-PC needs to run Ubuntu must be
obtained from the disc and stored in RAM memory. 
If there are any problems with Ubuntu running on your computer, you might see an 
occasional message on the screen. For now, just let the computer try and complete the
Ubuntu desktop launch. If all goes as planned, the desktop opens, as shown in Figure 2-4 
(and you should be able to use your mouse and keyboard).
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
37

Figure 2-4. A clean Ubuntu desktop should appear on your screen.
INote The U-PC booted up from the Ubuntu Live disc with no problems, and the desktop appeared with 
no error messages. If any errors are reported during the bootup, write them down; later in the chapter I’ll
give you some options for different bootup configurations you can try, and these error messages might help
you find a solution.
Step 4.Testing Various Items: Sound,Video,Network Connectivity
Once the Ubuntu desktop is up and running, it’s time to try out a few things. Don’t be afraid to
click around and experiment; it’s very difficult to do anything wrong when running Ubuntu
from the CD/DVD—just don’t click the Install icon on the desktop yet. Later in the chapter, I’ll
go over all the various menus and icons you see on the desktop, but first you should explore.
Before installing Ubuntu, you should perform three tests: video screen (the monitor or
LCD), sound (the speakers), and Internet connectivity.
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
38

The video screen is easy: the desktop is in full color, and clicking the menus along the top
of the screen opens and closes them. The motherboard provides a video signal to the LCD
panel, so you’ll be able to make sense of what you see on the screen.
Next, make sure that you can hear sounds and music from the speakers. To do this, 
double-click the Examples folder on the desktop (see Figure 2-4). Inside the Examples folder 
is a collection of sample files that test various applications. Find a file called fables_01_01_
aesop.spx, as shown in Figure 2-5. Although the music bars are a huge hint that this is a sound
file, the .spx file extension is used by the sound application that comes packaged with the
Ubuntu installation (see Chapter 12 for more information).
Double-click the file and—sound! It’s a narration of one of Aesop’s Fables and it’s crystal
clear. So sound checks out.
INote If you’re not getting any sound, first make sure that your speakers are powered and plugged into
the correct port on the back of your U-PC. Also check that the volume knob isn’t set to zero or the lowest
setting. If you’re still not getting any sound, I provide some web sites and suggestions at the end of this
chapter for troubleshooting problems and finding help.
Figure 2-5. Find the Aesop’s Fables sound file (with the .spx extension).
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
39

The last test is to make certain you can access the Internet. If you have a broadband
modem that lets you connect to the Internet, connect the network cable from the modem to
the back of the U-PC. Now it’s time to see if Ubuntu will let you browse the Internet.
To do this, click the small icon indicated in Figure 2-6. This icon launches Firefox, a free
web browser that comes packaged with the Ubuntu installation files. I’ll cover Firefox in 
more detail in Chapter 9, but for now all you want to do is make sure that you can get to the
Internet.
Figure 2-6. Firefox verifies that the Internet connection is working.
Firefox opens up; enter http://www.apress.com (this publisher’s web site). After a few 
seconds, the web site appears (see Figure 2-7).
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
40

Figure 2-7. Opening a web site lets you know that Ubuntu is working.
This is great! Ubuntu appears to recognize the video, sound, and network hardware com-
ponents. And you can use the mouse and keyboard, too. You know that the CD/DVD drive
works because it loaded up Ubuntu. Now, all that’s left is to prepare the hard drive to install
the actual Ubuntu files on it. And to do that, you need to perform one more action from within
Ubuntu: partitioning the hard drive.
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
41

Step 5. Partitioning the Hard Drive 
You need to make certain that the hard drive is working properly. To do this, click the System
menu, select the Administration option, and then click Partition Editor on the flyout menu, as
shown in Figure 2-8.
Figure 2-8. Select Partition Editor from the System menu’s Administration section.
The Partition Editor opens, as shown in Figure 2-9. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
42

Figure 2-9. Use the Partition Editor to prepare the hard drive for Ubuntu.
My U-PC has a blank hard drive with 160GB of free space; yours might have more or less.
Don’t let this bother you; as long as you have a minimum of 8GB, you should be fine. Before
that space can be used, however, a partition must be created in which the operating system
will be installed. 
Partitions can be a confusing topic, but fortunately Ubuntu and the Partition Editor han-
dle most of the decisions for you. Think of your hard drive as a pie; uncut, the pie represents
all the storage space on your hard drive lumped together in one big container with the Ubuntu
operating system installed and all your files. It’s one partition. But you can cut that pie up into
sections, with each section set aside for a particular purpose—this is called partitioning. You
can create a section for storing just your music files, for example, or even another section that
can run an entirely different operating system! (This is called dual booting, and a PC like this
will boot up and allow you to select which operating system you want to use.)
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
43

ITip Another consideration is the file system type. Windows and Linux don’t use the same file system
types. Windows usually uses NTFS, whereas the most common file system for Linux is ext3. Linux also
needs a swap partition, which is really just a relatively small part of the hard drive acting as extra memory.
Ubuntu community documentation has a nice explanation of file system types here: https://help.
ubuntu.com/community/LinuxFilesystemsExplained. It also has a swap partition FAQ here:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq. When in doubt, let the Partition Editor handle things 
for you!
By default, the Partition Editor offers up the entire hard drive as one big container with 
no other sections. This is fine, and this is the method I’m using for my U-PC. But if you want 
to split your hard drive into say two sections of 80GB each (for a total of 160GB), you’ll need to
read through the Help documentation provided with Partition Editor. Click the Help menu
and review the instructions for creating a new partition.
INote Why does Figure 2-9 show 5.30GiB (gigabytes) of space, not 160 gigabytes? To take screenshots 
of the Ubuntu install, I used special software called a virtual machine (VM) that allows me to perform an
Ubuntu install on an existing computer’s hard drive. I set aside 5.3GB of space (more than enough) on the
computer’s hard drive, and the VM software treats it as an unallocated hard drive for me to install the Ubuntu
files. In reality, I performed the same steps on my real U-PC, but the Partition Editor shows 160GB of unallo-
cated space, which is exactly what I expected.
To create a partition, click the line describing the partition to highlight it (indicated by the
mouse arrow; refer to Figure 2-9) and then click the Partition menu and select New, as shown
in Figure 2-10.
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM

Figure 2-10. Select unallocated space and then choose New to create a partition.
A warning message appears, as shown in Figure 2-11. It is not a concern for this U-PC
because the hard drive has no data on it, but if you’re using an existing PC, be aware that any
data you haven’t backed up will be erased. Click the Create button to proceed. 
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
45

Figure 2-11. A warning message lets you know that any data on the hard drive will be erased.
Select the Partition menu again and click New. This time, a different window appears (see
Figure 2-12).
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
46

Figure 2-12. Create the partition that will hold the Ubuntu operating system.
Change the default Filesystem setting to ext3 and click the Add button; this process cre-
ates a Primary Partition in which the operating system’s files will reside (as well as any other
files you create and save). The Partition Editor screen changes (see Figure 2-13), and the words
New Partition #1 appear.
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
47

Figure 2-13. The partition is created and ready for Ubuntu to be installed.
Finally, click the Partition box (labeled New Partition #1 in Figure 2-13) and click the
Apply button. You’ll see a final warning message asking whether you’re certain you want 
to continue (shown in Figure 2-14). Click the Apply button to finalize the creation of the 
partition.
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
48

Figure 2-14. Creating the partition is not reversible.
Exit out of the Partition Editor by selecting the GParted menu and selecting Quit. This
returns you to the Ubuntu desktop. Now you’re ready to install Ubuntu on the hard drive.
Step 6. Installing Ubuntu Files on the Hard Drive
On the desktop is an icon labeled Install (refer to Figure 2-4). To install Ubuntu, you can 
simply double-click that icon, and the process begins.
A Welcome screen appears, as shown in Figure 2-15. Select the language (again) from 
the left side of the screen and click the Forward button to continue.
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
49

Figure 2-15. Select the language as the first of seven steps to install Ubuntu.
On the Where are you—screen shown in Figure 2-16, use the mouse to click the map and
zoom in to your approximate location. The time zone will update based on your selection.
Click the Forward button to continue.
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
50

Figure 2-16. Use the map to select your location and time zone.
Now select the keyboard layout. Choose USA and click the Forward button to continue
(see Figure 2-17).
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
51

Figure 2-17. Select the proper keyboard layout for your computer.
Next, you’re asked whether you want to do any additional partition work on the hard drive
(see Figure 2-18). You already created the primary partition and don’t need to make any
changes, so click the Forward button to accept the default settings and continue. You’ll see a
warning that the changes cannot be undone. Click the Continue button; the hard drive spins 
a little, and the light blinks on and off for a few seconds—something good must be happening!
(The hard drive spinning and the little light blinking tells you that files are being copied from
the Ubuntu install disc to the hard drive, and things are proceeding as planned.)
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
52

Figure 2-18. Check that the partition is selected.
On the Who are you? screen (see Figure 2-19), provide your name, a login name, a pass-
word (typed twice for verification), and the name of the computer. 
For names I use jim, jim, and jim-laptop. Because I’ll be sharing this computer with
another user (my spouse), I leave the box labeled “Log in automatically” unchecked and click
the Forward button.
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
53

Figure 2-19. Ubuntu needs some information to create a user account.
Next, you see a summary of all the information provided or selected (see Figure 2-20).
Click the Install button and let the installation proceed.
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
54

Figure 2-20. Click the Install button to complete the installation of Ubuntu.
INote You might have noticed that the window shown in Figure 2-20 jumped from Step 5 of 7 (seen in
Figure 2-19) to Step 7 of 7. You didn’t do anything wrong and you didn’t miss a step. Because only a Primary
Partition was created back in Step 5, Step 6 was skipped. What is Step 6? If you choose to break your hard
drive into multiple partitions, you will select in Step 6 on which partition to install the Ubuntu operating 
system boot files.
After you finish, the window shown in Figure 2-21 opens. (All in all, it took about 30 min-
utes for me to complete step 1 to step 6. The actual file copying took about 15 minutes on my
U-PC.)
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
55

Figure 2-21. Restart the computer to get Ubuntu up and running.
Click the Restart now button and remove the Ubuntu disc from the CD/DVD drive. The
computer will reboot and present you with a new login screen.
Step 7. Logging In
When Ubuntu first starts up, you see a username screen, as shown in Figure 2-22. Usernames
are case sensitive, and after you type in your username (refer to Figure 2-19), you’re asked to
enter your password. If you provide the correct information, Ubuntu opens up to the familiar
desktop and is ready to use.
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
56

Figure 2-22. Provide a username and password to log in to Ubuntu.
Step 8.Taking a Tour of Ubuntu
If you’re at all familiar with Microsoft Windows or any other operating system with a graphical
user interface, Ubuntu won’t take long for you to learn to use. You click the left mouse button
to select and drag items, you double-click the left mouse button to open files, and you right-
click a file to see a flyout menu with additional options.
Let’s take a quick look at some of the options available to you on the Ubuntu desktop,
starting in the upper-left corner of the desktop (shown in Figure 2-23).
Figure 2-23. A handful of menus and icons are available on the Ubuntu desktop
In the upper-left corner are three menus and three small quick launch icons. From the
left, the menus are Applications, Places, and System; followed by a small icon for the Firefox
web browser (covered in Chapter 9), an e-mail icon to launch the Evolution e-mail application
(see Chapter 4), and the Help icon to launch the built-in Ubuntu Help Center.
Click the Applications menu (shown in Figure 2-24) and you’ll see seven preconfigured
categories in which your applications can be organized, as well as an Add/Remove button
that, well, lets you add and remove applications. Moving your mouse over a category launches
a flyout menu that provides a list of possible applications for you to launch.
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
57

Figure 2-24. Menus can contain categories with applications and other tools.
The Places menu (shown in Figure 2-25) has many uses. Not only does it provide short-
cuts to popular folders on your computer (such as the Music folder or the Documents folder),
but it’s also useful if you have multiple computers at your home or office with shared drives 
or folders. You can also access shared drives, folders, and files from this menu.
Figure 2-25. The Places menu gives you quick access to folders and network locations.
The System menu (see Figure 2-26) gives you access to the administrative tools needed to
manage the Ubuntu computer. If you have ever used the Control Panel found in Microsoft
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
58

Windows, many of the items found in this menu should be familiar. The Preferences category
has many options: you can change your wallpaper, set a screensaver, enable Bluetooth
devices, and more. 
The Administration category (also seen in Figure 2-26) controls more of the global options
of Ubuntu that affect not only you but also any users on your computer. You can add new
hardware, create new user accounts, change the system date and time, and more. 
Figure 2-26. The System menu contains dozens of administrative tools.
INote There are entire books written just on the Ubuntu operating system and how to use it (see Appendix C).
Also available are web sites that provide help to everyone from novice to guru (also found in Chapter 12 and
at the end of this chapter). This book provides only a summary of how to navigate the Ubuntu operating 
system and to launch and use some of the included applications. If you have questions about any aspect of
Ubuntu, the answers are out there, including more detailed coverage of each and every tool available in the
System menu. Start by searching the Help Center (covered later in this chapter); you might be surprised by
how much detail is provided there and on the official Ubuntu web site at http://www.ubuntu.com.
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
59

Returning to the Ubuntu quick launch icons to the right of the System menu, clicking either
the Firefox or Evolution icon shown in Figure 2-23 will launch that application. Each of these
applications is covered in its own chapter (Evolution in Chapter 4 and Firefox in Chapter 9), so
please feel free to jump ahead if you want to begin using those applications now. Clicking the
Help icon opens up the Ubuntu Help Center (see Figure 2-27).
Figure 2-27. The Ubuntu Help Center is a useful tool as you begin using Ubuntu.
The Ubuntu Help Center is fully searchable using keywords: enter the keyword in the text
box near the top and then press the Enter key. You’ll be provided with a list of possible articles
related to your query. You might also click individual topics along the left edge that can be
used to view articles describing how to perform specific actions within Ubuntu. Finally, links
are provided so you can submit your own questions or search for them on external web sites
and forums if you can’t find what you’re looking for in the Ubuntu Help Center.
Now let’s look at the upper-right corner of Ubuntu (see Figure 2-28).
Figure 2-28. Additional icons on the Ubuntu desktop provide information on running services.
Starting from the left, you might or might not see the downward-pointing arrow with the
exclamation mark on your desktop, but if you do, click it once. This icon will appear when
there are updates to the Ubuntu system available. Many of these updates are security related
and are released to protect your operating system from malicious sources such as viruses or
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
60

attacks via an Internet connection. As you can see in Figure 2-29, after I clicked the Update
icon, a new window opened, informing me that I have 219 updates that should be installed.
This isn’t out of the ordinary for a new installation of Ubuntu, and if you have a broadband
connection, it won’t take long for the updates to be installed.
Figure 2-29. I have a lot of updates that need to be installed on my operating system.
The next icon from the left looks like two small computer screens overlapping. This Net-
work icon gives you access to any of your network hardware, as well as the ability to configure
it. If, for example, you install Ubuntu on a laptop that has both a wireless network card and a
standard network card that uses a cable, you can use this icon to switch between the two by
clicking it once and selecting the appropriate card.
To the right of the Network icon is the Sound icon; you can increase or decrease the vol-
ume of your speakers or mute the sound by clicking this icon once. Right-click the icon for
additional options.
Finally, the date and time are provided. Click the date/time button to view the calendar or
right-click the button to change the date or time, or perform other options.
The username of the person currently using Ubuntu is also available (refer to Figure 2-23).
This is useful if multiple users will access a computer running Ubuntu; a quick glance can tell
you if someone else has logged you out and logged in with a different user account.
The last item to cover on the Ubuntu desktop is seen in Figure 2-30. This is the status
panel that is running along the bottom edge of the screen. It shows any current windows that
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
61

are open (for example, Figure 2-30 shows that the Update Manager window is open, as shown
in Figure 2-29). The button on the far left of the status panel, when clicked, will minimize 
(or hide) any open windows on the screen. It’s a nice feature when you have a lot of clutter on
your desktop; click the button and then find the window you want to use listed on the status
panel. Click that window, and only that item will open on the desktop.
Figure 2-30. The status panel runs along the bottom edge of the desktop.
On the far right of the status panel are two small rectangles. One rectangle is shaded; it
represents the desktop screen you are currently viewing. If you click the other rectangle, you
can create a new “virtual” screen—it’s like having a second monitor or LCD panel connected
to your computer. (The only difference is that you must toggle back and forth between them
instead of seeing them both at the same time.)
ITip If you right-click either rectangle and choose the Preferences option, you can create up to 36 virtual
screens! 
The final icon on the far right of the status panel is the Trash icon. You can drag and drop
files on this file and they’ll be kept there until you empty it (by right-clicking and choosing
Empty Trash). Click the icon once and it will open, allowing you to view any files that have
been sent to the Trash.
And that’s the desktop! Ubuntu is extremely easy to use—most menu selections are fairly
self-explanatory (and there’s always the Help Center if you can’t figure out how to use an
option). But Ubuntu by itself really isn’t all that useful. Applications are where you’ll be doing
most of your work, and that’s the focus for the remaining chapters in the book. I’ll be covering
many of the applications that came preinstalled with the Ubuntu installation in later chapters,
but for now, feel free to take some time and get to know the Ubuntu operating system. Click
some menus, launch some tools, and become familiar with how the OS operates.
Troubleshooting
Ubuntu is a very stable operating system. Problems during installation are rare, and if you do
encounter them, there are some useful options available to push past any roadblocks and
continue forward with the installation. 
First, take a look at Figure 2-31 and then I’ll explain some of the options to you.
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
62

Figure 2-31. Ubuntu provides tools for troubleshooting an installation.
One of the first things you can do before beginning your installation is to select the fourth
option in the list, labeled “Check CD for defects.” Yes, sometimes a small scratch or defect on
the surface of the disc can cause all sorts of problems. Selecting the “Test memory” option will
make sure that your computer has the proper amount of RAM memory installed for Ubuntu to
operate properly. These are simple quick tests you can perform before beginning the install.
What I call the troubleshooting power tools are found along the bottom edge of Figure 2-31.
The F1 key (Help) does provide help, but it can be overly technical and (quite honestly) not as
much “help” as you might need. The F4 key (Modes) is a frequent solution to many install
problems because it deals with the video display. Display problems can cause many issues
with an Ubuntu install, and an easy solution to push through is to select VGA as the video
type. (Once you’ve got Ubuntu up and running, you can at least use the operating system
while investigating why your video card isn’t displaying at the proper resolution.) Again, 
display resolution is a common problem, so try this.
Finally, if you’re having real difficulties getting Ubuntu to install, pressing F6 (Other
Options) will give you access to some expert-level options. My recommendation is to post any
error messages you might encounter during the install to one of the Ubuntu technical discus-
sion forums (visit http://www.ubuntu.com/support/communitysupport); many of the Ubuntu
experts who provide online help to new users will offer advice that involves the options found
by pressing F6.
My final bit of advice is this: don’t let Ubuntu frustrate you. Most of the time there’s a solu-
tion for pushing past an install problem. Members of the Ubuntu user community are proud
of this operating system, and they want it to grow and flourish and find new users. That said,
the community has experts who are friendly and knowledgeable and willing to help you if you
give them the chance. Be polite, be descriptive in typing up the problem, and be patient, and
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
63

you should find a super-helpful collection of Ubuntu fans offering up advice to get you up and
running.
What’s Next?
Your Ubuntu installation comes with a nice collection of preinstalled software—all of it free.
But what does “free” really mean? Are there hidden costs? Who pays for this software? And
what else is available? 
Before I begin covering specific software that works with Ubuntu, however, I’ll take a
short break in Chapter 3 and talk about types of free software, how to find it, where to get it,
and some of the challenges in using it. Free software doesn’t mean free of bugs, however, and
you have to be able to distinguish the junk from the jewels. You’re already off to a good start
with a 100 percent free operating system, and my aim in Chapter 3 is to show that you might
very well never have to pay for software to install on Ubuntu . . . ever.
CHAPTER 2 I THE UBUNTU OPERATING SYSTEM
64

Free Software Defined
I hope you now have the Ubuntu operating system installed and are beginning to wonder
about the possible uses it can provide. But if you’re not yet convinced that a free operating 
system can compete with a big name operating system (BNOS), maybe this chapter (and the
remaining chapters) will finally convince you to install Ubuntu.
Have you taken a look at the prices of software these days? Productivity applications 
(such as Microsoft Office) can easily exceed $300.00, and the most popular photo editing and
graphic design applications are pushing $500.00 and higher! And what about the personal
finance software that’s supposed to help you monitor your bank account and get control of
your spending? You’ll be forking out $70.00 or more for those types of applications.
Or maybe not. Ever since someone slapped a price on a piece of software, someone else
has offered a competing product for less—often for free. And it’s that last part that this book is all
about. In Chapter 1, I managed to build an ultra-low-cost computer (the U-PC); in Chapter 2, 
I showed you how to install a 100 percent free operating system on it. 
Can you continue to keep the expenses down as you load up the U-PC with software?
Of course! 
How? 
Keep reading. 
Application Types
I’m oversimplifying this a bit, but keep in mind that there are four types of software:
• Pay-to-use software (whether you pay a flat fee or a subscription)
• Open source software (with no hidden costs—nothing, zero, nada, zip)
• Cloud computing software (free, but possibly with a catch)
• Freeware (free, but with no guarantees of quality or virus-free installation)
I’ll be providing a little more details in a bit to help you better distinguish between the
four types. But for now, I need you to understand that when it comes to software, you have
two options: you can pay for the software you use or you find free alternatives. Many people
find a nice balance between the two, paying for software that they “can’t live without” and
loading up free software that they find on the Internet.
65
C H A P T E R  3

INote I don’t count pirated software that you might get from your third cousin’s best friend’s part-time
auto mechanic as free. Don’t steal software—there’s simply no reason for it because tons of free applica-
tions exist that can probably do the job.
So, I’ll now provide more details about those four software types and explain how to 
distinguish between them.
Pay-to-Use Software
This section won’t be long, I promise. With pay-to-use software, you visit your local computer
store or a big name chain store, find a box containing the software you want to install on your
computer, and your bank account balance is then lowered anywhere from $20.00 to $600.00. 
Another version of pay-to-use software is found when you visit a company’s web site, 
provide your credit card information, and then download the software immediately using
your broadband connection. (Sometimes you have to wait for the company to actually send
you the software on a disc—anxiously checking your mailbox daily for its arrival.) With the
downloadable software, you get no CD/DVD disc, no printed manual, and no pretty box with
color graphics on the front. Would you believe, however, that you’re probably charged the
same amount of money as if you’d purchased the boxed version from a brick-and-mortar
store? It’s happened to me! You’ll typically get no explanation for why you’re not getting a 
discount for saving them packing and shipping costs.
Finally, there’s another version of pay-to-use that’s even more devious: subscription 
software. You pay a one-time product initiation fee (typically large) to get the software and
then you pay a weekly/monthly/yearly subscription fee (sometimes also referred to as a 
maintenance fee) to keep using the software. 
INote Sometimes this fee can be a valid cost, such as for an antivirus application. The company provides
regular updates to the software because of the 500 new viruses that are created each day. But most often,
this is simply another money maker for the big software companies (see Figure 3-1).
CHAPTER 3 I FREE SOFTWARE DEFINED
66

Figure 3-1. Most antivirus applications charge a yearly subscription fee.
CHAPTER 3 I FREE SOFTWARE DEFINED
67

Believe it or not, the current rumors buzzing around the technology world are that sub-
scription software is the future of software: you won’t buy software anymore; you’ll “rent” it.
Miss a payment and that software might very well uninstall itself from your computer, requir-
ing a completely new purchase (with that large product initiation fee) before starting up with
the subscription fees again.
Shocked? Angry? Confused? Yes to all three? Well, let me put your mind at ease and let you
know that there are individuals, teams, and companies out there determined to fight subscrip-
tion fees every step of the way. And they’re doing this by creating free applications that are
competing with the big name applications (BNAs).
Open Source Software
Open source software is the real deal: quality software that you can have at zero cost, with no
advertisements or hidden subscription fees, no spyware that installs itself on your computer
and monitors your activities, and no weekly e-mail asking you to upgrade to the latest version
for a small fee.
ICaution You can perform a Google search using the keywords “free software” and you’ll get more than
200 million hits (try it). Sadly, most of the “free” software you’ll find isn’t free. There is shareware software
that you can download and use for 30 days (free), but often it has some features disabled that come alive
only when you purchase the full version. There is also trialware software that does give you the full version
of an application (usually for 30 days or less), but locks up when the trial period ends. And the worst scam 
of all is the software labeled “free” that allows you to download and install the software (for free), but 
doesn’t run until you submit credit card information. Add to all this subterfuge the fact that free software
often has viruses and other malicious software hidden inside. The lesson here is that “free software” can
often be misleading and sometimes even downright dangerous to the health of your computer. So beware!
How do you find the real deal? Well, the two words I want you to keep in mind as you
move forward in the book are open source. I won’t drown you with philosophical or theoretical
discussions on the meaning of open source; if you’re really interested, I highly recommend
that you visit http://www.opensource.org/ (see Figure 3-2) and spend some time learning
about the concept, how it works, and why it’s important to you.
CHAPTER 3 I FREE SOFTWARE DEFINED
68

Figure 3-2. Open Source Initiative is a great resource for learning about the open source 
movement.
For now, however, the term open source should be something you always add to your
Google search when looking for software: “open source games,” “open source finance soft-
ware,” “open source recipe software”—get the picture?
Free software does exist that is not labeled open source, and you’ll have to do some research
on your own to determine whether there are any risks involved with downloading and installing
it, not to mention determining whether it’s actually free (see the next section for more informa-
tion). But it’s the open source stuff that’s typically safe to download, safe to install, and safe to
use. Why? Because open source software doesn’t hide its inner programming (also called code)
from the public. It’s free to examine for errors and malicious code; the open source program-
mers allow this as a way to improve, troubleshoot, and verify their software. (Of course, you
ideally need to be a programmer to verify the code—I’m not a programmer, but all I have to do 
is a quick Google search on the application and I can quickly determine whether there is any-
thing shady going on with the application in question.)
Much of the software covered in this book (and that comes bundled with the Ubuntu
installation) is open source: OpenOffice.org (similar to the Microsoft Office suite of applica-
tions, as seen in Figure 3-3), GIMP (a photo/graphics editor), and Evolution (an e-mail app)
are all open source. But what about the software I cover that isn’t open source? Well, that falls
into the third category of software.
CHAPTER 3 I FREE SOFTWARE DEFINED
69

Figure 3-3. OpenOffice.org offers a bundle of applications to compete with Microsoft Office.
Cloud Computing Software* (always read the small print)
Don’t you just hate asterisks and “the small print?” During the installation of most software,
you’re typically stopped at some point to acknowledge a user license agreement or some legal
mumbo-jumbo: “Click the Yes button to accept the agreement or the No button to cancel the
installation.” (Even open source software has this agreement, but 99.9 percent of the time it’s
to make sure you acknowledge the fact that the software is to remain free.)
Believe it or not, a lot of free software exists that is high in quality and won’t cost you a
penny. Cloud computing is all the rage these days, and if you think you don’t know what it is,
you’re probably wrong. Let me explain.
Do you use your Internet connection to check your bank balance (also called Internet
banking)? (Even if you don’t, you’re probably familiar with the concept.) When you visit
http://www.myownpersonalbank.com and enter your username and password, the screen dis-
plays your current balance, maybe the last dozen checks you’ve written, and perhaps a few of
your debit card charges at the local coffee shop. Is that financial information you’re viewing
stored on your computer’s hard drive? Probably not. Instead, that information is kept secured
(hopefully) on a hard drive owned by your bank. That hard drive might be down the road, in a
different state, or even possibly in a different country! But by providing a simple username
and password, your web browser presents your personal financial information to you on the
screen with possible options that include printing a statement, transferring funds from a
checking account to savings, and even viewing scanned images of your checks (see Figure 3-4).
CHAPTER 3 I FREE SOFTWARE DEFINED
70

Figure 3-4. Clicking the camera icons lets me view my checks.
This is an example of cloud computing, where the cloud is the Internet. You use your
computer’s web browser and Internet connectivity to use software applications that exist 
on computers located “somewhere else.” Besides Internet banking, cloud computing examples
include web-based e-mail (such as Google Mail, Hotmail, and Yahoo! Mail), video streaming
(YouTube is the big name here: http://www.youtube.com), and even online gaming such as
playing poker with human players from around the world. These services don’t require you to
install software on your computer; you simply enter the web address (URL), the web site loads
the required application in your web browser, and away you go.
CHAPTER 3 I FREE SOFTWARE DEFINED
71

ICaution Cloud computing does have one very large risk. Because you’re often accessing personal infor-
mation that’s for your eyes only (banking, e-mail, and so on), your connection to the service provider is only
as good as the password you’re using. If your username is your first name, and your password is your
spouse’s birthday (the mm/yy format is popular, such as 0401 for April 1), how easy do you think it might 
be for a bad guy to gain access to your information? (You should also be aware that teenagers are master
password crackers, so maybe #1Dad isn’t the best password, huh?)
But if so many of the cloud computing applications don’t cost any money, you might
already be wondering how businesses that offer these services can do so for free. And that’s
where the asterisk comes in.
Most cloud computing services that are free to you (the customer) are paid for by adver-
tisers. Sometimes these advertisements are small and unobtrusive, maybe hidden in the
lower-right corner of the screen where you will never notice them. Other times, the advertise-
ments exist as banner ads that run across the top of the page (and sometimes down both sides
and in the middle, as shown in Figure 3-5.)
Figure 3-5. Find all the advertisements and you win a prize.
One of the biggest cloud computing service providers is one you already know: Google.
Google offers so many free services via web browsers that I’ve stopped counting. It has a word
processor app, a spreadsheet app, a web design app, an e-mail app . . . and the list goes on.
(See Chapters 10 and 11 for more information on some of Google’s free apps.)
CHAPTER 3 I FREE SOFTWARE DEFINED
72

I mentioned earlier in the chapter that rumors are all pointing to software moving to a
subscription format. Well, the rumors are also pointing to more and more cloud computing
applications appearing. This means you’ll soon be seeing pay-to-use-cloud-computing as
companies begin to figure out how to charge you money for what is typically available today
for free but is advertiser-sponsored. 
Freeware (or Everything Else)
The last bit of free software that I want to cover doesn’t really fall under the open source or cloud
computing umbrella. This software, which is typically labeled freeware, can be found all over the
Internet by doing a Google search for “freeware.” But beware—you’ll get millions of search
returns for that label, and most of them aren’t worth a click of your mouse to investigate. 
Freeware is most often created by a single individual who has an idea to create some-
thing, usually for personal use. After the little application is developed, the developer often
puts it out on the Internet for anyone and everyone to use. But there’s usually a big catch: 
freeware often comes without documentation, technical support, or even instructions for
installing! You’re often on your own when it comes to downloading the free flotsam that is
scattered over the Web.
Freeware apps also come with large security risks; these applications are often infected with
viruses that can damage your files, your operating system, and sometimes even your hardware.
Other freeware apps are nothing but digital Trojan horses (called spyware). They often come dis-
guised as free little games or “productivity” applications that make your life easier (yeah, right!) 
If you download and install a freeware app that has spyware embedded inside, you open your-
self up to all sorts of trouble. The least damaging spyware tracks the web sites that you visit and
reports back to the company that created the software; this information can be sold to other
companies that buy lists of prospects who might like their products. The most damaging form 
of spyware can track things such as passwords and credit cards used for online purchases. 
Not all freeware is malicious, but you have to be careful out there when it comes to down-
loading and installing software on your computer. When it comes to locating freeware, it helps
to know a bit more about exactly what you’re looking for, and that can often be just as easy as
it is difficult. In these instances, I always recommend that you use some of the more trust-
worthy sites on the Internet that collect, scan, and review freeware. Sites such as http://
appnr.com/ allow you to search for freeware based on category. It still makes sense to investi-
gate any piece of freeware you download (including scanning for viruses), but sites such as
this one are often safer than doing a Google search and downloading the first app you find
that meets your need.

What’s the Answer?
I now return to the original question posted at the beginning of the chapter: how can you keep
expenses down when it comes to software for your U-PC? Now that you’re aware of the differ-
ent types of software and the potential costs with some of them, do what I do and ask yourself
two questions: when should I pay for software and when should I look for free software?
The answer to both questions really comes down to a personal choice. I like playing com-
puter games, and many of the game titles I want to play cost money. Yes there are free games,
but they’re typically not as complex and well-developed as the pay-to-use titles (but some-
times I’m pleasantly surprised by a free game). So, in this case, I don’t mind spending money
sometimes to get the software I want, especially if there simply isn’t a competing product.
But there is a lot of competition for other things I use my computer to do: word process-
ing and photo editing, for example. I don’t have $400.00 to drop on the most popular photo
editing software, but I’ve found that Picasa (see Chapter 8) not only provides what I need in a
photo editing app but many people (including me) also believe that it’s better than the pay-to-
use, big name software!
The remaining chapters in this book introduce you to some alternative applications that
are applying some competition to the BNAs. Read through the chapters, examine what the
software does and how it performs, and ask yourself this question: “Can this application pro-
vide me with the features I need?” If the answer is yes, you’ve taken a good step forward in
further reducing your computer expenses.
FREE SOFTWARE WEB SITES
There are a ton of web sites out there that collect free software and allow you to search using keywords
and/or categories—a good example is SnapFiles (http://www.snapfiles.com), shown in Figure 3-6.
But be careful with these kinds of web sites—what they list as “free” can often mean free to download and
install for a period of time. In other words, they offer trialware, and you’ll have to pay to keep using it.
One form of free software you’ll probably encounter on these sites is shareware. This type of software is
usually provided on the honor system (you’re asked to pay a small fee or make a donation if you like the soft-
ware and want to continue using it.) I like SnapFiles because it has two tabs in the top-right corner (Freeware
and Shareware) that immediately get you to 100 percent free versus trialware/shareware.
Services such as SnapFiles do a good job of filtering out the junk as well as scanning the free stuff for
viruses and other malware, but don’t always assume that’s the case. With any software you download from
these types of sites (or anywhere, actually), always run a virus scan to make sure that the installation files
are clean.
CHAPTER 3 I FREE SOFTWARE DEFINED
74

Figure 3-6. Web sites such as SnapFiles collect free software for visitors to sift through.
What’s Next?
Finally! You’re ready to start using some of the great free software that comes bundled with the
Ubuntu installation. One reason why the Ubuntu installation is so nice is that because the
software is already installed for you, you can immediately start using it and avoid the entire
issue of installing and troubleshooting it (e-mail, web browsing, word processing, photo edit-
ing, and more). In a couple of instances, however, newer versions of some of the applications
exist, and I’ll show you how to upgrade to the latest versions in their respective chapters.
Chapter 4 starts with coverage of the 100 percent free, open source, e-mail application
called Evolution. And even though I use Google Email 90 percent of the time (see Chapter 10),
I do maintain a couple of older e-mail addresses using Evolution. I love this application, and 
I think you’ll find it an impressive alternative to the pay-to-use e-mail apps. Let’s get started.
CHAPTER 3 I FREE SOFTWARE DEFINED
75


E-mail Revolution
I run a variety of applications on my computer, including a word processor, web browser, and
music player. But the one application that I seem to use the most is for e-mail. I use e-mail so
much that when I went on vacation last year and didn’t have Internet access, I think I actually
went through e-mail withdrawal for a few days. 
Our reliance on e-mail has become as common as phone and television access. Kids these
days probably can’t imagine that there was a time when e-mail didn’t exist. And for some of us
aged 25 and older, it’s getting hard to remember how we ever got by without it. 
I don’t think it’s an overstatement to say that e-mail has changed our lives. Short of a
phone call (or using a chat program for instant messaging), e-mail is the fastest way to com-
municate with someone next door or on the other side of the planet. Where documents and
pictures and other types of files used to have to be mailed in an envelope (at the mercy of the
postal service), now these documents are simply included with an e-mail.
Your new U-PC is now installed with Ubuntu (see Chapters 2 and 3). A large number of
applications have also been installed on the computer, absolutely free. And tucked nicely into
that collection is a superb little e-mail application called Evolution with a list of features that
will surprise you.
Evolution Overview
The Evolution application included with the Ubuntu installation runs seamlessly with the
operating system and can be minimized on the desktop when you don’t need to use it. It uses
a simple user interface that is intuitive to grasp, and technical help is just a mouse click away.
Evolution is your one-stop shop for the following:
• E-mail: Send/receive messages, apply filters, create folders, and identify and block spam
• Calendar: Create appointments, set reminders, and invite participants
• To-do list: Organize your thoughts and create tasks immediately so you don’t forget
• Contact list: Maintain e-mail, phone numbers, mailing addresses, and more for your
contacts
Like some users, you might find that you only need to send and receive e-mail; if that’s the
case, the calendar and to-do list sections later in the chapter can be skipped. I do recommend
that you read the contact list section, though, because sending e-mail is a lot easier when you
don’t have to commit someone’s address (such as john.a.smith.jr@traditionalcarsandtrucks.
com) to memory (or the phone number and mailing address).
77
C H A P T E R  4

Similarly, even if you use the web-based e-mail system Google Mail (Gmail, which is cov-
ered in Chapter 10), you’ll find that Evolution can download your messages and give you access
to them even when you’re not online. (Gmail supports POP, which allows applications such as
Evolution to grab messages and download them to your computer instead of accessing them
from a web browser.) Evolution also provides a nice calendar application for your U-PC. 
INote I’m making two assumptions in this chapter. One is that you have an e-mail address that you
already use, possibly provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), employer, or other entity. If you don’t
have an e-mail address, contact your ISP; it can provide the steps (or web site) for creating an e-mail
address for your personal use.
The second assumption is that you understand basic e-mail terminology: send, receive, attachment,
spam, and so on. Certain sections of the chapter might go into a little more detail about these subjects, but
the purpose of this book isn’t to teach you how to use e-mail, but how to use Evolution for e-mail. If you
need help on the basics of e-mail, I recommend a visit to http://communication.howstuffworks.
com/email.htm.
Before you begin using Evolution, you’ll have to specify some settings that will allow it to
send and receive messages and perform other tasks. If you’ve installed Ubuntu on your U-PC,
you’re ready to begin.
Configuring Evolution
The first time you open Evolution, the application detects that it has not yet been configured.
A wizard will lead you through the simple process, so follow along with the steps and screen-
shots, and Evolution will be up and running in no time. 
From the Ubuntu desktop, locate and click the Evolution icon, as shown in Figure 4-1.
Figure 4-1. The Evolution application can be launched quickly using this icon.
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
78

The first time you click this icon, a configuration wizard runs; after Evolution has been
configured, you can click this icon to open the application or click Applications ® Internet ®
Evolution Mail (also seen in Figure 4-1). Either method opens the application.
Next, the Evolution Setup Assistant screen appears, as shown in Figure 4-2. Press the
Enter key to continue.
Figure 4-2. Evolution Setup Assistant opening screen
INote Depending on your computer’s video resolution, some of the configuration screens might appear
large, such as the one shown in Figure 4-2. This can cause some buttons to not appear on the screen (for
example, the Forward button mentioned in Figure 4-2). In those instances, hitting the Tab key jumps you to
the next button or text field, and pressing Shift+Tab jumps to the previous button or field. In this instance,
you can use the reverse jump to select the proper button that might not be visible—in most instances, it is a
Next, Continue, or Finished button. This is definitely one of the items that Ubuntu developers have to fix in
future versions of the operating system.
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
79

The next screen is the “Restore from backup” option seen in Figure 4-3. Because this is the
first time you’ve used Evolution, you’ll skip this step. Simply press Enter to move to the next
screen.
Figure 4-3. Restoring a backup of your e-mail is an option, but not for this first configuration.
The next screen is the Identity screen (see Figure 4-4). 
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
80

Figure 4-4. Evolution uses your identity information when you send e-mail.
For Figure 4-4, enter your e-mail address, leave the box labeled “Make this my default
account” checked, and then enter your e-mail address again in the Reply-To field. Click the
Forward button (if you can’t see the Forward button, press the Tab key four times and then
press Enter.)
Evolution won’t do you much good unless it can both receive and send e-mail. Figure 4-5
shows the Receiving Email screen, in which you select the type of server that Evolution will
use to download your e-mail from the Server Type drop-down menu. If you are uncertain
about this, contact your ISP (or other organization that is providing you with an e-mail
address) and ask which type to use: POP, IMAP, Microsoft Exchange, or other. 
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
81

Figure 4-5. You must select a server type for receiving e-mail.
Figure 4-6 shows that I selected POP. I also provided a server (pop.secureserver.net, but
yours will most likely be different) and my username, which my ISP informs me is simply my
username. I don’t have to configure the security or authentication items shown in Figure 4-6,
but your e-mail provider might require you to use them (configure them based on your
provider’s instructions).
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
82

Figure 4-6. The Receiving Email configuration screen
INote Again, the information you will use for the screen shown in Figure 4-6 will be slightly different, but
90 percent of the time it will be POP, IMAP, or Exchange Server. Some servers require only a username, not a
full e-mail address as I supplied; check with the organization providing your e-mail address for the proper
server type and configuration details.
Click the Forward button. (If you cannot see the Forward button, do this: place a check in
the box labeled “Remember password” and then uncheck it again. Now press the Tab key three
times and press Enter. If the box is already checked, uncheck it and recheck it, press Tab three
times, and then press Enter.) Figure 4-7 shows the Receiving Options screen you’ll see next.
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
83

Figure 4-7. Configure settings for received e-mail on the Receiving Options screen
You can increase or decrease the time interval for Evolution to check for new messages.
The default is 10 minutes and works fine. (I don’t recommend decreasing it to anything less
than five minutes.) If you place a check in the box labeled “Leave messages on server,” copies
of every e-mail you receive will be stored remotely until your maximum storage space is
reached (in my case, 1GB) or deleted if you check the box labeled “Delete after x day(s).”
Press the Forward button to continue. (If you cannot see the Forward button, place a
check in the box labeled “Disable support for all POP3 extensions” and then uncheck it again.
Now press the Tab key three times and then press Enter. If the box is already checked, uncheck
it and recheck it, press Tab three times, and then press Enter.) Figure 4-8 shows the Sending
Email screen you will see next.
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
84

Figure 4-8. The Sending Email configuration screen
Once again, you need to determine the server type to use; your options are either SMTP
or Sendmail. Most e-mail providers use SMTP, but you should inquire about the proper set-
tings for this window. As you can see, I selected SMTP and provided a name for the Server
field. 
Click the Forward button to continue. (If you cannot see the Forward button, place a
check in the box labeled “Remember password” and then uncheck it again. Now press the Tab
key three times and then press Enter. If the box is already checked, uncheck it and recheck it,
press Tab three times, and then press Enter.) 
Figure 4-9 shows the Account Management screen. You can change the text in the Name
field if you like—this screen is useful if you want to have Evolution check multiple e-mail
accounts and want to be able to distinguish them easily. I changed my information to
Ubuntu-Work as shown in Figure 4-9. Click the Forward button (or press the Tab key three
times and press Enter).
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
85

Figure 4-9. Provide a description in the Account Management screen.
On the next screen, use your mouse and click the map to indicate your location; your time
zone is selected. Click the Forward button (or press the Tab key three times and press Enter).
Figure 4-10 shows the conclusion to the Evolution Setup Assistant. Click the Apply button
(or press Enter.)
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION

Figure 4-10. The Evolution Setup Assistant is complete.
Evolution now opens, as shown in Figure 4-11. The remainder of the chapter will show
you how to use all the tools that Evolution provides.
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
87

Figure 4-11. Evolution’s user interface is ready to go.
Using Evolution E-mail
This section shows you how to send and receive e-mail as well as how to send file attachments.
Checking for E-mail
By default, Evolution contacts your e-mail provider every 10 minutes (refer to Figure 4-7) to
check for waiting mail to be downloaded. You can choose to manually check for e-mail, no
matter the time interval, by clicking the Send/Receive button (refer to Figure 4-11).
When you click the Send/Receive button, you might see a window pop up (similar to the
one shown in Figure 4-12). This window asks for the e-mail account password. Enter the pass-
word and click the OK button. Until you log off, this password needs to be provided only one
time; Evolution remembers the password for subsequent e-mail checks.
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
88

INote Back in Figure 4-6, I could have provided the password but I prefer that anyone opening up Evolu-
tion not be able to download my mail automatically; feel free to provide your password if you don’t want to
see this password screen every time.
Figure 4-12. Evolution requires a password to download e-mail messages.
You see a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 4-13. Evolution checks with your 
e-mail provider to see whether any messages are in the queue awaiting download. New 
messages will appear in the Inbox.
Figure 4-13. Evolution displays a progress bar while downloading any e-mail messages.
Unread e-mail appear in your Inbox in bold (refer to Figure 4-11).
Sending E-mail
There are four ways to send e-mail, described in the following sections.
Creating a New Message
Click the New button shown in Figure 4-11. A blank e-mail opens, as shown in Figure 4-14. 
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
89

Figure 4-14. Blank e-mail message
Enter text in the lower portion of the screen. If you want to apply formatting to the text,
select HTML from the drop-down box labeled Plain Text (indicated in Figure 4-14). Selecting
HTML provides additional formatting features, as shown in Figure 4-15. Hover your mouse
pointer over any of the buttons and a small “hint” balloon appears and describes that button’s
function. 
Figure 4-15. Formatting can be applied to e-mail text.
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
90

To send an attachment (or multiple attachments), click the Attach button shown in 
Figure 4-15. A The Insert Attachment screen appears (see Figure 4-16).
ITip The technical editor of this book pointed out that you can also drag and drop a file into the message
portion of the screen; an attachment is automatically created. If you have a folder open on your screen with
the desired file visible, just drag it over to the body of your e-mail and drop it in—easy!
Figure 4-16. Attachments can be easily added to any message.
Use the left side of the screen (labeled Places) to browse to the location of the file(s) you
want to attach. Select the file from the list on the right side of the screen and click the Attach
button. (Multiple files can be selected by holding down the Ctrl key.) In Figure 4-16, I selected
two text files, AttachmentSample1 and AttachmentSample2, from the Documents folder. After
I click the Attach button, the attachments are shown added to my message at the bottom of
the window (see Figure 4-17).
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
91

Figure 4-17. Attachments are visible in your message.
INote To remove an attachment, simply click it and press the Delete key. To add more attachments, you
can use a shortcut; simply right-click any blank portion inside the attachment area and select the “Add
attachment” pop-up button.
Finally, you need to specify who will receive the e-mail and add a subject line. I’ll cover
the contact list later in the chapter, but for now type in your recipient’s e-mail address. Use
commas to separate multiple e-mail addresses. If you want to add Cc or Bcc lines, click the
View menu and select Cc Field and/or Bcc Field; then type in e-mail addresses for those fields.
Add some text in the subject line. Figure 4-18 shows the message ready to be sent. 
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
92

Figure 4-18. An e-mail with attachments is ready to send.
Click the Send button shown in Figure 4-18 and your e-mail is sent.
Replying to the Sender of an Existing Message
To reply to an e-mail, open the message by clicking it. The message will open, as shown 
in Figure 4-19.
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
93

Figure 4-19. An open e-mail message can be replied to with a click of a button.
Click the Reply button, and a new e-mail message appears with the text from the original
e-mail included at the bottom. Type in your message, as shown in Figure 4-20, and click the
Send button. You can change the subject line, add attachments, or delete the original message
text. You can also treat it just like a new message, including adding formatting (as described in
the previous section).
Replying to All Recipients of a Particular Message
Just like replying to a single recipient, clicking the Reply to All button shown in Figure 4-19 will
allow you to respond to an e-mail and send a response to all the addresses in the To and Cc
fields of the original message. Your response will not be sent to anyone included in the Bcc
field of the original message.
You can format text, add attachments, and even add new e-mail addresses to the Reply to
All message. (You can also delete e-mail addresses in a Reply to All message, but it’s often con-
sidered bad etiquette.)
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
94

Figure 4-20. A reply to this message includes the original message text.
Forwarding an Existing Message
You can also choose to forward an open e-mail message to a new recipient; maybe you
received an interesting web site link or an attachment that you want to share with someone
else. All that’s required is to click the Forward button (refer to Figure 4-19). You’ll need to pro-
vide at least one e-mail address; click the Send button when done, and the e-mail will be
forwarded to the new recipient(s).
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
95

ADDITIONAL E-MAIL OPTIONS
In addition to sending and receiving message, you can also perform the following tasks:
• Print a message: Select an e-mail in your Inbox (or double-click one to open it) and click the Print 
button.
• Identify spam: From the Inbox, click a spam message once and then click the Junk button. Your mes-
sage will be removed to the junk folder.
• Create new folders: Click the Folder menu and select the New option. Give your folder a name, specify
where to store it (possibly as a subfolder of the Inbox), and click Create.
• Search for messages: If you’re looking for a specific e-mail but have hundreds or thousands to sift
through, click the Search menu and select the Advanced Search option. Provide keywords that you
want to search for and click the OK button; any messages that contain one or more keywords will be
listed onscreen.
• Open attachments: If you receive an e-mail attachment, simply double-click the attachment, and that
file’s default application will open the file. For example, double-clicking an attachment labeled
recipes.odt will open the document using OpenOffice Writer (covered in Chapter 5). The .odt file
extension is the default OpenOffice Writer file type, but it can also be used to open .doc files as well.
Using Evolution Calendar and Tasks
Evolution provides an easy-to-use calendar and the ability to create a list of tasks (a to-do list).
To access the Calendar and Tasks features, click the Calendars button in the lower-left corner,
as shown in Figure 4-21.
Figure 4-21. Accessing the Evolution calendar is a button click away.
Figure 4-22 shows the default Calendar and Tasks window open. Tasks is located at the
right edge of the screen, and Calendar takes up the middle and left sections. (Note that you
can switch back to Evolution Mail by clicking the Mail button in the lower-left corner.)
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
96

Figure 4-22. Provide a username and password to log in to Ubuntu.
Let’s start by creating a task. In the upper-right corner of Figure 4-22 you’ll see a line of
text that says “Click to add a task.” Click that bit of text and type in something short and sweet
that you need to accomplish. Feel free to type in as many tasks as you want; as the list builds
up, you can scroll up and down the list. As your task list builds, you can place checks in boxes
to indicate that certain tasks are complete. The Tasks feature is simply a nice visual reminder
for you when you’re working in Evolution. Figure 4-23 shows that I’ve got some work ahead of
me. (To remove an item from the task list, right-click it and select Delete.)
Figure 4-23. Use the Tasks feature to give yourself friendly reminders.
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
97

In the lower-right corner of Figure 4-22 you’ll see another bit of text that says “Click to add
a memo.” Memos don’t come with check boxes and they give you a bit more space to type.
Memos are also specific to a certain day on your calendar; tasks are always visible, but memos
appear only on the day they are assigned (more on that later). Figure 4-24 shows a few memos
I’ve written; by right-clicking a memo, the text can be copied and pasted into an e-mail or
document of your choice.
Figure 4-24. Memos are useful for storing longer bits of text.
INote Memos and tasks are really useful when you assign a date to them by using the calendar (I’ll show
you how to do that shortly). Just remember that tasks are for short reminders, and memos are for adding
comments and notes and then applying them to specific days on your calendar. Memos are better than tasks
for typing longer bits of text for later use in other documents or tools.
Now let’s focus on using the Calendar feature. Figure 4-25 shows a minicalendar that 
displays a full month. You can use the small arrows to the left and right of the month and year
to move forward and backward to the month/year you want to view. The current date is indi-
cated by a small square surrounding the date (February 1, 2009 in Figure 4-25), and other days
you select are highlighted by a solid-colored square.
Figure 4-25. The minicalendar lets you select a specific day to add or view activities.
Clicking a particular day one time shows you a list of that day’s activities in one-hour
increments, as shown in Figure 4-26. In this example, I clicked February 14, 2009 and scrolled
down the activity list to view my evening schedule.
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
98

Figure 4-26. The calendar shows my dinner plans for the evening.
Although I check my calendar constantly, sometimes I want to set a reminder to alert me
in advance. To do this, I double-click the event. A screen like the one in Figure 4-27 appears.
Figure 4-27. Calendar lets you configure alerts to remind you of appointments.
To configure a reminder, click the Alarms button shown in Figure 4-27. Figure 4-28 shows
you the alarm configuration screen that appears.
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
99

Figure 4-28. The alarm configuration screen
Click the Alarm drop-down menu and select an appropriate reminder time. In this exam-
ple, I elected to be reminded one day prior to the appointment. Click the Close button when
done, and the appointment will now have a small icon indicating that an alarm has been set
(see Figure 4-29). 
Figure 4-29. An alarm icon indicates that an appointment reminder has been created.
On February 13, 2009, when I opened Evolution, I saw a small alert open in the lower-
right corner of the screen similar to the one in Figure 4-30.
Figure 4-30. Pop-up alerts keep you from forgetting important appointments.
You can also select different views of your calendar instead of a single day’s hourly 
breakdown. In the upper-right corner of the screen, click the button with the arrow pointing
downward (as shown in Figure 4-31), and you can choose three additional views for your cal-
endar: Week, Month, or List. In this example, I selected the Month view. (Click the Day button,
also shown in Figure 4-31, to return to the standard Day view seen in Figure 4-26.)
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
100

Figure 4-31. Change how your calendar appears (this is the Month view).
To create a new appointment (in any view: Day, Week, Month, List), double-click the view.
Depending on your view, you see a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 4-32. In Day
view, for example, double-clicking 6pm fills in the time of the new appointment; double-
clicking February 14 in Month view likewise fills in the day of the appointment, but not the
time. Click the Save button when done, and your appointment is added to your calendar.
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
101

Figure 4-32. Create a new calendar appointment.
Calendar has many more features, including printing out a day’s, week’s, or month’s worth
of activities. You can have your contact list (which is covered in the next section) automatically
add your friends’ and colleagues’ birthdays to your calendar. The View menu lets you toggle
between full-screen views of Tasks, Memos, and Calendar. And the Search menu lets you do a
keyword search of all your appointments and provides a list of all appointments that satisfy
the search requirements.
Using Evolution Contacts
The last feature of Evolution discussed here is Contacts. Because Contacts is built into Evolu-
tion, it can be used with both the Calendar and Email tools. For example, if you add your best
friend’s contact information to the list, including phone number, birthday, mailing address,
and e-mail address, you can click the To button (refer to Figure 4-15) and select his name
instead of typing his full e-mail address. Calendar can also be configured to display all your
contacts’ birthdays—if you launch Evolution every day to check your e-mail and calendar,
you’ll never have to worry about forgetting to call your buddy on his birthday!
To open up Contacts, click the Contacts button shown in Figure 4-21. The Contacts list
opens, as shown in Figure 4-33.

Figure 4-35. Click a contact to view information at the bottom of the screen.
If you want to e-mail a contact, simply click the e-mail address; a new e-mail message
window appears (similar to the one shown in Figure 4-14), and the contact’s e-mail address is
automatically added to the To field.
Selecting contacts enables you to print their information by clicking the Print button
along the top edge of the Evolution application (refer to Figure 4-35). Likewise, selecting a
contact and clicking the Delete button deletes that contact from your list (after selecting
Delete from a confirmation warning window that opens).
Summarizing Evolution
There is a lot more to learn about Evolution than I can teach you in this chapter. Evolution
comes with a nice Help Wizard that can be launched by clicking the Help menu and selecting
Contents and examining the instructions included there. You can also select the Get Help
Online option from the Help menu and post questions on the Internet site that opens, as well
as search existing questions.
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
105

Evolution is an application that resides on your hard drive. This means that your e-mail,
calendar, and contacts can be accessed only when you’re sitting at your computer. For most
people, this isn’t an issue, but if you want to be able to access your e-mail, calendar, and con-
tacts from any computer, take a look at Chapter 10, which covers Google’s e-mail and calendar
tools. After reading that chapter and possibly trying those tools, you’ll probably want to
choose to use either Evolution or the Google tools, not both (although that’s completely 
possible). 
Additional information on Evolution can be found on its official web site; point your 
web browser to http://projects.gnome.org/evolution/ for additional information and more
discussion about some of the features of Evolution not covered here.
What’s Next?
Next in Chapter 5, I’ll introduce you to one of the most powerful and popular Open Source
applications available: OpenOffice Writer. Writer is a word processor in the same family as big-
name applications such as Microsoft Word or Corel WordPerfect, but without a big name price.
It’s 100 percent free, and I think you’ll find that it’s a worthy application that can provide the
features you’ll need in a word processor. Did I mention that it’s free?
So, close down Evolution for now or just minimize it to the desktop, and get ready to see
what your U-PC can do when it comes to word processing.
CHAPTER 4 I E-MAIL REVOLUTION
106

Word Processing with Writer
One of the most surprising and welcome applications to see the light of day has to be
OpenOffice Writer, one of a handful of applications that comes with the free, open source
OpenOffice suite. This powerful word processor is providing some serious competition for the
best-selling Microsoft Word.
Microsoft Word is sold as a standalone application (for about $300.00) or bundled in the
Microsoft Office suite (starting at about $400.00). Considering that Microsoft Office applica-
tions update about every three to four years, the updates can become a large expenditure 
for a consumer who wants to keep up with the latest and greatest versions.
So, it’s a nice change of pace to find a suite of productivity applications (word processor,
spreadsheet, and slideshow/presentation software, among others) that is not only packed with
features but is also 100 percent free to download, install, and use—no strings attached. The
OpenOffice suite of applications is making waves in both the business world and in the home
PC market, providing users with a great-looking collection of tools that provide professional-
grade results.
In this chapter, I introduce you to OpenOffice Writer, one of three OpenOffice apps 
covered in the book. (Chapter 6 will cover OpenOffice Calc, a spreadsheet app; Chapter 7 will
cover OpenOffice Impress, a slideshow/presentation app.)
OpenOffice Versions for Ubuntu
When you install the Ubuntu operating system (version 8.10 for this book) on your computer,
a large collection of free applications is installed, including OpenOffice Writer, Calc, and
Impress. The applications are ready to use; no installation required. But the OpenOffice suite
has one drawback: the version of OpenOffice installed with the Ubuntu operating system is
version 2.4, and the most current version of OpenOffice is version 3.0 (as this chapter is being
written).
This chapter uses the version 3.0 user interface for all OpenOffice applications, but there
is nothing stopping you from following along with this chapter’s examples (as well as those in
Chapter 6 and Chapter 7) using version 2.4. There might be slight differences in naming con-
ventions for menus, tool buttons, and windows that open, but many of the actions required
while using Writer version 2.4 are similar if not identical to those in version 3.0. That said, I’ll
provide a web site that contains instructions for upgrading version 2.4 to version 3.0. The
upgrade is extremely simple to perform, and the instructions also provide screenshots of the
steps for you to follow.
107
C H A P T E R  5

Because OpenOffice version 2.4 already resides on your computer, all that’s really needed
to upgrade it to version 3.0 is to install a set of files that upgrade the older version, bypassing 
a full installation of OpenOffice. Here are the steps to do this.
Open your web browser to http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-To-Install-
OpenOffice-org-3-0-in-Ubuntu-8-10-96449.shtml, as shown in Figure 5-1.
Figure 5-1. Instructions for upgrading to OpenOffice version 3.0 are easy to follow.
Follow the steps provided on the web site, but be aware that after selecting Software
Sources (shown in Figure 5-1), you might see a window that asks for your administrator 
password (see Figure 5-2). If this window opens, enter your password and click OK.
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
108

Figure 5-2. Provide the administrator password if requested.
Perform the remaining steps described to complete the upgrade. When you finish, all
three OpenOffice applications—Writer, Calc, and Impress—will be version 3.0.
Welcome to Writer
Opening OpenOffice Writer couldn’t be easier: click the Applications menu, select the Office
group, and then click OpenOffice.org Word Processor, as shown in Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3. Selecting OpenOffice.org Word Processor opens Writer.
OpenOffice Writer 3.0 opens in a new window, as shown in Figure 5-4.
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
109

Figure 5-4. OpenOffice Writer’s user interface and a blank document.
Writer has the typical collection of drop-down menus along the top of the screen: File,
Edit, Insert, Format, Table, Tools, Window, and Help. And just below the menu bar is the first 
of two toolbars. Figure 5-5 shows the first toolbar with some descriptions of some of the but-
tons. As with many applications, hovering your mouse pointer over a button causes a small
tooltip window to appear that can often help you figure out a button’s function. You’ll also see
in Figure 5-5 that clicking the small downward-pointing triangle on the far-right edge of the
toolbar opens up additional buttons and tools (along with descriptions).
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
110

Figure 5-5. The first toolbar has many options, including print and spellcheck capabilities.
Figure 5-6 shows the second toolbar along with some descriptions. Notice that a second
menu of additional tools is available on this toolbar by clicking the downward-pointing arrow
indicated in the figure.
Figure 5-6. The second toolbar has options for modifying the text in a document.
Along the bottom edge of Writer is another toolbar, as shown in Figure 5-7. One of the
more useful features on this toolbar is the slider in the right corner that allows you to zoom in
and out of your document.
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
111

Figure 5-7. The bottom toolbar offers the ability to zoom in and out.
Finally, controls in the upper-right corner of the application allow you to minimize, 
maximize, and close the window, as indicated in Figure 5-8.
Figure 5-8. Minimize, maximize, or close the Writer window.
Throughout the remainder of this chapter, I’ll be using these menus, buttons, and tools 
to demonstrate some of the features and uses of Writer. I encourage you to open Writer and
follow along. And as with many applications, I highly encourage you to click the File menu
and select the Save option frequently to prevent any loss of work. Now, let’s see what you can
do with Writer.
Using Writer
In this section, I’m making some basic assumptions about your previous word processing
experience. I assume that you know how to enter text, how to select text for formatting, and
how to click menus and save files. If you’re completely new to word processing (and possibly
to using a computer), I recommend that you spend some time inside the OpenOffice Writer
Help Center. Click the OpenOffice.org Help option. 
When the OpenOffice.org Help window opens (see Figure 5-9), click Instructions for
Using OpenOffice.org Writer to learn about the basics of using this word processor. More than
100 basic skills are covered here, including using the mouse pointer to select and format text,
indenting paragraphs, setting tabs, adding graphics, and more. 
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
112

Figure 5-9. OpenOffice.org Writer Help is a perfect place to learn about basic word processing.
In the following sections, I’ll show you some basic and advanced tasks that you can perform
using Writer. For more details on these steps, consult the Help Wizard shown in Figure 5-9.
Fixing Misspelled Words
If you’re like me, you can’t type a paragraph without a misspelled word creeping into a sen-
tence or two. For me, it’s not a reflection of my spelling abilities; I type so fast that I tend to
make a lot of mistakes. So it’s nice to see that Writer alerts me to my misspelled words by 
placing a wavy line underneath the problem words, as shown in Figure 5-10.
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
113

Figure 5-10. Look at all those mispelled words . . . oops, I mean misspelled words.
Writer makes it so easy to fix misspelled words, too; simply right-click a misspelled word
and select the correctly spelled word, as shown in Figure 5-11. Only a single occurrence of that
word is fixed at a time in your document; in Figure 5-10, for example, the incorrectly spelled
word mispelled appears twice and fixing one of them does not correct the other occurrence.
INote Some might consider this to be a bug, but I need the word mispelled to be uncorrected in the previ-
ous paragraph and in this sentence. If I corrected the word anywhere else in this document, and the default
was to fix all errors of the same word, these two intentional errors would also be fixed—and I don’t want
that to happen.
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
114

Figure 5-11. Right-click a misspelled word; suggested fixes are at the top of the list.
Saving a Document in Different Formats
You can save a document by clicking File ® Save. The Save window appears; click the small
arrow to the left of “File type” and you’ll see a list of file extensions, as shown in Figure 5-12.
Figure 5-12. Writer can save documents in many different formats.
By default, Writer saves your documents using the .odt file type. Scrolling down that list,
you’ll also see that you can save in .doc format (for compatibility with Microsoft Word) as well
as many other formats, including .html (for use as web pages). But you won’t find another
popular file format, .pdf, in that list. Instead of saving a document as a .pdf file, you must
instead export the document as a separate file. To do this, click the PDF button indicated in 
Figure 5-13; provide a name and location to save the file and then click the Save button. The
current document is exported and saved with the .pdf extension.
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
115

Figure 5-13. Exporting your file to a .pdf file is as easy as clicking this button.
Inserting a Picture
Adding a picture to your document is fairly straightforward. Click the Insert menu, click the
Picture option, and then select From File on the flyout menu shown in Figure 5-14.
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
116

Figure 5-14. Insert a picture from a file stored on your computer.
Browse to the location of the desired image, select it, and click the Open button. Your 
picture is inserted into the document, as shown in Figure 5-15. You can use the small boxes 
at the corners of the figure to resize the image: click a box and, while holding down the mouse
button, drag the mouse in or out to shrink or enlarge the image; release the mouse button
when you’re done.
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
117

Figure 5-15. Pictures can be inserted into a document and resized.
Printing Envelopes
One nice feature that Writer supports is the ability to print envelopes if your printer supports
this function. To print an envelope, first load your printer with a blank envelope; consult your
printer’s documentation for proper orientation and insertion of an envelope.
Next, open a new Writer document, click the Insert menu, and choose the Envelope
option. A window opens, in which you can type your address in the Sender box and the recipi-
ent’s address in the Addressee box (see Figure 5-16).
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
118

Figure 5-16. Enter the addresses to be printed on the envelope.
Next, click the Printer tab, as shown in Figure 5-17, and select the orientation that
matches the envelope in the printer. Click the Insert button when you’re done.
Figure 5-17. Select the proper envelope orientation for your printer.
The address information is inserted into the document and can be printed using the Print
button, as shown in Figure 5-18.
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
119

INote The Format tab (refer to Figure 5-16) enables you to tweak the placement of the addresses, moving
them in or out as well as up and down. Use this option if you don’t like Writer’s default location for printing
the addresses.
Figure 5-18. The envelope preview shows you exactly how the envelope will be printed.
Verify the spelling and placement and then click the Print button; your envelope is
printed and ready for a stamp.
PERFORMING A MAIL MERGE
Imagine for a moment that you have a list of 30 people to whom you want to send an important letter. The
letter will contain some standard text, but you also want to include some customized content, including the
recipient’s address, the first name in the greeting, and some other details specific to that person. You could
type up the letter, enter the first person’s information, print the letter, and then edit the document by removing
the first person’s information and then adding in the next person, but that process could take a while. Fortu-
nately, OpenOffice Writer provides a better way: a mail merge.
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
120

A mail merge pulls custom information from a database or spreadsheet application and then inserts
that information into a word processing document. Where that information is placed is determined by you;
you create the basic format of the letter and then specify placeholders in which the custom information will
be inserted.
The instructions for using the mail merge feature aren’t difficult, but the number of steps is extensive,
and the process involves using two applications: both OpenOffice.org Writer and OpenOffice.org Calc.
OpenOffice.org has created an easy-to-follow .pdf file that you can download that walks you through 
the entire process for performing a mail merge. The document can be downloaded from http://
documentation.openoffice.org/manuals/userguide3/0211WG3-UsingMailMerge.pdf.
Printing Labels
You can purchase precut labels for your printer and use Writer to insert your text on the labels
before printing. Click the File menu, select New, and then choose Labels. The window shown
in Figure 5-19 appears.
Select the label brand from the Brand drop-down list shown in Figure 5-19. Avery is a pop-
ular label type, and I selected the 5260 Address labels from the Type drop-down list.
Figure 5-19. Select the label brand and type to create a custom label sheet.
Click the New Document button, and a preconfigured label template is created like the
one shown in Figure 5-20.
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
121

Figure 5-20. The preconfigured label sheet is ready for you to enter addresses.
INote If you can’t find your exact label type, click the Format tab (refer to Figure 5-19) to create a custom
label sheet; this requires you to provide some measurements of your label sheet.
Inserting Special Characters
Sometimes you need to add a unique character to your document; foreign currency symbols
are a good example. Place the cursor where you want to insert the special character, click the
Insert menu, and select the Special Character option. The Special Characters window opens,
as shown in Figure 5-21.
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
122

Figure 5-21. Use the Special Characters tool to find nonstandard text and symbols.
Select a font and scroll through the window to find the desired character. Click the OK
button, and the special character is inserted into the document (see Figure 5-22). 
Figure 5-22. Special characters can be inserted and formatted like standard text.
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
123

Preventing Changes to Text
If you create a document to share with other users but want to protect a small (or large) por-
tion of the text from being changed or deleted, Writer allows you to lock a portion of text with
a password; only someone with the password can then make changes.
Highlight the text you want to protect, as shown in Figure 5-23.
Figure 5-23. Highlighted text is protected with a password to prevent changes.
Click the Insert menu and select the Section option. The window shown in Figure 5-24
opens; place a check in the box labeled Protect and select the box labeled “With password.”
Provide a password in the window that appears; retype the password and click OK to return 
to the screen shown in Figure 5-23. Click the Insert button, and the text is locked.
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
124

Figure 5-24. Provide a password to protect and lock selected text.
Any attempted changes to the locked text result in a warning message similar to the one
shown in Figure 5-25.
Figure 5-25. Attempts to modify locked text result in a warning message.
Summarizing Writer
Writer is a full-featured word processing application with the ability to save documents in a
variety of standard and popular formats such as .odt, .doc, .html, and .pdf. Users of other
word processing applications can open, read, print, and edit documents created in Writer
without any concerns about compatibility.
Users can also count on reliable technical support from a community of OpenOffice
users, including many of the application developers as well as typical day-to-day users who
are willing to help others with questions. One of the best sources of help and information on
OpenOffice Writer (as well as Calc and Impress—covered in Chapters 6 and 7) is the official
OpenOffice web forum found at http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/. You can
search the extensive database of existing questions and answers, and post your own ques-
tions. Figure 5-26 shows that each OpenOffice application has its own category, with Writer
being at the top of the list—followed by Calc, Impress, and more.
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
125

Figure 5-26. The OpenOffice.org Community Forum
In addition to the forum, the OpenOffice Wiki at http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/
wiki/Main_Page is another great source of tutorials and information. Unlike the forum, ques-
tions aren’t posted here, but the OpenOffice community of users continually updates the Wiki
with frequently asked questions (FAQs) and how-to articles that you can print out or follow
along with as you use an application.
ITip If you’re really interested in learning OpenOffice.org 3.0, check out the new book, Beginning 
OpenOffice 3, by Andy Channelle (Apress); you’ll find every nook and cranny of OpenOffice.org covered in
this great resource.
What’s Next?
Chapter 6 will examine the OpenOffice spreadsheet application called Calc. You’ll see exam-
ples of many of the spreadsheet functions available via Calc as well as how to add spreadsheet
information to a document created with Writer. So let’s move ahead to the next OpenOffice
application and see how it works with the Ubuntu operating system.
CHAPTER 5 I WORD PROCESSING WITH WRITER
126

Spreadsheets with Calc
Spreadsheets aren’t just for accountants. I have a friend who uses spreadsheets to track his
fantasy football team’s statistics, and a chef I know stores all her recipes in a spreadsheet,
including extremely specific quantities for spices and cook times for individual herbs. Who
knew cooking could be so scientific? These days, spreadsheet applications are as common as
e-mail and word processing. The structure they provide for storing information and perform-
ing calculations goes hand in hand with the increased readability of a well-designed
spreadsheet. 
The big name in spreadsheets these days is Microsoft Excel. The Excel application can be
purchased individually for about $300, or you can get it as a bundle with the Microsoft Office
suite of applications, starting at about $400. But as I mentioned in Chapter 5, Microsoft likes
to update its Office products every three to four years; keeping up with the latest versions can
get expensive fast.
But just like the OpenOffice word processor called Writer that I covered in Chapter 5, an
OpenOffice equivalent to Microsoft Excel exists. It’s called Calc, and it’s 100 percent free with
features galore. 
This chapter is your introduction to this second of three OpenOffice applications (the
third is OpenOffice Impress, covered in Chapter 7). I’ll provide an overview of the application’s
interface and then show you some useful tasks you can perform.
Updating OpenOffice Calc
This chapter contains figures showing screen captures from OpenOffice Calc version 3.0. 
If you installed Ubuntu 8.10 (refer to Chapter 2), the OpenOffice applications are already
installed with the operating system, but they are version 2.4, not the most recent version of 
the OpenOffice apps.
You can use OpenOffice version 2.4 if you like, but if you prefer to have the most recent
version on your U-PC (and a much better and more stable version, in my opinion), please
refer to the Chapter 5 section titled “OpenOffice Versions for Ubuntu” for instructions on
updating your version of OpenOffice.
Welcome to Calc
To open OpenOffice Calc, click the Applications menu, select the Office group, and then click
OpenOffice.org Spreadsheet, as shown in Figure 6-1.
127
C H A P T E R  6

Figure 6-1. Selecting OpenOffice.org Spreadsheet opens Calc.
A new window opens (see Figure 6-2). This is the OpenOffice Calc 3.0 application.
Figure 6-2. OpenOffice Calc’s user interface and a blank spreadsheet.
CHAPTER 6 I SPREADSHEETS WITH CALC
128

Calc has a collection of drop-down menus that run along the top of the screen: File, Edit,
View, Insert, Format, Tools, Data, Window, and Help. Below the menu bar are three additional
toolbars. Figure 6-3 shows the first toolbar with descriptions of some of its buttons. Hover
your mouse pointer over any button and you’ll see a small tooltip window appear that
describes that button’s function. And on the extreme right edge of the first toolbar you’ll see a
small downward-pointing triangle that opens up additional features when clicked (also seen
in Figure 6-3).
Figure 6-3. The first toolbar includes buttons to print, save, sort, and more.
Figure 6-4 shows Calc’s second toolbar with some descriptions. Another menu of avail-
able tools can be accessed by clicking the downward-pointing arrow indicated in the figure.
CHAPTER 6 I SPREADSHEETS WITH CALC
129

Figure 6-4. Calc’s second toolbar options for modifying the cells in a spreadsheet.
Figure 6-5 shows Calc’s third toolbar. The Cell Locator box always lets you know which cell
or cells you have selected. Shortcuts to the Function Wizard as well as the Sum Function are
also available. (I’ll cover functions later in the chapter.) Finally, if you know how to use a cer-
tain function, you can type it directly into the Function Input Line without having to launch
the Function Wizard—a real time-saver.
Figure 6-5. The third toolbar is all about finding and using Calc’s built-in functions.
The bottom edge of Calc contains a fourth toolbar (see Figure 6-6). A nice feature on this
toolbar is the Quick Sum feature; selected cells (such as the three cells shown in Figure 6-6
that contain 23, 42, and 39) are summed and the result displayed.
CHAPTER 6 I SPREADSHEETS WITH CALC
130

Figure 6-6. Calc’s bottom toolbar has a useful Quick Sum feature.
You can also minimize, maximize, and close Calc by using the three buttons in the upper-
right corner of the screen, as shown in Figure 6-7.
Figure 6-7. Minimize, maximize, or close the Calc window.
I’ll be using these menus, buttons, and tools throughout the remainder of this chapter as 
I show you various tasks and features of Calc. 
Using Calc
If you’re new to spreadsheets, I recommend that you access the Help menu and select the
OpenOffice.org Help option. When the OpenOffice.org Help window opens (see Figure 6-8),
click Instructions for Using OpenOffice.org Writer and learn about the basics of using Calc. 
All the basic spreadsheet skills are covered here, including using the mouse pointer to select
and enter data in a cell, selecting multiple cells, applying formatting to cells, renaming sheets,
creating column headers, and more. The amount of help provided here is extensive, so be sure
to check here first if you need more information about performing a task in Calc.
CHAPTER 6 I SPREADSHEETS WITH CALC
131

Figure 6-8. OpenOffice.org Calc Help is the best source of information for using Calc.
The following sections contain step-by-step instructions for performing some of the basic
and advanced Calc tasks. Consult the Help Wizard shown in Figure 6-8 for additional details
on any of these tasks.
Inserting a New Column between Existing Columns
Figure 6-9 shows a small collection of information stored under four columns (A, B, C, and D)
with header names of First Name, City, Age, and High Score.
CHAPTER 6 I SPREADSHEETS WITH CALC
132

Figure 6-9. Four columns of information in a simple spreadsheet.
You could add a new header name (Last Name, for example) under the E column shown
in Figure 6-9, but it would be more useful to place it between the A and B columns. To do this,
click the letter B to select the B column. Next, click the Insert menu and choose the Columns
option. Columns B, C, and D will be shifted to the right and a new column will be inserted, as
shown in Figure 6-10. (Inserted columns always appear to the left of the selected column.)
ITip An easier way to add new columns is to simply right-click the top of a column (for example, column B
in Figure 6-9) and then choose Insert Columns. Column B shifts to the right and is renamed as column C 
(see Figure 6-10). The new column is empty of data, of course.
Figure 6-10. A new column is inserted and will be labeled Last Name.
CHAPTER 6 I SPREADSHEETS WITH CALC
133

Inserting a New Row Between Existing Rows
Figure 6-11 shows the updated collection of information stored under five columns—A, B, C,
D, and—with header names of First Name, Last Name, City, Age, and High Score.
Figure 6-11. A simple spreadsheet with five columns and four rows of data.
Suppose that you want to insert a new row of information for Frankie Agathon. Notice
that the current rows are listed alphabetically using the Last Name column (B). An inserted
row is always added above a selected row, so in this example, you would click row 3 (Buddy
Alcove) to select it. Next, click the Insert menu and choose the Rows option. The Buddy
Alcove, Elvis Angleton, and Jerry Lee Austin information will be shifted down one row, as
shown in Figure 6-12.
ITip As with the previous tip on adding a new column, simply right-click the number of a row (for exam-
ple, on row 2 in Figure 6-11) and choose Insert Rows. Row 2 shifts down and becomes row 3, as shown in
Figure 6-12. The new row is empty and waiting for new data.
CHAPTER 6 I SPREADSHEETS WITH CALC
134

Figure 6-12. A new row is inserted for Frankie Agathon’s data.
Sorting Information by Column
Figure 6-13 shows six rows of information for five individuals stored under five columns (the
first row is used for the header titles).
Figure 6-13. The user information is currently sorted alphabetically by last name.
Columns typically contain text, numbers, or some alphanumeric combination (such as a
street address that contains a number and text). Columns can be sorted depending on the
information stored in their cells; for example, columns of numbers can be sorted highest-to-
lowest or lowest-to-highest. Columns of text can be sorted alphabetically, A-to-Z or Z-to-A.
Figure 6-13 shows that the list is currently sorted alphabetically using the Last Name column.
To sort the data by a different column (High Score, in this example), select all the data that will
be sorted, as shown in Figure 6-14. (Note that I did not select row 1, which contains the header
names.)
CHAPTER 6 I SPREADSHEETS WITH CALC
135

Figure 6-14. Select all the data that will be sorted and omit header names.
Next, click the Data menu and select the Sort option. Figure 6-15 shows the Sort window
that opens.
Figure 6-15. The Sort window lets you select how your data will be sorted.
As shown in Figure 6-15, click the first drop-down box, choose Column E, and select the
Descending option. This process reorganizes the rows based on the High Score (column E),
highest-to-lowest. Figure 6-16 shows the data sorted by High Score.
Figure 6-16. All the rows are sorted based on column E.
CHAPTER 6 I SPREADSHEETS WITH CALC
136

Using the Formula Wizard
Figure 6-17 shows an updated spreadsheet with two new columns: Completion Time (seconds)
and Final Score. Although the High Score column is useful, the contest these five individuals
competed in actually judges them based on time as well; scoring high in less time is the goal.
To determine the winner, multiply the High Score value (in points) by the Completion Time
value (in seconds) for each competitor and then sort the spreadsheet using the Final Score
column to determine the final winner. The winner is the person with the highest Final Score.
Figure 6-17. The contest winner is the person with the highest Final Score.
The first task is to calculate the Final Score. This is done by taking a competitor’s High Score
value and multiplying it by his Completion Time value. First, let’s calculate the Final Score for
Frankie Agathon (row 2). First, click Frankie’s Final Score cell, G2, as shown in Figure 6-18.
INote All cells in a spreadsheet use the letter/number naming convention. The letter designates the 
column, and the number designates the row. The column after Z starts with AA, then AB, and so on.
Figure 6-18. Frankie Agathon’s Final Score is empty and needs to be calculated.
Next, click the Formula Wizard button (refer to Figure 6-5); a window appears, similar to
the one shown in Figure 6-19.

Figure 6-19. The Function Wizard performs calculations using spreadsheet data.
Scroll down the list of functions on the left side of the window and click PRODUCT, as
shown in Figure 6-19, and click the Next button. Note that when you select a function, you 
can view a description of what that function does on the right side of the screen.
The window shown in Figure 6-20 appears, which is where you select the cells that will be
used to calculate the Final Score. Notice the Number 1, Number 2, Number 3, etc. list. For
each number, you can type in a cell name (such as E2) or click the small button indicated in
the figure to hide this window until you click the desired cell. 
CHAPTER 6 I SPREADSHEETS WITH CALC

Figure 6-20. You must select the cells that will be used by the function to generate a new result.
I clicked that button for Number 1 and I selected cell E2 for Frankie’s High Score (indi-
cated by a blue box that surrounds the value). Press the Enter key to finalize the selection 
(see Figure 6-21).
Figure 6-21. Select the first cell to be used in the calculation.
After pressing Enter to accept the first value, Figure 6-22 shows that the cell E2 has been
entered into the Number 1 field. I also performed the same steps described previously and
selected cell F2 (Frankie’s Completion Time) for the Number 2 field.

To calculate Frankie’s Final Score, I click the OK button. Figure 6-23 shows the calculated
value.

Figure 6-25. Sorting the list shows that Elvis is the King!
Notice in Figure 6-26 that I selected a cell that contains a calculation performed using a
function. The actual formula used to generate the calculation will be visible in the function
toolbar; in this example, the formula is =PRODUCT(E2;F2); the two cells, E2 and F2, are the
cells that are multiplied together to get the Final Score for Elvis. Over time, you’ll probably
learn the format of various formulas and save time by typing them directly into the formula
bar instead of using the Function Wizard.

Summarizing Calc
Calc is my spreadsheet of choice. I used to be an Excel user, but the last time I purchased it
was back in 2003 (Excel 2003, to be exact), and I really haven’t found anything I needed 
Excel to do that I cannot do with Calc. Your mileage may vary, however. Calc is definitely full-
featured, but there are many Excel power users out there who might have job requirements
that Calc cannot fulfill. Your best bet is to open one of your existing spreadsheets in Calc and
try it out—see whether all the functions, formatting, and other spreadsheet tools you need are
supported in Calc. If you’re like me, you’ll find that your typical spreadsheet usage is limited to
multiplying, dividing, sorting, and formatting cells.
As with OpenOffice Writer (refer to Chapter 5), remember that the official OpenOffice web
forum found at http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum has a dedicated area just for
Calc questions and is a great place to visit if you need help with Calc or any of its features.
You’ll find a supportive community of OpenOffice users ready to help you make the jump to
Calc.
CHAPTER 6 I SPREADSHEETS WITH CALC
141

What’s Next?
With OpenOffice Writer as your word processor and OpenOffice Calc as your spreadsheet
application, let’s round out your U-PC office suite by learning how to use OpenOffice Impress,
a great slideshow application that works great by itself (or hand in hand with Calc and Writer)
and lets you design some eye-catching presentations.
CHAPTER 6 I SPREADSHEETS WITH CALC
142

Presentations with Impress
A few months back, I was asked to give a presentation in front of 200 people on the topic of
Open Source software. The coordinator for the event called me and asked that I submit my
PowerPoint presentation a few days early for review. I informed her that I could do that, but I
wouldn’t be using Microsoft PowerPoint. I could have heard a pin drop on the other end of the
phone. I told her that it wouldn’t make sense to create my slideshow on Open Source software
on a non–Open Source application. She was a bit uncertain, but I told her to trust me; the
presentation would be professional-looking and 100 percent compatible with her computer
and with PowerPoint.
It’s no surprise that when someone mentions the words slideshow presentation, Power-
Point comes to mind because it is generally considered to be the industry standard for
slideshow design. But it’s not the only game in town. Apple has its Keynote application for 
Mac users, for example. And when it comes to an open source software solution for creating
slideshows, you’ll be happy to hear that OpenOffice.org has its own player in the game. It’s
called Impress and (pardon the pun) it’s impressive. Impress is 100 percent free, fully compati-
ble with PowerPoint (it can save using the .ppt file extension), and it’s easy to use—as you’ll
soon see.
This chapter will provide an overview of Impress’s user interface and show you some fea-
tures that are available when you’re designing a slideshow. You’ll be convinced that Impress is
a viable solution to slideshow design and you’ll save $300 or more by not having to purchase
another product.
Updating OpenOffice Impress
This chapter contains figures showing screen captures from OpenOffice Impress version 3.0. 
If you installed Ubuntu 8.10, as described in Chapter 2, the OpenOffice applications are
already installed with the operating system, but they are version 2.4, not the most recent 
version of the OpenOffice apps.
You can use OpenOffice version 2.4 if you like, but if you prefer to have the most recent
version on your U-PC, please refer to the Chapter 5 section, “OpenOffice Versions for Ubuntu,”
for instructions on updating your version of OpenOffice.

C H A P T E R  7

Welcome to Impress
Open OpenOffice Impress by clicking the Applications menu and then selecting the Office
group. Click OpenOffice.org Presentation, as shown in Figure 7-1.
Figure 7-1. Selecting OpenOffice.org Presentation opens Impress.
The Impress 3.0 Presentation Wizard opens, as shown in Figure 7-2.
Figure 7-2. The Impress Presentation Wizard offers you three choices.
The Presentation Wizard allows you to choose from three options: opening an empty
(new) presentation, opening a presentation template, or opening an existing presentation. 
For this example, I’ll open an empty presentation; later in the chapter, I’ll open a template and
show you how that option works. Leave the “Empty presentation” default selection selected
and click the Create button. The Impress application opens, as shown in Figure 7-3.
CHAPTER 7 I PRESENTATIONS WITH IMPRESS
144

Figure 7-3. A new Impress presentation file opens and is ready for your design.
Figure 7-3 has a lot of options visible, but don’t let the screen overwhelm you; many of the
options can be hidden or will disappear after you begin designing your slideshow. You’ll find a
standard menu bar at the top that offers the following menus: File, Edit, View, Insert, Format,
Tools, Slide Show, Window, and Help. Below the menu bar are two toolbars. Below the toolbars
is the work area, and it’s currently divided into three sections: Slides, Slide Sorter, and the
Tasks window. At the very bottom of the screen are two more toolbars. Let me go over each of
these toolbars briefly.
Figure 7-4 shows Impress’s first toolbar with some descriptions. Two other drop-down
menus containing additional tools can be accessed by clicking the downward-pointing arrows
indicated in the figure.
CHAPTER 7 I PRESENTATIONS WITH IMPRESS
145

Figure 7-4. Impress’s first toolbar has many options, such as saving, printing, and zooming.
Figure 7-5 shows Impress’s second toolbar that offers formatting options for colors and
text. A drop-down menu containing additional tools can be accessed by clicking the down-
ward-pointing arrow indicated in the figure.
Figure 7-5. Impress’s second toolbar has formatting options that affect text, lines, and colors.
Figure 7-6 shows Impress’s three work area windows: Slides, Slide Sorter, and Tasks. As
you add more slides to your presentation, you can view a thumbnail (small) version of a slide
by clicking it in this list. The Slide Sorter window (in the middle) is where you actually modify
a slide: add pictures, text, video, formatting, and more. Finally, the Tasks window offers a large
collection of option screens; you can select a slideshow layout (shown in Figure 7-6) from the
Layouts screen or add animation by clicking the arrow next on the Custom Animation screen
(arrows for each screen are surrounded by squares in the figure). Additional screens include
Master Pages, Table Design, and Slide Transition. I’ll cover a few of these screens later in the
chapter, but I recommend that you experiment with all of them and use the built-in Help 
feature to discover how they can be used to improve your slideshows. 
CHAPTER 7 I PRESENTATIONS WITH IMPRESS
146

Figure 7-6. Three work area windows are available for designing each slide.
The Tasks window can be closed by clicking the x in the upper-right corner. You can close
it to free up work area space and display a larger Slide Sorter window, as shown in Figure 7-7.
To reopen the Tasks window, click the Format menu and choose Slide Layout. The Tasks win-
dow reappears in its original location.
Figure 7-7. Closing the Tasks window enlarges the Slide Sorter window.
Figure 7-8 shows the third toolbar. A drop-down menu containing additional tools can be
accessed by clicking the downward-pointing arrow indicated in the figure.
CHAPTER 7 I PRESENTATIONS WITH IMPRESS
147

Figure 7-8. Impress’s third toolbar lets you add shapes, symbols, and more.
The final bar at the very bottom (called the status bar) is shown in Figure 7-9. Among
other things, this status bar provides the total number of slides you have in your presentation
as well as the number for the slide you are currently viewing. In this example, I have a
slideshow that consists of 5 slides and I’m viewing slide number 4 (4/5, or 4 of 5).
Figure 7-9. Impress’s status bar helps you remember which slide you are working on.
As with the other OpenOffice applications, you can minimize, maximize, and close
Impress by using the three buttons in the upper-right corner of the screen.
I’ll be using all these menus, buttons, and windows throughout the remainder of this
chapter as I show you the various tasks and features of Impress. 
Using Impress
If you’ve never created a slideshow before, start by clicking the Help menu and then selecting 
the OpenOffice.org Help option. When the OpenOffice.org Help window opens (see Figure 7-10),
click Instructions for Using OpenOffice.org Impress. Standard slideshow design skills are cov-
ered here, including adding new slides, choosing a template, importing video, and more. This
should be your first stop when you have questions about performing tasks in Impress.
CHAPTER 7 I PRESENTATIONS WITH IMPRESS
148

Figure 7-10. OpenOffice.org Impress Help is the best source of information for using Impress.
The following sections contain step-by-step instructions for performing some of the basic
and advanced Impress tasks. Consult the Help Wizard shown in Figure 7-10 for additional
details on any of these tasks.
Creating a Slideshow with a Theme
Figure 7-2 showed that you can create a blank slideshow or one with a theme. A blank
slideshow is boring, quite frankly. So let’s start over and create a new slideshow from scratch;
click the File menu, select New, and then select Presentation. This time, select the “From tem-
plate” option shown in Figure 7-11 and notice that a list of presentation themes is displayed
near the bottom of the window. Scroll through that list until you find a color and style that you
like and then click the Next button.
CHAPTER 7 I PRESENTATIONS WITH IMPRESS
149

Figure 7-11. Choose a template to give your slideshow some color and style.
On the next screen (see Figure 7-12), you can choose to modify the background by 
selecting from the scrolling list that contains color changes, lines, and gradients. Feel free to
experiment, but for this example I’ll stay with my original theme and click the Next button. 
Figure 7-12. You can modify the design with additional lines and colors.
You can add transitions to your slideshows, such as making the current slide fade away 
or a new slide pushing on to the screen from the right or left. You can also control the speed 
of the transition. As seen in Figure 7-13, I selected to have my slides move from the right side
of the screen to the left (Wipe Left) at a Fast speed. Experiment with the various effects and
speeds to find something you like. Click the Next button when you finish.
CHAPTER 7 I PRESENTATIONS WITH IMPRESS

Figure 7-13. Eye-catching transitions can be added to your slides.
You can provide title information as well as a written summary about your slideshow on
the next screen, as shown in Figure 7-14. 
Figure 7-14. Provide slideshow information such as company name and presentation subject.
Click the Next button and you’ll see a final screen, as shown in Figure 7-15. This gives you 
a summary of what your slides will look like in the preview window on the right. Use the Back
button to make changes if you like or click the Create button to get started making your
slideshow.

changes.
Picking a Slide Layout
Figure 7-16 shows the screen after completing the Theme selection. On the right side of the
screen under the Layouts bar, the slide’s layout is indicated by the square border. Click any
other layout to change the slide’s design. Click the x in the upper-right corner of the Tasks 
window to close it and expand the Slide Sorter window.

Figure 7-16. Select from a variety of slide layouts using the Layouts bar.
Figure 7-17 shows my first slide with a new layout. I can double-click the left side of the
slide to add a photo or graphic stored on my hard drive as well as modify the text on the right
side of the slide. I also closed down the Tasks window to give myself more room to work on 
the slide in the Slide Sorter window.
CHAPTER 7 I PRESENTATIONS WITH IMPRESS
153

Figure 7-17. Modify text and add pictures by editing the slide shown in the Slide Sorter window.
Adding a New Slide
A slideshow with just one slide isn’t a presentation. To add a new slide, click the Insert menu
and click Slide. A new slide is always added after the slide that is currently selected; click a
slide to select it, and an orange box surrounds it. Figure 7-18 shows a new slide added after the
first one. Notice that the theme you selected is automatically applied to the new slide, and the
Layouts pane reopens (if you closed it) so you can choose a layout.
ITip An easier way to add a new slide is to simply right-click any empty space under the Slides column on
the left side of the screen. Click the New Slide option that appears.
CHAPTER 7 I PRESENTATIONS WITH IMPRESS
154

Figure 7-18. A new slide retains the presentation theme you selected.
Inserting a Video
Adding a video to be played inside a slide isn’t difficult. Click the Insert menu and select the
Movie and Sound option. Browse and locate the movie file on your hard drive and click the
Open button. Your video is inserted into the slide, as shown in Figure 7-19. You can click and
drag the movie and then place it by releasing the mouse button; resize the movie by clicking
the video and using the small green squares surrounding the video.
CHAPTER 7 I PRESENTATIONS WITH IMPRESS
155

Figure 7-19. Insert a video and resize it as desired.
Creating Handouts
When giving a presentation, a speaker is often asked to provide handouts to the audience for
note-taking or for easier viewing when the room is large. Click the File menu and select the
Print option. The window shown in Figure 7-20 opens.
Figure 7-20. There are numerous options for printing a slideshow.
CHAPTER 7 I PRESENTATIONS WITH IMPRESS

Click the drop-down menu labeled Content and choose Handouts, as shown in Figure 7-21.
You can choose to display up to nine slides per page, horizontally or vertically.
Figure 7-21. Choose how many slides to print per page for the Handouts option.
Rehearsing and Timing a Presentation
After completing a slideshow, many presenters often practice their presentation. Impress 
provides a built-in timer that can be used to help you determine whether you’re spending too
much time on a slide. Select the first slide in your presentation, click the Slide Show menu,
and then select the Rehearse Timings option. Figure 7-22 shows a small timer in the lower-left
corner of the screen. Practice your presentation and make note of the time it takes to com-
plete the slide. When you click the Enter key or press the left mouse button, the next slide is
loaded, and the timer resets. 
CHAPTER 7 I PRESENTATIONS WITH IMPRESS
157

Figure 7-22. The timer allows you to time and refine your speaking skills.
Summarizing Impress
Back in Chapter 6, I told you that OpenOffice Calc was my spreadsheet of choice. For presen-
tations, I switch back and forth between Impress and another slideshow app called Google
Docs Presentation (which will be covered in Chapter 11). Impress definitely has a wealth of
features and functions similar to Microsoft PowerPoint. I enjoy using it when I need to put
together a quick presentation and I don’t want to spend hours and hours tweaking every little
setting. (I used to spend hours on a single slide in PowerPoint—not because I needed to, but
because I could; sometimes having more features isn’t the best solution.)
If you elect to use Impress as your slideshow application, I highly encourage you to visit
http://www.openoffice.org and click the “I want to do more with my OpenOffice.org” link, 
as shown in Figure 7-23. The number of themes that comes preinstalled with Impress is small,
but here you’ll find a large collection of themes and clip art that can be downloaded for free
and added to Impress (and other OpenOffice.org apps). Be sure to check out the SimpleTemplate
One add-on for an interesting and eye-catching new theme. (You can also get it directly by vis-
iting http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/simpletemplateone.)
CHAPTER 7 I PRESENTATIONS WITH IMPRESS

Figure 7-23. OpenOffice.org provides additional themes and content for all OpenOffice apps.
What’s Next?
Impress rounds out the three OpenOffice applications covered in this book (refer to Chapter 5
and Chapter 6 for Writer and Calc, respectively). But you’ll want (and need) more than just a
word processor, spreadsheet, and slideshow application for your U-PC.
In Chapter 8, I'll show you one of the most powerful and popular photo editing applications
available: Picasa. This application is not only 100 percent free but it's also already installed
thanks to the Ubuntu operating system you installed on your PC. Get ready to learn some fun
(and powerful) photo editing skills.

Photo Management with Picasa
The holiday season ended about a month ago as I write this, and I brought home hundreds of
digital photos of family and friends. Most of these photos were taken indoors, so some of them
have all kinds of lighting problems (I refuse to acknowledge that for many of them I forgot to
turn on the flash). I also have a really cute photo of my nieces and nephews playing together,
but unfortunately all of them have glowing red eyes, seriously reducing the cuteness factor.
My camera has a red-eye reduction setting, but it’s a pain to turn on and off, and it really
drains the battery. 
Fortunately for me, I have a secret weapon on my U-PC that lets me fix all these problems,
and it’s from a company you might have heard of in the news: Google. Yes, Google has a free
application called Picasa that works great with the Ubuntu operating system. Picasa can fix
red-eye, crop photos, solve lighting issues, and much more. Once you start using it, you’ll stop
fretting over red-eye and other problems with your digital pictures. 
Picasa is so simple to use that I worry this chapter might actually slow you down; it’s
entirely possible for you to begin using Picasa and learn as you go—it’s that easy to figure out.
But I still want to provide an overview of Picasa as well as some examples of tasks you’ll likely
perform often on your photos. So let me show you why you don’t need to spend $100 or even
$25 on any photo-editing software; Picasa is here to rescue your digital pictures. 
Getting Picasa
Picasa does not come preinstalled with the Ubuntu operating system. You’ll need to go and
download the installation file. Trust me; this is one of the easiest applications to download and
install. How easy? Three steps:
1. Open the Firefox web browser and visit http://www.picasa.com. Click the Download
Picasa 3 for Linux (beta) button, as shown in Figure 8-1.
161
C H A P T E R  8

CHAPTER 8 I PHOTO MANAGEMENT WITH PICASA
162
Figure 8-1. Picasa can be downloaded from Google for free.
2. Click the “deb, for Debian/Ubuntu i386” link and download the installation file, 
as indicated in Figure 8-2. If you have a 64-bit processor, click the (64-bit) option 
below it. (By default, the file will download to your Ubuntu desktop.)
INote As I write this chapter, Picasa version 3 is still in beta; this might have changed by the time you
read this. Version 2.7 does not run well on Ubuntu 8.10, the version of Ubuntu used in this book.

Figure 8-2. Download the .deb file that will let you install Picasa on Ubuntu.
3. Locate the Picasa installation file that was downloaded and double-click it. A Package
Installer window will open; click the Install Package button in the upper-right corner,
and the application installation will begin. You might be asked to provide an adminis-
trative password. If so, provide the password and click OK. When the installation is
done, you can delete the installation file.
Welcome to Picasa
Open Picasa by clicking the Applications menu, selecting the Graphics group and then the
Picasa listing. Click Picasa in the fly-out menu, as shown in Figure 8-3.
CHAPTER 8 I PHOTO MANAGEMENT WITH PICASA
163

CHAPTER 8 I PHOTO MANAGEMENT WITH PICASA
164
Figure 8-3. The Picasa application can be found in the Graphics application category.
WHAT ABOUT GIMP?
You might have noticed that installing Ubuntu also installs an application called GIMP Image Editor in the
Graphics group (refer to Figure 8-3). Why would you want to download, install, and use Picasa instead of the
built-in GIMP? Well, one of the main reasons why I recommend Picasa is its simplicity (and the fact that it’s
free). GIMP is an amazing application, and all the things you can do with Picasa (cropping, removing red-eye,
and more) can be done with GIMP, but not as easily (in my opinion).
Entire books have been written on using GIMP. (For me, Apress publishes the best book on the subject:
Beginning GIMP, 2nd Edition, by Akkana Peck.) It’s one of the most powerful image editing applications avail-
able and it’s 100 percent free. Feel free to open it up and play around. But I feel a quick warning is required
here: GIMP can be a little overwhelming at first glance, but it’s not a difficult application to learn, so I highly
recommend that you purchase a book or consult some of the online resources such as the GIMP Online 
Manual (http://docs.gimp.org/en/) or some of the online tutorials (http://www.gimp.org/ 
tutorials/) to get the most out of the application.
The first time you open Picasa, you need to read through the license agreement and click
the Next button (see Figure 8-4) to see another page of the agreement. Click the I Agree button
to continue.

Figure 8-4. As with most software, Picasa has a license agreement for you to read.
The first time you install Picasa, it scans the entire hard drive for images, which can take
some time, especially if you have thousands of digital photos stored on your computer. When
the scan is done, you’ll see a screen like the one shown in Figure 8-5.
Figure 8-5. The Picasa application opens with folders on the left and photos on the right.
CHAPTER 8 I PHOTO MANAGEMENT WITH PICASA
165

ITip I highly encourage you to begin a habit of storing your photos in the Photos folder on Ubuntu because
you’ll likely always find what you’re looking for in there (it’s so easy to remember). To access this folder, click
the Places menu and select Photos. You can create as many subfolders in the Photos folder as you like. I’ll
show you later in the chapter how to configure Picasa to scan only the Photos folder and prevent Picasa
from scanning the entire hard drive.
In Figure 8-5, you can see a folder structure running down the left side of the application.
These are folders that Picasa has found on your computer that contain one or more images. 
If you click a photo, the images in that folder are displayed on the right under the Photo sec-
tion. Folders are organized by year, newest to oldest. (If you look closely at the figure, you can
see I have a photo from 2005.) Some cameras mark the digital files with dates, and Picasa can
read this information to further help you organize your photos.
To see a larger view of a photo and to access tools to edit that photo, double-click the
photo; it opens as shown in Figure 8-6. (Later in the chapter, I’ll be showing you how to use
some of the editing tools available.) 
Figure 8-6. Opening a photo provides access to editing tools on the left side of the screen.
As you edit photos (for example, remove red-eye or crop a picture to remove unwanted
parts of a photo), the changes are shown onscreen. You can always undo a change by clicking
the Undo button; Figure 8-6 shows that I can undo an Auto-Contrast modification I made to
this photo. (If you click Undo and change your mind again, click the Redo button; whatever
modification you made will be added back to the photo.)
The final area of Picasa runs along the bottom of the application (see Figure 8-7). This
toolbar allows you to do many things with your photos, including printing, sending photos via
e-mail, uploading photos to the Internet, and even purchasing prints online. I’ll go over a few
CHAPTER 8 I PHOTO MANAGEMENT WITH PICASA
166

of these features later in the chapter, but feel free to click and experiment—you really can’t do
anything to your pictures that can’t be undone.
Figure 8-7. Picasa’s toolbar has numerous options, including printing and e-mailing photos.
Before you move on to some sample Picasa tasks, I suggest that you make one change to
the way Picasa scans your hard drive for images. Click the Tools menu and select the Folder
Manager option. The Folder Manager window opens (see Figure 8-8).
Figure 8-8. The Folder Manager lets you decide what folders get scanned by Picasa.
As shown in Figure 8-8, I expanded the My Pictures folder and the My Documents folder
by clicking the + symbols next to them. I can now view all the subfolders. The little eye symbol
shows that this folder is scanned by Picasa every time I run the application. There’s really no
need for Picasa to look under some of these folders—the Music, Videos, and Templates folders
are not likely to hold my digital photos. 
Click a folder that you want to remove from Picasa’s scan and click the Remove from
Picasa radio button, as indicated in Figure 8-9. Do this for each folder you want to have Picasa
ignore on later startups. In this example, I selected the Music folder (among others) and
clicked the Remove from Picasa option (notice that the eye symbol has changed to a red x).
This indicates that the Music folder will not be searched in the future.

Figure 8-9. Picasa no longer searches for images in folders shown with an x.
When you finish, click the OK button. The next time you open Picasa, those folders you
deselected will no longer be searched. 
And now let’s take a look at some useful Picasa features that you’re sure to find useful
when managing your digital photo collection. 
Using Picasa
As you begin using Picasa, be aware that the application has a great built-in Help feature that
can be accessed by clicking the Help menu and choosing the Help Contents and Index option.
The Help web site shown in Figure 8-10 opens. Enter your question in the Search bar at the
top and click the Search Picasa Help button to find articles and tutorials that might assist you.

Figure 8-10. The Picasa Help web site is a great place to look for answers and how-tos.
Additional help with Picasa can be found by clicking the Help menu and choosing 
the Picasa Forums option. You can also visit http://groups.google.com/groups/
Google-Labs-Picasa-for-Linux and either post your question there or search for existing
answers from previous posts.
Removing Red-eye
Nothing ruins a picture faster than a pair of glowing red eyes staring back at you. Many digital
cameras can automatically remove red-eye, but it typically requires turning on a feature that
gives a preflash followed by the actual flash of the camera. This can drain batteries, and the
feature is typically not needed for outdoor photographs. But don’t worry about red-eye any-
more! Picasa has made removing red-eye extremely simple. Here’s how it’s done.
First, locate the photo with red-eye in the folder listing along the left side of Picasa. 
Double-click the photo to open it. As shown in Figure 8-11, click the Redeye button on the
Basic Fixes tab (take note of the other two tabs—Tuning and Effects—that I’ll cover shortly).

Figure 8-11. Select the Redeye button to remove red-eye from a photo.
Hold down the mouse button and drag a small box around one of the subject’s eyes, as
shown in Figure 8-12. Try to make the box as small as possible so it surrounds only the red
portion of the eye. Release the mouse button, and the red-eye is removed. Perform the same
action on the other eye. If you find that you need to zoom in on the photo for accuracy, drag
the Zoom toolbar (indicated in Figure 8-12) to the right to zoom in and to the left to zoom
back out. When you zoom in on a photo, a small version of the complete photo appears in 
the lower-right corner of the enlarged image. Drag the small white box with the mouse until 
it contains the area you want to work on; this works for red-eye as well as other editing tools
such as cropping.

Cropping a Photo
I took the photo of my son quickly and couldn’t center the subject perfectly and keep his
cousin’s legs (just above his head) out of the picture (see Figure 8-13). But Picasa lets me 
easily edit this photo and crop the legs out of the photo using the Crop button indicated in 
the figure. 
CHAPTER 8 I PHOTO MANAGEMENT WITH PICASA

Figure 8-13. Use the crop button to remove unwanted legs from an otherwise nice photo.
The Crop Photo window shown in Figure 8-14 offers you three preconfigured crops to
choose from. You can also click the drop-down list and select to either manually select the
area of a photo to keep or select a preset size (such as 4×6 inches or 5×7).
Figure 8-14. Select a precropped image or make your own area selection.
I select the 4×6 option; a box appears on the screen, and I can drag that area around as
needed—up, down, left, and right—until I’m happy with the selection. I click the Apply but-
ton, and the photo is cropped as shown in Figure 8-15.

Adding Tags for Faster Searching
If you have hundreds or even thousands of digital photos stored on your hard drive, it can 
take quite some time to locate a specific photo. Even if you’ve titled your photos (such as
birthday154.jpg), you still have to open them to see exactly who or what they display, or scan
through thumbnails of all your photos looking (squinting, actually) for that one specific photo.
It’s a hassle, but Picasa offers a much better method.
Look back at Figure 8-15 and look under the photo for the text “Make a caption!” Click
that line once and enter a description or keywords that reflect who or what is in the photo;
press the Enter key when you finish. Figure 8-16 shows that I provided numerous keywords 
(or tags) for this photo.
Figure 8-16. Add a caption to a photo using as many descriptives as possible.
CHAPTER 8 I PHOTO MANAGEMENT WITH PICASA
173

Notice that I included the month and year, the location (Florida), and, in this case, an age
(21 months). Let’s say I have a few thousand photos on my hard drive and I’m looking for all
the photos that were taken in Florida. With Picasa, all I need to do is type the word florida on
the search bar, as shown in Figure 8-17, and any photos that contain that tag (keyword) show
up. You can enter multiple tags separated by a space or comma, and Picasa shows all photos
with tags that match one or more of the tags.
Figure 8-17. Search using keywords, and matching photos will appear.
Fixing Lighting Problems
Take a look at Figure 8-18; it might be difficult for you to see it, but the photo is just a little too
dark. You have quite a few options on the left side of the screen; the Auto Contrast, Auto Color,
and even I’m Feeling Lucky buttons all can work miracles. These buttons are found on the
Basic Fixes tab. 
CHAPTER 8 I PHOTO MANAGEMENT WITH PICASA
174

Figure 8-18. The Basic Fixes tab offers you options for editing a photo.
For this photo, however, I want to work from the Tuning tab to manually control some of the
settings such as color, shadow, and temperature using the drag bars indicated in Figure 8-19. 
Figure 8-19. The Tuning tab gives you more control over lighting settings.
The final results are shown in Figure 8-20. Not too bad! Notice that I didn’t need to use the
Highlights or Shadows sliders. The water looks just like it did the day of the rafting trip, and 
the colors are much more vivid.

Purchasing Photos Online
One of the nicest features of Picasa is how easily the application makes purchasing prints of
your photos. You first create a virtual album by selecting a photo that you want to purchase
and then click the green pin button, as indicated in Figure 8-21. The pin keeps the selected
photos in the Album section until you’re done picking all the photos you want to order. 
(Click the red circle below the green pin to deselect all photos.)

After you select all the photos you want to purchase, click the Shop button on the Picasa
toolbar. A window opens (see Figure 8-22). You’ll see a listing of companies that offer to print
your photos for you at a price much lower than you’ll find at a local photo kiosk or developer.
Click the Choose button for a few (or all) of the companies and compare their prices; pick the
one that works best for you and follow the onscreen instructions for submitting your photos
via Picasa. The photos will be printed, boxed, and shipped to you. How easy is that?
Figure 8-22. Picasa offers links to a variety of photo printing services; shop for the best price.
Summarizing Picasa
I’ve been able to show you only a handful of Picasa’s features, but I hope you got a glimpse of
how easy Picasa is to use. You really can’t make a mistake with this application; all the editing
features can be reversed by clicking the Undo button, and the Picasa toolbar offers additional
services such as the ability to upload your photos to a blog, e-mail them to friends and family,
and even upload them to the Picasa Web Albums service that stores photos online.
Remember that Picasa has both an online forum and online Help documentation that
you can access to learn about every little feature this application has to offer. Get familiar 
with all its features, and you’ll find that managing and editing your digital photos is no longer
a chore. 

What’s Next?
Chapter 9 is all about web browsing, but not with just any web browser. When it comes to
accessing web pages, there are dozens of different web browsers out there that can do the job.
But would you be interested in using a web browser that can be modified with add-ons that
provide extra functions and powers, far beyond the abilities of the common web browser?
Then keep reading, because up next you’ll learn how to super-charge your web browsing.
CHAPTER 8 I PHOTO MANAGEMENT WITH PICASA

Web Browsing with Firefox
The Internet has changed the world. Going online, you can buy books, research a potential
vehicle purchase, check for movie times (and even buy and print tickets), download software,
view videos, and find 1,001 ways to distract yourself. And all these activities have two things in
common: they require a web browser and a connection to the Internet.
Most operating systems these days come prepackaged with a web browser. Microsoft, for
example, provides Internet Explorer (IE) with all its Windows operating system installations,
and Apple provides Safari with the Mac OS. 
For your U-PC running the Ubuntu operating system, you’ll find a prepackaged web
browser called Firefox; some of you might already be familiar with it because it runs on 
Windows and Macs, too. Firefox by itself is fairly easy to use: open the browser, type in a web
address, and you’re surfing the Web. But Firefox is more than just a web browser as you’ll soon
learn. In this chapter, I’ll cover the basics of using Firefox as well as show you how to personal-
ize the browser and make it more useful to you.
Welcome to Firefox
Firefox is preinstalled with the Ubuntu operating system. There’s nothing to download to get
the basic browser, and Ubuntu doesn’t even make you click any menus to launch it. To open
Firefox, simply click the icon indicated in Figure 9-1.
Figure 9-1. Firefox comes preinstalled and can be launched using this little icon.
179
C H A P T E R  9

The Firefox application opens, as shown in Figure 9-2. 
Figure 9-2. Firefox opens to the Ubuntu start page with a Google search box.
INote The version of Firefox installed during my Ubuntu installation is 3.0.5. Your version might differ, but
the functionality should be similar to the steps described in this chapter.
The Firefox window has a few different areas that I want to cover before you move into
some more advanced uses of the browser. You’ll notice a familiar strip of menus running along
the very top of the Firefox browser (refer to Figure 9-2). The list of menus includes File, Edit,
View, History, Bookmarks, Tools, and Help. You’ll visit some of these menus later in the 
chapter, but feel free to click and experiment to see what’s available.

CHAPTER 9 I WEB BROWSING WITH FIREFOX

CHAPTER 9 I WEB BROWSING WITH FIREFOX
Just below the menus is the toolbar shown in Figure 9-3. You’ll be using this toolbar 
frequently, so let me explain each button quickly.
Figure 9-3. The Firefox toolbar holds only the most necessary buttons and fields for browsing.
As you visit more and more web sites and pages, you can use the Back button to return to
previous pages; one click reloads the previous web page you viewed, two clicks reload the
page before that one, and so on. The Forward button does the reverse; click it to jump ahead
after you use the Back button a few times. 
The Reload button is useful for refreshing the current screen without changing the page.
For pages that provide information that changes frequently (such as financial web sites that
display a constant stock price or a weather web site that updates the temperature every few
minutes), clicking the Reload page forces the web browser to refresh whatever data is available
for that page. The Stop button, likewise, can stop a Reload or stop a new web page from load-
ing if you click it fast enough. (Most web pages load so quickly that you won’t have time to
click the Stop button if you change your mind.)
Every time you open your web browser, it displays your homepage. Figure 9-2 shows that
the Ubuntu start page is the default homepage when you first open Firefox, but you can
change your homepage to any web site you like; I’ll show you how to do this shortly. Whenever
you’re browsing the Internet, a click of the Homepage button takes you immediately to your
preset homepage.
Enter web addresses in the web address field indicated in Figure 9-3. Enter addresses in
the form of http://www.website.com or simply website.com (Firefox is smart enough to add the
http://www part). You can click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the address field
to see a list of recently viewed web addresses you’ve visited.
Finally, Firefox offers a Search box at the far right of the toolbar; type in your text to search
and click the small magnifying glass button, and your search results will be displayed in the
browser window below the toolbar.
Below the Firefox toolbar is the Bookmarks toolbar shown in Figure 9-4.
Figure 9-4. Additional information can be found on the Bookmarks toolbar.

If you’re new to Firefox or to web browsing in general, clicking the Getting Started button
takes you to an online tutorial with more help than you can imagine. Feel free to take a few
tours—the button remains there in case you ever have a question. When you feel you’ve gotten
all you can get from the button, simply right-click it and choose Delete. The Getting Started
button will be removed.
The Most Visited drop-down list is helpful; click this button and you can see a list of the
ten web sites you visit most often. Below the list is the option to Open All in Tabs, which does
exactly that: all ten web sites open in their own tabs, displayed below the secondary toolbar.
Click the Latest Headlines button, and a list of all the latest news stories appear. Select a
news item and it opens in the browser window.
This Bookmarks toolbar can hold many different buttons, and I’ll show you how to 
customize it a bit later in the chapter.
Using Firefox
Firefox functions like every other web browser when it comes to giving you access to a web
address. You simply type in the web address, press Enter, and the destination web site appears
on your screen. Web browsers are definitely useful and reliable, but they’re also fairly boring.
The basic features I described previously (such as the Back button, the Search field, and the
Homepage button) are fairly typical of all web browsers. 
Given these basic features, there’s not much difference in your choice of browser. Fortu-
nately for you, however, not all web browsers are created equal, and Firefox is one browser that
rises above the rest because it offers something called the add-on. And add-ons (100 percent
free) are where Firefox truly shines. There is simply no way to accurately describe an add-on
because there are so many variations. Think of an add-on as an upgrade to the Firefox
browser, with add-ons functioning as miniapplications embedded within Firefox. What add-
ons are available—I’m glad you asked. 
Finding Add-ons
To get a better idea of what an add-on is and what it does, let’s take a look at what’s currently
available. Click the Tools menu and select the Add-ons option, as shown in Figure 9-5.
CHAPTER 9 I WEB BROWSING WITH FIREFOX
182

Figure 9-5. Finding add-ons starts under the Tools menu.
The Add-ons window appears (see Figure 9-6).
Figure 9-6. The Add-ons window helps you narrow your search for add-ons.
CHAPTER 9 I WEB BROWSING WITH FIREFOX
183

The Add-ons window gives you a listing of recommended add-ons along with a brief
description of what each add-on does. Each add-on is rated with between one and five stars
by users, so you can use this as a possible gauge of what is useful and what isn’t. Feel free to
scroll down the list and see what’s recommended; when done, click the Browse All Add-ons
link in the upper-right corner of the window. Figure 9-7 shows the Firefox Add-ons tab that
appears.
Figure 9-7. Search for Firefox Add-ons that can make your browser even more useful.
Right now, you probably aren’t aware of which add-ons are available, so the search text
box in the middle of the screen isn’t that useful. As you become more familiar with add-ons,
you can start searching for them by typing in the name or a brief description of what you want
CHAPTER 9 I WEB BROWSING WITH FIREFOX
184

Firefox to be able to do. But for now, let’s go hunting for a specific add-on using the categories
listed down the left side of the screen. Click the Bookmarks category; the window shown in
Figure 9-8 appears. Click the Most Popular First link on the right side of the page.
Figure 9-8. Locate the add-on you want to learn about and click its download link.
I scrolled down the list of various bookmark add-ons that appears and located Delicious
Bookmarks (one of my favorite add-ons), as shown in Figure 9-9. 
CHAPTER 9 I WEB BROWSING WITH FIREFOX
185

Figure 9-9. An information screen provides reviews, details, and a button to add to Firefox.
You can click the add-on name to read a more detailed description of what service the
add-on provides; if you want to add it to Firefox, click the Add to Firefox button.
With many add-ons that you choose to install, you might see a warning window about 
the dangers of malicious software or you might have to agree to a license agreement similar 
to the one shown in Figure 9-10. Read through it and then accept or decline. 
CHAPTER 9 I WEB BROWSING WITH FIREFOX
186

Figure 9-10. Some add-ons have license agreements for you to accept before installation begins.
So, what does Delicious do after it’s installed? Take a look at Figure 9-11; notice that three
new buttons have been added to the toolbar as well as a menu labeled Delicious. The menu is
useful, but the Bookmarks button and Add Tag button are what you’ll focus on.
CHAPTER 9 I WEB BROWSING WITH FIREFOX
187

Figure 9-11. Use the Add Tag button to attach keywords to web sites you bookmark.
Visit any web site that you visit frequently or want to add to your list of bookmarked web
sites. Next, click the Add Tag button; a window appears, similar to the one shown in Figure 9-12.
Figure 9-12. Add tags that can help you later narrow down a search of your bookmarked sites.
In the Tags text box, enter as many keywords (tags) as you can that describe the web site.
In this example, I enjoy visiting http://www.lifehacker.com and tagged it with the following
tags: lifehacker, efficiency, work, and software. Click the Save button when you’re finished.
How do tags work? Let’s say I visit the Lifehacker blog every day for a year and find various
articles that I want to bookmark. By tagging them with lifehacker I can now use Delicious to
search all my bookmarks for only those web sites that are tagged with lifehacker and nothing
else. I do this by clicking the new Delicious Bookmarks button (refer to Figure 9-11) and typing
lifehacker as my tag in the Bookmarks window to search on, as shown in Figure 9-13.
CHAPTER 9 I WEB BROWSING WITH FIREFOX
188

Figure 9-13. Searching on keywords filters bookmarked web sites.
The filtered sites appear at the bottom of the Delicious Bookmarks window; click any web
site located in that list, and the page will load in the browser. (You can enter multiple tags to
further filter the list.) Click the Delicious Bookmarks button to toggle on and off the filtered list
window.
CHAPTER 9 I WEB BROWSING WITH FIREFOX
189

There are add-ons for everything: add-on picture and video viewers, add-on dictionaries
and translators, and even add-on eBay monitoring tools (see my list of suggested add-ons at
the end of the chapter). Do a keyword search on the Add-ons windows (refer to Figure 9-7)
and you’re likely to be surprised at the number of add-ons that are being developed and made
available to Firefox users.
Configuring the Firefox Homepage
I mentioned earlier that clicking the Homepage button on the toolbar always takes your
browser to the web site designated as the homepage. To set your homepage, click the Edit
menu and choose Preferences. The Firefox Preferences window opens (see Figure 9-14).
Figure 9-14. Change the homepage that appears when Firefox opens.
Enter the web site you want to designate as your homepage in the Home Page text box
and click the Close button. I configured http://www.cnn.com as my homepage web site
because I always like to read the latest news when I open my web browser.
Deleting Web Browsing History
Many Internet users don’t like a history of their browsing kept stored on the computer. Almost
all web browsers can erase your browsing history automatically, but it’s also easy to manually
CHAPTER 9 I WEB BROWSING WITH FIREFOX
190

erase the browsing history. Click the Tools menu and choose the Clear Private Data option 
(see Figure 9-15).
Figure 9-15. Use the Tools menu to clear your web browsing history.
A window opens (see Figure 9-16). You can check and uncheck the various options shown,
but if you want to clear your web browsing history, leave the first box in the list checked and
click the Clear Private Data Now button.
Figure 9-16. You can purge browsing history and other stored content.
Changing the Search Engine
I use Google for my search engine, but I rarely use it for searching book titles. Instead, I prefer
to use Amazon.com. But instead of having to visit http://www.amazon.com to search for a book
I’m interested in, I can click the downward-pointing arrow indicated in Figure 9-17 and select
Amazon.com from the list. 
CHAPTER 9 I WEB BROWSING WITH FIREFOX
191

Figure 9-17. You’re not just limited to Google when performing searches.
I type in my book title or keywords, and my search results will be pulled from
Amazon.com’s database of books, not the entire Internet that Google would provide. Final
results are displayed using whatever search site is selected. Figure 9-18 shows that I’m directed
straight to Amazon.com’s web site; the search term I entered (Ubuntu) is passed along, and a
presorted list of possible books is provided. If you do this, don’t forget to change the search
engine back!
Figure 9-18. Amazon.com provides me a list of books that match my Firefox browser’s keyword.
CHAPTER 9 I WEB BROWSING WITH FIREFOX
192

Changing the View
Firefox gives you a lot of flexibility when it comes to viewing web sites. Click the View menu,
select the Zoom option, and a fly-out menu appears that lets you zoom in and out (see Figure
9-19). I like the Zoom Out feature (which shrinks the page) because I can view a larger piece of
the entire web page instead of having to scroll.
Figure 9-19. Viewing options include the ability to zoom in and out on a page.
The View menu also allows you to turn on and off the various toolbars that Firefox pro-
vides. For example, in Figure 9-20, I completely turned off the Bookmarks bar and left only the
Firefox toolbar; this is done by clicking View, selecting Toolbars, and then unchecking the
Bookmarks Toolbar option. I can uncheck the Delicious Toolbar option and provide even
more viewing space for web pages; the web site viewing area expands to fill the new space
provided.
Figure 9-20. Turning off a toolbar provides more viewable space for web pages.
CHAPTER 9 I WEB BROWSING WITH FIREFOX
193

Summarizing Firefox
Firefox is my favorite web browser. Google has released its new Chrome, but it doesn’t have
the cool add-ons feature that Firefox provides; I like its speed and very simple interface, but I
don’t think it’s quite “there” yet. Microsoft Internet Explorer always seemed to crash on me at
various times. And somehow it always managed to catch nasty, malicious software that dam-
aged it and required me to uninstall and reinstall the browser. Thanks, but no thanks. I tried
Safari, but it just doesn’t compare to my experience with Firefox.
I showed you how to find add-ons and walked you through installing my most-used add-
on: Delicious. I have hundreds of bookmarked web pages that I like to go back and revisit, and
Delicious doesn’t require me to remember the web address. All I need to do is scroll down my
list of keywords (visible in Figure 9-13) and I can usually refresh my memory of the keywords
that are related to the site I’m looking for. Yes, add-ons are great, and you should spend some
time scanning through all the various categories for other useful ones.
At its core, Firefox is a web browser. It comes preinstalled with the Ubuntu operating sys-
tem installation, so you’re ready to go. All the standard features you’ll need in a browser can be
found in Firefox. Throw in the ability to install add-ons, and you’ll probably find that Firefox is
your new favorite web browser, too.
Suggested Add-ons for Firefox
Here’s a simple list of some add-ons that you might like to download and try with Firefox:
• Block annoying pop-up advertisements with AdBlock Plus:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865
• Get a notice when e-mail is delivered to your Gmail account by using Gmail Notifier:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/173
• Quickly find out the current and future weather forecast for your area by installing 
1-ClickWeather: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1035
• Track your packages (UPS, FedEx, DHL) by using the PackageMapping.com Add-on:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3778
What’s Next?
Up next in Chapter 10, I’ll introduce you to two of my most favorite applications. I can’t live
without them! E-mail and a good calendar/scheduling tool are absolute must-haves when it
comes to work and personal life. The fact that both of these applications are 100 percent free
and simple to use is just icing on the cake. Let's go take a look.
CHAPTER 9 I WEB BROWSING WITH FIREFOX
194

Google E-mail and Calendar
While on vacation a few years ago, I received an urgent phone call from a business col-
league. He needed a copy of an e-mail that he’d deleted as well as an e-mail address contained
in that message. Yes, I did have the e-mail, but unfortunately it was stored on my computer
back in my home office—about 350 miles away. After a few hours of phone calls, voice mes-
sages, and returned calls, I was able to find someone else who had the original e-mail and was
willing to assist.
It made me realize how dependent I had become on my e-mail. All my messages, con-
tacts, and calendar information was stored on my computer’s hard drive, and I had no method
for accessing it unless I was sitting at my computer. I knew this wasn’t an ideal solution.
A few months after this incident, a friend introduced me to Google E-mail, or Gmail. He
also showed me Google’s Calendar application and how the e-mail and calendar worked
together and could be accessed from any computer with Internet connectivity and a web
browser. Then he mentioned that Gmail and Calendar were both free to use. I was sold. It took
me about one month to transition my e-mail, contacts, and appointments and due dates over
to Gmail and Google Calendar, and I’ve never looked back. By the end of this chapter, you may
very well make the same decision I did after seeing these two tools in action.
Welcome to Gmail and Google Calendar
First, the good news: Gmail and Google Calendar are 100 percent free to use. Both services are
provided by Google to registered users (more on that shortly). Is there any bad news? Maybe.
Google provides these services to you for free and in exchange places small advertisements on
the screen when you open an e-mail message. These advertisements are small, are text-only,
and never obstruct your view of your e-mail. Take a look at Figure 10-1, which shows an open
Gmail message and an advertisement on the right.
195
C H A P T E R  1 0

Figure 10-1. Gmail messages appear in the middle of the screen with advertisements on the right.
Google Calendar, shown in Figure 10-2, doesn’t have any advertisements, but Google
could change that at any time. The Calendar offers various views such as a daily or monthly
view, and it gives you numerous ways to enter appointments as well as receive reminders; I’ll
show you how this is done later.
INote Gmail and Google Calendar don’t have version numbers. You don’t upgrade these services because
there is no software installed on your computer. You’re using your web browser to access them, and updates
made by Google will be automatically visible to you when you next log on to Gmail or Calendar.
196
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR

Figure 10-2. Google Calendar can display events in a monthly view like this or in other views.
Along the top edge of Figure 10-2, you’ll see various links that give you access to Gmail
and other Google applications. Documents, for example, gives you access to Google’s free
online word processor, spreadsheet, and slideshow applications (Google Docs is covered in
Chapter 11). Feel free to click these links and see what other free services Google makes 
available to you.
Before you move on and learn how these two tools are used, however, you’ll need to 
create a Google user account. 
Point your web browser to mail.google.com. You should see a screen like the one shown in
Figure 10-3.
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR

Figure 10-3. Sign up to use Gmail and Calendar by creating a Google user account.
Click the “Sign up for Gmail” link and you’ll be taken to a screen similar to the one shown
in Figure 10-4. 
Figure 10-4. Provide information to create a Google user account.
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
198

You’ll be asked to provide your first and last name as well as your desired username (login
name). Click the “check availability!” button to make sure that your username is available. If it
isn’t, try a different one until you get one that isn’t taken. Enter a password and reenter the
password in the required fields. Be sure to choose a password that Gmail recognizes as a
strong password; your password will be given a rating that is visible to the right as you type it.
If it’s not strong, consider changing it to avoid potential security risks. Complete the remain-
ing tasks on the screen and then click the “I accept. Create my account.” button to acknowl-
edge that you’ve read through the Terms of Service and are ready to start using Gmail and 
Calendar. Next, click the “I’m ready—show me my account” link in the upper-right corner of
the screen.
Gmail will open, and you’ll see that a message is waiting for you from the Gmail team, as
shown in Figure 10-5. Congratulations! You’re a Gmail user (and you have access to Calendar
and the other free Google applications, too).
Because you should now have Gmail open and running in a browser window, take a look
along the left side of the screen shown in Figure 10-5. You’ll see a list of some (hopefully)
familiar folders (Inbox, Sent Mail, Drafts, Spam, and Trash) and a few new ones, including
Starred and Chats. The (1) next to Inbox shows that one unread message is waiting.
Figure 10-5. Messages are stored in folders such as Inbox, Spam, and Trash.
Clicking any of the folders shows any messages stored inside. Messages are displayed to
the right of the folder list, and clicking a message opens it for viewing and other options such
as replying and forwarding.
Figure 10-6 shows that I’ve clicked the e-mail from Victor and opened it. I can respond to
Victor by simply typing my response in the box below the message and clicking the Send but-
ton that appears, but I can also do more than simply reply.
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
199

Figure 10-6. After opening an e-mail, you have many options.
Along the top edge of Figure 10-6 you’ll see six buttons: Archive, “Report spam,” Delete,
“Move to,” Labels, and “More actions.” The Archive button sends the message to the All Mail
folder, the “Report spam” button sends it to the Spam folder (and blocks that e-mail address
from hitting your Inbox again), and the Delete button sends it to the Trash folder. The “Move
to,” Labels, and “More actions” buttons provide other interesting options that I’ll cover shortly. 
Click the Reply button shown in the upper-right corner of the e-mail message and you’ll
see the list of options shown in Figure 10-7.
Figure 10-7. The Reply button offers many options for responding to e-mail.
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR

Familiar options include Reply, “Reply to all,” Forward, Print, and “Delete this message.”
The “Filter message like this” option is useful (I’ll cover it later in the chapter). If the message
is an attempt to get you to provide financial or personal information (called phishing), click
“Report phishing,” and Google will investigate the sender. 
You can click the Help link in the upper-right corner of the Gmail screen to learn more
about any of Gmail’s features. I’ll be showing you more of Gmail’s features later in the chapter,
but for now let’s take a quick look at Calendar by clicking the Calendar link in the upper-left
corner of the screen (refer to Figure 10-6).
When Calendar first opens, it looks like the screen shown in Figure 10-8.
Figure 10-8. Calendar first opens in the Week view.
This is called the Week view; it shows the current week displayed in column form.
Appointments appear as boxes. You might like this view, but for now, press M on your key-
board, and the Calendar will change to the Month view, as shown in Figure 10-9. This is my
preferred view and the one I’ll be using throughout the chapter.
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
201

Figure 10-9. The Month view in Calendar provides a complete overview of February 
appointments.
Additional views are Day, 4 Days, and Agenda. Click each of these tabs to see how the 
calendar is displayed; you might prefer a different view. You can click the left and right arrows
indicated in Figure 10-9 to move forward and backward. In this example, one click of the back
button allows me to jump back to January 2009, and a single click of the forward button
changes the calendar to March 2009.
For most calendar users, the single most important activity is adding appointments (or
events in Google terminology). You can click the Create Event button indicated in Figure 10-10,
type in a description, and provide the starting and ending dates and times. Click the Save but-
ton when done; your event will be added to the calendar.
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
202

Figure 10-10. Click the Create Event button to provide details for an appointment.
A much easier method is to simply click the day (in Month view) or time (in Day or Week
view), and a small window appears (see Figure 10-11). In this example, I provide a short
description and the time of the event after clicking February 26. I click the Create Event button
to finalize the event.
Figure 10-11. Clicking a specific day allows you to enter a brief description and time.
My event is added, and Google Calendar is smart enough to figure out from my descrip-
tion the time and will fill in the details (see Figure 10-12).
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
203

Figure 10-12. Google Calendar examines the event’s details and adds the appointment.
If that were all there was to Gmail and Google Calendar, you probably wouldn’t be too
impressed. But these two applications offer much more than simply reading and replying to 
e-mail and entering appointments. Let’s take a look. 
Gmail and Calendar Features
Gmail and Calendar have more hidden gems than I could ever hope to cover in a single chap-
ter. The following sections describe some of the most useful features of Gmail and Calendar. 
ITip One of my favorite places to learn all kinds of Gmail and Calendar tricks is http://www.
lifehacker.com. Visit this great blog and do a keyword search using “Gmail” or “Google Calendar”
and you’ll find dozens of articles that describe hidden features and how to use them.
Organizing E-mail Using Labels
Take a look at Figure 10-13. Notice those small blocks in front of some of the Subject lines? The
blocks, which are called labels, make organizing and searching for messages extremely simple. 
INote I love labels. They’re my favorite feature in Gmail—seriously! They’re extremely useful for organiz-
ing your Inbox. Even better, however, is that you can search your Sent Mail and All Mail folders by using
labels. You might be used to using folders with subfolders (and they might contain subfolders), so searching
for messages can be a real pain. Not with labels! After a message has a label applied, it can be found
quickly, no matter where it’s stored. I’ll show you how this works in more detail shortly.
You can pick the color and name of each label to make it more visually pleasing. For
example, my Urgent label is bright red and makes any e-mail tagged as Urgent difficult to
ignore!
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
204

Figure 10-13. Labels make e-mail easier to organize and search.
If I click any label on the left side of the screen (refer to Figure 10-13), only the e-mail
tagged with that label displays. Figure 10-14 shows that I clicked the CNC label (colored
orange) and I can review my message concerning the CNC book without having to dig through
hundreds or even thousands of other messages.
Figure 10-14. Clicking a label filters out all e-mail not tagged with that label.
How do you create your own labels? Simple. Click the “Edit labels” button shown in the
lower-left corner of Figure 10-13. You see a window similar to the one shown in Figure 10-15.
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
205

Figure 10-15. Create a new label, or delete or rename an existing one.
Enter your label name, as indicated in the figure, and click the Create button; in this
example, I’m creating a new label titled Special. Your new label will appear in the list of 
labels. Click the small colored square to the right of your label to pick a color. Notice also in
Figure 10-15 that you can rename or remove an existing label by clicking the appropriate link
to the right of any label.
To assign a label to a message, place a check in the box to the left of the message, as
shown in Figure 10-16. Click the Labels button and select a label from the drop-down list. An
e-mail can have multiple labels, but you must perform this action for each label to be added.
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
206

Figure 10-16. Select a message and use the Labels drop-down list to assign a label.
Using labels is a great way to make it easier for you to find that “e-mail in a haystack,” but
the previous steps require you to assign labels after you’ve received a message. Wouldn’t it be
great if an incoming message could automatically be tagged with a label of your choice? Well,
it can—with another nice feature of Gmail called Filters.
Organize E-mail with Filters
I want all incoming e-mail from Apress (the wonderful publisher of this fine book) to be
tagged with a bright blue label. To do this, I must first create an Apress label (see preceding
section on creating labels). Once that’s done, I click the Settings menu and click the Filters tab
(see Figure 10-17).
Figure 10-17. Use the Settings option to access the Filters feature.
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
207

Click “Create a new filter” at the bottom of the page and you’ll see a screen like the one
shown in Figure 10-18. You can enter someone’s e-mail address (or a portion of it, leaving out
username@ and leaving just apress.com) in the From field. You can also create filters that search
for words in the Subject line or in the actual text of the message. Click the Next Step button
when done.
Figure 10-18. Create a filter using an e-mail address or words that may be in a message.
On the next screen, shown in Figure 10-19, place a checkmark next to “Apply the label”
and select the label from the drop-down list. Click the Create Filter button to finish. 
Figure 10-19. Select the label that will tag any message that matches your new filter.
Figure 10-20 shows that my new filter is added; I can click the edit link to make changes or
remove it by clicking the delete link.
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
208

Figure 10-20. The new filter is turned on, and incoming messages will be checked for matches.
If any messages come in from anyone at Apress, I’ll now see a nice blue Apress label that
makes them easier to spot.
Organizing Calendars
Now let’s jump to the Calendar application. Your Calendar is available after you log in to
Google and (by default) it’s visible only to you. Google provides a nice feature, however, that
allows you to create multiple calendars (such as a Work calendar and a Home calendar).
Again, these calendars are private and visible only to you, but there is a way to make one or
more of your calendars viewable by anyone with a web browser. Here’s how it’s done.
First, open Calendar and click the Settings link in the upper-right corner of the screen
(refer to Figure 10-17). The Settings link can be found here on all the Google applications, not
just Gmail.
Click the Calendars tab; then click the “Create new calendar” button (see Figure 10-21).
Figure 10-21. You can create as many additional calendars as you like.
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
209

Provide a calendar name and other information, as shown in Figure 10-22. Notice that
you can either make the calendar viewable to everyone (anyone with Internet access and a
browser) or you can specify individuals by entering their e-mail addresses at the bottom of the
screen.
Figure 10-22. Give your calendar a name and decide who can see it.
If you provide an e-mail address, click the Add Person button and use the Permission 
Settings drop-down list to further define what this person can and can’t view. A few of the
options include “See all event details” and “Make changes to events.”
Click the Create Calendar button, and the new calendar will be listed underneath the 
private calendar (see Figure 10-23).
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
210

Figure 10-23. My Personal Calendar is added to the list of calendars.
Now, when I add an event to my calendar by clicking a particular date, I have a new 
Calendar drop-down list, as shown in Figure 10-24. I can select from the list which calendar
will contain the event before clicking the Create Event button. Easy!
Figure 10-24. When creating an event, you have to decide which calendar will list the event.
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR

Calendar Reminders Using Text Messaging
I don’t spend every minute of my day in front of my computer, and I’m sure you don’t, either.
Google Calendar can be configured to send an e-mail reminder to you or pop an alert up on
your screen at a preconfigured time. But again this usually requires that you be sitting in front
of your computer to see the alert or read the e-mail.
That’s why I love that Google Calendar will also send a text message to my mobile phone.
If I’m out running errands, I almost always have my mobile phone with me, and getting text
message reminders is a great feature. Here’s how it works. 
First, you need to enable Google Calendar to send you text messages. To do this, click the
Settings link in the upper-right corner and then click the Mobile Setup link. You’ll see the win-
dow shown in Figure 10-25.
Figure 10-25. You can enable your mobile phone to receive text messages from Google.
Enter your mobile phone number in the “Phone number” text box and click the Send 
Verification Code button. If your mobile phone carrier is supported by Google (most are),
you’ll receive a test message with a verification code. Enter that code in the “Verification code”
text box shown in Figure 10-25, click the “Finish setup” button, and you’re ready to start
receiving text message alerts.
Now create an event, as shown in Figure 10-26, and click the Create Event button after
typing in your description and date/time. 
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
212

Figure 10-26. Create an event for which you want to be reminded via a mobile phone text 
message.
Next, click on your new event and click the “edit event details” link. Under the Options
area of the screen shown in Figure 10-27, click the “Add a reminder” link. A new reminder
option called SMS will appear, as shown in Figure 10-27. 
INote Two other reminder options are available: Email and Pop-up. Figure 10-27 shows that a pop-up
alert will appear 10 minutes prior to the event, and an e-mail will be sent one hour prior to the event. Modify
the times as you see fit or click the “remove” link to delete a reminder option.
Figure 10-27. Email and Pop-up alerts are standard, but you can also add a text message alert.
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
213

In this example, I scheduled Google Calendar to send me a text message reminder two
hours prior to the actual event. Click the Save button when you’re done; a text message alert
keeps you from forgetting your appointment.
Summarizing Gmail and Calendar
There are hundreds of web sites and books available that provide more details, more feature
coverage, and more tips for using these two applications. That should tell you a little bit about
how popular these two tools are; fans of Gmail and Google Calendar are everywhere.
Gmail and Calendar are just two Google applications, but they’re among the most popu-
lar with users; they’re free, easy to use, and make life easier for people who are always on the
go. I can't imagine going back to accessing my e-mail and appointments from just one com-
puter. If you’re finding yourself in that situation, Gmail and Calendar are a good first step to
breaking away and letting Internet access provide you with your e-mail and appointments
from any computer with online access.
But don't stop there. Google also offers more free applications that liberate you from
using a single computer. What are they?
What’s Next?
You just learned about Gmail and Calendar, but I’m guessing that you also occasionally write 
a letter. Others of you might use a spreadsheet for business (or pleasure—whatever makes you
happy). And some of you might need to give an occasional presentation at school, work, or
event. Well, you’ll be pleased to know that Google has a solution for each of those needs. It’s
called Google Docs, and Chapter 11 will tell you all about it.
CHAPTER 10 I GOOGLE E-MAIL AND CALENDAR
214

Google Documents
Today, it’s almost impossible to purchase a new computer without finding a preinstalled 
productivity suite installed. And by productivity, I’m talking about a collection of software 
that typically includes a word processor, a spreadsheet, an e-mail/calendar app and some-
times a slideshow application, so it is sometimes also referred to as an office suite. If you
installed Ubuntu on your U-PC, the OpenOffice.org office suite is already installed.
Earlier in the book, I introduced you to the OpenOffice.org office suite that consists of
Writer, Calc, and Impress (refer to Chapters 5, 6, and 7, respectively). OpenOffice is an excep-
tional office suite that is 100 percent free to download and install (note the emphasis), but 
it’s not the only free office suite. Google also has an office suite that is growing in popularity
and offers some really nice features. Why am I including another office suite chapter when
OpenOffice comes so highly recommended? Simple—because Google’s office suite requires 
no download or installation of any software, and the tools are always available from any online
computer’s web browser. That’s why I like Google’s solution. 
But it’s not the only difference, as you’ll soon see; by the end of this chapter, you’ll have
enough information to decide which of the two office suites will most meet your needs. You
might even find yourself using both, as I do, depending on your circumstances and the job 
at hand.
Welcome to Google Docs
OpenOffice.org isn’t the only organization to offer a free office suite. Google has entered the
arena with its own collection of applications called Google Documents—Google Docs for
short.
Google Docs is accessed through your web browser. After logging in to any Google service
(such as Gmail or Google Calendar, covered in Chapter 10), click the Documents link in the
top-right corner of the page, as shown in Figure 11-1. The screen shown in this figure is the
Google Docs main page. From this page, you can create new documents such as a spreadsheet
215
C H A P T E R  1 1

or slideshow, edit or delete existing documents, create folders to organize documents, and
more.
Figure 11-1. Google Docs is an online office suite that resides in your web browser.
Google Docs has a simple user toolbar (see Figure 11-2).
216
CHAPTER 11 I GOOGLE DOCUMENTS

Figure 11-2. Google Docs’ toolbar doesn’t complicate things with hundreds of options.
Feel free to click the New, “Move to,” and “More actions” drop-down menus to see what’s
available. You’ll see some of these menus and buttons used later in the chapter.
Figure 11-3 shows the left side of the screen, in which Google Docs lists folder locations.
Google Docs doesn’t limit you to its preconfigured folders; you can create your own subfolders
to help you organize your projects and documents. In this example, I created a folder of my
own Not So Secret Projects, listed under “All folders.”
Figure 11-3. Google Docs uses a simple folder hierarchy for organizing documents.
To create your own folders, click the New menu, select Folders, and provide a name. Click
the Save button when done, and your new folder will be added under “All folders.” (Note also
in Figure 11-3 the two folders called “Owned by me” and “Shared with.” They will be covered
later in the chapter, but I hope you’re seeing a hint of a feature offered by Google Docs.)
Finally, the majority of the Google Docs main page is taken up with displaying docu-
ments. Figure 11-4 shows three documents created by me: a presentation titled How to Fix a
Flat, a spreadsheet titled Recipe Ingredient Tests, and a word processing document titled
Super Secret Book Proposal. I click a document to open it or place a check in the box beside 
its name and to select an option on the toolbar (such as Delete or Rename). 
CHAPTER 11 I GOOGLE DOCUMENTS
217

Figure 11-4. Documents are listed on the right side of the main page.
Because my documents are stored with Google Docs, I can access these files from any
computer with Internet access and a web browser. Think about it—I no longer need be a pris-
oner to my home office when I want to work on a file. I don’t even have to carry my laptop
with me when I travel; as long as I know I’ll have a web browser with an Internet connection
where I’m going, I can access my documents by logging into Google Docs and using its tools. 
ICaution Word processing documents, spreadsheets, and other files created using Google Docs are not
always 100 percent compatible with applications such as Microsoft Word or Excel (or vice versa). Even
though Google Docs will allow you to save documents in “standard” formats, you should always verify that 
a file can be opened properly with any other applications you anticipate the file might be opened, edited, or
printed with.
CHAPTER 11 I GOOGLE DOCUMENTS
218

Now, don’t laugh; Google’s marketing department didn’t spend a fortune coming up 
with clever names for its office suite tools. For its word processor, the application is called
Document. Take a guess what it calls its spreadsheet application? Yep: Spreadsheet. And its
slideshow tool goes by the impressive moniker of Presentation. (I told you not to laugh.)
But ignoring the simplistic names, these three tools do exactly what their names describe:
you use them to create a document, spreadsheet, or presentation.
To create a word processing document, click the New button and choose Document. 
Figure 11-5 shows a blank Document file.
Figure 11-5. Google Docs offers Document as its word processing application.
Spend some time clicking the various menus and seeing which options are available. 
The toolbar contains a minimum number of buttons, but somehow Google has managed to
provide just what I need and nothing more. Another feature I like is the large blank document
screen; the absence of screen clutter can be a shock at first, but you’ll come to enjoy it.
ITip Be sure to click the Save button in the upper-right corner often; Google has made it extremely easy
and fast to locate, so there’s no excuse for accidentally losing any of your work. Likewise, instead of clicking
the File menu and choosing Close, simply click the Save & Close button and you can save your work and exit
Document at once.
To open a new spreadsheet, click the New button on the Google Docs main page and
select Spreadsheet. Figure 11-6 shows a blank Spreadsheet worksheet.
CHAPTER 11 I GOOGLE DOCUMENTS
219

Figure 11-6. Spreadsheet is Google Docs’ answer to a spreadsheet application.
Google Docs Spreadsheet works like every other spreadsheet you’ve probably used before;
click the Help menu if you’re unfamiliar with using a spreadsheet; Google Docs will provide
you with plenty of assistance if you select the Google Docs Help Center option. 
INote For some reason, Spreadsheet does not have a Save & Close button like Document. To close your
worksheet, click the File menu and choose Save & Close.
Finally, to create a new slideshow, click the New button and select Presentation. A blank
slideshow file will open, as shown in Figure 11-7.
CHAPTER 11 I GOOGLE DOCUMENTS
220

Figure 11-7. Google Docs Presentation allows you to create your own slideshows.
As you add slides to your presentation, a thumbnail view of each slide will appear in the
left column. Clicking a slide thumbnail will display the larger slide to the right, in which you
can enter text, video, pictures, and formatting. 
A single chapter can’t do justice to providing you with complete instructions on using
Document, Spreadsheet, and Presentation. But my purpose for this chapter isn’t to show you
how to use these three applications; instead, I want to demonstrate what I believe is the real
power available when you use Google Docs: sharing your files with the world, a group, or a
single individual, and collaborating on a document with other Google Docs users. (Google
Docs provides complete online documentation for using all three tools if you click the Help
link in the upper-right corner of the screen.)
Working with Google Docs
If you never plan to publish or collaborate on any files you create with Google Docs with
another person, feel free to skip this section. But you’ll be missing out on what I consider to be
one of the real advantages of using Google Docs (the other being mobility and accessing your
files from any online computer). Here’s how collaboration and publishing work.
CHAPTER 11 I GOOGLE DOCUMENTS
221

Collaborating with Google Docs
Maybe you’ve spent months or years writing that 900-page Great American Novel and are
ready to get some opinions from a friend or family member. You might just as likely have cre-
ated the perfect spreadsheet that helps a new car buyer fill in all the numbers to calculate her
monthly payment and you want to share it with the world. Or maybe you’re like me and have
given some presentations in the past and received e-mail from audience members requesting
a copy of the slideshow. Well, Google Docs makes it extremely easy to share your work with a
single person, a group, or the world at large. And it all starts by opening the file you want to
share. 
Figure 11-8 shows one of my Document files titled Super Secret Book Proposal (the fol-
lowing steps also work for Spreadsheet and Presentation files).
Figure 11-8. Calendar first opens in the Week view.
Click the Share button in the upper-right corner of the screen and you’ll see a list of
options (see Figure 11-9).
Figure 11-9. The Share button offers numerous sharing options for the document.
The second option in the list, “Email as attachment,” is fairly self-explanatory; your 
document will be sent out using your Gmail account to any e-mail addresses you specify in
the pop-up window. You can also enter a message to the recipients, just like a regular e-mail
message.
Click the first option, “Share with others,” and a window will open (see Figure 11-10).
CHAPTER 11 I GOOGLE DOCUMENTS
222

Figure 11-10. You can share the document and grant privileges such as the ability to view or edit.
Notice in the upper-left portion of the screen that anyone you choose to share your docu-
ment with will be designated as either a collaborator or a viewer. Collaborators can edit the
document and even invite other collaborators. I’ll go into more detail on how this works in the
next section.
Viewers can only read a document or presentation or spreadsheet. Any changes a viewer
attempts to make to the open document will be unsuccessful.
Because the focus in this section is collaborating with other users, you’ll leave “as collabo-
rators” selected. (For those who you want to allow only viewing privileges, select “as viewers”
and perform the same steps described as follows—just keep in mind that viewers will not be
allowed to make changes to your documents.) Type in the e-mail addresses of those you want
to give collaboration privileges in the box, as shown in Figure 11-10. In this example, I entered
jktechwriter@gmail.com.
You’ll also want to consider the two Advanced permissions available as check boxes in the
lower-left corner—“Collaborators may invite others” and “Invitations may be used by any-
one”—which will allow you or any collaborator to invite an entire mailing list. By default, both
boxes are checked, so uncheck any option that doesn’t meet your goals. (For example, if you
want only one collaborator to provide feedback and changes for your new book, uncheck both
boxes and prevent that person from allowing anyone else to possibly view it.)
After you enter one or more e-mail addresses and verify the Advanced permissions you
want to give or revoke, click the “Invite collaborators” button. You’ll see a window open (see
Figure 11-11).
CHAPTER 11 I GOOGLE DOCUMENTS
223

Figure 11-11. It can be helpful to tell your invitees that they have access to a document.
Enter a brief (or detailed) message to the invitee(s) and click the Send button. Each invi-
tee will receive an e-mail, notifying them that they have collaborator or viewer status for your
document and a link directly to the document.
As you add collaborators (or viewers), the list on the right side of the screen shown in 
Figure 11-12 shows those persons. Click the x on the right of any name to remove it as a 
collaborator or viewer.
Figure 11-12. Collaborators and viewers are listed and can be easily deleted.
CHAPTER 11 I GOOGLE DOCUMENTS
224

A collaborator can open and edit the document at this point. If you have the document
open at the same time, you’ll see an alert in the lower-right corner of the screen that tells you
who else is viewing or editing your document (see Figure 11-13).
Figure 11-13. Google Docs alerts you to anyone else viewing or editing your open document.
Suppose that both of you make changes to the document. Which changes get saved?
Google Docs autosaves frequently, and a timestamp is added to the right of the document
name (refer to Figure 11-13). This timestamp also lists the name of the last person to make
changes. Whomever makes the last change to the document will have their changes saved;
that is, until someone else modifies the document. This can be frustrating if you are editing 
a document simultaneously, which is why Google Docs lets you know when other users are
editing and who made the last saved changes.
With Document and Presentation, anyone viewing or editing a document simultaneously
is listed (refer to Figure 11-13), and care must be taken to not overwrite one another’s edits.
But Spreadsheet has one nice feature that I’m hopeful Google Docs will implement soon with
the other two applications: a chat window.
When editing a spreadsheet simultaneously, click the other user’s name. A chat window
opens along the right side of the screen, as shown in Figure 11-14. This is useful for discussing
changes to the spreadsheet before making them.
CHAPTER 11 I GOOGLE DOCUMENTS
225

Figure 11-14. A chat discussion within a spreadsheet window is useful for collaborating.
Earlier in the chapter I mentioned that you have numerous folders on the Google Docs
main page. Take a look at it now, and you should see the names of those who have either 
collaborator or viewing privileges following each document name (see Figure 11-15). This is 
a helpful reminder of who is accessing your files.
Figure 11-15. Those with collaborator or viewing privileges are listed after each document name.
CHAPTER 11 I GOOGLE DOCUMENTS
226

As you can see, allowing a select group of others to edit or view your document isn’t diffi-
cult to implement. Google Docs makes it simple to define whether a person can edit or view a
document. But what if you want to share a document with everyone—and by everyone, I
mean making it viewable (not editable) to anyone with Internet access and a web browser?
Well, Google Docs calls that publishing, and here’s how it’s done.
Publishing a Document
After you create a document, whether it be a spreadsheet, slideshow, or text file, Google Docs
makes it extremely simple for you to share it with the world. Google Docs converts the docu-
ment into a web page with its own address that can be typed in a web browser, e-mailed as a
link, or posted in a discussion forum.
To do this, first open the document. In this example, I’ll share a Presentation document 
I created. Click the Share button in the upper-right corner of the screen and select the Publish
option. 
Figure 11-16. You use the Publish option to share a document with the world via the Internet.
A window will open, similar to the one shown in Figure 11-17.
CHAPTER 11 I GOOGLE DOCUMENTS
227

Figure 11-17. Publishing a document creates a unique web address for the file.
Click the “Publish document” button shown in Figure 11-17 and you will be provided a
URL (see Figure 11-18). 
Figure 11-18. Google Docs provides the HTML code needed to share your document on your blog
or web site.
CHAPTER 11 I GOOGLE DOCUMENTS
228

As seen in Figure 11-18, Google Docs provides numerous options, depending on the type
of document being shared. At the top of the screen you’ll find the web address that can be 
e-mailed or posted on a web forum to point viewers to the slideshow. Below the web address, 
I can choose the size that my presentation will be displayed (Small, Medium, or Large). I can
also copy the HTML code at the bottom of the screen and paste it into any web page; the pres-
entation will be visible on that page. The right side of the screen shows a preview of what
viewers will see when they view the document.
Finally, I can also click the “Stop publishing” button at any time to remove the document
from the public domain.
For Document files, the Publishing options include the ability to post the document on a
blog. If you have a blog, click the “Post to blog” button, provide your credentials such as user-
name and password, and click the OK button to have the Document file posted to your blog.
(Visit http://www.blogger.com for more information on blogs as well as how to create your
own free blog.)
Publishing Spreadsheet files provides an option allowing you to display all worksheets or
just worksheet 1. (Although spreadsheets can have multiple worksheets, unfortunately your
only choices are All or Sheet 1.)
Summarizing Google Documents
Google Docs provides you with fully functional word processor, spreadsheet, and slideshow
applications. I won’t pretend that they’re feature-heavy and have every special option that
you’ll need, but they do work in a pinch, and the ability to access your Google Docs files from
any web browser, combined with the sharing and collaboration features, is growing the
Google Docs user base. This, in turn, is pushing Google to continually update Google Docs
with new features that users request. (Be on the lookout for the New Feature link that some-
times appears in the upper-right corner of any Google Docs page you are on; click it and you
can read about new options available to you). To submit your own request, click the Help link
in the upper-right corner of the main page and then click the Suggestions link on the right
side of the screen (see Figure 11-19). Let Google know what you like, dislike, and would love to
see added with respect to Google Docs.
CHAPTER 11 I GOOGLE DOCUMENTS
229

Figure 11-19. Google Docs provides many options for sharing a document.
So now you can compare the OpenOffice.org office suite to Google Docs and decide
which you prefer to use. If you want to reduce the number of applications installed on your
computer, Google Docs is for you. Combine it with Gmail and Calendar (see Chapter 10) and
you’ll have one lean machine when it comes to installed software!
What’s Next?
You’re almost done with the book! Chapter 12 will cover the remaining free applications that
come preinstalled with Ubuntu as well as some other free applications that might be of inter-
est to you.

More Apps to Consider
Many of the applications covered in previous chapters are included when you install
Ubuntu on your U-PC, but some are not. I’ve attempted to provide you with overviews of what
I believe will be the applications you’ll most likely use while running Ubuntu, but there are so
many more. This chapter provides brief overviews of additional applications that come with
the Ubuntu installation. 
In addition to the applications mentioned in this chapter, I’ll also include some web sites
that cover Ubuntu software developments and other web sites that are simply useful libraries
of existing Ubuntu-compatible apps for you to try. So, in no particular order, let’s take a look at
what else is out there for your U-PC.
Additional Preinstalled Apps
This section explains some of the other apps and tools that you get with the basic Ubuntu
installation. No added downloads are required.
Calculator
Every operating system seems to have a calculator app, and Ubuntu is no exception. Click the
Applications menu, and you’ll find the Calculator under the Accessories group. The calculator
has four different modes: Basic, Advanced, Financial, and Scientific. Switch between modes
using the View menu on the calendar. Figure 12-1 shows the calculator in Scientific mode.

C H A P T E R  1 2

Figure 12-1. The Ubuntu calculator is a standard accessory.
Text Editor
Sometimes you don’t need all the fancy fonts and options that OpenOffice Writer or Google
Docs Document provides. When you find that you just need to create a simple text document
(saved with the .txt file extension), click the Applications menu and select Text Editor from the
Accessories group (in techspeak, this application is called gedit). You’ll be happy to hear, how-
ever, that this Text Editor comes with a built-in spell checker that many simple text editors do
not provide. Figure 12-2 shows the Text Editor with its simple toolbar interface.

Figure 12-2. The Text Editor saves files in the .txt file format and has a spell checker.
Tomboy Notes
A tool that you might find interesting is Tomboy Notes. Click the Applications menu and
choose Tomboy Notes from the Accessories Group. Figure 12-3 shows the window that 
will open. 
CHAPTER 12 I MORE APPS TO CONSIDER
233

Figure 12-3. Tomboy Notes lets you organize your ideas and notes.
It’s easy to figure out, but in a nutshell, click the File menu and select New Notebook from
the Notebooks group. Give it a title and click the Create button. Your notebook will appear in
the left column. In this example, I created a new notebook titled Books. Next, click the File
menu and choose New. A blank note will open; click the blue text to rename the title and type
your note. Figure 12-4 shows my new note.
Figure 12-4. Give your note a title and enter your comments below.

Click the Notebook button at the top of the note and select the notebook in which it will
be stored. Figure 12-5 shows that I placed this note under my Books notebook. Double-click a
note to read it, modify it, or delete it. I also created my To Do List to hold any urgent tasks
(from my wife) or semiurgent tasks.
Figure 12-5. Tomboy Notes lets you organize your notes into notebooks.
There are many more options that Tomboy Notes provides, including using built-in
hyperlinks within notes that will let you jump from note to note with a single click. This is use-
ful if you have a lot of related notes that need to be kept separate but have shared content with
other notes. Tomboy Notes also provides the ability to search through all your notes for key-
words, as well as print and export notes to HTML.
Brasero Disc Burning
If your U-PC has a CD-RW or DVD-RW (capable of reading and writing to discs), you’ll want 
to check out Brasero, which lets you copy CDs/DVDs or write music or data to discs. If you
download any image files (.ISO format), Brasero can also burn (write) that image to a disc 
for you.
CHAPTER 12 I MORE APPS TO CONSIDER
235

INote When you purchase software in a box, you get one or more CDs or DVDs that are used to install the
application. But when it comes to free software, especially Ubuntu, the free offering is often available only as
a download; you’ll have to pay to have an installation disc sent to you (see Appendix B). To get around this,
many software developers offer the .ISO image file as a way to create your own installation disc(s). Brasero
will easily let you create your own installation file: download the .ISO file and click the Burn image button
(see Figure 12-6). Follow the instructions, and the installation disc will be burned quickly.
Click the Applications menu and select Brasero Disc Burning from the Sound & Video
group to open the application. Figure 12-6 shows Brasero’s simple interface. Insert a blank
CD-RW or DVD-RW disc, click the appropriate button (such as “Audio project” to make a
music CD for playing in your car), and follow the onscreen instructions. Brasero is fast
because it’s a no-frills burning application. I rarely use any other burning software these 
days because Brasero is so easy to use.
Figure 12-6. Brasero provides CD- and DVD-burning capabilities.
CHAPTER 12 I MORE APPS TO CONSIDER
236

Totem Movie Player
Your U-PC has a built-in DVD player that can be accessed by clicking the Applications menu
and selecting Totem Movie Player from the Sound & Video group. The application will open, 
as shown in Figure 12-7. 
Figure 12-7. Totem Movie Player can play DVDs as well as movies.
Insert your DVD (or click the Movie menu and choose Open to browse to the location of
any movie files stored on your hard drive). Use the Go menu as you would a remote control:
select menu options such as chapter selection, pause, rewind, and more.
ITip If you’re having difficulty getting Totem to play a movie, visit https://help.ubuntu.com/
community/RestrictedFormats and follow the instructions for your specific version of Ubuntu. A handful
of video file types are “turned off” during the initial install, but this is not a bug in your operating system.
To avoid licensing and legal issues with respect to certain proprietary technologies, the Ubuntu developers
require you, as the end user of the operating system, to “turn on” support for some media types.
CHAPTER 12 I MORE APPS TO CONSIDER
237

Rhythmbox Music Player
In addition to watching movies on your U-PC, you can also listen to your music CDs and mp3
music files that are stored on your hard drive. Click the Applications menu and select Rhythm-
box Music Player from the Sound & Video group. The application will open, as shown in 
Figure 12-8. 
Figure 12-8. Rhythmbox Music Player lets you listen to CDs, podcasts, and online radio stations.
If you insert a music CD into the CD/DVD drive, Rhythmbox will detect the disc and list
the titles in the center window. You can click the Play button at the top to start playing the CD
as well as use the Previous and Next buttons to select the song to play. 
Besides playing CDs, you can also listen to other sources (such as podcasts and online
radio stations) by selecting the desired option in the left pane. Figure 12-8 shows that I
selected the Radio option, and a list of online radio stations are listed in the center window.
Double-click a radio station to access and listen to it.

Ubuntu Application Resources
The Internet is both a blessing and a curse when it comes to finding applications for your
computer. There are simply so many web sites to sift through to find those diamonds in the
rough. Although I can’t point you to every great Ubuntu application out there, I can provide
you with some web sites that make a good attempt. Hopefully this list will get you pointed in
the right direction when you choose to expand the applications installed on your U-PC: 
• http://ubuntulinuxhelp.com/top-100-of-the-best-useful-opensource-applications/:
Can you go wrong with a list titled “Top 100 of the Best (Useful) OpenSource Applica-
tions?” The list breaks down applications by category (such as Audio and Productivity),
so be sure to scroll through it and see what’s there. I already found a dozen or more that
I downloaded and installed.
• http://ubuntuapplications.blogspot.com/2007/08/top-26-ubuntu-application-
sources.html: A sort of list of lists, this web site contains 26 of the best web sites for
finding Ubuntu-compatible applications. (I told you that there were too many Ubuntu-
related web sites to sift through, but these are some of the best you can find, so be sure
to bookmark the page.)
• http://www.emmaalvarez.com/2007/12/top-best-50-ubuntu-opensource.html: If you’re 
a software developer, graphic artist, animator, web designer, or a dabbler in any kind of
design work using your computer, the “Top 50 Ubuntu OpenSource Applications for
Design and Development” list is for you. It provides 2D, 3D, and animation software
links that work great with Ubuntu.
• http://ubuntulinuxhelp.com/top-12-best-games-for-ubuntu-linux-1-tremulous/: This
link will take you to the first of 12 games that have been described as the best games for
Ubuntu. After you tire of Solitaire, Blackjack, and Mines, try your hand at one or more
of these games and see that great games do exist for Ubuntu, not just Windows. (Grid-
wars is my favorite—I play it way too much. If you’re a child of the 1980s, this game will
bring back many memories.)
• http://www.freebrowsergamer.com/: If you want to play some games without installing
any software (or taking up any more of your valued hard drive space), check out this
site for free games that can be played through your web browser. Your U-PC has Firefox
already installed, so you’re ready to go. There are games for every interest, and all that’s
required is an Internet connection.
• http://www.skype.com/download/skype/linux/: How would you like to be able to speak
to friends, family, coworkers, and anyone else over the Internet at no charge? Skype lets
you do just that! With a broadband Internet connection (DSL or cable) and a micro-
phone, you can speak to anyone else running the Skype application (even those
running non-Linux versions) over the Internet for free! And if you have a webcam, you
can let the other person see your smiling face, too. (If both parties have webcams, you
have your own video-conferencing service.) Skype is a free application that installs
quickly and easily on your new U-PC.

• https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/ch09s03.html: If you’re a 
software developer (programmer), the official Ubuntu web site has compiled a list of
development tools that are compatible with Ubuntu. 
• https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AccessoriesApplications: There are a lot of appli-
cations and tools found under Ubuntu’s Application menu. My book doesn’t cover them
all, but this web site provides details on each and every one of them. You’ll find instruc-
tions for every built-in game, as well as all the other groups: Graphics, Internet, Sound
& Video, and more. Figure 12-8 shows the web page; click a group on the left side to
access the page dedicated to covering that group’s applications. Expect to spend some
time on this site!
• http://www.apress.com/book/view/1430219998: I’m a fan of Beginning Ubuntu Linux,
by Keir Thomas (from Apress). I own the third edition, but by the time you’re reading
this, the new fourth edition should be available. If you truly want to master all things
Ubuntu, this is the book for you.

What’s Next?
The appendices. Just kidding. 
You’ve reached the end of the book and I hope you now see just how useful, powerful, and
capable the Ubuntu operating system can be. Hopefully you’ve also seen that Ubuntu and
Ubuntu-compatible applications have a much lower demand on hardware than other operating
systems. If you purchased the hardware and built your own U-PC, as described in Chapter 1,
you’ve gone one step farther and proved that there’s simply no need to go spending huge
amounts of money on the latest/greatest hardware.
What’s next? Spread the word. Tell your friends, family, and coworkers about your experi-
ence with Ubuntu. (And if you built your own U-PC, go ahead a brag a little, too—not many
people are willing to try it, even though it’s not that difficult.) Tell them how little you spent 
on your new computer. Then tell them how much you spent on your operating system: zero.
Then tell them how much all your software set you back: zero again.
Maybe, just maybe, you’ll convince a few that the days of spending $1,000, $2,000, or even
more on a computer are over.

IAPPENDIX A

There are three methods available for obtaining an Ubuntu installation disc. All three meth-
ods start by visiting http://www.ubuntu.com and clicking the Get Ubuntu link along the left
side of the screen.
Method 1
Download the ISO image file and create an Ubuntu bootable disc. This will require a broad-
band connection to download the file (it’s almost 700MB in size) and a CD/DVD-RW device to
write the image to the disc. Click the “Download now” link and follow the directions to down-
load the ISO image file.
Note Simply copying the ISO image file to the disc does not work. Creating a bootable disc from an
image file requires that your CD/DVD software have the capability to write a bootable disc from an ISO file.
Consult your CD/DVD authoring software documentation for assistance.
Method 2
Buy a bootable CD or DVD with the Ubuntu installation files. Visit http://www.ubuntu.com/
getubuntu and click on the “Buy on CD or DVD” link and follow the directions to purchase a
disc.
Method 3
You may also obtain a bootable Ubuntu disc for free by clicking the “Request a free CD” 
link and following the directions. The disc will be shipped to you at no cost, but it will take
approximately 10 weeks for you to receive your free disk. (Purchasing the disc using Method 2
includes a shipping fee and provides a speedier delivery.)

Bibliography
The following list is only a jumping-off point; you’re sure to find more resources to help you
in your discovery of Ubuntu. 
INote Some of these resources are referenced in earlier chapters.
Web Sites
http://www.ubuntu.com: The official Ubuntu web site and the ideal place to download the latest
version and read about updates and new releases.
http://ubuntuforums.org/: More forums than you’ll probably ever have time to visit. Be sure to
check out the Absolute Beginner Talk at the top of the list—it’s a great place to start if you’re
new to Ubuntu and have one question—or a thousand!
www.ubuntu.com/support/communitysupport/: One of the best web sites for help with Ubuntu.
http://www.pcmech.com/byopc/: If you’re looking for more information on building your own
PC, this is a great site to visit. You’ll learn more details about the steps described in Chapter 1.
http://ubuntuclips.org/collections_3.html: This site contains videos that show the
installation of Ubuntu as well as how to download and create the installation disc.
http://www.getdeb.net/: Want more free software for your U-PC? This is the place! Be sure to
check out the Daily Top 10 list to see what other Ubuntu fans are downloading.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Windows_and_Linux: This site provides a
detailed comparison of Linux and Windows. Although it’s not 100 percent Ubuntu-focused,
the site can give you a better understanding of what Ubuntu can do.
http://lifehacker.com/search/Ubuntu/: Lifehacker is one of my favorite web sites and you’ll
find a wealth of information on Ubuntu by using this URL or just searching on “Ubuntu” 
at http://lifehacker.com.
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games: I’m not saying I play a lot of games, okay? But if
you just happen to be looking for some games to play on Ubuntu (other than the ones that
come preinstalled), this is a great listing of some of the best—available with links to
download and install.

APPENDIX C I BIBLIOGRAPHY
Books
http://www.apress.com/book/search—searchterm=Ubuntu: Every book that Apress publishes
concerning Ubuntu. Yes, it’s quite a list. This should tell you something about the success
and quality of Ubuntu.
http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470125055.html: No, you’re not a
dummy. Neither am I. But I own this book and it’s a great resource.
https://help.ubuntu.com/8.10/index.html: Yes, it’s a web site, but it’s the Ubuntu 8.10 official
documentation, and it’s extremely detailed. Print out pages that you find yourself refer-
encing often and keep them handy.
Must-Have Apps
The following are just a small sampling of some free applications that are not included with
Ubuntu but should be (in this author’s opinion).
http://www.skype.com/download/skype/linux/: Skype lets you make free “phone calls” to
anyone else running the Skype application. All it requires is a high-speed Internet
connection and a microphone. A webcam is optional, but it does allow video
communication if both parties have webcams.
http://www.gimp.org: GIMP is a much more advanced photo editing application than Picasa
(see Chapter 8). It’s completely open source and free to download. GIMP can be a bit
overwhelming to use at first, so be sure to check out some of the free tutorials hosted on
the GIMP web site. If you find you need more, Apress has one of the best books available
titled Beginning GIMP, Second Edition, by Akkana Peck.
http://deluge-torrent.org/: Deluge Torrent is a peer-to-peer application that will allow you
to download files and share files over the Internet. Peer-to-peer apps aren’t all used for
illegal purposes, and you might find yourself using Deluge Torrent to download missed
television shows, other free applications, and more. Not familiar with Torrent-style
applications? Check out http://www.what-is-torrent.com/ to find out more.
http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/: Flash is a plug-in for your web browser that
allows animation created using the Adobe Flash software to play onscreen. The good news
is that there is a version for Ubuntu users, so you won’t have to visit web sites and see a
bunch of error messages about how the Flash animation won’t display.
http://www.mythtv.org/: MythTV software allows you to turn your U-PC into a television
recorder (similar to TiVo), store recorded shows on your hard drive, and watch them later.
All it requires is the purchase of a TV tuner video card to your U-PC (usually around
$80–$120) and a large hard drive.
