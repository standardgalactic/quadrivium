Introduction 
This book is a practical course in translation from Arabic to English. It has 
grown out of a course piloted at the University of Durham, and has its 
origins in Thinking Translation, a course in French-English translation by 
Sandor Hervey and Ian Higgins, first published in 1992. The approach is 
essentially the same as in that book, but a number of key concepts, notably 
cultural transposition, compensation and genre, have been considerably 
redefined and clarified in the light of a decade's experience in teaching all 
five versions of the course - Gennan, Spanish and Italian, as well as French 
and Arabic. This book also contains topics not found in the versions for 
European languages, dealing with various fonns of repetition and semantic 
parallelism in Arabic, as well as a chapter on metaphor, which poses specific 
challenges in Arabic>English translation. 
'Can translation be taught?' The question is asked surprisingly often -
sometimes even by good translators, whom one would expect to know better. 
Certainly, as teachers of translation know, some people are naturally better at 
it than others. In this, aptitude for translation is no different from aptitude for 
any other activity: teaching and practice help anyone, including the most 
gifted, to perfonn at a higher level. Even Mozart had music lessons. 
Most of us, however, are not geniuses. Here again, anyone who has taught 
the subject knows that a structured course will help most students to become 
significantly better at translation - sometimes good enough to earn their 
living at it. This book offers just such a course. Its progressive exposition of 
different sorts of translation problem is accompanied with plenty of practice 
in developing a rationale for solving them. It is a course not in translation 
theory, but in translation method, encouraging thoughtful consideration of 
possible solutions to practical problems. Theoretical issues do inevitably 
arise, but the aim of the course is to develop proficiency in the method, not 
to investigate its theoretical implications. The theoretical notions that we 
apply are borrowed eclectically from translation theory and linguistics, solely 

2 
Thinking Arabic translation 
with this practical aim in mind. 
If this is not a course in translation theory or linguistics, it is not a 
language-teaching course either. The focus is on how to translate. It is assumed 
that the student already has a good command of Arabic and is familiar with 
the proper use of dictionaries and, where appropriate, databases. The course 
is therefore aimed at final-year undergraduates, and at postgraduates or others 
seeking an academic or professional qualification in translation. That said, 
the analytical attention given to a wide variety of texts means that students 
do learn a lot of Arabic - and probably a fair bit of English too. 
This last point is important. While our main aim is to improve quality in 
translation, it must be remembered that this quality requires the translator to 
have an adequate command of English as well as Arabic. Assuming that this 
is the case, translator training normally focuses on translation into the mother 
tongue, because higher quality is achieved in that direction than in translating 
into a foreign language. Hence the almost exclusive focus on translation into 
English in this course. By its very nature, however, the course is also useful 
for Arab students seeking to improve their skills in translation into English: 
this is a staple part of English studies throughout the Arab world, and Thinking 
Arabic Translation offers a new methodology and plenty of practical work in 
this area. 
The course has a progressive structure, with an overall movement from 
general genre-independent issues to specific genre-dependent ones. Chapters 
1-4 deal with the fundamental issues, options and alternatives of which a 
translator must be aware: translation as process, translation as product, cultural 
issues in translation, and the nature and crucial importance of compensation 
in translation. Chapters 5-11 deal with translation issues relating to key 
linguistic notions: semantics (denotative and connotative meaning, and 
metaphor), and the formal properties of text (considered on six levels of 
textual variables from the phonic to the intertextual). Chapters 12 and 13 
deal with stylistic issues (register, sociolect, dialect), and genre. Chapters 
14-16 focus on specific genres in which Arabic>English translators might do 
professional work: technical (scientific) translation, constitutional translation, 
and consumer-oriented translation. Finally, Chapter 17 deals with revision 
and editing. 
Chapter by chapter, then, the student is progressively trained to ask, and 
to answer, a series of questions that apply to any text given for translation. 
Pre-eminent among these are: 'What is the purpose of my translation, and 
what !lre the salient features of this text?' No translation is produced in a 
vacuum, and we stress throughout the course that the needs of the target 
audience and the requirements of the person commissioning the translation 
are primary factors in translation decisions. For this same reason, we always 
include a translation brief in the assignment. As for the salient features of the 
text, these are what add up to its specificity as typical or atypical of a 
particular genre or genres. Once its genre-membership, and therefore its 

Introduction 
3 
purpose, has been pinned down, the translator can decide on a strategy for 
meeting the translation brief. The student's attention is kept focused on this 
issue by the wide variety of genres found in the practicals: in addition to 
technical, legal and consumer-oriented texts, students are asked to work on 
various sorts of journalistic, literary, and academic texts, political speeches, 
tourist brochures, etc. 
The sorts of question that need to be asked in determining the salient 
features of any text are listed in the schema of textual matrices at the end of 
this Introduction. The schema amounts to a check-list of potentially relevant 
kinds of textual feature. On the whole, the features in the schema of textual 
matrices are presented in the order in which they arise in the course. However, 
there are two exceptions. Firstly, metaphor is included within the semantic 
matrix, where it most coherently belongs (its placing at Chapter II, after the 
chapters on the formal properties of text, is motivated by the fact that metaphor 
is a complex issue, with a bearing on stylistic and generic issues, discussed 
in Chapters 12 and 13, as well as semantic ones). Secondly, as a reminder of 
the prime importance of purpose and genre, the genre matrix is placed at the 
top of the schema. 
There are two reasons for keeping discussion of genre as such until Chapter 
13, even though its decisive importance is stressed throughout. The first is 
that the genre-membership of a text cannot be finally decided until the other 
salient features have been isolated. The second is that we have found that 
students are more confident and successful in responding to genre requirements 
after working on semantic and formal properties of texts and on language 
variety than before. This is particularly true of texts with hybrid genre-features. 
Apart from genre, the schema of textual matrices outlines the investigation, 
in Chapters 3 and 5-11, of translation issues raised by textual features. 
(Compensation, the subject of Chapter 4 ,  is not a textual feature, and so does 
not figure in the schema.) Students are advised to refer to the schema whenever 
they tackle a practical: it is a progressive reminder of what questions to ask 
of the text set for translation. 
While the course systematically builds up a methodological approach, we 
are not trying to 'mechanize' translation by offering some inflexible rule or 
recipe. Very much the opposite: translation is a creative activity, and the 
translator's personal responsibility is paramount. We therefore emphasize the 
need to recognize options and alternatives, the need for rational discussion, 
and the need for decision-making. Each chapter is intended for class discussion 
at the start of the corresponding seminar, and a lot of the practicals are best 
done by students working in small groups. This is to help students keep in 
mind that, whatever approach the translator adopts, it should be self-aware 
and methodical. 
The course is intended to fit into an academic timetable lasting one year. 
Each chapter needs at least 2 hours of seminar time. It is vital that each 
student should have the necessary reference books in class: a comprehensive

Thinking Arabic translation 
Arabic-English dictionary (we recommend Wehr), a similar-sized English­
Arabic dictionary, a monolingual Arabic dictionary (such as ti.LJ 1 u-' ෕ 1 
i)\...L 11 J 1996), an English dictionary and an English thesaurus. Some of the 
practical work will be done at home - sometimes individually, sometimes in 
groups - and handed in for assessment by the tutor. How often this is done 
will be decided by tutors and students between them. Full suggestions for 
teaching and assessment can be found in James Dickins, Sandor Hervey and 
Ian Higgins, Thinking Arabic Translation: Tutor's Handbook (Routledge 
2002), which can be obtained from the address given on the opening page of 
this book.

Prelillinaries to 
translation as a process 
1.1 BASIC DEFINITIONS 
An obvious place to begin a translation course is to examine translation as a 
process - what it is that the translator actually does. To do this, we must note 
at the outset a few basic terms that will be used throughout the course: 
Text Any given stretch of speech or writing assumed to make a coherent 
whole. A minimal text may consist of a single word - for instance, the 
road sign...LA 'stop' - provided this is construed as an independent message. 
A maximal text may run into thousands of pages. An example of a maximal 
text in Arabic would be the many volumes of j...,;-J I C:-:a.;L.:. ,-:-,1 
I 
s: 
.!l"lll" by the classical Islamic writer (5ු1 Ð֋ ୹ \ 
a 
0 
", 
sometimes referred to in English as Taban'sAnnals. 
Source Text (ST) The text requiring translation. 
Target Text (TT) The text which is a translation of the ST. 
Source Language (SL) The language in which the ST is spoken or written. 
Target Language (TL) The language into which the ST is to be translated. 
Strategy The translator's overall 'game-plan', consisting of a set of strategic 
decisions taken after an initial reading of the ST, but before starting 
detailed translation. 
Strategic decisions The first set of reasoned decisions taken by the translator. 
These are taken before starting the translation in detail, in response to the 
following questions: 'What is the message content of this particular ST? 
What are its salient linguistic features? What are its principal effects? 
What genre does it belong to and what audience is it aimed at? What are 
the functions and intended audience of my translation? What are the 
implications of these factors? If a choice has to be made among them, 
which ones should be given priority?' 

Preliminaries to translation as a process 
7 
Decisions of detail Reasoned decisions concerning the specific problems of 
grammar, lexis (vocabulary), etc., encountered in translating particular 
expressions in their particular context. Decisions of detail can only be 
made in the light of strategy. Naturally, however, problems of detail may 
arise during translating which raise unforeseen strategic issues and oblige 
the translator to refine the original strategy somewhat. 
With these terms in mind, the translation process can be broken down into 
two types of activity: understanding an ST and formulating a TT. These do 
not occur successively, but simultaneously; indeed, one often does not even 
realize that one has imperfectly understood the ST until coming up against a 
problem in formulating the TT. When this happens, it may be necessary to 
go back and reinterpret the ST in the light of one's new understanding of it. 
This reinterpretation sometimes means that the original strategy has to be 
revised, this revision in tum entailing changes to some of the decisions of 
detail already taken. Nevertheless, it is useful to discuss ST interpretation 
and TT formulation as different, separable processes. 
The component processes of translation are not different from familiar 
things that all speakers and listeners do every day. Comprehension and 
interpretation are processes that we all perform whenever we listen to or read 
a piece of linguistically imparted information. Understanding even the simplest 
message potentially involves all our experiential baggage - the knowledge, 
beliefs, suppositions, inferences and expectations that are the stuff of personal, 
social and cultural life. Understanding everyday messages is therefore not all 
that different from what a translator does when first confronting an ST - and 
it is certainly no less complicated. 
In everyday communication, evidence that a message has been understood 
may come from appropriate practical responses - for example, if someone 
has asked you for a spoon, and you give them a spoon and not a fork. Or it 
may come from an appropriate linguistic response - such things as returning 
a greeting correctly, answering a question satisfactorily, or filling in a form. 
None of these are translation-like processes, but they do show that the 
comprehension and interpretation stage of translation involves a perfectly 
ordinary, everyday activity that simply requires a standard command of the 
language used. 
1.2 INTER-SEMIOTIC TRANSLATION 
One everyday activity that does resemble translation proper is what Roman 
Jakobson calls inter-semiotic translation (Jakobson 1971: 260-6), that is, 
translation between two semiotic systems (a semiotic system being a system 
for communication). 'The green light means go' is an act of inter-semiotic 
translation, as is 'The big hand's pointing to twelve and the little hand's 

8 
Thinking Arabic translation 
pointing to four, so it's four o'clock'. In each case, there is translation from a 
non-linguistic communication system (traffic lights, clock-face) to a linguistic 
one. To this extent, everyone is a translator of a sort. 
1.3 INTRALINGUAL TRANSLATION 
Still more common are various sorts of linguistic response to linguistic stimuli 
which are also very like translation proper, even though they actually take 
place within a single language. These sorts of process are what Jakobson 
(ibid.) calls intralingual translation. 
We will consider the two extremes of intralingual translation, to see what 
its major implications are. Take the following scenario. Jill is driving Jack 
through the narrow streets of a small town. A policeman steps out and stops 
them. As he leans to speak to Jill, she can see over his shoulder that, further 
on, a lorry has jackknifed and blocked the street At one extreme of intralingual 
translation lies the kind of response typified in this exchange: 
POLICEMAN 
nLL 
JACK 
TILL 
There's been an accident ahead, Madam - I'm afraid you'll 
have to turn left down St Mary's Lane here, the road's blocked. 
Oh, OK. Thanks. 
What did he say? 
We've got to tum left. 
The policeman's essential message is 'Tum left'. But he has been trained 
in public relations and he does not want to sound brusque. So he starts by 
mollifying the driver with a partial explanation, 'There's been an accident', 
and then presents his instruction somewhat apologetically, by introducing it 
with 'I'm afraid'. 'St Mary's Lane' even implies a shared sense of local 
solidarity with the motorist; but the policeman also adds 'here', in case Jill 
does not in fact know the town. Finally, he completes his explanation. 
When Jack asks what the policeman has said, however, Jill separates the 
gist of the policeman's message from all the circumstantial details and the 
tonal subtleties, and reports it in her own words. This is an example of a type 
of intralingual translation which we shall call gist translation The example 
also shows two other features which intralingual translation shares with 
translation proper. First, Jill's is not the only gist translation possible. For 
instance, she might have said, 'We've got to go down here'. Amongst other 
things, this implies that at least one of the people in the car does not know 
the town: the street name would be of no help in identifying which road is 
meant. A third possibility is, 'We've got to go down St Mary's Lane'; if Jack 
and Jill do know the town, the gist of the policeman's message is accurately 
conveyed. 
The other feature shared by intralingual translation and translation proper 
is that the situation in which a message is expressed crucially affects both 

Preliminaries to translation as a process 
9 
how it is expressed and how it is received. By 'situation' here we mean a 
combination of three elements: 
1. Linguistic context 
(for 
example, the policeman's words and Jack's 
question). 
2. Non-linguistic circumstances (such as being stopped in a car and having to 
take a diversion). 
3. The experiential baggage of the participants (knowing or not knowing the 
town; familiarity or unfamiliarity with conventions for giving and receiving 
instructions; liking or disliking the police, etc. ). 
There are so many variables in the message situation that it is impossible 
to predict what the gist translation will be or how the addressee will take it. 
For example, Jill might simply have said, 'Tum left', a highly economical 
way of reporting L'te gist - no bad thing when she is concentrating on driving. 
However, depending on how she says it, and how Jack receives it, it could 
give the impression that the policeman was rude. 
Another reason why 'Tum left' could sound rude is that, grammatically, it 
looks like direct speech - an imperative - whereas al Jill's other gist translations 
are clearly indirect speech (or 'reported speech'). All translation might be 
regarded as a form of indirect speech, inasmuch as it does not repeat the ST, 
but reformulates it. Yet most TIs, like 'Tum left', mask the fact that they are 
indirect speech by omitting such markers as 'The author says that .. .' or 
modulation of point of view (as in substituting 'we' for 'you', or 'he' for '!'). 
As a result, it is very easy for reformulation consciously or unconsciously to 
become distortion, either because the translator misrepresents the ST or because 
the reader misreads the TI, or both. 
Gist translation, like any translation, is thus a process of interpretation. 
This is seen still more clearly if we take an example at the opposite extreme 
of intralingual translation. Jill might easily have interpreted the policeman's 
words by expanding them. For example, she could build on an initial gist 
translation as follows: 
We've got to go down St Mary's Lane -
some fool's jackknifed and 
blocked the High Street. 
Here, she puts two sorts of gloss on the policeman's message: she adds 
details that he did not give (the jackknifing, the name of the street) and her 
own judgement of the driver. We shall use the term exegetic translation to 
denote a translation that explains and elaborates on the ST in this way. The 
inevitable part played by the translator's experiential baggage becomes obvious 
in exegetic translation, for any exegesis by definition involves explicitly 
invoking considerations from outside the text in one's reading of it - here, 
the jackknifed lorry, Jill's knowledge of the town, and her attitude to other 

10 
Thinking Arabic translation 
road-users. 
An exegetic translation can be shorter than the ST, as in this example, but 
exegesis is usually longer, and can easily shade into general observations 
triggered by the ST but not really explaining it. Knowing the town as she 
does, Jill might easily have gone on like this: 
That's the second time in a month. The street's just too narrow for a thing 
that size. 
The explanation added in the second sentence is still just about admissible as 
exegetic translation, but it does go much farther than the policeman's statement 
As the above examples suggest, it is sometimes hard to keep gist translation 
and exegetic translation apart, or to se where translation shades into comment 
pure and simple. It certainly seems very hard to achieve an ideal rephrasing, 
a halfway point between gist and exegesis that would use terms radically 
different from those of the ST, but add nothing to, and omit nothing from, its 
message content. Might one say that 'I consumed a small quantity of alcohol 
approximately 60 minutes ago' is a rephrasing of 'I had a little drink about 
an hour ago'? If it is, it is distinctly inexact: the tone and connotations of the 
two utterances are very different, and 'a small quantity of alcohol' and 'a 
little drink' can hardly be said to have the same denotative meaning. 
1.4 INTERLINGUAL TRANSLATION 
Just as it is possible to have intralingual gist and exegetic translation, so it is 
possible to have interlingual translation (i.e. translation proper) which involves 
gist or exegesis. In Arabic>English translation, translations which involve 
gisting are most likely to arise where the Arabic ST involves a high degree of 
repetition of 
meaning (Le. semantic repetition). Consider the following 
example (Johnstone 1991: 89-90): 
M^ 1 -=.UlS .# I.,... t-".)*1,J # I+ 1 ,.reLtl ->-=,,J ୸ + 1

A fairly literal translation of this reads as follows (Johnstone 1991: 90): 
Poetry is an expression and description of the feelings of poets and their 
thoughts, whether the experience be real or from the fabric of the poet's 
imagination. And in both cases, the experience is true, because even if the 
experience is not real - that is, imaginary - the poet lives in it for a long 

Preliminaries to translation as a process 
1 1  
time before he composes his poetry, sensing it in the pulses of his heart 
and feeling it flow in his blood. (75 words) 
A rather more idiomatic translation might read: 
Poetry is an expression of the thoughts and feelings of the poet. Whether 
the experience be real or imaginary, it is true in the sense that the poet has 
spent a great deal of time experiencing it internally before composing his 
poetry. (42 words) 
Good examples of exegetic translation in various degrees can be found in 
different English interpretations of the Quran. Consider for example the 
following three translations of ෍ƿ 11 .. J.}-'o" by Rodwell (1909), Al-Hilali 
and Khan (1997), and Turner (1997) (the translations are presented with 
corresponding verse numbering to the original; the translation of AI-Hilali 
and Khan has been slightly amended, to omit information which is irrelevant 
to the current discussion): 
Rodwell 
In the name of God. the Compassionate, the Merciful 
1. SAY: He is God alone: 
2. God the eternal! 
3. He begetteth not, and He is not begotten 
4. And there is none like unto Him. 
AI-HilaIi and Khan 
In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful 
1. Say, 0 Muhammad: He is Allah, (the) One. 
2. Allah As-Samad (the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need. 
He neither eats nor drinks). 
3. He begets not, nor was He begotten, 
4. And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him. 

12 
Thinking Arabic translation 
Turner 
In the Name 0/ God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. 
1. Say: 'My God is One; 
2. The cosmos is a manifestation of His eternal names, for He is mirrored 
in all things in a most subtle manner, and He is free from all wants and 
needs. 
3. He does not beget or produce anything, nor is he begotten or produced 
by anything 
4. And there is nothing in the whole of the cosmos that can be likened to 
Him.' 
Rodwell's translation here can be regarded as having no exegetical elements. 
Al-Hilali and Khan include an exegetical gloss '0 Muhammad', and another 
gloss on As-Samad (which they transliterate rather than translating), and they 
translate Iȭ as 'co-equal or comparable', which is arguably an exegetical 
expansion. Turner's is the most obviously exegetical version, and he refers to 
his interpretation as an "'exegetically-led" reading' (Turner 1997: xvi). 
In general, while translation proper may include elements of gist or exegesis, 
the dominant mode of translation is one which involves rephrasing between 
the ST and TI.

broaches the subject (Lynn and Jay 1990: 135).

Today I attempted to explain the new system to Sir Humphrey, who 
effectively refused to listen. 
Instead, he interrupted as I began, and told me that he had something 
to say to me that I might not like to hear. He said it as if this were 
something new! 
As it happens, I'd left my dictaphone running, and his remarks were 
recorded for posterity. What he actually said to me was: 'Minister, the 
traditional allocation of executive responsibilities has always been so 
determined as to liberate the Ministerial incumbent from the administrative 
minutiae by devolving the managerial functions to those whose experience 
and qualifications have better formed them for the performance of such 
humble offices, thereby releasing their political overlords for the more 
onerous duties and profound deliberations that are the inevitable 
concomitant of their exalted position.' 
I couldn't possibly imagine why he thought I wouldn't want to hear 
that. 
Presumably, he thought it would upset me - but how can you be upset 
by something you don't understand a word of? 
Yet again, I asked him to express himself in plain English. This request 
always surprises him, as he is always under the extraordinary impression 
that he has already done so.

Prelirrinaries to 
translation as a product 
2.1 DEGREES OF FREEDOM IN TRANS LA TION 
As we saw in Chapter 1, translation can be viewed as a process. However, in 
each of the examples where the driver 'translated' the policeman's words, 
the evidence we had for the process was a product - a gist translation and an 
exegetic translation. Here, too, it is useful to examine two diametric opposites: 
in this case, two opposed degrees of freedom of translation, showing extreme 
SL bias on the one hand and extreme TL bias on the other. 
2.1.1 Interlinear translation 
At the extreme of SL bias is interlinear translation, where the IT does not 
necessarily respect 1L grammar, but has grammatical units corresponding as 
closely as possible to every grammatical unit of the ST. Here is an example 
of an interlinear translation of an Arabic proverb (found, with some variants, 
in a number of Arabic dialects): 
..:..L. ..:..u y-LJ! 
ThelWhat passed died 
The following is an interlinear translation of the first line of one of the 
pre-Islamic w..... poems, ඤ w...... In this translation - indicates that the 
two English words so linked correspond jointly to one Arabic word in the 
ST; - indicates that the two English words so linked correspond to two linked 
Arabic forms or words in the ST, and /I indicates a hemistich (half-line) 
break in the middle of the line. This is a standard feature of traditional 
Arabic poetry, and is marked in the ST by a space between the words 

16 
Thinking Arabic translation 
ڻڼ and ں which is longer than the spaces between other words in 
the line. 
' 
ڽI , , 
i . • I 
Disappeared the-cam ping-grounds alighting-places-their and-stopping 
-places-their /I in-Mina become-deserted Ghaul-its and-Rijam-its 
As is apparent from the incomprehensibility of the English IT here, interlinear 
translation is normally only employed where the purpose of the translation is 
to shed light on the structure of the ST. Mainly used in descriptive linguistics 
or language teaching, interlinear translation is of no practical use for this 
course, and we shall not consider it further. 
2.1.2 Literal translation 
Interlinear translation is actually an extreme form of the much more common 
literal translation. In literal translation proper, the denotative meaning of 
words is taken as if straight from the dictionary (that is, out of context), but 
TL grammar is respected. Because TL grammar is respected, literal translation 
very often unavoidably involves grammatical transposition - the replacement 
or reinforcement of given parts of speech in the ST by other parts of speech 
in the IT. A simple example is translating the colloquially-oriented 4..u I 
Ò as 'It's sunny': the IT has a 'dummy-subject' 'it' where the ST has 
the word Ó.J I ('the world'), and an adjective 'sunny', where the ST has the 
noun Ô ('sun '). 
The following is the first line of Õ Uh..o, with a literal translation: 
I 
• 
'0 ୭ 
'. I :1° 
'. ඞG 
'. 
.........
. ග ...... ඟ
.
 ච 
, 
, ..

..
 
೼I i . • I Q "  • Jl:!.J I ඝ 
The camping grounds have disappeared - their alighting places and their 
stopping places /I at Mina; its Ghaul and its Rijam have become deserted 
In this translation, the standard grammar and word order of English are 
respected; however, everything which might be transferred on a simple word­
by-word basis from the Arabic is so transferred. For most purposes, literal 
translation can be regarded as the practical extreme of SL bias. 
2.1.3 Free translation 
At the opposite extreme, where there is maximum TL bias, is free translation. 
Here there is only a global correspondence between the textual units of the 

Preliminaries to translation as a product 
17 
ST and those of the IT. A possible free translation of the colloquial Arabic 
proverb ..:;.L.. ..:;.U Ĥ!, discussed above, would be 'Let bygones be bygones'. 
Here the grammar is completely different and the metaphor of 'dying' is 
lost. Similarly, a free translation of the proverb ඙ r -H,J .il r -H might be 
'You win some, you lose some'; here the grammar and vocabulary are 
completely different. 
2.1.4 Communicative translation 
These examples of free translation are also examples of communicative 
translation. A communicative translation is produced, when, in a given 
situation, the ST uses an SL expression standard for that situation, and the 
IT uses a TL expression standard for an equivalent target culture situation. 
'Let bygones be bygones' is an obvious translation of ..:;.L.. ..:;.U Ĥ!, and, in 
some situations at least, would be virtually mandatory. This is true of very 
many culturally conventional formulae that do not invite literal translation. 
Public notices, proverbs, and conversational cliches illustrate this point: 
No smoldng 
(public notice) 
.u. IJ ս ୩.)୪""୫ To kill two birds with one stone (Standard Arabic proverb) 
Don't mention it 
(conversational dieM) 
As these few examples suggest, communicative translation is very common. 
Communicative translation apart, however, this degree of freedom is no more 
useful as standard practice than interlinear translation, because potentially 
important details of message content are bound to be lost 
2.1.5 From interlinear to free translation 
Between the two extremes of literal translation and free translation, the degrees 
of freedom are infinitely variable. Whether there is any perfect halfway point 
between the two is open to question. However, in assessing translation freedom, 
it is useful to situate the IT on a scale between extreme SL bias and extreme 
TL bias, with notional intermediate points schematized as in the following 
diagram, adapted from Newmark (1981: 39): 
• 
Literal 
SL bias ... 
.--------------tl.୬ TL bias 
• 
Faithful 
• 
Balanced 
(SLfTL) 
• 
Idiomizing 
• 
Free 

1 8  
Thinking Arabic translation 
By an idiomizing translation, we mean one that respects the ST message 
content, but prioritizes TL 'naturalness' over faithfulness to ST detail; it will 
typically use idioms or familiar phonic and rhythmic patterns to give an easy 
read, even if this means sacrificing nuances of meaning or tone. By 'idiom' 
we mean a fixed figurative expression whose meaning cannot be deduced 
from the denotative meanings of the words that make it up, as in 'football's 
not my cup of tea' , 'that's a diferent kettle offish', etc. Note that 'idiomizing' 
is not synonymous with 'idiomatic': throughout this course we use the term 
'idiomatic' to denote what sounds 'natural' and 'normal' to native speakers ­
a linguistic expresion that is unexceptional and acceptable in a given language 
in a given context. 
The five points on the scale - as well as the rarely used interlinear translation 
- can be illustrated by the following translations of the phrase .l.A ඘ 
uYI ġ JL+A! Ģ .l..:.!.'J1. 
[INTERLINEAR Like these things to them demand much now.] 
LITERAL 
The likes of these things have much demand now.

BALANCED 
IDIOMIZING 
FREE 
Things like these are in great demand now. 
This kind of thing's in great demand at the moment. 
This type's all the rage. 
This one's dead trendy. 
Note that the last four TIs are all idiomatic, but only one of them is an 
idiomizing translation. It should also be noted that quite frequently, as 
translations get more free, they become more informal, as illustrated by these 
examples. There is, however, no necessary correlation between informality 
and freeness of translation. The pompous 'Such artifacts are at the absolute 
pinnacle of their popUlarity, madam' is just as possible a free translation of 
uYI ġ JL+A! Ģ .l..:.!.'J1 • .lA Ģ as is 'This one's dead trendy'. 
2.2 EQUIVALENCE AND TRANSLATION LOSS 
In defining communicative translation, we used the term 'equivalent target 
culture situation'. As a matter of fact, most writers on translation use the 
terms 'equivalence' and 'equivalent' , but in so many different ways that 
equivalence can be a confusing concept even for teachers of translation, let 
alone their students. Before going further, then, we need to say what we 
mean, and what we do not mean, by 'equivalence' and 'equivalent'. Since 
this is not a course in translation theory, we shall not go in detail into the 
more general philosophical implications of the term 'equivalence'. Nida (1964), 
Toury (1980), Holmes (1988) and Snell-Hornby (1988) between them provide 
a useful introduction to the question.

2.2.1 Equivalence 
The many different definitions of equivalence in translation fall broadly into 
one of two categories: they are either descriptive or prescriptive. Descriptively, 
'equivalence' denotes the relationship between ST features and IT features 
that are seen as directly corresponding to one another, regardless of the 
quality of the IT. Thus, descriptively, the following utterances are equivalents: 
forbidden is the entrance 
with the well-being 
Prescriptively, 'equivalence' denotes the relationship between an SL 
expression and the canonic TL rendering of it as required, for example, by a 
teacher. So, prescriptively, the following pairs of utterances are equivalents: 
no entry 
goodbye 
An influential variant of prescnptive equivalence is the 'dynamic 
equivalence' of the eminent Bible translator Eugene Nida. This is based on 
the 'principle of equivalent effect' , which states that 'the relationship between 
receptor and message should be substantially the same as that which existed 
between the original receptors and the message' (Nida 1964: 159). Nida's 
view does have real attractions. We shall be suggesting throughout the course 
that there are all sorts of reasons -
reasons of grammar, idiom, context, 
genre, etc. - why a translator might not want to translate a given expression 
literally. A case in point is communicative translation, which may be said to 
be an example of 'dynamic equivalence' (cf. Nida 1964: 166: 'That is just 
the way we would say it'). However, there is a danger, especially for student 
translators with exceptional mother-tongue facility, that 'dynamic equivalence' 
might be seen as giving carte blanche for excessive freedom - that is, freedom 
to write more or less anything as long as it sounds good and does reflect, 
however tenuously, something of the ST message content. This danger is a 
very real one, as any teacher of translation will confirm. It is in fact a 
symptom of theoretical problems contained in the very notion of 'equivalent 
effect', most notably the normative ones. 
To begin with, who is to know what the relationship between ST message 
and source-culture receptors is? For that matter, is it plausible to speak of the 
relationship, as if there were only one: are there not as many relationships as 
there are receptors? And who is to know what such relationships can have 
been in the past? In any case, few texts have a single effect, even in one 
reading by one person. 
A good example of the problematicity of achieving an equivalent effect in 

20 
Thinking Arabic translation 
Arabic>English translation is the translation of a piece of ancient Arabic 
poetry, such as ඗ Uia.... Even in principle, it seems impossible to achieve 
in an English translation the effect created by ` 4 i'· . on the original 
audience of the poem, i.e. the Arabs of pre-Islamic Arabia. In fact, it seems 
impossible even to detennine what these effects might have been. Equally, it 
seems almost certain that the effects achieved on a modem Arabic audience 
will be quite different from those achieved on the original audience. The 
differences between the two audiences are obviously enonnous - pre-Islamic 
pagan Bedouins vs mainly Muslim town-dwellers and villagers; a largely 
illiterate audience listening to an essentially oral perfonnance in a poetic 
genre with which it is likely to be intimately acquainted, vs an exclusively 
literate audience, which is likely to be making use of a heavily annotated 
edition in a school or university, and which is used to a modem version of 
Standard Arabic (even in the poetic domain) significantly different from the 
Arabic of pre-Islamic poetry. 
Al this illustrates the dangers in the nonnative use of the tenn 'equivalence' 
to imply 'sameness' ,  as it does in logic, mathematics and sign-theory. In 
mathematics, an equivalent relationship is objective, incontrovertible and, 
crucially, reversible. In translation, however, such unanimity and such 
reversibility are unthinkable for any but the very simplest of texts - and even 
then, only in tenns of denotative meaning. For example, if ,., -, .. ? c 1 J.A 
ll ..)  ,0 • translates as 'Do you like Egypt?', will back-translation (that is, 
translating a IT back into the SL) automatically give Cj  '·'i .. ? c 1 JA ,  or 
will it give Cj ୥ " ' .. ? • -, JA, or Cj ..r-o ඖ JA? The answer depends, as 
it always does in translation matters, on context - both the context of the ST 
utterance and that of the IT utterance. The simplest of contexts is usually 
enough to inhibit the reversibility that is crucial to equivalence in the 
mathematical sense. And certainly even something as elementary as the 
difference in tense gives II ୦ " 'i  .. ? cl JA and II ୧ " ' .. ? • -, JA 
potentially quite distinct interpretations. 
It would seem that, in so far as the principle of equivalent effect implies 
'sameness' or is used nonnatively, it is more of a hindrance than a help, both 
theoretically and pedagogically. Consequently, when we spoke of an 
'equivalent target culture situation', we were not intending 'equivalent' to 
have a sense specific to any particular translation theory, but were using it in 
its everyday sense of 'counterpart' - something different, but with points of 
resemblance in relevant aspects. This is how the term will be used in this 
book. 
We have found it useful, both in translating and in teaching translation, to 
avoid an absolutist ambition to maximize sameness between ST and TI, in 
favour of a relativist ambition to minimize diference: to look not for what is 
to be put into the TI, but for what one might save from the ST. There is a 
vital difference between the two ambitions. The aim of maximizing sameness 
encourages the belief that, floating somewhere out in the ether, there is the 

Preliminaries to translation as a product 
21 
'right' translation, the IT that is 'equi-valent' to the ST, at some ideal point 
between SL bias and TL bias. B ut it is more realistic, and more productive, 
to start by admitting that, because SL and TL are fundamentally different, the 
transfer from ST to IT inevitably entails difference - that is, loss. 
2.2.2 Translation loss 
It is helpful here to draw an analogy with 'energy loss' in engineering. The 
transfer of energy in any machine necessarily involves energy loss. Engineers 
do not see this as a theoretical anomaly, but simply as a practical problem 
which they confront by striving to design more efficient machines, in which 
energy loss is reduced. We shall give the term translation loss to the incomplete 
replication of the ST in the IT - that is, the inevitable loss of textually and 
culturally relevant features. This term is intended to suggest that translators 
should not agonize over the loss, but should concentrate on reducing it. 
In fact, the analogy with energy loss is imperfect: whereas energy loss is a 
loss (or rather, a diversion) of energy, translation loss is not a loss of translation, 
but a loss in the translation process. It is a loss of textual effects. Further, 
since these effects cannot be quantified, neither can the loss. So, when trying 
to reduce it, the translator never knows how far there is still to go. 
Nevertheless, despite the limitations of the analogy, we have found it 
practical for translators, students and teachers alike. Once one accepts the 
concept of inevitable translation loss, a IT that is not, even in al important 
respects, a replica of the ST is not a theoretical anomaly, and the translator 
can concentrate on the realistic aim of reducing translation loss, rather than 
the unrealistic one of seeking the ultimate IT. 
A few very simple examples, at the level of sounds and denotative meanings 
of individual words, will be enough to show some of the forms translation 
loss can take and what its implications are for the translator. 
There is translation loss even at the most elementary level. True SL-TL 
homonymy rarely occurs (since there is almost always some difference in 
pronunciation across languages), and rhythm and intonation are usually 
different as well. For instance, in most contexts iඔ and 'cow' will be 
synonyms, and there will be no loss in denotative meaning in translating one 
with the other. But iඕ and 'cow' clearly sound different: there is significant 
translation loss on the phonic and prosodic levels. In a veterinary textbook, 
this loss is not likely to matter. But if the ST word is part of an alliterative 
pattern in a literary text, or, worse, if it rhymes, the loss could be crucial. 
Even if the ST word has entered the TL as a loan-word (e.g. 'intifada'), 
using it in the IT entails translation loss in at least two different ways. For 
example, English-speakers pronounce 'intifada' differently from the way in 
which Arabic speakers pronounce ୤I A i ',j (consider, for example, the 
pronunciation of the vO in Arabic); so using it in an English IT involves loss 

22 
Thinking Arabic translation 
on the phonic level. In any case, 'intifada' still sounds foreign (cL Ch. 3.5) in 
English, despite the relative frequency of use in newspapers and political 
writing over the past few years. Accordingly, using 'intifada' in an English 
IT introduces a foreign element which is not present in an Arabic ST, 
thereby losing the cultural neutrality of the ST expression. 
In the opposite sort of case, where the ST contains a TL expression (e.g . 
.;:J,J .: .' a < 'computer', ƻ..,... 'mobile phone'), it is tempting to see the IT 
as 'correcting' the ST, and therefore producing 'gain' rather than 'loss'. In 
fact, however, there is no less loss. If Arabic A@..,... is translated as 'mobile 
phone' (as it might well be in many contexts), there is palpable phonic and 
prosodic loss, because the ST expression and the IT expression are pronounced 
in ways which are clearly different from one other. There is also grammatical 
translation loss, because the IT is less economical than the ST, and there is 
lexical translation loss, because IT 'mobile phone' loses the foreignness that 
ƻ"... has in Arabic. And a translation of Arabic ĝ,J .: .' 
a < as English 
'computer' involves not only a loss of foreignness but also an addition of a 
transparent link with 'compute' which is lacking in the SL form. 
As these examples suggest, it is important to recognize that, even where 
the IT is more explicit, precise, economical or vivid than the ST, this difference 
is still a case of translation loss. Some writers refer to such differences as 
'translation gains'. It is certainly true that the following ITs, for example, 
can be said to be grammatically more economical, sometimes even more 
elegant and easier to say, than their STs. But these so-called 'gains' are by 
the same token grammatical, phonic or prosodic failures to replicate the ST 
structures, and are therefore by definition instances of translation loss, as in 
the following examples: 
ST 
cross-eyed 
Islamic jurisprudence 
b..>-"!-l b..)1 
Ğ ğ  
IT 
J-p-l 
4.li 
taxi 
shark 
Conversely, if we reverse these columns, we have a set of ITs that are 
clearer, or more vivid than their STs: these ITs, too, all show translation 
loss, because the ST structures have been violated:

J-p-l

b..>-"!-l b..)1 
Ğ ğ

23 
If translation loss is inevitable even in translating single words, it is obviously 
going to feature at more complex levels as well - in respect of connotations, 
for example, or of sentence structure, discourse, language variety, and so on. 
Examples will arise in Practicals 2.1 and 2.2, and many more later on, chapter 
by chapter, as we deal with these and other topics. 
2.2.2.1 Translation by omission 
The most obvious form of translation loss is when something which occurs 
in the ST is simply omitted from the TI. Such omission occurs fairly frequently 
in Arabic/English translation, and is therefore worth specifically identifying. 
(For helpful further discussion of translation by omission, see Baker 1992: 
40-2.) 
Omission can occur for many legitimate reasons; the following are a few 
illustrative examples. Quite often, omission reflects the different ways in 
which Arabic and English link bits of text together (Le. different patterns of 
cohesion; cf. ChI 10.2.1). Arabic radio broadcasts, for example, often make 
use of the phrase .. . ,J IlA to introduce a piece of information which is related 
to the material which has gone before, but takes the broadcast onto a new 
sub-topic. Normally, the best translation of this in English is to simply miss 
the phrase out. Similarly, one often finds the phrase ۉl.1~ ୢୣ (also 
associated 'variants' such as ඏ¬,j Jඃ L-,J) at the start of paragraphs in 
Arabic newspapers; this can be regarded as a signal in Arabic that what 
comes next is background information to the main argument (cf. Hatim 
1997: 67-74). Again, one would normally not expect this to be translated in 
an English TI. 
Another occasion for omission is when the information conveyed is not 
particularly important, and adding it would unnecessarily complicate the 
structure of the TI. Consider, for example, the following extract from an 
Arabic newspaper J,Ji YL...... ෦i ..u 0ڱ ڲ ڳ..)-A y I Ü.;J I 0LS,J 
[ . . .  ] ෧i  . Given a context in which it is not particularly important that 
this statement was made in the evening, a reasonable translation of this 
would be along the lines 'Two days ago, the American President, Bill Clinton, 
confirmed [ ... ]' (Ives 1999: 3); unlike Arabic, English does not afford a 
particularly elegant or stylistically normal way in this context of expressing 
the concept 'two days ago in the evening' . 
Cultural difference (cf. Chapter 3) provides another area in which simple 
omission may be a reasonable strategy. For example, when a Christian-oriented 
Lebanese newspaper refers to the former Phalangist leader as J඄ ڰ I 
J of 
0 '!, the obvious translation is 'Pierre Gemayel' (Jones 1999: 5); not 
enough hangs on the associations of respect in t of 
', I I  here to warrant 
including any equivalent in the TI. Similarly, in most contexts, the phrase 
}W I u-J.J-:' ڴ 0ڵW I @@ is likely to be most reasonably translated 

24 
Thinking Arabic translation 
as 'Pope John-Paul II' with the omission of any English equivalent of the ST 
u඀W I; most Western readers are likely to be unaware of any popes (such 
as the Coptic pope) other than the Catholic one, and even if they are aware of 
these other possibilities, such knowledge will in many contexts be irrelevant, 
since it is only the Catholic pope in English who is typically referred to as 
'the Pope'. 
2.2.2.2 Translation by addition 
Translation by addition is translation in which something is added to the IT 
which is not present in the ST. Like omission, addition is a fairly common 
feature of Arabic/English translation and is therefore worth specifically 
identifying. 
Examples of translation by addition frequently occur where either general 
considerations of English usage or specific contexts require something to be 
added. Consider the phrase from a newspaper text about the Kosovo war of 
1999 ȓ..r=J 1 4 " 0  .: f I I  ,U... This is much more acceptably translated as 
'ever since the days of Turkish hegemony' (Ives 1999: 13) than as 'ever 
since Turkish hegemony' ('time of Turkish hegemony' would also be possible). 
The operative principle here seems to be that English resists regarding 
'hegemony' as a concept involving time more strongly than does Arabic with 
respect to 4 " 0 .: II. In English it is therefore necessary to add 'days of (or 
something similar). 
A similar example, which involves the specific context, rather than general 
considerations of usage, is the following from the novel Ȕ 1 ň"l...o by

This has been translated (Brown 1996: 58) as: 
He was holding his breath and had closed his eyes to what was going on 
around him 
The context here is fairly personal; the author is interested in the events 
immediately surrounding the central character of the novel, ,.HL...w:.. The 
translator has accordingly chosen to add 'around him' , since this is an obvious 
idiomatic means of expressing the personal nature of what is involved. There 
is, however, no equivalent of 'around him' (e.g. 4..i.r-"-) in the Arabic ST 
(although it would be perfectly possible to have one); nor is any dictionary 
likely to list 'to go on around [one]' as an equivalent of I.Sջ Accordingly, it 
is justifiable to identify this as a case of translation by addition.

2.2.2.3 Controlling translation loss 
As we have suggested, translation loss is an inevitable consequence of the 
fact that languages and cultures are different. Given this, the challenge to the 
translator is not to eliminate it, but to control and channel it by deciding 
which features, in a given ST, it is most important to respect, and which can 
most legitimately be sacrificed in respecting them. The translator has always 
to be asking, and answering, such questions as: does it matter if 'Do you like 
Egypt?' does not reflect the distinction between ƺ ո " I  i .. ? c i J,.A and J,.A 
'i չ " I  .. ? • .:.? Does it matter if J.t@..,... is foreign in Arabic, but 'mobile 
phone' is not foreign in English, and sounds different in each case? If u-LJ! 
-=.,l..o -=.,U is phonically, rhythmically, grammatically, lexically and metapnor­
ically different from 'Let bygones be bygones'? As we have already suggested, 
there is no once-and-for-all answer to questions like these. Everything depends 
on the purpose of the translation and on what the role of the textual feature is 
in its context. Sometimes a given translation loss will matter a lot, sometimes 
little. Whether the final decision is simple or complicated, it does have to be 
made, every time, and the translator is the only one who can make it.

Literal IT 
The rule of the Conservatives was distinguished by its clearer and more 
principled striving for the values of Western capitalism and by their 
adoption of a gradual, total programme in order to separate the state and 
the society; and the start of the project of gradual relinquishing of/by the 
state of/from the task of social care and the clearing of the way in front of 
the movement of investment and capital by means of the reduction of 
taxes. And Thatcher set off from an unyielding philosophical-ideological 
conception with which she fought the unions and broke their power; then 
she transferred the public properties of the state in the great companies 
and converted them to the private sector, and opened the door in front of 
the citizens to buy their shares; and the policy of privatization covered 
more than twenty large companies, including the iron-steel company, the 
gas company, the electricity, the telephone, the oil, and the airports. She 
also gave the renters of government houses the right to buy and own their 
houses, and [she undertook] other measures in which she forced the state 
to give up its properties to the benefit of the citizens. And/So the result 
was that Britain in the eighties witnessed an economic movement and a 
relative revival, and the inpouring of foreign capital, and the conviction 
of the British voter came into being of the tangible, direct benefits of the 
rule of the Conservatives.

Cultural transposition 
3.1 BASIC PRINCIPLES 
In this chapter, we complete our introduction to the notion of translation loss 
by looking at some implications of the fact that translating involves not just 
two languages, but a transfer from one culture to another. General cultural 
differences are sometimes bigger obstacles to successful translation than 
linguistic differences. 
We shall use the term cultural transposition for the main types and 
degrees of departure from literal translation that one may resort to in the 
process of transferring the contents of an ST from one culture to another. 
Any degree of cultural transposition involves the choice of features indigenous 
to the TL and the target culture in preference to features with their roots in 
the source culture. The result is to reduce foreign (that is SL-specific) features 
in the TT, thereby to some extent naturalizing it into the TL and its cultural 
setting. 
The various degrees of cultural transposition can be visualized as points 
along a scale between the extremes of exoticism and cultural transplantation.

The extreme options in signalling cultural foreignness in a TT fall into the 
category of exoticism A TT marked by exoticism is one which constantly 
uses grammatical and cultural features imported from the ST with minimal 
adaptation, and which thereby constantly signals the exotic source culture

Thinking Arabic translation 
and its cultural strangeness. This may indeed be one of the IT's chief attractions, 
as with some translations of classical Arabic literature that deliberately trade 
on exoticism. A IT like this, however, has an impact on the TL public which 
the ST could never have had on the SL public, for whom the text has no 
features of an alien culture. 
A sample of exoticism in translation from Arabic would be a more or less 
literal translation of the following simple conversation (we have given versions 
of the conversation in both Standard Arabic, as it might appear in a short 
story or novel, and the contextually more natural colloquial Arabic):

Sometimes the nature of the ST makes it virtually impossible to avoid exoticism 
in the IT. Consider the following from the Classical Arabic text .ൕ I by 
.L:..:..I (from Lane 1 994: 48, 56-7) in which formal features of the ST are 
extremely important, but are not easily matched by typical formal features of 
English:

It is not consistent with the principles of etiquette, the hierarchy of authority, 
the customs of leaders, and the good rule of princes that the follower and 
the followed, the ruler and the ruled become equals with respect to precious 
food and marvelous drinks, valuable clothes and noble horses, and the 
finest and best kinds of things. 

Cultural transposition 
31 
3.3 CALQUE 
Sometimes, even where the IT as a whole is not marked by exoticism, a 
momentary foreignness is introduced. A calque is an expression that consists 
of 1L words and respects 1L syntax, but is unidiomatic in the 1L because it 
is modelled on the structure of an SL expression. This lack of idiomaticity 
may be purely lexical and relatively innocuous, or it may be more generally 
grammatical. The following calques of Arabic proverbs illustrate decreasing 
degrees of idiomaticity: 
What is past has died 
A day for you, a day against you 
It increased the clay moistness 
For most translation purposes, it can be said that a bad calque (like the third 
example) imitates ST features to the point of being ungrammatical in the TL, 
while a good one (like the first example) compromises between imitating ST 
features and offending against TL grammar. Any translator will confirm that 
it is easy, through ignorance, or - more usually - haste, to mar the IT with 
bad calques. However, it is conceivable that in some ITs the calque - and 
ensuing exoticism - may actually be necessary, even if its effects need to be 
palliated by some form of compensation. 
For example, if the strategy is to produce a IT marked by exoticism, the 
proverb ൔ r ÆJ dJ r..H may well be calqued as 'A day for you, a day 
against you'. But, because of the prevailing exoticism of the IT, it might not 
be clear that this is actually a proverb. This would be a significant translation 
loss if it were important that the reader should realize that the speaker is 
using a proverb. In that case, the loss could be reduced with an explanatory 
addition such as 'you know the saying': 'You know the saying: "A day for 
you, a day against you".' 
What was originally a calqued expression sometimes actually becomes a 
standard TL cultural equivalent of its SL equivalent. Perhaps the most obvious 
example of a calque from Arabic into current English is 'Mother of ... ' , from 
the Arabic .d.)L.....l1 ii used by Saddam Hussein to describe the 'battle' 
between Iraqi troops and those of the coalition organized to drive the invading 
Iraqi army from Kuwait. (In fact, this is often mis-calqued into English as 
'Mother of all ... ', rather than simply 'Mother of ... '.) 
Standardized calques from English into modern Arabic include bJÇ I 
• 
• 
9..J: 'recycling', ୎'" 'non-violence', I .)JJ ൓'play a role', among 
many others. 

32 
Thinking Arabic translation 
3.4 CULTURAL TRANSPLANTATION 
At the opposite end of the scale from exoticism is cultural transplantation, 
whose extreme forms are hardly translations at all, but more like adaptations 
- the wholesale transplanting of the entire setting of the ST, resulting in the 
entire text being rewritten in an indigenous target culture setting. 
An example of cultural transplantation is the remaking of the Japanese 
film 'The Seven Samurai' as the Hollywood film 'The Magnificent Seven'. 
An example involving Arabic would be the retelling of a Juha joke with the 
replacement of Juha and other typical Middle-Eastern characters with 
characters typical of the 1L culture. and corresponding changes in background 
setting. In a British context. one might. for example. begin the 'translation' 
of the joke 'A man walked into a pub'. 
It is not unusual to find examples of cultural transplantation on a small 
scale in translation. For example. in a scene from the short story ªU I J ,)L.:J I 
by the Syrian writer ..)-OG RSj. some rich adolescent girls are poking fun at 
a girl and boy from a poor part of town who are wandering around together, 
obviously in love. One of the rich girls calls out « ڨJ ک » ,  alluding to 
the story of the semi-legendary doomed love affair between the poet È 
, ,,. 
-
C:,.L1I 0-! (also known as o൒) and a woman called ڧ. This has been 
translated (St John 1999: 30) as 'Just like Romeo and Juliet'. 
By and large, normal translation practice avoids the two extremes of 
wholesale exoticism and wholesale cultural transplantation. In avoiding the 
two extremes, the translator will consider the alternatives lying between 
them on the scale given at the end of § 3.1 of this chapter. 
3.5 CULTURAL BORROWING 
The first alternative is to transfer an ST expression verbatim into the IT. 
This is termed cultural borrowing. It introduces a foreign element into the 
IT. Of course, something foreign is by definition exotic; this is why, when 
the occasion demands, it can be useful to talk about exotic elements introduced 
by various translation practices. But cultural borrowing is different from 
exoticism proper, as defined above: unlike exoticism, cultural borrowing 
does not involve adaptation of the SL expression into TL forms. 
An example of cultural borrowing would be the rendering of a culturally 
specific term by a transliteration, without further explanation. Thus, for 
example, U.,...... as used in Iraq, would be rendered by 'futa', rather than, 
say, by 'wrap' or 'robe' (a u.൑ in Iraq being a sarong-like garment which 
is worn by women). A cultural borrowing of this kind might well be signalled 
by the use of italics. 
Sometimes, the nature of the text may make the use of exoticism more or 
less unavoidable. Consider the following, from a fairly academic text about 

Cultural transposition 
33 
the Academy of Musical Studies in Iraq, which describes a concert given by 
the Academy (Evans 1994: \ '\0). 
y-:'S I bTU 1 ് Ĝ ('\) . . O..rL-A (\0) R liL:J1 G.Ĝ ൌ

This has been translated (Evans 1994: 15) as: 
The concert programme consisted of fifteen sections, six of which were in 
the Egyptian style as we know it from radio and television. These six 
parts comprised muwashshahat and solos influenced by the Egyptian School 
- from classical instruments such as the qanun, the ud and the nay. The 
structure of the music groups was also influenced by the Egyptian School, 
as they also contained large numbers of violins. 
Here the word uL..S: translates easily into English as 'violin' - since exactly 
the same instrument is used in both cultures. However, the other instruments 
are specific to the Middle East. A u୍L..:i is an i nstrument rather l ike a 
dulcimer, whose strings are plucked using metal plectrums attached to the 
fingers; an .lk is a short-necked lute, the strings of which are plucked with a 
plectrum; and a (SL.:. is a flute without a mouthpiece, made of bamboo or 
more rarely of wood, which, unlike the European flute, is held in a slanting 
forward position when blown (cf. Wehr). Translating u.,.:.u as 'dulcimer', or 
(St.:. as 'flute' would significantly distort what is meant by the Arabic; even 
translating .lկ as 'lute' (the word 'lute' is derived from the Arabic .l.,...J I) 
would disguise the fact that an .lk is recognizably different from a European 
lute. Similarly, translating ൏൐ as 'strophic poem' or the like, would here 
disguise the precise nature of the material being used, as well as the fact that 
what is being dealt with here is poetry set to music. Cultural borrowing on 
this scale i ntroduces so many exotic elements into the IT that it almost 
shades into exoticism proper. 
Where precise technical terms are important, one solution is for the translator 
to add a glossary at the end of the book, or to use footnotes or endnotes. 
Alternatively, where the translator decides that for some reason it is necessary 
to retain an SL term, but also to make it plain to the reader roughly what is 
meant, it is sometimes possible to insert an explanation, or partial explanation, 
into the IT alongside the cultural borrowing, normally as unobtrusively as 
possible. Using this technique, the above extract could have been translated 
along the following lines: 

34 
Thinking Arabic translation 
The concert programme consisted of fifteen sections, six of which were in 
the Egyptian style as we know it from radio and television. These six 
parts comprised pieces involving the muwashshah verse form and solos 
influenced by the Egyptian School - from classical instruments such as 
the plucked dulcimer (the qanun) and the Arab lute (the uti) and the nay 
flute. The structure of the music groups was also influenced by the Egyptian 
School, as they also contained large numbers of violins. 
This translation sounds somewhat strained, but elsewhere the combination of 
cultural borrowing plus additional explanatory material can be a useful 
technique. An example is the following (from Pennington 1999: 4), which 
deals with the response of American Muslims to the use of the crescent and 
star as a general symbol of Islam in American public places: 
« L.l-:' . ֥.>-"1 R 4 a 'Z' ',11" Jb I 01 േ െ il cd I" 
[ 
. . .  ] r)l...e I ...i.JL.:..:> 
A few of them objected, on the grounds that the American use of the 
Crescent and Star is bid'a ('innovation', which Islam opposes) [ ... ] 
Here, the English gloss 'innovation' on the Arabic word L-t: ୈ has been 
unobtrusively introduced into the IT. ([he translator has also included 'which 
Islam opposes' inside the brackets, in contrast with r͋& 1 ୉୊ in the 
ST, which is part of the main text.) 
Sometimes, a cultural borrowing becomes an established IT expression. 
Examples from Arabic into English are often religious in nature; e.g. 'imam', 
'Allah', 'sheikh'. A recent cultural borrowing is 'intifada' (cf. ChI 2.2. 1). 
Cultural borrowings shade into: (i) forms which were originally borrowed, 
but which are no longer regarded as foreign, e.g. 'algebra' (from ൊI), (ii) 
forms which have been borrowed, but have shifted meaning in the course of 
borrowing, e.g. 'algorithm' (ultimately from u-"jJ IfI, the man who 
invented them), and (iii) forms which have been borrowed, but have a sense 
in the TL which is not the normal sense in the SL, e.g. 'minaret' (from 
b)_", where the word for 'minaret' in most of the Arab world is ോ.L.:.....), 
'alcohol' (from ħ I, which means 'antimony' in Arabic). It is possible to 
include these latter types under cultural borrowings, although they might 
more reasonably be regarded as simple denotative equivalents (cf. Chapter 
5), inasmuch as the words are no longer popularly regarded as 'foreign' in 
nature. 

Cultural transposition 
35 
3.6 COMMUNICATIVE TRANSLATION 
As we have seen eCho 2. 1.4), communicative translation is normal in the case 
of culturally conventional formulae where literal translation would be 
inappropriate. 
Examples of stock phrases in Arabic and English are ീു I tƲ 'no 
smoking', J൅.u I tƲ 'no entry'. Problems may arise where the TL has 
no corresponding stock phrase to one used in the SL, e.g. because there is no 
cultural equivalent. Consider, in this regard, the use of religious formulae in 
everyday Arabic; til l  L.!. wI, til ൄI, til l  ¹JJ i)I.....J 1 ß 
cGେ..HJ- 'Equivalents' for these can be found in English, but they will often 
either seem unnatural or will involve considerable rephrasing. til I L.!. wI, 
for example, may often be most naturally rendered by 'I hope', a formula in 
English which clearly lacks the religious aspect of the original Arabic . 
• 
Similarly, take the phrase É, said to someone who has had their hair cut, 
and the reply { til I |f. Here ڤ might be translated as 'Your hair 
looks nice' (,Congratulations' in this context seems over-enthusiastic in 
English), to which the most natural reply would be something like, 'Thanks 
very much', or 'Oh, that's kind of you to sal so'. These are not, however, 
stock phrases in the same sense as the Arabic ി and { til I |i, and 
it would be wrong to over-use them in a IT. 
Regarding proverbial expressions, consider again ..:;:.L.. ..:;:.w ڥ!. Three 
possible translations of this might be: 
-
LITERAL 
BALANCED 
COMMUNICATIVE 
That which has passed has died 
What's past is gone 
Let bygones be bygoneslWhat's done is done 
In most contexts, one might expect 'Let bygones be bygones' to be the most 
reasonable translation. However, in a context in which the word 'past' figures 
prominently, it might be that the second translation would be appropriate, 
since it would echo the key word directly. Similarly, one might want to avoid 
the use of the proverb 'Let bygones be bygones' in a context where it could 
make the IT more cliched than the ST. 
3.7 TRANSLITERATING NAMES 
The issues involved in cultural transposition are well illustrated in the 
transliteration of names. In transliterating Arabic names, it is possible to 
follow either one of a number of more or less standard transliteration systems 
or to adopt a more ad hoc approach. A transliteration of the mountainous 
area of Yemen wlڦ using a transliteration system, for example, might be 
baCdtm. Here the symbol C transliterates the Arabic letter t, while the symbol 

36 
Thinking Arabic translation 
a transliterates the Arabic combination (. The advantage of a transliteration 
system is that it allows the reader to reconvert the English back into Arabic 
script. However, since this is something which is only normally required in 
an academic context, the use of transliteration systems is generally limited to 
academic translations. The use of a transliteration system in other cases may 
give a stronger sense of the exotic than is appropriate for the context. 
The use of a more ad hoc approach is illustrated by the transliteration of 
o lö as Ba'tJan or Badan. The advantage of this approach is that the 
transliterated form looks more like an English word; there are no obviously 
strange symbols involved - although the transliteration may contain elements 
which are not standard letters in English, an example in this case occurring in 
the first transliteration of ol÷, Ba'dan, which involves the use of the 
apostrophe. The disadvantage of the ad hoc approach is that the transliteration 
adopted may suggest a pronunciation of the word in English which is very 
far from the pronunciation of the Arabic original. The form Badan for example 
is supposed to render the Arabic ol ɶ in this case. However, the same 
English form could also correspond to Aാbic forms such as oڡ or oڢL. or 
olڣ etc. 
. 
. 
Many Arabic proper names have transliteration-type English equivalents. 
For instance, oø is standardly 'Amman'. In other cases the transliteration­
type English eguivalent is more localized. In many part of the Middle East, 
• 
the name Ĩ is standardly transcribed as 'Hussein', or 'Hussain'; in north 
Africa., however, where French is the dominant European language, the standard 
transcription is 'Hoceine'. 
Some Arabic proper names, obviously, have standard indigenous English 
equivalents which cannot properly be regarded as transliterations; e.g. 'Cairo' 
for .,.,..W I, 'Damascus' for J-!.-o..l. Other cases are even more complicated; 
for example for @I on..: .' I I  ) .J I, English uses 'Casablanca', i.e. the Spanish 
name for the city, of which the Arabic is itself a calque. 
Where there is a standard indigenous English equivalent, a translator would 
be expected to use this, except where there is a compelling reason not to do 
so; e.g. a need to introduce a greater degree of exoticism into the TL text 
than would be conveyed by the use of the standard English TL equivalent.

This text contains a number of features which are taken from Egyptian 
Arabic. In this regard you may find the following information useful: 
This means 'woman' as well as 'sanctity', 'inviolability' in both 
Standard Arabic and colloquial Egyptian. However, it is more 
commonly used to mean 'woman' in Egyptian. As the double 
meaning 'inviolability/woman' suggests, the word carries strong 
cultural associations of the status of women in Egyptian society. 
The rendering of the feminine suffix as (.. here, rather than (., 
indicates the colloquialism. 
In Standard Arabic :i .' :" .,. means 'arithmetical problem, sum' 
(Wehr), but in Egyptian collOquial it has the sense of 'calculation'. 
Here what is meant is the cost of the hotel. 
In Standard Arabic this means 'leisurely, gently, slowly, at one's 
ease' (Wehr). Here the author has used the phrase in the more 
colloquial sense of 'at least'. 
The phrase tiJ I uh is used in Egyptian Arabic 'to imply misgiving 
about an outcome' (Badawi and Hinds). ¯ģ in Egyptian Arabic 
can mean 'matter', 'affair' (as well as 'story'). Here what seems to 
be meant is that'i,J IĤ I can't afford the hotel.

The text is taken from a book entitled t഻ I by the Sudanese academic

social significance of the traditional custom of 'scarification' <t.: 1 ,,;, -. I I) in 
northern Sudan: that is, the making of long cuts (normally either vertical or 
horizontal) into people's cheeks with a sharp blade or razor, in order to 
produce a lasting scar on the face. A scar produced in this way is called a 
ڟ or മ (plural t഼). The action of producing the scar is referred to 
in this book as iJL-.i (cf. Wehr for general senses of ഷ). 
Boys typically underwent scarification around the age of five, and girls 
around the age of ten. The custom of scarification has in effect died out in 
the last few decades (although it may still persist in some very isolated rural 
communities).

Compensation 
4.1 BASIC PRINCIPLES 
In Chapter 3.3, we referred to the need on some occasions to palliate the 
effects of the use of calque by some form of compensation. The example we 
gave was the insertion of 'You know the saying' before 'A day for you, a 
day against you', to make it clear that this is a proverb and not an original 
formulation. This example is the tip of an iceberg. Compensation, in one or 
another of its many forms, is absolutely crucial to successful translation. In 
this chapter, we shall look more closely at what compensation is and is not, 
and at a few of the forms it can take. 
To introduce the question we shall take examples from the last sentence 
of the ST in Practical 3.1, from the short story J IT (UJ..I! 1954: 127): 
tWo. b..l.:'-:'j .:...IVj WJ ' XLS ഡƮ b 1 Yj4--0 uLS [ . .. ] 
.. S.:J I .:.lo IJ..IJ ªL.....:J I Uj-ljJ r.il .... !J t෎1 d....:i.cU  ǣ"...,. 
A possible translation of .:...IZj in this extract is 'let out a ululation'. 
This would maintain a certain foreignness, the assumption being that even a 
reader who did not know what a ululation was in the context of women's 
behaviour in social gatherings in Egypt would be able to guess that it was 
some sort of culture-specific vocal sound. However, in a different context, or 
with a different readership, this assumption might not be justified - 'ululation' 
could sound facetious or comic. These effects would be a betrayal of the ST 
effects, and therefore count as a serious translation loss. The loss could be 
palliated by adding an exegetic element (cf. Ch. 1.3), along the lines 'let out 
a ululation as women do at times of great joy'. This does not make the idea 
of ululation any less unfamiliar in itself, but it does make the unfamiliarity 
less likely to have a misleading effect. This exegetic translation is a simple 
example of compensation: that is, mitigating the loss of important ST features 
by approximating their effects in the TT through means other than those used 

Compensation 
41 
in the ST. In other words, one type of translation loss is palliated by the 
deliberate introduction of another, considered less unacceptable by the 
translator. So, in our example, adding 'as women do at times of great joy' 
incurs great translation loss in terms of economy, denotative meaning (cf. 
Chapter 5) and cultural presupposition, but this is accepted because it 
significantly reduces an even greater loss in terms of message content. It is 
important to note the ad hoc, one-off, element in compensation: this is what 
distinguishes it from constraint, as we shall se in a moment. 
Translators make this sort of compromise all the time, balancing loss 
against loss in order to do most justice to what, in a given ST, they think is 
most important. Our main aim in this book is to encourage student translators 
to make these compromises as a result of deliberate decisions taken in the 
light of such factors as the nature and purpose of the ST, the purpose of the 
IT, the nature and needs of the target public, and so on. In taking these 
decisions, it is vital to remember that compensation is not a matter of inserting 
any elegant-sounding phrase into a IT to counterbalance any weaknesses 
that may have crept in, but of countering a specific, clearly defined, serious 
loss with a specific, clearly defined less serious one. 
To discern the parameters of compensation a bit more clearly, we can 
begin by looking at another expression in the extract from ..) I" ,, 
0 cited 
above, the final two words SlJ I L.I"J. There is a double difficulty here. 
The first difficulty is the word ഠl In a Sufi context, ඐ,j involves 
chanting a religious phrase, typically til I, or one of the other names of God. 
In this context, this would be a communal practice. A transliteration of ¬,j 
as a cultural borrowing - e.g. 'dhikr' - would be incomprehensible to any 
but a specialist reader. An exegetic translation would be clearer, e.g. 'communal 
invocations of the name of God'. This rendering is like a dictionary entry, a 
paraphrase which defines the term ĥ,j, for which there is no conventional 
lexical equivalent in English (cf. the definition in Wehr of ¬,j in Sufism as 
'incessant repetition of certain words or formulas in praise of God, often 
accompanied by music and dancing'). Such a translation incurs notable 
translation loss in that it is less economical and semantically less precise than 
the ST එ,j, but this loss is not as serious as the obscurity of English 'dhikr' 
would be. 
We can use this case to explore the boundary between compensation and 
constraint. This is a less straightforward example of compensation than was 
the exegetic translation of J[j. 'Ululate' is a fairly common lexical 
equivalent for JVj - although we may note that even this involves semantic 
distortion; Collins English Dictionary defines 'ululate' as 'to howl or wail, as 
with grief, and the word is derived from the Latin ulula 'screech owl', 
which suggests a sound rather different from the 'ululation' of women in the 
Middle East. Nonetheless, given that 'ululate' is commonly used to translate 
JVj, the translator can freely choose whether to use it on its own and accept 
the slight obscurity and the misleading connotations, or whether to minimize 

42 
Thinking Arabic translation 
these by introducing a different loss in terms of denotative meaning and 
economy. ī,j is different. To the extent that 'dhikr' is not feasible, the 
translator has no choice but to paraphrase. In principle, where there is no 
choice, there is constraint, not compensation. In our example, of course, 
there is still an element of choice, in that it is the translator who decides what 
the paraphrase will be; to this extent, there is an element of compensation in 
the translation. This would change if the paraphrase became the conventional 
TL rendering of fi,j. Once a rendering has entered the bilingual dictionary as 
a conventional lexical equivalent, using it is not a case of compensation. 
Thus, if the dictionary gave the meaning of Ĭ,j as 'communal invocation of 
the name of God', and if this were standardly used as this equivalent in 
English, using this rendering in a IT would not be an instance of compensation, 
but of constraint - there would be little option but to adopt the conventional 
rendering. 
The boundary between compensation and constraint is more clearly seen 
in communicative translations. For example, if we can imagine the very first 
time Ä ĭ I ..Ilj was translated as 'it made matters worse', this was a case 
of compensation: the calque 'it increased the clay moistness' is, effectively, 
ungrammatical and meaningless. The first translator was prepared to incur 
major semantic and grammatical loss in order to avoid meaninglessness, an 
even greater loss. This was a resourceful piece of compensation. Since then, 
however, in so far as the communicative translation is mandatory, the translator 
is not exercising true choice, but simply identifying the conventionally correct 
translation. 
Of course, the translator may decide that, in a given context, adopting the 
conventional dictionary translation would incur unacceptable translation loss. 
If the conventional translation is modified in order to palliate the loss, this 
may well be a case of compensation. To return to our example from J I."..L 
given above, two key elements in the sentence as a whole are ̿,j̀] 0 
J.,c..:J1.S [́͂ b I 'teemed like ants' (the implication of 'communal') 
and the clashing noise of many voices (-=-..I.rCj '[let out a] ululation', ଯ 
'murmuring', Įj..-.:Aj 'chirping', and į,j 'invocations'). Supposing the 
dictionary gives 'communal invocations of the name of God' as the 
conventional translation of ..,.s,j. It may be felt, in this particular context, that 
'invocations' would be too abstract, denoting a particular mode of relationship 
with God and losing the stress on 'voice' that is conveyed in the ST implication 
of 'chanting'. The translator might then decide on a new rendering of İl 
One possibility is 'communal chanting(s) of the name of God', which keeps 
both elements, but loses that of 'throng of people'. A third possibility is to 
keep all three elements, as in 'communal chanted invocations', or 'chanted 
communal invocations' - but these collocations (cf. Ch. 6.6) sound odd in 
English, more like technical definitions than expressive descriptions. This 
loss in idiomaticity might be avoided by conflating 'communal' and 'chanting' 
into a single verb, as in 'chorusing invocations of the name of God'; the loss 

Compensation 
43 
here is that the element of musicality which is typically present in ƭ,j is at 
best only implicit: a chorus of voices does not necessarily sing - it can just as 
easily be speaking or shouting. 
All these alternatives therefore incur significant loss. But to the extent 
that each is a one-off, unpredictable translation, created to meet the demands 
of a specific context, they are all instances of compensation, rather than of 
constraint. Whichever one is chosen, the translator is balancing loss against 
loss in an attempt to preserve in the IT the textual effects which are deemed 
most important in this particular ST, even though they are produced there by 
different means. 
The second difficulty posed by ;.:J I .:.L... I,J.l is the use of .:.L..I,J.l 
'whirlpools' as the first part of this genitive structure. The metaphor is clear, 
vivid and appropriate, fitting in well with the imagery of throng (especially 
the teeming ants) and noise-of-many-voices. But a literal translation, such as 
'whirlpool of communal invocations', is inelegant (where the ST is not), and 
perhaps somewhat obscure. It could even be positively misleading, with a 
connotation of 'fast and short' , via collocative meanings (Ch. 6.6) of 
'whirlwind' - cf. 'whirlwind campaign/romance/tour' , etc. The temptation is 
strong to drop the image, accept the loss, operate a grammatical transposition 
and use an adjective like 'ceaseless' or 'unceasing' . 'Eddying' would be 
closer than these in terms of denotative meaning, but 'eddying of communal 
invocations' is almost as obscure as 'whirlpool of communal invocations' ; 
any sense it does make is too gentle and decorative. Yet the whirlpool image 
is too important in this text to be surrendered without a fight. Can it be 
preserved through compensation? In such cases, it is always worth looking to 
see where else in the clause, sentence or paragraph the image might be fitted 
in, without loss of coherence or idiomaticity, and without too great a loss of 
ST textual effect. The essential point is that Zubaida's voice is lost in a 
whirlpool of other voices. One possibility is therefore to combine grammatical 
transposition and a change of place in the sentence. Here are two alternatives 
for discussion: 
... her voice was whirled away among the pious murmurings ... 
... her voice was whirled away, lost among the pious murmurings ... 
Another possibility is to keep the noun 'whirlpool', but to apply it to all the 
voices: 
... when Zubaida let out a ululation, it was lost in a whirlpool of voices, the 
pious murmurings, ... 
In all three versions, the specific application of .:.L.I,J.l to Ƭ,j is lost, and 
the grammar is changed. But at least the strategic connection between teeming 
people and whirling voices is kept. In any case, the adjective 'ceaseless' can 

44 
Thinking Arabic translation 
still be applied to whatever rendering is chosen for ടj: if this is done, the 
ST emphasis on the insistent presence of the invocations/chants is kept, since 
they are marked apart from the murmurings and cries/chirpings. There is 
thus, in the sentence as a whole, grammatical loss and a loss in semantic 
precision; but there would have been a far greater loss if 'whirlpool' had 
been applied to 'invocations', or if it had been dropped altogether. Each of 
these three alternatives is a good example of compensation: although the ST 
effects are not preserved completely, far less of them is lost than would have 
been the case if the translator had not introduced the specific, anodyne, 
losses we have outlined. 
4.2 CATEGORIES OF COMPENSATION 
In discussing TIs, it is sometimes helpful to distinguish between different 
categories of compensation. We shall suggest three. Remember, however, 
that most cases of compensation belong to more than one category. The most 
important thing is not to agonize over what label to give to an instance of 
compensation, but to be clear what loss it compensates for and how it does 
so. Remember, too, that the question of how to compensate can never be 
considered in and for itself, in isolation from other crucial factors: context, 
style, genre, the purpose of the ST and the TT. 
Compensation is needed whenever consideration of these factors confronts 
the translator with inevitable, but unwelcome compromise. Simply put, it is a 
less unwelcome compromise. It usually entails a difference in kind between 
the ST textual effect and the TT textual effect We shall call this compensation 
in kind It can take very many forms. For instance, it may involve making 
explicit what is implicit in the ST, or implicit what is explicit. Denotative 
meaning may have to replace connotative meaning, and vice versa. 
Compensation may involve substituting concrete for abstract, or abstract for 
concrete. It nearly always involves different parts of speech and syntactic 
structures from those indicated by literal translation. In some texts, 
compensation in kind might involve replacing a piece of Classical Arabic 
poetry by an analogous piece of English poetry. An ST pun may have to be 
replaced with a different form of word play. All these sorts of substitutions 
may be confined to single words, but they more usually extend to whole 
phrases, sentences, or even paragraphs. Sometimes, a whole text is affected. 
For instance, quite apart from lexical or grammatical considerations, if a 
poem is heavily marked by rhyme and assonance, and the translator decides 
that for some reason rhyme and assonance would lead to unacceptable 
translation loss, compensation might consist of heavily marking the TT with 
rhythm and alliteration instead. 
All the examples of compensation we have discussed so far are various 
sorts of compensation in kind. Here is another, taken from a translation of 

Compensation 
45 
the opening two paragraphs of the short story JJ̓I ڗ ପ by the 
Sudanese writer @E B I. This section consists of an exchange between 
Sheikh Mahjoub and Hussein the Merchant, who wants to buy the produce of 
his date palm. What is striking about Hussein the Merchant's speech is that it 
uses Standard Arabic (and a rather formal version of Standard Arabic at 
that), whereas almost all the other dialogue in the story uses Sudanese colloquial. 
The use of Standard Arabic here is intended to emphasize the haughtiness of 
Hussein the Merchant, clearly distinguishing his character from others within 
the short story. The original Arabic reads: 
« ti.J I ږ » 
.dJL:. ɬ ̈́J ' J 0.0 { lo 4:... ജ 'OJ F ƪ 0Jyk. » 
/JI I Y..,J IJ 14.!, ,.;1 1 ය ଫ ഛ tl .:.UIJ ' ͅ I (J 
. « ..:.ƪ ]yk. C:?"L...,:j Y ଩I ͆.u 0U , ĭବL...... 
This has been translated (Montgomery 1994: 21) as: 
'No deal!' 
'Look here my man, with twenty pounds you could settle your debts and 
make your life a lot easier. The Eid festival is tomorrow and you haven't 
even bought a sacrificial lamb yet. As 1 would not ordinarily pay more 
than ten pounds for a date palm like this, 1 would like to think that 1 am 
being of some assistance to you. ' 
The style of this translation is somewhat formal and stilted, and is hardly 
typical of everyday spoken English; take for instance 'my man' (for OJ F), 
'ordinarily' (where 'normally' might be expected), and 'I am being of some 
assistance to you' (for ĭଭL....... /) . This is deliberate compensation in 
kind; whereas Hussein the Merchant's haughtiness is conveyed in the Arabic 
by the use of standard Arabic, in English it is conveyed by the use of a rather 
stuffy register. 
Compensation also usually entails change of place, the TI textual effect 
occurring at a different place, relative to the other features in the TI, from 
the corresponding textual effect in the ST. We shall call this compensation 
in place. Moving 'whirlpool' so that it qualifies 'murmurings' and 'cries' as 
well as 'invocations' is a good example. And, as in the same example, 
compensation very often involves both change in kind and change in place. 
Here is another example, from the story >UIJ.JL.:J I by .,)-"l,:j F..,.sj. The ST 
phrase JLW r+-' JLL.:.l I ഝƫ I ,.,..;. u-lWJ I e.!'" .' I I  has been 
translated as 'You can put it on arid frighten my naughty little brothers' (St 
John 1999: 29). Here the prepositional phrase JL.i..a.JL.S: is not translated 
literally, 'like devils': grammatically, 'my little brothers for they are like 
devils' would not fit in idiomatically; and semantically it would give a sense 
of evil not intended in the ST. So the translator has made use of compensation 

46 
Thinking Arabic translation 
in kind, replacing the Arabic clause àJli.a.Já ړ by an appropriate English 
adjective 'naughty'. This compensation in kind, however, also involves 
compensation in place; the clause àJL1....Jl.S ڒ of the ST is lost from its 
position after the noun in the ST, to be rendered by an adjective before the 
noun in the IT. That is, while a literal translation ('for they are like devils') 
would entail unacceptable grammatical and semantic loss, omitting the idea 
altogether would be just as unacceptable; the ST introduces grammatical and 
semantic changes (and therefore losses), but these are compensated for because 
the changes preserve the idiomaticity and the essential message content. 
Another example of compensation in place and kind is found in a translation 
of ա " (.;1.)-"" ǛI by ڔڕI rഘ. This is a play, written in 
Egyptian colloquial Arabic, in the 1930s, about the return to Egypt of an 
Egyptian couple who have spent the last few years in Paris. In our example 
the wife adopts a pseudo-French style of broken Arabic as she is discussing 
how a French woman might view Egypt: 
JL.....:;. â I" ,!j IF .. Ʃ ഖ" <Y'L.:. 4.lS:  (j J,.,.i:i ڶ ڷi 
..::.t.=.....l l .. ഗ Ʃ t....L.:.S: 4.lS: l.:.A l:U.l 
. .JI" .. J.,.b âI" ,!j rã" " 
. tw:.ക ..:.4-:'y.  äå I ଧନ 4.lS: l.:.A 
The ST here includes pseudo-Frenchisms on both the phonic and the 
grammatical levels. Phonically, we find t for c.. (ചI" for æIJ twice; 
Jç for .)ങ), and also ଦ for ..:. (J.,.b for J"":'). Grammatically, we find 
other features felt to be typical of native French speakers, e.g. lack of proper 
gender agreement. These effects cannot be copied exactly in English, because 
English is too different from Arabic phonically and grammatically. But to 
lose them from the IT would be unacceptable - the text would be pointless 
without them. Accordingly, the translator (Foreman 1996: 35) renders this 
speech as: 
- Yes, she'd say to me that Egypt is full of extremely feelthy people zey 
eat and zey sleep like zee peeg and zat everywhere round here is covered 
in garbage. In France all zee garbage is throuwn on ze dust cart. 
The translator has mimicked the pronunciation of English by French speakers 
(or at least this pronunciation as it is popularly presented); so 'feelthy' for 
'filthy', 'zey' for 'they', 'zee' for 'the', 'peeg' for 'pig', etc. He has also 
introduced some grammatical errors typically made in English by French 
speakers; e.g. 'zey eat and zey sleep like zee peeg', instead of 'they eat and 
sleep like pigs'. The pseudo-French forms of the TI, however, do not precisely 
mirror those of the ST. There is thus a touch of cultural transplantation (Ch. 
3.4), and it amounts to compensation in kind and in place: ST phonic and 
grammatical features are lost, but the textual effects are largely restored by 
other means and in other places in the IT. 

Compensation 
47 
Compensation also often involves a change in 'economy', ST features 
being spread over a longer length of TI. We shall call this compensation by 
splitting. Compensation by splitting very often also involves compensation 
in kind. Examples are the renderings of ":".l,.,.l j and ƭj above. Here is an 
example of compensation by splitting that involves minimal change in kind. 
It is from the novel ڑ I y,j..o, by the Palestinian writer .Jƨ ଡ. 
The ST concerns the relations between the workers at a newspaper: 
01 ഔlj'o; .'j,1 1 I .: .  ,all Ǥ 0Y.lǥ rlǦI", .l", ഒ ഓ r.J 
L J.-JI ǧ rǨYI J.: i , i I C!:': '  ,al b4-=oYI  .ǩ ഑ 
.. ൰..I..!. Jla", ÎJ-"-! 0",Ll....:4 ǪI Ě 1-4J", ,J,:i'YI 
This has been translated (Brown 1996: 43) as: 
There was neither mutual friendship nor respect on a personal level, which 
would make possible a step in the right direction towards achieving harmony 
at work at least. Owing to this, their dealings with each other continued to 
be motivated by overwhelming greed and extreme caution. 
In the ST, the Arabic dual adjective ƹ..1.-<!. applies to both ÎZ 'greed' 
and Jla 'caution'. However, rather than go for a translation such as 'extreme 
greed and caution', the translator has opted to split the Arabic adjective 
ƹ.1..<!. into the two English adjectives 'overwhelming' and 'extreme'. She 
has done this on the grounds that these two forms collocate more happily 
with each of their respective nouns than would any single adjective applied 
to both nouns. In other words, a small loss of accuracy in denotative meaning 
is compensated for by a greater degree of collocational acceptability than 
would be possible in literal translation. 
A similar rationale applies to the following example, from a book entitled 
/ǫ 1 01Ǭ1  cI", dI: 
.

This has been translated (Humphrys 1999: 12) as: 
It is clearly contradictory that the ruling military, who adopt a policy of 
development and promote huge state projects [ ... ] 
Here the single word u 
'
, .'  i.! in Arabic has been split in the TI, being 
translated firstly as 'adopt', since this is a word which typically goes with 
'development', and secondly as 'promote', since this is word which typically 
goes with '[state] projects'. 
We have labelled the last two examples compensation rather than constraint. 

48 
Thinking Arabic translation 
because the translation decisions are unpredictable, depending entirely on 
context: neither splitting is likely to be prescribed in the dictionary. However, 
translation by expansion is often the conventional, more or less mandatory, 
solution. In such cases, compensation does not come into the reckoning. For 
example, u!. 1Ħ in Arabic covers includes both 'moths' and 'butterflies' in 
English (that is to say, it is a hyperonym of 'moth' and 'butterfly'; cf. Ch, 
5.1.2). Accordingly, one would expect an Arabic entomological book title 
u!. 1"r-iJ 1 to be translated into English as 'Moths and Butterflies', or as 
'Butterflies and Moths'. In either case, there is no question of compensation 
being involved here. 
Similarly, expansion is sometimes dictated by the grammatical or stylistic 
norms of the TL. For example, subject phrases beginning with .:,1 in Arabic 
are very typically translated by the initial phrase 'the fact that' in English. 
Thus, the Arabic [ . . . ]  1 ഉ ഊ.,..:J 1 .:,഍ .:,1 will in many contexts 
almost inevitably be translated as 'The fact that employment in the army is 
[ ... r (Humphrys 1999: 5). 
The distinction between compensation in kind, compensation in place and 
compensation by splitting is a rough-and-ready categorization. One could 
even argue for a fourth general category, that of 'compensation by merging', 
as in this description: 
...iഋ ഌJ U"t-..:.l 1 ī ', .' -, ",.! .:,1 .:,,,J bWഎ  ..)-:'Lw:. J,...L.u

. .:,IJ͇I Ǆ 1  u-k ڋ.,rll ڌ)ll 
This has been translated (Brown 1996: 38) as: 
Saber fidgeted in his bed without feeling sleepy. Instead he let his eyes 
roam about the room: a small broken table, books scattered on a straw 
mat, a clay pitcher full of water and some old clothes hanging on one of 
the walls. 
Here, ഄ I", Ƨ 1 0-.0 b՞ has been translated as 'a straw mat' rather 
than the literal 'straw and cane mat' , on the grounds that this is over-descriptive 
in English, the western target audience caring little for the distinction between 
'straw' and 'cane'. Perhaps, then, the semantic loss is compensated for by 
avoidance of the greater loss in idiomaticity that literal translation would 
have entailed. 
This kind of instance aside, it is certainly true that translation by compression 
or omission is, like translation by expansion, often virtually mandatory. 
Consider, for example .. . ", 1,j"A when used in an Arabic radio broadcast to 
introduce a new sub-topic, or ۊlJ~ Wഏ at the start of a paragraph in an 
Arabic newspaper. Given the mandatory nature of the omission, the notion of 

Compensation 
49 
compensation is not applicable here. 
However many categories of compensation it may be theoretically possible 
to define, our aim here is not to elaborate a taxonomy, but simply to alert 
students to the possibilities and mechanisms of compensation, both in producing 
and in analysing and explaining TIs. In fact, in the case of compensation in 
kind and in place, it is not usually even necessary to label them as such, 
because virtually all compensation entails difference in kind and in place. It 
cannot be stressed too much that the point of this course is to enable students 
to produce good translations, and to give them an apparatus and a terminology 
that will help them to say why they are good. The aim is not to show off the 
terminology for its own sake, but to put it to use where it is helpful. 
The most important lesson to be learned from the discussion is that 
compensation is a matter of choice and decision. It is the reduction of an 
unacceptable translation loss through the calculated introduction of a less 
unacceptable one. Or, to put it differently, a deliberately introduced translation 
loss is a small price to pay if it is used to avoid the more serious loss that 
would be entailed by literal translation. So where there is no real choice open 
to the translator, the element of active compensation is minimal. The clearest 
illustrations of this, as we have seen, are communicative translation and the 
myriad cases where the generally accepted literal translation involves 
grammatical transposition andlor expansion or contraction. 
Compensation, then, is a matter of conscious choice, and is unlikely to be 
successful if left purely to inspiration (although a touch of inspiration never 
comes amiss!). Before deciding on how to compensate for a translation loss, 
translators are therefore best advised to assess as precisely as possible what 
the loss is and why it matters, both in its immediate context and in the ST as 
a whole. Only then can they be reasonably sure of not inadvertently introducing, 
somewhere in the TI, more serious translation losses than the ones they are 
trying to reduce.

newspapers from around the world. No specialist knowledge is to be 
assumed on the part of the TI reader. 
(ii) Translate the text into idiomatic English.

Denotative lleaning and 
translation issues 
5.1 DENOTATIVE MEANING 
In this chapter and the next one, we shall consider the two basic aspects of 
the semantic matrix of language: denotative meaning and connotative meaning. 
Translation is concerned with meaning. But, as has already become very 
clear, the term 'meaning' is elastic and indeterminate, especially when applied 
to a whole text. This is true even of denotative meaning (also known as 
'cognitive', 'propositional' or 'literal' meaning). Denotative meaning is 
that kind of meaning which is fully supported by ordinary semantic conventions, 
such as the convention that 'window' refers to a particular kind of aperture in 
a wall or roof. 
Unfortunately, even dictionary definitions of words are not without their 
problems. This is because they impose, by abstraction and crystallization of 
one or more core senses, a rigidity of meaning that words do not often show 
in reality, and partly because, once words are put into a context, their denotative 
meanings become even more flexible. These two facts make it difficult to pin 
down the precise denotative meanings in any text of any complexity. The 
more literary the text, the more this is so; but it is true even of the most 
soberly informative texts. In this chapter, we shall discuss three degrees of 
semantic equivalence - that is, how close given expressions are to having 
identical denotative meanings. 
5.1.1 Synonymy 
Denotative meaning is a matter of categories into which a language divides 
the totality of communicable experience. So, for example, the denotative 

Denotative meaning and translation issues 
53 
meaning of the word 'pencil' (in the relevant sense) consists in the fact that 
all over the world one may find similar objects that are included in the 
category of 'pencil' - and of course al sorts of other objects that are excluded 
from it. To define a denotative meaning is to specify a 'range' covered by a 
word or phrase (in the relevant sense) in such a way that one knows what 
items are included in that range or category and what items are excluded. It 
is helpful to visualize denotative meanings as circles, because circles can 
represent intersections between categories. In exploring correspondence 
between denotative meanings, it is these intersections that are most significant, 
because they provide a kind of measure of semantic equivalence. So, for 
instance, the expressions 'my mother's father' and 'my maternal grandfather' 
may be represented as two separate circles. The two ranges of denotative 
meaning, however, coincide perfectly: that is, in every specific instance of 
use, 'my mother's father' and 'my maternal grandfather' include and exclude 
exactly the same referents. This can be visualized as sliding the two circles 
on top of each other and finding that they are same size and cover one 
another exactly, as in Figure 5.1: 
my mother's 
father 
Figure 5.1 
This exemplifies the strongest form of semantic equivalence: full synonymy: 
the two expressions are synonyms of one another. 
Comparison of denotative meanings can also be made between expressions 
from two or more different languages. For example, 'maternal uncle' and 
JÅ (in one sense of the word Jı) cover exactly the same range of meanings 
and are therefore fully synonymous, as is seen in Figure 5.2: 

54 
Thinking Arabic translation 
JL;. 
matemal uncle 
Figure 5.2 
5.1.2 Hyperonymy-hyponymy 
Unfortunately full synonymy is exceptional, both intralingually and 
interlingually. Even the nearest semantic equivalent for translating the 
denotative meaning of an ST expression usually falls short of being a full TL 
synonym. A simple example of this kind of failure is provided by a comparison 
between 'uncle' in English and  and JL.;. in Arabic. Here the English term 
'uncle' might be a typical translation equivalent of the Arabic  or JĲ; 
'uncle' in English lacks the 'technical' associations of 'paternal uncle' and 
'maternal uncle', and would therefore be preferred in many contexts in 
translating ଏ or JL.:;., regardless of the translation loss involved. From the 
point of view of denotative meaning, however, 'uncle' has a greater range of 
meanings than ħ or Jĳ, since 'uncle' includes both paternal uncle and 
maternal uncle. Using in this case half-circles as well as a circle to represent 
ranges of denotative meaning, we can represent the relationship between 
'uncle' in English, and  and JL;. in Arabic as in Figure 5.3: 

Denotative meaning and translation issues 
55 
Figure 5.3 
The relationship between 'uncle' and °, and between 'uncle' and J± is 
known as hyperonymy-hyponymy. An expression with a wider, less specific, 
range of denotative meaning is a hyperonym (or superordinate) of one with 
a narrower and more specific meaning. Conversely, an expression with a 
narrower, more specific range of denotative meaning is a hyponym of one 
with a wider meaning. Thus ° and Jl:i. are both hyponyms of 'uncle' . 
Hyperonymy-hyponymy is so widespread in all languages that one can 
say that the entire fabric of linguistic reference is built up on such relationships. 
The same external reality can be described and rephrased in an indefinite 
number of ways, depending on how precise or vague one wants to be -
compare 'I bought a Hans Wehr' with these increasingly general rephrasings: 
'I bought an Arabic dictionary', 'I bought a dictionary', 'I bought a book' , 'I 
bought something' . Each of these rephrasings is a hyperonym of the ones 
before it. 
By its very nature, translation is concerned with rephrasing in such a way 
as to lose as little as possible of the integrity of an ST message. All other 
things being equal, this includes its degree of precision or vagueness. Therefore, 
the fact that both a hyperonym and a hyponym can serve for conveying a 
given message is of great importance to translation practice. It means that 
when there is no full TL synonym for a given ST expression (e.g. 'uncle'), 
the translator must look for an appropriate TL hyperonym or hyponym. In 
fact, translators do this automatically. 
This is obvious from the translation of pronouns between Arabic and 

56 
Thinking Arabic translation 
English. English has one second person pronoun 'you', which serves to 
address one, two or more people or animals (and occasionally also plants, 
inanimate objects, and even abstract ideas). English 'you' also makes no 
distinction between the sex of the person or animal being addressed (or the 
presumed sex of the plant, etc.). Arabic has five second person pronouns: 
.::..:ai, wi, L-..:ui, xi, and Ęi, involving distinctions between singular, 
dual and plural, and masculine and feminine (notions which subsume, but 
also go beyond, maleness and femaleness). Whenever any one of ST ٿi, 
.::..:ai, I 
• i ··i, xi, or Ęi is translated as IT 'you', the English IT has 
employed a hyperonym; and whenever ST 'you' is translated as Arabic IT 
ڀi, wi, l.-...:..:ii, xi, or ځi, the Arabic IT has employed a hyponym. 
There is nothing remarkable about this, and it is only occasionally that a 
translator opts, or is forced, to do something which deviates from this pattern. 
5.1.3 Particularizing translation and generalizing translation 
Translating by a hyponym implies that the IT expression has a narrower and 
more specific denotative meaning than the ST expression. TT J is more 
specific than ST 'uncle', adding particulars not present in the ST expression. 
We shall call this particularizing translation, or particularization for short. 
Another example of particularizing translation is the translation J,J..w..-, 
which could be used for either a 'box' or a 'bin' (amongst other things). 
Clearly, in the case of a street sweeper putting his rubbish into a J,J୺, the 
more plausible translation would be 'bin', while in the case of someone 
packing their books up to move them, the more plausible translation would 
be 'box'. In either case, however, the English particularizes. 
Translating by a hyperonym implies that the TT expression has a wider 
and less specific denotative meaning than the ST expression. In translating 
from Arabic to English, TT 'uncle' is more general than ST ħ (or J), 
omitting particulars given by the ST. We shall call this generalizing 
translation, or generalization for shoTt. Translating ೴೵ as 'garment' or 
JL.j-a as 'pipe' are other examples of generalization. 
In their semantic near-equivalence, particularization and generalization 
both entail a degree of translation loss: detail is either added to, or omitted 
from, the ST text. However, in the absence of plausible synonyms, translating 
by a hyponym or hyperonym is standard practice and entirely unremarkable. 
Only when a TL hyponym or hyperonym is unnecessary, or contextually 
inappropriate, or misleading, can a TT be criticized in this respect. 
Particularizing translation is acceptable if the TL offers no suitable 
alternative and if the added detail does not clash with the overall context of 
the ST or TT. Thus, .I.1.;a in Arabic means 'country, town, city, place, community, 
village' (Wehr). There is no single word in English that covers all these 
possibilities; therefore in a particular context the translator is likely to have 

Denotative meaning and translation issues 
57 
to choose the one of these which he or she feels is most appropriate. 
Particularizing translation is not acceptable if the 1L does in fact offer a 
suitable alternative to the additional detail, or if the added detail clashes with 
the overall context of ST or IT. 
As these examples suggest, similar considerations apply to generalizing 
translation as to particularizing translation. Generalization is acceptable if the 
TL offers no suitable alternative and the omitted detail is either unimportant 
in the ST or is implied in the TT context. For instance, Arabic uٻ refers 
only to something, such as a film or story, which makes one feel sad. In this 
it contrasts with ଍଎, which may refer to a person (or even to some 
non-human entity such as an animal), who is sad in themselves (i.e. who 
feels sad), or it may refer to something, such as a story or film, which makes 
one feel sad. In English the word 'sad' covers both possibilities: 'a sad 
person', 'a sad story'. Typically, there is unlikely to be any confusion in 
translating uଋ as 'sad', and this is likely to be the most natural-sounding 
translation in most cases. As the examples 'a sad person' and 'a sad story' 
suggest, normally the context makes immediately plain in English whether 
what is intended is a 'feeling sad' or a 'making sad' interpretation. 
Generalizing translation is not acceptable if the 1L does offer suitable 
alternatives, or if the omitted details are important in the ST but not implied 
or compensated for in the TT context. 
5.1.4 Partially overlapping translation 
There is a third degree of semantic equivalence. Consider the following: 
 L.:.l UL. ,.I" 
. .! ;'  '::"..H-JJ J.,..ټI ėٽپ I ƣlS.I l ೱ-J .u.J 
[ ... ] JIA 
This has been translated (Ives 1999: 10) as: 
The distinguished British writer Robert Fisk recently described a concert 
in Belgrade. 
Here the meaning of W Ui.:. overlaps with that of 'concert'. Some concerts 
are examples of W 4.l.h.; those in which there are singing. Similarly, some 
cases of W Uh are examples of concerts; those which are organized in a 
formal way with musical players and audience. However, some concerts are 
not examples of W ଌ; those in which there is no singing. Similarly, 
some cases of W 4.l.h. are not examples of concerts; those, for example, in 
which the t.I..L.a. is not organized in a formal way with musical players and 
audience. That is, 'concert' as a translation of ઇ 4 I • 
... generalizes by 
going beyond the idea of singing to include the possibility of music without 

58 
Thinking Arabic translation 
song; but at the same time it particularizes by excluding the non-organized 
form of 'party' which is a possible interpretation of Ub.. 
Taking the example of English 'concert' and Arabic Yආ ඇ, this kind 
of situation can be visualized as two partially overlapping circles, as in 
Figure 5.4: 
Figure 5.4 
TT adds: 
organised 
Here the area where the circles overlap represents the material the ST and IT 
have in common. The area on the left where the circles do not overlap 
represents what is omitted from the IT, and the area on the right where the 
circles do not overlap represents what is added to the IT. This is another 
category of degree in the translation of denotative meaning. We shall call it 
partially overlapping translation, or partial overlap for short Partial overlap 
is common and often unavoidable. It can apply to single words as well as to 
phrases or whole sentences. If, in a given context, .':LĦ_, .
..
 I is translated as 
'lecturer' , not 'teacher' ,  the IT certainly keeps the reference to someone 
who instructs. But it also particularizes, because it adds the specific detail 
that she works in a university and not in a school; and at the same time it 
generalizes, because it omits detail of her gender. 
When the TL offers no suitable alternatives, partial overlap is acceptable 
if the omitted detail is unimportant or is implied in the overall IT context, 
and if the added detail does not clash with the overall ST or IT contexts. 
Translating • .:L:.....l as 'lecturer' or 'teacher', for example, will - depending 
on context - normally be as harmless as it is unavoidable. 
Partial overlap is unacceptable if the omitted detail is important in the ST 
but is not implied in the overall context of the IT, or if the added detail 
clashes with the overall ST or IT contexts. If the TL does not offer suitable 
alternatives, then only compensation can counteract the omission or addition. 

Denotative meaning and translation issues 
59 
So the teacher's gender can be made clear through anaphora ('she' or 'her'), 
and a reference to her workplace can if necessary be inserted into the IT. 
5.2 SEMANTIC REPETITION IN ARABIC 
Arabic frequently makes use repetition of synonyms or near-synonyms, in a 
way which is not normally found in English. This kind of repetition is sometimes 
called semantic repetition (cf. Dickins and Watson 1999: 541-53). Semantic 
repetition is of two basic kinds: (i) where the two words or phrases used have 
closely-related but distinguishable meanings; an example of this is 
J.: I .. -, I I.., @I . 0 i ·, ,"." I 'investigation and analysis'; (ii) where the words or 
phrases used are fully synonymous or, at least in the context in which they 
are being used, there is no clear difference in meaning; an example of this is 
the doublet u...1..,.:... bJ • i·" • in the phrase u...1..,.:... bJ • i ."' • bJĵ. 
literally 'in a continuing continuous manner' . 
Semantic repetition may involve any of the major parts of speech: nouns, 
as in J.,.,-=,.JI.., ևI .0 i i .. " I; adjectives as in 4..l.w.1..,..:... bj • i teO .; verbs, for 
instance ilic.., de 'surprise and baffle' in the phrase LA೰ oLS 
ilic.., ί (literٷly 'her look surprised and baffled him'); and adverbs. 
for instanc :i .' ., i<· ;I.., 'silently and dispiritedly' in the phrase ..>-""'-:'1 
:i .' ., i< . ٸI.., ٶ I • flO i " b1Ķ1 (literally, 'he saw the same woman 
walking silently and dispiritedly'; cf. St John 1999: 4-5). 
Semantic repetition may be syndetic, i.e. it may involve the use of a 
connective (typically ..,) or - in the case of adjectives in particular, but also 
occasionally in the case of nouns and verbs - it may be asyndetic, i.e. it may 
occur without the use of a connective. An example of syndetic semantic 
repetition is <'s.r! I.., ٹ I in the phrase <'s.r!< I.., = I ..!l"J..J I 
'savage and oarbaric behaviour'. An example o( asyndetic semantic repetition 
is ..:.o I ..:.o in the phrase ..:.ol.i.:-=a I ..:.o , literally 'pretty, 
elegant girls' (for more details of syndetic vs asyndetic connection in Arabic 
se Dickins and Watson 1999: 47-9). 
A number of techniques can be used to translate semantic repetition into 
English. The first of these is to merge the two Arabic words into one English 
word. This is particularly likely to be an appropriate strategy where there is 
no clear difference in meaning between the two Arabic words. So അI: 
Hu.., t..JL.. may be translated as 'severe measures' (semantic repetition 
of t..JL... and Hu); 4.:UՕ.., ٺI ĥଉ L ആ I bJ'u [ ... ] 
[ ... ] may be translated as '[ ... ] the military's ability to modernize society 
[ ... J' (semantic repetition of ĥଈ and 4..:.ഇ); bJ • i '" . bJഈ 
li.-I.".:.... is likely to be translated as 'continually'. In this last example, the 
asyndetic coordination between bķ and 4..l.w.1ĸ makes a single-word 
translation still more likely; asyndetic doublets are typically used to represent 
a single concept. 

60 
Thinking Arabic translation 
A second fairly common technique, and one which is used where the two 
words in the semantic repetition have clearly different meanings, is to employ 
at least partial grammatical transposition. So the phrase It .! 
i ' I  Jl..=.:; 
..:.೧)I..;. \j I" might be translated as 'the collapse of all moral values'. Here 
the noun-doublet of the Arabic has been replaced by an adjective-noun phrase 
in English. 
The following are examples of grammatical transposition: ೨..rl l ଇ" 
G:.೬I" ೭L:a 'the man began to feel slightly claustrophobic', where the 
adverb-adjective phrase 'slightly claustrophobic' transposes the Arabic noun 
doublet G:..>-,JI" ೫ I; similarly .ٵ 4 .! • "I .!. I ..:..l.S:i .1-iJ 
೮ I" I 
c i i ,u'JL:a 4-:ll"l:t.:J" 4.L;J,1 iJ-"W I 'Academic research has 
confirmed and carefully analysed this disgraceful phenomenon', where the 
adverb-participial phrase 'carefully analysed' transposes the Arabic 
J.::'J., ... ::೯"J I" , ,c ii, .. 'J I. 
The final two translation techniques which we will consider take account 
of a feature of semantic repetition which we have not yet looked at: namely 
that it tends to provide a sense of emphasis. This is both because two words 
give two sets of meaning (even if it is only the same meaning repeated), and 
because they are longer and therefore 'heavier' in the sentence than only a 
single word would be. 
The first technique which takes into account the potentially emphatic 
aspect of semantic repetition is what we shall call semantic distancing. This 
involves relaying both elements of the Arabic doublet by different words in 
English, but choosing English words whose meanings are more obviously 
distinct than those of their Arabic counterparts. For example, in uL......S" 
iliƯ,, ഴ.l.:' LAവ, the two words ĩ.l.:' and J,AƯ are quite close in 
meaning (and according to Wehr's dictionary even share the English translation 
equivalents 'baffle' and 'startle'). The phrase has been translated (St John 
1999: 5), however, as 'Her appearance had both astonished and alarmed 
him'; the semantic difference between 'astonish' and 'alarm' is greater than 
that between ೩Ji and j.Aji. This semantic distancing ensures that the 
English translation does not involve what would otherwise be the stylistic 
oddity in English of having two words with virtually the same meaning 
conjoined with one another. 
It is also possible to combine semantic distancing with grammatical 
transposition. An example of this is ..:..:i" (,Si  ೪i ." , .. " i "" Ĥ L:.i 
.l.:'೥ I" ೦.,.:J I t,,ൂൃ· This-was said by a Lebanese Phalangist 
politician about his attitude to the Party. It has been translated (Jones 1999: 
7) as: 'I remain committed more than ever to the project of unification and 
reform'. Here the adjectival (active participle) doublet ,,1. .. "-, "" Ĥ has 
been grammatically transposed to a verb-adjective (past participle) doublet 
'remain committed'. In addition, however, the senses of J 
" i 
to' 
" and 
." to' " i . have been distanced more in the English version. 
One final technique for translating semantic repetition into English is to 

Denotative meaning and translation issues 
61 
maintain the same fonn of repetition. An example of this is l I ..!l"J.....J I 
{s..H..r.J I", translatable as 'this savage and barbaric behaviour' (cf. Ives 1999: 
f5). Here the repetition in English carries the same emphatic - and more 
specifically emotive - force as it does in Arabic. The convention which 
operates otherwise in English that words having much the same meaning are 
not conjoined is overridden. 
Something similar happens with respect to fonnulaic language, especially 
where this is of a religious or legal nature. The following is from an oath 
made by members of the Muslim Brotherhood to their first leader m 
L.:...J I: 
u..L.!J 1  >t..J..J I" u.; 1  u:..J 1" (..eW I  ٳ ٴ .:,.. w! - [ ... J 
[ ... J « U.1.AM" E@ IloA 8" 
This might be translated as: 
[ ... J 'You have the right to our unquestioning obedience, complete trust 
and total confidence. This is the oath which we have taken and the pledge 
which we have made'. 
Here the semantic repetition of E@ and U.1.AO is retained in the English, 
and even expanded as 'the oath we have taken', 'the pledge we have made' . 
Just as Arabic has semantic repetition involving individual words (lexical 
items) so it may have semantic repetition involving whole phrases. Here are 
some examples.  ' W" 0 .011" ,-:-,,,L..'il  '.rfi?I" @ I   [ ... J 
4 .! "?' .!jl؊'il" ,.I.! j<-, I I  can be translated as ' [  ... J between fonn and 
substance, and between tactic and strategy' (Flacke 1999: 7); here the virtually 
synonymous Arabic phrases ->-""_.JI,, JS.!.J I and w" 0 
;, I I" ,-:-,,,L..'i I are 
reduced.to the single phrase 'between fonn and substance' in English. [ ... J 
W1 1 (' j.i:a" 4 .! 0 I, -, I I  U->-" ..u..i:J ٲ I ..:.I  IA 'i I can be translated with 
semanuc distancing, as '[ ... J the v.ery measures that hinder development and 
stunt economic growth' (Humphrys 1999: 12). Here the translator has distanced 
the meaning of B I (S;C n from that of W1 1 iෟ' particularly by 
translating 4 .! 0" -, I I  as the general tenn 'development', and L.:.1 1 by the 
more specific 'economic growth'. 
As with semantic repetition involving individual lexical items, some of 
the best examples of maintenance of phrasal semantic repetition occur in 
fonnulaic language. Consider again t"':I'::l...Lb..J I" u..; I o I" LW I 
tL.L.....!..J I from the oath made by members of the Muslim Brotherhood to 
D I p (cited above). This phrase has been translated as 'unquestioning 
obedience, complete trust and total confidence'. Here the repetition of the 
Arabic has not only been maintained, but in fact increased by the addition of 
'unquestioning' before 'obedience' in the English. 

62 
Thinking Arabic translation 
5.2.1 Other forms of parallelism 
In addition to semantic repetition of words or phrases having the same meaning, 
Arabic also displays other forms of semantic parallelism, that is parallelism 
involving forms which do not mean the same or nearly the same as one 
another, but do stand in some fairly recognizable semantic relationship to 
one another. Consider the following from the start of an article by the Egyptian 
journalist ଄ 1 u i b o
o from .l-..J g I JF I, 21 September 1982 
(reproduced in transcription in AI-Jubouri 1984, on whose account the 
following analysis is based): 
J"..hJ hiI 4..:..:A 0 tAlJ l,j! Ƣ 01 '-:"j <:?1 ȉu..:....1 R 
 ULVI '-:"ģ l,j! ,JL...i.I I rJU l,j! 'r",.J.k..  GI l,j! '0L...:.Ȋ 1

, 
. ...iJ IJ tAl.u1 Y .)Ք !J CKI bȍ ! ாƊ 
Perhaps the easiest form of parallelism to se here is that produced by the use 
of antonyms or near-antonyms, i.e. words meaning the opposite or nearly the 
opposite of one another; the one example in this text is [ Y ]* and [ Y ].)..L.o.o 
in sentence 2. However, the text also displays other forms of semantic 
relationship. A number of words and phrases, while not synonyms or even 
near-synonyms, belong to the same semantic field; that is. they are all 
hyponyms of a given hyperonym. (For a useful discussion of semantic fields, 
see Baker 1992: 17-23.) Examples in sentence 1 are ଅ t-iIJ and rJL..,j

field: 'states of affairs'); also the entire phrases JଃI ! ..:.L....KJ I and

Here is an attempted idiomatic translation of this text. 
For any political party to succeed it must be prepared to stand up for 
freedom of expression and human rights, to protect the weak, to oppose 
corruption, to set itself the highest standards, and to act according to 
these standards. Any party which supports and defends the people will 
find that it is supported and defended by the people. 
The English TT retains some of the parallelism of the Arabic ST. Some of 
the parallel elements belonging to the same semantic field have been retained; 
in sentence I ,  'stand up for' and 'protect' (corresponding to the ST L tA lJ 

Denotative meaning and translation issues 
63 
and i"'u); 'freedom of expression' and 'human rights' (corresponding to ST 
.rJ1 ʟ and 0L...:.'i 1  J",h). The example of converse meaning is also 
effectively retained, in sentence 2: 'Any party which supports and defends 
the people' and 'it is supported and defended by the people' (corresponding 
to ST CI Ĕ4- -! . '-:-'  and ĕ4- -! C I .). 
However, the English TT also removes or modifies significant elements 
of the parallelism of the Arabic ST. In sentence 1, the complex ST parallelism 
of JWI -! ..:.l..KJ I and ೟ೠ -! Jೢ",J I is reduced to the phrase 'act 
according to these standards', albeit with some compensatory repetition in 
the TT with the previous phrase 'set itself the highest standards'. In sentence 
2, there is a double parallelism in the phrase 11 .).4 -!", ̭L.:,.,;JI IIೡ D! 
..JೣI", t-il..ul: Ī and .)ī are antonyms (Le. they have opposite 
denotative meanings), and ଁଂ, ̮I..1..-o and ..JՓ belong to the same 
semantic field. But this double parallelism is subsumed into the English TT 
'supports and defends' and 'supported and defended', which more obviously 
translate the Arabic C I Ĕ4- D! . '-:-'  and D! ̯ I . 
ĕ4- The double repetition of the TT 'supports and defends' and 'supported 
and defended' is an attempt to relay some of the rhetorical force of the 
complex repetition of the ST. 
The use of parallelism is a fairly typical feature of Arabic, particularly of 
persuasive texts (cf. Ch. l 3.2). It is also a feature of English. However, as the 
analysis of the above Arabic ST and English TT suggests, parallelism tends 
to be more widely used in Arabic than in English. Accordingly in translating 
from Arabic to English it is not infrequently necessarily to reduce the use of 
parallelism.

Connotative meaning 
and translation issues 
6.1 BASIC PRINCIPLES 
Denotative meaning as discussed in Chapter 5 is only one aspect of verbal 
meaning. The meaning of a text comprises a number of different layers: 
referential content, emotional colouring, cultural associations, social and 
personal connotations, and so on. The many-layered nature of meaning is 
something translators must never forget. 
Even within a single language, synonyms are usually different in their 
overall semantic effects - compare 'clergyman' and 'sky-pilot', 'adder' and 
'viper', 'go away' and 'piss off, etc. Each of these expressions has overtones 
which differentiate it from its synonym. We shall call such overtones 
connotative meanings - that is, associations which, over and above the 
denotative meaning of an expression, form part of its overall meaning. In 
fact, of course, connotative meanings are many and varied, and it is common 
for a single piece of text, or even a single expression, to combine more than 
one kind into a single overall effect. However, it is useful at this stage to 
distinguish six major types of connotative meaning, because learning to identify 
them sharpens students' awareness of the presence and significance of 
connotations in STs and TIs alike. Note that, by definition, we are only 
concerned here with socially widespread connotations, not personal ones. 
Only in exceptional circumstances do translators allow personal connotations 
to influence a TI. 
6.2 ATTITUDINAL MEANING 
Attitudinal meaning is that part of the overall meaning of an expression 
which consists of some widespread attitude to the referent. The expression 

Connotative meaning and translation issues 
67 
does not merely denote the referent in a neutral way, but also hints at some 
attitude to it. 
So, for instance, in appropriate contexts, 'the police', 'the filth' and 'the 
boys in blue' are synonyms in terms of denotative content, but they have 
different overall meanings. 'The police' is a neutral expression, but 'the filth' 
has pejorative overtones and 'the boys in blue' affectionate ones. These 
attitudes to the police are not part of the denotative meaning of the expressions, 
but it is impossible to ignore them in responding to the expressions. It is 
therefore important not to overlook them when translating. 
It is relatively difficult to fmd examples of attitudinal meaning in Standard 
Arabic which is an intrinsic feature of the word itself. This is at least in part 
because of the formal nature of Standard Arabic. As can be seen from the 
example 'the boys in blue' vs 'the police' , there is typically a close relation 
between attitudinal meaning and informality. Formal terms show a markedly 
smaller tendency to display attitudinal meaning than do informal terms. The 
inherent formality of Standard Arabic therefore correlates with the relative 
infrequency of words having strong attitudinal connotations. 
This does not mean, however, that attitudinal meaning is unimportant in 
translating Standard Arabic into English, since an attitudinal meaning can 
sometimes emerge from the context of usage of a word in an Arabic ST. In 
such cases it is sometimes appropriate to use a word with a different denotative 
meaning in English. Consider the following: 
0-.0 y.:...IU Ĺ.,.....:J I..r-iJ 1 
ĺ I  .. :::.LĻļ'il ->-'.,.:. 1JI .0 -. ;.@ 
[ . . . ] Ľľ ĿL.kj u-l l  
ŀ ŁL:... 
This has been translated (Humphrys 1999: 9) as: 
In short, military coups provide their perpetrators with the opportunity to 
move from military posts to political leadership [ ... ] 
This is taken from a book which deals with the relationship between the 
military and political power in the Arab world, and which is very critical of 
military involvement in Arab politics. Accordingly b..lL-:i 'leaders' in this 
context acquires rather negative overtones. In the IT, the translator reflects 
this by using the word 'perpetrators'. The negative aspect of 'perpetrators' is 
part of its denotative meaning, not its connotative meaning: it is by defmition 
not possible to perpetrate a good deed. 
It is also important to remember that, since English makes widespread use 
of attitudinal meaning, such meaning is likely to figure in idiomizing 
translations in particular. In such cases, the translator has to make sure that 
the IT attitudinal meaning does not clash with the context. Consider the 
following from a poem by }4.:A J Ij.:a: 

68 
Thinking Arabic transLation 
This has been translated (Rolph 1 995: 23) as: 
Ah Beirut ... my lady amongst millions of women 
In Arabic ١j 'female' and Ēi..>-"I 'woman' (plural .L.....:.) have clearly 
differentiated meanings; ٢i is a hyperonym of Ēi..>-" I. In the IT, however, 
the translator has used 'lady' and 'women'. 'Lady' and 'woman' are synonyms 
in English, the difference between them being that 'lady' has overtones of 
respect. 
Another example of the use of attitudinal connotation in translation is 
provided by this extract concerning the behaviour of Serbian troops towards 
Kosovo Albanians, taken from an article on the subject which is very 
sympathetic to the Albanian side: 
This has been translated (Ives 1999: 9) as follows: 
They have raided homes one by one. 
Here 'homes' can be contrasted with its near-synonym 'houses' . 'Houses' is 
a neutral word in English, whereas 'home' has warm emotional connotations. 
6.3 ASSOCIATIVE MEANING 
Associative meaning is that part of the overall meaning of an expression 
which consists of expectations that are - rightly or wrongly - associated with 
the referent of the expression. The word 'nurse' is a good example. Most 
people automatically associate 'nurse' with the idea of female gender, as if 
'nurse' were synonymous with 'female who looks after the sick ' .  This 
unconscious association is so widespread that the term 'male nurse' has had 
to be c0ined to counteract its effect: 'he is a nurse' still sounds semantically 
odd, even today. 
Any area of reference in which prejudices and stereotypes, however 
innocuous, operate is likely to give examples of associative meaning. Consider 
in this respect the associations of 'Crusade' in English, which continue to be 
positive (regardless of recent Western scholarly reassessments in this area), 
and contrast this with the strongly negative associations of ;j .! .' .! I· 0 u...=. in 
Arabic. Conversely, the word J4:!- in Arabic has highly positive associations, 
but in English the cultural borrowing 'jihad' is chiefly associated with 
organizations such as Islamic Jihad, which are widely regarded in the West 

Connotative meaning and translation issues 
69 
as extremist and anti-democratic. 
Similarly, Westerners who know something about Islam might regard 
Ramadan as a time of self-denial and fasting, which it is. However, in Muslim 
countries, Ramadan is also a time of celebration, in which children are allowed 
to stay up late, when there is a lot going on in the streets into the middle of 
the night, when families who have been separated corne together again, etc. 
These associations are likely to be missed even by an informed Western 
readership of a text in which Ramadan figures, unless they have some personal 
experience of the Middle East. 
Given the relative cultural distance between the Arab world and the English­
speaking world, associative meanings are likely to be a problem. Consider 
the potential difficulty of translating u+-:i- into English; a denotative near­
equivalent might be 'tea-house' , 'tea-garden', 'coffee-house', or possibly 
'cafe'. However, in terms of the cultural status of the u+-i- as the centre of 
informal male social life, the nearest equivalent in British culture might be 
the pub. Given the Islamic prohibition on the drinking of alcohol, however, 
such a translation would in most cases be obviously ruled out. 
Another example of how associative meaning may motivate a shift in 
denotative meaning between the ST and the IT is provided by the following, 
which describes a young man tending his dying mother: B "l.b..iJ I ..1-.!.  
i,.,...J I I • 0 .. ' 1- This is translated (Brown 1996: 32) as: 'then pulling the 
covers over her frail body'. Here, the translator has not translated i.,>A by a 
TL term which is roughly synonymous with it, such as 'old' or 'aged'. 
('Aged' here is perhaps relatively acceptable, although it provides information 
which is already well known to the reader, and therefore seems irrelevant in 
this context. For further discussion of the odder translation 'then pulling the 
covers over her old body', see § 6.7.) Rather than using the term 'old' or 
'aged', the translator has taken the association of i J-A 'old' with frailty (old 
people tend to be frail, particularly if they are very ill), and has accordingly 
used the denotative meaning 'frail' to render this associative meaning of 
i.>J'· 
6.4 AFFECTIVE MEANING 
Affective meaning is an emotive effect worked on the addressee by the 
choice of expression, and which forms part of its overall meaning. The 
expression does not merely denote its referent, but also hints at some attitude 
of the speaker or writer to the addressee. 
Features of linguistic politeness, flattery, rudeness or insult are typical 
examples of expressions carrying affective meanings. Compare, for example, 
'Silence please' and 'Shut up', or 
,-, 0 10 I I  "4ೖ1 and ೕi in Arabic. 
These expressions share the same core denotative meaning of 'Be quiet', but 
the speaker's implied attitude to the listener produces a different affective 

70 
Thinking Arabic translation 
impact in each case: polite in the first, rude in the second. 
Not only imperative forms, but also statements and questions, can have 
alternative forms identical in basic denotative meaning yet totally different in 
affective meaning. An example is 'I want the bog', which carries affective 
overtones of disrespect or at least extreme familiarity, vs 'I need to go to the 
lavatory', whose formality and politeness suggests respect for the addressee. 
Clearly, translators must be able to recognize affective meanings in the 
ST. But they must also be careful not to introduce unwanted affective meanings 
into the IT. To take an example from colloquial Arabic (Sudanese), a customer 
f 
in a general store says j..) # hJ1 'Give me a kilo of rice'. In accordance 
with the standard conventions in Arabic for requests which can be easily 
complied with, no politeness formula is included here. It would of course be 
possible to translate this sentence into English as 'Give me a kilo of rice'. 
However, this might sound rude, since the normal convention in English in 
shops is to use terms such as 'Please' and 'Thank you' (often repeatedly 
throughout the exchange). A safer option might be to cushion the TI, by 
translating the ST as something like 'A kilo of rice, please', or 'May I have a 
kilo of rice please'. 
It is fairly easy to confuse attitudinal meaning with affective meaning. 
The difference is that attitudinal meaning involves attitude to the referent 
(Le. the person or thing referred to), whereas affective meaning involves 
attitude to the addressee (Le. the person spoken to). Where the referent is 
also the addressee, affective meaning and attitudinal meaning will coincide. 
6.5 ALLUSIVE MEANING 
Allusive meaning is an intertextual feature (cf. Ch. 10.3.2). It occurs when 
an expression evokes an associated saying or quotation in such a way that the 
meaning of that saying or quotation becomes part of the overall meaning of 
the expression. 
For instance, in the novel ٟ I yJ..A The City of Oppression, by the 
Palestinian novelist • ..)೓ ૺ, the city in question is clearly Jerusalem 
(or a fictional equivalent). The term چ I ,J..6, which is used as the name 
of the city, alludes to the fact that -Jerusalem is sometimes referred to as 
r)l..J I ŏJ.A 'City of Peace'. It also perhaps recalls St Augustine's 'City of 
God' ( • ..)ƨ ૹ is a Christian, and makes widespread use of Christian 
symbolism in this work). For Arabic readers, a further possible allusive 
meaning is Ő I ňJ...,a, i.e. the term from which is derived the name for 
the city 'Meruna' ő..J.I (in pre-Islamic times known as '-:-'೔). For English­
speaking readers, particularly those of a Protestant background, the IT 'City 
of Oppression' might also carry echoes of John Bunyan's 'City of Destruction' 
in A Pilgrim's Progress, although it is extremely doubtful that these would 
have been intended in the ST.

6.6 COLLOCATION AND COLLOCA TIVE MEANING 
The term 'to collocate' means 'to typically occur in close proximity with'; 
hence a 'collocation' is an occurrence of one word in close proximity with 
another. 'Pretty' and 'handsome', for example, have a shared sense of 'good 
looking' in English. However, 'pretty' collocates readily with 'girl', 'boy', 
'woman', 'flower', 'garden', 'colour', 'village', while 'handsome' collocates 
with 'boy', 'man', 'car', 'vessel', 'overcoat', 'airliner', 'typewriter' (cf. Leech 
198 1 :  17; also, for translation implications of collocation, see Baker 1992: 
46-63). 
The importance of finding appropriate collocations in translation can be 
illustrated by the following examples: Ĵ..,J I 0,JL-:J I 'close cooperation' 
(not, for example, 'firm cooperation'), (SJ\ I ૸t.s:lJ I 'commercial acumen' 
(cf. the slight oddity of 'commercial intelligence'), 4 . ', b . a 
• LI ." i! I 
'forced smile' (cf. the oddity of 'artificial smile'). 
An important area for collocation is the use of conjoined phrases on the 
pattern 'X and Y'. Thus, English tends to say 'knives and forks' rather than 
'forks and knives', and 'pots and pans' rather than 'pans and pots', and for 
J"J I JAl,J ,j..,.lJ I ,-:-,L.:....ol one would expect 'the rich and powerful' (rather 
than 'the powerful and rich'); for 6 I7 89,J (S] ...iJ I \ i one would 
expect ' 14,00 Iraqi officers and men' (rather than ' 14,000 Iraqi men and 
officers'). Some collocations of this kind have become established idioms. 
Thus, :,J <l..AJ v.- has to be translated as 'his own flesh and blood', rather 
than the reverse 'his own blood and flesh', or some alternative phrasing such 
as 'his own blood and body'. (,His own blood and body would have the 
disadvantage that, for a reader of Christian background, it would have an 
allusive meaning of 'Last Supper' and an associative meaning of 'Eucharist'.) 
Deriving from the notion of collocation is the notion of collocativemeaning. 
This is the meaning given to an expression over and above its denotative 
meaning by the meaning of some other expression with which it collocates to 
form a commonly used phrase. An example is the word 'intercourse'. This 
has largely dropped out of usage in modern English, because of its purely 
connotative sexual associations, derived from the common collocation 'sexual 
intercourse' . 
Clearly the translator has to be able to recognize and render ST collocative 
meanings. But it is just as important to avoid unwanted collocative clashes in 
the TT. Consider the following: <,?.>-".w I I e i OJ ; <UI i='i l [ . . .  J 

72 
Thinking Arabic translation 
[ ... ] • J I,.,.-J I ef I. A fairly literal translation of this would be 'the past 
with all its extremely hot bloodshed'. This does not work in English, and 
although a factor in this failure may be that the phrase sounds over-dramatic, 
a toned-down version works no better, e.g. 'The past with al its hot bloodshed'. 
The failure of these proposed translations has to do partly with the fact that 
'hot bloodshed' is not a standard collocation in English. However, collocational 
failure is made worse by the existence of the phrase 'hot-blooded' meaning 
'short-tempered', 'easily angered'; i.e. 'hot bloodshed' involves a collocational 
clash with 'hot-blooded'. A more plausible translation of this phrase is 
something like: '[ . .. ] the past with all its terrible bloodshed [ .. .]' (cf. Ives 
1999: 14). We shall consider this example further from the perspective of 
metaphor (Ch. 1 1.3.4). 
Collocative meaning can also be an aid to the translator, allowing him or 
her to make use of collocations in the IT which are appropriate to the 
denotative meaning of the ST, but which might otherwise seem odd on the 
11.. An example from the Syrian poet}ħ Jlj.:. is the following: 
This has been translated (Rolph 1995: 10) as: 
I carry this scorched era in my eyes 
Here, 'scorched era' sounds more acceptable than other more literal alternatives 
because of the existence of the phrase 'scorched earth'. The denotative meaning 
of 'scorched earth' gives 'scorched era' a collocative meaning which is strongly 
suggestive of the devastation wrought by war. We shall return to this example 
in Ch. 8.2. 1. 
6.7 REFLECTED MEANING 
Reflected meaning is the meaning given to an expression over and above 
the denotative meaning which it has in that context by the fact that it also 
calls to mind another meaning of the same word or phrase. Thus, if someone 
says, 'Richard Nixon was a rat', using 'rat' in the sense of 'a person who 
deserts his friends or associates' (Collins English Dictionary), the word 'rat' 
not only carries this particular denotative meaning, but also conjures up the 
more basic denotative meaning of the animal 'rat'. (Note also the standard 
collocation 'dirty rat'.) 
Reflected meaning is normally a function of polysemy, i.e. the existence 
of two or more denotative meanings in a single word. The simplest forms of 
reflected meaning are when a single word has two or more senses, and its use 
in a particular context in one of its senses conjures up at least one of its other 

Connotative meaning and translation issues 
73 
senses, as in the example 'rat' above. A similar example in Arabic is calling 
someone J' In colloquial Arabic, J applied to a person means 'stupid'. 
However, this metaphorical meaning also very strongly calls to mind the 
more basic sense of J 'donkey'. 
Reflected meanings do not usually occur spontaneously to the listener or 
reader. When an expression is taken in isolation, its reflected meaning or 
meanings are usually merely latent It is the textual context that triggers these 
latent reflected meanings. A good example of context triggering reflected 
meaning is the possible translation (discussed nrst in § 6.3 under associative 
meaning) of r J-f-l l t • 0 '" "t 8 El.b..i.J I ..L..!.  as 'then pulling the covers 
over her old body'. The reader has, in fact, learnt earlier in the book that the 
mother of the central character ૶L... is old. The statement that her body is 
old, therefore, does not provide any information in this context. In order to 
extract some meaning, or more technically to fmd some relevance (cf. Sperber 
and Wilson 1986), for this comment, the reader therefore looks for another 
interpretation of 'old' in this context One possible interpretation which presents 
itself is that based on another sense of 'old', viz 'former'. That is to say, 
'old' is polysemous, having senses 'not new' and 'former', amongst other 
senses. Thus, the interpretation 'former body' (i.e. not the one which the lady 
is incarnated in now) momentarily presents itself as a possibility. This is, of 
course, rejected in the context. However, this reflected meaning of 'old' has 
enough of an influence here, in combination with the oddity of 'old' in the 
sense of 'not new' (discussed above), to make the reader feel that 'old' is 
odd in this context. 
Although the six types of connotative meaning which we have discussed 
above are distinct from one another, it often happens that two or more occur 
together and nourish each other, as illustrated by the examples of r.,rA and 
'blood and body'. In acquiring a translation method, it is useful to learn to 
distinguish exactly which sorts of connotative meaning are in play. It is also 
important to remember that, as with denotative meaning, being receptive to 
connotative meaning is a matter of considering words and phrases within the 
particular context in which they occur. It is not the same as looking up every 
possible use of a word in the dictionary and assuming that they are all 
relevant in the particular context in question. 
6.8 OTHER TYPES OF CONNOTATIVE MEANING 
The six types of connotative meaning which we have discussed above are the 
most important forms of connotative meaning. However, strictly speaking, 
one may regard any form of meaning which is not denotative as connotative. 
In this book, we consider three major additional types of connotative meaning. 
These are emphasis, presentation of information as predictable or unpredictable, 

74 
Thinking Arabic translation 
and presentation of information as foregrounded or backgrounded. 
Predictability and unpredictability are typically a function of the formal 
properties of theme and rheme, while foregrounding and backgrounding 
are a typically a function of the formal features of mainness and subordination; 
al these features will be dealt with in Chapter 9. 
Emphasis may be a function of a number of formal features in Arabic, 
including semantic repetition (Ch. 5.2), parallelism (Ch. 5.2.1), alliteration, 
assonance and rhyme (Ch. 7.2.1), morphological repetition of all kinds (Ch. 
8.2.3), the use of emphatic intonation in speech, or an exclamation mark in 
writing (Ch. 9.2.1), thematic preposing (Ch. 9.3.2.2), rhetorical ana ph ora 
(Ch. 10.2.1), and metaphor (Ch. 1 1). Emphasis may also be conveyed by the 
use of emphatic particles. An example in English is 'so' (as in 'That was so 
amusing! '). In Arabic, independent pronouns (l.:al , ::":'1. ,J-A, ೑ etc.) may 
also convey emphasis (cf. the example of ೒1 in Cn. 9.2.1). 
One could go on adding indefinitely to the forms of connotative meaning. 
For example, an utterance 'Do you want to do the washing up?' uttered in a 
context where this was clearly a request to do the washing up, could be said 
to have the connotative meaning 'Do the washing up'. An ironic utterance 
'What beautiful weather!' uttered in the context of foul driving rain could be 
said to have the connotative meaning 'What horrible weather!', etc. The 
types of connotative meanings we have picked out in §§ 6.2-6.7 and in the 
previous paragraphs of this section are, however, the most important for 
translation purposes. These are therefore the ones which students should 
concentrate on.

Introduction to the 
formal properties of 
texts 
We have suggested that translation is most usefully taken not as a matter of 
replicating an ST in the TL, but as a challenge to reduce translation loss. The 
threat of loss is most obvious when the translator confronts general issues of 
cultural transfer like those discussed in Chapter 3. However, many issues of 
cultural transfer arise not from extra-linguistic cultural sources, but from 
intra-linguistic sources, and specifically the demonstrable formal properties 
of the ST. These properties actually present a threat of greater translation 
loss than the more obvious one posed by the general question of cultural 
transfer. 
We have already seen an aspect of this in respect of semantic repetition 
(Ch. 5.2). Repetition in Arabic of words with similar meaning in close proximity 
can be used for emphasis or semantic precision. Frequently, however, it has 
no more than a marginally decorative purpose. Other forms of repetition, 
such as pattern repetition, root repetition, and lexical item repetition (Ch. 
8), are similarly sometimes used for only marginal decorative effect. These 
various formal features result in a general cultural tendency, in some kinds of 
texts at least, for Arabic to be more wordy than English. 
Another example where demonstrable formal linguistic features can give 
rise to problems of cultural transfer is provided by the traditional i \ .! ." '9 
type of poem. The i \ .! 
. a '9 is a feature of Arabic culture, and one that in 
many ways has no correspondence with any form of poetry in English. 
However, it is at least partially defined by features of versification, i.e. formal 
features on the prosodic level, which are quite different from features of 
versification in English poetry. 
There are doubtless technical philosophical problems in establishing what 
the demonstrable properties of texts are, but these problems are not our 

78 
Thinking Arabic translation 
concern in this course. What matters for us is the fact that meanings and 
effects triggered by a text must originate from features objectively present in 
it. This is why the translator has to look at the text as a linguistic object. 
In assessing the formal properties of texts, it is helpful to borrow some 
fundamental notions from linguistics. Linguistics offers a hierarchically 
ordered series of discrete levels on which the formal properties of texts can 
be discussed in a systematic way. These levels complement each other, of 
course. That is, although it is essential to distinguish between them when 
analysing texts, they do not actually function separately from one another: 
textual features on a given level always have their effect in terms of features 
on all other levels. 
It is obvious that in any text there are many points at which it could have 
been different. Where there is one sound there could have been another 
(compare 'road tolls' and 'toad rolls'). Or where there is a question mark 
there might have been an exclamation mark (compare 'What rubbish?' with 
'What rubbish!'). Or where there is an allusion to the Bible there might have 
been an allusion to Shakespeare. All these points of detail where a text could 
have been different - that is, where it could have been another text - are 
what we shall call textual variables. These textual variables are what the 
series of levels defined in linguistics make it possible to identify. 
Taking the levels one at a time has two main advantages. First, looking at 
textual variables on a series of isolated levels makes it possible to see which 
are important in the ST and which are less important. As we have seen, all 
ST features inevitably fall prey to translation loss in some respect or other. 
For example, even if the IT conveys the denotative meaning (Ch. 5) exactly, 
there will at the very least be phonic loss (Ch. 7), and very likely also loss in 
terms of connotations (Ch. 6), register (Ch. 12), and so on. It is therefore 
excellent translation strategy to decide in broad terms which category or 
categories of textual variable are indispensable in a given ST, and which can 
be ignored. To show what we mean by 'broad terms', we can take a simple 
example on the sentential level of textual variables. If a particular text 
contains complex sentences, the translator can scan on the sentential level 
and decide whether this stylistic feature has a significant function. If it does 
not, then the strategic decision will probably be that keeping the complexity 
in the IT is less important than producing a clear, idiomatic IT in the kind 
of style expected of TL texts of that particular type. In a literary ST, on the 
other hand, complex sentence-structure may be crucial to textual effects: in 
that case, the strategic decision on the sentential level might well be to create 
similar effects through complex sentences in the IT, and to be prepared to 
sacrifice details on other levels which, in this ST, have lower priority. 
The other advantage in scanning the text level by level is that a IT can be 
assessed by isolating and comparing the formal variables of ST and IT. The 
translator or editor is thus able to see precisely what textual variables of the 
ST are absent from the IT, and vice versa. This makes the assessment of

79 
translation loss less impressionistic, which in tum penn its a more self-aware 
and methodical way of reducing it 
We suggest six levels of textual variables, hierarchically arranged, in the 
sense that each level is built on top of the preceding one. Thus, we can think 
of the phonidgraphic level as being at the bottom of the hierarchy, followed 
further up by the prosodic level, the grammatical level, the sentential level, 
the discourse level, and at the very top the intertextuaJ level These features 
constitute the fonnal matrix, which is part of the overall schema of textual 
matrices, represented at the end of the Introduction to this book. Note that 
the representation there places the elements of the fonnal matrix in the reverse 
order to the hierarchy as we have just outlined it: thus, the phonic/graphic 
level is represented at the top and the intertextual level at the bottom, etc. 
This is because the representation of the schema of textual matrices in the 
Introduction typically presents elements in the order in which they occur in 
the book (as discussed in the Introduction itself), not according to any more 
abstractly conceived overall hierarchy. 
Using the tenn 'hierarchy' here is not meant to imply that features on a 
'higher' level are by definition more important than those on a 'lower' level: 
the variables only have their effect in tenns of one another, and their relative 
importance varies from text to text or even utterance to utterance. Other 
categories and hierarchies could have been adopted: we have chosen this 
hierarchy because of its practicability, not for its coherence in abstract linguistic 
terms. We shall progress 'bottom up', from phonic detail to intertextual 
considerations. We have chosen this order simply because we have found 
that students are more comfortable with this than with a 'top down' approach. 
In Chapters 7-10, we shall work our way up through the levels, showing 
what kinds of textual variable can be found on each, and how they may 
function in a text. This method does not imply a plodding or piecemeal 
approach to translation: applying the matrix analysis quickly becomes 
automatic and very effective. 

7 
Phonic/graphic and 
prosodic issues in 
translation 
7.1 THE PHONIC/GRAPHIC LEVEL 
Although they are the 'lowest' in the hierarchy, the phonic/graphic and prosodic 
levels of textual variables demand as much attention as any other - even if 
the considered decision proves to be that they are not important enough in a 
given ST to be allowed to influence translation choice. 
Taking a text on the phonic/graphic level means looking at it as a sequence 
of sound-segments (or phonemes), or as a sequence of letters (or graphemes), 
or as both. Oral texts are normally only looked at in phonic terms. Written 
texts are always first encountered on the graphic level, but they may need to 
be looked at in phonic terms as well - in fact, from a translation point of 
view, they are more often considered phonically than graphically. Although 
phonemes and graphemes are different things, we shall normally refer to the 
'phonic/graphic level', whether the text in question is an oral one or a written 
one. 
Language is nothing without the sounds of the utterances we hear, or the 
shape on the page of those we read: every text is a phonic/graphic configuration. 
These configurations are restricted by the conventions of the language the 
text is couched in. This is why, the occasional coincidence apart, no IT can 
reproduce exactly the same sequence of sound-segmentslletters as any ST. 
This always and automatically constitutes a source of translation loss. The 
real question for the translator, however, is whether this loss matters at all. 
The answer, as usual, is that it all depends. 
Generally, we take little or no notice of the sounds or shapes of what we 
hear and read, paying attention primarily to the message of the utterance. We 
do tend to notice sounds that are accidentally repeated, but even then we 

Phonidgraphic and prosodic issues in translation 
8 1  
attach little importance to them in most texts, especially i n  written ones. 
Often, however, repetition of sounds is a significant factor, so it is useful to 
have precise terms in which to analyse them. 
7.1.1 Alliteration, assonance, and rhyme 
Repetition of sounds can generally be classified either as alliteration or as 
assonance. There are various current definitions of these terms. For this 
course, we shall define alliteration as the recurrence of the same sound or 
sound-cluster at the beginning of words, as in 'two tired toads' or 'all aWful 
ornithologists'. We define assonance as the recurrence, within words, of the 
same sound or sound-cluster, as in 'a great day 's painting', or 'a swift 
snifter afterwards'. The two often occur together, of course, as in 'French 
influence also explains Frederick II's splendid castles in the South of Italy 
and Sicily '. Terminal sounds that are not rhymes are best defined as assonance; 
the five [z] sounds in the following are most simply described as assonance: 
'jazzy photos of animals in zoos'. A vital point to remember is that, as all 
these examples show, it is the sound, not the spelling, that counts in discussing 
alliteration and assonance. Even in Arabic, where the correspondence between 
graphemes and phonemes is much closer than in English and therefore this is 
not generally such an issue, the translator has to be aware whether a letter 
such as . is to be pronounced as 'a' or as 'at' in a particular context. 
In general, the more technical or purely informative the text, the less 
account translators take of sound patterns, because they hardly ever seem to 
have any thematic or expressive function. That is true of the sentence about 
Frederick's castles, and it is true of the following sentence from a text on 
coalmining: 'Testwork has been carried out on screenbowl centrifuges 
dewatering froth-floated coal.' The alliteration and assonance in these two 
examples are incidental to the message. 
However, many texts are marked by the deliberate use of phonic patterns 
for expressive purposes. The less purely factual the text, the more this tends 
to be the case. The most obvious example is poetry, where various types and 
degree of rhyme are found, as well as alliteration and assonance. We shall 
say that two words rhyme where the last stressed vowel, and all the sounds 
that follow it, are identical and occur in the same order, as in 'bream / seem', 
'Warwick / euphoric', 'incidentally / mentally'. So, in the mining example, 
'screenbowl' and 'coal' are at best imperfect rhymes, because 'coal' is stressed 
but 'bowl' is not. However, as regards phonic effects, the only difference 
between poetry and many other genres is one of degree: alliteration, assonance 
and even rhyme are often exploited in fiction, drama, journalism, polemic, 
and so on. 
What are the implications of these observations for translators? As always, 
the translator must be guided by the purpose of the text, the needs of the 

82 
Thinking Arabic translation 
target public and, above all, the function of the phonic feature in its context. 
In general, the sorts of feature we have been looking at will not have expressive 
function in a scientific, technical or other purely informative text, so the 
translator can happily ignore them. Even in the mining example the considerable 
loss on the phonic/graphic level will simply not matter. 
Sometimes, of course, even if the ST contains no marked phonic features, 
a draft IT will inadvertently contain a distracting concentration of sounds. In 
general, the translator will want to avoid introducing tongue-twisters or other 
phonic effects that impair the IT's communicative function. 
In this light consider the following: 
& I  'I .l-e e;o i '? 0  ಼L.i.:a u- ಽlLJl '-:! n jj i.".! 01$ 
[ . . .  J ಾtV";' 
Brown ( 1996: 13) translates this as: 
He used to study the reality behind the contradictions of the City of 
Oppression where he grew up. 
C; 0 -, '? 0 'society' has not been translated; including 'society' would have 
resulted in something like 'He used to study the reality behind the contradictions 
of the society of the City of Oppression where he grew up'. Here the phrase 
'contradictions of the society of the City of Oppression' with its multiple 
alliterations and assonances is particularly difficult to pronounce. 
The use of phonic echoes and afinities for thematic and expressive purposes 
is sometimes called sound-symbolism. It takes two main forms. In the context, 
the sounds of given words may evoke other words that are not present in the 
text. Or the sound of a given word occurs in one or more others, and sets up 
a link between the words, conferring on each of them connotations of the 
other(s). The first two lines of Keats's 'To Autumn' offer simple examples 
of both: 
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, 
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun; [ ... ] 
(Keats 1958: 273) 
The context is crucial. Given the title of the poem and the reference to 
fruitfulness, 'mellow' is almost certain to evoke 'yellow', a colour of fruit 
and autumn leaves. In its tum, the 'sun' is likely to be a rich yellow, glowing 
like a ripe fruit through the autumn haze. These two effects ensure that the 
'mists' are received positively by the readernistener, and not as cold, damp, 
and grey. The alliteration in 'mists ... mellow ... maturing' reinforces the 
effect, and also gives 'maturing' an intransitive sense as well as its transitive 
one: the sun itself is growing mature as the year advances. Further, if the sun 

Phonidgraphic and prosodic issues in translation 
83 
is maturing (whether in the year or in the day), it may well be low in the sky; 
if so, it looks extra big when seen through the mist, like a swelling fruit. The 
[m] in 'bosom' links this word, too, with the other three; so the mellow fruits 
are perhaps reminiscent of milk-filled breasts, as if season, sun and earth are 
affectionately uniting in maternal bountifulness. This suggestion is itself 
reinforced by the alliteration and assonance in 'fruitfulness ... friend', and by 
the alliteration and assonance on [s] throughout the two lines, which associates 
all these key words still more closely with one another. 
Not many translators earn their livings translating poetry, of course. But 
in respect of sound-symbolism - as of many other things - poetry offers 
extremely clear examples of vital factors which all translators do need to 
bear in mind. The Keats example is useful for this very reason. Practically 
none of the images and associations we saw in those two lines derive from 
denotative meaning alone - that is why perceiving and reacting to sound­
symbolism is bound to be subjective. All of them are reinforced, and some 
are actually created, by phonic features. Yet those phonic features are 
objectively present in the text. This points to the first factor that needs to be 
remembered: unlike many other sorts of symbols, those in 'sound-symbolism' 
do not have a single unchanging meaning. In fact, none of the phonic features 
in the lines from Keats has any intrinsic meaning or expressive power at all. 
Such expressiveness as they have derives from the context - and that is the 
second vital factor. In a different context, the same features would almost 
certainly have a different effect. The sounds of the words have their effect in 
terms of the denotative and connotative meanings of the words. So, without 
the title, 'mellow' might very well not evoke 'yellow'. Neither is there anything 
intrinsically mellow, maternal or mature about the sound [m]: the smell in a 
pig-yard might be described as 'the mingling miasmata from the slime and 
muck'. And, in [fr] , there is as much frightful frumpishness as there is 
fruitfulness and friendship. 
In other words, translators confronted with sound-symbolism have to decide 
what its function is before they start translating. The aim will be to convey as 
much of the ST message as possible. If it is essential to this message that the 
IT convey sound-symbolism, it is almost certain that the 1L sounds involved 
will be diferent from the ST ones: trying to reproduce phonic effects and 
affiliations in the IT usually entails far too great a loss in respect of denotative 
and connotative meaning. The translator's question therefore has to be: is 
what matters the specific sounds in the ST's alliteration, assonance, etc., or is 
it rather the fact that there is alliteration, assonance, etc? Fortunately, the 
latter is usually the case, and it is usually possible to compensate for the loss 
of given ST phonic details by replacing them with TL ones that have a 
comparable effect. Consider the following: 

84 
Thinking Arabic translation 
This has been translated (Brown 1996: 21) as: 
Their conversation was that of the wounded, who were tormented by 
their wounds and worn out by exhaustion. 
Here the Arabic makes use of various kinds of repetition (cf. Ch. 8) to 
achieve a sense of emphasis, stressing the degree to which the people concerned 
were ground down by their afflictions. The English translation compensates 
in kind and in place by the use of alliteration ('wounded', 'wounds' and 
'worn'), and assonance (,wounded', 'tonnented', 'wounds', 'worn', 'out' 
and 'exhaustion'), to give a similar sense of emphasis. 
Similar remarks apply to rhyme. There can be no hard and fast rule 
regarding rhyme in translation. Each IT requires its own strategy. Often, 
producing a rhyming IT means an unacceptable sacrifice of denotative and 
connotative meaning. With some sorts of ST (especially comic or sarcastic 
ones), where the precise nuances of meaning are less important than the 
phonic mockery, it is often easier, and even desirable, to stock the IT with 
rhymes and echoes that are different from those of the ST, but just as obtrusive, 
and to similar effect. Some genres of writing in Arabic also make use of 
rhyme, and particularly of ı or 'rhymed prose' (cf. Ch. 10.3.1) in contexts 
where rhyme would be highly inappropriate in English. Consider the following: 
This has been translated (Brown 1996: 13) as: 
It was not in his power to smother the fire in his heart with indifference 
or, by listening, to disguise his grimace. 
The Arabic contains a double rhyme, ٘ - ಻ and "I 
.0 ;.G@ ­
"l.i....w:.H'-:a (it also involves parallelism;Ch. 5.2.[; and pattern repetition, Ch. 
8.2.3.1). The rhyme here is obviously deliberate in the Arabic; in fact the 
writer employs rhyme at various points in the book, particularly in 'poetic' 
contexts which reflect the inner life of the central character .>-;'L.-. In the 
context of an English novel, however, such rhyme would seem highly 
inappropriate and probably comic. The translator has accordingly ignored the 
rhyme in her translation. 

Phonidgraphic and prosodic issues in translation 
85 
7.1.2 Onomatopoeia 
The only time when a translator is likely to want to try replicating ST sounds 
is when they are onomatopoeic. Onomatopoeia must not be confused with 
alliteration and assonance. An onomatopoeia is a word whose phonic form 
imitates a sound - 'splosh', 'bang', 'cuckoo', etc. 
Standard Arabic has a fair number of words which can be regarded as 
onomatopoeic; colloquial dialects probably have more. Perhaps the most 
obvious cases in Standard Arabic are doubled and reduplicative verbs 
(reduplicative verbs being quadriliteral verbs in which the third and fourth 
radical repeat the first and second radical). Examples of doubled verbs are: 
$ , 
• 
'" 
ಹ 'to crack, pop; to clack, smack, flap'; Ƭ 'to chirp; to creak (door); to 
. ' 
squeak, screech; to grate, scratch; to gnash, chatter (teeth)'; JJ 'to knock, 
rap, bang (on the door)'. Examples of onomatopoeic reduplicative verbs are: 
ٓ 'to crack, snap, rattle, clatter, chug, pop, crash'; ٕٔ 'to let out a 
piercing cry, scream shrilly'; Įįİ, 'to buzz, hum; to drone; to hum softly, 
croon (a song); to murmur' ; r' . "" 'to say "hmm"; to mumble, mutter; to 
grumble; to growl, snarl; to hum, buzz, drone' (all definitions from Wehr). 
There are often marked linguistic discrepancies in onomatopoeia as between 
different languages. Thus, the fact that a word in one language is imitative of 
a particular sound does not necessarily mean that a word in another language 
which imitates the same sound will be particularly similar phonically to the 
word in the first language. Thus, although ::'Ĩ sounds rather like 'drone', it 
does not sound anything like its most normal translation equivalents 'hum' 
and 'buzz'. Similarly, the fact that an onomatopoeic word exists in one 
language to describe a particular sound does not necessarily mean that a 
similarly onomatopoeic word will exist in another language. Thus, 'snore' is 
hardly onomatopoeic in English, whereas ٖٗ is obviously so in Arabic. 
Finally, while onomatopoeic words in different languages are often in some 
sense similar in terms of meaning, the rĩn&e, of meaning which they have 
will very often differ significantly (e.g. r' . "" 'to say "hmm"; to mumble, 
mutter; to grumble; to growl, snarl; to hum, buzz, drone'). 
Because of the differences in onomatopoeia between languages, care may 
be needed in translating an ST onomatopoeia, particularly when it has a 
thematic or expressive function. Frequently, the safest approach may be to 
translate the ST onomatopoeia with something other than a IT onomatopoeia, 
with or without some form of compensation. A case in point is the short 
story by CJJ! §ŵ entitled (.SI (.S¨I W, which deals with the nature of 
extreme pain, both physical and -psychological. LSI (.SI is an onomatopoeic 
expression in Egyptian Arabic, rather similar to 'oucfi' in English. However, 
'The Language of Ouch' sounds rather too difficult to interpret in English to 
be a viable story title, perhaps because 'ouch' in English is typically used as 
an interjection. It is also too weak for this context. A stronger alternative, 
such as 'Aargh', is also unviable, because it is even less like a standard

English word than 'ouch'. Given this, it seems better to translate(,Si (,SYI W 
by something fairly bland, but comprehensible, such as 'The Language of 
Pain', albeit that there is fairly significant translation loss in terms of 
expressiveness. 
7.2 THE PROSODIC LEVEL 
On the prosodic level, utterances count as 'metrically' structured stretches. 
'Metric' here covers three sorts of things. First, in a given utterance, some 
syllables will conventionally always be accented more than others; on top of 
their standard accentuation, voice stress and emphasis will be used for greater 
clarity and expressiveness. Second, clarity and expressiveness also depend 
on variations in vowel pitch and voice modulation. And third, the speed of 
vocal delivery also varies, for similar reasons. On the prosodic level, therefore, 
groups of syllables may form contrastive patterns (for example, short, fast, 
staccato sections alternating with long, slow, smooth ones), or recurrent ones 
or both. 
For the translator, there are four factors to be borne in mind when considering 
the prosodic level. The first factor is that Arabic and English are quite different 
from one another on the prosodic level, having very different tempi, rhythms 
and melodic undulations. It is virtually impossible to produce a IT that both 
sounds natural and reproduces the prosodic characteristics of the ST. Just 
occasionally, it is worth aiming for similar rhythms in the IT to those of the 
ST. For instance, if part of the ST's expressive effect stems from imitative 
rhythms - galloping horses, breaking waves, dripping water, etc. - there 
would be significant translation loss on the prosodic level if the IT failed to 
use similar rhythms to similar effect. 
However, prosodic translation loss far more commonly arises from a failure 
to heed one or more of the other three factors. The first of these - i.e. the 
second factor overall - is the nature and function of intonation and stress. 
This is relatively straightforward in the case of oral texts. Even in written 
texts, either the grammatical structure or the context will usually show what 
the intonation should be when the text is read out loud, and what its 
communicative purpose is. Consider the following from the short story 
JI by the Iraqi writer  I ૮  I ૭. A young man has 
just met a young woman in a hotel: 
ST

IT (adapted from Tunnic1ife 1994: 12) 
'Have you checked in?', she asked. 
He shook his head and said, 'Almost'. 
'Did you ask for a room with a bathroom?' 
'Yes,' 
'Good. Give me the number; my room hasn't got one'. 
And then she added: 'I get fed up with the dirt'. 
As a spoken text, this dialogue displays quite subtle variations in intonation 
and stress; it is worth reading the IT out loud to appreciate these. Consider, 
in particular, the likely intonation of 'Almost', and the young woman's rather 
suggestive 'I get fed up with the dirt'. Subtle as these issues of intonation 
and stress are, however, they are fairly naturally 'read in' by competent 
speakers, and therefore do not normally present grave translation problems. 
The translator's job - and this is the third factor - is to select a written form 
which suggests an intonation and a stress pattern which ensure that the IT 
sentence has the same communicative purpose as its ST counterpart. In this 
text by ವ."J I, for example, one might perhaps choose to translate the 
young woman's final statement ٌٍ َُ I ,  not as 'I get fed up with 
the dirt', but as 'You see, I get ted up with the dirt'. The addition of 'You 
see' explains the relationship between the statement 'I get fed up with the 
dirt' and the previous statements 'Give me the number; my room hasn't got 
one' (etc.), and ensures that the intonation pattern which is read in is likely to 
be appropriate. 
The fourth factor is that even where the TL expression does not seem 
grammatically or prosodically problematic, the translator must be sure not to 
introduce prosodic features that are inappropriate to the message content. 
Perhaps the commonest cases of translation loss on the prosodic level arise 
when a grammatical choice in the IT implies a stress pattern and an intonation 
that lead the readerllistener to expect a different sort of message from the one 
that actually materializes. This often happens when the translator chooses an 
inappropriate connective. 
A good example of this is the following, from the Egyptian magazine 
Petroleum (Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation 1999: W, 7), which is 
the final sentence of an article lauding the achievements of the Egyptian oil 
industry over the past eighteen years:

IT (adapted) 
No doubt, the achievements of the petroleum sector during the past 18 
years represent a triumph for the workers i n  this sector, and reflect the 
policies and efforts which have been pursued during this period. 
In the Arabic ST, the phrase ಲ do!. U l- signals that the final sentence of 
the article is intended to summarize the information previously given in the 
article. This is why there is no doubt about what is to follow in this sentence. 
In English, however, sentences beginning 'no doubt' often have an intonation 
pattern which rises at the end of the sentence. This typically signals that the 
following sentence will contain a contrast or contradiction to the information 
given in the sentence in question. The effect of this in the TT is to signal that 
the lack of doubt about the achievements (etc.) of the petroleum sector is 
likely to be contrasted in the subsequent sentence, this subsequent sentence 
perhaps beginning with a contrastive conjunctive element. such as 'however'. 
Thus, one might imagine the English TT carrying on along the following 
lines: 
No doubt, the achievements of the petroleum sector during the past 18 
years represent a triumph for the workers in this sector, and reflect the 
policies and efforts which have been pursued during this period. However, 
this does not obviate the need for future rationalization within the industry. 
This sense of subsequent contrast is certainly not intended in the Arabic ST. 
The English IT could be improved by replacing the negative 'no doubt' 
with something more positive, and less open to a contrastive interpretation. 
Thus (with some additional changes): 
When we consider the achievements of the petroleum sector during the 
past 18 years, it is clear that they represent a triumph for the workers in 
this sector, and reflect the policies and efforts which have been pursued 
during this period. 
7.2.1 Rudiments of English and Arabic versification 
A special set of features on the prosodic level are those found in verse, which 
present specific translation challenges. What follows is a short introduction 

Phonidgraphic and prosodic issues in translation 
89 
to the rudiments of English and Arabic versification. Our aim is to give 
students a foundation for discerning and interpreting the conventional patterns 
in English and Arabic verse, and for making an informed decision between 
English metres if the strategic decision is to produce a verse IT. We shall 
focus on the metrical side of versification - that is, the distribution of stressed 
and unstressed syllables. This ignores tempi and melodic pitch, which are 
vital prosodic textual variables and which do, of course, require as much 
attention in preparing to translate verse as they do for prose. We shall not 
consider other aspects of verse, such as types of stanza or the phonic questions 
of rhyme. For fuller information on these and on metrical questions, see 
Hollander 1981 and Stoetzer 1998 (vol. 2: 619-21). 
7.2.1.1 English 
English metre is syllable-and-stress metre. The line is defined in terms of 
feet. A foot is a conventional group of stressed and/or unstressed syllables in 
a particular order. A line of traditional verse consists of a fixed number of 
particular feet. For example: 
The curlfew tolls/ the kneW of par/ting day/ 
This line has five feet; that is, it is a pentameter. In this particular case, the 
feet have one unstressed followed by one stressed syllable. This is known as 
an iamb, or iambic foot. A line consisting of five iambs is an iambic pentameter. 
It is the most common English line, found in the work of great playwrights 
and poets. The commonest other feet are: 
trochee (adj. trochaic): 
dactyl 
(adj. dactylic): 
anapest (adj. anapestic): 
When the! pie was! opened/ 
Merrilyl chatting and/ clattering! 
And made ci/der inside/her inside/ 
Most poems do not have a regular beat throughout. This would be intolerably 
dreary. Even limericks are very rarely exclusively anapestic. The opening 
lines of Keats's 'To Autumn' (§ 7. 1.1) are examples of typical variations on 
the basic iambic pentameter. These lines still count as iambic pentameters, 
because they do have five feet, they are predominantly iambic, and the rest 
of the poem has these qualities. 
One other sort of English metre is worth mentioning, strong-stress metre. 
This is different from syllable-and-stress metre, in that only the stresses 
count in describing the line, the number of weak syllables being variable. 
Much modern verse uses this metre, often in combination with syllable-and­
stress metre.

Thinking Arabic translation 
7.2.1.2 Arabic 
Like the English metrical line. the line in Arabic is defined in terms of feet. 
However. while English metre involves both syllable and stress. Arabic metre 
is based entirely around syllable-type. The basic distinction is between short 
syllables (consonant + short vowel) and long syllables (consonant + long 
vowel. or consonant + short vowel + consonant). All Arabic syllables are 
treated as beginning with a consonant. Accordingly. there is no ambiguity 
. , 
about where one syllable ends and another begins. Thus in the word iJ. the 
first syllable is da and the second syllable is mun. Vowels at the end of the 
hemistich or line are always scanned long, irrespective of their quantity in 
prose. 
Feet consist of varying numbers of syllables (most commonly three or 
four syllables), combinations of these feet making up a particular metre. A 
large number of metres are recognized in classical Arabic poetry. Compositions 
are normally in a single metre. However. the fact that metres permit a degree 
of variation in the syllable types used to constitute their feet means that there 
is normally a degree of rhythmic variation within an individual composition. 
In some metres, double short syllables within one line typically alternate 
with one long syllable in other line, while in others a long syllable in one line 
alternates with a short syllable in another. 
Most classical poems are of the iƞ form, a iƞ having a variable 
number of lines (Չ, pI. ..:JL...1), normally not more than one hundred. 
Lin« can have up t; thirty syllab"ل divided into two hemistichs <t:r.:-.-. or 
ي). The first half of the line is called the J ..40  'chest' (also J.J'J I ಯ I 
'the first half'), and the second the ૬ 'rump' (also ėL:J I ರ I 'the 
second half). These are separated by a gap in the text which is somewhat 
longer than that which standardly occurs between words. The number of 
syllables per line is variable in some metres and fixed in others. A single 
rhyme, sometimes termed a monorhyme, occurs at the end of every line. 
First lines Ĭ, pI. tlLh...) often have rhyming hemistichs. 
As an illustration of the operation of traditional Arabic prosody, we shall 
take the first two lines from a poem by هL..!J I it-¥ I, the founder of the 
4UL!. School of Law (Ɵl.o).

The metre is a variation o f  the فIJ metre form, termed by Stoetzer (1998: 
621) wafir-l. Vsing V to represent a short syllable, - to represent a long 
syllable, LJl to represent either one long or two short syllables, I to 
represent a foot division, and I I to represent a hemistich division, the basic

Since the second half of the twentieth century, many Arab poets have 
used free verse, abandoning the fixed patterns of the classical verse forms. 
The basic unit of free verse is the single foot (4 I ,  • ·i :,), this being either a 
type of foot used in older poetry, or a close derivative. 
7.2.2 Translating Arabic verse 
The translator of a verse text always has to ask what the function of the ST 
verse is. Is it decorative? Does it have thematic and/or expressive effect? 
What is the effect of its regularity or irregularity? And, of course, similar 

92 
Thinking Arabic translation 
questions have to be asked on the phonic/graphic level. 
In terms of the choice of an overall IT form for verse translation, issues 
of appropriateness and practicability are extremely important. In terms of 
appropriateness, we will consider the issues of rhyme and stanza form, since 
these are fairly clear-cut. The monorhyme of the traditional Arabic + \ .: ,0 e, 
for example, is quite alien to the traditional rhyming patterns of English. 
Translators of an Arabic +ಬ who decide to use rhyme in their translation 
are therefore faced with a choice. Either they use an Arabic-type monorhyme, 
and thereby produce a rather exotic-sounding translation. Or they use a rhyming 
pattern which is more typical of English, but involves significant translation 
loss on the phonic level. 
The same is true of the division of the poem into stanzas. As we have 
seen, the Arabic + ,  .: 
.0 e is written as a single block, without any stanza 
divisions (although there are also traditional Arabic verse forms such as the 
Ĩĩ which make use of stanzas). Some English poems are written in 
continuous blocks of many lines, but this is by no means a predominant 
form. Again, the translator is faced with a choice; either to retain the overall 
single-block form of the ST, or to substitute a perhaps more natural-looking 
IT stanza form. 
Appropriateness often has to be balanced against practicality. A translator 
might, for example, consider that the ideal translation of a particular Arabic 
+ \ .: ,0 '9 would be into an English IT utilizing rhyming iambic pentameters 
in four-line stanzas. But these constraints are bound to result in significant 
translation loss. For example, it may not be possible under such circumstances 
to relay in the IT features on the phonic level of the ST (e.g. alliteration, 
assonance) which may be just as important as features of metre and rhyme. It 
may also prove necessary to make dramatic changes to denotative meaning 
in order to make the IT fit the desired verse form. Under such circumstances, 
it may be preferable to translate the +ಭ into free verse, or into a form of 
prose which maintains at least some prosodic and phonic features typical of 
poetry. It may also be possible to compensate for some of the loss of metrical 
and rhyming features by careful use of vocabulary which belongs to an 
obviously poetic register, or which has particularly appropriate connotations 
in the context in which it is used.

This ST is a piece of Islamic religious poetry by ಫL.!J I ŶJJ! '-H ૫ 
(767-820 A.D.), the founder of the Sunni ಪL!. School of Law (ƟL). 
The metre of this poem has already been discussed in § 7.2. 1 .2. The ST is 
popular at least partly because of the accessibility of its language, and posters 
of it can be found on the walls of shops and restaurants in Yemen (and 
possibly other Arab countries). It can be regarded as reflecting a 'stoical' 
attitude to life which is typical of mainstream Sunni Islam.

Granunatical issues in 
translation 
8.1 INTRODUCTION 
We have seen in Chapter 7 that the alliteration and assonance of 'Season of 
mists and mellow fruitfulness' trigger effects over and above the denotative 
meaning of this phrase. We were considering the alliteration and assonance 
as features on the phonic/graphic level. But, like all utterances, this one can 
also be considered on the other five levels of textual variables. The extra 
meanings, for instance, are the semantic correlates of features on the 
grammatical level, while part of the effect of Keats' s  phrase derives from 
features on the sentential level. We will consider the grammatical level in the 
present chapter and the sentential level in Chapter 9. 
8.2 THE GRAMMATICAL LEVEL 
On the grammatical level are considered two things: (1) morphology (adj. 
morphological): i.e. words and their formation by affixation, inflection, 
derivation and compounding; (2) syntax (adj. syntactic): i.e. the arrangement 
of words into phrases and sentences. It is the grammatical level where translation 
loss is generally most immediately obvious. This is very clear in examples 
which we have seen in previous chapters, many of which show the need for 
some degree of grammatical transposition. Because loss on this level is so 
common, we shall only give a few examples here. As ever, the question is 
not whether there is translation loss (there always is), but what it consists in 
and whether it matters. 

Grammatical issues in translation 
97 
8.2.1 Words 
We are all familiar with dictionaries. They are indispensable for anyone 
concerned with language, because they list the practical totality of the words 
in a given language. This totality is known as the lexis of a language (adj. 
lexical). But it is vital to remember that meanings are not found exclusively 
in the words listed individually in the dictionary. Any text shows that the 
combination of words creates meanings that they do not have in isolation, 
and even meanings that are not wholly predictable from the senses of the 
words combined. 
In translation, lexical loss is very common, but it is just one kind of 
translation loss among many. It can occur for all sorts of reasons. It very 
often arises from the fact that exact synonymy between ST words and TL 
words is relatively rare. The word r-:J, for example, might be considered an 
exact synonym of English 'meat'. For many Arabs, however, chicken may 
not count as r-:J, and fish almost certainly will not. This phenomenon is even 
clearer in some dialects than it is in Standard Arabic. In Sudan, for example, 
W is only used in speaking to refer to a language which is regularly used in 
writing. English and Arabic, therefore, both qualify as W. Languages which 
are not normally written, by contrast, are normally referred to as ಍. This 
means that Sudanese colloquial Arabic, and a language such as Dinka (spoken 
by perhaps two million people in southern Sudan) are both classified as 
4 ? 6 I. (Another term !lsed in Sudan specifically for'unwritten languages 
other than Arabic is J ') Thus, W in Sudanese Arabic is not a synonym 
of 'language' in English; nor is 4 ? 6 I a synonym of English 'dialect' (as 
might be thought if one only considered 4 
, 
6 I in relation to Sudanese 
colloquial Arabic). 
Another common source of lexical translation loss is the fact that, in any 
text, words acquire associative overtones on top of their denotative meaning. 
We have seen a good example in the lines from Keats, where alliteration and 
assonance were extremely important for the effects of the text. Another 
example is a line from the Syrian poet ಏಐ J 1..;..:., which reads ಎi 
Ն  J&I 'jJ I (cf. Ch. 6.6). This has been translated (Rolph 1995: 
fa) as fl carry this scorched era in my eyes'. Here a more literal translation 
of JJ ., , 
., e.g. 'burnt', 'burnt up', 'flaming' , 'fiery' ,  would sound odd. 
'Scorched' ,  however, sounds much more acceptable in this context, mainly 
because the phrase 'scorched era' echoes the military phrase 'scorched earth'. 
8.2.2 Grammatical arrangement 
Lexical issues are a particular category of grammatical issue, so it is not 
surprising that some of them are most conveniently examined under the 
heading of grammatical arrangement. Under this heading, we subsume two 

98 
Thinking Arabic translation 
types of grammatical structure: (1) morphological patterns affecting individual 
words - affixation/inflection, compounding and derivation; (2) syntactic 
patterns, whereby words are linked to form more or less complex phrases 
and sentences. In both, what concerns the translator is the fact that the structural 
patterns differ from language to language. Even where apparent cross-linguistic 
similarities occur, they can be misleading. For example, although the accusative 
, 
suffix 1- is a recognized means of forming adverbs in Arabic, English more 
readily adds -ly to form adverbs than Arabic does I:'. 
Thus one fairly commonly finds certain adverbs in Arabic which translate 
, 
, 
simply as adverbs into,English, such ¥ I5 'much', 'often' (etc.), ಅ 
'little', 'infrequently', ಉ..r:i 'soon', ಈ..".... 'quickly'. It is more common, 
however, to find complex forms of various kinds in Arabic translated as 
English adverbs. Amongst other things, these may be prepositional phrases 
;.ಋ\j I ૝J¨I  'recently', إ ૜   'persistently', ¬..>-"'" ؤ 
'quickly' (of walking), ;'بJ ة 'slowly' (of walking), ૞..>-'" :i 7' • I .' 
'cheerfully' (of speaking). They may also be cognate accusatives (absolute 
. 
, 
accusatives) 1..>-- .ئ ا 'he wept bitterly'; and they may also be 
circumstantial clauses (JL.-clauses) ಧನ 01 0 !" i ! i LAಊ L.S:J 'her 
eyes twinkled happily' , 6 I ૠ..>-"'" LliJ I ..IJ 7 I --L.t:.....u 'he 
walked on stiffly and quickly'. Of course there are also occasions where an 
Arabic adverbial form is translated by something other than an English adverb; 
consider, for instance, the Arabic adverbial i 
.: < .:..>--1 in the following 
newspaper headline (from 89 I (,)"'.uJ 1, 6 September 1999) I.Sૡ,J rlŷ 
L,J-C.,I...o :i .L: ', 0 Ղ ""':'Ճ :I; 0,J o .  -, 0 J o4-1J,J olj,J 
ಌ..>-"i. This might be translated into English as 'Saddam, Uday, Barzan, 
Watban and Aziz branded war-crimes suspects by American-backed 
organization'. Such cases, however, are the exception rather than the rule. 
Compounding, too, differs from language to language. German is famously 
capable of long compounds, English somewhat less so. Arabic, like French 
and other Romance languages, is a more analytical language, and compounds 
are typically formed by the use of the genitive structur:; e.Ħ: ħ",.:. ಆಇ 
'bedroom', or by noun-adjective pairs such ..b....,J 'J I J 
.. I 'the Middle 
East'. Both of these structures can yield complications when combined with 
other elements. 
Thus in the complex genitive structure, • ..I.:!<I i.,.:J I U= >?, it is 
not clear (in the absence of case-ending markers in the text) whether the 
phrase means 'the new curtains of the bedroom' or 'the curtains of the new 
bedroom'. Arabic therefore frequently resorts to more complex phrases in 
order to avoid such ambiguities, for instance through the use of ..J; thus 
i.,.:J I U..,riJ ;'..I.:!@I AL.:...J I 'the new curtains of the bedroom' or (the new 
bedroom curtains'. These periphrastic structures in Arabic provide the 
Arabic>English translator with opportunities to find conciser, more tightly 
structured IT equivalents. 
Compound phrases using the genitive in Arabic can also be problematic 

Grammatical issues in translation 
99 
when a corresponding adjective is required. Thus, ಄ I rk is a calqued 
term for 'anthropology', alongside the cultural borrowing 78-,":,,J91. 
However, one cannot use ($ß to mean 'anthropological' in Arabic, in the 
same way as one can use c:,.:.:i to mean 'biological' (from ;:'Y I آ 
'biology'). This is because ($à already has an existing meaning of 'human' 
(as an adjective). Accordingly, in order to say 'anthropological' in Arabic, 
one either has to use the compound genitive noun ಃ I أ as itself part of 
some periphrastic phrase, or one has to use the adjective from the cultural 
borrowing 48-'":',J=i, i.e. <8-,":,,J=1. In the second case there are 
few difficulties for the translator into English; in the first there may be an 
opportunity for the translator to find conciser, more tightly structured 
equivalents. 
Grammatical differences are especially clear in differences in verb systems. 
The system of tenses of Arabic is quite different from English; ($á, for 
example, can standardly mean both 'buys' and 'is buying'. In some contexts, 
it might mean 'will buy' (although one would more commonly expect 
($,) i ,, .! ,, in this sense); and in other contexts, ($â might be most 
naturally translated as 'bought', or 'was buying' (e.g. in certain subordinate 
clauses, or in a story where a general past tense setting has already been 
established for a particular part of the text). English has a system of verb 
tenses in the proper sense; that is to say, particular tenses relate fairly 
consistently to natural time. Arabic, on the other hand, operates with a system 
that combines tense and aspect. Thus, the perfect can indicate completion of 
the action as well as occurrence in the past (as in ($ã I 'he bought'), while 
the imperfect may indicate non-completion of the action regardless of whether 
it occurs in the past or present (for example, in contexts where ($,) 
., 
/;, .! 
translates as 'is/was buying'). The actual time significance of the imperfect 
in particular is very often context-dependent. This is most clearly seen in 
subordinate clauses. In cases where the main clause has a perfect verb, 
dependent subordinate clauses will typically have imperfect verbs, the fact 
that the overall time reference is the past being signalled solely by the use of 
the perfect in the main clause (cf. Dickins and Watson 1999: 130-1). 
The use of the imperfect to express past time goes beyond subordinate 
clauses. It is possible to find the imperfect used in almost any situation in 
which the general time reference has already been established. Thus, in fictional 
writing in particular, an author may establish a general past reference by an 
initial use of a perfect verb, and then shift to the imperfect throughout the 
rest of the episode in question, only returning to the perfect in order to mark 
the start of a new episode in the story. This usage has something in common 
with the so-called 'vivid present' in English, which is sometimes used in 
story-telling contexts ('A man comes into a pub. He goes up to the bar, and 
he says to the landlord [ ... ]'). However, while the English vivid present is 
typically confined to informal or dramatic contexts, this use of the Arabic 
imperfect to relay narrative events in the past is common in formal Writing. 

1 00 
Thinking Arabic transLation 
The flexibility of Arabic tense usage may sometimes raise difficulties 
particularly in translating from Arabic to English. A good example is provided 
by the start of the text from ૛ jJ I Հ Ձ beginning i I ¥ 'i I ԿL:u (Ch. 7, 
Practical 7.2). 
As the discussion so far has suggested, translators give priority to the mot 
juste and to constructing idiomatic TL sentences, even where this entails 
translation loss in terms of grammatical structure or economy. Exceptions 
may be made where, for whatever reason, exoticism is required in the TT. 
More often, the ST may have salient textual properties manifestly resulting 
from the manipulation of grammatical structure. The marked manipulation of 
grammatical structure is a common feature in literary texts. The translator of 
such texts must always decide how distinctive the grammatical structures 
are, what their function is, and what the aim of the ST is. Only then can a 
decision be taken about how distinctive the TT's grammar should be. A 
common Arabic feature which poses this problem is morphological repetition. 
8.2.3 Morphological repetition 
The three forms of morphological repetition which are of most importance 
for translation, and which therefore concern us here are pattern repetition, 
root repetition and suffix repetition. 
8.2.3.1 Pattern repetition 
Pattern repetition involves repetition of the same pattern (ؠ, J.c.li, J;..L, 
ء, 4 I: 
';. 
'0 , etc.) in two or more words in close proximity, while root 
repetition involves repetition of the same root in two or more words in close 
proximity. Both pattern repetition and root repetition can be used to provide 
textual cohesion. However, more often they fulfil stylistic and other purposes. 
Pattern repetition is an extremely common feature of Arabic, and quite 
frequently occurs without having any particular stylistic significance; thus 
ಀ I Ɲ..w I ಁ I would be a reasonable, translation of 'the big old house' 
in many contexts, the repetition of the ౿ pattern in Ɲಂ and ƭ not 
necessarily having any particular significance. 
More important from a stylistic point of view is where pattern repetition 
is combined with some kind of semantic relationship. Here the general effect 
of pattern repetition is normally to give some additional emphasis. We can 
usefully distinguish three relevant types of semantic relationship: (i) 
semantically related words; (ii) synonyms or near-synonyms; (iii) antonyms. 
Semantically related words are words whose meanings fall within the 
same general semantic field, but which are clearly distinct in meaning. An 

Grammatical issues in translation 
101 
example is J/1 and r)l....1 'thoughts and dreams', and u..-J and L.૙ 
'amazement' and 'shock'. These do not generally pose translation problems 
and can often be translated fairly literally; thus ,-,N1J .J/l ؞ 'most 
of his thoughts and dreams' (Brown 1996: 23); L..!..A.J ..>-;Iඒ '. ''! . 01 
(,.૚ I" 'Saber had been amazed and shocked' (Brown 1996: 45). 
The translation of synonyms and near-synonyms with pattern repetition 
typically involves the same techniques as are used with repetition of synonyms 
generally (Ch. 5.2), i.e. merging, grammatical transposition, semantic 
distancing, and maintenance. 
An example of merging is ..:.O1 ..:.)1 _' • '!' ..:.౼ t-:') 'four pretty 
young women'. Another example is r I. ., I I" ,-;-,JL.':w I Ģ (j ġ " oL.S,J 
translated as '[ ... ] so he had no alternative left to him but education' (Brown 
1996: 19). 
An example of grammatical transposition is: 
This has been translated (Calderbank 1990: 20) as: 
This phenomenal success was achieved without any { systematic analysis} 
of issues, without extensive propaganda, or working with the masses and 
without any organized recruitment: to be reckoned a member it was 
simply enough for an individual to sympathize with the Society'S aim 
[ ... ] 
Here the noun-doublet J.! I .. 
i l l" J 
.! I,; ., -, I I  has been transposed 
grammatically into the English adjective-noun phrase 'systematic analysis' . 
• 
Semantic distancing is illustrated by a translation of Ģ I • .! I e U౾ 
t4J I" tj..-iJ I 'for fear of alarming and upsetting her' (Brown 1996: 38). 
Wehr gives tj.-.8 as meaning 'fear, fright, terror, alarm, dismay, anxiety, 
consternation, panic', and ؟ as meaning 'impatience, restlessness, 
uneasiness; burning anxiety; alarm, dismay'. The translator has chosen here 
to distance the meaning of tLA slightly further from t..>-A than is indicated by 
the dictionary defmitions, by interpreting tL- to mean 'upset'. She thus loses 
something in terms of denotative meaning. However, the resulting phrase 
'alarming and upsetting' is idiomatic and stylistically acceptable. 
An example of maintenance is the translation of a chapter title from a 
book about the role of the military in political life in the Arab world. The 
chapter is entitled J:.W" Ɯ౽ :<.SJ .! .! ;=J I 0 I J".J. This has been 
translated as 'The transformational role of the military: evaluation and analysis' 
(Humphrys 1999: 1). Here the meanings of the fairly standard English 

102 
Thinking Arabic translation 
translations of ౱౲ 'evaluation' and ౭ 'analysis' are felt to be 
sufficiently distinct from one another for it to be acceptable to maintain the 
ST structure in the IT. 
Pattern repetition with antonyms is also fairly common. Consider the 
following: 
u૗ ..:..:.LS UJ ..>-;:'-"IyI z.>G ..}A ':! jj : jj .. 1 1 {.>L.:J I uLS UJ

This has been translated (Calderbank 1 990: 9) as: 
Given that true history is the history of the masses, and that the 
relationship between the Egyptian ruling class and the masses has, in the 
vast majority of cases, been one of mutual suspicion, then an objective 
evaluation of the Society of the Muslim Brothers obliges us to trace the 
historical beginnings of the group's policies and consequently its position 
vis-a-vis popular issues on the one hand and the particular objectives of 
the ruling classes on the other. Such an evaluation would also oblige us 
to follow { the changing fortunes} of the Society in order to elucidate the 
mystery which surrounds the successive episodes in its history, beginning 
with episode one, which [ ... ] 
Here the translator has chosen an adjective-noun phrase 'changing fortunes' 
to relay the Arabic antonyms LԽJ l.b౳ (or, more accurately to relay 
the entire phrase { I)J {u'J-:I-A} 4hIJ ƛ.rU ..rJ I d : ', '> ',1 1 ). The 
obvious alternative to this would have been the phrase-'ups and downs'; this, 
however, sounds rather too informal for the context. 
Pattern repetition may also occur with a combination of synonyms and 
antonyms. An example is the following: 
u l-p¥ 1 (..S.r-    I  ૔ rL..¥ 1  uLS .J..i.j J [ . . .  J

Thus, Hassan EI Banna came to assume total control over the Muslim 
Brotherhood, adopting from Fascism the principle of absolute obedience 
to the leader, and thereby concentrating all power in himself. The oath 
which members of the Brotherhood swore to EI Banna, pledged 'total 
commitment, loyalty, trust and unswerving obedience, { in comfort and 
adversity, suffering and joy}'. This pledge was not, however, matched by 
any corresponding commitment on EI Banna's part 
Here the parallelism of the Arabic has been retained in the English, as one 
might expect with formulaic religious language (cf. also Ch. 10.3.2). 
8.2.3.2 Root repetition 
Root repetition involves repetition of the same morphological root in close 
proximity within a text (thus I.>"J"u I 1.l.A L.:.....,JJ 'we studied this lesson' 
involves repetition of the root I.>" J J). Root repetition may be divided into 
three kinds: (i) system-intrinsic, (ii) absolute accusative, and (iii) 'other' (cf. 
Dickins and Watson 1999: 5 14-18). 
System-intrinsic root repetition simply reflects the fact that words in Arabic 
are typically made up of roots along with patterns, etc. and that general 
semantic considerations will sometimes cause a writer or speaker to use two 
words having the same root in close proximity. An example of this is ૐ 
؜؝ 'he wrote a book'. English generally avoids this kind of repetition. In 
practice, it is not normally difficult to find forms in translating into English 
which avoid it; in fact, even where English has similar forms, such as 'he 
drank a drink', there are often more common alternatives such as 'he had a 
drink' . 
Root repetition with the absolute accusative is used to form adverbials. 
This typically poses no serious translation problems in English. Thus, the 
phrase Ò,.,.. IJ.,J.u ̙.J I ..J̚ I i..r'U; -=.,.J.,J.u .w happily translates 
as 'The phenomenon of religious extremism has developed rapidly'. 
Sometimes, however, a more complex structure such as a prepositional phrase 
may be required. Here is an example: 
(̛J} L iPL.c c.UL..S: t-u-i l :i .! 91,, I I  I..>"J I ..u.  I 3l.A Q J  ...

offering well-defmed alternatives. They were unable to confront and resist 
these changes, or to justify and defend them. 
Finally, it may sometimes be necessary to make more radical changes. Consider 
the following:

This has been translated (Calderbank 1990: 27) as: 
The third confrontation between the Guide and the Brothers occurred 
during the Palestine War of 1948. A large number of Brothers, many of 
them founder members, banded together under the leadership of Ahmed 
Rifaat against the political dealings of Hassan El Banna, accusing him of 
courting the favour of the Palace and of weakness in his support for the 
Palestinian people, restricting himself essentially to propagandizing. They 
demanded the adoption of well-defined policies both to challenge the 
government and to {provide real military assistance} to the Palestinians. 
Here the Arabic .્L.... (first occurrence) has been transposed grammatically 
into 'provide ... assistance', while the phrase :i 1 'i 1 'i '> .J4-:!- .ૌL..... is 
relayed by the adjectives 'real, military', used attributively with 'assistance'. 
The use of the absolute accusative in Arabic potentially gives a sense of 
emphasis (although there is no clear dividing line between the use of the 
absolute accusative simply to form an adverbial and its use to form an emphatic 
adverbial). Consider the following: 
1.J..t  Ը  ƇJL....:u { Iƈ} {..:...u} Ɖ I jlƊJ.r:J 1 0!

EI Sayyid and the second [ ... J 
Here the English translation has included an emphatic particle 'so', which 
seems to reflect the emphasis which is a function of the root repetition (note 
also, however, the use of౤J¢ in the Arabic, implying ever-increasing 
, 
speed, as contrasted with the more basic ౦>"" merely meaning 'quickly'). 
Elsewhere, other translation techniques may be used to give some degree 
of emphasis in the IT. Thus, in the translation of the phrase oL.-Ai t ؑؒ 
౥ \j I t I J",J I 'in order to bid his mother a final farewell' (Brown 1996: 55), 
the emphasis of the original root repetition has been relayed by the use of 
alliteration and assonance in the English Tmal farewell' (cp. the less successful 
'final adieu/goodbye'). 
Uses of root repetition which fall under the category of 'other' in general 
have a more obviously emphatic function. They occur in an unlimited range 
of grammatical structures. The following are a few examples: (i) subjecHverb, 
. . 
, 
as in b.;a£ J£ 'to fly into a rage' ; (ii) verb+object, as 4l-h ؐ 'to make a 
request' ; (iii) verb+prepositional phrase, as in ((S̍i) 4 ; : ,0: ؏ 'to 
transform' ;  (iv) conjoined nouns, as in j l¤ l" .ૃ 'honour and self­
esteem' ;  (v) noun+adjective, as in J.."J.kJ 1 J,kJ l literally 'shady shade'; (vi) 
genitives, as in ૂl.b.J I t L..bi 'the ambitions of the covetous' ; and (vii) 
conjoined adjectives, as in ے. ,;, i,,, II" "U....:.J I 'the weak and oppressed'. 
It is also possible to fmd root repetition in larger stretches of text Sometimes, 
this has a rhetorical function, rather like that of rhetorical anaphora with 
respect to lexical items; we shall consider this in Chapter 10. More often, 
root repetition over larger stretches of text functions not j ust as a stylistic 
feature, but as a text-building device, i.e. it contributes to the cohesion of the 
text. As such, it could be discussed in Chapter 10. For ease of exposition, 
however, we shall deal with it here, just as we shall deal with lexical item 
repetition and phrase repetition as text-building devices later in this chapter. 
The following provides a simple example of root repetition as a text-building 
device (the entities being spoken to here are " I̠ J̡i 'red trees'):

and whenever he spoke to them in an anguished voice, they started to 
sob. The conversation was that of the wounded who were tormented by 
their wounds and worn out by exhaustion. 
Here the Arabic has J"¥ in the first sentence (only partially quoted), and 
JI>-" in the second sentence. The English IT translates these as 'spoke to' 
and 'conversation' respectively. The tendency for Arabic to repeat but English 

106 
Thinking Arabic translation 
to vary parallels that which occurs with lexical item repetition and phrase 
repetition, as we shall see later. This text-building use of root repetition is 
also similar to the text-building use of lexical repetition in that the meanings 
involved are very similar: in this case J"ౡ and J I¬ express the same 
core meaning, J"ౢ in a verbal form, and J I¤ in a nominal form. 
Quite a few cases of root repetition in Arabic involve stock phrases. In 
such instances the English translation is likely to involve either an English 
stock phrase, or if no such stock phrase is available, another phrase which 
sounds natural in the context Examples where stock phrases are translated as 
stock phrases are c.౟."J I J.S ౠI" 'clearly visible', and ૘ġ (Sol (sJ 
'from the outset'. Where the Arabic root-repetition phrase involves a 
subject+verb, this is very likely to be an idiom, and is also likely to have a 
strong poetic/emphatic function. An example, involving b';:'­+";:'J®' is the 
following: 
This has been translated (Brown 1996: 50) as: 
nor had it flared up in rage. 
Here the English IT uses quite a common stock phrase, but one which also 
involves a fairly strong 'fire' metaphor to relay the emphasis of the Arabic 
ST. 
The emphasis, which as already noted is a typical feature of 'other' forms 
of root repetition in Arabic, can also be conveyed in other ways. An example, 
involving the idiom ౞ . . .  ¯, is provided by the following: 
[ • • •  ] 4.....L.:J I Ui ',0' • ,I,; .

This has been translated (Humphrys 1999: 5) as: 
the more this society in turn makes its mark upon this establishment. 
Here the English idiom 'make its mark' achieves a sense of emphasis through 
the use of alliteration and assonance. 
Even where the Arabic root repetition does not involve a stock phrase, the 
emphatic nature of such repetition will often make an English emphatic 
usage appropriate_ The following is an example of root repetition plus 
parallelism, where the translator has maintained the parallelism in English 
for the sake of emotional emphasis, and has also made use of assonance (root 
repetition elements have been picked out in curly brackets):

This has been translated (Calderbank 1990: 36) as: 
not simply for the purposes of academic research or to settle old accounts, 
or even to atone for our sins before a wailing wall, but to look ahead to 
Egypt's political future: all other considerations fade into insignificance 
when compared with the task society sets those writers who { suffer} { its 
afflictions} and {share} {its aspirations}. 
In this example, the assonance in the IT provides the same sort of emotive 
emphasis as is provided by the complex root repetition and parallelism in the 
ST. 
Metaphor is also a fairly frequent translation technique where the Arabic 
does not involve a stock phrase, just as it is when it does. Consider the 
following (in which the root repetition elements have been picked out in 
curly brackets): 
{ ... :.LS:TI} b.l.c  {UI}J V I I-4J WXYI Z I  ¥ƙ . . .

This has been translated (Calderbank 1990: 27) as: 
EI Banna refused to listen to the group and {crossed words } several 
times with Rifaat. These exchanges always ended up with more support 
for Rifaat and eventually, faced with Rifaat's complete control of the 
General Headquarters [ ... ] 
Here the translator has attempted to reproduce the striking nature of the 
Arabic, by using a novel English metaphorical phrase 'cross words', which 
echoes the existing English phrase 'cross swords'. 
Of course, there will be occasions where the root repetition in Arabic 
serves an obviously emphatic function, but where it seems better not to try to 
relay this in English. An example is the following: 
b]} ^I  ౚWJ I •. ""iS:.: '<r_'J I 4.L:.i / ` I aJ

This has been translated (Humphrys 1999: 2-3) as:

108 
Thinking Arabic translation 
and self-esteem }  that border on arrogance. 
8.2.3.3 Suffix repetition 
Somewhat less important than pattern and root repetition, but still significant, 
is suffix repetition, that is repetition of the same suffix at the end of words 
in close proximity. The following extract, from an article in the Egyptian 
magazine §ಸ I j,JJ (Hetherington 1996: 10) which deals with political 
extremism in the Middle East, provides a simple example of suffix repetition. 
This might be translated as: 
the land of prophecies and divine messages, superstitions - and secret 
services. 
As this example shows, suffix repetition, like pattern repetition and root 
repetition, emerges from the grammatical structure of Arabic, in this case 
from the use of the suffix ..:.L as one of the means of forming the plural. 
Nonetheless, it still represents a deliberate choice on the part of the writer. 
Here, the writer has chosen to string together four plurals ending in ..:.L . 
Typically suffix repetition would seem to be an emphatic device used in 
more or less 'poetic' contexts. Very often it is better ignored in translating. 
Sometimes other means of emphasis may be adopted in the translation. In the 
above extract the four elements displaying suffix repetition in the ST have 
been split into groups in the IT, the first positive ('prophecies and divine 
messages') and the second negative ('superstitions - and secret services'). 
The two elements in the second group ('superstitions' and 'secret services') 
have then been further separated by a dash (allowing 'secret services' to 
function as what one might term the punch-phrase). 
The above extract also displays another means of relaying suffix repetition 
in the IT; the use of alliteration and assonance. In this case, there is alliteration 
and assonance particularly of [s] in the IT. (For further discussion of suffix 
repetition, see Dickins and Watson 1999: 520-1.) 
8.2.4 Lexical repetition 
Another common form of repetition in Arabic is the repetition of the same 
word or even of a whole phrase in a particular sense (cf. Dickins and Watson 
1999: 5 1 0-14). Repetition of a single word is termed word repetition or 
lexical item repetition, while repetition of a whole phrase is termed phrase

repetition. 
8.2.4.1 Lexical item repetition 
Here, for analysis and discussion in class, is an example of lexical item 
repetition in Arabic, typically translated with lexical variation in English. (In 
analysing lexical item repetition, Arabic plurals are to be regarded as the 
same lexical items as their corresponding singulars): 
This is translated (EI-Serafi 1994: 15) as: 
General media propaganda in these countries constantly emphasizes that 
the population problem is one of the most important impediments to 
development, claiming that economic progress will not be realized until 
the difficulty is resolved. 
This example of lexical item repetition occurs within a single sentence. 
However, it is also possible to have cases of lexical item repetition in Arabic 
extending over larger stretches of text, often where one lexical item in particular 
relates closely to the general topic of that particular section of text. In this 
case, lexical item repetition functions not just as a stylistic feature, but as a 
text-building device contributing to the cohesion of the text (as may root 
repetition under similar circumstances). As such, it could be discussed in 
Chapter 10. However, for ease of exposition we shall deal with it here. Here, 
for analysis and discussion in class, is an example followed by a draft English 
IT. This extract consists of one complete paragraph followed by the first few 
words of a second paragraph. This is significant, because the Arabic paragraph 
here, like typical English paragraphs, deals with a fairly self-contained sub-topic 
within the larger text. In this extract the word ..:.LAL.:;.:.1j bౙ I runs almost 
like a theme through the Arabic text. Note, as well, other forms of lexical 
item repetition, involving ( D (SJ1, K and ->.,...J;.. The text is taken from

Thinking Arabic translation 
This might be translated into English as follows: 
Intellectually, too, Egypt at the start of 1924 was subject to a series of 
interrelated but opposing currents. The Russian revolution of 1917 had 
promoted socialist thinking, while the Egyptian revolution of 1919 had 
encouraged ideas of pharaonic isolationism. Kemal Atarurk's abolition of 
the Caliphate and establishment of a secular state in Turkey in 1922 had 
similarly encouraged the growth of secularism. In addition the Egyptian 
University, which had been founded in 1909 with the purpose of educating 
'all the Egyptian people, regardless of nationality, creed or ethnic group', 
and played a leading role in the cultural and scientific development of the 
country, led to the appearance and growth of rationalist as opposed to 
religious interpretations of human and social problems. On the other 
hand, calls for the incorporation of Egypt into western or Mediterranean 
culture, which followed the absorption of foreign capital by various social 
groups (a phenomenon supported by the occupation authorities), were 
viewed by the average Egyptian as tantamount to the abandonment of all 
moral values. Similar results ensued from the encouragement given by 
the occupation authorities to Christian missionary groups in their efforts 
to break into Egyptian society and to convert Muslim Egyptians to 
Christianity, whether through sincere concern, or through deception and 
the exploitation of the poverty of the great majority of the population. 
These missionaries were at the forefront of a pro-Christian intellectual 
current; and though they were few in number, in the eyes of fundamentalist 
Muslims, they constituted a source of untold danger. 
In short, these various currents began to [ . .. J

Stylistic lexical-item repetition and 'text-building' lexical-item repetition 
of the types discussed in this section shade into one another. There is, however, 
also another function of lexical item repetition which is important in both 
English and Arabic. This is known as rhetorical anaphora. We shall deal with 
this in Chapter 10. 
8.2.4.2 Phrase repetition 
The above text illustrates not only repetition of individual lexical items, but 
also of whole phrases. This can be termed phrase repetition. Thus we find 
઼ D! ... (SJ1j ":'Jl four times (with other intervening elements). 
The following text, which is taken from an article in the Egyptian magazine 
...L..Ƙ 1 jJJ (no. 3521, 4 December 1995) about political extremism in the 
Middle East, provides a good example of phrase repetition. In this extract, 
the phrase rFl J is repeated four times. Just like ..:.'-"4=01/04=01 in the 
previous text, r41  J can here be regarded as a text-building device which 
contributes to the overall cohesion of the text. We have placed r41 ͭJ in

variation in phrases, while Arabic frequently prefers repetition.

Sentential issues in 
translation 
9.1 THE SENTENTIAL LEVEL 
We can use the lines from 'To Autumn' to show how different grammatical 
arrangements create different assumptions in the listener or reader as regards 
the communicative purpose of an utterance. Keats's own lines -
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, 
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun; [ ... J -
are partly an address to Autumn and partly an exclamation about it: the very 
structure of the utterance leads the listener/reader to expect an expression of 
wonderment and enthusiasm (as does the title, of course). A different 
grammatical arrangement, however, would most likely announce a different 
communicative purpose. For instance: 
Autumn is a season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. 
It is' a close bosom-friend of the maturing sun. 
This structure, despite the title, announces a more purely informative text -
even though, in the event, phonic and lexical features do give the utterances 
something more than simply informative value. We can say that, in each 
version, the grammatical arrangement marks the utterances as having a 
particular communicative purpose, whatever overtones may turn out to be 
involved. When, as here, one looks at the communicative purpose of a given 
grammatical arrangement in its own right, one is looking at the utterance on 
the sentential level. On this level are considered sentences. 
We define a sentence as a complete, self-contained and ready-made vehicle 
for communication: nothing needs to be added before it can be uttered and 
understood in concrete situations. The starter's one-word command 'Go!' is 

1 14 
Thinking Arabic translation 
a sentence. So is 'No way!' as an expression of refusal or disbelief, or 
'Good' in response to confirmation that a room has a bath. 
We should note here that, although this chapter deals with sentential 
issues in translation, it is often impossible both in translation and in linguistic 
analysis to consider one sentence in isolation from other surrounding sentences. 
Discussion at various points in the chapter will therefore sometimes go beyond 
the level of the single sentence, with the intention, however, of explicating 
features at the level of the individual sentence. 
9.2 TEXTUAL VARIABLES ON THE SENTENTIAL LEVEL 
From the point of view of ArabiclEnglish translation, there are three major 
non-syntactic features of the sentence, which we shall consider in turn in 
subsequent sections of this chapter. These are: (i) prosodic features, such as 
intonation or stress; (ii) theme and rheme; that is, the presentation of information 
as more or less predictable typically through the choice of a particular sequential 
order of elements within the sentence; (iii) foregrounding and backgrounding; 
that is, the presentation of information as more or less important for the 
overall development of the text. 
9.2.1 Prosodic features 
In spoken texts, a number of different sentences, marked for different purposes, 
can be created purely through intonation and stress - even though they comprise 
the same words, in exactly the same order. Compare the following in English: 
The salt. 
The salt? 
The salt! 
The salt! 
[with falling intonation: statement] 
[with rising intonation: question] 
[with fall-rise intonation: demand] 
[with high, level intonation: command] 
The same two words could be spoken in other ways to express encouragement 
(to pass the salt, etc.), warning (that the salt-pot is about to fall, etc.), and so 
on. 
As these examples suggest, the sentential level of spoken language is 
extremely rich, with fine shades of intonation distinguishing sentences with 
subtly different nuances. Stress can similarly be used in English to express 
different shades of meaning. English is able to stress words fairly freely in 
speech; e.g. the neutral 'I know that man', vs '[ know that man', vs 'I know 
that man', vs 'I know that man', vs 'I know that man'. Although stress is 
used in Arabic in this way, neither Standard Arabic nor the dialects exhibit 
the same freedom to shift stress within the sentence as English. To achieve 

Sentential issues in translation 
1 15 
similar effects, two other devices are available. Firstly, Arabic can shift word 
order fairly freely, e.g. o-iVl Ơ,.,J I dJ,j (or, more likely, uVl Ơ,.,J I dJ,j). 
Secondly, it can make use of additional elements. So, 'I know him' could be 
rendered as  uVl with the additional independent pronoun  at the end 
of the sentence. 
A lot of the features of the spoken sentential level simply disappear in 
written texts, because the sentential level in written language is relatively 
impoverished. Written English, of course, has punctuation marks. Most 
obviously, sentences are marked by a capital letter at the start of the first 
word, and a full stop, question mark, or exclamation mark at the end of the 
final word. These latter features identify the sentence in broad terms as a 
statement, a question or an order, etc. However, they do not allow for finer 
distinctions within these possibilities. Thus, it is not possible, for example, to 
distinguish in writing between 'The salt!' as a demand with fall-rise intonation, 
and 'The salt !' as a command with high, level intonation; nor between large 
numbers of other similar possibilities which are offered by the spoken language. 
Of the remaining punctuation uses in English, some carry specific meaning, 
and are obligatory where this meaning is intended. There is, for instance, a 
difference between 'My cousin who lives in Bristol visited us last week', and 
'My cousin, who lives in Bristol, visited us last week' .  In the first of these 
sentences, the relative clause 'who lives in Bristol' identifies which out of a 
number of possible cousins is intended. This is known as a defining (or 
restrictive) relative clause. In the second sentence, by contrast, the relative 
clause 'who lives in Bristol' merely provides further information about a 
cousin who is already assumed to be identified. This is known as a describing 
(or non-restrictive) relative clause. 
Other punctuation uses in English are subject to greater variation, the 
comma being a case in point. Thus, in some contexts, there will be very little 
difference in meaning between 'Last week my cousin visited us', and 'Last 
week, my cousin visited us'. In other contexts, however, the two sentences 
will not only sound different but have a quite different communicative impact. 
Punctuation in Arabic is even less systematic than punctuation in English. 
Traditionally, Arabic had no punctuation whatsoever; and one still occasionally 
comes across modern books without punctuation. Conversely, modern editions 
of Classical Arabic texts, which originally had no punctuation, often have 
punctuation added. Even where punctuation exists, the conventions for Arabic 
are far less standardized than those of English. There is obviously no equivalent 
of Latin-script capital letters in Arabic. Modem Arabic texts do typically 
make use of full stops. However, the orthographic sentence in Arabic, defined 
as a stretch of text ending in a full stop (and preceded by another full stop, if 
the sentence is not text-initial), is frequently much longer than the orthographic 
sentence in English. In English, the orthographic sentence typically corresponds 
directly to the spoken sentence. That is to say, if one were to read a written 
English sentence out loud, one would typically get a complete spoken sentence 

1 16 
Thinking Arabic translation 
with a complete intonation pattern. By contrast. in Arabic a single orthographic 
sentence fairly frequently does not correspond very happily to a single spoken 
sentence; read out loud, the single orthographic sentence would be likely to 
be split up into two or even more spoken sentences (Le. with two or more 
complete intonation patterns, each of these patterns marking off a separate 
sentence). 
Even where a single orthographic Arabic sentence can reasonably be 
regarded as corresponding to a single spoken Arabic sentence, Arabic sentences 
are often much longer than typical English ones, forcing the Arabic>English 
translator to find appropriate ways of adding additional sentence breaks in 
the IT. The frequent differences in length between Arabic and English 
sentences are one reason why discussion in this chapter must sometimes go 
beyond the level of the individual sentence. 
Other punctuation markers in Arabic, such as the comma, are used even 
less systematically than the full stop. It is also worth noting the acceptability, 
even in formal Arabic, of multiple question marks or exclamation marks, or 
even a combination of question mark(s) and exclamation mark(s), where the 
writer wants to convey strong emphasis. Such usages in English are confined 
to informal writing. 
Apart from the use of punctuation, the only ways of conveying intonation 
and stress in English writing are through typography. The most popular 
typographical device is italics, but capitals or bold typeface are also sometimes 
used. None of these devices is widely used in Arabic, and capitals do not 
exist. Sometimes, where punctuation and typography cannot give the desired 
nuance, the writer or translator has to fall back on adding explicit information 
about how the sentences are spoken, as in 'she exclaimed in surprise' , 'she 
said angrily', and so on. 
9.2.2 Theme and rheme 
The following is a brief account of the notions of theme and rheme with 
respect to English and Arabic, and is based on the ideas of a number of 
different authors and approaches. For a fuller description of the major 
approaches to this topic, see Baker (1992: 1 19-79). In relation to Arabic, cf. 
also Dickins and Watson (1999: 337-51, 377-87). 
The basic idea behind theme and rheme is that sentences can be divided 
up into some elements which provide at least relatively predictable information 
and others which provide at least relatively unpredictable information. The 
elements which provide at least relatively predictable information are known 
as the theme, while those elements which provide at least relatively 
unpredictable information are known as the rheme. Consider the following 
from a text on Ayatollah Khomeini (from Dickins and Watson 1999: 461): 

Sentential issues in translation 
1 17 
Ayatollah Khomeini was the son of a cleric. He was born in 1903 in the 
small town of Khomein in Isfahan province. 
In the second sentence here the infonnation given by 'He' is highly predictable, 
because 'Ayatollah Khomeini' (to whom 'He' also refers) has been mentioned 
in the previous sentence. 'He' accordingly identifies someone already known 
about in the text, and is the theme of this sentence. 'Was born in the small 
town of Khomein in Isfahan province' ,  by contrast, is unpredictable; the 
infonnation here is all new, and this element is accordingly the rheme. 
The first sentence in this extract is somewhat more interesting. Let us 
imagine the situation in which 'Ayatollah Khomeini was the son of a cleric' 
was the first sentence of this text. In this case, we can see that neither the 
element 'Ayatollah Khomeini' nor the element 'was the son of a cleric' is 
known before the sentence, and therefore neither is absolutely predictable. In 
this case, however, we may say that the author chooses to treat 'Ayatollah 
Khomeini' as relatively predictable and therefore thematizes it (i.e. makes it 
theme). There are two reasons for doing this. Firstly, it is fairly likely through 
their previous knowledge of the world that the readers of this text will know 
the name Ayatollah Khomeini but not know that he was the son of a cleric. 
Secondly, since the whole text is about Ayatollah Khomeini, we may say that 
the choice of 'Ayatollah Khomeini' as theme is justified by the subsequent 
development of the text; i.e. looked at globally 'Ayatollah Khomeini' or 
words such as 'He', when they refer to Ayatollah Khomeini, are going to be 
predictable elements throughout. 
Both the sentences 'Ayatollah Khomeini was the son of a cleric' and 'He 
was born in 1903 in the small town of Khomein in Isfahan province' illustrate 
a general tendency, which is true of Arabic as well as English, for theme to 
precede rheme. This can be regarded as a 'natural' order in that it mirrors the 
order of things in the real world; when we are trying to work out something 
new, we start with what is known and proceed from there to what is not 
known. 
9.2.2.1 Sentence stress 
In spoken English and Arabic, theme and rheme can be related to notions of 
stress. If you read the sentence 'Ayatollah Khomeini was the son of a cleric' 
out loud, you will hear that the sentence-stress falls on 'cleric' .  The general 
tendency in both Arabic and English is for stress to fall on a word in the 
rheme. 
This correlation between rheme and sentence stress can also be seen on 
the relatively rare occasions in English where rheme comes first in the sentence. 
Consider the following: 

1 18 
Thinking Arabic translation 
What happened to you? 
(a) I got stung by a be. 
(b) A be stung me. 
Response (a) follows the standard theme-first theme-rheme order, and the 
sentence-stress falls on 'be'. Response (b), however, has the reverse 'rheme­
theme' order; here again, however, sentence-stress falls on 'bee'. 
Where rheme precedes theme in English, as in 'A bee stung me' , the 
sentence tends to carry a certain emotional charge. It would be perfectly 
possible - in fact probably normal - to utter the sentence 'I got stung by a 
bee' in a matter-of-fact way. An utterance along the lines 'A bee stung me' , 
however, is much more associated with annoyance, or some other strong 
emotion. 
9.2.2.2 Emphatic preposing 
It is important to distinguish between initial rhemes, which involve sentence­
stress, and preposed emphatic elements. Consider the following sentence: 
In the early sixties Ayatollah Khomeini led the movement against the 
Shah of Iran's 'White Revolution'. 
This sentence is in fact the start of the next paragraph of the Ayatollah 
Khomeini text which we quoted from earlier. Here the main sentence-stress 
falls on 'Revolution', i.e. the end of the rheme. There is, however, a secondary 
stress (signalled by a rising pitch) which falls on 'sixties' ;  such secondary 
stress can be termed phrasal stress (or clausal stress in the case of a clause). 
In this sentence, 'In the early sixties' is clearly not the main theme. It can 
be termed a preposed emphatic theme. 'Preposed' with respect to English 
means 'placed before the subject' ; in English any element which is placed 
before the subject in a declarative sentence can be described as preposed. 
'Emphatic' means that there is some sense of 'picking out' the element for a 
special purpose; here the purpose is for linkage and contrast with a number 
of similarly preposed time-phrases in subsequent sentences. Later sentences 
in the same paragraph, for example, begin 'Following an agreement between 
Iran and Iraq' and 'On 2 February 1979'. 
Arabic, like English, makes use of preposed emphatic themes. In Arabic, 
however, anything which comes before the verb in a sentence which contains 
a verb may be a preposed emphatic theme. Thus in sentences which have the 
word order Subject-Verb-( etc.), the subject may be emphatic (cf. Dickins and 
Watson 1999: 337-5 1). It would also appear that in sentences which do not 
contain a main verb, the subject is optionally emphatic. We shall consider 
further issues relating to sentences having the word order Subject-Verb-( etc.} 
in the following section.

9.2.2.3 Basic theme-rheme translation issues 
In terms of Arabic>English translation the distinction between thematic and 
rhematic information is most problematic where it proves difficult or impossible 
to reproduce roughly the same word order in English as in the original 
Arabic. If the word order of the original Arabic can be roughly maintained in 
the English, this will often reproduce the original theme-rheme structure, 
because English and Arabic both have a tendency to start with the most 
thematic element and end with the most rhematic element. This general 
principle is illustrated by the following: 
U..H c.J-,",୨ ¥I IlA ఼J 
This bridge was built by Egyptian engineers 
Here, the Arabic and English structures seem rather different; the Arabic is 
active and the English passive. However, the same basic order of ideas is 
maintained in both - 'bridge' first and 'engineers' next. The only difference 
here is that Arabic has the verb ఻ right at the beginning, whereas English 
'was built' comes after the subject. In the case of English, however, it is in 
virtually all cases obligatory to have the verb after the subject in declarative 
sentences (in Arabic the verb may come first, or the subject). Word order in 
this respect is not therefore alterable for theme-rheme considerations. 
9.2.3 Foregrounding and backgrounding 
The term 'subordinate' in 'subordinate clause' or 'subordinate element' may 
be said to indicate a number of things. From a grammatical point of view a 
subordinate clause is subordinate in that it falls outside the main part of the 
sentence, and can only occur together with this main part. From an informational 
point of view, a subordinate clause may be said to be informationally 
subordinate. This can be shown from the passage about Ayatollah Khomeini, 
which we briefly discussed in § 9.2.2.2 (cf. Dickins and Watson 1999: 462). 
In the early sixties Ayatollah Khomeini led the movement against the 
Shah of Iran's 'White Revolution'. As a result, he was exiled in 1963, 
first to Turkey and then to the Islamic holy city of Najaf in Iraq. Following 
an agreement between Iraq and Iran he was expelled from Najaf and was 
forced to take up residence near Paris in the late seventies. On 2 February 
1979, after a short stay in France, he returned to Tehran until after the 
Islamic revolution on 1 1  February 1979. 
Notice how all the time phrases are subordinate, while the material carrying 
the main line of the story is in the main clauses. This is typical in English. 
Now compare the text with this alternative version, in which the time phrases 

120 
Thinking Arabic translation 
are made into the subject of the main clause: 
The early sixties was a period of leadership for Ayatollah Khomeini 
against the Shah of Iran's 'White Revolution'. As a result, 1963 saw him 
exiled first to Turkey and then to the Islamic holy city of Najaf in Iraq. 
The period following an agreement between Iraq and Iran involved his 
expulsion from Najaf, and the late seventies forced him to take up residence 
near Paris. The 2nd of February 1979, which was preceded by a short 
stay in France, witnessed Khomeini's return to Tehran; 1 1  February 1979, 
the date of the Islamic revolution, marked the end of this period. 
This version of the text is distinctly odd. One reason for this is that it 
consistently upgrades the time element from the subordinate, ancillary status 
which it had in the actual text, to a main status discoursally. While the ideas 
in the text tell us that it must be about Ayatollah Khomeini's life, the 
organization of these ideas suggests that the listed dates ought to be the topic 
of the text. 
Subordinate elements are sometimes said to convey background 
information, i.e. the kind of information which is not central to the overall 
topic of the text or section of text in question. Main clauses, by contrast, are 
said to convey foreground information, i.e. information which is central to 
the overall topic. This situation is well illustrated by the Khomeini text. 
The foregrounding-backgrounding distinction which is characteristic of 
subordination can be contrasted with the situation which obtains in cases of 
clausal coordination. Consider the following: 
1. Disputes break out and people tend to blame one another. 
2. When disputes break out, people tend to blame one another. 
Without any context, example 1 seems odd because the information that 
'disputes break out' is trivial. It is then coupled by the use of 'and' with the 
much more significant (i.e. worthy of foregrounding) information that people 
tend to blame one another. The implication of using 'and' to link these two 
pieces of information, however, is that they are of roughly equal significance 
to the overall topic of the text. There is a contradiction - or at least a tension 
- between the difference in the significance of the two pieces of information 
conveyed by the two clauses, and the implication in the use of 'and' that 
these two pieces of information are of at least roughly equal significance. 
This tension is resolved in example 2. 'When disputes break out' is here 
presented as relatively insignificant subordinate information, which simply 
provides background to the main point being made. 
In saying that the two clauses connected by a coordinating conjunction 
such as 'and' are of roughly equal significance to the overall topic of the text 
or text-section, we are not suggesting that one could reverse the order of the 
two clauses and retain the same meaning. Thus, there is a clear difference in 

Sentential issues in translation 
121 
meaning between 'Disputes break out and people tend to blame one other', 
and 'People tend to blame one other and disputes break out' . In the first case, 
the obvious interpretation of the sentence is that the disputes come first and 
lead to the blaming; in the second the blaming comes first and leads to 
disputes. 
Note also that 'Disputes break out and people tend to blame one another' 
is not intrinsically odd in English. All that is required to render it a perfectly 
reasonable utterance is a context in which 'Disputes break out' is made 
non-trivial by being linked to a specific time or place, as for example in: 'If 
the weather's bad or the order-book's not full, disputes break out and people 
tend to blame each other'. 
9.2.4 Interaction or theme-rheme and main-subordinate elements 
In the previous sections we have looked independently at theme and rheme 
elements, and main and subordinate elements. Elements from these two pairs 
can come together in four possible ways: 
Main-theme 
i.e. a theme which is a main clause, or part of a 
main clause 
Subordinate-theme 
i.e. a theme which is a subordinate element, or part 
of a subordinate element 
Main-rheme 
i.e. a rheme which is a main clause, or part of a 
main clause 
Subordinate-rheme i.e. a rheme which is a subordinate element or part 
of a subordinate element 
We would expect these elements to express the following kinds of information: 
Main-theme 
Subordinate-theme 
Main-rheme 
Subordinate-rheme 
predictable, foreground information 
predictable, background information 
unpredictable, foreground information 
unpredictable, background information 
We have already looked at some examples of main-theme and subordinate­
theme in the text on Ayatollah Khomeini. In this text, the element which is 
most clearly both main and theme and hence predictable and foregrounded is 
'Ayatollah Khomeini' in the first sentence, and 'he' in every other sentence. 
In the same text, the subordinate-themes are typically initial temporal 
phrases: thus 'In the early sixties', 'Following an agreement', 'On 2 February 
1979, after a short stay in France'. As noted (§ 9.2.2.2), such initial non-subject 
themes are also emphatic. 
Main-rhemes in both English and Arabic seem to fulfil the expectation 
that they express information which is both unpredictable and significant to 

122 
Thinking Arabic translation 
the overall topic of the text or section of text. 
The most interesting category in both English and Arabic is subordinate­
rhemes. The expectation is that these should convey information which is 
both backgrounded and relatively unpredictable. In many cases, this expectation 
is fulfilled in both English and Arabic. A good example from English is the 
following (Leith 1983: 13; cited in Sekine 1996: 78): 
In short, the Roman empire witnessed a process known to sociolinguistics 
as language shift. The evidence for this is that Latin formed the base of 
French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian { as they are spoken 
today } .  
Here, 'as they are spoken today' i s  relatively unpredictable; or at least what 
predictability it has is entirely dependent on the previous mention of the 
languages concerned. At the same time, it is also background information; it 
is included only to make plain that what are being referred to are the 
contemporary versions of French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian, 
not earlier versions of the same languages. However, this would probably be 
the interpretation reached by the reader even without the inclusion of 'as they 
are spoken today'. This phrase, therefore, is of little importance informationally, 
and it is noteworthy that the text in fact goes on subsequently to talk further 
about Latin, rather than pursuing issues related to the modem Romance 
languages. 
Sometimes, however, subordinate clauses in rheme position (i.e. towards 
the end of the phrase or sentence) convey foreground rather than background 
information. This tendency seems more pronounced in Arabic than in English. 
Consider the following from "U I" ) . .:J 1 by J-Ol.,:j a,.,.s:j: 
ǞI 1 ..Ai .{jl."J స ǟI Ǡ} ..:.4 I ..:.5 .:.J6

A fairly literal translation of this would be: 
The girls' laughter rose, { while Fawaz's rage exploded }. He stopped 
walking, turned around, stood feet apart, and stared at the four girls in 
anger and challenge. 
This translation seems slightly odd for a number of reasons. The aspect of 
this oddity which concerns us here, however, is the phrase 'while Fawaz's 
anger exploded' .  The fact that this is a subordinate clause coming after 'The 
girls' laughter rose', suggests that it should convey unpredictable but 
background information - and this is indeed what it does seem to convey. In 
the context, however, it would make better sense if the information conveyed 

Sentential issues in translation 
123 
were not only unpredictable, but also foregrounded. The reason for this is 
that Fawaz's explosion is an important feature of the text's development; as 
we can see from the following quoted lines, the text goes on immediately to 
describe Fawaz's behaviour as a result of his explosion of anger. 
An actual translation of this section (St John 1999: 32) reads: 
When he heard the girls' laughter, { Fawaz exploded with rage } .  He 
stopped, spun round, and stood, glaring furiously at the four young women. 
Ignoring other differences between this IT and the more literal IT proposed 
earlier (since these are not relevant to the current discussion), we can see that 
the translator has reversed the subordination structure of the phrase ..:.JlL:..i 
j I". ఴ వ 1 ΁ ..:.L.:a.:J 1 ..:.Ĝ. The main Arabic clause ..:.JlLU 
..:.L.:a.:J 1 ..:.Ĝ has been converted into an English subordinate clause (with 
some other changes) 'When he heard the girls' laughter', while the subordinate 
clause jl΂ ΃ ΄I has been converted into an English main clause 
(also with some other changes) 'Fawaz exploded with rage'. One effect of 
this is to foreground the information conveyed by 'Fawaz exploded with 
rage', and thus produce a more natural-sounding rendering than that of the 
more literal translation. 
Reversal of the subordination structure is a fairly common strategy for 
dealing with cases in which rhematic subordinate clauses in Arabic convey 
foreground information. A second regular strategy is to translate the Arabic 
rhematic subordinate clause as a separate sentence in English. This strategy 
is illustrated by the following from Calderbank (1990: 23): 
iW 1 ඈඉ Yඊ 1 યW 1 c,΅ 'J r • -, • : .' b : $Ά·'J 1 c,Έ U,J

This could be translated as follows: 
Since the strong by their very nature did not accept blind obedience to 
the Supreme Guide the venerable Hasan El Banna, and indeed, actively 
attempted to question some of his judgements, he termed them 'malicious', 
and went so far as to expel them from the Brotherhood. { As a result} the 
only remaining members of El Banna's inner circle were those whose 
extreme weakness meant that they were unable to oppose him. {These 
people } he called 'the trustworthy'. 
Here the two subordinate clauses introduced by ''''': .. : and R.:J 1 .)--A Y 1 in 
Arabic are relayed by separate sentences in English.

Thinking Arabic translation 
9.2.5 Translation of Arabic coordinated clauses 
Often the translation into English of Arabic sentences involving the 
coordinating conjunctions ,J and ...i - and less commonly Č - present no 
problem; ,J, for example, is sometimes translatable as 'and'. Where it begins 
a sentence in Arabic, it will typically have no correspondent in English; and 
where ,J occurs as a coordinating conjunction in a long Arabic sentence, it 
may be appropriate in English to make two sentences. otherwise omitting 
any equivalent of ,J. 
Sometimes, however. Arabic coordinating conjunctions present more of a 
translation problem. Consider the following. which is taken from the start of 
the novel Đ.>J 1 ԰Ա by the Sudanese writer cJ2 đ 1 (cJ2 n.d.: 
1 1): 
Ē,J ...i,J,ra-l1 .".. 1.lA ,ēĮ.Jl. L.:-=JI OJI.' i i ".: 9 Jl.i.bYI .u 
J,JI ,ĔJ'iJ oఱ v=a)IJ 1 3L...:J IJ 4...01  ĕ IJ 'Ė.>J I 01 (.SJ>:

. 
. ts...w. ėI , £J'i l  ԯ L. 
This might be translated as: 
When children are born, they greet life with a scream; this is well known. 
However, according to his mother and the women who attended his birth. 
as soon as Zein came into the world he burst out laughing. 
Here, Arabic uses the coordinating conjunction ...i to link the two phrases 
Jl.i.bYI .u and Ęę4 ĚI OJ!.' i i ".:. Given that coordinating 
conjunctions typically present the information given by the relevant clauses 
as equally foregrounded, one might have expected the translation to read 
something like: 'Children are born, and they greet life with a scream '. This. 
however, sounds somewhat odd in English, just as a sentence 'Disputes 
break out, and people tend to blame one another' can sound odd. The reason 
in both cases is that the structure accords too major a status to the information 
given in the first clause, i.e. it makes the first clause too foregrounded. Thus, 
in the case of this example, the notion that children are born is obvious. 
(Indeed, one would probably only want to use this formulation in the TT if 
the author were deliberately inviting the reader to re-examine the notion that 
children are born, and accord to it fresh significance. This is not the case 
here.) A more natural effect is achieved in the English by subordinating the 
phrase 'children are born', by introducing it with the subordinating conjunction 
'When'.

Discourse and intertextual 
issues in translation 
10.1 INTRODUCTION 
In the last chapter, we briefly discussed a grammatical rearrangement of the 
two lines from 'To Autumn': 
Autumn is a season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. 
It is a close bosom-friend of the maturing sun. 
We saw that, on the sentential level, this arrangement marks the text as 
informative, rather than an expression of excitement Now, part of this sentential 
effect derives from the pronoun 'It', which explicitly links the second sentence 
to the first as conveying additional information about Autumn. Such linking 
of one sentence to another is the most significant feature found on the discourse 
level. 
10.2 THE DISCOURSE LEVEL 
The textual variables considered on the discourse level are those that distinguish 
a cohesive and coherent textual flow from a random sequence of unrelated 
utterances. Strictly speaking, this level is concerned with intersentential 
relations (relations between sentences) and with relations between larger 
units, such as paragraphs, stanzas, chapters, and so on. For our purposes, 
however, it is sometimes useful also to consider relations between parts of 
sentences on the discourse level (and particularly clauses), as if the parts 
were sentences in their own right. This is particularly important with respect 
to Arabic; as we have already seen (Ch. 9.2. 1), Arabic sentences are often 
extremely long, and the lack of consistent punctuation in much modem Arabic 

128 
Thinking Arabic translation 
writing (as well as its total lack in classical writing) also often make it 
impossible to detennine unambiguously where one sentence ends in Arabic 
and another begins. (For a very useful discussion of these and other issues 
relating to cohesion and translation, se Baker 1992: 180-260.) 
We shall consider some examples involving relations between parts of 
sentences rather than whole sentences below. However, our main focus will 
be on intersentential issues, because these are what most clearly illustrate 
translation issues on the discourse level. 
There is necessarily some overlap between the subject matter of Chapter 9 
and the subject matter of this chapter. In practical tenns, this does not matter. 
The crucial issue from the point of view of translation analysis is not that one 
assigns a particular feature to one of the two levels, but rather that the overall 
theoretical framework allows for the feature in question to be dealt with 
somewhere. 
10.2.1 Cohesion and coherence 
It is useful to distinguish between two aspects of discourse: cohesion and 
coherence. Following Halliday and Hasan (1976), we define cohesion as the 
transparent linking of sentences (and larger sections of text) by explicit 
discourse connectives like 'then', 'so' , 'however' ,  and so on. These act as 
signposts pointing out the thread of discourse running through the text. 
Additionally, features such as root repetition and lexical item repetition may 
have a cohesive function (as discussed in Ch. 8.2.3.2, 8.2.4. 1), as may theme­
rheme elements and main-subordinate elements (Chapter 9). 
Coherence is a more difficult matter than cohesion, because, by definition, 
it is not explicitly marked in a text: it is a tacit, but discernible, thematic or 
emotional development running through the text. Consequently, all cohesive 
texts are coherent, but not all coherent texts are cohesive. We can illustrate 
the difference with a simple example. 
I was getting hungry. I went downstairs. I knew the kitchen was on the 
ground floor. I was pretty sure the kitchen must be on the ground floor. I 
didn't expect to find the kitchen so easily. I made myself a sandwich. 
I was getting hungry. So I went downstairs. Well ... I knew the kitchen 
was on the ground floor. I mean, I was pretty sure it must be there. Still, I 
didn't expect to find it so easily. Anyway, I made myself a sandwich. 
The first text is devoid of intersentential connectives. It is, however, coherent, 
thanks to the underlying chronological narrative structure. In the second text, 
a train of thought is restored by inserting connectives (printed in italics). 
These act as cohesion markers, setting up a transparent intersentential structure. 
Some of the cohesion markers link the sentences by explaining or commenting 

Discourse and intertextual issues in translation 
129 
on the speaker's actions: 'So', 'I mean', 'Still', 'Anyway'. Others are instances 
of grammatical aoaphora - that is, the replacement of previously used 
words and phrases by expressions referring back to them; here, the anaphoric 
elements are 'it' (replacing 'the kitchen') and 'there' (replacing 'on the ground 
floor'). 
As this example suggests, the sentential and discourse levels are by definition 
closely related. Many of the intersentential connectives also function on the 
sentential level; rather like sentence tags, they give each utterance a particular 
tone and tell the listener how to take it - 'So', 'Well', 'I mean', 'Still', 
'Anyway'. Compare, for example, the two versions of the second sentence: 
'I went downstairs' vs 'So 1 went downstairs'. These will almost certainly be 
spoken differently, because on the sentential level they have different functions: 
the first announces a new fact out of the blue, while in the second, 'So' 
marks the sentence as expressing a response to a situation. 'So' therefore has 
both a sentential and an intersentential function here. 
Furthermore, many connectives can be used to join short sentences together 
to make longer ones. Conjunctions such as 'so', 'and' or 'but' are simple 
examples. This is another way in which intersentential and sentential functions 
are often close in practice, even though they are distinguishable in analysis. 
For instance, 'I was getting hungry, so 1 went downstairs' will probably have 
a different communicative impact from 'I was getting hungry. So 1 went 
downstairs' . 
Similarly, rhetorical anaphora - that is, the repetition of a word or words 
in successive or closely associated clauses or phrases for a rhetorical purpose 
- can have a discourse function even where it occurs within a single sentence. 
In the case of English, such lexical repetition normally has a rhetorical purpose. 
However, as we saw in Chapter 8, repetition of words, phrases and even 
roots in Arabic may have two other functions: (i) it may allow the writer to 
talk about closely related ideas, serving in this case much the same purpose 
as lexical variation does in English; (ii) it may serve a cohesive 'text-building' 
function, in much the same way as connectives do. However, just like English, 
Arabic also uses lexical repetition for rhetorical purposes, the most obvious 
such purpose being to achieve a sense of emotional force. 
Just as repetition is denser in Arabic than in English in non-rhetorical 
contexts, so we should expect it also to be denser in contexts where it is used 
for purposes of rhetorical anaphora. In this light, consider the following from 
a speech by QL:J I ù J4 entitled .."..J I 78 L:..:.l.is: (Dickson

The following is an attempt at an idiomatic translation: 
Arab nationalism is not Garnal Abd al-Nasser, it is not Shukri al-Quwatli, 
it is not any particular leader. It is stronger than all of this. It is you my 
friends, the Arab people. Before today, I had not even met you. However, 
in all your eyes I see the spirit of nationalism rising up, I see a deep belief 
in it. I se this; I se that every one of you is profoundly convinced. 
The patterns of lexical item repetition in the Arabic ST and English TT 
compare as follows: 
ST 
1. ::'j: 2 occurrences 
2. 4-": 3 occurrences 
3. Ƒఙ: 4 occurrences 
4. Ø: 3 occurrences

131 
The above table shows there to be 33 instances of lexical repetition in the 
ST, and 13 in the TT. In the table, we have included the English TT phrase 
'is not' as a lexical item, since it corresponds to the Arabic lexical item 
š. It is worth spending time in class comparing repetition of two other 
sorts of features: phrase repetition and repetition of pronouns/possessive 
adjectives. 
While lexical repetition is the most commonly used form of rhetorical 
anaphora in Arabic, as in the above text, it is also possible to find root 
repetition used for rhetorical purposes. An example is the following, attributed 
to 4JJÀ ðI, who is sometimes regarded as the founder of sociology: 
This has been translated (Stabler 1999: 17) as: 
the vanquished are always obsessed with imitating the vanquisher 
Here the translation reproduces something of the repetition of the ST, with 
its use of 'vanquished' and 'vanquisher' . This use of root repetition for 
rhetorical purposes is similar to rhetorical anaphora involving lexical items. 
It relies on the fact that not only is the root repeated, but the lexical items 
involved (in this case ,-;-,,.,lL and గU) have closely related meanings (here 
they are antonyms). 
Another area in which Arabic and English differ is in their use of discourse 
connectives. In many genres at least, Arabic sentences are typically longer 
than English sentences, and sentences and clauses in Arabic are typically 
connected either by one of the three basic connectives JI ...i, and Č, or by 
the use of one of the simple secondary connectives such as Ţ, ,j!, etc. 
Particularly in Classical Arabic, J and ...i are extremely common, as 
illustrated by the following extract from the t..ill by 4JJÀ ðI (example 
adapted from Holes 1995: 220).

A published English translation of this by Franz Rosenthal (Ibn KhaldGn 
[ 1 958] 1 967: Vol. 11, 27 1-2) reads as follows; we have placed relevant 
English connectives in curly brackets together with their ST equivalents: 
{ 0", }  The reason for this is that, as is well known { and",} well established, 
the individual human being cannot by himself obtain all the necessities of 
life. {0", }  All human beings must co-operate to that end in their civilization. 
{ But",} what is obtained through the co-operation of a group of human 
beings satisfies the need of a number many times greater (than themselves). 
{ For instance  } ,  no one, by himself, can obtain the share of the wheat 
he needs for food. { But ", }  when six or ten persons, including a smith and 
a carpenter to make the tools, and others who are in charge of the oxen, 
the plowing of the soil, the harvesting of the ripe grain, and all the other 
agricultural activities, { 0",} undertake to obtain their food { and } work 
toward that purpose either separately or collectively { and ",} thus obtain 
through their labour a certain amount of food, { 0   }  (that amount) will 
be food for a number of people many times their own. (0 ) The combined 
labour produces more than the needs and necessities of the workers. 
Here the ST makes use of connective ", seven times, and connective ..j three 
times. The English omits any connective five times (omission being marked 
by 0 in the IT); these omissions correspond three times to ST ", and twice to 
ST . ", is translated twice by 'and', and twice by 'but'.  is translated once 
by 'For example' .  
A striking feature of this passage i s  the concessive use of "" which is 
translated twice by 'but' in the published English translation. Even in modern 
Arabic "" fairly frequently, and , rather less often, are best translated by a 
concessive. The following are two examples, with the relevant connectives 
placed in curly brackets in the Arabic original and English translation: 
This has been translated (Brown 1 996: 55) as: 
After he had finished he left her, { although } he kept on waving until the 
grave was out of sight. 

Discourse and intertextual issues in translation 
133 
A second example is: 
This might be translated (cf. Rolph 1995: 12) as: 
The birth was supposed to take place in the spring. { but} it took place in 
the summer. 
In some types of modem Arabic writing. the system of connectives is 
rather different from the Classical Arabic norm. Consider the following. 
from a modem Arabic text on housing economics (from Holes 1995: 221). 
We have placed connectives in curly brackets: 
This might be translated as follows; we have placed the English connectives 
in curly brackets together with their ST equivalents: 
{ In addition uఐ d.J oJ B i,Jţ,J }. the storing of ready-made building 
materials presents unique difficulties as compared with other manufactured 
units. { In view oLI Iఏ,J }  the large amounts of space taken up. {0 
uఎ} storage costs are huge. {and u i L--S } warehouses cannoŤ cope. 
{despite 0-0 ׵,) I Â } their relatively large size. { Accordingly ť఍,J 
uఌ ఋ}. production policies need to be based on the selling of products 
as soon they are produced { in order to ״ } avoid the problem of tying 
up invested capital. {and u',J} to allow for production policy to be changed 
according to assessments of future consumer demand. 
This text is typical of academic-oriented empirical writing in modem 
Arabic. The connectives used in modem Arabic academic-oriented writing 
are much more similar to those used in modem English argumentative writing 
than are the connectives used in comparable Classical Arabic writing. However. 

134 
Thinking Arabic translation 
there are types of writing in modern Arabic in which the uses of connectives 
are typically rather different from those of English. A good example is written 
fictional narrative. 
In English, unplanned narratives (story-telling) often make heavy use of 
'and', as in the following example of a story spontaneously composed by a 
small child on the basis of previous telling by an adult (from Hasan 1983: 
189): 
There was once a little girl and a little boy and a dog. And the sailor was 
their daddy. And the little doggy was white. And they liked the little 
doggy. And they stroked it, and they fed it. And he ran away. And then 
the daddy had to go on a ship. And the children missed 'em. And they 
began to cry. 
This kind of textual structure is quite easy to produce. Al clauses are presented 
as fairly important (foregrounded), and therefore available for the future 
development of the text. 
Unlike unplanned narratives, planned narratives in English, and particularly 
the naratives of written fiction, tend to make much greater use of subordination. 
In Arabic, by contrast, coordination is a typical feature of written fictional 
narratives as well as unplanned material (cf. also Ch, 9.2.5). In translating 
written fictional narrative material, therefore, it is often stylistically appropriate 
to convert coordinate structures in Arabic into subordinate structures in English. 
Consider the following from e' ,."! I I  Jb. by "rot.:. FCj: 
4j J.=.l.<..A 4 , .0 ', e 'DJ EF 4 i ,  ",-, Gl.l.:'J ,wlHj IWJ 
[ ... ] y.L.. + I ,-:-,LA:U- 
This is translated (St John 1999: 6) as: 
As he became more and more depressed, slowly and thirstily she began to 
crush him until one of his friends urged him to go to a sorcerer [ ... J 
Here the Arabic has a series of coordinated clauses (beginning with 
ఇఈJ' 1.l.:'-" and 4 , .0
'
, e). The English reorganizes these around a 
single main clause (beginning 'slowly and thirstily'), with an initial subordinate 
clause (beginning 'As he became') and a final subordinate clause (beginning 
'until one of his friends'). In this case, the change of subordination structure 
is partly in order to give the appropriate meaning in the English IT, but also 
to produce a style which is generally acceptable in English. 
Regardless of generic considerations, in many cases, Arabic connectives 
simply 'disappear' in the English IT, or correspond to features of punctuation; 
ઞ and j!, for example, quite commonly signal the specific substantiation 
of a previous general claim, and can be omitted in English or replaced by a 
semi-colon, or colon or dash. An example with . 2 . .! 
' (from Dickins and 

Discourse and intertextual issues in translation 
135 
Watson 1999: 312) is the following: 
,u. i,,· o lఅu-lI ..:.Jચ oW [ . . .  ]  I ઙ ,0" .:.l.k.iઝ.:=.ULs: 
[II] t-4-J ఄ JII    
This might be translated as: 
[ ... ] the three provinces of Upper Egypt [ ... ] had been transformed into a 
raging inferno: a church and a mosque had been burnt down. 
For further discussion of,jl and Ŧ, se Dickins and Watson (1999: 309-15). 
Other discourse mark׭rs which are often encountered in Arabic are s!, 
and .l-:i (with the perfect). These have specific functions in Arabic, some of 
which we encounter in this course (cf. also Dickins and Watson 1999: 419-28, 
448-60). They do not, however, normally have translation implications; that 
is to say, the very real subtleties of meaning which these discourse particles 
introduce into the Arabic ST do not need to be - and, normally at least, 
cannot be - reproduced in the English TT. A translator from Arabic to 
English, therefore, only occasionally needs to worry about s 1 and .u. 
A slightly more complicated case is presented by IIđ II. Ll (e.g. IlA L..l 
Ԫ  ..)J • .':, • i !I) (cf. Dickins and Watson 1999: 482-9). " '  L..l 
.. đ is sometimes glossed in ArabiclEnglish dictionaries as meaning 'as for' 
(e.g. 'As for this man, he is famous in Egypt'). In fact, it relatively rarely 
translates idiomatically as 'as for'. Sometimes, like s! and ԩ, it is best 
omitted from the English translation. Elsewhere, it will have quite different 
idiomatic translations such as 'however', 'on the other hand', etc., as the 
three following examples show (relevant elements in the TT are placed in 
curly brackets). 
The first is example is taken from the novel ׬ 1 y.l-,..o by u '" , e 
b..)|:

"r.J 1 bః1 L. 1 ,જ.u " IJ oǡ.>J 1 oL..:..C l .:=.UlS

This has been translated (Brown 1996: 55) as: 
The olive and palm branches were brittle; the wild bush, {however}, was 
still defying death. 
The second example is taken from a magazine article on religious extremism 
and violence in the Middle East. The previous paragraph has dealt with 
religious-oriented violence in Israel. The article has also previously discussed 
an explosion in Saudi Arabia, to which the text now returns. This extract is 
from the beginning of a new paragraph: 

136 
Thinking Arabic translation 
[ . .. ] c.>r1 ֦L.:. / ,  V.<.:;' 
ol.,......J 1  J45 I .!.Jolt... శi 
This has been translated (Hetherington 1996: 26) as follows: 
{ On the other hand} ,  an examination of the explosion in Saudi Arabia 
reveals a different aspect of the problem. 
The third example is from an account of the British general election of 1997. 
Again this is from a new paragraph, in which the problems of the Labour 
Party in the 1980s are being contrasted with the success of the Conservatives 
under Margaret Thatcher: 
This has been translated (Conduit 1998: 21) as: 
The Labour Party, { meanwhile}, was riven by internal splits. 
Languages also differ in their use of punctuation as a cohesion marker. It 
should be remembered that Arabic traditionally made no use of punctuation, 
and that even now punctuation is often used in Arabic in ways which seem 
rather arbitrary. Even the use of basic punctuation markers such as full stops 
can be highly idiosyncratic, particularly in literary writing. 
10.2.1.1 Sentence splitting 
Since sentences in Arabic tend to be longer than sentences in English, it is 
not infrequently necessary to split up one Arabic sentence into a number of 
English ones. The following is a good example: 
t.".:J I lolA V- ..:Jį Iİ 61J ,u" '0] 0-..0 ֧1  .!.Jı J-"1 1l+J

This could be translated (cf. Ives 1999: 12) as follows:

Unfortunately such concerns are not unique to Kosovo though. We have 
seen struggles such as this in various countries. and have witnessed similar 
scenes of madness caused by religious fanaticism or extreme nationalism. 
but never on the scale which we saw in Bosnia. And yet. now we see it 
again. with redoubled force in Kosovo. whose population comprises some 
90% Muslims. and whose natural right it is to demand some form of 
self-government The Bosnians previously raised the issue of independence 
in the past. but eventually accepted a modest form of self-government at 
the Rambouillet talks. 
Here a single Arabic sentence is relayed by four English sentences. 
10.2.1.2 Textual restructuring 
Rather more tricky than sentence splitting is textual restructuring: that is. the 
reorganizing of chunks of textual material in the IT in order to make them 
read more cogently. Sentence splitting may be regarded as oriented towards 
cohesion. in that it concerns the ways in which texts. in different languages. 
adopt different ways of linking material together. Textual restructuring. by 
contrast. is more oriented towards coherence; it concerns the ways in which 
languages typically organize their ideas differently from one another. Consider 
the following: 
,9Ij:._.! .. i l" ,4-bI:.I.JI" ,7".LJ I J;'i l <J= I >?I J.iJ 
4 .. : .. :'J@ ·· AB I JCI 0-0 4J ·· bJJD IJ;I E IF I" 
[ . . .  ] ˔- ˕"" 4- ԦJ" 
This could be translated (cf. Hetherington 1996: 31) as: 
The Saudi state regarded nationalism. democracy. socialism and liberalism 
as imported ideas and thus evil works of Satan. It characterized them as 
godless ideologies. and fought against them by funding their opponents. 
A more literal translation. e.g. 'It fought against them. supported their 
opponents. and characterized them as godless ideologies' seems odd in English, 
principally because it begins with the practical actions taken by the Saudis 
('fought against them'. 'supported their opponents') and then goes on to give 
the reason for these actions ('characterized them as godless ideologies'). It 
thus runs directly counter to the normal tendency in English, which is to start 
by describing principles (in this case 'characterized them as godless ideologies') 
and then go on to describe the practical consequences of these principles 
('fought against them by funding their opponents'). This is the order of the 
restructured IT. The restructured IT also reorganizes ԧJ" 4 ... =,-:'J˖ 
4- (literally: 'fought against them and supported their opponents') into 

138 
Thinking Arabic translation 
the composite phrase 'fought against them by supporting their opponents', 
which provides what seems from the English point of view necessary 
substantiation of the claim that Saudi Arabia fought against nationalism, etc. 
It is important to stress that the fact that the IT reorganizes this material does 
not mean that the Arabic ST is illogical; from the Arabic point of view, it 
might be argued that the ST clause I • ii, 0,J,J 4-0",......; վ.J,J ௽,)௾ 
..r--UJ has cogency because it represents a build-up of increasingly strong 
responses: i.e. Saudi Arabia not only fought these ideologies on its own 
behalf, it also went beyond this to actively support their opponents. Finally, 
and most strongly from an Islamic point of view, it characterized them as 
godless. 
This kind of textual structuring is distinct from the kind of restructuring 
we saw at various points in Chapter 9, in that it is not a function of theme-rheme 
or main-subordinate considerations. Of course, in some cases the kind of 
considerations we have looked at in this section may interact with other 
theme-rheme or main-subordinate considerations to produce changes in textual 
organization. 
10.2.1.3 Paragraphing 
Like punctuation, paragraphing can pose problems in Arabic/English 
translation. In English, there are some generic considerations involved in 
paragraphing; news reports tend to have very short paragraphs, sometimes 
only a single sentence; academic writing often makes use of extremely long 
paragraphs. However, in general, we may say that paragraphs typically cover 
a particular scene or episode within the overall set of scenes or episodes 
covered by the larger global text. In some cases, paragraphs begin with a 
so-called 'topic-sentence', that is a sentence which states what the general 
topic of the paragraph is. Thus, a publisher's blurb on the back cover of a 
book entitled The Sounds o/the World's Languages begins 'This book gives 
a description of all the known ways in which the sounds of the world's 
languages differ'. 
In Arabic, similar conventions for paragraphing to those of English are 
followed by many writers. However, not infrequently, one comes across 
paragraphing in Arabic which clearly does not follow English-type 
conventions. Under such circumstances, the translator will nonnally expect 
to reparagraph the IT according to the conventions of English. 
10.3 THE INTERTEXTUAL LEVEL 
We have just suggested that in order to detennine the function of a textual 
variable on the discourse level, the translator must know whether it simply 

Discourse and intertextual issues in translation 
139 
reflects SL conventions or whether it departs from them. But of course, this 
is true of textual variables on any level. No text, and no part of any text, 
exists in total isolation from others. Even the most innovative of texts and 
turns of phrase form part of a whole body of speaking and writing by which 
their originality or unoriginality is measured. We shall give the term intertextual 
level to the level of textual variables on which texts are viewed as bearing 
significant external relations to other texts in a given culture or cultures. 
10.3.1 Genre membership 
There are two main sorts of intertextual relation that particularly concern 
translators. The most common is that of genre membership. We shall look at 
the question of genre as such in Chapter 13. For the moment, it is enough to 
point out that a play, for example, will or will not be typical of a certain sort 
of play in the SL culture; an instruction manual will or will not be typical of 
a certain sort of instruction manual, and so on. Before translating an ST, 
then, the translator must judge how typical it is of its genre. If it is utterly 
typical of an established ST genre, it may be necessary to produce a similarly 
typical TT. This will be relatively straightforward in the case of, say, computer 
manuals. It can prove tricky where there is no TL genre corresponding to that 
of the ST. 
A good example of a genre which is traditional in Arabic but which has 
no real correspondent in the English-speaking world is the Ll..i... This form 
of writing was written in ઒, a term which is sometimes translated into 
English as 'rhymed prose', and which involved not only the standard 
monorhyme of Arabic poetry, but also semantic parallelism and morphological 
repetition (cf. Hourani 199 1 :  52-3; Irwin 1999: 178-93). 
The following text is from the start of 4 2 i ,t;, • JJ I LW I by į ઓW I

The MaMma of Damascus 
Al-Hruith son of Hammrun related: 
I went from 'Irak to Damascus with its green water-courses, 
in the 
day when I had troops of fine-bred horses and was the owner of coveted 
wealth and resources, 
free to divert myself, as I chose, 
and flown 
with the pride of him whose fullness overflows. 
When I reached the 
city after toil and teen 
on a camel travel-lean, 
I found it to be all that 
tongues recite 
and to contain soul's desire and eye's delight. 
So I 
thanked my journey 
and entered Pleasure's tourney 
and began there 
to break the seals of appetites that cloy 
and cull the clusters of joy, 
until a caravan for 'Irak was making ready -
and by then my wild 
humour had become steady, 
so that I remembered my home and was 
not consoled, 
but pined for my fold -
wherefore I struck the tents of 
absence and yearning 
and saddled the steed of returning. 
The translator has chosen here to produce a TT which mirrors both the 
rhyme, the rhythm and even the graphic presentation of the ST, reflecting the 
central importance of these features for the ST genre. As Irwin points out, 
'There is nothing very like the maqamat genre in Western literature. The 
individual maqamas should not be read as short stories, as they are insufficiently 
and inconsistently plotted. Language and the display of language skills take 
precedence over story-telling in each of the episodes' (Irwin 1999: 179). 
Given this there is little choice for the translator but to convey at least some 
of the verbal art of the ST in his or her TT. 
Readers will probably agree that Nicholson's translation of L..L.il1 
4 
• 
• 
."':. 
oJJ I is something of a technical feat. Given the clear lack of 
correspondence of the TT to any established English genre, however, the TT 
is also clearly exotic. How highly readers rate this TT will depend at least in 
part on the extent to which they find it acceptable to reproduce an ST genre 
in a TT, where the TL has no such established genre. 
The LL.:i... genre itself has effectively disappeared in modem Arabic, as 
has ઑ in its pure form (cf. Beeston 1970: 1 13). It is, however, possible to 
fmd ŧ-like material in modem literature, and even in some non-literary 
texts (cf. Dickins and Watson 1999: 548-9). As with classical texts involving 
t '?' 
,.\ the strategic decision as to whether to avoid rhyme or to produce a 
rhyming TT and accept the consequent exoticism will depend on what the 
purpose of the TT is. 

Discourse and intertextual issues in translation 
141 
10.3.2 Quotation and allusion 
The second category of intertextual relations is that of quotation or allusion. 
A text may directly quote from another text. In such cases, the translator has 
to decide whether to borrow the standard 1L translation of the quoted text. If 
it is very familiar in the TL culture, there will have to be special reasons for 
departing from it. This is so, for example, in the case of oU".w I L.:.¤  
(cf. Practical 6.3), which is quotation from Mme de Pompadour (mistress of 
the French king Louis XV), 'Apres nous Ie d»luge' ('After us the flood/deluge'), 
which is itself an allusion to the Biblical (and Quranic) FloodlDeluge. Similarly, 
another short story by ºJJ! §..H entitled ௷ .פ contains the phrase 
.1.;l1 / ௸ J௹ WV Ji... Given that this saying is well known in 
English in its French form, one would probably translate this along the lines: 
"'Cherchez la femme", as the French saying puts it' - with an additional shift 
from indefinite צק ר) in the ST to definite ('the French saying') in 
recognition of the fact that the proverb is well known in English (but not, 
apparently, in Arabic). 
Sometimes an ST quotation or allusion that is full of resonances for the 
SL reader would be completely lost on the 1L reader. For example, the 
introduction to(s.J¼1 JJl..b's book .J.JL..:..l1 c-:'l.,. ½ o"...L..l1 o l""';"YI, 
having excoriated the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood for its fruitless political 
manoeuvering over the past few decades, ends with the Quranic-type phrase 
O¾J.1.:! Y ¿.J 'And perhaps they know not'. This would be immediately 
picked up by an Arab reader (even an Egyptian Copt, or other non-Muslim), 
but would be lost on the average British or American reader. 
In such cases, the translator may either leave the quotation or allusion out 
altogether, or simply translate it literally, or, if it has an important function in 
the ST, use some form of compensation. It all depends on what exactly the 
function is. In the case of the phrase o.,.s.J.1.:! Y ץ.Jt the translation 'And 
perhaps they know not', with its archaic 'Biblical' negative ('know not') 
might be adequate to suggest to the English-speaking reader that this is a 
religious allusion, even if it is not necessarily clear to him or her what the 
allusion is to. 
Particularly where ST intertextual features are more a matter of allusion 
than simple quotation, translation problems can become acute. An allusion is 
normally something deliberate, but we often see allusions where none was 
intended. An accidental allusion might be more accurately called an echo. 
When readers or listeners respond to intertextual features of this sort, they 
are real factors in the meaning and have an impact on the text. We know, for 
example, that Keats was not alluding to Donovan's 'They call me mellow 
yellow' in 'To Autumn'. What we do not know is whether Keats was alluding 
to Thomson's 'roving mists', or to Wordsworth's 'mellow Autumn charged 
with bounteous fruit'. But, for readers who do hear these possible echoes and 
allusions, they are part of the richness of Keats's lines. 

142 
Thinking Arabic translation 
Finally, it is as true on the intertextual level as on all other levels that the 
translator must be careful to avoid accidentally introducing inappropriate 
features. For an example of how easily this can happen, consider again the 
phrase .. ௴ '.J .h..!.:..1'.J ௵'.J ௶,  u-A' which formed part of the oath 
sworn to L:a.tJ '  v.-, the founder and leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, by 
members of the Brotherhood (cf. Ch. 8.2.3. 1). Given the pattern repetition in 
the ST, it is tempting to mark the formulaic, ritualized tone by repeating the 
preposition 'in': 'in comfort and in adversity, in suffering and in joy'. 
Unfortunately, this might sound like an allusion to the marriage service in 
the Book of Common Prayer ('for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in 
sickness and in health') - a quite inappropriate intertext for a text on the 
Muslim B rotherhood! Luckily, this can be avoided by simply not repeating 
the 'in': 'in comfort and adversity, suffering and joy.'

Consider the following Arabic text, and the English translation given after it. 
The English translation is in general fairly idiomatic. The connectives, however, 
are direct translations of the Arabic connectives. Your task is to produce a 
fully idiomatic English translation by replacing the connectives in the version 
of the English translation given here with more idiomatic ones, or in some 
cases with none at all. In certain cases you will also need to make other 
changes to the English text, which follow on from changes made to the 
connectives. Connectives in the Arabic original and the English translation to 
be edited have been placed in curly brackets { ... } in order to make them

Metaphor 
1 1.1 INTRODUCTION 
In Chapters 5 and 6 we looked at denotative and connotative meaning. In this 
chapter, we conclude our consideration of the semantic level of language by 
examining the translation of metaphor. Metaphor is typically used to describe 
something (whether concrete or abstract) more concisely, with greater 
emotional force, and more often more exactly, than is possible in literal 
language. Compare even a clicM like 'Bush slams Buchanan' with the more 
literal 'Bush harshly criticizes Buchanan'. Of course, an original metaphor is 
likely to be more expressive than an unoriginal one. But it is also likely to be 
more imprecise, more open to interpretation - indeed, the expressive force of 
a metaphor often depends on this very imprecision. For instance, Shakespeare's 
'[Love] is the star to every wand'ring bark' expresses concisely and intensely 
the unmovableness and reliability of love in a shifting, uncertain and dangerous 
world. But why 'the star' and not 'a star'? Why a ship ('bark') and not, say, 
a walker or a desert caravan? The image of navigating the seas by the pole 
star is full of resonances which makes Shakespeare's metaphor less precise, 
but much more expressive, than 'Bush slams Buchanan'. 
Metaphor is only one of a number of what are traditionally known as 
figures of speech. Other figures of speech include synecdoche, metonymy, 
irony, and simile. All are of interest in translation. However, metaphor is by 
far the most important, both because it is the most widespread, and because it 
poses the most challenging translation problems. According to Newmark, 
'Whilst the central problem of translation is the overall choice of a translation 
method for a text, the most important particular problem is the translation of 
metaphor' (Newmark 1988: 104). Metaphor can give rise to difficulties in 
translation between any two languages, but where the languages concerned 
are as relatively different culturally and linguistically as English and Arabic, 
the difficulties are sometimes quite pronounced. For an introduction to the 
other figures of speech, see Abrams (1985). 

Metaphor 
147 
1 1.2 GENERAL DEFINITION OF METAPHOR 
Metaphor can be defined as a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is 
used in a non-basic sense, this non-basic sense suggesting a likeness or 
analogy with another more basic sense of the same word or phrase. Consider 
the first two senses of 'rat' given in the Collins English Dictionary: (i) 'any 
of numerous long-tailed murine rodents, esp. of the genus Rattus, that are 
similar to but larger than mice and are now distributed all over the world', 
and (ii) 'a person who deserts his friends or associates, esp. in times of 
trouble' .  Here each sense of 'rat' may be said to call to mind the other 
(although the first would in most contexts only weakly call to mind the 
second). That is to say, any use of 'rat' in a particular text has the potential to 
invoke a reflected meaning. However, 'rat' in the sense of 'a person who 
deserts his friends or associates' is a metaphor with respect to 'any of numerous 
long-tailed murine rodents'. By contrast, 'rat' in the sense of 'any of numerous 
long-tailed murine rodents' is not a metaphor with respect to 'a person who 
deserts his friends or associates' . This is because we perceive the sense of 
'rat' 'any of numerous long-tailed murine rodents' as being more basic than 
the sense 'a person who deserts his friends or associates' .  This is in line with 
a general perception of physical objects as more basic than non-physical 
attributes. 
1 1.2.1 Lexicalized metaphor and non-Iexicalized metaphor 
From the point of view of translation, a useful basic distinction to make is 
that between lexicalized metaphors and non-Iexicalized metaphors. What 
we mean by lexicalized metaphors are uses of language which are recognizably 
metaphorical, but whose meaning in a particular language is relatively clearly 
fixed. 'Rat' in the sense 'a person who deserts his friends or associates' is an 
example. The fact that the meaning of 'rat' in this sense is relatively clearly 
fixed allows this meaning to be subjected to attempted dictionary definition. 
Accordingly, for practical purposes, we may say that lexicalized metaphors 
are metaphors whose meanings are given in dictionaries. 
The other basic category of metaphor is what we are calling non-Iexicalized 
metaphor. In the case of non-Iexicalized metaphor the metaphorical meaning 
is not clearly fixed, but will vary from context to context, and has to be 
worked out by the reader on particular occasions. An example of a non­
lexicalized metaphor is '[a] tree' in 'A man is a tree'. If this were uttered in a 
context in which the focus was on the distinction between the relatively 
small amount which is apparent or conscious about human personality and 
the relatively large amount which is hidden or unconscious, the reader might 
conclude that 'A man is a tree' is roughly equivalent to saying that 'A man is 
like a tree in that only a certain proportion is apparent (in the case of the tree: 

148 
Thinking Arabic translation 
the trunk, branches and leaves), while much remains hidden (in the case of 
the tree: the extensive root system)'. If, however, 'A man is a tree' were 
uttered in the context of a description of the course of peoples' lives, the 
reader might conclude that what is meant is something more like 'A man is 
like a tree in that he grows up, develops, "bears fruit" like a tree, and then 
loses many of his attractiva attributes (cf. the leaves), etc.'. 
The example 'A man is a tree' raises the question of how non-Iexicalized 
metaphor is to be analysed in particular contexts. One approach which is 
useful for translation distinguishes between the following notions: topic, 
vehicle, and grounds (e.g. Goatly 1997). The topic is the entity referred to; 
the vehicle is the notion to which this entity is being compared; and the 
grounds are the respect in which this comparison is being made. Consider the 
example 'Tom is a tree' ,  in which '[a] tree' is the metaphorical element, and 
in a context in which we can take the intended meaning to be something like 
'Tom is the type of person whose major psychological features remain hidden'. 
In this example, the topic is Tom; or more precisely it is the 'entity' to which 
the word 'Tom' here refers. The vehicle is '[a] tree' in its literal sense. The 
grounds are the respect in which Tom is like a tree - in this case in the fact 
that major features of him are not apparent. From the point of view of this 
analysis, we might paraphrase 'Tom is a tree' as 'Tom (topic) is like a tree 
(vehicle) in that major psychological aspects of him are not apparent (g rounds)'. 
Although it is a bit artificial to apply the notions of topic, vehicle and 
grounds to lexicalized metaphor, we will keep things simple by using the 
terms, where appropriate, in discussing both lexicalized and non-Iexicalized 
metaphor. 
The distinction between lexicalized and non-Iexicalized metaphors is not 
always clear-cut. English speakers are likely to agree that the metaphorical 
sense of 'rat' that we have given is a lexicalized metaphor. They are also 
likely to agree that 'platypus' in English has no such fixed secondary sense, 
and that therefore if it is used metaphorically, it is, in terms of the definition 
which we have given, a non-Iexicalized metaphor. They are likely to be less 
sure, however, about secondary senses of 'tiger', 'elephant' , or 'ostrich' (cf. 
Leech 198 1 :  2 14-1 5). From the point of view of translation, the importance 
of the distinction between lexicalized and non-Iexicalized metaphors is not 
that it should be absolutely true, but that it provides a reasonable way in the 
great majority of cases of distinguishing two major classes of metaphor, 
which, as we shall se, typically require rather different treatment in translation. 
Note that both sorts of metaphor can consist of more than one word. Such 
metaphors are known as phrasal metaphors. Thus '[Tom is] a tree whose 
leaves protect us all' is a non-Iexicalized phrasal metaphor, and the idiom 
'[Tom] knows his onions' is a lexicalized phrasal metaphor. In principle, all 
lexicalized phrasal metaphors are idioms. 
Simile can be treated in much the same way as metaphor. Thus, in 'Tom 
is like a shady tree' ,  the simile element is 'like a shady tree', the topic is 

Metaphor 
149 
'Tom', the vehicle is '[aJ shady tree', and the grounds are that major aspects 
of him are not apparent. 
11.2.1.1 Categories oJlexicalized metaphor 
It is useful to distinguish three types of lexicalized metaphors. (1) a dead 
metaphor is one which one does not normally even realize is a metaphor, as 
in a 'talented' man or the 'arm' of a chair. (2) A stock metaphor is one that is 
widely used as an idiom, as in 'keep the pot boiling', 'throw a new light on' 
(cf. Newmark 1988: 108). (3) A recent metaphor is a 'metaphorical neologism' , 
as in 'with it' (in the sense of 'fashionable'), 'head-hunting' (in the sense of 
'recruitment') (cf. Newmark 1988: 1 1 1-12). 
11.2.1.2 Categories oJnon-lexicalized metaphor 
It is worth distinguishing two basic types of non-lexicalized metaphor. These 
are conventionalized metaphors and original metaphors. 
Conventionalized metaphors are metaphors which are not lexicalized (and 
will not therefore be given in dictionaries), but do draw on either cultural or 
linguistic conventions. English, for example, makes use of a large number of 
lexicalized metaphors based on the general notion of argument as war (cf. 
Goatly 1997: 75): e.g. 'battle of wits', 'attack' or 'lash out' at an opponent, 
'defend a position', 'counter-attack', 'bombard' with questions, 'win' an 
argument. If, in this kind of context, an English ST contains a phrase like 'he 
redeployed his troops', the reader will have little difficulty in interpreting it 
along the lines 'he refocused his argument', or 'he began to concentrate on 
another aspect of the debate'. Although 'redeploy [ ... J troops' is not a lexicalized 
metaphor in English, it is easy to interpret at least partly because of the 
generalized convention in English that arguments are described in terms of 
war, and the existence of a large number of lexicalized metaphors along 
these lines. 
There is also another more linguistically-oriented form of conventionalized 
metaphor. This is what Newmark terms adapted metaphor. An adapted 
metaphor is one in which a stock metaphor is slightly changed; an example is 
'the ball is a little in their court' (Newmark 1988: 1 1 1). Here is an example 
we have already come across (Ch. 8.2.3.2):

Thinking Arabic translation 
Proposed translation (Calderbank 1990: 27): 
EI Banna refused to listen to the group and { crossed words } several times 
with Rifaat. These exchanges always ended up with more support for 
Rifaat and eventually, faced with Rifaat's complete control of the General 
Headquarters [ ... J 
The phrase 'cross words' ,  here, is an adapted metaphor which echoes the 
existing English phrase 'cross swords' , meaning to clash with, particularly in 
debate or discussion. 
Original metaphors are ones like 'Tom is a tree' , quoted above. Because 
they are not simply relatable to existing linguistic or cultural conventions, 
original metaphors are difficult to interpret. More specifically, it is necessary 
to establish the grounds from the context, and in many cases these will be 
ambiguous. 
11.3 BASIC TRANSLATION TECHNIQUES FOR METAPHOR 
The following procedures can be regarded as the most typical for translating 
the various categories of metaphors which we have discussed above. 
11.3.1 Dead metaphors 
Since the metaphorical element in these is very weak, it can normally be 
ignored in the translation and some appropriate TL form sought. Sometimes 
the obvious form will involve the same or virtually the same vehicle in the 
IT as in the ST. Thus t. L.t.:.) is the standard Arabic word for 'rise' in the 
sense of a rise in prices. Sometimes, the IT vehicle will appear in a slightly 
different form; so 0 vl-c vs 'at the hands of . Sometimes, the IT will use a 
different metaphor from the ST; thus અL...J I ƴ൞ vs 'hand' (of clock). 
Sometimes the ST metaphor will be best translated by a non-metaphorical 
IT term; thus u!- 1,riJ I i jJ 'he took to his bed' , £..;1 1 0-.0 iU 'he recovered 
from the illness' .  
Where an ST dead metaphor is being translated by a IT metaphor, the 
translator should bear in mind whether the IT metaphor is as dead as the ST: 
in some contexts it would be inappropriate to use a metaphor with more 
metaphorical force than the ST one; in others, this may be acceptable or even 
desirable. 

Metaphor 
1 5 1  
1 1.3.2 Stock metaphors 
The following techniques are suggested for translating stock metaphors (cf. 
Newmark 1988: 108-1 1 ). 
The stock SL metaphor can be retained as a stock metaphor having the 
same or nearly the same vehicle in the TL. This can be done provided the 
vehicle has comparable frequency and currency in the appropriate register in 
the TL as in the SL, as in the following (the metaphorical element in the ST 
and its equivalent in the IT in all the following examples are placed in curly 
brackets): [ . . .  ] .JY I lA J=... { -=.J".:....I} wi ..>-;' ં rJ 'Never 
before had such thoughts { possessed} Saber.' (Brown 1 996: 34); y.:. 1 .J.J 
ɫ ? : ,. " .J ௡௢.J ௣.J uÊ { b.l.AW,} 'its four walls had { witnessed} 
his hunger and thirst, his weeping and sobbing' (Brown 1 996: 38). 
The stock SL metaphor can be replaced with a stock TL metaphor having 
a different vehicle. This is appropriate where the vehicle in the SL and TL 
have roughly equal frequency within the register in question. Examples of 
this are: .u.J-"l' {i} Ԡ ௝ l.,.;.i  ,4J wl5..o u.",.....  .J 
[ . . . ] .J I ௠l:o 'He managed to find out where she lived and began to { hang 
around } outside her house constantly [ .. .]' (St John 1 999: 5); rJ '-7 I wi 
[ . . .  ] 1"':'.l...iJ I ௤.JL:..J I i ԟ  { I.Jj} 'that the Serbs have not been 
{ cleansed} of the poisons of ancient history [ . . .  ]' (Ives 1 999: 14). 
The SL metaphor can be converted to a TL simile. This technique works 
where, if translated literally into the SL, the TL metaphor appears too abrupt. 
An example is:  .J.J W.>-:>- { ¡} I¢ I.l.;' £ I   ¤Y I ..J.,rL.J 1  
[ ,  . .  ] 'the other side of the river appeared fractured { as if clothed in } fear and 
sadness' (Merchant 2000: 20), where L...S in the sense of covering is a stock 
metaphor in Arabic, but not one in English. 
The metaphor can be reduced to grounds. This involves losing the metaphor 
altogether, and the emotional effect associated with it. It may, however, be 
appropriate where other strategies are not acceptable for the TL. Examples 
are {b¥ Y I} ¦i ' { Friends} '  (from the start of a speech) (Dickson 1 999: 7); 
I,)"§ I <L{-;, ¨} wi W.JJ ..>-!.>-'"  ..>-;'L..:. J..o-LU 'Saber fidgeted in his 
bed without { feeling } sleepy' (Brown T996: 38); L- I.J--Li 
I 
a '> o "':'W 
[ . . . ] b© ª"1,.o  {b«"1,.o} 'Mohammed had lived for { many } years in 
a small town' (St John 1999: 4). 
Sometimes it may be appropriate to introduce other features in the IT in 
order to compensate for the loss of emotional effect caused by the removal of 
the metaphor. An example is: wi .J.>...઄ w i  L;aઁ1 J: .' ..  ¬.J 
௟l:o I,)"­Y I {b.J.Jj w®} '-7)lhJ 1 ઃ ¯I.J U;:-ijW I 'It is no 
coincidence that we see the student musicians and singers { demonstrate the 
utmost } sensitivity [ ... ]' (Evans 1 994: 1 6). Here the translator has made use 
of a superlative form 'utmost', as well as the rather formal and elegant 
'demonstrate', to achieve the same sort of emotional force as is relayed by 
the metaphor b.J.Jj w.J 
; I.'.! in the ST (cp. the relative weakness of an 

152 
Thinking Arabic translation 
alternative English fonnulation such as 'display extreme sensitivity'). 
11.3.3 Recent metaphors 
Where these are neologisms describing new objects or processes, equivalent 
1L technical tenns can be sought out. This is less likely to be a problem 
translating into English than into Arabic, since the tenns for such new objects 
and processes typically originate in English - and even original Arabic texts 
often make use of the English tenn (typically in Latin script) followed by a 
tentative translation. 'Buzz tenns' present a slightly different problem. The 
fonnality of Standard Arabic means that such tenns do not appear in and 
disappear from Arabic with the same speed as they do in English. One is 
therefore likely to reduce recent metaphors in translating into Arabic to stock 
metaphors, or perhaps to grounds. In translating into English, recent metaphors 
could be used where general requirements of register make them appropriate. 
11.3.4 Non-Iexicalized (conventionalized and original) metaphors 
The following techniques are suggested for translating conventionalized 
metaphors which fall under general cultural or linguistic patterns of metaphor 
organization in the SL. 
The non-Iexicalized SL metaphor can be retained as a non-Iexicalized 
metaphor having the same or nearly the same vehicle in the 1L. This is a 
fairly common technique with non-Iexicalized metaphor. Examples are :w....; 
[ ... J -˗ I L,˘} J.:U t.,uL.;J1 J.:!..Il.l.i.J 1 .;I".:at.:a L..:u ઀LS wi 'ever 
since it had been lit by the light of subdued lamps - before the {invasion } of 
electricity' (Brown 1996: 38); L:UL...... v-i {א .H '  i ''':} ˙ I  "iJ 
­ _u .: .' L • JĪ 'And the { belly } of the moon does not {grow round } in our 
sky naturally' (Rolph 1995: 13). 
Sometimes it is necessary to make other changes, which do not essentially 
alter the metaphor, but which render the context in which it occurs more 
ascepÈble in English. For example: v-' I Jʸ .u}J ˚.u I Ԟ ..IJ ,,;, i .: ;. 
.{ 1..It...  I",.. ˛ J.:!j.A .L:.:i 'He would roam across town, {an emaciated cat, 
mewing plaintively}.' (St John 1999: 5-6). Here the translator has omitted 
the ˜ I Jʹ .1-lJ 'changed/having changed into' element in the English 
translation; this would have rendered the English somewhat clumsy. The 
core of the metaphor, however, remains the same. 
The non-Iexicalized SL metaphor can be replaced with a non-Iexicalized 
TL metaphor having a different vehicle. Sometimes the IT vehicle does not 
work if transferred directly into the ST, but a non-Iexicalized metaphor in the 
IT having a different vehicle does. An example is: ˝..I"il ˞ Jlj L-J 
..I˟}  ˠ I ˡ I  IJUJ IJ ˢJJ I .Jˣ"i1 I.,r:;..a ˤ˥ .)-'4WI 

Metaphor 
153 
'{uYI ơ uJL:. 'Some contemporary literature still refers to the period of 
religious tension and ensuing vengeance, {the flames of which have not yet 
died out} '  (Ives 1999: 13). Here the general metaphorical vehicle of fire is 
retained in the TI, reflecting the fact that it is conventional to use fire 
metaphors to describe anger and violence in both English and Arabic. However, 
the specific vehicle has been shifted from JL:. ('fire') and J੿ ('grew cold') 
in the ST to 'flames' and 'died out' in the TI. 
Elsewhere more subtle changes may be required. For example: JJÉ,J 
˦,J ,௙ J..,.,.:u Gly-i} ˧I˨ ؗL..J ':"':'A ؘ ˩I ƍ 
.{ il I  :˪Jw. 'Mohammed left the mosque, and as he did so, the blood in 
his veins became { a  mass of imploring voices, calling out woefully: "Oh 
God"} '  (St John 1999: 8). Here the translator has somewhat strengthened the 
Arabic metaphor [ . .. ] GI..,......i 'voices', by using the phrase 'a mass of [ ... ] 
voices' ; he has also added the verb 'became'. Both of these changes have the 
effect of ensuring that the metaphor remains evident and comprehensible in 
the English translation, as it would not were a more direct translation adopted, 
such as 'Mohammed left the mosque, the blood in his veins imploring voices, 
calling out woefully: "Oh God".' 
Sometimes it is appropriate to replace the non-Iexicalized ST metaphor 
with a stock TI metaphor. This is typically the case where the non-Iexicalized 
ST metaphor is highly conventionalized, and therefore does not have a 
particularly strong emotional impact. An example is .J,J 6 ,'i, II ˫I,J,;J I,J 
u.l;1,J 'ˬJ˭1 ˮI  uW ď..)-'-'A Đ đ1 « ௗJJ *  Ԝ •

by the Serbian author Ivo Andric [ ... ] reveals the deep-seated hatreds in this 
{ flashpoint} '  (Ives 1999: 13). Here the Arabic metaphor ˯I .J˰ I 'the 
flaming pit/abyss' is non-lexicalized but highly conventional in that fire 
metaphors are commonly used to describe violence, and pit metaphors are 
commonly used to describe extremely problematic situations. Accordingly 
the stock phrase 'flashpoint' seems sufficient for the context A similar example 
of a highly conventionalized, but non-Iexicalized, metaphor translated as a 
stock metaphor is the following: [ ... ] UJ.i.J I {ؙA..r.J I} u.b.:.J.1 .lA  'in 
this {explosive} and unhappy region [ ... r (Ives 1999: 14). Here, if the Arabic 
4. 
__ ௛.:LS:௜ I 'volcanic' had been translated directly as 'volcanic' the reader 
might (initially at least) have thought it was simply a description of the 
geology of the area. 
Occasionally it will happen that a non-Iexicalized metaphor in the ST 
corresponds more or less directly to a stock metaphor in the TI. In this case, 
it is likely to be appropriate to use the stock metaphor in the TI where the 
ST metaphor is conventionalized. Here is an example of a conventionalized 
non-Iexicalized metaphor which is translated by a corresponding stock 
metaphor in English, with the addition also of the topic: t.....Al 1 ੼L....:U

(Jנć I} $! . . .  ..:,.1 ,!

communities, from differing ideologies, generations, factions and nationalities 
have been caught up in this { whirlwind of violence } '  (Hetherington 1996: 
1 3). Here the fact that ) 
.0 c! is conventionalized, i.e. that violence is 
frequently talked about in terms of extreme weather conditions in Arabic, 
means that the English stock expression 'whirlwind of violence' is quite 
acceptable. 
Where the ST metaphor is original in nature, translating by a stock metaphor 
in the TT will destroy the sense of originality, and therefore lessen the 
emotional force. In this case, it may be more appropriate to translate it by a 
non-Iexicalized metaphor in the TT having a different vehicle. 
The SL metaphor can be converted to a simile. Converting an ST metaphor 
to a TT simile can be useful where it is appropriate to retain the ST vehicle 
(or a similar vehicle), but where the use of a metaphor in the TT would seem 
odd for some reason. An example is: ס '-:-'J.P.' ɚɛ} ௓ ɪ ulS:J 
{J....-. 'making him feel { like an old discarded sock } , (St John 1999: 5). 'To 
feel like' is a common usage in English; and the more direct metaphorical 
'making him feel that he was an old discarded sock' might seem somewhat 
strained and even comical. Consider also the following: ,4..JƮ ഢ..;:.il.:." 
Ɯ.u ulɜ ɝ ɞ} '-=z u.-ɟI 4..:-:aIɠI ..:.ɡ1 ֻ ..:.ּ 
(u6ֽ 'He 100ked around at the grey contiguous houses, spread out before 
his eyes { like the skeleton of some ancient beast } '  (St John 1999: 18). Here 
the use of the simile allows the translator to integrate the phrase 'like the 
skeleton of some ancient beast' into the ST in a concise and elegant manner. 
It is also possible, of course, for a simile in the ST to be translated as a 
metaphor in the TT. This is particularly common where the TT metaphor in 
question is a stock metaphor. An example is: [ . .. ] (J5t..s:} 1 • i " I 9 'and 
he followed her, { enchanted } '  (St John 1999: 5). 
The metaphor can be reduced to grounds. This is most likely to happen 
where the ST metaphor is highly conventionalized and translation by a metaphor 
(of whatever kind) in the TT would sound cliched. An example from a 
speech by ੻W I ੺ J4 is the following: ԙ ɢ ɣ ɤ ɥ) 
{4-:J.A u..- ɦ} 4-:0'ɧ {:1 i,! i,ɨ.II} '-=J""" ע ף (Sl.I l {ɩ I 'Friends. 
I offer you a warm welcome to Egypt. The Arab people oT Egypt feel { a  
strong affinity and deep affection } towards Syria' (Dickson 1999: 7). Here 
the phrase I • 
I' I. U-o L...J...:i 
'a piece of its heart' has been related to the 
grounds; i.e. it is a piece of its heart by virtue of sharing a strong/close 
afrmity and having deep affection. It is these grounds, rather than the metaphor, 
which figure in the translation; the metaphorical 'a piece of its heart' (or 
similar) would sound rather twee in English. (Note also the stock metaphor 
:1 i ,! i .'j. II, to describe another Arab country; this can be regarded as having 
been merged with I • 
I' I • u..- L..b..:i into the English TT version, 'a strong 
affinity and deep affection'.) 
Here is a similar example: 06 I} <!",....iJ I ɪ.l ௔ ௕U l r,-=I 

Metaphor 
155 
[ . . . ] {.JI."..-:JI 'the past with all its { terrible } bloodshed [ ... J' (cf. rves 1999: 
14). Here the direct equivalent of .)¢ 1 eg 1 'extremely hot' does not 
collocate happily with c.s..,....J 1 4-i-i..l 'its bloodshed' (or 'the shedding of its 
blood' ,  etc.), and migfit appear comical in the context. The translator has 
accordingly chosen a non-metaphorical equivalent based on the grounds in 
which bloodshed can be 'hot' (such grounds being constructible along the 
lines that bloodshed is like extreme heat in that both are painful, difficult to 
bear, destructive of life, etc.). 
A metaphorical element can be retained in the TI, but with the addition 
of the grounds or the topic. As Newmark notes ( 1988: 1 10), this kind of 
approach is a compromise procedure which retains some of the emotive and 
cultural effect of the metaphor, while also providing an explanation for readers 
who may not understand the original metaphor without further explanation. 
Here is an example of the retention of a non-Iexicalized (original) metaphor 
with addition of the topic: {˳IԘ 1.3""; t..>-:U} 01 ̐.,..b ̑I ..uJ,J 
[ . . .  ] ˴ 1 'He had been waiting for a long time for a woman { to dawn over 
the desert of his life } '  (St John 1999: 10). Here, a direct translation 'He had 
been waiting for a long time for a woman to dawn over his desert' might 
seem rather obscure to the English reader. The translator has accordingly 
added the phrase 'of his life' which specifies a topic for the word <GIԗ 
'[his] desert' (i.e. it specifies what 'desert' refers to). 
The above is of course not an exhaustive list of all the methods which 
may be appropriate or acceptable for dealing with metaphor in Arabic>English 
translation, although it does cover a large proportion of cases. Particular 
circumstances, however, may give rise to the need for approaches quite 
different to the ones we have listed here. 
11.4 EXTENDED AND MIXED METAPHORS 
One of the interesting stylistic features of metaphor is the tendency for a 
particular metaphorical image to be maintained over a fairly long stretch of 
text. By 'image' here, we mean a particular semantic field to which a series 
of vehicles belongs. Consider the following (Brown 1996: 36): 
This can be translated fairly literally as follows: 
Scenes of wretchedness and fear presented themselves to him on a band 
of memories and the longing to emigrate { caught fire} in him. But in the 
depths of his heart an { ember} refused to { go out } ;  every time it { faded } 

156 
Thinking Arabic translation 
it quickly { ignited} again. 
In this case the image of 'fire' is maintained, both in the ST and in the IT. 
Metaphors which maintain the same general image in this way can be tenned 
congruent metaphors. Not all metaphors in a text are necessarily congruent. 
Metaphors which are not congruent with one another are often referred to as 
mixed metaphors. An example of a mixed metaphor is the following regarding 
the Maastricht Treaty promoting closer integration of the European Union: 
'[ ... ] the Foreign £ecretary, Douglas Hurd, said that what he called "trench 
warfare" against the treaty "had evaporated'" (BBC Radio 4 News, 18 May 
1993). Another example of mixed metaphor is 'All the evidence must be 
sifted with acid tests'. Here there is an incongruity between the image conjured 
up by 'sifted' and that conjured up by 'acid tests'. Compare in this regard the 
perfectly acceptable ' All the evidence must be subjected to acid tests'. 
Where the metaphors in question are dead or stock metaphors, mixed 
metaphor is normally not particularly noticeable. So, 'the forces which make 
up the political spectrum' seems reasonably acceptable, despite the fact that 
the basic sense of 'spectrum' has to do with colour rather than (physical) 
force. 
Accordingly, the use of mixed metaphors is not normally a significant 
problem in the translation of dead or stock metaphors, as is shown by the 
following extract from &:!jJ I IJ"'Í by the Sudanese author cJĎ خ I 
<cJL- n.d.: 1 1) and a possible English translation. Metaphors and associated 
phenomena in both the ST and the IT have been noted by curly brackets and 
a following superscript number:

And this was how he remained his whole life. He grew up with only two

when he was six years old, she took him to visit some of her relatives. As 
the sun was setting, they passed by some ruins which were rumoured to 
be { haunted5} .  Suddenly Zein became { fixecJ6} to the spot, and began to 
tremble as if he had a fever. Then he screamed. After that he { took to'} 
his bed for several days. When he { recovere<fl} ,  all his teeth had fallen 
out except one in his upper jaw and one in the lower. 
There is no evident congruity in the metaphors used in this extract. However, 
the fact that none of the metaphors in the IT carry great metaphorical force 
means that there is also no sense of unacceptable mixed metaphor. The 
English IT, which makes use of a mixture of stock metaphors, dead metaphors 
and non-metaphors, similarly carries no sense of unacceptable mixing of 
metaphor. 
This situation contrasts with cases, typically involving a high density of 
non-Iexicalized metaphors, in which mixed metaphor (non-congruence) can 
present a considerable problem in translation. Consider the following (Brown 
1996: 50): 
Ԗ {Q}J .:..,..-J I 1l.A {Q} 01 t.:b -If!': $1 "J J-:'% ொ [ . . . ]

IT' 
Saber wished that he could make this voice { burst forth } and that in tum 
the { volcano } of freedom would {erupt }, 
nor 
had it { flared up in rage } .  
Here the ST metaphors are mostly non-Iexicalized and closely congruent. 
The translator has relayed this congruence in the IT (although considerations 
of idiomaticness in the English have meant that she translated ¤ first in 
the context of 'voice' as 'burst forth', and subsequently in the context of 
'volcano' as 'erupt'). A problem, however, is presented by the phrase " 
௉ 4..J J ' fO':. which we have omitted from the IT as presented here (the 
resulting gap being represented by a line). A possible translation of È " 
ோ w might be 'at which no one bats an eyelid', or perhaps more 
appropriately in this general context, 'at which no one had ever batted an 
eyelid' . However, the use of this particular idiomatic stock metaphor seems 
odd in this context, partly at least because the image (or vehicle) of batting 
an eyelid seems incongruent with the general image of volcanoes and fire. In 
order to avoid this incongruity, it might be appropriate in this case to opt for 
a relatively bland (though still metaphorical) translation of V (j È " 
such as 'which had never attracted anyone's attention' or 'which had never 

1 58 
Thinking Arabic translation 
attracted a glance'. Together with further adjustments to sentence structure 
this might yield a translation along the lines: 
Saber wished that he could make this voice {burst forth } and that in turn 
the { volcano} of freedom would {erupt } ,  which had never once { flared 
up in rage } nor even { attracted} people's attention. 
11.5 METAPHOR DOWNTONING 
Not infrequently Arabic ST metaphors appear too strong or too dense for 
equivalent forms of English writing and there is some need to tone down the 
metaphors of the Arabic ST in the English TT. 
Consider the fol lowing (St John 1999: 4), some aspects of which have 
been previously discussed in this chapter: 
ě {J,} {Å} OÆ Ç.l-o ֶ { oÈ.l-o} L. 1Éi ɩ cPLL 
. Ê IËI I>.)Ì Í I  {Î.;:.} ேl..!. ை {rl..ui} 
Mohammed had lived for { many } years in a small town. It {squatted} 
{ insignificantly } at the { foot} of a towering mountain whose pale rocks 
{ touched} the sky. 
Here, of the five metaphors in the Arabic ST, three - o-'-:'.l-o, J,, and 
ڹĝ - have been toned down in the English, where they appear as the 
non-metaphorical 'many' (rather than 'extended', etc.), the stock-metaphorical 
'insignificantly' (rather than 'shamefully', etc.), and the stock-metaphorical 
'touched' (rather than 'crashed against'). The operative factor in this 
downtoning seems to be that this extract is taken from a relatively non-emotive 
section of the short story in question (in fact it is the opening sentence). In 
such a context, more direct renderings of the ST metaphors into English 
would seem unacceptably emotive. 
Another example of metaphor downtoning is provided by the fol lowing 
extract from a newspaper article by the Egyptian journalist ੱi u ;. b .0

from ÏJ U I JÐ I 2 1  Septeƫber 1982 (reproduced in transcription in

Metaphor 
159 
Here is an attempted idiomatic translation of this text. 
For any political party to succeed, it must be prepared to stand up for 
freedom of expression and human rights, to protect the weak, to oppose 
corruption, to set itself the highest standards, and to act according to these 
standards. Any party which supports and defends the people will find that 
it is supported and defended by the people. 
As we saw earlier (Ch. 5.2.1), the English translation here involves considerable 
reduction of the parallelism of the Arabic ST. The IT also, however, involves 
extreme reduction of the metaphorical elements of the ST. Thus 0 ,;, i ... I is 
translated as the non-metaphorical 'protect'. More striking is the extended 
and complex metaphor u-l! P I b ֳ I QR S! b '-:-'j  
t-il.ul .Jօ u-l!", TL.:.;JI .U u-l! 4Ɖ L-..w.c ੬ b_, ,.! ִ4 
..Jֵ I",: literally 'every party which stands beside the people, the people 
stand beside it, surrounding it when daggers are aimed at its back, and guns 
and swords at it chest'. This is translated as the non-metaphorical 'Any party 
which supports and defends the people will find that it is supported and 
defended by the people'. The only arguably metaphorical element in the 
English IT is 'stand up [for]" which is probably to be regarded as a dead 
metaphor, corresponding to the Arabic t "w (which is even more of a dead 
metaphor, if it is to be regarded as metaphorical at all). 
The metaphorical downtoning in the IT here, like the reduction in the 
degree of parallelism, reflects a general tendency for English to use less 
strongly emotive language than Arabic, particularly in texts which argue a 
strongly held belief.

Language variety and 
translation: register, 
sociolect and dialect 
12.1 BASIC PRINCIPLES 
In this chapter we look at an elusive, but important, aspect of meaning: 
characteristics in the way the message is formulated that reveal information 
about the speaker or writer. We shall call this 'speaker-related information'. 
For simplicity's sake, we shall apply the terms 'speaker' and 'listener' to 
spoken and written texts alike. 
There are two broad categories of speaker-related information that can be 
revealed through the manner, or style, in which the message is formulated. 
The first comprises things that speakers intend to reveal, notably the effect 
they want their utterances to have on the listener. The second comprises 
things that they do not necessarily intend to reveal, notably the social stereotypes 
they appear to belong to, and their regional and class affiliations. Any or all 
of these things can occur together, but, in analysing style, it is useful to keep 
them as clearly distinct as possible, because it helps the translator to pin 
down what features are textually important. 
12.2 REGISTER 
'Register' is a term used in so many different ways that it can be positively 
misleading. It is possible to isolate at least four theoretically distinct types of 
register that might be used in the analytic description of language (Hervey 
1992). For our purposes, however, these fall into two types of register which 
it is methodologically useful for translators to distinguish. 

Language variety and translation 
163 
12.2.1 Tonal register 
The first is what we shall call tonal register. This is the feature of linguistic 
expression that carries affective meaning, which we examined in Ch, 6.4. 
That is, it is the tone that the speaker takes - vulgar, familiar, polite, formal, 
etc. The affective meaning of a feature of tonal register is conveyed by a 
more or less deliberate choice of one out of a range of expressions capable of 
conveying a given literal message - compare for example . -. 0 .011 ,,4') I as 
opposed to ੠ I or (,)" ஸ I, or in English 'Would you mind being quiet' or 
'Silence please', as opposed to 'Shut up!'. As these examples suggest, the 
effect of tonal registers on listeners is something for which speakers can be 
held responsible, in so far as they are deliberately being obscene, polite, etc. 
In handling tonal register, it is clearly important for the translator accurately 
to assess where the ST expression comes on the SL 'politeness scale', and to 
render it with an expression as close as possible to a corresponding TL 
degree of politeness. But it is not enough just to have a repertoire of expressions 
capable of injecting various affective meanings into a given literal message. 
Equally important is the situation in which the expression is used: different 
sorts of social transaction - preaching in a mosque or in a church, defending 
a client in court, selling a car to a male customer, etc. - all imply different 
tonal registers. Thus at the start of a political speech in Arabic the phrase 
JǀI 01 ol.:'jl ǁWI .ǂ,J is more likely to be translated by the relatively 
formal clichÔ 'I would like to take this opportunity to say [ ... ]' than the less 
formal 'On this occasion I want to say [ ... ]' (Dickson 1999: 12). 
A case in which tonal register presents a more complex translation problem 
is the following, from a rather 'gushing' account of a visit to Morocco by a 
journalist from ஹ஺ I magazine (Boothby 1996: 101) ǃ ^IJ,J JǄ )l..i 
"LilJ I Ƌ! . . .  J.:a ,-:-,-ri-ll ǅ,Ju 'And so we do not say "adieu" to Morocco 
but "au revoir"'. Here the use of the Frenchisms in the English translation 
conveys the rather ornate and mannered nature of the original. 
A further complication is presented by the fact that the source culture and 
the target culture may have different expectations regarding the appropriate 
tonal register(s) for a given situation. As the example jj ǆ ǇJl (Ch. 
6.4) showed, it is as important to be aware of cultural differences as of 
situation. 
12.2.2 Social register 
A social register is a particular style from which the listener confidently 
infers what social stereotype the speaker belongs to. Of course, a stereotype 
by definition excludes individual idiosyncrasies of people belonging to the 
stereotype; but, however unfortunate this may be, we do tend to organize our 
interactions with other people on the basis of social stereotypes. These 

164 
Thinking Arabic translation 
stereotypes cover the whole spectrum of social experience. They range from 
broad value-judgemental labels, such as 'pompous', 'down-to-earth', 'boring', 
etc. to increasingly specific stereotypical personality-types, such as 'the 
henpecked husband', 'the six-pints-before-the-kick-off football fan', 'the 
middle-aged Guardian-reading academic', etc. In so far as each of these 
stereotypes has a characteristic style of language-use, this style is what we 
mean by social register. One important way in which social register differs 
from tonal register, therefore, is that the speaker-related information is not 
usually intentionally revealed by the speaker. Social register carries information 
about such things as the speaker's educational background, social persona 
(i.e. a social role the person is used to fulfilling), occupation and professional 
standing, and so on. 
A social register is, in other words, a style that is conventionally seen as 
appropriate to both a type of person and a type of situation. This is one 
reason why a given genre, or text-type, requires a specific style, and often a 
specific jargon. (We shall look at the question of genre in more detail in 
Chapter 13.) Selecting the appropriate style and jargon is to a great extent a 
matter of fulfilling expectations with regard to social register: selecting a 
wrong social register risks undermining the speaker's social persona as a 
credible authority on the subject. 
Clearly, in translating an ST that has speaking characters in it, or whose 
author uses social register for self-projection, a major concern is constructing 
an appropriate TL register. In purely informative texts, this is relatively 
straightforward, the main problem being to find the conventional TL style for 
the genre. The more journalistic or literary the ST, however, the greater the 
importance of characterization, and therefore of social persona. When the 
translator is operating between closely related cultures - such as two Western 
European cultures for example - it is sometimes possible to match social 
stereotypes reasonably closely - football fans, perhaps, or guests at an 
aristocratic ball, or university students. However, when the cultures are more 
distant from one another - for example British culture and Egyptian culture -
matters become more problematic. It is, for example, difficult to say what 
would be the British 'equivalent' of a peasant from southern Egypt, or of a 
populist Islamic preacher, just as one could hardly imagine the Egyptian 
equivalent of a New Age 'guru'. 
Social and tonal register are not always fully distinguishable, for two 
reasons. Firstly, it is not always clear whether a style of expression reflects 
social stereotyping or the speaker's intentions towards the listener. For some 
speakers, an utterance 'I am not prepared to put up with further prevarication' 
might be a reflection of their social status; certain highly educated older 
people in particular tend to have a social register which is consistently formal. 
For many other speakers, however, this style of language would be a function 
of tonal register; it is a form of language which they would only use when 
they were deliberately adopting a tone of formality and authority. 

Language variety and transLation 
1 65 
Secondly, characteristics of particular social registers often include features 
of tonal register. 'The boys done well' said by a football manager to a 
television interviewer after a winning match not only reflects a social persona 
of the manager as 'down-to-earth' and 'straight-speaking' ,  but is also an 
instance of a tonal register in which the manager presents himself as an 
authoritative but kindly father figure. 
In the case of Standard Arabic it is easier to identify tonal register than it 
is to identify social register. The intrinsic formality of Standard Arabic makes 
it difficult to establish clear links between the kind of language used and 
social stereotypes. In translating Standard Arabic into English, however, this 
does not mean that social register should necessarily be ignored. In order to 
achieve a form of English which is contextually acceptable, it may be necessary 
to impose a social register on the translation, even where there is no obvious 
social register in the ST. 
In cases where it is impossible to disentangle tonal and social register 
without lengthy analysis, it is acceptable for translation purposes simply to 
use 'register' as a cover-term. 
12.3 SOCIOLECT 
Whereas a social register belongs to a fairly narrowly stereotyped social 
persona, a sociolect is defined in terms of sociological notions of class. A 
sociolect is a language variety typical of one of the broad groupings that 
together constitute the 'class structure' of a society. Examples of major 
sociolects in the UK are those labelled 'urban working class', 'white collar', 
etc. However, mixed sociolectal/regional designations are often more helpful 
in recognizing language variants than purely sociological ones - e.g. 'Leith 
urban working class' ,  or 'Bermondsey urban working class' .  Further 
complications are thrown up by the often marked differences in the speech of 
men and women. 
Despite these reservations, sociolectal features can convey important 
speaker-related information. If they are salient features of the ST, the translator 
cannot ignore them when deciding on a strategy. The first crucial factor to 
consider is what their function is in the ST. So, for example, translating an 
eye-witness account of a crime for Interpol, one would very likely decide to 
subordinate sociolect to getting the facts clear. On the other hand, if sociolect 
is not incidental one might need to find a way of showing this in the TT. 
Even in such cases, however, the translator has to weigh a number of 
questions in forming a strategy: What is the function of the ST sociolect(s)? 
What is the purpose of the TT? Would it not be safest to produce a TT in a 
bland 'educated middle class' sociolect? If the strategy is to incorporate 
some TL sociolectal features corresponding to those in the ST, the requirements 
are similar to those involved in choosing social register: it has to be decided 

166 
Thinking Arabic translation 
what sociolects are the most appropriate, and there must be no inconsistencies 
in IT sociolect (assuming there are none in the ST sociolects). 
The inherent formality of Standard Arabic means that Standard Arabic 
cannot really be said to have different sociolects. Like English, however, 
colloquial Arabics do have sociolects. This means that in translating from 
Arabic to English one only needs to worry about sociolect in the ST if the ST 
is written wholly or partly in colloquial Arabic. However, as with social 
register, it may sometimes be necessary to impose a sociolect on the IT in 
order to achieve a form of English which is contextually acceptable. Where 
different colloquial Arabic sociolects are related to education, these will tend 
to be fittable into one of the three levels of LM as described in Ch. 12.4. 1. 
12.4 DIALECT 
The fourth type of speaker-related information that can be inferred from style 
concerns what part of the country speakers are from - where they grew up, 
or where they live, and so on. This inference is based on dialect, a language 
variety with features of accent, lexis, syntax and sentence formation 
characteristic of a given region. 
Marginally at least, both standard varieties of English and Standard Arabic 
can be said to have dialect forms. Thus, even in formal writing in Scotland 
'outwith' is the standard equivalent of English 'outside', American 'diaper' 
is the equivalent of British 'nappy', etc. In Standard Arabic, the word for 
'training' is &-:!ஷ (calqued on French 'formation') in North Mrica, but 
ưJƱ elsewhere. Similarly, in Morocco the normal Standard Arabic form 
for 'noon' is J I"j while in most Arab countries it is ..,r+J.;. Neologisms are 
also frequently subject to regional variation within the Arab world, as different 
forms are proposed in different countries. Thus 'mobile phone' is JIǰ in 
Saudi Arabia, JW in Kuwait, and ",L;.. in the Emirates, as well as w",..i.b 
JÇ (or JÇ ..LiLA) and J:,.L;..,.., this last being a cultural borrowing 
which is in general use. 
In many European languages, some speakers have as their own dialect the 
so-called standard language. Technically a standard language can be defined 
as a language variety which 'cut[s] across regional differences, providing a 
unified means of communication, and thus an institutionalized norm which 
can be used in the mass-media, in teaching the language to foreigners, and so 
on' (Crystal 1991: 286). In English, most educated speakers share a standard 
language, albeit with some regional influence especially in the area of 
pronunciation. 

Language variety and translation 
167 
12.4.1 Diglossia 
Arabic differs from English in that the standard language - i.e. Standard 
Arabic - is not the native language of any speakers; that is to say, nobody is 
brought up speaking Standard Arabic. Rather, everyone starts out learning 
the dialect (வஶ) of the area in which they live, and if they go on to 
achieve literacy, they subsequently learn Standard Arabic <u ,. 
0 e) in an 
educational environment. 
The language situation of Arabic is sometimes referred to as one of diglossia. 
Diglossia can be defined as a situation where two very different varieties of a 
language co-occur throughout a community of speakers, each having a distinct 
range of social functions. These varieties are felt to be alternatives by native 
speakers and usually have special names. It is customary to talk in terms of a 
high variety and a low variety, corresponding broadly to a difference in 
formality; the high variety is learnt in school, and tends to be used in religious 
contexts, on radio programmes, in serious literature, formal lectures, etc. 
Accordingly it has greater social prestige. The low variety, by contrast, is 
used in family conversations, and other relatively informal settings. 
Within the basic diglossic distinction between Standard Arabic and 
colloquial Arabic, it is possible to make further distinctions. It has been 
proposed by the Egyptian linguist EI-Said Badawi (Badawi and Hinds 1986: 
viii-ix) that, within Standard Arabic, one can distinguish between what he 
terms (i) T 1..r=J I ǈ 'Standard Arabic of the classical heritage' ,  and (ii) 
ǉ I Ǌ 'contemporary Standard Arabic'. The former is specifically 
the linguistic vehicle of the legacy of Islamic high culture and religion, 
whilst the latter is used to deal with modern culture and technology. In 
Egypt, which is the focus of Badawi' s account, T I ள I u ,. 
,0 • is little 
different from the classical descriptions of u,. ,0 e, as might be expected in 
what is now in effect a liturgical language. J o .j  I u,. 
,0 i, on the other 
hand, exhibits features which contrast with the usual classical conventions -
particularly, Badawi suggests, a marked preference for sentences beginning 
with a noun rather than a verb. When spoken, ǋ I u,. ,0 e shows other 
departures (phonological, morphological and syntactic) from the norms of 
.!JI ǌ I u ' 
0 i, most of which reflect forms found in Egypt colloquial 
Arabic. 
Badawi believes that three levels of colloquial Arabic can usefully be 
distinguished in Egypt: (i) Ę 'J I ƈl.c 'colloquial Arabic of the illiterate'; 
(ii) 0J.".:..:.11 Ǎǎ 'colloquial Arabic of the "enlightened" (i.e. literate)'; 
and (iii) ę i i 2I I I  4---ழ 'colloquial Arabic of the highly educated'. The 
mother tongue of any Egyptian child is always either ੟ 'J I ǏL.c or 
0J.,:uJ1 4-0^, depending normally on whether the child comes from a 
literate or illiterate background. If the child then goes to school, he or she 
learns and begins to function either in ல I _ (in secular schools) or 
.!JI ǐ I _ (within the religious system). Mastery of the third, acquired, 

168 
Thinking Arabic translation 
level of ශ 1 4-ෂ is restricted to a small percentage of the population. 
This level of colloquial Arabic is in effect the spoken counterpart of the 
written ற ' 1.1'" . 0 i and is used only in formal contexts between highly 
educated people or the would-be highly educated. Elsewhere, their language 
is normally 0J.".:u.ll 4-L.c, although some may also initially have been 
speakers of Ę \j 1 LM. 
The situation in other Arab countries is typically analogous to that in 
Egypt, the most important exceptions being the countries of the Maghreb -
Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco - where French is widely spoken in addition 
to Arabic (and in some areas Berber). 
It is possible that a translator will be called upon to translate material in 
an Arabic dialect; films, plays, and television soaps are all typically written 
(and performed) in dialect; informal interviews are also likely to be highly 
dialectal. In such cases there are three main potential problems. 
First, it has to be decided how important the dialect features of the ST are 
to its overall effect. In the case of an informal Arabic interview, for example, 
one is likely to want to put the TT into informal but not obviously dialectal 
English. In the case of literary works, however, e.g. where some speakers' 
speech is represented in a specific marked dialect, the translation might also 
justifiably represent this in a dialect form. 
Second, if dialect does have a function in the ST, an essential strategic 
decision is whether and why to use TL dialectal features. There are very 
obvious dangers in using TL dialect. It is likely to be a fairly arbitrary matter 
which - if any - TL dialects correspond to the ST ones. An English TL 
dialect is also likely to sound ridiculous on the lips of a Sudanese farmer, or 
a Moroccan labourer, or a Lebanese society hostess. In many cases, dropping 
ST dialect features is likely not to incur very damaging translation loss. If it 
does, but there seems no reasonable way of using dialect in the TT, the 
important ST effects produced by dialect will probably have to be rendered 
through compensation. One technique is to make occasional additions; e.g. 
'[ ... J she said in a thick Tangiers accent'. 
Sometimes, if ST dialectal features are closely associated with other features 
of language variety, it is possible to use TL sociolect or register to compensate 
for the loss of connotations carried by the ST dialect(s). 
A final, drastic possibility is wholesale cultural transplantation. This is the 
exception rather than the rule. It is generally only done with literary works, 
for commercial reasons. It often requires such extreme adaptation that it can 
barely be described as translation, however brilliant the TT may be. 
The third problem is one that applies to sociolect and register as well: 
once a decision is taken to use TL dialect, it must be accurate, and it must be 
consistent. Many literary TTs in particular are sabotaged by weaknesses in 
the translator's grasp of language variety. Among the many skills a translator 
has to have is that of pastiche. 

Language variety and translation 
169 
12.5 CODE-SWITCHING 
Finally, it must be borne in mind that many people are adept at switching 
between language varieties, and even between languages. This is known as 
code-switching. Code-switching in Arabic may be between one of the three 
levels of மய or two levels of ½ (adopting Badawi's classification), 
or between a form of ஭L.,. and a form of u'" 
. 0 i. Speakers may switch 
codes relatively unconsciously, particularly in a formal situation (such as a 
radio or television interview), and start out speaking u'" 
. 0 i, or a form of 
Arabic close to u ... 
0 i, but gradually drift into a form of Arabic more 
obviously like 4--ol.c, because they find it impossible to maintain their flow 
of speech using ஫. 
Language users may also make use of code-switching more consciously 
for social camouflage, to match their social persona to the particular situation 
they are in. Or they may use it for storytelling purposes, imitating the various 
characters in their story. Or they may use it for satirical purposes, sprinkling 
the text with expressions from different registers, sociolects or dialects. In 
this respect, consider the following from an article in the well-known Kuwaiti 
cultural magazine [ 1 about Muslims in America (Pennington 1999: 16): 
̸  ̹I 'i.?J.+.A JƩ.J I J୲ L..s: « W  J!ii ."Iw » IAA" 
L..1-U.i ' .>-41  ,,)-S"J 1 ரli:i.l l .J-A" , .r" 1  ƈ)L.,d 1 0"j.j.J 1

[ . . . ] (( \ Ƭ JS ƭ I,, ƮƯ »  
As the spokesman for the Council of Islamic Affairs in America and 
America's greatest optimist, Dr Mahdi, puts it, 'The future belongs to us' . 
When Arabs and Muslims used to tell him, 'That's impossible', his reply 
to these weak-willed characters was 'With work and patience all things 
are possible'. 
Here the use of the colloquial ¾ uL is particularly striking. As might be 
expected from a text of this kind, the entire article is otherwise written in 
Standard Arabic. And although the colloquial ஬ J..-.o represents what 
people may actually have said, and literally states that something is impossible, 
it does more than this. The use of the dialectal form also connotes an attitude 
of unconsidered negativeness - i.e. this was the kind of throwaway response 
Dr Mahdi got from people, an answer not even worth expressing in 'proper' 
(i.e. Standard) Arabic. By contrast, Dr Mahdi's attitude JS ư I" I@ 
J ] is expressed in rather elegant Standard Arabic, pointing up his 
dignified, considered and confident view of the problem. 
Since code-switching is a definite strategic device, translators have to be 
prepared to convey in the IT the effects it has in the ST. In doing this, of 
course, they are subject to the requirements and caveats that we have outlined 

170 
Thinking Arabic translation 
in discussing register, sociolect and dialect. Thus, in the example just looked 
at, the translator has not attempted to put À ந into a rather obviously 
implausible 'equivalent' English dialect form, and has equally avoided a 
more colloquial English form than 'That's impossible', such as 'No way'. 
There is, however, a degree of compensation for the use of the relatively 
neutral 'That's impossible' in the translation of ,,] Ƈ ஧ I.., J..-a..1l:a 
ன. Although 'With work and patience all things are possible' is a fairly 
direct translation of the Arabic, it also has a rather formal and even poetic 
feel to it in English (notably more so than a more workaday translation, such 
as 'Nothing's impossible if one works/you work hard', which might be more 
normal in many contexts). This maintains at least some stylistic contrast with 
the previous 'That's impossible' in the English TI, and produces a similar 
effect to that produced by the juxtaposition of colloquial and Standard direct 
speech in the Arabic. 
Code-switching is also fairly common in political speeches. It was a 
particularly prominent feature of the speeches of the late Egyptian leader 
W I ƒ J4; indeed W I ƒ is often said to have been the first 
political leader to have made wide use of colloquial Arabic in his speeches. 
Consider the following, which is taken from a speech delivered at Port Said 
on Victory Day, 23 December 1957 (cited in Holes 1993: 43; the following 
analysis is based on that of Holes). This was one year after Egypt's 
nationalization of the Suez Canal and the subsequent confrontation between 
Britain, France and Israel on the one hand, and Egypt on the other. Following 
Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal, Israel occupied Egypt up to the 
Canal under the terms of a secret agreement with Britain and France, and 
Britain and France then occupied the Canal Zone under the pretext of protecting 
the Canal. This 'tripartite aggression' was foiled by American insistence that 
Britain, France and Israel withdraw. The outcome was perceived in the Arab 
world as a great victory for Egypt, and W I చ became a central figure 
in Arab politics and the non-aligned movement of Third-World states. 
Colloquial elements in this text have been placed within curly brackets to

to indicate a hamza in Egyptian Colloquial Arabic which derives from a J in 
Classical Arabic. Where ..!,. is pronounced as V'" this is transcribed as Æ. 
Where ol is pronounced as .j, this is transcribed as .3. Except where marked in

A fairly literal translation of this (Holes 1993: 43), with English elements 
corresponding to major colloquial features of the ST in curly brackets, is as 
follows: 
Egypt, brother Egyptians, despite what we have suffered - {we are pursuing

we increase the size of the peace camp, because if the world is divided 
into two camps, one group in one camp and one in the other, there is

and working towards stabilizing and supporting peace ... {Today }, my

to the flags of ours} which we held aloft in victory and {we remember 
those flags of ours which} were soaked in blood, and go forward to the 
future to work and build for the sake of peace, to work and build to create 
a strong, liberated homeland. 
Some of the colloquial uses in this text - and particularly those which have 
not been marked up in the English IT - may be thought of as incidental, in 
the sense that they give the text a slight colloquial flavour without fully 
removing it from the realm of Standard Arabic into the realm of colloquial 
Arabic. Obvious examples are those deviations from Standard Arabic which 
involve only a slight change in pronunciation. More interesting from a stylistic 
point of view are cases in which unambiguously colloquial forms are used, 
i.e. cases where the word itself is part of colloquial Egyptian rather than part 
of Standard Arabic. Cases in point are L:....I 'we', Đ '[we] follow' (with 
the colloquial prefixê), IJJ̉ I 'today' (twice), ஜ 'we look' (four 
times), lliLଜ 
.... !l,;u_d ... Ħଊ 'of us/our' (three times), and ֭ I (twice). This text

From the point of view of producing a more idiomatic translation than the 
one given above, this presents something of a challenge. Clearly, it would 
not be appropriate to render the Arabic colloquial forms into English dialectal 
forms. It might, however, be possible to compensate in kind and place in 
various ways. For example ஛J Ǝ௱'J I .IƱL;. (S.lL.:.:. Ʋ I.lJ4-:J I 
jƳ'J I r.1A.J {S.lL.:.:. might be translated along the lines, 'Today, my friends, 
when we advocate positive neutrality, and non-alignment' with the addition 
of 'my friends' in the English to compensate for the loss of 'solidarity' in the 
use of the word 'today'. An alternative might be 'Today, when we in Egypt 
advocate positive neutrality and non-alignment', or 'Today, when we Egyptians 
.. .'. In other circumstances, other techniques might be possible; in yet others, 
it might be better to accept the translation loss without attempting any form 
of compensation.

This text is the start of an open letter written by the late King Hussein of 
Jordan in 1990, to the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein after the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait, but before the second Gulf War (between the American-led coalition 
and Iraq). In this letter, King Hussein is attempting to put himself forward as 
a possible mediator in the dispute. As subsequent parts of the letter make 
plain, King Hussein's general position is that although Iraq may have had 
legitimate grievances against Kuwait, the invasion was unacceptable, and 
Iraqi troops must fIrst withdraw from Kuwait before these can be addressed.

Textual genre as a factor 
in translation 
13.1 INTRODUCTION 
It has become clear from issues raised in earlier chapters that different STs 
require different strategic priorities. In deciding which textual variables to 
prioritize, the translator has always to ask: what is the purpose of the ST, and 
what is the purpose of the TT? These questions imply two others: what kind 
of text is the ST, and what kind of text should the TT be? The texts we have 
used as examples and in practicals illustrate the importance of these questions 
in deciding a strategy. 
At issue here is a fundamental consideration in translation: all texts are 
defined in terms of genre. By genre we mean what Hymes calls a 'type of 
communicative event' (quoted in Hervey 1992: 199) - that is, a category to 
which, in a given culture, a given text is seen to belong, and within which the 
text is seen to share a type of communicative purpose and effect with other 
texts. In this definition, the term also covers the traditionally identified genres 
of literature, and genres bearing what Baker calls 'institutionalized labels' 
such as 'journal article, 'science textbook', 'newspaper editorial' ,  or 'travel 
brochure' (Baker 1992: 1 14). 
The term 'text-type' is often used in a similar sense to 'genre'. The 
best-known classification of text-types has been that of Katharina Reiss, who 
distinguishes three, each characterized by a different function of language -
artistic and creative self-expression, conveying information, and persuading 
somebody to do something (Reiss [1977] 1989: 105-15). Snell-Hornby (1988) 
sees this classification as too limited, and suggests a much more complex 
'prototypology' - certainly too complex for our purposes. Neubert and Shreve 
(1992: 125-35) also try to get round the problem with a concept of 'prototype'. 
Yet another classification is proposed by Hatim and Mason (1990: 153-8), 
who distinguish between argumentative, expository, and instructional text-

176 
Thinking Arabic translation 
types, found functioning alongside one another as what amount to multiple 
texts within texts. (For a refined analysis of the argumentative text-type, with 
useful examples of conventional differences between Arabic and English 
argumentation, se Hatim and Mason 1997: 127-42.) 
In all these taxonomies, a decisive factor in distinguishing text-type is the 
author's intention. This is something they have in common with genre as we 
have defined it. However, in foregrounding intention, rather than event, these 
writers may be laying less stress than we do on the text as outcome, perhaps 
implying that the author's purpose and the actual effect of the text coincide, 
or that, in respects where they do not, this does not matter. From the translation 
point of view, this in turn may imply a normative assumption that there are 
certain archetypal invariants that can and should be transferred without loss 
from ST to 1L. However legitimate or illegitimate these possible inferences 
may be, the term 'text-type' is used so variously that we shall stick to 
'genre', because the element of 'event' in its definition ensures that the 
definable qualities of a text are seen as together constituting the outcome of 
an attempt to realize a particular communicative purpose. 
Most texts belong to a genre or genres. Some innovative texts arguably do 
not, when they first appear: but even these are defined by contrast with 
genres to which they do not belong. Innovative texts aside, one can say that 
any ST shares some of its properties with other texts of the same genre, and 
is perceived by an SL audience as being what it is on account of some 
genre-defining properties. Therefore, in order to assess the nature and purpose 
of the ST, the translator must have some sort of overview of genre-types in 
the source culture, and be familiar with the characteristics of relevant genres 
within those types. 
What is true of SL texts is true of 1L texts. Since the nature and purpose 
of a given text imply one another, the translator has to be as familiar with 
target-culture genre-types as with those of the source culture. Paying due 
attention to the nature and purpose of the TI guarantees a degree of TL bias 
which helps to prevent the excessive SL bias, or literalness, that so often 
defeats the stated or implied purpose of the TI. 
Consider the following ST which is taken from a 'personal opinion' column 
by ୹1 u eb ,0 a from .1.....",Y I JV I , 21 September 1982, and the two 
TIs which follow it (aspects of this have already been discussed in Ch. 5.2.1 
and Ch. 1 1.5):

Textual genre as a factor in translation 
177 
TT(a) 
It is possible for any political party to succeed if it defends the issue of 
freedom and human rights, if it embraces every unjustly treated person, if 
it opposes corruption, if it sets the highest standards in upright behaviour, 
if it changes words into deeds and promises into facts. Every party which 
stands by the people will find that the people stand by it, surrounding it 
when daggers are aimed at its back and guns and swords at its front. 
TT(b) 
For any political party to succeed, it must be prepared to stand up for 
freedom of expression and human rights, to protect the weak, to oppose 
corruption, to set itself the highest standards, and to act according to 
these standards. Any party which supports and defends the people will 
find that it is supported and defended by the people. 
Some of the ways in which TI (a) reads strangely have to do with features 
of meaning that correlate with formal differences between English and Arabic. 
Others, however, simply reflect the fact that the formal features of English in 
certain kinds of writing tend to be different from the formal features of 
Arabic, notably in respect of parallelism and metaphor. There is nothing in 
the linguistic structure of English which requires that the use of parallelism 
and metaphor in 'personal opinion' columns in English be different from 
their use in Arabic. It is simply conventional that writing of this kind in 
English does not make as dense use of these features as is normal in Arabic. 
In other kinds of writing - particularly in poetry - it would be much more 
normal for English to make wider use of them. 
In translating a 'personal opinion' text of this kind, the translator has to 
bear in mind that the conventions of English for this kind of writing are 
rather different from those for Arabic. Assuming that the intention is to 
produce an idiomatic TI, the translator must attempt at least to modify the 
IT in the direction of more typical English-language forms, as in IT (b). Of 
course, it may not always be possible to achieve a IT which reads entirely 
like an original English text. For example, an attempt to produce an entirely 
natural-sounding English text might result in unacceptable loss of message 
content. 
Since translators need to consider these genre-related questions before 
translating a text, it is useful for them to have a framework of broad genre-types. 
This will help them to identify salient generic characteristics of the ST, and 
to check the generic characteristics of the IT they are producing. We are not 
going to attempt an exhaustive typology of genres; that would be too elaborate 
for our purposes. In determining the genre of a text, the essential factor is the 
author's attitude to the treatment of the subject matter of the text. (We use 
'author' to denote the originator of the text, whether it is oral or written.) 

178 
Thinking Arabic translation 
13.2 TREATMENT OF SUBJECT MA TIER 
Subject matter in itself is not a useful criterion for describing genres, because 
the same subject matter can figure in very different genres. What is at issue 
is the author's attitude, implicit or explicit, to treatment of the subject matter. 
This attitude also includes the intention that the text should have a particular 
sort of effect on the reader or listener, and an acceptance of the probability 
or improbability of this intention being completely achieved. On this basis, 
we shall distinguish five broad categories of genre, each corresponding to a 
traditional Western categorization. 
The first category is that of literary genres. Literary genres have subdivided 
and diversified very greatly over the centuries. There are innumerable sub­
genres of poetry, fiction and drama, each with its own characteristic style. 
However, all texts in this category have two essential features. First, they 
concern a world created autonomously in and through the texts themselves, 
and not controlled by the physical world outside. However close a literary 
text is to history or autobiography, it still approaches its subject matter by 
recreating experience in terms of a subjective internal world, which is 
fundamentally perceived as fictive, for all its similarities to the world outside 
the text. Second, whatever other characteristics they have, and whatever their 
subject matter, literary texts contain features of expression, on any level of 
textual variables, that emphasize, modify or actually create features of content. 
In this respect consider the use of onomatopoeia and sound symbolism in 
the following (discussed in Ch. 4. 1): U\jJ ," jl 0 to· !J t஁ 1 ஀ 
. . Ƭ:J 1 ]L..IJ.lJ .. L....:J I. Here the words t...a..:..., U^j, and even ୿ 
are intrinsically onomatopoeic, while ]L-. I JJ is not. However, placed in a 
parallelistic context involving t..a..:..., ୾ and Uj.:ij, the word ]L.. IJJ 
acquires a quasi-onomatopoeic status; the reader is led to interpret the 
]L... IJJ not just in the sense of the whirlpool-movement of the Sufis, but 
also in the sense of whirlpools of sound. 
With their reliance on suggestion - e.g. polysemy, connotation, analogy -
literary genres illustrate very clearly the potential for discrepancy between 
intention and outcome: however carefully the author tries to control the 
reactions of the reader or listener, it is less possible than with most other 
genre-types to predict what effects the text will have. An acceptance of this 
is part of the literary author's attitude to treatment of subject matter. 
The second category comprises religious genres. In terms of the author's 
attitude, the subject matter of religious texts implies the existence of a spiritual 
world that is not fictive, but has its own external realities and truths. The 
author is understood not to be free to create the world that animates the 
subject matter, but to be merely instrumental in exploring it. This category 
has perhaps diversified less than any of the others, but, certainly in the field 
of Christianity, it still has a wide range of styles, from Authorized Version to 
'happy-clappy' . 

Textual genre as a factor in translation 
179 
In an Arabic and Islamic context, there is less diversity still, because of 
the dominance of .!.ol୽ I u:> 
0 i (cf. Ch. 12.3.1) in a religious context. 
However, even here, there will be linguistic differences between a religious 
text aimed at scholars and one aimed at the general public. And in the case of 
a sermon (୼) in a mosque, with a perhaps partially illiterate congregation, 
the preacher often makes some use of colloquial Arabic. 
The third category comprises philosophical genres. These have as their 
subject matter a 'world' of ideas. Pure mathematics is the best example of 
the kind of subject matter that defines philosophical genres. Even in the field 
of metaphysics, however original the text, the author is understood not to be 
free to develop theoretical structures at will, but to be constrained by some 
standard of rationality. Philosophical genres have not proliferated as much as 
literary ones, but they are strikingly diverse nonetheless. 
The fourth category is that of empirical genres. Genres in this category 
purport to deal with the real world as it is experienced by observers. An 
empirical text is more or less informative, and it is understood to take an 
objective view of observable phenomena. Scientific, technological and many 
scholarly texts fall into this category. It thus goes on diversifying into new 
genres and sub-genres as new scientific and academic disciplines are created. 
Finally, there is the category of persuasive genres. The essence of these 
genres is that they aim at getting listeners or readers to behave in prescribed 
or suggested ways. This aim can be pursued through various means: we are 
classifying in a single category the entire gamut of texts from instruction 
manuals, through laws, rules and regulations, to propaganda leaflets, newspaper 
opinion columns and editorials, and advertisements. The indefinite number 
of genres and sub-genres in this category have a common purpose, that of 
getting an audience to take a certain course of action, and perhaps explaining 
how to take it. 
13.3 ORAL AND WRITTEN TEXTS 
Another factor in determining genre is the question of whether the text is oral 
or written. Each of the five genre-categories includes both oral and written 
texts. In practice, however, it is almost impossible not to distinguish an oral 
text as belonging to a discrete oral genre, and a written text as belonging to a 
discrete written genre, even where the texts share the same subject matter: 
the difference in medium generally entails a difference in attitude to treatment 
of the subject matter. A spoken ୻ about social problems in Egypt, a talk 
on the history of Arab nationalism, a tutorial explanation on quarks - each is 
a different genre from any kind of written reflection on the topic. A complicating 
factor is that many oral genres also involve written texts: songs, plays, sermons, 
lectures, a salesman's patter - all may be performed on the basis of a written 
text that is either read out, or spoken from memory, or used as the basis for 

180 
Thinking Arabic translation 
improvization. To get an idea of the significance of these factors for translation, 
it is helpful first to look at some of the specific characteristics of oral texts as 
distinct from written ones. 
An oral text is in essence a fleeting and unrepeatable event. This has 
important implications. First, vocal utterance is usually accompanied by visual 
cues, such as gestures or facial expressions, that are secondary to it but do 
form part of the overall text and can play a role in creating its meaning. 
Second, on every level of textual variable, effective oral texts avoid information 
overload, elaborate cross-referencing, excessive speed, and so on, because 
these can make the text hard to follow. Naturally, in all these respects, what 
is true for oral STs is true for oral TIs as well. 
A third implication of orality is the appearance of spontaneity that often 
characterizes oral texts. This goes not only for impromptu conversation or 
narrative, but also for prepared texts, such as memorized lines in a play. An 
oral text is always very different in nature and impact from even the most 
closely corresponding written version. 
An awareness of these properties of oral texts is a necessary starting-point 
for translating an oral ST into an oral TI. Spoken communication has 
characteristics that are very much language-specific. Oral translation is not 
simply a matter of verbal transposition: the genre-related techniques of the 
target culture must be respected as well, including gestures, facial expressions, 
and so on. Translating a joke, for instance, will generally involve different 
genres from conference interpreting. Both, however, make it clear that an 
oral text in any genre is not only an utterance, but also a dramatic performance. 
Except in most forms of interpreting (which is a specialized skill, and is 
not part of this course), translators actually do a great deal of their work in a 
written medium, even if it involves an oral text or texts. Inevitably, 
metamorphoses result from the crossover from written to oral and vice versa. 
These metamorphoses are essentially due to the fact that writing is such a 
pale copy of speech in terms of expressive force. Crossover in the process of 
translation may take a number of forms. We shall mention four. 
In the first type of crossover, the translator starts with an oral ST, and 
then uses a written transcript to compose a IT which is on paper, but suitable 
for oral performance. Song lyrics are typically translated in this way. In the 
second type of crossover, the translator starts with a written ST, considers 
how it might be performed orally, and then composes a IT which is on 
paper, but suitable for oral performance: this is generally how plays are 
translated. Third, the translator may start with a written script, try out the ST 
orally, and then produce a TI suitable either for silent reading, or for oral 
performance, or for both. Poetry is usually translated like this. In the fourth 
type, a translator starts with an oral ST and its transcript, and produces a IT 
for silent reading: this is how film subtitles are generally produced. 

Textual genre as afactor in translation 
1 8 1  
Consideration of the two factors we mentioned at the outset - the author's 
attitude to treatment of the subject matter, and whether the text is an oral or a 
written one - concentrates the translator's mind on four groups of vital 
strategic questions. (1) What are the salient features of the ST? What do 
these features imply about its purpose? What genre or genres do the features 
and purpose suggest it belongs to? (2) Does the ST have recognizable genre­
specific characteristics that require special attention? If so, which of them 
should be retained in translation? (3) What TL genre(s) provide a match for 
the ST genre? What do existing specimens of these TL genres suggest regarding 
formulation of the TT? (4) What genre(s) should the TT ultimately be couched 
in, and what genre-specific features should it have? 
Two words of caution are needed here. First, it is easy for student translators 
to begin their strategic considerations something like this: 'This text belongs 
to genre A, therefore it has characteristics x, y and z.' This is putting the cart 
before the horse. It is much more useful to identify the text's characteristics 
first, and then, on that basis, to assign it to a genre. This results in a more 
sensitive appraisal of the true purpose of the text, which in turn makes it 
easier to be flexible and to recognize cases where, as very often happens, the 
ST actually has a blend of features - it may be predominantly typical of one 
genre, but also have features from other genres or even other genre categories. 
So, for example, instruction manuals may vary in character between the 
empirical and the persuasive categories. Advertising commonly shares features 
with literary texts, as do religious and philosophical texts. The same is true 
of some empirical texts, such as Goethe's scientific work in verse, or the 
4.;.iJl of dJL. ĕ I  (d. 1273), which is a pedagogical text on Arabic grammar 
arranged in the form of 100 poetic verses. Religious texts often share features 
with persuasive texts. Many legal or administrative texts - contracts or 
memoranda of agreement, for instance - combine empirical and persuasive 
genre-features. Texts often contain quotations from texts that belong to other 
genres. 
Such 'hybridization' in genre is common in joumalism, and in parody and 
satire, which can make wholesale use of a mixture of features from various 
genre categories. Such blends may theoretically constitute SUb-genres, but 
that is not our concern: our aim here is to encourage and enable students to 
isolate the salient features and the purpose of an ST, so that they can relate 
these to the purpose of the IT and thus be in a position to develop an 
appropriate translation strategy on the basis of these things. 
The second word of caution is that it is absolutely essential for translators 
to be familiar with the characteristic features of the TL genre or genres that 
they decide correspond most closely to the ST genre(s). If in doubt, examine 
sample texts from the chosen TL genre before starting the translation. 
Professional translators tend to specialize in particular fields, and one of the 
first things they do is acquire an awareness of relevant TL genre characteristics.

Translating technical 
texts 
14. 1 INTRODUCTION 
All texts can be characterized in terms of genre. Therefore there is no a priori 
reason for giving special attention to any one genre rather than any other. 
However, since most language students are not trained in a technical specialism, 
they are often in awe of more or less 'technical' texts. This is why we are 
devoting a whole chapter to the main translation issues they raise. 
The term 'technical' is not confined to natural science and technology. 
Any specialist field has its own technical terms and its own genre-marking 
characteristics: a look at a hobbies magazine, a review of the rock scene, or 
the City pages and the sports section of the paper, is enough to confirm this. 
Texts in these and any other specialized fields are properly speaking 'technical' 
texts. It is simply to avoid repeating the cumbersome 'natural-scientific and 
technological' that we shall be applying the term 'technical' to texts written 
in the context of natural-scientific or technological disciplines. 
14.2 LEXICAL PROBLEMS IN TECHNICAL TRANSLATION 
By definition, technical texts tend to be relatively inaccessible to the 
non-specialist reader. There are both lexical and conceptual reasons for this 
inaccessibility. Lexical problems arise from the use of the following three 
types of ST terms: 
1. Technical terms which are totally unfamiliar to the lay translator, because 
they are only used in technical contexts; 
2. Technical terms which are familiar to the translator because they are also 
used in non-technical contexts, but which look as if they are being used in 

Translating technical texts 
1 85 
some technically specialized way in the ST; 
3. Technical tenns which are familiar to the translator because they are also 
used in non-technical contexts, but which do not obviously look as if they 
are being used in some technically specialized way in the ST. 
All three of these lexical reasons can be illustrated from the following text, 
which is taken from a Syrian medical textbook, with following English 
translation (adapted from AI-Muhammad 1993: 205-9). Relevant lexical items 
have been placed in curly brackets; the superscript number before the closing 
bracket refers to the type of problem ( 1-3), as identified above, and the 
symbol 0 is used to indicate translation by omission:

Skin tests 
These tests are necessary for the study and investigation of some { allergicl }  
skin reactions. They are conducted in order to specify and diagnose the 
{allergenic·} or hannful substances, as for examĉle in the case of {contact2} 
eczema, especially { occupational2}, in {chronic } { urticaria·}, and in food 
or druĊ { allergies·} ,  or in { sensitivitiesl }  to { bacteria3 }, { funge}, or 
{yeasts } and their products. 

186 
Thinking Arabic translation 
Cutaneous reactions 
These reactions are built on the {sensitivity } of all skin layers, i.e. both 
{ epidennall } and { dennall } layers ({ Malpighian 1 cells}, and {intradennal 
cells' }and the { basal ceU layer }). 
Methodology 
First the skin is cleaned with { spirif} and dried, then a { scratch3 } is 
made using a { 01 }  {vaccinostylel } so that no bleeding is caused. Then, 
the substance which is to be tested is applied to the {scratch3} (as in a 
smallpox vaccination). Simultaneous֗, a {controf } test should be carried 
out close to the area of the {scratch } .  The result is read after 24 or 48 
hours. 
There are a fair number of Type 1 lexical problems in the ST. Examples are:

epidermis; cuticle; skin; complexion' ; a 
translator might, therefore, be able to guess 
that (.S,J.,) 
.'j, ! is a technical tenn for 
'epidermal' in this context. 
AlthouÊh gJ1 is not given by Wehr, iJ1

The reference is to the layers that constitute 
the dermis (skin) itself.

discovered from specialist sources.

0 as meaning

strictly a technical term, 'occupational' 
seems a more appropriate adjective to apply 
to eczema contracted

environment. 
Both 'fungi' and 'mushrooms' are given 
by Wehr as translations of ֖. (Wehr 
does not in fact list the plural fonn Jǔ' 
but the translator could probably guess 
this.) The translator would need to be aware 
here, however, that the hyperonym 'fungi' 
is intended here, rather than the hyponym 
'mushrooms' . 
'Leaven; ferment; barm, yeast; enzyme' 
are all given by Wehr as translations of 
bJ ': 0 ;. (Wehr does not in fact list the 
plural form ..:. I୙, but the translator 
could probably guess this). The translator 
would need to be aware that 'yeasts' is 
intended here, rather than 'enzymes', for 
example.

Type 3 lexical problems are the most dangerous, because the translator can

used here in a technical sense which is not immediately apparent in the 
context.

'Bacteria' is a technical term; 'germs' is 
an imprecise lay term.

could well mislead the translator here into 
thinking the term Loll is being used in a

guessed that this is a technical usage from 
the use of :i

Wehr gives ô1 to mean 'ether'. 
Wehr gives vt୕ as meaning 'scratch, 
scratch mark; graze, abrasion'. The term 
is used here in the sense of 'scratch', a 
specific technique used in vaccination and 
skin tests. 
See previous note. 
14.3 CONCEPTUAL PROBLEMS IN TECHNICAL TRANSLATION 
Conceptual problems in technical translation arise from ignorance of underlying 
knowledge taken for granted by experts, but not understood by non-specialists 
and not explicit in the ST. Here are three examples from the Syrian medical 
text. 
food allergy 
c,?1.."..J 1 [t;:.;'YI] drug [allergy] 
The standard term in English is 'skin tests'. 
A form such as 'cutaneous tests' conveys 
the sense in English but is not the normal 
form used; it would suggest a translator 
who is not sure of the field. 
Wehr gives c,?l.l as meaning 'alimental, 
alimentary, nutritional, nutritious, 
nutritive'. A form such as 'nutritional 
allergy' is at best ambiguous, but would 
certainly suggest a non-specialist 
translator. 
Wehr gives ֕ I.."J as meaning 'medicinal, 
medicative, curative' ( I.."J is listed as 
meaning 
'remedy, 
medicament, 
medication, 
medicine, 
drug ' ) .  
'MedicinaVcurative allergy' amounts to a 
contradiction in terms, and implies a 
translator ignorant of the field. 
As these examples suggest, conceptual problems are the most intractable of 
all those that face the technical translator. Non-specialists are always likely 
to reach a conceptual impasse from which no amount of attention to syntax 
or vocabulary can rescue them. In that case they have only two options: to 
learn the concepts of the field in which they wish to translate, or work in 

Translating technical texts 
1 89 
close consultation with experts. In practice, trainee translators generally do 
both these things, quickly becoming experts themselves with the help of 
specialist supervisors. 
14.4 LEGALITY AND ACCURACY 
These remarks about the need for consultation are not to be taken lightly. 
They raise the important question of the responsibility - and perhaps the 
legal liability - of the translator. There is a difference here between literary 
translation and technical translation. It is not that literary translators are not 
held responsible for their work, but the implications of mistranslation are 
generally less serious for them than for technical translators, where one 
mistake could cause financial damage or loss of life and limb. This is another 
respect in which technical translation is exemplary, bringing out extremely 
clearly a golden rule which is in fact essential to all translation: never be too 
proud or embarrassed to ask for help or advice. 
The spectre of legal liability is a reminder that even the minutest error of 
detail on any level of textual variables is typically magnified in a technical 
text. A good example is the danger of confusing closely similar technical 
names in chemistry. Consider how similar are some of the prefixes and 
suffixes that can be attached to the root 'sulph', and how many possible 
permutations of them there are: 
per­
bi-
de­
hypo­
hydro- { 
suI ph } 
-ate 
-ide 
-ite 
-onate 
Obviously, the slightest error in affixation here will be a major factual error, 
whereas, in non-technical language, affixation may sometimes be a matter of 
style. For instance, there is generally little difference in practice between 
'disbelieving' and 'unbelieving', or between 'inexcusable' and 'unexcusable', 
while 'dissociate' and 'disassociate' are synonyms of one another. In literary 
texts, the choice between affixes can often be based on euphony or style. But 
with technical terms in specialist texts of any kind, that temptation must be 
resisted absolutely. 
Some parts of technical texts may be formulated in mathematical symbols. 
These normally need minimal effort in translation, although they cannot 
always be literally transcribed. Careful attention must be paid to any differences 
between SL and 1L conventions. For example, where English has a decimal 
point in figures, Arabic has a comma. 

190 
Thinking Arabic translation 
The technical translator's paramount concerns, then, are accuracy and 
conformity with the requirements of genre. In so far as the requirements of 
genre imply style, register is also important: the wrong tonal register may 
alienate the reader and undermine confidence in the IT; the wrong social 
register may misrepresent a social persona that the ST author has been at 
pains to project. 
The relationship between accuracy and style is not always straightforward, 
however. If an ST is badly written or ungrammatical, should these infelicities 
be reflected in the IT, or should they be ironed out? This is a general and 
controversial issue. In our view, translators are not in principle responsible 
for 'improving' defective STs. However, this is sometimes necessary with 
technical texts (as indeed with any purely informative text), because the 
crucial thing is factual accuracy. If there is any potentially misleading or 
dangerous ambiguity or obscurity in the ST, there is every reason to keep it 
out of the IT - if necessary after consultation with the author or an expert. 
14.5 GENERIC FEATURES OF ENGLISH TECHNICAL TEXTS 
Before embarking on the Practical, it will be useful to sharpen awareness of 
technical genres by noting some of the characteristics of technical texts in 
English. We shall take as an example text a British medical text on bacillary 
dysentery (AI-Muhammad 1993: 18 1-2). 
Bacillary dysentery 
The bacilli belong to the genus Shigella of which there are three main 
pathogenic groups, dysenteriae, flexneri, and sonnei, the first two having 
numerous serotypes. In Britain the majority of cases of bacillary dysentery 
are caused by Shigella sonnei although in recent years there has been a 
significant increase in imported infections caused by Sh. flexneri whereas 
sonnei dysentery has decreased. 
Epidemiology 
Bacillary dysentery is endemic all over the world. It occurs in epidemic 
form wherever there is a crowded population with poor sanitation, and 
thus has been a constant accompaniment of wars and natural catastrophes. 
Spread may occur by contaminated food or flies but contact through 
unwashed hands after defecation is by far the most important factor. 
Hence the modem provision of hand basins, disposable towels and hot air 
driers goes a long way towards the prevention of the faecal-oral spread of 
disease. 
Outbreaks occur in mental hospitals, residential schools and other 
closed institutions. The disease is notifiable in Britain. 
Pathology 
There is inflammation of the large bowel which may involve the lower 
part of the small intestine. 

Translating technical texts 
191 
Sigmoidoscopy shows that the mucosa is red and swollen, the submucous 
veins are obscured and the mucopus is seen on the surface. Bleeding 
points appear readily at the touch of the endoscope. Ulcers may form. 
Clinical features 
There is great variety in severity. Sonne infections may be so mild as to 
escape detection and the patient remains ambulant with a few loose stools 
and perhaps a little colic. Flexner infections are usually more severe 
while those due to dysenteriae may be fulminating and cause death within 
48 hours. In a moderately severe illness, the patient complains of diarrhoea, 
colicky abdominal pain and tenesmus. 
The stools are usually small, and after the first few evacuations, contain 
blood and purulent exudate with little faecal material. There is frequently 
fever, with dehydration and weakness if the diarrhoea persists. 
On examination there will be tenderness over the colon more easily 
elicited in the left iliac fossa. In sonne infection the patient may develop 
a febrile illness and diarrhoea may be mild or even absent; there is 
usually some headache and muscular aching. Arthritis or iritis may 
occasionally complicate bacillary dysentery as in Reiter's disease. 
Diagnosis depends on culture of faeces. 
The following are typical features of technical texts in English: 
1. The language is usually informative. Thus, although the Bacillary dysentery 
text deals with a rather nasty and potentially fatal disease, there is little in 
it which expresses the emotional feelings of the writer towards the disease. 
As Pinchuk notes, 'the controlled language of science is manipulated in 
the direction of insipidity and colourlessness' (Pinchuk 1977: 165). Perhaps 
the only phrase in the text with some emotional charge is 'a constant 
accompaniment of wars and natural catastrophes', in section 2. Here an 
emotional effect is achieved - whether deliberately or not - by the rhythm 
of the phrase, and alliteration and assonance. 
2. An impersonal style is used. Accordingly, the following features 
are likely to be encountered: 
a. The subjects of sentences are likely to be abstract. Thus, in section 
2 of the Bacillary dysentery text, the subjects of the sentences are: 
'Bacillary dysentery', 'It' (used to refer back to 'Bacillary dysentery' 
in sentence 1), 'Spread', 'the modern provision', 'Outbreaks', 'The 
disease' . 
b. The passive is likely to be extensively used. Thus in section 1 of 
Bacillary dysentery, we find 'are caused by' and 'caused by'. In section 
3, we find 'is seen' and 'are obscured'. There are also many examples 
of verbs which are passive-like in Bacillary dysentery, in that their 
subjects are not the agents (or 'doers') of an action, as is typical of 
subjects of active verbs in English. Examples in section 1 are 'belong 
to', 'has ben'; in section 2 'occur(s)' (three times); in section 3 'involve', 
'appear', 'may form'. In accounts of experiments or research 

192 
Thinking Arabic translation 
programmes, the passive is used extensively. The use of passive or 
passive-like verbs focuses attention on the effect or result rather than 
on the person performing the action. 
4. Where texts involve procedures performed by human beings in particular, 
formulations of cause and effect are normal, reflecting the importance of 
the logic and development of such texts. Cause and effect formulations 
may include connectives such as 'consequently', 'hence' and 'thus', verbs 
such as 'cause', 'determine' and 'result in', and the use of 'by + -ing' to 
signal method. There are some examples in the Bacillary dysentery text: 
in section 1 'caused by', 'are caused by' ; in section 2 'thus', 'hence'; and 
in section 4 'due to', 'cause' . However, in general, Bacillary dysentery 
follows a pattern more typical of purely descriptive technical texts, in 
which sentences begin with subjects, and relations between sentences are 
often not marked by any connectives. 
As a rule, technical translation into English requires economy of 
language, precision and clarity, and clear use of standard cohesion markers, 
such as 'moreover', 'likewise', 'however', etc. 
5. Nominalization is common. There are numerous examples in the Bacillary 
dysentery text, including: in section 1 '[a significant] increase' (contrast 
the use of 'decreased' later in the same section); in section 2 'population', 
'accompaniment' , 'spread', 'provision', 'Outbreaks'. As Pinchuk notes, 
'The nominalized style is easier to write and its impersonality avoids 
commitment to tense, unlike the conversational style' (Pinch uk 1977: 
165). 
6. Compound nouns are also a feature of many technical texts. Examples in 
the Bacillary dysentery text: in section 1 'sonnei dysentery'; in section 2 
'hand basins', 'hot air driers' (cf. also 'oral-faecal spread'); in section 3 
'bleeding points'; in section 4 'Sonne infections'. 
14.6 INFORMATION SOURCES 
Pinchuk (1977: 246-5 1) points out that before embarking on a translation it 
is important to ascertain whether the work has already been translated. He 
provides a list of organizations which have registers of available translations, 
including Aslib (The Association of Special Libraries and Information 
Bureaux). And of course technical translation, like translation in any genre, 
requires familiarity with ST and TL material of a similar type, to serve as a 
source of information and as a stylistic model. Translators may well need 
some time to find the information (e.g. concepts or lexis) they are seeking. 
Useful sources of information include monographs, abstracting and indexing 
journals, encyclopedias, standards and trade journals, theses, and dissertations. 
Most of these sources are available in paper form, but increasingly electronic 
sources, such as material on the World Wide Web, are coming to be used for 

Translating technical texts 
193 
up-to-date technical information. Some organizations, like the European 
Commission, keep databases containing centrally agreed translations of 
technical expressions. These databases are continually added to, and translators 
are expected to conform to the agreed renderings, in the interests of 
organization-wide consistency and clarity. Other sources may be found in 
specific countries. An example is the Saudi-based BASIM (Ž୓,  ୔,  
d ,. , L . n a II <S.l ʠ. 
-
An examination of technical translations reveals that, apart from the lexical, 
conceptual and stylistic problems outlined above, technical translation is not 
essentially different from most other sorts of prose translation: as long as 
specialist help can be called on, there is no reason why anyone should not 
confidently tackle technical translation in any field.

Contextual in/oTmLltion 
The article, written by J..a-..!... .1-0z ਷,  and entitled £.) 'i '  J.' .. i '" a ,  
comes from a 1993 edition (no. 418) of the Kuwaiti magazine I,f'"!y "  which 
is aimed at the general educated reader and covers cultural and scientific 
topics. This is not a piece of technical translation. However, the text contains 
some technical and semi-technical environmental terms, and therefore provides 
practice in dealing with lexical problems related to technical translation. 
The Arabic text begins in mid-sentence. It is talking about an environmental 
programme drawn up at the 1992 earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, 
designed to involve local communities in sustainable development. Begin 
your translation with a new sentence, starting 'This programme is designed 
to run [ ... ]'. The phrase 01 ^ which begins the second clause on line 1 of 
the text has the sense 'although' , 'however' . The text is taken from Evans 
(1996: 13).

constitutional texts 
15.1 DEFINITION 
By a constitution we mean an agreed set of principles and rules by which an 
organization is run. Constitutional texts are thus a sub-type of legal or quasi­
legal text, and include all kinds of constitutions, ranging from those of 
international organizations and states to those of sports and social clubs. 
They also include communiques, statements, etc. which have the general 
form of constitutions, as described below. Constitutional texts therefore offer 
an accessible introduction to some of the more general problems of legal 
translation. 
15.2 GENERAL STRUCTURE 
Typical constitutional texts can be divided into two parts: an optional preamble, 
followed by the main text. 
15.2.1 Preamble 
The preamble does not form part of the constitution as such, and therefore 
does not have the same legal status as the constitution itself. However, it 
presents the rationale for and/or situation of the proclamation of the constitution. 
The normal Arabic translation of 'Preamble' is L....I-.i..l l. It is common in 
English to have a preamble without a title line 'Preamble'. The Constitution 
of the United States, for example, begins 'WE THE PEOPLE OF THE 
UNITED STATES, IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION 
[ ... J'. The Constitution of India, by contrast, uses the title 'PREAMBLE' 

Translating constitutional texts 
197 
followed by the opening statement, 'We, the People of India, having solemnly 
resolved to constitute India into a Sovereign Democratic Republic [ . .. ]'. 
Preambles often begin with a first-person plural subject 'We' followed by 
a parenthetical statement of who is making the constitution. The United 
States constitution, for example, has as its preamble: 
WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, IN ORDER TO FORM 
A MORE PERFECT UNION, ESTABLISH JUSTICE, INSURE 
DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY, PROVIDE FOR THE COMMON 
DEFENSE, PROMOTE THE GENERAL WELFARE, AND 
SECURE THE BLESSINGS OF LIDERTY TO OURSELVES AND 
OUR POSTERITY, DO ORDAIN AND ESTABLISH THIS 
CONSTITUTION FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 
The preamble to the Indian Constitution is as follows: 
We, the People of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India 
into a Sovereign Democratic Republic and to secure to all its citizens: 
Justice, social, economic and political; 
Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; 
Equality of status and opportunity; 
and to promote among them all 
Fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity of the 
Nation; 
In our Constituent Assembly this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, 
do hereby Adopt, Enact and Give to Ourselves this Constitution. 
The Jordanian Constitution is introduced by the following (which is perhaps 
technically not to be regarded as a preamble, having rather the form of a 
royal decree commanding the putting into effect of the constitution: this is 
known in Arabic as a ̒4=J): 
̓4.J 1 ̔Jj':ll il..J.1 <!.1L J,,':II J)l.b ż

The English translation of this reads: 
We Talal the First 
King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan 
In accordance with Article 25 of the Constitution, 
and in pursuance of the resolution of 
the Sena te and House of Deputies, 
do hereby give my assent to 
this revised Constitution 
and command that it be put into effect 

198 
Thinking Arabic transLation 
All three of these texts employ a number of devices which are typical of 
preambles. The main verb plus other elements dependent on the main verb 
are placed at the end of the preamble, while the middle section of the preamble 
consists of subordinate phrases (in some cases subordinate clauses). Preambles 
typically involve forms of structural parallelism. 
Thus, in the American constitution there is a series of verb-object (or 
verb-prepositional phrase) pairs in which the object is further defined (in 
most cases by an adjective, and in one case by a genitive 'of'-phrase): i.e. (i) 
'form a more perfect union'; (ii) 'insure domestic tranquility'; (iii) 'provide 
for the common defense'; (iv) 'promote the general welfare'; (v) 'secure the 
blessings of liberty'. 
Arabic preambles may also contain subordinate phrases, such as the 
phrasesb.).;A La 	 J .)..JI U-o IJ L;JI o.JU I (.S .;.-.ia: 
'":-' I.,.:J I J uୃ 'i I I ,u I? • in the Jordanian example. Arabic materials of this 
kind may also contain combinations of subordinate clauses and complete 
sentences. The following is from a preamble to a Christian-Muslim summit 
in Lebanon at the start of the period of the Lebanese civil war:

As the material put in curly brackets indicates, the Arabic text utilizes a 
combination of main verbs (main clauses) and subordinate phrases to pick 
out the main points of importance in this 'preamble' section. The following 
are the start of main clauses: ୆.rl l ...... UI I".....) I ´J (paragraph 2);

Here is a possible English translation of this extract: 
Through God's providential concern for Lebanon and its people, the 
leaders of the Lebanese confessional groups have been led to hold the 
first of their meetings in two sessions, a morning session in Bakirki and 
an afternoon session in the Islamic Dar Al-Futuwwa. 
(Having given careful consideration to the tragic events } which have 
befallen the country, and the dangers which not only jeopardize its unity 
and independence, and the well-being of its citizens, but also pose a 
grave threat to other Arab states and to the Palestinian cause: 
(Having noted that these events } have started to become increasingly 
sectarian in nature, that outrages have been perpetrated against innocent 
people, and that sacrilegious attacks have been carried out in the name of 
religion against churches and mosques and men of religion, thus threatening 
Lebanon's political structure and its unique cultural constitution: 
(Having discussed this situation in a responsible manner} ,  and (having 
determined to pursue their joint meetings in the centres of the various 
Lebanese confessional groups}, they do hereby draw up a plan of action 
and establish a monitoring committee, and at the end of their first day of 
meetings, issue the following statement: 
The English translation involves greater use of parallel subordinate clauses 
than the Arabic original. The main verb phrase beginning paragraph 2 in the 
Arabic :.i 
.' .! -.;-1 1 c.r""UI I""""'J1..w ̺J is transferred into the English 
subordinate phrase 'Baving given careful consideration to the tragic events' 
(paragraph 2). The main verb phrase beginning paragraph 3 in the Arabic 
(J"'"U 1 .l.A 01 I,.,.J;... ')' J is transferred into the English subordinate phrase 
'Having noted that these events' (paragraph 3). The Arabic subordinate phrase 
beginning paragraph 4 JJ,;..-..J.I .զ!", .' I I  ̻J is retained as a subordinate 
phrase 'Having discussed this situation in a responsible manner' (paragraph 
4). However, the subsequent Arabic main verb phrase vk r j..A.1 1 IJ.l-LcJ 
̼̽ 1 r-t='ʄ 1 ̾l.:a.. (paragraph 4) is also converted in the English 
translation into a subordinate phrase 'having determined to pursue their joint 
meetings', with the result that the verb of the main clause does not occur in 
the English translation until 'they do hereby draw up a plan of action', i.e. 
the translation of the Arabic Æ b L.; • I̿JJ (paragraph 4). That is to 
say, from the second paragraph onwards everything before this in the English 
translation is some part of a subordinate clause; and the second to fourth 
paragraphs of the translation constitute three parallel subordinate clauses 
(with further forms of parallelism within each). 
As the previous example suggests, it seems more necessary in English 
than in Arabic to maintain a structure in preambles either of the type: 
1 .  SUBJECT - SUBORDINATE ELEMENTS - MAIN CLAUSE (as 
exemplified in the American Constitution) 
or of the type: 

200 
Thinking Arabic translation 
2. SUBORDINATE ELEMENTS - MAIN CLAUSE (as exemplified in the 
English translation of L)l.. = I 4.!, .! 
1 " II (",.jJ I 0ା) 
Arabic texts may have a preamble which involves a series of subordinate 
elements followed by a main clause. A good example is the following, which 
is the beginning of a proclamation issued by R.l-=o. = I ਦē the Commander 
of the Beirut Region and 'Provisional Military Ruler' of Lebanon on 1 1  
March 1976. 
ƏƐ 1.j1.i.:,1}., {ʅʆ 1 +I ਣI bJI., ʇ1 bʈ."J Ijl.i.:,l}

֊.,֋  U)lb.:.I}." , {ʏʐI &%I,, <.!ਠ  "!""-,":,}" 
: u-=;t Lo J,;il {ʑJL:J I" til l  rLo I 
Here, each of the phrases in curly brackets is a subordinate (adverbial) phrase 
(only one of which, (.ʒ l  IJJI ʓ.j ..u U';.IJIʔ *l.S U, is a clause). 
This is followed at the end by the main verb ';,;il, with its object u-=;'ଽ Lo. 
It is also common, however, to find Arabic preambles whIch involve 
repeated use of complete sentences, frequently introduced by the emphatic 
particles ..u (or ..L.£J) followed by a perfect verb, or ::,! followed by a noun or 
pronoun. In such cases, the translator would almost certainly be forced to 
adopt a style in which the preamble consisted of a number of separate sentences, 
despite the typical preference for preambles in English to consist of a single 
sentence with numerous parallel subordinate clauses. 
15.2.2 Main text 
15.2.2.1 Subdivisions 
The main text may be broken up into subdivisions. The largest subdivision is 
that of the 'Part'. This typically corresponds in Arabic to Rl:a. In the Lebanese 
Constitution, for example, the Arabic ʕL...I rƧi - J,,'൫ I RL:a-J I is 
translated into English as 'PART I - FUNDAMENTAL PROVISIONS'. 
Within each Part, there may be a number of Chapters; Chapter in English 
corresponds to ଼ in Arabic. The Lebanese Constitution has as its first 
Chapter within its first Part I • .! .01)." U ".l.l l u-i - J" 'Y I ଻ I. This is 
translated into English as 'CHAPTER I - "THE STATE AND ITS 
TERRITORY'. The basic unit of the main text is the Article. The first article 
of the Jordanian Constitution reads as follows: 

Translating constitutional texts 
201

օ <"r.''-:U Ɔ ʚI rlJ.i.:." ʛM I t..,YI 0-O Ė੝ ,JJYI

This is translated into English as: 
I. 
The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is an independent Arab State. It 
is indivisible and no part of it may be ceded. The people of Jordan 
fonn part of the Arab nation. The form of Government shall be 
parliamentary with hereditary monarchy. 
It is usual, as in this example, for the articles to be introduced as - , .JU I 
(etc.). In English-language constitutions, however, the word 'Article' does 
not always appear, and the number of the article is followed by a full stop. 
It is possible for articles themselves to have sub-clauses. These may also 
be introduced by numbers, as in the following example from the Jordanian 
Constitution. 
.il..l l )-:,J 0-0 ,JJI JʝI j..H'-:' Y - , - "  .JUI

This is translated into English as:

(i) 
No Jordanian shall be exiled from the territory of the Kingdom. 
(ii) 
No Jordanian shall be prevented from residing at any place, 
or be compelled to reside in any specified place, except in the 
circumstances prescribed by law. 
As this example shows, 'secondary' numbers in Arabic are typically translated 
into English as Roman numerals in round brackets (each of these numbers 
refers to what is known technically as a 'paragraph' in English, .ସ in 
Arabic). 
Articles in Arabic may also contain further sub-clauses in addition to 
those labelled with numbers. The following is an example from the Jordanian 
Constitution.

It is the right of every citizen to work, and the State shall 
provide opportunities to work to all citizens by directing the 
national economy and raising its standard. 
(ii) 
The State shall protect labour and enact a legislation therefore 
based on the following principles : -
(a) 
Every workman shall receive wages commensurate with the 
quantity and quality of his work. 
(b) 
The number of hours of work per week shall be limited. 
Workmen shall be given weekly and annual days of rest with 
wages. 
As this example shows, further sub-clauses in Arabic, labelled - 1, - '":-' etc., 
are typically translated into English as (a), (b), etc. 
15.2.2.2 Salient linguistic features of the main text 
In Arabic the standard verb tense in constitutions is the imperfect. The normal 
verb form in English, however, is 'shall + VERB'. So, in the previous extract 
from the Jordanian Constitution, the phrase J....aJ I U".J I ă is translated 
as 'The State shall protect labour' . In fact, this principle is not always 
consistently applied. So, in the extract from the Jordanian Constitution, the 
Arabic dI.,JI to! 0 -z' J.A J...-J I is translated into English as 'It is the 
right of every citizen to work'. 
In general, the use of the present tense in English suggests a description 
of what 'has always been', while the use of 'shall + VERB' can suggest a 
change of state. Accordingly, where stress is to be laid on the fixed and 
unchangeable nature of things, the present tense may also be used; e.g. 
'Kuwait is a fully sovereign Arab State' (rather than 'Kuwait shall be a fully 
sovereign state'). Note also that the phrase jਚ 'J is typically translated 
into English as 'shall not'. An example from Article 9 of the Jordanian 
Constitution, already quoted above, is . ਙ I JxJ V- ȲJJ I Jȳ I jਛ 'J. 
This is translated into English as 'No Jordanian shalf be exiled from the 
territory of the Kingdom.'. The word jਜ on its own in the positive, 
however, is typically translated as 'may'. Article 15 (iv) of the Jordanian 
Constitution reads as follows:

This is translated into English as: 
In the event of the declaration of martial law or a state of emergency, a 
limited censorship on newspapers, pamphlets, books and broadcasts in 
matters affecting public safety or national defence may be imposed by 
law. 
15.3 CONCLUDING REMARKS 
Not all material which is 'constitutional' in a general sense will fit neatly 
into the patterns outlined above. While translators should respect the general 
conventions of constitutions in translating them, they must also be sensitive 
to cases where the text in question does not fit entirely into the standard 
format of constitutions, and must be prepared to give themselves sufficient 
freedom to deal effectively with translation problems which arise. 
At the same time, it must be borne in mind that constitutional materials 
are a form of legal material. The translator must therefore ensure that the 
information is conveyed accurately and unambiguously from one language to 
the other. Accordingly, there may be occasions where it is necessary to 
sacrifice naturalness in the translation for the sake of retaining the details of 
the meaning. At the level of individual words, for example, this means that 
different terms having similar but distinct meanings in the ST must be translated 
by different terms in the TT. Thus, if the ST uses both ..Jਘ and t I';":', it 
would normally be necessary to translate these by different English terms, 
even though considerations of TL idiomaticness might suggest that ..J)I.....:;. 
and t Iƾ both be translated by a single term, such as 'dispute'.

Translating consum.er­
oriented texts 
16.1 INTRODUCTION 
We have stressed that all texts, including translations, are produced for a 
purpose. The purpose of the IT is always a major factor to be taken into 
account in deciding a strategy. This truth is particularly clear in translating 
what can broadly be classed as consumer-oriented texts. This, together with 
the fact that many translators earn their living with these sorts of text, is why 
we are giving them a chapter to themselves. 
By 'consumer-oriented texts', we mean texts which either try to persuade 
the public to buy something, or tell purchasers how to use what they have 
bought, or advise on commodities that might be bought or courses of action 
that might be taken. This range of texts most obviously includes advertisements, 
but it also includes things like tourist brochures, public notices, information 
leaflets, user manuals, consumer or hobby magazines, recipe books, CD 
booklets, and so on - even a lot of propaganda can be classified under this 
heading. 
16.2 TOURIST MATERIAL 
A good example of the problems involved in translating consumer-oriented 
texts is provided by tourist material. In fact there are often quite clear differences 
between tourist material in English and that in Arabic. 

208 
Thinking Arabic translation 
16.2.1 English-language tourist material 
Here for class discussion is an excerpt from a British tourist brochure advertising 
the Costa Blanca in Spain. Typical features worth discussing are register, the 
choice of adjectives and adverbs, and sentence structure. 
Sunshine, bright lights and superb sandy beaches, blue-green seas, orange 
groves and picturesque villages, mountains, old fortresses and starry 
evenings - all part of the Costa Blanca's charm. 
The weather is exceptional. In spring it's warm and sunny and the colours 
of citrus fruits, flowers and blossom splash the countryside. In summer 
it's gloriously hot and in autumn the balmy days merge slowly into one 
another. This is perhaps why the Costa Blanca has become so incredibly 
popular with holidaymakers. 
16.2.2 Arabic tourist material 
Compare the English text with the following extract from a tourist brochure, 
and an English translation, both published by the Yemeni General Authority 
of Tourism (title of Arabic version: bÄ - '-7"..)L.. - ....iÅI , and of English 
version: 'AI-Jouf - Marib - Shabwa) (Republic of Yemen, General Authority 
of Tourism 1997: 2, 3):

IT 
Dear Visitor, 
This touristic publication is devoted to introduce to you three Yemeni 
provinces, which are all situated in the geographical scope, lying in the 
inner angle of the coastal mountain ranges of Yemen, which was called 
by mediaeval Arab geographers as the 'Sayhad desert and today as Ramlat 
al-Sabaatain' . 
It is the abode of the Ancient Yemeni Civilizations which started to 
flourish since the beginning of the first millennium BC, along the banks 
of the valleys. The tropical climate prevails this area, i.e., it is hot and dry 
in summer but cold in winter. 
Some parts of it are dominated by nomadic life. In this part of the 
Republic of Yemen, many companies carry out drilling works and oil 
production, which by the will of Allah, will contribute to the development 
of the country and the upgrading of the standard of living. 
This English translation obviously suffers from a number of linguistic and 
stylistic problems; here is a more idiomatic version: 
Revised IT 
Dear Visitor, 
This tourist brochure aims to introduce you to three Yemeni provinces all 
of which lie within the inland desert region between the southern and 
western Yemeni highlands. This area was known historically as the Sayhad 
Desert and today is called Ramlat al-Sabaatain. 
This is the home of the ancient civilizations of Yemen which flourished 
at the beginning of the first millennium BC on the banks of the river 
valleys. The region enjoys a continental climate - hot and dry in summer, 
and cold in winter. 
In some areas the local people follow a Bedouin life-style. In this part 
of the Republic of Yemen, a number of companies are engaged in oil-driling 
and oil-production. It is to be hoped that the revenues from these activities 
will contribute to the development of the country and the raising of living 
standards. 
The revised English translation deals with most of the obvious problems in 
the official English translation. However, the general style is rather fonnal 
for a tourist brochure. Even the opening words, 'Dear Visitor', while not 
impossible in a British tourist brochure, seem a little out of place; they 
perhaps suggest an official notice from a hotel to its clients, rather than a text 
which will entice visitors to explore. 
Similarly, the start of the first main paragraph, 'This tourist brochure aims 

210 
Thinking Arabic translation 
to introduce you to [ ... J' is more reminiscent of the initial ' Abstract' section 
of an academic article (e.g. 'This paper deals with a number of current 
problems in plant morphology [ ... ]') than of an English-language tourist 
publication. 
In the second paragraph, the second sentence 'The region enjoys a 
continental climate - hot and dry in summer, and cold in winter' is almost 
technical in tone compared with the description of the weather in the Costa 
Blanca text. 
Closely related to the generally formal tone of the Arabic brochure is its 
rather academic subject matter. British tourist brochures do sometimes contain 
historical information - 'This is the home of the ancient civilizations of 
Yemen [ .. .]' might not be out of place in a British tourist brochure. However, 
it is less likely that a British tourist brochure would devote significant space 
to oil-exploration and production and the implications of these for national 
development, as is done in the third and final paragraph here. 
The use of the phrase il I ਋L.!. w I at the end of the paragraph also raises 
an interesting cultural issue. The official English translation contains the 
exotic 'by the will of Allah', a form of expression which seems quite alien to 
the genre of the tourist brochure in English. Accordingly, this has been 
rendered as 'It is to be hoped that' in the idiomatic English version - with, of 
course, a significant translation loss, since it presumably involves a clear 
distortion of the original intention of the writer of the ST. This example is a 
reminder of how important it is for the translator to consider carefully the 
central feature of cultural differences between the SL public and the TL 
public. 
16.3 CULTURAL STEREOTYPING 
Different cultures, then, value different things, and have different taboos. In 
addition, there is also evidence that different cultures stereotype consumers 
differently. There may be a tendency in American advertising, for example, 
to hector or hustle or patronize the consumer more than in some European 
cultures; and Japanese advertisements are well known for taking an indirect, 
and in many cases quite surreal, approach to the products which they are 
trying to sell. 
In this light, consider the following announcement for a photography 
competition, from Golden FalconlȈjJl ଜ/, the inflight magazine of 
Gulf Air (Karkouti 2000: 38, 41 ).-This appears in both English and Arabic 
versions in the magazine. Judging from the fact that the author is named as 
Jo Mapp in the English version, the English version appears to be the ST and 
the Arabic the TT. The two texts should be compared and discussed in class. 
Something to concentrate on particularly is the differences in tone between 
the texts, and how these differences are created.

In part, the reformulations in the Arabic IT reflect the nature of Standard 
Arabic. Because of diglossia and the contrast with colloquial Arabic, Standard 
Arabic can be regarded as an intrinsically formal language. The conventions 
of usage in Arabic require that a written announcement of a photography 
competition in a magazine should be made in Standard Arabic. Thus an 
Arabic text of this nature is bound to be more formal than an English text 
written in a fairly intimate style. 
Over and above differences related to diglossia, however, there are clear 
culturally-related differences between the ST and the IT. The tendency towards 

212 
Thinking Arabic translation 
greater distance between writer and reader, with the writer adopting at times 
a markedly authoritative tone, seems to reflect a general cultural preference 
in Arabic, and is not a direct or inevitable result of diglossia. 
There are other ways in which consumer-oriented texts may vary between 
cultures. For instance, certain sorts of consumer may be treated differently in 
different cultures: in one culture the average consumer of a certain type of 
product may, for example, be regarded as having more specialist knowledge 
than the average consumer of the same type of product in another culture. An 
example of this is found in a later part of the photo-competition text which 
we have just been discussing. The English ST has four guidelines (of which 
we have reproduced only the first in our version, beginning 'We would like 
the photo you send [ . .. J'). The third one of these reads: 'If you are aiming to 
feature your photograph on the cover then it needs to fit the A4 format of the 
magazine'. This guideline is simply omitted from the Arabic IT; the most 
likely reason for this seems to be that although A4 paper is used in some 
parts of the Middle East, the typical Arab reader is felt to be less knowledgeable 
in this area than the typical English reader, and is not expected to know what 
A4 paper is. Therefore the guideline (in this specific form at least) is not 
worth putting into the Arabic IT. 
16.4 GENRE-MIXING IN CONSUMER-ORIENTED TEXTS 
Material within a given genre may also vary culturally in other ways. Take 
the average recipe book. On the face of things, this may seem to belong to 
the category of empirical genres, for it appears to classify cooking techniques 
in a descriptively systematic manner, to offer factual and objective accounts 
of the contents and appearances of dishes, as well as of their preparation. In 
itself, this almost makes recipe books sound like scientific texts. But this 
does not account for a number of features, in English at least, of recipe 
books; the fact that they are rarely written in a technically and scientifically 
neutral style; the fact that their use of tonal style is often calculated to draw 
the reader into a comfortable, possibly flattering, relationship; the fact that 
they have a transparently helpful organization, beyond what could be expected 
of the most indulgent scientific textbook; and the fact that recipe books are 
often lavishly illustrated with glossy pictures. Such features indicate a 
consumer-oriented purpose in recipe books that contain them, and are well 
worth looking out for when translating certain kinds of 'commercial' ST. 
Even if not directly consumer-oriented to the sale of particular foodstuffs, 
most recipe books are, at the very least, specimens of a hybrid genre 
characterized by the dual purpose of description and persuasion. 
Choosing a register for a consumer-oriented IT can be problematic in 
itself. For instance, there may be little in common between the groups of 
consumers aimed at by the ST and the IT respectively. In any case, any TL 

Translating consumer-oriented texts 
213 
genre selected as a prototype for the IT is likely to provide specimens in 
widely divergent styles and registers, leaving the translator with a number of 
possible models: the decisive question is that of the purpose and audience of 
the IT.

Read the following extract from an article in Golden Falcon/ȑJJI ȒI 
(Karkouti 200: 42-3), the inflight magazine of Gulf Air, together with its 
Arabic translation, which appears in the same magazine. The article, which is 
designed to interest readers in the touristic virtues of Morocco, is entitled 
'Discover Morocco with Gulf Air' in the English ST, and 01ͬ » (:;A Iଌ 
,-:-,଍I -.JI ,.t:, i <'lI « ռI in the Arabic IT. The extract is taken from a 
section which deals with Fez. 
Using the same general proceħure for detailing differences as you used for 
discussing the photo-competition text in § 16.3: 
(i) 
Identify the places where the IT differs significantly from the ST. 
(ii) 
Comment on the differences, accounting for them - where possible -
in terms of the following categories: 
(a) tone (tonal register) 
(b) culture (especially identification with cultural heritage in 
contemporary Arab culture) 
(c) religion (i.e. religious sensibilities) 
(d) sensitivity (i.e. avoidance of sensitive or taboo subjects, other than 
religion) 
Some examples of changes may fit more than one category. Where they do, 
you may mark them as belonging to two or more categories. You may feel 
that other categories can be added to those listed under (ii) above; feel free to 
add these. You may also find changes which do not fit easily into any 
category. If you do, list these as uncategorized. 

214 
ST 
Thinking Arabic translation 
Fez has a lot to be proud of. It is the place where the great 14th-century 
historian and traveller Ibn Khaldoun lived and its centrepiece is the grand 
Karaouine mosque, reputedly one of the world's oldest universities. The 
city has built on these venerable origins by organizing a series of festivals 
throughout the year. Music, painting and cooking become the focus of 
scholarly debates, conferences and informal discussions about the place 
of artistry in the modern world. There's a terrific enthusiasm for the 
subjects and those curious to know more about Fez and its heritage travel 
from around the globe crossing the usual boundaries that keep people 
apart. 
IT 
These special cultural programmes take place in the warren of tiled 
courtyards and narrow alleyways that make up the heart and the head of 
this fascinating city. Heart and head because Fez is both a sort of forerunner 
of Oxford and Cambridge, the centre where intellectual rigour and scientific 
endeavour was pioneered and then fostered, but also its heart for it is here 
that Moulay Idriss founder and patron saint of Fez (and also founder of 
Morocco's first royal dynasty) is buried and pilgrims from al over Morocco 
come to his shrine. Additionally there are over 3,00 mosques and medrasas 
or religious schools within its dark, maze-like streets.

Contextual information 
This recipe is one of a set of recipe-cards produced in Tunisia, and entitled 
஽Ɖ ..:.৴1 . The recipe is on one side of the card, and the picture and list 
of ingredients on the other (the picture is not reproduced here, and the list of 
ingredients has been placed above the recipe in conformity with the normal 
presentation in British recipe books). Your brief is to translate the recipe as 
part of an English-language version of this set of recipe-cards, which is 
intended to sell mainly to English-speaking tourists visiting Tunisia on holiday. 
This text provides a good illustration of the fact that cookery writing is a 
form of technical writing. If you are a regular user of cookery books, you 
will probably find it fairly easy to find appropriate IT equivalents for ST 
terms, weights and measures used here. If you are not, you will need to 
consult some English-language cookery books in order to try and work out 
appropriate IT equivalents. 
The text contains a number of terms which are specific to Tunisia. Some 
of these present challenges which are probably solvable in context; we have 
left these for you to try and work out for yourself. Others may be more 
difficult. These are glossed as follows: 
abbreviation for ৳.l 
This usage is obscure. Native Arabic speakers whom we have asked 
• 
suggested either that it is a brand name, or that it is J,.a meaning 
'Arabian jasmine'. In the latter case, one might translate :u (;.",;a.. 
as 'jasmine-scented macaroni'. It is probably safer to omit it in the 
IT . 
. 1. r 
abbreviation for JSl :i 
• 
• I ft, i.e. what is known in English as a 
dessert spoon. 
૾૿ Harissa is 'a very strong, peppery preserve [ . .. J It should be added 
with caution' (Roden 1970: 159). 
J.....l 
abbreviation for ૼ.l (from French dicilitre). 
૽J 
This means 'mix' in Tunisian Arabic (rather than 'kick', as is normal 
for Standard Arabic).

Revising and editing 
TTs 
17.1 INTRODUCTION 
Throughout this book, we have considered translation sometimes as a process, 
and sometimes as a product (TT). The assessment of existing TTs has been 
an important feature in practicals, even before we started discussing the 
question of genre. In this chapter, we tum our attention to the final stage of 
translation as a process, where the proposed TT is actually examined as a 
product. 
Any form of post-translation process is intrinsically an operation carried 
out in writing on a pre-existent text. There are two basic kinds of operation 
to be carried out on a preliminary TT. The first involves checking for accuracy; 
this we shall refer to as revision The second involves the 'polishing' of the 
TT after the revision process; this we shall refer to as editing. It is worth 
distinguishing between these two operations, since they correspond to the 
phases which professional translators standardly go through in bringing their 
work up to an acceptable standard for delivery to a client. However, the two 
operations overlap to some extent: it may not always be clear whether TT 
peculiarities are errors or just features of style; and in any case, what is 
theoretically an edit may well occur to the reviser/editor during the revising 
stage. 
As elsewhere in this book, therefore, the guidelines given here are meant 
to provide a framework which allows the apprentice translator to adopt a 
coherent approach to the process of translation. They are not meant to be 
applied in such a way that they hinder the translator by putting obstacles in 
the way of creative problem-solving.

17.2 REVISION 
The main task during the revision stage is checking the IT for adherence to 
the ST in terms of accuracy: the reviser focuses on errors, omissions, additions, 
inconsistencies, names and titles, figures and tables, etc. Errors of accuracy 
can be relatively minor, such as spelling mistakes or punctuation, or lexical 
and phrasal errors. However, they can also include more complex errors 
such as ungrammatical constructions, or obscure, ambiguous or misleading 
configurations on the sentential and discourse levels. At the revision or checking 
stage, greater emphasis is usually placed on accuracy than on terminology. 
The objectivity of the reviser should ensure that any ambiguities or unclear 
phrasings are dealt with before passing on to the editing stage. 
The following extract, which is taken from a bilingual ArabiclEnglish 
tourist brochure about the island of Socotra off the southern coast of mainland 
Yemen, is a good example of an English IT which requires basic revision of 
this type (Republic of Yemen, Ministry of Culture and Tourism n.d.: r, 3):

4-The Wadis (Valleys): 
The plains are intersspersed by many vallies .Some of which pour at the 
northern part of the Island and some of which pouer at its southern part 
and the most important of which is Azroo Valley which intersects the 
Island from north to south in addition to the valleys springing out from 
the Hajhar Mountainous Range which are characterized for their running 
water all along the year. 
This IT contains three spelling errors ('intersspersed', 'vallies', 'pouer'). 
There are also errors of capitalization and punctuation ('Island' should be 
'island' (two occurrences); 'vallies .Some' should be 'valleys. Some'; 'Valley' 
in the second sentence should probably be 'valley', 'Mountainous Range' 
should be 'mountain range'; see also subsequent discussion). There are a 
number of basic lexical and phrasal errors: 'interspersed by' would be better 
as 'interspersed with'; 'pour at' could be 'flow out at' (two occurrences); 
'springing out' could be 'leading out', 'characterized for' could be 

Revising and editing ITs 
219 
'characterized by'; 'all along the year' could be 'throughout the year'. Finally, 
'Azroo' should probably be 'the Oi Azroo' (or 'the De Azroo', etc. depending 
on what form of transliteration is adopted), given that the Arabic has c.sJ 
,JJē and that there are no standard English fonns for Socotran names o( a 
type which might lead to the 'dropping' of elements within names. 
Taken together, these proposed changes to the IT would yield the following: 
4-The Wadis (Valleys): 
The plains are interspersed with many Valleys. Some of which flow out at 
the northern part of the island and some of which flow out at its southern 
part and the most important of which is the Oi Azroo valley which 
intersects the island from north to south in addition to the valleys leading 
out from the Hajhar mountain range which are characterized by their 
running water throughout the year. 
Somewhat more difficult to deal with are problems relating to the discourse 
and sentential levels. The most obvious of these is the element 'Some of 
which [ ... J and some of which [ ... J and the most important of which [ ... J 
throughout the year'. Such a sentence would only be plausible in an infonnal 
context. The relative fonnality of the present piece of writing rules this out. 
This element can be converted easily enough into a contextually acceptable 
English sentence by replacing the ftrst 'which' with 'these' and the second 
and third with 'them', giving a second sentence, incorporating also previously 
discussed changes, as follows: 
Some of these flow out at the northern part of the island and some of 
them flow out at its southern part and the most important of them is the 
Oi Azroo valley which intersects the island from north to south in addition 
to the valleys leading out from the Hajhar mountain range which are 
characterized by their running water throughout the year. 
However, this still leaves a number of other problems on the sentential and 
discourse levels. The most obvious is the lack of commas after 'Oi Azroo 
valley' and 'mountain range': in each case, the relative clause is a describing 
clause, not a deftning one, and thus requires a comma before it. Also notable 
is the use of 'and' in the phrase 'and the most important of them'. In Arabic, 
it is perfectly reasonable in this context to use the coordinating conjunction 
.." following a previous use of the coordinating ,J in the phrase v;' " .' I I,J 
r -; I. However, in English, such piling up of coordinated clauses is typically 
avoidt:d (cf. Ch. 9.2.5). A common means of dealing with this problem is to 
start a new sentence in English. With some additional changes to the English 
wording, this gives a IT for the main part of the text as follows: 

220 
Thinking Arabic translation 
Some of these flow out at the northern part of the island and some of 
them flow out at its southern part. The most important of these is the Di 
Azroo valley, which intersects the island from north to south in addition 
to the valleys leading out from the Hajhar mountain range, which are 
characterized by their running water throughout the year. 
The final sentence of this version, however, is still rather odd. The main 
reason for this is that it involves multiple subordinate elements: the relative 
clause beginning 'which intersects' followed by the subordinating phrase 'in 
addition to', followed by a further relative clause, beginning 'which are 
characterized'. Arabic seems to tolerate such multiple subordination more 
readily than English (cf. Ch, 9.2.4). One solution to this problem would be to 
change the subordinating 'in addition to' to the coordinating 'and', with the 
concomitant change of 'The most important of these is' to 'The most important 
of these are' to make the verb agree with the plural subject in the new 
version. This would give a final sentence in the English IT as follows: 
The most important of these are the Di Azroo valley, which intersects the 
island from north to south, and the valleys leading out from the Hajhar 
mountain range, which are characterized by their running water throughout 
the year. 
We shall return to this text later, when we consider the issue of editing. 
So far we have considered accuracy in relation to linguistic features of 
various kinds. However, accuracy also has a factual aspect: it is not only the 
language of the IT which may be wrong or unsuitable, the concepts themselves 
may have been distorted in transmission. The IT is the sum not only of a 
translator's knowledge of the two linguistic systems concerned and the ability 
to interface and apply them, but also of knowledge of the subject matter in 
question. Thus, a translator may be linguistically equipped to tackle a text on 
computer software, but not have the expertise necessary to make the right 
terminological and practical decisions, thereby undermining the IT's register 
and lexis and, ultimately, its quality and authoritativeness. 
In this light, consider the following from the same brochure about the 
island of Socotra discussed above (Republic of Yemen, Ministry of Culture 
and Tourism n.d.: V, 7). This section is discussing caves on Socotra:

They are formed by the erosion factors (Geo-hydro) for the underground 
water during its movement dissolves the Lime from the rocks and 
precipitates it on the roof of the grotto forming big perpendicular columns 
and on the ground of the grotto other climbing columns that meet sometimes 
and draw wonderful colored pictures of extreme beauty. 
Leaving aside the linguistic problems in this IT, the text is marred, and 
made somewhat obscure, by the fact that the translator has failed to identify 
the correct technical equivalent for ૯L.૰ I 'hydrogeological'. He or she 
has also failed to identify the standard English terms 'stalactite[s] , (for 
4.l jL:. b.l.A..ci) and 'stalagmite[s)' (for b3̶ b.l.A..ci). 
17.3 EDITING 
The second stage and final stage of the post-translation process, that of 
editing, focuses on the end-user of the IT, and attempts to achieve the 
'optimum orientation of the translated text to the requirements of the target 
readership' (Graham 1983: 104). 
There are no hard and fast rules for editing, though critical factors are 
certainly appearance, appeal, impact, harmony, taste, register and style. If 
revision is concerned with the 'bare bones' of the IT, the editing process 
will perform 'remedial surgery' (Graham 1 983: 103), which should consist 
of 'upgrading the terminology, clarifying obscurities, reinforcing the impact, 
honing the emotive appeal to suit the target reader'. A final 'cosmetic' stage 
should be to ensure that the appearance and layout of the IT respect the 
requirements as stated by the client. 
With particularly difficult texts, it is sometimes worth doing the revision 
process itself in two phases. During the first phase, the editor may focus 
entirely on the TI, considering it from the point of view of style, terminology, 
etc. as if it were an original English text. During the second and final stage, 
the IT may be compared again with the ST, to check that concern with style 
has not led to unacceptable translation loss. 
A knotty issue is always that of style, as style and language-use obviously 
vary from one translator to another. Thus, care must be taken that edits are 
only made to items which are in some way incorrect or unsuitable, not those 
which are merely phrased differently from the way the translator/reviser 
would phrase them. For example, in everyday English there is little difference 
between 'shall' and 'will' used in the first person; and in a text containing 
direct speech, there would be little point in changing 'I shall go out later' to 
'I will go out later', unless there was a particular contextual reason to do so. 
In legal English, by contrast, there is an enormous difference between 'will' 
and 'shall' used in the third person, particularly in the context of contracts 
and agreements. Thus, if the IT of a contract contained the words 'The 

222 
Thinking Arabic translation 
contractor wil complete the work by August 10th' instead of 'shall complete', 
the reviser would have to intervene: the former IT implies that it is a foregone 
conclusion that the work will be completed by August 10th, whereas the 
latter makes it a legal requirement for the contractor to finish the work by the 
deadline stipulated. 
In the light of the foregoing, consider the version of the short text dealing 
with the valleys of Socotra, which we revised above. The revisions which we 
carried out above yielded the following, as yet unedited, IT. The edited 
version should not read like an academic description of Socotra, but should 
be accessible to the average intelligent English-speaking reader. The edited 
IT should be discussed in class; you may well want to improve it with edits 
of your own. 
Unedited IT 
4-The Wadis (Valleys): 
The plains are interspersed with many valleys. Some of these flow out at 
the northern part of the island and some of them flow out at its southern 
part. The most important of these are the Di Azroo valley, which intersects 
the island from north to south, and the valleys leading out from the 
Hajhar mountain range, which are characterized by their running water 
throughout the year. 
Edited IT 
4-The Wadis (Valleys): 
Running through the plains are many river valleys, some of which flow 
into the sea in the north, others in the south. The most important of these 
are the Di Azroo valley, which cuts across the island from north to south, 
and the valleys leading out from the Hajhar mountain range, the rivers of 
which run throughout the year. 
Some texts are passed on to an editor before publication, and here the 
translator or reviser will often play no further part: in reality, it is unlikely 
that they will be consulted about changes to the IT. An editor may wish to 
prune what are considered to be irrelevancies from the IT, or to reduce the 
length of the text due to typographical or impagination constraints. Proof­
reading marks are used by revisers and editors for amending and editing 
translations, which means marking the IT on the text and in the left-hand 
margin. Using the standard proof-reading marks makes it easier for a secretary, 
typesetter, or editor to understand what is being edited, and how. 
In effect, the editor is responsible to the translator for any changes made 
to the IT, whether or not the translator is consulted about them. If the IT is 
subsequently judged defective in some way by readers, it is the translator and 
no one else who will automatically be held responsible. As John Graham 
wisely points out, This is why the translator has to accept that his work 

Revising and editing ITs 
223 
ought to be checked and, if need be, revised and edited in the interest of the 
consumer. There is no need for him to fear the verdict or comments of the 
checker, reviser or editor unless he knows that he has handed in a poor job 
and then he deserves to be afraid. The checking, revising and editing functions 
are a safeguard of quality to the user of the translation and the target reader 
and, at the same time, a safety net for the translator' (Graham 1983: 105). 
It should be remembered that revision and editing are part of the 'quality 
control' procedure that all translators should implement on completing their 
translating (or during and after translating, depending on how the translator 
works). Revision and editing are not only activities carried out by third 
parties on TIs, though this is standard practice nowadays on the part of 
work-providers. It is essential that translators have their own system for 
self-assessment of the work, and that even when completing a rush job 
careful reading and checking is carried out to repair errors and omissions (cf. 
Anderson and Avery 1995: 26).

when the king of Hadhramawt was named King of Frankincense, Myrrh 
& Ladanum. In those old days Socotra Island became famous for the 
production of Incense Sticks (a kind of incense) and Socotra Glue as the 
best qUality glue. The Island became even more important and was widely 
known to furthermost places of ancient civilizations who used to consider

those holy commodities e.g. incense, myrhh, Ladanum, glue and other 
perfumes as hallowed not only this but named the land producing them as 
the Holy Land or The Land of The Gods. This is why Socotra Island was 
named by ancient Greeks and Romans as the Happiness Island. Due to 
the dificulty to reach it in the past. Many stories and legends have been

Unrevised IT 
Jordan .. keeps iƆ pronUse 
In his recent speech broadcast by the BBC, his Majesty King Hussein 
of Jordan affinned that Jordanian-Palestinian relations are very special 
since Jordan has not abandoned and will not abandon the Palestinian 
people until they are granted their full rights on their own national territory. 
The king's speech came as an expression of Jordan's continuing support 
for the uprising which is entering its second year, a defence for its legitimacy 
and a call to the conscience of the international community to translate its 
sympathy for the uprising into urgent action to convene an international 
conference that leads to a genuine solution and the restoration of peace 
and stability in the region. 
King Hussein took the opportunity to repeat his warning once again 
that the ongoing conflict does not just threaten the region alone but that it 
threatens the whole world. King Hussein has given the same warning 
repeatedly on previous occasions to a number of international newspapers, 
radio stations, and T.V. networks. 
Needless to say, all this underlines Jordan's steadfast commitment to 
the Arab nation, whose goal is to clear the air in the Arab world, and to 
take serious steps to mobilize Arab resources. This is demonstrated with 
the utmost clarity by the king's endeavour to establish an Arab entity 
comprising the East Mediterranean Arab countries with the aim of reviving 
the eastern front and providing Arabs with the appropriate choices to 
restore their rights and to establish a just and comprehensive peace in the 
region.

Surrunary and 
conclusion 
The only conclusion necessary to Thinking Arabic Translation is a summing 
up of what the translator is supposed to be thinking about. The first thing to 
remember is that, whatever revision or editing the IT has undergone, it is the 
translator who is ultimately responsible for it. 'Thinking' translation implies 
a clear-sighted acceptance of this responsibility, but it also implies reducing 
the element of chance in how the TT will be received. If responsibility 
entails making decisions, applying the method presented in this book will 
enable the translator to make them intelligently and imaginatively enough to 
be confident of what the overall impact of the IT will be. This is why we 
have stressed throughout the course the need for a clearly formulated initial 
strategy and for clearly formulated decisions of detail rationally linked to the 
strategy. 
One thing we hope to have shown is that no strategy can be assumed a 
priori. Formulating an appropriate strategy means assessing the salient features 
of a particular ST and of the particular circumstances in which it is to be 
translated. The crucial question then is: 'How do I decide which features are 
salient?' What we have tried to do is equip the student translator with a way 
of answering this question, whatever the nature of the ST. For our purposes, 
the salient features of a text can be said to be its most relevant ones, those 
that have significant expressive function. Devising a strategy means prioritizing 
the cultural, formal, semantic, stylistic, and genre-related properties of the 
ST according to two things: their relative textual relevance, and the amount 
of attention they should receive in translation. The aim is to deal with translation 
loss in as rational and systematic a way as possible. This implies being 
prepared, if necessary, to lose features that have relatively little textual 
relevance in a given ST (e.g. alliteration in a technical text on mining), 
sacrificing less relevant textual details to more relevant ones. And, of course, 
it implies using compensation to restore features of high textual relevance

that cannot be more directly rendered (e.g. a play on words in a literary text). 
'Textual relevance' is thus a qualitative measure of how far particular 
properties of a text are responsible for its overall impact. Textually relevant 
features are those that stand out as making the text what it is. Since it is the 
translator who decides what is textually relevant, the decision is inescapably 
subjective. But not necessarily damagingly so. A fairly objective test of 
textual relevance is to imagine that a particular textual feature is omitted 
from the text and to assess what difference this would make to the overall 
impact of the text. If the answer is 'little or none', the property in question 
has little textual relevance. But if omitting it would imply a loss in either the 
genre-representative or the individual character of the text, then it has high 
textual relevance. 
Developing a translation strategy by assessing textual relevance in an ST 
entails scanning the text for every kind of feature that might be relevant to 
producing an appropriate TT. For this scanning to be effective, it is vital to 
have in mind a systematic set of questions to ask of the ST. These questions 
correspond to the check-list of kinds of textual features introduced in the 
schema of textual matrices at the end of the Introduction to this book. The 
successive chapters of Thinking Arabic Translation tackle the sorts of 
translation issue lying behind the questions that need to be asked of texts. 
The idea is that the translator learns to ask the questions systematically, one 
after the other. As students working through the book will have found, it 
only takes a bit of practice to be able to do this very quickly and efficiently. 
Some comments are called for on aspects of the relation between the 
schema of textual matrices and the book you have read. First, the 'cultural' 
matrix is different in focus from the others. Unlike the others, it does not list 
types of features that may in themselves be salient in the ST before the 
translator starts forming a strategy. Corresponding to Chapter 3, it lists types 
of features whose relevance can only be decided when the translator starts to 
form a strategy. That is, it draws attention to features that force the translator 
to choose between source-culture and target-culture elements. As such, it 
does invite the translator to assess how far the culture-specificity of ST 
features is textually relevant - this is why we have included it in the schema 
of textual matrices. 
The other matrices are more straightforward reminders of what sorts of 
thing to look for when asking what the relevant features of a text are. Chapters 
5, 6 and 1 1  correspond to the semantic matrix, introducing translation issues 
raised by the denotative, connotative and metaphorical properties of texts. 
Chapters 7-10 correspond to the formal matrix; the translation issues addressed 
here are the ones most typically raised by formal features of the texts. Chapter 
1 2  corresponds to the varietal matrix; the questions to ask here concern 
language variety and its translation implications. Chapter 1 3, corresponding 
to the genre matrix, gives a set of parameters to apply in identifying textual 
genre preparatory to translation. (As is explained in the Introduction, and 

230 
Thinking Arabic translation 
stressed throughout the course, genre is a primary factor in deciding a strategy, 
but can itself only be determined after the other salient features of the ST 
have been identified. Hence its position following discussion of these other 
salient features rather than at the beginning of the course.) Chapter 14-16 
then give a brief sample of the many sub-genres from which professional 
translators will nonnally choose their speciality. 
Some vital topics in this book do not figure as such in the schema of 
matrices. This is because they either apply universally from top to bottom of 
the schema, or concern a translation operation, not a textual feature. 
Grammatical transposition, for example, is introduced in Chapter 2, but is of 
central relevance in every chapter and every practical. There is a case to be 
made for including it in the cultural matrix, but it is so all-pervasive that it is 
not useful to identify it as a discrete element in the matrix. 
Another absolutely crucial topic, introduced as such in Chapter 4 but 
everywhere relevant, is compensation. More than anything else, successful 
compensation exemplifies the combination of imagination and rigour that is 
the mark of a good translator. However, even though compensation very 
often involves cultural and/or grammatical transposition, it is a translation 
operation, not a textual feature. So too is revising, which is introduced as 
such in Chapter 17, but is a vital stage in the translation process and figures 
in a number of chapters and practicals. 
One pre-eminent translation issue is neither a textual feature nor a translation 
operation. This is the translation brief - why the text is being translated, on 
whose behalf, and for what audience. As we suggest in Chapter 1 3, it is 
useful, for practical translation needs, to se the communicative purpose of a 
text as very closely linked with its genre. Genre, of course, is a textual 
feature, and as such figures at the head of the schema at the end of the 
Introduction. The reason why it is placed at the top is precisely that it shares 
a prime importance with communicative purpose: the translation process will 
result in a translation product, a text having specific textual features, and 
produced in order to meet a communicative demand. This demand, fonnulated 
by the work-provider, is the translation brief. As the brief is neither a process 
nor a textual feature, it does not have a chapter to itself. But it has decisive 
importance, and that is why we have everywhere stressed its role as a parameter 
in assessing the relevance of ST and TI textual features, and why, in practicals, 
you have been asked to produce your TIs as if in response to a specific 
commission. 
It should be remembered that the schema of matrices can be used to 
analyse any text, not just an ST. It can be applied to draft TIs, their features 
being systematically compared with those of the ST so as to see which 
details will be acceptable in the final version. Published TIs can also be 
evaluated in the same way. But whatever the text that is analysed by this 
method, never forget that the watchword is thinking translation. This course 
encourages a methodical approach based on reasoned analysis of textual 

Summary and conclusion 
231 
features and the translation problems they pose. But 'methodical' is not 
synonymous with 'mechanical' or 'automatic'. As we said in the Introduction, 
good translators know what they are doing: for thinking translation, there has 
to be a thinker, an individual person using flair and rigour to take creative, 
responsible decisions. 
To sum up, then, we have tried to do two things in this course. First, to 
help you ask and answer the strategic questions we listed in Ch. 1 . 1 :  'What is 
the message content of this particular ST? What are its salient linguistic 
features? What are its principal effects? What genre does it belong to and 
what audience is it aimed at? What are the functions and intended audience 
of my translation? What are the implications of these factors? If a choice has 
to be made among them, which ones should be given priority? And second, 
to help you use intelligent, creative techniques for the translation operation, 
the battle with the problems of syntax, lexis, etc. that has to be fought in 
translating particular expressions in their particular context. 
Finally, having completed the course, you may wish to fmd out about becoming 
a professional translator. An excellent book giving advice for aspiring and 
practising translators is Samuellson-Brown (1993). A good place to find 
companies which offer in-house training and posts is the Institute of Translating 
and Interpreting (m) Bulletin, published every two months. The m offers 
membership, gained by examination and experience, which is valuable if you 
are thinking about progressing to freelance work. An equally valuable 
qualification is the Diploma in Translation of the Institute of Linguists (loL); 
the examination for this is held every November, and a number of institutions 
offer preparatory courses for it, whether on site or by distance learning. For 
details of the services provided by these bodies, and the categories of 
membership they offer, you can visit their websites:

If you decide that you do want a career in translation, remember that you 
need to be enthusiastic and determined. Freelancing in particular can be 
precarious to begin with. Work flow is usually erratic, at least until you 
become established and have several work-providers. But once you are 
established, you will be unlikely to want to return to a routine job, as the 
independence of freelancing makes for an interesting, varied and stimulating 
occupation. May the loss be with you! 

Glossary 
This glossary contains a list of all key terms used in the book. These are 
picked out in the main text in bold when they first occur. Where terms are a 
major topic of a chapter or section in the book, the glossary also includes a 
reference to this chapter or section immediately after the term. 
addition see translation by addition 
affective meaning (Ch. 6.4) 
a type of connotative meaning, affective 
meaning is the emotive effect worked on the addressee by using one 
particular linguistic expression rather than others that might have been 
used to express the same literal message. 
alliteration (Ch. 7. 1 . 1 ) the recurrence of the same sound or sound-cluster at 
the beginning of two or more words occurring near or next to one another; 
not to be confused with onomatopoeia. 
allusive meaning (Ch. 6.5) a type of connotative meaning; in a given 
linguistic expression, allusive meaning consists in invoking the meaning 
of an entire saying or quotation in which that expression figures. NB If a 
saying or quotation appears in full, that is a case of citation, e.g. 'The 
darling buds of May are just beautiful this year' ; allusion occurs where 
only part of the saying or quotation is used, but that part evokes the 
meaning of the entire saying or quotation: e.g. 'Brr ... No darling buds 
yet awhile, I'm afraid'. 
anaphora see grammatical anaphora and rhetorical anaphora 
associative meaning (Ch. 6.3) the connotative meaning of a linguistic 
expression which takes the form of attributing to the referent certain 

Glossary 
233 
stereotypically expected properties culturally associated with that referent 
assonance (Ch. 7. 1 . 1) the recurrence of a sound or sound-cluster within 
words occurring near or next to one another; not to be confused with 
onomatopoeia 
attitudinal meaning (Ch. 6.2) the connnotative meaning of a linguistic 
expression which takes the form of implicitly conveying a commonly 
held attitude or value judgement in respect of the referent of the expression. 
back-translation translation of a IT back into the SL; the resulting text 
will almost certainly not be identical to the original ST. 
background information (Ch. 9.2.3) see backgrounding. 
back grounding (Ch. 9.2.3) the conveying in a sentence of background 
information, i.e. information which is not central to the overall topic of a 
particular section of text Background information is normally conveyed 
through the use of subordinate clauses. 
calque (Ch. 3.3) a form of cultural transposition whereby a TT expression 
is closely modelled on the grammatical structure of the corresponding ST 
expression; a calque is like a moment of exoticism, although exoticism 
proper is a feature of whole texts or sections of texts. NB Calque is 
different from cultural borrowing, which imports the ST expression 
verbatim into the TT. 
code-switching (Ch. 12.5) the alternating use of two or more recognizably 
different language variants (varieties of the same language, or different 
languages) within the same text. 
cognitive meaning see denotative meaning 
coherence (adj. coherent) (Ch. 10.2. 1) the tacit, yet intellectually discernible, 
thematic or affective development that characterizes a text, as distinct 
from a random sequence of unrelated sentences. 
cohesion (adj. cohesive) (Ch. 10.2.1) the explicit and transparent linking of 
sentences and larger sections of text by the use of overt linguistic devices, 
such as conjunctions or grammatical anaphora, that act as 'signposts' 
for the coherence of the text. 
collocative meaning (Ch. 6.6) the connotative meaning lent to a linguistic 
expression by the meaning of some other expression with which it 

2 34 
Thinking Arabic translation 
frequently collocates; e. g. 
' intercourse' almost invariably acquires a 
connotation of 'sex' from the common collocation 'sexual intercourse'. 
Collocative meaning is thus the 'echo' of expressions that partner a given 
expression in commonly used phrases. 
communicative translation (Ch. 2.1 .4 , 3.6) a mode of free translation 
whereby ST expressions are replaced with their contextually/situationally 
appropriate cultural equivalents in the TL; i. e. the TL uses situationally 
apt target culture equivalents in preference to literal translation 
compensation (Ch. 4 )  a technique of reducing translation loss; where any 
conventional translation, however literal or free, would entail an 
unacceptable translation loss, this loss is mitigated by deliberately 
introducing a less acceptable one, importantST effects being approximated 
in the TT through means other than those used in the ST. NB Unlike an 
unavoidable standard grammatical transposition, 
for example, 
compensation is not forced on the translator by the constraints of TL 
structure - it is a free, conscious, careful, ad hoc choice. 
compensation by splitting (Ch. 4.2 ) compensation that involves dividing 
up a feature carried in a relatively shorter stretch of the ST and spreading 
it over a relatively longer stretch of the TT; an ad hoc choice, not a 
grammatical constraint 
compensation in kind (Ch. 4.2 ) compensation that involves using a different 
kind of textual effect in the TT from the one used in the corresponding 
part of the ST; an ad hoc choice, not a grammatical constraint; most 
compensation is compensation in kind, whatever other features it has. 
compensation in place (Ch. 4.2 ) compensation which involves a TT textual 
effect occurring at a different place, relative to the other features in the 
IT context, from the corresponding textual effect in the ST context; an 
ad hoc choice, not a grammatical constraint 
connective (Ch. 10.2.1 ) an expression that links two sentences together (or, 
by extension, that links two clauses together), by making plain the 
relationship between those two sentences (or clauses). 
connotation se connotative meaning. 
connotative meaning (or connotation) (Ch. 6) the implicit overtones that a 
linguistic expression carries over and above its denotative meaning. 
NB The overall meaning of an expression is a compound of its literal 
meaning plus these overtones and its contextual nuances. 

Glossary 
235 
cultural borrowing (Ch. 3.5 ) taking over an SL expression verbatim from 
the ST into the IT; the borrowed term may remain unaltered in form, or 
it may undergo some degree of transliteration. NB Cultural borrowing 
differs from calque and exoticism, which do not use the ST expression 
verbatim, but adapt it into the TL, however minimally. 
cultural transplantation (Ch. 3.4 ) 
the highest degree of cultural 
transposition, involving the wholesale deletion of source-culture details 
mentioned in the ST and their replacement with target-culture details in 
the IT. 
cultural transposition (Ch. 3 )  any departure from literal translation that 
involves replacing SL-specific features with TL-specific features, thereby 
to some extent reducing the foreignness of the TT. 
decisions or detail translation decisions taken in respect of specific problems 
oflexis, syntax, etc. ; decisions of detail are taken in the light of previously 
taken strategic decisions, although they may well in their tum lead the 
translator to refine the original strategy. 
denotative meaning (Ch. 5 )  the conventional range of referential meaning 
attributed to a linguistic expression NB The overall meaning of an 
expression in context is compounded of this denotative meaning plus any 
connotative meanings and contextual nuances that the expression has. 
dialect (Ch. 12.4 ) a language variety with non-standard features of accent, 
vocabulary, syntax, and sentence formation characteristic of the regional 
provenance of its users. 
diglossia (Ch 12.4 . 1 )  a situation where two very different varieties of a 
language co-occur throughout a community of speakers, each having a 
distinct range of social functions. The coexistence of Standard Arabic 
՛) and colloquial Arabic (NM) is an example of diglossia. 
discourse level (Ch. 10.2 ) the level of textual variables on which whole 
texts or sections of text are considered as coherent or cohesive entities. 
editing (Ch. 17.3 ) 
the final 'polishing' of a TT, following revision, and 
focusing on matching IT style and presentation to the expectations of the 
target readership. 
exegetic translation (Ch. 1.3 ) a style of translation in which the IT expresses 
and comments on additional details that are not explicitly conveyed in 
the ST; i. e. the IT is an explication, and usually an expansion, of the 

236 
Thinking Arabic translation 
contents of the ST. 
exoticism (Ch. 3.2) the lowest degree of cultural transposition, importing 
linguistic and cultural features wholesale from the ST into the TT with 
minimal adaptation; exoticism generally involves multiple calques. NB 
Exoticism is different from cultural borrowing, which does not adapt 
ST material into the TL, but quotes it verbatim. 
foreground information see foregrounding. 
foregrounding (Ch. 9.2.3) 
the conveying in a sentence of foreground 
information, i.e. information which is central to the overall topic of a 
particular section of text. Foreground information is normally conveyed 
through the use of main clauses. 
free translation (Ch. 2.1.3) a style of translation in which there is only a 
global correspondence between units of the ST and units of the TT - e.g. 
a rough sentence-to-sentence correspondence, or an even looser 
correspondence in terms of even larger sections of text. 
generalization see generalizing translation. 
generalizing translation (or generalization) (Ch .. 5. 1.3) rendering an ST 
expression by a TL hyperonym, e.g. translating J£ as 'uncle'. The 
denotative meaning of the TT expression is wider and less specific than 
that of the corresponding ST expression; i.e. a generalizing translation 
omits detail that is explicitly present in the literal meaning of the ST 
expression. 
genre (or text-type) (Chapter 13) a category to which, in a given culture, a 
given text is seen to belong and within which it is seen to share a type of 
communicative purpose with other texts; that is, the text is seen to be 
more or less typical of the genre. 
gist translation (Ch. 1 .3) a style of translation in which the TT expresses 
only the gist of the ST; i.e. the IT is at the same time a synopsis of the 
ST. 
grammatical anaphora (Ch. 10.2. 1 )  the replacement of previously used 
linguistic expressions by simpler and less specific expressions (such as 
pronouns) having the same contextual referent; e.g. 'I dropped the bottle, 
and it broke' . 
grammatical level (Ch. 8.2) the level of textual variables on which are 

Glossary 
237 
considered words, the decomposition of inflected, derived and compound 
words into their morphological constituent parts, and the syntactic 
arrangement of words into phrases and sentences. 
grammatical transposition translating an ST expression having a given 
grammatical structure by a TT expression having a different grammatical 
structure containing different parts of speech in a different arrangement. 
hyperonym or superordinate (Ch. 5. 1 .2) a linguistic expression whose 
denotative meaning includes, but is wider and less specific than, the 
range of denotative meaning of another expression, e.g. 'vehicle' is a 
hyperonym of 'car'. 
hyperonymy-hyponymy (Ch. 5. 1.2) the semantic relationship between a 
hyperonym and a hyponym; a lesser degree of semantic equivalence 
than synonymy. 
hyponym (Ch. 5.1 .2) a linguistic expression whose denotative meaning is 
included in, but is narrower and more specific than, the range of denotative 
meaning of another expression; e.g. 'lorry' is a hyponym of 'vehicle'. 
idiom 
a fixed expression whose meaning cannot be deduced from the 
denotative meanings of the words that constitute it; e.g. 'football's a 
diferent kettle offish', 'that's not my cup of tea' , 'she's so stuck up'. 
idiomatic an idiomatic expression is one that is unremarkable, 'natural' ,  
'normal', completely acceptable i n  a given language. NB 'Idiomatic' is 
not synonymous with idiomizing. 
idiomizing translation a relatively free translation which respects the ST 
message content, but typically uses TL idioms or phonic and rhythmic 
patterns to give an easy read, even if this means sacrificing some semantic 
details or nuances of tone. NB 'Idiomizing' is not synonymous with 
idiomatic. 
inter-semiotic translation translating from one semiotic system (i.e. system 
for communication) into another. 
interlinear translation (Ch. 2. 1 . 1 ) a style of translation in which the TT 
provides a literal rendering for each successive meaningful unit of the ST 
(including affixes) and arranges these units in the order of their occurrence 
in the ST, regardless of the conventional grammatical order of units in 
the TL. 

238 
Thinking Arabic translation 
intertextual level (Ch. 10.3) the level of textual variables on which texts 
are considered as bearing significant external relationships to other texts, 
e.g. by allusion or imitation, or by virtue of genre membership. 
intralingual translation (Ch. 1.3) the re-expression of a message conveyed 
in a particular form of words in a given language by means of another 
form of words in the same language. 
lexical item repetition (Ch. 8.2.4. 1) Repetition of a the same lexical item 
(word) in close proximity. 
lexicalized metaphor (Ch. 1 1.2. 1) a metaphor whose meaning is relatively 
fixed, and which can therefore be given a dictionary definition. 
lexis (adj. lexical) the totality of the words in a given language. 
linguistic expression a self-contained and meaningful item in a given language, 
such as a word, a phrase, or a sentence. 
literal meaning se denotative meaning 
literal translation (Ch. 2. 1 .2) an SL-oriented, word-for-word, style of 
translation in which the denotative meaning of all words in the ST is 
taken as if straight from the dictionary, but the conventions ofTL grammar 
are respected. 
metaphor (Ch. 1 1) a figure of speech in which two things (or ideas or 
emotions) are likened to one another by being fused together into a new, 
non-denotative compound, e.g. 'the army is a rampart against invasion', 
'the red, red rose of my love', 'he blew a fuse' ;  metaphor is thus different 
from simile, in which the two things are compared, but not fused together, 
e.g. 'the army is like a rampart against invasion', 'my love is like a red, 
red rose', 'it was as if he were an electrical installation with a fuse that 
blew'. 
morphology (adj. morphological) (Ch. 8.2) the branch of grammar that 
concerns the arrangement of basic grammatical elements, morphemes, 
into words. 
non-Iexicalized metaphor (Ch. 1 1.2. 1) a metaphor whose range of potential 
meanings is not definable, and which cannot therefore be given a dictionary 
definition. 
omission see translation by omission

onomatopoeia (Ch. 7. 1 .2) a word whose phonic form imitates a sound; not 
to be confused with alliteration or assonance.

phrases which bear a semantic relationship to one another, such as 
synonymy, hyperonymy-hyponymy, or membership of the same 
semantic field 
partial overlap see partially overlapping translation. 
partially overlapping translation (or partial overlap) (Ch. 5. 1 .4) rendering 
an ST expression by a TL expression whose range of denotative meanings 
overlaps only partially with that of the ST expression, e.g. translating 
ijL:......l as 'lecturer' ; i.e. the denotative meaning of the IT expression 
both adds some detail not explicit in the denotative meaning of the ST 
expression (she works in a university, not in a school) and omits some 
other detail that is explicit in the denotative meaning of the ST expression 
(she is female); partially overlapping translation thus simultaneously 
combines elements of generalizing translation and particularizing 
translation 
particularization see particularizing translation. 
particularizing translation (or particularization) (Ch. 5. 1.3) rendering an 
ST expression by a TL hyponym; e.g. translating LL.. as 'watch' .  The 
denotative meaning of the TT expression is narrower and more specific 
than that of the corresponding ST expression; i.e. a particularizing 
translation adds detail to the IT that is not explicitly expressed in the ST. 
pattern repetition (Ch. 8.2.3.1) the repetition of the same pattern (՚,

phonidgraphic level (Ch. 7 . 1) the level o f  textual variables o n  which is 
considered the patterned organization of sound-segments (phonemes) in 
speech, or of letters (graphemes) in writing. 
phrase repetition (Ch. 8.2.4.2) Repetition of a the same phrase in close 
proximity. 
polysemy a situation in which a lexical item has a range of different and 
distinct meanings or senses, e.g. plain = (i) 'clear', (ii) 'unadorned', (iii) 
'tract of flat country'. A large proportion of a language's vocabulary is 
traditionally regarded as polysemic (or polysemous).

propositional meaning see denotative meaning 
prosodic level (Ch. 7.2) the level of textual variables on which are considered 
'metrically' patterned stretches of speech within which syllables have 
varying degrees of prominence (e.g. through stress and vowel­
differentiation), varying degrees of pace (e.g. through length and tempo), 
and varying qualities of pitch. 
reflected meaning (Ch. 6.7) the connotative meaning given to a linguistic 
expression by the fact either that the form used calls to mind another 
denotative meaning of the same word or phrase (in which case reflected 
meaning is a function of polysemy), or that the form used calls to mind 
another denotative meaning of another word or phrase which is the same 
or similar in form (in which case reflected meaning is a function of 
homonymy, or near-homonymy); i.e. reflected meaning is the 'echo' of 
another denotative meaning whose form sounds or is spelt the same or 
nearly the same as the form in question. 
register see social register and tonal register. 
rephrasing (Ch. 1 .3) the exact rendering of the message content of a given 
ST in a TT that is radically different in form, but neither adds details 
which are not explicitly conveyed by the ST, nor omits details that are 
explicitly conveyed in it; perfect rephrasing is rarely achieved. 
revision (Ch. 17.2) checking a IT against the ST; compare editing. 
rheme see theme 
rhetorical anaphora (Ch. 10.2. 1 )  the repetition for rhetorical effect of a 
word or words at the beginning of successive or closely associated clauses 
or phrases. 
rhyme (Ch. 7. 1 . 1 )  rhyme occurs when, in two or more words, the last 
stressed vowel and all the sounds that follow it are identical and in the 
same order. 
root repetition (Ch. 8.2.3.2) repetition of the same root in two or more 
words in close proximity, as in ૏I,J ૐI. 
semantic distancing (Ch. 5.2) relaying both elements of an ST phrase 
involving synonyms or near-synonyms by different words in the TL, but 
choosing TL words whose meanings are more obviously distinct than 
those of their ST counterparts. An example is 'astonishes and alarms' in 
the translation of ilil.:,J Ӟ ..l.:' as 'it astonishes and alarms him'. 

Glossary 
241 
semantic field (Ch. 5.2. 1 )  an area of meaning which is recognized as being 
fairly discrete; e.g. the semantic field of terms describing agricultural 
machinery. 
semantic repetition (Ch. 5.2) the repetition of synonyms or near-synonyms 
in close proximity. Semantic repetition is used in Arabic for emphasis 
and other purposes. 
sentence (Ch. 9. 1) a complete, self-contained linguistic unit capable of 
acting as a vehicle for communication; over and above the basic 
grammatical units that it contains, a sentence must have sense-conferring 
properties of intonation or punctuation in English (although in Arabic 
some writing is without punctuation). It may in addition contain features 
of word order etc. which contribute to the overall meaning, or 'force', of 
the sentence. 
sentential level (Ch. 9. 1) the level of textual variables on which sentences 
are considered. 
SL see source language. 
social register (Ch. 12.2.2.) a style of speaking/writing from which relatively 
detailed stereotypical information about the social identity of the 
speaker/writer can be inferred. 
sociolect (Ch. 1 2.3) a language variety with features of accent, vocabulary, 
syntax and sentence-formation characteristic of the class and other social 
affiliations of it users. 
source language (or SL) the language in which the ST is expressed. 
source text (or ST) the text requiring translation. 
ST see source text. 
strategic decisions the initial decisions that constitute the translator's strategy; 
strategic decisions are taken, in the light of the nature of the ST and the 
requirements of the TT, as to which ST properties should have priority in 
translation; decisions of detail are taken in the light of these strategic 
decisions. 
strategy the translator's overall 'game-plan', consisting of decisions taken 
before starting to translate in detail - e.g. whether and when to give 
denotative meaning a higher priority than style, to address a lay readership 

242 
Thinking Arabic translation 
or a specialist one, to maximize or minimize foreignness in the TT, to 
use formal language or slang, prose or verse, etc. 
suffix repetition (Ch. 8.2.3.3) repetition of the same suffix at the end of 
words in close proximity. An example is the repetition of ..:.L in: උ) 
..::.I.>-;'t.;ll" ..:.ul.>:' .. JI" ..:.ඌL...>JI" ..:.1ඍඎ1. 
superordinate see hyperonym 
synonym (Ch. 5.1 . 1 )  a linguistic expression that has exactly the same range 
of denotative meaning as one of more other linguistic expressions. 
synonymy (Ch. 5. 1 . 1 )  
the semantic relationship between synonyms; 
synonymy is the highest degree of semantic equivalence. 
syntax (adj. syntactic) (Ch. 8.2) the branch of grammar that concerns the 
arrangement of words into phrases, and - with the addition of features of 
intonation, punctuation and word order - into sentences. 
target language (or TL) the language into which the ST is to be translated. 
target text (or TT) the text which is a translation of the ST. 
text any stretch of speech or writing produced in a given language (or 
mixture of languages - cf. code-switching) and assumed to make a 
coherent whole on the discourse level. 
text-type see genre. 
textual variables all the demonstrable features contained in a text, and 
which could (in another text) have been different; i.e. each textual variable 
constitutes a genuine option in the text. 
theme (and rheme) (Ch. 9.2.2) the organization of phrases and sentences, 
mainly through word ordering, into elements which have greater or lesser 
degrees of predictability. 
TL see target language. 
tonal register (Ch. 1 2.2. 1) a style of speaking/writing adopted as a means of 
conveying an affective attitude of the speaker/writer to the addressee. 
The connotative meaning of a feature of tonal register is an affective 
meaning, conveyed by the choice of one out of a range of expressions 
capable of conveying a particular literal message; e.g. 'Excuse me, please' 
vs 'Shift your butt' . 

Glossary 
243 
translation by addition (Ch. 2.2. 1 .2) the addition to the IT of something 
which does not occur in the ST. 
translation by omission (Ch. 2.2. 1 . 1) the omission from the TT of something 
which occurs in the ST. 
translation loss (Ch. 2.2. 1 )  any feature of incomplete replication of the ST 
in the IT; translation loss is therefore not limited to the omission of ST 
features in the TT; where the TT has features not present in the ST, the 
addition of these also counts as translation loss. In any given TT, translation 
loss is inevitable on most levels of textual variables, and likely on all. 
NB The translation losses in the TT are only significant in so far as they 
prevent the successful implementation of the translator's strategy for the 
TT. 
transliteration (Ch. 3.7) the use of TL spelling conventions for the written 
representation ofSL expressions. 
IT see target text.
