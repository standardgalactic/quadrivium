Challenge Problem 1 

Kleene Star 
Example 
1* 
Does NOT mean an infinite long string of 1’s 
L(1*)={ε,1,11,111,1111,…} 
Each element in L(1*) has finite length 
2 

Infiniteness 
Infinite objects are important in 
mathematics (set of integers, a line 
containing infinite number of points) 
In a computational model, you can 
never read such object into a computer 
Unless you can represent it in finite form 
• Regular expression for a regular language 
• Triple (a,b,c) for a line ax+by+c=0 
3 

What is “Last” 
A DFA which accepts all strings of 0’s 
and 1’s except those whose last 
character is 1 
What about the string 1? 
The last character of any string a1a2…an 
is just an (n>1).  
So 1 is not accepted by this DFA 
ε has no “last” character, so it IS 
accepted by this DFA

Review 
k-Path Induction 
Let Rij
k be the regular expression for the 
set of labels of k-paths from state i to j

k-Path Inductive Case 
A k-path from i to j either: 
1. Never goes through state k, or 
2. Goes through k one or more times. 
Rij
k = Rij
k-1 + Rik
k-1(Rkk
k-1)* Rkj
k-1. 
Doesn’t go 
through k 
Goes from 
i to k the 
first time Zero or 
more times 
from k to k 
Then, from 
k to j

What is Rik
k-1(Rkk
k-1)* Rkj
k-1? 
 
 
                                   …

Challenge Problem 1 
L is a language with alphabet {0, 1, 2}  
L contains no strings that have any 
three consecutive 0's, any three 
consecutive 1's, or any three 
consecutive 2's. 
e.g. 11000220 is not in L 
Prove that L is regular and give a DFA 
for L. 
8 

Challenge Problem 1 
The complement of L has a regular 
expression: 
(0+1+2)*(000+111+222)(0+1+2)* 
All strings that DO contain three 
consecutive 0's or 1's or 2's.  
 
Regular languages are closed under 
complement  
9 

Challenge Problem 1 
DFA for L 
The state represents the run of the same 
symbol that appears at the end of the 
string 
• Start state S 
• State a0, a00, a1, a11, a2, a22 
• Dead state D 
Example: 
012011 should get to a11
