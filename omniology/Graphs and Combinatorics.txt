PREFACE -
Wherefore is this conference book on graphs and combinatorics different 
from other such books? 
One way is that it is, frankly, a progress report on recent results in the 
field, and does not claim to be a definitive work. 
Another is that all contri-
butions have been refereed. 
A third way is that it contains both expository 
review articles and research contributions. 
We wish to thank A. J. Schwenk for his invaluable editorial assistance, 
V. Chvatal and P. Hell for several constructive suggestions, and Mary Breen for 
her masterly coordination and organization of the meeting. 
Certainly, not least, 
we thank the accurate, fast, reliable typist, Debrah A. Johnson, whose neat work 
can be seen on every page of this book. 
We also thank the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences of the George 
Washington University for providing the financial support which made the con-
ference possible. 
The contributions to this book are divided into three parts. 
In Part I, 
there are six invited articles of an expository nature, four by Frank Harary, the 
principal speaker at the conference, one by Harary and R. C. Read, and one by 
Harary and A. J. Schwenk. 
In Part II, there are four contributed survey papers, 
and Part III contains contributed papers which give new results on graphs and 
combinatorics, mostly the former. 
It has been a pleasure for both of us to edit these proceedings together, 
especially as we have been friends for the past thirty-five years, and still are, 
even after actively working on all the detailed tasks involved in the production 
of this book.

RECENT RESULTS ON TREES 
Frank Harary_

ABSTRACT 
Our object is to present six theorems on trees discovered since the appearance 
of the book [4] 
These deal with (1) trees with hamiltonian square, (2) path 
numbers, (3) the tree graph of a graph, (4) the intersection graph of ~ubtrees of 
a tree, (5) cospectral trees, and (6) the probability of an endpoint.

RECENT RESULTS ON TREES 
1. 
TREES WITH HAMILTONIAN SQUARE 
The square of graph G is the graph G2 obtained by adding to G all lines 
joining two points u and 
v 
whose distance is 2. 
In an already classical but not 
yet published result, Fleischner [3] proved that the square of every nonseparable 
graph is hamiltonian. 
This immediately suggested the question of characterizing 
those trees with hamiltonian square. 
To describe this result, we require some de-
finitions. 
The subdivision graph of G , written S(G) , is obtained from 
G by 
inserting just one new vertex at the "midpoint" of each edge; see Figure 1. 
Figure 1. 
A Graph and Its Subdivision Graph 
For any tree T with at least 3 points, the derived tree 
T' 
is obtained from 
T 
by deleting all its endpoints. 
A caterpillar is a tree T for which T' 
is a path; 
see Figure 2. 
Figure 2. 
A Caterpillar 

3 
A new crossing number, denoted 
v2 (T) , was defined in [6] for a tree T as the 
minimum number of crossings which can result when 
T is drawn as a bipartite graph 
with the poiuts in one set located on a horizontal line, the points in the other set 
located on a parallel line just one inch below the first one, and all the edges drawn 
as straight line segments. 
Figure 2 shows that for a caterpilliar T , v2 (T) = 0 • 
Of course 
v2(G) 
is meaningful for any bipartite graph G • 
We discovered the characterization [6] by verifying that the only tree T with 
p ~ 7 points with r 2 not hamiltonian is S(K1 3) 
shown in Figure 1. 
The square 
• 
is shown in Figure 3 following a drawing by V. Chvatal in which the lines of T are 
drawn solid, and the added lines to form T2 are drawn dashed. 
Figure 3. 
The Nonhamiltonian Square of a Tree 
Theorem 1. 
For any tree T with at least 3 points, the following statements are 
equivalent: 
(1) 
T2 is hamiltonian. 
(2) 
T is a caterpillar. 
(3) 
T does not contain S(K1 , 3) 
as a subtree. 
(4) 
v2 (T) = 0 , 
2. 
PATH NUMBERS 
In [7] the path number of a graph 
~(G) is defined as the minimum number of 
line-disjoint paths covering all the lines of 
G 
A second path-covering invariant 
of a graph is the unrestricted path number 
~*(G) taken as the minimum number of 
paths which are not necessarily line-disjoint, needed to cover the lines of G 
We 
immediately see that if G has 
points of odd degree, then since at least one 

4 
path must end at each odd point, 
'II(G) ~Po I 2 . 
For the unrestricted path number, 
this need not be the case, as seen by the example in Figure 4(c). 
It is possible to 
cover the tree T with two unrestricted paths not ending at either of the two points 
of degree 3. 
But of course, we must still have a path terminating at each endpoint, 
and so if G has 
e 
endpoints, then 
'II*(G) ~ {e/2} 
T: 
>-< > < 
\__/ 
.....-----
;------\.

Figure 4. 
A Tree and Its Covering Paths 
For graphs in general, these two lower bounds may or may not be attained, but 
we found in [7] that trees are nicely behaved, and the bounds are the exact values! 
Theorem 2. 
For any tree T ' 
'II(T) 
Po 
=-y 
and 
'~~*(T) 
e 2} . 
3. 
THE TREE GRAPH OF A GRAPH 
The tree graph T(G) 
of the connected graph G has one point for each spanning 
tree of 
G , and two of these points are adjacent if the corresponding trees differ 
by just one line. 
For example, the random graph depicted in Figure 5 has eight 
spanning trees as shown. 
These give rise to the tree graph given in Figure 6. 
It 
is easy to check that for each line y 
of 
T(K4-x) , there exists a hamiltonian 
cycle containing y 
and a second hamiltonian cycle not containing y . 
This has 
been found to be true for all tree graphs [5].

The Tree Graph of a Graph 
Theorem 3. 
Let 
G be a connected graph containing a cycle. 
For every line y 
in 
the tree graph 
T(G) , there exists a hamiltonian cycle containing y 
and a second 
hamiltonian cycle not containing 
y 
Analogously, one can define the "base graph" of a matroid. 
Base graphs are 
also shown [5] to have the property described in the theorem. 
4. 
THE INTERSECTION GRAPH OF SUBTREES OF A TREE 
A chordal graph is a graph in which every cycle of length greater than three 
has a chord, that is, a line joining two nonconsecutive points on the cycle. 
In 
particular, every maximal planar graph is chordal. 
In the past, such graphs have 
been called "rigid circuit graphs". 
Given a family of distinct sets 
S = {s1 , s2 , 
••. , Sn} , the intersection graph 
I(S) 
has point set 
S 
and adjacency is defined 

6 
by Si adj Sj 
if Sin Sj f $ • 
Figure 7 depicts the intersection graph obtained 
from certain subtrees of a tree T • 
Notice that I(S) 
is chordal, and in fact, 
maximal outerplanar. 
Buneman [1] characterized chordal graphs in this way. 
Theorem 4. 
A graph G is chordal if and only if G is the intersection graph of 
subtrees of a tree.

COSPECTRAL TREES 
The spectrum S(G) 
of a graph 
G of order p is defined as the non-increasing 
sequence of the p real eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of 
G 
Two graphs are 
cospectral if they have the same spectrum. 
For example, it is no trouble to calculate 
that the two graphs of Figure 8 have the spectrum S(c4 U K1) = S(K1 , 4)= (2,0,0,0,-2). 
Figure 8. 
The Smallest Pair of Cospectral Graphs 

7 
This example demonstrates the fallacy of the casual but ambitious conjecture that 
the spectrum determines the graph. 
Still, one might hope that the conjecture holds 
for some nontrivial subclass of graphs. 
Thus we are naturally led to search for 
cospectral trees. 
Collatz and Sinogowitz (2] found the smallest cospectral pair, 
shown in Figure 9. 
Yet, among small trees, cospectral pairs are rare, and we might 
Figure 9. 
The Smallest Cospectral Pair of Trees 
expect that most trees do not have a cospectral mate, that is, another tree with 
the same spectrum. 
Schwenk [11] has shown that quite the opposite is true, 
Theorem 5. 
Almost every tree has a cospectral mate. 
The proof of this result is a combinatorial tour de force. 
It relies on a 
construction that produces some of the possible cospectral pairs by demonstrating 
that a certain pair of 8-line subtrees can be substituted for one another without 
altering the spectrum. 
Then a counting argument, interesting in its own right, is 
given to show that almost every tree has one of these two particular subtrees. 
A 
branch at v 
of a tree is a maximal subtree having v 
as an endpoint. 
A limb at v 
is the union of one or more branches at v • 
The weight of a limb is the number of 
lines in it. 
Schwenk found that the number of trees having 
L as a limb depends 
solely upon the weight of 
L , and not upon its structure. 
Furthermore, as the 
number of points increases, the fraction of trees having a fixed 
L as a limb tends 
to one. 
6. 
THE PROBABILITY OF AN ENDPOINT 
R~nyi (9] found that if a point is chosen at random from among all the labeled 
n point trees, the probability of an endpoint approaches 1/e as 
n 
increases. 

8 
To verify this, note that there are n 
ways to label a prospective endpoint, there 
are (n-l)n-3 
possible labeled trees of order n-1 to which this endpoint can be 
added and 
(n-1) 
ways to join it to each such tree. 
Thus, there are n(n-l)n-2 
endpoints among all the n-point labeled trees. 
Of course, the total number of points 
among all labeled trees of order 
n 
is just n·nn-2 , and so the probability of an 
endpoint is precisely 
n-2 
which clearly approaches 1/e • 
( 
1 ) n-2 
1--n 
The corresponding question for unlabeled trees remained unsolved until very 
recently when B. Mayhew, a sociologist, stimulated our interest by conjecturing, on 
the basis of data for 
n < 12 , that the limit in this case is 1/2 • 
Our approach 
~0] is to enumerate 
en , the total number of endpoints among n-point trees, and 
e 
then determine the asymptotic behavior of the probability pn 
n 
n • t n 
An illustration is helpful, to distinguish between trees and labeled trees. 
The two trees of order 4 are the path P4 
and the star K1 , 3 shown in Figure 10. 
Kl,3 :

The Trees of Order 4 
There are 8 points in these two trees, of which 5 are endpoints so that P4 = 5/8. 
However, there are 12 ways to label 
P4 and 4waystolabelK1 , 3 so that for labeled 
trees of order 4, the probability of an endpoint is 9/16 • 
To calculate p , we use P6lya's asympotic estimate [8] for rooted trees Tn 
n 
and develop analogous results for En, the number of endpoints in n-point planted 
trees, in which the plant is counted neither as an endpoint nor among then points, 
Let p denote the common radius of convergence of the series T(x), t(x), E(x), and 
e(x). 
As found by P6lya [8], p = 0.338 ....

A SURVEY OF GENERALIZED RAMSEY THEORY 
Frank Har2£Y 
University of Michigan 
ABSTRACT 
This is a progress report on a very dynamic branch of graph theory. 
We 
begin with a historical review of the origins of generalized ramsey theory and 
then indicate the small graphs for which the diagonal ramsey number~ are now 
known. 
The ramsey multiplicity of a graph is taken up and applied to ramsey 
games. 
We conclude with a listing of those families of graphs for which the 
ramsey numbers have been determined. 
There still does not exist any general 
powerful method for computing ramsey numbers.

A SURVEY OF GENERALIZED RAMSEY THEORY 
1. 
HISTORICAL OBSERVATIONS 
An account of the generalized ramsey theory of graphs must begin with Ramsey 
[24]. 
We state two of his results strictly in terms of pairs of complete graphs. 
Theorem 1. 
(Ramsey) 
If G has a countably infinite point set, then either G or 
G contains the complete graph of order ~ 0 as a subgraph. 
This result is conveniently restated in terms of coloring the lines of a 
graph. 
A 2-coloring of the complete graph 
Kp 
results when each of its lines is 
colored red or green. 
Thus Theorem 
1 asserts that every 2-coloring of the complete 
graph 
K of order }i 0 
must contain a monochromatic 
K 
Theorem 2. 
(Ramsey) 
For any two positive integers m,n 
there exists a minimum 
integer p 
such that every 2-coloring of 
Kp 
contains a green 
Km 
or a red 
Kn 
The author's personal discovery of generalized ramsey theory for graphs took 
place during a survey lecture by Erd~s [12] on conventional ramsey numbers given at 
the seminar on graph theory at University College London in October 1962. 
It seemed 
natural to me to study ramsey numbers not only for complete graphs but for arbitrary 
graphs. 
Fully eight years later, I had the pleasure of attending the scintillating 
doctoral dissertation defense of V. Chvatal on ramsey numbers for hypergraphs. 
Chvatal and I immediately launched our joint research effort which led to papers 
[6, 7, 8, 9]. 
Only later did we learn that other authors were independently dis-
covering generalized ramsey theory for graphs, see Burr [1], Cockayne [10], 
Gerencs~r and Gyarfas [16], and Parsons [23]. 
2. 
RAMSEY NUMBERS FOR SMALL GRAPHS 
It is useful to obtain the ramsey numbers for small graphs in order to have 
data for making conjectures. 
Also, as Burr [1] observed, these small cases often 
provide the starting point for inductive proofs, but must be proved independently. 
All graphs considered have no isolated points. 
Chvatal and I [8,9] obtained the 

12 
ramsey numbers for all pairs of graphs with at most four points, 
Chvatal and 
Clancy [5] are extending this effort to the diagonal numbers for five point graphs. 
A complete solution cannot be expected quickly since that would include as just 
one case the classical ramsey number 
r(K5) , a most difficult unsolved combinator-
ial problem. 
Burr [2] recognized this roadblock, and so he chose to extend our re-
sults to all graphs with at most six lines, 
Thus, in the extreme case of 
6K2 he 
permitted as many as 12 points, but avoided the complications caused by having too 
many lines. 
Figure 1 provides the diagonal ramsey numbers for the graphs with at most 
four points, following the notation for graphs in the book [18].

RAMSEY MULTIPLICITY 
Once one knows the diagonal ramsey number 
r(F) = p , one may then ask just 
how many monochromatic 
F must occur when 
K p 
is 2-colored. 
This invariant 
R(F) 
is called the ramsey multiplicity. The off~diagonal multiplicity R(F1,F2) is de-
fined similarly. 
Since it provides more detailed information than the usual ramsey 
number, it is a more difficult value to establish, Stars constitute the only family 
for which the ramsey multiplicities are known: 
{:. 
if n 
is even 
R(K1 ,n) = 
if n is odd 
Note that the multiplicity of 
2n for stars with n 
odd was misprinted as 
n 
in 
[20]. 
The multiplicities given for the first eight graphs in Figure 1 were determined 
in [22]. 
There, a 2-·coloring of K10 was given to demonstrate that 
R(K4 -x) 2_ 15 • 

13 
A. J. Schwenk has just demonstrated that 
R(K4-x) ~ 15 , and we present his proof. 
Consider a 2-coloring of 
K10 attaining the minimum possible number of mono-
chromatic 
K4 - x • 
Let tij be the number of monochromatic triangles containing 
line vivj 
It is clear that each choice of two monochromatic triangles containing 
vivj 
produces a unique monochromatic K4 - x 
having vivj 
as its diagonal. 
Thus, 
the ramsey multiplicity is given by 
(1) 
-L-=1_ 
-
2 
since we are considering an optimal 2-coloring of 
K10 • 
Now a result of Goodman 
[17] reformulated by Schwenk [26] demonstrates that the minimum number of monochro-
matic triangles is bounded by 
(2) 
For p 
10, this yields 
(3) 
Or equivalently, multiplying by 3 we obtain 
(4) 
"t .. > 60 
L 
l.J-
The minimum possible value for (1) occurs w·hen each line vivj 
of 
K10 has the 
smallest possible value of tij subject to the provision (4). 
This clearly occurs 
when equality is attained in (4) and each individual value of tij is as close to 
the average value as possible. 
Since K10 
has 45 lines, this requires 30 lines with 
tij = 1 
and 15 with tij = 2 . 
Using this information as a bound for the right side 
of equation (1), we obtain the desired lower bound: 
R(K4-x) > 15 
Together with the 2-coloring in [22] containing only 15 monochromatic 
K4 - x, this 
establishes the ramsey multiplicity. 
The multiplicity of the complete graph K4 
has not even be~n conjectured as yet. 

14 
The only graphs 
F with R(F) = 1 
known to date are K2 
and the stars 
K l,n 
with n even. 
This led us to conjecture that these are the only graphs with ramsey 
multiplicity one! 
We offerred during a lecture in Oberwolfach, June 1972, U.S. $100 
for the first solution to this conjecture. 
One of the graph theorists present im-· 
mediately protested, "No, no, please make it 300 D.M. and pay us in real money, not 
play money". 
4. 
RAMSEY GAMES 
In our preceding review [20] of generalized ramsey theory, we described four 
ramsey games called (1) avoidance (of the first monochromatic triangle), (2)achieve-
ment, (3) minimization and (4) maximization. 
There are new developments concerning 
games (1) and (2). 
Game (1) was popularized by Gardner [15] who pointed out that 
Simmons [27] named it similarly to himself by calling it 'SIM' • 
It is my considered 
opinion that 'RAM' would be more apt, not only after Ramsey, but because the winner 
has rammed a triangle down the loser's throat. 
Simmons devised a computer program 
which demonstrated exhaustively that the ·game is a second player win and which de-
feated all human opponents who made the first move. 
Very recently A. Rosa (not yet 
published) proved that the RAM player with the second move can force a victory. 
The 
RAM game for a quadrilateral c4 is much more subtle since it ·:>ften happens that a 
monochromatic c4 is formed on the six given vertices without either player realizing 
it. Of course RAM c5 
would be even more delicate, both for recognition and 
because it is played on nine vertices. 
Game (2) is quite trivial since the first player can construct a monochromatic 
triangle of his own color within four moves, and in fact without even using the 
sixth vertex. 
This achievement game for c4 
is again not as obvious. 
For Games (3) and (4), an exhaustive listing of the 2-colorings of 
K6 
which 
contain exactly R(K3) = 2 
monochromatic triangles 
T1 
and 
T2 is given in [19]. 
It is proved there that in such a 2-coloring of 
K6 , the triangles T1 
and T2 have 
just one common point if and only if they have different colors. 
Hence, there can 
only be a minimum total score draw when the two players form one triangle each, 
with one point in common.

FAMILIES OF GRAPHS 
Although Burr [1] presents a comprehensive list of those ramsey numbers which 
have been found for families of graphs, we include here, for the sake of complete-
ness, a smaller list. 
Whenever two members of the same family are compared we take the convention 
m ~ n . 
But when different families are confronted, such as paths and cycles, 
m 
and 
n are arbitrary.

max {6,n-l+m/2, 
(2m-l) (n-2[n/2]), 
(2n-l) (m-2[m/2])} 
The last two formulas in this list are not usually written in this way, but 
were so recast by the fiendish efforts of A. J. Schwenk. 
Compare the formulas in 
Burr [1]. 
Ramsey numbers for digraphs were introduced in [21] where it was observed 
that 
r(D1 , Dz) 
exists if and only at least one of n1 , n2 is acyclic. 
The 
ramsey numbers of all acyclic digraphs with p ~ 4 points were determined. 
Also 
the ramsey numbers for transitive tournaments, 
R(Tm , Tn) 
were demonstrated to be 
equal to those for complete graphs, 
r(Km , Kn) 
The only family of digraphs for whi.ch the ramsey numbers have been determined 
are the directed paths, [28]:

A SURVEY OF THE RECONSTRUCTION CONJECTURE 
Frank Harary 
University of Michigan 
and Oxford University 
ABSTRACT 
We begin by tracing the history of the Reconstruction Conjecture (RC) for 
graphs. 
After describing the RC as the problem of reconstructing a graph G 
from a given deck of cards, each containing just one point-deleted subgraph of G, 
we proceed to derive information about G which is deducible from this deck. 
Various theorems proving the RC for trees are then taken up. 
The status of 
the RC for digraphs is reported. 
Several variations of the RC are stated and 
partial results obtained to date are indicated. 
We conclude with a summary of 
structures other than trees which have been reconstructed, and some remarks on the 
reconstruction of countably infinite graphs.

A SURVEY OF THE RECONSTRUCTION CONJECTURE 
1. 
HISTORICAL NOTES 
The author first heard of this fascinating problem when Kelly [30] proved the 
theorem for trees in 1957. 
This result was obtained in Kelly's doctoral disserta-
tion which was written under Ulam, who published [45] a statement of the problem 
in 1960 (although it was already known to him in 1929, when he assiduously collect-
ed mathematical problems posed by his fellow graduate students and professors in 
Lw6w, Poland.) 
This has led to some confusion concerning whose name should be 
attached to this conjecture. 
The solution which I recommend heartily is to refer 
to this problem henceforth as the Reconstruction Conjecture. 
In Ulam [ 45, p. 29], the following statement appears: 
"Algebraic Problem 1. 
Suppose that in two sets A and B, each of n elements, there is defined a distance 
function p for every pair of distinct points, with values either 1 or 2, and 
p(p,p) = 0 • Assume that for every subset of n- 1 points of A , there exists an 
isometric system of n - 1 points of B , and that the number of distinct subsets 
isometric to any given subset of n - 1 points is the same in A as in B . 
Are A and 
B isometric?" 
In terms of graphs, this becomes the following: 
Problem 1'. If G and Hare graphs with points sets {v1 , •.• ,vp} and {u1 , ... up} , 
p ~ 3 , and if for all i , the subgraphs G - vi and H - ui are isomorphic, then G 
and H are themselves isomorphic. 
This is the form of the problem which Kelly [30] solved for two trees T and S. 
It seemed to me that more information than necessary was entailed in this statement 
of Problem 1' and I proposed in [21] the following alternate version: 
Reconstruction Conjecture (RC). 
If G is a graph with p ~ 3 points and if the p 
subgraphs G - vi are given, then the entire graph G can be reconstructed, uniquely 
up to isomorphism, from these point-deleted subgraphs. 
Speaking very technically, the RC involves the determination of the structure 

20 
of G, whereas Problem 1' only asks for a proof of the existence of an isomorphism. 
Nevertheless, these two statements are logically equivalent. 
It is convenient and intuitively helpful to associate with a graph G of 
order p, a deck of p numbered cards with the i'th card containing a drawing of 
the point-deleted subgraph Gi = G - vi . 
We assume throughout that each given 
deck of c~rds is legitimate, that is, it actually comes from a graph in this way. 
Incidentally, the problem of characterizing legitimate decks appears to be as 
difficult as the RC itself. 
Why is p ~ 3 taken as part of the hypothesis of the RC? 
Because the two 
graphs of order 2, K2 and K2 , have identical decks of cards. 
Trivially the 
only smaller graph K1 has a deck consisting of one blank card. 
Henceforth, graph 
G always has at least 3 points. 
Since these beginnings, the literature on the RC has grown explosively; see 
[1] -
[45]. 
This bibliography of the RC was carefully compiled by B. Manvel, as 
an extension of the list of references in his elegant doctoral dissertation, [34]. 
2. INFORMATION ABOUT G INFERRABLE FROM THE Gi 
One approach to the reconstruction problem (other than trying at one fell 
swoop to prove or disprove it) is to glean as much information about G as possible 
from the deck of subgraphs. 
Each additional invariant of G which is found from 
the Gi serves a double purpose: 
supporting our faith in the conjecture and pro-
viding the remote possibility that this item of information might just be the 
crucial step needed to prove that G is reconstructible. 
We find at once the number p of points in G either by simply counting the 
cards or by counting the points on one card and adding 1. 
Determining the number 
q of lines in G is slightly more complicated. 
Let qi be the number of lines in Gi , 
which is known by inspecting card i , and let di be the degree of vi , which is not 
yet known. 
Then clearly q 
qi + di , and summing these equalities over i yields 
pq = Eq + Ed 
i 
i 
But the first theorem of graph theory [20, p. 14] asserts that Edi 
2q , which 

21 
enables us to solve the above equality for q: 
This may be viewed as finding the number of subgraphs K2 in G. 
A similar argu-
ment [19, 21, 24] counts the number of occurrences of any subgraph H with fewer 
points than G. 
Thus, for example, we can find the number of cycles Cn and complete 
subgraphs Kn provided n < p (but not the number of hamiltonian cycles or paths). 
A little theorem [21] notes that G is connected if and only if at least two 
of the Gi are. 
For if G is connected, two points at maximum distance cannot be 
cutpoints, and so those two G are connected. 
Conversely, if G< is connected, 
i 
• 
either G isconnected or else vi is isolated in G. 
But if two Gi are connected, 
both points cannot be isolated, and so G must be connected. 
Consider a given legitimate deck. 
We begin by examining the deck to determine 
if G is connected. 
If not, we can reconstruct G, as noted by Kelly [32], Harary 
[21], and Chartrand and Kronk[9]. 
On the other hand, if G is connected, the ques-
tion, of course, remains open. 
Therefore, we can assume henceforth that G is 
connected. 
Also note that since the complement of G- vi is identical to G- vi , we 
may replace any legitimate deck by its complementary deck and attempt to recon-
struct G , from which we can obtain G by complementation. 
Thus, Kelly [30] also 
concluded that a graph with disconnected complement is reconstructible. 
Other deducible information about G includes the cycle rank m = q - p + 1, at 
once,since p and q are known. 
The connectivity K of G is by definition given by 
K 
1 + minK 
i 
Obviously the number c of cutpoints of G is the number of disconnected Gi. 
To 
obtain the number b of blocks, let ki be the known number of components in Gi. 
It 
was shown in [18] that b satisfies the formula: 
b = 1 + E(ki - 1) 

22 
3. TREES. 
Like so many other problems in graph theory, the Reconstruction Conjecture 
when stated for trees becomes much easier. 
As mentioned earlier, Kelly proved the 
RC for trees. 
One should note that he need not be told in advance that the graph 
G he is attempting to reconstruct is a tree, for he can quickly determine that G 
is connected and q 
p - 1 • 
However, Harary and Palmer [27] observed that as 
soon as we know that T is a tree, we no longer need many of the cards in the 
deck. 
In fact, we can throw away all the cards not resulting from the removal of 
an endpoint of T (all the disconnected Ti) 
and still reconstruct T! 
Bondy 
carried this a step further. 
A point of tree T is called peripheral if it is an 
endpoint of some longest path. 
Clearly a peripheral point must be an endpoint, but 
not all endpoints are peripheral. 
For example, the tree in Figure 1 has 9 points, 
of which 5 are endpoints, of which 3 are peripheral points. 
Bondy [3] found that 
trees can be reconstructed from their peripheral point-deleted subgraphs. 
>_____,__! ---t---1 ---
Figure 1. 
A tree. 
Another variation of the RC occurs if we throw out multiple occurrences of the 
same card, so that each remaining card is unique. 
This variation is called 
"set-reconstruction," since we are given the set of point-deleted subgraphs, but 
we are not told the multiplicity of each subgraph. 
Manvel [36] showed that trees 
are endpoint set-reconstructible except for the two pairs shown in Figure 2.

It is rumored that it has been proved that the cards obtained from endpoints 
can be thrown away, and then T can be reconstructed from the remaining cutpoint-
deleted subgraphs. 
In general, we seem to have much more information than necessary to reconstruct 
trees, as observed by A.J. Schwenk. 
For example, we could discard a card at random 
from the deck. 
A count of the lines in the remaining deck would still suffice to 
decide whether the discarded card was obtained from an endpoint or a cutpoint. 
In 
either case, the opposite subdeck of cards, i.e.,the cutpoint cards or the endpoint 
cards respectively, remains intact and can be used to recontruct T (if this rumor, 
which I started, is in fact true). 
This suggests the following question: 
How 
many cards can be discarded at random from a full deck obtained from a tree T and 
still guarantee that T is recontructible? 
For 2 discards, there are nonreconstruc-
tible pairs on 4 and 5 points (see Figure 3), but all larger trees seem to be 
reconstructible.

DIGRAPH RECONSTRUCTION. 
Since disconnected graphs are reconstructible, we formulated the analogous 
problem for digraphs and in [24], we demonstrated that every digraph D with 
p ~ 5 which is not strongly connected is reconstructible from its point-deleted 
subdigraphs D1 
The reason for the restriction p ~ 5 is that the two tournaments 
T1 and T2 of Figure 4 serve as a counterexample for p = 4. 
In each of T1 and T2 
the subdigraphs consist of one cyclic triple and three transitive triples.

A pair of nonreconstructible tournaments 
Beineke and Parker [2] found two additional pairs of nonreconstructible 
strong tournaments, of order 5 and 6. 
Hence we now believe that the following 
statement is true. 
RC for strong Digraphs. 
Every strong digraph of order p > 7 is reconstructible.

VARIATIONS 
We have just examined several variations on the standard reconstruction 
problem for trees. 
Similarly, Table 1 suggests two dozen reconstruction problems: 
to reconstruct each of the six types of structures listed from one of the four 
types of decks given. 
Of course, there is practically no limit to the additional 
variations one might propose. 
Reconstruct: 
graphs 
multigraphs 
digraphs 
tournaments 
relations 
networks 
From: 
point-deleted subgraphs 
line- (or arc-) deleted subgraphs 
set of point-deleted subgraphs 
set of line- (or arc-) deleted 
sub graphs 
Table 1. 
Twenty four reconstruction problems 
Manvel aud Stockmeyer [43] reconstructed n x n matrices from the n principal 
minors. 
It might seem that this should imply the RC by reconstructing the adja-

25 
cency matrix A(G), but a second glance reveals that the minors retain the relative 
order of the n - 1 remaining rows and columns whereas the deck of point-deleted 
subgraphs loses that information. 
Thus, it is not surprising that square matrices 
are much easier to reconstruct than graphs. 
Lovasz [33] recently verified the Line-Reconstruction Conjecture when G has 
at least half the possible lines, that is, when 
The unrestricted L-RC remains unsolved. 
There are structures for which the RC has been settled.* Manvel extended the 
RC to structures other than trees by proving it for unicyclic graphs in [35]. 
This 
was soon superseded by a proof for casti by Geller and Manvel [42]. 
Manvel [39] and Giles [14] proved the RC for maximal outplanar graphs. 
And 
now Giles [15] has a proof for any outerplanar graph. 
A proof for planar graphs 
continues to be elusive, but everyone believes the RC to be true for planar graphs 
and in fact to be true for graphs.** 
Square-celled animals were reconstructed by Harary and Manvel [23]. 
Finally, a result for matroids by Brylawski IBJ specializes to graphs as 
follows. 
Given the q chromatic polynomials of the line-deleted subgraphs G - xj , 
the chromatic polynomial of G can be determined. 
6. 
INFINITE GRAPHS 
There is nothing to keep us from stating the RC for countably infinite graphs, 
but the methods and partial results are so different from (finite) graphs that it 
is proper to consider the problems separately. 
The first result on the infinite 
RC was a nonreconstructible pair due to Fisher [12]. 
Later, at the author's 
farewell party from his 1970 Visiting Professorship at the University of Waterloo, 
*The definitions of these structures can be found in the book [20]. 
**The reconstruction of labeled graphs was also studied by Harary and 
Manvel [22]. 

26 
we found [13] a much simpler nonreconstructible pair: Let G be the infinite 
tree which is regular of countable degree, and let H be the forest consisting of 
two copies of G. 
All the point-deleted subgraphs of G and H are identical, namely, 
a countable number of copies of G. 
Thus G and H are a nonreconstructible pair. 
Notice that we cannot even distinguish between a connected and a disconnected 
infinite graph. 
In fact, the information we obtain so easily for (finite) graphs 
always seems to be much more difficult for infinite graphs. 
An infinite graph whose points have finite degree is called locally finite. 
If only finitely many points have infinite degree, we say it is almost locally 
finite. 
Similarly, G is almost r-regular if only finitely many points have degree 
+ r. 
Using this condition to forbid the offending pair described above, we recon-
structed [28] almost r-regular infinite forests. 
Bondy and Hemminger [5,6] also 
succeeded in reconstructing infinite forests with certain severe restrictions on the 
number of infinite paths present. 
Both of these approaches effectively limit the 
permitted structural variations to such an extent as to make the reconstruction 
possible. 
In general, it also appears true that all infinite trees are reconstruc-
tible.

RECENT RESULTS ON GRAPHICAL ENUMERATION 
Frank Harary 
University of Michigan 
ABSTRACT 
We present four of our counting results which are to appear soon in various 
journals. 
These comprise: 
(1) the number of caterpillars, (2) the number of 
self-complementary configurations, (3) the number of achiral trees, and (4) the 
probability of an endpoint in a large random tree. 
We conclude with a brief 
mention of four miscellaneous results.

RECENT RESULTS ON GRAPHICAL ENUMERATION 
1. 
CATERPILLARS 
For a connected graph G with at least 3 points, the derived graph G' is formed 
by deleting the endpoints of G . A caterpillar is a tree T whose derived graph T' 
is a path. 
Theorem 1 of [5] was presented as a characterization of trees with hamil-
tonian square, but it can equally well be viewed as characterizing caterpillars. 
We 
restate it here from this point of view. 
Theorem 1. 
For any tree T with at least 3 points, the following statements are 
equivalent: 
(1) 
T is a caterpillar. 
(2) 
T2 
is hamiltonian. 
(3) 
T does not contain the subdivision graph 
S(K1 3) 
as a subtree. 
' 
Of course, many caterpillars may have the same path P 
as their derived tree. 
n 
However, it is possible to mark each point of Pn with the number of endpoints that 
were joined to it in T 
Having done this, there is clearly a one-to-one correspon-
dence between such weighted paths and caterpillars. 
In fact, it is convenient to add 
1 
to each weight to account for that point itself in addition to the endpoints joined 
to it, so that each weight is a positive integer. 
Certainly, this does not disturb 
the correspondence, and it has the advantage of making a weighted path P 
with total 
n 
weight 
p 
correspond to a caterpillar T with p points. 
Since the series x/(1- x) = x + x2 + x3 + ... provides the possible weights 
of 1, 2, 3, •.• , we may apply P6lya's theorem [6, Chapter 2] with x/(1- x) 
as 
the figure counting series and 
r(Pn) 
as the configuration group to enumerate cater-
pillars of weight 
p whose derived tree is 
p n 
Let 
cp 
be the number of p-point 
caterpillars, 
p ~ 3 , and define the generating function c(x) = f:c 
xp . Then we 
p 
have just seen that 
(1) 
c(x) 
x 2 
L Z(f(Pn)); 
n=l 

But the path 
(2) 
Writing 
p 
(3) 
31 
p n 
has just two automorphisms, and this formula simplifies to 
c(x) 
(1 -
2x) (1 -
2x2) 
n + 4 , (2) yields 
as the explicit number of caterpillars. 
The formula (3) can also be obtained by a 
direct argument, given in [9] 
which is much less elegant. 
2. 
SELF-COMPLEMENTARY CONFIGURATIONS 
The result in [3] is illustrated nicely by the graphs of order 4. 
The number of 
such graphs is g4 = 11 and we write 
gpq 
for the number of graphs with p points and 
q lines. 
Let 
s 
be the number of self-complementary graphs of order 
p 
p 
have the two equations 
(4) 
(5) 
s p 
L 
q 
L (-l)q g 
q 
pq 
Then we 
the first by definition and the second as proved in [3] by applying a result of Read 
[11] . 
For 
p = 4 , equation (5) gives 
54 = 1 - 1 + 2 - 3 + 2 - 1 + 1 = 1 
and the only self-complementary graph of order 4 is the path 
P4 . 
A similar formula 
holds for uigraphs. 
Let the number of self-complementary digraphs of order 
p 
be 
! 
Then with 
d 
denoting the number of digraphs with 
p points and 
q arcs, 
p 
pq 
we find from [3] that 
(6) 
which gives for 
p 
3 
~ 
s p 
L (-l)q d 
q 
pq 
1 - 1 + 4 - 4 + 4 - 1 + 1 
4 

32 
Thus all 4 digraphs with 3 points and 3 arcs are self-complementary. 
Both (5) and 
(6) are special cases of a general formula for the number of self-complementary con-
figurations with equivalence determined by a specified permutation group. 
3. 
ACHIRAL TREES 
A plane tree is an embedding of a tree in the plane. 
A chiral plane tree is one 
whose mirror image is a different plane tree; otherwise it is achiral. 
These con-
cepts are illustrated in Figure 1 which shows three different plane embeddings of 
the same tree. 
(a) 
(c) 
Figure 1. 
Three Different Plane Trees 
The plane trees (a) and (b) are both chiral and are reflections of each other, while 
(c) is an achiral plane tree. 
My interest in this topic stems from the November 1970 conference in Paris on 
"Chirality from Biology to Mathematics" which was attended predominantly by theore-
tical chemists, some of whom presented ideas such as the chiral and achiral letters 
of the Roman alphabet. 
During a drive shortly thereafter from Ann Arbor to Waterloo 
with R. W. Robinson, we explored the possibility of applying chirality to plane trees, 
but did not have the opportunity to write up our results until! two years later, when 
he was visiting professor at the University of Michigan. 
Surprisingly, we found [8] that the number of planted (rooted at an endpoint) 
achiral plane trees of order 
n 
equals the number of unrooted ones, and that the 
number of rooted ones is 
2n-2 
However, in spite of much effort, we could not 

33 
find any straightforward method for proving that this power of 2 is the counting 
formula. 
We define a tree T to be partially achiral if some plane embedding is achiral; 
it is (totally) achiral if every plane embedding is achiral. 
In [8], we also counted 
both partially achiral trees and achiral trees, but the formulas are not simple. 
4. 
THE PROBABILITY OF AN ENDPOINT 
We determined in [12] the probability that a point chosen arbitrarily from a 
large random tree is an endpoint and found that this value approaches .438156235664 •••• 
We gave a brief account of this result in [5], describing the asymptotic aspect of 
theanalysis. 
We describe the enumerative aspects of this result. 
Let 
t(x) 
and 
T(x) 
denote the generating functions for trees and rooted trees. 
The usual method for counting trees [6, Chap. 2] relies on the equations 
(7) 
t(x) 
(8) 
T(x) 
x exp 'f T(xi)/i 
1 
Obviously the number of planted trees on 
n + 1 
points is identical to the number of 
rooted trees on 
n 
points. 
Thus if we define P(x) 
to be the generating function 
for planted trees in which the plant is not counted as a point, we have the identity 
P (x) = T (x) 
Consequently, it is possible to replace 
T by 
P 
in (7) and (8) to 
obtain an equivalent pair of equations. 
In order to compute the probability of an endpoint, we must find 
en , the total 
number of endpoints among all n-point trees, and divide this by ntn , the total number 
of points present. 
To find 
en , we define two new generating functions on two vari-
ables. 
and 
m endpoints, and let P(x,y) 
where 
t 
is the number of trees with 
n points 
nm 
p 
is the number of planted 
nm 
trees with 
n 
points and 
m endpoints, in which again the plant has not been counted 

34 
either as a point or as an endpoint. 
This exclusion of the plant serves to simplify 
the resulting formulas. 
There should be no confusion between the generating functions 
t(x) 
and t(x,y) 
because the number of variables indicates the context; similarly 
for 
P 
Notice that t(x) = t(x,l) 
and 
P(x) = P(x,l) 
Arguments analogous to the traditional ones used to obtain (7) and (8) yield 
(9) 
t(x,y)

xy - x + x exp 
l P(xi , yi) I i 
i=l 
It is easy to see that these reduce to (7) and (8) on substituting y = 1 . 
We now display a simple but useful enumerative device. 
Take the partial deri-
vative of t(x,y) with respect to y 
and then evaluate it at y = 1 
to obtain 
(11) 
That is, each tree with m endpoints is counted with weight m toward the coefficient 
of 
n 
X 
In other words, 
en , the total number of endpoints among all n-point trees, 
is the coefficient of 
n 
X 
in 
t (x,l) • 
y 
This is expressed concisely by defining 
e(x) = E e xn , so that e(x) 
n 
t (x,l) 
y 
Equations (9) and (10) are used to evaluate the partial derivative and arrive at 
an asymptotic estimate for 
en which leads to the estimation of the limiting value 
of the probability given above. 
5. 
MISCELLANEOUS RESULTS 
A tapeworm is defined as a simplified variation on square-celled animals [ 6, p. 234] 
in which the growth pattern is "linear" but need not be planar. We found in [7) that the 
number of tapeworms with an even number 
2n + 2 of cells is (32n + 2.3n + l)/4while 
the number with 
2n + 3 cells is (32n+l + 4.3n + 1)/4 • 

35 
In order to develop an application of the counting of achiral trees described in 
Section 3 above to hydrocarbon compounds as they occur in euclidean 3-space, weworked 
out (1] analogous formulas for "enantiomeric steric trees". These are chiral trees in 3 
dimensions in which the endpoints representing hydrogen atoms are distributed sym-
metrically about their adjacent carbon atom. 
The resulting formulas are similar in 
appearance to equations (7) and (8) above, with differences which reflect the pre-
sence of points of degrees 1 and 4 only and the chiral character of the configuration . 
Palmer and Robinson [10] succeeded in deriving a formula for the cycle index of 
the exponentiation group (see [6, p. 98]) of two given permutation groups. Ihadfirst 
introduced this binary operation on permutation groups for the purpose of counting 
bicolored graphs, but the general formula for this cycle index eluded me. Just as the 
other binary operations on permutation groups (product,cartesianproduct, composition) 
help to solve relevant problems in graphical enumeration by applying P6lya's Theorem 
using the respective cycle index, so does the cycle index of the exponentiation group 
settle some previously open questions. 
Finally, we mention a very recent result due to Chao [2]. 
In a symmetric graph 
G (see [4, p. 171]) all points are similar with regard to the group of 
Gand also 
all lines are similar. 
Chao showed that the number of labeled symmetric graphs of 
prime order 
p is: 
2 + <P -
2) 1 I d , 
where the sum is taken over all divisors d of (p - 1)/2. 
We conclude with the observation that the results presented here are indeed 
recent since only 1/4 of the references are now in print.

ABSTRACT 
The graph with no points and no lines is discussed critically. 
Arguments 
for and against its official admittance as a graph are presented.

IS THE NULL-GRAPH A POINTLESS CONCEPT? 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
It is well-known in set theory that the introduction of the seeminglyparadoxical 
null-set, having no elements, results in a considerable simplification of the state-
ment of theorems, relieving an author of having to make special provision for the 
possibility of there being no objects possessing the property which defines the 
elements of a certain set. 
Some writers in graph theory, presumably by imitation, 
have introduced the concept of a (or the) "null-graph" - having no points and no 
lines; see Figure 1. 
The advantages of such a concept are less obvious than those 
of the null-set, and we can reasonably question whether such advantages as it may 
have are not outweighed by extra complications that it introduces. 
We discuss here 
the pros and cons of the use of the null-graph. 
Note that it is not a question of 
whether the null-graph "really exists"; it is simply a question of whether there is 
any point in it.

CURRENT USAGE 
Let us start with a brief survey of how some well-known writers on graph theory 
have handled the null-graph, noting in particular that if a writer does not expli-
citly state that the set of points of a graph is non-empty, he has, by default, 
admitted the null-graph, even though he may subsequently pay no attention to it. 
Ore [7] makes no mention of the null-graph in the sense that we are using the 
term, but instead uses the adjective "null" to describe a graph consisting only of 
isolated points. 
One presumes, therefore, that since he regards as trivial a graph 
whose set of lines is empty, he would, ~ fortiori, discount the graph whose set of 
points is empty, even though he does not actually say so. 

39 
Berge [1] and Wagner [13] do not explicitly state that the set of points is 
non-empty, and hence, by default, admit the null-graph. 
However, the null-graph is 
never mentioned as such, and hence one may assume that they do not intend it to be 
regarded as a graph. 
Kllnig [S] distinguishes between the null-graph and "proper" graphs (eigentlichen 
Graphen). 
He adds that the adjective "proper" will be omitted when the context makes 
it clear what is meant. 
He thus recognizes the problem, but surmounts it by what are 
perhaps somewhat unsatisfactory methods. 
Sedlacek [11], Zykov [14], and Busacker 
and Saaty [2] all define the set of vertices of a graph to be non-empty, thus ex-
plicitly excluding the null-graph. 
In complete contrast, Tutte [12] specifically admits the null-graph and refers 
to it as a graph. 
Many of his theorems apply to the null-graph as well as other 
graphs, but many do not. 
In consequence, the statements of a large number of theo-
rems in his book contain the proviso that the graphs to which they refer must not 
be the null-graph. 
Sachs [10] also explicitly defines the null-graph. 
Perhaps the most enthusiastic proponents of the null-graph are Maxwell and 
Reed [6], who in their own words, give to the null-graph "full-fledged membership 
in the 'society' of graphs." 
They realize, however, that "the acceptance of the 
null-graph has the aspect of both simplifying and complicating the development of 
the theory of graphs." 
In Section 2.9 of their book, they present an amusing but 
somewhat confused discussion of "this paradoxical beast - the null-graph." 
In fact, 
they ask, "Does the null-graph possess all properties, or in fact, does it have no 
properties?", and infer that such questions "lead to a situation of absolute and 
utter chaos." Despite their apparent affection for it, they conclude by saying, 
"except on specific occasions, ••• the null-graph is ignored." 
As for the authors of this paper, one of us [4] is decisively opposed to the 
null-graph; the other is willing to afford it grudging recognition in certain con-
texts, but nevertheless, when called upon to give a definition of a graph [9] has 
required the point-set to be non-empty. 

40 
3. 
PRO 
We present three arguments in favor of the null-graph involving set theoretic 
considerations, the chromatic polynomial, and graphical enumeration. 
The most convincing argument in favor of admitting the null-graph is that this 
assures that the intersection of any two subgraphs of a given graph is always a 
subgraph. 
In particular, the collection of all subgraphs of G then forms a boolean 
algebra, in which the null-graph is the zero element. 
It is convenient to introduce a notation for the null-graph. 
By definition, 
a graph is complete if every pair of points are adjacent. 
Thus the null-graph is 
obviously, though vacuously, complete. 
It is becoming standard notation to write 
Kp 
for the complete graph with p points; hence the null-graph is K0 . 
A good 
example of this set theoretical use of 
K0 occurs in the theory of chromatic poly-
nomials. 
In the expository paper [8], the following results are given: 
(1) 
If a graph G has two components A and B, then 
where PG(A) 
denotes the chromatic polynomial of G. 
(2) 
If two graphs A and B intersect in a complete graph 
then the chromatic polynomial of their union is 
K p 
If K0 is admitted as a graph, these two results can be combined, (1) being 
the special case of (2) for 
p = 0 • 
All that is required is that we define 
PK (A) to be 1. 
This is perfectly natural; no matter what the number A of 
0 
colors, there is only one way to color the points of K0 , namely, do nothing! 
The chromatic polynomial o'f 
K p 
is 
A(p) = A(A- 1) ••• (A- p + 1) 
and we are therefore led to write 
A(O) = 1. 
This agrees with standard practice 
in combinatorial analysis. 

41 
Perhaps the most striking way in which the null-graph arises "naturally" 
in graph-theoretical research occurs in the theory of graphical enumeration. 
Consider, for example, the exponential generating function 
T(x) 
for labeled 
trees, defined by 
(3) 
T(x) 
I 
r=l 
T xn / n! 
n 
where 
Tn is the number of trees on n labeled points. It is well-known that 
T n 
n-2 
n 
Another result, not quite so well-known, is that the generating 
function F(x) 
for labeled forests is obtained by taking the formal exponential 
of 
T(x) 
(4) 
F(x) = exp 
T(x) 
Now the left-hand side of (4) contains the term "1", and if this refers to 
anything at all, it can only refer to the null-graph. 
A relation similar to (4) holds in more general applications between the 
numbers of labeled graphs and of connected labeled graphs of a certain kind. 
Let 
G(x) 
be the exponential generating function for such graphs and 
C(x) 
the cor-
responding function for the connected graphs. 
Then these two functions are related 
by an equation which is often written as 
(5) 
1 + G(x) 
exp C(x), 
or equivalently as 
(6) 
C(x) 
log(l + G(x)). 
Here the terms in both G and C correspond to non-null graphs only. 
In most enumeration problems, it is the counting result for all graphs of a 
specified type (not necessarily connected) which is obtained first, the result 
for connected graphs being derived from it by use of (6). 
The decision to take 
powers from 1 upwards is then a natural one; it avoids introducing the null-graph, 
but at the expense of having to insert a "1" into equation (5) in order to "make 
the answer come out right." 
On the other hand, when it is the connected result 

42 
which is obtained first (as in the labeled tree example above), the null-graph can 
be ignored only by hustling it out of sight after it has already made its appear-
ance. 
A similar phenomenon occurs with enumeration problems (3] for unlabeled graphs; 
for example, with the relation between the numbers 
gpq 
for graphs that are not 
necessarily connected. 
This relation is 
l: 
l: 
p=O 
q=O 
rr 
m=l 
n=O 
m n 
-gmn 
(1 -
X 
y ) 
Here again the null-graph 
(p = q = 0) 
occurs naturally on the left-hand 
side, but not on the right-hand side (we cannot have m = n = 0, 
or the whole 
right-hand side vanishes!) 
These examples show that the null-graph can arise naturally, without being 
specifically introduced. 
They also indicate that the null-graph must be regarded 
as not being connected! 
We shall consider below the paradox which this statement 
seems to imply. 
4. 
CONTRA 
The main objection to admitting the null-graph is that it has flagrantly 
contradictory properties. 
By one definition, a graph G is connected if every 
pair of points are joined by a path. 
As 
K0 has no points, this definition is 
vacuously satisfied. 
Thus 
K0 is connected. 
Clearly K0 is also acyclic since it contains no cycles; hence K0 is a 
tree. 
This opinion is shared by Tutte [12] who asserts in his Theorem 3.31 that 
"All null-graphs, vertex-graphs, and link-graphs are trees," by which he means 
K0 , 
K1 , 
and 
K2 are trees. 
However, by a~other definition, a graph is a tree if it is connected, and 
p = q + 1 • 
For 
K0 , 
p = q = 0 ; hence K0 is ~ 
a tree. 
But the graph 
K0 is acyclic and so by definition is a forest, but not a tree. 
One naturally 
concludes that K0 is in fact disconnected! 
This has already been suggested by 

43 
the enumeration argument in the preceding section. 
Confirmation of this conclusion 
is obtained if we take the definition of connected to mean that a graph has exactly 
one component; but K0 has no components at all. 
Perhaps surprisingly there is also an enumerational argument against the 
recognition of a null-graph. 
This is entailed in equation (6) above, where for-
tunately, the explicit presence of the term "1" enables one to expand the right-
hand member and thus express 
C(x) 
in powers of G(x). 
5. 
CONCLUDING REMARKS 
It can be seen from these examples that the main reason for the paradoxical 
nature of the null-graph is as follows. 
Many concepts in graph theory can be 
defined in several ways. 
When there are several possible definitions for a con-
cept, it is necessary that they be consistent, and for non-null graphs this is so. 
But since some authors admit the null-graph while others do not, it often happens 
that different definitions of a concept disagree when applied to the null-graph. 
It would presumably be possible to frame a set of definitions that would be' 
consistent even when applied to the null-graph, and would give to the null-graph 
the properties that it requires for those applications when it occurs naturally. 
To achieve this would be of limited usefulness, and the present authors have no 
intention of attempting to do so.

ABSTRACT 
The spectrum S(G) 
of a graph 
G of order p is defined as thenon-inareasing 
sequence of the p real eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of 
G • 
It has been 
found that certain graphs have an integral spectrum, i.e., every eigenvalue is an in-
teger. 
Thus, it is natural to ask just which graphs have this property. 
We develop 
a systematic approach to this question based on operations on graphs. The general 
problem appears intractable.

WHICH GRAPHS HAVE INTEGRAL SPECTRA? 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
Some graphs have a spectrum consisting entirely of integers. 
Our purpose is 
to ask which graphs have this integral spectrum property and to exhibit several 
families of such integral graphs. 
To illustrate, we begin by showing in Figure 1 
all integral cycles, together with their spectra. 
Our notation and terminology 
follow the book [2]. 
(2, -1, -1) 
(2, 0, 0, -2) 
(2, 1, 1, -1, -1, -2) 
Figure 1. 
The Three Integral Cycles 
That these are the only cycles 
Cn 
with integral spectrum follows at once from 
equation (11) of Collatz and Sinogowitz [1] which gives 
2 cos 2n/n as one of the 
eigenvalues. 
2. 
OPERATIONS 
This is a haphazard way of identifying integral graphs. A more systematic approach 
results from the use of operations on graphs. For given graphs G, G1 , G2 , recall that G 
is the complement of G and that G1 x G2 , G1 1\ G2 , G1 * G2 , G1 + G2 
denote respec-
tively the cartesian product, the conjunction, the strong product (which is the union 
of the preceding two), and the join of G1 and G2 . 
Schwenk [5] proved the following 
results concerning these operations. 
Theorem 1. 
If G is regular of degree r, then the spectrum cf G is 
(1) 
S (G) = {p - 1 - r} U {- 1 - S (G)} - {- 1 ..! r} • 
We note with amusement that the minus sign is used in four different ways in 
(1), but we trust that the meaning will be clear by context. 
Corollary 1. 
If a regular graph G is integral, then so is G 

47 
Example 1. 
Obviously 
S (~) consists entirely of zeros. 
By 
Corollary 1, 
every complete graph 
K p 
is integral and it is easily verified that 
(2) 
S(Kp) = (p- 1 , - 1 , - 1 , ••. , - 1) • 
Example 2. 
The triangular prism, Figure 2, must be integral by Corollary 1 
since its complement is the cycle c6 
(Figure 1). 
(3, 1, 0, o, -2, -2) 
Figure 2. 
The Triangular Prism 
Theorem 2. 
The spectrum of the cartesian product is given by 
which is the sum of each number in 
S(G1 ) 
with every number in 
S(G2) 
Corollary 2. 
If 
G1 
and 
G2 
are integral, then so is 
G1 x G2 
Example 3. 
Since the complete graphs are integral by Example 1, it follows 
from Corollary 2, that every cartesian product 
Km x ~ is integral. 
In particular, 
the triangular prism (Figure 2) is integral since it is K3 x K2 
Example 4. 
The cube 
Qn 
is the iterated cartesian product of 
n 
copies of 
K2 . 
Hence, it must be integral by 
Corollary 2 and it is easy to see that its 
spectrum contains the eigenvalues n, n-2 , n-4 , ..• where n-Zk 
has multiplicity 
(~; . 
Theorem 3. 
The spectrum of the conjunction is given by 
the product of each number in 
S (Gl) with every number in 
S (G2) . 
Corollary 3. 
If 
G1 
and G2 
are integral, then so is 
G1 A G2 
Example 5. 
Every conjunction 
~~Kn is integral. 
We have already encoun-
tered one member of this family since 
Because 
K

and 
Km A~ = ~ x ~ , we see that Examples 3 and 5 are equivalent. 
is regular 

48 
Theorem 4. The spectrum S (G1 *G2) of the strong product G1*G2 = G1 x G2 l) G1 1\ G2 
is the sequence of values 
A~ +A + ~ with 
A£S(G1) 
and 
~cS(G2 ) 
Corollary 4. 
If 
G1 
and G2 
are integral, so is 
G1 * c2 
It is well known [1] that if G is regular of degree 
r , then 
r 
is in S(G) 
Theorem 5. 
If G1 
and 
G2 
are regular of degrees 
r 1 
and r 2 , then the spectrum 
of their join is 
(5) 
Corollary 5. 
The join G1 + G2 
of two regular graphs is integral if and only if 
both G1 
and 
G2 
are integral and 
(r1 -
r 2) 2 + 
4p1 p2 
is a perfect square. 
Example 6. 
A complete bipartite graph 
K m,n is integral if and only if mn 
is square. 
Example 7. 
The join ~ + ~ is integral if and only if 
(n-1) 2 + 4 mn 
is 
square, by Corollary 5. 
This always holds for 
n = 2 
and m 
(k2) . 
In particular 
K3 + K2 
(Figure 3) is integral as already noted in [1]. 
Figure 3. 
An Integral Join 
Theorem 6. 
(Hoffman [3]) 
If 
G is regular of degree 
r ~ 2, then the spectrum 
of the line graph of 
G is given by 
(6) 
S(L(G)) = { (r -
2) + S(G)} U (-2 , -2 , ... , -2) 
where the number of occurrences of -2 is 
q -
p = p(r - 2)/2 . 
Corollary 6. 
If 
G is integral, so is its line graph. 

49 
Example 8. 
Every line graph 
L(Kp) 
is integral. 
In particular, the octahedron 
is integral since it is L(K4) • 
Furthermore the Pertersen graph 
P is seen to be 
integral by applying both Corollary 1 and Corollary 6 since P = L(K5) . 
3. 
INTEGRAL TREES 
There are several families of integral trees. 
One of these consists of trees 
of diameter 3. 
The smallest two members of this family are now displayed. 
For the 
tree T1 
of Figure 4, 
S(T1) = (2 , 1 , 0 , 0 , -1 , -2) • 
Other members of this 
family are not easily found. 
The next such tree is T2 in the figure. 
(2, 1, 0, 0, -1, -2) 
(3, 2, 10 (0)' -2, -3) 
Figure 4. 
Two Integral Trees of Diameter 3 
Another family of integral trees is provi.ded by the subdivision graphs of 
certain stars Kl,n 
Theorem 2 of [5] can be used to calculate the character-
istic polynomial of the subdivision graph of Kl,n and it is 
Example 9. 
The subdivision graph of star Kl,n is integral if and only if 
n + 1 , the number of points of the star, is a square. 
Thus the smallest member of this family is the tree of Figure 5, which by the 
way is also the smallest tree whose square is not hamiltonian. 
(2, 1, 1, o, -1, -1, -2)

OTHER INTEGRAL GRAPHS 
Finally, there are two other integral graphs [1] which we have not been able 
to identify as a member of a family. 
These are shown in Figure 6.

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS 
1. 
Which graphs have zero as an eigenvalue? 
For a tree T , it 
is well known that 
0 £ S(T) 
if and only if T has no !-factor. 
Otherwise, the question is open. 
2. 
Which graphs have distinct eigenvalues? 
The only known result 
is that the group of such a graph must be boolean, as shown by 
Mowshowitz [4] . 
3. 
Which nonsymmetric strong digraphs 
D are integral? 
Are there 
any? It is well known that 
S(D) 
is the union of the spectra 
of its strong components.

Which multigraphs are integral?

GENERALIZED RAMSEY THEORY FOR GRAPHS - A SURVEY 
Stefan A. Burr 
Bell Laboratories 
Madison, N. J. 
ABSTRACT 
Almost nonexistent a few years ago, the field of generalized Ramsey theory 
for graphs is now being pursued very actively and with remarkable success. 
This 
survey paper will emphasize the following class of problems: 
Given graphs 
G1 , •.• ,Gc, determine or estimate the Ramsey number r(G1 , ••. ,Gc), the smallest 
number p such that if the lines of a complete graph ~ are c-colored in any manner, 
then for some j there exists a subgraph in color j which is isomorphic to Gj. 
Ramsey numbers have now been evaluated completely in a large number of cases, 
particularly when c = 2. 
The most strikingly general result is due to Chvatal: 
If T is a tree on m points, then r(T,~) = mn-m-n+2. 
Also of interest is the 
study of asymptotic questions about r(G1 , •.• ,Gc). 
For instance, Burr, ErdBs, and 
Spencer have shown that if G has m points, none of them isolated, and if i is the 
maximal number of independent points in G, then (2m-i)n-l 2._ r(nG,nG) < (2m-i)n+C, 
where C is a constant depending only on G.

GENERALIZED RAMSEY THEORY FOR GRAPHS - A SURVEY 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
Almost nonexistent a few years ago, the field of generalized Ramsey theory for 
graphs is now being pursued very actively and with remarkable success. 
This work 
has gone in various directions. 
In this survey paper we will discuss results in 
the direction which most resembles that of classical Ramsey theory. 
The following 
definition is an obvious generalization (when c > 2) of that of Chvatal and Harary 
[16]. 
Definition. 
If G1 , ••• ,Gc are graphs, define the Ramsey number r(Gl•···•Gc) to be 
the least number p such that if the lines of the complete graph ~ are colored in 
any fashion by c colors, than for some i the ith colored subgraph contains a Gi. 
Of course, ~ denotes the complete graph on p points; here, and at most other 
places in this paper, the notation of [38] is followed. 
These numbers generalize 
the classical Ramsey numbers for graphs, in which all the Gi are complete graphs. 
In the classical case, only seven non-trivial Ramsey numbers are known, six with 
c = 2 and one with c = 3; see [36,37]. 
As will be seen, very much more is already 
known about generalized Ramsey numbers, in spite of the relative newness of the 
field. 
The term Ramsey number of course comes from Ramsey's theorem [49]. 
That gen-
eralized Ramsey numbers are finite follows immediately from the fact that the 
classical Ramsey numbers are finite. 
Most of the work done in this field has been in the case of two colors. 
In 
this case another definition is useful. 
Definition. 
The diagonal Ramsey numbers are given by 
r(G) = r(G,G) 
Except as noted, all graphs in this paper will always be assumed to have no 
isolated points. 
One consequence of this is that when a graph on n points is men-
tioned (as, say Pn, the path on n points), n > 2 will be assumed automatically. 
In 
addition, cycles Cn carry the automatic assumption n ~ 3. 

54 
The following is the plan of this paper. 
The second section makes some 
observations about the nature of the critical colorings that give the lower bounds 
for Ramsey numbers. 
The third section gives a list of what the author believes to 
be almost all known exact general values of Ramsey numbers. 
The fourth section 
comments on the results of the third and discusses possible directions for further 
work. 
The final section considers some asymtotic questions. 
A list of references 
to other work is also given in that section. 
2. 
CRITICAL COLORINGS 
Let us call a critical coloring for G1 , ••• ,Gc one using c colors on r(Gl•···• 
Gc) - 1 points and not containing a Gi in color i for any i. 
In other words, such 
a coloring sets the lower bound that determines the Ramsey number. 
(Of course, 
critical colorings are not necessarily unique.) 
A striking fact about the evalu-
ations of generalized Ramsey numbers to date is that almost all involve very simple 
critical colorings, in contrast to the situation that appears to pertain in classi-
cal Ramsey theory. 
As usual, the situation for c = 2 is clearest. 
Two classes of critical color-
ing are especially predominant when c = 2, and will therefore be called canonical 
colorings. (See Figure 1.)

Canonical Colorings 

55 
In each case, the graph consists of two monochromatic complete graphs on s 
and t points with all lines between them blue (say). 
In the first case, both 
complete graphs are red; in the second case, one is red and the other blue. 
These 
two cases will be called Types I and II respectively. 
Type II is of somewhat 
secondary importance; in particular, it is rarely necessary when G1 and Gz are both 
connected, as will be seen. 
However, it often comes into its own for graphs which 
are not connected. 
Note, incidentally, that there exist trivial canonical colorings 
in which all lines are the same color; these may be considered to be of either type. 
For any specific graph or class of graphs, it is generally very easy to deter-
mine the best lower bound the canonical colorings can provide, although it would be 
very tedious to state a fully general result. 
However, it is possible to give a 
reasonably economical statement of the situation in which the graphs are connected. 
(The following result also yields some information when only one of the graphs is 
connected.) 
Lemma 1. 
Let G be a connected graph on m points, and let H be a graph on n points. 
Then if H is not bipartite and has point independence number S0 (H) = i, 
(1) 
r(G,H) > 2m - 1 , 
and also 
(2) 
r(G,H) ~ m + n -
i - 1 . 
Otherwise, let H be connected and bipartite, the two parts having k and £ points, 
with k > £. 
Then 
(3) 
r(G,H) > 2 min(m,k) - 1 , 
and also 
(4) 
r(G,H) ~ m + £ - 1 • 
Moreover, if G and H are both connected, these results, together with the fact that 
r(G,H) = r(H,G), yield the best lower bounds that canonical colorings can provide. 
Proof. 
To prove (1), consider a canonical coloring of Type I, with s = t = m- 1. 
It is clear the red graph cannot contain G and the blue graph cannot contain H. To 
prove (2), use a coloring of Type II, with s = m- 1, t = n- i- 1. 
Clearly, 
there is no red G; on the other hand a blue H would have to use at least i + 1 
points out of the Ks, which is impossible. 
Note that this argument applies even 

56 
when H is bipartite; but in this case it will be shown later that relations (3) and 
(4) yield better results. 
Of more significance is the fact that (2) holds even 
when G is not connected. 
To prove (3), use a coloring of Type I with s = t = min(m,k) - 1. 
As before, 
the red graph cannot contain G; the blue graph cannot contain H, since neither of 
the two parts is as large ask. 
To prove (4), first consider a coloring of Type I 
with 
s = m- 1, 
t 
min(m,£) - 1. 
Again, there is no red G; there can be no 
blue H because t < £. 
Thus, 
(5) 
r(G,H) > m + min(m,£) - 1 , 
and (4) is established unless m < £. 
In this case, reverse the roles of G and H 
in (5), yielding r(G,H) = r(H,G) > k + £- 1 > £ + £- 1 > m + £- 1. 
Therefore, 
(4) holds. 
We now show that no better results than these can be obtained using canonical 
colorings, together with r(G,H) = r(H,G). 
Because of the symmetry condition, we 
may assume the colors are assigned as they are in Figure 1. 
First consider color-
ings of Type I. 
It is clear that the formula (1) is best possible, since we must 
have s < m, t < m. 
Consequently, let the conditions pertaining to (3) and (4) be 
satisfied. 
If both s and t are at least £, neither can be as large as k, for other-
wise there will be a blue H; hence, in this case, (3) is the best one can do. 
On 
the other hand, if (say) t< £we must still have 
s < m, 
for otherwise there 
will be a red G. 
Hence in this case (4) is the best one can do. 
It remains to consider colorings of Type II. 
We must certainly have s < m. 
Likewise, we must haven- t > min(m,i). 
If i ~ m, we see immediately that (2) is 
the best we can do. 
If i ~ m, then n -
t > m > s, so s + t < n, leading to a tri-
vial canonical coloring. 
One final step is now necessary, namely to justify the 
earlier assertion that when H is bipartite, (2) although true, does not lead to a 
better result than (3) and (4). 
But we see immediately that i = 80 (H) = k, so 
m + n- i- 1 = m + £- 1, which is the lower bound of (4). 
This completes the 
proof. 

57 
It should be noted that relation (2) will rarely, if ever, be useful, since 
one can usually find some other simple coloring which does better. 
Although they predominate, the canonical colorings do not exhaust the set of 
simple colorings useful in generalized Ramsey theory. 
In particular, the canonical 
colorings can be generalized. 
The simplest such generalization is like a Type I 
cannonical coloring except that there are more than two red complete graphs, all 
of the connecting lines being blue. 
(Note that some of the "red" graphs might 
consist of a single point.) 
The following result, which is Lemma 4 of [19], is based on such a generalized 
canonical coloring. 
It is one of very few general lower bounds that have been 
given, and often yields the exact result. 
Lemma 2. 
Let G and H be graphs (without isolates). 
Let x be the chromatic number 
of G and let n be the number of points in a largest connected component of H. 
Then 
r(G,H) ~ (x-l)(n-1) + 1 . 
The generalized canonical colorings yielding this result has for its red graph 
(x-l)Kn-l' with all other lines blue. 
Note that when x = 3, Lemma 2 leads to 
relation (1) of Lemma 1. 
In the case of more than two colors, generalizations of the canonical color-
ings have also been found useful. 
3. 
EXACT RESULTS 
This section is devoted to a list of known general exact evaluations of 
r(G1 , ••• ,Gc). 
Only a few relatively trivial exact results, mainly the author's, 
have been intentionally omitted. 
The author apologizes for any inadvertent omiss-
ions. 
In order to make this section more useful for purposes of reference, 
comments will be held to a minimum. 
In particular, since in the majority of cases 
the critical colorings are canonical, mention will only be made when they are not. 
Some expanded comments will appear in the next section. 
The results of this 
section are divided into two parts. 
The first part is devoted to results that are 
relatively complete as they stand, the second to partial results. 
Each part breaks 
down naturally into various subparts. 

58 
We mention here, but do not dignify by stating as a theorem, the fact that if 
G has n points, then r(G,K2) = n. 
It is perhaps also worth stating for the record 
the relation between Ramsey numbers for graphs with and without isolated points: Let 
Hi, 1 ~ i ~ c, be formed from Gi by adding some (possibly no) isolates. 
Then 
r(H1 , ••• ,Hc) =max (r(G1 , ••• ,Gc),m), where m is the maximum number of points in 
any of the Hi. 
Theorem 1. 
(Gerencser- Gyarfas [34]): 
If m ~ n, then 
r(Pm,Pn) = m + [%] - 1 
(Recall that Pn is the path on n points, not lines.) 
Theorem 2. 
(Rosta, Faudree- Schelp [SO, 51, 29]): If m ~ n, n odd, and (m,n) 
# (3,3), then 
If m ~ n, m, n even, and (m,n) # (4,4), then 
If m > n, m odd, n even, then 
max(m +%- 1, 2n - 1) • 
Finally, 
All these values are the same as the lower bounds given by Lemma 1, except the two 
special values at the end. 
Rosta's work and that of Faudree and Schelp are inde-
pendent of each other; furthermore, each depends on partial results obtained by 
Chartrand and Schuster [11; see also 10] and Bondy and ErdBs [3]. 
Theorem 3. 
(Faudree-Lawrence-Parsons-Schelp [28]):

Theorem 6. 
(Chvatal- Harary [19]): 
Let G haven points. 
If G has a 1-factor, 
then 
If G does not have a 1-factor, then 
The second half of this result does not come from a canonical coloring. 
The Ramsey numbers for stars are not hard to evaluate for any number of colors, 
and this result will be given later in Theorem 15. 
An important problem that is 
much more difficult is that of unions of stars. 
V. Rosta (personal communication) 
has found the diagonal Ramsey numbers for unions of two stars. 
Theorem 7. (Rosta): 
If m ~ n, then 
max(2m + 1, m + 2n) • 
Theorem 8. 
(Parsons [ 46]): 
n + 1 . 
If n < m < 2n - 1, then 
2n -

If m > 2n - 1, 
For n > m > 3, the following recurrence holds: 

60 
The complexity of this result shows that the critical colorings cannot be canoni-
cal; but they are of the generalized canonical type. 
Theorem 9. 
(Chvatal [14]): 
If Tis a tree on m points, then 
(m-l)(n-1) + 1 • 
A proof of this, different from Chvatal's, will be given in the next section. 
The 
value is determined by the lower bound of Lemma 2. 
This striking result generalizes 
earlier ones by Parsons [48] and Schwenk (given in [39]). 
Chvatal's result has 
itself recently been g~nerali.zed. 
Theorem 10. 
(Stahl [54]): 
Let F be a forest T1 U ... UTk, where each Ti is a 
tree on mi points, and where m1 < ••• ~ mk. 
Then 
The critical colorings pertaining to this result are of generalized canonical type. 
The next four results involve mult~ple copies of graphs, and are all due to 
Burr, Erdtls, and Spencer [7]. 
Only the first requires a non-canonical critical 
coloring, and even that coloring comes from adding a single point to a canonical 
coloring. 
Theorem 11. 
If m ~ n, m ~ 2, then 
The author understands that this result, or part of it, was also discovered by 
Seymour at Oxford. 
Theorem 12. 
If m > n, m ~ 2, then 
r(mK1 , 3, nK1 , 3) 
Theorem 13. 
If G has m points, then 
4m + n -

r(nG,nK2)

Theorem 14. 
Let n > 2. 
Then 
If G f Kmand G has m points, then 
r(nG,nP3)

(m+l)n - 1 . 

61 
The next three results all involve multiple colors. 
Only the last uses 
critical colorings that generalize the canonical colorings. 
Theorem 15.

The second part of this section lists some partial results. 
Theorem 18. 
(Lawrence [43]): 
If m ~ 2n, then 
If m < 2n + 1, m odd, then 
2n + 1 • 
(The case m = 2n, not mentioned in [43], comes from personal communication.) 
The 
remaining cases of r(Cm,Kl,n) are much more difficult and appear to be intimately 
connected to combinatorial configurations. 
Only a few results are known. 
Theorem 19. 
(Parsons [47]): 
If n = q2 + 1, where q is a prime power, then 
Theorem 20. 
(Lawrence - Parsons; see [ 4 7]) : 
If n 
q2, where q is a prime power, 
then 

62 
Dealing with r(Cm,~) is even more difficult, and only the following result is 
known. 
Theorem 21. 
(Bondy- ErdBs [3]): 
If m ~ n2- 2, then 
r(Cm,~) = (m-l)(n-1) + 1 
The lower bound comes about in the same way as that in Theorem 7. 
Theorem 22. 
(Bondy- ErdBs [3]): 
Let Ks;n denote the complete n- partite graph 
Ks, ••• ,s• with n subscripts. 
Then, for s, n fixed and m sufficiently large, 
r(Cm,Ks;n) = (m-l)(n-1) + s 
The critical colorings are of generalized canonical type. 
It is possible to give 
an explicit bound on how big m has to be for the formula to be true. 
Theorem 23. 
If T is a tree on m points, and (m- 1)1 (n- 1), then 
r(T,Kl,n) = m + n- 1 • 
A proof of this based on ideas in Parsons' proof of Theorem 8, will be given in 
the next section. 
The critical colorings are of generalized canonical type. 
E. J. Cockayne has recently extended Theorem 23, also using ideas in Parson's 
proof. 
The full result will not be given, since it is rather technical. 
Theorem 24. 
(Cockayne [23]): 
LetT be a tree on m points which has a point of 
degree one adjacent to a point of degree two. 
Then 
r(T,Kl,n) = m + n -
2 , 
provided that one of the following four conditions holds: 
m _ 0, 2 (mod m-1), 
n i 1 (mod m-1) and n > (m-3)2 , 
n i 1 (mod m-1) and n - 1 (mod m-2) 
or 
n = -1 (mod m-1) and n > m-2. 
The critical colorings are of generalized canonical type. 
The statement of the 
full theorem involves a more complicated condition on T. 
However, almost all 
trees satisfy even the stronger condition of Theorem 24, as can be seen from work 

63 
of Schwenk [53]. 
The next two results, announced by Faudree and and Schelp in [32] and proved 
in [31], involve multiple colors. 
The critical colorings are generalizations of 
canonical colorings. 
Theorem 25. 
If n1 ~ 2(In-)

It should be noted that Faudree and Schelp [30] have solved, and used in the proof 
of Theorem 27, a problem of great interest, although one outside the scope of this 
paper. 
We do not state their result here; but it can be said that they have de-
termined precisely for what Pl• p2 a two-colored complete bipartite graph ~ p2 
1, 
must contain a red Pm or a blue Pn. 
4. 
SOME COMMENTS 
This section discusses some matters involving exact results. 
We begin by 
mentioning the existence of three collections of special values. 
Such values are 
useful for suggesting theorems, finding counterexamples, starting inductions, etc. 
In [19], Chvatal and Harary evaluate r(F,G) for all pairs F, G with no more than 
four points each. 
(In their preceding paper [18] they considered the diagonal 
case only.) 
In [4], Burr evaluates r(G) for all graphs G with no more than six 
lines. 
In [15], Chvatal and Clancy evaluate r(F,G) for most (but not all) pairs 
F, G with F having no more than five points and G having no more than four. 
We now turn to the two proofs promised in the previous section. 
Both proofs 
spring fro~ similar ideas; both theorems also follow easily from results in [6]. 
Proof of Theorem 9. 
That r(T,Ku) ~ (m-l)(n-1) + 1 comes immediately from Lemma 2. 
We now must prove the inequality in the other direction. 
This is trivial when m 
or n is 2; the rest will be proved by induction on m + n. 
Assume the theorem to 

64 
have been proved for all m' + n' < 
m + n and consider any two-colored complete 
graph on (m-l)(n-1) + 1 points. 
LetT' be a tree formed from T by the removal 
of an endpoint. 
By the induction hypothesis there exists either a red T' or a 
blue Ku• so we may assume there is a red T'. 
Remove the m - 1 points of this T', 
leaving a two-colored complete graph on (m-l)(n-2) + 1 points. 
By the induction 
hypothesis, this remaining graph contains either a red T or a blue Ku-l• and we 
may assume the latter. 
Consequently, we have a red T' and a blue ~-l disjoint from it. 
Some point 
of T' has the property that if any line leading from it to the blue Kn-1 is red, 
the original graph contains a red T. 
Hence, all lines from this point to the 
Ku-1 can be assumed to be blue, giving a blue Kn. 
This completes the proof. 
Proof of Theorem 23. 
We first produce a generalized canonical coloring yielding 
r(T,Kl,n) ~ m + n- 1. 
Since (m -
l)l(n :- 1) ,k : 
n-1 
m-1 
is an integer. 
The coloring 
to be considered has for its red graph (k+l)~_ 1 , which has n - 1 + m - 1 
: m + n -
2 points, and contains no T. 
Every point in the complementary (blue) 
graph has degree k(m-1) 
n-1, so there is no blue Kl,n• Thus r(T,K1,n) > m+n-2. 
The proof that m + n -
1 is an upper bound is by induction on m. 
The result 
is trivial for m : 2. 
Now assume the result to have been proved for some m - 1, 
m ~ 3, and consider any two-colored complete graph on m + n - 1 points. 
Let T' 
be a tree formed from T by the removal of an endpoint. 
By the induction hypothesis 
we may assume that the graph contains a red T'. 
Now, that T' contains some point 
with the property that if any line from that point to the n points not in the T' 
is red, the graph contains a red T. 
So we may assume all these lines are blue; 
but this gives a blue Kl,n' completing the proof. 
Note that we have proved that m + n- 1 is an upper bound for r(T,K1 ,n) for 
any m and n. 
It is interesting to consider the proof techniques used in the theorems of 
Section 3. 
It is possible to be fairly systematic about the critical colorings. 
Of the twenty-one theorems involving two colors, ten use canonical colorings 
exclusively (except Theorem 2, which uses non-canonical colorings for two isolated 
cases). 
Of the eleven others, eight use generalized canonical colorings, often 

65 
using Lemma 2. 
Two others (Theorems 6 and 11) use quite simple non-canonical 
colorings. 
Only Theorems 19 and 20 use complicated colorings, involving such 
structures as Moore graphs and block designs. 
Of the five theorems involving 
multiple colors, three use critical colorings that can be said to be of general~ 
ized canonical type. 
The remaining two (Theorems 15 and 16) use rather simple 
colorings involving partitions into regular graphs. 
It should also be noted that 
a substantial majority of the results in the collection [19] comes from either 
canonical colorings or Lemma 2, and that likewise a substantial majority of the 
results in the collection [4] come just from canonical colorings. 
Many of the 
results in the collection [15] also come from canonical colorings. 
It is harder to speak systematically about the techniques used to prove that 
the values in the theorems in Section 3 are upper bounds. 
A few general approaches 
can be identified. 
One is based on the idea that if one has a red (say) path or 
cycle, either that path or cycle can be lengthened or there exist enough blue lines 
to force an appropriate blue path or cycle. 
This idea figures in the proofs of 
Theorems 1, 2 and several others. 
In view of the obvious connection, it is perhaps 
surprising that extremal theory is not used more heavily than it is; but it is used 
fairly frequently. 
See for instance Faudree and Schelp's proof of Theorem 2 and 
Chvatal's proof of Theorem 9, as well as the proofs of Theorems 21 and 22. 
There 
is a fairly coherent principle behind the proofs of Theorems 11 - 14 on multiple 
copies, which is also seen in Theorem 4, namely that if one can find a small graph 
containing both a red G and a blue H, one can apply induction. 
Counting arguments 
are sometimes useful, as in Theorems 15, 19, and 20. 
A final method is that used 
here in the proofs of Theorems 9 and 23, which also has been used in the proofs of 
Theorems 8 and 10. 
There are many attractive directions for future work. 
Each partial result in 
this section suggests such a direction. 
Two such are of particular interest, 
namely to find further values for r(Cm,Kl,n) and r(~,~). Limited progress can 
probably be made but complete solutions seem extremely difficult, especially for 
the second problem. 
(If m = 3, the second problem becomes one in classical Ramsey 
theory.) 

66 
Another potentially valuable direction in which to work would be to try to 
understand why the canonical colorings are so powerful in determining the values 
of Ramsey numbers. 
The insight so gained might lead to the establishment of 
rather general conditions for the Ramsey number of a graph to be determined by a 
canonical coloring. 
A very important problem is the determination, or even accurate estimation, 
of Ramsey numbers for star forests. 
The problem is surprisingly difficult in view 
of the ease of determining Ramsey numbers for stars. 
Theorem 7 solves the problem 
in the diagonal case for unions of two stars, but even that result is not easy to 
prove. 
Very little is known for more than two stars. 
It should certainly be possible to determine r(mG,nH) in more cases than 
Theorems 11 - 14. 
In addition,it seems likely that one could evaluate r(G,Kl,n) 
or r(G,Pn) for general classes of G. 
It would be very interesting, though probably difficult, to evaluate r(T) 
for T a tree. 
Very likely, Lemma 1 determines r(T) when T does not contain a 
large star (in which case the Ramsey number would be the Ramsey number of the 
star). 
Theorem 8 demonstrates that the off-diagonal case must be much more com-
plicated. 
It is likely that there remain interesting and tractable problems involving 
multiple c9lors, beyond the five results in Section 3. 
Finally, it would be valuable to extend the collections of special values in 
[4, 15, 19]. 
5. 
ASYMPTOTIC PROBLEMS 
Although not as much has been done on asymptotic questions on generalized 
Ramsey theory as on exact questions, a few results have been obtained. 
The subject 
is deserving of attention for itself; but furthermore it has in several instances 
illuminated exact problems as well. 
This section considers four types of problem: 
multiple copies, multiple colors, sequences of graphs whose Ramsey numbers grow 
linearly in the number of points, and what might be called extremal Ramsey theory. 

67 
We have already encountered Theorems 11- 14, taken from [7], giving some 
exact results involving multiple copies. 
The same paper considers the correspond-
ing asymptotic questions as well. 
It is possible to obtain a surprisingly sharp 
result. 
Theorem 27. 
Let p(G) 
km + ~n - min(mi,nj) -
1 
< r(mG,nH) 
j. 
Then 
< km + ~n - min(mi,nj) + C , 
where C depends only on G and H. 
Although an explicit bound for C can be given, it is certainly much too 
large. 
It may be possible to give a better one. 
The lower bound in the theorem 
comes from canonical colorings of Type II, and indeed from (2) of Lemma 1, which, 
as noted, applies to arbitrary G and H. 
The ideas of [7] can certainly be applied 
to other cases than those of Section 3 to yield exact results. 
When m = n, it is 
possible to improve Theorem 27, although in a non-constructive way. 
Theorem 28. 
Under the conditions of Theorem 27, there exist n0 and C0 such that, 
whenever n ~ n0 
, 
r(nG,nH) 
(k + ~ - min(i,j)) n + C0 
• 
It has not been possible to evaluate C0 in general, nor even to obtain a 
bound for n 0 • 
Nevertheless,it does not seem altogether beyond hope to do either 
or both. 
Another class of problems on which some progress has been made are those in 
which the number of colors is large. 
Set r(G;c) = r(G, ••. ,G) with c arguments. 
One very general lower bound is of interest here. 
Theorem 29. 
(Chvatal- Harary [17]): 
Let G have p points and q lines, and let 
s be the number of symmetries of G. 
Then 
r(G;c) > (scq-l)l/p . 
The proof is probabilistic, and hence non-constructive; it is of great value 
when q is large relative to p. 

68 
The other results on r(G;c) discussed here apply to fairly special situations, 
in which q is relatively small. 
The next five results are due to Erdos and 
Graham [27]. 
It should be noted that the results are not presented in the same 
form as in that paper; various theorems and remarks have been gathered into the 
five results stated below. 
Theorem 30. 
If T is a tree on n points, then 
n-1 
(c-1) [--2--] < r(T;c) < 2cn + 1 • 
Actually, Erdos and Graham prove a better lower bound than that above, which 
for fixed n is asymptotically equal to en. 
(In fact, the c-coloring they exhibit 
has no monochromatic connected graph on n points.) 
In fact, it seems likely that 
r(T;c)..v en as c + 
The situation for forests is rather more complicated, and is less well under-
stood. 
Theorem 31. 
IfF is forest on n lines (not points), then 
Moreover, if c 2 n2, then 
c(!n- 1) 
2 
< r(F;c) < 4cn • 
r(F;c) > A /CO , 
where A is a positive universal constant. 
Thus for every forest F, r(F;c) displays essentially linear growth in c for 
large c, as is the case with trees throughout the whole range of c. 
However, the 
second formula holds open the possibility that r(F;c) grow as ~for small c. 
The 
next theorem shows that this is indeed the case for the forest mKl,m' as well 
as giving rather sharp upper bound when c is large. 
Theorem 32. 
There is a constant A1 such that, if c 2m, then 
r(mK1 ,m;c) < A1 ~ m2 • 
Also, if c > 3m2, then 
r(mK1 ,m;c) < 3cm • 

69 
Since mKl,m has m2 lines, we see that the upper bounds for this forest come 
within constant factors of their lower bounds, except conceivably for some middle 
range of c. 
The next theorem shows that the phenomenon of having two regimes of 
behavior applies also to even cycles. 
Theorem 33. 
For any c and n, 
r(C2n;c) > (c-l)(n-1) . 
Furthermore, if c ~ 10n/20ln, then 
r(C2n;c) ~ 20lcn . 
Finally, there exists on A > 0 and a positive function B such that for any E > 
0, 
1+1:_ 
· 2n 
Ac 
< r(c2n;c) < B(n,E)c 
l+l+E 
n-1 
The import of this result is that r(c2n;c) grows linearly in c out to a rather 
large value, and then grows roughly like some power > 1 of c. 
Much more is known about r(C4;c), but first we consider the question of odd 
cycles. 
The behavior of odd cycles is very different, and the problem seems much 
less tractable. 
Theorem 34. 
2c • n< r(C2n+l;c) < 2(c+2)! n 
Thus the growth of r(C2n+l;c) is very rapid. 
In [27] it is also shown that 
r(Cm+l;c) < Ac3 nr2 (C3;k) for some A. 
An old question is whether or not 
r(C3;c) < Ac for some A. 
Erd~s has suggested that it might be easier to show 
that r(C2n+l;c) < Ac for some 2n + 1 > 3. 
We now return to the special case c4 of even cycles. 
Rather sharp results 
are known. 
Theorem 35. (Chung [12]): 
r(C4;c) < c2 + c + 1. 
In [12], Chung also considers the classical Ramsey numbers r(C3;c), but this 
is beyond the scope of this survey. 
Theorem 36. 
(Chung 
r(C4;c) > c2 -
c + 2. 
Graham [13]): 
If c-1 is a power of a prime, then 
These two results taken together yield immediately that r(C4;c)rJ c2 as c ~ 00 • 
In fact, this statement can be greatly generalized. 

70 
Theorem 37. 
(Chung- Graham [12]): 
r(K2,n;c) rv(n-l)c as c + ""· 
Chung and Graham also apply their method to estimating r(Kro,n;c) in general. 
Their work is not completed at present, so it is not certain how sharp the esti-
mates will be. 
In order to introduce the next topic we make two definitions. 
We first define 
an 1-set {G1 ,G2, .•. } of graphs to be one for which there is a constant C such that 
for all i. 
We also define the edge-density p(G) of a graph G by 
p(G) = 
max 
q(H) . 
HCGpnrj 
Thus p(G) is approximately the arboricity of G. 
We can now state the following 
conjecture. 
Conjecture. 
(ErdBs): 
Any set of graphs with bounded edge-density is an 1-set. 
This may be stated in alternative form: 
There is a function f such that 
r(G) ~ p(G)f(p(G)). 
This statement seems less appealing than the first. 
Although 
the conjecture is a long way from being settled, some rather suggestive results 
are known. 
Any sequence of trees is an 1-set, as can be seen, for instance, from 
Theorem 30. 
The following two results are due to Burr and ErdBs [6]. 
Theorem 38. 
If {Gi} is an L-set of graphs (with isolates permitted) with bounded 
edge-density, so is the set {Gi + K1}. 
Thus, wheels form an 1-set, for instance. 
It is useful to permit the 
Gi to have isolates in this one case because the set of possible Gi + K1 is thereby 
expanded. 
The ideas used in the proof of Theorem 38 lead directly to the proofs 
in this paper of Theorems 9 and 23, which are exact results. 
Theorem 39. 
For any k, {c~} is an L-set. 
Theorem 38 and 39, together with the trivial fact that F<; G implies r(F) ~r(G), 
enable one to show that a very great many sets of graphs are 1-sets. 
An interesting 
problem would be to characterize those sets that can be treated in this way. 
Lest one be led to think that ErdBs' conjecture tells the whole story, it is 
observed in [6] that ~iKi} is an 1-set (as is very easy to check); but the set 
does not have bounded edge-density. 
In fact, r(4iKi) = (i-1)/2. 
A somewhat 

71 
similar example can be given which is connected. 
Note that there is a constant C such that if Gi = 4iKi, then 
p(Gi) ~Clog p(Gi). 
This is a necessary condition for an 1-set, since Theorem 
29 shows that for any 1-set, p (Gi)/log p(Gi) must be bounded. 
This fact has led 
Erdos to ask whether the set of cubes {Qi} is an 1-set, since this set also 
(barely) satisfies the necessary condition. 
The necessary condition is certainly 
not sufficient, since Lemma 2 shows that the set ~iKi + K~ is not an 1-set. 
Another topic of interest, closely related to the previous one, is the 
following question: 
For the set of graphs S satisfying some property, what is 
the minimum of r(G) for G E: S? 
One can, of course, also ask for maxima, and ask 
questions about off-diagonal numbers. 
It seems natural to call this topic extremal 
Ramsey theory, even at the risk of clouding the issue of the connection between 
extremal theory and Ramsey theory. 
One such question, posed by Erdos, is: 
Of 
all graphs with chromatic number x, does Kx have the smallest Ramsey number? 
One 
might mean "smallest" X in the weak or strong sense. 
A test case currently being 
considered is whether or not the 5-spoked wheel G5 + K1 has a Ramsey number greater 
18. 
Chvatal and Schwenk [20] have 
shown that 17 ~ r(c5 + K1) < 21. 
In [5], Burr and Erdos consider several extremal questions, and in particular 
give the next three results. 
Theorem 40. 
If G is connected, not bipartite, and has n points, then 
r(G) .:::_ 2n -
1 
Also, if n .:::_ 4, there is such a G for which r(G) 
2n - 1. 
This exact result is out of place in this section; however, the two other 
extremal Ramsey results given here are asymptotic in character, so Theorem 40 is 
included here. 
The extremal graphs consist of either odd cycles, or odd cycles 
to which one point and one line have been added. 
Theorem 41. 
If G is connected and has n points, then 
r (G) .:::_ 2 [2n;2J - 1. 
Also, there is such a G for which r (G) < !!. n + 4. 
-3 

72 
The upper bound can be improved, but it has not been possible to close the 
gap altogether. 
It is conjectured that the lower bound is sharp. 
The upper bound 
comes from graphs consisting of a path of length roughly 2n/3, connected to a 
star of order roughly n/3. 
Theorem 42. 
There exists a C0 such that if G has n points (and no isolates), then 
r(G) > n + log2n - C0 log log n 
Also, there is such a G and a c1 for which r(G) ~ n + C1 ~ . 
Here the gap is even larger. It is conjectured that the lower bound tells 
essentially the true story. 
It is clear that it is only necessary to consider G 
that are star forests. 
The upper bound is given essentially by graphs of the 
form mKl,m' The lower bound is given roughly by 
Kl,[n/2] UKl,[n/4] UKl,(n/8] u ... UKl,l 
In [5] consideration is also given to off-diagonal versions of extremal 
Ramsey theory. 
As one simple example, note that Lemma 2, taken together with 
Theorem 9, constitutes such an extremal result. 
This paper has considered the evaluation and estimation of the numbers 
r(G1 , ••• ,Gc). 
However, there are many other questions which generalize classical 
Ramsey theory for graphs; these questions have been studied in numerous papers, 
some of them already mentioned. 
As a partial listing of such papers, see [1, 2, 
7' 16, 17' 21, 22, 26, 30, 33, 34, 35, 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 47' 55].

SOME RECENT RESULTS IN TOPOLOGICAL GRAPH THEORY 
Paul C. Kainen 
Case Western Reserve University 
ABSTRACT 
This paper examines a number of recent results in topological graph theory. 
Invariants such as genus, thickness, skewness, crossing number, and local crossing 
number are introduced and related to one another. 
We then deal with topological 
techniques in the theory of chromatic numbers, and state a very ambitious meta-
conjecture which is quite useful in generating true theorems. 
In closing, we 
attempt to suggest appropriate directions for further research in topological 
graph theory, and we give a few results to indicate the richness of the terrain.

AN INTRODUCTION TO TOPOLOGICAL GRAPH THEORY 
INTRODUCTION 
I shall try in this paper to collect some of the basic concepts and results 
of topological graph theory. 
Obviously, this is a somewhat subjective matter, and 
I make no claims for the completeness of this survey. 
Rather, I have tried to con-
centrate on several key results- notably, Euler's Formula and Heawood's Theorem 
on surfaces other than the plane - which may serve to give a feeling for the sub-
ject. 
Emphasis is placed on ideas and techniques which are not yet readily access-
ible in the literature. 
For example, we omit any mention of the theorems of 
Kuratowski, Whitney and MacLane which characterize planarity. 
On the other hand, 
we outline in some detail the techniques of piecewise - linear embeddings, and 
discus~ the results of Youngs on 2-cell embeddings. 
It is assumed that the reader has some knowledge of graph theory (for unde-
fined terms, see Harary's book [33)) and also of elementary pointset topology 
although this latter stipulation may be removed provided that one is willing to 
take certain assertions in Section 1 on faith. 
Our primary goals are to provide 
information on and to stimulate interest in topological graph theory. 
The outline of the paper is as follows. 
In Section 1, we describe the various 
orientable and non-orientable surfaces and introduce the idea of embedding a graph 
in a surface. 
We discuss proper, or 2-cell, embeddings and the work of Youngs. 
An elementary but complete proof of Euler's Formula for the plane is given and a 
necessary condition for proper embeddability is derived. 
We also show how to 
realize a graph in 3-space, R3, and define maximal graphs and triangulations in 
a surface. 
Section 2 contains the definitions of genus, maximum genus, and upper embedd-
ability and gives results on genus and upper embeddability for complete graphs and 
other important classes. 
We prove Ringel's result that genus is not increased by 
contracting a connected subgraph, and we give a detailed treatment of piecewise -

78 
linear embeddings. 
In Section 3, a topological proof of the 5 color theorem for planar graphs is 
generalized to yield some new results. 
We also show how to obtain several disparate 
coloring results from a tantalizing-but-false improvement on the Szekeres-Wilf 
bound on chromatic numbers. 
In Section 4, we define the chromatic number X(S) and Heawood number H(S) of 
a surface S and give a simple proof that 
X(S) ~ H(S) for S # s0 , the sphere. 
As 
a consequence of our method, we are able to prove part of a result of Dirac that, 
for certain surfaces S, if G can be embedded inS and X(G) = X(S), then G contains 
KH(S) as a subgraph. 
Section 5 includes a discussion of thickness and results for the standard 
families and, in addition, it explores the chromatic numbers of graphs with 
specified thickness. 
Some variants of thickness, such as book thickness and point-
arboricity, are also dealt with. 
Section 6 deals with pinched manifolds, or pseudomanifolds, which are obtained 
from surfaces by introducing certain 0-dimensional singularities. Coloring problems 
involving thickness, as well as the celebrated empire coloring problem, can be cast 
in this setting. 
Further, these results are seen to suggest that the "obstruction" 
to a geometric coloring problem is always a complete graph. 
Finally, in Section 7, we treat crossing numbers and some other topological 
invariants and obtain some elementary relations among them. 
1. 
EULER 1 S FORMULA 
A closed (open) surface S is a compact (non-compact) topological space in 
which every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the Euclidean plane. 
Thus, 
S is just a 2-dimensional closed (open) manifold. 
We also call a closed surface 
a surface. 
If S is a closed surface, then, by the classification of 2-manifolds 
(see Cairns [15, pp. 15-38]), S consists of a sphere to which handles or crosscaps 
are attached, where a handle is simply a cylinder minus its ends and a crosscap 
is a Mtlbius band which we imagine to be deformed so that its bounding circle is 
untwisted. 
The deformation must take place in 4-dimensions since a crosscap 

79 
cannot be realized in 3-dimensional space without self-intersections. 
(See Figure 
1) 
To attach a handle to a sphere or any other surface S, remove the interiors of 
two disjoint closed discs and identify the two bounding circles of a handle with 
the boundaries of the closed discs. 
To attach a crosscap, remove the interior of 
one closed disc and identify the bounding circle of the crosscap with the boundary 
of the closed circle. 
(See Figure 2) 
The result of attaching a handle to the 
sphere is called the torus; we denote by Sk the result of attaching k handles 
(k ~ 0) to the sphere. 
Attaching a crosscap to the sphere yields the projective 
plane while attaching two crosscaps yields the Klein bottle. 
With any closed surface S '·le may aEOsociate an integer e(S) < 2, called the 
Euler characteristic of S, which is given by the formula 
Sphere with Handle 
(a torus) 
e(Sk) 
e(Sk) 
e(Uk) 
2 - 2k, 
2 - 2k, 
3 -
2k.

Cross-cap 
Sphere with Cross-cap 
(a projective plane) 

80 
where Sk is obtained from Sk-l by attaching two crosscaps and Uk is obtained from 
Sk-l by attaching one crosscap. 
(So Si is the Klein bottle and U1 is the projective 
plane.) 
It can be shown [15] that every surfaceS can be written uniquely in the 
form Sk, Sk, or Uk, for some k, and so e(S) is well-defined. 
One can also use the 
homology groups of S to define e(S). 
Let G be a graph. 
We do not allow loops or multiple edges, and we require 
a finite number of vertices. 
V(G) and E(G) denote, respectively,the sets of ver-
tices and edges. 
If lsi is the cardinality of a set S, a graph G is said to have 
order n if IV(G) I = n. 
Any graph G can be realized as a collection of points and straight-line seg-
ments in )-dimensional euclidean space - that is, we can find a set P of points 
and L of non-intersecting open straight-line segments such that the endpoints of 
any element t in L belong to P and there are 1-1 correspondences between V(G) and 
P and between E(G) and L such that p and q are the endpoints of t if and only if 
v and w are the vertices joined by e, where p corresponds to v, q to w, and t to e. 
To obtain the realization, choose a set P of points in 3-space such that P and 
V(G) are in 1-1 correspondence and such that P is in general position. 
This means 
that no 3 points lie on the same line and no 4 points on the same plane. 
Note that 
a singleton is in general position and, having a set S with n-1 points in general 
position, one can choose a new point x in 3-space but not in any line or plane de-
termined by points in S. 
Thus, S l) {x} is a set of n points in general position. 
If v and w are joined by an edge e, let e correspond to the open straight-line 
segment t between the points of P corresponding to v and w. 
Let L be the set of 
all such open segments. 
Two elements of L intersect if and only if their endpoints 
violate the hypotheses of general position. 
Similarly, no element of P belongs to 
an element of L. 
This topological realization I G I = P U U t of a graph G in 3-space has a 
~ e: L 
well-defined topology as a subspace of R3. 
We shall often write G instead of IGI. 
Two graphs G and H are called homeomorphic, denoted G ~ H , if they have a common 
subdivison - i.e., they are isomorphic "up to vertices of degree 2". 
Clearly, 
G~H if and only if IGI and IHI are homeomorphic as topological spaces. 
Also, 

81 
G is connected if and only if IGI is connected. 
Suppose G is a graph and S is a surface. 
By an embedding f: G + S of G in S 
we shall mean a topological embedding f (homeomorphism into) of lei in S. 
If 
f: G +Sis an embedding, then the image off, f(IGI), is homeomorphic to IGI. 
Thus, the image of f is just a topological realization of G in S consisting of a 
set P' of points in S and a set L' of open Jordan arcs (simple curves) in S sat-
isfying the analogous restrictions to those on P and L. 
We shall often write G 
for the image of f. 
When the particular embedding does not matter, we write G ~S 
to mean according to context, that G is (or can be) embedded in S. 
Note that every 
graph G can certainly be embedded in Sm, where m = IE(G) I. 
G is called planar if 
G ~R 2 . 
Any embedding of G in R2 yields an embedding of G in s0 and vice versa. 
Thus, G is planar if and only if G ~ s0 . 
If f: G + S is an embedding, then G (that is, its image under the embedding) 
is a compact, hence closed, subspace of S. 
Therefore, S-G is open. 
Since S is 
locally connected, the connected components of S-G are open. 
They are called the 
regions of the embedding f. 
Each region is an open surface. 
If the regions are 
all open 2-cells (that is, homeomorphic to the euclidean plane), then f is called 
a proper or 2-cell embedding. 
We write G < S to mean that G is, or, by the usual 
abus du language, can be, properly embedded in S. 
Note that if G is connected, 
then G C s0 if and only if G < s0 . 
Suppose f: G + S is a proper embedding. 
How many regions does f have? 
Euler's 
famous formula, which we are about to state, shows that this number is finite and 
that it is completely determined by G and does not depend on f. 
Call a graph G an 
(n,m) graph and write G(n,m) if G is connected, has n vertices, and m edges. 
Theorem 1.1. 
If G(n,m) and f: G + S is a proper embedding, then 
n - m + r = e(S) , 
where r is the number of regions. 
Proof. 
We shall give the proof when S = s0 , the sphere. 
A more general proof can 
be obtained by using the homological characterization of e(S)- (see Spanier [75, p. 
173]). 
We induct on m. 
If m = 0, G consists of a point son= 1, m = 0, r = 1 

gz 
and the theorem holds. 
Suppose it holds for graphs with m-1 edges. 
Let G(m,n) 
be arbitrary (m ~ 1) and f: G + S a proper embedding. 
Call an edge of G a bridge 
(or isthmus) if its removal results in a disconnected graph. 
Clearly, e is a 
bridge if and only if e lies on no cycle of G. 
Hence, if every edge of G is a 
bridge, G is a tree. 
But then r = 1 (since G has no cycles) and m = n - 1 because 
G is a tree. 
Thus, n - m + r = n -
(n-1) + 1 
2 = e(s0) so the result holds. 
Hence, we may assume that G has an edge e which is not a bridge. 
Let G' = G -
e 
and let f': G' + s0 denote the restriction off toG'. 
Then G'(n,m-1) and f' is 
a proper embedding with r-1 regions since e must lie on the boundary of 2 regions -
otherwise it would be a bridge. 
Thus, by the inductive hypotheses, n -
(m-1) + 
(r-1) = 2. 
But n - m + r 
n- (m-1) + (r-1). 
Suppose G(n,m) and G < S. 
We can use Euler's Formula to derive an ·inequality 
relating n, m, and e(S) which generalizes the well-known relation m < 3n - 6 for 
planar graphs. 
Corollary 1.2. 
If G(n,m) and G < S, then m ~ 3(n-e(S)). 
Proof. 
Let s(R) denote the number of sides (i.e., edges) in the boundary of a 
region R with bridges counting twice. 
Then 2m = ER s(R) ~ 3r since every region 
must have at least 3 sides. 
Thus, r ~lm so e(S) = n- m + r < n- m + ~ = n 
m 
3 
3 
3. 
If G(n,m) and f: G + S is an embedding such that every region has 3 sides or, 
equivalently, if m = 3(n-e(S)), then f (or G) is called a triangulation of S, or 
S-triangulation. 
Note that f must be a proper embedding. 
Clearly, any S-triangu-
lation G is S-maximal in the sense that if any new edge x is added to G, the aug-
mented graph G + x cannot be properly embedded in S. 
The converse of this statement, however, is false for surfaces other than 
s0 or R2. 
It is true in the plane- for if G is RZ-maximal (called maximal planar) 
and G < s0, then no region with 4 sides or more can have all of its diagonals. 
Thus, one of the diagonals could be added within the region without violating 
planarity. 
Since G is maximal planar, this cannot happen so G is a triangulation. 
This argument does not work even for the torus since then a k-sided region 
(k ~ 4) could have all of its diagonals outside of the region. 
In fact, the im-
plication is false. 
For if Kg - c5 denotes the complete graph Kg on 8 vertices 

83 
minus the edges of a 5-cycle c5, then K8 - c5 is s1-maximal,but Kg- c5 has only 
28- 5 = 23 edges,which is strictly less than the 3(8-0) = 24 edges required by 
an s1-triangulation (see Harary, Kainen, Schwenk, and White [36] and also Duke 
and Haggard [24]). 
This suggests the following interesting problem: 
Question 1.3. 
By how many edges can an S-maximal graph fail to be a triangulation? 
In the sequel, it will be convenient to have an extension of Corollary 1.2. 
Certainly, the restriction of connectedness (implicit in the hypothesis G(n,m)) 
could be removed since we can make G connected by adding extra edges joining its 
components. 
However, the augmented graph might not be properly embedded in S. 
Moreover, G < S does not imply that every subgraph of G is properly embedded. 
The next result, which resolves these difficulties, is due to Youngs [82]. 
Basically, it says that if G C:s, then any non-simply-connected region can be 
altered by removing handles or crosscaps to produce a simpler surface S' in which 
G is properly embedded. 
The idea goes back at least to KBnig [52, p. 198] and 
certainly seems geometrically evident. 
However, Youngs realized that the proof was 
somewhat more delicate than had been previously noted. 
Let us say an embedding G C: S is simplest if, given any other embedding 
G C:s', e(S) ~ e(S'). 
An embedding is maximal if no other embedding has more re-
gions. 
Youngs proved the following result constructively [82, p. 309]. 
Theorem 1.4. 
If G C:s is an embedding which is not proper, then the surfaceS can 
be modified to produce a surfaceS* and an embedding G C:S*, where e(S*) > e(S). 
Corollary 1.5. 
If G C S is simplest, then G < S. 
Using this result, Youngs was able to give the following characterization 
theorem: 
Theorem 1.6. 
G C:s is simplest if and only if it is a maximal proper embedding. 
Proof. 
Suppose G < S is simplest and G < S' is a maximal proper embedding. 
Then 
by Euler's Formula 
n 
m + r 
n -
m + r' 
e(S), 
and 
e (S'), 

84 
where r and r' denote, respectively, the number of regions in the embeddings 
G < S and G < S'. 
Since G < S is simplest and G < S' is maximal, we have 
0 ~ e(S) - e(S') = r- r' < 0 
so e(S) = e(S') and r = r'. 
Theorem 1.4 enables us to find a strengthened version of Corollary 1.2. 
Theorem 1.7. 
Let G be any graph with n vertices and m edges and suppose G C: S. 
Then m ~ 3(n-e(S)). 
Proof. 
Obtain a connected graph G and embedding G C:S from G C: S by adding new 
edges joining the components of G. 
If G is already connected, no new edges are 
added. 
Then G(n,m), where m ~ m. 
By Theorem 1.4, we can find a proper embedding 
G < S*, where e(S*) ~ e(S). 
Hence m 
~ 3(n-e(S*)). 
But m < m and 3(n-e(S*)) < 
3(n-e(S)) 
so we are done. 
2. 
GENUS 
We define the genus y(G) of a graph G to be the smallest integer k such that 
G < Sk. 
Note that the existence of some integer k such that G < Sk follows from 
Corollary 1.5. 
If G(n,m) and G < Sk, then by Corollary 1.2, m ~ e(n-3(Sk)) 
3n -
6 + 6k so k > m-3n+6 
6 
Thus 
Proposition 2.1. 
m-3n+6 
y(G) ~ { ---6--- }, where {x} denotes the least integer greater 
than or equal to x. 
For example, if G 
m-3n+6 
(n-3)(n-4) 
-6-- = 
12 
= Kn, the complete graph on 
H 
(K ) 
{ (n-3) (n-4) 
ence, y 
n 
~ 
12 
n vertices, then m = n(n-l) so 
2 
}, and a famous result of Ringel 
and Youngs [70] asserts that equality does hold. 
Their proof gives an embedding, 
for each n, of~ in Sk, where k = { (n-))(n-4) }. Their elaborate combinatorial 
12 
techniques depend on the residue class of n modulo 12. 
Since there are trivalent graphs of arbitrarily high genus the inequality of 
Proposition 2.1 cannot, in general, be an equality. 
The genus of other classes of graphs is known. 
For example, {y(~,q)} = 
(p-2);q-2) } (Ringel [67])and y(Q(d)) 
1 + (d-4)2d-3 (Ringel [68] and Beineke 
and Harary [8]), where Kp,q denotes the complete bipartite graph and Q(d) denotes 
the d-dimensional cube which consists of the points and lines of a d-dimensional 

85 
hypercube. 
Since ~.q and Q(d) are bipartite graphs, Proposition 2.1 can be 
sharpened for them to read y(G) > {m-2n+4} • What remains is to show these embed-
4 
dings are possible. 
Another result we should mention here (due to Battle, Harary, Kodama, and 
Youngs [2]) is that y(G) = Eiy(Bi), where the Bi are the blocks of G. 
In particu-
lar, then, the genus of a graph is the sum of the genera of its components. 
If G is a graph, there is certainly no largest integer k for which G C:sk 
since if G < SY(G)' we can add an arbitrary number of handles to any region. 
On 
the other hand, there is a largest integer k for which G < Sk; call k the maximum 
genus, 
YM(G), of G. 
For example, if G is a tree or a unicyclic graph (connected 
with only one cycle), then it is easy to see that 
yM(G) = 0. 
Let G(n,m) be arbitrary and suppose G < Sk. 
By Euler's Formula, n - m + r 
2 -
2k so k = m-n;2-r • 
To make k as large as possible, we make r as small as 
possible. 
Now k is an integer and r > 1. 
1 
Hence, k ~ [Z(m-n+l)], where [x] is the 
greatest integer< x. 
Since S(G), the cyclomatic number of G, which is just the 
dimension of the cycle space of G, is given by the formula S(G) = m-n+l, we obtain 
a result of Nordhaus, Stewart, and White [61]. 
Proposition 2.2. 
yM(G) ~ [S~G)] 
Call G upper embeddable if 
yM(G) = [S~G)]. It was shown in [61] that com-
plete graphs are upper embeddable. 
Ringeisen [63] has shown that complete bi-
partite and maximal planar graphs are also upper embeddable. 
This latter result, 
of course, has the consequence that a planar graph may have arbitrarily large 
maximum genus. 
See also Nordhaus [60]. 
Consider the graph G = CrV Cs obtained from two cycles Cr and Cs by identify-
ing a vertex in Cr with a vertex in Cs. 
Since S(G) = 2, yM(G) ~ 1. 
We claim that 
G < s1 so that G is upper embeddable. 
For a torus can be obtained from a square 
by identifying opposite pairs of sides (see Figure 3). 
Under the identification, 
the perimeter of the square becomes two simple closed curves which intersect at a 
single point x. 
Hence, we can realize Cr in s1 using one of these simple closed 
curves and Cs in s1 using the other simple closed curve so that the point x cor-
responds to the vertex which Cr and Cs have in common. 
The complement of G in 

86 
s1 , s1 - G, consists of a single open 2-cell since s1 - G can also be obtained by 
first removing the perimeter of the square and then performing the identifications 
which do not affect the interior of the square and leave it as an open 2-cell. 
This suggests a somewhat more geometric way to interpret Proposition 2.2 -
namely, that at least 2 cycles are required to "kill off" each handle of Sk in an 
embedding of G in Sk in order that the embedding should be proper. 
Genus has the very pleasant property that it is not increased by edge con-
traction. 
For if G < Sk and e is an edge of G, then we may find a very small closed 
disc D in Sk intersecting G only in e and its endpoints. 
(See Figure 4) 
Now we 
may shrink D without topologically altering Sk and this has the effect of collaps-
ing e to a point. 
More generally, Ringel has observed: 
Theorem 2.3. 
If His a connected subgraph of G, 
th~n y(G/H) < y(G), where G/H is 
obtained from G by collapsing H to a point. 
This follows from our remark about edge contraction since H can be collapsed 
stepwise by contracting one edge at a time in a spanning tree. 
In general, there is no reason why an embedding of a graph in a manifold 
should be at all "nice," even locally. 
For example, some edge could be embedded 
as a "topologists' sine curve". 
In particular, we cannot assume that every vertex 
v of a graph G < S has a small neighborhood in which the edges of G incident with 
v radiate outward from v like the spokes of a wheel, although we really need some 
such property to validate our earlier assumption of the existence of a suitably 
small disc D containing every edge e. 
....

Figure 4 
These problems, and others, can be handled by introducing the idea of piece-
wise-linear (or PL) embeddings. 
Let S be an surface. 
Then S is obtained from 
the sphere by attaching handles and crosscaps. 
It is easy to see that, if only 
handles are attached, they can be deformed so as not to intersect one another and 
so S can be embedded in R3. 
On the other hand, if crosscaps are attached as well, 
Scan be embedded in R4 . 
Thus, any closed surface can be embedded in a euclidean 
space of dimension not exceeding 4. 
We can alter any such embedding (by arbitra-
rily little) to produce a faceted embedding - that is, we "bend" the surface so 
that it is divided into "flat" triangles, or ·facets meeting each other along 
common edges and at common corners (see Figure 5). 
Given a faceted embedding of 
S, we can form a 2-dimensional simplicial complex K (this is just the 2-dimensional 
analogue of a graph) whose a-simplices are the corners, !-simplices the edges, and 
2-simplices the facets. 
Moreover K is linearly embedded in euclidean space and 
topologically K is just S. 
We shall denote a faceted embedding by its correspond-
ing complex K. 
If f: G + S is an embedding and K is any faceted embedding of S, 
then f can be regarded as an embedding of G in K. 
Let K and K' be faceted embeddings of S. 
We call K' a subdivision of Kif, 
for i = 0,1,2, each i-simplex a' of K' is contained in some 2-simplex a of K (see 
Figure 6). 
If K is any 2-dimensional simplicial complex, its 0- and !-simplices 
determine a graph G(K) called the !-skeleton of K. Finally, let us choose for each 
surface S a standard faceted embedding K5• 

88 
Now suppose f: G + K is an embedding, where K is a 2-dimensional complex. 
Call f simplicial if f(G) is a subgraph of G(K). 
Iff: G +Sis an embedding, we 
say that f is piecewise-linear (PL) if there are subdivisions G' of G and K' of K5 
such that the corresponding embedding f': G' + K' is simplicial. 
For a much more 
detailed treatment of simplicial complexes and PL embeddings, see for example 
Zeeman [84] or Hudson [41]. 
The following theorem, which we state but do not prove for graphs in surfaces, 
is true in a much more general setting (Spanier [75, p. 128]). 
Theorem 2.4. Let f: G + S be an embedding. 
Then there is an embedding f': G + S 
which is PL. 
In fact, f' can be chosen arbitrarily close to f, so if f is a proper embedd-
ing, f' can be taken to be proper also.

CHROMATIC NUMBERS OF GRAPHS 
If G is any (n,m) graph, then the average degree d of G is by definition 
2m 
n 
Hence, from Corollary 1.2, if G is planar, 
d 
Thus, G must contain a vertex of degree ~ 5. 
This helps to suggest the following definition: 
The Szekeres-Wilf number 
sw(G) of a graph G is given by 
sw(G) 
max 
o(H) , 
H!:G 
where H is any subgraph of G and o(H) is the minimum degree of H. 
Of course, it 
suffices to take the maximum over all induced subgraphs H. 
Let X(G) denote the 
chromatic number of G (minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of 
G so that adjacent vertices have different colors). 
Szekeres and Wilf have proved 
[76]: 
Theorem 3.1. 
X(G) = 1 + sw(G). 
The proof is an easy argument by induction on the number of vertices in G. 
Alternatively, we can derive it as an immediate consequence of the next result. 
Call G r-critical if X(G) = r but X(G-v) = r-1 for any vertex v E V(G). 
Note that 
if X(G) = r, then G contains an r-critical subgraph. 
For more on r-critical graphs, 
see e.g., Dirac [20] and [21]. 
Theorem 3.2. 
If G is r-critical, then o(G) ~ r-1. 
Proof. 
Suppose G has a vertex v of degree~ r-2. 
Color G-v with r-1 colors. 
Then 
v is adjacent to at most r-2 different colors so v can be colored with one of the 
remaining colors. 
This is an r-1 coloring of G , which is impossible. 
Our initial remarks about planar graphs show that if G is planar, sw(G) < 5. 
Hence, by 3.1, we have 
Corollary 3.3. 
If G is planar, X(G) < 6. 

90 
This result can be improved upon in several directions. 
Let us define the 
skewness 
~(G) of a graph G to be the minimum number of edges whose removal makes 
G planar. 
Obviously, removing all the edges would suffice, so skewness is well-
defined. 
Lemma 3.4. 
If ~(G) 2 5, then sw(G) 2 5. 
Proof. 
Let G' be the planar graph obtained from G by removing an appropriate set 
of ~(G) edges. 
Then if G has n vertices and m edges, G' has n vertices and 
m-
~(G) edges,so m-
~(G) 2 3n- 6, or m 2 3n- 6 +~(G) < 3n. 
Hence, if d 
denotes the average degree, d = Zm 
< 6. 
Thus, there must be some vertex of 
n 
degree 2 5. 
Observing that 
~(H) 2 ~(G) whenever H C G completes the proof. 
The following result is now immediate. 
Theorem 3.5. 
If ~(G) 2 5, then X(G) < 6. 
We can strengthen Corollary 3.3 by reducing 6 to 5. 
This is the famous 5 Color 
Theorem of Heawood [37]. 
Heawood originally proved it using a "coloring chain" 
argument with which Kempe had attempted (unsuccessfully) to prove the 4 Color Con-
jecture (4CC)- see Saaty [72]. 
We sketch here a somewhat different proof. 
Theorem 3.6. 
If G is planar, then X(G) 2 5. 
Proof. 
Suppose G is planar and 6-minimal and suppose G is an (n,m) graph. 
(Thus 
X(G) = 6 but X(H) < 6 if \V(H) \ < n. 
Minimal implies critical and any critical 
graph must be connected so there is no loss of generality in assuming G is an (n,m) 
graph.) 
By 3.2, o(G) = 5. 
Let v be a vertex of degree 5 which is adjacent to 
v1 , ••• ,v5 and let e1 , •.. ,e5 denote the corresponding edges. 
If every pair 
vi,vj (1 2 i 2 j 2 5) is adjacent, G would contain K6 as a subgraph. 
Since K6 is 
not planar, some pair, say v1 and v2, are not adjacent. 
Delete e3, e4 , and e5 from 
G and contract e1 and e2 to produce a new graph G. By Theorem 2.3, G is planar and 
hence, since G is minimal, G can be 5-colored. 
This induces a 5-coloring of G-v 
in which vl and v2 receive the same color which, in turn, induces a 5-coloring of 
G. 
Note that we did not use the non-planarity of K5 , only of K6 , in this proof, 
which optimists among you may take as propaganda for the 4CC. 
We also needed 
sw(G) < 5 for G planar and that G, constructed from G by deleting and contracting 

91 
edges, is planar. 
Suppose we replace "G planar" with "ll(G) .::._ 2". Then the first two remarks 
still- hold but the third one does not. 
The problem is that the edges to be de-
leted from G may have been contracted to form G and now constitute a vertex which 
is not removable. 
One can nevertheless get around this difficulty by showing that 
G has at least 8 vertices of degree 5 (see Kainen [42]) and we obtain: 
Theorem 3.7. 
If ]l(G) .::._ 2, then X(G) < 5. 
The theorem implies a result of Hedetneimi that there is no uniquely 5-color-
able planar graph. 
(See Chartrand and Geller [16].) 
In fact, there is no semi-
uniquely 5-colorable planar graph (that is, if G is planar, and v and w £ V(G) with 
v f w, then there is a 5-coloring of G assigning different colors to v and w.) See 
Greenwell [28]. 
Clearly, sw(G) < 
~(G), the maximum degree of G, so X(G) .::._ 1 +~(G). The 
following well-known result due to Brooks [13] improves this inequality by 1 for 
most graphs. 
Theorem 3.8. 
Let G be connected. 
Then X(G) 
.::._~(G) unless G is complete or an odd 
cycle. 
It is a pity that an analogous improvement over the Szekeres-Wilf bound, 
namely X(G) .::._ sw(G) if G is not complete or an odd cycle, is impossible. 
For if 
G = Ck + Kt denotes the join of an odd cycle Ck ~nd Kt, then sw(G) = 2 + t while 
X(G) = X(Ck) + X(Kt) = 3 + t. 
The following well-known and elegant theorem is due to Grtltzsch [29]. 
Theorem 3.9. 
Any planar graph with no 3-cycles can be 3-colored. 
We should also include here two results of Ringel [65]. 
Suppose that a 
graphGcan be drawn in the plane so that no edge crosses more than one other edge. 
Call such a graph G nearly planar. 
Theorem 3.10. 
If G is nearly planar, then X(G) < 7. 
If G is planar with dual graph G*, let H denote the graph whose vertices are 
those of G and G* and which includes all edges of G and G* together with edges 
joining each vertex v* in G* to each vertex v in the boundary of v*. 

92 
Theorem 3.11. 
If G is cubic (regular of degree 3), X(H) ~ 6. 
The results of Kronk [53] and of Kronk and White [54] are similar in flavor 
to these theorems. 
4. 
CHROMATIC NUMBERS OF SURFACES 
Let S be a surface. 
We define the chromatic number X(S) of S to be the maxi-
mum of X(G) for G C:s. 
In the same way, we define the Szekeres-Wilf number of S, 
sw(S) =max {sw(G)!G C:s}. Plainly, X(S) ~ 1 + sw(S) and so any bound on sw(S) 
yields a bound on X(S). 
In order to find a bound on sw(S), we shall find a bound on d = d(G), the 
average degree of G, for any graph G Cs. 
The following lemma is an easy conse-
quence of Theorem 1.7. 
Lemma 4.1. 
Suppose G(n,m) and G C:s. 
Then d < 6 - 6e(S) .

Set H(S) = [a(S)]. 
This is called the Heawood number of the surfaceS because of 
the following theorem which is due to Heawood [37]. 
Theorem 4.2. 
LetS be a surface other than the sphere. 
Then X(S) ~ H(S). 
If S is the sphere, H(S) = 4, and we are dealing with the 4CC. 
Proof. 
It suffices, by Theorem 3.1, to prove that sw(G) ~ H(S) - 1 whenever G C:S. 
When S 
U1, the projective plane, then it follows from Lemma 4.1 that d(G) < G 
whenever G C:u1 and hence sw(G) ~ 5 = H(Ur) - 1. 
For S # U1, we are able to prove 
a slightly stronger result, which finishes the proof of this theorem. 
Theorem 4.3. 
Let S be a surface other than the sphere or projective plane and let 
G C S. 
Then d(G) < a(S) - 1. 
Proof. 
If e (S) 
0 (i.e., Sis the torus of Klein bottle), then a(S) = 7 and, by 
Lemma 4.1, d(G) < 6 = 7 - 1. 
Thus, we can as&ume e(S) < 0. 
Let G C: S be any graph 

93 
of order n. 
If n ~ a(S), then 
d < 6 -
6e(S) 
< 6 - 6e(S) = a(S) - 1 • 
n 
a(S) 
On the other hand, if n < a(S), then d < n- 1 < a(S) - 1. 
Remark 4.4. 
If S is the projective plane, X(S) ~ H(S) = 6. 
Proof. By Lemma 4.1, if G C:s, d < 6 so sw(G) < 5. 
Therefore, sw(S) < 5 and hence 
X(S) < 6. 
The following result, due to Ringel and Youngs [70] in the orientable case 
and Ringel [66] in the non-orientable case, shows that the upper bound of Theorem 
4.2 is usually exact. 
Theorem 4.5. 
If S is any surface other than the sphere or Klein bottle, then 
X(S) = H(S). 
If Sis the Klein bottle, X(S) 
6 = H(S) - 1. 
Proof. 
The result of Ringel and Youngs, which we mentioned earlier, on the genus 
of ~ shows that y(KH(Sk)) = k so X(Sk) ~ H(Sk) which establishes equality. 
Ringel 
obtained similar results when S is non-orientable and not the Klein bottle. 
If S 
is the Klein bottle, H(S) = 7 but Franklin [27] noticed that K7 cannot be embedded 
in the Klein bottle. 
This implies that if G C S and G is 7-minimal, then there is 
some vertex v of degree 6 two of whose neighbors are not adjacent. 
Now we can pro-
ceed as in the 5 color theorem to obtain a 6-coloring of G. 
Hence, X(S) < 6. 
Since K6 < S, X(S) = 6. 
Now let us use Theorem 4.3 to rederive a portion of a result due to Dirac [23]. 
If S = Sk, it is an easy bit of algebra to see that a(S) is integral for k = 0,3,4, 
or 7 (mod 12) and hence, for these residue classes, a(S) = H(S). 
The theorem is 
also a consequence of an earlier result of Dirac [22]. 
Theorem 4.6. 
Let k I 0 and suppose k- 0,3,4, or 7 (mod 12). 
If G C Sk and 
X(G) = H(Sk), then G contains Kr as a subgraph, where r = H(Sk). 
Proof. 
Let G' be an r-critical subgraph of G. 
Then o(G') > r-1 and, by Theorem 
4.3, d(G') ~ a(Sk) - 1 = r-1. 
Therefore, G' is regular of degree r-1. 
By Brooks' 
Theorem, G' = Kr since X(G') = r. 
This theorem is almost true for s0 . 
Dirac [19] has shown that if G is planar 

94 
and X(G) ; 4, then G has K4 as a subcontraction. 
It follows that G contains a 
subgraph homeomorphic to K4 • 
However, the wheel graph Wk of Tutte [77] fork odd 
and greater than 3 has chromatic number 4 but contains no K4 . 
Obviously, the preceding result holds for any surface S ~ U1 for which a(S) 
is integral - that is, whenever 49 -
24e(S) is the square of an odd number. 
For 
example, when e(S) ; -3, a(S) 
9 ; H(S) and G C S with X(G) ; 9 must contain Kg 
as a subgraph. 
Thus, Dirac's result holds for many non-orientable surfaces as well. 
Question 4.7. 
Does Dirac's theorem also hold for the projective plane? 
5. 
THICKNESS 
If Sis a surface and G is a graph, we define the S-thickness of G, 6g(G), to 
be the minimum number t of subgraphs Gi, 1 < i .::_ t, of G such that G ; U Gi and 
Gi C S. 
Note that one can assume without loss of generality that the Gi are span-
ning subgraphs of G which are edge disjoint. 
Hence, if G(n,m), m .::_ 8s(G) 3 (n-e(S)), 
so we have 
Lemma 5.1. 
If G(n,m), then 8S(G) ~ 3 (n :(S)) · 
Let us write 8k for 8s if S ; Sk, and 8 for e0 . 
Only 8 has been studied 
extensively. 
It turns out that, as with genus, the lower bounds on 8(G) are, in 
fact, realizable, for most graphs in several important families. 
It is an easy consequence of Lemma 5.1 that , for any n, 8(Kn) > [~] • The 
reverse inequality requires an actual decomposition of ~ into planar subgraphs. 
For n i 4 (mod 6) and n ~ 9, this was accomplished by Beineke and Harary [9] and 
Beineke [4]. 
When n = 4 (mod 6), the construction was performed by Mayer [57,58] 
for n 
16, 34,and 40, by Hobbs and Grossman [40] for n ; 22, and by Beineke [4] 
for n 
28. It is known that in the anomalous cases n 
9 and 10, 8(Kn) is one 
greater than [n~ 7 ]. 
See Battle, Harary, and Kodama [1] and Tutte [78]. 
Thus we 
have 
Theorem 5.2. 
If n ~ 9 or 10, then 8(Kn) ; 
[n~ 7 ] for n f 4 (mod 6) or n _ 4 (mod 6) 
and n < 45. 
Moreover, 8(K9); 3; 8(K10). 
Similar results are known for the thickness of ~,q for suitably restricted p 
and q (Beineke, Harary and Moon [10] and Beineke [6]). 

95 
In particular, if p 
q, we find 
6(K 
) = [E±2.] 
p,p 
4 
as predicted by Lemma 5.1, again modified for bipartite graphs. 
If Qd denotes the 
d-dimensional cube, Kleinert [50] has shown that 
Let us also mention here some recent results on e 5 (~) for S # s0• 
It is 
ironic, and reminiscent of the situation for chromatic numbers, that Beineke [3], 
Ringel [69] and Beineke and Harary [7] were able to show: 
Theorem 5.3. 
For all n ~ 3, e1 (Kn) 
[n~4 ], e 2 (~) = [n~ 3 ], and 6s(~) 
where S is the projective plane. 
Let us digress for a moment to consider a modern-day coloring problem. 
Suppose 
that it is desired to simultaneously color a map of the earth and of the moon such 
that each country on earth is colored the same as that portion of tne moon which 
it has colonized. 
Countries and lunar colonies are assumed connected; no country 
has more than one lunar colony. 
Of course, adjacent countries and adjacent colo-
nies are to be colored differently. 
What is the smallest number ko of colors need-
ed? 
Lemma 5.4. 
Let x2 =sup {X(G) !e(G) ~ 2}. 
Then k0 = x2 . 
Proof. Replace both terrestrial and lunar maps by their dual graphs and identify 
each point on earth with its colony (if any) on the moon. 
The resulting graph 
has thickness not exceeding 2. 
This suggests the following more general question: 
Determine 
Xr 
sup {(G)!e(G) ~ r}. 
Of course x1 = 4 or 5 depending on the truth or falsity 
of the 4CC. 
By Theorem 5.2, 6(K6r-3) = r for r > 3 and 6(K8) = 2. 
Moreover, for 
3 ~ r ~ 7, 6(K6r_2) =rand it has been conjectured that this holds for all r > 3. 
On the other hand, if G(n,m) and e(G) = r, then m ~ 3r(n-2) by Lemma 5.1 so d < 6r 
and o(G) ~ 6r-l. 
We obtain, therefore, the following result (see Ringel [66], 
Wilson [80, p. 84] and Kainen [47]). 

96 
Theorem 5.5. 
(a) 
8 < X

(b)

< 6r for 3 < r < 7;

< 6r for r > 7.

(c) 
Since the lower bound in (a) and (b) is given by the maximum-order complete 
graph with the appropriate thickness, it seems likely that the lower bound is, in 
fact, precise. 
In particular, we submit to the reader the following: 
Question 5.6. 
Does there exist a graph G with thickness 2 and chromatic number 
greater than 8? 
Let us note in passing that the analogous questions for toroidal-thickness 81 
are completely solved. 
For if 
X~= sup{X(G)[e1 (G) ~ r}, then by Lemma 5.1, 
X~~ 1 + 6r and, by Theorem 5.3, 
e1 (K1+6r) = r 
so we have: 
Theorem 5. 7. X 'r = 1 + 6r. 
Moreover, we can easily prove as before that if e1 (G) 
r and X(G) 
x'r. then 
G contains K1+6r as a subgraph. 
There are several interesting variants of thickness we should mention here. 
Suppose we are interested in covering a graph by forests (acyclic subgraphs); we 
define the arboricity a(G) of a graph G to be the minimum number of forests whose 
union is G. 
The following elegant result is due to Nash-Williams [59]. 
m 
Theorem 5.8. 
a(G) = 
max {~}, where n is the order of G and mp denotes the maxi-
2~p~n p-l 
mum number of edges in any subgraph of G with p vertices. 
Since mp < 3p - 3 if ll (G) < 3, we obtain 
-
Corollary 5. 9. 
If ll (G) < 3, then a(G) < 3. 
-
If instead of covering all the edges, we merely want to cover the vertices but 
we require that no vertex belong to more than one forest and that the forests be 
induced (i.e., full) subgraphs of G, we obtain the notion of point-arboricity p(G). 
Specifically then p(G) is the minimum number of subsets in a partition of V(G) into 
disjoint subsets Wi such that the subgraph G(Wi), induced by each Wi, is acyclic. 
Chartrand and Kronk [17] have shown that every planar graph has point-arboricity 
< 3. 
In fact, there is a more general result due to Lick and White [56]. 
Let Pk(G) 
denote the minimum number of subsets Wi in a partition of V(G) such that for each 

97 
X( G) and p l (G) 
p(G). 
Lick and White 
proved: 
Theorem 5.10. 
P (G) < 1 + [sw(G)] 
k 
-
k+l 
See also Bezhad and Chartrand [12, pp. 58-63]. 
Since sw(G) < 5 whenever ~(G) ~ 5, we obtain 
Corollary 5.11. 
p(G) < 3 if ~(G) < 5. 
As a consequence X(G) < 6 if ~(G)~ 5 (a fact which we already knew). 
If p(G) 
were < 2 for all planar G, we could prove the 4CC. 
Unfortunately, there are planar 
graphs G with p(G) = 3. 
Let us mention one more form of thickness, the book-thickness of a graph (see 
Bernhart and Kainen [11]). 
The book-thickness of G, bt(G), is the minimum number 
of "pages" (i.e., half-planes) in a "book" (i.e., collection of half-planes all 
meeting along a common edge or "spine") such that G can be ".printed" (drawn) in the 
book so that all vertices lie on the spine, each edge lies within a single page, 
and no edges cross. 
Since the portion of G printed on any particular page is outer-
planar, we have a lower bound on bt(G) in terms of 60 p(G), where 60 p(G) denotes the 
outerplanar thickness of G (minimum number of outerplanar graphs covering G). 
Lemma 5.12. 
bt(G) ~ 60 P(G). 
Note that if G is Hamiltonian planar, 60 p(G) ~ 2 and, since a forest is outer-
planar, 60 p(G) < 3 for any planar graph G. 
However, the stronger assertion that 
bt(G) ~ 3 for any planar graph G may well be false. 
In fact, we conjecture in [11] 
that there are planar graphs with arbitrarily large book thickness. 
Note that a 
graph G has bt(G) = 1 if and only if G is outplanar and bt(G) < 2 if and only if 
G is a spanning subgraph of a Hamiltonian planar graph. 
Book thickness has also 
been investigated by Ollman [62]. 
For more information on thickness, see the survey articles by Hobbs [39] and 
Beineke [5].

PINCHED MANIFOLDS 
A pinched manifold X is a compact topological space X in which every point x 
has a neighborhood Nx which is homeomorphic to the union of bx disjoint copies of 

98 
R2 whose origins have been identified to a single point. 
The point x is singular 
if bx >1, and bx is called its order; x is normal if bx = 1. 
By the compactness 
of X, there are only a finite number of singular points. 
Given a surface S and a 
set F1, .•• ,Fr of subsets of S with 1 < IFil < oo, for 1 < i ~ r, identifying together 
all the points in each Fi one can form a pinched manifold S(F1 , ••• ,Fr) in which the 
only singular points xl•••••xr correspond to Fl•···•Fr and IFil is the order of xi. 
It is shown in Kainen [43] that every pinched manifold is the underlying topologi-
cal space of a 2-dimensional simplicial complex which is a pseudo-manifold,and con-
versely (see Spanier [75, p. 148 and p. 150]). 
Lemma 6.1. 
Every pinched manifold X can be constructed in this way; that is, if X 
is any pinched manifold, there is a surfaceS and subsets Fl•···•Fr such that 
Proof. 
Each neighborhood Nx contains no singular point other than x. 
Replacing 
each neighborhood Nx with the disjoint union of bx copies of R2 has the effect of 
replacing each singular point x with bx normal points while altering nothing else. 
Call the resulting surface S(X) and, for each singular point xi, let F(xi) be the 
set of normal points corresponding to xi. 
If S = S(X) and Fi = F(xi), then 
Let X be a pinched manifold and let G be a graph. 
If f: G +X is an embedding, 
we call f regular provided that, for each singular point x £ X, there is a vertex 
v £ V(G) such that f(v) = x; f is proper if each component of X -
f(G) is an open 
2-cell. 
Note that if f is proper, it must certainly be regular. 
If X is a pinched manifold, X= S(Fi, ••• ,Fr), we define the Euler character-
r 
istic e(X) = e(S) -
L fi, where fi = IFil - 1. 
The following analogue to Theorem 
i=l 
1.4 is proved in [43]. 
Theorem 6.2. 
Let f: G +X be an embedding which is not proper. 
Then X can be 
modified to produce a pinched manifold X* and a proper embedding of G in X*, where 
e(X*) > e(X). 
Now if f: G +X is a proper embedding, Euler's formula holds; that is, we 
have, 

99 
Theorem 6.3. 
If G(n,m) and f: G +X is a proper embedding, then n - m + r 
e(X), 
where r 
number of regions. 
Corollary 6.4. 
If G is any graph of order n and size m edges, and if f: G +X is any 
embedding, then m ~ 3(n- e(X)). 
Let us introduce some notation. 
Let xk denote the pinched manifold 
s0 ({xo•···•xk}) and Xk = s0 (d1, ••• ,dk), where the di are disjoint doubletons 
in s0 . 
For any X, we define X(X) = sup {X(G) IG C:x}. 
Ringel conjectured in [64] 
that X(Xl) = 5. 
This was proved by Dewdney [18] who showed that X(Xk) ~ k + 4. 
The following result which is proved like Theorem 4.2 leads to an improvement of 
Dewdney's upper bound. 
Theorem 6.5. 
For any pinched manifold X f s0 , X(X) ~ H(X), where 
H(X) = [~(7 + /49 - 24e(X)] 
Since e(Xk) = 2- k, we obtain (see Kainen [44]): 
Corollary 6.6. 
For k ~ 1, X(Xk) ~ [7+ 112+ 24k] 
This upper bound is strictly smaller than k + 4 for k > 6 and equals k + 4 
for k = 3,4,5. 
When k = 1, we can use the fact that K6 cannot be embedded in x1 
to prove that X(X1) ~ 5 by the same method we used to prove the 5 color theorem. 
Since K5 C:x1 , we have verified Ringel's conjecture. 
In [47] we improved still 
further on Corollary 6.6. 
Theorem 6.7. 
For any k, X(Xk) < 12. 
Proof. 
Suppose G C Xk. 
Then there is a graph G' C: s0 such that performing the 
appropriate "pinches" on s0 identifies disjoint pairs of vertices of G' to induce 
G C:xk. 
Since d(G') < 6, d(G) < 12. 
Therefore, X(G) < 12. 
We can relate this last theorem to the empire problem of Heawood [38]. Suppose 
that in a map some countries have colonies (not adjacent to them) which must be 
colored the same as the mother country. 
If no country has more than one colony, 
then taking the dual of the map and identifying the pairs of vertices corresponding 
to a country and its colony, we obtain a graph G C:xk, where k is the number of 
countries with colonies. 
Thus, by Theorem 6.7, 12 colors will always suffice for 
this problem. 
Heawood obtained this result and more generally showed that 6(r + 1) 
colors would do if no country had more than r colonies. 
Furthermore, he gave an 

100 
embedding of K12 in X12· 
Now let us consider the pinched manifolds xk. 
Theorem 6.8. 
5 ~ X(Xk) < 6 for k > 1. 
Proof. 
Let G C xk. 
As in the proof of Theorem 6. 7, find a graph G' C s0 which 
induces the embedding of G in xk. 
If G' is 5-colored, then recolor G' using 6 
colors by coloring with a new color all vertices of G' which correspond to the 
singular point of xk and not changing any other colors. 
Thus X(xk) < 6 and since 
K5 Cxk for k ~ 1, x(xk) > 5. 
Now K6 ct. xk since K5 cf:. s0 • 
This suggests that perhaps X(xk) = 5. If the 4CC 
is true, then by initially 4-coloring G' and then recoloring it with 5 colors in 
the proof of Theorem 6.8 we could prove X(Xk) = 5. 
The reader may use the notion of pinched manifold to phrase questions of 
thickness in terms of embedding graphs in pinched manifolds of the form S(Fl•···•Fr), 
where S is a disjoint union of spheres (this is strictly speaking a generalization 
of our original notion of pinched manifold since we formerly insisted on surfaces 
being connected) and the elements of each set Fi belong to separate spheres. 
See 
[47] for more on this topic. 
Finally, we want to formulate a very attractive conjecture which we have hinted 
at several times. 
Let M(X) =max {n!KnCX}. 
Conjecture 6.9. 
X(X) = M(X) for X f So· 
Of course, when X = s0 this is the 4CC. 
For X an orientable or non-orientable 
surface, this is true by Theorem 4.5. It also holds for X= x1 and for X=Xk(k~l2); 
it must hold for X = xk unless the 4CC is false. 
We could go still farther. 
It seems that any "geometric" coloring problem is 
determined by finding the maximum order of a complete graph satisfying the con-
straints. 
For example, Grotzsch's Theorem corresponds to the fact that K4 is not 
triangle-free. 
(Of course, K3 is also not triangle-free but this is the exception 
which proves the rule.) 

101 
7. 
CROSSING NUMBERS AND OTHER INVARIANTS 
A drawing of a graph G in a surface S is a realization of G in S in which 
pairs of edges are allowed to cross (at interior points). 
At most two edges cross 
at any given point and no edge crosses a vertex. 
In the same way that a drawing 
corresponds to a (true) realization, an immersion corresponds to an embedding. 
Thus, f: G ~ S is an immersion if and only if it is an embedding except for dis-
joint pairs of points on edges of G which are identified by f. 
Let cr(f) =number of crossings in an immersion f, and let crs(G) 
min {cr(f) Jf: G ~San immersion}. 
We call crs(G) the S-crossing number 
of G. 
Set crk = crs when S = Sk and cr0 = cr. First of all, let us note that 
crs(G) is always finite since cr(G) < 
00 • 
(To prove the latter assertion, it suf-
fices to represent Kn as a polygon with all its diagonals. 
Hence, cr(~) < 
00 .) 
An immersion f: G ~Sis minimal if cr(f) = crs(G); f is normal if, whenever 
two edges cross, their 4 endpoints are all distinct. 
Thus, no edge crosses itself 
and no two edges with a common endpoint cross. 
The following easy result has been 
noted by many people. 
Lemma 7.1. 
Any minimal immersion is normal. 
Very few results are known for crossing numbers. 
To try to prove that cr(G)= t, 
one first gives a construction to show cr(G) < t and then attempts to justify 
cr(G) ~ t. 
The following conjectures have been suggested by appropriate construc-
tions. 
Conjecture 7.2. 
cr(Kn) i [%] [n;lj [ n;2] [n;3J . 
This conjecture (and the related construction) is due independently to Guy 
(30] and Saaty [71]. 
It is true for n < 10. 
See also Busacker and Saaty [14]. 
Conjecture 7.3. 
cr(~,q) =[!] [Ef] [t] [_cy-J • 
This conjecture was originally a theorem of Zarankiewicz [83] who successfully 
gave a construction but failed to prove the reverse inequality. 
Ringel and Kainen 
independently noticed his error. 
The conjecture is true for min(p,q) ~ 5 
(Kleit-
man [51]). 

102 
Saaty proved [73] that if ~r(Kn) is a polynomial for n odd and a polynomial 
for n even (not necessarily the same polynomial), then 7.2 is valid. 
Kainen [45] 
showed that asymptotically the Guy-Saaty conjecture is valid provided that Zaran-
kiewicz's Conjecture is valid: 
Theorem 7.4. 
If Conjecture 7.3 holds, then 
lim n-4 cr(~) = f4 • 
n~ 
If we restrict ourselves to linear immersions f: G + R2 (that is, the image 
of each edge of G is a straight-line in R2), we obtain the concept of the recti-
linear crossing number 
~(G) of G. 
Harary and Hill [34] conjectured that 
cr(K8) = 19. 
This has been verified by Guy [31]. 
But cr(K8) = 18 so the crossing 
number and rectilinear crossing number are not the same in general. 
Let us pose another problem here for the reader. 
Question 7.5. 
Is ~(Kn) 
cr(~) for n = 0 (mod 3)? 
It would even be nice to evaluate 
lim 
Note that the limit is at 
n~ cr (Kn) 
most 1 (if it exists) since cr(Kn) ~ cr(Kn)· 
We should also mention that Zaran-
kiewicz's construction is linear so perhaps 
~(Kp,q) = cr(Kp,q). 
ErdBs has pointed out that the problem of determining cr(Kn) is precisely the 
problem of Esther Klein of finding how many convex quadrilaterals are determined 
by n points in general position in the plane. 
If S is a surface and G is a graph, we define the S-skewness ~s(G) of G to be 
the minimum number of edges whose removal permits G to be embedded in S. 
If G is 
connected and not a tree, we define Es(G), the Euler deficiency of G on S, to be 
E5 (G) = m -(~) (n-e(S)), where n is the order and m the size of G, and g denotes 
the girth of G (length of shortest cycle). 
We obtained the following theorem in [46]. 
Theorem 7.6. 
If G is connected and not a tree, then Es(G) ~ ~ 5 (G) ~ cr5 (G). 
But K6 can be drawn in the plane with 3 crossings by using two concentric triangles. 
Hence cr(K6) = 3 = ~(K6). However, E(K7) = 6 but cr(K7) = 9 so the inequalities 
are in general not equalities. 
Moreover, if G is toroidal, E(G) ~ 6 but Harary, 
Kainen, and Schwenk [35] showed that there are toroidal graphs with arbitrarily 

103 
large planar crossing numbers. 
We also showed in [46] that the crossing number of a pseudograph ~ (allowing 
multiple edges and loops) is related to crs(G), where G is the underlying graph of 
~ obtained by deleting all multiple edges and loops. 
Specifically, 
Theorem 7.7. 
crs(~) ~ k2 crs(G), where k is the maximum number of parallel edges 
joining any pair of vertices. 
If every pair of vertices is joined by exactly k 
edges, the inequality becomes equality. 
If G Cs, clearly crs(G) = 0. 
Thus, cry(G)(G) = 0. 
In [48] we considered 
the question of determining cry(G)-k(G) for G a cube Qd. 
This was inspired by the 
observation that £ y(Qd)-k (Qd) = 4k. 
For k "small" compared to y(Qd) we could show 
cry(Qd)-k(Qd) ~ 8k. 
Thus, we have the following theorem which gives information 
on the crossing number of Qd in the "stable range". 
(Recall, from Section 2, that 
Theorem 7. 8. 
For Sa surface and G a graph, As(G), the S-local crossing number of G, is 
min{A(f) jf: G +San immersion}, where A(f) denotes the maximum number of crossings 
on any edge in f(G). 
It will be convenient to define the thickness of an immersion 
f:G + S, S(f), to be the minimum number of subgraphs Gi of G such that fjGi is an 
embedding and G = L)Gi. 
It is not difficult to show that Ss(G) = min{S(f) jf: G + S 
an immersion} (see [49], the proof requires use of the homogeneity of a manifold). 
Theorem 7.9. 
SS(G) ~ 1 + As(G). 
Proof. 
It suffices to show that, for any immersion f: G + S, S(f) ~ 1 + A(f). 
Define the crossing graph Gf of f as follows: 
V(Gf) = E(G) and two vertices of Gf 
are adjacent if and only if the corresponding edges cross. 
Then ~(Gf) = A(f) and 
X(Gf) = S(f) so since X(Gf) < 1 + ~(Gf), S(f) < 1 + A(f). 
Guy, Jenkyns, and Schaer [32] have obtained some estimates on the toroidal 
crossing number of Kn. 
We should also mention work of Tutte [79] and more recently 
Levow [55] which gives an algebraic topological formulation of crossing numbers. 
Levow points out that Tutte's work is an independent rediscovery of the ideas of 
Shapiro [74] and Wu [81].

ABSTRACT 
A latin square is an n x n array such that in each row and column each of 
the integers 1,2,3, .•• ,n occurs exactly once. 
A partial latin square is ann x n 
array such that in each row and column each of the integers 1,2, ..• ,n occurs at most 
once. 
An example of a 4 x 4 partial latin square is given below. 
An immediate observation shows that the partial latin square P cannot be completed 
to a latin square; i.e., the empty cells cannot be filled in with numbers from the 
set {1,2,3,4} so that the result is a latin square.

A SURVEY OF FINITE EMBEDDING THEOREMS FOR PARTIAL 
LATIN SQUARES AND QUASIGROUPS 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
A latin square is an n ~ n 
array such that in each row and column each of 
the integers 1,2,3, ... ,n occurs exactly once. 
We remark that there is nothing 
sacred about the integers 1,2,3, ••• ,n and that any set containing n distinct 
objects can be used to fill in cells. 
A quasigroup is an ordered pair (Q,o) 
where Q is a set and o is a binary operation Q such that the equations 
a o x = b 
and y o a = b 
are uniquely solvable for every pair of elements a and b in Q. 
We 
will only be interested in finite latin squares and quasigroups and so we can think 
of a quasigroup as a latin square with a headline and a sideline. 
A partial latin 
square is an 
n ~ n 
array such that in each row and column each of the integers 
1,2, •.• ,n occurs at most once and a partial quasigroup is a partial latin square 
with a headline and a sideline. 
An example of a 
4 x 4 partial latin square is 
given below.

An immediate observation shows that the partial latin square P cannot be completed 
to a latin square; i.e., the empty cells cannot be filled in with numbers from the 
set {1,2,3,4} 
so that the result is a latin square. 
This is because as soon as 
cell (3,4) 
is filled in a contradiction arises. 
A very obvious question to ask 
at this point is whether or not it is possible to complete P if we are allowed to 
enlarge P and introduce additional symbols. 
That is, does there exist an m x m 
latin square Q agreeing with P in its upper left hand corner? 
(P is said to be 
embedded in Q). 
In his by now classic paper 
Embedding incomplete latin squares, [4) 
Trevor Evans has shown that this is always possible. 
In fact, Evans proved that 

111 
any n x n partial latin square could be embedded in some t x t latin square for 
every t > 2n ... , the best possible result of this kind. 
Evans' paper is now 
generic. 
It has become the starting point for a fascinating collection of problems 
in the study of latin square: 
the so-called finite embedding problems for partial 
latin squares and quasigroups. 
It is this collection of problems that will be sur-
veyed in this paper. 
We will jump back and forth between latin squares and quasi-
groups using whichever notation and terminology facilitates the topics order 
discussion (mostly latin squares). 
This will cause no difficulty. 
Examples are 
included at every opportunity to (hopefully) illustrate what is going on. 
2. 
THE EVANS CONJECTURE 
We begin our study of finite embedding problems in the most logical way: 
with 
latin squares which can be completed; i.e., the empty cells filled in so that the 
result is a latin square. 
As we have already seen this cannot be done in general. 
In fact, it is always possible to construct, for 
n > 2 , an 
n x n partial latin 
square with only n cells occupied which cannot be completed. 
For example, if n= 4, 
the 4 x 4 partial latin square given below cannot be completed. 
Example 2.1. 
1 
2 
3 
4 
Quite frequently, of course, a given 
n x n partial latin square with con-
siderably more than n cells occupied can be completed ••• ,but in view of the 
preceding remarks, the best possible general embedding theorem along these lines 
would be that any 
n x n 
partial latin squares with at most 
n -
1 
cells occupied 
can always be completed. 
The following conjecture is due to Trevor Evans [4]. 

112 
The Evans Conjecture. 
A partial n x n latin square with at most 
n - 1 cells 
occupied can always be completed to a latin square. 
The following special cases of the Evans Conjecture have been verified. 
We 
state each along with an indication of the proof and an example of the construction 
used in each case. 
Theorem 2.2. 
(C. C. Lindner [11]). 
Let I be ann x n partial latin square with 
n - 1 cells occupied. 
Let r denote the number of rows in which the occupied cells 
occur and c the number of columns in which the occupied cells occur. 
n 
If r ~ [ 2 ] 
or 
c < [ ~ 
-
2 
then 
I can be completed to a latin square. 
Proof. 
For the time being a (partial) 
r x s 
latin rectangle is meant an 
r x s 
array such that (in some subset of the rs cells of the array) each of the cells is 
occupied by an integer from the set 1,2, ••. ,s 
and such that no integer from the 
set 1,2, .•• ,s occurs in any row or column more than once. 
In other words, an 
r x s 
(partial) latin rectangle is just the first r rows of some 
s x s (partial) 
latin square. 
The last statement is justified due to a result of Marshall Hall [8]. 
We can assume that 
n 
r ~ [ 2 ] and so a suitable permutation of the rows of I 
gives a 
r 
x n partial latin rectangle R. 
In [11] it is shown that R can be com-
pleted to a latin rectangle. 
This is done by filling in one row at a time of the 
partial 
r x n 
latin rectangle R as follows. 
Suppose the first t rows of R have 
been filled in so that the result is still an 
r 
x n 
partial latin rectangle. 
Let 
(t+l, i 1), (t+l, i 2), .•• ,(t+l, ik) 
be the empty cells in row 
t + 1. 
Denote by 
S. 
, j = 1,2, •.• ,k, the set of symbols not occuring in row 
~. 
J 
t + 1 
or column 
Then the sets s. , si , ... , s. 
~1 
2 
~k 
always have a system of distinct representatives 
(SDR) [18]. 
Any SDR will give a completion of row T + 1. 
This technique works 
only in case 
t ~ [ I ] - 1 
so that this technique will not necessarily complete 
1 x m partial latin rectangles with 1 > [I] . 
In [8], Marshall Hall has shown 
that a suitable number of rows can be added to a latin rectangle so that the result 
is a latin square. 
If R is the completion of R, then adding 
n - r 
rows to R gives 
a latin square which after a suitable permutation of rows gives the desired com-
pletion.

We remark that in the above example a great deal of technique is necessary to go 
from R to R and from R to R*. 
We will not go into this here. 
We are only interested 
in the fact that the procedures described can in fact be carried out. 
Theorem 2. 4. 
(J. Marica and J. Schllnheim [15]). 
An 
n x n partial latin square with 
n- 1 cells occupied can be completed to a latin square if the occupied cells are in 
different rows and different columns. 
Proof. 
The proof is based on the following result due to Marshall Hall [9] that 
if A is an abelian group of order nand b1 , ••. ,bn are any n elements of A such that 
b1+b2+ ••• +bn = 0, then there is a permutation 
::) 
of the elements of A so that ai + ci = bi , i 
1,2, ••• ,n. 
Since the occupied 
cells are in different rows and columns they can all be considered to be on the 
main diagonal. 
Let 
b1 ,b2, ••• ,bn-l be the (not necessarily distinct) elements 
in the occupied cells. 
If we identify the distinct hi's with distinct elements 

115 
of an abelian group of order nand set bn =- (b1 + b2 + ... + bn_1), 
then 
b1 + b2 + ... + bn = 0. 
Hence there is a permutation of A so that ai + ci = bi, 
i = 1,2, .•• ,n. 
Now defining a latin square L by filling in cell (i,j) with 
ai + cj 
gives the required completion.

As in the previous example, technique is involved which has been omitted, in par-
ticular, the construction of the permutation used to construct 
I* . 
We close this section with a very clever observation due to Allan Cruse which 
can be used to extend these results. 
First we will need some preliminary remarks 
(which will also be useful to later sections). 
Let L be a (partial) latin square and ~the 
L : i.e., (x,y,z) e; t: if and only if cell (x,y) 
set of triples associated with 
of L is occupied by z. ;( ~s 
called a conjugate of ;(if for some 
a e; s3 , (x1,x2,x3) e: .;t'~f and only if 
(x1a , x2a , x3a) e: ~ [19]. 
Two latin squares are said to be conjugate if their 
associated triples have this property. 
The proof of the following theorem is tri-
vial. 

118 
Theorem 2.6. 
Let L be a partial latin square. 
If L can be completed then so can 
any conjugate of L. 
Corollary 2.7. 
Let I be a partial latin square of order n with at most n- 1 cells 
occupied. 
Then I can be completed provided that at most [ ~] symbols are used or 
n - 1 distinct symbols are used and the occupied cells are in different rows or 
different columns. 
This last result is obtained by noting that in the first case I is the conju-
n 
gate of a partial latin square having occupied cells in at most [ 2 ] rows or 
columns whereas in the second case I is the conjugate of a partial latin square in 
which no two of the occupied cells are in the same.row or column. 
Example 2.8. 
Let P be the 8 x 8 partial latin square given below.

7 
2 
p 
6 
1

7 
Now the number of occupied rows is 5 and the number of occupied columns is 6,both 
> 4 and so Theorem 2.2 is not applicable. 
Since the occupied cells are not pair-
wise in different rows and columns Theorem 2.4 cannot be used for a completion. 
However since only the 4 symbols 1, 2, 6 and 7 are used, Corollary 2.7 can be used 
for a completion as follows. 
The set of triples ~associated with Pis &0={(1,2,1), 
(7,6,1), (2,4,2), (5,3,6), (8,1,6), (2,1,7), (8,7,7)}. 
Applying the permutation 
~=/ 
(1 2 3) to yDgives the conjugate collection tT 
{(1,1,2), (1,7,6), (2,2,4), 
(6,5,3), (6,8,1), (7,2,1), (7,8,7)}. 
The partial latin square associated with 
is just the partial latin square I given in Example 2.3. 
Let L be the completion 

119 
of I given in Example 2.3. 
Applying the permutation (1 3 2), the inverse of 
(1 2 3), to the collection of triples associated with L gives a conjugate collection 
of triples whose associated latin square L* is a completion of P.

3. 
THE EVANS EMBEDDING THEOREM 
As we have already seen in sections 1 and 2, it is not always possible to fill 
in the cells of a partial latin square so that the result is a latin square. 
Two 
problems arise quite naturally with respect to partial latin squares which cannot 
be completed. 
The first rather obvious problem is whether a partial latin square 
which cannot be completed can be finitely embedded at all; i.e., embedded in a 
finite latin square. 
If the answer to this problem is yes, the second problem is 
to determine (if possible) the smallest possible general embedding theorem. 
That 
is to determine for each positive integer n the smallest positive integer N such 
that any n x n partial latin square can be embedded in some t x t latin square 
where t < N. 
Both of these problems have been successfully handled by Trevor Evans 
[4]. 
We will need a few preliminary notions before stating and proving Evans' 
Theorem. 
We begin by giving a more general defition of a latin rectangle. 
Recall that 
in section 2 we defined an r x s latin rectangle to be (courtesy of M. Hall [8]) 
the first r rows of some s x s latin square. 
We will now agree that an r x s 

120 
latin rectangle based on 1,2, ••• ,n is an r x s array such that each cell is occupied 
by one of the integers 1,2,,,,,n and such that each of these integers occurs in 
each row and column at most once, 
If we omit the expression "based on 1,2, ... ,n" 
it will be understood that the r x s latin rectangle is based on 1,2, •.. ,s which is 
the definition of latin rectangle given in section 2.

R is a 3 x 5 latin rectangle based on 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. It is also a 3 x 5 latin 
rectangle based on any set of positive integers containing 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. 
An r x s latin rectangle R is said to be embedded in the n x n latin square L 
provided that the r x s upper left hand corner of L is R. 
The following theorem is due to H. J. Ryser and gives necessary and sufficient 
conditions for an r x s latin rectangle to be embedded in an n x n latin square. 
Theorem 3.2. (H. J. Ryser [17]). 
Let R be an r x s latin rectangle based on 
1,2, ••. ,n. 
Let N(i) denote the number of times that the integer i occurs in R. 
Then R can be embedded in an n x n latin square if and only if N(i) > r + s - n 
for every i = 1,2, ••• ,n. 
Example 3.3. 
(1) 
R

on 1,2,3 ,4 . 
R can be embedded in a 4 x 4 latin square since 2 + 3 - 4

N(2) = 2 .::_ 1, N(3) = 1 > 1, and N(4) = 1 > 1.

-3 and N(i) ~ 0 ~ -3 
for every i = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. 
We are now in a position to state and prove the Evans Embedding Theorem. (This 
theorem was also obtained independently by S. K. Stein). 
Theorem 3.4. 
(T. Evans [4]). 
A partial n x n latin square can be embedded in a 
t x t latin square for every t > 2n. 
Proof. 
Let P be ann x n partial latin square based on 1,2, ..• ,nand t a positive 
integer > 2n. 
Write t = k + n and let K be a k x k latin square based on n + 1, 
n + 2, ••• , n + k = t. Fill in any unoccupied cells of P with the entry in the 
corresponding cell in the n x n upper left hand corner of K. 
This turns the partial 
latin square Pinto ann x n latin rectangle P based on 1,2, •.. ,n + k = t. 
By 
Ryser's Theorem P can be embedded in a t x t latin square T if and only if 
N(i) ~ n + n- t for all i = 1,2, •.• ,t. Since t > 2n, n + n- t < 0 and the con-
dition N(i) ~ n +n-tis trivially satisfied completing the proof. 
The following example illustrates the construction used in this proof.

This example illustrates the embedding of a 4 x 4 partial latin square in a 9 x 9, 
latin square. 
Going from the 4 x 4 latin rectangle P to the latin square T takes 
lots of paper and lots of technique which we will not go into here. 
What is im-
portant is that Ryser's Theorem guarantees that it can be done. 
We close this section by remarking that Evans' Theorem is the best possible 
embedding theorem of its kind for partial latin squares because a latin square is 
also a partial latin square and (just like a group) cannot be embedded in a latin 

123 
square less than twice its size. 
The reader with a vivid imagination can even 
construct for every n ~ 4 a "honest-to-gosh" partial latin square which cannot be 
embedded in a latin square less than twice its size. 
Those without vivid imagi-
nations see [4]. 
Of course in many cases a particular n x n partial latin square 
can be embedded in a latin square less than twice its size. 
However in view of 
the preceding remarks, an n x n partial latin square cannot in general be embedded 
in a latin square smaller than 2n x 2n. 
4. 
STEINER TRIPLE SYSTEMS AND LATIN SQUARES 
There are many properties that a latin square can have in addition to being 
a latin square. 
Such properties as being idempotent, commutative, or idempotent 
and commutative (for example). 
We can ask the same questions for these latin 
squares as we did for latin squares in general. 
For example, can a finite partial 
commutative latin square be embedded in a finite commutative latin square, and if 
so, what is the best possible general embedding theorem with respect to the size 
of the containing square. 
In order to look at these more exotic embedding problems 
(as. they were originally solved) we must first introduce some results on (partial) 
Steiner triple systems. 
In particular a very important theorem due to Christine 
Treash [20] on the finite emheddability of finite partial Steiner triple systems. 
This may look at first as though it is off of the subject but as we shall see in 
the sections which follow, it is exactly what is necessary. 
A Steiner triple system is a pair (S,t) where S is a finite set and t is a 
collection of three element subsets of S such that every pair of elements of S 
occur in exactly one of the triples of t. It is well known that the spectrum for 
Steiner triple systems is the set of all n - 1 or 3 (mod 6) [16]. 
There is a very 
useful connection (to put it mildly) between Steiner triple systems and latin 
squares due toR. H. Bruck [1]. 
The connection is as follows. 
Let (Q,q) be a 
Steiner triple system and define a latin square based on Q as follows. 
(1) 
cell (x,x) is occupied by x, and 
(2) 
cell (x,y), x # y, is occupied by z if and only if {x,y,z} £ q. 

124 
The resulting latin square called a Steiner latin square (when considered as a 
quasigroup) satisfies the following identities. 
{
~-x 
Steiner 
x(xy) = y 
identities (yx)x = y ~ 
idempotent identity 
symmetric identities 
In terms of latin squares the identity x2 = x says that cell (x,x) is occupied by 
x, whereas x(xy) = y says that whenever cell (x,y) is occupied by z then cell 
(x,z) is occupied by y (analogously for (yx)x = y). It is important to note that 
the symmetric identities imply the commutative law and so a Steiner latin square 
is commutative. 
Conversely, any latin square based on the set Q satisfying the 
Steiner identities gives rise to a Steiner triple system (Q,q) by placing the 
3-element subset {x,y,z} in q if and only if cell (x,y) is occupied by z. 
A Steiner 
triple system (Q,q) and Steiner latin square based on Q are said to be associated 
provided that {x,y,z} £ q if and only if cell (x,y) is occupied by z.

A partial Steiner triple system is a pair (Q,q) where Q is a finite set and q is a 
collection of three element subsets of Q such that every pair of elements of Q 
occur in at most one of the triples of q. 
Whereas the spectrum for Steiner triple 
systems is the set of all positive integers n : 1 or 3 (mod 6) there is no cardi-
nality restriction on Q when (Q,q) is partial. 
A partial Steiner triple system is 
equivalent to a partial Steiner latin square; i.e., a partial latin square such 
that 

125 
(1) cell (x,x) is occupied by x, all x, aoo 
(2) if cell (x,y) is occupied by z then cell (y,z) is 
occupied by x, cell (z,x) is occupied by y, cell 
(y,x) is occupied by z, cell (x,z) is occupied by 
y, and finally cell (z,y) is occupied by x.

partial Steiner latin square

The partial Steiner triple system (P,p) is said to be embedded in the Steiner 
triple system (V,v) if (not too surprisingly) P ~V and p C:v. 
The partial Steiner 
triple system (Q,q) of Example 4.2 is embedded in the Steiner triple system (S,t) 
of Example 4.1. 
The clever observer will note that the partial Steiner latin 
square associated with (Q,q) is also embedded in the Steiner latin square associ-
ated with (S,t). 
The question arises immediately as to whether every partial 
Steiner triple system (partial Steiner latin square) can be finitely embedded in a 
Steiner triple system (Steiner latin square). 
The question was answered in the 
affirmative by Christine Treash [20]. 
Theorem 4.2. (C. Treash [20]). 
A finite partial Steiner triple system can be 
finitely embedded. 
Treash's construction is difficult and large. 
Since the proof is so very 
tedious we will not even indicate a proof here. 
The technique used in the proof 
is not necessary for what follows. 
A simple proof of Treash's Theorem would be 
very desirable ••• also a much smaller embedding. 
Treash's results guarantee that 
a partial Steiner triple system (Q,q) of order IQI = n can be embedded in a Steiner 

126 
triple system (S,t) of order lsi < 22n, The best possible result would probably 
be close to 2k + 1 where k is the smallest positive integer greater than n which 
is_ 1 or 3 (mod 6). 
Both of these problems are far from a solution. 
The use of Treash's Theorem in order to obtaining embedding theorems for 
certain kinds of latin squares gives very large containing squares. 
As we shall 
subsequently see, different techniques can be used to improve the size of the 
containing square. 
But now we turn our attention to the use of Treash's Theorem 
in order to solve an interesting (at least to the author) collection of finite 
embedding problems. 
5. 
EMBEDDING IDEMPOTENT LATIN SQUARES 
By a partial idempotent latin square is meant a partial square with the 
additional requirement that cell (x,x) is occupied by x.

partial 5 x 5 idempotent latin square 
The problem as to whether every partial idempotent latin square can be finitely 
embedded in an idempotent latin square is due to S. K. Stein. 
The solution to this 
problem was obtained by the author in [12] via the use of Treash's Theorem. 
Sub-
sequently, A. J. W. Hilton [10] obtained a much smaller embedding using completely 
elementary methods. 
Hilton's method will be dealt with in a later section. 
We 
concern ourselves now with the original embedding solution (because the technique 
is quite useful in looking at similar problems). 
Let P be a n x n partial idempotent latin square based on the set N = {1,2,3, 
... ,n}. 
If the only occupied cells are on the main diagonal then P can be completed 
since it is well known that there is an idempotent latin square of every size. 
We 

127 
consider the case where there are t occupied cells of P off the main diagonal, say 
(a1 ,bl), (a2,b2), ••• , (at,bt) where cell (ai,bi) is occupied by ci. In [12] it 
is shown that it is possible to construct a finite partial Steiner triple system 
(S,T) with the following properties: 
(1) 
NCS. 
(2) 
T contains four triples of the form {ai,bi,x}, {ai'ci,y}, 
{bi,ci,z}, and {x,y ,z}, where none of x, y, or z belong to N, 
(3) 
if x £ S ""- N, T contains exactly one triple of the form 
{a,b,x}, where a and b belong toN. 
Now embed (S,T) in a finite Steiner triple system (S,T) and let I be the Steiner 
latin square associated with (S,T). 
We now transform I into a latin square con-
taining P in its upper left hand corner. 
This is accomplished as follows. 
For 
each i = 1,2, •.• ,t, let T(ai,bi) = {{ai,bi,x}, {ai,ci,y}, {bi,Ci,z}, {x,y,z}} and 
R(ai,bi) = {(ai,bi), (ai,y), (z,bi), (z,y)}. 
Now in I the cells (ai,bi) and (z,y) 
are occupied by x and the cells (ai,y) and (z,bi) are occupied by ci. If the x's 
and the ci's are interchanged in these four cells the result is a latin square with 
cell (ai,bi) occupied by ci• 
In [12] it is shown that, fori# j, R(ai,bi) r-J 
R(aj,bj) = 0 and so the above procedure ~an be performed on each of the rectangles 
R(ai,bi) simultaneously. 
This, of course transforms I into a latin square Q with 
P embedded in the upper left hand corner. 
Q is clearly idempotent since none of 
the cells in any of the rectangles R(ai,bi) belongs to the main diagonal. 
This 
gives the following theorem, 
Theorem 5.2. 
(C. C. Lindner [12]). 
A finite partial idempotent latin square can 
be embedded in a finite idempotent latin square. 
Because Theorem 5.2 is based on Treash's Theorem the containing square can 
possibly be almost as large as 22n. 
A different construction due to A. J. W. Hilton 
(which we will look at in a later section) gives a containing square no larger than 
4n [10]. 
This is still not the best possible result. 
The best possible general 
result would be that an n x n partial idempotent latin square can be embedded in an 
idempotent latin square no larger than 2n + 1. 
This problem is still open. 
As the 
following example illustrates we can frequently find containing squares smaller than 

128 
those guaranteed by Theorem 5.2 or even Hilton's result.

s 
{1,2,3,4,5,6,7} 
T 
{{2,3,5}, {2,1,6}, {3,1,7}, {5,6,7}}. 
It is easily seen that (S,T) has properties (1), (2), and (3) stated in the proof

Let (S,T) be the Steiner triple system given by

Remarks. 
The partial latin square P given in the above example is commutative. 
There are two reasons for this. 
The first is that this gives the simplest non-
trivial example of a partial idempotent latin square which cannot be completed (so 
that the example does not become overly tedious) and secondly it will serve as ari 
example for results obtained in the next section (on embedding partial commutative 
latin squares). 
The technique used in Theorem 5.2 to embed partial idempotent latin 
squares has nothing to do with the partial latin square being commutative. 
Finally, 
the partial Steiner triple system (S,T) has the same size as (S,T); i.e. lsi = 151. 
Quite obviously, Treash's Theorem was not used to obtain the embedding. 
The con-
struction used in Theorem 5.2 uses only the fact that the partial Steiner triple 
system (S,T) can be finitely embedded. 
The means by which the embedding is obtained 
is incidental. 
Treash's Theorem guarantees a finite embedding can be obtained. 
6. 
EMBEDDING COMMUTATIVE LATIN SQUARES 
Shortly after the problem of embedding partial idempotent latin squares was 
solved the following two additional questions were raised by s. K. Stein. 
(1) 
Can a finite partial idempotent commutative latin 
square be embedded in a finite idempotent commu-
tative latin square?, and 
(2) 
Can a finite partial commutative latin square be 
embedded in a finite commutative latin square? 

130 
Stein conjectured when he raised these two questions that the answer to (1) was 
probably very easy while the answer to (2) was probably less obvious. 
He was 
right on both counts. 
Theorem 6.1. 
(C. C. Lindner [14]). 
A finite partial idempotent commutative latin 
square can be embedded in a finite idempotent commutative latin square. 
Proof. 
The same construction used in the proof of Theorem 5.2 gives the desired 
completion. 
This is really not too surprising since a bit of reflection results 
in seeing that T(x,y) = T(y,x) and therefore for every pair of occupied cells (x,y) 
and (y,x) in the partial square P that the rectanglesR(x,y) and R(y,x) have the 
property that (a,b) E R(x,y) if and only if (b,a) E R(y,x). 
Since Steiner latin 
squares are commutative interchanging symbols in theserectangles does not affect 
commutativity. 
We remark that although the cells in R(x,y) and R(y,x) are symmetrically placed 
about the main diagonal when the partial latin square P is commutative this is ob-
viously not the case if P is not commutative. 
As promised, Example 5.3 serves as 
an example of the technique used to embedd partial idempotent commutative latin 
squares. 
Having dispensed with the easy part of this section we proceed with the less 
obvious part. 
Theorem 6.2. 
(C. C. Lindner [12]). 
A finite partial commutative latin square can 
be embedded in a finite commutative latin square. 
Proof. 
The proof involves drawing the right kind of pictures. 
Let P be ann x n 
partial commutative latin square based on 1,2, ••• ,n. 
Let I be the 3n x 3n partial 
idempotent latin square based on 1,2, ••• ,3n given below. 
The blocks (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), and (3,1) are empty and only the main diagonal 
of blocks (1,1) and (2,2) are occupied. 
In block (3,3) is P with the main diagonal 
of P removed. 
The blocks (2,3) and (3,2) are empty except for the projection of the 
occupied cells in P on the main diagonal (if any) onto their main diagonals. 
Now 
I is a finite partial idempotent commutative latin square and so by Theorem 6.1 can 
be embedded in a finite idempotent commutative latin square K based on 1,2, ••• ,k.

Now define a new latin square K(e) based on a new symbol e along with 1,2, •.. ,k 
from K by "stripping" the main diagonal of K as shown in the accompanying diagram. 
e 1 2 ........................... k 
1 
2 
k 
e e e 
K(e) 
e 
The big block is just K with 
the entries on the main di-
agonal replaced by e (and 
the main diagonal projected 
onto the 1 x k and k x 1 
blocks along the headline 
and sideline). 

132 
If cell (i,i) in P was occupied with ci, then in K(e) cells (2n + i + 1, n + i + 1) 
and (n + i + 1, 2n + i + 1) are occupied by ci. Let R(i,i) = {(2n + i + 1, n + i + 1), 
(n + i + 1, 2n + i + 1)' (2n + i + 1, 2n + i + 1), (n + i + 1, n + i + 1)}. Clearly, 
ifi t- j and cells (i,i) and (j ,j) are occupied in P then R(i,i) n R(j ,j) 
0. 
Hence interchanging thee's and the ci's in each of these squares gives a copy of 
P somewhere in K(e). 
A suitable permutation of rows and columns now places Pin 
the upper left hand corner of a commutative latin square.

Some remarks are in order. 
In the proof of Theorem 6.1 (as in the proof of 
Theorem 5.2) Treash's Theorem guarantees a finite embedding. 
Any means of obtaining 
the embedding is legal. It is often possible to obtain (as has been previously 
mentioned) much smaller embeddings for a given partial Steiner triple system than 
the results guaranteed by Treash's Theorem. 
In fact, for every fairly small partial 
Steiner triple system of order n that the author has looked at, it has always been 
possible to embed this system by trial and error (without too much difficulty) in 
a Steiner triple system of order less than or equal to 2k + 1 where k is the smalle& 
positive integer greater than or equal ton which is: 1 or 3 (mod 6). 
This is very 
tantilizing. 
However (as has also been previously noted) there is as yet no better 
general embedding theorem for partial Steiner triple systems than Treash's Theorem. 
In the proof of Theorem 6.2 any means of embedding the partial idempotent commuta-
tive latin square I in a finite idempotent commutative latin square K will do. 
As 
in Example 6.3 this can frequently be done by trial and error (lots of error) so 
that the resulting square is much smaller than the size guaranteed by Theorem 6.1. 
As a final comment (this has also been mentioned several times) we remark that 
regardless of how one goes about any of the embedding theorems looked at so far, 
a terrific amount of technique is involved most of which has been omitted. 
7. 
CONJUGATE QUASIGROUPS AND IDENTITIES 
We now dramatically switch from latin squares to quasigroup notation and 
terminology. 
We restate briefly in terms of quasigroups the results of sections 
4, 5, and 6. 
Section 4. 
A Steiner quasigroup is a quasigroup satisfying the identities 
idempotent identity 
Steiner 
identities 
symmetric identities 

136 
A partial Steiner quasigroup is a partial idempotent quasigroup (Q,o), q o q 
q 
for all q ~ Q, such that whenever p ~ q ~ Q and p o q is defined then so are q o p, 
p o (p o q), (q o p) o p, q o (p o q), and (q o p) o q and furthermore p o q 
q o p, 
p o (p o q) ; (q o p) o p 
q, and q o (p o q) ; (q o p) o q ; p. 
In terms of 
quasigroups Treash's Theorem says that a finite partial Steiner quasigroup can be 
embedded in a finite Steiner quasigroup. 
Section 5. 
A finite partial idempotent quasigroup can be embedded in a finite 
idempotent quasigroup. 
Section 6. 
A finite partial commutative (idempotent commutative) quasigroup can 
be embedded in a finite commutative (idempotent commutative) quasigroup. 
We now reintroduce the use of the conjugates of a quasigroup in a slightly 
more algebraic setting. 
Let (Q, (9 ) be any (partial) quasigroup. Define six 
(partial) binary operations 0(1,2,3), 0Cl,3,2), 
@(2,1,3), 
@(2,3,1), 
@(3,1,2), 
and 0(3,2,1) 
on Q as follows: 
a 0 b; c if and only if 
a 0 (1,2,3)b ; c 
a 0 (1,3,2)c 
b 
b(3)(2,1,3)a 
c 
b 0 (2,3,l)c ; a 
c 0 (3,1,2)a 
b 
c 0 (3,2,l)b ; a 
The six (not necessarily distinct) (partial) quasigroups (Q, 0(i,j,k)) are called 
the conjugates of 
(Q,@) 
[19]. 
Two quasigroup identities w1 (x,y) ; v1 (x,y) and 
w2(x,y) ; v 2(x,y) are said to be conjugate provided that if 
(Q,0) is a quasi-
group satisfying one of them, then at least one conjugate of 
(Q,0) satisfies 
the other. 
Theorem 7.1. 
(S. K. Stein [19]). 
The quasigroup identities xy 
and (yx)x ; y are conjugates. 
yx, x(xy) 
y, 
By a partial x(xy) ; y ((yx)x ; y) quasigroup is meant a partial quasigroup 
(Q,o) such that whenever p o q is defined then so is p o (p o q) ((p o q) o q) and 
furthermore p o (p o q); q ((p o q) o q; p). 

137 
Corollary 7.2. 
Let (Q,(9) be a partial x(xy) = y ((yx)x = y quasigroup. 
Then 
at least one conjugate of (Q,(9) is a partial commutative quasigroup. 
Proof. 
Let (Q,(9) be a partial x(xy) = y quasigroup. 
Claim: (Q,(9(3,2,1) is 
a partial commutative quasigroup. 
So let x,y £ Q and suppose that x@(3,2,l)y 
z. 
Then z @(1,2,3)y = x. 
Since @(1,2,3) = 0 and Q satisfies x(xy) = y, z 0 y = x 
impliesz@x= y; i.e., z@(l,2,3)x = y. 
Hencey@(3,2,l)x = z and so (Q,@(3,2,1)) 
is a partial commutative latin square as claimed. 
Corollary 7.3. 
Let (Q~) be a finite partial x(xy) = y ((yx)x = y) quasigroup. 
Then (Q,@) can be embedded in a finite x(xy) = y ((yx)x = y) quasigroup. 
Proof. 
Let (Q,@) be a finite partial x(xy) = y quasigroup. 
Then (Q,@(3,2,1)) 
is a finite partial commutative quasigroup. 
Embed (Q,(9(3,2,1)) in the finite 
commutative quasigroup (V,(V). 
Then (V,~(3,2,1)) is a x(xy) = y quasigroup 
and (Q,@) is embedded in (V,~(3,2,1)).

quasigroup but that (Q,@) cannot be completed 
to any quasigroup. 
Partial commutative quasigroup obtained from 
(Q,@) by conjugation. 
The partial commutative quasigroup (Q,@(3,2,1)) is the partial commutative 
quasigroup in Example 6.3 (after adding a headline and a sideline). 
Let (V,(V) 
be quasigroup in Example 6.3 in which (Q,@(3,2,1)) is embedded. 
Then (V,()(3,2,1)) 
is a partial x(xy) = y quasigroup and (Q,@) is embedded in (V,()(3,2,1)).

(V,~(3,2,1)). 
Let I 1 , I 2, I 3 , I 4, Is, I6, I 7 , Is denote the following collection of quasi-
group identities.

In view of the preceding results along with the observation that the idempotent 
identity x2 = x is invariant under conjugation we have the following theorem. 
Theorem 7.S. 
A finite partial Ik quasigroup can be embedded in a finite Ik quasi-
group for every k £ {1,2,3,4,S,6,7,S}.

Remarks. 
As we shall see in the next two sections there are some simpler methods 
for the finite embeddings and some methods (not necessarily simpler) that give 
smaller embeddings than those obtained in Theorems 5.2, 6.1, and 6.2. 
Therefore 
some justification for their extensive use so far is in order. 
(1) 
The constructions based on Treash's Theorem (that a finite 
partial Steiner triple system can be embedded in a finite 
Steiner triple system) are the original constructions used 
to solve the embedding problems ffientioned so far. 
They are 
of interest in themselves. 
They give a unified approach to 
all of the problems considered in this set of notes. 
(2) 
The problem of whether or not finite partial totally symmetric 
quasigroups (quasigroups satisfying the two identities x(xy) = y 
and (yx)x = y) can be finitely embedded in a totally symmetric 
quasigroup is still unsolved. 
Possibly the constructions used 
so far can be used to settle this problem. 
There seems (at 
least to the author) to be no way for the methods of Hilton 
and Cruse to gain a solution. 
(3) 
Although not mentioned in this set of notes, the construction 
given in Theorem 5.2 to embed partial idempotent quasigroups 
can be used to show that finite partial quasigroups satisfying 
the identities x2 = x and x(yx) = y can be finitely embedded 
in a quasigroup satisfying these identities [13]. 
This cannot 
be obtained via the methods of either Hilton or Cruse. 
(4) 
These constructions may prove useful in dealing with some of 
the problems listed at the end of this set of notes ••• they 
certainly cannot hurt.

HILTON'S METHOD 
Shortly after the problem of finitely embedding partial idempotent latin 
squares was solved, A. J. W. Hilton [10] gave a different solution. 
Hilton's 
construction is simpler and gives a smaller containing square. 
Hilton's tech-
niques can also be used to embed 
partial commutative latin squares which also 
gives a better bound than the original solution. 
Theorem 8.1. 
(A. J. W. Hilton [10]). 
A partial n x n idempotent latin square can 
be embedded in an idempotent latin square no larger than 4n x 4n. 
Proof. 
Let P be a partial n x n idempotent latin square based on 1,2, •.• ,n. 
By 
Evans' Theorem P can be embedded in a 2n x 2n latin square A based on 1,2, ..• ,2n.

Let I be the 4n x 4n latin square based on 1,2, ..• ,4n defined below. 
Then I is

As always, a lot of technique is involved in the above example. 
Hilton's result 
is the best general result to date on embedding partial idempotent latin squares. 
It is still not the best possible result. 
The best possible general embedding 
theorem would be that a partial idempotent latin square of size n can always be in 
an idempotent latin square of size no larger than 2n + 1. 
We close this section by using Hilton's method to embed 
partial commutative 
latin squares. 
Theorem 8.3. 
A partial n x n commutative latin square can be embedded in a 
commutative latin square no larger than 4n x 4n. 
Proof. 
Let P be a partial n x n commutative latin square based on 1,2, .•• ,n. Let 
T bean x n commutative latin square based on n+l,n+2, ••• ,2n. 
Let T(P) be the 
n x n commutative latin rectangle based on 1,2, .•• ,2n obtained from P by filling in 
the unoccupied cells with the entries in the corresponding cells in T. 
Then T(P) 
is ann x n commutative latin rectangle based on 1,2, .•• ,2n. 
By Ryser's Theorem 
T(P) can be embedded in a 2n x 2n latin square based on 1,2, •.• ,2n. 
Let A be such 
an embedding and partition A as shown in the accompanying diagram. 
T(P) 
A 
Now let M bean x n commutative latin square based on 2n+l,2n+2, ... ,3n and K a 
n x n commutative latin square based on 3n+l,3n+2, •.. ,4n. 
Let N be the 4n x 4n 
commutative latin square based on 1,2, ..• ,4n defined below, where AI, A~, and Aj 
denote the transposes of A1 , A2 , and A3 respectively.

corner. 
Remarks. 
Since the identities xy = yx, x(xy) 
y, and (yx)x = y are conjugate, 
Theorem 8.3 also shows that a partial x(xy) = y ((yx)x = y) quasigroup of order 
n can be embedded in a x(xy) = y ((yx)x = y) quasigroup of order 4n. 
This is still 
not the best possible result along these lines. 
The best possible result would be 
2n and this has recently been obtained by Allan Cruse [2]. 
Section 9 will be de-
voted to Cruse's method of embedding partial commutative and idempotent commutative 
latin squares. 
9. 
CRUSE'S METHOD 
In this final section we give Allan Cruse's constructions for finitely embed-
ding partial commutative and partial idempotent commutative latin squares [2]. 
Cruse's constructions yield the best possible general embeddings for these types 

146 
of latin squares. 
However, Cruse's constructions are technically difficult (much 
more so than Theorem 8.3 and possibly as difficult as Treash's Theorem). 
Cruse's 
embedding theorems follow almost immediately from the following analogue of Ryser's 
Theorem for commutative latin rectangles. 
We will not indicate a proof here. 
Theorem 9.1. 
(A. Cruse [2]). 
Let R be r x r commutative latin rectangle based on 
1,2, •.. ,n. 
Let N(i) denote the number of times that the integer i occurs in R. 
Then R can be embedded in an n x n commutative latin square if and only if 
N(i) > 2r- n for every i = 1,2, ••• ,n and at least r of the N(i) have the same 
parity as n. 
Example 9.2.

5 
3 x 3 commutative latin rectangle 
based on 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. 
In order for R to be embeddable in a 7 x 7 commutative latin square (1) N(i) ~ 
2 • 3 -
7 = -1 for each i, and (2) at least 3 of the N(i) must be odd (have the 
same parity as 7). 
Condition (1) is trivially satisfied but condition (2) is not 
since only N(l) = 3 is odd. 
Hence R cannot be embedded in a 7 x 7 commutative 
latin square. 
If we change the entry in cell (2,2) of R to 6 then the resulting 
3 x 3 commutative latin rectangle R can be embedded in a 7 x 7 commutative latin 
square since condition (1) is still trivially satisfied, but now condition (2) is 
satisfied since N(l) = 3, N(5) = 1, and N(6) = 1 are odd. 
We remark that Cruse's construction involves adding an "edge" at a time to 
the commutative latin rectangle (via the use of SDR's) until it is extended to 
the desired commutative latin square. 
As always, a lot of technique is involved. 
Theorem 9.3. (A. Cruse [2]). 
A partial n x n commutative latin square can be 
embedded in a t x t commutative latin square for every even t ~ 2n. 
Proof. 
The proof is obtained by slightly modifying Evans' proof of the embedd-
ability of partial latin squares which are not necessarily commutative. 
Let P be 
an n x n partial commutative latin square based on 1,2, •.• ,n and let t > 2n be an 

147 
even positive integer. 
Write t 
k + n and let K be a k x k commutative latin 
square based on n+l,n+2, .•• ,n+k 
t. Using K to fill in the unoccupied cells in 
P turns Pinto ann x n commutative latin rectangle P based on 1,2, ••• ,t. Condition 
(1) satisfied since 2n -
t < 0. 
To see that condition (2) is satisfied note that 
tis even and that at least n of 1,2, ••• ,t do not occur on the main diagonal of P 
and so N(i) ts even for these numb~rs. Hence P can be embedded in a t x t com-
mutative latin square by Theorem 9.1. 
Corollary 9.4. 
(A. Cruse [2]). 
A partial n x n idempotent commutative latin 
square can be embedded in an idempotent commutative latin square of size 2n + 1 
(or any larger odd number). 
Proof. 
The proof is completely analogous to the proof of Theorem 9.3 except that 
now K is taken to be an idempotent commutative latin square of size either t - n 
or t- n- 1 (depending on which of these numbers is odd). 
We close this section with an example of the construction used in Theorem 9.3.

P satisfies the conditions of Theorem 9.1 in order to be embedded in an 8 x 8 
commutative latin square. 
As mentioned after the statement of Theorem 9.1 this is 
done by adding an edge at a time via the use of SDR's.

The last latin square on the right M4 is a commutative latin square with P embedded 
in the upper left hand corner. 
Great care must be taken in adding an edge at a time in expanding P to M4 • 
The "right" SDR must be chosen in adding each edge or it may become necessary to 
start over. 
(The use of SDR's in proving Theorem 2.2 involves no such restriction; 
i.e., as soon as a row is completed it is never necessary to undo anything). 
Even-
tually, Theorem 9.1 guarantees that after a finite length of time and a lot of 
effort we can add the necessary edges.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 
In this set of notes I have tried to give a fairly comprehensive survey of 
finite embedding theorems for a certain collection of partial latin squares. 
Quite 
obviously there are embedding theorems not mentioned. 
For example, partial idem-
potent x(yx) = y quasigroups can be finitely embedded [13]. 
However a look at 
the problems in the next section along with the references should give a fairly 
accurate picture of the state of finite embedding theorems for partial latin 
squares and quasigroups. 
Next, I should mention the connection between the finite 
embedding theorems obtained in this paper and universal algebra. 
This is due to 
Trevor Evans. 
If Ik is any one of the eight collections of quasigroup identities 
defined in section 7 then the fact that any partial Ik quasigroup can be embedded 
in a finite Ik quasigroup can be used to show (via [3], [5], [6], and [7]) that the 
finitely presented quasigroups in the quasigroup varieties Ik are residually finite, 
Hopfian, and have a solvable word problem. 
The reader is referred to [12] and [lll] 
for the appropriate details. Finally, I have purposely omitted all but the simplest 
proofs in order not to become bogged down in details and therefore lose sight of the 
main objectives of this set of notes (whatever they are !!). 
This may give the 
impression that much of what has been discussed is really not very difficult. 
An 
even cursory look at the papers on which these notes are based will quickly dispel 
any such ideas. 
We close out these notes with some problems (next section).

PROBLEMS 
(1) 
The Evans' Conjecture remains open [4]. 
(2) 
Give a simple proof of Treash's Theorem (that a finite partial 
Steiner triple system can be embedded in a finite Steiner triple 
system [20]). 

150 
(3) 
Treash's Theorem guarantees that a partial Steiner 
triple system of order n can be embedded in a Steiner 
triple system no larger than z2n [20]. 
Find a smaller 
general embedding theorem. 
The best possible result 
is probably 2k + 1 where k is the snallest positive 
integer greater than or equal to n which is = 1 or 3 
(mod 6). 
(4) 
The best general embedding theorem (to date) for partial 
idempotent latin squares due to A. J. W. Hilton [10] 
guarantees that a partial idempotent latin square of size 
n can be embedded in an idempotent latin square of size 
4n. 
The best possible result would be Zn + 1. 
Can this 
be obtained? 
(5) 
A quasigroup satisfying the identities x(xy) = y and 
(yx)x = y is called totally symmetric. 
If the idempotent 
identity x2 = x is added we have the Steiner identities. 
Although Treash's Theorem guarantees that a finite partial 
Steiner quasigroup can be embedded in a finite Steiner 
quasigroup, things are different if the idempotent identity 
is dropped. 
In fact the problem as to whether a finite 
partial totally symmetric quasigroup can be embedded in a 
finite totally symmetric quasigroup is open [14]. 
This 
problem seems closely related to the other embedding theorems 
surveyed in this set of notes. 
However all attempts by the 
author to gain a solution using the techniques used in this 
paper have failed. 

151 
(6) 
Allan Cruse [2] has shown that a partial n x n commutative 
(idempotent commutative) latin square can be embedded in a 
2n x 2n commutative (2n + l)x(2n + l)idempotent commutative) 
latin square. 
These are the best possible results. 
However 
both are based on Cruse's analogue of Ryser's Theorem [17]. 
A simple construction would be desirable. 
(7) 
In [13] it is shown that a finite partial idempotent x(yx) = y 
quasigroup can be finitely embedded. 
The identities x2 = x 
and x(yx) =yare consequences of the Steiner identities; i.e., 
every quasigroup which satisfies the Steiner identities also 
satisfies the identities x2 = x, x(yx) = y. 
Let I be a collec-
tion of identities (including x2 = x) which are consequences 
of the Steiner identities. Under what conditions can a finite 
partial I quasigroup be embedded in a finite I quasigroup? 
This is probably very hard ••• and is a good place to stop. 
Postscript. 
Since the writing of this paper problem (5) has been solved by 
R. Chaffer, M. Egger, R. St. Andre, and D. Smith. 
In this same paper they also 
show that partial x(yx) = y quasigroups (not necessarily idempotent) can be finitely 
embedded. 
The techniques used in both proofs are based on the construction given 
in Theorem 5.2 in order to embed partial idempotent latin squares.

COMPUTING THE CHARACTERISTIC POLYNOMIAL OF A GRAPH 
Allen J. Schwenk* 
University of Michigan 
ABSTRACT 
How can one actually compute the eigenvalues of a graph? 
In principal, there 
are three methods. 
Namely, (1) 
we can search for 
p 
orthogonal eigenvectors, 
(2) 
we can determine the first 
p 
moments by counting closed walks and then find 
the spectrum from the moments, or (3) 
we can use certain subgraphs to determine the 
coefficients of the characteristic polynomial and then find its roots. 
In practice, however, all of these approaches may prove to be too tedious. 
If 
the spectrum is a natural concept, then we should expect to find simple relations 
between the spectra of related graphs. 
This is indeed the case. 
In Sections 2 and 
3, we present four theorems which are structural results linking the spectrum of a 
graph to the spectra of certain subgraphs. 
Then in Section 4, we find the spectra 
of graphs formed by certain binary operations. 
In the final section, we apply these 
results to obtain the spectra of several known families of graphs: 
complete graphs, 
complete bigraphs, cubes, cycles, wheels, paths, ladders, and mobius ladders.

COMPUTING THE CHARACTERISTIC POLYNOMIAL OF A GRAPH 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
In general, we adhere to the terminology in Harary's book [6] with the following 
additions. 
When we refer to the characteristic polynomial of graph G , written 
p 
<j>(G;x) 
~O a xp-n , we really mean the characteristic polynomial of the adjacency 
n~ 
n 
matrix of 
G • 
For brevity, write 
q,(G;x) ; q,(G) ; q,(x) 
provided the omitted variable 
is obvious from the context. 
The roots of 
q,(G) 
are the eigenvalues of 
G , denoted 
These 
p 
roots (which may include multiple roots) comprise the 
spectrum of 
G 
Two graphs are cospectral if they have the same spectrum. 
We let 
V(G) 
denote the points of 
G • 
In particular, if H is a subgraph of 
G 
then 
G - V(H) is the graph remaining when the points of 
H are removed from 
G 
Many investigators have interpreted some or all of the coefficients of 
<j>(G;x) 
in terms of graphical structure. 
Collatz and Sinogowitz [1] noted that 
a1 
0 , that 
-a2 is the number of lines of 
G , and -a3/2 is the number of triangles in G 
Harary [5] examined the determinant of the adjacency matrix, or in other words, 
ap 
His result is easily generalized to interpret all of the coefficients. 
This has been 
done (Theorem 1) independently by Sachs [9] and Spialter [10]. 
Let 
c(G) and 
k(G) 
be the numbers of cycles and components in G • In a mutation 
graph, each component is either a cycle or K2 ; these graphs were introduced in Harary 
[5]. 
Each permutation with no fixed points can be viewed as a one-to-one mapping taking 
each point of the underlying mutation graph to one of its neighbors. Note that a given 
mutation graph G corresponds to 
zc(G) 
permutations, since each cycle may be mapped 
in either of two directions. 
Finally, let Gn 
be the set of those n-point subgraphs 
of 
G which are mutations. 
Theorem 1. 
For 
n ~ 1, 
an 
(-l)k(M) (Z)c(M) • 
A detailed proof of this theorem is presented in the works of Sachs [9] and 
Spialter [10].

2. 
THE SPECTRUM OF G MINUS A POINT OR A LINE 
Our first two results display respectively the relations between the charac-
teristic polynomial of graph G and the polynomials of r, minus one point and G minus 
one line. 
It is both convenient and consistent to define the characteristic polvnomial 
of the empty graph to be ~(K0 ) = 1. 
Theorem 2. 
Let v be a point of graph G and let~(v) be the collection of cycles 
containing v. 
Then ~(G) satisfies 
(1) 
HG) = x~(G-v) -
E 
~(G-v-u) - 2 E 
~(r,-v(Z)). 
u adj v 
ZE g(v) 
( ) 
p-i 
Proof. 
~ecall that ~ G = Eaix 
, and Theorem 1 expresses ai in terms of the 
i-point mutation subgraphs. 
We now present a one-to-one correspondence between 
those mutations contributing to ai on the left and those contributing to one of the 
terms on the right. 
Namely, letting M be an i-point mutation of G, we have three 
possibilities: 
(A) 
If v t M, let M' be the same mutation, onlv now viewed as a subgraph of 
G- v. 
(B) 
If v E K2 ~M, let M' be M- V(K2) viewed as a suhgraph of G- V(K2). 
(C) 
If v e: Cn(M, let M' be M- V(Cn) viewed as a subgraph of G - V(Cn). 
It is easv to see that this does indeed establish a one-to-one correspondence. 
Moreover, if M contributes an amount m toward the coefficient of xp-i on the left, 
we observe that on the right M' also contributes m in each case as we now demon-
strate: 
(A) 
Since M' = X, we see that M' contributes m to the coefficient of 
in ~(G-v), and thus supplies m toward the coefficient of xp-i in x~(G-v). 
(B) 
In this case M' = M- V(K2), so M' contributes 
(2) 
HG-v-u) 
(-l)k(M')(2)c(M') = -(-l)k(M)(2)c(M) = -m to xp-2-(i-2) 
Hence, it supplies +mxp-i 
to 
-~(G-v-u) . 
p-1-i 
X 

156 
(C) 
Finally, here we have M' = M- V(Cn), so M' contributes 
(3) 
(-l)k(M') (2)c(M')= _ ~ (-l)k(M) (2)c(M) = -m/ 2 to xp-n-(i-n) 
2 
in $(G-V(Cn)) . 
Thus, 
M' contributes +mxp-i in -2$(G-V(Cn)) • 
Thus, the contribution of each mutation M to the left side is matched bv a 
corresponding contribution on the right side by the mutation M' . 
This completes 
the proof of the theorem. 
Let us consider a special case of this theorem when v is an endpoint and 
hence lies on no cycles. 
Then equation (1) becomes Theorem 2 of Harary, King, 
Mowshm-litz, and ll.ead [7]. 
Corollary 2a. 
If v is an endpoint of graph G and u is the point adjacent to v, 
then 
(4) 
$(G)= x$(G-v)- $(G-v-u). 
Another simplification of (1) occurs when v is a cutpoint. 
The coalescence 
of two rooted graphs G,r and H,s, denoted G • H, is the graph formed by identifYing 
the t>m roots. 
Thus, the new root t becomes a cutpoint .i oining G to H. 
Corollary 2h. 
If G and H are two rooted graphs with roots r and s, then the char-
acteristic polynomial of the coalescence G • H is 
(5) 
$(G•H)=$(G)$(H-s)+$(G-r)$(H) - x$(G-r)$(H-s). 
Proof. 
We apply Theorem 2 to G • H with the coalesced point t as the point v to 
get 
(6) 
$(G·H)=x$(G·H-t)-
l: 
$(G•H-t-u)-2 l: 
$(G•H-V(Z)). 
u adj t 
zq~ (t) 
Next we observe that removing t from G • H yields the same graph as the union of 
G -
r and H - s. 
But it is trivial that the characteristic polynomial of the union 
is .iust the product of the component polynomials. 
Thus, we may replace x$(G·H-t) 
bv x$(G-r)$(H-s) in (6). 
Since tis a cutpoint in G · H, each cycle containing t 
is either a cycle of G containing r or a cycle of H containing s. 
Similarly, each 
point adjacent to t is either in G or in H. 
Thus, we may split up the sums in (6) 
according as u (or Z) is in G or H, that is, 

157 
(7) 
~(G'H)=x~(G-r)~(H-s)-
E

u adj s 
-2 
E 
~(G.H-V(Z))-2 
E 
HG·H-V(Z)). 
Ze: e (r) 
Ze:~ (s) 
But now each of the graphs obtained by removing some points from G • H can be re-
written as a union of disjoint graphs so that here too the characteristic polyno-
mial can be replaced by the product of the component polynomials. 
Thus we now have 
(8) 
~(G•H)=x~(G-r)~(H-s)-
E 
~(G-r-u)~(H-s) 
u adj r 
E 
~(G-r)~(H-s-u)-2 E 
~(G-V(Z))~(H-s) 
u adj s 
ze:-e (r) 
-2 
E 
~(G-r)¢(H-V(Z)) 
ze:.£(s) 
Next, we group the first and third sums together and factor out ~(H-s), and semi-
larly, we factor ~(G-r) out of the second and fourth sums to obtain 
(9) 
~ (G·H)=x¢(G-r) ~ (H-s)-¢(H-s)[ E ¢(G-r-u)+2 
E ¢(G-V(Z))] 
u adj r 
Ze:~(r) 
-¢(G-r) [ 
E ¢(H-s-u)+2 
E 
~ (H-V (Z)) ]. 
u adj s 
Z e: (; (s) 
But now the ouantities in brackets can be replaced by applving Theorem 2 just to G 
and just to H respectively, vielding 
(10) 
~(G•H)=x~(G-r)~(H-s)-~(H-s)[x~(G-r)-~(G)] -~(G-r)[x~(H-s)-~(H)], 
which simplifies to equation (5). 
As an example, we apply Theorem 2 to the cvcle Cn to get 
(11) 
~(Cn) = x~(Pn-1) -
2~(Pn-2) -
2 • 
Thus, the characteristic polynomial of the cycle can be found from-the polynomials 
of paths, or conversely, if the polvnomials of the cvcles are known, we may use (11) 
to find the polynomials of the paths recursively. 
On the other hand, applying 
Corollary 2a to the path Pn yields 
(12) 
HPn) '" x¢(Pn-l) - ¢(Pn-2) ' 
which can be used to find the characteristic polynomial of the path directly. 
The path P2n-l can be thought of as the coalescence of two copies of Pn rooted 
at an endpoint, so from Corollary 2b we have 
(13) 

158 
so that 
(14) 
Thus, we conclude that every eigenvalue of Pn-l is also an eigenvalue of Pzn-l' 
This will be evident when we present the spectra of paths later in this paper. 
In 
fact, we observe that Corollary 2b implies that whenever ¢(G-r) = ~(H-s), then 
¢(G-r) divides ¢(G·H). 
Since the dependence of ¢(G'H) upon G involves only ¢(G) and ¢(G-r), we are 
led to define the following concept. 
Two rooted graphs G1 , r 1 and G2, r 2 are 
called cospectrally rooted if, not only are they cospectral as graphs, but also 
¢(G1-r1) = ¢(Gz-r2). 
He now have the following useful result. 
Corollary 2c. 
If G1 and G2 are cospectrally rooted and H is any rooted graph, 
then ¢(G1 · H) 
~(Gz ' H). 
In general, a cospectral pair of connected graphs cannot be used to build a 
cospectral pair of larger connected graphs, but this aorollary aR!!erts that a oospectrally 
rooted pair can be used to build larger cospectral pairs. 
Moreover, if we form the 
successive coalescence of n copies of G1 or G2, the spectrum of the graph formed is 
independent of the number of copies of G1 • 
Thus, this construction can be used to 
provide n+l cospectral connected graphs, because the polynomial with n graphs Gi in 
the coalescence, ¢(G1 • ••• · G1 • G2· .•• ·G2), is independent of the number of 
occurrences of G1 in it. Figure 1 displays the two smallest pairs of cospectrally 
rooted graphs and trees. 
Using these in Corollary 2c, we can construct n+l co-
spectral connected graphs on 
6n + 1 
points, and 
n+l cospectral trees on 
8n + 1 
points.

The next theorem is a similar result relating ~(G) to the characteristic poly-
nomial of G minus one line. 
The method of proof is identical to that of Theorem 2 
and is omitted. 
Theorem 3. 
Let uv be a line of G and let ~(uv) he the set of all cvcles contain-
ing this line. 
The characteristic polynomial of G satisfies 
(15) 
HG) = ~ (G-uv) - HG-u-v) -
2 
l: 
HG-'I(Z)). 
Zc ~ (uv) 
The next result follows directly from Theorem 3. 
Corollarv 2.2a 
Let G, r and H, s he two disjoint rooted graphs. 
The character-
is tic polynomial of the graph formed hy joining the roots with a new line rs is 
(16) 
~(G U H U rs) = ~(G)~(H) -
~(G-r)~(H-s). 
Notice that if G and H are cospectrally rooted, then equation (16) becomes 
(17) 
~(G U H U rs) -
~ 2 (G) -
~2(G-r). 
In particular, this equation is satisfied when G and H are two isomorphic rooted 
graphs. 
~or example, the path P2n can be viewed as the result of joining two 
copies of Pn bv a new line joining corresponding endpoints. 
Thus, by (17) we have 
(18) 
Theorem 3 is closelv related to Theorem 2 as can be seen bv applving Theorem 3 
to the cycle to get 
(lQ) 
This formula can also be obtained by use of equations (11) and (12) which resulted 
from two applications of Theorem 2.

SOME SPECIAL SPECTRA 
The automorphism group of G induces a partition of its points into orbits. 
If 
u and v are in the same orbit, say ei, then certainly for anv orbit ej' point u 
must have as many neighbors in ej as v does. 
Thus, denoting the set of points ad-
jacent to vas N(v), we have 
(2rJ) 
IN(u) U e I= IN(v) U e. I. 
j 
J 
A partition v1uv2 U •.. Uvm of V(G) is equitable if for each i and for all u,v c vi, 
IN(u)()vj I = IN(v)()vj I for all 1· 
The following theorem is implicit within the 
proof of a result of Mowshowitz [8]. 

160 
Theorem 4. 
If v1,v2, ... Vm is an equitable partition of graph G with tij = 
IN(v) n vj I for v 
E: vi, and Tis the matrix (tij), then ~(T) divides ~(G). 
Sketch of Proof. 
For each eigenvector a= (a1 , •.• ,am) of T, we find a correspond-
ing eigenvector 8 of G by setting the vi coordinate of 8 equal to aj v1here vi e: Vj. 
Vector 8 is easily seen to be an eigenvector of the adjacency matrix A of G. 
More-
over, any linear dependence among the vectors so formed must provide an analogous 
dependence among the eigenvectors of T, and so we conclude that the vectors so 
found are linearly independent. 
Thus, 
~(T) divides ~(G). 
As mentioned above, most applications of this theorem use the automorphism 
group to partition the points into the orbits, but in fact other partitions are 
possible and useful, as in the proof of the next corollary. 
For example, the parti-
tion of V(G) into singletons is ahmvs equitable; however, in this case the matrix 
T is trivially seen to be A itself, and the conclusion of the theorem becomes a 
tautology. 
At the other extreme, if G is regular, we may take an equitable parti-
tion with one orbit. 
Then Tis the 1 x 1 matrix (r), so ~(T) = x- r, and the 
theorem asserts that x- r divides ~(G), as is well knoVYn. 
~e now wish to apply this result to find a common formula for the character-
istic polynomials of the coalescence graphs G1 · 
G2 mentioned 
after Corollary 2c. 
Given the rooted graoh G,r, let G * n be the graph formed by 
adding n-1 new points each adjacent to the same points as r. 
Corollary 4a. 
If G1 ,G2, ..• ,Gn are n cospectrally rooted graphs, then 
(21) 
xn-l~(G1 ·G2' .•. • Gn) = ~n- 1 (G1-r 1 )~(G1*n) 
Proof. 
We have already seen that in (21), the graph G1 • G2 • ••• · Gn may be re-
placed by G1 • G1 • 
G1, w·hich we now denote n * G1 • 
(This notation is in-
tentionally similar to G1 * n because these two graphs play rather symmetric roles 
in the discussion that follows. 
It is hoped that no confusion v1ill result.) If G1 
has p points, we define a partition of 
n * G1 with p parts by letting orbit V 1 be 
the coalesced root, and letting each orbit v2 , ••. , V be then copies of point v. 
p 
1 
for each point other than the root in r,1 • 
This is an equitable partition, so we 
proceed to examine the structure of the matrix T of Theorem 4. 
Since each copy of 
G1 inn * G1 has only one point from each orbit, v7e see that the entries of T are 

161 
given by 
{: 
(22) 
if r 1 adj vj in G1 
tlj 
otherwise 
{: 
if r 1 adj v. in Gl 
tjl 
J 
otherwise 
and, for i, j 
> 1, 
~ 
if vi adj v. in Gl 
tij 
J 
otherwise 
Now T provides p eigenvectors ~i for G, each with the property that all points in 
the same orbit have equal coordinates in ai. 
In addition, each eigenvector B of 
G1-r1 provides n-1 eigenvectors Yi of n * G1 by setting yi equal to S on the first 
copy of G1 , and equal to-son the (i+l)'st copy of G1 , and yi = 0 on all other 
copies. 
These vectors yi are orthogonal to the eigenvectors obtained from T be-
cause for each orbit Vj' the coordinates of vector yi are given by +son one point, 
-B on another, and zero on the remaining n-2 points. 
Thus, this procedure provides 
(n-l)(p-1) eigenvectors of n * c1 , which, together with the p eigenvectors ofT 
account for all np- n + 1 eigenvectors of n * G1 • 
Thus, 
n-1 
(23) 
~ (n * G1) = ~ 
(G 1-r 1 )~ (T). 
Now what about ~(G1 * n), the graph formed by replacing the root by n identi-
cal points? 
We define an equitable partition having these n points in v1, and the 
remaining orbits are singletons. 
Letting S be the corresponding matrix for this 
partition, we find that Sis precisely T', the transpose ofT. 
(This is the rela-
tion between c1 *nand n * c1 • 
Namely, since S = T', we have~ (S) 
~ (T) and so 
c1 * n and n * c1 have p common eigenvalues, the eigenvalues of T.) 
Thus, we know 
p eigenvalues of c1 * n, so we proceed to find the remaining n-1 eigenvalues. 
These are all O, as can be seen by setting the coordinate o.f one point in v1 to be 
+1, of one of the n-1 remaining points to be -1, and setting all other coordinates 
to be 0. 
This procedure constructs the n-1 linearly independent eigenvectors with 
eigenvalue 0. 
Consequently, 
(24) 
~(G1 * n) = xn-l ~(T), 
so we may substitute for ~(T) in (23) to get

pleting the proof of the corollary. 
Consider the tree Yn = Pn-l * 2 where the path was planted, as shown in Figure

The first four structural theorems are sufficiently general to be applied to 
any graph, however, the results may not be simple enough to be efficient. 
The next 
three theorems only apply to graphs with very specific structure, but when they do 
apply, they provide exceedingly useful results. 
The first of these results uses the 
unique homogeneous polynomial of degree p in two variables ~(G;x,y) such that 
~(G;x,l) = 
~(G;x). 
Of course each term of this new polynomial is obtained from the 
P-n 
p-n n 
term anx 
in ~(G;x) by replacing it by anx 
y . 
Theorem 5. 
Let G0 be a given p-point graph and let H,r be a rooted n-point graph. 
Let G be the graph formed by coalescing one copy of H at each point of G0 • 
Then 

163 
(29) 
~(G)= ~(G0 ; 
~(H), ~(H-r) , 
Proof. 
The left side of (29) can be written as E a xPn-m since G has pn points. 
m 
Now by Theorem 1, we have 
(30) 
a m 
E (-l)k(M)(2)c(M) • 
M G 
e: m 
For each m-point mutation M contributing to am, we shall find a corresponding con-
tribution to the coefficient of xpn-m on the right side of (29). 
To do this, we 
first write ~(G0 ) = ~:bixp-i, so that 
(31) 
Now each component of mutation M of G either lies in one of the p copies of H or 
else it lies in G0 • 
Thus, we may partition M in a natural way into p+l mutations 
M • M0UM1 U ... UMP where M0 is a mutation of G0 , and each remaining Mi is a 
mutation of the i'th copy of H. 
We let ki and ci be the numbers of components and 
of cycles in Mi. 
Then clearly k(M) • Eki and c(M) 
Now let v , ... ,v be the 
1 
p 
points of G0 • 
If vi e: M0 , then certainly vi ¢ Mi, and so, whenever vi e: M0 , we 
choose to view M. not as a mutation of H, but rather as a mutation of H-r. 
Now 
J._ 
k 
c 
M0 
contributes 
(-1) 0 (2) 0

and if vi e: M0

(2) 1 x 
to the corresponding factor of ¢(H-r), and finally, if vi iM0 , 
then Mi contributes (-l)ki(2)cixn-IMil to the appropriate factor of ~(H). Thus, 
the contribution of theM. 's to the right side is the product of these individual 
J._ 
terms which is 
(32) 
But this is identical to the contribution of M to the left side as seen from equa-
tion (30). 
Moreover, M and the partition M U M1 U ... U M clearly form a one-to-
o 
p 
one correspondence between mutations of G and ordered (p+l)-tuples of mutations of 
G0 and of p copies of H. 
On invoking this equality of contributions for every 
mutation, (29) is verified. 
Notice that if we apply this theorem with H 
(29) asserts

x, and we have previously defined ~(K0 ) 
1 just before Theorem 2. 
Thus 
which agrees as it must with the definition of ~. and so we have further evidence 
that our choice for ~(K0 ) was correct. 
Since the graph G is formed by p coalescences, we may replace each copy of H in 
light of Corollary 2c by a cospectrally rooted graph H' and still have the same 
spectrum. 
Thus we have proved the next statement. 
Corollary Sa. 
Let G0 be a given p-point graph and let Hi,ri be a collection of p 
mutually cospectrally rooted graphs. 
Let G be the graph formed by coalescing Hi at 
vi for each point vi of G0 • 
Then 
This corollary is very useful for constructing large collections of cospectral 
graphs. 
For example, if H1 ,r1 and H2,r2 are two cospectrally rooted graphs, then 
all of the zP graphs formed by coalescing either H1 or H2 at each point of G0 are 
cospectral. 
Of course, some of these may be isomorphic, but we can prevent that 
from happening by selecting G0 to be an identity graph. 
It is easy to see that if 
two of the graphs so formed are isomorphic, then this isomorphism restricted to G0 
is a nontrivial automorphism, contrary to the stipulation that G0 is an identity 
graph. 
Thus, using the cospectrally rooted pairs of Figure 1, we can construct 2n 
cospectral connected graphs on 7n points for each n ~ 6. 
Similarly, we construct zn 
cospectral trees on 9n points for each n ~ 7 since there exists an identity tree for 
each n ~ 7. 
4. 
SPECTRA OF GRAPHS FORMED BY BINARY OPERATIONS 
Several well known binary operations on graphs provide valuable information for 
analyzing graphical structure. 
(See Harary [6, pp. 21-23]). 
We wish to express the 
characteristic polynomial of the graph formed by a binary operation in terms of the 
polynomials of the two constituent graphs. 
In some cases, we only achieve this goal 
when some regularity assumptions are made about these two graphs. 
Let G and H be graphs with point sets V(G) = {u1 ,u2, ••. } and V(H) = {v1 ,v2 ••• } 
and line sets X(G) and X(H). 
The union of G and His defined as usual by 

165 
(36) 
V(G U H) 
z V(G) U V(H) 
X(G U H) 
X(G) U X(H). 
Assuming V(G) n V(H) = ~. the adjacency matrix of G U H has two diagonal blocks 
while the off diagonal blocks are zero. 
Thus, we see that 
(37) 
~(G U H) = ~(G)~(H) if V(G) n V(H) = ~· 
The union is seldom used to describe the structure when G and H have points in 
common, so equation (37) is adequate. 
In four common binary operations having V(G) x V(H) as the point set, adjacency 
is defined by 
Operation 
_Symbol 
(u1 ,v1)adj(u2 ,v2) if: 
Cartesian Product 
G x H 
ul=u2 and v1 adj v2 
or v1 =v2 and ul adj u2 
Conjunction 
G/\H 
u1adj u2 and Vl adj v2 
Strong product 
G * H 
d(u1 ,u2) .:: 1 and 
d(v1 ,v2) :s: 1 
Composition 
G[H] 
u1 adj u2 or 
ul=u2 and vl adj v2 
The symbol for the strong product was chosen because 
(38) 
G * H = (G X H) U (G A H) . 
Note that composition is the only "nonabelian" operation here, that is, in general 
(39) 
G[H] r H[G]. 
The next theorem extends a result of Cvetkovi~ [2]. 
Theorem 6. 
Let ~(G) = IT(x-Ai) and ~(H) = IT(x-~j). 
The characteristic polynomials 
of the cartesian product, conjunction, and strong product are 
(40)

~ ) 
~

Ai ~j) 
Ai~j - Ai-
~j). 
Proof. 
The method of proof is identical for all three equations, and so we shall 
just present the proof of (42). 
Let p = lv(G) I and s = IV(H) I, and let a= (a1 ,a2 , 
.•. ,ap) and S = (b1 ,b2, ... ,bs) be eigenvectors of G and H with eigenvalues A and~· 

166 
Let~ x S be the vector of length ps whose (ui,vj) coordinate is aibj. 
We show that 
~ x S is an eigenvector of G * H with eigenvalue ~P + ~ + P, 
Let us find the 
(u1,v1) coordinate of the action of~ x Son A, the adjacency matrix of G *H. This 
coordinate has the value 
(43) 
where the sum is over all (i,j) such that (ui,vj)adj (u1,vl), But, in light of the 
definition of adjacency in the strong product, s11 can be decomposed into three 
sums: 
(44) 
Factoring each sum yields 
(45) 
Now since a is an eigenvector of G, Lai = Aa1 , and similarly Lbj = pb1 , so we see 
that 
(46) 
s11 = Aa1pb1+b1Aal+a1pbl = (AP+A+p)a1b1 . 
Applying this argument, given here for (u1 ,v1), on an arbitrary coordinate (ui.'vj) 
Thus ~ x S is an eigenvector of G*H with eigen-
value AP + A + p. 
Since this argument applies to anv pair of eigenvectors ~i and 
S., we have found pS eigenvectors of G *H. If they are linearly independent, we 
J 
are through; but, in fact, if the ~i's have been chosen to be orthogonal, and 
similarlv for the Sj's, then these constructed eigenvectors are also orthogonal 
which, of course, implies linear independence. 
To see this let ~i xsj and ~k X al 
be two eigenvectors of G *H. Let ~i(m) denote the m'th coordinate of ~i' Then 
(47) 
<~ixSj)·(~kxSl) = L L~i(m)Sj(n)~k(m)Sl(n) 
mn 
the last two factors being scalar products. 
Now either i ~ k so that ~i • ~k = 0, 
or j 
~ l and sj • sl = o. 
In either case, we have shown that ~i X sj and ~k X 
aP. 
are orthogonal, completing the oroof of (42). 

167 
This theorem provides another useful tool for constructing cospectral graphs, 
for if G1 ,G2 and H1,H2 are two cospectral pairs, then certainly G1 x H1 and G2 x H2 
are also cospectral. 
Similarly their conjunctions and strong products are cospec-
tral. 
For example, to prove that there exist cospectral n-connected graphs, let 
G1 and G2 be any connected cospectral pair. 
Then G1 x Kn and G2 x Kn are cospec-
tral and n-connected. 
The join of two graphs G +His the graph formed by joiningeveryPoint of G to 
everv point of H. 
Or, using complementation,we may write, following Zykov [11], 
(48) 
G + H = GUH. 
The join and the composition may be viewed as special cases of a more general 
operation which we call "generalized composition". 
If G is labeled and hasp 
points, then the graph G[H1,H2, ... ,Hp] is formed by taking the disjoint graphs 
H1,H2, ... ,Hp and then joining every point of Hi to every point of Hj whenever ui 
adj uj in G. 
Thus the ordinary composition is just 
(49) 
G[H] = G[H,H, ..• ,H], 
and the join is given by 
(50) 
G + H = K2[G,H]. 
In general, it does not appear likely that the characteristic polynomial of the 
generalized composition can always be expressed in terms of the polynomials of 
G,Hl,H2, ••• ,Hp' but if all the Hi's are regular we have the following result. 
Theorem 7. 
equitable partition of G[H1 ,H2 , ••• ,~]. LetT denote the matrix associated with 
this partition. 
Then the characteristic polynomial of the generalized composition 
is 
(51) 
~(G[H 1 ,H2 , ... ,Hp]) = ~(T) IT~(Hi)/(x- ri) • 
Proof. 
The partition chosen is clearly equitable, for v 8 V(Hi) is adjacent to 
either all or none of the points in V(Hj) according as ui is or is not adjacent to 
uj in G. 
By Theorem 4, 
~(T) divides ~(G[H1 ,H2 , .•• ,Hp]) and each eigenvector is 
constant on each set V(Hi). 
The largest eigenvector of each Hi is (1,1, ... ,1). 
Each of the remaining pi-1 
eigenvectors of Hi is orthogonal to this vector, so its coordinates sum 
to zero. 

168 
Consequently, it is easily seen to yield an eigenvector of G[H ,H , •.. ,H] if we 
1 
2 
p 
set all the other coordinates to be zero. 
p 
l: (pi-1) 
i=l 
This provides 
p 
( l: Pi) - P 
i=l 
eigenvectors which, together with the p eigenvectors of T, will form a complete 
set of eigenvectors unless they are linearly dependent. 
But, since each pair is 
orthogonal, they are in fact linearly independent. 
We divide ~(Hi) by (x- ri) to 
remove the factor corresponding to eigenvector 
(1,1, ..• ,1). Multiplying by ~(T) 
completes the proof. 
For convenience, we specialize this result to the ordinary composition and to 
the join, 
Corollary 7a. 
If H is regular of degree r with s points and G has p points, then 
(52) 
HG[H]) = sP ~(G;~) [HH)/ (x - r) ]p. 
s 
Proof. 
According to Theorem 7, we have an equitable partition of the ps points of 
G[H] into p parts, each of size s. 
Consequently, the matrix T has r's on the diag-
onal, and entries s exactly where A(G) has l's, that is, 
(53) 
But then, 
(54) 
T = sA(G) + ri. 
HT) 
det((x-r)I -
sA(G)) 
sP det((x-r)I - A(G)) 
s 
sp ~(G;~). 
s 
Thus, Theorem 7 implies formula (52). 
Corollary 7b. 
If H1 and H2 are regular graphs of degrees r 1 and r 2 and with p1 
and p2 points, then the characteristic polynomial of their join is 
2 
~WJ~W0 
(55) 
~(Hl+H2)=(x -(rl+r2)x+rlr2-plp2) (x-rl) (x-r2) 
Proof. 
According to equation (SO), we need to evaluate ~(K2 [H 1 ,H 2 J). 
Applying 
Theorem 7, we obtain the matrix 
(56) 
whose characteristic polynomial is 
(57) 

169 
which, together with equation (51) implies (55). 
5. 
THE SPECTRA OF EIGHT WELL-KNOWN FAMILIES OF GRAPHS 
Let us now apply the structural results of this paper to obtain the spectra of 
various common families of graphs. 
Most of these spectra have been presented before 
(see Collatz and Sinogowitz [1], Cvetkovic [3], Doob [4], and Harary, King, 
Mowshowitz, and Read [7], but we derive them here to demonstrate the usefulness of 
these structural theorems. 
The spectra of wheels, ladders, and mobius ladders are 
believed to be new. 
The characteristic polynomial of the complete graph is 
(58) 
¢(Kp) = (x- p + l)(x + l)P-1. 
To demonstrate this, we first note that ¢(K1) = x satisfies (58), and we proceed by 
induction. 
Assume (58) has been verified for all integers less than p. 
Let us write 
write Kp = Kn + K 
for n in the range 1 ~ n ~ p - 1. 
We now apply Corollary 7b 
p-n 
with r 1 = n-1, p1 
(59) 
= n, rz = p-n-1, Pz = p-n to obtain 
¢(K +K 
)=(x2-Cp-2)x+l-p)(x+l)n-l(x+l)p-n-l 
n 
p-n 
=(x-p+l)(x+l)(x+l)P-2, 
and so we have proved (58) by induction. 
Similarly, since ¢(Kp) 
xP and K m,n 
Km + Kn' we may apply Corollary 7b with r 1 = r 2 = 0 and p1 = m, Pz = n to obtain 
(60) 
¢(K 
) = (x2 - mn)xm+n-2. 
m,n 
The cubes constitute the next family of interest. 
They can be defined indue-
x K . 
We claim that 
-r/ (x -
n + zJi) . 
i=O 
When n = 1, equation (61) reduces to ¢(K2) = (x-l)(x+l) which agrees with (58). 
Assuming this formula has been demonstrated for n-1 and applying equation (40) of 
Theorem 6, 
(62) 
we see that n-l

(n-l) 
¢(Q _1 xK2 )=~(x-n+l+2i+l) \ 1 } (x-n+l+2i-l)

i=O 
which reduces to equation (61). 

170 
We shall now find the spectrum of the cycle Cn = v1v2 ••• vnvl by an entirely 
different approach, namely, we shall specify n linearly independent eigenvectors. 
Let e: = e:(j) be 0 if j 
< n/ 2 and 1 if j :? n/ 2. 
Set the vi coordinate of eigenvec-
tor aj denoted by aj(vi) to b~ cos 271j(i- e:(j))/n. 
(This is the method of pulling 
the solution out of the hat and then verifying it.) Using a trigonometric identity 
we see that the vi coordinate of the adjacency matrix A(Cn) acting on aj is 
(63) 
cos 2 7lj (i+l- e:) /n+ cos 2 7lj (i-1- e:) /n 
2 cos 2TrJ /n cos 2 7lj (i- e:) /n 
2 cos 211j/n 
aj(vi). 
Since this holds for each coordinate vi' we have shown that aj is indeed an eigen-
vector whose eigenvalue is 2 cos 21Tj/n. 
The only possible linear dependence can 
occur among vectors with the same eigenvalue. 
But the only time 
2 cos 21Tj/n = 2 cos 21Tk/n for 1 ~ j < k s n is when k = n- j. Thus, the only 
possible linear dependence is of the form aaj + ban-j = 0. 
Without loss of general-
ality, we assume a = 1, so that 
(64) 
and 
(65) 
aj 
aj = b2a n-j 
~-j· 
Now j < k =n - j implies that e:(j) = 0 and e:(n-j) 
1. 
Consequently, the vi 
coordinate of an-j is 
(66) 
cos 21T(n-j)(i-l)/n 
cos 21Tj (i-1) /n 
aj (v i-1). 
That is, an-j is just aj rotated 211/n radians. Therefore aj · aj = ~-j · an-j' 
so (65) implies that b = +1. 
We now see that the v 
coordinate of equation (64) 
n 
becomes 
(67) 
cos 21Tj =+cos 21T(n-j)(n-l)/n 
1 =±cos 21Tj/n. 
But this is impossible for 1 ~ j < n/2, so we conclude there is no linear depend-
ence among the n eigenvectors constructed. 
Thus, 
(68) 
n 
~(Cn) = r-f (x- 2 cos 21Tj/n). 
j=l 

171 
Since the wheel is defined as W

K1 + Cn-l' we apply Corollary 7b to con-
elude that

Now consider

we con-
Thus ~(Pn) divides ~(c 2n+Z). ButPn has diameter n-1, and so, as observed in Doob 
[4), its n eigenvalues must be distinct. 
Thus, the spectrum of Pn consists of n 
of the n+2 distinct eigenvalues of C 2n+2 
Now CZn+2 has two simple eigenvalues 
(namely ±2) and n paired eigenvalues (2 cos 211j/(2n+2) for 1 ~ j ~ n). 
But +2 and 
-2 cannot possibly be eigenvalues of the path because either of these values leads 
to a contradiction in the last coordinate when we try to form an eigenvector. 
consequently,

The ladder is defined as Pn x K2 •

We conclude this paper by finding the spectra of mBbius ladders, defined as 
follows: 
M2n is obtained from c2n = v1v2 ... v2nvl by adding then additional 
lines vivi+n' and M2n+l is c2n+l with the 2n+l additional lines vivi+n" 
We define 
eigenvectors aj just as we did for the cycles c 2n and c2n+l' only now we find that 
the eigenvector aj of miibius ladder M2n has the eigenvalue 
(73) 
and so 
2 cos 11j/n + cos 11j 
(-l)j + 2 cos 11j/n,

Similarly, the eigenvector aj 
of the mBbius ladder M 
has the eigenvalue

(75) 
2 cos 2rrj/(2n+l) + 2 cos 2rrjn/(2n+l) 
4 cos rrj(n+l)/(2n+l)cos rrj(n-l)/(2n+l) 
Thus, its spectrum is

ABSTRACT 
A subset H of the vertices of a graph is independent if no two vertices 
in H are adjacent. 
The ErdBs-Vizing Problem suggests that a planar graph has 
an independent set of vertices that contains at least 1/4 of the vertices of 
the graph. 
The purpose of this paper is to give an algorithm that produces 
an independent set in a planar graph that contains more than 2/9 of the vertices 
of the graph.

FINDING AN INDEPENDENT SET IN A PLANAR GRAPH 
A subset H of the vertices of a graph G is independent if no two vertices in 
H are adjacent. 
The Four Color Conjecture implies the Erdos-Vizing Problem, namely 
that it is possible' to find an independent set of the vertices of a planar graph that 
contains at least 1/4 of the vertices of the graph. 
The purpose of this paper is to 
give an explicit algorithm for finding an independent set of vertices in a planar graph 
which contains more than 2/9 of the vertices of the graph. 
We do not contend that the 
algorithm is a good one, merely that it works. 
We assume G is a triangulation. 
If not, introducing edges to make it so cannot 
make the task easier. The strategy of the algorithm will be to reduce the question of finding 
an independent set in G to that ot finding an independent set in G', a graph on fewer 
vertices. 
Suppose G has N vertices and 
G' has N-q vertices. 
Suppose 
H' is independent in G' with 
IH' I > %<N-q) 
If there exists H independent in G with 
IH' I + p 
and 
then H will be a required independent set, namely 
If we reduce the number of vertices in G enough, there will be an obvious four-
coloring of G. 
Taking the vertices that have the most frequently used color enables 
one to build an independent set of the appropriate size. 
The algorithm consists of a 
sequence of reductions. 
Every time a new triangulation appears, begin with Step 1. 
If Step 1 is impossible, go on to Step 2, etc. 
Step 1. 
Look for a vertex of degree 3. 
Suppose 
v1 is a vertex of degree 3 with neigh-
bors 
and 
Let 
If H' 
is independent in G' 

175 
then H' + v1 will be independent in G. 
Step 2. 
Look for a vertex of degree 4. 
Suppose v1 is a vertex of degree 4 with 
neighbors v2 , ••• , v5 . 
Since G is planar,some pair of v2 , •.. , v5 
(say v2 and 
v4) are not adjacent. 
Let G' 
be G-v1- v3 - v4 - v5 with v2 adjacent to all ver-
tices in G that are in G' 
and are adjacent to v3 , v4 , or v5 . 
Suppose H' is 
independent in G' 
If 
is not in H' 
then H' + vl is independent in G. 
If 
v2 is in H' , then H' + v4 is independent in G. 
Step 3. 
Look for a 3-cycle that is not a face boundary. Suppose v 1' v 2, v 3 is a 3-cycle 
with N1 interior vertices and N.z exterior vertices. Assume 
N1 :: j (mod 9) and N2 : k 
(mod 9). 
We consider the ordered pairs (j,k) as separate cases. 
Luckily only three 
techniques suffice to reduce every case. 
Assume 
j ~ k • 
Case a. The ordered pair (j, k) is not (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (7,4), (8,3), (8,4), 
(6,7), or (8,8). 
Let 
G1 be the induced subgraph on the vertices interior to v1 , 
v2 , v3 
and 
G2 
be the induced subgraph on the vertices exterior to v1 , v2 , v3 • 
For 
i 
1,2 we can find 
independent in 
with 
H = H1 + H2 will be independent in G. 
Subcase 1. 
0 ~ k ~ j ~ 4. 
Since ia1 1 is an integer greater than 
2N1/9 , we have 
Similarly, 
Therefore 
If j+k ~ 5

Thus 

176 
As above we have,

Similarly, 
I H21 > l N + 9-2k

Therefore 
If j+k ~ 10 we have I HI > i N 
Subcase 3. 
5 ~ k ~ j < 8 . 
As above we have, 
Similarly, 
Therefore

If j+k ~ 14 we have 
Case b. 
The ordered pair (j,k) is one of (4,3), (4,4), (7,4), (8,3), (8,4), 
(8,7), or (8,8). 
Let 
G3 
be G1 
together with a vertex u adjacent to all vertices 
in G3 
that are adjacent to v1 , v2 , v3 
in G. 
Let 
G4 
be 
G2 
together with 
v1 , v2 , v3 
and all induced edges. 
For i = 3,4, 
we can find Hi 
independent in 
Gi with IHil > t !Gil • If u is in H3 
then H = H3 + H4 - u is independent in 
G . 
Now let u be not in H3 . 
At most one of 
in H4 
then H = H3 + H4 - vi is independent in G . 
In either case 
!HI 
H4 - vi is independent in G . 
In either case 
!HI = IH3 1 + IH4 1 - 1 
Subcase 1.

We know

Similarly 
Therefore

As above 
IH31 > 1_ (N1 + 1) + 8/9

IH41 ~ ~ (N2 + 3) 
Thus 
IHI >l (N1 + N2 + 3) +l+ 8/9 - 1 >1_N

The same construction with the roles of j and k reversed takes care of the pair 
(7,4). 
Case c. 
Suppose N1 = N2 = 3 (mod 9). 
For 1 ~ p < q ~ 3 let Gpq 
be 
G4 
in the previous case with vertices vp 
and vq identified. 
For 
1 ~ p < q ~3 
let Epq 
be G1 
together with v1 , v2 , v3 
and their induced edges with vertices 
vp 
and vq identified. 
Denote this new vertex by vpq . 
For 1 ~ p < q ~ 3 
we can 
find 
Fpq 
independent in 
~q with

Similarly we can find 
~q independent in Gpq

From Fpq

Hpq 
we will find H indpendent in G with 
Consider G12 and 
E12 · 
If 
or v3 
is not in H12 
suppose v12 is in F12 
H = H12 + F12 - v12 will be independent in G of the appropriate size. 
Thus we may 
assume one of 
or 
appears in H12 
and F12 
!f the same vertex appears in 
both, then H = H12 + F12 will be independ~nt where v12 
goes to either v1 or 
Thus we may assume v12 is in E12 
and 
is in

Look for a pair of triangles v1 , v2 , v3 and v2 , v3 , v4 with

uration is shown in Figure 1. 
There cannot exist edges v5 v7 
or 
since these would form 3-cycles. It also must be the case that

since if 
for some j, 
then v5 , v2, 
v4 is a 3-cycle, which is not a face boundary. 
Similarly v7 must be distinct 
from v8 , .,.; vll . 
Also vg and vll (or v10 if deg v4 = 5) are distinct 
from

We have given an algorithm to construct an independent set of the vertices of a 
triangulation. It is not obvious why every triangulation must satisfy the condition 
of one of the steps. It is shown in [1] that the conditions of steps 1, 2 or 4 are 
required to be in a triangulation, i.e., every triangulation contains a vertex of 

179 
degree less than five or the configuration in Figure 1. 
This is analogous to a 
result of Kotzig on Eulerian polyhedra 14], 
It seems possible that an algorithm exists to arrive at an independent setH with 
IHI/N > 2/9. 
One suspects for 
IHI/N close to 1/4 the task would be difficult, since 
almost no progress has been made on the Erdtis-Vizing problem.

A CLASS OF STARTER INDUCED I-FACTORIZATIONS 
B. A. Anderson 
Arizona State University 
ABSTRACT 
A technique of Mullin and Nemeth for constructing strong starters in 
certain Abelian groups of prime power order is considered. 
These strong 
starters induce !-factorizations of complete graphs. It is easy to show that 
these !-factorizations possess enough symmetry to insure that if {Fi,Fj} and 
{Fk,Fm} are pairs of distinct 1-factors from such a· !-factorization, then the 
cycle structures of F i U F j and Fk U Fm are identical. 
The method is applied 
to construct what is apparently the first example of a !-factorization of the 
complete graph on 28 points, Kzg , such that the union of every two distinct 
1-factors is a Hamiltonian circuit. 
This problem, generalized to Kzn• has arisen 
in several contexts and the above result strengthens the conjecture of various 
authors that such !-factorizations exist on all Kzn • The first unsettled case 
is now K36.

A CLASS OF STARTER INDUCED !-FACTORIZATIONS 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
Suppose Kzn denotes the complete graph on 2n points and let F be a !-factori-
zation of it. Call F perfect iff whenever Fi and Fj are distinct !-factors of 
F, FiLJ Fj is a Hamiltonian circuit. 
For background on the currently available 
methods of constructing perfect !-factorizations, see [1], [4], [6], [7] and 
especially [ 3] • 
The purpose of this note is to outline a process for constructing !-factori-
zations that might be refined to yield a construction of perfect !-factorizations 
on an infinite class of complete graphs, many of which are, at present, not known 
to possess perfect !-factorizations. 
The method has so far been applied to find 
new solutions for several already settled cases and the first solution on K28 
It will become apparent that many interesting questions concerning the 
construction to be presented are not considered. 
This article contains the ma-
terial presented at the conference and should be considered as only a preliminary 
report on the method. 
It is planned to discuss the matter more fully at a later 
time. 
Several concepts and results will be introduced to clarify the terminology 
used in the theorems. 
Definition 1.1. 
Suppose t is a positive integer, r = 2t + 1 and G is an Abelian 
group of order r written additively. Then S is a starter in G iff 
S = {{xl,yl}, ••• ,{xt,Yt}} 
such that every non-zero element of G occurs as 
(i) 
an element of some pair of S 
and 
(ii) 
a difference of some pair of S. 
If, in addition 
(iii) 
(iv) 
1 < i < t 
implies xi+ yi I 0, 
1 ~ i, j ~ t, i I j 
implies xi + Yi I xj + Yj , 
S is said to be a strong starter. 

182 
Consult [5], [9] for information on strong starters. Starters induce 1-factor-
izations in a very nice way. 
Suppose G is an Abelian group of order r = 2t + 1 
and S is a starter in G. 
Label the points of ~+l by ® and the elements of G. 
If 
g e: G, define ® + g = g + ® = ® 
Let S* = S U {®,0}. 
Clearly S* is a 1-factor 
of ~+l • The 1-factorization F induced by S is then the family of translates of 
S* by elements of G. 
That is, if ge:G 
S* + g = {®,g}l){{xi + g, Yi + g}: 
1 < i .s_t}. 
Hence 
F 
{S*+g: ge:G}. 
It is easy to show [9, p. 46] that F is a 1-factorization of Kr+l. 
One can use 
the notation (G,S) +F. 
The following result is the basis of the construction. 
Theorem 1.2. 
(Mullin-Nemeth (8]) 
Suppose p is a prime and m is a positive integer 
such that 3 < pm = 3(mod 4). 
Thus 
pm = 2t + 1, todd. Let x be primitive in 
GF[pm] and define 
Then S(x) is a strong starter for the additive group of GF[pm] • We will use the 
notation F(x) to denote the 1-factorization induced by S(x). 
Now, let s2n be the symmetric group on the vertices of K2n • Clearly if 
11 e: s2n , then 11 induces a permutation on the family of all 1-factors of K2n • 
Definition 1.3. 
Suppose G is a 1-factorization of K2n. 
Then FS(G) = {1!: 11e: s2n 
and 11[G] = G}. 
If 11e: FS(G), then 11 induces a permutation p on the 1-factors of G. 
Sym(G) = {p: some 11 in FS(G) induces p} 
It turns out that for perfect 1-factorizations, FS(G) and Sym(G) are isomorphic 
groups. 
See [2] for information on this. 
Definition 1.4. 
A 1-factorization F of K2n is semi-regular iff for any 
Fio Fj, Fk, Fm 
in F such that i -1 j, k -1 m, the cycle structures of Fi U Fj 
and 
Fkl) Fm are identical. 
That is, if (i,j,n) is the number of cycles of length n in 
Fil)Fj, then for every positive integer n, (i,j,n) = (k,m,n). 

183 
2. 
SEMI-REGULAR !-FACTORIZATIONS 
We can now state the main result. 
Theorem 2.1. 
Suppose p is a prime and m is a positive integer such that 
3 < pm: 3(mod 4). If x is primitive in GF[pm] , then 
(i) F(x) is a semi-regular !-factorization of 
K2n, 2n = pm + 1; 
and 
(ii) 
Sym(F(x)) is transitive and of order at least pm(pm - 1)/2. 
Proof. 
As before, 
pm = 2t + 1, t odd. 
We make the following definition. 
l:S(x) 
Now x2i + x2i+l = x2i(l + x). If 1 + x = x2j , 1 .::_ j .::_ t - 1 , then it is easy 
to show that l:S(x) is a multiplicative subgroup M of 
GF[pm]. 
If, on the other 
hand, 1 + x = x2j+l, 1 .::_ j 
.::_ t - 1, then l:S(x-1) is a multiplicative subgroup. We 
will assume the labeling is such that 
l:S(x) = M. 
Note that IMI = (pm - 1)/2. 
The subgroup M has an important property. If me: M, then -m i M. 
Supposition 
of the contrary leads to the equation x2i + x2j = 0. 
One may now follow the 
argument of [8, Lemma 1] to obtain a contradiction. 
Here is where use is made of 
the fact that t is odd. 
As before, let S*(x) = S(x) U {oo,O}. 
It is clear that if g e: GF[pm] and 
{ 
y + g , y e: GF [ pm] 
Tg(y) 
= 
oo, y = 00 ' 
then Tg[S*(x) + y] 
g e: GF[pm] - {0} and 
S*(x) + (y +g). Thus 
Sym(F(x)) is transitive. 
Suppose 
It is easy to show the following facts. 
and 
(1) If g ¢ M, then crg[F(x)] 
(2) If ge:M, then crg[F(x)] 
F(x), 
and 
crg[S*(x)] = S*(x). 
Thus, if ge:M, 
crg e: FS(F(x)). Each such crg induces an element of Sym(F(x)). 
We 
will abuse the notation slightly and say that if g e: M, then 
crg e: Sym0 (F(x)). It 
is obvious that different elements of M give rise to different members of Sym0 (F(x)). 

184 
We have, therefore, verified (ii) of the theorem. 
The permutations known to be in Sym(F(x)) make it easy to see that F(x) is a 
semi-regular !-factorization. Let m be a generator of the cyclic group M. 
We claim 
that the cycle structure of 
S*(x) U [S*(x) + m] 
is the same as the cycle structure of the union of any two distinct 1-factors of 
F(x), say 
[S*(x) + g] U [S*(x) + h] • 
Since g 1- h, we know that either (g - h) e: M or else (h - g) e:· M. 
We may now suppose 
that (g - h) e: M. 
The permutation -r_h shows that the cycle structure of 
[S*(x) + g] U [S*(x) + h] 
is identical to the cycle structure of 
[S*(x) + (g- h)] U S*(x) 
Since (g - h) e: M, there is a positive integer k such that mk = (g - h). Let r be 
mk-1, 
Then r e: M and the permutation or shows that the cycle structure of 
[S*(x) + (g- h)] U S*(x) 
is identical to the cycle structure of 
[S*(x) + m] U S*(x) 
This completes the proof of the theorem. 
We conclude by applying the above method to find some perfect !-factorizations. 
First, we construct one on K28 . It may be verified that x3 + 2x2 + 1 is an irredu-
cible polynomial over GF[3], and that xis primitive in the resulting GF[27]. 
F(x) 
is perfect. 
Note that by Theorem 2.1, this assertion may be checked by hand since 
all one has to do is show that S*(x) U [S*(x) + g] , g 1- 0, is a Hamiltonian 
circuit. 
The method can be applied to twelve primes < 100. It turns out that in nine 
of these cases, the process described above yields perfect !-factorizations. In 
the following table the first row gives the prime p and the second row a primitive 
root pr of GF[p] that induces a perfect 1-factorization on Kp+l·

CHROMATICALLY EQUIVALENT GRAPHS 
Ruth A. Bari 
George Washington University 
ABSTRACT 
Let G,H be graphs, and P(G,A), P(H,A) be the chromatic polynomials of G,H 
respectively. 
Then G is chromatically equivalent to H, (written P ~H), if 
P(G,A) = P(H,A). 
In this paper, we first state some open questions relating to chromatic 
equivalence of graphs, and then give non-trivial examples of chromatically equi-
valent graphs and their chromatic polynomials.

CHROMATICALLY EQUIVALENT GRAPHS 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
Let G be a graph, A a positive integer. 
Then a A-coloring of G is a mapping 
of the points of G into the integers 1, 2, ••. , A, called colors, so that if two 
points of G are adjacent they are assigned different colors. 
We denote by P(G,A) 
the number of A-colorings of G. 
It can be shown that, for each graph G, P(G,A) can be expressed as a polynomial 
in A with integral coefficients. 
We call this polynomial the chromatic polynomial 
(chromial) associated with G. 
If A is a positive integer, P(G,A) = 0 if and only if G cannot be colored in 
A colors. 
For example, if G is a triangulation of the sphere, P(G,A) = 0 for 
A = 0, 1, 2. 
If we could prove that P(G,4) # 0 for any planar triangulation G, 
or produce a planar triangulation for which P(G,4) = 0, we would solve the famous 
4-color conjecture. 
The study of chromatic equivalence of graphs may help us to 
characterize chromials and their zeroes. 
We present below, some of the unsolved problems concerning chromatic equi-
valence, and then give examples of chromatically equivalent graphs which are planar 
triangulations.

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS CONCERNING CHROMATIC EQUIVALENCE 
(a) 
Necessary and Sufficient Conditions 
Are there necessary and sufficient conditions that two graphs 
be chromatically equivalent? 
It is well known that a necessary condition for chromatic 
equivalence of graphs is that they have the same number of 
points, and a sufficient condition for two p-point graphs 
to be chromatically equivalent is that they be trees. 
L. A. Lee, my student, has partial results, which 
he will present in his doctoral thesis at the George 
Washington University, but the general question is still 
open. 

188 
(b) The Line Reconstruction Construction Conjecture 
and Chromatic Equivalence 
Let G be a graph with at least 3 points and q lines, 
The line reconstruction conjecture (LRC) first proposed 
by Harary [4], states that if the q subgraphs G- xi are 
given, then the entire graph G can be reconstructed, uniquely 
up to isomorphism, from these line-deleted subgraphs. 
Following Harary [4] we associate a graph G of q lines 
with a deck D of q numbered cards, with the ith card containing 
the subgraph Gi = G - xi. 
D is called the line deletion deck 
of G. 
F. Harary asked (verbal communication) whether we can 
construct the chromatic polynomial of a graph G from its 
line-deletion deck. 
When this question was presented by the 
author to T. Brylawski, he proved [3] that if G is not a tree 
or a cycle, we can indeed reconstruct P(G,A) from its line-
deletion deck. 
Since it is well known that all trees with q lines have 
the same chromatic polynomial, and that unicyclic graphs are 
line-reconstructible [5], it ~s .clear that the line-deletion 
deck D of G determines P(G,A). 
Thus we see that the following is equivalent to LRC: 
There is a unique graph, chromatically equivalent to G, 
which has the line-deletion deck D. 
Is there a proof of the above form of LRC? 
(c) 
Chromatically Equivalent Maps and Duals 
Are there planar maps G,H 
which have planar duals G',H' 
respectively, such that G c Hand G' ~ H'? 
This question was presented to me by T. Brylawski and 
S. Beraha. 

189 
(d) 
Chromatic Equivalence Classes 
Since chromatic equivalence is an equivalence relation, it 
partitions the set of graphs into chromatic equivalence 
classes.

Given a graph G, is there an algorithm which 
would enable us to generate all graphs chromatically equi-
valent to G? 
2. 
Is there a canonical form for a representative 
of each chromatic equivalence class, so that we can count 
chromatic equivalence classes of p-point graphs rather 
than listing all p-point graphs? 
This procedure could help in graphical enumeration 
problems.

Chromatic Equivalence of Regular Major Maps 
In studying the 4-color conjecture it is known that it is 
sufficient to restrict oneself to special maps, which we 
shall call regular major maps. 
These maps will all be planar 
duals of planar triangulations. 
A map M is called a regular major map if every region has 
at least five sides, and there are no proper n-rings for n < 4. 
(See [1] for definitions) 
M is called a 4-regular major map if ~t is a regular major 
map which has no 4-rings. 
When the author expressed the opinion that there were 
no regular major maps which were chromatically equivalent, 
since there are no such maps with fewer than 20 regions, the 
following examples refuted this conjecture: 
1. 
L. A. Lee found a regular major map which is not 
4-regular, and which is chromatically equivalent to a map 
with a quadrilateral. 

190 
2. 
F. Bernhart, in a private communication, exhibited 
a pair of 4-regular major maps which are chromatically equi-
valent. 
I am sure that there are no two regular major maps with 
at most 20 regions, and having proper 4-rings which are 
chromatically equivalent. 
What is the smallest number n of 
regions such that there are two regular major maps with n 
regions, both having 4-rings, which are chromatically equi-
valent? 
Bernhart's example is much larger than 20 regions. 
In 
fact,it has more than 60 regions. 
What is the smallest number 
n of regions such that there are two 4-regular major maps with 
n regions which are chromatically equivalent? 
3. 
CHROMATICALLY EQUIVALENT GRAPHS AND THEIR Q-CHROMIAL 
Let G be a graph whose chromial is P(G,A). 
Then the Q-chromial Q(G,u) of the 
graph G is given by 
_ 
P(G,A) 
Q(G,u) - A(A-l)(A-2)(A-3) 
with the chromial P(G,A) expanded in powers of u = A - 3. 
The Q-chromial, introduced by Birkhoff and Lewis [2], has degree p- 4 for a 
p-point graph, and smaller coefficients than does P(G,A). 
Thus, if G is a (p,q) 
graph with large p, it is more convenient to list Q(G,u) rather than P(G,A). 
Below is a list of twenty-five pairs and two triples of chromatically equiva-
lent p-point graphs, with 11 ~ p ~ 17. 
Each of these graphs is a planar triangulation, drawn with an outer circle 
whose points are all to be connected to a single point, the point at infinity. 
The 
degree of the point at infinity is given by the circled number. 
The label (n; p, q, r, •.• , t) tells us that the graph has n points, of which 
pare of degree 4, q of degree 5, r of degree 6, etc. Below each set of chromically 
equivalent graphs is their common Q-chromial. 
It is hoped that an examination of these non-trivial examples of chromatically 
equivalent graphs will help us to characterize chromatic equivalence.

ABSTRACT 
The minimum number of point disjoint paths which cover all the points of a 
graph defines a covering number denoted by ~· 
The relation of ~ to some 
other well-known graphical invariants is discussed, and ~ is evaluated for a 
variety of special classes of graphs. 
A simple algorithm is developed for 
determining ~ in the case of a tree, and it is shown that this tree algorithm 
can be generalized to yield ~ for any connected graph. 
Degree conditions are 
also derived which yield simple upper bounds for ~.

ON COVERING THE POINTS OF A GRAPH 
WITH POINT DISJOINT PATHS 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
Different covering numbers for graphs (the terminology and notation used 
here follow that of Harary [4]) arise naturally in network diagnostic schemes. 
For example, consider the question of providing systematic procedures for testing 
the integrity of the lines of a graph by examining appropriate line sequences. 
One natural approach would be to cover all the lines of a graph with line-disjoint 
trails. 
The smallest such number of line disjoint trails which cover all the lines 
of a graph G is called the trail-to-line covering number denoted by n(G), or simply 
n. 
Clearly, n is related to the classical notion of eulerian transversability. 
Indeed, for a connected graph G, n is just the max (1, P0), where P0 is one-half 
the number of points of odd degree (Harary [4]). 
A more interesting parameter is obtained by considering point diagnostic 
schemes for network integrity. 
Consequently, this paper investigates coverings of 
the points of a graph with point-disjoint paths. 
The minimum number of point-
disjoint paths which cover all the points of G is denoted by ~(G), or simply~. 
and is called the path-to-point covering number of G. 
In order for ~ to be well-
defined, paths which consist of a single point must be admitted. 
Then, for example, 
the star Kl,n(n ~ 2) has ~(Kl,n) = n - 1. 
Conceptually, the covering parameter most similar to n seems to be the path 
number n(G), the smallest number of line-disjoint paths which cover all the lines 
of G ([5, 6, 7, 11]). 
Although n and 
~ are intuitively dual concepts, and indeed similar to other 
covering parameters, the covering number 
~ appears to have received much less 
attention in the literature. 
However, 
~ is clearly related to the study of hamil-
tonian graphs, and it has been introduced in this context by Barnette [1] to 
examine the existence of hamiltonian paths in three-connected planar graphs. 
A 
complete discussion of this problem is given by Klee in [8]. 
The relation of~ 
to hamiltonian graphs is also explored by Goodman and Hedetniemi [3]. 

203 
The motivation for introducing rr(G) came from considering a graph theoretic 
model for information retrieval structures. 
The covering number ~ could likewise 
be introduced in an information retrieval context. 
For example, path-to-point 
covers are useful for certain problems in the theory of information structures. 
Thus consider a data structure organized as a 2-way linked list (Knuth [9]. 
It is often necessary to reclaim storage using garbage collection techniques as 
well as to search into the structure for desired data items. 
In such cases, one 
must have a systematic way for investigating all the items in the structure, and, 
for implementation on a real-time computer system, traversal must be very efficient. 
Clearly, maximum efficiency is achieved when the number of paths in the traversal 
is minimal. 
2. 
COMPARISON WITH OTHER GRAPHICAL INVARIANTS 
Trail-to-line and path-to-point covers are natural generalizations of eulerian 
trails and hamiltonian paths in the following sense: 
(i) 
n(G) = 1 iff G has an eulerian trail, 
and 
(ii) 
~(G) = 1 iff G has a hamiltonian path. 
Note that although n and ~ are line and point analogs, they are not simply related 
to each other using line graphs. 
The example in Figure 1 shows that n (G) # ~ (L (G)) 
and 
n(L(G)) #~(G). 
Furthermore nand~ are not related by a simple inequality, i.e., K1 , 5 shows 
that ~ { n 
and K4 shows that n { 
~. 
On the other hand, ~ is related to thediameter 
and connectivity of a graph.

Theorem 1. 
Let G be a two-connected graph with connectivity K(G) and diameter 
d (G). 
Then for K(G) .::_ 2, 
(i) 
and for K(G) 
(ii) 
1. 
l;(G) < K(G)[2-d(G)] + p- 3, 
l; (G) ::_ p -
d (G) • 
Remark. 
Notice that if G is merely an even cycle c2m then the bound given by (i) 
of Theorem 1 is attained, and for the star Kl,n the bound in (ii) of Theorem 1 is 
attained. 
Proof. 
(i) If v1 and v2 are two diametral points (endpoints of a longest geodesic), 
then by Menger's Theorem (Harary [4]),there are K.::_ 2 paths connecting vl and 
and v2 which are point-disjoint except for v1 and v2 • 
Hence the points on all 
these paths can be covered by K(G) - 1 point-disjoint paths. 
Now as the diameter 
is d(G), there must be d(G)- 1 or more points excluding v1 and v2 on each of these 
"Menger-paths." Thus there remains at most p -
[ K(d (G) - 1) + 2] points of G, which 
can be covered by zero length paths. 
(ii) 
The path connecting two diametral points cover d(G) + 1 points, 
and zero length paths cover the remaining points of G. 
Finally note that l; can be defined equivalently as a point-disjoint covering 
of all the points of a graph with paths such that the total number of lines in 
these paths is a maximum. 
However, the caterpillar example developed in Figures 
2a, 2b, and 2c demonstrates that this equivalence does not imply that l; can be 
obtained in the "greedy" sense of obtaining a longest path and then a next longest, 
etc.

EVALUATING t FOR SPECIAL GRAPHS 
It is obvious that the complete graph ~ has t(~) = 1, and that 
t(Kl,n) = n- 1 (n ~ 2). A more interesting but still simple case is the 
complete bigraph Kn,m• 
Clearly, t(Kn,m) depends on the magnitude of the 
difference between n and m. 
Rather than discuss the bigraph, consider the 
case of the complete n-partite graph. 
Theorem 2. Let K(p1,p2, ••• ,pn) = (V,X) be the complete n-partite graph with parts 
~ Pn. 
Then 
Proof. 
Two cases are considered. First it is shown that t = 1 if 
p 
-
1 
n L Pj < 1. 
j=2 
To this end, note that the minimum degree 6 of any point in K(p1,p2•···•Pn) is 
n L pj. Thus by Ore's condition for a Hamiltonian path, (Ore [10]), t = 1 if 
j=2 
26 
2 
n L Pj ~ p - 1 
j=2 
Suppose then that for the second case, 
n 
n 
L Pj + pl - 1 . 
j=2 
pl > L Pj + 1. 
j=2 

206 
If ~ = 1, then since no two points of v1 are adjacent, and since all points of 
v1 must be covered by one path, 
n 
pl < I Pj + 1. 
j=2 
Thus 
~ ~ 2. 
Now the endpoints of any 2 paths in a minimum cover cannot be adjacent; 
thus all the endpoints of the paths must be contained in the same part, say Vi. 
It 
is now demonstrated that the points of each path in a minimum cover must alternate 
between Vi and Vi (the complement of Vi). 
Hence assume to the contrary that one 
of these paths contains a subpath of the form 
path P' say v0xivi ••• v~ with v0, v~ c Vi. 
the following single path 
This, however, would contradict minimality.* 
The two paths could be combined into 
Thus the points of each path in the 
minimal cover alternate between Vi and Vi. 
Now this is impossible if i I 1 as the 
points of v1C:vi (i I 1) could not be covered by such paths. 
Hence suppose there 
are a paths of nonzero length which start and end in v1 and S paths of zero length, 
each path being a point of v1 • 
Hence 
and 
n 
I Pj + a + S 
j=2 
n 
s = P1 -
I Pj 
j=2 
It should be noted that if a > 1 , then two paths of non-eero length can 
be combined to increase S by one and decrease a by one. 
Hence, there is always 
a cover with a = 1. 
*Note that this contradiction is still valid when P' consists of a single point.

CALCULATING 
~ FOR TREES AND CONNECTED GRAPHS 
The value of ~ for an arbitrary tree does not appear to be simply related to 
any other well-known tree invariant. 
However ~ can be calculated for a forest or 
a tree using the algorithm presented in this section; this algorithm was discovered 
independently by Goodman and Hedetniemi [3]. 
Recall that if Vis the point set of 
a graph then for W .Cv, the notation <w> means the induced subgraph on W. 
Theorem 3. 
(i) If G has two or more endpoints 
adjacent to a point v0 , then 
G' 
satisfies 
~(G) 
~{G') + k- 1 , 
(ii) If G has one endpoint w which is adjacent to a point v 
of degree two, then 
satisfies 
~(G) 
~(G") 
Proof. 
Case (i) Clearly ~O' val' va2, ... , vak> is a star Kl,k , and hence 
~(G) < ~(G') + k - 1 
by covering G' and the star independently. It is now shown 
that any minimum cover of G defines a cover of G' which has ~(G) -
(k-1) paths, and 

208 
the proof of this case is then complete, 
Clearly, any minimum cover of G must 
include v0 and v0 cannot be on a path of zero length. 
Furthermore the path which 
covers v0 cannot terminate at v0 • 
This path may terminate at some va. or it may 
1 
not. 
However, in either case there exists a cover of G' which has ~(G') -
(k-1) 
paths. 
Case (ii) Any minimum cover of G must include w, and w must be an endpoint 
of some path. 
Furthermore w cannot be covered by a path of zero length else v 
would be the endpoint of some path. 
Hence the path which covers w must include v 
and 
~(G") <~(G). On the other hand, any cover of G" must have v 
as an endpoint 
of a path. 
Hence any minimum cover of G" yields a cover of the same size in G, and 
thus 
~(G)~ ~(G"). 
Suppose G has endpoints which satisfy either (i) or (ii) of Theorem 3. 
Then 
the determination of ~(G) can be simplified to finding the ~ of a reduced graph. 
If the reduced graph has a known ~,then ~(G) is determined. 
Alternatively if the 
reduced graph again has endpoints of the desired type, then the reduction can be 
continued. 
The next lemma establishes that this reduction yields an algorithm for 
finding ~ of a forest. 
Lemma. 
Any nontrivial forest has either two or more endpoints adjacent to the same 
point or it has at least one endpoint adjacent to a point of degree two. 
Proof. 
Suppose not, then all endpoints are adjacent to different points, and these 
in turn are of degree greater than two. 
However this is impossible as removing the 
endpoints must produce another forest which in turn has endpoints. 
By observing that if G is a forest, then G' and G", as defined in Theorem 3, 
are also forests, it follows that this Lemma together with Theorem 3 provide an 
algorithm for calculating ~ for any forest. 
For certain special trees, this 
algorithm can be used to derive an explicit formula for~; in particular this is the 
case for regular acyclic data structures. 
To this end, let Td1,d2, ••• ,d~-l 
denote a tree with one point v of degree d1 such that for each k(l ~ k ~ ~ - 1) 
every point at distance k from v has degree dk + 1; all points at distance ~ from 
v are endpoints. 
Also let To denote an isolated point. 
Thus Theorem 3 provides 
for the following recursion formula

The value of ~ can then be calculated by distinguishing odd and even ~ and observ-
ing that ~(Td 1 ) = d1 - 1 and ~(T 0 ) = 1. 
Simple formulas are easily obtained for 
special cases of such trees by applying this recursion formula. 
Corollary 1. 
Let T be a tree in which all of the nonendpoints have degree n and 
each endpoint is equidistant (say at distance ~) from some fixed point. 
Then

Corollary 2. 
Let T be a tree in which all of the nonendpoints have degree (n+l) 
except for one point of degree n and each endpoint is equidistant (say at distance 
~) from the degree n point. 
Then 
~(T) = r n~-4ll 
L n+l J 
where [x] denotes the largest integer ~ x, as usual. 
Another result is that the tree algorithm can be used to determine ~ of any 
graph

Let G be a connected graph and let T1 ,T2 , ••• ,T~ denote all the spanning 
trees of G. 
Then

Proof. 
Now if His any spanning subgraph of G then certainly 
~(G) ~~(H). On the 
other hand, if there is a covering of the points of a graph, then the lines con-
tained in the paths of this covering are contained in some spanning tree T of G. 
Hence 
~(T) ~~(G) for some spanning tree T. 
Since there are many known algorithms for finding all the spanning trees of 
a connected graph, Theorem 4 actually provides an algorithm for determining 
~ 
for any graph; see [3] for a discussion of the efficiency of this approach,

Before concluding this section, it is interesting to note that the hotJeomorphic 
reduction in Step (ii) of Theorem 3 is peculiar to the endpoints,viz., for the 
example of Figure 4, ~(T) = 3 and ~(TH) = 2 where TH is the homeomorphic reduction 
of T.

DEGREE CONDITIONS 
Path-to-point covers general1ze the concept of a hamiltonian path. 
Since 
there are a variety of degree conditions for hamilt.onian graphs, it is only natural 
to seek degree conditions for ~· 
In fact, an examination of Ore's work [10] on 
degree conditions for hamiltonian paths reveals a theorem on ~· 
Ore intro-
duced point-disjoint path coverings of points such that the paths contain a maximum 
number of lines. 
As previously noted, this is equivalent to the definition of ~ 
given here. 
Ore derived a basic lemma on ~ but only used it to derive a theorem 
for ~. when ~ is equal to one. 
Since his final result on ~ = 1 can be derived 
without ever introducing the covering concept, this particular lemma may not be 
well-known. 
The next theorem, gives a slightly more general version of this lemma; 
the proof being similar to that given by Ore. 
Theorem 4. 
Let n be any number with 1 ~ n ~ p - 1. If for each set N of n + 1 
independent points of a graph G, di + dj ~p- n for some vi' vj E N(i I j), then 
~(G) < n. 
The bound of this theorem is attainable in the following sense. 
For any 
n > 1, let G* be a complete bipartite graph with parts of size n and 2n. 
By 
Theorem 2, ~(G*) 
n, and clearly di ~n for all of the 3n points of G*. 
An immediate corollary of this theorem is a bound for ~ in terms of the minimum 
degree 6. 

211 
Corollary. 
If o is the minimum degree of the points of G, then s(G) < max 
{1, p-2o}. 
Furthermore, this bound is attained by G. 
Many interesting degree-condition questions remain unresolved. 
For example, 
conditions stronger than those of Theorem 4 are known for n = 1 (Chvatal [2)), but 
analogous conditions for n > 1 were only obtained several months after this con-
ference by V. Chvatal. 
These two results are as follows. 
Theorem. 
Let the non-decreasing sequence IT(G) = (d1 ,d2, .•• ,dp) be the degree 
sequence of a graph G, and let n be a given number (1 < n ~ p). 
Then s(G) < n, if 
di + n < i < T 
implies 
dp+n-l ~ p-i • 
Furthermore if IT(G) fails to satisfy this condition at i

G 
with non-decreasing degree sequence (di,d2, .•• ,dp) has s(G)

(The line extremal result). 
For any k,n ~ 1 and p > 2, let 
f(k) 
k(k-n) + (p-k) ~p-k-l) 
and 
Then all (p,q) graphs with q ~ q0 lines have s ~ n. 
Furthermore there exists a 
graph G0 with q0 -
1 lines such that s(G0) = n+l. 
Similarly, though the line extremal result can be derived when n = 1 by 
using Theorem 4 (Ore [10)), the same type of result for general n is still unavail-
able. 
In particular, direct application of Theorem 4 does not yield a sharp 
(extremal) result when n > 2. 
Instead, it only supplies a bound q0 such that for 
all graphs G with more than q0 lines, ~(G) < n. 
However, this bound is not sharp 
since there are cases where all graphs with q0 - 1 lines also have s < n. 
Further-
more, the obvious generalization (~-nl) ~) of the extremal graph for n = 1 does 
not yield the general extremal graph. 
For example, K4LJ i 3 (with 36 lines) has 

212 
a ~ of 3, while K4 + K8 (with 38 lines) has a 
~ of 4.

ABSTRACT 
Let the vertices of a 2n-gon be labelled, in an order of traversal: 
0, 1', 1, 2', 2, •.• , (n-1)', n-1, 0 1 • 
Let G(n,m) denote the bicubic graph 
derived from this 2n-gon by adjunction of the chords (i,(i+m)'), i = 0, 1, 
2, .•• , n-1, the addition being taken modulo n. 
Restricting ourselves to the 
case when n is prime, we determine the isomorphism classes of the graphs 
G(n,m), and the corresponding automorphism groups. 
Various applications are 
discussed.

A USEFUL FAMILY OF BICUBIC GRAPHS 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
Let n, m be any natural numbers, with 1 < m .::._ n-1. 
The bicubic (= bipartite 
trivalent) graph G(n,m) is defined as follows: 
It has 2n vertices, which we shall 
label: 
0, 1, 2, .•. , n-1, O', 1', 2', ... , (n-1)' 
and the 3n edges: 
[i,i'), [i, (i+l)'), [i, (i+m)']' 
i = 0, 1, 2, ..• , (n-1) 
where the addition is taken modulo n. 
The graph G(n,m) may be viewed as derived 
from the (2n)-gon with vertices (in an order of traversal): 
O', 0, 1', 1, 2', 2, .•. , (n-1)', n-1, 
by the adjunction of the chords 
[i, (i+m)'], 
i = 0, 1, 2, •.. , n-1. 
In the notation of Frucht [6], G(n,m) may be represented by the symbol 
m 
1 
This family of graphs was introduced by Coxeter [2, p. 426], as a generalization 
of the well-known 6-cage or Heawood graph, which is G(7,3). 
In [3, p. 107], Coxeter 
and Moser give a detailed study of a certain subfamily of these graphs, namely the 
graphs associated with certain hexagonal maps {6,3}b,c on the torus, and they de-
termine the groups of these maps. 
While the graphs G(n,m) are in general only 
vertex-transitive, this subfamily corresponds to graphs that are also edge-transitive, 
and hence symmetrical. 
In particular, in 1967, C. C. Sims pointed out [letter to 
R. M. Foster] that when b and c are coprime, b + c > 3, bc(b - c) I 0 , then the 
graphs {6,3}b,c of Coxeter's family are 1-regular (in the sense of Tutte [9]; 
1-unitransitive, in the terminology of Harary [7]) and not 2-regular (as reported 
by Coxeter [2], p. 427). 
This provided an infinite family of 1-regular trivalent 

215 
graphs, 
Earlier, such graphs were thought to be rather exceptional; the first 
known one (with 432 vertices) was described by Frucht [5], and only 4 with fewer 
than 400 vertices were listed in Foster's census [4]. 
Recently, Miller [8] found 
all !-regular trivalent graphs with girth 6. 
In terms of the graphs G(n,m), the 
family described by Sims and Miller corresponds to the case where m is the least 
positive solution of the congruence 
m(m-1) = -l(mod n), 
n > 7 , 
The smallest member is G(l3,4) (= {6,3}3 ,1) with 26 vertices, as found by Sims. 
However, it seems that the symmetry properties of the class of graphs G(n,m) 
as a whole have not yet been systematically studied, although these properties are 
of use in relation to various problems, of which we mention the following. 
(1) 
In [10], M. Watkins raised the question as to which finite 
groups have regular representations as automorphism groups 
of graphs. 
He showed that, in particular, the dihedral 
groups of order at least 12 admit such representations on 
5-valent graphs. 
We see that dihedral groups of order at 
least 18 admit such representations on trivalent graphs, 
these being G(n,3), where 2n is the order of the dihedral 
group. 
(2) 
Bouwer and Frucht, in [1], left open the following problem 
for primes p ~ 11: 
How many different graphs are there 
with the least possible number of 
edges (namely 4p) such that their 
automorphism group is isomorphic 
to the cyclic group of order p? 
The graphs G(p,m) are an essential tool in the construction 
of these edge-minimal graphs, and the question can be answered 
as soon as one can determine the number of non-isomorphic 
graphs G(p,m) for each prime p > 11. 

(3) 
216 
Let F(n,m) be the following cubic form inn variables, 
vo, vl, v2 ' ... , vn-1: 
n-1 
F(n,m) 
l: 
i=O vi vi+l vi-kn ' 
where addition of the subscripts is taken modulo n. 
If 
we let the group of permutations of the variables that 
leave the value ofF fixed be C(n,m), we can see that 
this is a subgroup of index 2 in the automorphism group 
of G(n,m). 
Thus,determining the groups of the graphs 
G(n,m) will enable us to find C(n,m). 
Our main results may be briefly summarized as follows: 
We have found the isomorphism classes and automorphism 
groups of the graphs G(p,m) for any given prime p, with 
£±!. 
2 ~ m ~ 2 • One isomorphism class is always formed by 
£±!. 
G(p,2) and G(p, 
2 ) 
If p = S(mod 6) then the graphs 
G(p,m) with 3 < m < E=l are mutually isomorphic in tri-
-
2 
ples, so that there are 
different isomorphism 
classes of this kind. 
If p : l(mod 6) then the graphs 
E=l 
G(p,m) with 3 ~m < 
2 
are mutually isomorphic in 
triples with one exception. 
Thus in this case, the 
number of isomorphism classes of the graphs G(p,m) with 
3 < m < E=l. 
2 
l.S 
The exception just mentioned 
corresponds for p = 7 to the 6-cage with a group of order 
336 [2, p. 425], and for p = 13, 19, 31, ••• to the one-
regular graphs found by Sims whose automorphism group is 
known [3, p. 107] to be of order 6p. 
In the remaining 
cases the groups are isomorphic to dihedral groups, and 
of order 4p if m = 2 or m = ~, and of order 2p if 
3 ~m ~ ~ Since 2p is also the number of vertices 
of G{p,m) and since these graphs are vertex-transitive, 

Lemma 2.1. 
Proof. 
217 
we have as a corollary the existence of regular 
representations of the dihedral group Dp on trivalent 
graphs for any prime p > 11. 
Avoiding the exceptional 
one-regular graphs by choosing m = 3, we can, in par-
ticular, exhibit G(p,3) as yielding the desired repre-
sentation of Dp . It has already been mentioned above 
that also if· n is not a prime, then G(n,3) still 
furnishes a regular representation of Dn on a trivalent 
graph, whenever n ~ 9. 
In general, however, the results 
obtained in this paper for prime n are not valid for 
composite n. 
This latter case will be considered in a 
subsequent paper.

Figure 1 
Consider any vertex of G(n,m), say 0. 
In Figure 1 we have the subgraph of G(n,m) 
containing all vertices at a distance < 3 from the vertex 0. 
The vertices at a 

218 
n-1 
distance< 2 from 0 are easily seen to be all distinct iff 3 ~m ~--
2 -
Thus 
for these values of m, the graph G(n,m) does not contain quadrilaterals. 
Similarly, 
n-1 
the nine vertices at a distance 3 from the vertex 0 are all distinct if 3 < m < - 2-, 
m I[~] (square brackets denoting integral part). In this case, we note that 
each edge incident with 0 belongs to exactly two otherwise disjoint hexagons. 
By 
transitivity, 
any edge of G(n,m) belongs to exactly two hexagons, which are other-
wise disjoint. 
We now restrict ourselves to the latter class of graphs, i.e.,G(n,m) with 
3 < m < n-1 
m I [n+2] 
2 
, 
3 
In this class of graphs, any two incident edges belong 
to exactly one hexagon, so we can define a Petrie path as follows: 
Definition 2.2. 
Let e1 , e2 be any two adjacent edges of G(n,m). 
Then a Petrie 
path P(e1,e2) is defined as a walk containing 
e1 , e2 as consecutive edges, 
such that no three consecutive edges belong to the same hexagon. 
It is readily seen from the above definition that given any two edges in a 
Petrie path, it is uniquely determined. 
We remark that Dr. W. Harries showed 
[private communication] that given any graph G, there exist a surface S and an 
embedding of G in S such that there is only one Petrie path of the embedding, which 
therefore covers each edge of the graph twice. 
We will show that our Petrie path(s) 
do not do this. 
Lemma 2.3. 
Each vertex in a Petrie path is of degree 2 in the subgraph defined by 
the path. 
Proof. 
Consider a Petrie path containing in the natural way the 
following sequence 
of edges and vertices ... e1 , v1 , e 2 , v2 , e3 , v3 , e4 , .... Now assume that v1 is of 
degree three in the path, and without loss of generality that edges e2 , e3 ••• ed+l 
with ed+l I e1 , form a simple circuit of length d leading back to v1 • 
Let this be 
the shortest such circuit. 
Now there is an automorphism of the graph which will 
take e1 , v1 , e2 to e3 , v3 , e4 respectively. 
Thus, since a Petrie path is completely 
determined by any two consecutive edges, the path defined by e3 and e4 is the same 
as that defined by e1 and e2 • But now we have that we can begin at e1 and continue 
with e2, e3 •.• ed+l to arrive back at vl without repeating edges. It is clear 
that there can be no walk within the Petrie path beginning e3 , e4 and arriving back 

219 
at v3 in d steps without repeating edges. 
Thus we have a contradiction and there 
can be no vertices of degree three in the Petrie path. 
Thus every vertex must be 
of degree two in the subgraph defined by the path. 
Lemma 2.4. If p is prime, each Petrie path in G(p,m) is a Hamiltonian circuit. 
Proof. If it were not a Hamiltonian circuit, it would decompose the vertex set into 
a number of sets of the same cardinality, by transitivity. 
The cardinality of the 
sets would have to divide 2p, and would therefore be either 2 or p. 
Sets of cardi-
nality 2 are not possible since the graph has no multiple edges; sets of cardinality 
p are not possible since the graph is bipartite, and p is odd. 
Henceforth we restrict ourselves to those graphs G(p,m) with p prime and p > 7. 
3. 
PETRIE PATHS: DESCRIPTION 
Since a Petrie path is determined by any given choice of two consecutive 
edges, there ar-. exactly three Petrie paths passing through a given vertex. 
Thus there are three Petrie paths in all. 
One of these is the outer polygon, 
O' 0 1' 1 2' 2 •.. (p-1)' (p-1). The following argument now shows that a given 
graph G(p,m) is isomorphic to at most two graphs G(p, m1), G(p, m2). 
Any isomorphism must take Petrie paths to Petrie paths. 
Thus interchanging 
the outer polygon with one of the other Petrie paths may result in a different value 
for m. 
The only maps preserving the outer polygon are rotations and reflections 
about a vertex or the mid-point of an edge. 
These either leave the value of m un-
changed or change it to (p +1-m). Thus there are at most two values m1 , m2 in 
the range 3 < m1 , m2 < (~), m1 , m2 "' [~]such that G(p,ml) O!IG(p,m2) ~G(p,m) 
We now find the three Petrie paths explicitly. 
We consider the paths as they 
pass through the vertex 0. 
1. 
The path defined by the edges O' 0, and 0 1'. This 
Petrie path is the outer polygon. 
2. 
The path defined by the edges 1' 0, 0 m'. 
For this Petrie path 
we let uo' = 1', uo 
un' = (n(m-1))', un 
0, u1 ' = m'. 
Then u1 = (m-1) and in general 
(n(m-1) + 1)', both of these values being taken 
modulo p. 
We define an isomorphism of the graph G(p,m) with the 

220 
graph G(p,k) by un' + n. 
Then k satisfies the equation 
(1) 
k(m-1) = -1 mod p • 
So k is the smallest positive integer staisfying this 
equation. 
3. 
The path defined by the edges O' 0, 0 m'. 
For this Petrie 
path we let v0 • = O', v0 = 0, v1 = m'. 
Then vl = m and 
in general vn' = (nm)', vn = nm, both modulo p. 
We can 
define an isomorphism of G(p,m) with the graph G(p,s) by 
vn' + n', Vn + n. 
Then s satisfies 
vs' = 1' , or 
(2) 
sm = 1 mod p . 
Again, s is the smallest positive integer satisfying (2~. 
Lemma 3.1. If 3 ~ m ~ 9 , then k and s satisfy 3 ~ k, s ~ p-2 , k, s I ~ 
Proof. It is clear that k,s > 2.

£±!. 
It is easy to show that k = p-1 or s = 
2 
t~plies 
m=2, and k =~or s-p-1 implies m= p-1, both giving rise to a contradiction. 
We recall that any graph G(p,q) with~~ q ~ p-2 is isomorphic to the graph 
ld. 
G(p,p+l-q), and 3 ~ p+l-q ~ 2 
We therefore introduce the following notation. 
Notation. 
For any x £ [3, ~] U [~, p-1] we let x denote that member of x and 
p+l-x lying in the interval [3, 91 
4. 
ISOMORPHISM CLASSES 
Theorem 4.1. If p is a given prime, then the isomorphism classes of the graphs 
G(p,m), 3 ~ m ~~,can be characterized by the triples {m, ~.~}and at most one 
singleton {m = ~ = ~}, these triples and possible singleton forming a partition of 
the set of integers {3, 4, ••• ~}. A singleton occurs iff p: l(mod 6). 
Proof. 
We proceed by proving a series of lemmas. 

221 
Lemma 4.2. 
With m, k and s defined as above, we have that either: 
(1) 
(2) 
m = k = s 
or 
-
-
_,-
~· ~and~ are all different. 
We consider every other possibility (i.e., exactly two of~·~.~ equal) and show 
that they cannot occur. 
(a) 
Let k = ~· ~ f. m . 
(i) If k = s, we have k(m-1) - -1 mod p 
and km - 1 mod p. 
Adding, we get k(2m-l) = 0 mod p, which is a contradiction 
since both k and (2m-l) are less than p. 
(ii) 
If k = p+l-s, we have k(m-1) - -1 mod p, 
and 
(p+l-k)m _ 1 mod p, 
so that m-k - 0 mod p, 
which implies m = k, i.e. m 
k = s • 
(b) 
Let ~ = ~. ~ f. ~. 
(i) 
k = m 
iff 
m(m-1) _ -1 mod p 
iff 
(p+l-m)m = 1 mod p 
iff 
s = p + 1 - m i.e. k = m = s. 
(ii) 
k 
p+l-m so (p+l-m) (m-1) :; -1 mod p 
so m(2-m) :; 0 mod p 
so m = 2 or p r m(2-m) which is a contradiction. 
(c) 
Let ~ = ~· ~ f. s . 
(i) 
s = m 
so m2 = 1 mod p by (2) 
so m2-l = 0 mod p 
so p I (m+l)(m-1), which cannot be. 
(ii) 
The case s = p+l-m has already been covered under (b) (i). 
Thus any graph G(p,m) satisfying~=~=~ has m = k = p+l-s. 
Lemma 4.3. 
For any p there is at most one graph G(p,m) with~=~=~. with 
3 < m ~ p. 

222 
Proof. 
When m 
k 
p+l-s, the congruences k(m-1) -
-1 mod p and sm = 1 mod p 
reduce to 
m2 - m + 1 = 0 mod p • 
2 
If there were m1 also satisfying m1 
- ml + 1 = 0 mod p, we would have, subtracting 
hence 
m = m1 
or 
m + m1 = 1 mod p, so m1 = p + 1 - m ~ ~ 
We note that we can also define the paths algebraically to satisfy the same 
1'±£-.~ 
E.=!: 
equations. 
This leads to G(p,3) 1!! G(p, [--:r-]) - G(p, 
2 ) • We note that 3, 
[~] , ~, are always distinct unless p = 7, in which case they are all equal. 
For any m, 3 .::_ m .::_~,we consider the triple (~, ~· ~) with s and k defined 
as above. 
The same three entries ~· s and k are found regardless of which one we 
start with. 
For a triple (~', ~·, ~'), 
if m' = ~. then s' = m and k' = p + 1 -
~; 
if m' = ~. then s' = p + 1 - m and k' = p + 1 - s. 
Thus we have shown that the integers in the interval [3, ~] are partitioned 
into triples(~,~·~ with at most one singleton(~=~=~. and this partitioning 
characterizes the isomorphism classes of the graphs G(p,m) for given p and 
3<m<9. 
Lemma 4.4. 
There will be a graph G(p,m) satisfying m 
s = ~iff p _ 1 mod 6. 
Proof. 
p must be either 1 mod 6 or 5 mod 6. 
(i) 
p = 1 mod 6. 
Let p = 6n + 1, then the number of integers in 
the interval [3, ~] is 3n- 2 = 3(n-l) + 1. 
There must 
accordingly be a singleton graph G(p,m) with m = s = ~. 
and (n-1) is isomorphic triples (~, ~. ~). 
(ii) 
p = 5 mod 6. 
Let p = 6n + 5, then the number of integers 
in the interval [3, ~] is 3n. 
There must ben isomorphic 
triples (~, ~. ~) and there can be no graph G(p,m) with 
m = k = s.

5. 
AUTOMORPHISM GROUPS 
We now consider the groups of these graphs. 
We divide the graphs into three 
types for given p, and 3 ::._ m ::._ ~, 
(i) 
Those graphs characterized by a triple {~, ~. ~} not 
containing the integer 3, with~· ~. ~distinct. 
(ii) 
Those graphs characterized by a triple {~, ~. ~} 
containing the integer 3, with~· ~.~distinct. 
(iii) Those graphs characterized by a singleton{~=~ 
~}. 
For graphs of type (i), the Petrie paths are defined by topological properties. 
Therefore they have to be preserved. If a map interchanges two Petrie paths, the 
value of m changes, and it follows that the map cannot be an automorphism. 
It follows that automorphisms of the graph must leave each Petrie path fixed 
globally. 
The only maps which leave the outer polygon fixed globally are rotations 
through any multiple of ~ and reflections about a vertex or the mid-point of an 
p 
edge. 
The only maps which are also automorphisms are rotations about any multiple 
of ~and reflections about the mid-point of an edge. 
The others are isomorphisms 
p 
with G(p, p+l-m). 
Thus the group of the graph is abstractly isomorphic to the 
dihedral group of order 2p. 
The graphs of type (ii) have the same automorphisms as specified above, but 
we cannot use the Petrie path argument to show that these are the only automor-
phisms of the graph. 
Instead we consider the stabilizer of a vertex of G(p,3), 0 
say. 
We see that d(l', 2') = d(2', 3') = d(2', O') = 2. 
It can be seen from the diagram below that 2' is the only vertex at a distance 2 from 
all the neighbors of 0. 
Also, from the diagram, assuming p > 9, we see that there 
are three more vertices at a distance two from both O' and 1', namely 3', (p-1)' 
and (p-2)' whereas there are only two more (namely 4', O') at a distance two from 
both 1' and 3', and only one (1') at a distance two from both O' and 3'. It follows 
that the stabilizer of a vertex is the identity, and the maximum order of the group 
of the graph is the number of vertices, 2p. 
A similar argument holds for the case 
p = 9. 
The group of this type of graph is therefore also isomorphic to the 

224 
dihedral group of order 2p, p > 9. 
(p-1)' 
5' 
6' 
2 
3 
(p-3)' 
Figure 2 
(All the vertices in this 
diagram are distinct if 
p > 9.) 
For graphs G(p,m) of type (iii) (i.e. where m = ~ = ~), p > 7, we have as 
before that the group of automorphisms preserving the edge set of any Petrie path 
is isomorphic to the dihedral group Dp. 
Now consider any 2-path, O' 0 1' say. It 
uniquely determines a Petrie path. 
No automorphism can reverse this 2-path, for 
this would reverse the Petrie path, and the graph would be mapped to G(p, p+l-m). 
Thus, for any two 2-paths there can be at most one automorphism transforming the 
edge set of one to the edge set of the other. 
Since we know that the three Petrie 
paths are mutually interchangeable, they must be so with respect to the cyclic 
group c3 . 
The group of this type of graph is described in [3, p. 108].

RECONSTRUCTING COMBINATORIAL GEOMETRIES

ABSTRACT 
Ulam-type reconstruction problems are given for combinatorial geometries. 
In 
particular the subgeometry generating function is evaluated from the subgeometry 
generating functions of single element deletions. 
This result is applied to graphs 
to give the chromatic polynomial (for vertices or regions) and a number of other 
invariants which can be computed from the deck of edge deletions.

RECONSTRUCTING COMBINATORIAL GEOMETRIES 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
In [5) it was hoped that readers would appreciate the link between graphs and 
matroids (combinatorial geometries) since theorems (and we may add problems) for 
the former can be generalized to the latter and since general matroid considerations 
often clarify aspects of graph theory. 
In this spirit we mention some of the ways 
Ulam's reconstruction problem [3,4,8) for graphs may be rephrased for geometries. 
In particular, the vertex problem (§3) has a number of generalized conjectures for 
geometries (although the most obvious one is false) leading to one which is equi-
valent to the Ulam conjecture when restricted to any geometry represented by a four-
connected graph. 
However, it is the edge problem (§4) that most easily generalizes to geometries. 
The phrasing of this problem in a geometrical setting is not only natural but allows 
a geometric computation which,when applied to graphical geometries,gives an easy way 
to compute the chromatic polynomial (and hence the chromatic number and Mobius 
function), complexity, number of acyclic orientations, number of forests, number of 
spanning subsets of edges and number of blocks of a graph (or its planar dual when 
relevant) given its "deck" of edge deletions. 
We first define some relevant notions 
and properties of geometries (§2) adding in brackets the parallel notion for graphs 
when the geometry is graphical. 
The reader desiring a fuller treatment of these 
notions can find it in [1), [2), or [5). 
We would like to thank Dr. J. Longyear 
for first suggesting this problem in a remark in "The Graph Theory Newsletter," and 
Professor R. Bari for her helpful discussions relating the Ulam conjecture to the 
chromatic theory of graphs -- an idea originating with Professor F. Harary. 
In fact it was Harary who first asked if the edge reconstruction problem could 
be solved if one knew the chromatic polynomial of the reconstructed graph. 
We hope our computation of the chromatic polynomial will lead to new recon-
struction techniques which use this information.

BASIC CONCEPTS 
A finite pregeometry or matroid, is a finite set of points with a closure 
operator JG(•) satisfying the exchange property: For any points p,q E G and any 
subset P ~G, if p E P U{q} but p t P, then q E P U {p}. 
It is easy to see that 
the edges of a finite graph (more generally multigraph) satisfy this property where 
closure means circuit completion (p E A if p E A or p is in a circuit in AU p). 
For such pregeometries each geometric concept has a graphical interpretation which 
we will give in brackets. 
Since edges are under consideration we will henceforth 
assume that no subgraphs have any isolated vertices. 
A geometry [Michigan graph] is a pregeometry in which the empty set and each 
point [edge] are closed [no loops or multiple edges]. 
The lattice, L, of closed 
sets or flats [subgraphs whose components are induced subgraphs] is called a geome-
tric lattice [lattice of contractions]. 
Flats covered by 1 in L are called hyper-
planes [maximal subgraphs which have one less vertex or one more connected compo-
nent than G]. A bond [cutset] B of G is the set complement of a hyperplane. 
In L 
each lattice element x has a well-defined rank, r(x), equal to the length of any 
maximal chain from the 0 element [the set of loops] to x. 
r(A), the rank of a sub-
set of points [subgraph] A ~G is defined as r(A). [This is given for a subgraph A 
by the number of vertices of A, !V(A) !, minus its number of connected components, k(A) ]. 
For any subset A, the cardinality of A, !AI, denotes the number of points [edges] 
it contains. 
The co rank of A, c (A), is the non-negative integer r (G) - r (A), and the 
nullity of A, n(A), is the non-negative integer !A!-r(A). 
A subset of points A~G 
represents a spanning set for G if A= G [V(A) = V(G) and k(A) = k(G)]. A subset 
of points is independent [a forest] if r(A) = !AI [it contains no circuit]. 
Other-
wise, r(A) < !AI and A is dependent. An independent spanning set is called a basis 
[spanning forest, or, in the case of a connected graph, spanning tree]. 
A circuit 
[circuit] is a minimal dependent set. 
Two pregeometries are isomorphic [2-isomor-
phic] denoted G~ H if there is a 1 -
1 correspondence, f, between the points of 
.G and H and the circuits of G and H such that for any point p and circuit C, 

229 
p e: C iff f (p) e: f (C), 
[This is weaker than graphical isomorphism: if G and H are 
two isomorphic graphical pregeometries then the corresponding graph G can be made 
graphically isomorphic to H by a sequence of operations co3sisting of separating 
and/or reconnecting G at a cutpoint or by separating G into subgraphs G1 and G2 at 
any two vertex cut set and reconnecting at the same vertices in the opposite order. 
Hence for three-connected graphs, graphical and geometric isomorphism are equivalent.] 
The (Whitney) dual [planar dual] of G, G*, is the unique pregeometry on the same 
pcint set with a set of bases consisting of base complements of G. [It is a cele-
brated theorem of Tutte [7] that a graphical pregeometry has a graphical dual if and 
only if it is planar in which case the dual is the usual graph-theoretic one.] 
We say G is the direct sum of two pregeometries G1 (!;) G2 if the points of G and 
circuits of G, C(G), are the disjoint unions G1 l.:J G2 and C(G1) l.:J C(G2) respectively; 
G is then said to be a direct sum factor [block] of G, and G is termed separable with 
flats G1 and Gz as separators. 
If no such nontrivial direct sum decomposition [block 
decomposition] exists, any two distinct points of G are contained in a circuit andG 
is termed connected [two-connected]. A one-point direct sum factor, p, is eithercon-
tained in no circuits and termed an isthmus [isthmus or bridge], I, or is itself a 
circuit and termed a loop [loop], L. A point is a non-factor if it is neither a loop 
nor an isthmus. A Boolean algebra [forest] Bn is a geometry which is the direct sum 
of n isthmuses. 
For p e: G we define two derived pregeometries on the point set {G}- {p}: the de-
letion G- p [subgraph G- p] and the contraction, G/p [contraction and removal of the 
edge p]. If A C {G}- {p}, and A denotes its closure in G, then the closure of A in 
G-p is defined as A-{p}; while its closure in G/p is defined as AU{p}-{p}. [Gra-· 
phically this amounts to identifying to a new vertex v the vertices v and v' inci-
dent with p while connecting to v any edge formerly incident with v or v', and de-
leting the loop from the resulting multigraph.] An arbitrary sequence of contrac-
tions and deletions leads to a minor [homomorphic subgraph] of G. We then have 
G* - p = (G/p)* and G*/p = (G- p)*. 
A geometry is binary if it can be represented as a set of vectors in a vector 
space over the field with two elements with closure corresponding to linear closure. 

230 
A theorem of Whitney [7] states that a pregeometry is binary if and only if it has 
no minor consisting of a rank-two geometry with four rank-one flats (a four-atom 
line). 
Graphical geometries are binary. 
An invariant is a function f defined on the class of all pregeometries such 
that f(G)=f(H) if G~H. 
Examples of invariants used in this paper include 
C(G), the complexity or 
number of bases of G; the subgeometry generating function 
S(G) = L aij uivj 
where 
i,j 
aij is the number of subgeometries or subsets [subgraphs] of G with corank i and 
nullity j; and 
p(G) , the M~bius function which is defined as 
p(O,l) 
evaluated 
on the geometric lattice L, where for 
x .::_ y, ,p(x,y) is given by the recursion: 
p(x,x) = 1, p(x,y) = 
L p(x,z). 
Two other invariants evaluated on L are the 
x.::_z<y 
characteristic polynomial 
x(G,A) = x(G) 
L p(O,x)Ar(l)-r(x) if G is loopless 
X£L 
and 0 otherwise, and the Crapo invariant 
B(G) 
[1]. 
[The chromatic polynomial 
X (G) 
of a graph is given by the formula X (G) = Ak(G) x(G) 
(see, e.g. [1]) .] 
3. 
THE HYPERPLANE [VERTEX] RECONSTRUCTION PROBLEM 
Definition 3.1. 
A pregeometry G is hyperplane reconstructible if there is no non-
isomorphic pregeometry with the same set of hyperplanes. 
Conjecture 3.2. 
A binary (in particular graphic) pregeometry is hyperplane recon-
structible. 
This is related to the Ulam conjecture since for a graph G and vertex v, the 
subgraph G - v 
of G with all edges incident with v removed is a hyperplane (the 
complement of a vertex cutset). 
The two differences with the Ulam conjecture when 
(3.2) is applied to graphical pregeometries is that in (3.2) all hyperplanes are 
given; and that we only know those hyperplanes (and can only reconstruct G) up to 
2-isomorphism. 
However, we may modify (3.2) so that it will agree more closely with 
the Ulam conjecture. 

231 
Conjecture 3.3. 
A binary (or graphic) pregeometry of known cardinality and rank 
is reconstructible from its connected hyperplanes. 
We note that for a graph any hyperplane which does not come from the deletion 
of a vertex bond is separable and while the converse is false in general it is true 
for three-connected graphs (in which case all vertex hyperplanes are two-connected 
and hence geometrically connected), 
If in fact the graph is four-connected then 
the connected hyperplanes are three-connected and their geometric structure strictly 
determines their graphical structure. 
Hence in this case we have a precise reformu-
lation of the Ulam conjecture: 
Conjecture 3.4 (Ulam). 
A geometry which is represented by a four-connected graph 
is reconstructible from its connected hyperplanes. 
The following counterexample shows that (3.2) is false in general for geometries . 
• 
• • 
Example 3.5. 
The geometries given by the affine diagrams 
and 
• 
• 
• 
~ 
have isomorphic hyperplane structures (two three points lines and 
nine two points lines) but are not isomorphic. 
Other related problems can be posed. 
For example, what geometric invariants 
can be recovered from the set of hyperplanes. 
Even the number of points seems 
to be a nontrivial proposition (although the number of edges of a graph is easily 
recoverable from its set of vertex deletions). 
Another useful invariant it would 
n 
n-1 
be nice to recover is the characteristic polynomial x(G) = 
I. 
+an_1 >.. 
+ ... +a1>..+1J. 
However, even the M~bius function, 
a0 , seems difficult; the only coefficient 
easily recoverable being 
a1 = L~(H) the sum being taken over all hyperplanes. A 
class of geometries for which the characteristic polynomial (in fact the subgeometry 
generating function) is recoverable is the class of Hartmanis partitions (cf. 7.9 
of [1)). 
A much more optimistic situation exists for edge reconstructions. 
4. 
THE DELETION (EDGE] RECONSTRUCTION PROBLEM 
Definition 4.1. 
A pregeometry G is deletion reconstructible if no nonisomorphic 
pregeometry has the same multiset or deck]) of deletions 
{G - Pi I Pi e: G} . 

232 
Conjecture 4.2. 
A pregeometry which is not a circuit or Boolean algebra is deletion 
reconstructible. 
We excepted circuits and Boolean algebras since 
Bn 
and an n-point circuit 
have isomorphic decks (n Boolean algebras of cardinality n- 1). 
However, these 
e~ceptions should give graph theorists no pause as trees are graphically reconstruc-
tible from edge deletions [3] as are circuits for n > 3. 
Proposition 4.3. A pregeometry G is an (n-point) circuit en or an (n-element) Boo-
lean algebra Bn iff all (n) deletions are Boolean algebras (of rank n- 1). 
Proof. 
If all deletions of 
G are Boolean algebras,the nullity of 
G, 
n(G), is 
at most 1 since 0 = n(G-p) > n(G) - 1. If the nullity of G is one, then G = Ck <±> Bn-k. 
But if 0 < k < n, 
Ck 
would appear as a subgeometry of at least one of the {G - p}. 
We will henceforth assume in what follows that G is never a Boolean algebra. 
Proposition 4.4. G (IBn) 
has an isthmus iff r(G-p) < r(G-p') for some p I p' 
in 
which case G ~ I (t) (G-p) 
where I represents an isthmus. 
Proof: 
A point p is an isthmus of G iff r(G) = r(G-p) + 1. 
Since not all points 
are isthmuses, for some (any) nonisthmus p', r(G) = r(G-p'). 
But an isthmus is a 
direct sum factor so if p is an isthmus of G, G '::t I G) (G-p). 
In light of (4.3) and (4.4) we will now consider only those pregeometries 
(including circuits) without isthmuses so that r(G) = r(G-p) 
and hence 
n(G) = n(G-p) + 1 
for all pEG . 
Not only are geometries with isthmuses recon-
structible but suitable modifications (involving changing the corank for subsets 
of isthmus deletions) will make the following theorem (4.6) applicable to such geom-
etries. 
Theorem 4.5. 
The subgeometry generating function 
S(G) 
is the unique polynomial 
function defined on all pregeometries with the following properties: 
S(G) = S(G-p) + S(G/p) for all nonfactors p 
S(G <±)H) 
S (G) S (H) 
S(I) 
u + 1 for an isthmus I 
S(L) 
v + 1 for a loop L. 

233 
In addition, 
S (G) 
gives the following information about G: 
1. 
s (1,1) 
counts the number of subsets [subgraphs] = 21GI. 
2. 
S(O,O) 
counts the number of bases [spanning forests], C(G). 
3. 
s (1 ,0) 
counts the number of independent sets [forests]. 
4. 
s (0,1) 
counts the number of spanning sets. 
5. 
S(0,-1) = 1~(0,1) I, the absolute value of the M6bius function of G. 
6. 
as/aulu=-1, v=-1 
~(G), the Crapo invariant which is 0 iff G is separable 
(or a loop) and is 1 iff G is a (connected) series-parallel network. 
7. 
(-l)r(G)S(-A,-1) = x(G,A), the characteristic polynomial of G. 
8. 
(-l)n(G)S(-1,-A) 
x(G*,A). 
9. 
In particular if G is graphic: 
(-l)r(G)Ak(G)~(-A,-1) counts the number of 
ways to properly (vertex) color G with A colors (where k(G) is the number 
of connec'ted components of G). 
10. 
(-l)n(G)AS(-1,-A) counts the number of ways to properly color the regions 
of G (a planar map) with A colors. 
11. 
S(l,-1) counts the number of ways to acyclically orient the edges of G. 
Proof: 
These along with other properties of S can be inferred from [1] where they 
are all proved in terms of the Tutte polynomial t(G) = S(z-l,x-1). Statement llof 
The«>rem 4. 5 can be found in [ 6] . 
Theorem 4.6: 
If G has no isthmuses the subgeometry generating function of G can 
be reconstructed from the subgeometry generating functions of all its deletions 
by the formula: 
S(G) 
VN + L 
J> 
where ]) is the deck of del:etions of G; 
p 
~ 
ui) 
L N+i-j 
i,j

L S(G-p; ut, vt )dt 
:/) 
is the number of subsets of G - p 
with corank i and nullity j; and N is the nullity of G(N • n(G-p) + 1). 
~: The integral representation for 
S(G) 
is easily seen to be equivalent to 
the summation representation and is due to Professor L. Geissinger. 

234 
If A is a sub geometry of G, it appears in exactly those G - p with p • A. 
Further the geometric structure of both A and G - p is given by internal calcu-
lations in the supremum subsemilattice of L(G) generated by A and G - p 
respec-
tively. 
Hence if p 4 A, the rank and cardinality of any subset A is the same 
when viewed in G or G- p. 
But since r(G) a r(G-p) 
for all p,the corank and 
nullity of A is also the same when computed in either G or 
G - p. 
If the corank of A is i and its nullity is j, A contributes uivj 
to S(G) 
uivj 
and contributes N+i-j 
exactly 
IGI -
IAI = r(G) + n(G) - r(A) - n(A) = N + i - j 
times to the right-hand expression. Note that N + i -
j is always positive unless 
A = G in which case i = 0 and j = N. 
Hence we see that all the invariants in (4.5) can be computed from the deck. 
Example 4.7. 
Let G be the geometry represented in real affine space by the diagram 
L_ wi<h graphioal repreoen<<eion <1> . 
Hm <he dook of dele<!=' '' 
!J. 4(/.J+: :[- 4 ( ~)

'o<ho< N = 2 and 
L S(G-p) = 4(u3 + 4u2 + 6u + uv + 3 + v) + u3 + 4u2 + 6u + 4 + v 
.J) 
= Su3 + 20u2 + 30u + 4uv + 16 + Sv. 
Therefore, 
S (G) .= u3 + Su2 + lOu + 2uv + 8 + Sv + v2• 
Hence, for example, 
C(G) = 8, there are 24 independent sets, and 
X(G) = A) -
5A2 + 8A - 4 so that x(G) ~ A4 -
5A3 + 8A2 -
4A • 
The graph has 
18 acyclic orientations, and as a planar map, the regions have chromatic poly-
nomial 
A3 -
3A2 + 2A 
Conjecture 4.8. If G and Hare binary (or graphic) and 
S(G) = S(H), then G-::::"H. 
Note that (4.8) implies (4.2) since 
S(G) 
is recoverable from 2). 
Finally, if we rephrase each conjecture and theorem to 
G* 
and dualize back, 
we note that everything holds for pregeometries which are not all loops if we 
replace deletion by (point) contraction where in (4.6) we must interchange the 
roles of corank and nullity as well as A and 
G - A so that 

where r is the rank of G and 
corank i and nullity j.

ON TRIANGULAR AND CYCLIC RAMSEY NUMBERS WITH k COLORS 
Let G be a finite graph and k be a positive integer. 
Define r(G;k) 
to be 
the smallest integer with the following property: 
For any n ~ r(G;k), color the 
edges of 
Kn 
in k colors; then there exists a monochromatic graph isomorphic to G. 
The existence of 
r(G;k) 
is assured by Ramsey's theorem [1,2]. 
In the case of G ~ K3 and 
k = 2 , r(K3;2) = 6 • This is one of the most 
interesting fundamental problems that appeared in Putnam Mathematics Competition 
[3] in 1953. 
The problem can be stated as follows: 
Color the edges of K6 in red 
or blue; then either a red triangle or a blue triangle exists. 
In 1955 Greenwood and Gleason [4] proved that r(K3;3) = 17 
and 
r(K3;4) > 41. 
The value of r(K3;4) is still unknown. 
Whitehead and Taylor [5] proved that 
r(K3;4) > 49 
in 1971. In 1972, G. J. Porter (unpublished) and the author [6] proved 
independently that r(K3;4) > 50 and a lower bound for r(K3;k) was ob~ained. A 
simpler proof will now be presented. 
Theorem 1. 
Let f(k) 
of x3 + 6x2 + 9x - 1 
r(K3;k)- 1 and lett= 0.103 •.. be the only positive root 
0 and C 
sot2 = o.s4s4 
Then f(k+l) ~ 3f(k) + f(k-2) 
for k > 3 and f(k) > (3+t)k C. 
We need the following lemma. 
Lemma 1: 
The edges of 
Kn 
can be colored in k colors without any monochromatic 
triangle if and only if its adjacency matrix 
A n 
is the sum of k symmetric binary 
matrices Ml' M2, ..• , ~

and Mi2 is zero 
An= Ml + M2 + ••• +~and (Ml*Mi2)jm= (Mi)jm(Mi2)jm=O 
~: If the edges of

are colored in k colors without monochromatic triangles, 
then define

Proof of theorem. 
The edges of Kf(k) can be colored in k colors withoug monochro-

Since the complete graph K3f(k) + f(k-2) can be colored in k+l colors without 
any monochromatic triangle, 
f(k+l) ~ 3f(k) + f(k-2) 
for 
k > 3. 
From the above inequality we can get f(k) > (3+t)k C where

is [k!e] + 1 • 
Whitehead [5] 
proved 
r(K3;4) ~ 65

Theorem 2. 
r(1<:3;k) ~ [k! (e-1/24)] + 1. 
From Theorems 1 and 2, we know that the limit of k'th root of f(k) 
will be 
between 
3+t and oo if it exists. 
Lemma 2. 
f(jk) ~ (f(k))j. 
is 
Proof. 
Let 
f(k) = n 
so that the edges of 
K n 
can be k-colored without any mono-
chromatic triangles. 
Define Kuj with vertices the vectors (i1,i2, ... ,ij), is 
1,2, ..• ,n. 
Let 
cs, s = l, ..• ,j,m=l, •.. ,k, be the jk colors available. 
The edge joining (i1,i2, ••. ,ij) and 
(il, iz, .•• , ij) is colored in the 
color cjm if and only if i 1 = il' ..• , ij-l = ij, ij + ij 
and the edge joining 
ij and ij has color m. 
It is clear that this gives a coloring of edges of K . without any monochromatic 
nJ 
triangle in kj colors. 
Therefore 
f (j k) ~ (f (k)) j . 
Theorem 3. 
lim (f(k))l/k exists.

Let x = lim sup (f(k))l/k 
There exists an integer m such that

r(c4 ;k) ~ k /16 for infinitely many k's. 
The proof is established by an explicit construction.

THE MINIMALITY OF THE MYCIELSKI GRAPH

ABSTRACT 
It is proved that the smallest 4-chromatic triangle - free graph has eleven 
vertices and is unique. 

244 
THE MINIMALITY OF THE MYCIELSKI GRAPH 
Mycielski [6] constructed a sequence Gl,Gz, •.• ,Gk of graphs such that no Gk 
contains a triangle and each Gk is k-chroma~ic. 
(The existence of graphs with 
~prescribed girth and chromatic number has been established by ErdBs [3]; an 
explicit construction of such graphs has been given by Lovasz [5].) 
~remark 
that Mycielski's graph G4 is the unique triangle-free 4-chromatic graph with at 
most eleven vertices. 
The purpose of this note is to give a complete proof of 
this st~te, which is a stronger statement than that in Harary [4], since uniqueness 
is shown here. 
Figure 1 
Let G = (V,E) be a triangle-free 4-chromatic graph with at most eleven vertices. 
Let u be a vertex of largest degree in G and let A be the set of neighbours of u. 
By Brooks' theorem [1], we have \A\~ 4 (otherwise G is 3-colorable). 
Besides, A 
is an independent set (otherwise G contains a triangle). 
Next, set B = V- {u} -A, 
so that \B\ 
= JvJ - 1 -
\A\ ~ 6. 
The subgraph of G induced by B is triangle-free 
and 3-chromatic (otherwise B ~{u} can be colored by two colors and A by a third 
one). 
Therefore B contains a 5-cycle (so that \A\ = \V\ - 1- \B\ ~ 5). 
Let its 
vertices (in the natural cyclic order) be u1,uz,u3,u4,u5 • 
Case 1. 
\A\ = 5. 
Firstly, let us assume that given any i, there is always a v £A 
which is adjacent to both ui and ui+2 (with addition modulo five). 
Then G must 
contain the graph G4• 
Since the addition of any new line to G4 creates a triangle, 
we conclude that G = G4 . 

245 
Now, we may assume that no v E A is adjacent to both u1 and u3. 
(Note that 
each v E A is adjacent to at most two ui's (otherwise G contains a triangle). But 
then G can be colored in three colors as follows: 
u1 by 1, u2 by 3, u3 by 2, u4 
by 1, u5 by 2, each v E A by 1 or 2 and finally u by 3. 
Case 2. 
IAI = 4. 
The set V - {u} - A - {u1,u2,u3,u4,u5} includes at most one 
vertex; if there is such a vertex, denote it by w. 
First of all, we shall show 
that there is an i such that 
(i) 
w is not adjacent to ui, 
(ii) 
nov E A is adjacent to both ui-1 and ui+l• 
Since IAI = 4, there is at least one i satisfying (ii); without loss of generality, 
we may assume i 
2. 
and i = 3 satisfy (i). 
If w is not adjacent to u2, we are done. 
Otherwise both i = 1 
If neither i = 1 nor i = 3 satisfies (ii) then there are 
v', v" E A such that v' is adjacent to both u2,u5 and v" is adjacent to both u2 and 
u5 , and v" is adjacent to both u2 and u4 . To avoid the triangle v'u4u5 ,wemusthave 
v' "'v". But then u2 isadjacentto fivedistinctvertices (namely, u1,u3,w,v',v"), 
contradicting maximality of IAI. 
Now, we can assume that i = 2 satisfies both (i), (ii). 
Color w by 3 and the 
rest of G as in Case 1. 
The proof is finished. 
Now, let f(k) be the smallest number of vertices in a k-chromatic triangle-
free graph. 
If k ~ 4, Brooks' Theorem implies f(k) ~ 1 + k + f(k-1) and so 
On the other hand, a theorem due to ErdBs [4] yields 
f(k) < c(k log k)2 
for some absolute constant c. 
(k ~ 4).

ON THE RAMSEY NUMBER OF THE FIVE-SPOKED WHEEL

ABSTRACT 
Let r(W6) 
be the smallest n such that the five-spoked wheel w6<: G or 
else w6 CG for every graph G with n vertices. Recently, Erd~s asked whether 
whether r(W6) ~ 18; we prove that 17 ~ r(W6) ~ 20. 
In so doing, we establish 
that r(Cs , w6) = 13. 
We conjecture that r(W6) = 20.

ON THE RAMSEY NUMBER OF THE FIVE-SPOKED WHEEL 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
Let 
F1 , F2 be finite graphs without isolated vertices (for graph-theoretical 
definitions and notation, see [7]). 
By Ramsey's theorem [8], there is a positive 
integer n such that F1 C G or F2 C G holds for every graph G with n vertices. 
As in [2], we denote the smallest such n 
by r(F1 , F2); when F1 ~ F2 , we shorten 
this to r(F1) • 
In 1947, ErdBs [5] proved that 
r(Kn) > 2n/2 
for every n > 2. 
Chvatal and Harary [3] noticed that Erdos's technique yields 
(1) 
r(F)> {t) l/p 2q/p 
where 
s 
is the number of automorphisms of F, q is the number of edges and 
p is 
the number of vertices of 
F. 
Now, let F be n-chromatic. 
Then 
F contains a 
vertex-critical n-chromatic graph F0 
and each vertex of 
F0 has degree at least 
n- 1 [4]. 
Writing 
q0 for the number of edges and Po 
for the number of vertices 
of 
F0 , we have 
q0;p0 ~ (n-1)/2 
and so (1) yields 
r(F) ~ r(Fo) > c2n/2 
where 
c is a positive constant independent of n. Racently, Erdos conjectured that 
(2) 
r(F) ~ r(Kn) 
whenever 
F is n-chromatic. 
Evidently, (2) holds whenever 
n < 3 • 
(In fact, the 
inequality is strict.) 
Greenwood and Gleason [6] found that 
r(~) 
18, so the 
conjecture is that r(F) > 18 
for every 4-chromatic graph. 
If F has more than 
6 points, the coloring G = 3K6 
proves that r(F) > 18, for 
F ¢ G, 
and if 
F C G , 
then F is 3 colorable. 
Similarly, if K4 C F, 
we clearly have 
r(F) ~ r(K4) . 
Thus, it only remains to test the conjecture on 4-chromatic graphs 
with at most 6 points such that K4 cf: F. 
An exhaustive search reveals that there 
is only one graph: the 5-spoked wheel w6 (see figure 1). 
Thus, for 4-chromatic 
graphs, Erdos' conjecture will be verified if r(W6) ~ 18. 
We are going to show that

THE LOWER BOUND 
We define the neighborhood subgraph N(G;v) as the subgraph of graph G induced 
by the neighbors of point v. 
Now let G be the graph with vertex-set {1, 2, .•. ,8} 
x {1,2} where two distinct vertices (i, j), (r, s) are adjacent if and only 
if Ji-rl e: {0, 1, 4, 7}. We shall show that w6¢. G and w6cf:.'G. Firstly, assume 
that w6c G • Since the automorphism group of G is transitive, we may assume that 
(1, 1) is the hub of w6c G. That is, N(G; (1,1)) must contain c5 . The neighborhood 
subgraph N(G, (1,1)) is depicted in Figure 2; obviously it contains no c5 . Hence, 
w6¢ G. 
N(G; (1,1))

250 
Secondly, assume w6c"G. 
Again, it follows that N(G; (1' 1)) must contain 
cs . 
But this subgraph is bipartite as can be seen from Figure 3. 
Hence 
w6¢ G, and so r(W6 ) ~ 17.

THE UPPER BOUND 
In order to prove 20 is an upper bound, we must derive several preliminary 
results. First, we evaluate r(c5 , w6) • 
Next we prove two extremal results that 
if G has enough lines but no 
c5 , then G must be a bigraph. 
Theorems 4 and 5 
give conditions which force w6 C:G. Finally, we quote a result from [9] before 
presenting the main theorem. 
Theorem 1. r(c5 , w6) = 13. 
Proof. 
The graph 
3K4 
shows 
r(C5 , w6) > 12; we will show r(c5 , w6) < 13. 
Throughout the proof, 
G will denote a graph with 13 vertices such that c5 ~G 
and 
w6 ~G. We will establish, step by step, various properties of 
G and even-
tually arrive at a contradiction. 
Proposition 1. 
Each vertex of 
G has degree at least four. 
Proof. 
Assume that u 
has degree at most three. 
Then there are nine vertices of 
G that are not adjacent to u ; let them induce a subgraph H of 
G 
Since 
r(C5) • 9 (see [1]), we have either c5 C H C G or else c5C H , so that w6 CG 

251 
Proposition 2. 
K4 q: G 
Proof. 
Assume 
K4 c::; G 
By Proposition 1 and the hypothesis 
C 5 ¢: G , there must 
be a set S of 4 distinct points, each adjacent to just one point of K4 
Now two 
points of 
S cannot be adjacent, so each S-point must be joined to at least 3 of 
the remaining points. 
But then one of these points is adjacent to two S-points, 
forming c5 C G 
Proposition 3. 
Proof. 
Assume 
K4- x CG with points 
where 
and 
are 
not adjacent. 
The set S of points adjacent to K4- x 
must contain four distinct 
points, ui 
and 
wi adjacent to vi for 
i = 3 
and 4. 
If there are also two 
distinct points ui adjacent to vi for 
i = 1 
and 2, 
and 
cannot be 
adjacent to any previously labeled points (besides v1 
and v2) without forming 
c5 , 
Thus each is joined to two of the remaining 3 points, and so one of these 
last points w0 is adjacent to both. 
But then w0 u1 v1 v2 u2 is a c5 
On the 
other hand, if there is one point u1 
adjacent to v1 
and 
v2 , then u1 must be 
adjacent to at least two of the remaining points, say w1 
and w2 , both of which 
must be joined 
to each other as well as to the last two points a1 
and 
a2 • 
Since 
the degree of u3 is at least 4, the lines u3 a1 
and 
u3 a2 are forced, but this 
forms the cycle u3 a1 w1 w2 a2 • 
Proposition 4. 
K3 q: G • 
Proof. 
Let 
be a triangle in G 
Then by Proposition 3 there must be six 
distinct points ui , wi 
for 
i 
1, 2, 3 where ui and 
wi are adjacent to vi . 
Label the last 4 points a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 
Suppose u1 
is adjacent to w1 . 
Then 
by Proposition 3, no a-point may be adjacent to both u1 and w1 
Thus we may assume 
without loss of generality that a1 
and a2 are joined to u1 
and 
and 
are 
joined to 
But now no line from 
to an a-point is possible, 
which forces the a-points to comprise 
Thus there is no line 
Conse-
quently, each ui and 
wj 
is joined to 3 a-points, totaling 18 such lines. 
Thus, 
some 
is joined to 5 u-
or w-points, forming 

252 
Proposition 5. 
G is a bigraph. 
~· If not, 
G has a shortest odd cycle c2n+l with n ~ 3 • 
By Proposition 1, 
each point of this cycle must be joined to at least 2 of the remaining 12-2n points. 
But since 12-2n < 2n+l for n ~ 3 , this implies one of these remaining points is 
joined to 3 points on the cycle, forcing a shorter odd cycle. 
Thus 
G must have no 
odd cycles. 
But finally, if 
G is a bigraph with 13 points, we have w6 C ~ CG , and so 
no such graph G can exist. 
This completes the proof of Theorem 1. 
Theorem 2. 
If c5 ¢JH and 
H has 9 points and at least 16 lines, then H is a 
bigraph. 
Proof. 
We shall demonstrate that H must be a bigraph by assuming it is not and 
then deriving properties of 
H until a contradiction is reached. 
Proposition 6. 
~· If 
2K4 CH , the ninth point can have degree at most 2 since c5 ¢H . 
Consequently, there must be at least 2·lines joining the two copies of K4 , but 
such a pair of lines forces c5 C H 
Proposition 7. 
K4 U K4 ~ x ¢:H • 
Proof. 
We routinely find it impossible to add 5 lines joining K4 , K4- x , and 
K1 without producing c5 
Proposition 8. 
Let 
F be the graph K1, 3+ x 
formed by adding a line to the 
~· The ninth point cannot be joined to F by 3 lines without violating Propo-
sition 7. 
Furthermore, it can have only 1 line joining it to K4 since c5 q: H • 
Thus there are at least 3 lines joining K4 to F • 
To avoid forming c5 , this 
must be comprised of one point of the K4 adjacent to the three points in the tri-
angle in F • 
But again, adding 3 more lines to the ninth point forces a c5 • 

253 
~· There can be at most 3 lines joining K4 to K3 producing no c5 
Thus, 
there remain 4 lines incident with the last two points. 
By Proposition 8, none of 
these 4 can be incident with K3 , and so one of the last two points is adjacent to 
two points of K4 forcing c5 C H 
Proposition io. 
K4 ¢ H • 
Proof. 
Let 
S be the subgraph H-K4 • 
Since K3¢ S , c5 cJ: S , and 
S has 5 
points, we conclude that S is a bigraph. If S has 6 lines, then S • K2, 3 and 
each choice of 4 lines joining s to 
K4 
produces c5 • 
Similarly, if s has 5 
lines, then s • K2,3 -x and any 5 lines joining s to 
K4 
must produce c5 
Finally, if s has less than 5 lines, the 6 lines joining s to K4 
must include 
two incident with a single point of s , but this forms a 
c5 
Proposition 11. 
Proof. 
By assumption, 
H is not a bigraph, so if K3 ¢ H , and c5¢H , then 
H must contain an induced c7 
But now H has at least 8 lines joining c7 to 
the last two points, and so one of these points is adjacent to at least 4 points of 
c7 , forcing K3 C H • 
Proposition 12. 
K4 - x C H 
~· Let 
S • H-K3 • 
We assume K4- x ¢ S • By inspection, 
S has at most 9 
lines. If S has 9 lines, 
S = K3, 3 and cannot be joined to K3 by 4 lines with-
out producing c5 • If S has 8 lines, S must be K2,4 or K3,3- x , and in either 
case cannot be joined to K3 
by 5 lines. If S has 7 lines, either some point of 
S is joined to two points of 
joined to exactly 1 point of 
jacent to different points of 
2 or more in S produces a 
K3 
K3

K4-

, 
But notice that 
without forming 
containing one 
or else s has 6 points each 
two adjacent points cannot be ad-
c5 • 
Thus, any point with degree 
point of 
K3 
and 3 points of s . 
Finally, if S has less than 7 lines, one point of 
S must be adjacent to two points 
of K3 , completing the proof. 

254 
Proposition 13. 
Proof. 
Let 
S • H-(K4- x) • 
By Proposition 10, 
K4 ¢s , and we may assume 
Then we find that S has at most 6 lines. 
No point of 
S may be 
joined by two lines to K4-
x without forming either c5 or K2 + K3 
Thu13, we 
conclude that S has exactly 6 line!!, and each point of 
S 
il3 joined to one point 
in K4- x • 
As in the preceding proof, adjacent points in S must be joined to 
the same point in K4-
x • 
Since S has a point of degree 3 or more, 
H contain!! 
Proposition 14. 
Proof. 
Let 
S = H-K2 + K3 • 
If S has 5 lines, we find it impossible to join S 
and 
K2 + K3 without forming c5 
On the other hand, if S has fewer lines, one 
point of 
S must be joined to two points of 
K2 + K3 
forming 
K2 + K4 • 
But now it is easily seen to be impossible to join K2 + K4 to the other three 
points of 
H without forming c5 
This contradiction implies that our assumption 
that H is not a bigraph is wrong, proving Theorem 2. 
Theorem 3. If G has 10 points and at least 19 lines, c5 ci: G , and w6 ¢'G , 
then G is a bigraph. 
Proof. 
Assume 
G is not a bigraph and remove a point of minimum degree to obtain 
the subgraph 
H = G-v 
with at least 16 lines. 
By the previous theorem, 
H must 
be a bigraph. 
G must contain a triangle, for otherwise 
c7c c and there are 
10 lines joining the remaining 3 points to this cycle. 
Thus one point is joined 
to 4 points of c7 forcing a triangle. 
Of course this triangle must contain v, and 
so we conclude that v 
is joined to at least 2 adjacent points in H , say u1 
and 
The line 
must not lie in c4 c· H , for otherwise 
There are 
7 bigraphs with 9 points and 17 lines, but only K2 • K4 , 4 
(see [7, p. 23]) has a 
line (namely the endline) lying in no c4 • Thus G might be 
K-:3 • K4, 4 , but we 
observe that G ::J K6- X:::> w6 • 
On the other hand. if H has only 16 lines. the 
minimum possible number, then v must be joined to 3 points in H, say u1 and u2 in 
the same set, and w1 adjacent to u1 • 
With some effort, we find the 18 possible 

255 
bigraphs with 9 points and 16 lines, ~ut only 4 of them (formed by adding an 
endline in either of 2 ways to either 
K3,5 or K4 , 4 - x) have a line lying in no 
c4 • 
In all four cases, the line vu2 forces an occurrence of 
C5 • Thus our 
assumption was incorrect, and so G must be a bigraph. 
Theorem 4. 
~· Let 
S be the subgraph induced by the points not contained in the induced 
i 5 C G , and assume w6¢c . Now each point of 
S is joined to at least 3 points 
of 
K5 
to prevent forming 
w6 CG 
Moreover, if S has less than 3 lines, 
w6 CS CG , so we may assume s has at least 3 lines. 
Let 
be one line 
of 
S • 
If any point of 
S has 4 lines joining it to 
K5 , 
v1 v2 lies in c5 • 
On the other hand, if every point of 
S is adjacent to exactly 3 points of K5 , 
and c5 ¢ G , 
then G minus the lines of 
S (except for v1 v2) must be the graph 
formed by identifying a point of K2 + K3 with a point from K3,p_7 as shown in 
Figure 4. 
But adding the second of the three lines known to be in S must form 
c5 • 
This contradiction implies w6 C G • 
p-7 ~ 4 
Figure 4 
Theorem 5. If c5 ¢ G and 
G has 12 points and at least 26 lines (or 11 points 
and at least 22 lines), then w6 C G • 
~-
Let H = G-v0 be the subgraph obtained by removing a point of v0 of 
minimum degree from 
G • 
Then H has 11 points and at least 22 lines, so we pro-
ceed with one proof for both the 11 and 12 point versions. 
We may assume H is 
not a bigraph since otherwise 
w6 C K6 CH . 

256 
Case 1. 
If H is not regular, then H has a subgraph H' = H-v1 with at 
least 19 lines. 
Now by Theorem 3, 
H' 
is a bigraph, and so 
K5 CH'CH. 
Thus 
by Theorem 4, 
w6 CH . 
Case 2. 
If H is regular of degree 4, we proceed to specify properties of H 
until we force a contradiction. 
Proposition 15. 
K4 q: H • 
Proof. 
If K4 C:H , let S be the set of exactly 4 points each adjacent to a point 
of K4 , and let R be the last three points. 
Any line within 
S would create a 
c5 , so we must have 12 lines joining s to 
R . 
But now any two of these lines 
which are incident with the same R-point lie in a c5 • 
Proposition 16. 
K4-x<f:H. 
Proof. If K4- x CH , then 
S must have 5 or 6 points. If S has 5 points, we 
notice that the point adjacent to 2 points of 
K4 -x must also be joined to both of 
the last two points of 
H • 
But now any additional line joining one of these points 
to 
S 
forms a c5 . 
Similarly, if S has 6 points the S-point adjacent to one of 
the points with degree 3 in 
K4 - x 
cannot have degree 4 without forming c5 • 
Proposition 17. 
Let 
Since 
S has at most 
Proof. 
If F C H , then there are 8 lines joining F to 
S 
7 points, one point of 
S is adjacent to two points of 
F 
This must occur without 
forming c5 
or K4-x, and so we see that K3 • K3 C H. 
But now the graph 
R = H - K3 • K3 
has 6 points and 8 lines joining it to 
K3 • K3 
Two of these lines 
incident with the same point of 
R force an occurrence of either c5 or 
K4-x. 
Proposition 18. 
K3¢H • 
Proof. 
This is now trivial since H is regular of degree 4. If K3 C H , 
then 
F C:H 
But now we have shown that H is not a bigraph and 
H has no odd cycle of 
length 3 or 5. 
Hence 
H has an induced c7 , and so each of the remaining points 
is joined to at most 2 points on c7 • 
Thus, 
H has at most 
7 + 4 • 2 + 4 = 19 

257 
lines, a contradiction. 
That is, Case 2 cannot occur, and Theorem 5 has been proved. 
Let 
~(G) denote the sum of the number of triangles in G plus the number of 
triangles in G 
In other words, 
~ is the number of monochromatic triangles in the 
two-coloring of 
K p 
represented by 
G 
We also write 
~(v) for the number of 
monochromatic triangles containing the point v 
Note that 
3~(G) = ~~(vi) • 
Recall that N(G;v) is the graph induced by the points adjacent to v 
in G. Then 
clearly 
~(v) is the sum of the number of lines in N(G;v) 
plus N(G,v) . 
The next result is proved in [9]. 
Theorem 6. If dl ' d2 ' ... ' d 
denote the degrees of the points in G, 
then 
p 
~(G) = ( ~)

~ d (p - 1 - d )

Define v(v) 
the net number of monochromatic triangles containing v 
to be 
This definition is chosen so that 
(3) 
Thus, 
v(v) 
measures the difference between the number of monochromatic triangles 
containing v 
and the number of monochromatic triangles forced to be in G by the 
degree of v 
At last we have assembled the tools needed to prove the upper bound. 
Theorem 7. 
17 ~ r(W6) ~ 20 
Proof. 
The lower bound was demonstrated in the previous section. 
We now prove the 
upper bound. 
Assume 
G represents one color class of a two coloring of 
K20 
con-
taining no monochromatic w6 • 
We proceed to derive properties of 
G until we 
obtain a contradiction. 
Proposition 19. 
If v 
has degree 9 or 10, N(G;v) and N(G;v) cannot both be 
bigraphs. 
Proof. 
If both are bigraphs, then K5 CN(G;v) and 'K5 CN(G;v) as an induced sub-
graph. If any point of 
K5 is joined to 3 points of K5 , we have w6 C K6-
P3 C G , 

258 
so there are at most 10 lines joining K5 and Ks. Thus, some point of K5 is joined 
to at most 2 points of K5 forcing w6C ~- P3 C 
G • This contradiction proves the 
proposition. 
Proposition 20. 
G has at least 7 points of degree 9 or 10. 
Proof. 
We first establish upper bounds on the value of v(v) depending upon d, the 
degree of v. 
This degree cannot be less than 7 (or greater than 12) without Theorem 
1 forcing a monochromatic W6 . 
If d = 7 or 12, we note that v (v) = ll (v) - 45. 
But 
as mentiDned above, ll is just the sum of the number of lines in N(G;v) and N(G;v). 
It can be shown that, for p ~ 6, the maximum number of lines in a graph not con-
taining c5 is the same as in Turan's Theorem for K3 (see [7, p. 17]). 
Applying this 
and Theorem 5, ll (v) .::_ 12 + 25 = 37, so that v (v) < - 8 • 
Similarly, if v has degree 
8 or 11, we compute that v(v) < 16 + 21 -
39 = -2. 
Finally, if d = 9 or 10, we 
recall Theorems 2 and 3 as well as Proposition 19 to conclude that \l(v) .::_ 
\l(v) .::_max {15 + 25, 20 + 18}. 
Thus v(v) .::_ 40- 36 = +4. 
By Equation (3) and 
the upper bounds just computed, we observe that at least one third of the points 
must have degree 9 or 10, completing the proof. 
Let v0 be a point of degree 9 or 10 whose v is maximal. 
By redefining G 
to beG if necessary, we may assume the degree is 10. 
Proposition 21. 
N(G; v0) cannot be a bigraph. 
Proof. 
Assume N(G; v0) is a bigraph. 
Then N(G; v0) is not a bigraph, and we 
proceed to estimate the total number of lines in G. 
Let N(G; v0) have 25-a lines. 
Note that this forces v(vo) .::_ 4-a. 
Of course, 
there are 10 lines joining v0 to N. 
Finally, just as in the proof of Proposition 
19, we observe that each point in N(G; v0) must be joined to at least 6 points in 
N(G; v0) to avoid forming W6 C 
K6 - P3 C 
G. Thus, there are at least 54 lines 
joining N(G; vo) and N(G; v0),and so G has at least 21 + (25-a) + 10 +54 
110-a 
lines. 
It is easy to see that for a given number of lines, our upper bound for 
LV(vi) is maximized by taking every point to have degree as close to the average as 
possible. 
(Otherwise adding 1 to the degree of a point of m~nimum degree and 
subtracting 1 from a point of a maximum degree is guaranteed to increase the bound 
for LV(vi)). 
Thus, if a= 0, the average degree is 11 and so LV(vi) .::_ 20(-2) = -40. 

259 
Since this sum must equal 0, a > 1. If a = 1, recall that now v(v) ~ 3 for 
points of degree 9 and 10, and so since the average degree is at least 10.9, we 
see that 
-30 < 0 
Thus 
a > 2 
If a = 2 , then d > 10.8 and 
LV(vi) ~ 16(-2) + 4(2) = -24 < 0 • 
Thus 
a > 3 
If a= 3, then d ~10.7, so that 
LV(vi) ~ 14(-2) + 6(1) = -22 < 0 , 
and so 
a > 4 
But if a '" 4 , then d ~10.6 and 
LV(vi) ~ 12(-2) + 0 = -24 < 0 . 
But a can be no larger, for otherwise v(v) < 0 for all v, and so LV(vi) < 0. This 
contradiction completes the proof of Proposition 21. 
Now if N(G; v0) is not a bigraph, then by Theorems 2 and 3, v(vo)~l5+18-36 
-3, 
violating the choice of v0. 
Thus N(G; v0) must be a bigraph and we proceed to 
estimate the number of lines in G. 
Proposition 22. 
Let N(G; v0) have 20-a lines. 
Then G has at most 86 + 2a lines. 
Proof. 
N(G; v0) has 36-(-20-a) = 16 +a lines, N(G; v0) has at most 18 lines, and 
there are 10 lines joining v0 to N(G; v0). 
Thus we will be through if we can show 
that there are at most 42+a lines joining N(G; v0) and N(G; v0). 
Assume G has 43+a 
such lines. 
If a point in N(G; vo) is joined to 3 points in K5C:N(G; vo). we have 
w6 c: K6 -P3C:G, so each point in N(G; v0) is joined to at most 6 points in 
N(G; v0). 
If some point is joined to 6 points, then there must be a second point 
joined to 5 points, again forcing w6C G. Thus, we may assume no point in N(G; vo) 
is joined by more than 5 lines to N(G; v0), and there are 3+a points, v1,v2··· ,v3+a 
joined to exactly 5 points. Each of these points must be joined by 2 lines to K5 
and by 3 to K4. 
Furthermore, if any two vi are joined to a different subset of 3 
points in K4, we have w6 C: K6 -P4CG. 
Label the omitted point v4+a 
We see 
that any line joining vi to vj for 1 < i < j ~ 4+a, forms a wheel, and so we have 
an induced K4+a. 
Now a = 0 or 1 for otherwise w6 C K4+a C G • If a = 1, the four 

260 
points v1, •.• ~v4 must each be joined by at most 2 lines to KsC:N(G; v0). 
Thus, 
some point w in K5 is joined to only 1 point of these 4. 
This forms a W6 in G on 
the points vvv2,v3,v4,v5,w. 
Thus a = 0, and we note that N(G; v0) 
K4, 5 . 
Now 
v1,v2, and v3 are joined to K5C:N(G; v0) by at most 6 lines, and there are no 
lines joining v4 to K5• 
Thus K5 has two points w1 and w2 joined by at most 2 lines 
to v1 ,v2,v3, forcing W6C:G with point set {v1 ,v2,v3,v4,w1 ,w2}. 
This final contra-
diction completes the proof of this proposition. 
Proposition 23. 
If v1 has degree 9, then v(vl) < v(v0). 
Proof. Since v0 was chosen to have maximal v, assume v(v1) = v(v0) ~ 0. 
Now if 
N(G; v1) is a bigraph, we could replace G by G and v0 by v1 violating Proposition 
21. 
Thus N(G; v1) is not a bigraph. 
Then v(v1) ~ 0 requires that N(G; v1) is a 
bigraph. 
Furthermore, the 2 sets of points in N(G; v1) must have sizes 4 and 5, 
for otherwise w6C K6C NC G. But can such a point exist? If v1 £ N(G; v0), 
then v1C: K4 , so that K3C: N(G; v1), 
Thus, v1 must lie in N(G; vo), 
Let vl be 
joined ton other points in N(G; v0) and to 8-n points in N(G; vo), 
Observe that 
these n points must induce~ for otherwise 2 adjacent points plus v0 form a tri-
angle in N(G; v1). 
Now n .::_ 5 for otherwise K6C:G. If n = 5, v1 is joined to 3 
points in N(G; v0). 
Two of these must be adjacent, so this pair contributes one 
point to each set of vertices in the bigraph N(G; v1), 
But since we already had 
K5C:N(G; vl) n N(G; Vo) this again provides K6C: G. 
If n = 4, then vl is also 
joined to 4 points in N(G; v0), which either forces K3C: N(G; v1) or else contri-
butes 2 points to each set again forming K6C: G. 
Finally, if n .::_ 3, the 5 lines 
joining v1 to N(G; v0) force a triangle in N(G; vl), 
Thus, we have shown that 
no point of degree 9 can have v equal to v(v0). 
We now conclude the proof. 
If a= 0 , 
G has 86 lines, and the maximum esti-
mate for L v(v i) 
occurs when we choose 12 points of degree 9 and 8 of degree 8 to obtain 
LV(vi) .::_ 8(-2) + 12(1) = -4 < 0 
If a = 1 , then G has 88 lines, 
v(v0) < 1 , and points of degree 9 have v(v1) .::_0. 
Then 
LV(vi) .::_ 4(-2) + 16(0) = -8 < 0 , 
If a= 2, then G has 90 lines, v(v0) .::_ 0, 
and points of degree 9 have v(v1) < -1 
Then 
LV(vi) .::_ 20(-1) = -20 < 0 .The value 
of a can be no larger without forcing 
v(v0) 
to be negative. 

261 
Thus the graph G cannot exist, and so 
r(W6) < 20.

ABSTRACT 
We define the Hamiltonian completion number of a graph G, denoted hc(G), 
to be the minimum number of lines that need to be added to G in order to make it 
Hamiltonian. 
The Hamiltonian completion problem asks for hc(G) and a specific 
Hamiltonian cycle containing hc(G) new lines. 
We derive an efficient algorithm 
for finding hc(T) for any tree T, and show that if S is the set of spanning 
trees of an arbitrary connected graph G, then 
hc(G) = min 
hc(Ti) 
Ti~s 
A number of other general results are presented including an efficient heuristic 
procedure which can be used on arbitrary graphs.

ON THE HAMILTONIAN COMPLETION PROBLEM 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
The Hamiltonian completion number of a graph G, denoted hc(G), is the 
minimum number of lines which need to be added to G to make it Hamiltonian. 
By 
definition, 0 2 hc(G) 2 p, where p is the number of points in G. 
The desirability of completing a graph in the above sense arises naturally 
in problems involving routing and the periodic traversal and updating of data 
structures. 
The Hamiltonian completion problem is a special case of the traveling 
salesman problem in which each line in G is assigned a weight of 0 and each line 
in Kp not in G is given a weight of 1. 
This relationship can be used to show 
that the problem is a member of Karp's polynomial complete class of difficult 
computational problems [1]. 
This approach to the completion problem is being 
pursued elsewhere. 
An equivalent formulation of the completion problem for non-Hamiltonian graphs 
involves the notion of island decomposition. 
An island decomposition of a graph G 
is an acyclic spanning subgraph of G in which every point has degree 2 2. 
An 
island decomposition is essentially a collection of point disjoint paths (islands) 
that cover the points of G. 
An isolated point can be a member of such a set. 
Let 
i(G) denote the minimum number of islands and ~(G) the maximum number oflihesin any 
island decomposition of G. 
Then it is not difficult to show the next statement. 
Lemma 1. 
For any graph G having p points 
i) 
i(G) + t(G) = p, and 
ii) either G is Hamiltonian or i(G) • hc(G). 
Lemma 1 shows that we can now Hamilton thread the i(G) islands into a Hamil-
tonian cycle with the addition of i(G) new lines. 
Note that this approach 
cannot distinguish between a Hamiltonian cycle and a Hamiltonian path in G. 
In 
both cases we get i(G) = 1, although hc(G) • 0 if G has a Hamiltonian cycle. 
In 
what follows we assume G is connected (the generalization is immediate). 

264 
As far as we can tell, the Hamiltonian completion problem has never been 
formally studied as such. 
The superficially related problem of a minimum line 
cover of a graph by line disjoint paths has attracted some recent attention (cf. 
[2]); and the problem of finding a point disjoint path cover for the point set of 
a graph has been independently studied in a different context by Boesch, Chen 
and McHugh [3] in a paper first presented at this conference. 
2. 
THE HAMILTONIAN COMPLETION NUMBER OF A TREE 
This is one of the few problems involving paths and cycles where the solution 
for trees is not straightforward. 
However, we can construct an efficient algorithm 
for finding hc(T) for any tree T with p points. 
A very similar algorithm has been 
independently developed by Boesch, Chen and McHugh [3] which is presented in 
these proceedings. 
The proofs are different. 
Our proof is based on the following 
three lemmas. 
Lemma 2. 
Let T be a tree and let v be an endpoint of T which is adjacent to a 
point u of degree 2 in T. 
Then hc(T) = hc(t-v). 
Proof. 
Consider tne graph T-v. 
Assume that T-v is threaded with hc(T-v) 
threads. 
Since u is an endpoint of T-v, at least one thread (and possibly two) 
will be incident with point u. 
Let such a thread be uw. 
By re-directing this 
thread uw to vw in T we will produce a Hamilton threading of T with hc(T-v) threads. 
Hence hc(T) ~ hc(T-v). 
Converselv, let T be threaded with hc(T) new lines. 
Since v is an endpoint of 
T,at least one thread, and possibly two, must be incident with v. 
Case 1. 
One thread, say wv is incident with v. 
In this case the correspond -
ing Hamiltonian walk must at some point proceed from w to v to u. 
Thus by re-direct-
ing wv to wu we will obtain a Hamilton threading of T-v with hc(T) threads. Hence 
hc(T-v) ~ hc(T). 
Case 2. 
Two threads, say w1v, vw2, are incident with v. 
In this case, by 
adding a thread (if necessary) between w1 and w2 we will obtain a Hamilton threading 
of T-v with no more than hc(T)- 1 threads. 
Thus hc(T-v) < hc(T). 

265 
Lemma 3. 
Let u and v be endpoints of a tree T both of which are adjacent to a 
point w of degree ~ 3. 
Then 
hc(T-{u,v,w}) 
hc(T) - 1 • 
Proof. 
In everything that follows, we adopt the convention that hc(Kl) 
hc(K2) = 1. 
This handles the cases where T-{u,v,w} is either K1 or K2 . 
We first show that hc(T) ~ hc(T-{u,v,w}) + 1. 
Assume that T-{u,v,w} has been 
Hamilton threaded with hc(T-{u,v,w}) threads. 
Since this threading uses at least 
one thread, call it w1w2, we can eliminate it and add two new threads w1u and vw2 
and produce a threading of T with hc(T- {u,v,w}) + 1 threads, i.e., 
hc(T) ~ hc(T-{u,v,w}) + 1 
In order to establish the reverse inequality (and therefore equality), we 
will show that any threading of T with hc(T) threads can be modified to produce a 
threading nf T-{u,v,w} with at most hc(T) - 1 threads. 
Any threading of T with hc(T) threads must place at least one thread adjacent 
to point u and one thread adjacent to point v. 
There are 11 possible threadings 
involving points u and v; these are illustrated in Figure 1. 
The heavy lines 
denote lines of T, the lighter lines denote threads in a completion solution for 
T, and the dotted lines denote threads in a candidate completion solution for 
T-{u,v,w}. 
For example, in Figure 1(1) an optimum completion solution forT 
requires the addition of four new lines through u,v,w while that solution can be 
modified for T-{u,v,w} so as to include only three new lines. 
By inspection one 
can see that in all cases, hc(T-{u,v,w}) ~ hc(T) - 1. 
Note that a certain number 
of point coalescences are possible, e.g. Figure 1(12) shows a coalesence of 
Figure 1 (1). 
However, such cases do not change the thread counts adversely.

We define: 
Operation A. 
Remove from T any endpoint u of T which is adjacent to a point 
v of degree 2 in T. 

267 
Lemma 4. 
Let T be a tree and let T* denote the tree which results from T by 
repeatedly applying Operation A above until it can no longer be applied. 
Then T* 
either equals K2 or contains two endpoints u and v which are both adjacent to a 
point w of degree~ 3 in T*. 
Proof. 
Clearly if T consists only of a single path, i.e., has no points of 
degree ~ 3, then T* = K2. 
On the other hand, if T contains at least one point of 
degree ~ 3, then T* will contain at least one point of degree ~ 3. 
In this case, 
let u1 be any endpoint of T*. 
By definition ofT*, u1 must be adjacent to a point 
u2 of degree~ 3 in T*. If u2 is adjacent to another endpoint then we are done. 
If 
u2 is not adjacent to a second endpoint, let u3 + u 1 be a point adjacent to u2. 
If" u3 has degree 2, let u4 be the other point ad.1acent to u3. 
By definition, 
u4 cannot be of degree 1. 
If u4 has degree 2 then we continue on to the other point 
us which is adjacent to u4. 
Continuing in this wav we ultimately must reach a point 
say ui' having degree ~ 3. 
If this point ui is ad1acent to t~10 endpoints then we 
are done. 
Otherwise, we continue on to one of the non-endpoints, say uj' adjacent 
to ui' considering as before the other points adjacent to uj. 
Continuing in this fashion down some path in T we ultimately must reach a point 
v of degree~ 3 which is adjacent to two endpoints ofT. 
This follows from the 
finiteness of T*, the fact that T* has no cycles and the fact that T* has no end-
points which are adjacent to points of degree 2. 
We now introduce a second operation to be used in our algorithm: 
Operation B. 
Remove 
from tree T points u,v,w,where u and v are endpoints ad-
jacent to w ,and w has degree .2 3 in T. 
Our algorithm for determining hc(T) for any tree T can be given as follows. 
Algorithm A. 
S~ep 0. Set hc(T) = 0. 
Set G = T. 
Step 1. 
Apply Operation A to G, repeatedly, until it can no longer be applied. 
Step 2. 
Apply Operation B to G, increasing hc(T) bv one. 
Step 3. 
Remove from Gall isolated points and all isolated Kz's, increasing 
hc(T) by one for every such subgraph. 
Step 4. 
~epeat Steps 1, 2, and 3 until thev can no longer be applied and stop. 

268 
By Lemma 2, Step 1 does not alter the value of hc(T). 
Lemma 3 shows that the 
subgraph removed from G in Step 2 is an island in a completion solution for T and we 
count it as such. 
The removal of such an island may force the isolation of single 
points and these must also be counted as islands in the computation of hc(T). 
Lemma 
4 is necessary to justify the statement that Steps 1, 2, and 3 can be repeated until 
T is totally decomposed into islands. 
The above algorithm can be modified very easily to keep track of the islands 
produced in a Hamilton threading ofT. 
We illustrate this in ~igure 2.

The last two figures above show the five islands of T produced by Algorithm 
A with a corresponding Hamilton threading of T. 
To demonstrate that Algorithm A is bounded by O(p2) operations we proceed as 
follows. 
The repeated application of Operation A in Step 1 is O(p). 
This involves 
checking at most p points for being endpoints and applying Operation A at most O(p) 
times. 
Step 2 is also O(p). 
It essentially involves checking every current end-
point, dropping its label into an urn labelled with its adjacent point and then 
checking the urns to see if any have 2 or more labels in it. Step 3 is clearly 
bounded by O(p). 
Thus the number of operations in one iteration of Steps 1-3 can 
be expressed as a linear function of p. 
Since each such iteration reduces G by at 
least one point we never have to iterate more than O(p) times. 
Therefore Algorithm 
A is bounded by O(p2) operations. 
We suspect a better bound is possible. 
We conclude this section by presenting an easily computable and fairly tight 
upper bound for hc(T) for any tree T. 
The bound also holds for arbitrary graphs 
but is not as tight. 
A simple proof using induction can be given but is omitted. 
Proposition 5. 
For any graph G having p points, q lines and e endpoints, 
hc(G) ~ L 
(di -
2) + 1 = 2q - 2p + e + 1 , 
di>2 
where di is the degree of point vi in G. 
Corollary 5a. 
For any tree T, 
[~] ~ hc(T) < e - 1 , where [~] denotes the least 
integer greater than or equal to e/2. 
3. 
THE HAMILTONIAN COMPLETION NUMBER OF ARBITRARY GRAPHS 
Since the Hamiltonian completion problem is equivalent to a symmetric traveling 
salesman problem, it is quite possible that there is no polynomial time algorithm 
for finding hc(G) for an arbitrary graph G. 
However, some combinatorial search 
algorithms are much better than others, and to this end we present some theory which 
can greatly reduce the combinatorics involved in computing hc(G). 
Theorem 6. 
For any connected graph G, let S denote the set of all spanning trees 
of G. 
Then either G is Hamiltonian or hc(G) = min hc(Ti) . 
T{ S 
Proof. 
Clearly hc(G) < min hc(Ti). 
Tie:S 

270 
In order to establish the reverse inequality we only need to show that if G is 
Hamilton threaded with hc(G) threads, then there exists some soanning tree Tj of G 
for which the same hc(G) threads produce a Hamiltonian cvcle through the points of 
T1. 
But this is easy, for let W be a Hamiltonian cycle through the Hamilton threaded 
graph G. 
Color every line of G which is on this cvcle, say blue, and color everv 
thread red. 
Next, remove from G any uncolored line, say e, whose removal does not 
disconnect the graph G, i.e., G1 = G- e is a connected graph. 
Continue in this 
fashion, i.e., remove another uncolored line e2 such that G1 - e2 = G2 is a connected 
graph. 
By repeating this process until no more lines can be removed, without pro-
ducing a disconnected graph, we will obtain a spanning tree Tj of G which contains 
every blue line of H; hence hc(Tj) s, hc(G), completin~ the proof. 
It is possible to implement Theorem 6 usin~ a search algorithm which systemat-
icallv enumerates all the spanning trees of G. 
Some further information relatin~ spannin~ trees and completion numbers can be 
obtained by introducing the tree graph of a graph. 
Let the points of the ~ 
~ 
of Q, T(G), represent the spanning trees of G. 
Two points in T(G) are adjacent if 
and onlv if the corresponding spanning trees can be transformed into each other by 
removing exactly one line and replacing it with another. 
Theorem 7. 
LetT' and T" be two spanning trees which are adjacent in T(G). 
Then lhc(T') - hc(T") J 
$ 1. 
Prooi. 
If T' and T" are adjacent in T(G) then T" can be obtained by removing 
one line, say e' , from T' and adding one new line, say e", to T' -e' . 
Let he (T') ~ k 
and let P1, P2, ... , Pk, be the islands ofT' produced bv Algorithm A. 
Furthermore, 
assume that k = hc(T') < hc(T"). 
Consider what happens if vre remove a line e' from 
T' and add a new line e", therebv obtaining the tree T". 
Case 1. 
The line e' is not on any island P1,P2, ... ,Pk, i.e. e' is a brid~e be-
tween two islands. It follows in this case that bv removinp, e' and adding a new line 
e" that hc(T")::; hc(T'), which contradicts our hypothesis that hc(T') < hc(T"). 
Case 2. 
The line e' is on one of the islands P1,P2, •.. ,Pk, say P1. 
Then by 
removing e' we will produce k+l islands, P11 ,P12 , ... ,Pk. 
Adding a new line e" to 
T'-e' cannot increase further the number of islands in T", 
Thus hc(T") ;::: hc(T') + 1. 

271 
Corollary 7a. 
Let G be a connected unicyclic graph, let el,e2•···•ek be the 
lines on the onlv cvcle in r,, and let Ti = G- ei, i = l, ... ,k, be the spanning 
trees of G. 
Then for 1 ~ i, j 
~ k, 
lhc(Ti)- hc(Tj)l ~ 1. 
Proof. 
This follows since in this case the tree graph of G is the complete 
graph on k points, T(G) = ~· that is everv pair of spanning trees Ti and Tj are 
ad1acent in T(G). 
If a graph G is unicyclic, Corollarv 7a tells us that if we find any two span-
ninF; trees Ti and Tj such that hc(Ti) < hc(T1), then in fact hc(G) = hc(Ti). 
He 
suspect that there is a way of finding hc(G) for unicyclic graphs G bv just inspect-
ing the lines on the cycle. 
We conclude with an efficient heuristic algorithm for computing hc(G) for an 
arbitrary graph G. 
By a current labeling of a line uv in a graph H we mean the 
assignment of weight d(uv) = d(u) + d(v) -
2 to uv, where d(u) and d(v) are the 
de11;rees of points u and v in H. 
The algorithm finds a "good" (but not necessarily 
optimum) spanning tree of G. 
Algorithm B. 
Step 0. 
Let H = G. 
Step 1. Currently label all the lines of H. 
Step 2. 
Remove the line with the largest current label which does not discon-
nect H (in the case of ties, choose arbitrarily). 
Step 3. 
Repeat Steps 1 and 2 until H is a tree. 
Then compute hc(H) as an 
approximation to hc(G). 
Figure 3 illustrates Algorithm B; Figure 4 gives an example where Algorithm B 
does not necessarily find hc(G). 
The authors have made considerable, but unsuccessful, efforts to ascertain 
some of the properties of optimum spanning trees. 
Nothing seems to be true all 
the time. 
The situation is complicated by the fact that it is very hard to take 
even a modestly sized multi-cycled block, work out hc(G) in some ad hoc fashion, 
and have confidence in the result. 
We can only recommend Algorithm B as a good 
heuristic because 1) it is not easy to construct examples where it does not find 

272 
hc(G), and 2) such examples seem to require a fairly delicate positioning of their 
pieces.

COLORING SEVEN-CIRCUITS*

State University of New York at Binghamton 
ABSTRACT 
Recent work of Beraha, Hall, and Tutte has made it clear that it is interest-
ing to express the constrained chromials of planar graphs containing an open n-
circuit in terms of free chromials. 
This problem was solved for n 
4 and n = 5, 
and a partial solution given for n = 6 by Birkhoff and Lewis. 
The solution for 
the case n = 6 was completed by Hall and Lewis. 
There are 162 constrained 
chromials for the seven circuit. 
One of these has all 7 colors different, the 
remaining 161 divide themselves into 23 groups of seven each. 
The sum of the 
constrained chromials in each of these 23 groups is called a constrained rochromial. 
The sum of the corresponding 7 free chromials in each group is called a free 
rochromial. 
Equations are obtained expressing each of the constrained rochromials 
in terms of free rochromials. 
A new Beraha number appears exactly where it should.

COLORING SEVEN-CIRCUITS 
The chromial of a graph G is written P[G,n] and gives the number of ways in 
which the vertices of G may be colored using some or all of n given colors, with 
the restriction that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color. 
If the graph 
G contains a loop, then P[G,n] is identically zero. 
It is well known that P[G,n] 
is a polynomial in n of degree k, where k is the number of vertices of the graph G. 
Since P[G,n] is a polynomial, it has proven useful to consider properties of P[G,n] 
where n is not restricted to being an integer. 
Much work has been done along these 
lines by Tutte [6,7]. 
All graphs considered are assumed to be planar and connected. 
Perhaps the largest non-trivial chromial thus far published is that for the 
dual of the truncated icosahedron [3]. 
This is a polynomial of degree 32 which has 
8 real zeros. 
The four real zeros which are not integers are approximately

S. Beraha has pointed out that the sequence 
B n 
Bn 
2 + 2cos(2rr/n) 
defined by 
appears to be important in the study of chromials, and this sequence has come to be 
known as the sequence of Beraha numbers. 
It should be noted that B5 ,B7,B8,B9 are 
quite close to n1 ,n2,n3,n4 , respectively. 
In general, Beraha notes that there is 
an apparent tendency for the chromials of triangulations to have zeros close to 
Beraha numbers. 
Early in 1973 Tutte proved that all the Beraha numbers are impor-
tant in the theory of chromials [8]. 

275 
In an investigation of the zeros of chromials of planar triangulations, 
Tutte found that each of these chromials had a zero near 
3 +vs 
-2--
1" + 1 
= 2.6180339887, 
where 1" is the golden ratio. 
Accordingly, 1" + 1 became known as the golden root. 
Almost immediately Tutte pointed out the spectacular agreement between the golden 
root and n1 . 
He was later to prove that the golden root is never a zero of the 
chromial of a loopless planar graph. 
In a monumentally important paper [1] published in 1946, Birkhoff and 
Lewis presented an exhaustive study of chromials. 
The portion of that paper 
which we are presently interested in is their introduction of the concept of a con-
strained chromial which we now explore. 
To introduce this concept consider the four labeled and colored graphs shown 
in Figure 1 
Figure 1. 
and the four labeled but uncolored graphs shown in Figure 2.

The statement that these graphs are labeled means that each vertex has been assigned. 
a numeral. 
The statement that the graphs are colored means that we have placed con-
straints on the manner in which the four vertices are colored. 
(We shall see quite 
soon that the formulas we derive work for any graphs containing the ones illustrated 
above.) 
Clearlv, ~land z2 are isomorphic, but graphs containing z1 and z2 need not 
be isomorphic. 
The letters associated with the vertices in Figure 1 mean precisely the follow-
ing: 
in A1 the four colors assigned to the vertices are all different; in A2 and 
A4, vertices 1 and 3 receive the same color; however, in A2 vertices 2 and 4 receive 
different colors, while in A4 they receive the same color. 
No other interpretation 
should be given to the letters in these dra¥Tings. 
As is customary, we use capital letters to denote either a graph, or its chro-
mial, or its constrained chromial. 
He see, for example, that the number of ways of 
coloring A1 (since it requires 4 different colors) is n(n-l)(n-2)(n-3). 
Accordingly, 
(1) 
Al 
n(n-l)(n-2)(n-3) 
(2) 
A2 
A3 = n(n-l)(n-2) 
(3) 
A4 
n(n-1) 
It follows from (1), (2), and (3) that 
(4) 
This last equation is true in general and may be easily proven using induction on 
N where N is the total number of edges and vertices outside the circuit. 
Inasmuch as this type of induction is fundamental in proving many theorems on 
chromials, we briefly describe how it is accomplished. 
To this end let G be any 
graph containing an edge A. 
Denote by G'A the graph obtained by deleting the edge 
A, and by G"A the graph obtained by contracting the edge A to a single point. It is 
a simple exercise to establish the fundamental reduction formula for chromials, 
namely, 
(5) 
This formula enables us to make the inductive step in many of our proofs. 
When 
dealing with theorems involving circuits it is essential that we do not destroy the 
circuit by either deleting or contracting the edge A. 
Thus we must choose an edge A 

277 
which has at least one of its endpoints not on the circuit. 
With this restriction 
it is clear that (5) holds also for constrained chromials where no constraints are 
placed on any vertex not in the circuit under consideraton •• 
The upshot of this is 
that in checking the "particular cases" to start our induction we must verify that 
our theorem is true for all planar connected graphs having no vertices outside the 
circuit. Clearly, although our graphs may contain loops, no generality is lost in 
removing all but one of the edges joining any pair of vertices. 
This follows since 
the only purpose (chromaticallv speaking) of an edge in a graph is to insure that 
the end points of this edge are colored differently, 
Returning now to the graphs shown in Figures 1 and 2, and using, as always, a 
capital letter to denote either the graph or its chromial (or constrained chromial), 
we see at once from the definitions of these graohs that

The fundamental problem with which we are concerned is to solve the five equa-
tions (4), (6), (7), (8), (9), which are linearlv dependent, for the constrained 
chromials A1,A2,A3,A4 in terms of the free chromials z1,z2,Y1,Y2, and to see what 
can be done about this problem for higher circuits. 
This is the Birkhoff-Lewis 
approach. 
In [1] they obtain 
{10) 
and similar eauations for Al' A2, and A , where, in each case 
3 
(11) 
f = n2 - 3n + 1 
1 
is the coefficient of the left hand member. 
Solving a more complicated system of 
eauations with polynomial coefficients, they solve the same problem for the 5-cir-
cuit, and, again, f 1 is the coefficient of the left member of everv equation they 
obtain. 
The striking fact to be noted here is that the larger zero of f 1 is precisely 
B5 
-r + 1. 
In their solution of this problem for the 6-circuit [2], Hall and Lewis find 

278 
that the coefficient of the left member of each equation is either 6f1f 2 or 
6(n-2)f1f 2, where 
The largest zero of this cubic is called the silver root and has the value 
B7 = 3.24698 .•. , 
which is auite near n2. 
l·Je are now faced with solving a similar problem for the 7-circuit, and 
of devising methods which will work for even larger circuits. 
My student, 
Robert Rector, in his Marvland dissertation [5], tabulated 1505 linear relations 
between constrained chromials for the 7-circuit. 
He then selected from these rela-
tions a maximal subset of 126 which he showed were linearlv independent. 
He also 
showed that the entire collection of 1505 relations could be generated from this 
collection of 126. 
Finally, he obtained a set of 36 equations in 36 specific con-
strained chromials and 36 free chromials of graphs associated with the 7-circuit. 
The solution of this svstem of equations (which has not yet been obtained) would 
then complete the solution of the problem for the 7-circuit. 
Clearly, if there is to be any hope of solving this problem for larger cir-
cuits, it is time for a new approach! 
Be work with a planar connected graph r. containing a labeled open 7-circuit, 
and containing exactly 7 vertices. 
The statement that the 7-circuit is open means 
that no edge or vertex of G lies inside the 7-circuit. 
Each edge which lies out-
side the 7-circuit must have both of its end points on the 7-circuit. 
We choose as 
labels for our seven vertices·the integers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, and, in describing our 
graphs we work modulo 7. 
l-Ie nane the graph by giving the endpoints of the edges 
which lie outside the graph. 
Figure 3 shows the graphs (OO) [i.e., no outside 
edges], (1315), and (131447).

There are 162 constrained colorings ~or a 7-circuit, 
One of these has allseven 
vertices colored differently (and thus corresponds to an unconstrained coloring of a 
graph containing a complete graph on 7 vertices), and the other 161 divide themselves 
into 23 groups of 7 colorings each. 
The 7 occurs since it makes a difference which 
vertex of our graph we use as the initia~ vertex of our coloring scheme. All of these 
coloring schemes are shown in Table 1, which is taken from Birkhoff and ·Lewis.

Let us examine more closely the constrained colorings Ni , 1 ~ i ~ 7 . 
We make 
the following table where the vertex is indicated by its appropriate label. 
This is

Table 2 
For the colorings indicated in Table 2, where we are using 5 colors, the 
constrained chromial of the elementary graph with which we are working must be 
either n(n-1) (n-2) (n-3) (n-4) 
or identically zero. It will be identically 
zero if and only if two vertices receiving the same color are joined by an outside 
edge. For example, for the map 
(1625) , N1 , N6 and N7 are identically zero, 
while N2 = N3 = N4 = N5 = n(n-1) (n-2) (n-3) (n-4) • It is convenient to make a 
column for each graph we are considering (as we have done for the maps (00) and 
(1625) in Table 2) and to place a 0 or 1 in this column according as the corres-
pending constrained chromial is or is not identically zero. 
The sum of the entries 
is then called the 
t 
value for the given graph. 
We now define the constrained 
rochromial 
NR 
for our given graph by 
7 
NR = 
L: 
Ni 
i=l 
tn(n-l)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4) 

281 
where 
t 
is determined by the given graph. 
In precisely the same manner we define 
the constrained rochromials 
AR, BR, ••• , XR, corresponding to the color schemes 
in Table 1. 
We note that 
XR 
7n(n-l) (n-2) (n-3) (n-4) (n-5) (n-6) 
for every map, since no two vertices of the given open 7-circuit are given the same 
color for the color scheme Xi • 
We next define our free rochromials. 
To begin this process we start with an 
elementary graph G containing our labeled 7-circuit, and with an integer i satisfying 
1 < i < 7 • 
We define graphs 
Zi , Yi , Xi , Wi , Ui , Vi 
in the following manner. 
The graph Zi is obtained from G by joining vertex i to each vertex of the 
open 7-circuit with which it is not adjacent by a new edge inside the 7-circuit. 
The graph Yi is obtained from G by first joining vertices i-1 and i+l (mod 7) 
by an edge inside the 7-circuit and then contracting this edge to a single point p. 
We then join p by a new edge to each vertex of our new graph with which it is not 
adjacent. 
The graph Xi is obtained by joining vertices i and i+3 (Iuod 7) by an edge, con-
tracting this edge to a point p, and then joining p by a new edge to each vertex of 
our new graph with which it is not adjacent. 
The graph Wi is obtained by joining the vertex i+2 to each of the vertices i 
and i+4 (mod 7) and then contracting each of these edges to a single point. 
The graph Vi is obtained by joining vertices i-1 and i+l by an edge, and join-
ing vertices i-2 and i+2 by an edge, and then contracting each of these edges to a 
single point. 
The graph Ui is obtained by joining vertices i+l and i+3 by an edge, and join-
ing vertices i-1 and i-3 by an edge, and then contracting each of these edges to a 
single point. 
Examples of these graphs are shown in Figure 4. 
Because of the context there will be no difficulty in distinguishing the graphs 
(or the chromials) ui 'vi 'wi 'xi from the color schemes (or constrained chromials) 
denoted by the same letters.

As in [2] we find it convenient to express our results in terms of x = n - 2, 
n being the number of colors from which our selection is to be made. 
Our general 
problem is the following. 
We •1ish to find a polvnomial 
such that given any constrained coloring of our 7-circuit (such as abacdae) there 
are polynomials 
A(x) 
Ao + A1x +

such that given any elementary graph 8, then 
+ 
+ 
+ 
+ 
(12) 
K(x) 8 (x) = A(x)ZR(x) + B(x)YR(x) + C (x)XR(x) + D(x)WR(x) + E (x)VR(x) 
+ G(x)UR(x) 
where 8(x) is the constrained rochromial determined by the cyclic coloring table and 
the elementary graph under consideration, and ZR(x),Y"R.(x), ••• ,UR(x) are the free 
rochromials determined by the elementary graph we have chosen. 
It is convenient at this point to make several simplifications. 
Inasmuch as 
8(x) is a constrained rochromial for a specific granh, the t for this graph must be 
a factor of 6 (x). 
He write 
(13) 
K(x)8(x) = t(h0 + h1x + h2x2 + ... ) , 
and assume throughout our discussion that ho ~ 0. 
~or n ~ 0, let

Substituting (13) in (12), making use of our assumption that hO ~ 0, and com-
paring coefficients, gives us the following essential lemma.

In her Master's thesis [4] my student Frances Hills has made a catalog of the 
chromials, constrained chromials, rochromials, and constrained rochromials for all 
elementary graphs for the 4, 5, 6, and 7 circuit. Using this catalog we can find, 
for any elementary map for the 7-circuit, and any constrained coloring of this cir-
cuit, the value of t and the sequences <zn > , <Yn > , < xn > , < wn > , < vn > , 
and < un > • Using the equations given by the Lemma, we then can set up recursion 
formulas for our unknown sequences <an>,< bn.> , <en'). , < dn > , <en> , and 
< gn > . Six different elementary graphs provide us with sufficient information to 
solve our problem. 
The graphs which were actually used were (00), (1314), (1316), 
(131636), (13163646), (1347). 
The recursion equations were used in the form

I had hoped that the coefficient=of the left member of each of the equations I was 
seeking would be a constant multiple of f 1f 2. 
This turned out not to be the case. 
1~e need to introduce a new factor 
The largest zero of f 3 is 
n=2+12 
3. 41421. 
This is the Beraha number B8 which is quite close to the zero n3 mentioned at the 
beginning of this paper. 
It is now tedious but not difficult to use a computer to find the constrained 
rochromials of all elementary maps containing a colored open 7-circuit in terms of 
the free rochromials of these maps. 
If we define rochromials and constrained ro-
chromials for an arbitrary planar graph containing a 7-circuit in the obvious way, 
it follows by the type of induction mentioned near the beginning of this paper that 
the equations we give here are valid for all planar graphs containing open 7-cir-
cuits. 
Mv student Brent Arnold has verified on the computer that each of the for-
mulas is valid for all elementary planar graphs. 
Thus the assumption h0 # 0 was not 
necessary. Hills, in her thesis [4], has used the same method to verifv that the 
equations previouslv published for the 4, 5, and 6 circuits are correct. 
In the equations which follow, the factor f 3 is not present as part of the 
coP.fficient of either AR or DR, since each of these equations can be obtained easily 
from known formulas for coloring 6-circuits.

ABSOLUTE RETRACTS IN GRAPHS 
Pavol Hell 
University of British Columbia 
ABSTRACT 
If Y is a subgraph of X, any homomorphism r: X~ Y satisfying r(y) = y 
for ally E V(Y) is termed a retraction of X onto Y, andY a retract of X. 
Let Cdenote a class of graphs, together with a class of homomorphisms; we 
investigate the class AR(C..) of all absolute retracts of C, i.e., the class of 
all graphs Y E e that are retracts of any supergraph X E f! for which the 
inclusion Y C X is a homomorphism in C . 
We consider various classes C, e.g., the class P of all finite planar 
graphs and all homomorphisms, the class '13 of all bipartite graphs and metric 
homomorphisms, etc. 
In particular, we show that the Four Color Conjecture is 
equivalent with the statement AR(i7) # 0, and if the Four Color Conjecture is 
true we have a complete description of AR( P ) . 
We give a "good characterization" 
of AB(~), and obtain partial results for other interesting classes of graphs.

RETRACTS IN GRAPHS 
1. 
We study retractions of graphs in analogy to retractions of topological 
spaces. 
This notion was introduced in topology by Borsuk, [1,2]; he defined are-
traction of the topological space X onto a subspace Y as a continuous mapping 
r: X +Y satisfying r(y) = y for all ye:Y. 
It seems that, in the case of graphs, 
homomorphisms should assume the role played by continuous mappings in the definition 
of retraction. 
Recall that a homomorphism f (cf. [5,6,14]) of the graph X to the graph Y is a 
mapping of the vertex-sets,f: V(X) + V(Y), such that f(x) is adjacent to f(x') when-
ever xis adjacent to x'. 
We note, that a homomorphism X+ Kn is a mapping of the 
vertices of X to symbols 1, 2, ... ' n, such that adjacent vertices of X are mapped 
upon adjacent, i.e., different symbols. 
Hence a homomorphism X+~ is ann-color-
ing of X and vice versa. 
In particular, a graph is n-colorable iff it admits a homo-
morphism to Kn. 
If f: X+ Y is a homomorphism andY admits a homomorphism c: Y + Kns 
then cf is a homomorphism of X to Kn. 
Consequently, if there is a homomorphism of 
X toY, then X(Y) ~ X(X). 
There is a natural relationship between homomorphisms and the notion of a sub-
graph. 
Let the vertex-set of the graph Y be included in the vertex-set of the 
graph X; then Y is a subgraph of X if and only if the inclusion mapping i: Y + X 
(defined by i(y) = y for all y) is a homomorphism. 
Indeed, i is a homomorphism if 
and only if (y, y') e: E(Y) implies (y, y') e: E(X), i.e., E(Y)(E(X). 
More generally 
Y is a subgraph of X, if and only if there is a one-to-one homomorphism of Y into X. 
Invertible homomorphisms (homomorphisms f such that f-l exists and is also a 
homomorphism) coincide with the isomorphisms in the usual sense. 
We also note that 
for V(Y)C:V(X), Y is a full (induced) subgraph of X if and only if the inclusion 
mapping is an isomorphism of Y into X. 
Let Y be a subgraph of X. 
We define a retraction of X onto Y, as a homomor-
phism r: X+ Y satisfying r(y) = y for all vertices v of Y. 
If a retraction of X 
onto Y exists, Y is called a retract of X. 

293 
An example of a retraction is shown below. 
Fisure 1 
2. 
The notion of retract is not an artificial one, as we shall illustrate with 
the following example: 
A country which had experiences a spontaneous and chaotic 
industrial development at the end of the last century was the subject recently of a 
study by industrial management specialists. 
They found that the chaotic placement 
of the factories constituted a major obstacle in increasing productivity, and sug-
gested decreasing the number of factories, augmenting their productions. They pro-
posed to keep all the more recent factories and move the remaining productions into 
these. 
The rearrangement is subject to preserving transoortation lines, i.e., two 
factories with a direct transportation line shall be moved into factories possess-
ing such a line again. 
If X is the graph with factories as vertices and direct 
transportation lines as edges (it would, of course, have all loops), andY the 
subgraph induced by the remaining factories, what we are looking for is a retrac-
tion of X to Y. 
Similar examples can be encountered, where the graphs are without 
locos, or bipartite, planar, etc. 
However, these are not to serve as a justifica-
tion for the study of retracts. 
In a parallel to the situation in topology; the 
justification is mostly based on the following necessary and sufficient condition 
for extendabilitv of homomorphisms (in particular, of colorings): 
Proposition 1. 
Let X be a subgraph of X', f: X+ Y a homomorohism. 
Let Z be 
the graph obtained from the disjoint union of Y and X' by identifying x with f(x) 
for all vertices x of X. 
Then a necessary and sufficient condition for the exis-
tence of a homomorphism f': X'+ Y such that f is a restriction off' is that Y is 
a retract of Z. 
Proof. 
Let j be the mapping of V(X') into V(Z) defined by j(x) = x 
for all 

294 
xe;V(X'). 
Note that j is not necessarily an inclusionmapping, as two distict ver-
tices x,x' of X' may be identified in Z (if and only if f(x) = f(x')). However j 
is always a homomorphism X' ~ Z. 
When r: Z ~ Y is a retraction, then f' = rj is a homomorphism X' ~ Y. 
More-
over f' restricted to the vertices of X is equal to f. 
Indeed, for all vertices 
x of X, f'(x) = r(j(x)) = r(x), but x and f(x) are identified in Z, thus 
r(x) = r(f(x)); finally f(x) e; V(Y), i.e., r(f(x)) = f(x), 
Let f': X'~ Y be an extension off: X~ Y. 
We definer: Z ~ Y by 
r(z) 
f'(z) if z e; V(X') and r(z)- z if z e; V(Y). 
If z belongs to both X' andY, 
then z is the result of an identification of x E: V(X) and f(x) 
E: V(Y). 
Since r(x) 
= f' (x) 
f(x) = r(f(x)), there is no contradiction in the definition of r. Also, 
if x,x' are different vertices of X' corresponding to the same z in Z, then 
x, x' E: V(X) and f(x) = f(x'); hence f'(x) = f(x) = f(x') = f'(x'). 
Thus r is a 
well-defined mapping. 
Since f' and j are homomorphisms, and since each edge of Z 
is either an edge of Y or an edge of j(X'), r is a homomorphism and consequently a 
retraction of Z onto Y. 
3. 
If Y is a retract of X, then we have two homomorphisms occurring: 
the 
inclusion i: Y ~x, and the retraction r: X ~Y. According to what was said in 
section 1, X(Y) 
z X(X). 
Another necessary condition for the existence of a retraction 
is related to the metric of a graph. 
A subgraph Y of X is called isometric if the 
distance it induces coincides with the distance in X, i.e., if dy(y,y') = dx(y,y') 
for all vertices y, y' of Y, 
The minimum number of edges that have to be crossed on 
any path from y to y' cannot be increased by an edge-preserving mapping (homomor-
phism); hence if Y is a retract of X, Y is an isometric subgraph of X. 
Figure 2 
A subgraph which is not isometric cannot be 
a retract. 
Note that y, y' are adjacent in Y if and only if dy(y,y') 
1. 
Thus an isometric 
subgraph is a full (induced) subgraph. 
The problem of finding a retraction is very difficult. It belongs, in fact 

295 
(for finite graphs), to the Karp•Cook class of "hard" problems, [12]. 
To see this, 
we first remark, that finding a retraction of the disjoint union of X and Y onto y 
is eouivalent to finding a homomorphism X ~ Y (and similarly, finding a retraction 
of the product*) X x Y onto Y is equivalent with finding a homomorphism Y ~X). 
Hence if the problem of finding a retraction is solvable in polynomial time, then 
so is the problem of finding a homomorphism, and conseouently also the determina-
tion of the chromatic number of a graph, which belongs to the Karp-Cook class, [12]. 
Below, we illustrate the difficulty of finding a homomorphism; the two graphs 
have verv similar graph-theoretic properties, yet they admit no homomorphism in 
either direction (and thus neither one is a retract of their disjoint union or 
product). 
Figure 3 
This is the basic difficulty in studying retractions. 
There is a class of graphs 
in which homomorphisms between any two graphs exist (except when the second graph 
is totally disconnected, i.e., consists of isolated vertices), namely 13, the class 
of all bipartite graphs. 
This is so, since any bipartite graph X admits a 2-color-
ing c: X ~ K2, and if Y has at least one edge then there is a homomorphism 
h: K2 ~ Y, and a homomorphism he: X~ Y. 
Let us exclude the totally disconnected 
graphs from Z1. 
It seems then that ~is an easier class to handle. 
We note that 
K2 is a retract of any X e: /3 ; indeed any 2-coloring X ~ K2 can serve as a retrac-
tion, since K2 is a subgraph of X. 
Which other graphs X have this property, of 
being a retract of any graph in ~ that contains X? 
As an example, Ps, the path 
with 5 vertices does not have the property, as illustrated in Figure 2. 
However, 
*The product (conjunction in [4]) of X and Y has vertex set V(X) x V(Y) and 
(x,y) adjacent to (x',y') if and only if xis adjacent to x' in X andy toy' in 
Y, cf. [5,13]. 

296 
the hexagon should have not been admitted as a candidate, since it does not contain 
P5 as an isometric subgraph! 
Let e denote a class of graphs, /J a property of inclusion. 
We denote by 
AR( e, ;b) the class of all graphs Y £ e such that Y is a retract of X whenever 
X £ (!and Y is a subgraph of X such that the inclusion i: Y ->- X has the property P. 
The elements of AR( (!, "/>) are called absolute retracts in e with respect to -p. 
4. 
A paper on retracts of bipartite graphs, in which AR(~.~) is determined, 
is under preparation (~is the property of being an isometric subgraph). 
Here we 
shall summarize the main results and make a few observations. 
Proposition 2. 
AR(~,J.n) consists of all graphs that are obtained from finite 
• 
paths by first taking their products and then a retractions, i.e., Y £ AR(~.~) if 
and only if Y is a retract of a product of finite paths. 
For infinite graphs, the products may be of infinitely many paths, but each 
of them being finite. 
In the proof of Proposition 2, the following observation is 
implicit: 
Corollary. 
Each bipartite graph is an isometric subgraph of a suitable product 
of finite paths. 
Proposition 3. 
Y i AR(~,/7.0 if and only if there exists an independent setS of 
diameter 2 in Y, such that either the set U(S) of all vertices adjacent to each 
vertex of S is empty, or there exists a function f of U(S) into Y such that for 
each u £ U(S) we have: 
f(u) i S, f(u) not adjacent to any vertex of S, 
d(u, f(u)) ~ d(s, f(u)) for all s £ S, 
and 
d(f(u), f(u')) ~ d(f(u), u) + d(f(u'), u') -
4 for all u, u' £ U(S). 
The Propositions 2 and 3, in conjunction, provide us with a "good character-
ization" (in the sense of Edmonds, [3]) of AR({i,'J?,): either Y £ AR(IJ,~) and we 
can exhibit a retraction of some product of paths onto Y, or Y i AR(~.~) and we 
can exhibit S with U(S) = 0 or with a function f: U(S) ->- V(Y) satisfying the above 
three properties. 
Two characteristic instances of this situation are illustrated 
below. 

297 
S with U(S) 
S with U(S) 
{u}, f(u) = v 
v 
Figure 4 
Neither the hexagon, nor the octagon belong to AR(~.~). 
Corollary. 
Any tree, or a graph whose all cycles have length 4, is a member of 
As an application we prove the following fact, first observed by Sabidussi: 
Proposition 4. 
A cycle of minimum length in a bipartite graph X is a retract of X. 
Proof. 
If C is a cycle of minimum length in X E 29, then C - e, where e is any 
edge of C, is a path, which is an isometric subgraph of X - e. 
By the above 
corollary, C -
e is a retract of X- e, and any retraction r: X - e + C - e is also 
a retraction of X onto C. 
5. 
Another interesting class of graphs to investigate is )7, the class of all 
finite planar graphs. 
It turns out, that AR(~, 0) = AR(j0,~) and we shall write 
AR(J0) instead. 
Clearly, if the Four-Color Conjecture (4CC) is true, then 
K4 E AR(j?), just as we showed Kz EAR(~, 0). 
In [10] we prove that if the 4CC 
is true, then AR(;0) consists of all those maximal planar graphs for which each 
triangle bounding a face belongs to a complete graph with 4 vertices. 
Of special 
interest is the following proposition (also proved in [10]), that gives an equi-
valent form of 4CC in terms of "algebraic" properties of the class P: 
Proposition 5. 
4CC is true if and only if AR(~ + 0. 

298 
6. Applications. 
In the first place we must mention again extensions of homo-
morphisms (colorings in particular). Besides Proposition 1, giving a criterion for 
extendabilitv of a particular homomorphism in terms of retracts, we have, as in tope-
logy, the following properties: 
Let Y be a subgraph of X. 
Then 
(1) Y is a retract of X if and only if each homomorphism Y + Z can be extended 
to a homomorphism X+ Z. 
(2) Y is a retract of X if and only if each homomorphism Z' + Y (for Z' a sub-
graph of Z) which can be extended to a homomorphism Z + X, can also be ex-
tended to a homomorphism Z + Y. 
Let us prove (1). 
If r: X+ Y is a retraction, then any homomorphism f: Y + Z 
can be extended to fr: X+ Z, as ( fr) (y) = f(r(y)) = f(v) for all v £ V(Y). If 
every homomorphism Y + Z can be extended to a homomorphism X + Z, then consider the 
identity homomorphism ly: Y + Y; its extension r: X + Y is a retraction. 
The proof 
of (2) is analogous. 
The properties (1) and (2) are useful, when we kno~• that Y .is a retract of X, 
e. g., when Y £ AR( tJ,71!), X £ tJ and Y is an isometric subgraph of X. 
In this vein, 
Proposition 2 yields another application of retracts to extendability of homomor-
phisms: 
(3) 
Y £ AR(~,Jn) if and only if any homomorphism Z' + Y can be extended to a 
homomorphism Z + Y, where Z' is any isometric subgraph of Z £ ~. 
As a further application we shall study rigid graphs. 
A graph is rigid, cf. 
[6, 7, 11] if it has no homomorphisms into itself, except the identitv. 
These 
graphs play an important role in full embeddings of certain categories, and in 
finding graphs with given group (monoid), [7 • 11, 15]. 
To 
sho~-1 that a graph is 
rigid usually requires a lot of brute force, cf. [6, 7]. 
~or a finite graph X, one 
often starts by showing that X is asymmetric (has no automorphisms, exceot 1 ); 
X 
this is generally easier, as automorphisms preserve degrees, cycles, distances, 
etc. 
But after that there is no general method for concluding the proof. 
The 
following proposition is useful: 
Proposition 6. 
A finite graph X is rigid if and only if 
(1) 
X is asymmetric. 

299 
(2) 
X does not contain a proper retract of itself. 
Proof. 
A rigid graph is asymmetric and does not admit a proper retraction. 
If (1) is satisfied, then anv homomorphism (except lx) of X into itself has image 
Y ¥7hich is a proper subgraph of X. 
The set of all homomorphisms X -+- Y forms a 
finite non-empty semigroup under composition. Such a semigroup necessarily con-
tains an idempotent, i.e., there is a homomorphism r: X-+- Y with r r = r. Let 
r(X) denote the full subgraph of X induced bv r(V(X)). 
Then r(X) is a subgraph of 
Y, thus a proper subgraph of X, and r: X-+- r(X) is a retraction. 
Remark. 
If the deletion of the set V' C:V(X) results in decreasing th~ chro-
matic number of X, then V' intersects the vertex-sets of all retracts of X. 
Indeed, if a retract Y of X is disjoint from V' then V(Y) C V(X) - V' and 
x(Y) < x(X), which is impossible. 
Thus the critical vertices of X (vertices x such 
that x(X - x) < x(X)) belong to all retracts of X. 
Example. 
Let n be even, n ~ 8. 
c 
Figure 5 
This graph was shown rigid in [6]. 
Our remark and Proposition 6 facilitate the 
proof (similarlv, most other proofs of rigidity of finite grauhs can be shortened 
using this method): To see that X is asymmetric we note ~ith [6], that cis the 
onlv vertex such that its neighborhood is a cycle. 
The cvcle, i.e., 0, 1, ... , 
n-4, 0 is odd, and so x(X) = 4; but x(X- x) = 3 for x = 0, 1, ... , n-4, c. 
Hence 
each retract of X would contain 0, 1, ... , n-4, c; we see that X contains no 
proper retract of itself and therefore is rigid. 
Next we shall make the following observation. 
Each bipartite graph can be 
mapped (bv a homomorphism) onto a path. 
Let t(X), for X E 23 denote the maximum 
length (i.e., number of edges) of a path that is a homomorph1c image of X. 

300 
Proposition 7, 
~(X)~ diam X, for each connected X E ~ , 
Proof, 
Since, as we noted before, the distance between two vertices cannot be 
increased by a homomorphism, 
~(X) 5 diam X. 
Let d(x, x') = diam X. 
Then anv path 
joining x and x',with diam X edges,is an isometric subgraph of X, and bv the Corol-
lary of Proposition 3, it is a retract of X. 
Hence ~(X) = diam X. 
Finally we shall discuss a possible argument for the decidability of the 4CC. 
The following statement was suggested by z. Hedrlin: (ZH) 
There exists an integer 
k such that each planar graph X has a homomorphic image Y E 'P satisfying Jv(Y) J.::. k 
If (ZH) could be proved, and such a k found, then a systematic examination of 
all planar graphs with at most k vertices would yield (in theory) a final answer to 
the 4CC, 
As an application of Proposition 5, one can prove (see [10]), that the 
criterion (ZH) of decidability of the 4CC is equivalent to the 4CC itself! 
In [9], most of the above, and also other related results can be found. 
Recently, new partial results on AR(:){,?J,), where~ is the class of all k-chromatic 
graphs, were found jointly by E. Mendelsohn and the author.

CANCELLING EULERIAN GRAPHS 
Joan P. Hutchinson 
Dartmouth College 
ABSTRACT 
If G is an (undirected) Eulerian graph, we label the edges of G and define 
the sign of an Eulerian path on G to be the sign of the associated permutation 
of the edges of the graph which is given by the Eulerian path. 
A path is positive 
if its sign is +1, negative if -1. 
One asks when a graph contains the same number 
of positive and negative Eulerian paths. 
A vertex of a graph G is said to cancel if there are an equal number of 
positive and negative Eulerian paths which begin at the vertex. 
A graph is said 
to cancel if every vertex cancels. 
In fact, whether a graph cancels or not is 
independent of the choice of labels for the edges of the graph. 
Properties of cancelling graphs are explored. 
Using results obtained by 
Swan for directed graphs, it can be shown that a graph with at least twice as 
many edges as vertices always cancels. 
The relevance of cancelling graphs to 
the study of polynomial identities for skew-symmetric and symmetric matrices will 
also be presented.

CANCELLING EULERIAN GRAPHS 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
This paper presents some properties of Eulerian graphs which arise from the 
study of polynomial identities for sets of matrices, 
We shall consider graphs which may have loops and multiple edges, and we shall 
call a graph Eulerian if the graph contains either 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree. 
Euler proved that it is precisely these graphs on which a path* can be traced which 
crosses every edge once and only once. 
We call such a path an Eulerian path, and 
if the terminal vertex of the path is the same as the initial vertex, we may call 
the path an Eulerian circuit. 
In fact, Euler's theorem tells us that if Vis a 
vertex of a graph G with all vertices of even degree, then there are Eulerian cir-
cuits which begin and end at V; however, if G has two vertices of odd degree, there 
is an Eulerian path which begins at V if and only if V is one of the vertices of 
odd degree. 
Suppose G is an Eulerian graph with m edges. 
If we label the edges of G, then 
every Eulerian path on G gives us a permutation on m elements. 
Definition 1. 
The sign of an Eulerian path is the sign of the associated permu-
tation of the edges of the graph. 
An Eulerian path is positive (or negative) if its sign is +1 (or -1). 
The question which we wish to explore is that of determining when a graph contains 
an equal number of positive and negative Eulerian paths which begin at a fixed 
vertex. 
Definition 2. 
A vertex of a graph cancels (or is said to be a cancelling vertex) 
if there is an equal number of positive and negative Eulerian paths which begin at 
that vertex. 
A graph cancels (or is called a cancelling graph) if every vertex cancels. 
For example, if G is the path of m edges, G does not cancel, for each vertex of 
*Editors Note: 
This is ~ometimes called a trail.

degree 1 is the initial vertex of precisely one Eulerian path. 
If G is the cycle 
of length m, every vertex is the initial vertex of precisely 2 Eulerian circuits. 
If m: 0 or 1 (mod 4) , the 2 circuits have the same sign; if m: 2 or 3 (mod 4), 
they have opposite signs and thus each vertex cancels as does the entire graph. 
The interest in these questions arises from the study of polynomial identities 
for sets of matrices. 
If we define the standard identity of degree m by 
L sgnO" xol .•• xom 
oe:sm 
0 ' 
then Amitsur and Levitzki were the first to prove that any set of m n x n 
rna-
trices over a field of characteristic 0 satifies the standard identity of degree 
m if m ~ 2n , and that 
2n is the best possible bound [1]. 
Swan [2] recog-
nized the essentially combinatorial nature of their proof and gave another proof 
by establishing an equivalent result about directed Eulerian graphs. 
His 
important result is stated as Theorem 1. 
The question was also posed of determining the minimum standard identity for 
the set of all n x n 
skew-symmetric matrices. 
Kostant [3] proved that if 
n is even, any m n x n skew-symmetric matrices satisfy the standard identity of 
degree m > 2n-2. 
Smith and Kumin conjectured that Kostant's result was true 
for all nand gave the best possible bound [4]. 
The conjecture is true, and the 
proof given by this author also is a graph-theoretic argument about cancelling 
Eulerian graphs [5]. 
The result is stated in Theorems 2 and 3 without proof. 
The 
proof builds upon avariety of properties of cancelling Eulerian graphs, which in 
themselves are not difficult or deep, but which are presented here as an introduetion 
to the subject and hopefully as a help in understanding their further implications. 
Results for skew-symmetric matrices have been obtained by Rowen [6] and Owens [7].

PROPERTIES OF CANCELLING EULERIAN GRAPHS 
Notice that whether a graph cancels or not is independent of the labelling; 
that is, if a graph cancels with one labelling, it cancels with any other since 
the interchanging of two edge labels of a graph causes the associated permutation 

305 
of an Eulerian path to be multiplied by a transposition. 
Thus each positive Eulerian 
path becomes negative and vice versa. 
If we began with an equal number of positive 
and negative Eulerian paths, we will still have an equal number after interchanging 
labels. 
Also if a graph has multiple edges, it cancels, for we may pair Eulerian paths 
by pairing two paths which are identical except that the two multiple edges are inter-
changed. 
Two such paired paths will have opposite signs since the corresponding per-
mutations differ by a transposition. 
There are a number of sufficient conditions for a graph to cancel which we can 
determine. 
Proposition 1. 
If G is a graph with all vertices of even degree and if IE(G)I _ 2,3 
(mod 4), then G cancels. 
Proof: 
If V is a vertex of G, we pair the Eulerian circuits at V by associating with 
one circuit that one obtained by reversing the first. 
They have opposite signs as 
Eulerian· paths since 
IE(G)I = 2,3 (mod 4). 
Proposition 2. 
If G has 2 vertices of odd degree, G cancels if and only if one of 
the vertices of odd degree cancels. 
Proof: 
By definition if the graph cancels, all vertices cancel. 
Conversely, suppose 
V and W are the vertices of odd degree and suppose V cancels. 
Of course, all ver-
tices of even degree are automatically cancelling vertices since no Eulerian path on 
G can begin at such a vertex. 
Thus we need only check that W cancels. 
There is a 
one-to-one correspondence between the Eulerian paths which begin at V and those which 
begin at W obtained by reversing each Eulerian path. 
Depending upon what the number 
of edges of G is congruent to modulo 4, the signs of such corresponding paths are 
either always the same or always opposite, but in either case W will also have an 
equal number of positive and negative Eulerian paths if V does, and thus G cancels. 
Sometimes we can determine when a graph cancels by discovering a cancelling 
subgraph. 
We mention one such example, omitting the straightforward proof. 
Proposition 3. 
Suppose G has an isthmus e such that G-{e} = F lJ F'. 
Then G cancels 
if either F or 
F' is a cancelling graph. 
Suppose G is 2-line connected and that 

306 
G-{e,e'} = F U F' • 
Then a vertex 
V£F cancels if F' is a cancelling graph. 
It is often convenient to divide the Eulerian paths into subsets and show that 
each subset cancels. 
Suppose G has all vertices of even degree and let V beavertex 
of G. 
We define the rotation equivalence classes of Eulerian circuits at Vas follows. 
If C is a circuit ,at V with associated permutation 
(x1 , ••• ,xm) 
and C' 
another cir-
cuit at V with permutation 
(y1 , ••• ,ym) , then C and 
C' are in the same equivalence 
class if and only if 
for some i£{2,3, ••• ,m} 
valence class. 
If V has valence 
2p , there are p circuits in each equi-
Proposition 4. 
If G has all vertices of even degree and an odd number of edges, then 
G cancels if and only if at least one vertex cancels. 
Proof: 
We use the fact that when the number of edges of G is odd, each rotation 
class at a vertex V of valence 
2p not only has p elements, but also all members of 
one class have the same sign as Eulerian paths. 
This is so since the permutations 
have the same sign when m is odd. 
Thus a vertex cancels if and only if there is a 
set of representatives of the equivalence classes which contains an equal number of 
positive and negative Eulerian paths. 
Suppose V is a cancelling vertex and suppose W is another vertex of G. 
Let e 
be an edge incident with V. 
We pick as our set R of representatives of the Eulerian 
circuits at V those circuits which either begin on or end on edge e. 
We know that R 
contains an equal number of positive and negative Eulerian circuits. 
We pick the set 
S of representatives of the Eulerian circuits at W to be those which upon leaving W, 
traverse edge e before returning to W for the first time. 
There is a one-to-one, 
sign-preserving correspondence between the elements of R and S since an element of 
R can be cyclically rotated to a unique element of S and conversely. 
Thus S cancels 
and so does the vertex W. 

307 
Swan proved a very strong result (Theorem 1) for directed Eulerian gr~phs, On 
a directed graph, we now require an Eulerian path to follow the given edge orienta-
tions. 
We then can define a cancelling vertex and a cancelling directed graph as in 
Definitions 1 and 2. 
Theorem 1. If G is adirectedgraphwithnverticesandmedges,andif m~2n,thenG 
cancels. 
We can immediately obtain the same result for undirected graphs. 
Corollary 1. If G is an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges and if m ~ 2n, 
then G cancels. 
~: With every Eulerian path E on G we obtain an orientation of the edges of G, 
and thus define 
GE 
to be the resulting directed graph. 
We divide the set of all Eulerian paths which begin at a vertex V of G into 
equivalence classes by assigning two paths E and 
E' to the same class if the graphs 
GE 
and 
GE 
are the same directed graph. 
By Swan's theorem each 
GE 
is a cancel-
ling graph so that each equivalence class cancels. 
Thus V cancels as does G. 
Several people have noted that this is the best possible bound when we allow 
graphs to have loops, for the graph in Figure 1 has n vertices and 
2n-l edges, but 
neither of the two vertices of odd degree cancels since each vertex of odd degree is 
the initial vertex of precisely one Eulerian path.

Possibly this is also the best possible bound for loopless graphs since for 
n = 6,7 there are non-cancelling, loopless graphs with n vertices and 2n-l edges, 
but we ask 
Question 1. 
Is 
2n 
the best possible bound for loopless, undirected graphs? 
That 
is, for every n is there a loopless graph with n vertices and 
2n-l 
edges which does 
not cancel? 
For instance, it is known that for every n and 
k ~ 2n-3 , there is a loopless graph 
with n vertices and k edges which does not cancel, but no sharper results are known 
in general. 

308 
We have seen some sufficient conditions for a graph to cancel. 
It is not hard 
to characterize the graphs on n vertices and with at most n edges which cancel. 
In 
fact, all graphs with n vertices and k edges, 
k < n , cancel except for the path 
with k edges and the graphs shown in Figure 2 where the number of edges in each 
cycle is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4. 
In general, no more is known about graphs 
with fewer than 2n edges. 
Question 2. 
Can one find necessary and sufficient conditions such that a graph with 
n vertices and k edges, 
n < k < 2n , cancels?

TOTALLY CANCELLING GRAPHS 
. 
.. . 
There is another question which is reasonable to ask. 
Suppose we have an 
Eulerian graph G and suppose we make a list of all Eulerian paths on G without re-
gard to theirinitial point. 
That is, we write down all permutations which give us 
an Eulerian path and we ask when the list contains an equal number of positive and 
negative paths. 
Of course, the list has this property if the graph cancels. 
Definition 3. 
A graph G cancels totally if there is an equal number of positive 
and negative Eulerian paths on G. 
This concept also arises from the study of matrices and the standard identity. 
Given 
matrices 
A1 , •.. ,Am 
such that 
[A1 , .•• ,Am] I 0 , we can determine some information 
about when the matrix 
[A1 , ••• ,Am] 
has 0 trace and when it is skew-symmetric or 
symmetric. 

309 
We can characterize graphs which cancel totally in terms of what we know about 
graphs which cancel. 
Proposition 5. 
If G has two vertices of odd degree and if G does not cancel, then 
G cancels totally if and only if IE(G) I - 2,3 (mod 4) 
~: If V and W are the two vertices of odd degree, then we pair an Eulerian path 
beginning at V with the reversed path which begins at W. 
Two such paired paths have 
the same sign if and only if 
IE(G)I : 2,3 (mod 4). 
Proposition 6. 
If G has all vertices of even degree and an even number of edges, 
then G cancels totally. 
Proof: 
Note that the permutations 
(x1 , ••• ,xm) 
and 
(x2, ..• ,xm,x1) 
have opposite signs. 
We define the total equivalence classes of Eulerian circuits on G as follows. 
We pick a vertex V of G and a set R of representatives of the rotation equivalence 
classes of Eulerian circuits at V. 
Each element E of R determines a total equivalence 
class [E], and an arbitrary Eulerian circuit F is in [E] if and only if E and F have 
respectively the following associated permuations: 
for some i£{2,3, ... ,m} , 
Then every Eulerian path on G belongs to precisely one 
total equivalence class. 
In the equivalence class [E], we pair paths with permutations 
(x2k-l'''' ,xm,xl'''''x2k-2) 
and 
(x2k'''''xm,xl'''''x2k-l) 
for 
k£{1,2, .•. ,m/2} 
Each pair of paths have opposite signs, each equivalence 
class cancels, and G cancels totally. 
Proposition 7. 
If G has all vertices of even degree and an odd number of edges, 
then G cancels totally if and only if G cancels. 
Proof: 
When m is odd, the set of permutations 

310 
all have the same sign. 
Thus each total equivalence class, as defined in the proof 
of Proposition 6, contains I E(G) j paths, all of the same sign, and G cancels totally if 
and only if a set of representatives of the total equivalence classes cancels. 
Suppose G does not cancel. 
By proposition 4, no vertex V cancels. 
We pick as 
a set R of representatives of the rotation equivalence classes of Eulerian circuits 
at V those circuits which either begin on or end on a fixed edge e, incident with 
V. 
We know that R does not contain an equal number of positive and negative Eulerian 
paths. 
But R is also a set of representatives of the total equivalence classes, and 
by the previous discussion we see that G does not cancel totally. 
Thus the concept of total cancellation leads us back to our earlier questions 
about when an arbitrary graph cancels. 
4. 
EULERIAN GRAPHS AND SKEW-SYMMETRIC MATRICES 
We conclude with a statement of the graph-theoretic result which is equivalent 
to matrix results for skew-symmetric matrices. 
Definition 4. 
An E path on a directed graph is a path which traverses every edge 
of the graph once and only once and which may travel in either direction on an edge, 
regardless of the orientation. 
The sign of an E path is the product sgn cr(-l)z , where 
cr is the associated 
permutation of the edges of the graph and where z is the number of edges traversed 
opposite to their orientation. 
We call (-l)z the orientation coefficient of an E 
path P, and denote it by OC(P) 
In this context we then define a cancelling vertex and a cancelling graph as in 
Definition 2, and we can prove the following. 
Theorem 2. 
If G is a directed (loopless) graph with n vertices and m edges and if 
m ~ 2n-2 , then G cancels. 
Theorem 3. 
Given k < 2n-2 , there is a directed (loopless) graph with n vertices 
and k edges which does not cancel. 

311 
The proofs [6] are rather intricate, but the main ingredients are the results dis-
cussed in this paper. 
Results about partially directed graphs can also be obtained as can some results 
for undirected graphs. 
For instance, a partial answer to Question 1 is the following 
corollary of theorem 2. 
Corollary 2. 
If G is a bipartite, undirected graph with n vertices and m edges and 
if m > 2n-2 , then G cancels. 
Proof: 
Given such a graph G we shall orient the edges of G in a special way so that 
not only does the oriented graph G' cancel by Theorem 2, but also all the E paths 
at a fixed vertex V will have orientation coefficient +1 
Since V will be a can-
celling vertex of 
G' , we shall see that there are an equal number of E paths at V 
with associated positive permutation as there are with negative permutation. 
Thus 
V will also be a cancelling vertex of the original graph G. 
Pick a vertex V of G which we wish to show cancels. 
We create an oriented graph 
G' by orienting the edges of G in the following way. 
Let W be an Eulerian walk on 
G which begins at V. 
(If there are none, V£G 
automatically cancels.) Then if e 
joins vertices X and Y in G, then edge e of 
G' is oriented from X to Y if and only 
if X is the initial vertex of e with respect to W. 
Let the flux of a vertex Z in a 
directed graph be given by the difference between the number of in-directed edges at 
Z and the number of out-directed edges. 
Then with this orientation of G either all 
vertices of 
G' will have flux 0 or all but two will have flux 0, and of these two, 
one has flux +1 
and the other -1 
The E path Won G' has orientation coefficient +1 
and we shall see that any 
other path P, beginning at V, also has 
OC(P) = +1 • 
Since G is bipartite, we know 
that we can partition the vertices of G into two disjoint sets v1 
and v2 
such 
that every edge joins a vertex of v1 with a vertex of v2 • 
Thus to calculate 
OC(P) 
we may calculate the orientation coefficient contribution to P at every vertex 
that is, if A£V1 
we determine the contribution to the orientation coef-
ficient of all the edges incident at A and we do this for every vertex in v1 • 
In 
this way we will check the orientation coefficient contribution of every edge of G' 
once and only once since G' is bipartite. 
We shall see that at each vertex A of 

312 
v1 , the contribution to the orientation coefficient is +1 • 
Suppose the valence of A is 
2p , AEV1 . 
The flux of A is then Q. Consider 
thefollowing numbers concerning P: 
x1 = the number of times P comes in to A on an edge directed 
to A, 
y1 
the number of times P goes out of A on an edge directed 
in to A, 
x2 
the number of times P comes in to A on an edge directed 
out of A, 
y2 
the number of times P goes out of A on an edge directed 
out of A. 
Thus 
y1 - x2 = x2 - y1 , i.e., y1 = x2 . 
At A we see that 
x1 + y2 
edges make no 
contribution to the orientation coefficient of P. 
But on the remaining 
y1 + x2 
edges, P does travel opposite to the edge orientation so that the orientation coe-
(-l)yl+x2 
(-1)2yl 
fficient of P receives a contribution of 
= +1 at the vertex A. 
Suppose B is a vertex of v1 with flux +1 
and the valence of B is 
2q + 1 
Let 
and 
Y2 
be defined as before, and we see x1 + y1 = q = x2 + y2 - 1, 
and 
x1 + x2 = q = y1 + y2 - 1, whence 
y1 = x2 . 
Again the contribution to 
OC(P) 
at B is 
y~ 
(-1) 1 
2 = (-1)2y = +1 . 
The same argument holds for a vertex with flux -1 
and therefore OC(P) = +1 
Since G' 
is a directed, loopless, graph with n vertices and m edges, m ~ 2n-2 
G' cancels by Theorem 2, and, in particular, the vertex V cancels. 
Since all E paths 
at V have the same orientation coefficient, 
+1 , there must be the same number of 
paths with associated positive permutation as those with negative permutation. 
This 
means that V is a cancelling vertex of G, the original, undirected graph, and since 
V was arbitrary, G is a cancelling graph.

A GRAPHICAL REALIZATION PROBLEM 
Sukhamay~ 
University of Texas 
ABSTRACT 
Let G be a finite r-graph where two (distinct) vertices are joined by at 
most r lines and let [G] denote the degree sequence of G. 
If s is an integer, 
s ~ r + 1 , then we prove that a degree sequence [Kil has a realizing s-graph 
containing graph G if and only if the sequence [k1 ] -
[H] is s-realizable for 
all subgraphs H of G.

A GRAPHICAL REALIZATION PROBLEM 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
In this note, we consider the following graphical realization problem. 
Given 
n natural numbers [ki: 1 ~ i ~ n] and an r-graph G, when does there exist an s-graph 
(s ~ r + 1) containing G whose degree sequence is given by [ki]? 
The realization 
problem reduces to a factorization problem of an s-graph when stated in terms of 
complement graphs: 
Does there exist a subgraph {factor) of ~(s) - G with degree 
sequence [s(n-1) - ki]? 
Here ~(s) denotes the complete s-graph on n vertices, each 
vertex having degree s(n-1). 
A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence 
of a [ki] factor in an arbitrary s-graph G has been given by Tutte [3]. It is the 
purpose of this note to provide a simple alternate characterization of sequences 
[kil that are realizable by an s-graph containing a given r-graph G. 
The price of 
such simplifications in those conditions is that our theorem does not hold, for 
example, if we let s = r and G arbitrary. 
The principal result (Theorem 1) of this note can be derived from a more 
general realizability theorem (see Appendix). 
However, the proof of that theorem 
requires application of a few important theorems from theory of linear inequalities. 
Therefore, we feel that a direct combinatorial proof as given here should be of 
interest, particularly because of its simplicity.

NOTATIONS AND DEFINITIONS 
By an r-graph G = (V(G), E(G)), we mean a set of vertices V(G) and a set of 
lines E(G) where each line joins a pair of distinct vertices and no r+l lines join 
the same vertices. 
The vertices are denoted by vl, v2 , ••. , vn and (vi,vj), 
denotes a line joining vi to vj. 
The number of lines joining vi to vj is 
called the multiplicity of 
(vi,vj) 
of G if V(H) = V(G) and E(H) ~ E(G) 
An r-graph H is said to be a subgraph 
The degree of a vertex is the number of lines 
incident with that vertex. If we let di denote the degree of vertex vi in G, then 
the sequence [dil is said to be the degree sequence of G and is denoted by [G]. We 
say that [di] is r-realizable and that G is an r-realization of that sequence. (A 

316 
necessary and sufficient condition for r-realizability is given in the Appendix,) 
The completer-graph ~(r) is defined by the degree sequence di = r(n-1), 1 ~ i < n, 
In other words, each pair of vertices in Kn(r) are joined by r parallel lines, 
Throughout the paper we regard an s-graph as a subgraph of the complete graph 
Kn(s) • The lines of G joining vertices vi, Vj are labeled, unless otherwise stated, 
as 
(vi,vj)l, (vi,vj)z, ... , (vi,vj)t where tis the multiplicity of (vi,vj). It 
will be convenient to write a sequence [di - ki] as [dil - [ki] • Also, the sym-
metric difference of two sets A and B will be denoted by A ~ B • 
3. 
RESULTS 
We prove the following realizability theorem. 
Theorem 1. 
Let G be an r-graph, [ki] a sequence of n natural numbers, and 
s > r + 1 . Then [ki] has an s-realization containing graph G if and only if the 
following condition holds: 
(1.1) 
The sequence [ki] -
[H] is s-realizable for all 
subgraphs H of G. 
The "only if" part of the theorem is obvious. 
To show that condition (1.1) 
is sufficient, we proceed by induction on the number of lines in G. 
Proof 
("if" part). 
The theorem is clearly true if JE(G)J = 0. Assume the 
theorem for all r-graphs with q-1 lines, and let JE(G)J 
a line of G and let H denote the subgraph obtained from B by removing e. It follows 
from the induction hypothesis that there exists an s-graph F1 containing H, where 
[F1] = [ki] • There also exists an s-graph Fz containing H such that [Fz] is the 
same as [kil except for the degrees of vi and vj which are one less than ki and kj , 
respectively. 
Without loss of generality, we can assume that m= JE(F1) n E(Fz)J 
is maximum (among all possible choices of Fl,Fz) and that e i E(F1) • Now one can 
easily show that there exists a sequence of distinct lines P = [(x0 ,x1), (xl,xz), 
(x2,x3), ... , (xzp• xzp+l)] 
which has the following properties: (a) 
x0 =vi and 
Xzp+l 
vj ; (b) 
the lines (xi,xi+l) belong alternately to E(F1) - E(Fz) and 
E(Fz) - E(F1) 
while the first and last lines of P belong to F1 . The vertices xi 

317 
need not all be distinct; by definition, the lines of P are disjoint from the lines 
of H. 
The existence of the "alternating path" P follows from the fact that the 
sequence [F1] -
[F2) consists of zeros only except for the ith and jth terms which 
are equal to 1. 
First suppose that e £ P, and hence e belongs to F2 • If e = (xt,xt+l), then 
it follows that xt = vi and xt+l = vj . For, otherwise, the first t+l lines of P 
would form a closed alternating path Q of even length, and we could redefine graph 
F1 by E(F1') = E(Fl) fi Q, i.e., replace those lines of F1 appearing in Q by the 
other half of the lines of Q which belong to graph F2 • The result is a larger 
value for m. 
Similar remarks now show that the line f 
sequence P. 
We conclude therefore that not both e and f belong toP.* For brevity, 
let us assume that f ¢ P. 
However, this too leads to a contradiction because of 
the following: 
If we let Q denote the augmented sequence Q = [P, (vj,vi)sl• then 
the s-graph F1 ' defined by E(F1 ') = E(F1) fi Q gives a larger value form. 
Thus e 
belongs to F1 and the theorem is proved.

An s-graph G is said to have odd cycle property if any two odd cycles of G 
either have a vertex in common, or there exist a pair of vertices, one in each 
cycle, which are joined by a line. 
In other words, the distance between two odd 
cycles of G is at most one. The concept was first introduced by Fulkerson, et al 
in [1], 
Theorem. 
Let G be an s-graph whose complement in Kn(s) has odd cycle property. 
Then there exists an s-realization of [ki] containing G if and only if the sequence 
[ki] -
[H] is s-realizable for all subgraphs H of G. 
Clearly, the complement of an r-graph in Kn(s), where s > r + 1, has odd 
cycle property. 
Thus the theorem proved in this note follows from the general 
theorem.

THE EXISTENCE OF SMALL TACTICAL CONFIGURATIONS 
Marc J. Lipman

ABSTRACT 
A symmetric rank two tactical configuration is a regular bi-partite graph 
of girth 6. 
If it is (n+l)-regular on 2(n2+n+l+k) points it is denoted T(n,k). 
There is a polynomial, P(n) ~n4, such that T(n,k) exist for all k > P(n). 
This 
paper discusses the cases k < P(n), and some methods for finding such "small" 
T(n,k), including computational methods and the use of difference sets.

THE EXISTENCE OF SMALL TACTICAL CONFIGURATIONS 
A tactical configuration of rank r is an r-partite graph with 
r 
2 
lines between 
pairs of points in different parts, which has constant degree in each part. It is 
symmetric if the relations have equal constant degree on the parts. 
In this paper 
all tactical configurations will have girth six. 
A symmetric tactical configuration of rank two is therefore a regular bipartite 
graph of girth six, and if it is (n+l)-regular on 
2(n2+n+l+k) 
points it is denoted 
T(n,k), a generic term for that class of graphs. 
The smallest possible (n+l)-regu-
lar bipartite graph of girth six, if it exists, contains 
n2 + n + 1 points in 
each part, corresponds to an nth order projective plane, and is a 
T(n,O), hence 
the notation is reasonable. 
It is difficult to determine whether or not T(n,k) exists for arbitrary n and 
k. 
As a special case consider the existence problem for T(n,O), where the results 
of Singer, Bruck-Ryser-Chowla, and others have produced infinite classes of exis-
tence and infinite classes of non-existence, and there is still an infinite class 
for which existence is an open question. 
For general T(n,k) very little is known. 
Payne [3] has shown that there is an 
infinite class of T(n,l) which do not exist. 
The only known T(n,l) are for n = 2 
and n = 3. 
Longyear [2] has given a polynomial inn, P(n) ~ n4 , such that T(n,k) 
exist for all nand all k > P(n). 
Call a T(n,k) small if k < P(n), that is if it is smaller than the configura-
tion guaranteed by Longyear's bound. 
Aside from the nonexistence of many T(n,l) 
the existence of s~all T(n,k) is an open question. 
A T(n,k) is cyclic if for some listing of the two sets, P, L, the sets of 
points of the bi-partite T(n,k), the map: 
(mod N 
n2 + n + 1 + k) 
is a collineation, that is, considering the two sets as points and lines, the 

321 
relation of adjacency is preserved by the map. 
This is equivalent to saying that 
the adjacency matrix has a circulant (see F~gure 1).

A Cyclic T(2,1) With 0 ++ {0,1,~) 
Take a cyclic listing of a cyclic T(n,k) and look at rhe set of lines touching 
p0 , say {~ 0 • 
~ 1 •... , 
~n}. This completely determines the T(n,k) by.the cyclic map. 
A complete enumeration of the relation is: 
pi<-> {~O+i' .•• , ~n+i} 
(mod N- n2 + n + 1 + k). 
This is called the cyclic expansion of the T(n,k). 
Writing the set L as integers 1 through n2 + n + 1 + k in the good listing 
gives the following: 
The set of integers{~ , ... , ~ } is a difference set mod N a 
n2 + n + 1 + k. 
0 
n 
Further, any set of n+l integers forming a difference set mod N, N as above, deter-
mines a cyclic T(n,k). 
This follows immediately from girth 6. 
Note that these are 
not perfect difference sets if k # 0, since there are only n2 + n 
differences taken 
from n2 + n + k choices. 
Therefore the existence of cyclic T(n,k) is equivalent to the existence of 
difference sets of size n + 1 and modulus n2+n + 1 + k. 
Thus in the time-honored 
tradition of mathematics we translate the problem. 
The remainder of this paper is devoted to straightforward methods of generating 
non-perfect difference sets and some preliminary results. 
A brute force computer search is viable for low n and k. 
Note that merely 
checking all strictly increasing (n+l)-tuples is not feasible as there are: 
[N]n+l/(n+l)! > nn possible candidates. 
As a slight improvement note that the first element may be chosen to be 0. 
If 
2 
k is small enough, at least one of the n 
+ n differences will be a unit mod N, so 

322 
that the second element may be chosen to be 1, also without loss of proof of exis-
tence, although not all difference sets will be generated. 
Ewing and I have created several computer programs for the building of non-
perfect difference sets, using various heuristics to limit the search procedure in 
cases where we were reasonably sure of existence beforehand. 
Table 1 gives knovm 
results from these programs, and other work. 
A second approach generalizes the work of Hall on Cyclic Projective Planes [1]. 
He worked with perfect difference sets. 
Note that a = b(mod N) if and only if 
Xa = Xb (mod XN-1).

an equation of numbers. 
For T(n,l), having only the one difference N/2 missing we 
have: T(n,l) exist only if n + 1 or n - 1 is a sauare. 
In general, let x = ~. an Nth root of 1.

If d0 = n and d1 = 1 the equation is further reduced. 
Note that the mi 
occur in pairs svmmetric about N/2, since di- dj = N- (dj - di). 
~or example, if 
k is odd,N/2 is a missing difference. 
Finally consider the following definition. 
A difference set {d0, .•. , dn}(mod N=n2+n+l+k) is eternal for (n,k) if it is 
a~so a difference set modulo N + j for all j 
> 0. 
Then {d0, •.. ,dn} is eternal for (n,k) if and only if di < N/2 for all i, since 
then all differences di+j - di > N/2 and di - di+j > N/2, hence no coincidences 
occur at larger N. 
If {d0, ... ,dn} is eternal for (n,k) it follows that T(n,m) exist 
for all m ~ k. 
Hence in Table 1 the arrows mark eternal difference sets. 
Note that 
for every n there are eternal difference sets, but small ones are not trivial to 
find. 
If we denote the differences p1 = di - di-l as the primary differences for an 
eternal difference set, then all "positive" differences can be written as sums of 
consecutive primary differences, and if d0 = 0 the sequence of primary differences 
determines the difference set, which in turn determines the T (n ,k). 
As examples of results from these considerations, we have: 
Theorem. 
1) n > 3 implies: There are no eternal (n, 1) difference sets. 
2) n > 4 implies: There are no eternal (n, 2) or (n, 3) difference sets. 
3) N > 5 implies: There are no eternal (n,4) or (n,S) difference sets. 
Proof of 1). 
Lat {d0, ... ,dn} be an eternal differenee set for (n,l), n > 3, 
d0 = 0. 
Let {p1, ... ,pn} be the set of primary differences. 
The Pi are distinct 
positive integers. Then dn = LPi < N/2 = (n2 + n + 1 + 1)/2. 
So LPi ~ (n2 + n)/2 

324 
and since Pi are distinct {pi•••••Pn} = {1,2, ... ,n} in~ order. 
We show that 
no order will do. 
Suppose 1 is next to r < n. 
Then r + 1 is a difference ~ n, so 
r + 1 = Pj for some j, which is impossible. 
Therefore 1 can only be next ton, 
giving a difference of n + 1. Similarly 2 can only be next to n and/or n - 1. 
But if 2 is next to n - 1, and n - 1 I 2 by assumption, then (n - 1) + 2 = n + 1 
is a coincidence, which is impossible. 
Therefore 2 can only be next to n. 
But that means the order of the primary differences must be .1, n, 2. or .2, 
n, 1. 
There is no place for the remaining differences, a contradiction to n > 3. 
The proofs of 2) and 3) are similar but correspondingly more tedious. 
Conjecture: For n > 4 the smallest cyclic T(n,k) exist at k 
n - 1, except 
possibly at k = 0.

ABSTRACT 
The original definition of tactical configuration was given by E. H. Moore 
in 1896, but the definition now in use is in terms of graph theory. 
A tactical 
configuration of rank r is a collection of r disjoint vertex sets A1 , •.• ,Ar called 
bands and a relation of incidence among these vertices, so that each vertex in band 
Ai is incident with the same number of vertices in Aj. 
This constant number, say 
di,j• is called the i-j degree, and the collection of all the i-j degrees is called 
the set of degrees for the configuration. 
Note that di,j need not be equal to dj,i· 
The numbers di,i are not defined, since each band is composed of independent ver-
tices. 
Thus a tactical configuration may be regarded as a multiregular, r-partite 
graph. 
The girth of a graph, or of a tactical configuration regarded as a graph, 
is the number of vertices in any smallest polygon in the graph.

TACTICAL CONFIGURATIONS: 
AN INTRODUCTION 
The original definition of tactical configuration was given by E. H. Moore in 
1896, but the definition now in use is in terms of graph theory. 
A tactical con-
figuration of rank r is a collection of r disjoint vertex sets A1 , •.• , Ar called 
bands and a relation of incidence among these vertices, so that each vertex in band 
Ai is incident with the same number of vertices in Aj. 
This constant number, say 
dij• is called the i-j degree, and the collection of all the i-j degrees is called 
the set of degrees for the configuration. 
Note that di,j need not be equal to di,j· 
The numbers di,j are not defined, since each band is composed of independent vertices. 
Thus a tactical configuration may be regarded as a multiregular, r-partite graph. 
The girth of a graph, or of a tactical configuration regarded as a graph, is the 
number of vertices in any smallest polygon in the graph. 
Examples of rank 2 configurations are abundant. 
A projective plane of order n 
is a configuration with degree set {n,n}, girth 6, and both bands of cardinality 
n2 + n + 1. 
Again identifying points or treatments as one band and lines or blocks 
as the other, BIBD which parameters (b,v,r,k,A) are configurations with degree set 
{r,k} and girth 6 or 4 as A = 1 or A > 1. 
There are many others, such as Steiner 
systems, generalized quadrangles and generalized polygons. 
In more practical areas 
tactical configurations occur in traffic flow patterns, herd genealogies, the study 
of protein decompositions and coding theory.; see the bibliography. 
The question of which configurations exist is still largely unresolved. 
A set 
of degrees is called constructive if there are positive integers a 1, .•• , ar which 
satisfy the obvious requirements di,j ai = dj,i aj. It is known that if Dis a con-
structive set of degrees, and if the girth is chosen either arbitrarily, or arbi-
trarily even in the case of rank 2, then there are very large configurations having 
the chosen girth and the degree set D. 
Some simple arguments show that there are 
lower bounds for the possible cardinalities of the bands, thus the major unresolved 
question is: 

327 
(1) 
For which band cardinalities do configurations with given girth and degree 
set exist? 
This question is not easy, since it includes the question of the projective 
plane of order 10, but it has some relatively amenable parts. 
For example, all the 
numerically possible rank 2 configurations of girth 6 and degrees {3,4} exist. 
The 
smallest of these is a BIBD with parameters (12,9,3,4,1). 
It is of some interest to 
determine the least cardinalities for which configurations of rank 2 exist. 
The nuaerical lower bound for JA1 J is 1 + t + st, and that for JA2 J is 
1 + s + st. Clearly, unless s = t, JA1 J must be slightly larger than 1 + t + st 
(if one makes the usual assumption that s ~ t). If we let r be the excess in JA1 J 
over 1 + t + st and let JA2 J = 1 + s + st + w, then r and w satisfy: 
(A) 
(l+s)r = st(t-s) + (l+t)w • 
Projective planes and BIBD's occur when (A) can be satisfied with w = 0 and a 
configuration constructed on JA1J + JA2 J 
vertices. 
The Bruck-Ryser-Chowla theorem 
gives conditions on s and t under which this numerical lower bound cannot be 
achieved. 
No research seems to have been done on those remaining extremal cases 
where 1 + s t 0 (mod st(t-s)), and so the most interesting theoretical challenge is: 
(2) 
Find and prove the analogues to the Bruck-Rvser-Chowla theorem, that is, 
give conditions on the degrees and girth which guarantee that the smallest configu-
ration with these narameters has larger band sizes than is numerically necessarv. 
As an example of the need for such a theorem, the numeric lower bound on a 
girth 6 configuration with degrees d1 2 . 
0 
is 7 vertices in each band, but the smallest so far known has 21 vertices in each 
band. 
Almost nothing is known for r ~ 3 or for girth~ 8, and if r ~3 then nothing 
is known for girth ~5. Indeed, the major problem in construction is to prove that 
the constructed configuration has the desired girth. 
In order to show that a con-
figuration has girth in excess of g, one must demonstrate that it is impossible to 
have any polygon of smaller size with vertices in the various bands. 
For girth 6, 

328 
this means checking one case for rank 2, 13 cases for rank 3 and 67 cases for rank 
4. 
In fact, it is a combinatorial problem of some interest to determine how many 
cases there are. 
Since all the practical applications of configurations, and most of the classic 
forms, have the property that onlv bands with consecutive subscripts have positive 
degrees, it is certainly practical to confine the investigation of configurations 
to these "pathlike" ones, at least until someone has developed a more powerful 
technioue for examining girth. 
Again for girth 6, the number of cases to determine 
in the pathlike case is one for rank 2, 3 for rank 3, and 5 for rank 4, 
As an exam-. 
ple of the power of the pathlike restriction, we construct girth 4 configurations of 
every size and every pathlike constructive degree set D. 
Given that D is construc-
tive, it is an easv exercise in number theory to determine which band cardinalities 
are possible. 
Since the degree set is pathlike, the construction will automatically 
produce a configuration of girth of at least 4, since no triangle is possible in a 
pathlike configuration. 
Thus, we need onlv exhibit a construction for rank 2, and 
the finished configuration consists of r-1 of these incidence relations used in con-
junction. 
Suppose that the selected pair of degrees are m and k, that (m,k) = d and 
that m = dM, and k = dK where (M,K) = 1. 
The possible band cardinalities are M(d+i) 
and K(d+i), where i is any nonnegative integer. 
Label the vertices of one band to 
the numbers less than M(d+i), and have a vertex j from the first band adjacent 
a vertex n from the second band iff j is congruent with one of n+l, n+2, ... , n+m 
(modulo K(d+k)), where m ~ k. 
Another technique which avoids proving girth cases is a doubling technique. 
Let T be configuration of girth g and degrees D, then the double of T has as bands 
two disjoint copies of each band of T. 
The copies are called first and second, and 
a vertex from a first copy is adjacent with a vertex from a second copy iff they 
were adjacent vertices in the original configuration. It is clear that this cannot 
lower girth, and in some cases raises girth, since it takes odd polygons into poly-
gons of twice the length. 
Doubling may also be used to produce a rank 2 configura-
tion from a regular graph. 
Used this way, the double of the 3-regular Moore graph 
of girth 5 is a configuration of girth 6, since the hexagon not in the skeleton 

329 
doubles into a pair of hexagons. 
Again, the 3-regular ~cGee graph of girth 7 
vields a configuration of girth 8, due to an octagon in the original. 
There are many other constructions for small configurations, particularly for 
BIBD, but very few are known for larger configurations.

STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATIONS OF STABILITY 
OF SIGNED DIGRAPHS UNDER PULSE PROCESSES* 
Fred S. Roberts 
Rutgers University 
ABSTRACT 
The notion of a pulse process on a signed digraph arose in connection 
with studies of energy demand and other societal problems. 
Two notions of 
stability of a signed digraph D under a pulse process, pulse and value 
stability, have been characterized in terms of the eigenspace of the transpose 
of the signed adjacency matrix of D. 
In this paper, conditions for stability 
stated in terms of the structure of the signed digraph are studied.

STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATIONS OF STABILITY 
OF SIGNED DIGRAPHS UNDER PULSE PROCESSES 
1. 
PULSE PROCESSES 
In applying signed digraphs to the study of energy demand and other societal 
problems, one encounters the notion of a pulse process (see Roberts [5,6], and 
Brown and Roberts [1]). 
In this paper, we study two notions of stability of a 
signed digraph under a pulse process and discuss possible characterizations of 
stability which relate to the structure of the signed digraph. 
We shall use the digraph terminology of Harary, Norman, and Cartwright [4]. 
A digraph D with a sign (+ or -) on each arc will be called a signed digraph. 
The 
signed adjacency matrix A= A(D) = [akjl 
is defined as expected. 
The sign of a 
path, sequence, cycle, or semicycle in D is the product of the signs of its arcs. 
Let x1,x2, ••• ,xn be the nodes of the signed digraph D and suppose that at 
each discrete timet, each node kj attains a value vj(t). In a simple pulse process 
starting at node xi , one assumes 
vj(O) = 0 , all j, and defines vj(t+l) as 
follows: 
n 
vj(t+l) = vj(t) + L akj Pk(t) , 
k=l 
where pk(t) 
is vk(t) - vk(t-1) 
if t > 0, 1 if t = 0 and k = i, and 0 if t = 0 
and k ~ i. The number Pk(t) is called the pulse at node xk at time t. 
For a 
discussion of the definition of simple pulse process, the reader is referred to 
Roberts [5]. 
Sometimes it is convenient to refer to the starting node. 
Thus in 
a simple pulse process starting at xi , we denote 
Pj(t) by pt(xi,xj). 
These numbers can be calculated using A(D). 
Theorem 1. ((5]) 
(a) 
pt(xi,xj) is given by the difference between the number of 
positive sequences from xi to xj of length t and the number of negative sequences 
from xi to xj of length t, which in turn is given by the i,j entry of At. 
(b) 
vt(xi,xj) 
is given by the difference between the number of positive 
sequences from xi to xj of length at most t and the number of negative sequences 
from xi to xj of length at most t, which in turn is given by the i,j entry of 

332 
A+ A2 + ••• , +At 
A node y in D is said to be pulse stable (under all simple pulse processes) 
if the sequence 
{ IPt(x,y)l: t = 0,1, •.• } is bounded for every x, and value stable 
(under all simple pulse processes) if the sequence {lvt(x,y)l: t = 0,1, •.• } is 
bounded for every x. 
Finally, D is said to be pulse or value stable if each node 
is. 
2. 
CHARACTERIZATIONS OF STABILITY 
Questions of stability can be reduced to the eigenspace of the matrix S, the 
transpose of the signed adjacency matrix A. 
We shall refer to the eigenvalues of 
S as the eigenvalues of D. 
Suppose J is the Jordan Canonical Form corresponding 
to S. 
We say that an eigenvalue A of S is linked if in J there appears a 
2 x 2 submatrix of the form: 
[ 8 
~ J 
The following characterizations of stability, proved in Brown and Roberts [1], can 
now be stated: 
Theorem 2. 
A signed digraph D is pulse stable if and only if every nonzero 
eigenvalue of D has magnitude equal to unity and no nonzero eigenvalue of D is 
linked. 
Theorem 3. 
A signed digraph D is value stable if and only if it is pulse stable 
and unity is not an eigenvalue of D. 
Unfornately, neither theorem gives conditions in terms of the structure of 
the digraph or signed digraph. 
We would like, therefore, to pose the following 
questions. 
Question 1: 
What structural condition on a signed digraph corresponds to 
the condition that all nonzero eigenvalues have magnitude unity? 
Question 2: 
What structural condition corresponds to the condition that 
there are linked eigenvalues? 
Question 3: 
What structural condition corresponds to pulse stability? 

333 
Question 4: 
What structural condition corresponds to value stability? 
Similar questions could be asked for weighted digraphs, digraphs where the 
sign of an arc is replaced by a weight (a positive or negative real number). 
Al-
though we shall not answer these questions totally, we shall mention some partial 
results concerning Questions 3 and 4. 
3. 
ROSETTES 
A (signed) digraph D is a rosette if it has more than one node and either D 
consists of a single cycle or D is strongly connected and has exactly one node x, 
the central node, with more than one arc leading into it. Rosettes are easily 
seen to be exactly those digraphs with a central node x and nonintersecting cycles 
leading out of x. 
Some rosettes are shown in Figure 1.

Stability theory for rosettes settles a number of questions about stability 
in general. 
It has also turned out to be useful in practice (see Roberts [6]). 
Stability in rosettes reduces to stability at the central node x. 
In fact, the 
situation is even simpler than that. 
Let us say a node x of a signed digraph is 
self-stable in pulse(or in value)if the sequence 
IPt(x,x)ICor the sequence 
lvt(x,x)l) is bounded. 
We have 
Theorem 4. 
A rosette with central node x is pulse or value stable if and only if 
x is self-stable in pulse or value respectively. 
Proof. 
We use Theorem 1 to calculate vt(y,z). 
Suppose first that every path 
from y to z goes through x. 
Suppose that the unique path Pyx 
from y to x has 
length r and the unique path Pxz 
from x to z has length s. 
Then 
vt(y,z) = + vt-r-s(x,x), since every sequence from y to z consists of P 
, a 
-
~ 
sequence from x to x, plus 
Pxz" 
If there is a path from y to z not going through 
x, let this path have length rand sign cr. 
Then vt(y,z) = (cr)l+(cr)vt-rcz,z), 
which reduces to the first case. 
Similar reasoning applies to pt(y,z). 

334 
This result generalizes to what we shall call advanced rosettes. 
A (signed) 
digraph D is an advanced rosette if it has more than one node and either D is a 
single cycle or D is strongly connected and there is exactly one node x, the cen-
tral node, which is on all cycles in D. 
Theorem 5. 
An advanced rosette with central node x is pulse or value stable if 
and only if x is self-stable in pulse or value respectively. 
Proof. The result follows from Theorem 4 if Dis a single cycle. 
If Dis not a 
single cycle, note that for all y and z in D, there are only finitely many sequences 
from y to z not going through x. 
Then, to go from y to z, except for finitely many 
sequences, one first goes from y to x (in finitely many ways), then x to x, and 
then x to z (in finitely many ways.) 
It should be remarked that the notion of local self-stability is not in general 
sufficient even for local stability, though it is in advanced rosettes.

To give a counterexample, note that in the signed digraph D of Figure 2a, node 
x is value self-stable but vt(y,x) 
tends to 
+oo . Even global self-stability 
(each node self-stable) is not sufficient for stability. 
For, consider the signed 
digraph D of Figure 2b. 
Each node is value self-stable. 
But node x is not value 
stable. It is not even pulse stable, for 
p3+2k(y,x) = (-l)k(k+l) 
This follows 

335 
since to get from y to x in 3+2k steps, one goes m times through node a and then 
k-m times through node b, and each choice of m = O,l, ••• ,k gives a different se-
quence. 
It might be conjectured that the additional assumption that D be strongly 
connected is sufficient for global (local) self-stability to imply global (local) 
stability. 
But it follows from a counterexample, due to Joel Spencer, that this 
conjecture is also false. 
Let D be the signed digraph of Figure 2c, 
Then each node 
is value self-stable. 
For, to get from any point 
a ~ u,v to a, one first goes 
from a to x and then, after hitting x for the last time, one returns to a. 
But for 
each such sequence whose last return goes through u, there is a corresponding one 
of equal length and opposite sign whose last return goes through v. 
Thus, a is 
value stable. 
To get from u to u, one first goes from u to y and then y to u. 
The 
first trip toy can be either through i or through j. Thus there is again a one-
to-one correspondence between these sequences, and so u is value self-stable. 
Simi-
larly, v is value self-stable. 
Finally, the node x is not value stable, or even 
pulse stable. 
The sequences from y to x which go through x more than once divide 
into those using u and those using v, and these cancel out as before. 
The calcu-
lation of pt(y,x) 
thus reduces to considering sequences which go from y to x 
without using x more than once, and this calculation is analogous to that for the 
signed digraph of Figure 2b. 
The theory of pulse and value stability in advanced rosettes has been studied 
in detail in a Rand Corporation Report by T. A. Brown, F. S. Roberts, and J. Spencer. 
The results obtained are stated in terms of the rosette sequence, 
the sequence 
(a1,a2, ... ,as), where ai is the sum of the signs of the cycles of length i and s 
is the maximal integer so that as ~ 0 . The following theorems are proved in the 
that report for rosettes, and it is observed that the same proofs apply to advanced 
rosettes. 
Theorem 6. 
If an advanced rosette is pulse stable, then as 
ai = (-as)(as-i)' 
1 < i < s-1 
+ 1 
and 

336 
Theorem 7. 
A pulse stable advanced rosette is value stable if and only if 
~ai I 1, i.e., if and only if the number of positive cycles is not exactly one 
i 
more than the number of negative cycles. 
4. 
RELATIONS BETWEEN BALANCE AND STABILITY 
It was pointed out in Roberts [5] that positive cycles in a signed digraph D, 
otherwise known as balanced cycles after the work of Harary [3] and Cartwright and 
Harary [2], contribute to the instability of D under pulse processes. 
In this 
section we summarize some results about the relations between balance and stability. 
A signed digraph is (cycle) balanced at the node x if each cycle through x is 
balanced, and it is balanced if each node is balanced. 
We shall use the terms 
local and global balance, respectively, for these two notions. 
To begin with, we observe that global balance (under certain circumstances) 
implies (global) value instability, but local balance does not imply local value 
instability. 
Theorem 8. If a signed digraph D is (globally) balanced and has at least one cycle, 
then D is value unstable. 
Proof. If the node x is on a cycle, then note that all sequences from x to x are 
positive and there are infinitely many. 
Theorem 9. There is a signed digraph D which is balanced at a node x and value 
stable at x. 
Proof. 
Let D be the signed digraph of Figure 3. 
Note that 
z 
D is balanced at node x. 
Since D is a rosette, it is by 
+ 
Theorem 4 sufficient to show that D is value self-stable at 
y. 
But to get from y to y in t steps, one can go through 
z a certain number of times and through x a certain number 
+ 
+ 
of times, in any order. 
A simple counting argument shows 
that there are exactly as many positive sequences as ne-
X 
gative ones. 
Figure 3 

337 
In cer~ain balanced signed digraphs, we can give a more complete description 
of the value unstable nodes. 
Let us say that D is semicycle balanced if each 
semicycle of D is positive. 
Let us say that node x is reachable from node y if 
there is a path in D from y to x. 
Theorem 10. If a signed digraph D is semicycle balanced, then a node x of D is 
value unstable if and only if it is reachable from a node y which is on a cycle. 
Proof. Note that for all nodes a and b, all sequences from a to b have the same 
sign, by Theorem 13.2 of Harary, Norman, and Cartwright [4]. 
Now suppose xis 
reachable from a node y which is on a cycle. 
Then there are infinitely many 
sequences from y to x. 
Each such sequence has the same sign. 
Thus, x is value 
unstable. 
If x is not reachable from any node y which is on a cycle, then for all 
y, the number of sequences from y to x is the same as the number of paths, a finite 
number. 
It should be noted that cycle balance (rather than semicycle balance) is not 
a sufficient condition in Theorem 10. 
To give a counterexample, consider the signed 
digraph D of Figure 4. 
D is cycle balanced but the semicycle y,a,x,b is unbalanced. 
~X 
+ 
+ 
b 
The node y is on a cycle and x is reachable from y, 
but x is value stable since the number of positive 
sequences of length t from any node to x is the 
Figure 4 
same as the number of negative sequences. 
According to the proof of Theorem 10, it is sufficient to assume in place of 
semicycle balance the following sequence condition: for all pairs of nodes a and b, 
all sequences from a to b have the same sign. 
Thus, it is also sufficient to assume 
in place of semicycle balance the conditions that D be cycle balanced and that for 
all pairs of nodes a and b, all paths from a to b have the same sign. 
For it is 
easy to show that the sequence condition follows from these two assumptions. 
In closing, let us define a signed digraph as totally unbalanced at x if all 
cycles through x are negative, and (globally) totally unbalanced if every ~ode is. 
Although global balance implies value instability, at least for signed digraphs with 
cycles, global total unbalance does not imply value stability. 
To give a counter-

example, consider the signed digraph D of Figure

two steps.

THE CHARM BRACELET PROBLEM AND ITS APPLICATIONS* 
Paul K. Stockmeyer 
College of William and Mary 
ABSTRACT 
The necklace problem has proved to be both a sound pedagogical device in 
teaching enumeration theory and a valuable counting tool with several graphical 
applications. 
In this paper we solve the more general charm bracelet problem and 
provide two applications for which the necklace problem in not sufficient. 
We set the stage in Section 1 by providing a brief review of the necklace 
problem. 
This serves as a basis for comparison in Section 2, where we discuss the 
charm bracelet problem and derive its solution. 
Sections 3 and 4 contain nontri-
vial graphical applications of the results of Section 2. 
Definitions for all graphical terms and concepts can be found in [3], 
For 
further background and broader treatment of topics of an enumerative nature, [5] 
should be consulted.

THE CHARM BRACELET PROBLEM AND ITS APPLICATIONS 
1. 
NECKLACES 
The necklace problem asks for the number N of closed necklaces with n equally 
spaced beads, each of which is one of m colors or types. 
Two necklaces are con-
sidered the same if one can be rotated or reflected into the other. 
The 6 distinct 
necklaces for n = 4, m = 2 are illustrated in Figure 1.

A full discussion of the solution, using the enumeration methods of P6lya [11], can 
be found either in [5, page 44], [3, page 183], or [4]. 
Essentially one uses the 
cycle index 
Z(Dn) 
of the dihedral group of degree n, defined by

The answer is obtained by replacing each variable zi with the integer m: 
(2) 
N = Z(Dn; m,m, ••• ,m) 
We note that 
Z(D4 ; 2,2,2,2) = 6, in agreement with Figure 1. 
In many applications, each type of bead is assigned a weight, typically a 
non-negative integer. 
The weight of a necklace is defined to be the sum of the 
weight of its beads. 
If bi is the number of types of beads with weight i, then 
b(x) = Ebixi is the generating function for beads by weight, frequently called 
the figure counting series. 
Similarly, if Ni is the number of necklaces with 

weight i, then the generating function 
341 
N(x) = l:N.xi 
l. 
is often called the con-
figuration counting series. Polya's Theorem [11] relates these two series to 
obtain the formula 
(3) 
N(x) 
Equation (2) is clearly a special case of (3), obtained by setting x equal 
to 1. 
A typical graphical application of the necklace problem is the enumeration of 
unicyclic graphs, described in [12, page 148]. 
In this situation a 'bead' is a 
rooted tree, whose weight is its number of points. If t(x) is the generating 
function for rooted trees, then it follows that the generating function 
Un(x) 
for unicyclic graphs with cycle length n is 
(4) 
2. 
CHARM BRACELETS 
The charm bracelet problem is similar to the necklace problem except that 
flat charms are attached to the frame instead of beads. 
These charms are assumed 
to be firmly fixed to the frame and cannot be rotated or turned over unless the 
corresponding operation is performed on the entire necklace. 
Some charms are 
asymmetric; that is, a reflection of the necklace (and hence its charms) does not 
affect their appearance. 
They can be fastened to the frame in essentially only 
one way. 
Other charms are non-symmetric. 
They are different from their mirror 
images, and can be attached to the frame in either of two possible orientations. 
As with necklaces, two charm bracelets are considered the same if one can be 
either rotated or reflected into the other. 
We illustrate these concepts in 
Figure 2, which contains the seven bracelets with three charms drawn from a stock 
of two types, one symmetric and one non-symmetric. 
Suppose we have ~ types of symmetric charms and b types of non-symmetric 
charms. 
Since each non-symmetric charm can be attached in two ways, there is a 
total of 
c = a+ 2b 
possibilities at each position on the bracelet. 
Thus there 
are en different "fixed" or "positioned" bracelets. 
In order to determine the 

342 
number of inequivalent bracelets, we use the famous orbit counting formula due to 
Burnside [1, page 191]. 
Figure 2. 
Examples of Charm Bracelets 
Burnside's Theorem. 
Let G be a permutation group acting on a set S, and for each 
g£G, let H(g) be the number of elements of S fixed by g. 
The number O(G} of orbits 
of G is given by 
(5) 
O(G) 
In applying this theorem, we take S to be the set of en different fixed 
bracelets. 
For G we take the group induced on S by the dihedral group Dn of de-
gree n acting on the bracelet frame. 
Thus for each of the n rotations and n 
reflections of Dn we must determine the number of bracelets that are left unchanged 
by such action. 
We consider first the n rotations. 
As is well known, for each integer i 
dividing n, there are ~(i) rotations each consisting of d/i cycles of length i. 
Clearly a bracelet will be unchanged by such rotation if and only if the same 
charm is attached, with the same orientation, to each place in any cycle. 
Thus 
there are cn/i bracelets fixed by each of the ~(i) rotations, for i dividing n. 

343 
In considering the n reflections, it is convenient to consider first the case 
n odd. 
In this case a reflection consists of (n-1)/2 transpositions and one fixed 
place. 
In order for a bracelet to be fixed by a reflection, the same charm must 
occur on both places of any transposition. Moreover, a symmetric charm must be at-
tached at the fixed place. 
Thus for each of the n reflections there are a•c(n-l)/2 
bracelets fixed by that action. 
In the even case there are two types of reflections. 
Half of them consist of 
n/2 transpositions, while the other half contain (n-2)/2 transpositions and 2 fixed 
places. 
Arguing as above, there are cn/ 2 bracelets fixed by the first type of 
reflection and a2-c(n-2 )/2 bracelets unchanged by the second. 
The results of the above discussion can be summarized in a form that will be 
of use later. 
We define the modified cycle index 
Z(Dn*) of the group Dn by

If one wishes to use generating functions to count charm bracelets by weight, 
the following weighted form of Burnside's theorem is needed. 
A proof can be found 
in [3, page 180]. 
Burnside's Theorem, Weighted Form. 
Let G be a permutation group acting on a set S, 
and let w be a function that assigns a weight to each orbit of G. 
Each element 
sES is assigned the weight of the orbit in which it is contained. 
Then the gen-
erating function for orbits of G by weight is 
(8)

where the product is over all s£5 fixed by the permutation g. 
Again we take S to be set of en different fixed bracelets. 
The generating 
functions for symmetric and non-symmetric charms are denoted 
i 
a(x) = l:aix , and 
b(x) = l:bixi, respectively, and we define c(x) = a(x) + 2b(x) • CB(x) will denote 
the generating function for charm bracelets by weight. It is an easy exercise to 
show that in the case of charm bracelets, formula (8) can be computed from the 
modified cycle index of the group Dn by replacing each variable zi with the series 
c(xi) and the variable y by the series a(x). 
This yields the following main result: 
Charm Bracelet Theorem. 
The generating function CB(x) for charm bracelets with n 
charms is given by 
(9) 
CB(x) 
Z(Dn*; c(x,), c(x2), ••• ,c(xn) ,a(x)). 
If all the charms happen to be symmetric, we have b(x) = 0 and thus c(x) = a(x). 
In this case equation (9) is identical to (3). 
Hence we see that the necklace pro-
blem can be viewed as a special case of the more general charm bracelet problem. 
3. 
TRIANGULATION OF POLYGONS 
Our first application provides a new solution to a problem first solved by 
R. Guy [2] and subsequently solved by Moon and Moser [9] and by Harary and Palmer 
[5]. 
The problem is to determine the number of ways of dissecting a regular 
(n + 2)-gon into n triangles by n-1 non-intersecting diagonals. 
Two dissections 
that differ only by a rotation or reflection will be considered the same. 
It is 
easy to verify that there is a unique dissection for n = 1, 2, and 3, while for 
n = 4 there are 3 distinct triangulations. 
We first must count verious classes of rooted triangulations. 
For n ~ 1, let 
an and bn denote the number of triangulations of an (n + 2)-gon rooted at a symme-
tric and non-symmetric exterior edge, respectively. 
For convenience we set a0 = 1, 
representing a degenerate 2-gon, or edge. 
Further, we set en = an + 2bn, so that 
en is the number of triangulations rooted at an oriented exterior edge. 
We define 
a(x), b(x), and c(x) to be the generating functions corresponding to the sequences 
an, bn, and en respectively. 

345 
It is easily seen (see, for example, [5]), that the function c(x) satisfies 
the equation 
(10) 
c(x) = 1 + x·c2(x) 
which, when solved for c(x), yields 
(11) 
c(x) = 1 -
{1 -_4x) 112 
2x 
Expanding, one obtains 
(12) 
c(x) 
{2n)! 
xn· 
n! (n+l)! 
1 + x + 2x2 + 5x3 + 14x4 + 42x5 + 132x6 + 429x7 + 1430x8 
+ 4862x9 + 16,796x10 + ... , 
a result apparently known to Euler. 
In order to determine a(x), we note that a triangulated polygon rooted at a 
symmetric exterior edge can be constructed by first placing a triangle on the edge 
and then attaching mirror image exterior~edge~rooted triangulated polygons to the 
two new edges. 
Translated into generating functions, this implies 
(13) 
a(x) 
Then we have 
(14)

10 
+ 8,398x 
+ ... 
He now use the charm bracelet theorem to determine the generating function 
~(x) for the number Fn of triangulated (n+2)-gons rooted at one of the triangles. 
Clearly such a polygon can be considered a bracelet of three charms, each of which 
is an exterior-edge-rooted triangulated polygon. 
Thus we have 
(15) 
F(x) = x Z(D3*;

+ 2,424x9 + 8,398x10 + .••. 

346 
Another intermediate result we need is the number Hn of triangulated polygons 
rooted at an interior edge. 
The corresponding generating function is again found 
by using the charm bracelet theorem, this time with two charms. 
We have 
(16) 
H(x) 
Z(D2*; c(x)-1, a(x)-1) 
x2 + x3 + 5x4 + 12x5 + 45x6 + 143x7 + 5llx8 + 1768x9 
+ .... 
We will call an interior edge of a triangulated polygon svmmetric if the poly-
gon possesses an automorphism that interchanges the two triangles incident with the 
edge. 
The remaining intermediate result we need is the number Jn of polygons rooted 
at a svmmetric interior edge. 
The generating function for this sequence can be 
shown to be 
(17) 
J(x) = c(x2) - 1 
x2 + 
x4 + 5x6 + 14x8 + 42x10 + ••• 
In order to determine the number Kn of unrooted triangulated polygons we fol-
low the standard method for unrooted trees, developed bv Otter [10] and applied 
repeatedlv in [6]. 
In this case, the method yields 
(18) 
K(x) 
F(x) - H(x) + J(x) 
x + x2 + x3 + 3x4 + 4x5 + 12x6 + 27x7 + 82x8 + 228x9 + 
He can find a closed form for the coefficients of K(x) by using equations (10), 
(13,, (15), (16), and (17) to express K(x) in terms of c(x) only, and then using the 
closed form for the coefficients of c(x) given by (12). 
If one interprets as zero 
any term containing a nonintegral factorial, then the number Kn can be expressed as 
(19) 
~ = 
(2n-l)!

3(n-l)! 
(n-1)! (n+2) I

3((n-l)/3)!((n+2)/3)! 
(n-2)! 
+ ((n-3)/2)!((n+l)/2! 
Incidentally, the number K16 is given incorrectly as 1,046,609 in both [2] and 
[5]. 
The correct number is 983,244. 
Asvmptotically, the first term of (19) is clearly the dominant one.

PROJECTIVE PLANE TREES 
A plane tree is a tree that has been embedded in the (Euclidean) plane. 
Two 
plane trees are ismorphic if there exists an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of 
the plane onto itself that maps one onto the other. 
Plane trees have been counted 
by Harary, Prins, and Tutte [7]. 
We define a projective plane tree, or PPT, as a tree that has been embedded in 
the real projective plane. 
Two PPT's are isomorphic if any homeomorphism of the 
projective plane onto itself maps one onto the other. 
Thus while a PPT is always 
isomorphic to its mirror image, a plane tree might not be. 
Consequently there are 
fewer PPT's than plane trees on n points, for n > 7. 
In this section we count the 
number of isomorphism classes of PPT's on n points for each positive integer n. 
As usual, we must first obtain a few preliminary results. 
For n > 2 we let an 
and bn denote now the number of planted PPT's on n + 1 points that are symmetric 
and non-symmetric, respectively. 
Again we set cn = an + 2bn , so that now cn is the 
number of planted plane trees on n + 1 points. 
Also, a(x), b(x), and c(x) will 
again denote the corresponding generating functions. 
The somewhat surprising fact that the numbers Cn are again the Catalan numbers 
of Section 3 was noted in [7]:

A planted PPT can be constructed by identifying the roots of any number of 
smaller planted PPT's. 
In particular, a symmetric planted PPT can be constructed 
from either none or one smaller symmetric planted PPT together with any number of 
pairs of arbitrary planted plane trees. 
Thus 
(22) 
a(x) 
x(l + a(x))(l + c(x2) + c2(x2) + ••• ) 
x(l + a(x)) 
1 - c(x2) 
Solving for a(x), we have 
23) 
a(x) = ------~x~--~-
1 - x - x(x2) 
X+ x2 + 2X3 + 3X4 + 6x5 + 1Qx6 + 2Qx7 + 35x8 + 70x9 + ••• 

348 
from which we obtain 
(24) 
b(x) = c(x) ; a(x) 
A rooted PPT can clearly be considered as a charm bracelet in which the charms 
are ?lanted plane trees. 
Letting ~ denote the number of rooted PPT's with n points 
and R(X) the corresponding generating function, the charm bracelet theorem yields · 
(25) 
R(x) = x Z(Dn*; c(x), c(x2), ••. , c(xn),a(x)), 
where the sum is taken from n = 0 to oo, 
Explicitly, we have 
(26) 
R(x) • x + x2 + 2x3 + 4x4 + 9x5 + 21x6 + 56x7 + 15Sx8 + 469x9 
10 
+ 1,480x 
+ ... 
A line-rooted PPT can be considered a bracelet with two charms. 
Thus the 
generating function L(x) for line-rooted PPT's satisfies 
(27) 
L(x) 
Z(D2*; c(x), c(x2), a(x)) 
= x2 + x3 + 3x4 + 6x5 + 17x6 + 44x7 + 133x8 + 404x9 + 1319x10 
+ 1319x10 + ... 
Further, it is easily seen that the generating function S(x) for PPT's rooted 
at a symmetry edge is given by 
(28) 
S(x) = c(x2} 
x2 + x4 + 2x6 + Sx8 + 14x10 + ... 
To obtain the generating function T(x) for unrooted PPT's, we again utilize 
the Otter formula, 
(29) 
T(x) 
R(x) - L (x) + S(x) 
x + x2 + x3 + 2x4 + 3x5 + 6x6 + 12x7 + 27x8 + 6Sx9 
+ 17Sx10 + .... 
CONCLUSIONS 
Neither of the two preceeding problems is new. 
At least three distinct solu-
tions to the triangulation problem have been published, and the number of projective 
plane trees can be obtained from results in [8], although the answer is not given 
explicitly. 
However, the method is new, and offers a unified approach to problems 
previously solved on an ad hoc basis. 
The formulas can be used, for example, 

349 
to solve almost any problem involving counting of configurations embedded in the 
plane, where rotations and reflections of configurations are not considered distinct.

ON TUTTE'S FACTORIZATION THEOREM 
David P. Sumner 
University of South Carolina 
ABSTRACT 
Tutte characterized graphs without 1-factors by showing that such graphs 
never contain a set S whose removal results in more odd components than the 
cardinality of S. 
In this paper, such a set S is called an antifactor set. 
The minimal (with respect to containment) antifactor sets are studied, and we 
answer the questions: 
(1) 
What type of points belong to a minimal antifactor 
set? 
(2) 
Where are the minimal antifactor sets of a graph G located? and (3) 
What bounds can be placed on the size of a minimal antifactor set? 
As a conse-
quence of the theorems that answer these questions, we obtain several sufficient 
conditions for the existence of a 1-factor in a graph G.

ON TUTTE'S FACTORIZATION THEORM 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
In this paper, all undefined terminologv will conform with that in Harary [4]. 
In particular, a graph G will consist of a finite set ~T(G) of points and a set E(G) 
of unordered pairs of distinct points. 
The elements of E(r,) are called lines. 
If G is a graph, then a 1-factor of G is a spanning subgraph that is regular 
of degree one. 
It is worthwhile to observe that a 1-factor of a graph G having 
order p may alternately be viewed as a partition of the points into two-element sub-
sets in such a wav that the elements of each subset are adjacent. 
In [6], Tutte characterized graphs that possess a 1-factor. 
An odd (even) 
component of a graph is a component having an odd (even) number of points. 
Theorem 1. 
(Tutte): 
A graph G has a 1-factor iff there does not exist a set 
S S. V(G) such that G- S has more than lsi odd components. 
When given a graph G and asked if it has a 1-factor, we need only exhibit any 
particular 1-factor to verify that the answer is yes. 
On the other hand, if G does 
not have a 1-factor, how can we prove it without simply asserting that we tried 
everything and failed? 
As a consequence of Tutte 1s theorem, we need only exhibit 
an appropriate set S and any skeptic may easily check for himself that S satisfies 
the conditions of Tutte's characterization and thereby see that the graph has no 
1-factor. It is because Tutte's result yields such a convenient way of verifying 
that a graph does not have a 1-factor that the characterization must be considered 
a good one in the sense of Edmonds. 
A particularly nice discussion of this may be 
found in Chvatal [3]. 
As an example, consider the graph 
0 
This graph does not have a 1-factor as may be seen by choosing the darkened points 
for the set S. 
Moreover, in this case, no other choice for S would serve. 

352 
It is our purpose in this paper to attempt to come to a fuller understanding 
of the properties of the set S in Tutte's theorem. 
In this way it is hoped that the 
theorem will be enhanced somewhat. 
First we give such sets a name. 
Definition: If G is a graph and 
S <: V(G) 
such that G- S has more than lsi odd 
components, then S will be called an antifactor set. If in addition no proper sub-
set of S is also an antifactor set, then S will be called a minimal antifactor set. 
For a minimal antifactor set sC: V(G), we shall consider the following three 
questions: 
(1) 
What types of points can S contain? 
(2) 
What is the location of S within G? 
(3) 
What bounds can be placed on the cardinality of S? 
The proofs of many of the results in this paper are omitted and will appear 
elsewhere. 
2. 
THE TYPE OF POINTS IN A MINIMAL ANTIFACTOR SET 
Definition: 
A point v of a graph G will be called a star center iff v is the 
center of an induced 
K1,3 . 
Thus v is a star center iff v is adjacent to three 
independent points. 
Theorem 2. 
If G is a connected graph of even order that does not have a !-factor 
and if S is a minimal antifactor set for G, then every element of S is a star cen-
ter. 
As a consequence of this result, we may restate Tutte's theorem as follows. 
Theorem 3. 
A graph G has a !-factor iff there does not exist a set S of star cen-
ters of G such that G- S has more than lsi odd components. 
Corollary 1. 
If G is a connected graph with no induced 
K1 , 3 , then G has a 
!-factor iff G has even order. 
This corollary is also a special case of the following theorem that is proved 
in Sumner [5]. 
Theorem 4. 
If G is a connected graph of even order 
p ~ 4 
that does not contain 
a !-factor, then for every k where 4 < k ~ p , 
G contains a connected, induced sub-
graph of order k that also fails to possess a 1-factor. 

353 
Since the only connected graph of order four that does not have a !-factor is 
K1 , 3 , we have Corollary 1 as the special case k = 4 
of this theorem. 
In general, 
the contrapositive version of this result gives a kind of forbidden subgraph condi-
tion for the existence of a !-factor in a graph. 
It is well known that a line graph cannot contain an induced 
K1 , 3 and hence 
Corollary 2. 
A connected line graph has a !-factor iff it has even order. 
Corollary 2 has also been established by Chartrand, Stewart, and Polimeni in 
[2] and by Sumner in [5]. 
If G is a connected graph of even order that does not have a !-factor, then 
for any antifactor set S, \s\ ~ K(G), the connectivity of G. 
Corollary 3. 
If a connected graph G of even order has fewer than K(G) star centers, 
then G has a !-factor. 
We can say a little more about the minimal antifactor sets of cubic graphs. 
Theorem 5. 
Let G be a connected cubic graph that does not possess a 1-factor. 
Then 
for any minimal antifactor set S of G, 
(i) 
S is an independent set of star centers; 
(ii) 
G- S has exactly \S\ + 2 odd components and no even components; 
(iii) 
(iv) 
If \s\ # 1, then S contains at least three cutpoints of G; and 
\s\ 1 2. 
It was already observed by Tutte [6] that Petersen's theorm on the existence 
of a !-factor in a cubic block follows as a direct consequence of this theorem. 
However, we remark that Petersen's theorem is a special case of Theorem 5 (iii). 
Also from Theorem 5 and Theorem 2 it follows that any cubic graph without a 
!-factor must contain a cutpoint that is also a star center. 
Thus we have 
Corollary 4. 
If G is a cubic graph in which every cutpoint lies in a triangle, then 
G has a !-factor. 
3. 
THE LOCATION OF A MINIMAL ANTIFACTOR SET 
Our major result in this section is 
Theorem 6. 
Let G be a connected graph of even order that does not have a !-factor. 

354 
Then if S is any minimal antifactor set for G, then S is properly contained in a 
single block of G. 
Since every block of a nontrivial tree is K2, we obtain 
Corollary 5. 
Let T be a tree of even order. 
Then T has a !-factor iff for every 
point v ofT, T- {v} has at most one odd component. 
For a direct proof of Corollary 5 see Bernhart [1). 
For cubic graphs we can say a little more. 
Theorem 7. 
Let G be a connected, cubic graph with no !-factor, and letS be a 
minimal antifactor set for G. 
Then S is not contained in a single cycle of G. 
4. 
BOUNDS ON THE SIZE OF A MINIMAL ANTIFACTOR SET 
We first observe the following simple bounds. 
Theorem 8. If S is a minimal antifactor set for a connected graph G having even 
order but no 1-factor, then 
(i) 
(ii) 
K(G) ~lsi ~ (p - 2)/2 
lsi ~ fl0 (G) -
2. 
and 
The next lemma is an easy consequence of Hall's theorem on the existence of an 
SDR (set of distinct representatives). 
Lemma 1. If S is a minimal antifactor set for a connected graph G with lsi =k ~ 1 
and A1 , A2, ... , Ak 
are any k odd components of G- S, then there exists an ordering 
v1 , v2•···• vk of the elements of S such that for each i = 1,2, .•. ,k, vi is adja-
cent to some point in Ai. 
Hence we obtain 
Corollary 6. 
If S is a minimal antifactor set for a connected graph G, then 
Is I ~ fll (G). 
A more interesting bound is given by the next statement. 
Theorem 9. If S is a minimal antifactor set for a connected graph G, then 
lsi ~ maxB{q(B) - p(B) + 2} 
where 
q(B) and p(B) 
are respectively the number of 
lines and points of the block B and the maximum is taken over all the blocks of G. 
Corollary 7. 
(i) If G is a connected (p,q)-graph, then for any minimal antifactor 
setS, lsi ~ q- p + 2; and (ii) If G is a connected, planar graph having r 

355 
regions, then \S\ ~ r. 
Remark. 
All of the bounds in this section are attainable. 
In fact, the graph in 
the example at the beginning of this paper achieves all of t~e upper bounds at 
once.
