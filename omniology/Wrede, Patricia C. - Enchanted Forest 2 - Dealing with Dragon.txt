In Which Cimorene Refuses to Be Proper
and Has a Conversation with a Frog
Linderwall was a large kingdom, just east of the
Mountains of Morning, where philosophers were
highly respected and the number five was fashionable.
The climate was unremarkable. The knights kept their
armor brightly polished mainly for show—it had been
centuries since a dragon had come east. There were the
usual periodic problems with royal children and un-
invited fairy godmothers, but they were always the sort
of thing that could be cleared up by finding the proper
prince or princess to marry the unfortunate child a few
years later. All in all, Linderwall was a very prosperous
and pleasant place.
Cimorene hated it.
Cimorene was the youngest daughter of the King
of Linderwall, and her parents found her rather trying.
Their first six daughters were perfectly normal prin-
cesses, with long, golden hair and sweet dispositions,
each more beautiful than the last. Cimorene was lovely
enough, but her hair was jet black, and she wore it in
braids instead of curled and pinned like her sisters.
And she wouldn't stop growing. Her parents were
quite sure that no prince would want to marry a girl
who could look him in the eye instead of gazing up at
him becomingly through her lashes. As for the girl's
disposition—well, when people were being polite, they
said she was strong-minded. When they were angry or
annoyed with her, they said she was as stubborn as a
Pig-
The King and Queen did the best they could. They
hired the most superior tutors and governesses to teach
Cimorene all the things a princess ought to know—
dancing, embroidery, drawing, and etiquette. There
was a great deal of etiquette, from the proper way to
curtsy before a visiting prince to how loudly it was
permissible to scream when being carried off by a giant.
(Linderwall still had an occasional problem with giants.)
Cimorene found it all very dull, but she pressed
her lips together and learned it anyway. When she
couldn't stand it any longer, she would go down to the
castle armory and bully the armsmaster into giving her
a fencing lesson. As she got older, she found her reg-
ular lessons more and more boring. Consequently, the
fencing lessons became more and more frequent.
When she was twelve, her father found out.
"Fencing is not proper behavior for a princess," he
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (1 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
told her in the gentle-but-firm tone recommended by
the court philosopher.
Cimorene tilted her head to one side. "Why not?"
"It's ... well, it's simply not done."
Cimorene considered. "Aren't I a princess?"
"Yes, of course you are, my dear," said her father
with relief. He had been bracing himself for a storm of
tears, which was the way his other daughters reacted
to reprimands.
"Well, I fence," Cimorene said with the air of one
delivering an unshakable argument. "So it is too done
by a princess."
"That doesn't make it proper, dear," put in her
mother gently.
"Why not?"
"It simply doesn't," the Queen said firmly, and
that was the end of Cimorene's fencing lessons.
When she was fourteen, her father discovered that
she was making the court magician teach her magic.
"How long has this been going on?" he asked
wearily when she arrived in response to his summons.
"Since you stopped my fencing lessons," Cimorene
said. "I suppose you're going to tell me it isn't proper
behavior for a princess."
"Well, yes. I mean, it isn't proper."
"Nothing interesting seems to be proper," Cim-
orene said.
"You might find things more interesting if you
applied yourself a little more, dear," Cimorene's
mother said.
"I doubt it," Cimorene muttered, but she knew
better than to argue when her mother used that tone
of voice. And that was the end of the magic lessons.
The same thing happened over the Latin lessons
from the court philosopher, the cooking lessons from
the castle chef, the economics lessons from the court
treasurer, and the juggling lessons from the court min-
strel. Cimorene began to grow rather tired of the whole
business.
When she was sixteen, Cimorene summoned her
fairy godmother.
"Cimorene, my dear, this sort of thing really isn't
done," the fairy said, fanning away the scented blue
smoke that had accompanied her appearance.
"People keep telling me that," Cimorene said.
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (2 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"You should pay attention to them, then," her
godmother said irritably. "I'm not used to being hauled
away from my tea without warning. And you aren't
supposed to call me unless it is a matter of utmost
importance to your life and future happiness."
"It is of utmost importance to my life and future
happiness," Cimorene said.
"Oh, very well. You're a bit young to have fallen
in love already; still, you always have been a precocious
child. Tell me about him."
Cimorene sighed. "It isn't a him."
"Enchanted, is he?" the fairy said with a spark of
interest. "A frog, perhaps? That used to be quite pop-
ular, but it seems to have gone out of fashion lately.
Nowadays, all the princes are talking birds, or dogs,
or hedgehogs."
"No, no, I'm not in love with anyone!"
"Then what, exactly, is your problem?" the fairy
said in exasperation.
"This!" Cimorene gestured at the castle around
her. "Embroidery lessons, and dancing, and—and
being a princess!"
"My dear Cimorene!" the fairy said, shocked. "It's
your heritage!"
"It's boring."
"Boring?" The fairy did not appear to believe what
she was hearing.
"Boring. I want to do things, not sit around all day
and listen to the court minstrel make up songs about
how brave Daddy is and how lovely his wife and
daughters are."
"Nonsense, my dear. This is just a stage you're
going through. You'll outgrow it soon, and you'll be
very glad you didn't do anything rash."
Cimorene looked at her godmother suspiciously.
"You've been talking to my parents, haven't you?"
"Well, they do try to keep me up to date on what
my godchildren are doing."
"I thought so," said Cimorene, and bade her fairy
godmother a polite good-bye.
A few weeks later, Cimorene's parents took her to a
tourney in Sathem-by-the-Mountains, the next king-
dom over. Cimorene was quite sure that they were only
taking her because her fairy godmother had told them
that something had better be done about her, and soon.
She kept this opinion to herself. Anything was better
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (3 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
than the endless rounds of dancing and embroidery
lessons at home.
Cimorene realized her mistake almost as soon as
they reached their destination, for the King of Sathem-
by-the-Mountains had a son. He was a golden-haired,
blue-eyed, and exceedingly handsome prince, whose
duties appeared to consist entirely of dancing atten-
dance on Cimorene.
"Isn't he handsome!" Cimorene's lady-in-waiting
sighed.
"Yes," Cimorene said without enthusiasm. "Un-
fortunately, he isn't anything else."
"Whatever do you mean?" the lady-in-waiting said
in astonishment.
"He has no sense of humor, he isn't intelligent, he
can't talk about anything except tourneys, and half of
what he does say he gets wrong. I'm glad we're only
staying three weeks. I don't think I could stand to be
polite to him for much longer than that."
"But what about your engagement?" the lady-in-
waiting cried, horrified.
"What engagement?" Cimorene said sharply.
The lady-in-waiting tried to mutter something
about a mistake, but Cimorene put up her chin in her
best princess fashion and insisted on an explanation.
Finally, the lady-in-waiting broke down.
"I ... I overheard Their Majesties discussing it
yesterday." She sniffled into her handkerchief. "The
stipulations and covenants and contracts and settle-
ments have all been drawn up, and they're going to
sign them the day after tomorrow and announce it on
Th-Thursday."
"I see," said Cimorene. "Thank you for telling me.
You may go."
The lady-in-waiting left, and Cimorene went to see
her parents. They were annoyed and a little embar-
rassed to find that Cimorene had discovered their
plans, but they were still very firm about it. "We were
going to tell you tomorrow, when we signed the pa-
pers," her father said.
"We knew you'd be pleased, dear," her mother
said, nodding. "He's such a good-looking boy."
"But I don't want to marry Prince Therandil," Cim-
orene said.
"Well, it's not exactly a brilliant match," Cim-
orene's father said, frowning. "But I didn't think you'd
care how big his kingdom is."
"It's the prince I don't care for," Cimorene said.
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (4 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"That's a great pity, dear, but it can't be helped,"
Cimorene's mother said placidly. "I'm afraid it isn't
likely that you'll get another offer."
"Then I won't get married at all."
Both her parents looked slightly shocked. "My dear
Cimorene!" said her father. "That's out of the question.
You're a princess; it simply isn't done."
"I'm too young to get married!"
"Your Great-Aunt Rose was married at sixteen,"
her mother pointed out. "One really can't count all
those years she spent asleep under that dreadful fairy's
curse."
"I won't marry the prince of Sathem-by-the-Moun-
tains!" Cimorene said desperately. "It isn't proper!"
"What?" said both her parents together.
"He hasn't rescued me from a giant or an ogre or
freed me from a magic spell," Cimorene said.
Both her parents looked uncomfortable. "Well,
no," said Cimorene's father. "It's a bit late to start
arranging it, but we might be able to manage some-
thing."
"I don't think it's necessary," Cimorene's mother
said. She looked reprovingly at Cimorene. "You've
never paid attention to what was or wasn't suitable
before, dear; you can't start now. Proper or not, you
will marry Prince Therandil three weeks from Thurs-
day."
"But, Mother—"
"I'll send the wardrobe mistress to your room to
start fitting your bride clothes," Cimorene's mother said
firmly, and that was the end of the conversation.
Cimorene decided to try a more direct approach. She
went to see Prince Therandil. He was in the castle
armory, looking at swords. "Good morning. Princess,"
he said when he finally noticed Cimorene. "Don't you
think this is a lovely sword?"
Cimorene picked it up. "The balance is off."
"I believe you're right," said Therandil after a mo-
ment's study. "Pity; now I'll have to find another. Is
there something I can do for you?"
"Yes," said Cimorene. "You can not marry me."
"What?" Therandil looked confused.
"You don't really want to marry me, do you?"
Cimorene said coaxingly.
"Well, not exactly," Therandil replied. "I mean, in
a way. That is—"
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (5 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"Oh, good," Cimorene said, correctly interpreting
this muddled reply as No, not at all. "Then you'll tell
your father you don't want to marry me?"
"I couldn't do that!" Therandil said, shocked. "It
wouldn't be right."
"Why not?" Cimorene demanded crossly.
"Because—because—well, because princes just
don't do that!"
"Then how are you going to keep from marrying
me?"
"I guess I won't be able to," Therandil said after
thinking hard for a moment. "How do you like that
sword over there? The one with the silver hilt?"
Cimorene left in disgust and went out to the castle
garden. She was very discouraged. It looked as if she
were going to marry the prince of Sathem-by-the-
Mountains whether she wanted to or not.
"I'd rather be eaten by a dragon," she muttered.
"That can be arranged," said a voice from beside
her left slipper.
Cimorene looked down and saw a small green frog
looking up at her. "I beg your pardon. Did you speak?"
she asked.
"You don't see anyone else around, do you?" said
the frog.
"Oh!" said Cimorene. She had never met a talking
frog before. "Are you an enchanted prince?" she asked
a little doubtfully.
"No, but I've met a couple of them, and after a
while you pick up a few things," said the frog. "Now,
why is it that you want to be eaten by a dragon?"
"My parents want me to marry Prince Therandil,"
Cimorene explained.
"And you don't want to? Sensible of you," said
the frog. "I don't like Therandil. He used to skip rocks
across the top of my pond. They always sank into my
living room."
"I'm sorry," Cimorene said politely.
"Well," said the frog, "what are you going to do
about it?"
"Marrying Therandil? I don't know. I've tried talk-
ing to my parents, but they won't'listen, and neither
will Therandil."
"I didn't ask what you'd said about it," the frog
snapped. "I asked what you're going to do. Nine times
out of ten, talking is a way of avoiding doing things."

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"What kinds of things would you suggest?" Cim-
orene said, stung.
"You could challenge the prince to a duel," the
frog suggested.
"He'd win," Cimorene said. "It's been four years
since I've been allowed to do any fencing."
"You could turn him into a toad."
"I never got past invisibility in my magic les-
sons," Cimorene said. "Transformations are advanced
study."
The frog looked at her disapprovingly. "Can't you
do anything?"
"I can curtsy," Cimorene said disgustedly. "I know
seventeen different country dances, nine ways to agree
with an ambassador from Cathay without actually
promising him anything, and one hundred and forty-
three embroidery stitches. And I can make cherries
jubilee."
"Cherries jubilee?" asked the frog, and snapped at
a passing fly.

"The castle chef taught me, before Father made
him stop," Cimorene explained.
The frog munched briefly, then swallowed and
said, "I suppose there's no help for it. You'll have to
run away."
"Run away?" Cimorene said. "I don't like that
idea. Too many things could go wrong."
"You don't like the idea of marrying Prince The-
randil, either," the frog pointed out.
"Maybe I can think of some other way out of get-
ting married."
The frog snorted. "Such as?" Cimorene didn't an-
swer, and after a moment the frog said, "I thought so.
Do you want my advice or not?"
"Yes, please," said Cimorene. After all, she didn't
have to follow it.
"Go to the main road outside the city and follow
it away from the mountains," said the frog. "After a
while, you will come to a small pavilion made of gold,
surrounded by trees made of silver with emerald leaves.
Go straight past it without stopping, and don't answer
if anyone calls out to you from the pavilion. Keep on
until you reach a hovel. Walk straight up to the door
and knock three times, then snap your fingers and go
inside. You'll find some people there who can help you
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (7 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
out of your difficulties if you're polite about asking and
they're in the right mood. And that's all."
The frog turned abruptly and dove into the pool.
"Thank you very much," Cimorene called after it,
thinking "that the frog's advice sounded very odd in-
deed. She rose and went back into the castle.
11
She spent the rest of the day being fitted and fussed
over by her ladies-in-waiting until she was ready to
scream. By the end of the formal banquet, at which she
had to sit next to Prince Therandil and listen to endless
stories of his prowess in battle, Cimorene was more
than ready to take the frog's advice.
Late that night, when most of the castle was asleep,
Cimorene bundled up five clean handkerchiefs and her
best crown. Then she dug out the notes she had taken
during her magic lessons and carefully cast a spell of
invisibility. It seemed to work, but she was still very
watchful as she sneaked out of the castle. After all, it
had been a long time since she had practiced.
By morning, Cimorene was well outside the city
and visible again, walking down the main road that led
away from the mountains. It was hot and dusty, and
she began to wish she had brought a bottle of water
instead of the handkerchiefs.
Just before noon, she spied a small grove of trees
next to the road ahead of her. It looked like a cool,
pleasant place to rest for a few minutes, and she hurried
forward. When she reached the grove, however, she
saw that the trees were made of the finest silver, and
their shining green leaves were huge emeralds. In the
center of the grove stood a charming pavilion made of
gold and hung with gold curtains.
Cimorene slowed down and looked longingly at
the cool green shade beneath the trees. Just then a
woman's voice called out from the pavilion, "My dear,
you look so tired and thirsty! Come and sit with me
and share my luncheon."
12
The voice was so kind and coaxing that Cimorene
took two steps toward the edge of the road before she
remembered the frog's advice. Oh, no, she thought to
herself, I'm not going to be caught this easily! She turned
without saying anything and hurried on down the road.
A little farther on she came to a tiny, wretched-
looking hovel made of cracked and weathered gray
boards. The door hung slantwise on a broken hinge,
and the whole building looked as though it were going
to topple over at any moment. Cimorene stopped and
stared doubtfully at it, but she had followed the frog's
advice this far, and she thought it would be silly to
stop now. So she shook the dust from her skirts and
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (8 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
put on her crown (so as to make a good impression).
She marched up to the door, knocked three times, and
snapped her fingers just as the frog had told her. Then
she pushed the door open and went in.
2
In Which Cimorene Discovers the Value
of a Classical Education and Has Some
Unwelcome Visitors
Inside, the hovel was dark and cool and damp. Cim-
orene found it a pleasant relief after the hot, dusty road,
but she wondered why no sunlight seemed to be com-
ing through the cracks in the boards. She was still
standing just inside the door, waiting for her eyes to
adjust to the dark, when someone said crossly, "Is this
that princess we've been waiting for?"
"Why don't you ask her?" said a deep, rumbly
voice.
"I'm Princess Cimorene of Linderwall," Cimorene
answered politely. "I was told you could help me."
"Help her?" said the first voice, and Cimorene
heard a snort. "I think we should just eat her and be
done with it."
Cimorene began to feel frightened. She wondered
whether the voices belonged to ogres or trolls and
whether she could slip out of the hovel before they
made up their minds about eating her. She felt behind
her for the door and started in surprise when her fin-
gers touched damp stone instead of dry wood. Then a
third voice said, "Not so fast, Woraug. Let's hear her
story first."
So Cimorene took a deep breath and began to ex-
plain about the fencing lessons and the magic lessons,
and the Latin and the juggling, and all the other things
that weren't considered proper behavior for a princess,
and she told the voices that she had run away from
Sathem-by-the-Mountains to keep from having to
marry Prince Therandil.
"And what do you expect us to do about it?" one
of the voices asked curiously.
"I don't know," Cimorene said. "Except, of course,
that I would rather not be eaten. I can't see who you
are in this dark, you know."
"That can be fixed," said the voice. A moment
later, a small ball of light appeared in the air above
Cimorene's head. Cimorene stepped backward very
quickly and ran into the wall.
The voices belonged to dragons.
Five of them lay on or sprawled over or curled
around the various rocks and columns that filled the
huge cave where Cimorene stood. Each of the males
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (9 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
(there were three) had two short, stubby, sharp-looking
horns on either side of their heads; the female dragon
had three, one on each side and one in the center of
her forehead. The last dragon was apparently still too
young to have made up its mind which sex it wanted
to be; it didn't have any horns at all.
Cimorene felt very frightened. The smallest of the
dragons was easily three times as tall as she was, and
they gave an overwhelming impression of shining
green scales and sharp silver teeth. They were much
scarier in person than in the pictures she remembered
from her natural history books. She swallowed very
hard, wondering whether she really would rather be
eaten by a dragon than marry Therandil.
"Well?" said the three-homed dragon just in front
of her. "Just what are you asking us to do for you?"
"I—" Cimorene stopped short as an idea occurred
to her. Cautiously, she asked, "Dragons are . . . are
fond of princesses, aren't they?"
"Very," said the dragon, and smiled. The smile
showed all her teeth, which Cimorene did not find
reassuring.
"That is, I've heard of dragons who have captive
princesses to cook for them and—and so on," said Cim-
orene, who had very little idea what captive princesses
did all day.
The dragon in front of Cimorene nodded. One of
the others, a yellowish green in color, shifted restlessly
and said, "Oh, let's just go ahead and eat her. It will
save trouble."
Before any of the other dragons could answer,
there was a loud, booming noise, and a sixth dragon
16
slithered into the cave. His scales were more gray than
green, and the dragons by the door made way for him
respectfully.
"Kazul!" said the newcomer in a loud voice.
"Achoo! Sorry I'm late, but a terrible thing happened
on the way here, achoo!"
"What was it?" said the dragon to whom Cimorene
had been talking.
"Ran into a wizard. Achoo! Had to eat him; no help
for it. Achoo, achoo. And now look at me!" Every time
the gray-green dragon sneezed, he emitted a small ball
of fire that scorched the wall of the cave.
"Calm down, Roxim," said Kazul. "You're only
making it worse."
"Achoo! Calm down? When I'm having an allergy
attack? Achoo, oh, bother, achoo!" said the gray-green
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (10 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
dragon. "Somebody give me a handkerchief. Achoo!"
"Here," said Cimorene, holding out one of the
ones she had brought with her. "Use this." She was
beginning to feel much less frightened, for the gray-
green dragon reminded her of her great-uncle, who was
old and rather hard of hearing and of whom she was
rather fond.
"What's that?" said Roxim. "Achoo! Oh, hurry up
and give it here."
Kazul took the handkerchief from Cimorene, using
two claws very delicately, and passed it to Roxim. The
gray-green dragon mopped his streaming eyes and
blew his nose. "That's better, I think. Achoo! Oh, drat!"
The ball of fire that accompanied the dragon's
sneeze had reduced the handkerchief to a charred
17
scrap. Cimorene hastily dug out another one and
handed it to Kazul, feeling very glad that she had
brought several spares.
Roxim went through two more handkerchiefs be-
fore his sneezing spasms finally stopped. "Much bet-
ter," he said. "Now then, who's this that lent me the
handkerchiefs? Somebody's new princess, eh?"
"We were just discussing that when you came in,"
Kazul said, and turned back to Cimorene. "You were
saying? About cooking and so on."
"Couldn't I do that for one of you for a while?"
Cimorene said.
The dragon smiled again; and Cimorene swallowed
hard. "Possibly. Why would you want to do that?"
"Because then I wouldn't have to go home and
marry Therandil," Cimorene said. "Being a dragon's
princess is a perfectly respectable thing to do, so my
parents couldn't complain. And it would be much more
interesting than embroidery and dancing lessons."
Several of the dragons made snorting or choking
noises. Cimorene jumped, then decided that they were
laughing.
"This is ridiculous," said a large, bright green
dragon on Cimorene's left.
"Why?" asked Kazul.
"A princess volunteering? Out of the question!"
"That's easy for you to say," one of the other drag-
ons grumbled. "You already have a princess. What
about the rest of us?"
"Yes, don't be stuffy, Woraug," said another. "Be-

sides, what else can we do with her?"
18
"Eat her," suggested the yellowish green dragon
in a bored tone.
"No proper princess would come out looking for
dragons," Woraug objected.
"Well, I'm not a proper princess, then," Cimorene
snapped. "I make cherries jubilee, and I volunteer for
dragons, and I conjugate Latin verbs—or at least I
would if anyone would let me. So there!"
"Hear, hear," said the gray-green dragon.
"You see?" Woraug said. "Who would want an
improper princess?"
"I would," said Kazul.
"You can't be serious, Kazul," Woraug said irri-
tably. "Why?"
"I like cherries jubilee," Kazul replied, still watch-
ing Cimorene. "And I like the look of her. Besides, the
Latin scrolls in my library need cataloguing, and if I
can't find someone who knows a little of the language,
I'll have to do it myself."
"Give her a trial run first," a purplish green dragon
advised.
Woraug snorted. "Latin and cherries jubilee! And
for that you'd take on a black-haired, snippy little—"
"I'll thank you to be polite when you're discussing
my princess," Kazul said, and smiled fiercely.
"Nice little gal," Roxim said, nodding approvingly
and waving Cimorene's next-to-last handkerchief. "Got
sense. Be good for you, Kazul."
"If that's settled, I'm going to go find a snack,"
said the yellowish green dragon.
Woraug looked around, but the other dragons
seemed to agree with Roxim. "Oh, very well," Woraug
said grumpily. "It's your choice, after all, Kazul."
"It certainly is. Now, Princess, if you'll come this
way, I'll get you settled in."
Cimorene followed Kazul across the cave and
down a tunnel. To her relief, the ball of light came with
her. She had the uncomfortable feeling'that if she had
tried to walk behind Kazul in the dark, she would have
stepped on her tail, which would not have been a good
beginning.
Kazul led Cimorene through a long maze of tunnels
and finally stopped in another cave. "Here we are,"
the dragon said. "You can use the small room over on

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
the right. I believe my last princess left most of the
furnishings behind when she ran off with the knight."
"Thank you," Cimorene said. "When do I start my
duties? And what are they, please?"
"You start right away," said Kazul. "I'll want din-
ner at seven. In the meantime, you can begin sorting
the treasure." The dragon nodded toward a dark open-
ing on the left. "I'm sure some of it needs repairing.
There's at least one suit of armor with the leg off, and
some of the cheaper magic swords are probably getting
rusty. The rest of it really ought to be rearranged sen-
sibly. I can never find anything when I want it."
"What about the library you mentioned?" Cim-
orene asked.
"We'll see how well you do on the treasure room
first," Kazul said. "The rest of your job I'll explain as
we go along. You don't object to learning a little magic,
do you?"
20
"Not at all," said Cimorene.
"Good. It'll make things much easier. Go and wash
up, and I'll let you into the treasure room so you can
get started."
Cimorene nodded and went to the room Kazul had
told her to use. As she washed her face and hands,
she felt happier than she had in a long time. She was
not going to have to marry Therandil, and sorting a
dragon's treasure sounded far more interesting than
dancing or embroidery. She was even going to learn
some magic! And her parents wouldn't worry about
her, once they found out where she was. For the first
time in her life, Cimorene was glad she was a princess.
She dried her hands and turned to go back into the
main cave, wondering how best to persuade Kazul to
help her brush up on her Latin. She didn't want the
dragon to be disappointed in her skill.
"Draco, draconem, dracone," she muttered, and her
lips curved into a smile. She had always been rather
good at declining nouns. Still smiling, she started for-
ward to begin her new duties.
Cimorene settled in very quickly. She got along well
with Kazul and learned her way around the caves with
a minimum of mishaps. Actually, the caves were more
like an intricate web of tunnels, connecting caverns of
various shapes and sizes that belonged to individual
dragons. It reminded Cimorene of an underground city
with tunnels instead of streets. She had no idea how
far the tunnels extended, though she rather suspected
that some of them had been magicked, so that when
21

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
you walked down them you went a lot farther than
you thought you were going.
Kazul's section of the caves was fairly large. In
addition to the kitchen—which was in a large cave near
the exit, so that there wouldn't be a problem with the
smoke from the fire—she had a sleeping cavern, three
enormous treasure rooms at the far end of an intricate
maze of twisty little passages, two even more enormous
storage rooms for less valuable items, a library, a large,
bare cave for eating and visiting with other dragons,
and the set of rooms assigned to Cimorene. All the
caves smelled of dragon, a somewhat musty, smoky
dnnamony smell. Cimorene's first job was to air them
out.
Cimorene's rooms consisted of three small con-
necting caves, just off Kazul's living cavern. They were
furnished very comfortably in a mixture of styles and
periods, and looked just like the guest rooms in most
of the castles Cimorene had visited, only without win-
dows. They were much too small for a dragon to get
inside. When asked, Kazul said that the dwarves had
made them in return for a favor, and the dragon's tone
prevented Cimorene from inquiring too closely into just
what sort of favor it had been.
By the end of the first week, Cimorene was sure
enough of her position to give Kazul a list of things
that she needed in the kitchen. The previous princess—
of whom Cimorene was beginning to have a very poor
opinion—had apparently made do with a large skillet
with three dents and a wobbly handle, a wooden mix-
ing bowl with a crack in it, a badly tarnished copper
teakettle, and an assortment of mismatched plates,
22
cups, and silverware, most of them chipped or bent.
Kazul seemed pleased by the request, and the fol-
lowing day Cimorene had everything she had asked
for, except for a few of the more exotic pans and dishes.
This made the cooking considerably easier and gave
Cimorene more time to spend studying Latin and sort-
ing treasure. The treasure was just as disorganized as
Kazul had told her, and putting it in order was a major
task. It was sometimes hard to tell whether a ring was
enchanted, and Cimorene knew better than to put it
on and see. It might be the sort of useful magic ring
that turned you invisible, but it might also be the sort
of ring that turned you into a frog. Cimorene did the
best she could and kept a pile in the corner for things
she was not sure about.
There was a great deal of treasure to be sorted.
Most of it was stacked in one of the innermost caves
in a large, untidy heap of crowns, rings, jewels, swords,
and coins, but Cimorene kept finding things in other
places as well, some of them quite unlikely. There was
a small helmet under her bed (along with a great deal
of dust), a silver bracelet set with opals on the reading
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (14 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
table in the library, and two daggers and a jeweled ink
pot behind the kitchen stove. Cimorene collected them
all, along with the other things that were simply lying
around in the halls, and put them back in the store-
rooms where they belonged, thinking to herself that
dragons were clearly not very tidy creatures.
The first of the Knights arrived at the end of the second
week.
Cimorene was busy cleaning swords. Kazul had
-23
been right about their condition; not only were some
of them rusty, but nearly all of them needed sharp-
ening. She was polishing the last flakes of rust from an
enormous broadsword when she heard someone calling
from the mouth of the cave. Feeling somewhat irritated
by the interruption, she rose and, carrying the sword,
went to see who it was.
As she came nearer to the entrance, she was able
to make out the words that whoever-it-was was shout-
ing: "Dragon! Come out and fight! Fight for the Princess
Cimorene of Linderwall!"
"Oh, honestly," Cimorene muttered, and quick-
ened her step. "Here, you," she said as she came out
into the sunlight. Then she had to duck as a spear
flashed through the air over her head. "Stop that!" she
cried. "I'm Princess Cimorene."
"You are?" said a doubtful voice. "Are you sure?
I mean—"
Cimorene raised her head cautiously and squinted.
It was still fairly early in the morning, and the sun was
in back of the person standing outside the cave, so that
it was difficult to see anything but the outline of his
figure against the brightness. "Of course I'm sure,"
Cimorene said. "What did you expect, letters of ref-
erence? Come around here where I can see who you
are, please."
The figure moved sideways, and Cimorene saw
that it was a knight in shiny new armor, except for the
legs, where the armor was dusty from walking. Cim-
orene wondered briefly why he hadn't ridden, but de-
cided not to ask. The knight's visor was raised, and a
24
few wisps of sandy hair showed above his handsome
face. He was studying her with an expression of wor-
ried puzzlement.
"What can I do for you?" Cimorene said after sev-
eral moments had gone by and the knight still hadn't
said anything.
"Well, um> if you are the Princess Cimorene, I've
come to rescue you from the dragon," the knight said.
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (15 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
Cimorene set the point of the broadsword on the
ground and leaned on it as if it were a walking cane.
"I thought that might be it," she said. "But I'd rather
not be rescued, thank you just the same."
"Not be rescued?" The knighfs puzzled look deep-
ened. "But princesses always—"
"No, they don't," Cimorene said firmly, recogniz-
ing the beginning of a familiar argument. "And even
if I wanted to be rescued, you're going at it all wrong."
"What?" said the knight, thoroughly taken aback.
"Shouting, 'Come out and fight,' the way you did.
No self-respecting dragon is going to answer to a chal-
lenge like that. It sounds like a child's dare. Dragons
are very consdous of their dignity, at least all the ones
I've met so far are."
"Oh," said the knight, sounding very crestfallen.
"What should I have said?"
" 'Stand forth and do battle' is the usual chal-
lenge," Cimorene said with authority, remembering her
princess lessons. She had always been more interested
in what the knights and dragons were supposed to say
than in memorizing the places where she was supposed
to scream. "But the wording doesn't have to be exact
as long as it's suitably formal. You're new at this, aren't
you?"
"Rescuing you was going to be my first big quest,"
the knight said gloomily. "You're sure you don't want
to be rescued?"
"Quite sure," Cimorene said. "I like living with
Kazul."
"You like—" The knight stared at her for a moment.
Then his expression cleared and he said, "Of course!
The dragon's enchanted you. I should have thought of
that before."
"Kazul has not enchanted me, and I do not want
to be rescued by anybody," Cimorene said, alarmed by
the knight's sudden enthusiasm. "This place suits me
very well. I like polishing swords and cooking cher-
ries jubilee and reading Latin scrolls. If you don't
believe me, ask anyone in Linderwall. They've been
complaining about my un-princesslike behavior for
years."
"I did hear something about fencing lessons," the
knight said doubtfully, "but knights aren't supposed
to pay attention to that kind of thing. We're supposed
to be above rumors and gossip."
"The fencing lessons were just the beginning,"
Cimorene assured him. "So you see why I'm perfectly
happy being a dragon's princess."
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (16 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"Um, yes," said the knight, but he did not look
convinced. "Speaking of dragons, where's yours?"
"Kazul's not my dragon," Cimorene said sharply.
"I'm her princess. You'll never have any luck dealing
with dragons if you don't get these things straight.
26
She's gone to the Enchanted Forest on the other side
of the mountains to borrow a crepe pan from a witch
she knows."
"She's what?" said the knight.
"She's gone to borrow a crepe pan," Cimorene
repeated in a louder voice. "Perhaps you'd better have
your helmet checked when you get back. They're not
supposed to interfere with your hearing, but some-
times—"
"Oh, I heard you," the knight said. "But what does
a dragon want with a crepe pan?"
"She doesn't want it; I do. I found a recipe in the
library that I want to try, and the kitchen just isn't
equipped to handle anything but the most ordinary
cooking. Kazul will fix that eventually, but for the time
being we have to borrow things like crepe pans and
souffle dishes."
"You really do like it here," the knight said won-
deringly.
Cimorene refrained from replying that this was
what she had been trying to tell him all along and
instead said, "How did you know where I was?"
"Things get around." The knight waved a hand in
a vague manner. "In fact, I had to hurry to make sure
I was the first. Half of the Kingdom of Linderwall and
a princess's hand in marriage is a reward rich enough
to tempt a lot of people who wouldn't normally bother
with this sort of thing."
"Father's offered half the kingdom to whoever res-
cues me?" Cimorene said incredulously. "That's more
than all my sisters' dowries put together!"
"It's the usual thing in cases like this," the knight
said mildly.
"It would be," Cimorene said in tones of deep
disgust. "Well, at least you can go back and tell them
I don't want to be rescued. Maybe that will keep anyone
else from coming up here."
"I can't do that!" the knight said. "It's—"
"—just not done," Cimorene finished. "I under-
stand perfectly." She gave him a polite farewell, more
because she had been well brought up than because
she felt like being polite, and sent him on his way.
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (17 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
Then she went back into the cave and polished the
broadsword until it was mirror-bright, which relieved
her feelings a little.
There were two knights the following day, and four
more the day after that. On the fourth day there was
only one, but he was exceptionally stubborn, and it
took Cimorene nearly two hours to get rid of him. By
then she was thoroughly disgusted and even consid-
ered letting Kazul handle the knights from then on.
She could not quite bring herself to do it. The knights
would certainly attack Kazul as soon as they saw her,
since that was what they were coming for, and sooner
or later someone would get hurt. Cimorene did not like
to think that someone might be hurt trying to rescue
her, particularly since she did not want to be rescued,
so with a sigh she decided that she would continue to
handle the knights as long as Kazul would let her.
Prince Therandil showed up at the end of the third
week. He was limping a little, as if his metal boots
pinched his toes, and the feathers attached to the top
28
of his helmet sagged badly. He stopped and carefully
struck an impressive pose before issuing the usual
challenge.
Cimorene was not in a mood to be impressed.
Besides, she could see that his helmet was a different
style from his gold armor and that the armor had gaps
at the knees and elbows where it didn't fit together
quite right.
"Aren't you a little slow?" she asked irritably.
"There've been eight knights here before you."
"Eight?" the prince said, frowning. "I thought by
now there'd have been at least twelve. Perhaps I'd
better come back later."
Cimorene stared at him in surprise. "Why?"
"Well, it would look better," Therandil explained
seriously. "There's not much glory in defeating a
dragon that hasn't already beaten ten or fifteen people
at least. Sir Gorolax of Mirstwold won't even consider
going after a dragon whose score is less than forty-five.
I don't think I want to risk waiting that long, but eight
just doesn't seem like enough."
"You're going to go away and wait until Kazul has
defeated fifteen knights before you come back to rescue
me?" Cimorene said. She found Therandil's smug con-
fidence very annoying, but she didn't like to say so
straight out.
"Not if you'd rather be rescued now, of course,"
Therandil said hastily. "Though you ought to consid-
er the advantages, and I expect it won't be so very
long . . ." His voice trailed off, and he looked at her
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (18 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
hopefully.
"I'm afraid it will be a very long time," Cimorene
29
said with satisfaction. "You see, Kazul hasn't defeated
any knights at all yet."
"B-b-but I thought you said there'd been eight,"
Therandil spluttered.
"I said eight of them had come by; I didn't say
they'd fought anybody. I sent them away."
"You sent them away?" Therandil repeated, plainly
horrified. "But that's—that's—"
"—not done, I know." Cimorene smiled sweetly.
"But I've done it. And I intend to go on doing it, so
you might as well go home and warn your friends.
They'd feel so foolish, you know, if they came all this
way into the mountains to rescue me and then had to
turn around and go back home without doing any-
thing."
"They certainly would!" Therandil said indig-
nantly. "What do you mean by playing these kinds of
tricks? Don't you want to be rescued?"
"No," said Cimorene, losing her patience at last,
"I don't. And I'm tired of having my work constantly
interrupted. So please go away, and don't come back."
"You can't possibly mean that," Therandil said.
"Besides, everyone expects me to rescue you."
"That's your problem," Cimorene told him. "I'm
going to go fix dinner. Good-bye." Before he could say
anything else, she turned and ducked back into the
cave, hoping the prince wouldn't follow.
30

In Which Cimorene Meets a Witch
and Has Doubts about a Wizard
Therandil left, but he came back again the next day,
and the day after that. It got so that Cimorene could
not even step outside the cave without running into
him. She might have been flattered if it hadn't been so
obvious that Therandil was only worried about how
foolish he'd look if he went home without fighting the
dragon. On his fifth visit Cimorene was very sharp with
him, and when he had not returned by midaftemoon
of the next day, she began to hope that he had finally
left for good.
Cimorene was in the kitchen taking the pits out of
cherries when she heard someone knocking at the
mouth of the cave.
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (19 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"Go away," she shouted in complete exasperation.
"I've told you and told you, I don't want to be rescued,
and I'm not going to argue with you any more!"
"I didn't come here to argue," said a no-nonsense
female voice from outside. "I came to meet the person
who keeps borrowing my crepe pan. It's not something
there's normally much call for."
"Oh, dear," said Cimorene. She wiped her hands
hastily on a comer of her apron and hurried out to
greet her visitor. "I'm sorry," she said, coming around
the gray rock at the cave mouth. "But I've been having
a problem with knights lately, and I thought—" She
stopped short as she got a good look at her caller for
me first time.
The woman standing outside the cave was consid-
erably shorter than Cimorene. Her ginger hair was piled
in waves on top of her head. She had on a loose black
robe with long sleeves, which she wore unbelted. A
small pair of glasses with rectangular lenses sat firmly
on her nose, and she carried an extremely twiggy
broom in her left hand. Despite her unusual appear-
ance, she projected an air of great self-assurance.
"I quite understand," she said, studying Cimorene
shrewdly. "You must be Kazul's new princess."
"Yes, I'm Cimorene. And you are . . . ?"
"Morwen," said the black-robed woman, leaning
the broom against the rock. "Kazul and I have been
friends for a long time, ever since I moved to the En-
chanted Forest, so I thought I'd come have a look at
her new princess."
"You're the person Kazul's been borrowing dishes
32
from, aren't you?" Cimorene said, and blinked. "But
then you must be—"
"A witch," Morwen finished. "I don't see why you
find it surprising. It's not exactly an unusual profession
in these parts."
"It's just that I haven't met one before," Cimorene
said, not mentioning the fact that in Linderwall witches
were considered dangerous and probably evil and were
therefore avoided if at all possible. But then, people in
Linderwall didn't like dragons much, either. "Won't
you come in and have some tea?"
"I certainly will," said the witch, and she did. She
prowled around like a nervous cat while Cimorene put
the kettle on the stove and got out the tea things.
"Well," Morwen said approvingly as Cimorene
filled the teapot, "you're the first princess I've ever met
who has the sense to keep up with the kitchen."
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (20 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
Cimorene decided that she liked Morwen's down-
to-earth manner. She soon found herself telling Mor-
wen everything, from the fencing and philosophy and
Latin lessons to the seemingly endless stream of
knights. The story lasted through two cups of tea and
finished with Therandil's stubborn insistence on res-
cuing her.
"That is absurd," Morwen said decidedly when
Cimorene finished. "If this continues, you'll never get
anything done."
"I know," Cimorene said. "I keep telling them I
don't want to be rescued, but they're all so honorable
that none of them will tell anyone when they go back
because they think it would be gossiping."
33
"More likely they don't want to look foolish."
"Maybe, but even if they did tell people, I'm no;
sure anyone would believe it. I have a hard enough
time convincing the knights when they show up ir
person."
"It's just as well that your visitors have been hon-
orable," Morwen said, looking thoughtful. "Under-
wall's a prosperous kingdom. Sooner or later the chance
of getting hold of half of it is going to tempt someone
to try rescuing you whether you want to be rescued or
not."
"That hadn't occurred to me," Cimorene said with
a worried frown. "What can I do about it?"
"I'm not sure," Morwen replied. "The situation's
not at all usual, you know. I've never heard of a prin-
cess volunteering for a dragon before. Which rather sur-
prises me, now that I think of it. A dragon's princess
is practically guaranteed a good marriage, so you'd
think princesses from the smaller kingdoms would be
clamoring for the job."
"They're probably worried about being eaten,"
Cimorene said. "Do you think it would help if I sent
my parents a letter?"
"Probably not," Morwen said after a moment's
consideration. "But it can't hurt to try. I'll check my
spell books when I get home. It may give me an idea.
I suggest that you hunt through Kazul's library. She's
been collecting scrolls for centuries; you ought to be
able to find something useful. Meanwhile, we'll put up
a sign."
"A sign?" Cimorene stared at Morwen for a mo-
34
ment, then began to smile. " 'Road washed out,' " she
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (21 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
said. " 'Use alternate route.' Is that the kind of sign
you were thinking of?"
"Exactly," Morwen said with approval. "It won't
stop anyone who's really determined, but it will cer-
tainly slow them down. That should give us time to
come up with something better."
The two women set to work at once and in a short
time produced a large, official-looking sign. Morwen
offered to set it up on her way back to the Enchanted
Forest, but Cimorene thought it would be too awkward
for her to carry while riding the broom. So, once Mor-
wen had gone, Cimorene tucked the sign under her
arm and started down the path.
Cimorene had not had a chance to do any real exploring
before, though she had looked out at the mountains
every day and wondered. She was happy to have an
excuse to see more of the outside of her new home.
It was a lovely day, warm and sunny, and at first
the path was level and easy. Cimorene was just begin-
ning to wonder whether anyone would believe her
sign, once she got it put up, when the path swung left
around a boulder and narrowed to a tiny ledge that
sloped steeply upward.
Cimorene stopped. Now she knew why none of
the knights had ridden up to the cave. The ledge was
barely wide enough for a person on foot to edge along
sideways; the best rider in the world couldn't have
gotten a horse down it. Cimorene rolled her sign up
into a firm, tight cylinder and stuck it through her belt,
35
so she would have her hands free while she climbed.
Then she stepped out onto the ledge.
Sidling up the slope took a long time, for Cimorene
was careful to make sure that each part of the ledge
would hold before she trusted her weight to it. She
was also careful not to look down. Heights had never
bothered her before, but there was a big difference
between standing solidly on top of a tower in Under-
wall Castle behind a four-foot parapet and inching
along a ledge barely six inches wide with nothing be-
tween her and a long fall.
She had almost reached the top of the slope, where
the path widened again, when a portion of the ledge
disappeared just ahead of her. Cimorene pulled her
foot back and tried to figure out what had happened.
She hadn't seen or heard the rock crumble and fall
away; there was simply a two-foot gap in the ledge that
hadn't been there before. She studied it for a moment,
trying to think of a way of getting past. Nothing oc-
curred to her. She felt a twinge of annoyance at the
thought of all her wasted efforts, but cheered up at
once when she realized that this would solve the prob-
lem of the visiting knights. If she couldn't get around

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
or over the gap, an armored knight wouldn't be able
to get by, either. Cimorene smiled and turned her head
to creep back to safety.
There was another two-foot gap in the ledge on
her other side. Cimorene frowned. Something very odd
was going on, and she didn't like it.
"You look as if you are in need of assistance," said
a deep voice from above her. "May I be of help?"
Cimorene turned her head and saw a man standing
36
four feet away, on the path at the top of the ledge. He
was tall and sharp-featured, and his eyes were a hard,
bright black. Though he had a gray beard that reached
nearly to his waist, his face did not look old. He wore
loose robes made of blue and gray silk, and in one
hand he held a staff as tall as himself made of dark,
polished wood.
"Possibly," Cimorene answered. She was certain
that the man was a wizard, though she had never met
one before, and she did not want to agree to anything
until she was sure of what she was agreeing to. The
court philosopher had always claimed that wizards
were very tricky. "May I know to whom I am
speaking?"
"I am the wizard Zemenar," the man said. "And
you must be Kazul's new princess. I hope you're not
trying to run away. It's—"
"Not done," Cimorene said, feeling particularly an-
noyed because for once she was not doing anything
improper. "Yes, I'm Cimorene."
"I was going to say that it isn't wise to run away
from your dragon," the wizard corrected mildly. "I
believe it's done all the time."
"I'm sorry," Cimorene said, but she didn't try to
explain. "And I'm not running away. How did you
know who I was?"
"It seemed unlikely that I would find any other
charming young lady walking so casually through the
Pass of Silver Ice," Zemenar answered. He smiled. "As
you see, it is easy to find oneself in difficulties if one
is not properly ... prepared."
Cimorene decided that she didn't like him. He re-
37
minded her of one of her father's courtiers, a humor-
less, sneaky little man who had paid her compliments
only when he was after something and who couldn't
resist giving advice even when nobody wanted it. "The
ledge was all here when I started," she said. An idea
crossed her mind, and she looked hard at Zemenar. "I
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (23 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
don't suppose you know what happened to the two
missing bits?"
A flash of startled annoyance crossed the wizard's
face; then his expression smoothed back into pleasant
politeness. He shrugged. "The Pass of Silver Ice is a
strange place. Odd things frequently occur."
"Not like this," Cimorene muttered. She was sure,
now, that the wizard had made the ledge vanish so
that he could pretend to rescue her, but she had no
idea why he would want her to think she owed him a
favor. Actually, it surprised her that he had destroyed
the ledge. She didn't think the dragons would be too
happy when they found out. Unless he hadn't really
destroyed it.
"What did you say?" Zemenar said, frowning
uncertainly.
Cimorene ignored him. Without looking down, she
slid her right foot along the ledge. The rock felt firm
and solid. Slowly she transferred her weight and
brought her left foot up beside her right. She shifted
again, still careful not to look down, and slid her right
foot forward once again.
"What are you doing?" Zemenar demanded.
"Getting off this ledge," Cimorene replied. "I
should think that was obvious." One more step would
38
bring her to the path, but Zemenar was squarely in her
way. "Would you mind moving back a little so I'll have
somewhere to stand?"
Zemenar's eyes narrowed, but he backed up sev-
eral paces, and Cimorene stepped onto the path. She
wanted to heave a sigh of relief, but she did not. She
wasn't going to let Zemenar have the satisfaction of
knowing she had been worried. Instead, she gave him
her best royal smile and said with polite insincerity,
"Thank you for offering to help, but as you see, it
wasn't needed. Do stop by and visit some time."
"I will," Zemenar said as if he meant it. "And a
very good day to you. Princess Cimorene."
With that he vanished. There was no smoke or fire
or whirlwind. There wasn't even a shimmer in the air
as he disappeared. He was simply and suddenly gone.
Cimorene stared at the place where the wizard had
been and felt a shiver run down her spine. It took a
very powerful wizard indeed to vanish so quietly. And
she still didn't know what he wanted.
She shook herself and started down the path. She
would worry about the wizard later; right now she had
to find a place to put up her sign so she could get back
to the cave. She didn't feel much like exploring any
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (24 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
more.
She hadn't taken more than two or three steps
when a dark shadow passed over her. Looking up,
startled, she saw a flash of yellow-green scales. An
instant later a dragon landed on the path in front of
her, blocking the way completely. His tail hung over
the edge, and he had to keep his wings partly unfurled
39
in order to stay in balance. Cimorene recognized him
at once. It was the yellow-green dragon who had
wanted to eat her the day she arrived so unexpectedly
in the dragons' cave.
"I saw the whole thing," the dragon said with
nasty, triumphant glee. "Running away—and talking
to a wizard! Just wait until Kazul hears. She'll be sorry
she didn't just let us eat you and be done with it."
"I offer you greetings and good fortune on your
travels," Cimorene said, figuring that it was best to be
polite to anyone as large and toothy as a dragon, even
if he wasn't being at all polite to her. "I'm not running
away."
"Then what are you doing? Kazul doesn't have any
business that would bring you down this side of the
pass."
"I came out to put up a sign to keep the knights
away," Cimorene said.
"That's ridiculous." The dragon sniffed. "I've been
on patrol in this part of the mountains for the past
week, and I haven't seen or smelted even a hint of a
knight."
"You haven't been by Kazul's cave, then," Cimo-
rene said. "At least nine of them have shown up there
in the past week. Though for the past couple of days
it's been mostly a prince."
"Princes don't smell any different from knights,
and I'd have noticed if any of them were hanging
around," the dragon said flatly. "And what about that
wizard you were talking to?"
"Chaaarrge!" shouted a familiar voice from the
other side of the dragon.
40
"Therandil!" Cimorene shouted. "I told you to go
away!"
The yellow-green dragon twisted his long neck and
glanced back over his shoulder. He seemed to bunch
together like a cat crouching. Then he sprang straight
up into the air, and Cimorene was blinded by the cloud
of dust raised by the flapping of his enormous wings.
She had the presence of mind to flatten herself back
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (25 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
against the rocks by the side of the path, and a moment
later she heard someone blundering by. She stuck out
a foot.
"Ow!" she said as Therandil fell over with a clatter.
She'd forgotten that he'd be wearing iron boots along
with the rest of his armor.
"Cimorene? Is that you?" Therandil said.
"Of course it's me," Cimorene replied, rubbing her
ankle. "Open your eyes; the dust's settled." She looked
up as she spoke and saw the dragon soar out of sight
behind a cliff.
"I'm sorry," Therandil said, and then in an anxious
tone he added, "I hope I didn't hurt you, stumbling
into you like that."
Cimorene started to say that it was nothing and
that it had been her fault anyway, when she suddenly
got a much better idea. "I think you've sprained my
ankle," she declared.
"Oh, no," Therandil said. He sounded truly dis-
mayed, though Cimorene couldn't see his face because
he was wearing his helmet with the visor down.
"I probably won't be able to walk for at least a
month," she declared. "And there's certainly no way
I can climb down this mountain."
41
"But if you can't walk—" Therandil said, and
paused. Then he squared his shoulders and went on,
"—then I suppose I'll have to carry you." He didn't
sound as if he liked the idea.
"I don't think that would work very well," Cim-
orene said quickly. "How will you fight when all the
dragons come back if you're carrying me? No, you'll
have to leave me here and go back alone."
"You can't stay here!" Therandil protested, though
Cimorene's talk of when all the dragons come back had
plainly made him nervous.
"I have to," Cimorene said, trying to sound noble
and long-suffering. 'The dragons will make sure I get
safely back to Kazul's cave, and a month isn't too long
a wait, after all."
"I don't understand," Therandil said, and he did
look thoroughly puzzled.
"There's no point in you or anyone else coming
up here to rescue me for at least a month, not till my
ankle's better," Cimorene explained patiently.
"Oh, I see," Therandil said. He tilted his head back
and scanned the empty sky. "You're quite sure you'll
be all right? Then I'll just be going before those dragons
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (26 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
return." He turned and started down the path as quick-
ly as he could manage in full armor.
42

In Which Kazul Has a Dinner Party,
and Cimorene Makes Dessert
Cimorene watched Therandil go with feelings of great
relief. Now she had at least a month to find a perma-
nent way of discouraging the knights, for she was quite
certain that Therandil would spread the news of her
"injury." She decided to put up her sign anyway, just
in case, and after a little looking she found a scrubby
tree beside the path and hung the sign on it.
On her way back to Kazul's cave, she noticed that
the two pieces of the ledge were still invisible, and she
was very careful about crossing them. She looked down
once, out of curiosity, and was immediately sorry. She
was not comfortable with the sight of her own feet
firmly planted on nothing at all, with the sharp, spiky
43
tops of spruce trees in full view some fifty feet below
Kazul arrived only a few minutes after Cimorene
herself. Cimorene was looking for some thread to mend
her skirts (which had gotten torn and stained while she
was climbing along the ledge) when she heard the ur.
mistakable sounds of a dragon sliding into the main
cave.
"Cimorene?" Kazul's voice called.
"Coming," Cimorene called back, abandoning her
search. She picked up her lamp and hurried out to greet
Kazul.
"I'm glad to see you're still here," Kazul said mildly
as Cimorene came into the large cave. "Moranz was
quite sure you'd run off with a knight or a wizard. I
couldn't make out for certain which."
"Is Moranz the yellow-green dragon who wanted
to eat me?" Cimorene asked. "Because if he is, he's
just trying to make trouble."
"I'm well aware of that," Kazul said with a sigh
that sent a-burnt-bread smell halfway across the cave.
"But things would be easier for me if you didn't provide
him with any material to make trouble with. Exactly
what happened?"
"Well, Morwen came to visit this afternoon," Cim-
orene began. "We were talking about all the ... in-
terruptions I've been having, and she suggested putting
up a sign. ..." She explained why she had gone to
put up the sign herself and told Kazul in detail about
her meetings with the wizard, the dragon, and the
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (27 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
prince.
"So Morwen was here," Kazul said. She sat back,
44
and the scales on her tail rattled comfortably against
the floor. "That simplifies matters. Did you bring the
sign back with you?"
"No, I found a tree and hung it by the path,"
Cunorene said, wondering what this was all about, "in
case Therandil doesn't tell everyone about my ankle
after all."
"Better still," Kazul said, and smiled fiercely, show-
ing all her teeth. "Moranz is going to regret meddling."
"Meddling in what?"
"My business."
"I'd like a little more of an explanation than that,
if you don't mind giving one," Cimorene said with a
touch of exasperation.
Kazul looked startled, then thoughtful. Then she
nodded. "I keep forgetting that you're not as empty-
headed as most princesses," she said. "Sit down and
make yourself comfortable. This may take a while."
Cimorene found a rock and sat on it. Kazul settled
into a more restful position, folded her wings neatly
along her back, and began. "It has to do with status.
Dragons aren't required to have princesses, you see.
Most of us don't. There are never enough to go around,
and some of us prefer not to have to deal with the
annoyances that come with them."
"Knights," Cimorene guessed.
"Among other things," Kazul said, nodding. "So
having a princess in residence has become a minor mark
of high status among dragons."
"A minor mark?"
Kazul smiled. "I'm afraid so. It's the equivalent of,
45
oh, serving expensive imported fruit at dinner. It's a
nice way of showing everyone how rich you are, but
you could make just as big an impression by having
some of those fancy pastries with the smooth glazed
icing and spun-sugar roses."
"I see." Cimorene did see, though she found her-
self wishing that Kazul had found something else to
compare it to. The talk of dinner reminded her too
much of Moranz's repeated desire to eat her.
"Moranz is young and not very bright, I'm afraid,"
Kazul said, almost as if she had read Cimorene's mind.
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (28 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"He seems to have the mistaken impression that if a
princess behaves badly, it reflects on the dragon who
captured her. Possibly it comes from his inability to
keep any of his own princesses for more than a week.
Some of the lesser dragons were very snide about it
when he lost his third one in a row. I believe she
sneaked out while he was napping."
"I don't see how he can blame his princesses,"
Cimorene objected. "I mean, if most princesses are un-
willing, it must be fairly usual for them to try to get
away."
"Of course, but Moranz doesn't see it that way.
He's been trying to catch someone else's princess in a
similar foolishness for years, and he's quite sure he's
finally done so. He's undoubtedly spreading the story
of your escape far and wide at this very minute."
"Oh, dear," said Cimorene.
Kazul smiled again, and her teeth glittered silver
in the lamplight. "He'll look extremely foolish when it
becomes obvious that you're still here. Which is one
46
reason I've asked a few of my friends to dinner to-
night."
"You've what?" Cimorene said. All her worries
about Moranz were instantly replaced by worries about
fixing dinner on short notice for an unknown number
of dragons. "How many? What time will they be here?
Where are we going to put them all?"
"Six. Around eight-thirty. In the banquet cave.
And you won't be doing anything but dessert. I've
already arranged for the rest of the meal."
"Arranged? With whom?"
"Ballimore the giantess. She's loaned me the
Cauldron of Plenty that she uses when her twelve-
headed son-in-law drops in for dinner unannounced.
It'll handle most things, but all it can produce in the
way of dessert is burned mint custard and sour-cream-
and-onion ice cream."
"Ugh!" said Cimorene. "I see your problem."
"Exactly. Can you manage?"
"Not if you want cherries jubilee," Cimorene said,
frowning. "I haven't got a pot large enough to make
seven dragons' worth of cherries jubilee. Would choc-
olate mousse do? I can make two or three batches, and
there should be time for all of them to chill if you're
not starting until eight-thirty."
"Chocolate mousse will be fine," Kazul assured
her. "Come along and I'll show you where to bring it."
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (29 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
Cimorene picked up a lamp and followed Kazul
into the public tunnels that surrounded Kazul's private
caves. She was a little surprised, but when she saw the
size of the banquet cave, she understood. It was enor-
47
mous. Fifty or sixty dragons, perhaps even a hundred
of them, would fit into it quite comfortably. Obviously
it had to be a public room; there simply wasn't enough
space under the Mountains of Morning for every drag-
on to have a cave this size.
Kazul made sure Cimorene could find her way to
the banquet cave without help and then left her in the
kitchen to melt slabs of chocolate and whip gallons of
cream for the mousse. By the time she finished, she
was hot and tired, and all she really wanted to do was
to take a nap. But Kazul was expecting her to serve the
mousse, and Cimorene wasn't about to appear before
all those dragons in her old clothes with sweaty strag-
gles of hair sticking to her neck and a smear of chocolate
across her nose, so instead of napping, she pumped a
cauldron of water, heated it on the kitchen fire, and
took a bath.
Once she was clean she felt much better. She
checked to make sure the mousse was setting properly,
then went into her own rooms to decide what she
should wear. Unfortunately, she was afraid she didn't
have much choice. The wardrobe in her bedroom was
full of neat, serviceable dresses suitable for cooking in
or rummaging through treasure, but the only dressy
clothes she had were the ones she had arrived in. She
got them out of the back of the wardrobe and found
to her dismay that the hem of the gown was badly
stained with mud from her long walk. There was no
time to dean it; she would have to wear one of the
everyday dresses.
With a sigh Cimorene turned back to the wardrobe
48
and opened it once more to look for the nicest of the
ordinary clothes. She gasped in surprise. The hangers
were now full of the most beautiful gowns she had ever
seen. Some were silk, and some were velvet; some were
heavy brocade, and some were layers of feather-light
eauze; some were embroidered with gold or silver, and
some were sewn with jewels.
"Well, of course," Cimorene said aloud after a
stunned moment. "Why would a dragon have an or-
dinary wardrobe? Of course it's magic. What's in it de-
pends on what I'm looking for."
One of the wardrobe doors waggled slightly, and
its hinges creaked in smug agreement. Cimorene
blinked at it, then shook herself and began looking
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (30 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
through the gowns.
She chose one of red velvet, heavily embroidered
with gold, and found matching slippers in the bottom
of the obliging wardrobe. She let her black hair hang
in loose waves nearly to her feet and even dug her
crown out of the back of the drawer where she'd stuffed
it on her first night. She finished getting ready a few
minutes early. Feeling very cheerful, she went to the
kitchen to fetch the mousse.
It took Cimorene four trips to get the mousse down to
the serving area just off the banquet cave. A dragon-
sized serving was a little over a bucketful, and she could
barely manage to carry two at a time. When everything
was ready, she stood in the serving area and waited
nervously for Kazul to ring for dessert. She could hear
the muffled booming of the dragons' voices through the
49
heavy oak door, but she could not make out what any
of them were saying.
The bell rang at last, summoning Cimorene to serve
dessert. She carried the mousse into the banquet cav-
ern, two servings at a time, and set it in front of Kazul
and her guests. The dragons were crouched around a
shoulder-high slab of white stone. Ciniorene had to be
very careful about lifting the mousse up onto it. For-
tunately, she didn't have to wonder which dragon to
serve first. She could tell which dragons were most
important from their places at the table, and she made
a silent apology to her protocol teacher, who had in-
sisted that she leam about seating arrangements. (Pro-
tocol had been one of the princess lessons Cimorene
had hated most.)
As she set the last serving in front of Kazul, one
of the other dragons said in a disgruntled and vaguely
familiar voice, "I see the rumors are wrong again, Ka-
zul. Or did you have to go after her and haul her back
the way the rest of us do?"
Cimorene turned angrily, but before she could say
anything, a large gray-green dragon on the other side
of the stone slab said, "Nonsense, Woraug! Girl's got
more sense than that. You shouldn't listen to gossip.
Next thing you know, you'll be chasing after that imag-
inary wizard Gaurim's been on about." Cimorene rec-
ognized the speaker at once. He was Roxim, the
elderly dragon she had given four of her handkerchiefs
to.
"I suppose it was that idiot Moranz again, trying
to cause trouble," a purple-green dragon said with
bored distaste. "Someone should do something about
him."
"Kazul still hasn't answered my question," Wor-
aug said, and his tail lashed once like the tail of an
angry cat. "And I'd like her to do so if the rest of you
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (31 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:39 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
will stop sidetracking the conversation."
"Here, now!" Roxim said indignantly. "That's a bit
strong, Woraug! Too strong, if you ask me."
"I didn't," Woraug said. "I asked Kazul. And I'm
still waiting."
"I'm very pleased with my princess," Kazul said
mildly. "And no, I didn't have to haul her back, as you
would realize if you'd given the matter a little thought.
Or does your princess normally leave seven servings
of chocolate mousse in the kitchen when she runs
away?"
"Hear, hear!" Roxim said.
Cimorene noted with interest that Woraug's scales
had turned an even brighter shade of green than normal
and that he was starting to smell faintly of brimstone.
"One of these days you'll go too far, Kazul," he
said.
"You started it," Kazul pointed out. She turned to
the gray dragon. "What's this about Gaurim and a wiz-
ard, Roxim?"
"You haven't heard?" Roxim said, sounding sur-
prised. "Gaurim's been raving about it for weeks.
Somebody snuck into her cave and stole a book from
her library. No traces, but for some reason she's pos-
itive it was a wizard. Achoo!" Roxim sneezed, emitting
a ball of flame that just missed hitting his bowl of
mousse. "Gives me an allergy attack just thinking about
it."
"If it wasn't a wizard, who was it?" the dragon at
the far end of the table asked.
"Could have been anybody—an elf, a dwarf, even
a human," Roxim responded. "No reason to think it
was a wizard just because Gaurim didn't catch him in
the act. Not with the amount of time she spends away
from home."
"Which book did she lose?" said the thin, brown-
ish-green dragon next to Kazul.
"What does it matter?" the purple-green dragon
muttered.
"Some history or other. And that's another thing—
what would a wizard want with a history book? No,
no, Gaurim's making a lot of fuss over a common thief.
That's what I say."
"It could have been a wizard," said the dragon at
the far end. "Who knows why they want the things
they want?"
"Ridiculous!" Roxim replied with vigor. "A wizard
wouldn't dare come through this part of the mountains.

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
They know what we'd do to 'em, by George! Beg par-
don," he added to the silver-green dragon next to him,
who appeared to have been rather shocked by his
language.
"I'm afraid you're wrong there," Kazul said. "Cim-
orene met one today, less than a two-minute flight from
my cave."
"What? What?" Roxim said. "You're sure?"
"That's done it." The purple-green dragon rolled
his head in an irritated gesture, so that his scales made
a scratching noise as they rubbed together. "You'll
never get him to quit talking about it now."
"Quite sure," Cimorene assured Roxim, after
glancing at Kazul to make sure she was expected to
answer Roxim's question for herself. "He made two
bits of the ledge I was standing on rum invisible so I
would think it wasn't safe to keep going."
"Certainly sounds like a wizard to me," the dragon
at the far end commented.
"What did he look like?" asked the silver-green
dragon.
Cimorene described the wizard as well as she
could, then added, "He said his name was Zemenar."
"Zemenar? That's ridiculous!" Woraug snorted.
"Zemenar was elected head of the Society of Wizards
last year. He wouldn't waste his time playing games
with somebody's princess."
"Not unless he had a great deal to gain by it," the
thin dragon said in a thoughtful tone. She turned her
head and looked speculatively at Cimorene.
"Such as?" Woraug said. He waited a moment, but
no one answered. "No, I can't believe it was Zemenar.
The girl's made a mistake; that's all."
"Perhaps it wasn't him," Cimorene said, holding
on to her temper as hard as she could. "I've never met
Zemenar, so I wouldn't know. But that's who he said
he was."
"And wouldn't it be amusing if she were right?"
the purple-green dragon said, showing some interest
in the proceedings for the first time.
53
"I don't see that it matters," the silver-green
dragon said. "The important thing is that he was a
wizard, poking around smack in the middle of our
mountains. What are we going to do about it?"
"Tell King Tokoz," Roxim said. "His job to handle
this sort of thing, isn't it?"

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"What can Tokoz do about it?" Woraug said, and
there was a faint undercurrent of contempt in his tone.
"He could use the King's Crystal to find out what
the wizards are really doing," the thin dragon said in
a prim tone.
"He won't use the crystal for anything less than a
full-fledged war," Woraug said. "And why should he?
What could Tokoz do even if he did find out some
wizard was preying on poor defenseless dragons like
Gaurim?"
"Lodge a formal protest with the Society of Wiz-
ards," Roxim answered promptly, ignoring Woraug's
sarcasm. "Proper thing to do, no question. Then the
next time anyone sees a wizard ..." His voice trailed
off, and he snapped his teeth together suggestively.
"He'd probably just set up a committee," the
purple-green dragon said. "Can't anyone think of
something else?"
"I don't think we should do anything until we have
some idea what Zemenar was after," said the thin
dragon. "It could be important."
"We have to do something!" the silver-green drag-
on said. Her claws clashed against the stone table. "We
can't have wizards wandering in and out whenever
they please! Why, we'd lose half our magic in no time."
54
"Not to mention everyone sneezing themselves
silly every time one of those dratted staffs gets too
close," added the dragon at the far end.
The dragons began arguing among themselves
about what to do and how best to do it. It reminded
Cimorene of the way her father's ministers argued.
Everyone seemed to agree that something ought to be
done about the wizards, but they each had a different
idea about what was appropriate. Roxim insisted huffily
that the only thing to do was to inform the King, who
would then make a formal protest. The thin dragon
wanted to find out what the wizards were up to (she
didn't say how this was to be done) before anyone tried
to chase them off. The silver-green dragon wanted pa-
trols sent out immediately to eat any wizard who ven-
tured into the Mountains of Morning. The dragon at
the far end of the table wanted to attack the head-
quarters of the Society of Wizards the following morn-
ing, and the purple-green dragon thought it would be
most entertaining to wait and see what the wizards did
next. Woraug was the only one of the guests who did
not have a proposal, though he made occasional com-
ments, usually sarcastic ones, about everyone else's
suggestions.
Kazul did not say anything at all. Cimorene was
at first surprised and then puzzled by her silence, since
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (34 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
Kazul was the one who had set the whole discussion
going to begin with. As the argument grew more
heated, however, Cimorene began to be glad that there
was at least one dragon present who was not involved
in it. The dragon at the far end of the table was starting
55
to breathe little tongues of fire at the purple-green
dragon, and Roxim was threatening loudly to have an-
other allergy attack, but Cimorene was fairly sure that
Kazul would stop the discussion before things got com-
pletely out of hand.
She was right. A moment later, while the dragon
at the far end was taking a deep breath to continue
arguing and the thin dragon was winding up a long,
involved train of logical reasons why her proposal was
the best, Kazul said, "Thank you all for your advice.
I'll certainly think about it before I decide what to do."
"What do you mean by that?" the thin dragon
asked suspidously.
"It was my princess who met the wizard," Kazul
pointed out. "Therefore, it is my decision whether to
report the matter to the King, or to take some action
on my own, or to ask for cooperation from some of
you."
None of the other dragons appeared to like hearing
this, but to Cimorene's surprise none of them gave
Kazul any argument about it. The dragon at the far end
of the table made a few half-hearted grumbles, but that
was all, and the conversation turned to the intricacies
of several draconian romances that were currently in
progress. As soon as her guests appeared to have
calmed down, Kazul gave the signal for the empty
mousse dishes to be taken away, so Cimorene only
heard a few incomprehensible snatches of the new con-
versation. She did not really mind. She had plenty to
think about already.
56

In Which Cimorene Receives a Formal Call
from Her Companions in Dire Captivity
Kazul slept late the following morning, and Cimorene
was afraid that she would leave before Cimorene had
a chance to ask about the dragons' after-dinner con-
versation. To her relief, Kazul called her in as soon as
she was thoroughly awake and asked Cimorene to
bring in the brushes for cleaning her scales.
"What was that crystal your friend mentioned last
night?" Cimorene asked as she laid out the brushes,
"The one she thought King Tokoz could use somehow
to find out what the wizards are doing?"
"The King's Crystal?" Kazul said. "It's one of the
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (35 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
magical objects that belongs to the King of the
Dragons."
57
"But what does it do? And why did Woraug think
that King Tokoz wouldn't want to use it?"
"Using the crystal is difficult and tiring, and Tokoz
is getting old," Kazul replied. "Zareth was right to say
that the crystal ought to be used, but it will take more
evidence than we have right now to persuade the King
of that. As to what it does, the crystal shows things
that are happening in other times and places. It's use
ful, but it can be very difficult to interpret correctly."
"Oh, a crystal ball," Cimorene said, nodding. She
tapped Kazul's side, and the dragon bent her elbow so
that the scales were easier to reach. "The court wizard
at Linderwall had one, but I had to stop my magic
lessons before he got a chance to show me how to work
it."
"The King's Crystal is more like a plate, but the
principle is the same," Kazul said.
"A crystal plate?" Cimorene blinked. "No wonder
nobody talks about it much. It just doesn't sound
right."
Kazul shrugged. "The King's Crystal is much more
accurate than an ordinary crystal ball, and if 'crystal
plate' sounds odd to most people, it means that fewer
of them will try to steal it."
"Was that what the silver-green dragon meant
when he said that if the wizards started wandering
through the mountains you'd lose half your magic in
no time? I never heard that wizards stole magic rings
and swords and things."
"Not magic things," Kazul said. "Magic. Wizards
steal magic. That's where their power comes from."
"How can a wizard steal magic?" Cimorene said
58
skeptically. She climbed on a stool and began working
at the ribs of Kazul's wings.
"Wizards' staffs absorb magic from whatever hap-
pens to be nearby," Kazul said, stretching out her left
wing so Cimorene could get at the base. "That's why
they're always hanging around places like the Moun-
tains of Morning and the Enchanted Forest. The more
magic there is in the area, the more their staffs can soak
up."
"What would happen if someone stole a wizard's
staff? Would the wizard still be able to use it?"
"The wizard wouldn't be able to work any magic
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (36 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
until he got it back," Kazul said. "Most of them have
a great many anti-theft spells on their staffs for exactly
that reason. Of course, it happens anyway, now and
then. And as long as the wizard and the staff are sep-
arated, the staff doesn't absorb magic."
"It doesn't sound like a very good arrangement to
me," Cimorene said. "I can think of half a dozen ways
a staff could be lost or forgotten or stolen or something.
It doesn't seem sensible for a wizard to depend so much
on anything that's so easy to mislay."
Kazul shrugged. "They seem to like it."
"I can see why you don't want them in your part
of the mountains."
"Can you? Do you have any idea how unpleasant
it is to have part of your essence sucked out of you
without so much as a by-your-leave? Not to mention
the side effects."
"Side effects?" Cimorene said, puzzled. "There!
Turn around, and I'll do your other side."
"Roxim isn't the only dragon who's allergic to wiz-
59
ards," Kazul said dryly as she shifted her position. "Or
rather, to their staffs. We all are. Roxim's just a little
more sensitive than most. That's why we made the
agreement with them in the first place."
"The dragons have an agreement with the wiz-
ards?"
Kazul nodded. "To be precise, the King of the
Dragons has an agreement with the head of the Society
of Wizards: the wizards stay out of our portions of the
Mountains of Morning, and we allow them partial ac-
cess to the Caves of Fire and Night. At least, that's the
way it's supposed to work. King Tokoz is getting old
and forgetful, and lately wizards have been turning up
in all sorts of places they aren't supposed to be."
"Like that wizard Zemenar I met on the path,"
Cimorene said. "Do you think he really was the same
Zemenar that's the head of the Society of Wizards?"
"I doubt that anyone, even another wizard, would
dare impersonate him," Kazul said. "He has a nasty
reputation."
Cimorene remembered the hard black eyes and
sharp features of the wizard she had met. He had cer-
tainly looked nasty enough, even when he was pre-
tending to be nice. He was sneaky, too, or he wouldn't
have tried to trick her. And he had been very annoyed
when Cimorene got off the ledge without his help.
Cimorene frowned.
"I wonder what he wanted, really," she mused.
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (37 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"Do you suppose he'll stop by the way he said he
would?"
"I almost wish he would try," Kazul said. There
60
was an angry glint in her eye, and her claws made a
scratching sound against the stone floor of the cave as
she flexed them.
"Don't wiggle," Cimorene said. "If Zemenar is as
tricky as everyone says, he won't come while you're
here. He'll wait until you've gone somewhere and I'm
alone."
"True." Kazul frowned. Then she looked at Cim-
orene, and her eyes took on a speculative gleam. "He
probably thinks you're as silly as most princesses, so
he'll be hoping to trick you into giving him whatever
it is he's after. And if he does—"
"Then maybe I can fool him instead," Cimorene
finished. "And once we know what he's after, we can
decide what to do about it."
Kazul and Cimorene discussed this idea while Cim-
orene finished brushing the dragon's scales. There was
very little they could do to prepare since they did not
know when Zemenar might show up at the cave or
what he might do when he arrived. Then Kazul went
off to inspect the ledge where Cimorene had met the
wizard, to see whether bits of it were still invisible.
When Kazul had gone, Cimorene went into the
library to hunt through all the books and scrolls of
spells. The behavior of the dragons at dinner the pre-
vious evening had made a considerable impression on
her, and she wanted to see whether she could find a
spell to fireproof herself. Until then she hadn't realized
that when a dragon lost his temper, he started breath-
ing fire. Not that she was planning to do anything to
irritate Kazul—or any other dragon, for that matter—
6i
but the dragons at dinner had been too annoyed to be
careful, and she didn't want to get burned by accident,
no matter how sorry the dragon might be afterward.
At first Cimorene didn't have much luck. She hadn't
had time to do much organizing in the library, and
most of the books and scrolls were lying in haphazard,
dust-covered piles. Some had even fallen onto the floor,
and there were spiders everywhere. Cimorene realized
that if she wanted to find anything, she was going to
have to do some more cleaning first. With a sigh she
went to get a bucket of water, some cloths for washing
and dusting, and a handkerchief to tie over her hair.
She worked for several hours, dusting books and
manuscripts, wiping off the dirty bookshelves, and put-
ting the books back in neat rows when the shelves were
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (38 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
dry. She found two books and five old scrolls that
looked as if they might be interesting. These she set
on one of the tables to look at later. She had just pulled
a stained and yellowed stack of papers out of the back
of the second-to-last bookshelf when she heard some-
one hallooing outside.
"Now what?" she muttered crossly. She set the
papers on the table with the rest of the books she was
planning to look at later and went out to see who was
there.
To her surprise, the noise was coming from the
back entrance, not from the mouth of the cave. She
hurried into the passage, rounded the corner, and
found herself facing three beautiful, elegantly dressed
princesses. They were all blonde and blue-eyed and
62
slender, and several inches shorter than Cimorene. The
first one wore a gold crown set with diamonds, and
her hair was the color of sun-ripened wheat. The sec-
ond wore a silver crown set with sapphires, and her
hair was the color of crystallized honey. The last wore
a pearl-covered circlet, and her hair was the color of
ripe apricots. They looked rather taken aback by the
sight of Cimorene in her dust-covered dress and
kerchief.
"Oh, bother," Cimorene said under her breath.
Then she smiled her best smile and said, "Welcome to
the caves of the dragon Kazul. May I help you with
anything?"
"We have made the perilous journey through the
tunnels to see the Princess Cimorene, newly come to
these caverns, to comfort her and together bemoan our
sad and sorry fates," the first princess said haughtily.
'Tell her we are here."
"I'm Cimorene," Cimorene said. "I don't need
comforting, and I'm not particularly sad or sorry to be
here, but if you'd like to come in and have some tea,
you're welcome to."
The first two princesses looked as if they would
have liked to be startled and appalled by this an-
nouncement but were much too well bred to show what
they were feeling. The princess with the pearl circlet
looked surprised and rather intrigued, and she glanced
hopefully at her companions. They ignored her, but
after a moment the first princess said grandly, "Very
well, we will join you, then," and swept past Cimorene
into the cave.
63
The other princesses followed, the one with the
pearl circlet giving Cimorene a shy smile as she passed
Cimorene, wondering what she had gotten herself into
brought up the rear. The princesses stopped when they
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (39 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
reached the main cave, and the ones in the gold and
silver crowns looked a bit disgruntled. The one in the
pearl circlet stared in unabashed amazement. "My
goodness," she said, "you certainly do have a lot ot
space."
"Alianora!" the gold-crowned princess said sharp-
ly, and the princess with the pearl circlet flushed and
subsided, looking unhappy.
"This way," Cimorene said hastily, and led the
three princesses into the kitchen. "Do sit down," she
said, waving at the bench beside the kitchen table.
The gold-crowned princess looked at the bench
with distaste, but after a moment she sat down. The
other two followed her example. There was a brief si-
lence while Cimorene filled the copper teakettle and
hung it over the fire, and then the gold-crowned prin-
cess said, "I am remiss in my duties, for I have not yet
told you who we are. I am the Princess Keredwel of
the Kingdom of Raxwel, now captive of the dread
dragon Gomul. This"—she nodded toward the princess
in the silver crown—"is the Princess Hallanna of the
Kingdom of Poranbuth, now captive of the dread
dragon Zareth. And this"—she waved at the girl in the
pearl circlet—"is the Princess Alianora of the Duchy of
Toure-on-Marsh, now prisoner of the dread dragon
Woraug."
"Pleased to meet you," Cimorene said. "I am Prin-
64
cess Cimorene of the Kingdom of Lmderwall, now prin-
cess of the dragon Kazul. What sort of tea would you
like? I have blackberry, ginger, chamomile, and gun-
powder green. I'm afraid I used the last of the lapsang
souchong this morning."
"Blackberry, please," Keredwel said. She gave
Cimorene a considering look. "You seem to be most
philosophic about your fate."
"Would that I had so valiant a spirit," Hallanna
said in failing accents. "But my sensibility is too great,
I fear, for me to follow your example."
"If you don't like being a dragon's princess, why
don't you escape?" Cimorene asked, remembering that
Kazul had said that three princesses in a row had run
away from the yellow-green dragon, Moranz.
Keredwel and Hallanna looked shocked. "Without
being rescued?" Hallanna faltered. "Walk all that way,
with dragons and trolls and goodness knows what else
hiding in the rocks, ready to eat me? Oh, I couldn't!"
"It isn't done," Keredwel said coldly. "And I notice
that you haven't tried it."
"But I'm enjoying being Kazul's princess," Cim-
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (40 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
orene said cheerfully. "I suppose I might have been
upset if I'd been carried off the way you were, but I
can hardly complain as it is, can I?"
Alianora leaned forward. "Then you really did vol-
unteer to be Kazul's princess?"
Keredwel and Hallanna turned and stared at then-
companion. "Where did you get that ridiculous idea,
Alianora?" Hallanna said.
"W-Woraug said—" Alianora faltered.
65
"You must have misunderstood," Keredwel said
severely. "No one volunteers to be a dragon's princess.
It isn't done."
"Actually, Alianora's quite right," Cimorene said
as she set the teacups in front of her visitors. "I did
volunteer." She smiled sweetly at the thunderstruck
expressions on the faces of the first two princesses. "I
got tired of embroidery and etiquette."
Keredwel and Hallanna seemed unsure of how to
take this announcement, so they made polite conver-
sation about the tea and asked Cimorene questions
about the current fashions. Alianora didn't say very
much, and the few times she tried either Keredwel or
Hallanna jumped on her. Cimorene felt rather sorry for
Alianora.
The princesses swept off at last, still somewhat
puzzled by Cimorene's attitude. Cimorene gave a sigh
of relief and set about cleaning up the kitchen. She was
just rinsing the last of the cups when she heard some-
one hesitantly clearing her throat behind her. Cimorene
turned and saw Alianora standing timidly in the
doorway.
"Hello again," Cimorene said. "Did you forget
something?"
"Not exactly," Alianora said. "I mean, I told Ker-
edwel I did, but actually I just wanted to get away from
them for a while. I hope you don't mind."
"I don't mind at all as long as you don't expect
more hospitality," Cimorene assured her. "I have to
get back to work on the library."
"What are you doing?" Alianora asked. She
66
seemed really interested, so Cimorene explained about
the fireproofing spell.
"It sounds like,a wonderful idea," Alianora said
when Cimorene finished. "The dragons are careful
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (41 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
around us, but it would be nice not to have to depend
on them not to lose their tempers." She hesitated. "May
I help?"
"I don't think Kazul would mind," Cimorene said.
"But you'd better change clothes first. The library isn't
very clean, I'm afraid."
Alianora looked down at her silk gown, which was
embroidered heavily with silver and pearls, and gig-
gled. Cimorene took her into the bedroom and found
a plain, serviceable cleaning dress in the magic ward-
robe. It took two tries before the wardrobe figured out
that she wanted a dress for someone else, but once it
caught on, it provided a splendid selection in Alianora's
size. Then they went to the library and got to work.
Cleaning was much more enjoyable with Alianora for
company. By the time they finished dusting and
straightening the last bookcases, the two girls were fast
friends, and Alianora was comfortable enough to ask
Cimorene straight out how it was that she had come
to volunteer for a dragon.
"It's a long story," Cimorene said, but Alianora in-
sisted on hearing it. So Cimorene told her and then asked
how Alianora had happened to be carried off by Woraug.
To her surprise, Alianora flushed. "I think it was
the only thing left that they could think of," she said,
not very clearly. "My family, I mean."
6?
"I don't understand!" Cimorene said.
"It's because I'm not a very satisfactory princess,"
Alianora said. "I tried, I really did, but. ... It started
when the wicked fairy came to my christening."
"She put a curse on you?"
"No. She ate cake and ice cream until she nearly
burst and danced with my Uncle Arthur until two in
the morning and had a wonderful time. So she went
home without cursing me, and Aunt Ermintrude says
that that's where the whole problem started."
"Lots of princesses don't have christening curses,"
said Cimorene.
"Not if a wicked fairy comes to the christening,"
Alianora said positively. "And that was only the be-
ginning. When I turned sixteen. Aunt Ermintrude sent
me a gold spinning wheel for my birthday, and I sat
down and spun. I didn't prick my finger or anything."
Cimorene was beginning to see what Alianora was
getting at. "Well, if you didn't have a christening
curse ..."
"So Aunt Ermintrude told Mama to put me and a
spinning wheel in a room full of straw and have me
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (42 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
spin it into gold," Alianora went on. "And I tried! But
all I could manage was linen thread, and whoever heard
of a princess who can spin straw into linen thread?"
"It's a little unusual, certainly."
"Then they gave me a loaf of bread and told me
to walk through the forest and give some to anyone
who asked. I did exactly what they told me, and the
second beggar-woman was a fairy in disguise, but in-
stead of saying that whenever I spoke, diamonds and
68
loses would drop from my mouth, she said that since
I was so kind, I would never have any problems with
my teeth."
"Really? Did it work?"
"Well, I haven't had a toothache since I met her."
"I'd much rather have good teeth than have dia-
monds and roses drop out of my mouth whenever I
said something," Cimorene said. "Think how uncom-
fortable it would be if you accidentally talked in your
sleep! You'd wake up rolling around on thorns and
rocks."
"That never occurred to me," Alianora said, much
struck.
"Was that everything?" Cimorene asked.
"No," Alianora said. "Aunt Ermintrude persuaded
one of her fairy friends to give me a gown and a pair
of glass slippers to go to a ball in the next kingdom
over. And I broke one before I even got out of the castle!"
"That's not so surprising," Cimorene said. "Glass
slippers are for deserving merchants' daughters, not
for princesses."
"Try telling Aunt Ermintrude that," Alianora said.
"I think she was the one who found out that Woraug
was going to ravage a village just Over the border and
arranged for me to go and visit on the right day so I
could be carried off. She didn't even warn me. I sup-
pose she thought that if I knew, I'd mess it up some-
how."
"I don't think I would get along very well with
your Aunt Ermintrude," Cimorene commented thought-
fully.
69
"Oh, it wasn't so bad, at least at first," Alianora
said. "Woraug ignored me most of the time, especially
after he found out I can't cook, and it was a real relief
not to have Aunt Ermintrude around any more. Only
then Gornul brought Keredwel and Zareth brought Hal-

"And they've been making life miserable for you
ever since," Cimorene finished. "Why don't you stand
up to them?"
"I tried, but you don't know what they're like,"
Alianora said, sighing. "Keredwel goes on and on about
correct behavior, and Hallanna dissolves in tears as
soon as it looks like she's losing an argument. And
they've both had dozens of knights and princes try to
rescue them. I've only had two."
"How do you do it?" Cimorene asked. "I've had
nine already, and they're a dreadful nuisance." Al-
ianora stared at Cimorene, then began to giggle.
"What's so funny?" Cimorene demanded.
"Keredwel bragged for a week because two knights
and a prince tried to rescue her the first month she was
here," Alianora explained between giggles. "She said
it was some kind of record. You've barely been with
Kazul for four weeks, and you've had nine, and you
didn't even mention it when Keredwel was here. She's
going to be furious when she finds out."
"If she wants them, she can have them," Cimorene
said. Her expression grew thoughtful. "Maybe they'd
be easier to get rid of if I sent them along to another
princess, instead of just trying to get them to go home."
"Oh!" said Alianora, and went off into gales of
70
laughter again. Cimorene gave her a questioning look.
"It's the idea of Keredwel being—oh, my—being res-
cued by a secondhand knight," Alianora gasped. "Oh,
dear!"
Cimorene's eyes began to dance. "I could take a
good look at them first, to make sure they're worthy
of her before I sent them on," she suggested.
This was too much for either of them, and they
both collapsed in laughter. "You wouldn't, really,
would you?" Alianora said when she began to recover.
"Send the knights to rescue someone else? I cer-
tainly would," Cimorene said emphatically. "I meant
it when I said they were a nuisance. I wouldn't want
to upset Keredwel, though. I'll have to think about the
best way of handling it. It's a good thing there probably
won't be any more of them for a few weeks. I should
have plenty of time to figure something out."
"How do you know that?" Alianora asked. Cim-
orene explained about the sign and Therandil and her
"sprained ankle." Alianora was impressed and prom-
ised to help if she could. "I'll tell Hallanna that you've
twisted your ankle. I know she'll tell the next knight
who comes to rescue her, and then it won't matter if
your Prince Therandil doesn't tell anybody."
This settled, the two girls sat down and began

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
looking through the books and scrolls Cimorene had
piled on the table. Alianora, having been brought up
as a proper princess despite the tiny size of her country,
did not read Latin, so Cimorene had to examine those
scrolls herself. There was a sizable stack of books left,
however, and Alianora waded into them with a will.
It was Cimorene, however, who finally found the spell
they were searching for.
"I think this is it!" she said, looking up from an
ancient, crumpled scroll. " 'Being a Spell for the Re-
sisting of Heat and Flames of All Kinds, in Particular
Those Which Are the Product of MagicaLBeasts,' " she
read. "Yes, there's a list and it includes dragons."
"I would think dragons would be at the top," Al-
ianora said. "Is it difficult?"
"It doesn't look hard," Cimorene said, studying
the page. "Some of the ingredients are pretty rare, but
it says you only need them for the initial casting. After
that, you can reactivate the spell just by throwing a
pinch of dried feverfew in the air and reciting a
couplet."
"That's not bad," Alianora said. She came around
the table and peered over Cimorene's shoulder at the
faded ink. "Is it Latin?"
"No, it's just an ornate style of writing," Cimorene
assured her. "It's not hard to read, once you get the
hang of it. See, there's the couplet.
"Power of water, wind and earth,
Turn the fire back to its birth."
"It's a variation on a dragon spell," Cimorene added
thoughtfully.
"How do you know that?" Alianora asked.
"The court wizard at home mentioned it when he
was teaching me magic," Cimorene replied, studying
the directions.
"Then maybe it really will work on dragon fire.
72
Can we get all the ingredients for the initial casting?"
"I think so, but it'll take a while," Cimorene said.
"I don't have any wolfsbane, and I'm not at all sure
about unicorn water. Come on, let's check and see what
we need to get."
They took the scroll into the kitchen and began
hunting through the shelves and supplies. They found
more of the ingredients than Cimorene had expected,
and she began to wonder whether one of Kazul's pre-
vious princesses might have studied magic. They did
not, however, find any wolfsbane or unicorn water,
nor were they able to locate any white eagle feathers.
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (45 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
Alianora discovered a very cobwebby jar labeled
"POWDERED HENS' TEETH," but it was quite empty.
Cimorene made a list of the ingredients they still
needed, while Alianora changed back into her pearl-
embroidered dress. Alianora took a copy of the list and
went back to her quarters, much excited, to see whether
she happened to have anything useful in the dusty,
disused comers of her dragon's kitchen. Cimorene
doubted that she would find anything, but there was
no harm in letting her look.
As soon as Alianora left, Cimorene tidied up the
kitchen and put all but two of the books back on the
shelves in the library. One was the scroll of spells in
which she had found the fireproofing spell, because
she wanted to take a more careful look at some of the
other charms and enchantments it described. The other
book was a fat volume bound in worn leather, with the
words Historia Dracorum in cracked and flaking gold leaf
on the cover. Cimorene had decided it was time she
really got to work on her Latin.
73
6
In Which the Wizards Do Some Snooping,
and Cimorene Snoops Back
LOT the next three weeks, Cimorene spent most of her
free time studying the fireproofing spell and collecting
the ingredients she would need to cast it. A few, like
the wolfsbane and feverfew, she could gather herself
from the herbs that grew on the slopes of the moun-
tains. Alianora found a little jar of hippopotamus oil
among the cosmetics left by her predecessor. The uni-
corn water Cimorene got from Morwen, after promising
her a copy of the spell if it worked. She went to Kazul
about the white eagle feathers, though she was a little
afraid to explain what she wanted them for. She didn't
want Kazul to think that she was worried about Kazul
losing her temper and accidentally roasting her. For-
74
tunatety, the dragon found the whole idea very
interesting.
"It could be very useful," Kazul said reflectively.
"There are enough hot-tempered youngsters around
that it would be well worth fireproofing the princesses
who have to deal with them."
"I'm not sure I'll be able to fireproof anyone at all,"
Cimorene said. "I still need the white eagle feathers
and the powdered hens' teeth, and nobody seems to
have any."
"I'll see what I can do," Kazul said, and a few days
later she dropped a bundle of white feathers at the door
of the kitchen. Half a feather was stuck to one of her
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (46 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
right daws, and another was caught between two of
her teeth, and she looked very pleased with herself.
Cimorene decided not to ask any awkward questions.
Even Kazul, however, could not find any hens' teeth,
so Cimorene had to keep putting off trying out the spell.
When she wasn't working on collecting the ingre-
dients for the fireproofing spell, Cimorene read the
Historia Dracorum. It was very difficult at first. After all,
it had been a long time since her last Latin lesson. She
kept working at it until she started to remember the
right endings for the declensions and conjugations and
cases. Shortly after that she realized that she was not
having to look up quite as many words as she had at
the beginning.
From then on, her progress was rapid. It helped
that she found the book fascinating. Dragon history
was not a subject commonly taught to princesses in
Linderwall. But as she was now a dragon's princess,
75
she had personal reasons to be interested. Besides, the
history of the dragons was very exciting. Every page
was full of descriptions of dragons ravaging villages,
carrying off princesses, defeating knights and princes
(and occasionally being defeated by them), and fighting
with wizards, giants, and each other. When the book
wasn't describing battles, it was describing famous
dragons' hoards and peculiar draconian customs.
Cimorene was in the library with the Historic Dra-
corum in front of her and her Latin dictionary on the
table beside her left hand when she heard someone
calling from the front of the cave. She had hoped it
would be at least a little longer before the knights
started coming back, so she couldn't help sighing as
she stuck a leather bookmark in the book and closed
it. Then she went out to argue with whoever it was
until they went away.
Two wizards were standing just outside the mouth
of the cave. Cimorene saw their wooden staffs first,
before she was close enough to see their faces. As she
came nearer, she recognized the one on the left as
Zemenar. The one on the right was taller and younger;
his brown hair and beard showed no trace of gray. His
blue and brown robes were identical to the older wiz-
ard's, except for the colors. His eyes were the same
bright black as his companion's, and he looked at Cim-
orene in a way that made her feel uneasy.
"Good morning to you. Princess Cimorene," Zem-
enar said. "I thought I would take you up on your kind
invitation to visit. I hope we haven't come at an incon-
venient time?"
76
"Not at all," Cimorene said, thinking hard. She
had promised Kazul that she would try to find out what
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (47 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
Zemenar was after if he showed up, and here he was.
Maybe if she convinced him that she was as silly as her
sisters, he would be careless enough to let something
slip.
"I thought perhaps we might have since it took
you so long to come out," Zemenar said mildly, but
Cimorene thought there was a hint of suspicion in his
eyes.
"I must not have heard you right away," Cimorene
said, batting her eyes innocently, the way her next
youngest sister did whenever she had done something
particularly foolish. "Kazul has quite a large set of
caves, and I was in one of the ones at the back. I'm so
sorry."
"Ah." Zemenar stroked his beard with his left
hand. "That would make it difficult for you. Perhaps
we could set up a spell for you, one that would let you
know whenever anyone comes to visit. It would be
more pleasant for visitors, too, if they didn't have to
shout. What do you think, Antorell?"
"Like the one at the headquarters of the society,"
the second wizard said, nodding. "We could do it in
two or three minutes, right from here. It'd be easy."
Zemenar shot a dark look at his companion. Cim-
orene was sure that he'd wanted to pretend he was
inventing a difficult new spell, so that he would have
an excuse to wander around Kazul's caves. "Quite so,"
said Zemenar. "Well, Princess?"
"Oh, dear, I don't know," Cimorene said, doing
77
her best to imitate the way her eldest sister behaved
whenever anyone wanted her to decide anything. "It
sounds very nice, but Kazul is so picky about where
things go and how things are done. . . . No, I couldn't,
I simply couldn't let you do anything like that without
asking Kazul first."
"What a pity," Zemenar said. His companion
coughed and shuffled his feet. "Ah, yes. Allow me to
present my son, Antorell. I hope you don't mind my
bringing him along?"
"Of course not," Cimorene said politely.
"I am pleased to make the acquaintance of such a
lovely princess," Antorell said, bowing.
Cimorene blinked. This wasn't getting anywhere.
Maybe if she brought them inside they'd relax a little.
"Thank you," she said to Antorell. "Won't you come
in and have some tea?"
"We would be delighted," Zemenar said quickly.
"If you'll lead the way. Princess?"
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (48 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"This way," Cimorene said. She stopped just in-
side the mouth of the cave and gave the wizards her
sweetest and most innocent smile. "You can leave your
staffs right here. Just lean them up against the wall."
Antorell looked considerably startled, and Zem-
enar frowned. "Is this, too, something your dragon
requires?" he said.
"I don't know," Cimorene said, wrinkling up her
forehead the way her third-from-eldest sister did when-
ever she was puzzled (which was often). "But they'll
be so awkward in the kitchen. Don't you think so?
There's not very much room."
78
"We'll manage," Zemenar said.
Cimorene hadn't really expected to get the wizards
to let go of their staffs, but it had been worth a try.
She shrugged and smiled and led them on into the
kitchen, where she made a point of bumping into the
staffs or tripping over them every time she went by.
Finally Antorell turned his sideways and stuck it under
the table. Zemenar hung onto his with a kind of grim,
suspidous stubbornness that made Cimorene wonder
whether she was fooling him at all with her pretended
silliness.
The wizards made uncomfortable conversation
about the weather and the size of the kitchen for several
minutes while Cimorene fixed the tea and poured it.
"Are the rest of Kazul's caves this large?" Zemenar
asked as Cimorene handed him his teacup. She had
given him the one with the broken handle, even though
he was a guest, because she didn't trust him.
"Oh, yes," Cimorene said. She was beginning to
think she was never going to find out anything. The
two wizards seemed perfectly happy to sit at the
kitchen table and talk about nothing whatever for
hours.
"Remarkable," said Antorell in an admiring tone.
"You know, we wizards don't often get to see the inside
of a dragon's cave."
I'll bet you don't, thought Cimorene as she gave him
a puzzled smile. "That's too bad," she said aloud.
"Yes, it is," Zemenar said. "Perhaps you'd be will-
ing to show us around?"
Cimorene thought very rapidly. It was obvious that
79
she wasn't going to learn anything if the wizards just
sat at the kitchen table and drank tea, so she decicided
to take a chance. "Well," she said in a doubtful tone
"I suppose it would be all right as long as I don't take
you into the treasure rooms."
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (49 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"That's fine," Antorell said, a little too quickly.
"You won't touch anything, will you?" Cimorene
said as they stood up. "Kazul is so particular about
where things are kept ..."
"Of course not," Zemenar said, smiling insin-
cerely.
Cimorene smiled back and led the way out into
the hall. She watched the wizards carefully as she took
them through the large main cave, the general storage
caverns, and the big cavern where Kazul visited with
other dragons. Zemenar made polite noises about the
size and comfort of everything, but neither he nor An-
torell seemed very interested. "And this is the library,"
Cimorene said, throwing the door open.
"I am impressed," Zemenar said, and Cimorene
could tell that this time he meant it. She stepped side-
ways, so that she could keep an eye on both of the
wizards at the same time.
"A remarkable collection," Antorell commented.
He began walking around the room, admiring the book-
shelves and scanning the titles of the books.
"What's this?" Zemenar said, bending over the
table. "The Historia Dracorum? A surprising choice for
light reading. Princess." His eyes met Cimorene's, and
they were hard and bright and suspicious.
"Oh, I'm not reading it," Cimorene said hastily,
So
opening her eyes very wide. "I just thought it would
make the library look nicer to have a book or two sitting
out on the table. More—more lived-in."
Zemenar nodded, looking relieved and faintly con-
temptuous. "I think it works very well. Princess," he
said. "Very well indeed." Then he looked over at the
other side of the room and said sharply, "Antorell!
What are you doing?"
Cimorene turned her head in time to see Antorell
put out a hand and deliberately tip several books off
one of the shelves. "Stop that!" she said, forgetting to
sound silly.
"I'm very sorry. Princess," Antorell said. "Will you
help me put them back where they belong?"
Cimorene had no choice but to go over and help
him. It took several minutes to get everything back in
place because Antorell kept dropping things. Cimorene
got quite annoyed with him and finally did it all herself.
As she started to turn back to the center of the room,
she caught a glimpse of Zemenar hastily dosing the
Historia Dracorum. Cimorene pretended not to notice,
but she made a mental note that he had been looking
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (50 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
at something near the middle of the book.
"That was dreadfully careless of you," Cimorene
said, frowning at Antorell.
"Very clumsy," Zemenar agreed.
"I don't know what Kazul will say when she finds
out about it," Cimorene went on. "Really, it is too bad
of you. I did ask you not to touch anything, you know."
"Yes, you did," Zemenar said. "And I wouldn't
like to think that we had gotten you in trouble. Perhaps
81
it would be best if you didn't mention to Kazul that
we were here at all."
"I suppose I could do that," Cimorene said in a
doubtful tone.
"Of course you can," Antorell said encouragingly.
"And I'll come back in a few days, to make sure every-
thing's all right."
"I think it's time we were on our way," Zemenar
said, giving his son a dark look. "Thank you for show-
ing us around. Princess."
Cimorene escorted them out of the cave and made sure
they had left, then hurried back to the library. She spent
the next several hours poring over the middle parts of
the Historia Dracorum, trying to figure out what Zem-
enar had been looking at. She was still there when
Kazul arrived home and called for her.
"That wizard Zemenar finally came, and he
brought his son along with him," Cimorene said as sho-
came out of the library.
"I know," said Kazul. Her voice sounded a little
thick, as if she had a cold. "I could smell them th°
minute I came in."
"Is that why you sound so odd?" Cimorene asked
"You're not going to sneeze, are you?"
"I don't think so," Kazul replied. "Don't worry
about it. I'll have plenty of time to turn my head away.
"I wish I could get hold of some hens' teeth," Cim-
orene said, frowning. "That fireproofing spell—"
"Have you looked in the treasure rooms?" Kazul
asked.
82
"No," Cimorene replied, startled. She remembered
seeing a number of jars and bottles of various shapes
and sizes when she had been organizing the treasure,
and none of them had been labeled. "I didn't think of
it and besides, it's your treasure."
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (51 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"You're my princess, at least until someone rescues
you or I decide otherwise," Kazul pointed out. "Go
ahead and look, and if you find any hens' teeth, use
them. Be careful when you're checking the jars, though.
There are one or two with lead stoppers that shouldn't
be opened."
"Lead stoppers," Cimorene said. "I'll remember."
"Good. Now, what did those wizards want?"
"I'm not sure." Cimorene explained everything
that had happened, including how she had seen Zem-
enar closing the history book as she turned and how
the two wizards had been perfectly willing to leave right
after that. "But just before they disappeared, Antorell
said he might come back another time," Cimorene con-
cluded. "So I don't know whether they found what
they were looking for or not."
"Do you know which part of the Historia Dracorum
Zemenar was reading?" Kazul asked.
"Somewhere in the middle, a little past my book-
mark," Cimorene replied. "I was just looking at it when
you came in. It's the part about how the dragons came
to the Mountains of Morning and settled into the caves
and chose a king."
'That's the section where the Historia describes the
Caves of Fire and Night, isn't it?" Kazul said.
Cimorene nodded. "There was a whole page about
83
somebody finding a stone in the caves so that the drag-
ons could pick a king. It didn't make much sense to me."
"Colin's Stone," Kazul said, nodding. "We've used
it to choose our king ever since the first time. When a
king dies, all the dragons go to the Ford of Whispering
Snakes in the Enchanted Forest and take turns trying
to move Colin's Stone from there to the Vanishing
Mountain. The one that succeeds is the next king."
"What if there are two dragons strong enough to
move it?" Cimorene asked curiously.
"It's not a matter of strength," Kazul said. "Colin's
Stone isn't much larger than you are. Even a small
dragon could carry that much weight twice around the
Enchanted Forest without any trouble at all. But Colin's
Stone has an aura, a kind of vibration. When you carry
it, you can feel it humming through your claws, and
the humming gets stronger the farther you go until
your bones are shaking. Most dragons have to drop it
or be shaken to pieces, but there's always one who
is ... suited to the stone. For that dragon, the stone's
humming is just a pleasant buzz, so of course it's easy
to get it to the Vanishing Mountain."
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (52 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"You sound as if you've had experience," Cim-
orene said.
"Of course," Kazul responded matter-of-factly. "I
was old enough to participate in the tests when the last
king died." She smiled reminiscently. "I got farther
than anyone expected me to, though I wasn't one of
the top ten by any means."
Cimorene tilted her head to one side, considering.
"I think I'm glad you didn't win."
84
"Oh? Why is that?" Kazul sounded amused.
"Because you wouldn't have had any use for a
princess if you were the Queen of the Dragons, and if
you hadn't decided to take me on, that yellow-green
dragon Moranz would probably have eaten me," Cim-
orene explained.
"You mean, if I were the King of the Dragons,"
Kazul corrected her. "Queen of the Dragons is a dull
job."
"But you're a female!" Cimorene said. "If you'd
carried Colin's Stone from the Ford of Whispering
Snakes to the Vanishing Mountain, you'd have had to
be a queen, wouldn't you?"
"No, of course not," Kazul said. "Queen of the
Dragons is a totally different job from King, and it's
not one I'm particularly interested in. Most people
aren't. I think the position's been vacant since Oraun
tore his wing and had to retire."
"But King Tokoz is a male dragon!" Cimorene said,
then frowned. "Isn't he?"
"Yes, yes, but that has nothing to do with it,"
Kazul said a little testily. " 'King' is the name of the
job. It doesn't matter who holds it."
Cimorene stopped and thought for a moment.
"You mean that dragons don't care whether their king
is male or female; the title is the same no matter who
the ruler is."
"That's right. We like to keep things simple."
"Oh." Cimorene decided to return to the original
topic of conversation before the dragon's "simple"
ideas confused her any further. "Why would the wiz-
85
ards be interested in Colin's Stone if it's only used for
picking out the kings of the dragons?"
"I doubt that they are," Kazul replied. "However,
Colin's Stone was found in the Caves of Fire and Night,
and wizards have always been interested in the caves.
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (53 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
But the dragons control most of them, and all the easy
entrances are ours, so the wizards have never been able
to find out as much as they would like. The Historia
Dracorum is one of the few books that talks about the
caves at all, and there aren't many copies. I'll wager
Zemenar would have stolen it outright if he'd thought
he could get away with it."
"I thought the dragons let wizards into the Caves
of Fire and Night," Cimorene objected. "Why would
Zemenar be poking through history books looking for
information if he can just go and look at them whenever
he wants to?"
"We don't let wizards visit the caves whenever
they want," Kazul said. "If we did, they'd be running
in and out all the time, and nobody would be able to
breathe without sneezing. No, they're limited to certain
days and times, and if they want to visit the Caves of
Fire and Night otherwise, they have to use one of the
entrances we don't control. Few of them try. The other
ways of getting into the caves are very dangerous, even
for wizards."
"Maybe they're looking for an easier way in."
"Mmm." Kazul did not seem to be paying much
attention. She thought for a moment, then turned to-
ward the cave mouth. "I'm going to go see Gaurim.
Roxim said a book had been stolen from her library,
86
and I want to know which one. I'll be back in a few
hours."
"I think I'll go look at the Historia Dracorum again
while you're gone," Cimorene said thoughtfully. "If
there is something useful in it about the Caves of Fire
and Night, maybe I can find it, now that I know what
I'm looking for."
Cimorene spent the rest of the afternoon carefully trans-
lating the chapter that talked about the caves. She was
disappointed to find that there was very little about the
caves themselves, though what was there was inter-
esting. The book told how the dragons had discovered
the back way into the caves and described some of the
things they had found in them—caverns full of blue
and green fire, pools of black liquid that would cast a
cloud of darkness for twenty miles around if you
poured three drops on the ground, walls made of crys-
tal that multiplied every sound a thousandfold, rocks
that spurted fire when they were broken. Most of the
rest of the chapter was about Colin's Stone, and how
it was taken out of the caves by the first King of the
Dragons.
Kazul returned just before dinner, and she and
Cimorene compared notes. Cimorene told Kazul what
she had learned from the chapter on the Caves of Fire
and Night, and then Kazul explained what she had

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
learned from Gaurim.
"The stolen book was The Kings of the Dragons, and
the entire first section was about Colin's Stone and the
Caves of Fire and Night," Kazul said. "And only a
8?
wizard could have gotten past the spells and safeguards
Gaurim puts on her library. I think that settles it. The
wizards are definitely collecting information about the
Caves of Fire and Night."
"Then why do they keep looking at books of
dragon history?" Cimorene asked. "It seems like a
roundabout way of finding out whatever it is that they
want to know."
"There isn't any other way to do it," Kazul said.
"Nobody but dragons has ever had much to do with
the caves, and no one has written much about them
except in dragon histories. Even the wizards weren't
particularly interested in them until a few years ago,
except as a reliable route into the Enchanted Forest."
"But from what I've been reading in the Historia
Dracorum, the caves sound fascinating," Cimorene said.
"You mean to say that no one has ever written anything
about the Caves of Fire and Night except dragons?"
"That's—" Kazul stopped suddenly, and her eyes
narrowed. "No, that's not right. There was a rather
rumpled scholar who talked his way into the caves a
century or so back, and after he left he wrote an ex-
tremely dry book about what he found there. I'd for-
gotten about him."
"Do you have a copy?" Cimorene asked hopefully.
"No," Kazul said. "But I don't think the Society
of Wizards does, either. There weren't very many of
them printed, and a lot of those were lost in a flood a
few years later. Some hero or other shoved a giant into
a lake to drown him. The silly clunch didn't realize that
if he put something that big into a lake, the water would
have to go somewhere."
88
"Well, that doesn't do us much good," Cimorene
said. "It's nice that the Society of Wizards doesn't have
a copy of that book, but if we can't get hold of one
either—"
"I didn't say that," Kazul said. "I don't have a
copy myself, but I know who does."
"Who?" Cimorene said impatiently.
"Morwen. I'm afraid you're not going to be able
to work on that fireproofing spell of yours tomorrow.
We're going to take a trip to the Enchanted Forest
instead."

In Which Cimorene and Kazul
Make a Journey Underground
Cimorene was surprised to hear that Kazul intended
to take her along on the visit to Morwen, and she was
not entirely sure she liked the idea. She had heard a
great deal about the Enchanted Forest, and none of it
was reassuring. People who traveled there were always
getting changed into flowers or trees or animals or
rocks, or doing something careless and having their
heads turned backward, or being carried off by ogres
or giants or trolls, or enchanted by witches or wicked
fairies. It did not sound like a good place for a casual,
pleasant visit.
On the other hand, it seemed unlikely that any-
thing dreadful would happen to Cimorene if she were
90
traveling with a dragon, and she was looking forward
to seeing Morwen again. Besides, Cimorene was
curious.
"And anyway," she said to herself, "Kazul says
I'm going, and there's no point in worrying about it if
I don't have any choice." Nevertheless, she dedded to
take one of the smaller magic swords along with her,
if Kazul said it was all right. Cimorene saw no point
in taking unnecessary chances.
Kazul had no objection, so Cimorene picked out a
small, plain-looking sword in a worn leather scabbard
that made the wearer invincible, and they started off.
Cimorene had assumed that Kazul would fly through
the pass, but Kazul said no.
"It's not that easy to get into the Enchanted For-
est," she explained. "At least, not if you're trying to
get in. Princes and youngest sons and particularly
clever tailors stumble into it by accident all the time,
but if one wants to go there on purpose, one has to
follow the proper route."
"I didn't think dragons had that kind of problem,"
Cimorene said.
"Dragons don't," Kazul replied. "But you're not a
dragon."
So instead of flying through the Pass of Silver Ice,
Kazul led Cimorene through the tunnels. Cimorene had
to walk very quickly to keep up, even though Kazul
was moving slowly. It was not long before she was
wishing that the tunnels were high enough for her to
ride on Kazul's back. The route twisted around and up
and back and forth and down and around again until
Cimorene was thoroughly lost. Finally they came to a
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (56 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
gate made of iron bars that completely blocked the
passage. Cimorene studied it carefully, but she could
see no sign of a handle or a lock.
"This is the entrance to the Caves of Fire a" ^
Night," Kazul said. "Be careful from here on and don't
wander away or you'll get lost."
Cimorene refrained from saying that as far as she
was concerned, they were lost already. "How are they
going to open it?" she asked instead.
"Like this," said Kazul.
"By night and flame and shining rock
Open thou thy hidden lock.
Alberolingam!"
As the sound of Kazul's voice died away, the iron
gate swung silently open. "That's a very unusual open-
ing spell," Cimorene commented, impressed.
"It wasn't always that complicated," Kazul said.
She sounded almost apologetic. "I believe the first ver-
sion was very simple, just 'Open sesame,' but word
got around and we had to change it."
Cimorene nodded and followed Kazul through the
gate and into the Caves of Fire and Night. For the first
hundred yards or so, the only difference Cimorene
could see between these caves and the ordinary tunnels
on the other side of the gate was that the Caves of Fire
and Night were warmer. Then, very suddenly, her
lamp went out, plunging everything into complete and
utter blackness.
Cimorene stopped walking immediately. "Kazul?"
"It's quite all right. Princess," Kazul's disembodied
voice said from out of the darkness. "This happens all
the time here. Don't bother trying to relight the lamp.
Just put your hand on my elbow and follow along that
way."
"All right," Cimorene said doubtfully. She groped
with her free hand in the direction of Kazul's voice and
scraped her knuckles on the dragon's scales. "Ow!"
"Take your time," Kazul advised.
"I'm ready," Cimorene said. Her right hand was
pressed flat against the cool, rough-edged scales at
the back of Kazul's left forearm. "Just don't move
too fast, or I'll lose you or get stepped on or some-
thing."
Kazul did her best to oblige, but Cimorene still had
difficulty in keeping up. She had to take at least three
steps for every one of Kazul's, and it seemed that every
time she moved her foot, she hit a rock or an uneven
place in the tunnel floor. Then she would stumble, and
her hand would scrape and slide against Kazul's scales,
so that she was afraid she would lose contact with the
dragon.
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (57 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"Are you sure I shouldn't try and relight the
lamp?" Cimorene asked after her fifth painful stumble-
and-shde.
"Quite sure," Kazul said. "You see, it isn't—ah,
there it goes." While Kazul was speaking, there was a
flicker of light, and then the darkness rolled aside like
a curtain being pulled. Cimorene found herself stand-
ing in a large cave whose walls glittered as if they were
93
studded with thousands of tiny mirrors. The lamp ir
her left hand was burning cheerfully once more.
"Was it the lamp?" Cimorene asked after studying
it for a moment. "Or was it me?"
"It was the caves," Kazul said. "That was one of
the reasons they're 'of night' as well as 'of fire.' "
"Only one of the reasons?" Cimorene said thought-
fully. "I don't like the sound of that."
"You'll be quite all right as long as you're with
me," Kazul assured her. "Very few things are willing
to mess with a dragon, even in the dark. And the
periods of darkness don't last long. It's because the
magic of these caves doesn't affect us as much as other
people, or so I'm told."
"You mean that blackness is likely to come back?"
Kazul nodded.
"Then let's get as far as we can before it does,"
Cimorene said, and started across the cave.
There were four tunnels leading out of the opposite
side of the glittering cavern. Kazul took the second from
the left without hesitating an instant.
"Where do all these tunnels go?" Cimorene asked,
glancing at the other three openings as she followed
Kazul.
"The one on the right end leads to a chain of cav-
erns," Kazul said over her shoulder. "The first few are
quite ordinary, but then you come to one full of hot
sulfur pools. Some of the older dragons bathe there.
They claim the water is good for rheumatism. Beyond
that is a cave with molten silver dripping down the
walls, and the chain ends at a deep chasm with a river
of red-hot melted rock at the bottom."
94
"Doesn't sound very attractive," Cimorene com-
mented.
"The dwarfsmiths find it very useful for forging
magic swords," Kazul assured her. "The second tunnel
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (58 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
on the right takes you into a maze. The tunnels and
caverns constantly shift around, so that no matter how
carefully you mark your way, you always get lost."
"Even dragons?"
Kazul nodded. "Though I believe there was one
prince who managed to find his way out with a magic
ball of string."
"Oh, bother!" said Cimorene. The lights had gone
out again, just as they emerged into a small cave.
"It's quite all right. This part's easy," Kazul said.
"Next time I'm going to bring a cane," Cimorene
muttered. "Where do the other tunnels lead?"
"The one on the far left goes through a couple of
caverns that are pretty, but not very interesting. We're
always chasing knights and princes out of it, though.
They come for flasks of water from the bottomless pool
at the far end."
"What does it do?" Cimorene asked. "Ow!" She
had just banged her right elbow against the wall of the
cave in the dark.
"It casts a cloud of darkness for twenty miles
around when it's poured on the ground," Kazul re-
plied.
"How useful," Cimorene muttered balefully, rub-
bing her elbow.
"And this tunnel leads to the Enchanted Forest,
by way of the King's Cave," Kazul finished.
"Oh, good. I was hoping to see that," Cimorene
95
said. The King's Cave was the chamber where the first
King of the Dragons had found Colin's Stone, and the
Historia Dracorum had not described it anywhere near
well enough to suit Cimorene. "And here's the light
coming back, thank goodness. Lefs hurry before it goes
again."
They went through three small caves and two more
periods of blackness before they reached the King's
Cave. Kazul pointed out various locations of interest,
such as the wall of crystal with a chip in one comer
where the Prince of the Ruby Throne had stolen a piece
to make a magic ring and the jewel-studded cavern
where the King of the Dragons met with people who
needed impressing. There was one very eerie cave full
of slabs of black rock. Most were standing on end,
though a few had fallen over. Kazul said they were all
enchanted princes.
"All of them?" Cimorene asked, appalled. There
were at least forty of the stone slabs, and the cave was
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (59 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
quite crowded.
Kazul shook her head. "No, the one on the end
there is just an ordinary boulder."
"How did it happen?"
"The princes came to steal some of the Water of
Healing from the well at the end of the cave," Kazul
said. "There are two dippers by the well: one is tin,
the other is solid gold and covered with jewels. The
princes all tried to use the gold one, even though they'd
been told that only the tin dipper would work. It's no
more than they deserve."
Cimorene frowned, thinking of some of the princes
96
she had known. "Well, I won't deny that they probably
behaved foolishly, but—"
"Foolishly!" Kazul snorted. "Any reasonably well-
educated prince ought to have sense enough to follow
directions when he's on a quest, but all of these fellows
were sure they knew better. If they'd simply done what
they were told, they wouldn't be here."
"Still, turning them into slabs of stone forever
seems a little extreme."
"Oh, they won't be stone forever," Kazul said.
"Sooner or later someone will come along who has the
sense not to improvise, and he'll succeed in getting the
water. Then he'll use some of it to disenchant this lot,
and the cave will be empty for a while until the next
batch of young idiots starts arriving."
Cimorene felt better knowing that the princes
would someday be freed, though she had sense enough
not to try doing it herself. Since she had not been sent
on a quest for the Water of Healing, it was highly
unlikely that she would be able to disenchant the
princes even if she succeeded in taking the water. And
she knew enough about quests and enchantments and
the obtaining of things with magical properties to know
that she would probably get into a lot of trouble if she
tried. So she tucked the matter into the back of her
mind and followed Kazul through the stone-filled cav-
ern. She was careful not to step on any of the fallen
slabs.
Just outside the entrance to the next cave, Kazul
stopped. "This," she said, "is the King's Cave. We have
to cross it as quickly as we can. Don't stop in the
97
middle, and don't say anything while we're inside.
Understand? Good. Come on, then."
As soon as she stepped inside the cave, Cimorene
understood the reason for Kazul's request for silence.
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (60 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
The walls, the ceiling, and the floor were made of dark,
shiny stone that multiplied and threw back echoes of
even the smallest sound. The soft scraping of Kazul's
scales against the floor sounded like thirty men sawing
wood, and the tiny gasp Cimorene gave at the sight
and sound of the cave was as loud as if she had
shouted. Cimorene went on as quietly and carefully as
she could.
Halfway across, she noticed the vibration. It began
as a gentle and not unpleasant buzzing in her bones,
unrelated to the loud and continually multiplying
echoes of her passage, though it, too, grew stronger
the farther into the cave she went. Kazul was in front
of her now, and she saw the dragon's tail lash once,
as if in pain or anger. Suddenly she remembered Ka-
zul's description of the aura that made it impossible for
most dragons to carry Colin's Stone, and that this was
the place where Colin's Stone had been found. No
wonder Kazul was uncomfortable.
Cimorene found herself wishing she could stop
and pay attention to the humming in her bones, but
she remembered Kazul's directions and continued
walking. She had nearly reached the exit when she saw
a pebble about the size of her thumbnail, made of the
same dark, shiny stone as the cavern walls. Kazul had
said nothing about picking things up, so Cimorene
veered a little to the right and scooped the pebble up
98
as she passed. A moment later she was out of the cave.
"Phew!" said Kazul. "I'm glad that's over. From
here on, it should be easy."
"Good," said Cimorene. She dropped the pebble
into her pocket to look at more closely later and fo'
lowed Kazul down the narrow, winding tunnel.

In Which Cimorene and Kazul Pay a Call,
and Cimorene Gets into a Fight
Few minutes later they came out of the Caves of
Fire and Night into bright sunlight. Cimorene had to
shade her eyes against the sudden glare. As her eyes
adjusted, she saw a large clearing around the mouth
of the cave. The ground was covered with short grass,
so lush and dense that it made Cimorene think of green
fur. Here and there a tiny flower twinkled among the
blades of grass. At the edge of the clearing the forest
began, but Cimorene could only make out the first row
of trees. They were enormous, so large that they
dwarfed even Kazul.
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (61 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"Leave the lamp here," Kazul said. "There's no
100
sense in carting it around the forest when we won't
need it until we come back."
Cimorene set the lamp on the ground just inside
the mouth of the cave. "Now what?" she said.
"Now we go to Morwen's," Kazul said. "And we'll
get there more quickly if you ride. If you climb up on
that rock over there, you ought to be able to get on my
back without too much trouble."
"Are you sure you don't mind?" Cimorene said,
scrambling up onto the rock Kazul had indicated.
"I wouldn't have suggested it if I minded," Kazul
said. "Right there will be fine. You can hang onto the
spike in front of you and you won't foul my wings if
I have to take off suddenly."
Cimorene did not like the implication that there
were things in the Enchanted Forest that were nasty
enough to make a dragon want to take off suddenly,
but she did not say so. It was too late to back out, and
she certainly wasn't going to wait at the mouth of the
cave all alone while Kazul went off to visit Morwen.
There was no reason to think that waiting would be
any safer than going along.
As soon as Cimorene was settled, Kazul set off into
the forest at a rapid pace. At first Cimorene had to
concentrate on holding on, but after a while she began
to get the hang of it. Soon she was able to look at some
of the things they were passing. The trees were huge;
Cimorene guessed that even if there were four of her
holding hands, she would not be able to reach all the
way around one of the trunks. The ground was car-
peted with bright green moss that looked even thicker
101
than the grass in the clearing. Cimorene saw no flowers
in it, but she spotted several bushes and a vine with
three different colors of fruit.
Kazul changed course several times for no reason
that Cimorene could see, but she did not like to distract
the dragon by asking questions. They passed a mansion
guarded by a fence made of gold and a short tower
without any windows or doors. Then Kazul splashed
through a shallow stream and made a sharp turn. The
trees thinned a little, and Kazul stopped in front of a
neat gray house with a wide porch and a red roof. Over
the door was a black-and-gold sign in large block letters
reading, "NONE OF THIS NONSENSE, PLEASE "
There were several cats of various sizes and colors
perched on the porch railing or lying in the sun. As
Cimorene dismounted, Kazul said to one of them,
"Would you be good enough to tell Morwen that I'm
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (62 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
here and would like to talk to her?"
The cat, a large gray torn, blinked its yellow eyes
at Kazul. Then he jumped down from the porch rail
and sauntered into the house, his tail held high as if
to say, "I'm doing this as a particular favor, mind, and
don't you forget it."
"He doesn't seem very impressed," Cimorene
commented in some amusement.
"Why should he be?" Kazul said.
"Well, you're a dragon," Cimorene answered, a
little taken aback.
"What difference does that make to a cat?"
Fortunately, Cimorene did not have to find an an-
swer, for at that moment Morwen appeared in the door-
102
way. She was wearing the same black robe she had
worn when she visited Cimorene, or another one ex-
actly like it, and she peered through her glasses with
the air of someone studying an unexpected and rather
peculiar puzzle.
"Good morning, Kazul," she said after a moment.
"This is a surprise."
"Good," said Kazul. "If you aren't expecting us to
be here, no one else is, either."
"That's the way of things, is it?" Morwen com-
mented thoughtfully. "How much of a hurry are you
in?"
"Not much of one, as long as no one knows we're
here," Kazul replied.
"Then Cimorene had better get down and have
something to drink," Morwen said in a tone that for-
bade contradiction. "There's cider, or goat's milk,
though if you want that, you'll have the cats after you,
or I can put a kettle on for tea. Good gradous, what
have you done to your hand?"
While Morwen had been talking, Cimorene had
turned and slid carefully down Kazul's side. It was a
long slide, and when her feet hit the ground, she had
to put out a hand to keep from falling. Morwen's ex-
clamation made her blink in surprise, and she looked
down. The palm of her right hand was covered with
blood from half a dozen deep slashes and as many
scrapes.
"Oh, dear," Cimorene said. "It must have hap-
pened in the caves, when it was so dark. I didn't realize.
It doesn't hurt at all."
103
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (63 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"Hurting or not, it needs attention," Morwen said
firmly. "Come inside, and I'll see to it while Kazul tells
me why you're here. You'll have to go around back
this time," she added, turning to Kazul. "The front
steps won't take the weight. A gnome stole one of the
supports, and I haven't had time to get it fixed yet.
Pesky creatures—they're worse than mice."
"Don't the cats keep the mice away?" Cimorene
asked, mildly puzzled.
"Yes, but they don't do a thing about gnomes,
which is why gnomes are worse. Mind the step."
Kazul started walking while Morwen shooed Cim-
orene up the wooden steps and into the house. Several
of the cats eyed Cimorene curiously as she passed, and
a tortoiseshell kitten got up and followed her in.
The front door led into a large, airy room with an
iron stove in one comer. There was a good deal of
furniture, but everything except the table and the stove
had at least one cat on top of it. Morwen frowned at a
fat and fluffy Persian that was sitting on one of the
chairs. The cat stood up, yawned, gave its front paws
a cursory lick or two just to show that this was all his
own idea, and jumped down onto the floor. As Cim-
orene sat down in the vacated chair, there was a knock
at the wooden door on the opposite side of the room.
"That'll be Kazul," Morwen said. She crossed to
tile door and opened it. "Come in. I'll get you some
dder as soon as I've seen to Cimorene's hand."
Morwen's back door did not seem to get any larger,
and Kazul certainly did not get any smaller, but when
she put her head through the doorway, her scales did
104
not even scrape the sides. The rest of her followed with
no apparent difficulty, and somehow there was plenty
of room in the kitchen even after she got inside.
Kazul settled down along the far wall, where she
would be out of the way, and as soon as she stopped
moving, six cats jumped onto various portions of her
tail, back, and shoulders. Neither Kazul nor Morwen
seemed to notice. Morwen took a small tin box from a
shelf beside the stove and sat down at the table beside
Cimorene. "Now, tell me what you're here for," she
said, taking a roll of linen and two jars of ointment out
of the box. "Apart from my cinder, I mean."
"Cimorene had some interesting visitors yester-
day," Kazul said.
"If they were interesting, they can't have been
knights," Morwen commented.
"They weren't," Kazul said. "They were wizards,

copy of the Historia Dracorum. The part that describes
the Caves of Fire and Night."
"And you think that's why they've been sniffing
around the Mountains of Morning for the past six
months," Morwen said. "How did you find out what
they were looking at? Or did they ask permission?"
"I don't think Zemenar would ask permission for
anything even if he was sure he'd get it," Cimorene
said. "He'd consider it beneath him. No, I saw him
shut the book, and he was only a little further along
from where I'd left my bookmark. Ow! That stings."
"Good," Morwen said. "It's supposed to." She
closed the jar of salve she had been smearing on Cim-
105
orene's palm and began wrapping the injured hand in
the linen bandage. "Did Zemenar get what he was
after?"
"I don't think so," Cimorene said. "He said he
wanted to come back for another visit, and I don't think
he'd have done that if he'd found whatever he was
looking for."
"That seems like a reasonable assumption," Mor-
wen said. "Though wizards aren't always reasonable.
There, that should take care of things. Don't take the
bandage off for at least four days, and if you're going
to cook anything that has fennel in it, stir it left-
handed."
"Zemenar's interest in the Historia Dracorum isn't
the only thing that points to his curiosity about the
Caves of Fire and Night," Kazul said, and explained
about the book that had been stolen. "There have been
other incidents as well, and nearly all the wizards we've
caught poking around have been somewhere in or near
the caves. That's why no one thought much about it
at first. Ever since King Tokoz made that agreement
with the Society of Wizards, they've been claiming
they're supposed to have more time in the caves than
we're willing to give them. Everyone thought this was
more of the same."
"Not everyone," Morwen said, giving Kazul a
sharp look.
"I am widely considered to be unduly suspicious
of everyone and everything," Kazul said in a dry tone.
"Particularly wizards."
"And what do your suspicions make of this busi-
ness?"
106
"I think Zemenar is trying to find out something
about the Caves of Fire and Night," Kazul said. "Some-
thing he hasn't been able to learn from visiting the caves

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
in person, hence his recent interest in histories that
describe the caves, however briefly."
"And you're hoping I have something in my library
that will help you figure out what it is," Morwen
concluded.
"I don't hope," Kazul said. "I know. Unless some-
one has run off with your copy of DeMontmorency's
A Journey Through the Caves of Fire and Night."       /
"If someone has, he'll regret it," Morwen said.
"Wait here, and I'll check." She rose and went out.
Through the doorway Cimorene could see a room full
of tall, dark-stained shelves.
Cimorene blinked. "Isn't that the door you came
in through?" she asked Kazul.
Kazul nodded. "Of course."
"I thought it led out into Morwen's yard."
"It leads wherever Morwen wants it to lead," Kazul
said.
"1 see," said Cimorene, wishing her father's court
philosopher were there. He was very pompous and
stuffy, particularly about magic, which he claimed was
90 percent trickery and the rest illusion. Cimorene had
found him very trying. Dealing with Morwen's door
would probably have given him a headache.
Morwen came back into the kitchen holding a thin
red book. "Here it is. I'm sorry it took me so long to
find it, but the nonfiction isn't organized as well as it
should be yet."
Kazul surged to her feet, shedding cats in all di-
107
rections. The cats gave her reproachful looks and then
stalked out the front door with affronted dignity. Kazul
paid no attention. She curled her head around to peer
at the book over Morwen's shoulder.
"I suppose you'll want to borrow it?" Morwen said.
"I certainly do," Kazul said. "Is there a problem?'
"Only if it gets stolen," Morwen said. "There are
very few of these around, and I'm not sure I could
replace it."
"I'll keep it in the vault with the treasure," Kazui
promised. "Zemenar won't think to look for it there,
and even if he does, he won't get in. I've got enough
anti-wizard spells on the door to stop the whole Society.
They can't get in unless someone invites them."
"All right," Morwen said, handing the book to
Kazul. "Is that everything you came for?"
"No," said Kazul. She looked at Morwen with lim-
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (66 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
pid eyes and went on in a plaintive tone, "I still haven't
had any cider."
Morwen laughed and went to one of the cup-
boards. She pulled out two mugs and a large mixing
bowl and filled them with an amber-colored liquid she
poured from a heavy-looking pottery jug. She set the
mixing bowl in front of Kazul and gave one of the mugs
to Cimorene, then sat down with the second mug
herself.
They were in Morwen's kitchen for over an hour,
drinking dder and speculating about what the wizards
were up to. After a while several of the cats came back,
apd Morwen gave them a dish of goat's milk, which
soothed their ruffled feelings somewhat.
108
"How is that fireproofing spell of yours coming?"
Morwen asked as she returned to the table.
"I have everything I need except the powdered
hens' teeth, and I'm beginning to think I'm never going
to find any," Cimorene said. "Kazul has offered to let
me look through the jars in the treasury, but if there
isn't any there, I don't know where I'll look next."
"Really," Morwen said, giving Kazul a sharp look.
"Well, if you can't find any hens' teeth, you could try
substituting snake fingernails or the hair from a turtle's
egg. I wouldn't try it except as a last resort, though.
Altering spells is a very tricky business."
At last they had to leave. Kazul went out the same
way she had come in while Cimorene watched in fas-
cination. Then Cimorene and Morwen went onto the
front porch. Kazul sidled up to the house, and Cimo-
rene stood on the porch railing to climb onto her back.
The cats were seriously affronted by this maneuver and
expressed their displeasure in reproachful glances and
low yowls.
"Don't take any notice," Morwen said. "It only
encourages them."
Cimorene nodded. "Thank you for everything."
"You're quite welcome," Morwen answered.
"Don't wait too long to come again."
"You'd better take this. Princess," Kazul said,
reaching back over her shoulder to hand Morwen's
book to Cimorene. "I can't carry it and run at the same
time."
Cimorene took the book and tucked it into her
pocket. "I'm all set," she said, and they started off.
109
Cimorene enjoyed the ride back to the Mountains of
Morning. She was now sufficiently accustomed to rid-
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (67 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
ing on a dragon to be able to concentrate on looking
at the forest as it flashed past. The trees seemed almost
identical to one another, but Cimorene spotted quite s
few odd-looking bushes and vines, and twice she
thought she saw small faces staring out at her from
among leafy branches.
They reached the threshold of the caves much
sooner than Cimorene expected. Kazul waited while
she slid to the ground, then said, "The entrance is a
little narrow. I'll go first and make sure there's nothing
unpleasant waiting for us."
Cimorene nodded, and Kazul vanished into the
cave. Before Cimorene could follow, she heard a shrill
cry above her. She looked up and saw an enormous
white bird plummeting toward her, its clawed feet ex-
tended to attack. For an instant, Cimorene was frozen
by surprise and fear. Then she ducked and reached for
her sword.
She was almost too slow. The bird was on top of
her, shrieking and slashing, before she had done more
than grasp the hilt of her weapon. But the sword
seemed to leap out of the scabbard as soon as she
touched it, and she swung clumsily as she rolled aside.
She did not expect to do any damage, just to force the
bird to back away a little, but she felt the sword connect
and heard a wail of pain from the bird. Thanking all
her lucky stars individually and by name, Cimorene
twisted and scrambled to her feet, sword ready.
There was nothing for her to guard against. The
sword stroke had been more effective than she realized.
The bird was dying. As she stared at it, it raised its
head.
"You killed me?" the bird said incredulously. "But
you're a maiden."
"Actually, she's a princess," Kazul's voice said
from behind Cimorene. "My princess, so you'd have
been in even bigger trouble if you'd succeeded in car-
rying her off."
"I don't think I could have done it if I hadn't had
a magic sword," said Cimorene, who was beginning to
wish she hadn't. She had never hurt anyone before,
and she didn't like it.
"Just my luck," the bird said disgustedly. "Oh,
well, fair's fair. You killed me, so you get my forfeit."
"You're not dead yet," Cimorene said. "If you'll
let me near, I can try to stop the bleeding—"
"Not a chance," the bird said. It was beginning to
sound rather faint. "Do you want the forfeit or don't
you?"
"Take it," Kazul advised.
Cimorene said nothing, and after a moment the
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (68 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
bird said, "All right, then. Under my left wing, you'll
find three black feathers. If you drop one and wish to
be somewhere else, you'll find yourself there in the
twinkling of an eye. Any questions?"
"Can I take anyone else with me?" Cimorene
asked, thinking that if the bird was so determined to
give her the feathers, she might as well cooperate with
it.
in
The bird looked at her with respect. "Will wonders
never cease. For once a human with sense is getting
the forfeit. Yes, you can take someone with you, as
long as you're touching him. Same for objects; if you
can carry it, you can take it with you. You get one trip
per feather. That's all."
"But—" said Cimorene, and stopped. The bird's
head had fallen back, and it was dearly quite dead.
"Don't feel too bad," Kazul said perceptively. "If
it had succeeded in carrying you off, it would have fed
you to its nestlings."
"Fed me to its nestlings?" Cimorene discovered
that she had lost her sympathy for the dead bird. "What
a horrid thing to do!" She hesitated. "Won't the nest-
lings starve, now that the bird is dead?"
"No, one of the other birds will take over the chore
of feeding them for a few weeks until they're big
enough to catch their own food," Kazul said. "Now,
clean that sword and take your feathers, and lefs get
going. I want to have a look at that book of Morwen's."
Cimorene nodded and did as she was told. The
three black feathers were right where the bird had said
they would be, and she put them in her pocket with
Morwen's book and the black pebble from the Caves
of Fire and Night. She wiped the sword on the grass
several times, then finished cleaning it with her hand-
kerchief. When she finished, she left the handkerchief
beside the dead bird and followed Kazul into the Caves
of Fire and Night.

In Which Therandil Is a Dreadful Nuisance,
and Cimorene Casts a Spell
The rest of the trip home was uneventful. Passing
through the King's Cave seemed easier going in the
opposite direction, and the impenetrable darkness only
descended once. As soon as they arrived, Kazul took
the book Morwen had lent them and curled herself
around a rock just outside the mouth of the cave to
study it while Cimorene made dinner. She pored over
the book all evening, and Cimorene found it fascinating
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (69 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:40 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
to watch the dragon delicately turning pages with her
daws. Early the next day Kazul went off to consult with
Roxim.
Cimorene was rather stiff from all the dragon-
riding she had done the previous day, so she decided
not to do any more cleaning. Instead, she spent the
morning in Kazul's treasure room, sorting through
likely looking bottles and jars for those that might pos-
sibly contain powdered hens' teeth. Remembering Ka-
zul's advice, she started by setting aside all the bottles
she could find that had lead stoppers. Since the light
was not very good, she took the jars and bottles that
looked as if they might be worth investigating and piled
them in her apron, so as to carry them outside more
easily.
She had nearly finished sorting when she heard a
voice calling faintly in the distance.
"Bother!" she said. "I did hope they'd leave me
alone a little longer."
She bundled the last five bottles into her apron
without looking at them and, not forgetting to lock the
door behind her, hurried out through the maze to see
who was shouting for her this time.
It was Therandil.
"What are you doing here?" Cimorene said crossly.
"I told you I wasn't going to be ready to be rescued
for at least a month!"
"I was worried," Therandil said. "I heard that
you'd broken a leg, but you look fine to me."
"Of course I haven't broken a leg," Cimorene said.
"Where did you get that idea?"
"Some knight at the inn at the foot of the moun-
tain," Therandil replied. "He was up yesterday, talking
to the princess he's trying to rescue, and he came back
and warned everybody not to bother with the princess
that was captured by the dragon Kazul. Well, I knew
that was you, so I asked why, and he said his princess
told him you'd broken your leg and wouldn't be able
to walk for months."
Cimorene smiled slightly. Alianora had apparently
gone through with her plan to tell Hallanna about Cim-
orene's "twisted ankle," and Hallanna had decided to
improve the story a little in hopes of reducing the com-
petition. "Somebody must have gotten mixed up,"
Cimorene said gently. "You can stop worrying. I'm
fine. Is that all you came for? These jars are getting
heavy, and I've got work to do."
"Cimorene, we have to talk," Therandil said in a
heavy, deep voice.
"Then we'll have to do it while I work," Cimorene
declared. She turned on her heel and marched into the
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (70 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
kitchen, full of annoyance. She had been feeling almost
friendly toward Therandil—he had been worried about
her, after all—until he said he wanted to talk. Cimorene
was quite sure that what he wanted to talk about was
rescuing her, and she was annoyed with him for being
so stupidly stubborn and annoyed with herself for
being annoyed when he was only trying to do the best
he could.
Therandil followed her into the kitchen. "What is
all that?" he asked as Cimorene put the apron full of
jars on the kitchen table and began lining them up.
"Some things I'm checking for Kazul," Cimorene
said. She picked up a small jar made of carved jade
and pried the lid off. It was half full of green salve.
Cimorene put the lid back on and set the jar aside.
"What was it you wanted to talk about?" she asked,
reaching for another jar.
"You. Dragons. Us. That looks interesting. Can I
help?"
"As long as you don't break anything," Cimorene
said. "Some of these are very fragile." Maybe opening
jars would make him forget about You. Dragons. Us, for
a while.
"I'll be very careful," Therandil assured her. "This
one looks like metal. I'll start with that, shall I?" He
picked up one of the larger jars, made of beaten copper
with two handles. He frowned at the top, then reached
for his dagger, and as he tilted the jar, Cimorene saw
that the neck was stopped up with lead.
"Not that one!" she said quickly. She didn't re-
member picking out that particular jar. It must have
been one of the last four or five that she'd scooped up
when she heard Therandil calling.
"Why not?" Therandil said, sounding rather hurt.
"I said I'd be careful." The tip of his dagger was already
embedded in the lead.
"Kazul said to leave the ones with lead stoppers
alone," Cimorene said. "So put it back."
"If you insist," Therandil said, shrugging. He
pulled on his dagger, but it was stuck fast in the lead.
"Drat!" he said, and twisted the handle. The dagger
came free, and the lead stopper came along with it.
"I should have known," Cimorene said in a re-
signed tone.
A black cloud of smoke poured out of the jar. As
Cimorene and Therandil watched, it condensed into a
116
dark-skinned giant wearing only a turban and a loin-
cloth. He was more than twice as tall as Therandil, and
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (71 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
the comers of his mouth were turned down in a stem
frown.
"What is it?" whispered Therandil.
"Trouble," said Cimorene.
"Thou speakest truly, 0 Daughter of Wisdom,"
said the giant in a booming voice that filled the cave.
"For I am a jinn, who was imprisoned in that jar, and
I am the instrument of thy death and that of thy
paramour."
"My what?" Cimorene said, outraged.
"Thy lover," the jinn said uncomfortably. "The
man who stands beside thee."
"I know what you meant," Cimorene said. "But he
isn't my lover, or my fiance, or my boyfriend or any-
thing, and I refuse to be killed with him."
"But Cimorene, you know perfectly well—" The-
randil started.
"You hush," Cimorene said. "You've made
enough of a mess already."
"If he is not thy paramour, nor any of those other
things, then what is he?" the jinn asked suspiciously.
"A nuisance," Cimorene said succinctly.
"Cimorene, you're not being very kind," Therandil
said.
"What he is matters not," the jinn said grandly
after a moment's heavy thought. "It is enough that thou
and he shall die."
"Enough for whom?" Cimorene said.
The jinn blinked at her. "For me. 'Tis my will that
117
thou and he shall die by my hand. Thou hast but to
choose the manner of thy death."
"Old age," Cimorene said promptly.
"Mock me not! Thou and he shall die, and by my
hand, ere this day draws to its close!" the jinn cried.
"Do you suppose he means it?" Therandil said
nervously.
"Why would he keep bellowing it at us if he didn't
mean it?" Cimorene said. "Do be quiet, Therandil."
Therandil lowered his voice. "Should I offer to fight
him, do you think?"
"Don't be silly," Cimorene said. She saw that The-
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (72 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
randil was distressed, so she added, "You came up here
to fight a dragon. You aren't prepared for a jinn, and
nobody could reasonably expect you to challenge him."
"If you say so," Therandil said, looking relieved.
Cimorene turned back to the jinn and saw that he,
too, was looking perturbed. "What's the matter with
you?" she said crossly.
"Dost thou not wish to know why I will kill thee?"
the jinn asked plaintively.
"What difference does it make?" Cimorene said.
"Yes, actually," Therandil said at the same time.
"Therandil!" Cimorene said in exasperation. "Shut
up!"
"Hear my story, o luckless pair!" the jinn said with
evident relief. "I am one of those jinn who did rebel
against the law of our kind, and for my crimes I was
sentenced to imprisonment in this bottle until the day
should come when human hands would loose me. As
is the custom of my people, I swore that whoso should
release me during the first hundred years of my im-
prisonment I would make ruler of the earth; whoso
should release me during the second hundred years I
should make rich beyond all dreams of men; whoso
shall release me during the third hundred I should
grant three wishes; and whoso should release me after
any longer span of time I should grant only the choice
of what death he would die."
"You're going to kill us because ifs traditional?"
Cimorene asked.
"Yes," the jinn said. His eyes slid away from Cim-
orene's, and she frowned suddenly.
"Just how long were you in that jar?" she de-
manded.
"Uh, well, actually .. ." The jinn's voice trailed off.
"How long?" Cimorene insisted.
"Two hundred and seventeen years," the jinn ad-
mitted. "But nobody ever releases a jinn before the three
hundred years are over."
"You're trying to get around your oath!" Therandil
said, plainly shocked by the very thought. "You pre-
tended you had to kill us so you wouldn't have to give
us the wishes!"
"No!" the jinn said. "Thinkest thou that the grant-
ing of wishes alone would so trouble me? Needs must
I kill thee and thy fair companion, for I cannot return
home and say that thou didst release me and I left thee
living! I would be a laughingstock. Never in three thou-
sand years has such a thing occurred!"
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (73 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"Then you shouldn't have sworn an oath," The-
randil said sternly.
"9
"I had to!" the jinn said miserably. "It is the custom
of our kind. Twould be ... 'twould be ..."
"Improper?" Cimorene murmured.
"Twould be improper to do otherwise," the jinn
said, nodding. "But now thou hast found me out, and
what am I to do? If I kill thee, it will violate my oath;
if I kill thee not, the remainder of my life will be a
torment."
"You could go back in the jar for another eighty-
three years," Cimorene suggested delicately.
"I could ... go back?" The jinn blinked at her for
a moment. "I could go back. I could go back!"
"And in eighty-three years we'll both be dead of
old age," Cimorene said. "Since that was my choice of
death, your oath will be fulfilled and you can go straight
home without killing anyone else or giving mem any
riches or power or anything."
"Truly, thou art a jewel among women and the
very Queen of Wisdom's daughters!" the jinn said hap-
pily. "Thou hast found the perfect solution to my
difficulties!"
"Wait a minute!" Therandil said. "What about
those wishes?"
"Therandil!" Cimorene said in a shocked tone.
"I'm surprised at you! How can he give us wishes if
he's going back in the jar for eighty-three years? It
wouldn't be right at all."
Therandil frowned. "Are you sure? After all, we
did let him out during his third hundred years."
"I suppose I could let thee have one wish at least,
in token of my thanks for thy help," the jinn said. "As
long as thou dost not tell anyone."
120
"I wouldn't dream of tt," Therandil assured him.
"And my wish is to defeat a dragon and win his prin-
cess's hand in marriage!"
The jinn waved a dark hand over Therandil's head.
"There! When next thou dost fight a dragon, thou shalt
surely defeat him. And thou?" he said, turning to
Cimorene.
"I could use some powdered hens' teeth," Cimo-
rene said.
The jinn blinked in surprise, but he waved his hand
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (74 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
again, his face a mask of concentration. Then he bowed
and handed Cimorene a fat brown jar. "There's thy
desire. Farewell!" With an elaborate salaam, the jinn
dissolved back into a cloud of smoke that poured back
into the copper jar from which it had come. Cimorene
leaned over and plucked the lead stopper from the end
of Therandil's knife. She jammed it back into place and
heaved a sigh of relief.
Therandil was not paying attention. "What did you
want something like that for?" he asked, looking at the
jar of hens' teeth and wrinkling his nose in distaste.
"I don't believe I shall tell you," Cimorene said,
putting the jar carefully into one of her apron pockets.
"It has nothing to do with you."
"Nothing to do with me? I like that!" Therandil
said indignantly. "I'm going to marry you, just as soon
as I beat that dragon of yours."
"I don't think you're going to beat Kazul," Cim-
orene said in a considering tone.
"But that jinn just said—"
"He said that if you fight a dragon, you'll defeat
him. But Kazul is a her, not a him," Cimorene pointed
121
out. "And you ought not to be trying to rescue me
anyway."
"Why not?" Therandil asked truculently.
"Because there are other princesses who've been
captives of dragons for much longer than I have, and
they have seniority," Cimorene explained.
"Oh," said Therandil, looking considerably taken
aback. "How do you know?"
"They came to visit and told me all about it," Cim-
orene said. "I think you should try for Keredwel. She's
from the Kingdom of Raxwel, and her hair is the color
of sun-ripened wheat, and she wears a gold crown set
with diamonds. You ought to get along with her very
well."
Therandil brightened perceptibly at this description
but said, "But everyone expects me to rescue you."
"As long as you defeat a dragon and rescue a prin-
cess, no one will care," Cimorene said firmly. "And
Keredwel will suit you much better than I would."
"Are you sure her dragon isn't female, too?"
"Positive," Cimorene said. "Gomul's cave is two
down and three over. If you follow the path outside,
you can't miss it. He ought to be there now, and if you
leave right away, you'll be able to get everything settled

before dinner."
"All right, then," Therandil said. "As long as
you're sure you don't mind."
"Not at all," Cimorene assured him fervently. She
saw him to the mouth of the cave and pointed him
toward Gomul's cave, then returned to the kitchen.
She gathered up the jars and bottles she had been
222
planning to check, except for the copper jar with the
jinn inside, and took them back to the treasure vault.
Then she fetched an ink pot, a quill pen, and a sheet
of paper from the library and began writing out a warn-
ing to attach to the copper jar. She didn't want anyone
else to open it until the eighty-three years were over
and the jinn could go home without killing anyone.
She was just finishing when she heard Alianora's
voice calling from the rear of the cave. "I'm in the
kitchen!" she shouted. "Come on back!"
"You're always in the kitchen," Ahanora said when
she poked her head through the door a moment later.
"Or the library. Don't you ever do anything but cook
and read?"
"Look at this, Alianora," Cimorene said, handing
her the warning she had been writing. "Do you think
it's dear enough?"
" 'WARNING: This jar contains a jinn who will kill
you if you let him out too soon. Do not open until at
least one hundred and five years after the date when
the Citadel of the Yellow Giant was destroyed,' " Al-
ianora read aloud. "That's, lefs see, eighty-four years
from now. It seems clear to me. You'd have to be pretty
stupid to ignore a warning like that."
"Maybe I ought to show it to Hallanna and see
what she says," Cimorene said, frowning. "I wouldn't
want anyone getting into trouble by accident, just be-
cause I didn't make it plain."
"It's plain, it's plain," Alianora said. "Cimorene,
what on earth have you been doing? How do you know
there's a jinn in this bottle?"
"Therandil," Cimorene said, waving a hand ex-
pressively. "I was looking through some of the bottles
from Kazul's treasure room, to see if any of them hap-
pened to have hens' teeth in them, and Therandil came
in and wanted to help."
"And he opened it?" Alianora said. "Oh, dear."
"Exactly," said Cimorene. "But it came out well in
the end. I think I've gotten rid of him for good. I sent
him off to rescue Keredwel."
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (76 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"You did? What if he doesn't beat Gomul?"
"Oh, he'll win. The jinn gave him a wish, and he
wished to defeat a dragon." Cimorene looked apolo-
getically at Alianora. "I suppose I ought to have sent
him to rescue you, but ..."
"That's quite all right," Alianora said hastily. "Get-
ting rid of Keredwel will help a lot. And after every-
thing you've told me about Therandil, I don't think I'd
want to have him rescue me."
"That's what I thought," Cimorene said. "Oh, and
I got the jinn to give me some powdered hens' teeth,
so we can finally try that fireproofing spell."
"Good," Alianora said. "Let's do it right now!"
So Cimorene got out the spell and the ingredients
she had collected, and she and Alianora spent the next
hour on various necessary preparations. First they had
to boil some unicorn water and steep the dried wolfs-
bane in it. Then the mixture had to be strained and
mixed with the hippopotamus oil and the powdered
hens' teeth. Cimorene did most of that, while Alianora
ground up the blue rose leaves and the piece of ebony.
Grinding the ebony took a long time, but fortu-
nately they didn't need much. When Alianora finally
124
had enough, Cimorene mixed it with the blue rose
leaves and more of the unicorn water in one of Kazul's
iccently shed scales. Each mixture had to be stirred
three times counterclockwise with a white eagle feather.
Then Alianora dipped the point of her feather in her
mixture and began drawing a star on the floor of the
cave.
"Is this going to be big enough for both of us?"
she asked, scratching busily at the stone with the tip
of the feather.
"I think so," Cimorene answered. "Don't try to
make it too big, or you'll run out of liquid and we'll
have to start over."
Alianora did not run out, though she had used
nearly all her mixture by the time she finished. "There!"
she said. She sat back on her heels and studied her
diagram to make sure there were no gaps, then set her
dragon scale and feather aside and stood up. "Your
turn."
"First we have to get into the center of the star,"
Cimorene reminded her. "Be careful not to smudge the
lines!"
"Smudge them, after all that work?" Alianora said
in tones of mock horror. She lifted her skirts and
stepped carefully into the middle of the diagram. Cim-

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
orene followed, carrying a small mixing bowl half full
of something that looked like brown sludge with a
white eagle feather sticking out of one side. "It smells
awful," Alianora said, grimacing.
"It doesn't matter what it smells like, as long as
me spell works," Cimorene said. "Ready?"
"As ready as I'm ever going to be," Alianora re-
125
plied, shutting her eyes and screwing up her face as if
she expected to have a glass of cold water poured over
her head.
Cimorene plucked the eagle feather out of the bowl
and raised it quickly over Alianora's head before it
could drip on the floor. She let four large drops of the
brown gunk fall onto Alianora's hair, then brushed the
end of the feather across her forehead twice. She fin-
ished by drawing a circle with the feather on the palm
of Alianora's left hand.
"That tickles!" Alianora complained.
"Well, you can do it to me now," Cimorene said.
Alianora took the bowl and feather from Cimorene.
"You're right," Cimorene said a moment later. "It
does tickle."
"Now what?" Alianora said.
"Set the bowl down and shut your eyes," Cim-
orene instructed. When Alianora had done so, Cimorene
closed her own eyes and said:
"Power of water, wind and earth,
Turn the fire back to its birth.
Raise the spell to shield the flame
By the power that we have tamed."
"Oh!" said Alianora. "That feels peculiar. Can I
open my eyes now?"
"Yes," said Cimorene, opening her own. "We're
finished."
"Did it work?" Alianora asked, cautiously opening
one eye and squinting at Cimorene.
126
"Well, something happened. We both felt it," Cim-
orene said. "And your hair and forehead don't have
brown gunk on them any more."
Alianora promptly opened both eyes and studied
Cimorene. "Neither do yours. What does that mean?"
"It means we go back to the kitchen and test it,"
Cimorene said. She bent over and picked up the mixing
bowl. "We'll clean up later. Come on."

In Which Cimorene and Alianora Conduct
Some Tests and Disturb a Wizard
Back in the kitchen, Cimorene and Alianora quickly
determined that the fireproofing spell had indeed
worked. First Cimorene, then Alianora tossed a pinch
of feverfew into the air and recited the spell-verse, then
put a hand into a candle flame and held it there. Neither
was burned at all, though Alianora claimed that the
candle tickled almost as much as the eagle feather had
done.
"How long does the spell last?" Alianora asked.
"I'm not sure, exactly," Cimorene said. "At least
an hour, but I'll have to do some tests to pin it down
beyond that. I hope Kazul gets back soon. I want to
see if it works with dragon fire."
128
"You're going to have Kazul breathe fire at you,
just to see if the spell works?" Alianora said, horrified.
"What if it doesn't?"
"Then I'll talk to Kazul, and we'll go see Morwen,
and the three of us will try to figure out what to change
to make the spell work for dragon fire, too. Don't look
at me like that. I'm not going to stand in front of Kazul
and have her breathe fire at me. I'll just stick out a
finger, the way we did with the candle."
This was not enough to convince Alianora, but
Cimorene was determined. "The whole point of trying
this spell was to make ourselves immune to dragon
fire," she said. "If it doesn't work, I don't want to find
out for the first time when one of Kazul's guests gets
mad and breathes fire at me because he doesn't like
the way I cooked his cherries jubilee."
Alianora had to admit that this was a good point,
but she was still disposed to argue. The discussion was
cut short by Kazul's return. At first the dragon was
more inclined to agree with Alianora than with Cim-
orene, but after Cimorene proved her invulnerability to
candle flames, lighted torches, and the fire she had
built in the kitchen stove, Kazul agreed to the trial. She
insisted, however, on working up to full firepower in
gradual stages, and Cimorene was forced to agree.
Before they began, Cimorene threw another pinch
of feverfew into the air and recited the couplet again,
just to be sure the spell wouldn't wear off in the middle
of the test. Then Kazul lowered her head nearly to the
ground, and Alianora watched nervously as Cimorene
lowered her hand slowly into various intensities of
129
dragon flame. Finally, Cimorene stood right in front of
Kazul while the dragon breathed her hottest. The spell
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (79 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
worked perfectly every time.
"There!" Cimorene said when Kazul stopped at
last. "Now we know it works. Aren't you glad?"
"I'm glad," Alianora said fervently. "And I hope
I never have to watch anything like that again as long
as I live. I didn't dare blink for fear you'd go up in
smoke while my eyes were closed."
"Why don't you try it yourself?" Cimorene said
mischievously.
"No!" said Alianora and Kazul together.
"Watching you was bad enough," Alianora went
on with a shudder. "I believe it works. I don't see any
reason for me to test it."
"Besides, I've done more than enough fire-breath-
ing for one day," Kazul added. "I'm starting to get
overheated."
"All right, if you don't want to, you don't have
to," Cimorene said. "If we're all done, I'd better go
tidy up."
Alianora stayed to help Cimorene finish cleaning
up the traces of the spell, by which time she had calmed
down considerably and was very nearly her usual self
again. Cimorene gave her a pouchful of dried feverfew
before she left and made her recite the words that ac-
tivated the spell several times, to make sure she had
memorized them correctly.
"Remember, you only have to repeat the first half
of the verse to get the spell going, now that it's been
set up," Cimorene said. "Can you do it?"
130
"It's only two lines, and they rhyme!" Alianora
said, laughing. "How could I forget that? My memory
isn't that bad!"
"Maybe not, but say it anyway," Cimorene said.
Alianora laughed again and did so. At last she set off
into the tunnels and Cimorene went back to the main
cave to see what Kazul and Roxim had found out about
the Caves of Fire and Night.
Kazul was somewhat out of temper, and Cimorene
thought privately that she had been telling the truth
about getting overheated. Rather than annoy the
dragon further, Cimorene asked if she could read the
book Kazul had borrowed from Morwen.
"It's in the treasure room," Kazul said. "Read it
there. And I hope you see something in it that we
didn't."
Cimorene nodded, picked up her lamp, and hur-
ried off before Kazul could change her mind. The book
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (80 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
was lying near a pile of sapphires, next to an ornate
gold crown. She picked it up, went over to the table,
which was large and very sturdy because it was in-
tended for counting piles of gold and silver coins, and
sat down to read.
It was even dryer and duller than Kazul had said.
There were a great many "mayhaps" and "perchances"
and "wherefores," strung together in long, involved
sentences that compared the strange and wonderful
things in the caves to obscure philosophical ideas and
odd customs from places Cimorene had never heard
of. After a few pages, Cimorene put the book down
and went and got a quill pen, an ink pot, and some
131
paper, so that she could write down the things she
thought were important. She didn't want to have to
read A Journey Through the Caves of Fire and Night more
than once.
For the next three days, Cimorene spent bits of her
spare time in the treasure room, taking notes on the
DeMontmorency. It took her that long because she
could never manage to read for more than a little while
without getting so bored that she nearly fell asleep. Her
persistence gained her several pages of notes about the
caves, but nothing that seemed as if it might be of
particular interest to wizards.
Alianora came to see her a few days later, looking
very cheerful.
"It worked!" she announced as she came into the
library where Cimorene was going over her notes.
"Keredwel's gone. Therandil rescued her, just the way
you said he would."
"Good," Cimorene said. "I'm glad something is
going right."
"What's the problem?" Alianora asked, seating
herself on the other side of the table from Cimorene.
"This," Cimorene said, waving at the paper-
covered table. "Kazul is sure that the key to what the
wizards are after is somewhere in that dratted book she
borrowed from Morwen. I copied out everything that
looked interesting, but none of it seems like anything
a wizard would care about."
"How do you know that?" Alianora asked curi-
ously.
132
"I don't," Cimorene said. "I'm just guessing.
That's the problem."
"Oh." Alianora picked up the sheet of paper near-
est her and frowned at it. "What on earth does this
mean?"
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (81 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
Cimorene looked at the page Alianora was holding.
" Thus these Caves of Fire and Night are, in some
sense, indivisible, whereas the Caves of Chance are,
by contrast, individual, though it is preposterous to
claim that these descriptions are true of either group
of caves in their entirety . . .' That's one of the bits I
copied word for word; the whole book is like that. I
think it means that if you have a piece of something
magical from the Caves of Fire and Night, you can use
it in a spell as if it were the whole thing."
"I can see why you wouldn't be sure," Alianora
said. "Do you think it would help you figure things
out if you stopped for a while?"
"I have stopped," Cimorene pointed out. "Or did
you have something more specific in mind?"
"I'm almost out of feverfew," Alianora said, look-
ing down at the table. "I was hoping you'd come with
me to pick some more."
"You're almost out?" Cimorene said in surprise.
"How did that happen?"
Alianora shifted uncomfortably. "I've been work-
ing that fireproofing spell every hour or so for the past
two days," she admitted. "Woraug has been getting
more and more unpredictable, and I don't feel com-
fortable otherwise. Hallanna was visiting yesterday
when he came in—in the middle of the afternoon!—
133
and he was roaring and dripping little bits of flame
when he breathed. She was terrified, and I don't blame
her. If it weren't for the spell, I'd be scared to death."
"What's the matter with him?"
"I don't know. He doesn't tell me anything about
dragon politics or wizards or what he's been getting so
worked up about. He's not like Kazul."
Cimorene frowned, considering. "Maybe Kazul
will have some idea what's bothering him. I'll ask her
this evening. In the meantime, let's go get that fever-
few. You're right to say that I could use a break."
"Oh, good," said Alianora in tones of considerable
relief. "I've never picked herbs before, and I'm not sure
what feverfew looks like. I don't know what I'd have
done if you'd said you wouldn't come."
Cimorene put her notes away and got two wicker
baskets and a small knife from one of the storage rooms
"Up or down?" Alianora asked as they left the cave.
"Up," Cimorene said. "The other way is the ledge
I told you about, and I wouldn't be surprised if bits of
it are still invisible."
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (82 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
The path through the Pass of Silver Ice twisted and
turned past the openings of other dragons' caves. Most
of the rocks around the caves had scorch marks, and
Cimorene and Alianora didn't see much growing
among them.
"At this rate, we'll have to go nearly all the way
to the Enchanted Forest to find any grass, much less
herbs!" Alianora complained.
"Wait a minute!" Cimorene said. "Look over there,
134
through that crack in the rocks. Doesn't that look like
something green?"
Alianora's eyes followed Cimorene's pointing fin-
ger. "Yes," she said without enthusiasm. "It looks
green."
The rock Cimorene had indicated was a large boul-
der at the bottom of a steep slope. The slope was cov-
ered with gravel and looked as if it would be impossible
to climb down without skinning a knee or an elbow at
the very least. The boulder itself was in two pieces,
with just enough space between them for someone to
squeeze through, provided the someone was not very
large.
"Come on, let's get a better look," said Cimorene.
She walked to the edge of the slope and wrapped her
skirts tightly around her legs. Then she sat down with
her basket in her lap and slid down the slope, raising
an enormous cloud of dust and sounding like an ava-
lanche in process. She reached the bottom in safety and
stood up, brushing at her skirt. The dust was so thick
that she could hardly see, and when she tried to call
to Alianora, she coughed so hard that she could barely
speak.
"Cimorene! Are you all right?"
"It's just the dust," Cimorene said in a muffled
voice. She had taken out her handkerchief and put it
over her mouth and nose to keep the dust out. It wasn't
perfect, but it helped a great deal. "Come on, it's your
turn."
"Are you sure we shouldn't just go around?"
"Stop stalling. It's not that bad."
135
"That's what you say," Alianora muttered, but she
wrapped her skirts around her, clutched her basket,
and slid down the slope. She made even more noise
than Cimorene had. When she got to the bottom, she
was coughing and choking. Cimorene handed her the
handkerchief, and they waited for a moment while the
dust settled.
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (83 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
Crawling through the split boulder was easier than
they expected. The crevice was wider than it had looked
from the path, and the bottom of the crack was so full of
dust and gravel and dead leaves that it was almost flat.
Cimorene and Alianora had to walk single file, and there
were one or two spots where they had to turn sideways
in order to get through, but it was not really difficult.
On the other side of the boulder, the two girls
found a lush, green valley. It was bowl-shaped and not
very large, but flowers and grasses stood waist-high
between the random clumps of bushes that dotted the
valley floor. A squirrel, which had been sunning itself
on a ledge near the entrance, leaped for a small tree as
Cimorene and Alianora appeared.
"My goodness!" Alianora said, looking around
with wide eyes. "This place looks as if no one but us
has ever been here before. There aren't even any scorch
marks on the rocks."
Cimorene blinked. Alianora was right. Lichens cov-
ered the weathered gray rocks that rose above the val
ley, and small plants grew in cracks and crevices that
showed no sign of the touch of dragon fire.
"That's odd," Cimorene commented.
"Why?" Alianora asked.
136
"Those mountains aren't tall enough to keep drag-
ons from flying over, and they're right in the middle
of the dragons' territory. So why haven't the dragons
been here? They usually keep a dose eye on everything
that belongs to them."
"Maybe they have been here, but they never found
anything to breathe fire at," Alianora said.
"Well, I'm going to ask Kazul about it when I get
back," Cimorene said as she waded into the grass.
"Why don't you take that side, and I'll look over here?
We'll cover more ground that way."
"First you'd better show me what I'm looking for,"
Alianora said apologetically. "I'm afraid I couldn't tell
feverfew from carrots if there was a dragon chasing me
and my life depended on it."
Cimorene nodded, and they started off. They had
not gone far when she saw a patch of the white button-
shaped flowers she was looking for. "Here," she said,
showing them to Alianora. "This is feverfew. The
younger plants are the best, the ones that haven't blos-
somed yet."
Alianora studied the leaves and flowers with care.
"I think I'll recognize it now."
They cut some of the plants, leaving those that
were blooming.
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (84 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"You find the next patch," Cimorene said as they
started off again.
"Lefs try over there," Alianora said, pointing.
They found several more patches of feverfew, and
gradually their baskets began to fill. "I think this should
be enough," Cimorene said at last. "Unless you think—"
"Cimorene!" Alianora hissed, clutching at Cim-
orene's arm. "There's someone behind that bush!"
Cimorene turned. A dark line snaked through the
grass where something large had bent and broken the
plants in passing. "You're right," she said, and started
forward, Alianora hung back, still holding Cimorene's arm.
"You're not going to go look, are you?"
"How else are we going to find out who it is?"
Cimorene asked reasonably. She shook off Alianora's
hand. Quietly, she walked over to the clump of bushes
and peered around it. Alianora followed with evident
reluctance.
A man in blue and brown silk robes was crouched
on the other side of the bush with his back toward
Cimorene. He was stuffing saw-edged purple leaves
into a small linen bag the size of Cimorene's hand. His
hair was brown, and on the ground beside him lay a
long, polished staff.
"Antorell?" Cimorene said in surprise.
The man snatched up his staff and straightened as
if a bee had just stung him. It was indeed Antorell,
and he did not look at all pleased to see her. He stuffed
the linen bag quickly into his sleeve and said, "P-prin-
cess Cimorene! What brings you here?"
"I was about to ask you the same thing," Cimorene
said.
"Wizards go where they wish, answering to no
one," Antorell said, waving his free hand in a lofty
manner.
"Maybe outside the Mountains of Morning they
138
do, but around here they have to check with the drag-
ons first," Cimorene said.
"You know nothing of the matter," Antorell said,
looking very put out.
"Cimorene ..." Alianora's tone was doubtful.
"You know this person?
"I'm sorry; I should have introduced you. This is
Antorell, one of the wizards I told you about. Antorell,
this is Princess Alianora of the Duchy of Toure-on-
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (85 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
Marsh. At the moment, she's the princess of the dragon
Woraug."
Alianora curtsied, murmuring something polite
and inaudible. Antorell, who had stiffened in surprise
when he realized that Cimorene was not alone, relaxed
visibly. "Woraug's princess? That's all right, then.
Though he really shouldn't have sent you."
"But Woraug didn't—ow!" said Alianora. The
"ow" was because Cimorene had hastily kicked her
ankle to keep her from telling Antorell too much.
"Didn't what?" Antorell asked, frowning suspi-
ciously.
"Didn't know you were going to be here," Cim-
orene said.
"Well, of course he didn't know!" Antorell said,
looking annoyed. "That's the whole point, after all."
Cimorene would have very much liked to ask him
what the point was, but she was afraid it would make
him suspidous again. "I don't understand," she said
instead, batting her eyes at him.
"Of course not," Antorell replied in a condescend-
139
ing tone that made Cimorene's teeth hurt. "But it
doesn't matter. I'm not annoyed with you."
"I'm so glad," Cimorene murmured.
Antorell gave her an oily smile. "In fact, there's no
need for you to tell Woraug that you met me here."
"I wouldn't dream of it," Cimorene said with per-
fect truth.
"Excellent," Antorell said. "Then may I escort the
two of you back to the path?"
Alianora looked hopefully in Cimorene's direction.
"But we can't leave yet," Cimorene said, opening
her eyes very wide. "We haven't picked any cornflow-
ers or daisies." Behind her, she heard Alianora making
a smothered, choking noise, as if she were trying very
hard not to laugh.
"Daisies," Antorell said in a flat, incredulous tone
"You want to stay and pick daisies?"
Cimorene nodded vigorously. "And cornflowers,
and flax, and all sorts of things," she said, waving her
hand at the flowers blooming all around. "They'll look
so pretty in a bowl of water in the kitchen."
"I'm sure you're right," Antorell said. He looked
as if he would have liked to object, but couldn't think
of anything to object to. "Perhaps I could help you?"

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
he said reluctantly.
"Oh, we wouldn't dream of keeping you," Cim-
orene said.
Antorell was clearly reluctant to leave the two girls
in the valley, but Cimorene did not give him much
choice. After another minute or so of conversation, the
wizard was forced to go. He did not use a vanishing
spell but trudged away on foot. Cimorene watched him
140
until he was out of sight among the bushes, wondering
whether he had some spedal reason not to use spells
in the valley or whether he simply didn't know the
right spells to make himself vanish.
"That's a relief!" Alianora said. "Why did you in-
sist on staying when it was so obvious that he wanted
us to leave? I was afraid he was going to turn us into
toads or something."
"I wanted to see what he was up to/' Cimorene
said. "And I don't think Antorell is a very good wizard.
He probably couldn't manage anything worse than a
squirrel."
Alianora did not appear to find this very reassur-
ing. Cimorene checked to make sure Antorell was out
of sight, then went over to the place where he had been
standing when she peered around the bush. At first
she did not notice anything unusual. Then she saw a
purplish plant oozing sap from the places where several
of its spiky, saw-toothed leaves had been broken off.
"Look at this."
"What is it?" Alianora asked.
"I don't know," Cimorene said absently. "I saw a
couple of other plants like this while we were picking
feverfew, but I thought they were just weeds."
"Maybe it is a weed."
"A wizard wouldn't sneak into the dragons' section
of the Mountains of Morning just to pick weeds. They
don't even use herbs to cast spells, so what does An-
torell want with this prickly looking thing?"
Alianora shrugged. "Maybe he needs it for some-
thing he can't do with magic."
"I wonder what that would be?" Cimorene reached
141
out and carefully broke off a spray of leaves. She
wrapped them in her handkerchief and put the packet
in her pocket. "Let's see if we can find out whether he
picked anything else."
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (87 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
Antorell had left a dark trail of bent and broken
plants to mark the way he had come, so his path was
easy to follow. Cimorene and Alianora searched care-
fully along it for some way, looking for signs that the
wizard had picked other herbs, but neither of them saw
any.
"I don't think there's anything to find," Alianora
said, pushing her apricot-colored hair out of her face.
"And it's getting awfully warm."
"Have you noticed that there aren't any of those
purple plants along here?" Cimorene said. "I'll bet that
was all he wanted."
"Then let's leave before that wizard thinks to circle
around to check on what we're doing," Alianora urged.
Cimorene doubted that Antorell would think of
doing such a thing, but she nodded agreement, and
the two girls left the valley. Alianora was quiet and
thoughtful for most of the walk back to Kazul's cave.
Cimorene was grateful for her silence. She had a lot to
think about herself. From what Antorell had said, it
seemed likely that Woraug was helping the wizards
somehow, or at least that he had known what Antorell
was looking for in the little valley. Cimorene found it
difficult to imagine a dragon helping a wizard, but she
couldn't say with certainty that it was impossible. And
if Woraug was involved with Antorell and Zemenar, it
might explain why he had been so touchy lately.
142
When they arrived back at the cave, Cimorene shook
herself free of her preoccupation. She and Alianora
unloaded their baskets and tied the herbs in bunches
to hang in a dark comer of the kitchen to dry.
"How long will it be before I can use the feverfew?"
Alianora asked worriedly.
"I'm not sure," Cimorene said in a considering
tone. "It will take at least a week to dry thoroughly,
but you might be able to use it in the spell before then.
The directions don't say how dry the feverfew has to
be. We could try it every day with a pinch of leaves
from one of these bunches if you like."
Alianora nodded. "I really do need it."
"I wonder if it would work without being dried?"
Cimorene said. She pulled a leaf from one of the hang-
ing plants and shredded it carefully between her fin-
gers, then tossed it up in the air and recited the rhyme.
"There! Now, light a candle or another lamp or
something."
Alianora had already lit a candle and set it on the
table. Cimorene moved over and stuck her finger in
the flame.
"I think it's working," she said, and moved the
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (88 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
rest of her hand closer.
The sleeve of her dress caught fire. Cimorene has-
tily pulled her hand away from the candle and slapped at
the flames, while Alianora snatched up a bucket of water
from beside the sink and poured it over Cimorene's arm.
The fire went out and so did the candle, and both Cim-
orene and Alianora got thoroughly soaked.
"Oh, dear!" Alianora said, ignoring her soggy
skirts. "Cimorene, did you burn yourself?"
"No," Cimorene said, looking at her arm with a
puzzled expression. "I didn't feel a thing. I thought the
spell worked, but nothing caught fire when we tested
it before."
"It must be because the fevenew is fresh instead
of dried. And I had hoped that I'd be able to use it right
away!"
"If you're that low on dried feverfew, take some
of mine," Cimorene offered. "Kazul's not particularly
irritable. I only need to keep a pinch or two in case of
emergencies."
"Thank you!" Alianora said fervently, and Cim-
orene turned her soggy cuffs back and went to get the
bottled spices.
144
11
In Which Kazul Is Unwell, and Cimorene
Makes a New Acquaintance
Alianora decided to return home by way of the path
outside instead of through the tunnels because it was
such a nice day and she hoped the sun would dry her
skirt. Cimorene watched her go, swinging her basket
happily and humming a little, her confidence and good
humor completely restored by the possession of the fat
little packet of dried feverfew in her pocket.
"I wish I had as little to worry about," Cimorene
muttered, thinking of Woraug and the wizards. She
held the burned patch at the end of her sleeve up to
get a better look at it in the sunlight and shook her
head. Even the magic wardrobe would have a hard
time fixing that. A puff of wind made her shiver in her
145
wet clothes, and she turned to go back into the cav-
to change.
A dark shadow fell over Cimorene, and she
stopped and looked up. "Kazul!" she said as the dragon
landed on the open path beside her. "Am I glad to see
you. Wait until you hear what's been happening!"
"You do appear to have had a rather strenuous
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (89 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
day," Kazul said, eyeing Cimorene's wet, stained skirt
and the blackened end of her right sleeve. "Nothing
serious, I trust?"
"I'm not sure," Cimorene said. "Alianora and I
went out to pick some feverfew, and we ran into that
wizard Antorell."
"Where was this?"
Cimorene pointed. "Up that way. There's a little
round valley off to one side that looks as if dragons
never go there, and—"
"You found a wizard there?" Kazul sounded deeply
disturbed. "How did he get in? How did you get in?"
"We climbed through a crack in a boulder," Cim-
orene said. "I don't know how Antorell did it. When
he left, he was heading for the far side of the valley "
"This is serious," Kazul said, getting to her feet
"I'd better warn the King. He'll have to use the crystal
now."
"You'd better hear the rest of it first," Cimorene
said. "Antorell wasn't too happy to see us, but when
he found out that Alianora was Woraug's princess, he
relaxed. He seemed to think that Woraug had sent us "
"What?"
Cimorene involuntarily stepped back a pace at the
anger in Kazul's voice. "He thought Woraug had sent
146
us," she repeated, and gave a quick summary of her
conversation with Antorell.
"Woraug!" Kazul's tail lashed, sweeping a small
boulder from one side of the path to the other. "But
Woraug's not a fool, and only a fool would let a wizard
into that valley. Unless he was sure that they didn't
know ... What was Antorell doing?"
"Cutting plants," Cimorene said. "Or rather, cut-
ting a plant. It didn't look as if he took more than one."
"He wouldn't need more than one, if it was the
right one," Kazul said tensely. "What did he pick?"
"It was a prickly looking purple thing, with saw-
edged leaves," Cimorene said, reaching into her
pocket. "I didn't recognize it, but I thought you might,
so I brought a piece back for you to look—"
"What?" Kazul roared.
Flame spurted from the dragon's mouth, envel-
oping Cimorene. Steam hissed from her wet skirt, and
the thinner material of her sleeves vanished in a crackle
of sparks. The handkerchief-wrapped spray of purple
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (90 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
leaves, which she had just taken out of her pocket to
show Kazul, disintegrated into a dark, greasy-looking
cloud of smoke.
Cimorene stared at the ashes in her palm, feeling
very, very glad that she had decided to test the way
fresh feverfew would work in the fireproofing spell.
She felt a little warm, and her clothes had been reduced
to a few charred rags, but that was nothing compared
to what might have happened.
"Now I understand why Alianora ran out of fe-
verfew," she muttered.
A puff of wind brushed Cimorene's arms, and she
i47
heard a choking sound from Kazul. She looked up,
expecting to find the dragon laughing at her remark,
and her eyes widened. Kazul's head was thrown back,
and her mouth was wide open, giving Cimorene an
excellent view of the dragon's sharp silver teeth and
long red tongue. Cimorene skipped backward out of
reach; then she realized that the dragon was gasping
for air.
"Kazul! What's the matter?"
"The smoke!" Kazul coughed. Her voice was so
hoarse that it was hard for Cimorene to understand
what she was saving.
"What can I do?" Cimorene said, trying not to feel
frightened.
"Green jar—shelf in last treasure room," Kazul
managed between coughs. "Hurry."
Cimorene was already running through the mouth
of the cave as fast as her feet could carry her. She did
not even pause as she snatched up her lamp from the
floor just inside the door. It seemed to take forever to
get through the twisty passages and the first two caves
full of treasure. She skidded to a halt in the doorway
of the third room and stood panting, scanning the walls
for the shelf and the right jar. She found it quickly and
ran back at once, the jar clutched tightly in her right
hand.
The sound of Kazul's coughing grew louder as
Cimorene sped back the way she had come. At the
mouth of the cave, Cimorene paused and set down the
lamp, then unscrewed the top of the green jar. Inside
was a thick, emerald-colored liquid about the consi&-
148
tency of honey. She looked out at Kazul. The dragon's
head jerked with each cough, and the scales on her
neck were beginning to turn pink around the edges.
For a long, careful moment Cimorene studied Kazul's
movements. Then she leaned back and threw the em-
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (91 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
erald liquid, jar and all, into the dragon's open mouth
just as Kazul took another gasping breath.
The jar landed on Kazul's tongue. The dragon's
mouth dosed, and she swallowed convulsively. Sud-
den silence descended.
"Are you all right now?" Cimorene asked after
Kazul had taken several deep breaths without a re-
newed bout of coughing.
"I will be," Kazul said. She sounded exhausted,
and her movements as she slid into the cave were slow
and uncertain.
"What happened?" Cimorene said, backing out of
the way so that Kazul would not have to exert herself
to go around.
"I got a breath of the smoke when the plant in
your hand burned," Kazul said as she settled to the
floor just inside the entrance. "Lucky it was only a
breath. I'll need a few days of rest, but that's better
than being dead."
Cimorene stared at her, appalled. "What was that
plant?"
"Dragonsbane," said Kazul. Her eyes closed and
she slept.
Kazul continued to sleep for most of the next three
days. She woke only long enough for Cimorene to pour
149
a couple of gallons of warm milk mixed with honey
down her throat from time to time before she lapsed
back into unconsciousness. Cimorene was very wor-
ried, but there wasn't much that she could do. Sick
dragons are too large and heavy for normal nursing to
be of much use.
On the afternoon of the third day, Kazul woke up
completely for the first time since her collapse.
"Thank goodness!" said Cimorene as Kazul shook
her head experimentally and sat up. "I was beginning
to think you were going to sleep for a month."
"I might have if I'd gotten more than a whiff of
that smoke." Kazul stretched her neck in one direction
and her tail in the other, trying to work out some of
the kinks.
"If I'd known it was so dangerous, I'd never have
brought any of that purple plant back with me," Cim-
orene apologized. "You might have done worse than
sleep for a month. You might have—" She stopped,
unwilling to complete the thought.
"I might have died?" Kazul said. "Unlikely. If a
dragon isn't killed outright by something in the first
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (92 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
five minutes, recovery is only a matter of time. That
applies as much to dragonsbane as to a knight's magic
sword."
"Then why did you want that goo in the green
jar?" Cimorene asked.
"The antidote? I wanted it because I didn't like the
idea of spending a month recuperating when I didn't
have to. And since—" A fit of coughing interrupted
Kazul in mid-sentence.
150
Cimorene skipped backward out of the way.
Frowning worriedly, she tossed a pinch of feverfew into
the air and recited the verse from the fireproofing spell
in case Kazul should lose control of her flame again.
"Maybe you won't need a month to recover, but three
days obviously isn't enough," she said to the dragon.
"You'd better lie back down before you choke."
"I can't," Kazul said. "I have to warn the King. If
the wizards have had dragonsbane for three days al-
ready—" She started coughing again and had to stop
talking.
"You stay here," Cimorene said in a firm tone. "I'll
warn the King."
"Tokoz won't listen to you," Kazul said, but she
settled back to the ground. "Roxim will, though. Start
with him."
"Roxim?" Cimorene said doubtfully. She was
afraid the gray-green dragon would want to go charging
out after the wizards as soon as he heard they were up
to something.
"He'll listen to you, and the King will listen to
him," Kazul said. "It's not ideal, but it's the best we
can do."
"All right, I'll go see Roxim. You stay here and
sleep."
"When you get back—"
"I'll wake you and tell you what he said," Cim-
orene promised. "Now, go to sleep."
Kazul smiled slightly and closed her eyes. Cim-
orene caught up a lamp and almost ran to the exit at the
back of the cave. She was afraid that Kazul would think
of something else and start talking again, and she didn't
think talking would be good for her.
In the tunnel outside, Cimorene paused, trying to
remember the directions to Roxim's cave. She had
memorized a map in the library that showed most of
the twists and turns of the dragons' tunnels, but she
knew from experience that in the miles of gray store
corridors it was difficult to keep track of where she wa=
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (93 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"Left, left, fifth right, past the little chamber, right
again, on past the iron gate, two lefts to the third cave
down," she muttered to herself. "I wish Roxim's cave
were closer." Still muttering, she started off.
Though she was being very careful, Cimorene had
to backtrack twice during the first part of her trip when
a mistake in counting corridors led her to a dead end.
When she finally saw the iron gate that led into the
Caves of Fire and Night, she sighed in relief. The tricky
part was over, and the rest of the trip would be easy.
She held her lamp up and quickened her step, hoping
to make up some of the time she had lost on her de-
tours. Then, as she reached the bars that blocked the
entrance to the Caves of Fire and Night, she stopped
short. There was someone sitting on the ground on the
other side of the gate.
Cimorene had almost missed seeing him, and no
wonder. His clothes, though well cut, were the same
dark gray as the stone of the tunnel walls, and he was
curled into a lumpy, dejected ball. He looked like a
large rock. If he hadn't moved his hand as she passed,
Cimorene would never have realized he was alive.
The man on the other side of the bars raised his
152
head, and Cimorene saw with shock that his hair and
skin were the same dark, even gray as his clothes. His
eves, too, were gray, and their expression was apolo-
getic.
"Forgive me for startling you," the man said,
climbing ponderously to his feet. "I didn't see you com-
ine." He made a stiff, formal bow.
"Who are you?" Cimorene demanded. "And what
are you doing in there?"
"I'm a prince," the man said in a gloomy tone,
"and I'm reaping the rewards of my folly."
"What folly?"
The prince sighed. "It's a long story."
"Somehow they always seem to be long," Cim-
orene said. "You haven't come to rescue me from the
dragons, have you? Because if you have, I'm not going
to let you out of there. I haven't got time to spend an
hour arguing today."
"I have no interest whatever in dragons, I assure
you," the prince said earnestly. "And if you would let
me out, I'd be extremely grateful. Um, who are you,
by the way?"
"Cimorene, princess of the dragon Kazul," Cim-
orene said. She studied the prince for a moment and
decided that he looked trustworthy. "All right, I'll let
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (94 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
you out. Turn around and put your fingers in your
ears."
"What?" the prince said, looking considerably
startled.
"It's part of the spell to open the gate," Cimorene
said. She wasn't about to let him overhear the words
Kazul had used to unlock the door, even if he did look
trustworthy.
The prince shrugged and did as she directed.
Quickly, Cimorene recited:
"By night and flame and shining rock
Open thou thy hidden lock.
Alberolingam!"
For an instant nothing happened, and Cimorene
was afraid she had not remembered the charm cor-
rectly. Then the iron gate swung silently open. The
prince, whose back was to the gate, did not notice.
Cimorene touched his shoulder to get his attention, and
her eyes widened.
"Oh!" she said as he turned. "You're—you're
stone."
"I know," the prince said. "It's part of that long
story I mentioned earlier. I haven't gotten used to it
yet." He stepped through the gate, and it closed noise-
lessly behind him.
"I'm afraid I don't have time to listen to stories
just now," Cimorene said politely. "I have a rather
urgent errand to run, so if you'll excuse me—"
"Can't I come with you?"
Cimorene stared at him. "Why do you want to do
that?"
The stone prince looked down at his feet with an
embarrassed expression. "Um, well, actually, I'm lost.
And you seem to know your way around down here."
He glanced hopefully at Cimorene's face, then sighed.
i54
"I suppose I can just wander around some more. I'll
have to find a way out eventually."
"You'll run into a dragon and get eaten."
"I don't think it will hurt stone," the prince said.
He sounded almost cheerful, as if he had only just
realized that being made of stone might have some
advantages.
"Maybe not, but you're sure to give the dragon
indigestion," Cimorene said. "Bother! I don't have time
for this!"
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (95 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"I could wait here if you're coming back this way,"
the stone prince suggested.
Cimorene brightened, then frowned and shook her
head. "No, one of the dragons might need to get into
the Caves of Fire and Night, or it might be the turn of
those dratted wizards. You can't stay here."
"Then—"
"I know! You can wait in the serving room, just
off the banquet hall," Cimorene said. "It's close, there's
plenty of room, and I know no one's using it today
because I checked the schedule for Alianora yesterday.
I can take a shortcut out the back to get to Roxim's
without losing any more time. Come on."
"1 really appreciate this," the stone prince said as
they started off. "You don't know what it's like, being
lost in the dark in these caves."
"How did it happen?" Cimorene asked.
The stone prince's expression became gloomy once
more. "It's all that soothsayer's fault," he said.
"Soothsayer?"
"My father didn't think it was appropriate to invite
i55
fairies to a prince's christening, so he invited a sooth-
sayer instead," the prince replied. "The soothsayer took
one look at me and said that I would grow up to do a
great service for a king. I've been stuck with his blasted
prophecy ever since."
"It doesn't sound so terrible to me," Cimorene
said.
"It wasn't, at first," the stone prince admitted. "I
had special tutors in all sorts of interesting things to
prepare me for being of great service to a king. My
father even sent me to a spedal school for people
who're supposed to do spedal things."
"Did you do well?"
"I was the top of my class," the stone prince said
with a flash of pride. His face fell again. "That's part
of the problem."
"I don't understand," Cimorene said. "This way.
And can you walk a little faster, please? I'm in a hurry."
"It's been three years since I graduated, and every-
one's still waiting for me to do something spectacular,"
the stone prince said, lengthening his stride. "The rest
of my dassmates are already making names for them-
selves. George started killing dragons right away, and
Art went straight home and pulled some sort of magic
sword out of a rock. Even the ones nobody expected

to amount to much have done something. All Jack
wanted to do was go back to his mother's farm and
raise beans, and he ended up stealing a magic harp
and killing a giant and all sorts of things. I'm the only
one who hasn't succeeded."
"Why not?"
The stone prince sighed again. "I don't know. At
156
first it seemed as if I wouldn't have any trouble finding
a king to serve. Every time there was a war, both kings
asked me to lead their armies, and every king for miles
around who'd lost his throne to a usurper sent a mes-
senger to my father's court. It should have been simple.
Only they were always so worried about whether I was
going to side with their enemies that it was easier not
to pick anyone."
"I see," said Cimorene. Privately she thought that
the stone prince had been rather wishy-washy.
Some of her opinion must have crept into her tone
because the stone prince nodded glumly. "You're right.
It was a mistake. As long as I didn't pick a king to
serve, all the messengers and ambassadors and envoys
stayed, hoping to persuade me. The inns around (he
castle were stuffed with them. It got to the point where
I couldn't show my face without at least three of them
pouncing on me.
"Finally I couldn't stand it any more, and I ran
away. It was a relief at first, not having everyone hov-
ering over me waiting for me to do something great.
But after a while I started feeling uncomfortable. Then
I realized that even if nobody around me expected me
to do anything spedal in the service of a king, I ex-
pected me to do something.
"I was so flustered that I ran up to the next palace
I saw and asked whether the king needed any services
done. It turned out that he was ill, and his doctors had
told him that the only thing that would cure him was
a drink of the Water of Healing from the Caves of Fire
and Night. So I left to get it at once."
"So that's what you were doing!" Cimorene said.
i57
The stone prince gave her another gloomy nod. "I
should have known better. That king had three sons,
and the first two had already gone off to get the water
and failed. Anyone with sense would have seen that
the youngest son was the one who would succeed; it
sticks out all over. But I was too eager to do my great
service and get it over with, and I didn't stop and
think."
"What happened?"

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"It took me a long time to find the Caves of Fire
and Night, but once I did, it wasn't hard to find the
Water of Healing. The chamber's getting crowded. All
the princes who've tried to get the water and failed
have been turned into slabs of rock."
"I know. I've seen them," Cimorene said. "Watch
out for your head; the ceiling is low along here."
"Then you know what it's like, and you've seen
the two dippers on the wall by the spring." The stone
prince's shoulder's sagged. "I knew I should use the tin
one. It was one of the first things we learned at school.
But I thought it wouldn't do any harm if I just looked
at the gold one, so I took it off the wall. And as soon
as I touched it, I started to stiffen up."
"Urn," said Cimorene. The stone prince was ob-
viously well aware of how foolishly he had behaved.
She saw no reason to make him feel worse by pointing
it out to him again.
"So I stuck my arm in the spring," the prince said.
"You stuck your arm—oh, I see! That was clever,"
Cimorene said.
"Do you really think so?" the stone prince asked
158
anxiously. "I thought that since the water from the
spring is going to turn all the slabs of stone back into
princes when someone finally succeeds in the quest,
then the water ought to keep me from turning into a
slab of stone in the first place. Only it didn't work the
way I expected," he finished disconsolately.
"I can see that," Cimorene said. "But at least you
can still do things. It would be much worse to have to
lie there waiting for the right prince to come along and
break the spell."
"I wouldn't have had to lie there very long," the
stone prince said. "That king's youngest son is going
to arrive any day now, I just know it. Anyway, if I
were a slab of stone, I wouldn't know about it until it
was all over and I'd been turned back into a prince
again."
"How do you know?" Cimorene demanded.
"Have you ever been a stone slab?"
The stone prince looked startled. "No, I haven't. I
never thought of that."
"Well, start thinking now," Cimorene said tartly.
"Here's the service room. Wait here for me, and don't
go wandering off if I'm late getting back. I don't know
how long this errand is going to take, and it would be
very awkward for me if the dragons found you roaming
through their tunnels."
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (98 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"I'll remember," the stone prince promised. "But
what do I do if someone comes in?"
"Duck into the banquet area," Cimorene said,
showing him. "And if someone comes in there, too,
curl up in the corner and pretend you're a rock."
"All right," the prince said doubtfully.
Cimorene did not like leaving him, but she was
even less enthusiastic about taking him to see Roxim.
Roxim probably wouldn't object to the prince himself,
though Cimorene suspected that there might have been
some difficulty over his proposed theft of the Water of
Healing. But explaining everything to the gray-green
dragon would take hours. Roxim was nice, but he
tended to take a simple view of things, and the prince's
situation was anything but simple. So Cimorene gave
the prince one more warning, just to make sure he
understood, and started off toward Roxim's cave to
finish her errand.
160

In Which Cimorene Calls on a Dragon,
and the Stone Prince Discovers a Plot
The shortcut to Roxim's worked just as well as Cim-
orene had hoped, and she even made up some of the
time she had lost earlier. Roxim was in, too. She could
hear the scraping of his scales as he moved around
inside. She stepped up to the entrance of the cave and
called, "Dragon Roxim!"
Something round and shiny flew through the air,
missing Cimorene by inches. It hit the wall of the tunnel
with a loud clang and slid rattling to the floor. Cimorene
jumped.
"Roxim!" she shouted at the top of her lungs.
"What's this?" the dragon said, poking his nose
out of the cave entrance.
161
"I am Cimorene, princess to the dragon Kazul, and
I offer you greetings and good fortune in all your en-
deavors." Cimorene thought it best to be particularly
polite, in case Roxim were in a bad mood. She sus-
pected he might be. In her experience, someone in a
good mood did not throw things at visitors.
"Very good," Roxim said. "Nice to see you again
and all that, but I haven't got time for visitors at the
moment. Sorry."
"I'm not a visitor, exactly. Kazul sent me with a
message for you."
"Oh, well, that's different. Just hand me that shield
there, would you?"
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20E...orest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (99 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
Cimorene picked up the shield from the floor of
the tunnel. There was a large dent in one side where
it had hit the tunnel wall, and several smaller ones over
the rest of it from banging against things on its way to
the tunnel floor.
"You ought to be more careful," she said severely.
"Just look at this!"
"Ha!" Roxim snorted, examining the dents.
"Shoddy work, shoddy work, that's the problem. In
my day, you could roll a knight in full armor down the
far side of the Vanishing Mountain and bounce him off
two or three cliffs without so much as scratching his
surface, much less denting it. This cheap modern stuff
just doesn't hold up."
"If you know it doesn't hold up, you shouldn't
throw it around like that," Cimorene said. "You almost
hit me."
Roxim shifted uncomfortably. "Sorry. Didn't mean
anything by it."
162
"All right, but next time look before you throw
things," Cimorene said, handing him the shield.
"I always have this problem when I try to find
something," Roxim confided. "Never know where to
look. Gets frustrating, and next thing you know I'm
pitching armor at the walls. Bad habit, but hard to
break."
"Maybe I could help," Cimorene suggested. "After
I give you Kazul's message, that is."
"Don't need help to put dents in things," Roxim
said. "Comes to that, I don't really want it."
"I didn't mean help throw things," Cimorene said
patiently. "I meant help find whatever you're looking
for."
"Oh, that. Well, come in then."
Cimorene followed the dragon into a moderately
large cave, similar to the one Kazul used as a living
area. Roxim's cave, however, was full of clutter. Cim-
orene had to pick her way past bits of armor, one half
of a pair of bookends, a box of tea, a pink scroll, three
mismatched kitchen pots, a small wooden statue, a
broken flute, and four partially burned candles. Roxim
walked straight over the mess as if it weren't there,
squashing a mangy-looking stuffed pigeon and flatten-
ing a tin cup in passing. He dropped the shield on a
pile of silk flowers and waved Cimorene to a seat on
a large wooden chest near one wall. "Now, what's this
message of Kazul's?"
"It's about the wizards," Cimorene said, settling
gingerly onto the dusty surface of the chest. She made
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (100 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
a mental note to find Roxim a nice princess as soon as
she possibly could. "Alianora and I found one of them
163
picking dragonsbane a few days ago, and Kazul thinks
King Tokoz will listen to you if you tell him about it"
"So that's where they got it," Roxim said in tones
of disgust. "Pity you didn't mention it sooner."
Cimorene got a sinking feeling. "What do you
mean?"
"Somebody poisoned King Tokoz this morning,"
Roxim explained. "Slipped some dragonsbane in his
coffee. Fast-acting; nothing to be done. Now we need
a new king."
"That's awful!" Cimorene said. "Do you know who
did it?"
"Those dratted wizards, that's who," Roxim said
angrily. "It's obvious. Stupid thing to do; has to be
wizards, by George! But Woraug won't listen to me "
"Woraug? What's Woraug got to do with it?"
"He's in charge of the investigation," Roxim re-
plied. "Taking his time about it, too, if you ask me."
"But if the King was only poisoned this morn-
ing ..."
"What does that have to do with it?" Roxim said
unreasonably. "Besides, if Woraug doesn't hurry, he
won't have the culprit in hand by the time the trials
start tomorrow."
"Trials? You mean with Colin's Stone, to choose
the new king?" Cimorene said with some hesitation.
She did not see how it could be a trial for the person
who had killed the King if they hadn't caught him yet,
but she was not completely certain that the dragons
didn't have some way of getting around the problem
and trying him anyway.
"That's it," Roxim said, pleased. "And before I
164
leave I have to find that emerald I picked up fifty years
ago. Coronation present for the new King."
"But you haven't got a new King yet," Cimorene
said feeling somewhat bewildered. "And what if you're
the King?"
Roxim smiled broadly. "Knew you were a nice gal.
Me the King! I rather like the idea. I still have to find
the emerald, though. Wouldn't do to show up at the
trials without a coronation present. Rum thing to do.
Overconfident."
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (101 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
Though she was upset and more than a little wor-
ried, Cimorene helped Roxim as best she could. After
about an hour of poking through the clutter, Cimorene
found the emerald, wrapped in a gold-embroidered
handkerchief and stuffed into the mouth of a large brass
horn. Roxim thanked her and invited her to stay to tea,
but Cimorene politely declined. She was eager to get
back to Kazul, to tell her what had happened and de-
cide what to do next.
Cimorene hurried back to Kazul's cave by the shortest
route, thinking so hard about Tokoz's death that she
forgot everything else. She found Kazul sleeping and
was forced to wake her, despite her worries about the
dragon's health. She knew Kazul would want to hear
about the King of the Dragons as soon as possible, and
she wanted to hear what Kazul made of Woraug's in-
volvement in the investigation.
"Back already?" Kazul said, opening her eyes.
"Didn't Roxim get you in to see King Tokoz?"
"No," Cimorene said. She hesitated, uncertain of
the best way to break the news. "It was too late."
165
"Too late?" Kazul raised her head, startled. She
eyed Cimorene briefly, then said, "All right, let's have
it. What's happened?"
"King Tokoz was poisoned this morning. Roxim
said someone put dragonsbane in his coffee."
Kazul snorted. "Somebody knew Tokoz pretty
well." Seeing Cimorene's surprised expression, she ex-
plained, "Tokoz drank Turkish coffee every morning.
The stuff is strong enough to take the roof off your
mouth. It's why no one ever went to talk to him over
breakfast. You could boil a whole field's worth of drag-
onsbane in Turkish coffee without changing the taste
enough to notice. Or the texture."
Cimorene tried to imagine coffee, even Turkish cof-
fee, strong enough to take the roof off a dragon's mouth
and failed. "I told Roxim about the wizard Alianora
and I met, and Roxim said I ought to tell Woraug be-
cause Woraug is in charge of finding the poisoner,"
she said. "But—"
"But when you caught Antorell picking dragons-
bane, he thought Woraug had sent you," Kazul said.
"If Woraug's mixed up with wizards—" She broke off,
coughing. Cimorene watched her anxiously, but the
coughing spasm did not last long. "I don't like this,"
Kazul finished when she got her breath back.
"I don't, either," Cimorene agreed. "But what can
we do about it?"
Kazul frowned and said nothing. For several min-
utes, the two sat and thought in silence. Then Kazul
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (102 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
said, "We can't do anything until the new King has
been chosen. Did Roxim say when the testing will be?"
"Tomorrow," Cimorene said.
166
"Tomorrow!" Kazul surged to her feet. "Why
didn't you say so at once? If I'm to be at the Ford of
Whispering Snakes tomorrow, I have to—"
"Lie down!" Cimorene commanded. Kazul looked
at her in surprise and collapsed in another fit of cough-
ing. Cimorene waited until the dragon's coughing had
subsided, then said sternly, "You're in no condition to
go hauling rocks all over the countryside. I'd be sur-
prised if you can even fly as far as the end of the pass.
I think you're going to have to give up on the trials
this time around."
Kazul made a choking noise. Cimorene looked at
her in alarm, then realized that the dragon was
laughing.
"It's not optional. Princess," Kazul said. "All the
adult dragons in the Mountains of Morning are required
to show up, no matter what condition they're in."
"But—"
"There is no acceptable excuse for missing the test-
ing of a new King," Kazul repeated. "None. And I have
a great deal to do before I leave, so if you'll—"
"If anything needs to be done around here, I'll do
it," Cimorene said firmly. "If you don't rest, you won't
be able to fly at all, and then how will you get to the
ford?"
"A reasonable point," Kazul said, settling reluc-
tantly back into place. "Very well. The first thing I need
is a coronation present for the new King. There's a
jeweled helmet on a shelf in the second storeroom that
might do. Bring it out so I can take a look at it."
Cimorene spent the rest of the evening running
errands for Kazul. Besides choosing a coronation gift
167
(Kazul rejected the helmet and two crowns before de-
ciding on a scepter made of gold and crystal), innu-
merable messages had to be delivered to various
dragons who were in charge of arranging the trials.
This one had to be informed of Kazul's ill health, so
that it could be taken into account when the order of
the testing was established; that one had to be told that
Kazul would not be able to join the coronation proces-
sion. Substitutes had to be found to perform Kazul's
various ceremonial duties, then their names had to be
approved by a surly dragon in charge of protocol, and
finally the substitutions had to be recorded on all the
lists of all the dragons who were managing each of the
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (103 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
events. It reminded Cimorene strongly of Linderwall
and her parents' court.
By the time the last arrangement had been made
and the last message delivered, it was very late ana
Cimorene was exhausted. She was also very glad she
had not let Kazul do all the running around. The
dragon, who had slept most of the time Cimorene was
out, was looking much better, even in the dim light of
Cimorene's lamp. Tired but satisfied, Cimorene went
to her room and dropped into bed.
Cimorene was up early the next morning, stirring a
dozen ostrich eggs in a large iron kettle for Kazul's
breakfast. Kazul ate all of them, then slid out of the
cave and prepared to leave for the Ford of Whispering
Snakes.
"Don't fret. Princess," Kazul said. "The testing
doesn't start until ten. I have plenty of time to get there,
168
even if I stop to rest now and then." Her voice sounded
much better than it had the day before, and it no longer
seemed to rasp her throat. "While I'm gone, why don't
you visit Woraug's princess? See if she's noticed any-
thing odd these past few days. We need to know as
much as we can before we talk to the new King about
Woraug and the wizards."
"All right," Cimorene said. "As soon as I'm done
with the dishes."
Kazul turned and leaped into the air, her wings
churning clouds of dust from the dry surface of the
ground. Cimorene squinted after her and shouted,
"Good luck!" Kazul's wings dipped in answer before
the dragon soared out of sight behind the shoulder of
the next mountain. Cimorene stood looking after Kazul,
her forehead wrinkling in worry. After a moment she
shook herself and went inside. She had work to do.
Washing the dishes did not take long, and as soon
as she was done, Cimorene set off to visit Alianora.
The tunnels and passageways were silent and empty,
and Cimorene's footsteps echoed eerily through the
darkness. She began to wish she had taken the longer
route along the outside of the mountain. She had not
realized that the dragon city would seem so strange
and lifeless with all the dragons gone.
"Psst! Cimorene!"
Cimorene jumped. She whirled in the direction of
the voice, raising her lamp like a club, and Alianora
stepped out of the adjoining tunnel and into the circle
of light. In one hand she clutched a large bucket, three-
quarters full of soapy water, and she looked rather pale.
169

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"Alianora!" Cimorene said, lowering her arm,
"What are you doing out here?"
"Shhh!" Alianora said. She looked nervously over
her shoulder. "Woraug told me to scrub off the tab'e
in the banquet room while everyone was away. And--
and I heard someone moving around in there. Even
though everyone but us is gone. And I dropped the
lamp, and—"
"Oh, my goodness," Cimorene said. "The stone
prince! I'd forgotten all about him."
"Who?"
"The stone prince." Quickly, Cimorene explained
how she had found and hidden him the day before.
"And I hadn't thought about it until now, but this is
the perfect time to get him out of the mountains," she
finished. "All the dragons are gone and no one will
see him. Come on, before I forget again."
Alianora nodded dubiously, and the two girls
headed for the banquet room. When they arrived, Cim-
orene went in first, holding her lamp high. "Prince?"
she called. "Are you there? It's me, Cimorene."
"Yes, I'm here," said the stone prince, unfolding
stiffly from a gray lump in the comer. "I'm glad you're
back. Who's this you've brought with you?"
"Princess Alianora of the Duchy of Toure-on-
Marsh," Cimorene said. "She's the princess of the
dragon Woraug just now."
"Does her father need a great service done for
him?" the prince asked hopefully.
"Not that I know of," Cimorene replied. "Unless
you're good at getting rid of aunts, but that would be
more of a service to Alianora than to her father."
170
"I can think of nothing that would make me hap-
pier," the prince said with evident admiration as he
bowed stiffly to Alianora. "Good afternoon. Princess.
Or should it be 'good evening'? It's hard to tell without
windows."
Alianora blushed and looked down at her bucket
without answering.
"Actually, it's good morning," Cimorene told the
prince. "I'm sorry it took me so long to come back for
you, but ... well, a lot has been going on."
Alianora looked up sharply. "You've been sitting
here in the dark all night?" She shuddered. "You could
at least have left him a candle, Cimorene."
"Thank you for the thought. Princess Alianora, but
it's just as well she didn't," the stone prince said. "If

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
I'd been sitting here with a lit candle, they'd have no-
ticed me right away. And an unlit candle isn't much
use in the dark, is it?"
"What do you mean?" Cimorene said. "Who
would have noticed you?"
"The dragon and the two men he was talking to,"
replied the prince. "I think they were wizards."
"What?" said Cimorene and Alianora together.
"Well, they talked as if they were wizards," the
prince said. "They weren't carrying staffs, though."
"What did they look like?" Cimorene said.
"They were both tall, and they both had beards.
The older one's was gray and the younger one's was
brown."
"Antorell and Zemenar!" Cimorene said. "And
they were talking to a dragon?"
The stone prince nodded.
171
"Then they wouldn't have been carrying staffs.
Dragons are allergic to them. Did you hear what they
said?"
"Something about a contest," the stone prince said.
"The wizards were going to fix it so this dragon would
win. It sounded like a kind of cross-country race, and
the wizards were going to hide along the path and—
and help the dragon out somehow. I'm afraid I'm not
very clear about that part. Spells aren't my specialty.
I'm much better at hopeless causes."
Alianora and Cimorene exchanged appalled
glances.
"The trials with Colin's Stone to pick the new
King!" Alianora said.
"Which dragon?" Cimorene asked urgently. "Do
you know which dragon they were talking to?"
"I only heard the name once," the prince said. He
sounded apologetic and a little embarrassed. "And I
don't think I got it right. It's too silly."
"Tell us!" Cimorene commanded.
"Well, it sounded like 'warthog' " the prince said
in an even more apologetic tone than before.
"Could it have been Woraug?" Cimorene asked
"That's it!" the prince said. "I knew it couldn't
really have been warthog."
"What a pity you remembered," said a voice from
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (106 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
the entrance into the banquet hall.
Cimorene whirled. Antorell stood in the doorway,
staff in hand, watching them with an intolerably smug
expression.
172
13
In Which Alianora Discovers
an Unexpected Use for Soap and Water,
and Cimorene Has Difficulty
with a Dragon
Antorell looked past Cimorene and Alianora as if they
were not there and spoke directly to the stone prince.
"I told Father someone was listening. He won't be
happy when he finds out I was right, but he'll feel
better when I tell him I've taken care of things. He
might even let me have the first look in the King's
Crystal, once Woraug gives it to us."
"So that's what you're after!" Cimorene said.
Antorell favored her with a superior smile. "Quite
right. Princess Cimorene. The King's Crystal will show
us the whereabouts of every piece of useful and inter-
esting magic in the world. All we'll have to do is go
out and pick them up."
"Somehow I don't think it will be that easy," Cim-
orene murmured.
"We knew Tokoz would never give it to us, but
Woraug will, as soon as he's King of the Dragons. He'll
have to, or we'll tell everyone how we were the ones
who made sure he was the new king. Of course, we
can't afford to have anybody around who might make
... awkward revelations. I doubt that dragons will
listen to a couple of hysterical princesses, but he"—
Antorell pointed at the stone prince—"will have to go."
"What are you going to do?" Alianora demanded.
She was plainly frightened, and Cimorene could see
that her knuckles were white with the force of her grip
on the handle of the scrub bucket.
"Oh, gravel seems appropriate, don't you think?"
Antorell said. "No one will notice a few more rocks
around here."
"Ought I to be taking this person seriously?" the
stone prince said in a rather doubtful tone.
"You'd better if you don't want to end up as a lot
of little pebbles," Alianora answered. She still sounded
frightened, but she seemed to be getting a grip on
herself. "He's a wizard."
"You wouldn't be talking about gravel if you were
the one who had to sweep the floor," Cimorene said
to Antorell. She stepped forward as she spoke, hoping

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
to get between Antorell and the stone prince before
Antorell noticed what she was doing. She didn't think
Antorell was a good enough wizard to do any real
harm, but there was no point in taking chances.
"Stay where you are. Princess Cimorene," Antorell
commanded. "I'll deal with you in a moment."
174
"Must you be so theatrical?" Cimorene said.
"Theatrical? You think I'm being theatrical?" An-
torell said furiously. "I am simply showing a proper
respect for the importance of this moment!"
"You're showing off," Cimorene said flatly. "And
you're not doing it very well."
"He doesn't sound much like a wizard to me," the
stone prince said. "Is he always like this?"
"Enough!" Antorell cried, and raised his staff.
Light shimmered along its length and began to gather
at the lower end. Grinning wolfishly, the wizard tilted
the staff, aiming it toward the stone prince.
"Stop that!" Alianora said. Antorell ignored her.
"I said, stop it!" Alianora shouted, and threw her bucket
at Antorell's head.
Alianora's aim was off. The bucket hit Antorell's
shoulder. A bolt of fire shot from the end of his staff
and whizzed between Cimorene and the stone prince
to strike the far wall with a whumping noise and a
shower of sparks. Antorell staggered, slipped in the
cascade of soapy water, and fell over the bucket, drop-
ping his staff in the process.
Cimorene darted in and kicked Antorell's staff out
of his reach. He stared up at her from a mound of
soggy silk and soapsuds. "You can't do this to me!" he
shrieked.
Something in his voice made Cimorene and her
friends look at him more closely. Alianora's eyes went
wide, and Cimorene blinked in surprise. "He's—he's
collapsing," Alianora said in a stunned voice.
"He's melting," Cimorene corrected her.
"I can't be melting!" Antorell cried. "I'm a wizard!
i75
It's not fa—" His head disappeared into a small brown
puddle, and his cries stopped.
There was a moment of astonished silence. "I
thought it was witches who melt when you dump water
over them," the stone prince said at last.
"It is, usually," Cimorene said. "What on earth did
you put in that bucket, Alianora?"
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (108 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:41 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"Just water and soap, and a little lemon juice to
make it smell nicer," Alianora said.
"Um," said Cimorene, thinking hard. "I'll bet
there's a simpler way of melting wizards, but we don't
have time right now to figure out what it is. How many
buckets can you get hold of in a hurry?"
"Buckets?" Alianora said. "Two, counting this one.
And I suppose I could borrow one from Hallanna; that's
three."
"And I've got two in the kitchen, and I expect the
iron kettle is big enough. That's six altogether; two for
each of us. You will help, won't you?" Cimorene
added, turning to the stone prince.
"Of course," the prince assured her. "Help with
what?"
"Stopping those wizards," Cimorene said. "We
can't let them make Woraug the next King of the Drag-
ons by trickery."
"I don't see how we can stop them," Alianora said.
"We can't possibly get to the Ford of Whispering
Snakes before the trials start, and even if we could, we
don't know where the wizards will be hiding."
"If we tell the dragons that Woraug's trying to
cheat, they'll stop the trials," Cimorene said with more
176
confidence than she felt. "That will give us time to find
the wizards. And I've got a way to get us to the ford.
You go start collecting buckets. I'll meet you at your
place after I get the things I'll need from Kazul's."
"What about..." Alianora gestured with distaste
at the wet, messy lump of robes in the center of the
puddle that was all that remained of Antorell.
"We'll clean it up when we get back," Cimorene
said. "This is more important."
Alianora nodded, and the three left the banquet
room. The stone prince decided to accompany Alianora
since he was not a fast walker and Cimorene had farther
to go. Cimorene left them when they reached the main
tunnel and ran back to Kazul's cave. There she went
straight to her room and opened the drawer where she
kept odds and ends. In the back left-hand comer, care-
fully wrapped in a handkerchief, were the three black
feathers she had taken from beneath the left wing of
the bird she had killed in the Enchanted Forest. She
shoved the whole packet into her pocket without both-
ering to unwrap it and went on to the kitchen to collect
her buckets. Then she hurried through the tunnels to
Woraug's cave, where Alianora and the stone prince
were waiting.
When Cimorene arrived, she found the stone
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (109 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:42 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
prince pumping water to fill Alianora's third bucket
while Alianora mixed soap and lemon juice into the
second. Cimorene set her pots and pails next to the
pump and went to help Alianora.
"Now what?" Alianora said when all the buckets
were full of cleaning mixture.
177
Cimorene reached into her pocket and dug out the
package. Gently, she unfolded the handkerchief and
removed one of the feathers, noticing as she did that
the package also contained the pebble she had picked
up in the Caves of Fire and Night. "If we each take
two buckets, can we still link elbows without spilling
too much?" she asked.
Alianora and the stone prince looked at each other,
shrugged, and picked up two buckets each. Cimorene
took the last bucket and the iron pot, holding the handle
of the pot with only three fingers so that she could keep a
grip on the feather with her thumb and forefinger. A se-
ries of awkward maneuvers followed as Alianora and
the stone prince tried to link elbows with Cimorene
without losing their balance or dropping one of their
buckets. In the process, Cimorene's skirt got soaked.
"It's a good thing I'm not a wizard," Cimorene
said. "Ready? Here we go." She twisted her hand to-
ward the edge of the iron pot and let go of the black
feather. "I wish we were at the Ford of Whispering
Snakes," she said as the feather fell, and the room
dissolved around them.
They materialized at the very edge of a river, on a
flat, narrow rock that jutted out over the water, and
Alianora immediately slipped on the wet stone. If the
stone prince had not been so solid and heavy, all three
of them would have fallen into the river. As it was, it
took Cimorene and Alianora several seconds to regain
their balance. When she was finally sure of her footing,
Cimorene breathed a sigh of relief and quickly looked
about her.
178
The Ford of Whispering Snakes was crowded.
Dragons of all sizes and shades of green lined the banks
of the river and filled the spaces beneath the towering
trees of the Enchanted Forest. On the far bank, a pale
dragon was poring over a parchment list that Cimorene
thought she remembered seeing during one of the
many errands she had run the previous night. All the
dragons seemed to be talking at once, and none of them
noticed Cimorene and her friends.
"Hello, dragons!" Cimorene shouted, trying to
make herself heard above the noise.
"Here, now! What's all this?" an olive-green
dragon on the bank demanded, turning. "Someone's
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (110 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:42 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
trying to sneak a look at the trials."
"S-s-s-sneakssss," hissed a soft but nonetheless
dearly audible voice from somewhere near Cimorene's
feet. Cimorene jumped and looked down, but though
she craned her neck to see all around her, she could
not find the second speaker.
"Get rid of them before Troum comes back with
Colin's Stone," another dragon advised.
"We aren't trying to sneak in, and we don't care
about watching the trials," Cimorene said, wishing she
dared to look around for Kazul. "We came to warn you
about the wizards."
"Wiz-z-zardssss," the soft voice echoed.
"Wizards?" the olive-green dragon said skeptically.
"There aren't any wizards here."
"No, but they've figured out some way of inter-
fering with your choice of the next king," Cimorene
said. "They're hiding somewhere. You have to put off
179
the trials with Colin's Stone until we can find them and
stop them. If you'll just tell Kazul we're here—"
"Put off the trials?" the olive-green dragon inter-
rupted. "Impossible! They've been under way for half
an hour. We can't just stop in the middle. Who are all
you people, anyway?"
A flicker of motion caught Cimorene's eye, and she
looked down just in time to see a thin red snake dart
from one dump of weeds to the next. "S-s-s-sneaksss,"
whispered the soft voice an instant later. "S-s-sneaksss
and wiz-z-zardsss."
"I wasn't asking you," the dragon said severely in
the general direction of the snake. "And whatever they
are, they certainly aren't wizards."
"They look like somebody's princesses to me," a
blue-green dragon said. "Pity, that. It would be so
much simpler to eat them and get them out of the way."
"Are you sure?" said a third dragon. "The one on
the end doesn't look like a princess."
"I'm beginning to think this wasn't such a good
idea," the stone prince said.
"He may not be a princess, but he doesn't look
edible, either," the blue-green dragon pointed out.
"And these other two are definitely princesses. You
can't go eating them out of hand."
"Princesssessss," hissed the voice from under the
rock.

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"Oh, princesses," the olive-green dragon said. "No
wonder they're so full of wild tales."
"It's true!" Cimorene said desperately. "If you
don't believe us, take us to Kazul; she will."
180
"I can't do that!" the olive-green dragon said,
shocked. "Kazul's third in line now, after Mazarin and
Woraug. You can't talk to people who are that close to
making their attempt with the stone. It would distract
them."
"Woraug!" Alianora said. "Woraug's next in line?"
"Yes, he should be starting off any minute now,"
said the olive-green dragon. "Then comes Mazarin, and
then Kazul. I don't expect it will take long, though. No-
body's carried the stone for more than a mile or two yet."
"But I'm Kazul's princess!" Cimorene said.
"I don't care who you are," the dragon replied
crossly. "You can't talk to Kazul until she's done with
her turn."
"That will be too late!" Cimorene cried. "You don't
understand. Woraug and the wizards—"
"I've had enough of your wizards," the olive-green
dragon said. "You're a confounded nuisance, and you
ought not to be pushing your way in here where you're
not wanted. Go away!"
"Cimorene, what are we going to do?" Alianora
said as the olive-green dragon turned and stalked de-
tenninedly away.
"At hero's school we were always taught that if
you couldn't persuade anyone to help you with some-
thing, it meant that you were supposed to do it by
yourself," the stone prince said diffidently. "And we
are prepared." He lifted one of his buckets slightly.
"But we don't know where the wizards are." Al-
ianora said. "We have to find them before we can stop
them, and there isn't time."
i8i
"S-s-stop the wiz-z-zardsss," whispered the soft
voice.
"That's the first sensible thing you've said since
we got here," Cimorene said to the hissing whisper.
"Can't you just wish to be where the wizards are?"
the stone prince asked Cimorene.
"No, you have to know where you're going, or the
spell doesn't work," Cimorene said.
For a moment all three were glumly silent. Cim-
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (112 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:42 AM]

orene stared at the water, remembering how and where
she had gotten the feathers. Suddenly she raised her
head.
"We may not know where the wizards are, but I'll
bet I know someone who can find out. Hold this for a
minute."
Cimorene handed one of her buckets to Alianora,
then dug out the packet of feathers. She pulled the
second feather from the packet and grabbed Alianora's
elbow. "Hold tight, everybody. I wish we were at Mor-
wen's house," Cimorene said, and dropped the feather.
The scenery shifted abruptly, and they were stand-
ing on Morwen's porch. The house was just as tidy-
looking as Cimorene remembered, and the porch floor
gleamed as if it had just been washed. A black and
white cat, startled by their sudden appearance, fell off
the porch railing. Four others left off washing them-
selves to stare at Cimorene with unwinking green and
yellow eyes.
"I need to talk to Morwen," Cimorene said to the
cats. "It's an emergency."
A lean tiger-stripped cat rose and oozed through
182
a crack in the door. Cimorene unwound herself from
Alianora and the stone prince and set her bucket on
the porch floor. "I hope this works," she muttered to
herself as Alianora and the prince placed their buckets
beside hers.
183
14
In Which the Wizards Try to Make Trouble,
and Cimorene Does Something about It
the door of the cottage opened and Morwen stepped
out. "What sort of emergency?" she asked. She studied
Alianora and the stone prince for a moment, then
peered at Cimorene over the tops of her glasses and
added with some severity, "I hope you weren't refer-
ring to his predicament. He may well find it an incon-
venience, but it certainly isn't an emergency. Not by
my standards, anyway."
"No," said Cimorene, "I was talking about the
wizards. They've poisoned the King of the Dragons,
and now they're trying to interfere with Colin's Stone
so that Woraug will be the new king. We have to stop
them, but we don't know where they are, and Woraug's
184
going to try to carry the stone any minute. Can you
find them for us?"
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (113 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:42 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
Morwen blinked twice and shoved her glasses back
into place with her forefinger. "I see," she said. "You're
right. It's an emergency. I'll do what I can. But if you
don't tell me the whole story later, when there's a bit
more time, I shall—I shall turn you all into mice and
give you to the cats. Wait here."
As she spoke, Morwen disappeared into the house.
She reappeared a moment later, holding a small mirror
and muttering over it. "Colin's Stone," she said, and
breathed on the glass. She looked up. "Any wizard in
particular?"
"Zemenar, the Head Wizard of the Society of Wiz-
ards/' Cimorene said, wishing Morwen would go faster
and knowing she couldn't.
"I should have guessed," Morwen said. She turned
back to the mirror. "Zemenar," she said, and breathed
on the glass once more. Then she motioned to Cim-
orene to come and look.
Cimorene obeyed, and Alianora and the stone
prince crowded closely behind her. The mirror showed
a blurry, wavering picture of the Ford of Whispering
Snakes. As Cimorene watched, the picture moved
slowly along one bank of the river, past the waiting
dragons and the immense trees of the Enchanted Forest
and on down the river.
"Can't it go any faster?" Alianora whispered.
"There's no need to whisper, and no, it can't,"
Morwen said. "Not if you want to be sure of finding
these wizards of yours on the first try, and it doesn't
sound as if you have time to waste on mistakes."
185
The picture in the mirror continued to creep along
the bank. Cimorene pulled the third and last feather
out of her pocket and brushed it nervously across her
fingers while she waited.
"What's that?" the stone prince said suddenly.
The mirror-picture stopped, then moved up the
bank, away from the river toward a thicket of blackberry
brambles. Cimorene saw the tip of a wooden staff pok-
ing up above the thicket. Tensely, she waited for the
mirror to show the far side of the brambles.
"It's them!" Alianora said. She sounded frightened
and excited at the same time. "Oh, dear!"
Cimorene took a good look at the picture in the
mirror. Five wizards were standing in an opening be-
hind the blackberry thicket, leaning on their staffs and
looking at the sky. Suddenly, one of the wizards
pointed. The others peered upward, nodded, and
raised their staffs.
"Get the buckets!" Cimorene said. Cats scattered
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (114 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:42 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
in all directions as the stone prince pounded across the
porch behind Cimorene and Alianora. "Hang on; here
we go. I wish—"
"Not without me you—" Morwen said, grabbing
Cimorene's shoulder.
"—we were at the blackberry thicket where the
wizards are," Cimorene said, and dropped the feather.
"—don't," Morwen finished as the porch winked
out and was replaced by blackberries.
The five wizards were standing in an arc just in
front of the bramble. Each of them held his staff so that
the lower end was about a foot above the ground,
186
pointing at something hidden in the moss at their feet.
An unpleasant yellow-green light dripped from the
ends of the staffs, and the moss where the wizards
were standing was brown and dead. The wizards' backs
were toward Cimorene and her friends.
"Now!" Cimorene cried. As the wizards began to
turn, she set one of her buckets on the ground and
lifted the other in both hands. Taking careful aim, she
flung the soapy water over a black-haired wizard in the
center of the arc.
"Charge!" yelled the stone prince, and threw one
of his buckets at the nearest wizard.
"Take that, you cheats!" said Alianora, dumping
the first of her buckets over another.
"What—this is impossible!" said one of the wizards
indignantly as he began to melt.
"Too bad," Cimorene said, throwing her second
load of water at the next-to-last wizard.
"Watch where you're throwing that!" Morwen said
to the stone prince, who had sloshed his second bucket
over the fifth wizard with such enthusiasm that water
sprayed in all directions.
"Sorry," the prince apologized. "Is that all of
them?"
"It's all five of the ones we saw," Cimorene said
cautiously.
"Then we did it!" Alianora said.
"Not quite," said Zemenar, stepping out of the
bushes behind Morwen. "You interrupted the spell, of
course, but we were nearly finished anyway. And as
long as the stone remains enchanted, Woraug won't
187
have any trouble getting it all the way to the Vanishing
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (115 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:42 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
Mountain. Look." He pointed with his staff, and Cim-
orene saw three dragons, high in the air, flying steadily
toward the mountains. One of them had a long black
stone clutched in his claws, and the other two appeared
to be escorting him at a careful distance.
"Woraug and the two judges," Cimorene mur-
mured.
Zemenar nodded. "You might as well put that
bucket down," he went on, turning to Alianora. "You
can't throw it at me without melting your witch friend
here. What's in it, by the way?"
"I don't see why we should tell you," Cimorene
said as Alianora set the last of the six buckets down.
"Because I'm interested. Princess," Zemenar said
with an oily smile. "And it will pass the time until the
next shift gets here, and I can decide what to do with
you."
"If you're that interested, why don't you take a
closer look?" said the stone prince, picking up Al-
ianora's bucket.
"Stay where you are!" Zemenar commanded. As
he spoke, he raised his staff and sidestepped so that
Morwen was between him and the stone prince.
"If you insist," said the prince. He shrugged, lifted
the bucket, and flung the water over Morwen and Zem-
enar at the same time.
"What—no!" Zemenar cried in horror as he began
to melt. "Not soapsuds! It's demeaning."
"There's a little lemon juice in it, too," Alianora
offered.
188
Zemenar glared at her. He was less than half his
normal height and shrinking as they watched, while a
dark puddle spread out beneath him. "Lemon juice! Bah!
How dare you do such a thing? I'm the Head Wizard of the
Society of Wizards!" His voice grew fainter and higher
as he shrank. "Interfering busybodies! Soapsuds! Of all the
undignified tricks. You'll be sony for this! You can't melt a wizaid
forever, you know! You'll be sor . . ."
The wizard's voice ceased. All that remained of
him was a pile of silk robes and a long wooden staff
lying on some damp moss. Alianora and Cimorene
stared for a moment, then Alianora turned to the stone
prince.
"I'm glad he's gone," she said, "but how could
you melt Morwen just to get at that wizard?"
"But I didn't," the stone prince said. "Look."
Cimorene and Alianora turned. Morwen seemed
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (116 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:42 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
no shorter than usual, though she certainly looked very
damp. She had taken off her glasses and was shaking
water off them. "Don't just stand there," she said
crossly to Cimorene. "Hand me a dry handkerchief."
"Just a minute," Cimorene said, checking her pock-
ets. She found the handkerchief that had been wrapped
around the magic feathers and handed it to Morwen.
"Um, why didn't you melt?"
"Clean living," Morwen said as she began to dry
her glasses on Cimorene's handkerchief.
"I thought as much," the stone prince said in
a satisfied tone. "Nobody who lives in a house as
clean as yours could possibly melt in a bucket of soap-
suds."
189
"Quite right," Morwen said approvingly. "You
have a good head on your shoulders, young man.
What's this?" She held up a sharp-edged black pebble.
"It's a piece of stone I found in the Caves of Fire
and Night," Cimorene said.
"Where, exactly?"
"In the King's Cave," Cimorene said. "Morwen,
shouldn't we do something about that spell Zemenar
mentioned?"
Alianora was watching the sky, shading her eyes
with her hand. "Woraug's nearly halfway to the moun-
tain," she said anxiously.
"Good," said Morwen, though neither Cimorene
nor Alianora could tell which of them she was talking
to. The witch shook her wet robes and walked over to
the patch of dead moss where the wizards had been
working, picking her way carefully past little piles of
robes and staffs. Cimorene followed. In the center of
the brown area was a black stone the size of Cimorene's
fist. A web of yellow-green light flickered across its
smooth surface.
"Sloppy," Morwen said. "Very sloppy. Though
I'm not surprised. Wizards always seem to depend on
brute force when a little subtlety would be far more
effective." She fingered Cimorene's pebble for a mo-
ment, then reached out and dropped it on top of the
wizards' stone.
There was a noise like a great deal of popcorn all
popping at once, and the light that flickered over the
black stone spat yellow-green sparks in all directions.
Alianora jumped and backed away. Cimorene would
190
have liked to do the same, but she did not want to give
Morwen a bad impression of her courage, so she stayed
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (117 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:42 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
where she was.
The sparks died, and the flickering light went out.
From the sky high above came a faint shriek of surprise
and rage. Cimorene looked up and saw three black
specks in the sky. No, not three: four, and the two
escort dragons were swooping to catch the speck that
was Colin's Stone, which Woraug had just dropped.
Cimorene gave a sigh of relief and looked at Mor-
wen. "So much for Woraug and the wizards," she said.
"We didn't even need the fireproofing spell. What did
you do?"
"And what happens now?" Alianora added.
"Duck," said Morwen, and threw herself sideways
into the bushes.
"Wha—" said the stone prince, and then he and
Cimorene and Alianora were engulfed by a blast of
dragon fire.
The stone prince leaped in front of the two prin-
cesses, but he was much too late to protect them. For-
tunately the fireproofing spell was still in effect, and
neither of them even felt warm, though Alianora lost
the ends of her sleeves and Cimorene's hemline rose
six scorched inches.
"I knew I shouldn't have said that about the fire-
proofing spell," Cimorene muttered,
With a wordless snarl and a thunder of wings,
Woraug landed just in front of the little group.
"You!" he shouted when he saw Cimorene. "I
might have known it would be you!" Flame shot from
191
his mouth once more, but it was just as useless as it
had been the first time.
Cimorene glanced up and saw one of the escort
dragons spiraling down to see what was going on. "You
might as well give up, Woraug," she said, hoping to
distract the angry dragon long enough for help to ar-
rive. "You can't be King of the Dragons now."
"I'll tear you limb from limb!" Woraug raged.
"Every last one of you!" One arm shot out as he spoke,
and shining silver claws snapped around the stone
prince's waist.
Alianora screamed.
"Hurry up!" Cimorene shouted at the dragon in
the sky.
The dragon heard and dove toward them, but he
was not fast enough. Woraug shoved the stone prince
into his mouth and bit down hard. An instant later he

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
howled in pain and spat out the prince and four teeth.
"What is all this?" said the escort dragon, landing
carefully beside Woraug. The clearing was getting
rather crowded.
"A plot to cheat on the test to see who the next
King of the Dragons will be," Cimorene said. "Woraug
was in it, and a lot of wizards."
"Are you all right?" Alianora asked the stone
prince, who was just picking himself up. His stone was
black in places from the dragon fire, but otherwise he
seemed unhurt.
"More or less," the stone prince said. "But just
look what that fire did to my clothes! And that dragon's
put a chip in my sleeve. What am I supposed to do
192
about that? It's not as if I can just change clothes when
I get home, you know."
"That's ridiculous!" the escort dragon told Cimo-
rene. "No dragon would cooperate with wizards. I
don't see any wizards, either. I think you're making it
up."
"Of course you don't see any wizards," Cimorene
said, feeling very cross. "We melted them."
"Melted them?"
"Where do you think those staffs came from?"
Cimorene pointed at the wizards' staffs lying across the
scattered brown puddles.
The dragon backed up a pace and sniffed experi-
mentally.
"It's all quite true," Morwen said, poking her head
out of the bushes. "And we'll be more than happy to
explain the whole thing to your new King as soon as
you have one. Provided, of course, that you take that
maniac away before he burns the whole Enchanted
Forest to the ground." She gestured at Woraug. "Cim-
orene, I really must insist on getting a copy of that
fireproofing spell. It will clearly be worth every minute
of the months of hunting it will take me to find some
hens' teeth, and I may as well get started as soon as I
can."
"Who's that?" said the escort dragon. "Morwen?
That does it! This is too much for me. I'm taking you
all into custody until the trials are over and the King
can sort it out. Come along."
"I assume that doesn't apply to me," Woraug rum-
bled. He winced as he spoke.
193

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"It certainly does," the escort dragon said. "I said
all, and I meant all. If I'd meant 'all the humans/ I'd
have said 'all the humans/ or maybe 'some of you' or
'you over there' or 'all you non-dragons' or—"
"Nonsense!" Woraug interrupted. "Don't you
know who I am?"
"You're the dragon who caused a ruckus just now
for no reason I can see," the escort dragon replied.
"And it's my duty and my job to take you into custody.
When the trials are over, you can explain it to the King,
and if I've done something wrong, well, I'll take what
I have coming. And if I haven't, you'll take yours.
And—"
"All right, all right," Woraug said. "But I warn
you, you'll regret this."
"That's as may be," the escort dragon said with
dignity. "Right now, though, you're in custody along
with the rest of these people, and you'd better not go
snacking on any of them until things are sorted out. I
saw what you did to the gray one."
"Did you?" said the stone prince. "Then what are
you going to do about this chip in my sleeve?"
"Tell it to the King," the escort dragon advised.
"Now, off we go, the lot of you."
Morwen came cautiously out of the bushes, brush-
ing leaves from her already wet black robes. She
stopped and peered at the escort dragon over the tops
of her glasses. "This has not been a good day for any-
one's clothes," she said severely. "I shall send the
cleaning bill to your king."
"Whatever you want," the escort dragon said im-
patiently. "Come on."
194
Scowling furiously, Woraug marched off into the
forest. The stone prince and Alianora followed, talking
in low voices. Morwen paused to pick up the wizards'
black rock and Cimorene's pebble, then went on after
them. Cimorene hesitated.
"Go on," said the escort dragon.
"I will, but I think you ought to know that another
batch of wizards is supposed to show up soon," Cim-
orene said. "Zemenar said something about a second
shift. I don't know what they can do without the stone
they were using, but I'm sure they'll try something."
"Wizards always do," the escort dragon said with
a sigh. He studied the wizards' staffs that were lying
around the clearing with a melancholy air. "All right,
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (120 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:42 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
I'll send someone back to keep an eye on things as soon
as we get to the ford. Whatever was going on here,
there certainly were wizards in it, and that's enough
for me."
"Good," said Cimorene. "And thank you." She
smiled at the startled expression on the dragon's face
and started after the others.
15
In Which the Dragons Crown a New King,
and Cimorene Gets a New Job
the walk to the Ford of Whispering Snakes took longer
than Cimorene expected. The trees of the Enchanted
Forest grew dose together in many places, fordng the
dragons to take a zigzag path instead of heading
straight up the bank of the river. Woraug, who was in
the lead, seemed to be deliberately setting a slow pace.
Cimorene was sure he was hoping that the second shift
of wizards would arrive at the blackberry clearing be-
fore the dragons at the ford had been warned. She had
no idea what would happen then, but she doubted that
it would be good. The escort dragon was not interested
in Cimorene's worries, however, and he refused to
speed things up, so the group ambled on.
196
As they approached the ford at last, they heard
cheering ahead of them. Woraug flinched visibly, and
Alianora and the stone prince were startled out of their
quiet conversation.
"What's that?" Alianora said.
"Sounds to me as if we have a new King," their
escort said with great satisfaction. "That means I can
get you lot off my hands right away. What a relief! I
thought I was going to be stuck with you for hours."
Alianora looked faintly indignant at this unflatter-
ing opinion. Morwen was merely amused. Woraug's
wings sagged momentarily, but then he -seemed to pull
himself back together, and he continued on as confi-
dently as ever. Cimorene's concern deepened. What if
Woraug managed to convince the new King that they
were all lying?
They reached the edge of the cheering crowd of
dragons. "Who did it?" the escort dragon asked.
"Who's the new King?"
"How should I know?" the other responded. "I
can't see a thing from way out here."
"You'll find out soon enough, " the escort dragon
said. Then he raised his voice and shouted, "Make way!
Coming through! Prisoners for the King! Make way!"
The crowd of dragons parted reluctantly, and the
escort dragon herded the group forward, still shouting.
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (121 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:42 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
They made their way through the cheering dragons
until they reached the edge of the river. "Stand away!"
shouted someone in the crowd. "Stand away for the
King!"
The nearby dragons drew back, leaving Woraug,
ip7
the escort dragon, and Cimorene and her friends stand-
ing by themselves on the trampled moss. As the drag-
ons moved away, Cimorene caught sight of Kazul, lying
comfortably beside the river. "Kazul!" Cimorene cried,
and ran forward. "Are you all right?"
A mottled dragon standing beside Kazul shifted
and flicked his tail angrily at Cimorene. "You should
say 'Your Majesty,' " he said with a warning scowl.
"Don't be ridiculous, Frax. She's my princess," Ka-
zul said. "I'm quite all right, Cimorene. What are you
doing here?"
"You're the new King of the Dragons?" Cimorene
said in astonishment. "But—but when you left this
morning, you could barely fly! How did you get Colin's
Stone all the way from here to the Vanishing
Mountain?"
"Colin's Stone apparently does more than merely
pick out the right King," Kazul said. "The minute I
picked it up, I felt fine."
"This is impossible!" Woraug said.
"Are you accusing me of fraud?" Kazul asked
mildly.
"He'd better not," Cimorene said. "He's the one
who was cheating, with the help of Zemenar and the
rest of the wizards."
"Really," Kazul said in tones of great interest.
"It's all nonsense," Woraug declared. "The girl's
just trying to attract attention."
"Really," Kazul said again, and smiled, displaying
all her silver teeth.
"Oh, come now, Kazul. Surely you won't take a
mere princess's word over mine," Woraug said.
198
"That depends entirely on what she says. Tell us
about it. Princess," Kazul commanded.
So Cimorene told them. She brought the stone
prince forward to explain what he had overheard the
wizards and Woraug discussing in the banquet hall,
and she made Alianora tell everyone about melting
wizards with wash water and lemon juice. She told
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (122 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:42 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
about getting to the Ford of Whispering Snakes on the
first feather and being unable to convince any of the
dragons to listen to her. She told about going to Mor-
wen's house to find out where the wizards were, and
about,using the last feather to get to the wizards and
melt them. She described Zemenar's unexpected ap-
pearance and subsequent melting, and the way Mor-
wen had broken the wizards' spell, and she finished
with an account of Woraug's futile attack.
"And then he landed"—Cimorene waved in the
direction of the escort dragon—"and decided to bring
us all back here. And I think somebody ought to go
back to that clearing where the blackberries are be-
fore the next batch of wizards arrives. I don't know
what they'll do when they find out what's happened,
but ..."
"Yes, I see," said Kazul. She turned to a pale green
dragon beside her. "Take five or six of the younger
dragons—the ones who've been talking about starting
a wizard-hunt—and go have a look at this blackberry
clearing."
"Yes, Your Majesty," said the pale dragon with a
fierce grin.
"Surely you don't believe this!" Woraug said.
Kazul stared at Woraug without saying anything,
199
and the dragons around the edge of the circle rattled
their scales.
"Ah—Your Majesty," Woraug added hastily.
"Why should I disbelieve it?" Kazul said, still
watching Woraug.
"The whole thing is preposterous!" Woraug said.
"How could wizards do anything to affect Colin's
Stone? Your Majesty."
Kazul looked at Cimorene.
"I'm sorry, Kazul," Cimorene said, shaking her
head. "I know what the wizards were trying to do, but
I don't have the slightest idea how they were doing it."
"I believe I can explain that. Your Majesty," Mor-
wen said. She stepped forward, tossing and catching
the wizards' black rock casually in her right hand.
"They were using this. I believe you'll find that it comes
from the Caves of Fire and Night. From the King's
Cave, in fact, where Colin's Stone was found. And one
of the properties of the Caves of Fire and Night is that
you can use one piece to cast spells which affect similar
pieces."
"Just the way that impossible book says!" Cim-
orene exclaimed.
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (123 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:42 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"DeMontmorency? Yes, I suppose he is fairly im-
possible," Morwen said.
"Is this sufficiently similar to Colin's Stone that the
wizards could have affected the stone through it?" Ka-
zul asked.
"Certainly, Your Majesty," Morwen said.
"This is—" Woraug began.
"—ridiculous, impossible, and unbelievable," Ka-
200
zul said. "You've said that already. But I haven't heard
you say anything particularly convincing in support of
that attitude."
"Oh, really. Your Majesty!" Woraug said. "Next
you'll be saying I poisoned King Tokoz!"
"It doesn't seem likely," Kazul admitted, "since
Tokoz was poisoned with dragonsbane, and dragons
can't get anywhere near the stuff without feeling the
effects."
"What if Zemenar made a ... a dragonsbane-proof
packet for him to cany it in?" Cimorene said, thinking
of the bag Antorell had been carrying when she and
Alianora met him in the valley. "Something that would
melt when he dropped it in the King's coffee."
"I suppose it's possible," Kazul said. "But there's
no evidence at all that Zemenar did any such thing."
"What would it have looked like?" Alianora asked
suddenly. "Would it have been something like a very
large tea bag?"
Everyone turned to look at Alianora. "I think that
would have worked quite well. Princess," Kazul said.
"Why do you ask?"
"Because Woraug had something like that with him
when he went to see King Tokoz the night before the
King was killed," Alianora said. "I saw it."
An angry muttering ran through the crowd of
dragons.
"Lies!" Woraug snarled. "They're all lies!"
"Are they?" Kazul said coldly. "I don't think so.
You must have wanted to be King very badly indeed."
"I—" Woraug darted a glance around the circle of
201
dragons. What he saw did not appear to reassure him.
"No!"
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (124 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:42 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"Consorting with wizards, killing the King, and
plotting to cheat in the trials with Colin's Stone," Kazul
said as if Woraug had not spoken. "Hardly proper be-
havior for a dragon."
The crowd muttered agreement. Cimorene looked
from Woraug to Kazul and back. Woraug appeared to
be terrified of something, but Cimorene could not tell
what it was. He crouched and seemed to shrink away
from Kazul, drawing his wings in close and making
himself as small as possible. Cimorene blinked. It was
remarkable how much smaller Woraug could make
himself look. In fact . . .
"He's shrinking!" Cimorene exclaimed.
"No!" Woraug cried again, but it was much too
late. He shrank faster and faster, his wings melting into
ridges along his back and his claws retracting. He was
barely as tall as Cimorene's shoulder. Then, with a
sudden shiver, he collapsed in on himself. A small rain
of scales pattered to the ground. A moment later, an
extremely warty toad with angry red eyes crawled
clumsily out of the center of the pile.
"Is that—is that Woraug?" Alianora asked in a
hushed tone.
The toad turned and glared at her, and she stepped
back a pace. The stone prince put a protective arm
around Alianora's shoulders and glared back at the
toad.
"Behave, or I'll step on you," he said.
"Yes, it's Woraug," Kazul said. She sounded al-
202
most sad. "That's what happens when a dragon stops
acting like a dragon."
The toad turned his glare in Kazul's direction, then
hopped off and disappeared among the stones along
the riverbank.
Alianora shuddered. Kazul studied her for a mo-
ment. "You were Woraug's princess, weren't you? I'm
sorry about all this, but it couldn't be helped. It won't
take long to find you another dragon."
"I don't think you have to worry about finding her
another dragon," Cimorene said. She had been watch-
ing Alianora and the stone prince, and an idea had
occurred to her.
"What? Why not?" said Kazul.
"Because the stone prince fought with Woraug,
and Woraug certainly didn't win. Doesn't that mean
that he gets to rescue Woraug's princess?"
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (125 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:42 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"I'm not sure the rules cover this situation at all,"
Kazul said. "But it sounds reasonable enough, and un-
der the circumstances I doubt that anyone will object.
Unless of course she does."
"Oh!" said Alianora, and blushed a rosy red. "No,
I don't object at all!"
"Are you sure?" the stone prince said anxiously.
"You won't mind waiting a while to marry me? I mean,
if you're willing to marry me? You needn't, you know,
if the idea doesn't appeal to you."
"It appeals to me very much," Alianora said, blush-
ing redder than ever. "But why do you say that we
have to wait?"
The stone prince sighed. "I still have to find a king
203
and do him a great service, and that's bound to take a
while."
"For a young man as intelligent as you seem to
be, you're remarkably foolish," Morwen commented.
"What on earth do you think you've just done?"
An expression of astonishment spread across the
prince's face. "You mean the king I was supposed to
serve is the King of the Dragons?"
"Exactly," Morwen said. "And I doubt that you
could do her a greater service than saving the throne
from Woraug's plotting."
"That's settled, then," Kazul said. "Let's get the
rest of the ceremonies finished and get back to the
mountains. There's a great deal of work to be done."
The dragons all bowed, and eddies of movement
began in various sections of the crowd. Shortly, two
dragons came forward carrying Colin's Stone. It looked
like a long black log about three times as thick as Cim-
orene's waist and twice as tall as she was. The dragons
laid it in front of Kazul and backed away. Another
dragon appeared, holding a large circlet made of iron,
'with six spikes poking upward at intervals around the
rim. Kazul set her front feet on the black stone, and
the dragon set the circlet on her head. The crowd of
dragons began cheering again, and after a few minutes
they began forming a line to congratulate their new
King and present their coronation gifts. Other dragons
set up large tubs of wine and platters of meat and
cheese, which were quickly surrounded.
In the middle of the presentations, the dragons
Kazul had sent off to the blackberry clearing returned,
204
and Kazul took a short break from accepting congrat-
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (126 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:42 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
ulations to hear what they had to say.
"The wizards showed up before we'd been there
more than ten minutes. Your Majesty," said the pale
green dragon who was the leader of the group. "Six of
them, just like your princess said."
"They weren't happy to see us," the youngest
dragon said smugly.
"I would think not." Kazul smiled. "What did you
do with them?"
"We chased five of them away," the pale dragon
reported. "I don't think they'll be back, either."
"Five?"
The pale dragon shot a glance at the youngest of
the group, who licked his lips and looked even more
smug than before and said nothing. "Yes, Your
Majesty."
"I see. Well, that's more than enough evidence to
confirm what Cimorene's told us," Kazul commented.
She raised her voice. "The arrangement between the
dragons and the Society of Wizards is hereby canceled.
From now on, wizards will not be allowed anywhere
near the Caves of Fire and Night, no matter what they
say." Then she went back to accepting presents and
congratulations from her new subjects.
Cimorene watched the festivities with mixed feelings.
She was very glad that Kazul was the new King of the
Dragons, but she couldn't help wondering what effect
Kazul's coronation would have on her own position.
The King of the Dragons certainly wouldn't need a
princess as a mark of status, and there would be plenty
of younger dragons eager to cook and clean for their
King, if only as a way of getting a start at the court.
Her preoccupation stayed with her for the rest of
the day, through the entire coronation picnic and the
flight back to the Mountains of Morning. Cimorene and
Alianora rode on the back of a very large dragon whose
scales were such a dark green that they looked almost
black. Alianora would have preferred to ride with the
stone prince, but none of the dragons were willing to
take on a second passenger if the stone prince was the
first. All of the dragons had paid their respects to Kazul
at the coronation, so the cave was empty when the
dragon dropped Cimorene off. When Cimorene said
good-bye to Alianora, she promised to come over and
help her pack the following morning. Then she went
in and waited for Kazul to come home.
Kazul did not arrive until very late. She was stiil
wearing the iron crown, and she looked very tired.
"Thank goodness that's over," she said, taking the
crown off and throwing it across the cave. It hit the
wall and bounced off with a harsh clang.
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (127 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:42 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
"You shouldn't treat your crown like that. Your
Majesty," Cimorene said, retrieving the iron circlet.
"Of course I should," Kazul said. "It's expected.
That's why we made it out of iron instead of something
soft and bendable. And don't start calling me 'Your
Majesty.' I've had enough of that for one day."
Cimorene began to feel a little better. "What hap-
pens next?"
"Tomorrow we start moving," Kazul said and
sighed. "It will probably take weeks. It's too bad there's
206
no way of warning a new king in time to pack every-
thing up before the work starts."
"Everything?" Cimorene said in tones of dismay.
"Even the library and the treasure vaults? But I've only
just got them organized!"
"Everything," Kazul said. "And if you think
straightening out things here was difficult, wait until
you see the mess the official vaults are in."
"Oh, dear," said Cimorene. "Is it very bad?"
Kazul nodded. "I've just come from looking at it.
You'll see for yourself tomorrow. There's a smallish
cave next to the library that I think will do nicely for
you, but I'd like you to look at it before we start hauling
things around."
"You mean you want me to stay?" Cimorene
blurted. "But I thought the King of the Dragons didn't
need a princess!"
"Don't be ridiculous," Kazul said. "How am I
going to get my cherries jubilee if you don't stay? And
you haven't even started cataloguing the library, and
how else am I going to get the King's treasure vaults
arranged so I can find things? I'm not going to have
time to do it."
"Won't the rest of the dragons object?"
Kazul snorted. "I'm the King. One of the advan-
tages of being King is that nobody objects to whims like
keeping a princess when you're not supposed to need
one. If it bothers you, we'll give you a different title:
King's Cook and Librarian, maybe. Stop worrying and
go to sleep. Tomorrow is going to be a very busy day
for both of us."
Cimorene smiled and went off to her rooms with
307
a light heart. She slept soundly and was up early next
morning. Kazul was already awake and supervising
file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20...rest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt (128 of 131) [2/17/2004 11:16:42 AM]

file:///G|/rah/Patricia%20C.%20Wrede%20-%20Enchanted%20Forest%202%20-%20Dealing%20with%20Dragons.txt
three of the younger dragons, who were packing up
the treasure and the library. Since Cimorene was
pressed into service at once, it was several hours before
she could get away to keep her promise to Alianora.
"I'm sorry I'm late," Cimorene apologized when
she arrived at Woraug's cave at last. "But it didn't occur
to me that Kazul would be moving, too, and she wanted
me to help."
"It's all right," Alianora assured her. "It wasn't as
big a job as I'd expected, and the prince helped. I'm
almost finished." She gestured at an almost-full suitcase
lying open on the floor. On the other side of the room,
the stone prince was stacking the empty drawers from
Alianora's bureau.
"Well, at least I got here in time to say good-bye,"
Cimorene said.
"You're staying with the dragons, then?" the stone
prince asked, straightening with a frown. "Are you sure
you want to do that?"
"Of course she's sure," Alianora said. "Kazul's
going to need her even more than she did before, and
Cimorene wouldn't be happy in a normal kingdom."
"How did you know that?" Cimorene said, staring
at Alianora.
"It's obvious. Linderwall is about as normal a king-
dom as you can get. If you ran away from there, you
certainly wouldn't be happy anywhere like it."
"I didn't mean that part," Cimorene said, redden-
ing slightly. "I meant about Kazul wanting me to stay."
"That was obvious, too," Alianora said. "You're

the only one who was worried about it." She studied
Cimorene for a minute and shook her head. "I wouldn't
like being princess for the King of the Dragons, but it
will suit you down to the ground."
"I think it will," Cimorene said, smiling.
"Then maybe you can tell me something," the
stone prince said. "What's being done about the wiz-
ards?"
"They've been banned from the Mountains of
Morning, and there are a hundred or so dragons out
checking to make sure they've gone," Cimorene re-
plied. "They haven't had much luck, I'm afraid. Most
of the wizards left after the first few got eaten."
"That's all?" asked the prince.
"What else can the dragons do? The wizards didn't
actually poison King Tokoz; Woraug did that. So there's
no justification for an all-out attack on the headquarters

of the Society of Wizards, even if all the dragons agreed
that they wanted to do it. Which they don't."
"I suppose you're right," the prince said. "But
you'd better tell Kazul to keep a close eye on them.
Those wizards will make more trouble just as soon as
they figure out a way to do it."
"I don't know about that," Cimorene said. "I think
Zemenar was behind most of it, and you melted him."
"That's it!" Alianora said, and snapped her fingers.
"I almost forgot to tell you. Morwen and I talked for a
long time yesterday, and she says that melting a wizard
isn't permanent."
"You mean they'll all come back?" Cimorene
asked.
Alianora nodded. "It will take them a while,
209
though. And Morwen said for you to come and visit
soon. She thinks that in a few days she'll have figured
out a way of melting wizards without dumping soapy
water over them. 'A method that's a little less sloppy'
was the way she put it."
"That will be useful if the wizards start making
trouble again," Cimorene said thoughtfully.
"Is this everything, Alianora?" the stone prince
asked, gesturing at the suitcase.
"Yes, I think so." Alianora pulled the top of the
suitcase over, and the stone prince set one foot very
gently in the middle of it and pushed until the latch
clicked.
"Where are you going first?" Cimorene asked. "His
kingdom or yours?"
"Neither," Alianora said, smiling. "We're going to
Morwen's. She said she could change him back from
stone to normal. We asked Kazul last night if we could
go out through the Caves of Fire and Night, and she
said yes, so ..."
"I don't know, Alianora," the stone prince said.
"I'm beginning to get used to myself this way. And
there are certain advantages."
"There are disadvantages, too," Alianora said,
blushing slightly.
Cimorene began to giggle.
Alianora's blush deepened. "I mean—uh—how are
you going to get rid of that chip in your sleeve if you
can't change clothes?"
"I think I see what you're getting at," the stone

prince replied, eyeing Alianora meditatively. "And
210
you're quite right. There's no comparison. We had bet-
ter see Morwen as quickly as possible."
Alianora and Cimorene looked at each other and
burst into unstoppable giggles.
The stone prince blinked at them. "It's not funny!"
he said indignantly, which only made them giggle
harder. Shaking his head, he waited for them to stop,
then picked up Alianora's suitcase. "Shall we go?"
Cimorene walked with them to the iron gate that
led into the Caves of Fire and Night. A purplish dragon
was waiting to guide them through the caves. Kazul
was taking no chances on Alianora and the stone prince
getting lost. Cimorene hugged them both and wished
them a safe journey.
"And I hope you both live happily ever after!"
"I hope you do, too!" Alianora called back as she
and the stone prince followed the dragon through the
gate.
Cimorene watched until they were out of sight,
then started back toward Kazul's cave. She thought
about Morwen, and the wizard-melting spell, and about
Zemenar and Antorell and the other wizards who
would somehow be back soon. She thought about Ka-
zul, and about straightening out the treasure vaults that
belonged to the King of the Dragons, and about all the
hundreds of books in the King's library, and of all the
problems that the King of the Dragons would have to
deal with. She thought about Alianora's last words and
smiled.
Happily ever after? Cimorene wasn't sure about that,
though she was certainly hoping to enjoy herself. She
211
was positive, however, that life with the dragons woud
be interesting and busy, and in Cimorene's opinion that
would go a long way toward making her happy.
"Happily ever after? I don't think it's quite what
you meant, Alianora," Cimorene murmured to the
empty tunnel, "but one way or another, I rather think
I will."
