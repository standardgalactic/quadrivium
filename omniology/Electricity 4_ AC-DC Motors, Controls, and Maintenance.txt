PREFACE
The tenth edition of Electricity 4 has been updated to provide more information and better 
flow of concepts. New material and artwork have been added to better reflect the current 
workplace. At the same time, the text has retained the features and style of previous editions 
that have made it so popular.
The text introduces the concepts of AC and DC motors, and the associated controls 
and maintenance of this equipment. The material is broken down into short segments that 
concentrate on specific concepts or application of particular types of equipment. The detailed 
explanations are written in easy-to-understand language that concisely presents the required 
knowledge. Many illustrations and photographs help provide technical understanding and 
provide real-world references. This type of explanation and application better prepares the 
student to perform effectively on the job in installing, troubleshooting, repairing, and servicing 
electrical motors and controls.
The knowledge obtained in this book permits the student to progress further in the study 
of electrical systems. The study of electricity and the application of electrical products are con-
tinually changing. The electrical industry constantly introduces new and improved devices and 
material, which in turn lead to changes in installing and operating equipment. Electrical codes 
also change to reflect the industry needs. It is essential that students continue to learn and 
update their knowledge of current procedures and practices.
The text is easy to read and the units have been grouped by general topics. Summaries of 
each unit provide an opportunity to restate the most important topics of the unit. Summary 
Reviews of the units reemphasize topic groups.
Each unit begins with learning objectives. An Achievement Review at the end of each unit 
provides an opportunity for readers to check their understanding of the material in small incre-
ments before proceeding. Some of the problems in the text require the use of simple algebra, 
and the student should be familiar with the math before trying to solve the equations. It is also 
essential that the reader have a basic understanding of the fundamentals of electrical circuits 
and electrical concepts.
It is recommended that the most recent edition of the National Electrical Code® (published 
by the National Fire Protection Association) be available for reference and use as the learner

The production of electrical energy and its conversion to mechanical energy in electric 
motors of all types is the basis of industrial productivity. Very basic DC motor principles are 
given in Electricity 1.
CONSTRUCTION FEATURES
Conventional DC motors closely resemble DC generators in construction features. In fact, it is dif-
ficult to identify them by appearance alone. A motor has the same two main parts as a  generator—
the field structure and the armature assembly consisting of the armature core, armature winding, 
commutator, and brushes. Some general features of a DC motor are shown in Figure 1–1.

The Field Structure
The field structure of a motor has at least two pairs of field poles, although motors with four 
pairs of field poles are also used, as shown in Figure 1–2(A). A strong magnetic field is  provided 
by the field windings of the individual field poles. The magnetic polarity of the field system 
is arranged so that the polarity of any particular field pole is opposite to that of the poles 
 adjacent to it.
The Armature
The armature of a motor is a cylindrical iron structure mounted directly on the motor shaft, as 
shown in Figure 1–2(B). In DC motors, the armature is the rotating component of the motor. 
Armature windings are embedded in slots in the surface of the armature and terminate in seg-
ments of the commutator. Current is fed to these windings on the rotating armature by carbon 
brushes that press against the commutator segments. This current in the armature windings sets 
up a magnetic field in the armature that reacts with the magnetic field of the field poles. These 
magnetic effects are used to develop torque, which causes the armature to turn (Figure 1–3). 
The commutator changes the direction of the current in the armature conductors as they pass 
across poles of opposite magnetic polarity. Continuous rotation in one direction results from 
these reversals in the armature current.

Figure 1–4 shows a cutaway view of a DC motor available with horsepower ratings  ranging 
from 25.0 hp to 1000 hp.
By using the right-hand rule for motors, as illustrated in Figure 1–5, you can determine 
which direction a current-carrying conductor will move when placed in a magnetic field. This 
is the principle of all motor action. The first finger represents the direction of the stator flux, as 
magnetic lines travel north to south. The center finger represents the direction of the electron 
current in the conductor placed within the magnetic field. The thumb represents the thrust of 
the conductor as it tries to move out of the magnetic field. As shown in Figure 1–3, the coils of 
the armature are spaced around the rotor, and the rotor conductors are connected to the com-
mutator segments. Because the coils of wire on the armature (rotor) have current flow through 
them, the magnetic field thus created in the rotor conductors reacts with the stationary field 
(stator), and the conductors will move according to the right-hand rule for motors. The con-
ductors of the rotor that are directly adjacent to the stator pole pieces have the maximum rotor 
current and therefore the most magnetic interaction with the main magnetic poles.

TYPES OF DC MOTORS
Shunt, series, compound, and permanent magnet motors are all widely used. The schematic 
diagrams for each type of motor are shown in Figure 1–6. The selection of the type of motor 
to use is based on the mechanical requirements of the applied load. A shunt motor has the field

circuit connected in shunt (parallel) with the armature, whereas a series motor has the armature 
and field circuits in series. A compound motor has both a shunt and a series field winding. A 
permanent magnet motor only has armature connections.
MOTOR RATINGS
DC motors are rated by their voltage, current, speed, and horsepower output. The number and 
methods of connection for the armature and field also dictate motor operating characteristics.
TORQUE
The rotating force at the motor shaft produced by the interaction of the magnetic fields of the 
armature and the field poles is called torque. As the magnitude of the torque increases, the twist-
ing force of the shaft increases. Torque is defined as the product of the force in pounds and the 
radius of the shaft or pulley in feet.

For example, a motor that produces a tangential force of 120 pounds at the surface of the 
shaft 2 in. in diameter or 1 in. in radius has a torque of 10 foot-pounds (ft-lbs).
Torque = Force × Radius
= 120 lbs × 1/12 ft = 10 ft-lbs
Torque in a motor depends on the magnetic strengths of the field and the armature. 
The torque increases along with the armature current and, consequently, the strength of the 
armature magnetic field increases.
Another example is shown in Figure 1–7. If a V-belt drive has a pulling force at the radius 
of a motor pulley of 25 pounds, and the pulley surface is 1 ft from the center of the motor shaft, 
the motor torque is the product of the radius (measured in ft) and the pulling force (measured 
in pounds). The torque is usually measured in foot-pounds, the standard measure for torque. 
For small motors, the torque may be measured in ounce-inches (oz-in). The same principle is 
used, but the ounce-inch measurement must be divided by 192 (12 inches × 16 ounces) to get 
the equivalent foot-pounds.
It is necessary to distinguish between the torque developed by a motor when operating at 
its rated speed and the torque developed at the instant the motor starts. Certain types of motors 
have high torque at rated speed but poor starting torque. 
The many types of loads that can be applied to motors 
mean that the torque characteristic must be considered 
when selecting a motor for a particular installation.
ROTATION
The direction of the armature rotation of a DC motor 
depends on the direction of the current in the field 
circuit and the armature circuit (Figure 1–8). To 
reverse the direction of rotation, the current direction 
in either the field or the armature must be reversed. 
Reversing  the power supply leads causes both the 
armature and the field to become reversed, as shown 
in Figure 1–9. To determine the direction of the con-
ductor movement, use the right-hand rule for motors, 
as shown in Figure 1–5. The first finger indicates the 
direction of the flux (north to south), the center finger 
indicates the direction of the current flow (negative to 
positive), and the thumb indicates the direction of the 
 resultant thrust.
FIGURE 1–7 Torque is  measured 
as the pulling force at some 
 distance from the center of 
the motor shaft. If the force is 
25 pounds and the distance is 1 ft 
from the center of the shaft, the 
motor torque is 25 ft-lbs.

STARTING CURRENT AND CEMF
The starting current of a DC motor is much higher than the running current while the motor is 
operating at its rated speed. At the instant power is applied, the armature is motionless and the 
armature current is limited only by the very low armature circuit wire resistance. As the motor 
builds up to its rated speed, the current input decreases until the motor reaches its rated speed. 
At this point, the armature current stops decreasing and remains constant.
Factors other than armature wire resistance also limit the current. Figure 1–10 illustrates a 
demonstration that shows the “generator” action (CEMF) within a motor that accounts for the 
decrease in current with a speed increase.

In Figure 1–10, a DC motor and a lamp (each with the same voltage rating) are  connected 
in parallel to the DC source. A zero-center ammeter connected in the circuit indicates the 
amount and direction of the current to the motor. When the line switch is open (A), there is no 
current in any part of the circuit. When the switch is closed (B), the lamp lights instantly and the 
ammeter registers high current to the motor. The motor current decreases as the motor speed 
increases and remains constant when the motor reaches its rated speed. The instant the switch 
is opened, the ammeter deflection reverses. The lamp continues to light but grows dimmer as 
the motor speed falls.
Two conclusions can be drawn from this demonstration:
• A DC motor develops an induced voltage while rotating.
• The direction of the induced voltage is opposite to that of the applied voltage and for 
this reason is called counter-EMF (CEMF).
The amount of voltage generated within a spinning armature depends on the speed of the 
rotation and the strength of the magnetic field. Just as in any generator, the left-hand rule for 
generators applies, as shown in Figure 1–11. 
Even though the armature is being caused to 
spin through motor action, the act of spinning 
a coil of wire within a magnetic field causes it 
to act like a generator. The thumb represents 
the direction of thrust of the moving conduc-
tor, and the first finger represents the direction 
of the main stator field magnetic flux. Now 
the first finger represents the direction of 
the induced current flow within the armature 
conductors, which is counter to the applied 
current. This counter-induced potential is 
CEMF. The induced current flow is smaller in

 magnitude than the applied current flow from the voltage source. The  difference between the 
applied current flow and the counter-induced current is the  differential current.
As the torque, or twisting effort, rotates the armature, the conductors of the armature cut 
the main field magnetic flux, as in a generator. This action induces a voltage into the armature 
windings that opposes line voltage.
The production of CEMF in a DC motor accounts for the changes in current to a motor 
armature at different speeds. When there is no current in the circuit, the motor armature is 
motionless and the CEMF is zero. The starting current is very high because only the ohmic 
resistance of the armature limits the current. As the armature starts to rotate, the CEMF 
 increases and the line current decreases. When the speed stops increasing, the value of the 
CEMF approaches the value of the applied voltage but is never equal to it. The value of 
the  voltage that actually forces current through the motor is equal to the difference between the 
applied voltage and the CEMF. At rated speed, this voltage differential just maintains the motor 
at constant speed, as shown in Figure 1–12.
When a mechanical load is then applied to the motor shaft, both the speed and CEMF 
decrease. However, the voltage differential increases and causes an increase of input current to 
the motor. Any further increase in mechanical load produces a proportional increase in input 
current (Figure 1–13).
The increase in motor current due to an increase in mechanical load also can be justified 
in terms of the torque. Because torque depends on the strength of the magnetic field of the 
armature, which, in turn, depends on the armature current, any increase in mechanical load 
requires an increase in the armature current, more load, slower speed, higher differential, and 
more current.

Because the starting current may be many times greater than the rated current under full 
load, large DC motors must not be connected directly to the power line for start-up. The heavy 
current surges produce excessive line voltage drops that may damage the motor. The maximum 
branch-circuit fuse size for any DC motor is based on the full-load running current of the motor. 
Therefore, starters for DC motors generally limit the starting current to 150% of the full-load 
running current.
ARMATURE REACTION
Armature reaction occurs in DC motors and is caused by the stator magnetic field being distorted, 
or altered, in reaction to the armature magnetic field. The armature reaction is actually a bending of 
the motor magnetic field so that the brushes are no longer aligned with the neutral magnetic plane 
of the motor. If the brushes are not in alignment with this magnetic plane, the current conducted 
to the armature does not split equally in the armature conductors and therefore causes a voltage 
difference at the brushes. This causes sparking where the brush meets the commutator. In a motor 
with a constant load, the brushes can be shifted back into the neutral plane to reduce sparking. 
The brushes are shifted in the direction opposite to the rotation. If the motor has a varying load, 
the neutral plane will be constantly shifting. To counteract the effects of the field distortion, some 
motors are designed with interpoles or commutating poles. These poles are connected in series with 
the armature circuit. Every change in armature current that would tend to distort the magnetic field 
is counteracted by the interpole magnetic field or commutating windings (refer to Figure 1–2).
SPEED CONTROL AND SPEED REGULATION
The terms speed control and speed regulation should not be used interchangeably. The meaning 
of each is entirely different. Speed regulation refers to a motor’s capability to maintain a certain 
speed under varying mechanical loads from no load to full load. It is expressed as a percent. 
The formula used is
 Percent speed regulation =   No-load speed - Full-load speed
Full-load speed
 * 100
Using this formula, you can determine that a motor that holds a constant speed between no load 
and full load has a 0% speed regulation.
Speed control refers to changing the motor speed intentionally by means of external control 
devices. This is done in a variety of ways and is not a result of the design of the motor.
Speed Control
DC motors are operated below normal speed by reducing the voltage applied to the armature 
circuit. Resistors connected in series with the armature may be used for voltage reduction, or

electronic speed control is used to reduce the voltage applied to the armature circuit. When the 
armature voltage is reduced while keeping the field current constant, the CEMF is too high, and 
no current flows to the rotor. The rotor torque is reduced, and the speed slows (Figure 1–13). 
The speed of a DC motor can also be brought below its rated speed by varying the voltage 
applied to the entire motor. However, this method is not used because there is a loss of torque 
along with the reduction in speed.
A DC motor may be operated above its rated speed by reducing the strength of the stator 
field flux. A system is used to reduce the field current and, in turn, the field flux.
Although it seems reasonable 
that a reduction in field flux reduces 
the speed, the speed actually increases 
because the reduction of flux reduces 
the CEMF and permits the applied 
voltage to increase the armature cur-
rent. The speed continues to increase 
until the increased torque is balanced 
by the opposing torque of the mechan-
ical load. When the field flux is reduced 
while keeping the armature voltage 
constant, the CEMF in the armature 
drops (Figure 1–14). As a result, there 
is a larger voltage differential, which 
causes an increase in armature current. 
This develops more torque to increase 
the speed of the motor (Figure 1–15).
Caution: Because motor speed 
increases with a decrease in field flux, 
the field circuit of a motor should 
never be opened when the motor is 
operating, particularly when it is run-
ning freely without a load. An open 
field may cause the motor to rotate at 
speeds that are dangerous to both the 
machine and to the personnel operat-
ing it. For this reason, some motors are 
protected against excessive speed by a 
“no field release” feature. This device 
disconnects the motor from the power 
source if the field circuit opens.

THE SHUNT MOTOR
Two factors are important when selecting a motor for a particular application: (1) the variation 
of the speed with a change in load and (2) the variation of the torque with a change in load. 
A shunt motor is basically a constant speed device. If a load is applied, the motor tends to slow 
down. The slight loss in speed reduces the CEMF and results in an increase of the armature 
current. This action continues until the increased current produces enough torque to meet the 
demands of the increased load. As a result, the shunt motor reaches a state of stable equilibrium 
because a change of load always produces a reaction that adapts the power input to the change 
in load.
The basic circuit for a shunt motor is shown in Figure 1–16(A). Note that only a shunt 
field winding is shown. Figure 1–16(B) shows the addition of a series winding to counteract the 
effects of armature reaction. From the standpoint of a schematic diagram, Figure 1–16(B) looks 
like a compound motor. However, this type of motor is not considered a compound motor 
because the commutating winding is not wound on the same pole as the field winding, and the 
series field has only a few turns of wire in series with the armature circuit. As a result, the oper-
ating characteristics are those of a shunt motor. This is so noted on the nameplate of the motor 
by the terms compensated shunt motor or stabilized shunt motor.
Speed Control
A DC shunt motor has excellent speed control. To operate the motor above its rated speed, 
reduce the field current and field flux. To operate below rated speed, reduce the voltage applied 
to the armature circuit.
Electronic speed control systems are used extensively. The principles of control are the 
same as the old manual controls. Speeds above normal are achieved by reducing the field

 voltage electronically, and speeds below normal reduce the voltage ap plied to the armature. 
(For more detail on electronic speed control, see Unit 6 on speed control.)
Rotation
The direction of armature rotation may be changed by reversing the direction of current in 
either the field circuit or the armature circuit. For a motor with a simple shunt field circuit, 
it may be convenient to reverse the field circuit lead. If the motor has a series winding, or an 
interpole winding to counteract armature reaction, the same relative direction of current must 
be maintained in the shunt and series windings. For this reason, it is always safer to reverse the 
direction of just the armature current.
Torque
A DC shunt motor has high torque at any speed. At start-up, a DC shunt motor develops 150% 
of its rated torque if the starting controller is capable of withstanding the heating effects of 
the current. For very short periods of time, the motor can develop 350% of full-load torque, if 
necessary.
Speed Regulation
The speed regulation of a shunt motor drops from 5% to 10% from the no-load state to full load. 
As a result, a shunt motor is superior to the series DC motor, but is inferior to a compound-
wound DC motor (see Units 2 and 3). Figure 1–17 shows a typical DC motor with horsepower 
ratings ranging from 1 hp to 5 hp.
PERMANENT MAGNET 
MOTORS
A variation on the DC shunt motor prin-
ciple is the permanent magnet (PM) motor. 
Two varieties are available. One style of 
PM motor uses a permanently magnetized 
material such as Alnico or ceramic magnets 
mounted in the stator to provide a con-
stant magnetic field. The rotor is supplied 
with DC through a brush and commutator 
system. The result is similar to a DC shunt-
type motor, but it has a very linear speed/
torque curve.
Another type of PM motor uses the 
PMs mounted in the rotor. Because DC is

still supplied to the motor, commutation must be provided to properly magnetize the stator in 
relation to the rotor for rotational torque. The commutator segments are actually connected 
to the stator windings, and a set of sliding contacts on the rotor provides the proper electrical 
 connection from the DC source to the proper commutator segments on the stator. This type of 
PM motor can be produced in larger horsepower models than the PM stator types. PM motors 
are generally smaller than 5 hp. Figure 1–18 compares the physical size of a PM motor to a shunt 
motor of similar horsepower.
The DC permanent magnet motor is a popular motor where battery power provides the 
DC for the motor power. Small motors used for electrical drives in the automobile and motors 
such as trolling motors are good examples of PM motors. Rare-earth magnetic materials, such 
as samarium-cobalt and neodymium, have made the permanent magnets more powerful and 
allowed the size of PM motors to increase in horsepower to more than 15 hp. The torque-to-
weight ratio and the horsepower-to-weight ratio make these motors a popular choice for mobile 
vehicles where horsepower is needed with light weight. The operating characteristics of these 
motors resemble the characteristics of a separately excited shunt motor. The speed curve is 
dependent on the armature field current.
If a motor is not providing rotational torque, the problem could be that the magnets have 
lost some of the original magnetic strength. Another problem that can occur is the demagneti-
zation of the PM material. This can happen when the motors are running in one direction and

then are quickly reversed under power. Some control circuits provide protection from quick 
reversals; others compensate for this problem by applying a small voltage during reversing.
BRUSHLESS DC MOTORS
Instead of using mechanical commutation to supply a field and power to the rotor, electronics can 
be used to switch the stator field. The rotor uses a PM so that no direct power is supplied to the 
rotor. To switch the power supply to the field windings, sensing devices must be used to deter-
mine rotor movement. As the rotor speed increases or decreases, the sensor relays the information 
to the electronic switching supply. The electronic supply constantly adjusts to  provide the proper 
level of voltage to the proper stator poles to maintain speed and direction (see Figure 1–19).

SUMMARY

of current to the field. The principle of the DC motor relies on the concept of commuta-
tion. This commutator and brush connection always keep the direction of the current and 
the direction of the magnetic field consistent. The speed and the current to the rotor are 
inversely proportional. If the rotor is spinning faster, more CEMF is produced and less 
voltage differential, and therefore less armature current is produced. DC motors are used 
in a variety of styles for different purposes. Many variations of the shunt motor are used in 
specialized applications.

Despite the wide use of alternating current for power generation and transmission, the 
DC series motor is often used, such as for starter motors in automobiles and aircraft. This type 
of motor is also used as a traction motor because of its capability to produce a high torque with 
only a moderate increase in power at reduced speed.
The basic circuit for the series motor is shown in Figure 2–1. The field circuit has compar-
atively few turns of large-diameter wire that permit it to carry the full-load current of the motor.

TORQUE
A series motor develops up to 500% of its full-load torque at starting. Therefore, this type of 
motor is used for railway installations, cranes, and other applications requiring high torque at 
low speed. The series motor is used in many electric locomotives, where the shaft becomes the 
axle for the drive wheels.
Remember that the shunt motor operates at constant speed. In a shunt motor, any 
increase in torque requires a proportionate increase in armature current. In a series motor, the 
stator field is operated below magnetic saturation, and any increase in load causes an increase of 
current in both the field and armature circuits. As a result, the armature flux and the field flux 
increase together. Because torque depends on the interaction of the armature and field fluxes, 
the torque increases as the square of the value of the current increases. Therefore, a series motor 
produces a greater torque than a shunt motor for the same increase in current. The series motor, 
however, shows a greater reduction in speed as mechanical load is added. A light load has little 
current draw, and the armature and field current are reduced.
SPEED CONTROL AND SPEED REGULATION
The speed regulation of a line-connected series motor is inherently poorer than that of a shunt 
motor. If the motor is running with a mechanical load and the load is suddenly reduced, the 
motor speed increases. The increase in speed creates more CEMF in the armature, and the 
circuit current is reduced. The circuit current is the same current in both the stator field and 
the rotor field, therefore squaring the effect of the current reduction. The torque that is pro-
duced drops off dramatically. The change in speed and torque is much greater in a series motor

than the same change in load imposed on a shunt motor. If the mechanical load is removed 
 entirely, the motor speed increases to dangerous levels, even to the point of destroying the 
motor by its own centrifugal force. For this reason, series motors are permanently connected to 
the  mechanical load and should not be run with full voltage without a load.
When a mechanical load is added to the series motor, the opposite effect is true. 
The motor slows with a new, higher torque requirement. As the motor slows, the CEMF in the 
rotor is reduced and the line current is allowed to increase. This affects both the stator field and 
the rotor field. With a drop in speed, the torque is increased dramatically, and the motor runs at 
a lower speed but with much larger torque. This gives the speed torque curve its flattened slope 
(see Figure 2–2). Note that the series motor has more torque with lower armature current than 
the other DC motors.

If the maximum branch-circuit fuse size (time delay and nontime delay fuses, and inverse 
time breakers) for any DC motor is limited to 150% of the full-load running current of the 
motor, the starters used with such motors must limit the starting current to 150% of the full-
load current rating. Instantaneous trip breakers allow the rating to be 250% of the rated current, 
according to Table 430.52 of the 2011 National Electrical Code®. Such starters must be equipped 
with an automatic, no-load release to prevent the armature from reaching dangerous speeds. 
The no-load release is set to open the circuit at the armature current corresponding to the 
maximum speed rating.
The speed of a series motor is controlled by varying the applied voltage. A series motor 
controller usually is designed to start, stop, reverse, and regulate the speed.

MOTOR RATINGS
Series DC motors are rated for voltage, current, horsepower, and maximum speed.
SUMMARY
The DC series motor has very high starting torque at very low speed (Figure 2–4). This 
 characteristic makes it ideal for traction motors. These motors are used in forklifts and diesel 
electric locomotives. The relative speed of the motor is controlled by adjusting the applied 
voltage to both the series field and the armature. The motor can be reversed by changing the 
direction of current in either the series field or the armature.

Compound-wound motors are used whenever it is necessary to obtain speed regulation 
and torque characteristics not obtainable with either a shunt or a series motor. Because many 
drives need a fairly high starting torque and a constant speed under load, the compound wound 
motor is suitable for these applications. Some of the industrial applications include drives for 
passenger and freight elevators, stamping presses, rolling mills, and metal shears.
The compound motor has a normal shunt winding and a series winding on each field pole. 
As in the compound-wound DC generator, the series and shunt windings may be connected in 
long shunt, as shown in Figure 3–1(A), or short shunt, shown in Figure 3–1(B).
When the series winding field is connected to aid the shunt winding field, the machine 
is a cumulative compound motor. When the series field opposes the shunt field, the machine is 
a differential compound motor. Using Fleming’s left-hand rule for electromagnets, it can be seen 
that the two windings will either reinforce each other or try to cancel each other (Figure 3–2).
TORQUE
The operating characteristics of a cumulative compound-wound motor are a combination 
of those of the series motor and the shunt motor. When a load is applied, the increasing current 
through the series winding increases the field flux. As a result, the torque for a given current 
is greater than it would be for a shunt motor. However, this flux increase causes the speed to 
decrease to a lower value than in a shunt motor. A cumulative compound-wound motor devel-
ops a high torque with any sudden increase of load. It is best suited for operating varying load 
machines such as punch presses.

SPEED
Unlike a series motor, the cumulative compound motor has a definite no-load speed and will 
not build up to destructive speeds if the load is removed.
Speed Control
The speed of a cumulative compound motor can be controlled by using resistors in the arma-
ture circuit to reduce the applied voltage. When the motor will be used for installations where 
the rotation must be frequently reversed, such as in elevators, hoists, and railways, the control-
ler should have voltage dropping resistors and switching arrangements to accomplish reversal. 
This was the general mode of control for older installations of DC motors. Now, most of the 
 controllers use electronics to accomplish the same effect.
Electronic Speed Control
A block diagram approach to the electronic speed control of a DC motor is presented in 
Figure 3–3. The AC line is rectified by a full-wave bridge to supply pulsating DC to the shunt 
field at a steady value. The input is shown as a single-phase AC source, but the input may be a 
three-phase AC source, especially for larger motors. The DC supplied to the armature and the 
series field is controlled by a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) or other solid-state electronics 
such as a MOSFET (metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor). By adjusting the firing 
time of the semiconductor, either more or less of the DC voltage available can be applied to the 
FIGURE 3–2 Compound field windings.

armature. If a low amount of DC voltage is applied, the torque is low and the resultant speed is 
low. If the solid-state device is fired early in the waveform and allowed to conduct for most of 
the cycle, then a larger amount of voltage is applied to the armature, more current results, and 
torque increases to spin the armature at a higher speed. Speeds below rated motor speed are 
produced by lowering the amount of voltage applied to the armature while keeping the shunt 
field steady; if higher than normal speed is needed, the shunt field can be weakened. Most 
speed controls have some type of feedback to sense the armature current, compare it to the 
set speed, and adjust the electronic conduction control to compensate for varying mechanical 
loads to keep the motor speed regulated. (For more details, see Unit 6.)
Speed Regulation
The speed regulation of a cumulative compound-wound motor is inferior to that of a shunt 
motor and superior to that of a series motor. It is a compromise between a series motor and a 
shunt motor, as seen in Figure 3–4.
The graph in Figure 3–4 shows that the percent of speed regulation of a compound- 
wound DC motor is lower than that of a shunt motor but higher than that of a series motor.
The speed versus torque curves presented in Figure 2–2 show the relationship between the 
shunt, series, and compound motor. The series has the highest torque at the lowest speed, but

the speed regulation is very poor. The shunt motor has less torque at higher loads, but the speed 
regulation is very good. The compound motor has characteristics of both, in that the torque 
and speed regulation characteristics are in 
between the shunt and the series motor.
ROTATION
The rotation of a compound-wound 
motor can be reversed by changing the 
direction of the current in the field  circuits 
or the armature circuit (Figure 3–5). 
Because the series field coils must also be 
reversed if the shunt field is reversed, it is 
conventional to reverse the current in the 
armature only.

compound-wound motor, the proper magnetic polarity of the shunt and series field must be 
determined. Standardized tests determine these conditions. For example, when a compound 
motor is ready to be placed into operation, a double check for proper compounding is nec-
essary. It must be verified that the series field is aiding the shunt field flux. Connecting the 
compound motor is referred to as cumulative compounding. If this is not done, the motor may 
start at light load under the influence of the shunt field. As the load increases, the series field 
becomes more powerful. If the series field is an opposite polarity from the shunt field, the stator 
field becomes weaker. Eventually the series field becomes more dominant, and it may suddenly 
reverse the direction of rotation of the motor.
The following test verifies field polarity. With no load on the motor, connect the motor 
as a shunt motor only, without placing the series field in the circuit. Momentarily start the 
motor and note the direction of rotation. Keep track of which motor lead markings are con-
nected to which line leads. Now connect the motor as a series motor, without the shunt field. 
Momentarily start the motor. Do not let it run without a mechanical load. Again, be sure to note 
which series field leads are connected to which line leads. If the motor turns the same direction 
each time, reconnect the shunt field to the original line leads. If not, reverse the shunt field leads 
so that both series and shunt motor connections cause the same direction of rotation. This 
establishes cumulative compounding.
Differential Compounding
Almost 0% speed regulation can be obtained with a differentially compounded motor. When a 
motor is connected as a differential compound machine, the series field opposes the shunt field 
so that the field flux is decreased as a load is applied (Figure 3–6). As a result, the speed remains

substantially constant with an increase in load. With overcompounding, a slight increase in 
speed is possible with an increase in load. This speed characteristic is achieved only with a loss 
in the rate at which torque increases with load.
Because the field decreases with a load increase, a differential compound motor has a ten-
dency for load instability. When starting a differential motor, it is recommended that the series 
field be shorted because the great starting current in this field may overbalance the shunt field 
and cause the motor to start in the opposite direction.
A differential machine is connected and tested on installation using the same procedure 
outlined for a cumulative compound motor. For the differential motor, however, the series 
windings should be connected in the opposite direction from that of the shunt winding. Do not 
exceed the load on the nameplate, or reversal of direction may occur as noted in the description 
of cumulative compounding.
SUMMARY
The DC compound motor is used where a compromise is needed between the series and the 
shunt motor. The compound motor has better speed characteristics than the series motor and 
better torque characteristics than the shunt motor. The motor can be connected so that the 
shunt field and the series fields are in the same direction. This is the cumulative connection. You 
should perform a test to be sure the motor is connected as intended. The cumulative connec-
tion reacts differently than the differential connection. Many DC motors are now driven by 
electronic drives. The same basic concepts are used to control speed and direction.

Manual starters for DC motors are rare because electronic controls are much more effi-
cient and practical. A short review of the manual methods called three-point and four-point 
starters may be useful, as some electricians may still need to maintain these starting methods.
Two factors limit the amount of current used by a motor that is supplied from a DC 
source: (1) the counter-electromotor force (CEMF) produced in the rotor by the spinning of 
the conductors through a magnetic field and (2) the actual resistance of the motor windings. 
The wire resistance is typically very low, less than 10 ohms, and the rotor has no CEMF when 
the rotor is at a standstill or just starting. Therefore, the current is very high at the starting of 
the DC motor. The same effect is also seen in AC motors, but the introduction of impedance 
of the motor coils due to AC helps limit the starting current. In DC motors, the need for a 
starting controller with an in-line resistor or variable rheostat for limiting the starting current 
was devised. This starting rheostat, or DC motor starter, is described by NEMA (National 
Electrical Manufacturers Association) as a device used to accelerate the motor to its rated speed 
in one direction and limit the current to the armature circuit to a safe value during starting and 
 accelerating. Two styles of manual starters were used.
THREE-TERMINAL STARTER FOR DC MOTORS
A three-terminal starter is shown in Figure 5–1, connected to a shunt-wound motor. Note that 
the tapped resistance is connected in series with the armature, yet the high resistance field 
receives full voltage immediately upon starting. The idea is to get the field flux at full value

immediately so the armature immediately begins producing CEMF as it begins spinning. As the 
starter is moved from left to right, portions of the armature series resistance are shorted out, and 
eventually there is no more resistance in series with the armature. The electromagnet on the far 
right actually holds the arm in the “run” position. If the shunt field has an open circuit at any 
time, the arm releases the controller arm, causing the motor to stop as a precaution. This “no 
field” circuit is necessary to prevent a high-speed runaway of the DC shunt motor at no load. In 
Figure 5–2, a compound motor is connected to a three-terminal starter. The only change is the 
addition of the series field to the diagram.
FOUR-TERMINAL STARTERS FOR DC MOTORS
This slight variation on the three-terminal starter is used if there is a need for variable speed con-
trol using a field rheostat (see Figure 5–3). As the arm is raised to the first position, the shunt 
field receives full voltage, yet there is still resistance in the armature circuit. As the arm is moved 
to the right, resistance is added to the shunt field circuit but removed from the armature circuit. 
Because adding resistance to the shunt field circuit reduces the current to the field, the hold-
ing electromagnet is not in series with the shunt field but is connected across the line, hence 
the fourth terminal. This process makes this starter more like an AC starter with “no-voltage” 
release. If line voltage drops too low, the electromagnet releases the arm, which springs back to 
stop the motor.

NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CODE® FOR MOTOR STARTERS
Part VII in Article 430.82(C) refers to the controller design and the need for starting rheostat 
controls. Note that 430.89 requires speed limitations on separately excited DC motors and on 
series motors as well as motor generators and converters that can be driven by DC at excessive 
speed. Remember that DC series motors that can run at no load may generate runaway speeds 
and literally throw themselves apart.
DRUM CONTROLLERS
Drum controllers are used when an operator is controlling the motor directly. The drum con-
troller is used to start, stop, reverse, and vary the speed of a motor. This type of controller was 
used on crane motors, elevators, machine tools, and other applications in heavy industry. As a 
result, the drum controller had to be more rugged than the starting rheostat.
A drum controller with its cover removed is shown in Figure 5–4. The switch consists 
of a series of contacts mounted on a movable cylinder. The contacts, which are insulated from 
the cylinder and from one another, are called movable contacts. Another set of contacts, called 
s tationary contacts, is located inside the controller. These stationary contacts are arranged to 
touch the movable contacts as the cylinder is rotated. A handle, keyed to the shaft for the mov-
able cylinder and contacts, is located on top of the drum controller. This handle can be moved

either clockwise or counterclockwise to provide 
a range of speed control in either direction of 
rotation. The handle can remain stationary in 
either the forward or reverse direction due to a 
roller and a notched wheel. A spring forces the 
roller into one of the notches at each successive 
 position of the controller handle to keep the 
 cylinder and movable contacts stationary until 
the handle is moved by the operator.
A drum controller with two steps of resis-
tance is shown in Figure 5–5. The contacts are 
represented in a flat position in this schematic 
diagram to make it easier to trace the circuit 
 connections. To operate the motor in the forward 
direction, the set of contacts on the right must 
make contact with the center stationary contacts. 
Operation in the reverse direction requires that 
the set of movable contacts on the left make 
 contact with the center stationary contacts.
Note in Figure 5–5 that the controller han-
dle can be set to three forward positions and 
three reverse positions. In the first forward  position, all the resistance is in series with the arma-
ture. The circuit path for the first forward position is as follows:
 
1. Movable fingers a, b, c, and d contact the stationary contacts 7, 5, 4, and 3.
 
2. The current path is from the negative side of the line to contact 7, from 7 to a, from 
a to b, from b to 5, and then to armature terminal A1.
 
3. After passing through the armature winding to terminal A2, the current path is to 
stationary contact 6, and then to stationary contact 4.
 
4. From contact 4, the current path is to contact c, to d, and then to contact 3.
 
5. The current path then goes through the armature resistor, to the series field, and 
then back to the positive side of the line.
The shunt field of the compound motor is connected across the source voltage. On the 
second forward position of the controller handle, part of the resistance is cut out. The third 
forward position cuts out all the resistance and puts the armature circuit directly across the 
source voltage.
In the first reverse position, all the resistance is inserted in series with the armature.

Figure 5–6 shows the first position of the controller in the reverse direction. The cur-
rent in the armature circuit is reversed. However, the current direction in the shunt and series 
fields is the same as the direction for the forward positions. Remember that an earlier unit 
showed that a change in current direction in the armature only resulted in a change in the 
direction of rotation.
The second reverse position cuts out part of the resistance circuit. The third reverse posi-
tion cuts out all the resistance and puts the armature circuit directly across the source. Drum 
controllers with more positions for a greater control of speed can be obtained. However, these 
controllers all use the same type of circuit arrangement shown in this unit.

SUMMARY
Three-terminal and four-terminal starting rheostats are not used much any more. The advent of 
electronic starters has all but replaced the mechanical starters. The concept of the starter is still 
used, and the safeguards for motor operation are still important.
DC series motors require a different starting controller than a shunt or compound 
motor. The holding circuit for the controller is in series with the starting resistance. If there is 
a  low-voltage or no-voltage condition, the starter is returned to the off position. Drum control-
lers are still frequently used with AC as well as DC motors. It is important to be able to read the 
connection diagrams and the sequence diagrams on drum-type controllers.

DC motors are used in a variety of applications for exact speed control and for high 
torque requirements that have not readily been available with AC motors. The DC motor and 
drive system has been available for some time, and many industrial installations are dependent 
on the operating characteristics of the motor and associated drive system. Until the more 
recent introduction of the variable frequency drive (VFD), and especially the vector drive, 
precise speed control and acceleration, deceleration, and electrical braking were not available 
with AC motors.
DC DRIVE BASICS
The DC controller is based on the same principles as the older electromechanical systems 
for controlling DC motors. In other words, to control the speed, the current is reduced to the 
armature of the DC motor to reduce the speed on the motor below normal full operating design 
speed, and the main field is weakened for speeds above normal speed. The difference between 
the older starters and the electronic one is efficiency and much tighter control. The old starters 
inserted resistance into the armature circuit to reduce the voltage and current to the armature 
and therefore dissipate the energy in the resistors and waste the power, making it inefficient. 
There was little feedback to the controller, so there was no adjustable process to control the 
exact speed of the motor. With electronics, there is little wasted energy and much more precise 
control of actual motor operations.
DC DRIVE BLOCK CIRCUITS
The DC motor requires the application of direct current to the actual motor windings. The DC 
drive controller will change, or rectify, the available AC to DC and adjust the DC to control 
the motor operations. Two general schemes are used to deliver the DC to the motor. Each of the 
methods provides the same basic functions. See Figure 6–1 for the block diagram of a control-
ler. One block provides DC to the field, and one block supplies controlled DC to the armature. 
A set point control adjusts the firing of output silicon- controlled rectifiers (SCRs or triodes for 
alternating current [TRIACs]). Feedback circuits tell the controller what the motor is doing.
SIMPLE CONTROL
One method used for small motors with only basic speed and torque requirements is to use 
only half of the incoming AC, rectify it with a half-wave rectifier system, and deliver half-wave 
DC to the motor armature (see Figure 6–2). In most cases, the shunt field is supplied by a 
full-wave bridge circuit that supplies rectified DC to the motor field. This can be an adjust-
able voltage also if the motor has to operate above rated speed. The armature power is typi-
cally controlled by an SCR that is turned on at different points in the waveform to adjust the 
voltage to the motor armature to control the speed. In the case of a motor where exact speed 
control and high torque are not critical, the half-wave controller may be sufficient and most

economical. The  firing of the SCR or the gate control may be of the amplitude control or the 
phase control type. The amplitude control only has control over the first half of the sinewave, 
as seen in Figure 6–3. This is the least costly control scheme and provides the least amount of 
control. The more common type is the phase control method that allows the half-wave almost 
180 electrical degrees of control (see Figure 6–4).

DC POWER SUPPLIES
In almost all situations currently encountered, the DC voltage 
sources needed to supply motors and other electrical apparatus 
are produced by solid-state rectifiers that convert alternating 
current (AC) to direct current (DC). There are several differ-
ent methods used to rectify the AC and create various levels 
of DC output from the  rectifier circuits at different degrees of 
smoothed (low-ripple) DC. As in DC generators where the 
DC is produced through commutation of a generated AC wave, 
the commutated DC is not always a smooth DC voltage as you 
would see from a battery output. Electronic rectifier circuits also 
produce a DC with different percentages of ripple to the DC 
voltage. The small-ripple value of the DC voltage can be seen 
in Figure 6–5. As you can see, the voltage output is DC, mean-
ing that the current always flows in one specific direction, but it 
flows at unequal amounts. There are, in fact, a peak and a valley 
to the DC voltage. This fluctuating DC is sometimes referred to 
as the AC component (fluctuating component) of the DC wave.
The rectifier circuit can be as simple as a single diode used with a single-sinewave AC input, 
as in Figure 6–6. The output waveform is DC half-wave rectification. This means that only half of 
the AC voltage is used and the other half of the AC input voltage is blocked, or not used. The DC 
value of the output voltage is approximately 0.314 (or π) times the peak AC value of the input. If 
the peak of the AC input is 100 volts, a meter set to DC on the output would measure approxi-
mately 31.4 VDC. If you look at the DC with an oscilloscope, it appears very bumpy; in other 
words, it has a lot of ripple. When you measure the AC (fluctuating component) of the waveform 
using a meter that blocks the DC level, you measure near the value  calculated by AC peak × 0.385, 
or about 38.5 volts in this example. The percent ripple is calculated by the formula
% ripple = AC ripple component/DC value

Compare the DC value to the AC value for a half-wave rectifier and you get approximately 
121% ripple. We discuss how to filter the DC to reduce the ripple at a later time.
Another rectifier circuit that provides more DC for a specific AC input is known as the 
full-wave rectifier circuit. This circuit requires two diodes and the use of a center-tapped sec-
ondary AC transformer. By viewing Figure 6–7, known as a center-tapped, full-wave rectifier 
circuit, you see that the full input voltage is used in the DC output. In this circuit both halves of 
the AC input waveform are used to supply the DC load. For a half cycle of input voltage, the top 
of the circuit is the most positive part of the circuit, and current flows from the center tap of the 
transformer, through the load, through diode 1, back to the source. In the other half cycle, the 
current again flows from the center tap through the load, through diode 2, back to the bottom 
side of the source transformer, which is now the most positive point of the circuit. In this circuit 
the DC value of the output voltage is twice the value of the half-wave rectifier. The output is 
now approximately 0.637 (2π) times the peak of the AC input voltage. The AC ripple content 
has decreased to AC peak × 0.305. There is less nonconducting time for the DC voltage, and 
the ripple content has decreased. In fact, with a higher DC content and a lower fluctuation, or 
AC component, the ripple content has decreased to approximately 48%. With less ripple, less 
filtering is needed to create smooth DC voltage output.

Yet another type of rectifier circuit is the full-wave bridge circuit, as in Figure 6–8. As the 
name implies, the DC uses the full wave of the AC input. The bridge refers to the style of circuit 
converting AC to DC. With the use of four relatively inexpensive diodes, the expensive center-
tapped transformer can be eliminated. See Figure 6–9 for each half-cycle current path through 
the bridge of diodes. The output of the bridge has the same values of DC as the center-tapped, 
full-wave rectifier if you ignore the small diode voltage drops of the rectifiers. The waveform of 
the DC output has a frequency as well as a ripple content. The ripple frequency is determined 
by the number of positive peaks that occur in 1 second. In both full-wave rectifier circuits, the 
number of positive peaks that occurs is twice that of the AC input-positive peaks, as verified in

Figure 6–12. If the input AC waveform is at a standard 60 Hz, or 60 positive peaks per second, 
the full-wave DC has 120 positive peaks for a ripple frequency of 120 Hz. By comparison, in 
the half-wave rectifier the input frequency is equal to the output DC frequency. Remember the 
AC component does not reverse the direction of current flow but only changes the value of the 
DC. The frequency relates to the AC component of the DC output.
In DC motor control, the fields of the DC motors are often supplied by a steady DC value 
provided by diode rectifier circuits. To smooth out the DC level and make it more consistent, 
the ripple effect of the DC has to be filtered or smoothed. With a higher ripple frequency and 
smaller ripple content, as in full-wave rectification, the filtering can be done effectively and 
efficiently with capacitor filters.
Capacitive filtering uses a capacitor or set of capacitors in parallel with the load. 
The  circuit in Figure 6–10 shows that the capacitor charges up to the peak of the waveform as 
current flows through the load and also charges the capacitor. In the half cycle, when the sup-
ply  current path is blocked, the capacitor begins to discharge through the load in the direction

shown in Figure 6–11. The effect is to fill in the gap of nonconducting diode time and reduce 
the ripple and increase the DC value of voltage. By using the same concept on the full-wave 
bridge rectifier circuit of Figure 6–12, the DC value becomes smoother and the ripple becomes 
less objectionable. With the load consisting of the motor coils producing the magnetic field, the 
steady DC makes the motor performance more reliable and predictable.

Most DC electronic speed con-
trols use a separate source to provide 
steady DC to the fields. These supplies 
are made of full-wave bridges or more 
typically use a three-phase rectifier sys-
tem, as in Figure 6–13. In this system, all 
three phases are rectified, and the DC 
level remains high and the ripple per-
centage is very low. This means the DC 
supply needs very little filtering.
The DC supplies that are used to provide the DC for the armature are constructed a little 
differently. The reason for the difference is the method used to control the speed of a DC motor. 
For speeds below full speed, the method used reduces the voltage applied to the armature while 
leaving the field at full strength. Therefore, it is necessary to create a variable voltage DC sup-
ply to control the armature power. For most DC controllers, the primary power tends to be 
 three-phase AC. The schematic diagram in Figure 6–14 is used with the addition of a control 
network that allows the thyristors, such as TRIACs, to be turned on at various times. Essentially, 
if the TRIACs are gated at various angles, the output DC can be controlled rather precisely. If 
the TRIACs are turned on at 0°, the output voltage is very high positive, based on the formula
VDC = 1.35 × ACRMS × cosine of the firing angle
With 460 VAC applied and a 0° firing angle, the DC is approximately 620 volts. At a 90° 
 firing angle, the DC voltage is zero because there is just as much positive as negative waveform, 
and at a 180° firing angle the DC is all negative at −621 volts. Angles between 0° and 90° yield 
DC between 621 and 0 VDC. This process allows us to control the armature voltage that adjusts 
the speed of the DC motor.
As seen in Figure 6–14, there is a large diode across the armature connection called a  
 flywheel diode, freewheeling diode, or kickback diode. The diode is connected in the control so that

it is reversed biased, blocking current flow, while the normal voltage is applied to the armature. 
When the supply DC is turned off, the magnetic field in the armature collapses and creates a 
large inductive kick voltage, opposite to the applied voltage. This large inductive kick voltage 
could be enough to break down the motor windings or the motor controller; therefore, the fly-
wheel diode is forward biased by the inductive kick, and the kick is reduced by allowing current 
to flow back through the armature windings, which slows the magnetic field collapse.
SAFETY CIRCUITS
In most controllers, a safety circuit monitors the DC field. If this stator field is lost, the motor 
may accelerate to dangerous speeds, especially with no load. If the field is lost on compound 
motors, the motor becomes a series motor and operates as a series motor would. The power to 
the armature must be disconnected. The current to the field can be monitored by placing a low-
ohm resistor in series with the field. Current flowing to the field passes through the resistor and 
creates a voltage drop. The voltage drop becomes part of the control circuit for the armature. 
If there is no field sensor voltage, the SCR firing circuit for the armature shuts down. Another 
method is to use a DC current flow sensor called a Hall effect sensor, which is essentially a current 
transformer specifically designed to sense DC current flow. Again, this sensor provides informa-
tion to the armature control circuit.
Another type of safety is the current control to the armature. Because there is only DC 
resistance to current flow in the windings when the motor is not spinning, the initial current flow 
to a stopped or stalled motor may be very large. To avoid damaging the motor or the electronic 
controller, current sensors can be used to adjust the firing angle of the SCRs to control armature 
current. One method of sensing the cur-
rent is the same as the field sensor. By 
placing a low-ohm resistor in series with 
the armature current, the voltage dropped 
across the resistor can be used to operate a 
control point in the firing circuit. If the cur-
rent is too high, the voltage drop across the 
resistor is high, and the signal is sent to the 
controller to reduce the armature current. 
Another method is to measure the AC cur-
rent going into the output SCR output con-
troller. By using AC current transformers, 
the input current is monitored, which is 
indicative of the output DC current. When 
the output is too high, the input monitors 
send a signal to the controller to reduce the 
“on” time of the SCRs (see Figure 6–15).

SPEED CONTROL AND REGULATION
As mentioned earlier, the speed of the DC motor is easily controlled by adjusting the amount 
of time the thyristors are allowed to conduct by controlling the “on” time during each cycle. 
If the controller is operating in an open loop mode, there is no feedback from the motor to the 
controller. This means the thyristors will fire as determined by the input control signal or the 
speed-setting potentiometer. If the motor is to maintain a set speed under varying loads, there 
must be feedback from the motor to create a closed loop system. Often times the actual speed of 
the motor is monitored by a tachometer attached to the motor. The tachometer output signal is 
fed back to the firing control to adjust the firing of the thyristor to compensate for load-induced 
speed changes. Another method to monitor the exact speed of the motor is to use an armature-
voltage feedback circuit. This circuit basically measures the exact voltage across the armature. If 
the motor speed slows down, less CEMF is produced before any change occurs in the control. 
This reduced CEMF causes the voltage across the armature to be reduced. The reduction in the 
armature voltage is fed back to the controller, causing the thyristors to be turned on earlier in 
the cycle and more current to be sent to the armature.
Internal resistance (IR) compensation is another system designed to improve the speed 
regulation of a DC motor. The IR of the motor is relatively low. The IR compensation monitors 
the actual current to the armature by using a small series resistor (see Figure 6–16). If the motor 
speed slows down, less CEMF is produced by the motor. If the firing does not change, more cur-
rent is allowed to flow to the motor. This IR sensor detects the increased current flow and sends 
a signal to the thyristor firing circuit to increase the “on” time, thereby increasing motor speed 
back to the set point, which increases the CEMF back to its original set value. IR compensation 
is typically one of the parameters set on the controller.
Many controllers have minimum and maximum speed settings. These settings are used to 
provide for safe operating limits for the motor. The minimum speed is the lowest possible speed,

even though the speed control potentiometer is set to zero or the minimum setting. This may be 
used when a process should not be allowed to completely stop even if the speed is reduced as far 
as possible. Likewise, the upper end of the speed control is often limited with a maximum speed 
adjustment. This control sets the maximum allowable speed of the motor even if the controller is 
capable of higher speeds with the speed-control potentiometer. In addition to the minimum and 
maximum speed settings, parameters control the acceleration and deceleration of the motors.
Acceleration times can be controlled by setting the ramp-up time from minimum speed 
to set speed. This feature prevents excessive current draw from the line and reduces electrical 
stress on the motor and mechanical stress on the driven equipment. Too sudden of an increase 
can cause the shaft to shear off if the mechanical load is heavy. A safety feature called an elec-
tronic shear pin is designed to monitor this type of situation. If the current increase to the motor 
is too swift, it might be an indication of a jammed motor, and the sudden increase in twisting 
effort might cause the shaft to shear. The electronic shear pin reacts to the amount—and rate—
of current increase to the motor. A smooth acceleration is controlled by gradually increasing the 
“on” time of the SCRs.
Deceleration is the gradual stopping of the motor. This time can be set to bring the motor 
from set speed to minimum speed. By slowly decreasing the “on” time of the SCRs, the motor 
slows gradually, thus reducing the mechanical stress on equipment if the motor were to come 
to an abrupt stop.
Above-normal (or base) speed can also be obtained within the mechanical limits of the 
motor by adjusting the shunt field of the motor. If the stator field is weakened, the CEMF pro-
duced by the spinning armature is also reduced. This decrease in CEMF allows more current 
to flow in the rotor. Even with a weakened field, the increased current causes a higher speed. 
This higher speed comes at the expense of lower torque. At some point, the weakened field will 
not react with the high current armature to produce enough torque to keep the motor spinning. 
There is a sudden decrease in speed because the breakdown torque point has been reached.
ELECTRICAL BRAKING
Braking of the DC motor can also be accomplished by the controller functions. Two styles of 
braking can be used: regenerative braking and dynamic braking.
Regenerative braking is a form of electrical braking that provides a reversing voltage to 
the motor while it is still attached to the spinning load (see Figure 6–17). This circuit applies 
a reverse voltage to the stator, which attempts to drive the motor in the opposite direction. As 
the rotor attempts to align with the reversed field, a countertorque is produced that brings the 
motor to a quick stop. As the motor approaches zero speed, the reversed field is removed to 
prevent the motor from actually reversing.
Dynamic braking is another form of electrical brakes. In this style of braking, a resistor is 
inserted in the circuit to act as an electrical load for the spinning armature as normal armature 
current is disconnected. The armature has inertia from the driven load and continues to spin.

The DC shunt field is maintained, and the armature now becomes a generator. If the armature 
is connected to an electrical load, the generator effects cause the rotor to slow with an electrical 
load attached. The resistor is called a dynamic braking resistor (DBR) and is a high-wattage, 
low-ohm resistor. It is usually located in a well-ventilated part of the controller so the dissipated 
heat is easily removed (see Figure 6–18).

LOAD CONSIDERATIONS
Mechanical loads are characterized by the requirements of the driven machinery. The torque 
and horsepower requirements may change with the changing speed of the motor. These 
loads are classified as (1) constant horsepower, (2) constant torque, and (3) variable torque.

The  following parameters are necessary to choose the right controller or to properly set up a 
DC drive for optimum control:
• Constant horsepower loads require more torque at low speed and less torque at high 
speed. The product of the torque times the speed must stay constant over varying 
speeds. Motor drives can be set to adjust the torque requirements based on the speed of 
the motor to produce a constant horsepower output.
• Constant torque loads have to maintain the same torque over a speed range. The horse-
power of the motor varies. To overcome a friction load, as in conveyors and extruders, 
the torque is maintained over all speeds. More horsepower is required to start the load, 
but the horsepower can be reduced as the load moves up to speed.
• Variable torque loads are loads such as fans and pumps. In this type of load, the torque 
varies as the square of the speed. As the speed of a pump or fan increases, it does more 
work and higher torque is required.
SUMMARY
DC drives have many appli-
cations and many variables 
that must be considered when 
choosing the proper drive 
for the situation. Be sure you 
understand the needs of the 
driven machinery, to deter-
mine which drive or param-
eters are important. The 
drives all work from the same 
block-equipment approach. 
The AC input is converted 
to DC for the field. The AC 
is controlled by SCRs and a 
firing control block to rectify 
the AC and control the level 
of DC voltage and current 
sent to the armature. Various 
methods are used to provide 
safety, regulation, and speed 
setting. See Figure 6–19 for 
DC drive examples.

Although manual starters are still used, most industrial applications use automatic motor 
control equipment to minimize the possibility of errors in human judgment. To install and 
maintain automatic motor control equipment, the electrician must be familiar with three kinds 
of electrical circuit diagrams:
• schematic wiring diagrams
• panel wiring diagrams
• external wiring diagrams
The electrical schematic wiring diagram uses symbols and a simple plan of connections to 
illustrate the scheme of control and the sequence of operations.
The panel wiring diagram shows the electrical connections throughout all parts of the 
controller panel and indicates the external connections. All control elements are represented by 
symbols but are located in the same relative positions on the wiring diagram that they actually 
occupy on the control panel. Because of the maze of wires shown on the panel wiring diagram, 
it is difficult to use for troubleshooting or for understanding the operation of the controller. 
For this reason, the electrical schematic wiring diagram presents the sequence of operations 
of the controller, and the panel diagram is used to locate problems and failures in the operation of 
the controller.
The external wiring diagram shows the wiring from the control panel to the motor and to 
the pushbutton stations. This diagram is most useful to the worker who installs the conduit and 
the wires between the starter panel and the control panel and motor.
CEMF METHOD OF MOTOR ACCELERATION CONTROL
The CEMF produced by the rotor is low at the instant a motor starts. As the motor accelerates, 
this CEMF increases. Refer to voltage differential in the “Starting Current and CEMF” section 
in Unit 1. The voltage across the motor armature can be used to activate relays that reduce the 
starting resistance when the proper motor speed is reached.
Starting and Running Protection for a CEMF Controller
Starting protection for a CEMF controller is provided by fuses in the motor feeder and the 
branch-circuit line of the motor circuit. These fuses are rated according to Article 430 of the 
National Electrical Code®.
Running protection for a controller, as defined in Part III of NEC® Article 430, is provided 
by an overload thermal element connected in series with the armature. The thermal element 
is rated at 115% to 125% of the full-load armature current. As covered in NEC® 430.32, if the 
current exceeds the percent of the rated armature current value, heat produced in the thermal 
element causes the bimetallic strip to open or trip the thermal contacts that are connected in the 
control circuit. The value of current during the motor start-up period does not last long enough 
to heat the thermal element sufficiently to cause it to open.

MOTOR CONTROL CIRCUIT
Starting the DC Motor
Refer to Figure 7–1. Close the main line switch before pressing the start button. After the start 
button is pressed, control relay M becomes energized. The control circuit is now complete from 
L1 through the thermal overload (OL) contacts 6–7, through the start button contacts 7–8, 
and through the normally closed stop button contacts 8–9 to L2. The lower auxiliary sealing 
 contacts 7–8 of relay M also close and bypass the start button. As a result, the start button may 
be released without disturbing the operation.

When the main contacts 2–3 of contactor M are closed, the motor armature circuit is 
complete from L1 through overload thermal element contacts 1–2, through contacts 2–3 of 
relay M, through the starting resistor, and through armature leads 4–5 to L2. The shunt field 
 circuit F1−F2 is connected in parallel with the armature circuit. Contacts 3–4 of CEMF con-
tactor A remain open at start-up because a high inrush current establishes a high voltage drop 
across resistor 3–4. This leaves only a small voltage drop across the armature and the A contac-
tor coil until acceleration is achieved. As the CEMF builds across the armature, it acts like a 
resistor that drops a larger percentage of the applied voltage, thus providing a voltage drop for 
the A coil and the A contacts 3–4 close to bypass current around the starting resistor.
Connecting the Motor across the Line
The CEMF generated in the armature is directly proportional to the speed of the motor. 
As the motor accelerates, the speed approaches the normal full speed, and the CEMF increases 
to a maximum value. Relay A is calibrated to operate at approximately 80% of the rated voltage. 
When contacts 3–4 of relay A close, the starting resistance 3–4 is bypassed, and the armature is 
connected across the line.

Refer to Figure 7–1 for the following explana-
tion. When the load current of the armature exceeds 
the rated allowable percent of the full-load current, the 
overload thermal  element (points 1–2) heats up and 
opens contacts 6–7 in the control circuit. Control relay 
M is  de-energized, and main contacts 2–3 of M open 
and disconnect the motor from the line.
Stopping the Motor
When the stop button is pressed, the control circuit is 
broken at points 8–9. The same shutdown sequence occurs as in the case of the overload condi-
tion discussed previously. The sealing circuit 7–8 is broken in each case.

Running Overload Protection
A thermal overload relay contains two circuits. One circuit is in series with the armature and 
has the armature current flowing through its thermal sensor or heating element. The second 
circuit of the overload relay is the control circuit with a control contact. If the contact opens, 
because of excessive heat in the thermal heater, the control circuit will be interrupted and stop 
the motor. A thermal overload relay unit is shown in Figure 7–2. The schematic diagram is 
shown in Figure 7–3.

The advantage of this type of automatic starter is that it does not supply full voltage across 
the armature until the speed of the motor is correct. The starter eliminates human error that 
may result from the use of a manual starter.
PANEL WIRING DIAGRAM
Figure 7–4 shows the same CEMF control circuit presented in Figure 7–l. However, the panel 
wiring diagram locates the wiring on the panel in relationship to the actual location of the 
equipment terminals on the rear of the control panel. Troubleshooting or checking original 
installations requires an accurate comparison of the elementary schematic diagrams and panel 
diagrams. The electrician should use a system of checking connections on the diagram with the 
actual panel connections. For example, a colored pencil may be used to make check marks on 
the diagram as each connection is properly traced on the panel and compared to the diagram.

DC ADJUSTABLE SPEED DRIVES
DC adjustable speed drives are available in convenient units that include all necessary control 
and power circuits.
Some machinery requirements are so precise that some AC variable frequency drives may 
not be suitable (see Unit 15). In such cases, DC motors provide characteristics that are not 
available on AC motors. A DC motor with adjustable voltage control is very versatile and can 
be adapted to a large variety of applications.
In the larger horsepower range, the motor-generator set used to be one of the most widely 
used methods of obtaining variable-speed control. The set consists of an AC motor driving a 
DC generator to supply power to a DC motor. Such motor-generator set drives, sometimes 
called Ward-Leonard systems, were used in early DC motor control and continued to be installed 
until the 1980s, to control the speed of the motor by adjusting the power supplied to the field 
of the generator, and, as a result, the output voltage to the motor (Figure 7–6). The generator 
field current can be varied with rheostats, as shown, or by variable transformers supplying a DC 
rectifier, or automatically with the use of solid-state controls. When it is desirable to control the 
motor field as well, similar means are used. Many of these systems are still in operation, but one 
is rarely installed as a new system.
The speed and torque of the system shown in Figure 7–6 can be controlled by adjust-
ing the voltage to the field, or to the armature, or both. Speeds above the motor base speed 
(nameplate speed) are obtained by weakening the motor shunt field. Speeds below the motor 
base speed are obtained by weakening the generator field. As a result, there is a decrease in the 
generator voltage supplying the DC motor armature. The motor should have a full shunt field 
for speeds lower than the base speed, to give the effect of continuous control, rather than step 
control of the motor speed.
The motor used to furnish the driving power may be a three-phase induction motor, as 
shown in Figure 7–6. After the driving motor is started, it runs continuously at a constant speed 
to drive the DC generator.
The armature of the generator is coupled electrically to the motor armature as shown. 
If the field strength of the generator is varied, the voltage from the DC generator can be con-
trolled to send any amount of current to the DC motor. As a result, the DC motor can be made 
to turn at many different speeds. Because of the inductance of the DC fields and the time 
required by the generator to build up voltage, extremely smooth acceleration is obtained from 
zero r/min to speeds greater than the base speed.
The field of the DC generator can be reversed automatically or manually, with a resulting 
reversal of the motor rotation.
The generator field resistance can be changed automatically by using SCRs (or thyris-
tors) or time-delay relays operated by a CEMF across the motor armature. The generator field 
 resistance can also be changed manually.

Electrically controlled, variable speed motor drives offer a wide choice of speed ranges, 
torque, and horsepower characteristics. They provide a means for controlling acceleration and 
deceleration, and methods of automatic or manual operation. A controlling tachometer feed-
back signal may be driven by the DC motor shaft. This is a system refinement to obtain a preset 
constant speed. This method depends on the type of application, speed, and degree of response 
desired. In addition to speed, the controlling feedback signal may be set to respond to pressure, 
tension, shock, or some other transducer function.
One of the most advantageous characteristics of the motor-generator set drive is its inher-
ent capability to regenerate. In other words, when a high-inertia load overdrives the motor, the

DC motor becomes a generator and delivers reverse power. For example, assume the DC motor 
is running at base speed. If the generator voltage is decreased by adjusting the rheostat to slow 
the motor, the motor counter-voltage will be higher than the generator voltage, and the current 
reverses. This action results in reverse torque in the motor, and the motor slows down. This 
process is called dynamic braking. This dynamic feature is very desirable when used on hoists 
for lowering heavy loads, metalworking machines, textile and paper processing machines, and 
in general industry for the controlled stopping of high-inertia loads. Multiple motor drives are 
also accomplished with this type of motor-generator drive.
Motor-generator set drives using automatic regulators have been used for years for nearly 
every type of application. A higher degree of sophistication in controls has been developed, 
making it possible to meet almost any desired level of precision or response.
STATIC MOTOR CONTROL DRIVES
Despite the previous use of the motor-generator drives, rotating machines were required to 
convert AC to mechanical power. As a result, the combined efficiency of the set is rather low; 
it requires the usual rotating machine maintenance, and it is noisy. Static DC drives now being 
used have no moving parts in the power  conversion equipment that converts (rectifies) and 
controls the AC power (Figures 7–7 and 7–8). 
The  solid-state devices are used for controlled 
conversion of AC line power to DC.
The basic theory for obtaining DC motor 
speeds below and above base speed is the same 
as with a motor-generator set. Only the method 
of controlling the voltages and field strengths dif-
fers. For example, in Figure 7–9, the armature is 
supplied with DC rectified from an AC source. 
The AC is rectified by the use of the SCR in the 
controlled circuit to obtain DC. The gate of the 
thyristor turns on the SCR at the proper portion 
of the half-wave, thereby controlling the motor 
below base speed. Figure 7–9 is a simplified circuit 
for the purpose of illustration. The field strength 
would be held at its fullest strength in a similar 
manner. For speeds above the motor base speed, 
the field control can weaken field strength with 
full armature voltage. The feedback tachometer 
maintains a preset speed.
In Figure 7–9, the SCR is controlled by 
the setting of the potentiometer, or speed control.

controlled DC motor drive.

This varies the “on” time of the thyristor per AC cycle, and thus varies the amount of average 
current flow to the armature. When speed control above the base speed is required, the rectifier 
circuit in the field is controlled by SCRs, rather than diodes.
The SCR, or thyristor, can control all the positive waveform or voltage through the use 
of a method called phase shifting. Covering the theory of the method is beyond the scope of 
this book.
The SCR is probably the most popular solid-state device for controlling large and small 
electrical power loads. The SCR is a controlled rectifier that controls an electric current. It will

not conduct when the voltage across it is in the reverse direction. 
It will conduct only in the forward direction when the proper 
signal (voltage) is applied to the gate terminal (see Figure 7–10). 
The gate is normally controlled by electronic pulses from a 
 control circuit.
The gate will turn the SCR on but will not turn it off in a 
DC circuit. To turn the anode-cathode section of the SCR on 
(close the switch), the gate must be the same polarity as the 
anode with respect to the cathode. After the gate has turned 
the SCR on, it remains on until the current flowing through the 
power circuit (anode–cathode section) is either interrupted or drops to a low enough level to 
permit the device to turn off. The anode-to-cathode current must fall below the holding current 
level. The holding current, or maintaining current, is the amount of current required to keep the 
SCR turned on. The SCR performs the same function as a rheostat would in controlling motor 
field strengths or voltage to an armature. It is similar to a variable resistance because it can be 
adjusted throughout its power range. The SCR control has replaced the rheostat because it is 
smaller in size for the same current rating, more energy efficient, and cheaper.
SUMMARY
DC motors need controls to start, stop, protect, and adjust the speed and torque of the motor. 
The systems used must comply with the NEC® and also have approval from testing firms such 
as Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. The motors must be protected from overheating and causing 
damage to the motor and the surrounding area. This unit introduced the two general styles of 
wiring diagrams: the schematic, which shows the electrical operating sequence of the compo-
nents, and the wiring diagram, which shows the physical relationship of the equipment. Motor 
generator sets were presented to familiarize you with the possible sources of DC control. At 
present, much of the control is done by solid-state DC electronic drives.

Industrial motor installations often require that motors be stopped quickly and that 
the direction of rotation be reversed immediately after stopping. To achieve this operation, 
electrically and mechanically interlocked pushbutton stations connected to relays are used to 
disconnect the armature from the supply source. The armature is then connected to a low value 
of resistance. Because the inertia of the armature and connected load causes the armature to 
continue to revolve, it acts as a loaded generator. As a result, the armature is slowed in speed. 
This action is called dynamic braking.
Reversal of motors and dynamic braking are operations used in special equipment such as 
cranes, hoists, railway cars, and elevators.
MOTOR-REVERSAL CONTROL
A DC motor is reversed by reversing the armature connections. The type of compounding is 
not affected by this method of obtaining reversal.
The pushbutton control station illustrated in Figure 8–1 is the type used for motor rever-
sal. The forward and reverse buttons are mechanically interlocked so that it is not possible to 
operate these buttons at the same time.
Description of Operation
Forward Starting. When the forward button is pressed, the nor-
mally open, forward momentary contacts close and the normally 
closed, forward momentary contacts open. The control circuit is 
shown in Figure 8–2. The forward contactor coil is energized from 
L1 through the overload contacts, stop button, forward pushbut-
ton contacts 1–2 (when closed), and reverse button  contacts 
3–4 through the forward contactor coil to L2. The  forward (F) 
 contacts are a holding circuit in the forward pushbutton. In 
the power  circuit (Figure 8–2), the F contacts of the forward 
energized contactor close and thus complete the armature cir-
cuit through the starting resistance. The normal CEMF starter 
sequence of  operations then continues to completion.
Reverse Operation. If the reverse pushbutton is pressed, 
contacts 3–4 of the reverse button open and thus de-energize 
the forward contactor coil F. In addition, the F contacts are 
opened as well as the sealing F contacts. Pressing the reverse 
button also completes the circuit of the reverse contactor coil 
(R) that closes the R contacts. The motor armature circuit is 
now complete from L1 to A2 and A1 to L2 (Figure 8–2). The 
armature connections are reversed, and the armature rotates

in the  opposite direction. It is impossible for the reverse contacts to close until the forward 
contacts are open, because of the electrical and mechanical interlocking system used in this 
type of control circuit. The mechanical interlocks are shown by the broken lines between the 
R and F coils in Figure 8–2.
Dynamic Braking
The purpose of dynamic braking is to bring a motor to a quicker stop. To do this, there must 
be a method to quickly use the mechanical energy stored in the momentum of the spinning 
armature after the main switch is opened. One method is to change the function of the motor 
to that of a generator. (A generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.) At 
the instant the motor is disconnected from the line, a resistor is connected across the motor 
armature. The resistor loads the motor as a generator, dissipates the electrical and therefore the 
 mechanical energy, and slows the motor quickly.
DYNAMIC BRAKING USED IN A CEMF CONTROLLER
As an example, the principle of dynamic braking is shown by following the steps in the  operation 
of an elementary CEMF controller (Figure 8–3).
This analysis emphasizes the dynamic braking operation rather than the details of the 
 circuit, which were presented previously. The dynamic braking magnetic (DBM) coil is 
designed so that its only function is to ensure a positive closing of the normally closed dynamic 
braking contacts 9–10. If the main coil M is energized, the dynamic braking contacts 9–10 open 
from the Normally closed condition, and contacts 8–9 of M are closed, although the dynamic 
braking coil is also energized.
When the start button is pressed, the control coil M is energized, contacts 8–9 of M close, 
and the motor starts and accelerates up to normal speed by the CEMF method. At the instant 
the M control relay is energized, the DBM coil energizes and the normally closed, dynamic 
braking contacts 9–10 open. As a result, the dynamic brake resistor (DBR) connection across 
the armature is broken.
Stopping
When the stop button is pressed, relay control coil M is de-energized, and M contacts 8–9 open 
the armature circuit, de-energize the DBM coil, and close the dynamic braking contacts 9–10. 
These contacts connect the dynamic braking resistor directly across the armature. Because 
the shunt field is still connected across the line and receiving full excitation, the high CEMF 
generated in the armature causes a high load current through the dynamic brake resistor. The 
heavy load current dissipates the stored mechanical energy in the armature acting as a heavily 
loaded generator, with the result that the motor slows to a stop. Braking action decreases as the 
armature speed decreases.

Field Discharge Resistor
When using the CEMF controller and dynamic braking, a field discharge resistor must be 
added. When the shunt field is disconnected from the supply voltage, its magnetic field begins 
to collapse. The quick collapse of the magnetic field produces a very large “inductive kick” 
 voltage—possibly thousands of volts. If it does not have a discharge path, the high voltage actu-
ally begins to break down the field winding insulation. Normally the discharge path is through

the armature, which allows a slower collapse and keeps the voltage small. A field discharge resis-
tor is a thyristor-type device that conducts when the voltage across it is high enough, but has 
a high resistance to normal line voltage. The collapsing magnetic field’s voltage can discharge 
through the field discharge resistor (FDR) without damaging the field windage.
SUMMARY
Figure 8–2 shows the reversing circuit with electrical pushbutton interlocks and mechanical 
interlocks between the forward and reverse contactor. The motor is reversed by reversing 
current flow through the armature but keeping the shunt field current in the same direction. 
Dynamic braking is used when slowing the motor. As the armature is disconnected from the 
power source, a dynamic braking resistor is connected across the armature. The armature is still 
spinning and the shunt field is still energized, so the armature acts as a generator. The resistor 
provides a current path for the generated current and slows the armature as it works as a genera-
tor. A field discharge resistor is also used to prevent the sudden collapse of the shunt field flux 
as it is disconnected from the line power.

Motor control was a simple problem when motors were used to drive a common line shaft 
to which several machines were connected. In this arrangement, it was necessary to start and 
stop only a few times daily.
With individual drives, however, the motor is an integral part of the machine, and the 
motor controller must be designed to meet the needs of the machine to which it is connected.
As a result, the modern motor controller may not just start, stop, and control the speed 
of a motor. The controller may also be required to sense a number of conditions, including 
changes in temperature, open circuits, current limitations, overload, smoke density, level of 
liquids, or the position of devices. Manual control is limited to pressing a button to start or stop 
the entire sequence of operations at the machine or from a remote location.
The electrician must know the symbols and terms used in automatic control diagrams to 
be able to wire, install, troubleshoot, and maintain automatic control equipment.
CLASSIFICATION OF AUTOMATIC CONTROLLERS
Purpose
Factors to be considered when selecting motor controllers include the required types of start-
ing, stopping, reversing, running, and controlling speed and sequence. Other factors that influ-
ence the selection of a controller include the electrical service, environmental conditions, and 
electrical codes and standards.
Operation
The motor may be controlled directly or manually by an operator using a switch or a drum con-
troller. Remote control uses contactors, relays, pushbuttons, sensors, and possibly electronics.
CONTACTORS
Contactors, or relays (Figure 9–1 and Figure 9–2), are required in automatic controls to trans-
mit varying conditions in one circuit in order to influence the operation of other devices in the 
same or another electrical circuit. Relays have been designed to respond to one or more of the 
following conditions:
voltage
overvoltage
undervoltage
current
overcurrent
undercurrent
current direction
differential current
power (watts)
power direction
volt-amperes
frequency

Magnetic switches are widely used in controllers because they can be used with remote 
control and are economical and safe.
A relay or contactor usually has a coil that can be energized to close or open contacts in 
an electrical circuit. The coil and contacts of a relay are represented by symbols on the circuit 
diagram or schematic of a controller. Symbols commonly used to represent contactor elements 
are shown in Figure 9–3.
If the control coil is connected in series in the motor power circuit, the heavy line symbol 
shown at the left of Figure 9–3 is used. If the coil is connected in parallel (shunt), the light line 
symbol is used.
A series coil has a large current-carrying conductor with few turns designed to carry large 
currents. A shunt coil has a small wire size with many turns; it carries small currents. It is pos-
sible for a series coil and a shunt coil to have the same ampere turns, producing similar magnetic 
results.

Contacts that are open when the coil is de-energized are known as normally open con-
tacts and are indicated by two short parallel lines. Contacts that are closed when the coil is 
de-energized are called normally closed contacts and are indicated by a slanted line drawn across 
the parallel lines.
To minimize heavy arcing that burns the contacts, a DC contactor usually is equipped 
with a blowout coil and an arc chute. Figure 9–4 shows a magnetic contactor that is provided with 
a blowout coil and an arc chute.
As the contacts move apart, an arc is established between the contact points. The 
arc is still conducting current and acts like a conductor. If a conductor is placed in a 
magnetic field, it tries to move out of the magnetic field (motor action). Figure 9–5(A) 
shows that the current is still flowing through the magnetic blowout coil to the arc. This 
current in the blowout coil creates a magnetic field as long as there is current in the arc. 
The magnetic field deflects the arc away from the contact surfaces, elongates the arc, and 
“blows” it into the arc chute to be extinguished. As soon as the arc is stretched far enough 
and broken into small segments, the current flow is interrupted and the blowout coil has 
no more current and no magnetic effect. Figure 9–5(B) shows a contact without blowout 
coils. In this case, the arc is allowed to stretch and rise through thermal action. As it rises, 
it is elongated and finally breaks apart at the tip of the arc horns rather than burning the 
contact closure surface.
FIGURE 9–4 Magnetic blowout coils magnetically move the arc away from the contacts.

PUSHBUTTONS
Pushbutton stations (Figure 9–6) are spring-controlled switches, which, when pushed, are used 
to complete motor or motor control circuits. Figure 9–6(B) shows multiple control stations 
with pushbuttons, selector switches, and pilot indicating lights. Note the “mushroom” stop but-
ton for easy emergency access. This is often referred to as an E stop, short for “emergency stop.”

The symbols used in schematic drawings to represent momentary pushbutton contacts 
are provided in Figure 9–7. Contacts can either be normally open or normally closed. This is 
the normal condition when there is no mechanical actuation of the contacts. In the pushbut-
tons shown in Figure 9–7, the contacts are referred to as momentary contacts. This simply means 
that the contacts change from their normal condition to the opposite condition momentarily 
when mechanical actuation is applied, and then change back to the normal condition when the 
actuator is removed. Some contacts are designated as maintained contacts. This means that the 
contacts stay as activated (held mechanically) until returned to their original position.

TYPICAL CONTROL CIRCUIT
Figure 9–8 shows an elementary control circuit with momentary start and stop buttons and a seal-
ing, or “holding,” circuit. The typical control circuit uses an electromagnetic coil to move sets of con-
tacts. The contacts move to open and close the power circuit to the motor and also to open and close 
contacts in the control circuit. The control contacts provide a holding circuit in parallel to the start 
momentary contacts. This parallel circuit is referred to as the sealing circuit or holding circuit. It seals 
a current path around the normally open start button contacts. The circuit operation is as follows:
 
1. When the start button is pressed to close contacts 2–3, current flows from L1 
through normally closed contacts 1–2 of the stop button, through the closed 
c ontacts 2–3 of the start button, and through coil M to line L2.
 
2. The current in coil M causes the contact M to close. Thus, the holding circuit 
around contacts 2–3 of the start button closes. The start button may now be 
released, and even though the spring of the pushbutton opens contacts 2–3, coil

M remains energized and holds contacts M closed to maintain a holding circuit 
around the normally open contacts 2–3 of the start button. Coil M, being ener-
gized, also closes M contacts in the power circuit to the motor (not shown).
 
3. If the stop button is momentarily pressed, the circuit is interrupted at 
 contacts 1–2, and coil M is de-energized. Contacts M then open, and coil M 
 cannot be re- energized until the start button again closes contacts 2–3.
SCADA AND HMI
SCADA, or supervisory control and data acquisition, also sometimes known as supervisory 
calculation and data analysis, is a system that uses input and output data from real-world pro-
cesses and machinery interfaces. These data that are sent to the processors, usually through a 
programmable logic controller (PLC), are used to monitor, control, and affect the output of 
the PLC to determine control operations. The PLC operates to control the output functions 
with predetermined programs and therefore monitors and controls the assigned process. In 
order for humans to interact with the processor, some method of communication is needed. 
Typically this interface to the PLC started out as a program panel, but more recently a per-
sonal computer has been used. The personal computer is still used to design and develop 
the  operating program, but the monitoring and changes to the operations can be processed 
through the human machine interface (HMI). The HMI, as seen in Figure 9–9, is a  real-time 
FIGURE 9–9 Human machine interface (HMI) screen to interact with 
control systems.

interface to the data acquisition system and a control point so the human operators can 
change operations based on their decisions.
Often the data are acquired over networks to provide the inputs to the SCADA system. If 
terminals are used for the interface, they are often referred to as remote terminal units (RTUs). 
In most cases, SCADA systems run without human intervention as automatic controls or 
monitoring systems for automatic systems, and the RTU is used for reference and control only 
if needed. In the event that more human control is desired or needed, the current trend is to use 
HMIs as interfaces to the control system. The HMI can be connected to the RTU or the PLC 
to take data and display them in different format.
An HMI can be a control panel with hard button interfaces to change operations of the 
PLC and therefore the process. The buttons may have multiple functions depending on which 
program the human operator chooses. The current trend is to make the control buttons as 
virtual controls that are programmable and can respond to the touch screen of the HMI inter-
face. In this case, the operations are displayed as graphical elements and the controls can be 
programmed to respond when people simply touch the screen at the point where they want to 
make a change or analyze the process. See Figure 9–10.
SCADA systems, RTUs, and HMIs have become more reliable and more dependable. 
Some automatic safety systems and emergency stop systems have been approved as SCADA 
systems without the need for redundant hardwired systems. The SCADA and HMIs are typi-
cally linked to a historical data system that allows the operators to see data trends and failure 
modes and track maintenance requirements as a result of equipment wear or sensor breakdown. 
The manufacturing and materials-handling industries can predict maintenance with great cer-
tainty and help with failure analysis based on the SCADA systems.

SCADA connections and RTUs and HMIs are increasingly being connected through 
 systems that use an open protocol. This means that each individual manufacturer no longer has 
a specific protocol base that allows only specific compatible hardware to be connected. This was 
done in the past to force end users to buy from a specific supplier if they wanted the systems 
to “talk” to each other. Current systems allow competitors to connect to each other’s systems, 
thereby allowing the end users to pick the most effective system to meet their needs. The 
 perceived drawback of open protocol may be that more people can tie into the networks and 
wreak havoc with critical processes either on purpose or by accident. The fact that major sys-
tems such as power plant control or water treatment facilities control could become v ulnerable 
to  malicious intent is of concern.
SUMMARY
The basic automatic control circuit is used to control larger motors through electromagnetic 
relays. This allows the operation to be remotely located and the contactor to be located near the 
motor. The basic principle uses a momentary-contact switch to close a circuit to a magnetically 
operated relay.

RELAYS
Relays are devices used to relay or multiply control signals or electrical contact closures. The 
relay concept is used where a small voltage at low current operates a set of electrical contacts 
to an open or closed position. This contact operation in turn controls a larger electric load as it 
relays the electrical operations.
Another common use of a relay is to multiply a single signal to open or close multiple 
contacts to control multiple electrical loads.
ELECTROMECHANICAL RELAYS
Electromechanical relays, contactors, and motor starters basically operate by the same 
 principles. These electrically operated switches respond to the electromagnetic attraction of an 
energized coil of wire mounted on an iron core. The devices differ in the amount of current that 
each associated contact must switch. The relay—which can be compared to an amplifier—is 
usually used to switch small amounts of currents (usually 0–15 amperes) in many control cir-
cuits (Figure 10–1). Uses of relays include switching (on and off) larger coils of motor starters, 
contactors, solenoids, heating elements, and small motors. Other uses are alarm systems and 
pilot light control. Relays have many industrial and commercial  applications, both AC and DC.
A small current flow and/or low voltage applied to a relay coil can result in a much 
larger current or voltage being switched. One input signal (voltage) may control several output 
(switched) circuits (Figure 10–2).
The coil voltage of the relay is separate or different from those at the switched contacts; 
this is called separate control. However, the coil voltage may be the same system voltage as the 
switched voltage.

plastic enclosures, shown in Figure 10–3. The general construction of a typical relay is shown 
in Figure 10–4.
Note in Figure 10–2 that relay contacts may be normally closed or normally open. The 
action of the contacts is to switch something “on” or “off” depending on the configuration.

SOLID-STATE RELAY (SSR)
A solid-state relay (SSR) can be used to control most of the circuits that the electromechanical 
relay controls. By comparison, the SSR has no coil or contacts. The semiconductor industry has 
developed solid-state components with unusual applications to the industrial control processes. 
These components are compact, versatile, and very reliable if used in the proper application.
The silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) is probably the most popular solid-state device for 
controlling large and small electrical power loads. Basically, the SCR either conducts or does 
not conduct an electric current. When it is not conducting, the SCR offers almost a complete 
blockage to the current. It passes only a few milliamperes to the load. For this reason, some 
manufacturers place contacts from electrically operated contactors in the total circuit to discon-
nect the load completely.
The SCR will not conduct when the voltage across it is in the reverse direction. It conducts 
only in the forward direction when the proper signal (voltage) is applied to the gate terminal 
(Figure 10–5). Once it is conducting, the SCR cannot be turned off  immediately. It is necessary 
only to provide a small signal to start the SCR conducting a current. It  continues to conduct 
even without a signal from that point on, as long as the current is in the forward direction. The 
only way to stop the SCR from conducting is to reduce the current flow below the holding cur-
rent level or disconnect it from the system. On AC, of course, this happens every half cycle, so 
this characteristic is no problem (Figure 10–6). For DC applications, the voltage is reduced to 
zero by interrupting the circuit, generally with a contact on an electromagnetic relay.
Figure 10–7 shows a typical SSR. Note the input and switched output terminal connec-
tions. Figure 10–8 shows these connections completed. Terminal wiring is very simple and 
consists of two input control wires and two output load wires. The connecting terminals are 
clearly identified on SSRs (as they are on electromechanical relays). The relay in Figure 10–8 has 
a light-emitting diode (LED) connected to the input or control voltage. When the input voltage 
turns the LED on, a photodetector connected to the gate of the TRIAC turns the TRIAC on and 
connects the load to the line. This optical coupling is commonly used with SSRs. These relays are 
referred to as being optoisolated. This means that the load side of the relay is optically isolated from 
the control side of the relay. The control medium is a light beam. No voltage spikes or electrical 
noise produced on the load side of the relay is therefore transmitted to the control side.

SSRs have a wide range of input or control voltage designs. The SSRs may oper-
ate at TTL (transistor–transistor logic) levels plus 5 volts DC. They may  operate at 
levels between 3 and 30 volts DC or other relays at between 90 and 120 volts AC. 
Considerations as to what style of relay include the way that the SSRs turn on.
SSRs are available with a design to match the requirements of the application. An SSR 
with zero switching capability is used for resistive, inductive, and capacitive loads. Zero switch-
ing refers to when the SSR’s output is activated. When the control signal voltage is applied, the 
SSR output turns on at the first zero crossing of the line voltage; therefore, the response time is 
typically less than a half cycle. These are the most commonly used SSRs.
Analog switching is used for resistive loads. The input control can be varied from 4 to 20 
milliamps (mA). This SSR can then perform phase control when the output is controlled by 
adjusting the input voltage and controlling the “on” time of the load. These SSRs can be used to 
reduce inrush currents or to control heating elements for precise heat requirements.
Analog full-cycle switching is also used for resistive loads. This SSR responds to 4–20 mA 
or 1–10 volts DC control values. A low value of input control turns on the output and leaves it 
on for a specific number of output cycles. A high value of input turns on the output for a full 
“on” state of the load. These relays are used for analog control of heating elements with varying 
input values. Instant on switching is used for inductive loads. The SSR is immediately and fully 
“on” after application of the control voltage. The output turns on anywhere during the cycle, 
and the response time is typically less than 1 millisecond. This relay is used to control solenoids 
or coils where immediate response is needed. Peak switching is used for heavy industrial loads 
such as transformer loads. The output will turn on at the first AC peak value after application 
of the control voltage. The last switching state is a DC switching SSR. The application of a DC 
input turns on the DC voltage output. The relay is used for controlling DC loads. When this 
relay is used for coil loads, such as DC motors and coils, then an inductive-kick protection diode 
is needed to prevent damage to the relay when the load is switched off.
TIMERS
Timers come in many styles and with different operating characteristics. Mechanical timers use 
either clock motors to operate a mechanical trip mechanism or solenoids to create timing opera-
tions. Pneumatic timers use air, a diaphragm, and an operating solenoid to cause a time delay.

Figure 10–9 shows a mechanical time-clock type of timer. This type of timer is used for rough 
time-of-day timing to turn lights or equipment on or off at an approximate time of day. Tabs on 
the face of the clock are moved to create different on and off periods.
Pneumatic timers such as that in Figure 10–10 were typically used for “on” or “off” delay 
operations. The symbols shown in Figure 10–11 depict the type of timer operation and the oper-
ation of the contacts. In on-delay timers (time delay on energization, TDE), the contacts stay 
in their original position until a solenoid plunger has moved through its entire travel distance. 
The travel time is controlled by adjusting a needle valve to allow the air to escape in front of the 
solenoid diaphragm. The timer solenoid has power applied to pull the plunger into its timed-out 
position. The contacts can start as either normally open or normally closed and will change to 
the opposite position at the end of the time, if power is still applied to the solenoid coil.

The off-delay timer (time delay on de-energization, TDD) acts in the opposite mode. In 
other words, the timing change to the contacts takes place when the power is removed from the 
timer coil and the solenoid plunger is allowed to go back to its de-energized position. The time 
that it takes the solenoid to return to its original position is controlled by the needle valve allow-
ing air to return to the vacuum side of the air diaphragm. Figure 10–11 shows the TDD contacts 
in their normal, timed-out state. When power is applied to the timing coil in this type of timer, 
the contacts change to the opposite state and time out to return to the original designation.
Solid-state timers are now commonly used to provide highly accurate and an extremely 
wide range of timing operations. Many of the timers, such as the one in Figure 10–12, can be 
used as on-delays or off-delays and have several trigger modes. They can also provide a wide 
range of timing, from milliseconds to hundreds of hours. The timing is accomplished with elec-
tronics, which makes them accurate and precise.
Electronic timers come in four basic design capacities. On-delay timers provide tim-
ing functions just as the electromechanical timers do, but with a higher degree of accuracy

and repeatability. Off-delay timers also provide the timing function after the control signal is 
removed, as does the electromechanical timer. Interval timers are also called one-shot timers. With 
this timing sequence, the contact closure, whether dry contact or electronic conduction, occurs 
immediately after the control signal is applied. After a preset time, the contact reverts to its origi-
nal condition and the timer waits for another signal to change its output again. The last type of 
timer is called a recycler timer. This timer cycles its output contact open and closed for preset 
intervals until the control signal is removed from the input. Symmetrical timers have equal on 
and off times for the output contacts as long as the input signal is present. The asymmetrical 
timer has adjustable times for the on and off portion of the output closure. See Figure 10–13 for 
the various individual solid-state timers. Some electronic timers are able to provide all these var-
ious functions within a single relay. The relay is microprocessor driven and fully programmable.

SUMMARY
Relays are used to control various loads from other electrical circuits. They may be used to oper-
ate large values of DC or AC power or simply multiply the electrical circuit function. Contacts 
can be normally open (NO) or normally closed (NC) or convertible from one form to another.
Things to consider when ordering include
• control voltage and value.
• contact ratings in current and voltage, number of contacts, NO, NC, or SPDT, and so on.
• whether open contacts, enclosed contacts, or solid-state, no-contact movement are 
important.
• whether the relay needs very fast speed as in SSRs or whether physical isolation is more 
important as in electromechanical relays.

OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS
The three-phase AC induction motor is relatively small in physical size for a given horsepower rating 
when compared with other types of motors. The squirrel-cage induction motor has very good speed 
regulation under varying load conditions. Because of its rugged construction and r eliable operation, 
the three-phase AC induction motor is widely used for many industrial  applications (Figure 12–1).
FIGURE 12–1 Three-phase motors used for a pumping 
application.
© Cengage Learning 2014
CONSTRUCTION DETAILS
The three-phase AC induction motor normally consists of a stator, a rotor, and two end shields 
housing the bearings that support the rotor shaft.
A minimum of maintenance is required with this type of motor because
• The rotor windings are shorted to form a squirrel cage.
• There are no commutator or slip rings to service (compared to the DC motor).
• There are no brushes to replace.

The motor frame is usually made of cast steel. The stator core is pressed directly into the 
frame. The two end shields housing the bearings are bolted to the cast steel frame. The bear-
ings that support the rotor shaft are either sleeve bearings or ball bearings. Figure 12–2 is a 
cutaway view of an assembled motor. Figure 12–3 illustrates the main parts of a three-phase AC 
 induction motor.
Stator
A typical stator contains a three-phase winding mounted in the slots of a laminated steel core 
(Figure 12–4). The winding itself consists of formed coils of wire connected so that three 
single-phase windings are spaced 120 electrical degrees apart. The three separate single-phase 
windings are then connected, usually internally, in either wye or delta. Three or nine leads from 
the three-phase stator windings are brought out to a terminal box mounted on the frame of the 
motor for single- or dual-voltage connections.
Rotor
The revolving part of the motor consists of steel punchings or laminations arranged in a cylin-
drical core (Figures 12–5, 12–6, and 12–7). Copper or aluminum bars are mounted near the 
surface of the rotor. The bars are brazed or welded to two copper end rings to form a short

circuit for the rotor bars. In some small squirrel-cage induction motors, the bars and end rings 
are cast in one piece from aluminum.
Figure 12–5 shows such a rotor. Note that fins are cast into the rotor to circulate air and 
cool the motor while it is running. Note also that the rotor bars between the rings are skewed 
at an angle to the faces of the rings. Because of this design, the running motor is quieter and 
smoother in operation. A keyway is visible on the left end of the shaft. A pulley or load shaft 
coupling can be secured using this keyway.
Shaft Bearings
Typical sleeve bearings are shown in Figure 12–8 and Figure 12–9. The inside walls of the 
sleeve bearings are made of a babbitt metal that provides a smooth, polished, and long-wear-
ing surface for the rotor shaft. A large, oversized oil slinger ring fits loosely around the rotor 
shaft and extends down into the oil reservoir. This ring picks up and slings oil on the rotat-
ing shaft and bearing surfaces. Two oil rings are shown in Figure 12–10. This lubricating oil

film minimizes friction losses. An oil inspection 
cup on the side of each end shield enables mainte-
nance personnel to check the level of the oil in the 
sleeve bearing.
Figures 12–11, 12–12, 12–13, and 12–14 
illustrate ball bearing units. In many motors, ball 
bearings are used instead of sleeve bearings. Grease 
rather than oil is used to lubricate ball bearings. 
This type of bearing usually is two-thirds full of 
grease at the time the motor is assembled. Special 
fittings are provided on the end bells so that a 
grease gun can be used to apply additional lubricant 
to the ball bearing units at periodic intervals.
When lubricating roller bearings, remove 
the bottom plug so that the old grease is forced 
out. Consult the manufacturer’s specifications 
for the motor for the lubricant grade recom-
mended, the lubrication procedure, and the 
 bearing loads.

PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION OF A SQUIRREL-CAGE MOTOR
As stated in the previous discussion of stator construction, the slots of the stator core contain 
three separate single-phase windings. When three currents 120 electrical degrees apart pass 
through these windings, a rotating magnetic field results. This field travels around the inside 
of the stator core. The speed of the rotating magnetic field depends on the number of stator 
poles and the frequency of the power source. This speed is called the synchronous speed and is 
determined by the following formula:
RPM = 120 × f
p
120 × 60
6
 = 
 = 1200 RPM 
RPM = Synchronous speed
f = Hertz (frequency)
p = Number of stator poles per phase
● Example 1:   If a three-phase AC induction motor has six poles on the stator winding and 
is connected to a three-phase, 60-hertz source, then the synchronous speed 
of the revolving field is 1200 revolutions per minute (RPM).
As this magnetic field rotates at synchronous speed, it cuts the copper bars of the rotor 
and induces voltages in the bars of the squirrel-cage winding. These induced voltages set up 
currents in the rotor bars, which in turn create a field in the rotor core. This rotor field reacts 
with the stator field to cause a twisting effect, or torque, which turns the rotor. The rotor always 
turns at a speed slightly less than the synchronous speed of the stator magnetic field. This means 
that the stator magnetic field will always cut the rotor bars. If the rotor were to turn at the same 
speed as the stator field, the stator field would not cut the rotor bars and there would be no 
induced voltage or torque.
Speed Regulation and Percent Slip
The squirrel-cage induction motor has very good speed regulation characteristics (the ratio 
of difference in speed from no load to full load). Speed performance is measured in terms of 
percent slip. The synchronous speed of the rotating field of the stator is used as a reference 
point. Recall that the synchronous speed depends on the number of stator poles and the 
operating frequency. Because these two quantities remain constant, the synchronous speed 
also remains constant. If the speed of the rotor at full load is deducted from the synchro-
nous speed of the stator field, the difference is the number of revolutions per minute that

the rotor slips behind the rotating field of the stator. The value is expressed as percent slip 
according to the following formula:
Percent slip = 
Synchronous speed − Rotor speed
Synchronous speed
× 100
● Example 2:   If the three-phase AC induction motor used in Example 1 has a synchro-
nous speed of 1200 RPM and a full-load speed of 1140 RPM, find the 
percent of slip.
Synchronous speed (Example 1) = 1200 RPM
Full-load rotor speed = 1140 RPM
Percent slip = 5%
Percent slip = 1200 − 1140
1200
× 100
Percent slip = 
60
1200
× 100 = 0.05 × 100
Percent slip = 
Synchronous speed − Rotor speed
Synchronous speed
× 100
For a squirrel-cage induction motor, as the value of percent slip decreases toward 0%, the 
speed performance of the motor is improved. The average range of percent slip for squirrel-cage 
induction motors is 2% to 6%.
Figure 12–15 shows a speed curve and a percent slip for a squirrel-cage induction motor 
operating between no load and full load. The rotor speed at no load slips behind the synchro-
nous speed of the rotating stator field just enough to create the torque required to overcome 
friction and windage losses at no load. As a mechanical load is applied to the motor shaft, the 
rotor tends to slow down. This means that the stator field (turning at a fixed speed) cuts the 
rotor bars a greater number of times in a given period. The induced voltages in the rotor bars 
increase, resulting in more current in the rotor bars and a stronger rotor field. A greater magnetic 
reaction between the stator and rotor fields exists, which causes a stronger twisting effect, or 
torque. This also increases stator current taken from the line. The motor is able to handle the 
increased mechanical load with very little decrease in the speed of the rotor.
Typical slip-torque curves for a squirrel-cage induction motor are shown in Figure 12–16. 
The torque output of the motor in pound-feet (lb-ft) increases linearly with an increase in the

value of percent slip as the mechanical load is increased to the point of full load. Beyond full 
load, the torque curve bends and finally reaches a maximum point called the breakdown torque. 
If the motor is loaded beyond this point, there will be a corresponding decrease in torque until 
the point is reached where the motor stalls. However, all induction motors must have some slip 
in order to function. Starting torque is not shown, but is approximately 300% of running torque 
for a generic AC motor.

Starting Current
When a three-phase AC induction motor is connected across the full line voltage, the start-
ing surge of current momentarily reaches as high as 400% to 1000% or more of the rated 
full-load current. At the moment the motor starts, the rotor is at a standstill. At this instant, 
therefore, the stator field cuts the rotor bars at a faster rate than when the rotor is turning. 
This means that there will be relatively high induced voltages in the rotor, which cause heavy 
rotor current. The resulting input current to the stator windings is high at the instant of start-
ing. Because of this high starting current, starting protection rated as high as 300% of the 
rated full-load current for nontime-delay fuses is provided for squirrel-cage induction motor 
installations.
Most squirrel-cage induction motors are started at full voltage. If there are any questions 
concerning starting large motors at full voltage, the electric utility company should be con-
sulted. In the event that the feeders and protective devices of the electric utility are unable to 
handle the large starting currents, reduced voltage starting circuits must be used with the motor. 
(See Unit 14.)
Power Factor
The power factor of a squirrel-cage induction motor is poor at no-load and light-load condi-
tions. At no load, the power factor can be as low as 15% lagging. However, as load is applied to 
the motor, the power factor increases. At the rated load, the power factor may be as high as 85% 
to 90% lagging.
The power factor at no load is low because the magnetizing component of input current 
is a large part of the total input current of the motor. When the load on the motor is increased, 
the in-phase current supplied to the motor increases, but the magnetizing component of current 
remains practically the same. This means that the resultant line current is more nearly in phase 
with the voltage and the power factor is improved when the motor is loaded, compared with an 
unloaded motor.
Figure 12–17 shows the increase in power factor from a no-load condition to full load. In 
the no-load diagram, the in-phase current (IW) is small when compared to the magnetizing cur-
rent IM; thus, the power factor is poor at no load. In the full-load diagram, the in-phase current 
has increased while the magnetizing current remains the same. As a result, the angle of lag of the 
line current decreases and the power factor increases.
Reversing Rotation
The direction of rotation of a three-phase induction motor can be readily reversed. The motor 
rotates in the opposite direction if any two of the three line leads are reversed (Figure 12–18). 
The leads are reversed at the motor.

Speed Control
A squirrel-cage induction motor has almost no speed variations without external controls. 
Recall that the speed of the motor depends on the frequency of the three-phase source and the 
number of poles of the stator winding.
The frequency of the supply line is usually 60 hertz in the United States, and is maintained 
at this value by the local power utility company. Because the number of poles in the motor is 
also a fixed value, the synchronous speed of the motor remains constant. As a result, obtaining 
a range of speed without changing the applied frequency is impossible. It can be controlled by a 
variable frequency AC electronic drive system or by changing the number of poles using exter-
nal controllers. See Unit 14 on electronic frequency control.
INDUCTION MOTORS WITH DUAL-VOLTAGE CONNECTIONS
Many three-phase AC induction motors are designed to operate at two different voltage ratings. 
For example, a typical dual-voltage rating for a three-phase motor is 240/480 volts.
Figure 12–19 shows a typical wye-connected stator winding that can be used for either 
240 volts, three phase, or 480 volts, three phase. Each of the three single-phase windings con-
sists of two coil windings. Nine leads are brought out externally from this type of stator winding. 
These leads, identified as leads 1 to 9, end in the terminal box of the motor. To mark the termi-
nals, start at the upper-left terminal T1 and proceed in a clockwise direction in a spiral toward 
the center, marking each lead as indicated in the figure.
Figure 12–20 shows the connections required to operate a motor from a 480-volt, three-
phase source. The two coils of each single-phase winding are connected in series. Figure 12–21 
shows the connections to permit operation from a 240-volt, three-phase source.

Wye- or Star-Connected Motors
If the lead identifications of a nine-lead (dual-voltage), three-phase, wye-connected motor have 
been destroyed, the electrician must reidentify them before connecting the motor to the line. 
The following method may be used. First, identify the internally connected common point by 
checking for continuity between three of the leads as in Figure 12–22(A).
Then identify the three other sets of coils by continuity between two leads at a time, 
shown in Figure 12–22(B). Assign T7, T8, and T9 to any of the three leads of the permanent 
star-connected coils (A). Apply the lower-rated line voltage for the motor to T7, T8, and T9, 
and operate to check the direction of rotation. Disconnect line voltage and connect one of the 
undetermined coils to T7. Reconnect power, leaving the lines on T7, T8, and T9. If the coil is 
correctly connected and is the proper coil, the voltage should be about 1.5 times the line voltage 
between the loose end and the other two lines. Be careful of line voltage.
If the correct coil is selected but reversed, the voltage between the loose end and 
the other two leads will be about 58% of the line voltage. If the wrong coil is selected, the 
voltage differences between the loose end and the other two line leads will be uneven. See 
Figure 12–22(C).
When the readings are even and approximately 1.5 times the line voltage, mark the lead 
connected to T7 as T4 and other end of the coil as T1.
Perform the same tests with another coil connected to T8. Mark these leads T5 and T2. 
Perform the same test with the last coil connected to T9 to identify the T3 and T6 leads.
Connect L1 to T1, L2 to T2, L3 to T3, T4 to T7, T5 to T8, T6 to T9, and then operate the 
motor. The motor should operate quietly in the same direction as before.
Delta-Connected Motors
Another connection pattern for three-phase motors is the delta-connected motor. It is so named 
because the resulting schematic pattern looks like the Greek letter delta (Δ). A method of iden-
tifying and connecting these leads is necessary because this pattern is different from the star- or 
wye-connected motor.
Properly connecting the leads of a delta-connected, three-phase, dual-voltage motor pres-
ents a problem if the lead markings are destroyed.
First, the electrician must determine whether the motor is delta connected or star con-
nected. Both motors have nine leads if they are dual-voltage motors. However, the delta- con-
nected motor has three sets of three leads that have continuity, and the star-connected motor 
has only one set of three.
After it is determined that the motor is delta connected, a sensitive ohmmeter is needed to 
find the middle of each group of three leads. The ohm values are low when using the DC power 
of an ohmmeter, so use care in identifying the center of each coil group. Label the center of each

group T1, T2, and T3, respectively. Using masking tape, temporarily label the other leads of the 
T1 group as T4 and T9 (see Figure 12–23).
Temporarily mark the ends of the T2 group as T5 and T7, and mark the ends of the T3 
group as T6 and T8.
Connect the lower motor voltage rating using lines 1, 2, and 3 to T1, T4, and T9. The other 
coils will have induced voltage, so be careful not to touch the other loose leads to each other or 
to yourself!
Disconnect the power and connect the lead marked T4 to T7. Reconnect the power 
as before and read the voltage between T1 and T2. If the markings are correct, the voltage 
should be about twice the applied line voltage. If it reads about 1.5 times the line voltage, 
reconnect T4 to the lead marked T5. If the voltage T1 to T2 then goes to line voltage, recon-
nect T9 to T7, thereby reversing both coils. When the voltage T1 to T2 equals twice the 
applied line voltage, mark the leads connected together as T4 from the T1 group connected 
to T7 of the T2 group.
Now use the third coil group. Leave the lower line voltage connected to the first group as 
before. Test and connect the leads so that when T9 is connected to a lead of the third group, the 
T1-to-T3 voltage is twice the applied line voltage. Mark the lead connected to T9 as T6 and the 
other end of the coil group as T8.

To double-check, disconnect the line lead from T9 and reconnect it to T7; disconnect 
the line lead from T1 and reconnect it to T2; disconnect the line lead from T4 and reconnect 
it to T5. The motor should run in the same direction as before. If it does not, recheck the lead 
markings.
To check further, move the line leads from T7 to T8, from T5 to T6, and from T2 to T3. 
Start the motor. Rotation should be the same as in the previous steps. Be careful! Voltage is 
induced into other windings. (See Figure 12–24.)
MOTOR NAMEPLATES
Motor nameplates provide information vital to the proper selection and installation of the 
motor. Most useful data given on the nameplate refer to the electrical characteristics of the 
motor. Given this information and using the National Electrical Code®, the electrician can 
determine the conduit, wire, and starting and running protection sizes. (The NEC® provides 
minimum requirements.)
The design and performance data on the nameplate are useful to maintenance  personnel. 
The information is vital for the fast and proper replacement of the motor, if necessary.

For a  better understanding of the motor, typical information found on motor nameplates is 
described here (Figure 12–25):
• The manufacturer’s name can be found on the nameplate.
• Type identifies the type of the enclosure. This is the manufacturer’s coded identification 
system.
• Serial number is the specific motor identification. This is the individual number assigned 
to the motor, similar to a social security number for a person. It is kept on file by the 
manufacturer.
• The model number is an additional manufacturer’s identification, commonly used for 
ordering purposes.
• Frame size identifies the measurements of the motor.
• Service factor (or SF). An SF of 1.0 means the motor should not be expected to deliver 
more than its rated horsepower. The motor will operate safely if it is run at the rated 
horsepower times the SF, maximum. Common SFs are 1.0 to 1.15. It is recommended 
that the motor not be run continuously in the SF range. This may shorten the life expec-
tancy of the insulation system.
• Amperes means the current drawn from the line when the motor is operating at rated 
voltage and frequency at the fully rated nameplate horsepower.
• Volts should be the value measured at the motor terminals and for which the motor is 
designed.
• The class of insulation refers to the insulating material used in winding the motor sta-
tor. For example, in a Class B system, the maximum operating temperature is 130°C

(266°F); for Class F, it is 155°C (311°F); and for Class H, it is 180°C (356°F). This is 
the maximum temperature of the motor coil.
• RPM means the speed in revolutions per minute when all other nameplate conditions 
are met.
• Hertz is the frequency of the electric power system for which the motor is designed. 
Performance will be altered if it is operated at other frequencies.
• Duty is the cycle of operation at which the motor can safely operate. “Continuous” 
means that the motor can operate fully loaded 24 hours a day. If “intermediate” is 
shown, a time interval also appears. This means the motor can operate at full load for 
the specified period. The motor should then be stopped and allowed to cool before 
starting again.
• Ambient temperature specifies the maximum surrounding air temperature at which the 
motor can operate to deliver the rated horsepower.
• Phase indicates the number of voltage phases at which the motor is designed to 
operate.
• kVA is a code letter that indicates the locked rotor kVA per horsepower. This is used to 
determine starting equipment and protection for the motor. A code letter table is found 
in NEC® 430.7(B).
• Efficiency is expressed as a percentage. This value is found on standard motors as well as 
“premium efficiency” motors.
• Noise. Some motors are designed for low noise emission. The noise level given on the 
nameplate is measured in “dBA” units of sound.
• Manufacturer’s notes list specific features of the motors, such as “thermal protected” and/
or “scaled bearings.”
• Design letter is a manufacturer’s coded letter for the motor design that affects operating 
characteristics. Five standard classifications are designs A, B, C, D, and E. Each design 
has a special speed versus torque curve and is used for different applications. Design B is 
the most common.
ALTITUDE
Manufacturers’ guarantees for standard motor ratings are usually based on operation at any 
altitude up to 3300 ft. Motors suitable for operation at an altitude higher than 3300 ft above 
sea level are of special design and/or have a different insulation class. For example, standard 
motors with an SF of 1.15 may be operated up to an altitude of 9900 ft by reducing the SF. 
At an altitude of 9900 ft, the SF would be 1.00. It may be necessary to derate the motor or use 
a larger frame size.

SUMMARY
Three-phase AC induction motors use a squirrel-cage winding in the rotor. There are no electri-
cal connections to the rotor, but current is induced into the rotor windings by electromagnetic 
induction. The squirrel-cage winding produces a magnetic field that is pushed and pulled by 
the stator magnetic field.
The rotor is supported by a steel shaft that must rotate. The shaft is allowed to rotate with 
the application of different types of bearings and various lubrications. Synchronous speed, 
speed regulation, and percent slip are all calculations used in determining the speed of the rotor. 
Motor electrical characteristics such as power factor and starting current are related to the elec-
trical design of the motor.
If motor lead markings are destroyed, the leads can be remarked according to the pro-
cedures outlined in this unit. Motor nameplate data are critical information to be used when 
ordering replacement motors. Some nameplate information is essential for proper replacement 
of the operating characteristics, and other data are used to size the electrical supply and the 
motor protection.

AC motors do not require the elaborate starting equipment that must be used with 
DC motors. Most three-phase AC induction motors with ratings up to 10 horsepower are 
connected directly across the full line voltage. In many cases, motors with ratings greater 
than 10 horsepower also can be connected directly across the full line voltage. Across-the-
line starting usually is accomplished using a magnetic starting switch controlled from a 
 pushbutton station.
The electrician regularly is called upon to install and maintain magnetic motor 
 starters. As a result, the electrician must be very familiar with the connections, operation, 
and  troubleshooting of these starters. The National Electrical Code® provides information 
on starting and running overload protection for squirrel-cage induction motors. A compre-
hensive study of motor controls is provided in Electric Motors and Motor Controls (Delmar, 
Cengage Learning).
ACROSS-THE-LINE MAGNETIC STARTER
In the simplest starting arrangement, the three-phase AC motor is connected across full line 
voltage for operation in one direction of rotation. This is referred to as across-the-line (ATL) 
starting. The magnetic switch used for starting has three heavy contacts, one auxiliary contact, 
three motor overload relays, and an operating coil. The magnetic switch is called a motor 
starter if it has overload protection. Older motor starters already in service may have used two 
overload relays. Three overload relays are required by the National Electrical Code® in new 
installations.
The wiring diagram for a typical across-the-line magnetic starter is shown in Figure 13–1. 
The three heavy power contacts are in the three line leads feeding the motor. The auxiliary 
contact acts as a sealing circuit around the normally open start pushbutton when the motor is 
operating. As a result, the relay remains energized after the start button is released. The four 
contacts of the ATL magnetic starter are operated by the magnetic starter coil controlled from 
a pushbutton station, as shown in the schematic diagram in Figure 13–2.
Figure 13–3 shows a typical pushbutton station. Two pushbuttons are housed in a pressed 
steel box. The start pushbutton is normally open and the stop pushbutton is normally closed, as 
shown in the diagram (Figure 13–4).
STARTING PROTECTION (BRANCH-CIRCUIT, SHORT-CIRCUIT, 
AND GROUND-FAULT PROTECTION)
In Figure 13–1, a motor-rated disconnect switch is installed ahead of the magnetic starter. The 
safety switch is a three-pole, single-throw enclosed switch. It has a quick-break spring action 
and is operated externally. The motor circuit switch contains three cartridge fuses that serve as 
the short-circuit protection for the motor. These fuses must have sufficient capacity to handle 
the starting surge of current to the motor. The fuses protect the installation from possible

damage resulting from defective wiring or 
faults in the motor windings. This combi-
nation of switch and fuse protection and 
motor starter is available in a single enclo-
sure (Figure 13–5). (See NEC® Article 430, 
Part IV.)
Briefly, the National Electrical Code® 
provides the following information on start-
ing protection for squirrel-cage induction 
motors.
The maximum size of fuses per-
mitted to protect motors are rated 
at 300% of the full-load current of 
the motor for nontime-delay fuses, 
and 175% for  time-delay fuses.
Note: If the required fuse size as 
determined by applying the given per-
centages does not correspond with the 
standard sizes of fuses available, and if the 
specified overcurrent protection is not suf-
ficient to handle the starting current of the motor, then the next higher standard fuse size 
may be used. In no case can the fuse size exceed 400% of the full-load current of the motor 
for nontime-delay fuses and 225% of the full-load current for time-delay fuses. (See NEC® 
Article 430, Part IV, Article 430.52(C)(1) Exceptions.)
Rotors are constructed with different characteristics. Figure 13–6 shows the various types 
of rotor construction and associated code letters. The applications of motors with these code 
letters are also indicated. The design of the rotor affects the amount of current needed to pro-
duce the rotor magnetic field. Code letter A has high starting torque and relatively low starting 
current. The NEC® Table 430.7(B) indicates that a code letter A motor will have less locked 
rotor kVA than other motors. This calculation indicates that there is less starting current for the 
same voltage for a code A compared to a code K motor. The chart in Figure 13–6 provides some 
broad categories of motors (A, B to E, and F to V).
An AC magnetic starter is shown in Figure 13–7. The starter consists of power contacts 
that are used to open and close the circuit to the motor. As AC is applied to the magnetic 
coil, the magnet draws the contacts closed and connects the line power to the motor power. 
In addition to connecting the line power, the magnetic starter has an add-on block at the bot-
tom to provide for running overload protection. See Unit 14 for detailed operation of the 
magnetic starter.

● Example 1:   A three-phase AC induction motor with a nameplate marking of code let-
ter F is rated at 5 hp, 230 volts. According to the National Electrical Code®, 
this motor has a full-load current per terminal of 15.2 amperes according 
to Table 430.250. The starting protection shall not exceed 300% of the 
rated current for squirrel-cage motors with nontime-delay fuses. Thus, the 
s tarting protection is 15.2 × 3 = 45.6 amperes.
Because a 45.6-ampere fuse cannot be obtained (see NEC® 240.6), the next larger size 
of fuse (50 amperes) should be used. For motor branch-circuit protection, the motor current 
 listed in the appropriate table of the National Electrical Code® should be used. The full-load 
 current, as stated on the motor nameplate, is not used for this purpose.
RUNNING OVERLOAD PROTECTION ( NEC®: MOTOR 
AND BRANCH-CIRCUIT OVERLOAD PROTECTION)
Many motor starters installed in the United States use a thermal type of overload assem-
bly. The assembly is normally located beneath the contactor and is directly attached to the 
magnetic contactor. The overload monitoring system is designed to measure the amount 
of current flowing to the motor through the contactor. This is done by connecting thermal

sensors called heaters in series with the motor current. The heaters are sized to produce a 
certain amount of heat with a specified current through them. They are calibrated to cause a 
thermally operated switch to open when there is sustained heat. The extra heat is caused by 
too much current flow to the motor, which indicates the motor is jammed or is working too 
hard and is overloaded. The thermal sensors are various types as seen in Figure 13–8. The 
heater sensors with the associated trip-overload relays are pictured. The National Electrical 
Code® requires the use of three overload units as running-overload protection Table 430.37. 
Although new installations require three overload relays, electricians work on many older 
installations that have only two overload relays. These were installed before the three overload 
relay requirement became effective. The overload relay unit may be either three individual 
units or a common block containing the three heaters and only one trip switch contact unit 
reacting from any one of the heaters.
These overload sensing units are made of a special alloy. Motor current through these units 
causes heat to be generated. In one type, a small bimetallic strip is located next to each of the three 
heater units. When an overload on a motor continues for a period of approximately 1 to 2  minutes, 
the excessive heat developed by the heater units causes the bimetallic strips to expand. As each 
bimetallic strip expands, it causes the normally closed contacts in the control circuit to open. The 
main relay coil is de-energized and disconnects the motor by opening the main and auxiliary con-
tacts. Melting alloy overloads (solder pots) also are commonly used. The heat generated by the 
overload melts the solder pot to release a ratchet that trips the control circuit contacts.
Before the motor can be restarted at the pushbutton station, the overload contacts 
in the control circuit must be allowed to cool before being reclosed (reset). When the reset 
button in the magnetic starter is pressed, the overload contacts in the control circuit 
are reset to their normally closed position. The motor then can be controlled from the 
 pushbutton station.
The National Electrical Code® requires that the running overload protection in each phase 
be rated at not more than 125% of the nameplate full-load current rating for motors that are 
marked with a temperature rise of 40°C (104°F) or less (see NEC® Article 430, Part III).

● Example 2:   Using the motor full-load current rating from the nameplate data, deter-
mine the running overcurrent protection for a three-phase, 5 hp, 230-volt 
AC induction motor with a rated full-load current of 14.5 amperes and a 
temperature rise of 40°C (104°F). The running overcurrent protection is 
14.5 × 1.25 = 18.1 amperes.
For this motor, heater overload units rated to trip at 18.1 amperes are chosen for the mag-
netic starter. Where the overload relay so selected is not sufficient to start this motor, the next 
higher size overload relay is permitted, but not to exceed 140% of the motor full-load current 
rating [NEC® Article 430.32(C)]. Actual motor nameplate currents are used to establish the 
overload protection.
HOW TO SIZE OVERLOAD THERMAL PROTECTION
The process of determining the correct overload protection to protect a motor from excessive 
heating due to mechanical work overloads or from failure to start is a matter of following all 
the rules of the NEC®. Also, each manufacturer has methods to determine proper protection. 
Article 430, Part III, determines the parameters of protection. Article 430.32 determines the trip 
point and the percentage of full-load current when the overload must open the power circuit 
to the motor. Article 430.33 determines the overload protection for intermittent or similar non-
continuous duty motors. Once you have determined the actual trip percentage point according 
to the Code, you multiply the actual motor nameplate current times the percentage to determine 
the actual current trip value.
Most manufacturers use the system of labeling the overload heaters based on the name-
plate information on the motor. Each manufacturer uses its own numbering system that corre-
sponds to the motor starter used. If the motor is a standard rating with a service factor of 1.15 or 
greater and the marked temperature rise for the motor installation is 40°C (104°F) or less, then 
choose the heater catalog number that corresponds to the nameplate rating. This heater will 
provide a trip point of approximately 125% of the nameplate rating as required by NEC® Article 
430.32(A)(1). However, if the service factor is less than 1.15, typically 1.0, or the motor has 
a marker temperature rise over 40°C (104°F), typically 50°C (122°F), then the Code requires 
closer tolerance, and you choose one size smaller from the manufacturer’s table. The one size 
smaller will yield 115% protection as required.
In the case of 125% or 115% protection, the Code does allow the electrical personnel 
to increase the ratings if the original selection does not allow the motor to operate. Article 
430.32(C) allows us to increase each category by one size provided the 125% category does not 
exceed 140%, and the 115% category does not exceed 130%. All the above situations are based 
on the fact that the controller and the motor are in the same ambient temperature.
When sizing the overload heater from a manufacturer’s listing, you must determine the 
heater catalog numbers. There are standard methods used to determine the heater number. 
The electrical technician needs to determine whether the motor controller that contains the

overload heater is in the same ambient temperature as the motor it controls. If the controller 
is in a higher ambient temperature, that means the overload sensors are already warmer than 
the motor, and not as much heat can be added before they trip and disconnect the motor. 
Therefore, choose a heater with a higher number than originally selected. Conversely, if the 
control is at a lower ambient temperature than the motor, select a heater that is one size less than 
the original choice. The lower number of the heater produces more heat per ampere of current 
flow and compensates for the lower ambient temperature.
Electronic overload modules are sized according to the nameplate of the motor and then 
adjusted from 115% to 140% depending on the circumstances of the motor nameplate and the 
conditions relating to the location of the motor and controller. In the following description, the 
overload monitor can also monitor for single phasing of three-phase motors where one phase fails 
and the motor continues to run on the other two phases, now a single-phase  supply. The three-
phase motor is not designed to operate safely with only one phase and may be damaged if allowed 
to run too long. The electronic overload monitor causes the controller to disconnect the motor.
● Example 3:  A 5 hp, 230 V, three-phase motor has a nameplate current of 14.5 A and a 
service factor of 1.25. The marked temperature rise is 40°C (104°F). The 
controller and the motor are at the same ambient temperature. Use the 
heater chart in Figure 13–9.
● Solution: 
 If the controller and motor are at the same ambient temperature, the motor has a 
service factor of 1.15 or more, and a temperature rise of 40°C (104°F) or less, then 
simply choose 125% protection and use the nameplate rating of the motor to pick 
the heater catalog number H37 for NEMA size 00, 0,1 starters. You need three 
heaters for a conventional overload-heater–style starter for a three-phase motor.
● Example 4:  A 5 hp, 230 V motor has a nameplate current of 14.5 A and a service factor 
of 1.0. The marked temperature rise is 40°C (104°F). The controller is in 
a cooler location than the motor by approximately 10°C (50°F). Use the 
heater chart in Figure 13–9.
● Solution: 
 First choose the heater overload as if the controller and the motor were 
at the same temperature. In this case, because the service factor is 1.0, 
the NEC® requires us to protect the motor at 115% of the nameplate 
c urrent. Use the chart to determine the heater selection at full nameplate 
 current, and then choose one size smaller to satisfy the 115% requirement. 
Now adjust that size based on the ambient temperature of the controller. 
Because the controller is already cooler, choose one size smaller than nor-
mal. In this case, the heater is two sizes smaller than would be indicated 
by simply using the nameplate current. The heater is H36. If this does 
not allow the motor to run normally without overheating, the size can be 
adjusted up one size according to Article 430.32(C).

Many new motor starters are equipped with electronic overload relays. These overloads 
do not depend on the heat generated by the motor current passing through the heater element, 
but instead use a current sensor, such as a current transformer, to measure the current and 
provide a trip contact for the controller. This provides an advantage in that the overload can be 
adjusted to provide optimum protection without nuisance tripping over a wider range than that 
available in a thermal overload. The electronic overload can also be used to send operating data 
to a central location for remote monitoring. Other features include adjustable class of overload 
from 10 to 30, current imbalance protection, phase loss protection, phase reversal protection, 
and test function and trip indicators (see Figure 13–10).

The class of overload refers to the speed and protection offered by the motor current 
 monitor. Class 10-rated overloads are designed for hermetic refrigeration motors and for quick 
starting and fast trip on overload. (Trip time is less than 10 seconds, with six trips per hour.) 
Class 20 overloads are the most common and are designed for standard duty motors with normal 
time versus temperature curves. (Trip time is less than 20 seconds, with six trips per hour.) Class 
30 overloads are used for long-time acceleration motors and extended high-current overloading. 
(Trip time is less than 30 seconds, with six trips per hour.) The trip currents are 125% of the min-
imum full-load current listed in the heater tables when the heater is at 40°C (104°F) ambient.
AUXILIARY CONTACTS
In addition to the standard contacts, a starter may be provided with externally attached aux-
iliary contacts, sometimes called electrical interlocks (Figure 13–11). These auxiliary contacts 
can be used in addition to the holding circuit contacts and the main or power contacts that

carry the motor current. Auxiliary contacts are rated to carry only control circuit currents of 
0–15 amperes, not motor currents. Versions are available with either normally open (NO) 
or normally closed (NC) contacts, or combinations of NO and NC. Among a wide variety of 
applications, auxiliary contacts are used to
• control other magnetic devices where sequence operation is desired.
• electrically prevent another controller from becoming energized at the same time (such 
as reverse starting) called interlocking.
• make and break circuits of indicating or alarm devices, such as pilot lights, bells, or other 
signals.
Auxiliary contacts are packaged in kit form and can be added easily in the field.
ACROSS-THE-LINE MOTOR STARTER WITH REVERSING 
CAPABILITY
The direction of rotation of a squirrel-cage induction motor must be reversible for some indus-
trial applications. To reverse the direction of rotation of three-phase motors, interchange any 
two of the three line lead connections to the motor terminals.
Figure 13–12 is an elementary wiring diagram of a motor starter with a reversing capabil-
ity. When the three-power reverse contacts are closed, the phase sequence at the motor termi-
nals is different from that when the three-power forward contacts are closed. Two of the line 
leads feeding to the motor are interchanged when the three reverse-power contacts close.
The control circuit has a pushbutton station with forward, reverse, and stop push buttons. 
The control circuit requires a mechanical and an electrical interlocking system provided by 
the pushbuttons. Electrical interlocking means that if one of the devices in the control circuit 
is energized, the circuit to a second device is open and cannot be closed until the first device 
is disconnected. Mechanical interlocks, shown by the broken lines in Figure 13–12, are used 
between the forward and reverse coils and pushbuttons.
Note in Figure 13–12 that when the forward pushbutton is pressed, it breaks contact with 
terminals 4 and 5, opening the reverse coil circuit, and makes contact between terminals 4 and 7. 
As a result, coil F is energized and the forward contacts close. The motor now rotates in the forward 
direction. If the reverse pushbutton is pressed, it breaks contact between terminals 7 and 8 and opens 
the circuit to coil F. This causes all forward contacts to open. As the reverse pushbutton is depressed 
further, it closes the contact between terminals 5 and 6 and energizes coil R. All reverse contacts are 
now closed, and the motor rotates in the reverse direction. If the stop button is pressed, the contact 
between terminals 3 and 4 is opened, the control circuit is interrupted, and the motor is discon-
nected from the three-phase source. The National Electrical Code® requirements for starting and run-
ning overload protection that apply to the ATL motor starter also apply to this type of motor starter.
Figures 13–12 and 13–13 are actually the same motor controller. Figure 13–12 is drawn in 
an elementary diagram. It has the control circuit in a schematic style, which shows the  electrical 
relationship of the components. It shows the power contact of the magnetic starter below the

shows the same components, but in the approximate physical location of the components. This 
style of drawing is called a wiring diagram. Many electricians find it is easier to wire a panel from 
the wiring diagram as it shows physical location as well as general wire routing. Many electri-
cians find it easier to troubleshoot from a schematic, or elementary, diagram, as it shows the 
electrical sequence of operation more clearly. It is important that you know how to read both 
types of drawings and be able to transfer from one to the other.
DRUM-REVERSING SWITCH
A drum-reversing switch, shown in Figure 13–14(A), can be used to reverse the direction of 
rotation of squirrel-cage induction motors.

The motor is started in the forward direction by moving the handle of the drum-reversing 
switch from the off position to the forward (F) position. The connections for this drum con-
troller in both the forward and reverse positions are shown in Figure 13–15. In the forward 
position, the switch connects line 1 to motor terminal 1, line 2 to motor terminal 2, and line 3 
to motor terminal 3.
To reverse the direction of rotation, the drum switch handle is moved to the reverse (R) 
position. In the reverse position, line 2 is still connected to motor terminal 2. However, line 1 
is now connected to motor terminal 3, and line 3 is connected to motor terminal T1. When the 
handle of the drum switch is moved to the off position, all three line leads are disconnected 
from the motor.
SUMMARY
Many squirrel-cage motors are started with across-the-line motor starters. The motor and 
branch circuit should include short-circuit protection such as fuses or circuit breakers. 
The motor must also have running overload protection. This protection is usually found with 
the starter and is in the form of thermal-overload heaters or current-sensing overloads, and the 
associated overload relay. The overload relay is designed to open the control circuit to the

motor starter in the event of a sustained overload on the motor. Motors can be automatically 
controlled by using a magnetic starter or may be manually controlled by using a drum type of 
controller. In either case, a three-phase motor can be reversed by interchanging two of the three 
line connections to the motor.

The industrial electrician is required to install, maintain, and repair automatic AC control-
lers that start up and provide speed control for squirrel-cage induction motors, wound-rotor 
induction motors, and synchronous motors.
MOTOR CONTROLLERS WITH JOGGING CAPABILITY
Many industrial processes require that the driven machines involved in the process be inched 
or moved small distances. Motor controllers designed to provide control for this type of opera-
tion are called jogging controllers. Jogging is the quickly repeated closure of a controller circuit 
to start a motor from rest for the purpose of accomplishing small movements of the driven 
machine.
An across-the-line (ATL) magnetic motor switch may be used to provide jogging control 
if the proper type of pushbutton station is used in the control circuit. Such a pushbutton station 
is called a start-jog-stop station.
Figure 14–1(A) is a diagram of the connections for a three-phase AC induction motor 
connected to a jogging, ATL motor-starting switch.
Figure 14–1(B) shows the starter with the cover removed. Note in Figure 14–1 that 
the connections and operation of the start and stop pushbuttons are the same as those for 
a standard pushbutton station with start and stop positions. The connections for the jog 
pushbutton, however, are more complex and should be studied in detail. When the jog 
pushbutton is pressed, coil M is energized, main contacts M close, and the motor starts 
turning. The small auxiliary contacts M also close, but do not function as a sealing circuit 
around the jog pushbutton because pushing the jog pushbutton also opens the sealing cir-
cuit. As a result, as soon as the jog pushbutton is released, coil M is de-energized and all 
M contacts open. Before the jog pushbutton returns to its normal position, the sealing M 
contacts open and thus the control circuit remains open. This control also can be used for 
standard start–stop operations. In summary, then, repeated closures of the jog pushbutton 
start the motor momentarily so that the driven machine can be inched or jogged to the 
desired position.
QUICK-STOP AC CONTROLLER (PLUGGING)
Some industrial applications require that three-phase motors be stopped quickly. If any two of 
the line leads feeding a three-phase motor are reversed, a countertorque is set up that brings the 
motor to a quick standstill before it begins to rotate in the reverse direction. If the circuit is inter-
rupted at the instant the motor begins to turn in the opposite direction, the rotor just stops. This 
method of bringing a motor to a quick stop is called plugging. The motor controller required 
to provide this type of operation is an ATL magnetic motor starter with reversing control and 
a special plugging relay. The plugging relay may be belt driven from an auxiliary pulley on the 
motor shaft, or attached to a through-shaft motor.

The connections for a quick-stop AC controller are shown in Figure 14–2(A). The con-

normally open F contacts close and maintain the start pushbutton circuit. When the start but-
ton is released, the circuit of coil F is maintained through the sealing circuit, main F contacts 
close, and the rated three-phase voltage is applied to the motor terminals. Then the motor 
comes up to speed, and PR contacts of the plugging relay close.
When the stop pushbutton is pressed, the F relay coil is de-energized. As a result of this 
action, the main F contacts for the motor circuit open and disconnect the motor from the three-
phase source. In addition, the small F holding contacts open, which de-energizes the holding 
or sealing circuit around the start pushbutton. Finally, the small F contacts in series with the 
reverse relay close to their normal position, and the reverse relay coil is energized.
The main R contacts now close to reconnect the three-phase line voltage to the motor 
terminals. The connections of two line leads are interchanged. The resulting reversing counter-
torque developed in the motor brings it to a quick stop. At the moment the motor begins to turn 
in the reverse direction, PR contacts open due to the mechanical action of the PR relay unit. 
Coil R is de-energized and the R contacts open and interrupt the power supply to the motor. 
Because the motor is just beginning to turn in the opposite direction, it comes to a standstill. 
The motor supplies the mechanical power to drive a disk that causes PR contacts to close when 
the motor is in operation.
DYNAMIC BRAKING WITH INDUCTION MOTORS
From the study of DC controllers, we know that dynamic braking is a method used to help 
bring a motor to a quicker stop without the extensive use of friction brakes. In this application, 
dynamic braking means that the motor involved is used as a generator. An energy-dissipating 
resistance is connected across the terminals of the motor after it is disconnected from the line.
Dynamic braking also can be applied to induction motors. When the stop pushbutton is 
pressed, the motor is disconnected from the three-phase source, and the stator windings are 
excited by a DC source. A stationary magnetic field is developed by the direct current in the 
stator windings. As the squirrel-cage rotor revolves through this stationary field, a high rotor 
current is created. This rotor current reacts with the stationary field of the stator to produce a 
countertorque that slows and stops the motor.
Figure 14–3 is a diagram of an AC motor installation with an across-the-line magnetic 
motor starter and dynamic braking capability.
When the start pushbutton is pressed, coil M is energized. At this instant, the main M 
contacts close and connect the motor terminals to the three-phase source, and the auxiliary, 
normally open M contacts close and provide a maintaining circuit around the start pushbut-
ton. When relay coil M is energized, the normally closed contacts M in the DC control circuit 
open, with the result that both the main DC relay coil N and the time-delay relay coil TR are 
de-energized, and interlocks in the DC circuit open. The three-phase voltage applied to the 
motor terminals causes the motor to accelerate to the rated speed.
When the stop pushbutton is pressed, coil M is de-energized. At this moment, a num-
ber of actions occur: (1) The main contacts M open and disconnect the motor from the

 three-phase source; (2) the auxiliary M contacts open (these contacts act as a maintaining cir-
cuit); (3) M p rotective interlocks in the DC circuit close; and (4) the auxiliary, normally closed 
M contacts in the DC control circuit close and energize the time-delay relay and the main relay 
coil N. Energizing relay coil N causes the closing of the N contacts so that DC voltage is con-
nected on the AC windings through a current-limiting resistance. As a result, the motor comes 
to a quick stop. Following a definite period after the motor has stopped, measured in seconds, 
the TR relay coil operates and opens the TR contacts to cause coil N to become de-energized. 
Thus, the N contacts open and disconnect the motor windings from the DC source. The con-
troller now is ready for the next starting cycle.
Timing contacts are shown in their de-energized condition. Timers are either on delay or 
off delay and are used in motor control work. The actual timer mechanism varies depending on 
the vintage of the controller and the manufacturer. See Unit 10 for a complete description of 
the timer symbols and operations.
RESISTANCE STARTER CONTROLLER
When a squirrel-cage induction motor is connected directly across the rated line voltage, the 
starting current may be 300% to 600% or more of the rated current of the motor. In large 
motors, this high current may cause serious voltage regulation problems and overload industrial 
power feeders.

The starting current of a squirrel-cage induction motor can be reduced by using a resis-
tance starter controller. This type of controller inserts equal resistance values in each line wire 
at the instant the motor is started. After the motor accelerates to a value near its rated speed, the 
resistance is cut out of the circuit and full line voltage is applied to the motor terminals.
Figure 14–4(A) shows a diagram of the circuit connections for a resistance starter. A 
photo of this starter is shown in Figure 14–4(B). When the start button is pressed, main relay 
coil M is energized. The main contacts close and connect the motor to the three-phase source 
through the three resistors (R). The circuit for coil M is maintained through the small auxiliary 
contacts (3 and 4), which act as a sealing circuit around the normally open start pushbutton. 
When the main contacts of relay coil M are closed, a timing relay is energized. The on-delay 
timer closes contacts 4 to 5 after a set time. After a predetermined time elapses, the definite time 
contacts close and energize coil R. Coil R causes three sets of contacts to close and shunt out 
the three resistors. Thus, the motor is connected directly across the rated line voltage with no 
interruption of the power line (closed transition).
When the stop button is pressed, the circuits of both coil M and coil R are opened. This 
causes the opening of the main contacts, the sealing contacts, and the contacts that shunt the 
series resistors. As a result, the motor is disconnected from the three-phase source.
The motor starting current in the resistance starter causes a relatively high voltage drop 
in the three resistors. Because of this, the voltage across the motor terminals at starting is low. 
As the motor accelerates, the current decreases; the voltage drop across the three resistors 
decreases; and the terminal voltage of the motor increases gradually. A smooth acceleration is 
obtained because of this gradual increase in the terminal voltage. However, it may be unwise to 
select resistance starting for many starting tasks because of the energy dissipated in the starting 
resistors.
AUTOMATIC AUTOTRANSFORMER COMPENSATOR
An automatic compensator is used to automatically connect an autotransformer in series 
with the motor during the starting cycle (Figure 14–5). A compensator is another name 
for an autotransformer starter. By inserting an autotransformer, the voltage to the motor 
is reduced, and therefore the starting current is reduced. The starting current drawn from 
the line is reduced. Because the autotransformer steps down the voltage to the motor, the 
secondary (motor) current is higher than the primary current. The result is that the cur-
rent drawn from the line is much less than if the motor were started with a reduced voltage 
through a resistor. The automatic compensator can be pushbutton controlled from a conve-
nient location. Figure 14–5(B) shows a typical schematic wiring diagram for an automatic 
autotransformer compensator.
When the start button is pressed, a circuit is established from power line 1 through the 
following devices to power line 2: through the stop button and the depressed start button to

energize the M coil on control line 1 and the timing relay coil on control line 3 and through 
the TR timer contacts on line 4 to the S coil. The M auxiliary coil on line 2 closes and provides 
a holding circuit for the start button. With the M coil energized, the M power contacts close 
and the S power contacts close. This supplies power to the autotransformer, and a reduced 
voltage is supplied to the motor. As the TR timer times out, the TR contacts on line 5 close 
and the TR contacts on line 4 open. As the contacts on line 4 open, the S relay is de-energized 
and the S contacts on line 5 close to supply control power to the R relay. Now the power 
is disconnected from the autotransformer and supplied directly to the motor as full voltage 
(see Figure 14–6).
AUTOMATIC CONTROLLER FOR WOUND-ROTOR INDUCTION 
MOTORS
Manual speed controllers, such as the faceplate type or the drum type, may be used to pro-
vide speed control for wound-rotor induction motors in industrial applications. If the resis-
tance in the rotor circuit of a wound-rotor induction motor is to be used only on starting, 
then an automatic controller may be used (Figure 14–7). In this case, resistors in the rotor 
circuit are automatically removed by contactors arranged to operate in sequence at definite 
time intervals.

As shown in Figure 14–7, when the start button is pressed, the main relay coil M is ener-
gized. The main contacts are closed to connect the stator circuit of the motor directly across the 
three-phase line voltage. All the resistance of the controller is inserted in the secondary circuit 
of the motor as it begins to accelerate.

When the start pushbutton is released, the M coil auxiliary contact holds the M coil in, 
and power is applied to the motor primary windings marked T1, T2, and T3. The first timer 
begins timing at the same instant the M coil is energized. After a predetermined time, timer 
1 times out and closes the contacts on the next line, thereby energizing the N coil. This pulls 
the N power contacts closed and shunts some of the resistance in the rotor secondary. As the 
N coil is energized, the second timer, TD2, is started. After another predetermined time, TD2 
times out and closes, energizes the O coil, and pulls the remaining power contacts closed to 
shunt all the secondary rotor resistance. Examples of timing relays appear in Figure 14–8 and 
Figure 14–9.
When the stop pushbutton is pressed, relay coil M is de-energized, and contacts M open 
to disconnect the motor from the line. Coil O also is de-energized, and contacts O open, with 
the result that all resistance is inserted in the rotor circuit for the next starting cycle.
Wound-rotor motors are also controlled by electronic controllers. Often these motors 
used electromechanical controllers to place resistance into the secondary rotor circuit to con-
trol inrush current and then to control speed. With automatic controllers, these motors can be 
retrofitted to use electronic soft-start control to bring the motor up to speed with a minimum 
inrush current. If additional speed control is needed, the controller still can insert power resis-
tors into the secondary rotor circuit. The more resistance inserted, the slower the speed of the 
motor.
National Electrical Code® regulations for wire size, starting overload protection, and run-
ning overload protection apply to both manual speed controllers and automatic controllers 
used with wound-rotor induction motors.

WYE–DELTA CONTROLLER
Figure 14–10(A) shows a simple method by which a three-phase, delta-connected motor can 
be started on reduced voltage by connecting the stator windings of the motor in wye during the 
starting period. Figure 14–10(B) shows the actual starter. After the motor accelerates, the wind-
ings are reconnected in delta and placed directly across the rated three-phase voltage.
When the Start button is pressed, the main M contacts close, and relay coil Y and time-
delay relay TR are energized. Coil Y causes contacts Y to close, and the windings of the motor 
are connected in wye. If the line voltage is 230 volts, the voltage across each winding is
230
1.73 = 133 volts
The voltage across each winding is only 58% of the line voltage when the windings are 
connected in wye at the start position. (See three-phase voltage in Electricity 3, Unit 8.)
After a definite period of time, the time-delay relay TR opens the circuit of relay coil Y, the 
Y contacts open, and the Y interlocks close.

applied to the motor windings, and the motor operates at its rated capacity.
Motors started by a wye–delta controller must have the leads of each phase winding 
brought out to the terminal connection box of the motor. In addition, the phase windings must 
be connected in delta for the normal running position.
Note: The electrician should never attempt to operate a three-phase, wye-connected 
motor with this type of controller. This results in an excessive voltage applied to the motor 
windings in the run position when the windings are connected in delta by the controller.
Another method of controlling the wye–delta controller is to provide a way to change from 
the wye connection to the delta connection without completely disconnecting the motor from 
the power line. This method is called closed transition as compared to the previously described 
open transition. By using resistors in the power circuit, the transition can be made from wye to 
delta, as shown in Figure 14–11. When the start button is pressed, the S coil on line 1 and the 
1M coil on line 2 are energized, and the power is supplied to the motor, which is connected in 
the star pattern by the S power contacts. As the timer 1M closes, it energizes coil 1A on line 3 
and resistors are connected into the power circuit of the motor for a brief time, and the S coil is 
de-energized, releasing the motor from the wye connection. As 1A timing contacts close on line 
4, the 2M coil is energized and the resistors are effectively shunted out of the circuit.
When using closed transition, the small current fluctuation that occurs as the motor is 
briefly disconnected from the line may cause a voltage dip in the voltage supply as well as a fluc-
tuation in the motor’s developing torque. To reduce the voltage and current disturbance, closed 
transition is used. Note the fluctuations in Figure 14–12.
COMPARISON OF REDUCED-VOLTAGE STARTING METHODS
The chart in Figure 14–13, shows the advantages and limitations of the various methods of 
reduced-voltage/reduced-torque types of motor starting. The advantage of using the reduced 
voltage is to reduce the inrush current to the motor from the supply line, thereby reducing the 
voltage dips and disturbances to the facility’s electrical system. The motor’s normal starting torque 
is also reduced, which may be an advantage or disadvantage. The starting torque is reduced in 
proportion to the voltage reduction squared. If the voltage is reduced to 50%, then the torque is 
0.52, or 0.25 = 25%. If the voltage is reduced to 80%, the torque is reduced to 64%. An advantage 
to reduced torque is that the driven machinery is not violently started from a stopped position to 
full-locked rotor torque. The disadvantage may be that there is not enough torque to start the load.
AUTOMATIC CONTROLLER FOR SYNCHRONOUS MOTORS
Synchronous motors may be started by an ATL magnetic motor starting switch, a manual start-
ing compensator, or an automatic starting compensator. Dynamic braking may be provided by 
the controller.

Figure 14–14 is a diagram of the connections for a synchronous motor controller with 
dynamic braking. When the start button is pressed, main relay coil M is energized. The four 
normally open M contacts close, and the two normally closed M contacts open. Three-phase 
voltage is applied to the motor terminals. When the motor accelerates to a speed near the syn-
chronous speed, the DC field circuit is energized by secondary controls.
When the stop button is pressed, main relay coil M is de-energized. The M contacts open 
and disconnect the motor terminals from the three-phase line. The two normally closed M con-
tacts reconnect the motor windings through the resistors, and the DC field remains energized. 
As a result, the synchronous motor acts as an AC generator and delivers electrical energy to the 
two R resistors. The use of this type of controller results in a more rapid slowing of a synchro-
nous motor.
The National Electrical Code® provides guidelines for branch-circuit fuse protection and 
running overload protection for branch circuits feeding three-phase synchronous motors, and 
for allowable conductor sizes for branch-circuit–feeding synchronous motors. Local building 
and electrical code authorities should be consulted before installations are made with motors 
and controllers that do not comply with National Electrical Code® rulings.

SOLID-STATE REDUCED VOLTAGE STARTERS
Solid-state devices and equipment are used for reduced-voltage motor starting, electrical-
energy–saving control circuits, variable speed drives, motor protection, and other applications. 
A motor starter consists of a control circuit, a motor power circuit, and protective devices for 
the wiring and the motor. The functions of a starter are performed by contactors and overload 
relays in electromechanical motor starters. In solid-state starters, the control functions are per-
formed by semiconductors. They are controlled by integrated circuits and microprocessors to 
provide the protective functions, operating instructions, and control.
Construction and Operation
The solid-state, reduced-voltage starter provides a smooth, stepless acceleration of a three-phase 
induction motor. This is accomplished by gradually turning on six power silicon-controlled rec-
tifiers (SCRs). Two SCRs per phase are connected in a back-to-back or reverse parallel arrange-
ment (Figure 14–15). The SCRs are mounted on a heat (dissipating) sink to make up a power 
pole (phase). The SCRs are connected back to back so that they can pass AC and control the 
amount of voltage. Each power pole contains the gate firing circuits as discussed in Unit 11.

An integrated thermal sensor is also provided to de-energize the starter if an over-temperature 
condition exists.
The firing circuitry on each power pole is controlled by a logic module. These mod-
ules monitor the starter for correct start-up and operating conditions. Some motor starters 
provide a visual indicator of the starting condition through the use of light-emitting diodes 
(LEDs).
The current-limiting starter is a common type that is designed to maintain the motor 
current at a constant level throughout the acceleration period. A current-limit potentiometer 
adjustment is provided to preset this current. A starter with current ramp acceleration is 
designed to begin acceleration at a low current level and then increase the current during the 
acceleration period.
As indicated in Figure 14–15, this starter includes both start and run contactors. 
The start contacts are in series with the SCRs; the run contacts are in parallel with the 
combination of SCRs and start contacts. When the starter is energized, the start contacts 
close. The motor acceleration is then controlled by phasing on the SCRs. When the motor 
reaches full speed, the run contacts close, and the motor is connected directly across the 
lines (closed transition). At this point, the SCRs are turned off and the start contacts 
open. Under full-speed running conditions, the SCRs are out of the circuit, eliminating 
SCR power losses during the run cycle. This feature saves energy; it also guards against 
possible damage due to overvoltage transients. With the starter in the de-energized posi-
tion, all contacts are open, isolating the motor from the line. This open-circuit  condition

protects against accidental motor rotation as a result of 
SCR misfiring and/or SCR damage caused by overvoltage 
transients. A solid-state, reduced-voltage starter is shown in 
Figure 14–16. Field connections are very similar to those for 
electromechanical starters.
Reduced Voltage Operation
To reduce the voltage applied to the motor in a solid-state starter, 
the SCRs can be turned on by the “gate” electrode for any desired 
part of each half cycle. Usually the SCRs turn off as the current 
wave reaches zero. They stay off until gated on again in the next 
half cycle. Some devices can vary the switching and timing. By 
switching the controlled current gating, the effective AC voltage 
can be varied to the motor. This voltage can be varied from zero 
to full voltage as required. The voltage is applied at some preset 
minimum value that can start the motor rotating. As the motor 
speed builds up, the SCR “on” time is gradually increased. The 
voltage is increased until the motor is placed across the line at 
full voltage. Mechanical shock is reduced, and the current inrush 
can be regulated and controlled as desired (Figure 14–17). The 
solid-state, reduced-voltage starter can replace any of the elec-
tromechanical starters already described for reduced-voltage 
starting.

AC ADJUSTABLE SPEED DRIVES
Adjustable speed drives have a flexibility that is particularly useful in specialized applications. 
For this reason, these drives are widely used throughout the industry for conveyors used to 
move materials, hoists, grinders, mixers, pumps, variable speed fans, saws, and crushers. The 
advantages of AC drives include the maximum use of the driven equipment, better coordina-
tion of production processes, and reduced wear on mechanical equipment.
The AC induction motor is the major converter of electrical energy into another usable 
form. About two-thirds of the electrical energy produced in the United States is delivered to 
motors.
Much of the power that is consumed by AC motors goes into the operation of fans, blow-
ers, and pumps. It has been estimated that approximately 50% of the motors in use are for these 
types of loads. Such loads are particularly appropriate to consider for energy savings. Several 
alternate methods of control for fans and pumps have been developed and show energy savings 
over traditional methods of control.
Fans and pumps are designed to meet the maximum demand of the system in which they 
are installed. Often, however, the actual demand varies and may be much less than the design 
capacity. Such conditions are accommodated by adding outlet dampers to fans or throttling 
valves to pumps. These controls are effective and simple but affect the efficiency of the system.

Other forms of control have been developed to adapt machinery to varying demands. These 
controls do not decrease the efficiency of the system as much as the traditional methods of 
control. One of the newer methods is the direct, variable speed control of the fan or pump. This 
method produces a more efficient means of flow control compared to other existing methods.
In addition to a tangible reduction in the power required to operate equipment and 
machinery resulting from the use of adjustable speed drives, other benefits include extended 
bearing life and pump seal life.
TYPES OF ADJUSTABLE SPEED DRIVES
Several types of variable speed drives can be used with wound-rotor induction motors. These 
drives are eddy-current (magnetic) drives, variable pitch drives, and adjustable-frequency 
drives.
Eddy-Current (Magnet) Drives
The eddy-current drive couples the motor to the load magnetically (Figure 14–18). The elec-
tromagnetic coupling is a simple way to obtain an adjustable output speed from the constant 
input speed of squirrel-cage motors. No mechanical contact exists between the rotating mem-
bers of the eddy-current drive; thus, there is no wear. Torque is transmitted between the two 
rotating units by an electromagnetic reaction created by an energized rotating coil winding. The 
rotation of the ring with relation to the electromagnet generates eddy currents and magnetic 
fields in the ring. Magnetic interaction between the two units transmits torque from the motor 
to the load. The slip between the motor and the load can be controlled continuously with great 
precision.
Torque can be controlled using a thyristor in an AC or DC circuit, or by using a rheostat to 
control the field through slip rings. When the eddy-current drive responds to an input or com-
mand voltage, the speed of the driven machine changes. A further refinement can be obtained 
in automatic control to regulate and maintain the output speed. The magnetic drive can be used 
with nearly any type of actuating device or transducer that can provide an electrical signal. For 
example, the input can be provided by static controls and sensors that 
detect liquid level, air and fluid pressures, temperature, and frequency.
Magnetic eddy-current drives are used for applications requir-
ing an adjustable speed such as cranes, hoists, fans, compressors, and 
pumps (Figure 14–19).
Variable Pitch Drives
The speed of an AC squirrel-cage induction motor depends on the 
frequency (hertz) of the supply current and the number of poles of 
the motor. The equation expressing this relationship is

Number of poles
A frequency changer may be used to vary the speed of this type of motor. A possible 
method is to drive an alternator through an adjustable mechanical speed drive.
The voltage is regulated automatically during frequency 
changes. An AC motor drives a variable cone pulley or sheave, 
which is belted to another variable pulley on the output shaft 
(Figure 14–20). When the relative diameters of the two pulleys 
are changed, the speed between the input and the output can be 
controlled. As the alternator speed is varied, the output frequency 
varies, thereby varying the speed of the motor, or motors, con-
nected electrically to the alternator supply.
Adjustable Frequency AC Drives
Adjustable frequency (static solid-state) drives are also com-
monly called variable frequency drives (VFDs). The power 
conversion losses are greatly reduced when using these transistor 
controllers for adjustable speed drives. They are available in a

range of horsepowers from fractional to 1000 hp. Adjustable frequency drives are designed 
to operate standard AC induction motors although “inverter duty” motors are more reliable 
when using a variable frequency input. This allows them to be added easily to an existing sys-
tem (Figure 14–21).
Where energy saving is a major concern, the drives are ideal for pumping and fan applica-
tions. They are also used for many process control or machine applications where performance 
is a major concern. Many adjustable speed precision applications were limited to the use of DC 
motors. By using adjustable frequency controllers with optional dynamic braking, standard 
squirrel-cage motors can now be used in these applications. Municipal, industrial, commercial, 
and mining applications include sewage, waste water, slurry and booster pumps, ventilation and 
variable air volume fans, conveyors, production machines, and compressors.
AC VARIABLE SPEED/VARIABLE FREQUENCY CONTROLS
AC motors are designed to run at a specific full-load speed. This design speed takes into account 
various losses in the motor, including copper losses of the stator and the rotor and other losses 
such as iron losses, friction, and windage. The end result is some speed less than synchronous 
speed. Synchronous speed is calculated by the following formula:

Use this formula to determine the synchronous speed of a motor if the number of poles 
and the applied frequency are known. The number of poles is usually fixed, and the frequency 
of a normal power feed in the United States is 60 Hz. Many other countries of the world use 
50 Hz. as their standard frequency. Therefore, to operate an AC motor at other than its design 
speed, either the number of poles or the frequency must be altered. Some adjustable speed 
motors are able to reconnect the poles or connect a separate winding of poles to establish other 
set speeds. To vary the speed of an AC motor over a wide range of speeds, the applied frequency 
is altered.
There are two basic techniques for altering the frequency of the applied power through 
electronic means. Both techniques use the principle of rectifying the three-phase, AC, 60 Hz 
input power to a DC supply (see Figure 14–22). The DC is then filtered to provide smooth DC 
to the inverter section of the electronic controller. The amplitude of the output voltage must 
change with the frequency, because at low frequency the impedance of the motor is low and the 
voltage must also be reduced to prevent overheating of the motor. Conversely, as the frequency 
is raised above 60 Hz, the motor’s impedance is increased and voltage must also increase to 
maintain motor torque. This parameter of the controller functions is known as the volts per 
hertz ratio.
One method of speed control is the variable voltage inverter. The DC voltage applied 
to the inverter is adjusted, and then the pulse is modified to create various frequencies (see 
Figure 14–21).
The other and more common method is known as pulse width modulation (PWM). The 
voltage output of the DC-to-AC inverter is really a series of DC pulses that is stepped to pro-
duce a “staircase” approximation of the sinewave at the frequency desired to control the motor 
speed. The controller uses a sensor and a set point to determine output frequency and the 
desired set speed.
The control modules adjust the output of a DC voltage-control module as it adjusts the output 
of the frequency-control module. The frequency-control module typically drives the output power 
controller. There are two output power con-
trollers for each of the three phases: one 
controls the positive half cycles of one phase, 
and the other controls the negative half cycles 
of the same phase. Six output modules are 
required for three phases (Figure 14–23).
When connected to a motor, the 
stepped output waveform appears close to 
a sinewave because of the motor’s induc-
tance. Frequency then determines the 
speed of the motor in conjunction with the 
set number of poles.

INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMABLE CONTROLLERS
Modern motor control requires more exact timing and faster, more consistent operations than 
those provided by the older electromechanical relays and timers. Because modern manufacturing 
requirements also rely on system flexibility, a fast change system was needed that did not require 
extensive redesign, building, hand wiring, and testing to create a new motor control scheme.
Along with this change in needs, the microprocessor was improved to make it more reli-
able in industrial environments and more trouble-free in operation. The combination of these 
events produced the programmable logic controller (PLC).
Many versions of the PLC are made by various manufacturers and have various capabili-
ties. However, all programmable controllers have at least three basic components. The first is 
a processor, which is a microprocessor that contains the instructions and makes the decisions. 
The second component is an input/output section, which receives input information from the 
process it is controlling and connects it to the controller in the proper format. It also takes the 
output from the controller and interfaces to the real world of control devices. The third main 
component is the programmer. This is the operator’s access to the controller. The programs 
are written in ladder-logic style, which is familiar to most electricians. This familiarity was the 
factor that allowed the PLC to be so widely accepted as a control system. Controls were easily

converted and adapted by working electricians, without them having to learn extensive new 
microprocessor programming language.
PLCs are used where the control system is likely to be changed frequently and usually 
where there are multiple functions for the controller to monitor, compare, count, time, or oper-
ate. These conditions make the use of a PLC economical and practical.
Large control systems may have various input/output cards that must be coordinated 
according to the “field wiring,” such as AC and DC voltage at various levels, transistor–transistor 
logic (TTL), input/output (I/O), analog I/O, thermocouple, or binary-coded decimal (BCD). 
Figure 14–24 shows a PLC.
The intent of this book is not to teach programming of the PLC, but to familiarize the elec-
trician with the possibility of motor control using the PLC. Technician’s Guide to Programmable 
Controllers, 5th edition, by Richard A. Cox (Delmar Cengage Learning, 2006) is an excellent 
reference to gain further generic information.

SUMMARY
Many methods are used to start, stop, jog, and reverse three-phase motors. The basic opera-
tions generally use a magnetic controller to supply power to the motor. The reversing control-
ler is used in the plugging operation to momentarily reverse the power and therefore bring the 
motor to a quick stop. Dynamic braking can also be used to stop an AC motor by applying DC 
to the motor field. Various methods of reducing the starting current to the motor employ the 
application of reduced voltage at the motor terminals during the starting period. Resistance or 
reactance can be inserted in series with the motor to reduce the voltage. An autotransformer 
may be used to reduce the applied voltage. Wound-rotor motors use secondary resistors to 
keep the starting current to a minimum. Wye–delta starters can be used to reduce the starting 
current to the motor by changing the configuration of the connections. Solid-state starters are 
now being installed to reduce the inrush current and to control the speed and the stopping 
characteristics.
Variable frequency drives use electronics to control the frequency to the motor and 
therefore control the speed of the motor. Many motor-control schemes can be developed 
with the use of a PLC. This electronic equivalent of a relay system is used to provide exact 
timing and complex, but changeable, control through the use of a microprocessor-based 
system.

In addition to the variable frequency speed controls covered in Unit 15, many motors are 
being installed with electronic controllers. The starters are more reliable than ever and have 
many features that are not available on conventional electromechanical starters. These starters 
can be used for a variety of applications, including pumps, blowers, compressors, chillers, and 
any other motor use. They can be used on induction, synchronous, multispeed, reversing, and 
even wound-rotor motors. DC motor drives are described in Unit 6.
DIGITAL CONTROLLERS
Many of the electronic solid-state starters now available have advanced features that allow 
the electrician to choose just the right parameters to fit the intended control need. With the 
spread of worldwide control companies, most starters are designed to operate over a range of 
supply voltages and frequencies. Many starters are programmable so that the field electrician 
can make adjustments to specially start, stop, and monitor the motor operations. This starter 
can be programmed using a remote digital display to set the controller for the desired motor 
full-load amperes (FLA). It allows the user to set the controller to the proper motor service 
factor as well as motor acceleration and deceleration. It also may protect the motor from phase 
imbalance or improper phase sequence. The electronic controller can monitor current to the 
motor and protect the motor from overload, selected as class 10, 20, or 30 overload. It may 
open the line power if one phase is lost on a three-phase line (a condition known as single 
phasing).
Features available on many digital solid-state starters include over- or under-voltage 
protection, or voltage-unbalance protection. Ground-fault protection may also be chosen as 
an option with many of the controllers. Many of the manufacturers also offer display readout 
of fault conditions with the sequence of faults and conditions. This helps in the troubleshoot-
ing procedures when trying to ascertain conditions that occurred when the motor stopped 
 functioning normally.
The programmable parameters must be set when installing a new electronic drive. A 
common parameter is the motor FLA, which is set based on the motor nameplate rating. This 
setting is designed to program the controller for a specific motor and adjust the operating char-
acteristics to meet that particular motor’s operation. A motor overload parameter is set based 
on the motor service factor. If the motor is able to run with a percentage overload of the design 
horsepower, the controller needs the information to detect when a dangerous motor overload 
occurs. Service factors may range from 1.0 to 1.4. Service factor (SF) 1 (or 100%) means no 
overload is tolerated by the motor design. SF 1.4 means that the motor can withstand 140% 
overload without damage to the motor windings. The overload current sensors must have the 
appropriate information to track motor operations.
Starting current parameters are established to determine how much current is to be 
delivered to the motor during start-up. It should be set to allow the motor to start turning

as soon as the start command is given. In some starters, this parameter is listed as a percent-
age of the FLA of the motor. If the motor does not begin turning when the start command 
is received, then increase the value in small increments. If the motor accelerates too quickly 
and the  starting torque is too hard on the driven load, then try reducing the starting current 
parameter. The maximum starting current parameter must be set. This setting is designed 
to limit the current to a maximum value based on the electrical supply requirements. 
The motor may not require the maximum value, but the limit will keep too much current 
from being drawn from the electric supply. This control should be checked with the next 
 control to make sure the motor achieves full speed during the time limit set by the ramp-up 
time parameter.
Motor ramp-up time is the setting that determines how much time is to elapse before 
the motor is at full speed with full voltage and current applied. It controls the time in seconds 
between initial motor current setting and the time when maximum motor current is applied to 
the starting motor. Associated with the ramp-up time is the motor stall-time parameter. The 
stall time determines the seconds allowed from the end of the ramp-up time until the motor 
reaches full operating speed before the controller disconnects the motor from the line.
Other parameters to select are the deceleration modes. Some controllers have multiple 
modes for deceleration. There may be an initial level of voltage applied to the motor when 
the stop command is issued. This allows the voltage to the motor to slowly decrease and 
provide gradual stopping. If you need the motor to come to a quick stop, set this selection to 
0 or no ramp-down voltage. As in the increasing speed mode, or acceleration mode, the next 
parameter is programmed with consideration of the deceleration time setting made in the next 
step. The deceleration voltage level 2 is set to control the voltage after the ramp-down time 
has expired, but the motor is still not at rest. This step 2 sets the end of the ramp voltage that 
the motor will receive as it is decelerating. If the motor is still turning at the end of the ramp-
down time, decrease the step 2 voltage setting. The time setting for the deceleration is the next 
parameter. Set this to the desired time that is required for the motor to decelerate. This is not a 
braking control.
Line current imbalance is another commonly set point. If the phase currents to the 
motor are different by anywhere from 5% to 40% and the difference occurs for more than 
10  seconds, the motor will be disconnected from the line to prevent it from being damaged by 
the  single-phasing condition.
BASIC OPERATIONS
Electronic controllers are packaged in a ready-to-use style (see Figure 15–1). They are sized in 
various categories to accommodate standard motor sizing. Some electronic controllers use the 
pulse-width–modulation (PWM) method of controlling output voltage and motor current; some 
use a variation of the PWM drive; and some of the newest controllers use a flux vector method of

controlling the output to the motor. The difference between the two systems is in the feedback of 
motor operations to the controller and the sophistication of the  microprocessor controller.
The PWM electronic drives with variable voltage control use a sequence of control 
that is simplified in Figure 15–2. In this block diagram, the incoming power is rectified and 
filtered in the initial stage of the controller with a three-phase rectifier circuit, as shown in 
Figure 15–3. A microprocessor controls the firing of the output controller, based on the 
parameters selected and the information from the controller sensors. The output is con-
trolled by a configuration of transistors of a type called insulated gate bipolar transistor

(IGBT). These electronic devices control the frequency and the amount of voltage that is 
delivered to the motor. By turning on the DC voltage for varying lengths of time, the pulses 
of DC are controlled and create an approximation of a sinewave output (see Figure 15–4). By 
adjusting the pulse width, or the time of pulses, and the modulation of the voltage available, 
PWM controls the frequency and the level of the output voltage supplied to the motor. A 
microprocessor responds to the input parameter selection and drives the motor to the design 
limits set by the operator.
Adjusting the frequency to an AC motor directly affects its speed. If the frequency applied 
is lower than the nameplate design frequency, the inductive reactance of the motor is lower, and 
the input voltage must be lowered to compensate for this reduced reactance of the winding. 
Line and output reactors may be included to reduce the disturbances to the power line. Because 
this is a high-speed switching device, it is considered a nonlinear load to the power source, and 
electrical harmonics are generated. The reactors help reduce the effects of the harmonics on 
the supply system. Note that there are several input points for digital inputs, such as contact 
closures, and the analog input points are typically for a speed-setting potentiometer. The out-
put points are used to relay information to the user in the form of contact closure for indicating

lights or other needed alarms. The analog output can be used to drive other devices or as a 
monitor point for process control.
The flux-vector drive is an advancement in the PWM control for motors. If the motor is 
to run at set frequencies for extended periods and there are not a lot of load fluctuations, the 
speed stays nearly constant. If, however, there is a need for precise speed control and the load 
fluctuates considerably, then the flux-vector drive is needed. The advantage of the flux vector 
is derived from the feedback information to the controller from the output to the motor. It can 
produce maximum torque at all speeds, and the response to changing load is nearly instanta-
neous for speed changes. The term vector is used to describe the operating characteristics that 
react like a vector in mathematics. The vector describes direction and magnitude. The flux 
(magnetic fields) of the motor can be controlled like a vector to change magnitude and relative 
position of the magnetic fields in the motor. If the rotor flux and the stator flux can maintain an 
optimum 90° relationship to each other, then maximum torque is produced. This is the goal of 
adjusting the magnetic flux of the stator to create a 90° separation from the rotor flux.
A squirrel-cage motor produces rotor flux because it slips behind the stator magnetic 
field. The slip is measured in percent slip. Normally, the slip is 3% to 5% for a normal motor at 
full load. The slip can also be measured as an angular velocity in hertz. As the motor is loaded, 
the slip increases and the angular velocity increases, or the hertz slip increases. By monitoring 
the relative amount of flux in the stator (the magnitude) and the relative position of the flux 
(the direction of the vector), the controller uses a series of calculations to determine the exact 
speed and torque of the motor. The input and output sections are similar to the PWM drive. 
The controller is the difference. By sensing the magnitude of the current to the motor, a cur-
rent feedback is created. By sensing speed in relation to the current, a speed feedback is created. 
The speed is monitored by a tachometer, an encoder, or a resolver. This signal is returned to the 
microprocessor controller, and then the PWM output is controlled to respond. The output is 
thus monitored to maintain set speed at a desired torque, and the field intensity and orientation 
are controlled for accurate speed control (see Figure 15–5).
Another form of the vector drive is called the sensorless vector drive. In this method, the 
manufacturer does not provide a direct connection to the motor through a speed sensor, but 
instead measures the different components of the current delivery to the motor. The concept 
of the flux-vector control is the same as in the sensor type of control, that is, to monitor the cur-
rent that produces flux and the current that produces torque and calculate the angle between 
them. This combination of the two force vectors, magnetic flux vector and torque vector,  creates 
the desired optimum combination of the two forces. Current sensors designed to measure the 
different vector currents are part of the control system. Figure 15–6 shows the basic control

scheme. With the measurements, the microprocessor is used to calculate the slip and therefore 
can compensate for speed and torque changes by adjusting the output IGBTs.
CORRECT APPLICATION
When selecting a starter for a particular motor drive situation, you should consider several 
things. Is there a need for solid-state starting if the driven machinery of the electrical supply 
lines requires a form of reduced-voltage/reduced-current starting? Consider whether the driven 
machinery can start with reduced torque, compared to full voltage ATL starting. In some cases, 
the motor can be brought up to speed with an electronic drive, and then if it is to run at a con-
stant speed, the electronics can be bypassed with an electromechanical starter. The advantages

to this method are that the electronics are not used on a continuous basis, and the heat gener-
ated by the electronic switching does not have to be dissipated by the heat sinks. The efficiency 
of the drive increases because little power is lost in the electronic rectification and inverters back 
to the AC for the motor.
If the motor is to have multiple set speeds, the correct number of frequency set points 
must be determined and matched with the controller’s capability. This is a feature that allows 
the user to set specific frequencies that the controller will hold for extended periods. If these 
are standard motor speeds, a consideration would be to use a simple control and a multispeed 
motor. Depending on the need for accuracy of the motor speed and the amount of control 
desired, various methods of control may be considered. A simple PWM drive is fairly accurate 
but does not use much feedback from the motor, whereas a vector drive has tighter  control and 
more feedback from the motor  operations.
SOLID-STATE SENSORS
Along with the evolution of the motor starter in the use of electronics for the control of power 
is the evolution of the sensor industry to feed signals to the controllers. The controllers may be 
programmable controllers (PC), which in turn supply a signal to an electromechanical starter 
or to an electronic controller. Whatever finally controls the motor speed and direction needs

sensory input from the real world. These inputs can be light, heat, pressure, proximity, sound, 
or any other sense that starts some predetermined sequence of operation for the motor. Sensors 
now can be electronic rather than electromechanical in many cases. The limit switch, which has 
a feeler or roller as in Figure 15–7, can be replaced by an inductive or capacitive sensor, which 
does not require physical contact to sense an object’s presence.
Proximity Sensors
Proximity sensors (controls) are available in two types: inductive sensors and capacitive sen-
sors. A typical inductive sensor is an electronic circuit type of sensor that produces a small 
magnetic field at a radio frequency (RF). As the magnetic waves are produced, a tuned cir-
cuit is set to react to an altered oscillation created by a detected metal object. The tuning of 
these circuits is adjustable to account for the distance of detection and the amount of metal

that is required before sensing is accomplished. As a metal object approaches the inductive 
proximity sensor, the magnetic coil in the sensor actually induces eddy currents into the 
detected target. This causes a change in the RF oscillations, and the amplitude on the RF 
is reduced or dampened. This dampened signal is detected by the driving electronics and 
switches the proximity sensor output to an “on,” or dampened, state. As the object moves 
away from the sensor, the oscillator output returns to the undampened state, which allows 
the output to turn off.
Inductive proximity sensors work well in dirty or greasy environments where photo sen-
sors do not work well. They have very fast response and can detect lightweight objects that 
cannot be detected by mechanical limit switches. Inductive sensors also can be used to detect 
metal objects behind nonmetallic materials such as glass or plastic. The two drawbacks to an 
inductive sensor are that the target to be detected must be metal, and the distance of detection 
is limited to approximately 4 in. The output of these sensors can be a relay contact or other type 
of output desired for the associated control circuitry (see Figure 15–8).
Capacitive sensors work because of the effects of different materials on the dielectric con-
stant of a capacitive device. Various nonmetal materials have different dielectric constants. As a 
material is sensed by a capacitive sensor, the dielectric constant of the circuit changes and starts 
an oscillation that is detected by the receiver. This altered condition initiates the electronics to 
cause an output relay to change state (open to closed, or vice versa).
The capacitive proximity sensor has an advantage over the inductive sensor in that it can 
detect both nonmetallic and metallic objects. It has a larger sensing range and can be used for

detecting liquid targets through nonmetallic barriers. It can be used for looking through glass or 
plastic tanks to detect liquid or other materials, such as plastic pellets in a feeder hopper.
The capacitive sensor has several limitations. It is more affected by moisture and humid-
ity, and if embedded in the equipment, the surrounding material must be considered in the 
calibration. Also, because it has greater sensing range, more space must be maintained between 
sensors, and the target area must be well defined (see Figure 15–9).
Many types of sensors as well as many types of pilot devices are available. All are intended 
to provide input information to control electrical systems. Up to this point, we have only dis-
cussed simple on-off control schemes where the pilot device is the decision point to energize 
or de-energize a motor starter. If more complex controls are needed with many different inputs 
controlling many different output functions, another decision maker may be needed, such as a 
programmable controller.

Photoelectric Controls
Photoelectric sensors have a wide variety of methods to detect an object. Other than mechani-
cal actuation, other types of sensors are also used. Photoelectric controls are used where physi-
cal contact is not needed or desired. Photoelectric control covers a broad spectrum of controls. 
The light used is not always visible. The light may be anywhere in the light spectrum from 
ultraviolet at one end to infrared at the other (see Figure 15–10).
The methods of gathering or sensing the light also may vary. Photoelectric controls use a 
variety of devices to detect the presence or absence of light.
Photodiode sensors are light-activated sensors with a semiconductor diode that uses a 
clear covering for the diode case. Because the diode is operated in reverse bias, it does not allow 
current to flow in the circuit when no light is striking the transparent case. However, as light 
energy increases on the diode, current is allowed to flow in the circuit. This, in turn, controls a 
transistor to provide the switching needed in the circuit.
Photoresistive cells (or photoconductive cells) also are used. Often the concept used in 
photoelectric control is employed to monitor surrounding daylight conditions and control out-
door lighting. When light strikes the photoresistive cell, the resistance of the device drops and 
allows a larger current to flow. The resultant current flow often picks up a relay (electronic relay) 
to provide the desired switching result. A cadmium sulfide cell (cad cell) is used because the 
resistance changes from approximately 50 ohms in direct sunlight to many thousands of ohms 
when dark.
When used in conjunction with more electronic circuitry, the switching point of the relay 
can be changed to reflect a desired light level control. Older types of photocells often used a 
metal hood to cover the cad cell. This allowed control of the amount of light on the cell and 
allowed adjustment of the activation point.
Caution: When installing photocells to control lighting based on available (ambient) 
light, make sure the cell faces away from the light source you are controlling. Otherwise, as dusk 
arrives (and you want to turn on the outdoor lighting), the cad cell looking at the light source 
turns off the lights it just turned on. The result is blinking lights that go on and off all night.

Photovoltaic cells are sometimes also 
used. As the name implies, the cell actually 
creates or generates a voltage as the light 
strikes the cell. Current silicon photovolta-
ic cells (solar cells) produce approximately 
0.5-volt DC at 150 mA for each square inch 
of cell area. The symbol in Figure 15–11 
indicates that the cell actually produces a 
DC voltage and is useful where an external 
voltage source may not be  convenient.
Sensor style and technique are differ-
ent based on the type of sensor and appli-
cation. Photosensors that use their own 
internal light source rather than ambient 
light use one of several styles of reflection techniques to “see” the light source. The items to be 
seen, the physical space, and the surrounding light help determine which reflective technique 
should be used.
Retroreflective scan sensors use a light source and receiver mounted in the same enclosure. 
The light is directed toward a reflective surface such as a common bicycle type of reflector (see 
Figure 15–12). The reflected light is detected by the receiver and in turn picks up a relay. Often 
these devices can be arranged to pick light or pick dark. Pick light means the relay is energized 
with a completed light beam. Pick dark means the relay is picked up when the light beam is 
obstructed and the light is not reflected.
Retroreflective sensors are a good 
style to use when you have room for a 
reflector and the object to be sensed is 
not reflective itself. In addition, the align-
ment is not critical, so some vibration of 
the scanner or reflector is tolerated. The 
typical distance limit to the target reflec-
tor is approximately 40 ft. One advantage 
of the retroreflective type of sensor is that 
all wiring is to one device with a nonelec-
trical reflector placed where convenient. 
Retroreflective scan also could be used 
to count objects that have reflective tape 
applied. As the objects move past the 
sensor, the reflected light causes a con-
tact closure in the retroreflective sensor.

Diffuse scan sensors use the principle 
of a light source directed at the surface 
of objects that are not reflective. Most of 
the light source is absorbed by the object, 
and the rest is diffused in all directions. A 
receiver is placed at about the same dis-
tance from the surface as the light source. 
The small amount of light that is returned 
to the receiver indicates presence of the 
object. Most diffuse scan sensors use a lens 
to collinate, or make the light rays paral-
lel, so that the receiver can receive more 
returned light. These sensors are used in 
close proximity to the object to be detected 
(see Figure 15–13).
A convergent beam is used to detect objects that are near other reflective surfaces, or 
for scanning small objects (see Figure 15–14). Convergent beam sensors use the light source 
and sensing device in a single head. The light beam is focused or converged at the object to be 
sensed. This is a fixed distance determined by the sensor and is adjustable by field focus con-
trols. If the object is not at the focal point of the beam, no light is reflected back to the receiver. 
If an object is at the focal point (not in front of or behind the focal point), a small amount 
of light is reflected to the receiver. Only one head is used and the surrounding surfaces are

ignored. Convergent beam sensors are 
ideal where the objects are near other 
surfaces or where the objects have low 
reflectivity.
Specular scan sensors use a light 
source and a receiver mounted at angles 
to each other, as in Figure 15–15. The 
principle is to use a reflected light beam 
off a shiny object. The focal point is 
set to reflect light from the light source 
to the receiver. If an object interferes 
with that reflection, the receiver “sees” 
the object. Another option is for the 
object to complete the reflected beam. 
By adjusting the angle of reflection, a 
shiny object can cause the beam to be 
reflected back to the receiver to “see” 
the object. Mounting angles are very 
precise, and a lot of vibration is not 
tolerated.
The least complicated sensor is called direct scan. This method uses a transmitter (light 
source) and a receiver, as shown in Figure 15–16. If an object passes between the transmitter 
and receiver, the beam is broken and the object is detected. Alignment is critical in the sensors,

and wiring is required to both the transmitter and receiver. Direct-scan sensors are harder to 
keep in alignment, but they are used extensively.
Many light sources use visible light, but the options include ultra violet light and infrared 
light. When sources other than visible light are used, aids are required to help set up, aim, and 
troubleshoot the devices. To determine whether an infrared light source is emitting, a small 
portable receiver is used to detect light output. If the light receiver is suspected to be defec-
tive, a portable light source can be used to transmit a known beam to the receiver. After that, 
troubleshooting regarding focus, improper application, or replacement of the defective device 
can proceed.
Fiber optics are also used to sense objects. Light is transmitted through a fiber-optic cable 
to the point where an object is to be detected. This allows the sensor to be located out of the 
way, and only the small cables have to be installed at the sensing location. Bifurcated fiber-optic 
cable uses the same fiber bundle to send and receive light (see Figure 15–17). A “thru” scan has 
a transmitter and receiver cable as separate cables.
Be sure to check the manufacturer’s specifications when determining the proper photo-
electric device to use. Specific application is important. Ambient light, temperature, vibration, 
moisture, and surrounding dust are all important considerations.
Strain gauges sense pressure and therefore can measure weight. An electronic strain 
gauge is typically made up of resistive components built into a wheatstone bridge configura-
tion. The four parts of the bridge are shown in Figure 15–18. By bonding the semiconductors 
to a pressure-sensitive diaphragm, a change in expansion or contraction causes the resistance 
of the semiconductor to change. With a supply voltage applied, the output voltage is propor-
tional to the change of the bridge resistance. With no pressure applied, the output is zero 
volts. As the pressure on the electronic elements changes, two of them increase resistance, 
and the other two decrease resistance. The output voltage proportionally changes to measure 
compression. The analog output voltage can then be sent to a monitor or controller to initiate 
some action. These strain gauges often have temperature stabilizers and offset adjustments to 
allow for calibration.

Temperature detection for industrial control is usually done through thermistors or 
resistive temperature detectors (RTDs). Thermistors are resistors that change resistance due 
to thermal effects, known as thermal resistors (shortened to thermistors). If the thermistor has 
a negative temperature coefficient, it means that as the temperature of the semiconductor 
rises, the resistance has a negative effect, or decreases (noted as NTC in Figure 15–19). If the 
resistance were to rise with an increase in temperature, the component would have a positive 
temperature coefficient. The resistors can be used directly in a circuit, which changes current 
flow as the resistance changes, or can be placed in a bridge much like a strain gauge to control 
an output voltage.

An RTD typically uses metals that exhibit a positive temperature coefficient. Nickel and 
platinum are commonly used as the metals in the RTD sensing point. Nickel is used to sense 
temperature because it has a large change in resistance with small changes in temperature. 
Platinum is used when the temperature variations are large and therefore the ratio of the tem-
perature to change of resistance is large. The RTD assembly is usually encased in a sensor style, 
and only the connection leads are available for connection.
IEC STANDARDS
To compete in the world market, U.S. manufacturers must produce goods that meet the techni-
cal and consumer requirements of other countries. The emphasis in Europe, for example, has 
been to produce electrical products that are more specific to need. This reduces the usage range 
and the amount of materials needed for the starter. Although customers of such products do not 
pay for more than they need, the products are not as rugged under adverse conditions.
The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), headquartered in Geneva, 
Switzerland, is a counterpart to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA). 
IEC standards can be used to select the most suitable controller. The IEC philosophy is that uti-
lization is a critical part of the selection process. The user must choose the utilization category, 
and then select a product in that category that fits the need. In addition, the user must check to 
determine if the manufacturer’s contact life rating is adequate for the purpose. Typical utiliza-
tion categories are presented in Figure 15–20. Contact life is also taken into account. To make 
the proper selection, use the proper application selection graphs, as shown in Figure 15–21.
The horizontal axis (Ie) in Figure 15–21 represents the operational current that the power 
contacts must handle. The vertical axis represents the number of operating cycles that can be 
expected in the contactor life. Read along the Ie axis to the point of the normal full-load current,

and then up to the point a particular contactor crosses the current line. Reading horizontally 
over to the left supplies the projected number of operations. For example, the AC3 category 
is for starters that control squirrel-cage motors and that switch off only after the motor is up 
to speed. A 5 hp, 460-volt, three-phase motor draws 15.2 amperes according to NEC® Table 
430.250. Using this data, read 15.2 amperes on the Ie axis. Read straight up to where the bold 
line crosses the A18 vertical line. Contactor A18 would provide approximately 1.5 million 
operations. If that does not seem sufficient, go up to the A24 bold line crossing the 15-ampere 
vertical line. An A24 may provide 3 million operations.
Certain considerations must be taken into account when selecting NEMA or IEC stan-
dards for installations. How much expertise do you need to make the proper selection? Do you 
want to dedicate the increased space usually needed for NEMA controllers? Do you have a good 
understanding of the application? If you are replacing an existing installation, what other com-
ponents have to be changed? How much is cost a factor compared to interchangeability? Are 
overloads adjustable or changeable? These questions, along with the difference in price, must 
be considered when determining the proper selection.
SUMMARY
The advancement of electronics into the control of electrical high-power equipment has many 
facets. From the measurement of the real world and the collection of measurements, the infor-
mation can be sent to control the power circuits of large motors through the use of high-power 
transistors. To correctly design, build, test, or troubleshoot a complex system, a solid knowledge 
of all the various components is necessary. To properly retrofit a failed system or diagnose 
problems in a malfunctioning system, a working knowledge of terminology and capabilities 
is necessary. Solid-state drives have many applications and in many cases can replace obsolete 
mechanical control systems. Solid-state pilot devices can also be used to resolve some of the 
toughest sensor problems.

Until the past several years, AC variable speed control was very difficult with a standard 
motor. Therefore, a different type of motor and control system was developed and used exten-
sively for years. This motor is rarely installed as a new system now. Maintenance electricians 
must be familiar with this type of motor and control system.
Many industrial motor applications require three-phase motors with variable speed con-
trol. The squirrel-cage induction motor cannot be used without additional controls for variable 
speed work, because its speed is essentially constant. Another type of induction motor was 
developed for variable speed applications. This motor is called the wound-rotor induction motor 
or slip-ring AC motor.
WOUND-ROTOR AC MOTORS
Wound-rotor motor drives use a specially constructed AC motor to accomplish speed control 
and for their inherent ability to provide high starting torque with relatively low starting current. 
These motors are now installed in heavy manufacturing needs such as ball mills, shredders, and 
cement mills, to provide a rugged motor with the ability to bring high-inertia loads up to speed 
smoothly. The windings of the motor rotor are brought out of the motor through slip rings 
on the rotor shaft. Figure 16–1 shows an elementary diagram of a wound-rotor motor with an 
adjustable speed drive. These windings are connected to a controller that places variable resis-
tors in series with the windings. The torque performance of the motor can be controlled using 
these variable resistors or liquid rheostats.
Wound-rotor motors are more common in the larger sizes, that is, 100 to 1000 hp and above.
Features of Wound-Rotor Motors
Wound-rotor motors have the following advantages, which make them suitable for a variety of 
applications:
• Cost—The initial cost is moderate for the high horsepower units.
• Control—Not all the power need be controlled, resulting in a moderate size and simple 
controller.

• Construction—The simple construction of the motor and control lends itself to mainte-
nance without the need for a high level of training.
• High-inertia loads—The drive works well on high-inertia loads.
Disadvantages of Wound-Rotor Motors
Wound-rotor motors also have disadvantages:
• Custom motor—The motor has a rotor wound with wire and slip rings, and is not easily 
available, but is still manufactured.
• Efficiency—The drive does not maintain a high efficiency at low speeds.
• Speed range—The drive usually is limited to a speed range of two to one.
CONSTRUCTION DETAILS
A wound-rotor induction motor consists of a stator core with a three-phase winding, a wound 
rotor with slip rings, brushes and brush holders, and two end shields to house the bearings that 
support the rotor shaft.
Figures 16–2, 16–3, 16–4, and 16–5 show the basic parts of a wound-rotor induction motor.

The Stator
A typical stator contains a three-phase winding held in place in the slots of a laminated steel 
core, shown in Figure 16–3. The winding consists of formed coils arranged and connected so 
that three single-phase windings are spaced 120 electrical degrees apart. The separate single-
phase windings are connected either in wye or delta. Three line leads are brought out to a termi-
nal box mounted on the frame of the motor. This is the same construction as the squirrel-cage 
motor stator.
The Rotor
The rotor consists of a cylindrical core composed of steel laminations. Slots cut into the cylin-
drical core hold the formed coils of wire for the rotor winding.
The rotor winding consists of three single-phase windings spaced 120 electrical degrees 
apart. The single-phase windings are connected either in wye or delta. (The rotor winding must

have the same number of poles as the stator winding.) The three leads from the three-phase 
rotor winding terminate at three slip rings mounted on the rotor shaft. Leads from carbon 
brushes that ride on these slip rings are connected to an external speed controller to vary the 
rotor resistance for speed control.
The brushes are held securely to the slip rings of the wound rotor by adjustable springs 
mounted in the brush holders. The brush holders are fixed in one position. For this type of 
motor, it is not necessary to shift the brush position as is sometimes required in DC generator 
and motor work.
The Motor Frame
The motor frame is made of cast steel. The stator core is pressed directly into the frame. Two 
end shields are bolted to the cast steel frame. One of the end shields is larger than the other 
because it must house the brush holders and brushes that ride on the slip rings of the wound 
rotor. In addition, it often contains removable inspection covers.
The bearing arrangement is the same as that used in squirrel-cage induction motors. 
Either sleeve bearings or ball-bearing units are used in the end shields.
PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
When three currents, 120 electrical degrees apart, pass through the three single-phase windings 
in the slots of the stator core, a rotating magnetic field is developed. This field travels around the 
stator. The speed of the rotating field depends on the number of stator poles and the frequency of 
the power source. This speed is called the synchronous speed and is determined by applying the for-
mula used to find the synchronous speed of the rotating field of squirrel-cage induction motors.
Synchronous speed in RPM = 120 × Frequency in hertz
Number of poles
or
RPM = 120 × f
p
As the rotating field travels at synchronous speed, it cuts the three-phase winding of the 
rotor and induces voltages in this winding. The rotor winding is connected to the three slip rings 
mounted on the rotor shaft. The brushes riding on the slip rings connect to an external wye-
connected group of resistors (speed controller), shown in Figure 16–6. The induced voltages in 
the rotor windings set up currents that follow a closed path from the rotor winding to the wye-
connected speed controller. The rotor currents create a magnetic field in the rotor core based on

transformer action. This rotor field reacts with the stator field to develop the torque that causes 
the rotor to turn. The speed controller is sometimes called the secondary resistance control.
Starting Theory of Wound-Rotor Induction Motors
To start the motor, all resistance of the wye-connected speed controller is inserted in the rotor 
circuit. The stator circuit is energized from the three-phase line. The voltage induced in the 
rotor develops currents in the rotor circuit. The rotor currents, however, are limited in value by 
the resistance of the speed controller. As a result, the stator current also is limited in value. In 
other words, to minimize the starting surge of current to a wound-rotor induction motor, insert 
the full resistance of the speed controller in the rotor circuit. The starting torque is affected by 
the resistance inserted in the rotor secondary. With resistance in the secondary, the power factor 
of the rotor is high or close to unity. This means that the rotor current is nearly in phase with 
the rotor-induced voltage. If the rotor current is in phase with the rotor-induced voltage, then 
the rotor magnetic poles are being produced at the same time as the stator poles. This creates 
a strong magnetic effect, which creates a strong starting torque. As the motor accelerates, steps 
of resistance in the wye-connected speed controller can be cut out of the rotor circuit until the 
motor accelerates to its rated speed.
Speed Control
The insertion of resistance in the rotor circuit not only limits the starting surge of current but 
also produces a high starting torque and provides a means of adjusting the speed. If the full resis-
tance of the speed controller is inserted into the rotor circuit when the motor is running, the 
rotor current decreases and the motor slows down. As the rotor speed decreases, more voltage 
is induced in the rotor windings, and more rotor current is developed to create the necessary 
torque at the reduced speed.

If all resistance is removed from the rotor circuit, the current and motor speed increase. 
However, the rotor speed is always less than the synchronous speed of the field developed by 
the stator windings. Recall that this fact also is true of the squirrel-cage induction motor. The 
speed of a wound-rotor motor can be controlled manually or automatically with timing relays, 
contactors, and electronic speed control.
Through the use of solid-state controls, the wound-rotor motor can be started with the 
full secondary resistance in the circuit, and then the input power is also controlled to provide 
smooth acceleration and maximum torque. As the motor reaches full input voltage, the second-
ary resistors can be removed from the circuit, and the motor will operate with similar charac-
teristics to a squirrel-cage motor. When resistance is reinserted in the secondary circuit, the 
motor speed slows, and the primary electronic drive can also be adjusted to provide gradual 
speed adjustment.
Torque Performance
As a load is applied to the motor, both the percent slip of the rotor and the torque developed in 
the rotor increase. As shown in the graph in Figure 16–7, the relationship between the torque 
and percent slip is practically a straight line.

Figure 16–7 illustrates that the torque performance of a wound-rotor induction motor 
is good whenever the full resistance of the speed controller is inserted in the rotor circuit. 
The large amount of resistance in the rotor circuit causes the rotor current to be almost in phase 
with the induced voltage of the rotor. As a result, the field set up by the rotor current is almost 
in phase with the stator field. If the two fields reach a maximum value at the same instant, there 
will be a strong magnetic reaction resulting in a high torque output.
However, if all speed controller resistance is removed from the rotor circuit and the 
motor is started, the torque performance is poor. The rotor circuit minus the speed controller 
resistance consists largely of inductive reactance. This means that the rotor current lags behind 
the induced voltage of the rotor, and thus the rotor current lags behind the stator current. As 
a result, the rotor field set up by the rotor current lags behind the stator field that is set up by 
the stator current. The resulting magnetic reaction of the two fields is relatively small, because 
they reach their maximum values at different points. In summary, then, the starting torque 
output of a wound-rotor induction motor is poor when all resistance is removed from the 
rotor circuit.
Speed Regulation
As discussed previously, inserting resistance at the speed controller improves the starting torque 
of a wound-rotor motor at low speeds. However, there is an opposite effect at normal speeds. In 
other words, the speed regulation of the motor is poorer when resistance is added in the rotor 
circuit at a higher speed. For this reason, the resistance of the speed controller is removed as the 
motor comes up to its rated speed.
Figure 16–8 shows the speed performance of a wound-rotor induction motor. Note that 
the speed characteristic curve resulting when all the resistance is cut out of the speed control-
ler indicates relatively good speed regulation. The second speed characteristic curve, resulting 
when all the resistance is inserted in the speed controller, has a marked drop in speed as the load 
increases. This indicates poor speed regulation.
Power Factor
The power factor of a wound-rotor induction motor at no load is as low as 15% to 20% lag. 
However, as load is applied to the motor, the power factor improves and increases to 85% to 
90% lag at rated load.
Figure 16–9 shows a graph of the power factor performance of a wound-rotor induction 
motor from a no-load c ondition to full load. The low lagging power factor at no load is because 
the magnetizing component of load  current is such a large part of the total motor current. The 
 magnetizing component of load current  magnetizes the iron, causing interaction between the 
rotor and the stator by mutual inductance.

As the mechanical load on the motor increases, the  in-phase component of  current 
increases to supply the increased power demands. The magnetizing component of the 
current remains the same, however. Because the total motor current is now more nearly in 
phase with the line v oltage, there is an improvement in the power factor.
Operating Efficiency
Both a wound-rotor induction motor with all the resistance cut out of the speed controller 
and a squirrel-cage induction motor show nearly the same efficiency performance. However, 
when a motor must operate at slow speeds with all the resistance cut in the rotor circuit, the 
efficiency of the motor is poor because of the power loss in watts in the resistors of the speed 
controller.
Figure 16–10 illustrates the efficiency performance of a wound-rotor induction motor.

The electrician should never attempt to reverse the direction of rotation of a wound-rotor 
induction motor by interchanging any of the leads feeding from the slip rings to the speed 
controller. Changes in these connections will not reverse the direction of rotation of the motor.
SUMMARY
The wound-rotor motor is rarely installed as a new motor today, but many of these motors are 
still in use. Wound-rotor motors are typically larger horsepower motors assigned to special 
applications. The wound-rotor motor may be used for variable speed with the insertion of sec-
ondary resistors. The starting current and starting torque of the motor were the prime consid-
erations when selecting the wound-rotor motor for installation. There are still many references 
to the wound-rotor motor used in the National Electrical Code®.

The synchronous motor, shown in Figure 17–1, is a three-phase AC motor that operates at 
a constant speed from a no-load condition to full load. This type of motor has a revolving field 
that is separately excited from a DC source. In this respect, it is similar to a three-phase AC gen-
erator. If the DC field excitation is changed, the power factor of a synchronous motor can be 
varied over a wide range of lagging and leading values.
The synchronous motor is used in many industrial applications because of its fixed-
speed characteristic over the range from no load to full load. This type of motor is also used 
to correct or improve the power factor of three-phase AC industrial circuits, thereby reducing 
operating costs.
CONSTRUCTION DETAILS
A three-phase synchronous motor basically consists of a stator core with a three-phase winding 
(similar to an induction motor), a revolving DC field with an auxiliary or amortisseur winding 
and slip rings, brushes and brush holders, and two end shields housing the bearings that sup-
port the rotor shaft. An amortisseur winding (Figure 17–2) consists of copper bars embedded in 
the cores of the poles. The copper bars of this special type of squirrel-cage winding are welded 
to end rings on each side of the rotor.

Both the stator winding and the core of a synchronous motor are similar to those of the three-
phase AC induction motor and the wound-rotor induction motor. The leads for the stator winding 
are marked T1, T2, and T3 and terminate in an outlet box mounted on the side of the motor frame.
The rotor of the synchronous motor has salient field poles. The field coils are connected 
in series for alternate polarity. The number of rotor field poles must equal the number of stator 
field poles. The field circuit leads are brought out to two slip rings mounted on the rotor shaft 
for brush-type motors. Carbon brushes mounted in brush holders make contact with the two 
slip rings. The terminals of the field circuit are brought out from the brush holders to a second 
terminal box mounted on the frame of the motor. The leads for the field circuit are marked 
F1 and F2. A squirrel-cage, or amortisseur, winding is provided for starting because the synchro-
nous motor is not self-starting without this feature. The rotor shown in Figure 17–2 has salient 
poles and an amortisseur winding.
Two end shields are provided on a synchronous motor. One of the end shields is larger 
than the second shield because it houses the DC brush-holder assembly and slip rings. Either 
sleeve bearings or ball-bearing units are used to support the rotor shaft. The bearings are also 
housed in the end shields of the motor.
PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
When the rated three-phase voltage is applied to the stator windings, a rotating magnetic field 
is developed. This field travels at the synchronous speed. As stated in previous units, the syn-
chronous speed of the magnetic field depends on the frequency of the three-phase voltage and 
the number of stator poles.

The magnetic field that is developed by the stator windings travels at synchronous speed 
and cuts across the squirrel-cage winding of the rotor. Both voltage and current are induced in 
the bars of the rotor winding. The resulting magnetic field of the amortisseur (squirrel-cage) 
winding reacts with the stator field to create a torque that causes the rotor to turn.
The rotation of the rotor increases in speed to a point slightly below the synchronous 
speed of the stator, about 92% to 97% of the motor rated speed. There is a small slip in the 
speed of the rotor behind the speed of the magnetic field set up by the stator. In other words, 
the motor is started as a squirrel-cage induction motor.
The field circuit is now connected 
to a source of direct current, and fixed 
magnetic poles are set up in the rotor field 
cores. The magnetic poles of the rotor are 
attracted to the unlike magnetic poles set 
up by the stator magnetic field.
Figure 17–3 and Figure 17–4 show 
how the rotor field poles lock with unlike 
poles of the stator field. After the field 
poles are locked, the rotor speed becomes 
the same as the speed of the  magnetic 
field set up by the stator windings. In 
other words, the speed of the rotor is 
now equal to the synchronous speed.
Remember that a synchronous 
motor must always be started as a three-
phase AC induction motor with the DC 
field excitation disconnected. The DC 
field circuit is added only after the rotor 
accelerates to a value near the synchro-
nous speed. The motor then operates 
as a synchronous motor, locked in step 
with the stator rotating field.
If an attempt is made to start a 
three-phase synchronous motor by 
first energizing the DC field circuit and 
then applying the three-phase voltage 
to the stator windings, the motor will 
not start because the net torque is zero. 
At the instant the three-phase voltage 
is applied to the stator windings, the

magnetic field set up by the stator current turns at the synchronous speed. The rotor, with its 
magnetic poles of fixed polarity, is attracted first by an unlike stator pole and attempts to turn 
in that direction. However, before the rotor can turn, another stator pole of opposite polarity 
moves into position, and the rotor then attempts to turn in the opposite direction. Because of 
this action of the alternating poles, the net torque is zero and the motor does not start.
DC Field Excitation
In early models, the field circuit is excited from an external DC source. A DC generator may be 
coupled to the motor shaft to supply the DC excitation current.
Figure 17–5 shows the connections for a synchronous motor. A field rheostat in the sepa-
rately excited field circuit varies the current in the field circuit. Changes in the field current affect 
the strength of the magnetic field developed by the revolving rotor. Small variations in the rotor 
field strength do not immediately affect the motor, which continues to operate at a constant speed. 
However, changes in the DC field excitation do change the power factor of a synchronous motor.
Brushless Solid-State Excitation
An improvement in synchronous motor excitation is the development of the brushless 
DC  exciter. The commutator of a conventional direct-connected exciter is replaced with a 
three-phase, bridge-type, solid-state rectifier. The DC output is then fed directly to the motor 
field winding. Simplified circuitry is shown in Figure 17–6. A stationary field ring for the AC 
exciter receives DC from a small rectifier in the motor control cabinet. This rectifier is powered 
from the AC source. The exciter DC field is also adjustable. Rectifier solid-state diodes change 
the exciter AC output to DC. This DC is the source of excitation for the rotor field poles. 
Silicon-controlled rectifiers, activated by the solid-state field control circuit, replace electrome-
chanical relays and the contactors of the conventional brush-type synchronous motor.
The field discharge resistor is inserted during motor starting. At motor synchronizing 
pull-in speed, the field discharge circuit is automatically opened and DC excitation is applied

to the rotor field pole windings. Excitation is automatically removed if the motor pulls out of 
step (synchronization) due to an overload or a voltage failure. The brushless rotor is shown in 
Figure 17–7. Mounted on the rotor shaft is the armature of the AC exciter, the AC output of 
which is rectified to DC by the silicon diodes. Brush and commutator problems are eliminated 
with this system. (The stator of a brushless motor is similar to that of a brush type of motor.)
Power Factor
A poor lagging power factor results when the field current is decreased below normal by insert-
ing all the resistance of the rheostat in the field circuit. The three-phase AC circuit to the stator 
supplies some magnetizing current, which helps strengthen the weak DC field. This magnetizing 
component of current lags the voltage by 90 electrical degrees. Because the magnetizing compo-
nent of current becomes a large part of the total current input, a low lagging power factor results.
If a weak DC field is strengthened, the power factor improves. As a result, the three-phase 
AC circuit to the stator supplies less magnetizing current. The magnetizing component of  current

becomes a smaller part of the total current input to the stator winding, and the power factor 
increases. If the field strength is increased sufficiently, the power factor increases to unity, or 100%. 
When a power factor value of unity is reached, the three-phase AC circuit does not supply any rotor 
current and the DC field circuit supplies all current necessary to maintain a strong rotor field. The 
value of DC field excitation required to achieve unity power factor is called normal field excitation.
If the magnetic field of the rotor is strengthened further by increasing the DC field current 
above the normal field excitation value, the power factor decreases. However, the power factor 
is leading when the DC field is overexcited. The three-phase AC circuit feeding the stator wind-
ing delivers a demagnetizing component of current that opposes the too-strong rotor field. This 
action results in a weakening of the rotor field to its normal magnetic strength.
The diagrams in Figure 17–8 show how the DC field is aided or opposed by the magnetic 
field set up by the AC windings. It is assumed in Figure 17–8 that the DC field is stationary and

a revolving armature is connected to the AC source. Keep in mind the fact that most synchro-
nous motors have stationary AC windings and a revolving DC field. For either case, however, 
the principle of operation is the same.
Figure 17–9 shows two characteristic operating curves for a three-phase synchronous 
motor. With normal full-field excitation, the power factor has a peak value of unity, or 100% 
and the AC stator current is at its lowest value. As the DC field current is decreased in value, 
the power factor decreases into the lag quadrant, and there is a resulting rapid rise in the AC 
stator current. If the DC field current is increased above the normal field excitation value, 
the power factor decreases in the lead quadrant, and a rapid rise in the AC stator current 
results.

It has been shown that a synchronous motor operated with an overexcited DC field has 
a leading power factor. For this reason, a three-phase synchronous motor is often connected to 
a three-phase industrial feeder circuit with a low lagging power factor. In other words, the syn-
chronous motor with an overexcited DC field helps correct the power factor of the industrial 
feeder circuit.
In Figure 17–10, two induction motors with lagging power factors are connected to an 
industrial feeder circuit. The synchronous motor connected to the same feeder is operated with 
an overexcited DC field. Because the synchronous motor can be adjusted so that the resulting 
power factor is leading, the power factor of the industrial feeder can be corrected until it reaches 
a value near unity, or 100%.
Reversing Rotation
The direction of rotation of a synchronous motor is reversed by interchanging any two of the 
three line leads feeding the stator winding. The direction of rotation of the motor does not 
change if the two conductors of the DC source are interchanged.
INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS
The three-phase synchronous motor is used when a prime mover having a constant speed 
from a no-load condition to full load is required, such as fans, air compressors, and pumps. 
The synchronous motor is used in some industrial applications to drive a mechanical load and 
also to correct the power factor. In some applications, this type of motor is used only to correct 
the power factor of an industrial power system. When the synchronous motor is used only to

 correct the power factor and does not drive any mechanical load, it serves the same purpose as a 
bank of capacitors used for power factor correction. Therefore, in such an installation the motor 
is called a synchronous capacitor.
Three-phase synchronous motors up to a rating of 10 hp are usually started directly across 
the rated three-phase voltage. Synchronous motors of larger sizes are started through a starting 
compensator or an automatic starter. In this type of starting, the voltage applied to the motor 
terminals at the instant of start is about half the value of the rated line voltage, and the starting 
surge of current is limited.
SUMMARY
The AC synchronous motor is used where speed must be kept constant. As the name implies, 
the motor runs at the designed synchronous speed. The principle used in the larger three-phase 
synchronous motors is to provide a DC field for the rotor. The methods may vary in the applica-
tion of the DC. Some motors use an external DC source and feed the DC to the rotor via slip 
rings. Other motors control a magnetic field to the rotor and use solid-state rectifiers to create 
DC in the rotor. In either case, the rotor field can change the power factor of the synchronous 
motor and allow it to act as a source of leading-power factor, thereby correcting the normal 
 lagging power factor of an industrial power system.

The two principal types of single-phase induction motors are the split-phase motor and 
the capacitor motor. Both types of single-phase induction motors usually have a fractional 
horsepower rating. The split-phase motor is used to operate such devices as washing machines, 
small water pumps, oil burners, and other types of small loads not requiring a strong starting 
torque. The capacitor motor generally is used with devices requiring a strong starting torque, 
such as refrigerators and compressors. Both types of single-phase induction motors are rela-
tively low in cost, have a rugged construction, and exhibit a good operating performance.
CONSTRUCTION OF A SPLIT-PHASE INDUCTION MOTOR
The split-phase induction motor basically consists of a stator, a rotor, a centrifugal switch 
located inside the motor, two end shields housing the bearings that support the rotor shaft, and 
a cast steel frame into which the stator core is pressed. The two end shields are bolted to the cast 
steel frame. The bearings housed in the end shields keep the rotor centered within the stator so 
that it will rotate with a minimum of friction and without striking or rubbing the stator core.
The stator for a split-phase motor consists of two windings held in place in the slots of a 
laminated steel core. The two windings consist of insulated coils distributed and connected to 
make up two windings spaced 90 electrical degrees apart. One winding is the running winding, 
and the second winding is the starting winding.
The running winding consists of insulated copper wire placed at the bottom of the stator 
slots. The wire size in the starting winding is smaller than that of the running winding. These 
coils are placed on top of the running winding coils in the stator slots nearest the rotor.
Both the starting and running windings are connected in parallel to the single-phase line 
when the motor is started. After the motor accelerates to a speed equal to approximately two-
thirds to three-quarters of the rated speed, the starting winding is disconnected automatically 
from the line by means of a centrifugal switch.
The rotor for the split-phase motor has the same construction as that of a three-phase AC 
induction motor; that is, the rotor consists of a cylindrical core assembled from steel lamina-
tions. Copper bars are mounted near the surface of the rotor. The bars are brazed or welded to 
two copper end rings. In some motors, the rotor is a one-piece cast aluminum unit.
Figure 19–1 shows a typical squirrel-cage rotor for a single-phase induction motor. This 
type of rotor requires little maintenance because there are no windings, brushes, slip rings, or 
commutators. Note in the figure that the rotor fan is part of the squirrel-cage rotor assembly. 
These rotor fans maintain air circulation through the motor to prevent a large increase in the 
temperature of the windings.
The centrifugal switch is mounted inside the motor. The centrifugal switch disconnects 
the starting winding after the rotor reaches a predetermined speed, usually two-thirds to three-
quarters of the rated speed. The switch consists of a stationary part and a rotating part. The 
stationary part is mounted on one of the end shields and has two contacts that act like a single-
pole, single-throw switch. The rotating part of the centrifugal switch is mounted on the rotor.

A simple diagram of the operation of a centrifugal switch is shown in Figure 19–2. When 
the rotor is at a standstill, the pressure of the spring on the fiber ring of the rotating part keeps 
the contacts closed. When the rotor reaches approximately three-quarters of its rated speed, 
the centrifugal action of the rotor causes the spring to release its pressure on the fiber ring and 
the contacts to open. As a result, the starting winding circuit is disconnected from the line. 
Figure 19–3 shows a typical centrifugal switch used with split-phase induction motors.

Principle of Operation
When the circuit to the split-phase induction motor is closed, both the starting and running 
windings are energized in parallel. Because the running winding consists of a relatively large size 
of wire, its resistance is low. Recall that the running winding is placed at the bottom of the slots 
of the stator core. As a result, the inductive reactance of this winding is comparatively high due 
to the mass of iron surrounding it. Because the running winding has a low resistance and a high 
inductive reactance, the current of the running winding lags behind the voltage approximately 
90 electrical degrees.
The starting winding consists of a smaller size of wire; therefore, its resistance is high. 
Because the winding is placed near the top of the stator slots, the mass of iron surrounding it 
is comparatively small and the inductive reactance is low. Therefore, the starting winding has a 
high resistance and a low inductive reactance. As a result, the current of the starting winding is 
nearly in phase with the voltage.
The two windings create the split in the single phase of incoming voltage by the way the 
current reacts to the two windings (see Figure 19–4). Note that the phase split between the 
currents in the starting winding and the running winding is not the ideal 90°, but the effect is 
the same as splitting the magnetic effects of the coils to produce the rotating magnetic field 
needed to get the rotor spinning. After the starting winding is disconnected, the rotor continues 
to spin because of the pulsating magnetic field of the running winding and the momentum of 
the spinning rotor and load.
The current of the running winding lags the current of the starting winding by approxi-
mately 30 electrical degrees. These two currents, spaced 30 electrical degrees apart, pass 
through these windings, and a rotating magnetic field is developed. This field travels around

the inside of the stator core. The speed of the magnetic field is determined using the same pro-
cedure given for a three-phase induction motor.
If a split-phase induction motor has four poles on the stator windings and is connected to 
a single-phase, 60-Hz source, the synchronous speed of the revolving field is
 Synchronous RPM =  120 * ƒ
4
 RPM =  120 * 60
4
 RPM = 1800
As the rotating stator field travels at the synchronous speed, it cuts the copper bars of the 
rotor and induces voltages in the bars of the squirrel-cage winding. These induced voltages set 
up currents in the rotor bars. As a result, a rotor field is created that reacts with the stator field 
to develop the torque that causes the rotor to turn.
As the rotor accelerates to the rated speed, the centrifugal switch disconnects the starting 
winding from the line. The motor then continues to operate using only the running winding. 
Figure 19–5 illustrates the connections of the centrifugal switch at the instant the motor starts 
(switch closed) and when the motor reaches its normal running speed (switch open).

A split-phase motor must have both the starting and running windings energized when 
the motor is started. The motor resembles a two-phase induction motor in which the currents 
of these two windings are approximately 90 electrical degrees out of phase. The voltage source, 
however, is single phase; therefore, the motor is called a split-phase motor because it starts like 
a two-phase motor from a split single-phase line. After the motor accelerates to a value near its 
rated speed, it operates on the running winding as a single-phase induction motor.
If the centrifugal switch contacts fail to close when the motor stops, then the starting 
winding circuit is still open. When the motor circuit is re-energized, the motor will not start. 
The motor must have both the starting and running windings energized at the instant the motor 
circuit is closed to create the necessary starting torque. If the motor does not start but simply 
gives a low humming sound, then the starting winding circuit is open. Either the centrifugal 
switch contacts are not closed, or there is a break in the coils of the starting windings. This is 
an unsafe condition. The running winding will draw excessive current and, therefore, the motor 
must be removed from the line supply.
If the mechanical load is too great when a split-phase motor is started, or if the terminal 
voltage applied to the motor is low, then the motor may fail to reach the speed required to oper-
ate the centrifugal switch.
The starting winding is designed to operate at-line voltage for a period of only 3 or 
4 seconds while the motor is accelerating to its rated speed. It is important that the starting 
winding be disconnected from the line by the centrifugal switch as soon as the motor acceler-
ates to 75% of the rated speed. Operation of the motor on its starting winding for more than 60 
seconds may burn the insulation on the winding or cause the winding to burn out.
Some motors do not contain the mechanical type of starting switch. Instead they use a 
switch external to the motor. There are three general types of external starting switches in use 
that are external to the motor. These starting winding switches may need to be located remotely 
from the motor for ease of maintenance or because the switching may create an objectionable 
arc in a hazardous location. In these cases, a voltage- or current-operated switch may be used for 
mechanical switching, or solid-state relays may be used for arcless switching.
The voltage-operated switch is shown in Figure 19–6. Voltage-operated switches are con-
nected across the starting winding. These switches are used with capacitor-start, single-phase 
motors, but will be explained here with other starting switches. As the motor power is applied, 
current is allowed to flow through the normally closed switch to the starting winding and the 
running winding. The starting winding is a low-impedance load because of the starting capacitor 
in the circuit. The large inrush current causes a large voltage drop across the series capacitor and 
little across the motor coil. Very little voltage is dropped across the starting winding, and there-
fore little voltage is dropped across the coil for the starting switch, which keeps the relay contacts 
closed. As the rotor begins to spin, the CEMF generated into the starting coil increases, and the 
coil begins to drop a greater percentage of the line voltage. Now the starter relay coil energizes 
and opens the contacts, interrupting current to the starting winding. The induced voltage from 
the spinning rotor is enough to hold the relay contacts open while the motor is spinning.

A second style of mechanical switch is the current-operated starting switch shown in 
 Figure  19–7. The current coil is connected in series with the running winding, as shown in 
Figure 19–8. As power is applied to the single-phase motor, the current inrush to the running 
winding is relatively large (six to ten times running current). This large inrush current causes 
the current relay to pull the contacts closed, which are in series with the starting winding. These

contacts allow current to flow to the starting winding, and the rotor begins to spin. As the motor 
increases in speed, the inrush current diminishes and the current coil contacts are allowed to 
open. The starting winding is now disconnected from the line power, and the motor operates as 
a normal single-phase motor.
A third type of starting relay is the electronic relay, shown in Figure 19–9. This is used 
effectively for arcless switching of the starting winding. The relay is connected as shown in 
Figure 19–10. The concept is the same as the current-operated relay, but the sensing device is a 
thermistor. This thermistor is a solid-state device that will react to a change in temperature by 
increasing its resistance (positive temperature coefficient). Because the thermistor is in series 
with the starting winding, the current to the starting winding causes the temperature of the 
thermistor to increase, and the resistance also begins to increase from 3 to 4 ohms up to a few 
thousand ohms. This has the same effect as opening the switch to the winding. A small amount 
of current is still flowing through the high resistance to the starting winding. This current does 
not affect the motor operation, but is needed to keep the thermistor warm and the resistance 
high. This type of starting switch is sensitive to temperature, and if it is not allowed to cool 
 sufficiently, it may prevent the starting winding from performing normally during starting. Be 
sure to allow the motor to cool down between successive starts.

To reverse the rotation of the motor, simply interchange the leads of the starting winding 
(Figure 19–11). This causes the direction of the field set up by the stator windings to become 
reversed. As a result, the direction of rotation is reversed. The direction of rotation of the split-
phase motor can also be reversed by interchanging the two running winding leads. Normally, 
the starting winding is used for reversing.
Single-phase motors often have dual-voltage ratings of 115 volts and 230 volts. To obtain 
these ratings, the running winding consists of two sections. Each section of the winding is rated 
at 115 volts. One section of the running winding is generally marked T1 and T2, and the other 
section is marked T3 and T4. If the motor is to be operated on 230 volts, the two 115-volt wind-
ings are connected in series across the 230-volt line. If the motor is to be operated on 115 volts, 
then the two 115-volt windings are connected in parallel across the 115-volt line.

The starting winding usually consists of only one 115-volt winding. The leads of the 
starting winding are generally marked T5 and T8. If the motor is to be operated on 115 volts, 
both sections of the running winding are connected in parallel with the starting winding 
(Figure 19–12).

For 230-volt operation, the connection jumpers are changed in the terminal box so that 
the two 115-volt sections of the running winding are connected in series across the 230-volt 
line (Figure 19–13). Note that the 115-volt starting winding is connected in parallel with one 
section of the running winding. The voltage drop across this section of the running winding is 
115 volts, and the voltage across the starting winding is also 115 volts.

Some dual-voltage, split-phase motors have a starting winding with two sections as well as 
a running winding with two sections. The running winding sections are marked T1 and T2 for 
one section and T3 and T4 for the other section. One section of the starting winding is marked 
T5 and T6, and the second section of the starting winding is marked T7 and T8.
The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) has color coded the termi-
nal leads. If colors are used, they should be coded as follows: T1, blue; T2, white; T3, orange; 
T4, yellow; T5, black; and T8, red. If there are leads with T6 and T7, there are no assigned colors 
from the standard color markings.
Figure 19–14 shows the winding arrangement for a dual-voltage motor with two starting 
windings and two running windings. The correct connections for 115-volt operation and for 
230-volt operation are given in the table shown in Figure 19–14.
The speed regulation of a split-phase induction motor is very good. It has a speed perfor-
mance from no load to full load that is similar to that of a three-phase AC induction motor. The 
percent slip on most fractional horsepower split-phase motors is from 4% to 6%.
The starting torque of the split-phase motor is comparatively poor. The low resistance and 
high inductive reactance in the running winding circuit and the high resistance and low induc-
tive reactance in the starting winding circuit cause the two current values to be considerably 
less than 90 electrical degrees apart. The currents of the starting and running windings in many 
split-phase motors are only 30 electrical degrees out of phase with each other. As a result, the 
field set up by these currents does not develop a strong starting torque.

CAPACITOR-START, INDUCTION-RUN MOTOR
The construction of a capacitor-start motor is nearly the same as that of a split-phase induction 
motor. For the capacitor-start motor, however, a capacitor is connected in series with the starting 
windings. The capacitor is usually mounted in a metal casing on top of the motor. The capacitor 
may be mounted in any convenient external position on the motor frame and, in some cases, 
may be mounted inside the motor housing. The capacitor provides a higher starting torque than 
is obtainable with the standard split-phase motor. In addition, the capacitor limits the starting 
surge of current to a lower value than is developed by the standard split-phase motor.
The capacitor-start induction motor is used on refrigeration units, compressors, oil burn-
ers, and for small machine equipment, as well as for other applications that require a strong 
starting torque.
Principle of Operation
When the capacitor-start motor is connected for lower voltage and is started, both the running 
and starting windings are connected in parallel across the line voltage and the centrifugal switch 
is closed. The starting winding, however, is connected in series with the capacitor. When the 
motor reaches a value of approximately 75% of its rated speed, the centrifugal switch opens and 
disconnects the starting winding and the capacitor from the line. The motor then operates as a 
single-phase induction motor using only the running winding. The capacitor is used to improve 
the starting torque and does not improve the power factor of the motor.
To produce the necessary starting torque, the revolving magnetic field must have a better 
split of the single-phase line current. The capacitor added in series with the starting winding 
causes the current in the starting winding to be shifted to a leading current ahead of the volt-
age, instead of a lagging current as in the split-phase motor. Figure 19–15 illustrates the leading 
effect caused by the addition of a starting rated capacitor. The current in the starting winding

leads the line voltage by approximately 35°, and the current in the running winding lags the 
line voltage by 45°. This differential creates a split of 80°, nearing the optimum of 90 electrical 
degrees. This creates a better orientation of the magnetic fields of the stator and therefore cre-
ates more torque than a similarly sized split-phase motor.
Defective capacitors are a frequent cause of malfunctions in capacitor-start, induction-run 
motors. Some capacitor failures that can occur are listed here:
• The capacitor may short itself out, as evidenced by a lower starting torque.
• The capacitor may be “opened,” in which case the starting winding circuits will be open, 
causing the motor to fail to start.
• The capacitor may short-circuit and cause the fuse protection for the branch motor 
circuit to blow. If the fuse ratings are high and do not interrupt the power supply to the 
motor soon enough, the starting winding may burn out.
• Starting capacitors can short-circuit if the motor is turned on and off many times in a short 
period of time. To prevent capacitor failures, many motor manufacturers recommend that 
a capacitor-start motor be started no more than 20 times per hour. Therefore, this type of 
motor is used only in applications where there are relatively few starts in a short time period.
The speed performance of a capacitor-start motor is very good. The change in percent slip 
from a no-load condition to full load is from 4% to 6%. The speed performance then is the same 
as that of a standard split-phase motor.
The leads of the starting winding circuit are interchanged to reverse the direction of rota-
tion of a capacitor-start motor. As a result, the direction of rotation of the magnetic field devel-
oped by stator windings reverses in the stator core, and the rotation of the rotor is reversed (see 
Figure 19–16 for reversing lead connections).

Figure 19–17 shows a diagram of the circuit connections of a capacitor-start motor before 
the starting winding leads are interchanged to reverse the direction of rotation of the rotor. The 
diagram in Figure 19–18 shows the circuit connections of the motor after the starting winding 
leads are interchanged to reverse the direction of rotation.
A second method of changing the direction of rotation of a capacitor-start motor is to 
interchange the two running winding leads. However, this method is seldom used.

Capacitor-start, induction-run motors often have dual-voltage ratings of 115 volts and 
230 volts. The connections for a capacitor-start motor are the same as those for split-phase 
induction motors, in that the starting winding is connected across half of the series running 
winding.
CAPACITOR-START, CAPACITOR-RUN MOTOR 
OR TWO-VALUE CAPACITOR MOTOR
The capacitor-start, capacitor-run motor is similar to the capacitor-start, induction-run motor, 
except that the starting winding and capacitor are connected in the circuit at all times. This 
motor has a very good starting torque. The power factor at the rated load is nearly 100%, or 
unity, because that a capacitor is used in the motor at all times.
This type of motor can have several different designs. One type of capacitor-start, 
 capacitor-run motor has two stator windings that are spaced 90 electrical degrees apart. The 
main or running winding is connected directly across the rated line voltage. A capacitor is con-
nected in series with the starting winding, and this series combination is also connected across 
the rated line voltage. A centrifugal switch is not used, because the starting winding is energized 
through the entire operating period of the motor.
Figure 19–19 illustrates the internal connections for a capacitor-start, capacitor-run 
motor using one value of capacitance.
To reverse the rotation of this motor, the lead connections of the starting winding must be 
interchanged. This type of capacitor-start, capacitor-run motor is quiet in operation and is used 
on air compressors, fans, and small woodworking and metalworking machines.

A second type of capacitor-start, capacitor-run motor has two capacitors. Figure 19–20 
shows a diagram of the internal connections of the motor. At the instant the motor is started, the 
two capacitors are in parallel. When the motor reaches 75% of the rated speed, the  centrifugal 
switch disconnects the larger capacity capacitor. The motor then operates with the smaller 
capacitor only connected in series with the starting winding.

This type of motor has a very good starting torque, good speed regulation, and a power 
factor of nearly 100% at rated load. Applications for this type of motor include furnace stokers, 
refrigerator units, and compressors.
A third type of capacitor-start, capacitor-run motor has an autotransformer with 
one capacitor. This motor has a high starting torque and a high operating power factor. 
Figure 19–21 shows a diagram of the internal connections for this motor. When the motor is 
started, the centrifugal switch connects winding 2 to point A on the tapped autotransformer. 
As the capacitor is connected across the maximum transformer turns, it receives maximum 
voltage output on start. The capacitor thus is connected across a value of approximately 
500 volts. As a result, there is a high value of leading current in winding 2, and a strong starting 
torque is developed.
When the motor reaches approximately 75% of the rated speed, the centrifugal switch 
disconnects the starting winding from point A and reconnects this winding to point B on 
the autotransformer. Less voltage is applied to the capacitor, but the motor operates with 
both windings energized. Thus, the capacitor maintains a power factor near unity at the 
rated load.
The starting torque of this motor is very good, and the speed regulation is satisfactory. 
Applications requiring these characteristics include large refrigerators and compressors.
A permanent-split capacitor motor is shown in Figure 19–22. In this type of motor, a low 
microfarad, oil-filled capacitor is connected in series with one of the identical coil windings.

By placing a capacitor in series with one winding, the current in that winding leads the cur-
rent in the other winding, causing a split in the magnetic fields and causing the motor to rotate 
from the field with the capacitor toward the field without the capacitor. This motor is used for 
low torque requirements that may require frequent reversing. By simply closing one switch or 
the other, the capacitor will be in series with different windings, thus reversing the direction of 
motor rotation.
SHADED POLE MOTORS
Shaded pole motors are among the simplest and cheapest motors to construct. The principle of 
operation uses the effects of induction not only into the squirrel-cage rotor, but also into parts of 
the stator that create a rotating magnetic field from a single phase of input voltage. These motors 
are typically fractional horsepower ratings and are used in applications that do not require a 
great deal of starting torque.
In a simple unidirectional motor, a ring (shading ring) of solid conductor is short- circuited 
and embedded in one side of a stator winding (see Figure 19–23 and Figure 19–24).
As the voltage is applied to the top and bottom coils, the shading coil has voltage induced into 
it. Lenz’s law states that the effect of induction always opposes the cause of induction. Therefore, the 
magnetic field developed by the shading ring as current flows through its shorted winding opposes 
the main flux. This causes the main magnetic field to be shifted away from the shading ring.
As the applied voltage waveform begins to decrease from its peak value, the magnetic lines of 
force also decrease. The effect on the shading ring is the opposite. As main current flow decreases,

the magnetic effect of the shading ring 
tends to keep the same polarity as the main 
pole but increases in strength. This causes 
the stator pole to move from the main 
(unshaded) pole toward the shaded pole 
(see Figure 19–25).
Position 1 Top of stator: Main coil 
magnetic polarity is north pole. Shading 
ring opposes main with a South polarity. 
(Use Figure 19–23 as reference.)
Position 2 Top of stator: Main pole 
is less strong North polarity. Shading ring 
polarity is zero, so the stator pole moves 
toward the shading ring.
Position 3 Top of stator: Main 
pole polarity is less strong North pole. 
Shaded pole is stronger North polar-
ity. Stator pole moves more toward the 
shaded pole.
Position 4 Top of stator: Main pole 
has no current and no flux. Shaded pole 
has stronger North polarity, so stator 
pole moves toward the shaded pole.
This produces a counterclockwise 
rotation of north pole flux.
To reverse the direction of rotation on shaded pole motors, the relationship between the 
shading ring and the pole face must be reversed, as the field always moves from the unshaded to the 
shaded portion of the stator pole. Another set of shading rings on the opposite side may be shorted. 
A reversible shaded pole motor has two sets of shading rings. When one set is shorted, the other set 
is open.
Controlling the speed of shaded pole motors is easy. Either alter the voltage that is applied 
to the stator winding to produce less voltage per turn on the winding, or change the number 
of turns by using tapped windings and maintaining the same applied voltage. Either method 
changes the voltage per turn on the motor. Less voltage per turn means less flux, more slip, and 
a slower speed under load.
Shaded pole motors are typically used for fans where the blades are directly mounted 
to the rotor shaft and the air passes over the motor. These fans require little starting torque, 
and the air over the motor helps keep it cool. If these motors run hot or are in a high vibration 
area, the shading rings (which are soldered rings of conductors) can open up and cause the 
motor to fail.

SUMMARY
The single-phase induction motor is one of the most used residential and light commercial 
motors. Each application dictates the correct motor style to use. All these motors use the con-
cept of taking one phase, or one sinewave, and shifting the effects of the currents through the 
coils to create a moving magnetic field. The split-phase and capacitor-start motors use a starting 
switch to disconnect the starting windings from the line after the motor is up to running speed. 
Two-capacitor motors use multiple capacitors or variations of two-value capacitors to create a 
starting and a running circuit. All NEC® regulations that apply to three-phase motors apply to 
single-phase motors. Many exceptions apply only to small-horsepower motors.

STEPPER MOTORS
Stepper motors are specialized motors that also create incremented steps of motion rather than 
a smooth unbroken rotation. The basic stepper concept is explained using a permanent magnet 
on the rotor with two sets of poles, as shown in Figure 20–1. As the stator is energized with 
pulses of DC, the permanent magnet rotor is repelled or attracted to line up with the stator 
magnetic poles. A stepper controller provides the pulses, as illustrated in Figure 20–2.
The electronic controller provides timing and sequencing of the motor, but it operates 
electronically to provide circuit closure, as shown in Figure 20–1. For example, by moving 
switches 1 and 2 to position A or B, the top poles or the side poles can be reversed. By follow-
ing the first switch sequence where both switches are set to A, the top and right poles become 
north magnetic polarity and the rotor aligns between the poles. Step two changes switch 1 
to B. If power is left on the top poles, the rotor aligns top to bottom. When switch 1 connects 
to point B, the rotor again moves, the south rotor pole aligning between the top and left poles.

This results in counterclockwise (CCW) rotation. To reverse the direction of rotation, use the 
second set of steps. Note that by changing the sequence and length of time the coils are ener-
gized, and the direction and speed of the steps are controlled.
The rotor could be one of three different styles: the variable-reluctance rotor, the 
permanent-magnet (PM) rotor, or a combination of the two—a hybrid rotor. Rather than 
being simply two magnetic poles, the rotor is many magnetic poles lined up with the teeth 
on the rotor. The rotor’s teeth are spaced so that only one set of teeth remains in perfect 
alignment with the stator poles at any one time.
By taking the number of times the power must be applied to the stator poles to move one 
tooth through 360° of mechanical rotation, you can calculate the step angle. For example, if the 
stator needs 200 pulses of power to move one tooth 360°, then divide 360 by 200 to get 1.8° 
of motion per step. The motor will move 1.8° per pulse of stator power. Steppers are available 
step angles of 90°, 45°, 15°, 7.5°, 1.8°, and 0.9°. The resolution of the motor is a measure of how 
fine the steps are divided. Resolution is determined by dividing 360° by the step angle. The 1.8° 
step-angle motor takes 200 steps to move around a full revolution, so the resolution is 200. Step 
angle and resolution are inversely proportional to each other.
The PM rotor was used for the example on step motion control. These PM rotors are used 
with the four pole pieces to provide either 90° or 45° of step angle. This allows the motors to 
turn at higher speed, but with less resolution. The poles can be physically larger because there 
are only four of them; thus, the stator windings can carry higher current. Higher current capabil-
ity means that more torque is available.

SERVO MOTORS
Many manufacturing systems and robotic material handling systems use Servomotors to 
position controls for fast precision movement. Servo motors are small PM motors that use 
lightweight armatures to provide quick start and stop operations without a lot of inertia to 
overcome. See Figure 20–3 for a sample of a PM motor with four poles.
FIGURE 20–3 Servo motor used to produce robot joint movement.
© Cengage Learning 2014
At slow speeds of rotation, the standard PM servomotors have a tendency to create cog-
ging; that is, they tend to ratchet through the rotation rather than have smooth rotation. This 
is a result of the iron in the armature being magnetized and reacting with the PM on the stator 
pole pieces.
Servo Motor and Controllers
The two general types of AC servo-motors are considered either synchronous or asynchronous. 
Synchronous Servos do not use induction type rotors as in the most common types of AC 
motors. They do not rely on an AC induction rotor that has current induced into it. Instead 
they rely on a rotor that is made of PMs. The concept is to make the rotor as light as  possible so 
that the rotor itself has little mass and therefore little inertia to overcome as it starts and stops.

As the stator field is energized, the rotor follows the rotating magnetic field of the stator 
at the same (synchronous) speed. As the stator field stops, the rotor stops too. With a PM 
rotor, less heat is produced in the motor because it has no rotor current. Also because no 
rotor current is needed from the line, the motors are more efficient. To control where the 
rotor is with respect to the stator, feedback is required to the motor controller. An encoder 
is typically used and the information is fed back to the controller within one revolution on 
the synchronous Servo.
Asynchronous Servos rely on induction to supply current and therefore magnetic flux to 
the rotor. The rotor is like a typical squirrel cage, with efforts to keep it as light as possible to 
keep inertia low. As in regular induction motors, the rotating field of the stator cuts the rotor 
conductors and induces current into the rotor, which creates flux in the rotor. This magnetic 
field is then pushed and pulled around the stator. As with all induction motors, there is slip, as 
the rotor’s poles must fall behind the stator poles. Again, the controller must know the actual 
position of the rotor for precise speed and position controls.
Servo motors are used for exact speed, torque, and positioning of driven machines. 
Because speed is the major parameter, the speed of the rotating magnetic stator field is con-
trolled. In most cases, this is done by controlling the frequency of the applied AC to the sta-
tor. To do this, an electronic controller is used to create variable AC frequency and voltage. 
A pulse-width modulation (PWM) system is used to control the desired frequency and the 
corresponding voltage needed to drive the motor. PWMs are described in Unit 15. Be sure to 
check that a particular Servo motor is designed to fit a particular controller and that the motor 
is designed to work with PWM drives. The torque, or twisting effort of the motor, is also a 
major parameter. The rated torque is often listed at full speed, at half speed, and at zero speed 
(stalled). The stall torque is the capability to hold a load in place when there is no rotational 
speed. This stall point has an associated stall current and often lists the associated rise in tem-
perature as the needed current is applied to hold the load stationary. The winding insulation 
temperature on the motor is designed to withstand the hot spot temperature of the winding as 
it holds indefinitely the stall current and the associated torque.
Duty cycles are used as a parameter as to how long and how hard the motor can run 
without cooling down. The duty cycles are arranged from S1 to S9. S1 is a continuous rating, 
meaning no rest or “off” time is required. An S3 can run for 4 out of every 10 minutes. An S6 
runs 4 minutes at full load and 6 minutes at stalled load. Feedback of speed and position of the 
rotor is accomplished by use of encoders and resolvers. An incremental encoder is used for 
basic information (see Figure 20–4). The encode signal tells the controller whether the rotor is 
accelerating, at set speed, or decelerating (see Figure 20–5). By counting the number of pulses, 
the controller can determine how many revolutions the rotor has made since the start command 
was issued. This system closes the loop between the desired command sent to the motor and 
the actual rotor response. A variation on the encoder design and reading created a reference 
pulse for the controller to know where asynchronous Servos rotors are in their real revolutions.

There is less precision because there has to be one full revolution for the encoder to register the 
reference mark. As the need for precision increases, more sophisticated techniques are used to 
keep track of the exact position of the rotor. The controller uses a more complex system for fol-
lowing the rotor movement and keeping track of the total number of revolutions from an initial 
reference point.
Resolver methods to track the rotor movement can also be used. The resolver uses the 
technique of a rotating magnet that induces a sine wave into the receiver. The rotor uses two 
magnetic fields spaced 90° apart. As they pass the receiver, they each induce a sine wave. By 
comparing the two waveforms, the controller calculates the speed, direction, and position of the 
rotor (see Figure 20–6).

Braking and Regeneration
Motors have four general conditions: start and accelerate, run at set speed, decelerating to stop, 
and stopped or stalled. Decelerating or slowing down can be gradual with removal of power 
and coasting to a stop, or the deceleration can be controlled and finally a brake applied to hold 
the rotor position. The process of slowing the motor with a mechanical load attached has the 
effect of the load inertia pulling the rotor faster than the rotating magnetic field provides. This 
overhauling effect is known as negative torque. As the rotor spins past the magnetic field of the 
stator, the motor becomes a generator, or produces a regenerated voltage. This voltage is 
actually generated back into the stator as a reverse voltage from the applied voltage. This regen-
eration can be used to slow the motor, just as a generator would slow down as it does more 
electrical work. If the electrical energy is fed back to the controller, the voltage could cause 
damage to the DC converter section of the controller. This is the front end of the controller that 
converts AC to DC for use by the PWM inverter section. By installing a braking resistor across 
the converter DC bus, the excess energy can be dissipated by closing the circuit to the resis-
tor, in this case through an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), as shown in Figure 20–7.

Another system allows the regenerated power to be returned to the power source. This 
method uses an SCR rectifier bridge to rectify the AC supply for the DC bus. A separate SCR 
rectifier bridge is mounted in reverse to the first and is turned on when there is regeneration. 
The regenerated power is now returned directly to the power source (see Figure 20–8).

Servo Disc motor is a motor with a different design. The rotor is a nonconductive disc 
that has layers of copper “printed” on it, which leads to another name for the same motor: 
printed circuit motor. (See Figure 20–9.) The PMs that form the stator are mounted on either 
side of the disc rotor. The conductors on the rotor are brought out to one side of the disc, 
and external connections are made through small brushes that ride on the disc. Because the 
conductors are under a PM pole piece, the current in the rotor creates a magnetic flux that 
reacts with the pole piece to create torque. The number of pole pieces and the corresponding 
conductors multiplies this twisting torque. The turning effort is smooth at all speeds because 
there is no iron in the armature to create the cogging effect as seen in traditional PM motors. 
Also, because of the thin, not steel rotor, the Servo Disc motor has very fast acceleration. It can 
accelerate to 3000 RPM in about 60° of rotation, or 1/6 of one revolution. The same feature 
of the rotor allows it to stop and reverse very quickly as well. As with other DC motors, the 
current through the rotor controls the speed. The rotor resistance is, of course, a fixed value, 
so the voltage control to the armature is varied to control speed, and voltage is reversed to 
provide reverse direction.
As with the AC electronic controls, PWM is used to control both the voltage level and the 
frequency. The frequency is maintained near 20 kH of pulsating DC. By controlling the “on” 
time of the pulse, the voltage is varied, and therefore the speed is controlled. By controlling the 
direction of the DC polarity, the direction is controlled. See Figure 20–10 for a photo of a Servo 
Disc motor.

SELSYN MOTORS
The word selsyn is an abbreviation of the term self-synchronous. Selsyn units are special AC 
motors used primarily in applications requiring remote control. Small selsyn units transmit 
meter readings or values of various types of electrical and physical quantities to distant points. 
For example, the captain on the bridge of a ship may adjust the course and speed of the ship; at 
the same moment, the course and speed changes are transmitted to the engine room by selsyn 
units. On the engine telegraph system, mechanical positioning of a control transmits electrical 
angular information to a receiving unit. Similarly, readings of mechanical and electrical condi-
tions in other parts of the ship can be recorded on the bridge by selsyn units. These units are 
also referred to as synchros, and are known by various trade names.
STANDARD SELSYN SYSTEM
A selsyn system consists of two three-phase induction motors. The normally stationary rotors 
of these induction motors are interconnected so that a manual shift in the rotor position of one 
machine is accompanied by an electrical rotor shift in the other machine in the same direction 
and of the same angular displacement as the first unit.
Figure 20–11 shows a simple selsyn system for which the units at the transmitter and 
receiver are identical. The rotors of these units are two pole and must be excited from the same 
AC source. Three leads between the transmitter and the receiver units connect the three-phase

motor can be constructed with

stator windings to each other. The rotor of each machine is called the primary, and the three-
phase stator winding of each machine is called the secondary. A rotor for a typical selsyn unit is 
shown in Figure 20–12.
When the primary excitation circuit is closed, an AC voltage is impressed on the transmit-
ter and receiver primaries. If both rotors are in the same position with respect to their stators, no 
movement occurs. If the rotors are not in the same relative position, the freely movable receiver

rotor will turn to assume the same position as the transmitter rotor. If the transmitter rotor is 
turned, either manually or mechanically, the receiver rotor will follow at the same speed and in 
the same direction.
The self-synchronous alignment of the rotors is the result of voltages induced in the sec-
ondary windings. Both rotors induce voltages into the three windings of their stators. These 
voltages vary with the position of the rotors. If the two rotors are in the same relative position, 
the voltages induced in the transmitter and receiver secondaries are equal and opposite. In this 
condition, current does not exist in any part of the secondary circuit.
If the transmitter rotor is moved to another position, the induced voltages of the secondar-
ies are no longer equal and opposite, and currents are present in the windings. These currents 
establish a torque that tends to return the receiver rotor to a synchronous position. Because the 
receiver rotor is free to move, it makes the adjustment. Any movement of the transmitter rotor 
is accompanied immediately by an identical movement of the receiver rotor.
DIFFERENTIAL SELSYN SYSTEM
Figure 20–13 shows a diagram of the connections of a differential selsyn system consisting of a 
transmitter, a receiver, and a differential unit. This system produces an angular indication of the 
receiver. The indication is either the sum or difference of the angles existing at the transmitter and 
differential selsyns. If two selsyn generators, connected through a differential selsyn, are moved 
manually to different angles, the differential selsyn indicates the sum or difference of their angles.
A differential selsyn has a primary winding with three terminals. Otherwise, it closely 
resembles a standard selsyn unit. The three primary leads of the differential selsyn are brought 
out to collector rings. The unit has the appearance of a miniature wound-rotor, three-phase 
induction motor. The unit, however, normally operates as a single-phase transformer.
The voltage distribution in the primary winding of the differential selsyn is the same as 
that in the secondary winding of the selsyn exciter. If any one of the units is fixed in position 
and a second unit is displaced by a given angle, then the third unit (which is free to rotate) turns 
through the same angle. The direction of rotation can be reversed by interchanging any pair of 
leads on either the rotor or stator winding of the differential selsyn.
If any two of the selsyns are rotated simultaneously, the third selsyn turns through an angle 
equal to the algebraic sum of the movements of the two selsyns. The algebraic sign of this value 
depends on the rotation direction of the rotors of the two selsyns, as well as the phase rotation 
of their windings.
The excitation current of the differential selsyn is supplied through connections to one 
or both of the standard selsyns to which the differential selsyn is connected. In general, the 
excitation current is supplied to the primary winding only. In this case, the selsyn connected 
to the differential stator supplies this current and must be able to carry the extra load without 
overheating. A particular type of selsyn, known as an exciter selsyn, is used to supply the current. 
The exciter selsyn can function in the system either as a transmitter or a receiver.

ADVANTAGES OF SELSYN UNITS
Selsyn units are compact and rugged, and provide accurate and very reliable readings. Because 
of the comparatively high torque of the selsyn unit, the indicating pointer does not oscillate as it 
swings into position. Internal mechanical dampers are used in selsyn receivers to prevent oscillation 
during the synchronizing procedure and to reduce any tendency of the receiver to operate as a rotor. 
The operation of the receiver is smooth and continuous and is in agreement with the transmitter. In 
addition, the response of the receiver to changes in position at the transmitter is very rapid.
In the event of a power failure, the indicator of the receiver resets automatically with the 
transmitter when power is received. Calibration and time-consuming checks are unnecessary. 
A number of advantages are offered by selsyn systems:
• The indicators are small and compact and can be located where needed.
• The simple installation requires running a few wires and bolting the selsyn units in place.
• Selsyn units can be used to indicate either angular or linear movement.
• Selsyn units control the motion of a device at a distant point by controlling its actuating 
mechanism.
• One transmitter may be used to operate several receivers simultaneously at several 
 distant points.
SUMMARY
Stepper motors are used for incremental motion control. They produce motion in steps as a 
magnetic field moves as determined by a stepper controller. Servo motors also provide preci-
sion motion control and quick start and stop operation as needed in positioning controls. Two 
styles of servos are synchronous and asynchronous motors. Feed back as to position, speed 
and rotational direction can be acquired through different techniques. Braking and holding of 
motors is essential to positioning motors to move and hold loads as directed by the controller. 
The selsyn system is also referred to as a synchro system. The self-synchronous system allows 
one rotor to act as a transmitter and the other to act as a receiver to either directly follow the 
sender, or follow at a prescribed offset angle.

The electrician may consider a typical DC series motor or a DC shunt motor for opera-
tion on AC power supplies. It appears that such operation is possible because reversing the line 
terminals to a DC motor reverses the current and magnetic flux in both the field and armature 
circuits. As a result, the net torque of the motor operating from an AC source is in the same 
direction.
However, the operation of a DC shunt motor from an AC source is impractical because 
the high inductance of the shunt field causes the field current and the field flux to lag the line 
voltage by almost 90°. The resulting torque is very low.
A DC series motor also fails to operate satisfactorily from an AC source because of the 
excessive heat developed by eddy currents in the field poles. In addition, an excessive voltage 
drop occurs across the series field windings due to high reactance.
To reduce the eddy currents, the field poles can be laminated. To reduce the voltage loss 
across the field poles to a minimum, a small number of field turns can be used on a low reac-
tance core operated at low flux density. A motor with these revisions operates on either AC or 
DC and is known as a universal motor. Universal motors in small fractional horsepower sizes 
are used in household appliances and portable power tools.
Repulsion motors are divided into three distinct classifications: the repulsion motor; 
the repulsion-start, induction-run motor; and the repulsion-induction motor. Although these 
motors are similar in name, they differ in construction, operating characteristics, and industrial 
applications.
CONCENTRATED-FIELD UNIVERSAL MOTORS
A concentrated-field universal motor is usually a salient-pole motor with two poles and a wind-
ing of relatively few turns. The poles and winding are connected to give opposite magnetic 
polarity. A field yoke of this type of motor is shown in Figure 21–1.

THE ARMATURE
The armature of a typical universal motor resembles the armature of a typical DC motor except 
that a universal motor armature is slightly larger for the same horsepower output.
CONSTRUCTION FEATURES OF UNIVERSAL MOTORS
The frames of universal motors are made of aluminum, cast iron, or rolled steel. The field poles 
are generally bolted to the frame. Field cores consist of laminations pressed together and held 
by bolts. The armature core is also laminated and has a typical commutator and brushes. End 
plates resemble those of other motors except that in many universal motors, one end plate is 
cast as part of the frame. Both ball and sleeve bearings are used in universal motors.
SPEED CONTROL
Universal motors operate at approximately the same speed on DC or single-phase AC. Because 
these motors are series wound, they operate at excessive speed at a no-load condition. As a 
result, they are usually permanently connected by gears to the devices being driven. Universal 
motors are speed-regulated by inserting resistance in series with the motor. The resistance may 
be tapped resistors, rheostats, or tapped nichrome wire coils wound over a single field pole. In 
addition, speed may be controlled by varying the inductance through taps on one of the field 
poles. Gear boxes are also used.
DISTRIBUTED-FIELD UNIVERSAL MOTORS
The two types of distributed-field universal motors are the single-field compensated motor and 
the two-field compensated motor. The field windings of a two-pole, single-field compensated 
motor resemble the stator winding of a two-pole, split-phase AC motor. A two-field compen-
sated motor has a stator containing a main winding and a compensating winding spaced 90 
electrical degrees apart. The compensating winding reduces the reactance voltage developed in 
the armature by the alternating flux when the motor operates from an AC source. Figure 21–2 
is the schematic diagram of a compensated universal motor.

INDUCTIVE COMPENSATION
Armature reaction in AC series motors may also be compensated with an inductively 
coupled winding, which acts as a short-circuited secondary winding of a transformer. This 
winding is placed so that it links the cross-magnetizing flux of the armature, which acts 
Speed control of series motors can also be accomplished by using electronic speed con-
trols. The concept is the same as used in series voltage drops; that is, the voltage to the motor is 
reduced to give a reduced speed. This can be done by using SCRs or triacs to alter the voltage 
available to the motor.
DIRECTION OF ROTATION
The direction of rotation of any series-wound motor can be reversed by changing the direc-
tion of the current in either the field or the armature circuit. Universal motors are sensitive 
to brush position, and severe arcing at the brushes results from changing the direction of 
r otation without shifting the brushes to the neutral (sparkless) plane or adding a compensat-
ing winding.
CONDUCTIVE COMPENSATION
AC motors rated at more than 0.5 hp are used to drive loads requiring a high starting torque. 
Two methods are used to compensate for excessive armature reaction under load. In the con-
ductively compensated type of motor, an additional compensating winding is placed in slots cut 
directly into the pole faces. The strength of this field increases with an increase in load current 
and thus minimizes the distortion of the main field flux by the armature flux (called armature 
reaction, discussed in Unit 1). The compensating winding is connected in series with the series 
field winding and the armature, as shown in Figure 21–3. Although conductively compensated 
motors have a high starting torque, the speed regulation is poor. A wide range of speed control 
is possible with the use of resistor-type starter controllers.

as the primary winding of a transformer. Figure 21–3 shows the schematic diagram of an 
inductively compensated universal motor. Because the magnetomotive force of the sec-
ondary is nearly opposite in phase and equal in magnitude to the primary magnetomotive 
force, the compensating winding flux nearly neutralizes the armature cross flux. This type of 
motor cannot be used on DC. Because of its dependency on induction, the operating char-
acteristics of an inductively compensated motor are very similar to those of the conductively 
compensated motor.
REPULSION MOTOR
A repulsion motor basically consists of the following parts:
• Laminated stator core with one winding. This winding is similar to the main or running 
winding of a split-phase motor. The stator is usually wound with four, six, or eight poles.
• Rotor consisting of a slotted core into which a winding is placed. The rotor is similar in con-
struction to the armature of a DC motor. Thus, the rotor is called an armature. The coils 
that make up this armature winding are connected to a commutator. The commutator 
has segments or bars parallel to the armature shaft.
• Carbon brushes contacting with the commutator surface. The brushes are held in place by a 
brush-holder assembly mounted on one of the end shields. The brushes are connected 
by heavy copper jumpers. The brush-holder assembly may be moved so that the brushes 
can make contact with the commutator surface at different points to obtain the correct 
rotation and maximum torque output. Brush arrangement types include brush riding, 
where the brushes are in contact with the commutator surface at all times, and brush 
 lifting, in which the brushes lift at approximately 75% of the rotor speed.
• Two cast steel end shields. These shields house the motor bearings and are secured to the 
motor frame.
• Two bearings supporting the armature shaft. The bearings center the armature with respect 
to the stator core and windings. The bearings may be sleeve bearings or ball-bearing units.
• Cast steel frame. The stator core is pressed into this frame.
Operation of a Repulsion Motor
The connection of the stator winding in a repulsion motor to a single-phase line causes a field 
to be developed by the current in the stator windings. This stator field induces a voltage and a 
resultant current in the rotor windings. If the brushes are placed in the proper position on the 
commutator segments, the current in the armature windings sets up proper magnetic poles in 
the armature.
These armature field poles have a set relationship to the stator field poles. That is, the 
magnetic poles developed in the armature are offset from the field poles of the stator winding by

about 15 electrical degrees. Furthermore, because the instantaneous polarity of the rotor poles 
is the same as that of the adjacent stator poles, the repulsion torque created causes the rotation 
of the motor armature.
The three diagrams of Figure 21–4 show the importance of the brushes being in the proper 
position to develop maximum torque. In Figure 21–4(A), no torque is developed when the 
brushes are placed at right angles to the stator poles. This is because the equal induced voltages 
in the two halves of the armature winding oppose each other at the connection between the 
two sets of brushes. Because no current is in the windings, flux is not developed by the armature 
windings. This position is called soft neutral.
In Figure 21–4(B), the brushes are in a position directly under the center of the stator 
poles. A heavy current exists in the armature windings with the brushes in this position, but 
there is still no torque. The heavy current in the armature windings sets up poles in the arma-
ture. However, these poles are centered with the stator poles, and a torque is not created in 
either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. This position is called hard neutral.
In Figure 21–4(C), the brushes have shifted from the center of the stator poles 15 electri-
cal degrees in a counterclockwise direction. Thus, magnetic poles of like polarity are set up in 
the armature. These poles are 15 electrical degrees in a counterclockwise direction from the 
stator pole centers. A repulsion torque is created between the stator and the rotor field poles of 
like polarity. The torque causes the armature to rotate in a counterclockwise direction. A repul-
sion machine has a high starting torque with a small starting current, and a rapidly decreasing 
speed with an increasing load.
The direction of rotation of a repulsion motor is reversed if the brushes are shifted 
15 electrical degrees from the stator field pole centers in a clockwise direction, shown in 
Figure 21–5. As a result, magnetic poles of like polarity are set up in the armature. These 
poles are 15 electrical degrees in a clockwise direction from the stator pole centers. Repulsion 
motors are used principally for constant-torque applications, such as printing-press drives, 
fans, and blowers.
REPULSION-START, INDUCTION-RUN MOTOR
A second type of repulsion motor is the repulsion-start, induction-run motor. In this type of 
motor, the brushes contact the commutator at all times. The commutator of this motor is the 
more conventional axial form.
A repulsion-start, induction-run motor consists basically of the following parts:
• Laminated stator core. This core has one winding similar to the main or running winding 
of a split-phase motor.
• Rotor consisting of a slotted core into which a winding is placed. The coils that make up the 
winding are connected to a commutator. The rotor core and winding are similar to the 
armature of a DC motor. Thus, the rotor is called an armature.

• Centrifugal device.
 
a. In the brush-lifting type of motor, a centrifugal device lifts the brushes from the com-
mutator surface at 75% of the rated speed. This device consists of governor weights, 
a short-circuiting necklace, a spring barrel, spring, push rods, brush  holders, and 
brushes. Although high in initial cost, this device does save wear and tear on brushes, 
and runs quietly. Figure 21–6 is an exploded view of the armature, radial  commutator, 
and centrifugal device of the brush-lifting type of repulsion-start, induction-run motor.
 
b. The brush-riding type of motor also contains a centrifugal device that operates at 75% 
of the rated speed. This device consists of governor weights, a short- circuiting neck-
lace, and a spring barrel. The commutator segments are short-circuited by this device, 
but the brushes and brush holders are not lifted from the commutator  surface.
• Commutator. The brush-lifting type of motor has a radial type of commutator 
(Figure 21–6). The brush-riding type of motor has an axial commutator (Figure 21–7).

• Brush-holder assembly.
 
a. The brush-holder assembly for the brush-lifting type of motor is arranged so that 
the centrifugal device can lift the brush holders and brushes clear of the commutator 
surface.
 
b. The brush-holder assembly for the brush-riding type of motor is the same as that of a 
repulsion motor.
• End shields, bearings, and motor frame. The parts are the same as those of a repulsion 
motor.
Operation of the Centrifugal Mechanism
Refer to Figure 21–7 to identify the components of the centrifugal mechanism. The operation 
of this device consists of the following steps. As the push rods of the centrifugal device move 
forward, they push the spring barrel forward. This allows the short-circuiting necklace to make 
contact with the radial commutator bars; thus, all are short-circuited. At the same time, the 
brush holders and brushes are moved from the commutator surface. As a result, there is no 
unnecessary wear on the brushes and the commutator surface, and there are no objectionable 
noises caused by the brushes riding on the radial commutator surface.
The short-circuiting action of the governor mechanism and the commutator segments 
converts the armature to a form of squirrel-cage rotor, and the motor operates as a single-phase 
induction motor. In other words, the motor starts as a repulsion motor and runs as an induction 
motor.
In the brush-riding type of motor, an axial commutator is used. The centrifugal mecha-
nism (Figure 21–7) consists of a number of copper segments that are held in place by a spring. 
This device is placed next to the commutator. When the rotor reaches 75% of the rated speed, 
the centrifugal device short-circuits the commutator segments. The motor then continues to 
operate as an induction motor.
Operation of a Repulsion-Start, Induction-Run Motor
The starting torque is good for either the brush-lifting type or the brush-riding type of repul-
sion-start, induction-run motor. Furthermore, the speed performance of both types of motors 
is very good because they operate as single-phase induction motors.
Because of the excellent starting and running characteristics for both types of repulsion-
start, induction-run motors, they have been used for a variety of industrial applications, includ-
ing commercial refrigerators, compressors, and pumps.
The direction of rotation for a repulsion-start, induction-run motor is changed in the 
same manner as that for a repulsion motor, that is, by shifting the brushes past the stator pole 
center 15 electrical degrees. The symbol in Figure 21–8 represents both a repulsion-start, 
induction-run motor and a repulsion motor.

REPULSION-INDUCTION MOTOR
The operating characteristics of a repulsion-induction motor are similar to those of the repul-
sion-start, induction-run motor. However, the repulsion-induction motor has no centrifugal 
mechanism. It has the same type of armature and commutator as the repulsion motor, but it has 
a squirrel-cage winding beneath the slots of the armature.
Figure 21–10 shows a repulsion-induction motor armature with a squirrel-cage winding. 
One advantage of this type of motor is that it has no centrifugal device requiring maintenance. 
The repulsion-induction motor has a very good starting torque because it starts as a repulsion 
motor. At start-up, the repulsion winding predominates; however, as the motor speed increases, 
the squirrel-cage winding is used most. The transition from repulsion to induction operation 
is smooth because no switching device is used. In addition, the repulsion-induction motor 
has a fairly constant speed regulation from no load to full load because of the squirrel-cage 
Many repulsion-start, induction-run motors are designed to operate on 115 volts or 
230  volts. These dual-voltage motors contain two stator windings. For 115-volt operation, 
the stator windings are connected in parallel; for 230-volt operation, the stator windings are 
connected in series. The diagram in Figure 21–9 represents a dual-voltage, repulsion-start, 
induction-run motor. The connection table shows how the leads of the motor are connected 
for either 115-volt operation or 230-volt operation. These connections also can be used for 
dual-voltage repulsion motors.

SUMMARY
AC series motors are conduction motors, just like series DC motors. The construction is slight-
ly different because the magnetic field changes affect the inductance of the iron. The principle 
of operation is the same as that of the series DC motor. The armature keeps the same magnetic 
polarity of the rotor, reacting with the same magnetic field of the stator through the process of 
commutation.

Repulsion motors are available in three basic designs: (1) repulsion motors, 
(2)   repulsion-start, induction-run motors, and (3) repulsion-induction motors. These 
motors are easy to recognize because they are AC induction motors but use a commutator 
and brushes. The important point to remember is that the motors have neutral positions of 
the brush mountings that yield no motor movement. These neutral positions are referred to 
as hard or soft neutral. The brushes are shifted off soft neutral to give the motor the desired 
direction of rotation.

FIGURE 22–1 Power measurement for input to motor.

Standard motor efficiency is calculated by the simple formula of watts output of the motor 
divided by watts input. Watts output is calculated by determining the mechanical horsepower 
output and multiplying by 746 watts. Each output horsepower of mechanical energy is equal to 
746 watts of electrical energy. The input wattage is measured by an electrical wattmeter, either 
single phase or three phase, or it is calculated by making current and voltage measurements and 
power factor measurements (see Figure 22–1).
The following formulas provide the input watts to an AC motor.
For single-phase motors, use the formula:
Watts input = line volts × line current × % power factor
For three-phase motors, use the formula:
Watts input = line volts × line current × 1.73 × % power factor
Calculating the output power is sometimes difficult. Horsepower is a function of the 
motor torque, the speed of the shaft, and the amount of time the motor operates. This means 
that the motor can move a weight (measured in pounds) a distance (measured in feet) over time 
(measured in minutes). Originally, a single horsepower was calculated as the amount of effort 
required to move 33,000 pounds 1 ft in 1 minute. In other words 1 hp = 33,000 ft-lbs/min. 
To measure the output, the force on the shaft (ft-lbs) and the RPM (how far a weight at some 
distance from the center of the shaft would spin in one minute) must be measured. If the motor 
can be connected to a test device, called a dynamometer, the output horsepower can be directly 
measured. If the motor can be connected to a device called a prony brake, the torque can be 
calculated. The torque in foot-pounds is then used in the horsepower formula: hp = 2 × π × 
torque × RPM / 33,000. If the motor is connected to a driven load, horsepower measurement 
is not an easy task. Output power is often estimated using various techniques.

FIGURE 22–2 Tachometer.
© Cengage Learning 2014
Load estimation can help determine how much actual work the motor is doing, measured 
in horsepower. This is compared to the input watts to determine how efficient the motor is at 
converting electrical energy to mechanical energy. One method is to use power draw compari-
sons. If the nameplate efficiency is used as a guide to full-load efficiency, then a partial load can 
be determined by using the following formula:
output at partial load = measured input watts/full-load input watts
Full-load input watts are calculated by knowing the rated horsepower multiplied by 746, 
divided by the rated efficiency. This assumes that a partial load operates at nearly the same 
efficiency as a full load. This is not always the case, and other methods must be used to approxi-
mate the actual load on the motor.
Line current measurement can give another approximation of motor performance. The 
line current draw of the motor is roughly proportional to the actual load until the motor is under 
50% loaded; then, the ratio is no longer true. For example, if the actual motor current is 80% of 
the full-load value, the motor is producing roughly 80% of the rated horsepower output.
If you can measure the operating speed of a motor under load with a tachometer, as 
in Figure 22–2, then the slip method can be used. Use the RPM slip divided by the result of 
 synchronous RPM minus full-load RPM. Use this answer to multiply the nameplate hp to find 
the running hp.

● Example:   Measured RPM is 1770 at partial load. Full-load nameplate RPM is 1740, 
and the nameplate horsepower is 10 hp. Partial-load slip is 30 RPM 
(1800 – 1770).
30
(1800 - 1740) = 0.5
The motor is operating at 0.5 × 10 hp, or 5 hp output.
MOTOR LOSSES
Motor losses within the motor affect motor efficiency. In the conversion of energy from 
electrical to mechanical, some losses are to be expected. Motor losses are grouped into several 
categories.
Core losses in the motor are made up of losses in the iron core. These losses are due to 
eddy currents in the motor iron, and hysteresis losses in the magnetic circuit of the motor 
iron. To reduce hysteresis losses, high-grade steel with a higher silicon content is used to 
reduce the friction of the magnetic materials and therefore reduce the heat produced in 
changing the magnetic fields of the motor iron. To reduce the eddy currents, the laminations 
are sliced thinner and electrically insulated from one another. In addition, by lengthening 
the core, there is less flux density in the core material and reduced losses due to magnetic 
effects.
Friction and windage losses are the results of the motor bearings and the friction encoun-
tered by the spinning rotor. If the friction of the bearings can be reduced, the motor will have 
less opposition to the turning shaft and reduced losses within the motor. Windage is the result 
of the needed cooling of the motor windings. If other losses, including core and copper losses, 
can be reduced, there is less need for cooling and the fan size and air movement can be reduced, 
which again reduce losses within the motor.
Copper losses include stator losses that occur in the copper winding of the stator. They 
are referred to as I2R losses. If the wire size in the stator winding can be increased, then the R 
(resistance) is reduced and the losses are reduced. The wire size is increased by larger slots in 
the stator and reduced thickness of the wire insulation. Copper losses occur in the rotor winding 
as well. By reducing the resistance of the rotor, the same benefits of reducing the wattage losses 
in the stator are realized, and motor efficiency is increased.
Stray losses make up the remaining motor losses. Stray losses occur because the magnetic 
flux created in the stator is lost and never reacts with the rotor conductors to produce torque. 
By lengthening the core, stray losses are reduced. To accomplish all these reductions in losses, 
redesigns were needed. In most cases, more expensive materials and processes are used in

high-efficiency motors. The original purchase price of a high-efficiency motor is higher than 
the price of a comparable horsepower, standard-efficiency motor. The operating cost for elec-
tricity for a high-efficiency or a premium-efficiency motor can be less than that for a standard 
motor if the motors are properly selected to take advantage of the actual load conditions of the 
motor.
MOTOR EFFICIENCY DESIGNATIONS
Premium efficiency motors are designed to run at 94.1% efficiency at full load. A high-
efficiency motor is designed to run at 91.0% efficiency. If a motor is more efficient, it means 
that a higher percentage of the input power measured in electrical watts is converted to output 
mechanical horsepower, compared to a lower efficiency motor. All electric motors have losses 
as described previously. The motor manufacturers have worked to reduce these internal losses 
even more producing a “premium efficiency” motor. If you were to run a “premium efficiency” 
25 HP motor at full load for 24 hours per day and 7 days per week (8736 hours) at a total cost 
of $0.10 per kilowatt hour, you would pay:
• “Premium efficiency 94.1% eff” motor cost to operate: ( 25 hp  746 W

This represents a savings of approximately $590.00 per year.

Typically a premium efficiency motor runs at a cooler temperature, which extends motor 
life. The insulation temperature is a contributing factor to motor life. It is estimated that the 
insulation life doubles for every 10°C (50 °F) reduction in operating temperature. A cooler 
temperature also aids in bearing life. The cooler the motor runs usually means the longer the 
expected life.
Electric motors consume nearly 60% of the electric energy in the United States; therefore, 
the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) was created in 2007. The actual improve-
ments in energy efficiencies were actually realized in 2010 by the motor manufacturers.
Motor manufacturers list their premium efficiency motors under different names. 
Typically, the larger the motor hp, the higher the efficiency ratings. The highest efficiency 
ratings appear between 75% and 100% load. Power factor also typically improves with the hp 
rating of the motor and again tends to peak about 75% to 100% of full load.

Stator losses traditionally made up about 66% of the power losses in the I2R losses of the 
stator windings. To increase efficiency, more copper was added to the stator windings to reduce 
the R and therefore reduce the I2R losses. To reduce rotor losses, the slip was decreased to 
change the way the stator flux reacted with the rotor. This required increased conduction of the 
rotor bars. The following chart compares a standard efficiency motor to a premium efficiency 
motor and estimates the payback period for the higher priced premium motor. The compari-
sons are made at 75% of full load and use 7.5 cents per kWH for comparison purposes. The 
first chart compares replacing a functioning motor with a higher efficiency motor just to gain 
operating energy savings.

MOTOR ENERGY REQUIREMENTS
When selecting motors to drive loads, an awareness of the loading effects on the energy 
drawn by the motor is important. The effects on the motor input energy can be estimated by 
how the motor is used and at what speed it is driven. The physical laws that determine the oper-
ating characteristics and application are known as the affinity laws or the cube load laws. In short, 
the laws of energy consumption state that the energy required to drive fans or pumps (motors 
used for moving volumes of air or water) is proportional to the cube of the speed. For example, 
if the speed of a fan is reduced to 50% of the rated full-load speed, the fan slows to 50% of the 
RPM. This in turn reduces the air volume delivered to 50% of the full volume. The change is a 
linear proportion. The air pressure also changes as the square of the speed changes. For 50% of 
normal speed, the pressure drops to 0.52, or 25% of normal full-speed pressure. However, the 
energy consumption changes to 50% cubed, or 0.53, yielding only 12.5 % of the energy used.

Another example is that a reduction to 80% of the full-speed condition reduces the air 
volume to 80% and the pressure to 64% of the full pressure, but the energy used is reduced to 
0.80 cubed, or 51.2% of the input electrical energy (see Figure 22-3).
If the fan volume and pressure are sufficient to supply the needs of the facility, then oper-
ating below normal speed results in large savings for large fans and pumps. Variable frequency 
drives are ideal for tailoring the actual operating speed to facility needs. A typical application is 
an office that needs less volume and pressure for environmental air during off hours. A simple 
program to reduce speed may yield large energy and dollar savings.
Pumps work on the same physical laws when the speed of the pump, but not the speed of 
the impeller, is being changed. If the pressure and volume of a reduced-speed pump meets the 
demand of the mechanical system, then reduced speeds may be an effective energy reduction 
technique.
Many premium efficiency motors are also designed to be inverter duty rated. These 
motors are designed to run with variable frequency drives without affecting the life of the 
motor.
When using energy reduction techniques, such as variable frequency drives, it may be wise 
to use motors designed for use with inverter drives. Inverter-duty and vector-drive motors are 
designed for this purpose. Because PWM and vector drives are switching the power at high speed, 
there is a tendency for a standard motor’s magnet wire (motor winding) insulation to break down

because of spikes that occur and punch through the standard wire insulation. Some motor manu-
facturers produce a line of motors specifically designed with magnet wire resistant to transient 
spikes (see Figure 22-4). Often these motors need different cooling techniques that are standard 
for totally enclosed, fan-cooled (TEFC) motors. TEFC motors have external fins on the motor that 
radiate the heat to the motor surface. An external fan then blows ambient air over the fins to cool the 
motor. The fan is attached to the motor shaft and runs at the same speed as the motor shaft. If the 
motor uses a higher temperature–rated insulation on the windings, such as class H insulation, the 
motor can be totally enclosed, nonventilated (TENV) or totally enclosed, blower cooled (TEBC).
Along with changes in motor design to accommodate different or lower than normal 
speeds, motor wiring also deserves attention. The wires that carry the power from the PWM 
drive to the motor must be able to handle the normal power levels of the PWM pulses, as well as 
the standing waves that produce high voltages on the wire and the insulation. It has been deter-
mined that there may be corona breakdown of the insulation caused by these high voltages. 
Electrical noise has also been an observed problem for motors driven by variable frequency 
drives (VFDs). Cable manufacturers have developed products to counteract the effects of the 
problems associated with long lengths of leads from the VFD to the motor. Figure 22-5 shows 
examples of special inverter-driven motor leads.
Another change in the motor and drive industry is the integration of the motor and the 
drive in a single unit (see Figure 22-6). The drive has been specifically matched to the specific 
inverter-duty motor, which is a TEBC design. The internal leads from the drive to motor are 
designed for long life because of the reduction of corona and the reduction of reflected voltage 
wave. This integrated solution provides for perfectly matched components and easy, one-step, 
no-engineering installation.

SUMMARY
Energy-efficient motors are designed to operate with less slip than conventional motors 
and to better use the input wattage to create output wattage or horsepower. In design and manu-
facturing, these motors are made with higher grade silicon steel and thinner laminations of the 
core steel to reduce core losses. The magnet wire used in the windings is larger gauge to reduce 
copper losses. If less heat is produced (lost) within the motor, the fan can be smaller, and less 
windage loss is incurred. If the bearings are of better quality than standard duty, then less fric-
tion is developed, and reduced losses occur there. In all, every effort is made to reduce the watt-
age lost inside the motor in the conversion of electrical to mechanical energy. To estimate the 
losses and efficiency, the output load must be determined. Several methods are used to estimate 
the load, and a few methods used to actually measure the output load.
When reducing the energy requirements of a fluid drive system—air or liquid—the 
results of the cube load energy law are effective. This law relates the effect on the fluid system to 
the amount of input energy needed to drive the load. To reduce the speed of a drive system to 
conserve energy, a VFD is used. Other factors, such as adequate cooling of the motor at lower 
speed, must be considered. Standard motors and supply leads used with PWM drives often 
fail due to voltage reactions. Motors are available with inverter-duty windings that are used to 
counteract the effects of the electronic drives. Leads are available to counteract the effects of 
the electronic drives on the motor supply leads. All these solutions can be purchased as a single 
matched unit in an integrated drive and motor set.

The work of the modern electri-
cian requires a knowledge of National 
Electrical Code® requirements that govern 
three-phase motor installations and the 
ability to apply these requirements to 
installations. The elements of a motor 
circuit are shown in Figure 23–1.
This unit outlines the procedure 
for determining the wire size and the 
proper overload and starting protection 
for a typical three-phase motor instal-
lation. The motor installation example 
consists of a feeder circuit feeding three 
branch circuits. Each of the three branch 
circuits is connected to a three-phase 
motor of a specified horsepower rating. 
The feeder circuit and the branch circuits 
have the necessary overcurrent protection 
required by the NEC®.
THREE-PHASE MOTOR 
LOAD
The 
industrial 
motor 
installation 
described in this example is connected to 
a 230-volt, three-phase, three-wire service 
(Figure 23–2). The load of this system 
consists of the following branch circuits.
• One branch circuit that feeds a three-phase AC induction motor rated at 230 volts, 
28 amperes, 10 hp, with a code letter F marking.
• One branch circuit that feeds a three-phase AC induction motor rated at 230 volts, 
64 amperes, 25 hp, with a code letter B marking.
• One branch circuit that feeds a wound-rotor induction motor rated at 230 volts, 
54 amperes, and 20 hp. The full-load rotor current is 60 amperes.

Three specific facts must be determined for each of the three branch circuits constituting 
the load of the installation:
• The size of the conductors for each three-phase, three-wire branch circuit.
• The fuse size to be used for short-circuit protection. The fuses protect the wiring and 
the motor from any faults or short circuits in the wiring or motor windings.
• The size of the thermal overload units to be used for running protection. The overload 
units protect the motor from potential damage due to a continued overload on the 
motor.
Note: The full-load amperes shall be taken from the motor’s nameplate only for calculat-
ing thermal overload units. [See NEC® Article 430.6(A)(2).] Other calculations are based on 
Code-rated values from Articles 430.248, 430.249, and 430.250. Where motor system disconnect-
ing means and controllers are determined from horsepower, voltage rating, and design letter, 
then Table 430.251(B) is used.

Conductor Size
NEC® 430.22 states that branch-circuit conductors supplying a single motor shall have a carrying 
capacity equal to not less than 125% of the full-load current rating of a motor. This general rule 
may be modified according to 430.22(A–G).
The following procedure is used to determine the size of the conductors of the branch 
circuit feeding the 10 hp motor:
 
1. The 10 hp motor has a full-load current rating of 28 amperes. According to 
Table 430.250:
28 × 125% = 35 amperes
 
2. Using 35 amperes and referring to Table 310.15(B)(16), a proper size of conductor is 
selected. This process requires the electrician to determine the temperature ratings of 
each termination used and the ampere rating of the equipment circuit. According to 
NEC® Article 110.14(C), the temperature rating of the conductor used to determine 
the ampacity must not exceed the temperature rating of any of the connections. Unless 
all the terminations are marked for a higher temperature, the column in 310.15(B)(16) 
marked 60°C is selected to determine the conductor ampacity. Even if using a standard 
building wire type THHN, the conductor size is 8 AWG in the 60°C column.
 
 
 
If all the terminations in the branch circuit are rated for 75°C, then the second 
column in 310.15(B)(16) can be used for all wire ampacities. Article 110.14(C)(1)
(a)(4) states that motors with design letters B, C, or D may use the 75°C rating 
for terminations and wire ampacity. If all the other terminations in that circuit are 
rated at 75°C, then 10 AWG—75°C or 10 AWG—90°C wire may be used.
 
3. Table C1 in NEC Annex C indicates that three 8 AWG THHN conductors will fit 
in a trade size 1/2 EMT conduit (metric designator 16).

The squirrel-cage induction motor is to be connected directly across the rated line voltage 
through an ATL motor starter. For this example, the branch-circuit, short-circuit, and ground-
fault protection for this motor consists of three standard nontime-delay fuses enclosed in a 
safety switch located on the line side of the magnetic starter. According to 430.109(A) or as 
specified in 430.109(B–G) of the Code, this switch shall be a motor-circuit switch with a horse-
power rating, a circuit breaker, or a molded case switch, or shall be a listed device.
Motor Branch-Circuit, Short-Circuit, and Ground-Fault Protection
The branch-circuit, short-circuit, and ground-fault protection for a three-phase AC induction 
motor is provided in Table 430.52. For the branch circuit 1 motor being considered, the motor 
circuit overcurrent device shall not exceed 300% of the full-load current of the motor (nontime-
delay fuses). Article 430.52 with exceptions applies to Table 430.52.
The branch-circuit fuse protection for the branch circuit feeding the squirrel-cage motor 
is a squirrel cage—other than Design B energy efficient.
Because the 10 hp motor has a full-load current rating of 28 amperes, and given the appro-
priate value from Table 430.52 for a nontime-delay fuse, then
28 × 300% = 84 amperes / 90 amperes
NEC® Article 430.52 Exception 1 states that if the values for branch-circuit protective 
devices as determined using the percentages in Table 430.52 do not correspond to the standard 
device sizes or ratings, then the next larger size rating or setting should be used.
NEC® 240.6 indicates that the next larger, standard-size fuse above 84 amperes is 
90 amperes. Standard nontime-delay cartridge fuses rated at 90 amperes may be used as the 
branch-circuit protection for this motor circuit.
The branch-circuit, short-circuit, and ground-fault protection may also be calculated 
using a time-delay fuse. From Table 430.52, the second column is selected and 175% of 28 
amperes is calculated (1.75 × 28 = 49 amps). The next larger size is used. In this example, 
50-ampere fuses would be the choice. The Code allows the electrician to increase the size of the 
fuse according to the exceptions in 430.52(C)(1).
Disconnecting Means
According to the table for safety switches (Figure 23–3), the disconnecting means for this 
10 hp motor is a 15 hp, 100-ampere–rated safety switch in which the 90-ampere fuses are 
installed.
Because these safety switches are dual rated, it is permissible to install a 60-ampere safety 
switch with a maximum rating of 15 hp if the time-delay fuses are appropriate for the start-
ing characteristics of the motor. The size of the time-delay fuses installed in the safety switch 
depends on the degree of protection desired and the type of service required of the motor.

Time-delay fuses ranging in size from 35 amperes to 60 amperes may be installed in the safety 
switch. Refer to Article 430, Part IX, for requirements of motor and controller disconnecting 
means.
Running Overload Protection
Running overload protection consists of three current monitors, housed in the ATL motor 
starter. (See the Exception following NEC® Table 430.37 for an exception to this statement.)
NEC® 430.32(A)(1) states that the running overload protection (motor and branch-circuit 
overload protection) for a motor shall trip at not more than 125% of the full-load current 
(as shown on the nameplate) for motors with a marked temperature rise 40°C (104°) or less. In 
this example, the nameplate is the same as the code value, which is uncommon.
The trip current of the thermal units used as running overcurrent protection is
28 × 125% = 35 amperes
When the selected overload setting of the relay is not sufficient to start the motor or to 
carry the load, 430.32(C) permits the use of the next higher size or rating, but must trip at no 
more than 140% of the full-load motor current.

two ratings.”

Conductor Size
The following procedure is used to determine the size of the conductors of the branch circuit 
feeding the 25 hp motor:
 
1. The 25 hp motor has a full-load current rating of 68 amperes (see NEC®, Table 
430.250). (According to the Code, 430.22, 125% is needed for ampacity.)
68 × 125% = 85 amperes
 
2. Table 310.15(B)(16) indicates a 3 AWG Type TW or THHN copper conductor or 
a 3 Type THW conductor. (Assume 60°C terminations.)
 
3. Table C1 of Annex C shows that three 3 TW, THW, or THHN or THW conductors 
may be installed in a trade size 1-in. conduit.
Note: NEC® 300.4G requires that where conductors of 4 size or larger enter an enclosure, 
an insulating bushing or equivalent must be installed on the conduit.
Motor Branch-Circuit Protection
The 25 hp, squirrel-cage induction motor is to be started using an autotransformer. The 
branch-circuit overcurrent protection for this motor circuit consists of three nontime 
delay fuses located in a safety switch mounted on the line side of the starting compensator 
(autotransformer).
For a squirrel-cage induction motor that is not Design B, NEC® Table 430.52 requires that 
the branch-circuit overcurrent protection not exceed 300% of the full-load current of the motor. 
Because the 25 hp motor has a full-load current rating of 68 amperes (NEC Table 430.250), the 
branch-circuit overcurrent protection for the branch circuit feeding this motor is
68 × 300% = 204 amperes
NEC® 240.6 does not show 204 amperes as a standard size for a fuse. However, 
430.52  permits the use of a fuse of the next higher size if the calculated size is not a standard size. 
In this case, 200 amperes should be attempted. Therefore, three 200-ampere, nontime-delay

fuses can be used as the branch-circuit protection for this motor. Article 430.52, Exception 2, 
allows the fuse to be increased, but not over 400%.
Disconnecting Means
According to the table for safety switches in Figure 23–3, the disconnecting means for the 25 hp 
motor is a 25 hp, 200-ampere safety switch in which the 200-ampere fuses are installed.
Time-delay fuses may be installed in safety switches. In this example, 175% × 68 amperes = 
119 amperes. The next largest size is 125 fuses, and these may be used according to exceptions in 
430.52. The safety switch would be the same size.
Running Overcurrent Protection (Motor Overload Protection)
The running overcurrent protection consists of three magnetic overloads located in the start-
ing compensator. According to the nameplate, the motor has a full-load current rating of 
64 amperes. The current setting of the magnetic overload units is set to trip at
64 × 125% = 80 amperes (trip current)
BRANCH CIRCUIT 3
A third branch circuit feeds a wound-rotor induction motor. The nameplate data for this motor 
follow.
Conductor Size (Stator)
The following procedure is used to determine the size of the conductors of the branch circuit 
feeding the 20 hp motor.
 
1. The 20 hp motor has a full-load current rating of 54 amperes. According to the 
NEC® 430.22 and Table 430.250.
54 × 125% = 67.5 amperes

be installed in a trade size 1 in. conduit (metric designator 27).
Note: Article 300.4(G) requires that where conductors of 4 size or larger enter an enclo-
sure, an insulating bushing or equivalent must be installed on the conduit.
Motor Branch-Circuit Protection
The 20 hp, wound-rotor induction motor is to be started by means of an ATL magnetic motor 
switch. This motor starter applies the rated three-phase voltage to the stator winding. Speed 
control is provided by a controller used in the rotor or secondary circuit. All resistance of the 
controller is inserted in the rotor circuit when the motor is started. As a result, the inrush start-
ing current to the motor is less than if the motor were started at full voltage.
The branch-circuit, short-circuit protection of a wound-rotor induction motor is required 
by Table 430.52 of the Code not to exceed 150% of the full-load running current of the motor. 
This is for nontime-delay and time-delay fuses.
The full-load current equals 54 amperes for a 20 hp wound-rotor motor. The branch-
circuit overcurrent protection for the branch circuit feeding this motor is
54 × 150% = 81 amperes
NEC® 240.6 does not show 81 amperes as a standard fuse size. Article 430.52 allows the 
next larger size. A 90 ampere fuse should be chosen.
Disconnecting Means
According to the table for safety switches in Figure 23–3, the disconnecting means for the 20 hp 
motor is a standard 25 hp, 200-ampere safety switch. Reducers must be installed in this switch 
to accommodate the 90-ampere fuses required for the motor branch-circuit protection. Because 
of the dual rating of these safety switches, it is permissible to use a 100-ampere switch with a 
maximum rating of 30 hp. In this case, standard 90-ampere, nontime-delay fuses or 90-ampere, 
time-delay fuses may be installed.
Running Overcurrent Protection (Motor Overload Protection)
The running overcurrent protection consists of three thermal overload units located in the ATL 
magnetic motor starter (except as indicated in the note following Table 430.37). According to 
the nameplate, the motor has a full-load current rating of 54 amperes. The rated trip current of 
each thermal unit is
54 × 125% = 67.5 amperes

Conductor Size (Rotor)
The rotor winding of the 20 hp, wound-rotor induction motor is rated at 60 amperes. The fol-
lowing procedure is used to determine the size of the conductors for the secondary circuit from 
the rotor slip rings to the drum controller:
 
1. NEC® 430.23(A) requires that the conductors connecting the secondary of a wound-
rotor induction motor to its controller have a current-carrying capacity not less than 
125% of the full-load secondary current of the motor for continuous duty.
60 × 125% = 75 amperes
 
2. Table 310.15(B)(16) indicates that several types of copper conductors can be used: 
AWG 3 Type TW, Type THW, or Type THHN, assuming 60° terminations.
 
3. Table C1 of Annex C shows that A trade size 1 in. conduit is required for three 3 
THHN, TW or THW wires.
Note: Article 300.4(G) requires the use of insulating bushings or the equivalent on all 
conduits containing conductors of 4 size or larger entering enclosures.
If the resistors are mounted outside the speed controller, the current capacity of the conductors 
between the controller and the resistors shall be not less than the values given in Table 430.23(C).
For example, the manual speed controller used with the 20 hp, wound-rotor induction 
motor is to be used for heavy intermittent duty. NEC® 430.23(C) requires that the conduc-
tors connecting the resistors to the speed controller have an ampacity not less than indicated 
in Table 430.23(C). This is between 35% and 110%, based on the duty of the resistors. For 
example, if we use heavy intermittent duty, then 85% is used.
60 × 85% = 51 amperes
Table 310.15(B)(16) indicates that 51 amperes can be carried safely by AWG 6 wire. As a 
result, the temperatures generated at the resistor location are an important consideration.
NEC® 430.32(E) states that the secondary circuits of wound-rotor induction motors, 
including the conductors, controllers, and resistors, shall be considered as protected against 
overload by the motor running overcurrent protection in the primary or stator circuits, 
Therefore, no further overcurrent protection is necessary in the secondary rotor circuit.
MAIN FEEDER
When the conductors of a feeder supply two or more motors, the required wire size is deter-
mined using Code rules. Article 430, Part II, 430.24 states that the feeder shall have an ampacity 
of not less than 125 percent of the full-load current of the highest rated motor of the group plus 
the sum of the full-load current ratings of the remaining motors in the group. The full-load 
current of the motor is taken from the NEC®, Table 430.250.

The motor with the largest full-load running current is the 25 hp motor. This motor has 
a full-load current rating of 68 amperes. The main feeder size for the highest rated motor, in 
compliance with 430.24, is
68 × 125% = 85 amperes
Then 85 + 54 + 28 = 167 amperes
Table 310.15(B)(16) indicates that AWG 4/0 Type TW or Type THHN copper conduc-
tors can be used when using 60° terminations.
If all the terminations in the circuits are rated for 75°C, then the second column in Table 
310.15(B)(16) can be used for all wire ampacities. Article 110.14(C)(1) states that motors with 
design letters B, C, or D may use the 75°C rating for terminations and wire ampacity. Article 
110.14(C)(1)(b) states that circuits over 100 amperes or conductors larger than 1 AWG 
may use the 75°C rating. If all the other terminations in that circuit are rated at 75°C, then 
2/0 THWN or THHN wire can be used.
Table C1 of Annex C shows that three 4/0 TW conductors can be installed in trade size 2 
conduit. Three 4/0 THHN conductors can be installed in a trade size 2 conduit.
Annex C, Table C.1 lists that 3—2/0 THHN conductors can fit in a trade size 1-1/2 in.– 
(metric designator 41) EMT conduit. Many newly installed systems are rated for 75°C termina-
tions, so this will enable the electrical installation to use smaller size wire and pipe than would 
be allowed with 60°C terminations.
Main Feeder Short-Circuit Protection
Article 430, Part IV, 430.62(A), states that a feeder that supplies motors shall be provided with 
overcurrent protection. The feeder overcurrent protection shall not be greater than the largest 
current rating of the branch-circuit protective device for any motor of the group, based on Table 
430.52, plus the sum of the full-load currents of the other motors of the group.
The branch circuit for the 25 hp motor has the largest value of overcurrent protection. 
This value, as determined from Table 430.52, is a 119-ampere (68 × 1.75 or 125 ampere) fuse. 
The full-load current rating of the 20 hp motor is 54 amperes, and the full-load current rating 
of the 10 hp motor is 28 amperes. The size of the fuses to be installed in the main feeder circuit 
shall not be greater than the sum of 125 + 54 + 28 = 207 amperes.
Therefore, three 200-ampere, nontime-delay fuses are used for the feeder circuit. This 
procedure should be in conformance with Example D8, Annex D of the Code. Exceptions may 
be made if the fuses do not allow the motor to start or run.
Main Disconnecting Means
Article 430, Part IX, 430.109, lists several types of disconnecting means. The disconnecting 
means shall have a carrying capacity of at least 115% of the sum of the current ratings of the

motors. See 430.110 (C1 and 2). Therefore, the 200-ampere fuses required as the overcurrent 
protection for the main feeder are installed in a 200-ampere safety switch.
Wire types and sizes are selected by the ambient temperatures of the place of installation 
and the economics of the total installation, such as the minimum size of conduits, cost of the 
wire sizes, and labor cost for installing the various selections.
SUMMARY
Motor installation is one of the hardest calculations to perform and get all the components 
correct, in the proper location, and at the correct size. The NEC® guides you through the main 
components of the calculation, but you must know where to look and how to apply the proper 
codes. There are many facets to the correct installation, including feeder and feeder protection, 
branch-circuit and branch protection, conductor sizes and overcurrent protection, running 
overcurrent protection, and secondary circuit protection.

NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CODE® REGULATIONS
NEC® 430.32(D)(2) states that any motor of 1 hp or less that is not permanently installed, is 
manually started, and is within sight of the starter location shall be considered as protected 
against overload by the overcurrent device protecting the conductors of the branch circuit. 
This branch overcurrent device shall not be larger than that specified in Article 430, Part IV 
(Motor Branch Circuit, Short-Circuit and Ground-Fault Protection). An exception is that any 
such motor may be used at 120 volts or less on a branch circuit protected at not over 20 
amperes. A distance of more than 50 ft is considered to be out of sight from the starter loca-
tion. NEC®  430.32(B)   covers motors of 1 hp or less that are automatically started. NEC® 
430.32(B) (1) states that any motor of 1 hp or less that is started automatically shall have a 
separate overcurrent device that is responsive to the motor current. This overload unit shall be 
set to trip at not more than 125% of the nameplate full-load current rating for motors marked 
to have a temperature rise 40°C (104°F) or less, or with a service factor 1.15 or higher and not 
more than 115% for all other types of motors. Other options are to use motors with integral 
thermal protection or impedance-protected motors.
Single-phase motor installation must follow the National Electrical Code®. As you have 
seen throughout the book, there are many different types of motors and these can be installed 
in residential applications as well as non-dwelling units. Article 430 governs the installation of 
motors in all applications. The motors include AC single-phase motors as well as three-phase 
motors and DC motors. Single-phase AC motors are most common in residential applications 
and include most household applications such as garbage disposal motors, furnace blower 
motors and air-conditioning compressor motors.
Residential Single Phase AC Motors
To get a good view of the motor installation requirements, refer to Figure 430.1 in the NEC®. 
See Figure 24–1. For small residential uses, the motor circuits start at the branch circuit over-
current protective device (OCP). A branch circuit is generally defined as the circuit conductors 
that extend from the last circuit protective device for overcurrent, to the power utilization 
(outlet). Here we start with the motor and work back to the branch-circuit protection.
As the motor is installed, the nameplate information is needed. As noted in Article 430.7, 
all of the information is needed to properly install the motor in a safe and efficient matter. A few 
of the items are of particular importance. Item 13 in Article 430.7(A) indicates that some motors 
may have a thermal protector installed on the motor. If there is an internal (integral) protector, it 
shall be marked “thermally protected.” If such a motor is less than 100 watts and complies with 
420.32(B)(2) (if the protector is connected to a control circuit rather than the power circuit), 
they may be marked “TP” Item 14 states that a motor may be impedance protected—meaning 
that the internal impedance of the motor windings is high enough to protect the motor from 
overheating. If these motors are 100 watts or less and they comply with 430.32(B)(4), then they

may be marked “ZP.” As indicated in 430.32(B)(4), these motors have sufficient impedance to 
prevent overheating even if the motor does not start and stays connected to the branch circuit. 
Typical motors of this type are clock motors less than 1/20 hp. NEC® 430.32(D)(2)(a) states 
that for 1 hp or less, and not automatically started these “ZP” protected motors can be consid-
ered protected by the branch-circuit protection, and the Exception states that any such motor 
can be protected by a 120-volt branch circuit not over 20 amps. Therefore, most small clock 
motors need no further protection as long as they are not permanently installed. Other larger 
motors are protected as follows.

Garbage Disposal Motors
The branch-circuit protection also provides the motor branch circuit, short circuit, and ground-
fault protection” as required in the NEC® under Part IV of Article 430. The motor circuit con-
ductor as required in Part II of Article 430 is the wiring to the motor itself. This can include the 
cord connected with a plug to a receptacle under the sink (one method of installation). Other 
installations may have a permanent connection with flexible conduit. Motor controllers are 
covered in Part VI of Article 430. NEC® 430.81(A) describes small motors that are stationary 
and 1/8 hp or less, such as a clock motor, stating the branch-circuit overcurrent device can 
serve as the motor controller. Article 430.82 states that a controller must be capable of starting 
and stopping the motor. The motor controller for a garbage disposal motor installation is a 
switch, usually found on the backsplash, next to the sink. It is capable of starting and stopping 
the motor. Article 430.83 outlines the rating of the controller. NEC® 430.83(A) states that the 
controller must have a horsepower rating unless the motors fall under Part B, C, or D. Part C 
refers to the small stationary motors that are 2 hp or less and 300 volts or less. A general-use snap 
switch may be used as a controller if it has an ampere rating at least twice the full-load current 
rating of the motor. For AC motors, the general-use snap switch is rated only for AC, not AC/
DC snap switches, where the motor full-load rating is not more than 80% of the switch rating. 
The controller is not required to open all conductors to the motor but in this case would open 
the hot conductor. These single-phase motors usually have built-in integral overload protection 
in the form of a current sensor that has a resettable breaker. In case the food gets jammed in the 
mechanism, the motor is protected. The overload protection required by the NEC® to prevent 
overheating of the motor and its wiring is covered in Article 430, Part III. In the case of a garbage 
disposal motor, most are referred to in Article 430.32 either Part A for motors more than one 
horsepower or Part B for motors 1 hp or less. Either part refers to Section 2, which states that a 
thermal protector in the motor must protect it from dangerous overheating due to overloads or 
failure to start.
Furnace Motors
Small residential furnace installations fall under the same information as the garbage disposal 
motors as related to NEC® Article 430, Parts I, II, III, and IV. Forced air gas or oil burner furnace 
installations typically have one or more motors that provide combustion air and also a fan that 
circulates the warm air to the inhabited space. Electricians typically connect the branch-circuit 
power and the local disconnect (a switch) for the furnace power, and all the rest of the controls 
for the fan are internal to the furnace controls.
Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Equipment
Article 440 of the NEC® is pertinent to cooling systems. Article 440.2 states that equipment 
that has a running overcurrent protection device that allows a continuous current greater

than the normal full-load current, shall be marked with the higher current and referred to as 
the  branch-circuit selection current. This branch-circuit selection current is the current to be 
used in sizing branch-circuit conductors, disconnects, controllers, branch-circuit, short-circuit 
and ground-fault protection. This is also noted in 440.6(B). If the equipment does not have a 
nameplate, then the nameplate current on the hermetic refrigerant motor compressor shall be 
used for calculation as noted in 440.6(A). A disconnecting means is required outside next to a 
condenser unit that contains a fan and a compressor motor. The disconnect is rated according 
to Article 440.12—at least 115% of the appropriate current. Branch-circuit overcurrent protec-
tion is sized according to Part III of Article 440. Generally, a rating not exceeding 175% of the 
rated load current is used for protecting against short circuits and ground faults. Branch-circuit 
conductors are sized to 125% of the load current according to Part IV of Article 440. Motor 
controllers are sized according to Part V of Article 440. Generally, the controllers must be rated 
to carry the full-load current plus the locked rotor current of the motor. Motor compressor 
overload must follow Part VI of Article 440. Overload relays must trip at no more than 140% of 
rated current. A thermal protector integral with the motor is pre-rated to the motor. A fuse or 
inverse time circuit breaker is rated at 125% of full current as protection.
Other Single-phase Motor Installations
In other motor installations in residential or nonresidential applications, the NEC® is the guide 
to proper protection for the motor, to prevent overheating and causing a fire. This protection 
is covered in Article 430, Part III. The wiring to the motor is also protected according to Article 
430, Part IV, of the NEC® under the heading Motor Branch Circuit Short Circuit and Ground 
Fault Protection. In general, the requirements for protections are detailed in 430.52(A) and (B). 
The branch-circuit protection is based on NEC® Table 430.52 as a percentage of full-load cur-
rent. Remember that the full-load current referred to here is the Code book value as noted in 
430.6. The full-load current is listed in Table 430.248 for single-phase motors. If using a typical 
inverse time breaker, the percentage for single-phase motors is 250% of the Code book value 
for the size of the motor at the connected voltage. This high percentage is allowed so that the 
breaker does not trip every time the motor starts, because the motor draws many times the rated 
current as it starts. The high percentage is considered proper to protect the wiring from short 
circuit, and faults to ground in the branch circuit conductors.
DC Motors
DC motor installations also fall under Article 430 of the NEC®. As with all these motor installa-
tions, refer to Article 430.6 to determine which current value to use for the calculations needed. 
For DC motors, the values given in Table 430.247 are used for calculations except for the 
 separate motor overload (running overcurrent protection) calculations that do use the actual 
nameplate data to protect the specific motor installed. Most DC motor installations recently

installed have electronic controls in which much of the overload protection is part of the 
 solid-state control circuitry. As indicated in Article 430.22(A) for single DC motors supplied 
from a DC rectifier power source, the ampacity to the input of the solid-state controller must 
not be less than 125% of the rated input current of the controller. If the field control for the DC 
motor is fed by a half-wave rectifier, the field wiring must be at least 190% of the motor full-load 
current. If the field is supplied by a full wave rectifier configuration, the field wiring must be not 
less that 150% of the nameplate data.
Refer to Table 430.37 to determine where running protection is required for DC motors 
installed under various wiring system supplies, and how many overload units are required.
SUMMARY
Single-phase motors are often used in small motor needs for typically light loads, sometimes 
up to 10 hp. These installations are very common in small to moderate residential applica-
tions where single-phase power supplies are used. Where these motors are installed, the NEC® 
is followed to prevent dangerous overheating of motors and branch-circuit faults that could 
ignite fires. Figure 430.1 0f the NEC® details, where each item for protection is located within 
Article 430. Table 430.5 lists other articles that have specific requirements for motor installation 
with special equipment or special occupancies. DC motors are less commonly installed, but the 
provisions of Article 430 apply to these motor installations as well.

PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE
Most electrical equipment requires planned inspection and maintenance to keep it in 
proper working condition. Periodic inspections prevent serious damage to machinery by locat-
ing potential trouble areas. Observant personnel fully use their senses to diagnose and locate 
problems in electrical machinery: smell directs attention to burning insulation; touch detects 
excessive heating in windings or bearings; hearing detects excessive speed or vibration; and sight 
detects excessive sparking and many mechanical faults.
Sensory impressions usually must be supplemented by various testing procedures to 
localize the trouble. A thorough understanding of electrical principles and the efficient use of 
test equipment are important to the electrician in this phase of troubleshooting.
PERIODIC INSPECTIONS
The ideal motor maintenance program aims at preventing breakdowns rather than 
repairing them. Systematic and periodic inspections of motors are necessary to ensure optimal 
operating results. In a good preventive maintenance program with detailed checks, the person 
in charge should have a history on file for every motor in the plant. Entries should include 
inspection dates, descriptions of repairs, and the costs involved. When the record indicates 
that a motor has undergone excessive and/or costly repairs, the causes can be determined and 
corrected.
Inspection records also serve as a guide to indicate when motors should be replaced 
because of their high operational cost. They also reveal faulty operating conditions, such as 
misapplication or poor drive engineering.
Inspection and servicing should be systematic. However, the frequency of inspec-
tions and the degree of thoroughness may vary, as determined by the plant maintenance 
engineer. Such determinations are based on (1) the importance of the motor in the produc-
tion scheme (if the motor fails, will production be slowed seriously or stopped?), (2) the 
percentage of the day the motor operates, (3) the nature of the service, and (4) the motor’s 
environment. An inspection schedule therefore must be flexible and adapted to the needs 
of each plant. Equipment manufacturers’ specifications and procedures should be consulted 
and followed.
The following schedule, which covers both AC and DC motors, is based on average con-
ditions insofar as operational use and cleanliness are concerned. (Where dust and dirty condi-
tions are extremely severe, open motors may require a certain amount of cleaning every day.)

MEASUREMENT OF INSULATION RESISTANCE
The condition of electrical insulation is an important factor in the maintenance of motors 
and alternators. Moisture, dirt, chemical fumes, and iron particles all cause deterioration of the 
insulation used on the windings of stators and rotors. Motors operating under adverse condi-
tions require periodic tests to ensure continuous and satisfactory operation. Although severe 
conditions can be detected by touch, sight, or smell, often it is necessary to use more accurate 
measures of the condition of the insulation at any given time.
The value of insulation resistance in megohms (1,000,000 ohms) is used as an indication 
of insulation efficiency. Successive readings taken and recorded under the same test conditions 
document the insulation history of a unit and serve as an index of insulation deterioration. 
A megohmmeter, commonly called a Megger®, shown in Figure 25–1(A) and (B), is used to mea-
sure insulation resistance. In general, the instrument develops a voltage that is applied to the insu-
lation path. The amount of current in this path is shown on a sensitive microammeter calibrated 
in megohms. When the instrument leads are not connected, the microammeter reading should 
be infinity. Specific operating instructions are provided with the instrument by the manufacturer.
The megohmmeter ground lead is connected to the frame of the machine. The ungrounded 
lead is connected to any metallic part of the winding being tested, such as any terminal of the 
coil circuit. No other external paths must exist in parallel circuits. For this reason, the windings 
being tested should be isolated by disconnecting them from other parts of the circuit. The meg-
ohmmeter reading, then, is the resistance of the insulation between the number of coils in the 
circuit and the frame of the machine.
Major motor manufacturers apply insulation resistance for 660 volts for low-voltage 
motors below 600 volts. A method of determining the normal insulation resistance value is 
given in the following formula. This nonexact formula has been derived from experience. It 
is believed that the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, Inc. (IEEE) accepted this 
general theory from a manufacturer of megohmmeters.
Caution: Disconnect electronic devices attached to units under test.

This method is usually stated as 1 megohm per 1000 volts plus 1 megohm for a 60-second 
test at 40 °C (104 °F).
A very low value of insulation resistance indicates defective insulation. The electrician 
should begin an immediate check to localize the defective insulation. This is done by discon-
necting various coils from a series, parallel, wye, or delta combination, and repeating the insula-
tion resistance test on each isolated coil. A very low value of resistance may indicate a grounded 
coil (complete breakdown of insulation at some point).
A value of insulation resistance slightly below the recommended approximate value does 
not necessarily indicate that immediate repair is required. The electrician should take a series of 
readings at weekly intervals to detect any progressive decrease or sudden drop in the insulation 
resistance. If the resistance continues to decrease, then the fault is to be located without delay. 
A slightly low but constant value of resistance should not cause concern.
Note: If a motor has been reading 10 megohms on periodic tests and suddenly drops to 
0.2 megohms the motor may be unsafe to start. New motors read around infinity (the highest 
resistance on the meter scale), or slightly lower, but during use, this resistance lowers to a more 
steady reading.

TESTING FOR SHORT-CIRCUITED COILS
Open-circuited coils on rotors or stators can be located by continuity (one end to the 
other) tests. Short-circuited coils are located easily by the use of a growler. A growler is an instru-
ment consisting of an electromagnetic yoke and winding excited from an AC source. The yoke 
is placed across a section of slots containing the winding being tested. The yoke winding acts 
as the primary winding of a transformer, and the winding being tested acts as the secondary 
(Figure 25–2).
If a turn or coil is short-circuited, the resulting current rise in the primary (yoke) circuit 
is indicated on the ammeter. If the current is permitted to exist for a short period of time, the 
defective turn or coil can be identified by the heat developed at the defective point. The stator 
windings of both alternators and motors can be tested by this method.
The field coils of alternators can be tested using the voltage-drop method described for 
DC machinery testing. With a given value of current in the field circuit, the voltage drops on 
individual field coils should be approximately equal. If a voltage-drop difference is in excess of 
5 %, the coil should be investigated for shorted turns. The presence of full line voltage across a 
single coil indicates an open circuit in that coil.
The field coils of alternators can be checked for impedance by applying a high-frequency 
low voltage to each coil and measuring the current. The currents in the coils should be equal. 
The presence of a high current usually means that there are shorted turns somewhere in 
the coil.
BALANCE TEST
The current in the individual phases of three-phase motors must be equal. Figure 25–3 
shows the connections necessary to make a simple balance test that measures the phase currents 
under load. This test may be made in the electric shop before a motor is installed.
The fused three-pole switch at the left of the diagram is used to start the motor. The sec-
ond three-pole switch removes the ammeter from the circuit during the starting period when 
the current input is very high. This switch is closed before the motor is started. When the motor 
reaches its rated speed, the ammeter switch is opened. The current in each phase, therefore, is 
indicated on the ammeter. For a motor operating normally, the three line currents are equal. A 
high reading in one phase may indicate shorted turns. If one phase shows no current, then the 
motor is operating as a single-phase motor. High but equal current readings in all three phases 
indicate an overloaded motor.
Figure 25–4 shows the use of a more convenient method of making a balance test. A 
clamp-on ammeter is used to take readings in each phase of a motor in actual operation under 
normal load.

MEASUREMENT OF SPEED VARIATIONS
Deviations from the rated speed of a motor under load are an indication of improper 
mechanical loading or faulty conditions within the motor. A tachometer (Figures 25–5 and 
25–6) is an instrument used to check the speed of a motor. Other types of instruments are 
also used. The tachometer in Figure 25–6 is held by hand to the end of the motor shaft to 
measure shaft speed.

SQUIRREL-CAGE ROTORS
The bars of a squirrel-cage rotor can be broken if the motor is subjected to severe jarring, 
vibration, or overheating. Bars that are dislodged must be put back in place securely so that 
movement is impossible. The presence of broken bars can be detected by the use of a growler. 
(The rotor must be removed to make this test.)
A test can be performed that does not require the removal of the rotor to detect broken 
or open rotor bars. This test consists of exciting one phase of the stator winding with 25% of 
its normal voltage. Enough voltage is used to give a suitable indication on an ammeter in series 
with the winding. By turning the rotor slowly by hand, any variations in stator current can be 
observed on the ammeter. Any current variation in excess of 3% usually indicates open bars in 
the rotor (Figure 25–7).
BEARINGS
The type of bearings used in a motor depends on the cost of the motor and the character-
istics of the load. Sleeve and ball bearings are used in both AC and DC motors. Excessive wear 
on the bearings reduces the concentricity of the stator and rotor sections. In small motors, with 
the power off, excessive wear can be detected by manually attempting to move the shaft of the 
rotating member in a lateral direction. The amount of play in the shaft is an indication of bearing

wear. For large motors, bearing wear and the resulting deviation in concentricity of the stator 
and rotor can be detected by measuring the air gaps over several points around the periphery 
of the rotor. Severe bearing wear on both large and small motors may result in actual contact 
between the rotor and the stator.
The motor must be disassembled to repair bearings. This type of repair requires special 
tools, and the job should not be attempted without them.
A sleeve bearing is removed by dismantling the baffles inside the end shield, removing the 
oil well cover plates, and removing the oil ring clips. The bearing lining is then tapped out using 
a short length of pipe stock or a special split fitting that locks inside the oil ring slot.

Ball Bearings
Ball bearings are pressed fit to the motor shaft and usually should be removed from the 
shaft only when it is necessary to replace the bearing. To inspect the ball bearings, the end bells 
are removed and the rotor, the rotor shaft, and the bearing assembly are taken from the stator. In 
some motors, the bearing housings have removable bearing caps so that it is possible to remove 
the bearing without removing the end bells.
If a ball bearing must be replaced, a bearing puller is normally used to prevent damage to 
the shaft (see Figure 25–8). The electrician must be very careful when placing a new bearing on 
the shaft so that neither the bearing nor the shaft is damaged (Figure 25–9). A ball bearing race

must be placed on the shaft so that the race is exactly square with the shaft. The shaft must be in 
perfect condition because even the slightest burr will cause trouble. Pressure must not be applied 
to the outer race of the bearing. Pressure applied to install the bearing must be applied evenly on 
the diameter of the inner race (Figure 25–10). Light tapping is recommended. A piece of pipe 
stock slightly greater than the shaft diameter is used to press on the new bearing. The bearing 
can be warmed to a temperature of 150 °F (66 °F) to simplify the process.

New ball bearings must not be cleaned prior to installation. Dust or dirt must not enter 
the bearing during the installation.
LUBRICATION
Several methods of lubricating motors are used. Small motors with sleeve bearings have 
oil holes with spring covers. These motors should be oiled periodically with a good grade of 
mineral oil. Oil with a viscosity of 200 seconds Saybolt (approximately SAE 10) is recom-
mended.
The bearings of larger motors are often provided with an oil ring that fits loosely in a slot 
in the bearing. The oil ring picks up oil from a reservoir located directly under the ring. Under 
normal operating conditions, the oil should be replaced in the motor at least once a year. More 
frequent oil replacement may be necessary in motors operating under adverse conditions. In 
all cases, avoid excessive oiling; insufficient oil can ruin a bearing, but excessive oil can cause 
deterioration of the insulation of a winding.
Many motors are lubricated with grease. Periodic replacement of the grease is recom-
mended. In general, the grease should be replaced whenever a general overhaul is indicated, or 
sooner if the motor is operated under severe operating conditions.
Grease can be removed by using a light mineral oil heated to 165 °F (74 °F) or a solvent. 
Any grease-removing solvents should be used in a well-ventilated work area.
Ball-Bearing Lubrication
The following table indicates recommended intervals for regreasing of ball-bearing units. 
It is important that the correct amount and type of grease be used in ball bearings. Too much 
grease can cause overheating.

Fractional horsepower motors often contain sealed bearings. With normal service, these 
bearings do not require regreasing. When regreasing is required for unshielded bearings, the 
manufacturer’s specifications and directions must be followed.
Some motors with ball bearings are provided with pressure fittings, and a grease gun is 
used to lubricate the bearings. Remove the bottom plug when doing this. Because of the wide

variation in the design of industrial motors, the electrician should consult the comprehensive 
lubrication manuals published by electrical machinery manufacturers to ensure the proper 
lubrication of all types of motors.
BALL AND ROLLER BEARING MAINTENANCE
Cleaning Out Old Grease
It is best to remove the bearing, if possible. However, when cleaning a bearing in place, 
remove as much of the old grease as possible, using a rag or brush free from dirt or dust. Flush 
out the housing with clean, hot kerosene (110 °F to 125 °F [43 °C to 52 °C]); clean, new oil; or 
solvent.
After the grease has been removed, flush out the bearing with light mineral oil to prevent 
rust and to remove all traces of cleaning fluid. Allow to drain thoroughly before adding new 
grease. When the bearing is removed from the case, wash out the hardened, rancid grease from 
the housing and bearing as follows:
 
1. Put on safety glasses or a face shield for protection.
 
2. Soak the bearing in hot kerosene, then remove it.
 
3. Rotate the bearing slowly using an air hose. (Fast rotation may score the balls with-
out lubrication.)
 
4. Dip the bearing in clean kerosene, light oil, or solvent.
 
5. Rotate the bearing slowly again using an air hose.
 
6. Wash the bearing again with clean kerosene or solvent.
 
7. Rotate the bearing in hand, and check for smoothness.
 
8. If the bearing is smooth, repack it with grease.
 
9. If the bearing is not smooth, but is in good condition, there is still some hardened 
grease in it. Repeat operations 6 and 7.
Lubricating Bearings with Pressure Relief Plug
 
1. Wipe fitting and plug clean.
 
2. Remove relief plug at bottom of bearing (Figure 25–11).
 
3. With shaft in motion (if possible), force grease into the top grease fitting, catching 
old grease in a pan. Add grease until new grease appears at the pan.
 
4. With a screwdriver, open the relief hole. Do not push the screwdriver into the 
gearing housing.

5. Allow bearing to run with relief plug out to remove pressure.
 
6. After the grease stops running out, and there is no longer any pressure in the bear-
ing, replace the relief plug.
Lubricating Bearings without Relief Plug
 
1. Install a grease fitting with safety vents.
 
2. With the motor running, pump in grease slowly until a slight bleed shows around 
the seal or safety vent.
 
3. If it is necessary to lubricate while bearing is standing, fill the bearing with grease 
from one-fourth to one-half of its capacity.
Note: Be sure not to overgrease and to keep the grease clean.
Relubrication with Oil
Oil is always subject to gradual deterioration from use and contamination from dirt and 
moisture. Because of this, regular intervals for cleaning bearings must be maintained.
 
1. After draining the used oil, flush out the bearing. This can be done by using a 
new charge of the lubricant used for regular lubrication. Run the machine for 
3 to 5 minutes, and drain again. Units used where there is sawdust or dirty 
conditions may require two flushings.

2. Fill with new oil to the proper level. Be sure new oil is from a clean container, and 
that no dirt is pushed into the filler plug while filling. Lubricant must be kept clean.
 
3. Check the seals to see that they are effective to prevent leakage or the entry of 
outside dirt to the bearing. It is important to keep the lubricant clean and the bear-
ing flushed out so that it will be clean. Always read and follow the manufacturer’s 
instructions whenever possible.
OILS FOR GEAR MOTORS
A gear motor is a self-contained drive made up of a ball-bearing motor and a speed-reduc-
ing gear box. It is designed to take advantage of the electrical efficiency of the high-speed motor 
and the transmission efficiency of gears.
The front motor bearings are generally grease lubricated and require the same attention as stan-
dard ball-bearing motors. The rear bearings, gear box bearings, and the gears themselves are almost 
always splash lubricated from the same oil supply reservoir in the lower section of the gear unit.
Oil seals at each bearing prevent oil leakage into the motor windings and out along the 
drive shaft. The precision-cut gears require carefully selected lubricating oils. Use only top-
grade oils of the viscosity called for by the manufacturer of the gear motor.
SUMMARY
Proper motor maintenance extends the life of the motor. Preventive maintenance helps 
you spot potential problems and correct them before the motor breaks down and causes delays 
in production or failures at critical times. If a motor does fail, it may be possible to repair minor 
problems in the maintenance shop and to recondition the motor for use as a spare. Follow man-
ufacturers’ directions when lubricating the motor bearings to keep the motor running smoothly 
without excessive current draw or excessive heat. Check for proper ventilation, proper voltage, 
and proper current when performing maintenance checks on the motor.
