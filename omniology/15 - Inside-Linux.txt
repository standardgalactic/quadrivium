Inside Linux 
 
 
Kernel  
 
o 
The core of the UNIX system. Loaded at system start up (boot). Memory-resident control 
program.  
o 
Manages the entire resources of the system, presenting them to you and every other user 
as a coherent system. Provides service to user applications such as device management, 
process scheduling, etc.  
o 
Example functions performed by the kernel are:  
 
Managing the machine's memory and allocating it to each process.  
 
Scheduling the work done by the CPU so that the work of each user is carried out 
as efficiently as is possible.  
 
Accomplishing the transfer of data from one part of the machine to another  
 
Interpreting and executing instructions from the shell  
 
Enforcing file access permissions  
 
o 
You do not need to know anything about the kernel in order to use a UNIX system. These 
details are provided for your information only.  
 
 
 
 
Shell  
 
o 
Whenever you login to a Unix system you are placed in a shell program. The shell's 
prompt is usually visible at the cursor's position on your screen. To get your work done, 
you enter commands at this prompt.  
o 
The shell is a command interpreter; it takes each command and passes it to the operating 
system kernel to be acted upon. It then displays the results of this operation on your 
screen.  
o 
Several shells are usually available on any UNIX system, each with its own strengths and 
weaknesses.  
o 
Different users may use different shells. Initially, your system adminstrator will supply a 
default shell, which can be overridden or changed. The most commonly available shells 
are:  
 
Bourne shell (sh)  
 
C shell (csh)  
 
Korn shell (ksh)  
 
TC Shell (tcsh)  
 
Bourne Again Shell (bash)  

o 
Each shell also includes its own programming language. Command files, called "shell 
scripts" are used to accomplish a series of tasks.  
 
 
 
 
Utilities  
 
o 
UNIX provides several hundred utility programs, often referred to as commands.  
o 
Accomplish universal functions  
 
editing  
 
file maintenance  
 
printing  
 
sorting  
 
programming support  
 
online info etc.  
o 
Modular: single functions can be grouped to perform more complex tasks
