Preface
Electronics engineers with a knowledge of microwave technology 
have always been in demand by industry, and this is likely to 
continue. In addition to electronics engineers, physicists, chemists, 
and even mathematicians often need knowledge and “know-how” 
of practical microwave electron devices and their applications. In 
many cases, such knowledge must be acquired quickly by indepen­
dent study. Therefore, there is a need for a practical, self-teaching 
book with immediacy and utility to provide such people with 
information on microwaves at a sufficient level and depth.
To the author’s knowledge, such a book has not been available 
in the past. Most books have been either highly theoretical at the 
post-graduate level or overly simplified technician-level works. 
Highly sophisticated books are certainly needed in microwave 
electronics, but they are not practical in meeting the requirements 
of immediacy and utility. Books that are too practical may pro­
vide basic explanations of the materials but do not give the reader 
the creative design capability which is one of the essential qualifi­
cations of a good engineer.
This book has been written so that practicing engineers, 
scientists, and technicians may acquire practical know-how of 
microwave electron devices and their applications at an adequate 
level through self-study. This book is also suitable for use as a 
college textbook in upper-division courses for seniors and first-year 
graduate students in electrical engineering.
All areas of microwave electron devices are covered in this 
book. In the area of microwave solid-state devices, popular micro­
wave transistors and both passive and active diodes are covered. 
Other areas presented include quantum electron devices, 
thermionic devices (including relativistic thermionic devices), and 
ferrimagnetic electron devices. The design of each of these devices

is covered as well as their applications, including oscillation, 
amplification, switching, modulation, demodulation, and paramet­
ric interactions. Numerous design examples and case studies are 
presented throughout the book.
One of the best ways to learn how to design is by looking at 
current designs and investigating case studies. When each micro­
wave electron device is covered, typical design examples or case 
studies are presented first and followed by qualitative or quantita­
tive explanations. The fundamental theory of each device is sum­
marized along with the underlying principles of the design. Each 
summary is presented so that the design techniques can be applied 
to other specific cases, designs, and applications. Review questions 
are included with each chapter to stimulate creative thinking and 
enhance the acquisition of knowledge and design skills.
The author thanks Sabine Teich, Dolores Marrari, and M. 
Michael Ishii for their assistance in manuscript preparation. The 
author also thanks George Zdasiuk, Christine Oshanick, and

Introduction
1.1 Microwaves and Electronics
Microwaves are electromagnetic waves with free space wave­
lengths in a range of 0.1 mm to 100 cm [1,16,17], Ranging in 
frequency from 300 MHz to 3 THz, microwaves are employed in 
microwave telecommunications, radar navigational aides, indus­
trial and domestic heating and material processing, telemetering, 
and sensing. In addition, they provide a vehicle for scientific and 
biological studies. Microwave electronics techniques provide gen­
eration, modulation, control, amplification, demodulation, and 
multiplexing of microwaves. It is essential to study the practical 
aspects of microwave electronics to acquire knowledge of such 
techniques. Before getting into their details, some microwave 
electron devices involved in this book are briefly and qualitatively 
reviewed in this chapter to obtain some idea of typical microwave 
electron devices and their applications.
1.2 Generation of Microwave Power
Microwaves are generated either by solid-state devices (Chapters 
2-10, 12) or thermionic devices (Chapters 14-16), depending on

the frequency and power level of microwaves required. Today, 
high frequency and high power, especially in ranges of super high 
power levels, are difficult to generate with microwave solid-state 
devices. In such high power and high frequency applications, 
thermionic devices are employed. Microwave solid-state devices 
include microwave transistors, tunnel diodes, Gunn diodes, and 
IMPATT diodes. Microwave thermionic devices include klystrons, 
magnetrons, backward wave tubes, and gyrotrons.
An example of a microwave transistor is shown in Fig. 1.1 [9, 
18], This transistor is designed to operate at 6 GHz, with the 
output of 10 mW. The specification is listed in Table 1.1. The 
transistor is designed to be mounted on a microstripline resonator. 
Though the appearance is quite different from one of its low 
frequency counterparts, it operates on the same basic principle of 
the metal-semiconductor field effect transistor (MESFET; Chap­
ter 2) [2], When a de power supply of 5 V is applied, the 
mechanism of positive feedback, together with voltage amplifica­
tion produced by the transistor action, causes the transistor to 
oscillate. Thus, microwaves are generated by the transistor. In the 
package shown in Fig. 1.1, the slant cut lead strip is the gate. The 
lead strip directly against the gate is the drain. The two crossing 
lead strips are the source. If this is a bipolar junction transistor 
(BJT), the slant cut lead strip is the base. Directly against it is the 
collector and the crossing lead strips are the emitter. The dot seen 
in Fig. 1.1 on the transistor package signifies either the drain or

or BJT.
An example of a microwave tunnel diode is shown in Fig. 1.2, 
and its specifications are listed in Table 1.2. The tunnel diode is a 
heavily doped degenerate p-n junction diode [3], When forward 
biased properly it produces a negative resistance due to the tunnel 
effect (Chapter 3). On the one hand, positive resistance consumes 
microwave power. The negative resistance, on the other hand, 
“negatively consumes,” or increases, microwave power when a

resonator and the impedance of the attached circuit are properly 
matched with the negative resistance. Thus, with the proper res­
onator and circuit attached, and the power supply adjusted to 
supply a proper bias, the tunnel diode generates microwaves.
A photograph of a Gunn diode and its waveguide mount is 
shown in Fig. 1.3, and the specifications for this diode are listed in 
Table 1.3. A Gunn diode is basically a properly doped n-type 
GaAs semiconductor [4,20,21], When this is biased properly, there 
will be bunched electrons in the semiconductor due to the momen­
tum difference of electrons in a nonuniform electric field distribu­
tion. The bunched electrons, drifting through the bulk semicon­
ductor, produce a pulse current in the connected circuit when it is 
discharged at the anode. The process repeats at microwave fre­
quencies. Thus, microwaves are generated when a proper amount 
of de bias is applied to a Gunn diode (Chapter 4).

The bunched carriers can also be formed by the avalanche 
effect. Charge carriers are injected into a drift region of a reverse 
biased p-n junction diode and the diode is biased at the verge of 
avalanche breakdown. When a resonator is connected in series 
with the diode, the avalanche breakdown occurs at every positive 
half cycle to inject bunched carriers into the drift region. When 
the resonator and the bias voltage are adjusted properly, the 
reverse biased p-n junction diode produces microwave power. 
Such a diode is called an impact avalanche transit time (IMPATT) 
diode (Chapters 5 and 6) [20,21]. A photograph of a typical 
IMPATT diode and the waveguide mount is shown in Fig. 1.4 and 
its specifications are given in Table 1.4. As seen from a compari­
son of Tables 1.4 and 1.3, IMPATT diodes produce more power 
than Gunn diodes. Tunnel diodes have a lower power capacity, 
but they have the advantage of a low operating power supply 
voltage and are usually low in noise.

The active region of microwave solid-state devices is small, as 
narrow as the cross section of a human hair and as thin as onion 
skin. Due to its size, if high power operations are desired, prob­
lems with heat dissipation occur. Therefore, microwave solid-state 
devices have some limitations for high power operations at high 
frequencies.
Microwave generation can be achieved using these discrete 
solid-state devices. But these devices can be monolithically inte­
grated with associated microstrip circuitry in the form of a hybrid 
microwave integrated circuit (HMIC) or a monolithic microwave 
integrated circuit (MMIC) [29-31], These MMICs are often pack­
aged in a fashion similar to that seen in Fig. 1.1 or housed in a 
standard TO-type transistor housing.
Thermionic devices, on the other hand, have no such high 
power restrictions. For example, a domestic microwave oven uses 
a magnetron to produce microwave power. A photograph of a 
cooking magnetron is shown in Fig. 1.5, and its specifications are 
tabulated in Table 1.5. It will be a long time before the magnetron 
is replaced by a solid-state device at a reasonable cost.
Electrically, a magnetron is a vacuum diode [1,19]. It consists 
of a hot cathode and an anode with a number of cavity resonators. 
When an axial magnetic field is applied, electrons rotate around 
the cathode by the Lorentz magnetodynamic force. By velocity 
modulation due to cavity resonators around the anode, the rotat­
ing electrons are bunched and form electron poles. The rotating 
electron poles induce a microwave field in the cavities which are 
directly attached to the anode by electrostatic induction. Thus, 
microwaves are generated in the anode, and one of the anode 
cavities is coupled to a waveguide for the external use of generated 
microwave power (Chapter 12).
The output of most electron devices can be controlled by 
modulating the power supply voltage. When the power supply 
voltage is modulated, the modulation occurs in both the frequency 
and the oscillator output power. To obtain pure FM or pure AM 
from these electron devices, a separate modulator in the micro-

wave circuit or transmission line is needed rather than direct 
modulation to the power supply for the electron devices.
1.3 Amplification of Microwaves
In microwave telecommunications, microwave amplification is im­
portant to increase the sensitivity of a microwave receiver. The 
transmitted power is also boosted by microwave amplification to 
extend the distance of communication or to improve communica­
tion reliability and quality. If positive feedback is properly con-

trolled or eliminated, MESFET and tunnel diodes are readily 
adaptable for amplification. Other solid-state diodes, such as 
Gunn diodes and IMPATT diodes, may be used for amplification, 
but they are primarily oscillators which depend on electron transit 
time effects. It is therefore not easy to use them for amplification. 
Packaged transistors in the form of HMICs or MMICs are com­
mercially available [29-31],
Varactor diodes are used for microwave amplification. A var­
actor diode is a variable capacitance diode. The junction capaci­
tance of a p-n junction is a function of voltage across the diode. 
A photograph of a microwave amplifier which employs a variable 
capacitance diode is shown in Fig. 1.6. This type of amplifier is 
called a parametric amplifier [1,22] (Chapter 9). When the varac­
tor is excited by a local oscillator, called the pump oscillator, the 
energy of the pump oscillator is transferred to the signal frequency 
channel through the varactor. Thus amplification of input signals

(Chapter 9) is accomplished. An example of specification of a 
varactor diode is presented in Table 1.6.
Microwave amplification at high power levels is handled by 
klystrons and crossed field amplifiers [1,9,21,22]. An example of a 
klystron is shown in Fig. 1.7, and the specifications are tabulated 
in Table 1.7. When an input microwave signal is fed to a klystron, 
the signals cause velocity modulation in the electron beam. The 
velocity modulated electron beam produces bunched electrons, 
and bunched electrons induce large output signals in the output 
circuit by electrostatic induction. In this way, microwave input 
signals are amplified (Chapter 11).
A photograph of a crossed field amplifier is shown in Fig. 1.8. 
Its specifications are given in Table 1.8. In the crossed field 
amplifier in the magnetron, the rotating electron poles are formed 
by radial electric fields, axial magnetic fields, and input microwave 
signals in the anode structure. The anode is structured to accom­
modate traveling waves which travel along the anode structure. 
The anode structure surrounds the cathode of the crossed field 
amplifier.
If the speed of the traveling waves on the anode structure and 
the rotating speed of the electron poles are adjusted to be nearly 
equal, then there will be an interaction between the traveling 
microwave signals in the anode structure and the rotating electron 
poles. When mutual speed and phase are properly adjusted, the 
kinetic energy of the rotating electron poles transfers to the 
microwave signals by electrostatic induction and the microwave 
signals are amplified [1,19,21,22] (Chapter 16). Microwaves are 
also amplified quantum mechanically, as exemplified by masers

The Schottky barrier diode is made from a metal-semiconductor 
contact. It is used for microwave rectification and mixing (Chapter 
7) because of the low capacitance at the contact which is called

the Schottky barrier. A photograph of various Schottky barrier 
diodes and a waveguide mount is shown in Fig. 1.9. This particu­
lar photograph is for the mixer. A detector has a similar appear­
ance. The microwave input will be fed through the waveguide and 
detected. Video or beat frequency output is taken from the coaxial 
output. The specifications of the HP5082-2200 detector diode are 
shown in Table 1.9, and the specifications of a D5818A mixer 
diode are presented in Table 1.10.
Another method of demodulating by detection or mixing is 
based on the nonlinearity fo a semiconductor diode (Chapter 8). A 
special type of PIN diode called the step recovery diode, a 
junction diode with a heavily doped p-n junction called the back 
diode, and tunnel diodes [23,24] are highly nonlinear in their 
current-voltage characteristics. These diodes are also employed 
for detection and mixing (Chapters 7 and 8).
These microwave detectors and mixers for AM, FM, PCM, 
FSK, PSK, and OOK can be waveguide type, coaxial line type, or 
microstripline type. As with other assorted microwave compo-

nents, integrated units in the form of HMICs or MMICs are 
commercially available [32-34],
Other microwave electron devices which are remotely related 
to microwave demodulation are thermistors and barretter bolome­
ters. These devices are termed bolometric detectors [6], Their 
operation depends upon resistance changes due to microwave 
heating. Therefore, their response is usually slow, with low sensi­
tivity, and the devices are extremely fragile electrically. This is the 
prime reason that thermistors and barretters are not used for 
detection or mixing in communications. They are primarily used 
for precision microwave power measurement. These devices are 
used in a Wheatstone bridge to sense the resistance change caused 
by microwave heating of the element. Thermistors are made of a 
semiconductor material, and the temperature coefficient of the 
resistance is negative. Barretters are made of a fine tungsten wire, 
and the temperature coefficient of the resistance is positive. A

1.5 Microwave Multiplexing
Microwave power can be switched from one circuit to another or 
turned on and off by a reverse biased PIN diode [25,26] (Chapter 
11). A photograph of a microwave PIN diode and associated 
circuitry is shown in Fig. 1.12, and specifications of the diode are 
given in Table 1.13.
The PIN diode is a diode with a thin layer of intrinsic 
semiconductor (i) between p- and n-type semiconductors. This is 
then reverse biased at the threshold of avalanche breakdown. 
When microwaves are fed to the junction, it breaks down and the 
avalanche breakdown current flows. When the microwave power is 
removed, the avalanche breakdown ceases and no current flows. 
The microwave PIN diode is also called a microwave switching 
diode (Chapter 11) [27], Microwaves can also be turned on or off 
by controlling the de bias voltage. These solid-state microwave

switches are available in the HMIC or MMIC form as well as 
waveguide, coaxial line, and microstripline forms [35-37],
Microwave multiplexing, or switching, can also be done by 
microwave ferrite circulators (Chapter 13). A photograph of a 
microwave circulator is shown in Fig. 1.13, and the specifications 
are given in Table 1.14. When a piece of ferrite is magnetized, it 
produces asymmetrical tensor permeability [1,28]. This makes 
microwave propagation nonreciprocal in the ferrite media. Mi­
crowave switching can then be accomplished by utilizing the 
nonreciprocal propagation. These circulators can also take a form 
of waveguide type, coaxial line type, microstripline type, HMIC 
type, or MMIC type.
1.6 Features of Microwave Electronics

operating wavelength, the size of an electron device is usually

extremely small in comparison with its counterpart in lower 
frequency systems which function at equal operating power levels. 
The electron transit time at interelectrodes is significant and not at 
all negligible in microwave electronics. Electron devices are de­
signed to minimize the junction capacitances, and the lead induc­
tances are made as small as possible. The lead inductance tends to 
impede the entrance or exit of microwave energy and also to act 
as an antenna. This is one source of energy loss and electromag­
netic interference. The junction capacitance also tends to lower 
the input or output impedance of the device. The low input or

Microwave Transistors
2.1 
Transistors for Microwave Applications
Microwaves are amplified or generated by the use of microwave 
transistors. In low microwave frequencies, bipolar junction tran­
sistors (BIT) and junction field effect transistors (JFET) are func­
tional. They are the microwave versions of modified bipolar 
transistors and junction field effect transistors. For microwave 
operations, the size of the active device is smaller. The lead wire 
and the package configurations are carefully designed to reduce 
stray inductance, stray capacitance, and interelectrode capaci­
tance. In low ranges of microwave frequencies, the structure of 
microwave transistors is made small enough to eliminate the effect 
of interelectrode transit time [8]. The transistors can be fabricated 
using silicon, germanium, or gallium arsenide. Though the 
outward appearance of packaged microwave transistors is quite 
different from their low frequency counterparts, the operating 
principle of these microwave bipolar transistors and junction field 
effect transistors is the same [1-3]. In high microwave frequencies, 
however, simply reducing stray inductance, capacitance, and inter­
electrode capacitance is not enough. The interelectrode transit 
time must be sufficiently small in comparison with the period of 
operating microwave frequency. The mobility of electrons must be 
kept sufficiently high. At the same time, high thermal conductivity 
of the material is required so that the heat generated by the device 
21

22
Microwave Transistors
may be conducted away as quickly as possible [8]. Silicon and 
germanium, when compared with gallium arsenide (GaAs), are 
less favorable materials with respect to thermal conductivity and 
electron mobility. For high electron mobility in high frequency 
applications, high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) are used 
[9], An HEMT is a heterojunction FET with a high electron 
mobility channel [9].
To minimize the interelectrode capacitance, the configuration 
of the field effect transistor with an insulated gate is applied. In a 
MESFET, the insulated gate is created by a depletion layer due to 
metal-semiconductor contact. There will be a Schottky carrier 
depletion layer around the gate. This layer acts as the insulator for 
the gate. Such metal-semiconductor field effect transistors are 
called MESFET. In this chapter, structural design and applica­
tions of microwave BJTs, JFETs, MESFETs, and HEMTs are 
reviewed.
2.2 
Structure of Microwave Transistors
2.2.1 Microwave BJT
An example of a cross-sectional view of the active part of a 
microwave BJT is shown in Fig. 2.1 [10], This BJT is developed on 
a wafer of p-type Si with crystallographic orientation [100] and a
Fig. 2.1 Sketch of a cross-sectional view of a microwave BJT.

2.2 Structure of Microwave Transistors 23
resistivity of 10 Q-cm. This is an n-p-n transistor. The sketch is 
not proportional to actual size. In a BJT, all metal-semiconductor 
contacts are ohmic contacts [11], The n-type emitter is 1 fim wide, 
6 jam long, and 0.11 fim thick. This is doped with 1 X 102O/cm3 
arsenic ion implantation. The active layer of p-type base is 0.1 jam 
thick. This area is doped with 3 X 1017/cm3 boron ion implanta­
tion. The active base area is again 1 jam wide and 6 jam long, just 
below the emitter layer. The rest of the p-layer is considered to be 
a lead to the metallized base electrode. Collector n- and n+- layers 
are formed by antimony (Sb) diffusion 0.4 to 1.8 jam thick. The 
collector n-layer is doped with 4 X 1014 to 1.2 X 1016/cm3 Sb 
ions. The n+-layer is doped with 2 X 1019/cm3 Sb ions. Thickness 
of the n-layer is 0.03 to 0.6 jam. The n+-layer must have a good 
contact with the metallized collector electrode. The entire top 
surface is protected by a 30-nm thick SiO2 film.
The working collector current density for this type of BJT is 
about 1 mA/jam2. The electron transit time, r, from the emitter to 
collector in the active region is approximately 4 X10 12 s. If the 
active region is 2 jam thick, then the average drift velocity of 
electrons in this transistor is u = 2 jam/4 X 1(T12 s = 0.5 X 106 
m/s which is approximately 10“3 times the velocity of light in a 
vacuum.
If the operating microwave frequency is f and the period is T, 
it is desirable that T is greater than 10 times r, the electron transit 
time between the emitter and the collector in the active region. 
For t = 4 X 10“12 s, T> 4 X 10 11 s. Then f= 1/T < 25 GHz.
Since the active area of this transistor is about 1 jam X 6 
jam = 6 /rm2, the collector current density is 1 mA/jim2. This 
means that the collector current of this transistor is Ic = 6 mA. If 
the total number of carriers is n, the electronic charge is e, and 
the drift velocity is u, then Ic = nue or the total number of 
carriers involved is n = Ic/ue = 6 X 10“3 A/(0.5 X 106 m/s) 
(1.602 X IO’19 C) = 7.5 X IO10
When higher power is needed, multiples of the basic unit 
shown in Fig. 2.1 are developed on a wafer and connected in 
parallel, either monolithically or with gold wire bonds.
The metallization for the emitter, base, and collector are 
usually wire bonded to appropriate lead strips of a standard 
packaging of the transistor. If this transistor is a part of MMIC, 
then the electrode metallization is monolithically connected to the 
appropriate microstriplines from the outside.
In microwave frequency operation, it is desirable that the 
interelectrode capacitance is small. Knowing that the active region 

24 Microwave Transistors
has an area of A = 6 /xm2, the interelectrode capacitance between 
the emitter and base with thickness tE = 0.11 /xm and er = 11.8 
for silicon [11] is at least CEB = Eoer A/tE = (8.85 pF/m) (11.8)(6 
/xm2)/(0.11 /xm) = 0.006 pF. This is considered to be small even 
at microwave frequencies. Capacitive susceptance of CEB at / = 25 
GHz is Beb = 2tt/Ceb = 2vr(25 X 109)(0.006 X 10 ,2) = 0.942 
X 10 ~3 S. The shunt reactance is then XEB = 1/B EB = 1.06 X 103 
2. If the transistor is in a 50 2 system, 1.06 kS2 is significantly 
large. But in the real world there will be additional interlead 
capacitance and additional capacitance due to fringing fields, 
junction formation, and high frequency effects such as dispersion, 
radiation, dissipation, and polarization delay time. Therefore, by 
rule of thumb, the actual capacitance between the emitter lead to 
base lead CEB = 10CEB = 0.06 pF. This brings XEB down to 106 
2. This is indeed comparable to a 50 2 impedance system.
The capacitance between the base and the collector in the 
active region is CBC = (8.85 pF/m)(11.8 X 6 mm2)/1.9 /xm = 
0.0003 pF. Aj/- = 1/(2t7/Cbc) = [1/(2tt • 25 X 109 • 0.0003 X 
IO’12)] • 10 = 2.12 kS2.
The capacitance between the emitter and the collector is then 
CEC = (8.85 pF/m)(11.8 X 6 /im2)/(2 /xm) » CBC. Therefore 
X£c » 2.12 kS2.
The transistors may be used in the common emitter configu­
ration or common base configuration. These interelectrode capaci­
tances are important parameters to be considered for microwave 
amplifier, oscillator, and switching design.
The metallization of the electrode, bondwire, and lead mi­
crostrip can be considered part of a microwave transmission line 
to the outside world. For example, at f = 25 GHz, the free space 
wavelength is Xo = c/f = (3 X 108 m/s)/25 X 109 Hz = 12 
mm. The effective wavelength in silicon is A. = Xo/^Ey = 12 
mm/ /11.8 = 3.5 mm. The wave number for the metallized elec­
trode, which is only I = 6 /xm long, is l/X = (6 /xm)/(3500 /xm) = 
1.7 X 10“3 wavelengths. Considering that wave number 0.1 is the 
upper limit of the lumped parameter in “rule of thumb” mi­
crowave engineering, the metallization and bond wire of this order 
of magnitude can be treated as lumped parameters. The current 
carrying conductors of this order of magnitude present some 
inductance. The inductance of a conductor of length I = 6 /xm can 
be calculated by L = 2.3(/xo/2tt)/ = 2.3[(4tt X 10 7 H/m)/27r)] 
• 6 X 10 6 m = 8.6 pH. Therefore, in most cases, the inductance 
may be omitted. However, the inductance of this order of magni­
tude presents a reactive impedance of XL = 2tt(25 X 109)(8.6 X 
1012) = 1.35 2. This is not so small. For a 50 2 system, however, 

2.2 Structure of Microwave Transistors 25
this may be omitted. For lower system impedance, the lead 
impedance 1.35 Q may be significant.
For aluminum metallization with conductivity a = 3.82 X 107 
S/m of thickness t = 60 nm, width w =1 pm, and length I = 
6 pm, the resistance R = l/(owt) = 6 X 106/(3.82 X 107 X 10-6 
X 60 X 10"9) = 260 Q. This is a significant amount of resistance. 
When the metallization is used as a lumped electrode, the current 
configuration is different from the case in which the metallization 
is used as a lead strip. As a lumped electrode, the resistance of 260 
Q will not enter directly into the design of the device function. 
However, if the metallization or bond wire of this magnitude is 
used as a lead transmission line, a significant amount of resistance 
will be encountered with the design and device function. Lower 
resistance is obtainable by wider and thicker metallization.
As a user or designer of a BJT of this size, it is interesting to 
know the resistance between the emitter and the base (7?EB), the 
resistance between the base and the collector (7?BC), and the 
resistance between the emitter and the collector (7?EC). The values 
of these resistances vary greatly by the doping concentration and 
the magnitude and direction of bias voltages. For reference re­
garding the intrinsic silicon, the resistivity is p = 2.5 X 105 Q-cm 
[11]- ....
In the electrode configuration shown in Fig. 2.1, if the emit­
ter-base center-to-center distance /EB = 4 pm, the thickness of 
n-p layer is tEB = 1 pm, and the length of the metallization I = 
6 pm, then the intrinsic resistance i?EB is at least 7?EB = 
= (2.5 X 105 Q-pm)(4 pm)/(6 pm)(l pm) = 167 kQ. A similar 
order of magnitude of resistance can be expected between the 
emitter and the collector as in intrinsic silicon.
A resistance as much as twice that of 7?EB can be expected 
between the base and the collector. These resistance values are so 
high in comparison with the resistance of the associated compo­
nent (such as the biasing resistors) that the effect of the intrinsic 
resistance can be omitted. It can be treated as an insulator as far 
as the transistor performance and the circuit designs are con­
cerned. However, these silicon layers are doped and biased when 
operated. When it is in operation, the emitter-base junction is 
usually forward biased in such a way that the emitter is negative 
and the base is positive. The base-collector junction is reverse 
biased in such a way that the base is negative and the collection is 
positive. Because of the doping with impurity and junction for­
mation, the forward resistance between the base and emitter is as 
low as 0.5 kQ and the reverse resistance between the collector and 
the base is as high as 3.5 kQ [10].

26 Microwave Transistors
Fig. 2.2 Sketch of a cross-sectional view of a microwave JFET.
2.2.2 Microwave JFET
A cross-sectional view of a microwave junction field effect transis­
tor (JFET) is shown in Fig. 2.2. All metal-semiconductor contacts 
are ohmic contacts, as in the case of the BJT [11]. Most microwave 
JFETs are n-channel FETs. The source injects electrons which are 
then drained from the drain after the electrons have passed 
through a narrow n-channel. The electron flow is controlled by the 
negative potential applied to the gate. The gate is reverse biased. 
The carrier depletion region at the p-n junction is controlled by 
the reverse bias voltage across the gate. The n-channel thickness is 
controlled by the reverse bias gate voltage. Therefore the drain 
current is controlled by the gate voltage. So, as for any other 
transistor, if the proper amount of current-sensing impedance is 
connected in series with the drain, the output voltage appears 
across that impedance.
For a microwave JFET, the p+-layer can be as thin as tp = 0.1 
/rm. The thickness of the n-layer can be as little as tn = 0.2 /rm. 
The channel length, which is the shortest distance between the 
source and drain, is as short as 2 /rm for low microwave frequency 
JFETs and 0.5 /rm for high microwave frequency JFETs [6]. A 
popular substrate is semi-insulating GaAs. The donor concentra­
tion in the n-layer is on the order of 1017donors/cm3. The electron 
saturation velocity in this sort of n-type GaAs is known to be 
about 100 km/s. The electron transit time across the channel 

2.2 Structure of Microwave Transistors 27
length for 0.5 /xm is 0.5 /xm/100 km/s = 5 ps and for 
2 /xm is 2 /xm/100 km/s = 20 ps. Using the “rule of thumb” 
factor 10, the working microwave frequency should be in the 
range of 1/50 ps = 20 GHz to 1/200 ps = 5 GHz for the upper 
working frequency limit with the given channel length. Electron 
mobility in GaAs is 8500 cm2/V-s which is larger than electron 
mobility in Si, 1350 cm2/V-s [11]. In spite of that, it is of interest 
to note that the specific resistivity of GaAs 4 X 108 fi-cm is larger 
than the specific resistivity of Si, which is 2.5 X 105 Q-cm. The 
relative permittivity of GaAs is 13.2 and is comparable to the 
relative permittivity of Si, which is 11.8 [11], Therefore interelec­
trode capacitances of a Si FET and a GaAs FET of comparable 
size would have comparable values of capacitance. For example, 
in a microwave GaAs JFET, if the metallization strip is wm = 1 
/xm wide and /m = 6 /xm long and these are separated by de = 2 
/xm, center-to-center, then the minimum interelectrode capaci­
tance between the source and the gate CSG, and the minimum 
interelectrode capacitance between the gate and the drain CGD 
can be estimated. For the n-layer thickness hn = 0.2 /xm as 
CSG = CGD = eoer/2n/m/< = (8.85 pF/m)(3.8)(0.2 /xm)(6 /xm)/2 
/xm = 73 /xpF. The capacitive reactance XSG = XGD = 
1/WCSG) = 1/(2tt/Cgd). At f = 20 GHz, XSG = XGD = 
1/(277 X 20 X 109 X 73 X 10“6 X IO’12) = 109 kfi. This amount 
of reactance is considered too high for usual 50 Q systems. 
Therefore that much interelectrode capacitance will not enter into 
consideration of the transistor performance. The interelectrode 
capacitance between the source and the drain CSD can be esti­
mated to be half of CSG or CGD. So it can also be omitted for the 
design and performance analysis of the device.
A microwave JFET of this size can operate with a drain 
current ID = 0.9 mA [13], The cross section of the n-channel is 
/m/zn = (6 /xm)(0.2 /xm) = 1.2 /xm2, and the current density in the 
channel JD is approximately JD = ID/lmhn = 0.9 mA/1.2 /xm2 = 
0.75 mA//xm2. It is interesting to note that the working current 
density in GaAs JFET is on the same order of magnitude as the 
working current density in Si BJT presented in Sec. 2.2.1.
The effective wavelength Xeff in GaAs at an operating fre­
quency of f = 20 GHz is Xeff = c/(^€~rf) = 3 X 10 8 m/s/ 
(/13.2 X 20 X 109) = 4.12 mm. One tenth of Xeff is 412 /xm and 
thus the length of metallized electrodes of the source, gate, and 
drain can be as long as /m = 412 /xm, without considering the 
standing wave effect on the electrodes. For higher power, a longer 
electrode is needed [13],

28 Microwave Transistors
In the lm = 6 pm and wm = 1 pm device, the drain current 
ID = 0.9 mA is reached when the drain-source voltage FDS = 5 V 
with the channel wide open. At this voltage, the equivalent 
drain-source resistance J?DS = FDS//D = 5 V/0.9 mA = 5.6 kfi. 
This means that the resistivity of the channel is pDS = _RDS/m 
(hn — hp)/2de = (5.6 kfi)(6pm)(0.2 — 0.1 pm)/(2 X 2 pm) = 
0.84 kffpm. This compares with intrinsic GaAs resistivity 400 
MQ-pm [11], If the channel is narrowed by biasing the gate 
negatively, the effective resistivity would be higher.
For higher power operation, many single units as shown in 
Fig. 2.2 can be connected in parallel either monolithically or by 
wire bonding. On the other hand, the length of the electrodes lm 
can be increased. If lm is increased to 60 pm instead of 6 pm, _RDS 
would be 560 2 instead of 5.6 kfi. The current capacity would 
increase 10 times and the power handling capability under the 
same FDS = 5 V de would increase 10 times if a proper heat sink 
is provided. The de power loss of lm = 6 pm device is PDC = 
FDS/D = 
V)(0.9 mA) = 4.5 mW. At most, i) = 30% efficiency
can be expected. Therefore the upper limit of lm = 6 pm JFET of 
this type would be PRF = r)PDC = 0.3 X 4.5 mW = 1.35 mW = 
101og10(1.35 mW/1 mW) = 1.3 dBm. This means that if lm = 
60 pm, the output power can be as high as 13.5 mW or 11.3 dBm.
2.2.3 MESFET
A simplified cross-sectional view of the active portion of a GaAs 
MESFET is schematically shown in Fig. 2.3. The diagram may 
give the reader a false impression with respect to size, but the 
actual size outlined in Fig. 2.3 is about one tenth the thickness of 
a human hair. Therefore, it is difficult to see the active portion 
with the naked eye. This size transistor is designed for operat­
ing frequencies in a range of 10-20 GHz. The period of 20 GHz is 
50 ps. To avoid electron transit time effect, it is desirable that 
electrons travel from the source to the drain in less than one tenth 
the period of operating frequency. In this case, that is only 5 ps or 
less. The drift velocity of electrons in the channel between the 
source and the drain is approximately 100 km/s under working 
conditions. Thus, the distance between the source and the drain 
must be at most 0.5 pm. This is the reason that an almost invisibly 
small size is needed. Though the active portion of the GaAs 
MESFET is “invisibly” small, the packaged transistor is of a 
somewhat more comfortable size to handle. An example of the top 
view pattern of bonding pads by which leads are attached to the

active portion is sketched in Fig. 2.4. Using a properly shaped 
bonding pad and bonding wires, the transistor chip is packaged 
and connected to the external circuit.
It should be noted that both the drain and the source are 
ohmic contacts to the active n-type epitaxial layer as seen in Fig. 
2.3, but the gate is a Schottky contact. Therefore, when negatively 
biased with respect to the source as shown in Fig. 2.3, a control­
lable carrier depletion region will develop. Under this condition, 
the gate is practically insulated and the action of the transistor 
resembles the action of a metal oxide semiconductor field effect 
transistor (MOSFET), which is one of the insulated gate field 
effect transistors (IGFET) [11,12], Unlike the MOSFET, the insu­
lation region around the gate of a MESFET is controllable, and it 
squeezes and pinches the electron flow in the channel. In Fig. 2.3, 
a general biasing scheme and microwave signal input voltage 
and output voltage vo are indicated respectively. Many of the

2.2.4 HEMT
There are many various structures of high electron mobility tran­
sistors (HEMT). Most HEMTs are heterojunction FETs. It is 
impossible to review all existing designs, so one example of 
HEMT design is detailed in Fig. 2.5. The main feature of an 
HEMT is its high frequency adaptability [15], The source metal­
lization and the drain metallization are extended by ohmic contact

(10 nm), and GaAs (8 nm) layers are doped n-type.
to n+-type GaAs. Thus a heterojunction is clearly defined, as 
shown in Fig. 2.5. A heterojunction is a junction formed by 
different materials. In this design, the channel length from the 
source n+ GaAs to the drain n+ GaAs is /SD = 1.6 jtm. This 
channel is made of layers of 2 X 1018/cm3 Cr doped heterojunc­
tions of AlGaAs, InGaAs, and GaAs, as shown in Fig. 2.5. 
Between the top layer and undoped GaAs layer is an insulating 
layer for the gate. The fifth layer of 1 jtm thick undoped GaAs is a 
buffer layer. Note that the active layers are a total of 68 nm thick, 
or the channel thickness tc = 0.068 jtm. High mobility electrons 
are provided between the layers of AlGaAs and InGaAs, InGaAs 
and doped GaAs, and within the InGaAs layer itself [15]. The gate

metallization is only / = 0.2 jim wide and lm = 50 jam long. 
These are fabricated by electron beam lithography [15,16], The 
channel is an n-channel with length lc = 1.6 pm [15], The gate is 
located closer to the source. This greater proximity provides better 
gate control over electron injection from the source. It is located 
only 0.3 pm from the source and 1.1 pm from the drain. The 
maximum drain current, 800 mA per mm gate length, is obtained 
at the gate voltage KSG = 0.6 V with the drain voltage KD = 4.3 V 
[15], This means that for the actual lm = 50 pm, the drain current 
/D is /D = (800 mA)(50 /im)/1000 jam = 40 mA. In the same 
HEMT, /D = 24 mA is reported when KSG = 0 V [15],
The cross-sectional area of the active n-channel is Ac = tclm 
= (0.068 jiim)(50 jam) = 3.4 pm2. When KSG = 0 V, the channel 
resistance RSD ~ VD/ID = 4.3 V/24 mA = 179 0. The resistivity 
of this channel is then p = RsoAc/lc — (179 fi)(3.4 jam2)/1.6 
jam = 380 fi-jam. This is extremely low in comparison with p of 
intrinsic GaAs which is p = 4 X 108 fi-jam [11],
If the electron charge is q (C), the average drift velocity in the 
channel is u (m/s), the donor density is VD (m 3), and the 
cross-sectional area of the channel is A (m2), the drain current 
/D (A) is /D = NnquA. Therefore the average drift velocity of 
electrons is u = In/NnqA, using VG = 0 V, KD = 4.3 V, u = 24 mA/ 
(2 X 1018 cm“3)(1.6 X 10“19 C)(3.4 jam2) = 2.2 X 107 m/s. 
This is very fast when compared with the saturation electron 
velocity in degenerate n-type GaAs, which is about 105 m/s. 
Electrons move more than 100 times faster than n-channel 
GaAs FET.
The average electric field strength E in the channel is E ~ 
KD/ZC = 4-3 V/1.6 jam = 2.7 V/jam = 2.7 X 104 V/cm. Electron 
mobility pm (cm2/V-s) = u/E = (2.2 X 107 m/s)(102 cm)/(2.7 
X 104 V/cm) = 8.15 X 104 (cm2/V-s). This compares with 1.35 
X 103cm2/V-s in Si, 3.9 X 103cm2/V-s in Ge, 8.5 X 103cm2/V-s 
in GaAs, and 2.26 X 104 cm2/V-s in InAs [11], The electron 
mobility in this HEMT is approximately ten times the electron 
mobility in an ordinary GaAs MESFET.
The operating frequency is reported to be 55 GHz [11]. With 
the electron velocity u = 2.2 X 107 m/s, the electron transit time 
across the channel of thickness lc = 1.6 jam is r = lc/u = 1.6 pm/ 
(2.2 X 107 m/s) X 106 jam/m) = 0.073 X 10 12 s. The electron
transit angle for this r is then 0 = ut = 2,7(55 X 109)(0.073 X
10“12) = 2.5 X 10 2 radians or 0 = 360° X 2.5 X 10~2/2ir =
5.73 degrees. This is well within the “rule of thumb” value of
36 degrees. Therefore it is possible to operate at 55 GHz.

2.3 Transistor Current Control 33
The output of this HEMT is reported to be 0.85 W per mm 
gate length. Since the actual gate length is /m = 50 gm, the actual 
5 5 GHz output power is P = (0.85 W/mm)(10-3mW/W)(50p.m) = 
42.5 mW. Since this HEMT is considered to be an insulated gate 
FET (IGFET), the resistance between the source and the gate and 
the gate and the drain is extremely high in a 50 system. 
However, as noted before, i?SD = 179 fi. This is a significant 
value to be considered in a 50 system design. The interelectrode 
capacitances and inductances arising because of metallization of 
the source, gate, and drain of this HEMT are, as other types of 
microwave transistors—even at 55 GHz—not significant for de­
sign consideration. This is because of the small size of the struc­
ture.
2.3 Transistor Current Control
In a microwave BJT, the injected base current 7b, controls collec­
tor current Ic. In a microwave JFET, MESFET, or HEMT, the 
voltage applied to the gate controls the drain current. A common 
configuration to all transistors is that a current-sensing impedance 
is connected in series with the collector circuit or drain circuit 
most of the time, and the voltage across the current-sensing 
impedance (often called the load impedance of the transistor) is 
considered to be the output voltage. The current-sensing 
impedance or the load impedance is sometimes connected in series 
with the emitter or the source. Such a circuit is called the emitter 
follower or the source follower. For a microwave BJT, the current 
gain ;8 = IC/IB is a matter of interest. For the FET and HEMT, 
the transconductance g = ID/VG is a matter of concern. Large 
values of ft or g mean high gain of the transistor for a given load 
impedance.
2.3.1 Microwave BJT
In a microwave n-p-n BJT as shown in Fig. 2.1, the emitter- base 
junction is forward biased; the emitter is negative and the base is 
positive. The collector-base junction is reverse biased; the collec­
tor is positive and the base is negative. The collector current is 
defined as Ic, the base current is 7B, and the emitter current is IB. 
Kirchhoffs current law is applied to the entire transistor as a

In most transistors, IE~ 1c. A part of /E is lost in the base 
current by recombination with holes injected into the base. The 
rest of the /E carrier electrons reach the collector and appear as 
the collector current Ic. For example, if IE lost 1% of carrier in 
the base region due to the injected /B, then Ic = 0.99/E. Then 
= 0.99/e/(/e — 0.99/E) = 0.99/0.01 = 99. For a high beta 
transistor, on the order of 100 is common. Now
4 = 04 
(2-3.3)
so the collector current Ic is controlled by the base current /B.
In a linear region where is constant, dlc = 0d54 and
dIe
(2.3.4)
This knowledge is useful since in most cases the base must be 
forward de biased and signal current is superimposed on the de 
bias current. For example, if the transistor is properly de biased 
and j8d is a constant, and the injected signal current in the base is 
3/B = /sinwt 
(2.3.5)
then the collector signal current is
dlc = /3d/sin (w/ + <j>) 
(2.3.6)
where <p is the phase delay due to finite hole-electron recombina­
tion time in the base region and the effective electron transit time 
in the base-collector region, if it is significant. Thus the collector 
current is controlled by the base injection current.
2.3.2 JFET, MESFET, and HEMT
For JFETs and MESFETs the drain current ID in the n-channel is 
controlled by a negatively biased gate voltage. The control mecha­
nism is two-fold. The control is accomplished both by Coulomb 
forces acting on electrons in the channel and by the effective 

2.3 Transistor Current Control 35
channel thickness, which depends on the negatively biased deple­
tion layer of the gate p-n junction for JFET and the Schottky 
depletion layer at the metal-semiconductor contact for the MES- 
FET. For the HEMT, the current is primarily controlled by the 
Coulomb force. The gate is insulated and located close to the 
source. The gate voltage can swing to positive in order to pull 
more electrons out of the source. The n-channel of the HEMT is 
well insulated and the electrons are therefore pulled out from the 
source by the gate and the drain voltage and are forced to go to 
the drain with high velocity. The velocity of the electrons can be 
controlled by the Coulomb force of the gate voltage.
The Coulomb force on an electron in the n-channel of a FET 
is
dw
m— = qE = q{EG + £D) 
(2.3.7)
where m is the electron mass, u is the electron velocity along the 
channel, q is the electron charge, and E is the electric field 
strength in the channel along the direction of the channel which 
consists of the sum of the electric field strengths due to the gate 
Eg and the drain FD. Then the steady state electron velocity is
« = 
= Mn(£G + £d) 
(2.3.8)
where is the electron mobility in the channel. The drain current 
due to the Coulomb force is
= lmENv>qu = 
+ ^d) 
(2.3.9)
where /m is the channel width, tc is the channel thickness and ND 
is the carrier concentration. If the channel length is /c, the 
distance between the source and the gate is /SG, the gate voltage is 
VG, and the drain voltage is VD, then

where k is a correction factor due to EG not being exactly equal to 
FG//SG and FD not being exactly equal to FD//C. This equation 
shows clearly that the drain current is controlled by the gate 
voltage. When VG is positive 7D increases, and when VG is 
negative 7D decreases. The static transconductance is then

For example, in the HEMT presented in Section 2.2, lm = 50 gm, 
tc = 0.068 /im, JVD = 2 X 1018/cm3, q = 1.6 X IO19 C, gn = 
8.15 X 104 cm2/V-s, /SG = 0.3 gm, lc = 1.6 gm, VD = 4.3 V, 
VG = 0.6 V, and /D = 40 mA [15], In this case
Gtr = k(50 X 10“6 m)(0.068 X 10“6 m)(2 X 1018cm“3)

It is of interest to note that a larger gtr is obtained by making /SG 
smaller.
For the HEMT in question, gtr at CD = 4.3 V is gtr = 28.4 X 
10 3 Siemens [15], This means that if the gate voltage changes 
1 V, the drain current changes by 28.4 mA.
For JFETs and MESFETs, tc is a function of VG. It is well 
known that at VG the thickness of the carrier depletion region w 
at the reverse biased junction or Schottky contact area is propor­
tional to \JVO + VG where Vo is the contact potential at the gate 
p-n junction of the JFET or at the Schottky contact of MESFET 
[11]. If kc is a proportionality constant, then
w = 
+ rG 
(2.3.13)
If the channel thickness when VG = 0 is fco, then under reverse 
biased conditions,
tc = fco - ^ = Co - MC + rG (2.3.14)
Combining Eq. 2.3.14 with Eq. 2.3.11, the static transconductance 
is (with the understanding that the gate voltage is negative and is

used only to control the channel thickness)
Gtr = kim(tco - yro+ kg)adWdU-^ (2.3.15)

To obtain the dynamic transconductance from Eq. 2.3.10 with the 
understanding that the gate voltage is negative,

Here again 7D is controlled by VG. Then,

Both Gtr and gtr are nonlinear with respect to VG.
For example, for the case of a JFET presented in Section 
2.2.2, 7d = 8.7 mA, lm = 6 jim, 2VD = 1017cm 3, tco = 0.2 jim, 
q = 1.6 X 10“19 C, /SG = 2 fim, lc = 4 Mm, kG = 0V, kD = 5 V, 
Vo = 0.5 V, and jin = 5.8 X 103 cm2/V-s [7,13], It is also known 
from the VD-ID curve of this JFET, it cuts off at FG = 1.5 V and

Knowing both values of kc and k, the value of static transcon­

An important mechanism is that the drain current in an HEMT is 
mainly controlled by the Coulomb force from the gate, and the 
drain current in a JFET or MESFET is mainly controlled by the 
thickness of the depletion layer as a result of the negative voltage 
applied to the gate.
2.4 Voltage Gain
In a bipolar junction transistor, the collector current is controlled 
by the current injected into the base. Usually a current-sensing 
impedance or load impedance is connected to the collector. The 
output signal voltage is developed across the load impedance Zc. 
The base current is a combination of the de base current Ib and 
microwave signal current zb. The collector current is a combina­
tion of the de collector current Ic and microwave signal current zc. 
The microwave collector current zc and microwave base current zb

If the output microwave voltage across the load impedance ZL is

across the base-emitter terminal of the transistor is , then

For example, if a high [i transistor of [i = 100 is chosen and ZL is 
chosen to be equal to ZBE, then A = 201ogw(100) (ZBE/ZBE) = 
40 dB. This is quite a high gain for a single stage amplifier.
For JFETs, MESFETs, or HEMTs, the microwave drain cur­
rent id is related to the microwave gate voltage or microwave 
input voltage at the gate by the dynamic transconductance gtr 
by
gtr = -

If the current-sensing impedance or load impedance ZL is 
connected in series with the drain, the output voltage vo across the 
load impedance is then

The voltage gain, or the voltage amplification A, for the JFET, 
MESFET, or HEMT is then
A - - = gtrZL

For example, if a microwave FET with gtr = 5 X 10 3(S) is used 
with ZL = 1000 £2, then /i(dB) = 201og10 A = 201og10 (5 X 10 ~3 
X 1000) = 14 dB.
In microwave transistor engineering, in addition to /?d and gtr, 
the performance of a transistor, including the voltage gain, is 
expressed by the S-parameters [4,12], S-parameters are basically 
the voltage reflection coefficients and the voltage transmission 
coefficients viewed from the input and output of the transistor. A 
transistor is viewed as a two-port network. The input is Port 1 and 
the output is Port 2. When the transistor is in action, there are 
voltage waves converging toward the transistor and voltage waves 
diverging from the transistor. For example, the converging voltage 
wave toward Port 1, Pf, is the incident microwave voltage wave. 
The diverging voltage wave from Port 1, ly, consists of the 
reflected waves at Port 1, K/, caused by Vf and transferred wave 
V" from Port 2. At Port 2, the diverging wave ly consists of the 
transferred or amplified voltage wave F2tr from Port 1 and the 
reflected wave K2r at Port 2 due to the converging voltage wave F2C, 
which in most cases is the reflection from the load impedance 
back into the transistor.
Hence,
V? = 
+ K1tr 
(2.4.10)
f/ = r2tr + r2r 
(2.4.11)
If the voltage reflection coefficient at Port 1 is pp then by 
definition,
Ff = pXc 
(2.4.12)
If the voltage transfer coefficient from Port 2 to Port 1 is t12, then 
by definition
V? = 
(2.4.13)
If the voltage reflection coefficient at Port 2 is p2, then by 
definition,
F2r = p2F2c 
(2.4.14)
If the voltage transfer coefficient from Port 1 to Port 2 is t21, then,

If Eqs. 2.4.14 and 2.4.15 are substituted in Eq. 2.4.11,
E2d = f2tf + p/2c 
(2.4.17)
Eqs. 2.4.16 and 2.4.17 can be combined and expressed in matrix 
form such as [4]

In the case of a microwave transistor, Vf is the microwave 
incident voltage applied across the input terminal, which can be 
the base-emitter terminal or the gate-source terminal. V2 is the 
reflection from the load at the collector or drain. Vd is the voltage 
wave going back toward the signal source at the input terminal. 
K2d is the voltage wave going toward the load at the collector or 
the drain. If Vf *s the transistor input voltage, then the voltage

An example is shown in Fig. 2.6 [17], In this figure, all S-parame- 
ters on microwave power for the S8851 JS8851-AS GaAs FET are 
plotted and the magnitudes and the phase angles are tabulated 
against the operating frequency. This is a GaAs power FET. The 
magnitude of S21 is not so large, but the output can be as high as 
24 dBm. At 2 GHz, | S211 = 4.37. This means that the voltage 
gain is 20 log | S211 = 20 log 4.37 « 13 db. At 8 GHz, 20 log 1.98 
« 6 dB and at 11 GHz, 20 log 1.40 ~ 3 dB.
As seen from Eqs. 2.4.5 and 2.4.9, to calculate the voltage gain 
or to design a microwave amplifier, it is necessary to know the 
equivalent circuit of the transistor and specific values of the circuit 
parameters. These are available from a manufacturer’s specifica­
tion sheet. For example, the equivalent circuit of the JS8851-AS 
transistor and the circuit parameters are shown in Fig. 2.7 [17]. In

this figure, gm is the transconductance. This power FET has 10 
unit transistors which are monolithically connected in parallel 
[17], Therefore the transconductance per unit FET is 6.5 mS. t is 
the electron transit time in the channel; 1/t = 1/5.3 X 10 12 = 
189 X 109 Hz is the cutoff frequency of this transistor. The 
drain-gate capacitance Cdg and the gate source capacitance Cgs 
are indicative that the gate is insulated. Resistances Rdg and Rgs 
represent the small conduction loss and dielectric loss in the 
reverse biased gate. The microwave power loss within the channel 
is mainly represented by Rds. In practice, an external input circuit

will be connected between the gate and the source terminal and an 
external output circuit will be connected between the drain termi­
nal and the source terminal in Fig. 2.7.
2.5 
Microstrip Circuit with Microwave Transistors
Depending on the types of microwave transistor, the selection of 
the Q-point, the de bias circuit, and the polarity may differ, yet 
the configurations of microwave circuit patterns are similar to 
each other. Therefore, as an example, a microwave FET circuit is 
shown in this section. The same idea will apply to microwave 
BJTs, JFETs, MESFETs, and HEMTs. A schematic circuit dia­
gram of a conventional radio frequency amplifier circuit using an 
FET is shown in Fig. 2.8. In this diagram, the gate and the drain 
resonators are represented by parallel LC circuits. Capacitors Cc 
couple to the input or output rf circuit outside. These are also 
used for blocking the de gate or drain voltage to the rf circuits. 
The radio frequency choke coils are represented by RFC. The 
RFC prevents escaping microwave energy through lead wires for 
de biasing. Some residual rf signal is further grounded by the 
feedthrough capacitors, labeled FTC. Bypassing capacitors Cb are 
used to ground one end of the resonator for rf while keeping the 
de bias voltage from grounding.
When the rf input voltage Vin is fed across the input terminal, 
the input line is properly tapped to the input resonator coil to 
match the input circuit impedance. Then the input resonator is 
sufficiently excited to produce a good control voltage at the gate

of the FET. The gate voltage is amplified at the drain, and the 
amplified rf voltage appears across the drain resonator circuit. The 
drain is tapped to match the drain impedance to the drain 
resonator impedance. The output is coupled through a proper tap 
to the resonator coil to match the impedance of the circuit 
outside.
The circuit analogous to Fig. 2.8 is built for high microwave 
frequencies utilizing microstripline technology. A schematic dia­
gram of the microstripline version of Fig. 2.8 is shown in Fig. 2.9. 
In this figure, both the gate and drain resonators are replaced by 
half-wavelength resonators. The rf choke coils are replaced by 
quarter-wavelength lines, and the feedthrough capacitors are re­
placed by capacitor pads. The coupling capacitors are replaced by 
chip capacitors. The stripline resonator is tapped at a proper 
location to match the impedance of the tapping line to the 
impedance of the stripline resonator at the tapping point 
[12,13,18,19], According to transmission line theory, the impedance 
of both ends of a half-wavelength resonator is maximum, and the 
impedance at the middle is minimum [4] (Appendix 1). Therefore,

the de bias lines for the gate and the drain are tapped in the 
middle of the resonator with the quarter-wavelength line with 
the capacitor pads. The transmission line theory shows that the 
impedance of a point one quarter-wavelength (or an odd number 
multiple of quarter-wavelengths) from a capacitively-short-cir- 
cuited point is infinite [4], Therefore very little microwave energy 
will enter into the quarter-wavelength line in Fig. 2.9. Usually, 
microstriplines used as bias lines are made as narrow as practical. 
Narrow microstriplines have higher characteristic impedance than 
wider microstriplines [20]. This helps reduce the coupling of 
microwaves from resonators to the bias lines. A single stage 
amplifier, as shown in Fig. 2.9, can be monolithically integrated 
with either a Si or GaAs substrate to the size of 2.2 mm X 1.1 mm 
chip at the 20-40 GHz range [19]. An example is shown in Fig. 
2.10. In Fig. 2.10, the active device is a dual gate HEMT [19]. 
Microwaves of 20 GHz are fed to the device from the left. The 
step microstrip near the input is the impedance-matching design. 
The input line is connected to the gate of the HEMT. The gate is 
biased from the lower side where the capacitor pad and a Xz/4 
thin bias line are shown. The short thin line section which is 
collinear with the input line is the input impedance-matching 
section between the input line and the gate of the HEMT. A wide 
area of metallization along the edge of this IC chip is the ground­
ing metallization. The source of this HEMT is connected to this 
grounding metallization as seen in the middle of Fig. 2.10. The 

2.6 Microwave Cavity Circuit with Transistors 47
output step microstripline is connected to the drain at the right. A 
thin X,/4 bias line and a capacitor pad are seen in the upper part 
of Fig. 2.10. The reason for stepping the microstripline is to match 
impedance [18], This amplifier can operate up to 10 dBm output 
with 1 dB output power compression at 30 GHz, a gain of 6 dB, 
and a noise figure of 5 dB [19],
If the operating frequency is in the low microwave frequencies 
(e.g. 1.6-2.3 GHz), the power is high (e.g. 20 W), and a packaged 
surface mounted microwave transistor (NE 345L-20B) and low 
permittivity substrate are used, the microstripline circuit board 
can be as large as 6 cm X 6 cm [24].
2.6 
Microwave Cavity Circuit with Transistors
The microwave cavity resonator version of a microwave transistor 
amplifier as shown in Fig. 2.8 is schematically shown in Fig. 2.11.
The FET chip is packaged in a coaxial structure as shown. 
Both the gate resonator and the drain resonator are employed as 
semicoaxial resonators. As seen from Fig. 2.11, the source is 
grounded to the center wall of the cavity resonator. The length of 
the center stud of the gate cavity is three quarters of the wave­
length. One end of the stud is grounded to the cavity wall. 
According to coaxial line theory, (Appendix 2) the radial electric 
field at a point one half wavelength from the shorting end is zero. 
Therefore, a bias lead for the gate is attached there through a
Coaxially Packaged FET

feedthrough capacitor. The gate is attached approximately one 
quarter-wavelength from the bias feeding point as seen from Fig. 
2.11. At this point, both the voltage and the impedance are 
considered to be maximum. The microwave input signals are fed 
through a coaxial capacitive coupler at a matching location along 
the stud [5],
The drain cavity resonator is structured by the same reason­
ing, but the length of the center stud is quite different from three 
quarters of a wavelength [5], This is to accommodate the 
impedance-matching at the drain. The drain has a finite impedance. 
Adjusting the stud length produces an analogous effect to tapping 
the resonator coil in Fig. 2.8. Both the drain and the gate res­
onators usually resonate at the same frequency.
Thus, the coaxially packaged FET is properly biased. If the 
input microwaves are fed through the inpout coaxial cable, the 
center stud gives control signals to the gate and the amplified 
voltage appears on the center stud of the drain cavity. The 
amplified microwaves are coupled from the output coupling ca­
pacitor and the coaxial cable. For example, when a MSC85856 
coaxial transistor is operated in the range of 2.5-3.5 GHz, the 
total length of the two cavities would be 5.7 cm. The center stud 
has dimensions of 3.8 cm cavity wall i.d. and 0.28 cm o.d. The 
operating output power is about 600 mW [6],
2.7 
Features of Microwave Transistors
To be useful as a microwave transistor, the following conditions, 
among others, must be met.
1. Electron mobility must be high in the channel.
2. Thermal conductivity for cooling must be high.
3. Interelectrode capacitance must be small.
4. Lead inductance must be small.
As studied in this chapter, small size bipolar junction transis­
tors, junction field effect transistors with n-type GaAs channels, 
and high electron mobility transistors meet all the conditions cited 
above. Most microwave transistors are inherently wide band de­
vices. The frequency bandwidth is determined primarily by the 
bandwidth of the circuit with which it is to be connected.
The cutoff frequency of a microwave transistor calculated 
from the reciprocal of the electron transit time between the 
emitter and the collector, or between the source and the drain, will 

Problems 49
produce a far greater value than the actual upper limit of the 
operating frequency of the transistor. The upper limit of the 
operating frequency of a transistor is determined by:
1. electron transit time from the emitter to the collector or the 
source to the drain.
2. time constant of the transistor input and output circuits.
By adding positive feedback to an amplifier with (2n + 1)tt 
phase difference between the base and the collector microwave 
voltages, or the gate and the drain microwave voltages, the ampli­
fiers turn into oscillators, where n is zero or an integral number. 
The simplest method of designing a feedback loop is connecting 
the base and the collector or the gate and the drain with a 
properly undercoupled (2n + l)Xz/2 transmission line, where 
is the wavelength of the transmission line. Because of the nature 
of practical microwave circuits, most microwave oscillators are 
Colpitts oscillators.
Depending on the selection of the Q-point, a microwave 
transistor can be highly nonlinear. If operated in this nonlinear 
mode, the transistors can be used as harmonic generators, mixers, 
demodulators, and mixer-local oscillators [23].
Many microwave transistor circuit design files are available 
for computer aided design using a personal computer [21,22], Use 
of commercial CAD software is an efficient way of designing a 
specific transistor circuit if it fits the needs. Otherwise, the design 
must be created following an established procedure [18].

Microwave Tunnel Diodes
3.1 Tunnel Effect in Degenerate Semiconductor Junctions
When a p-type semiconductor is heavily doped, the Fermi energy 
level is in the valence band. On the other hand, if an n-type 
semiconductor is heavily doped, the Fermi energy level is in the 
conduction band. These heavily doped semiconductors are called 
degenerate semiconductors. If a degenerate p-type semiconductor 
and n-type semiconductor are joined to make a junction diode, 
such a diode is called an Esaki diode [1]. An electron energy 
diagram of the Esaki diode [2-5] is sketched in Fig. 3.1. As seen 
from this diagram, a thin layer of forbidden energy gap is created 
at the junction. If the diode is slightly forward biased, raising the 
Fermi energy level EF of the n-type semiconductor, electrons in 
the low edge of the conduction band in the n-type semiconductor 
tunnel through the thin forbidden gap and recombine with holes 
in the upper edge of the valence band of the p-type semiconduc­
tor. In this bias voltage region, the diode current is carried along 
mainly by this tunneling process. This is the reason the diode is 
also called a tunnel diode. The tunneling speed is extremely high, 
which is an advantage in high frequency operation.
For example, if the p-n junction is formed by conventional 
nondegenerate semiconductor, then the carrier concentration is on 
the order of 1016 carriers/cm3 [5], In the tunnel diode that is 
53

formed by a degenerate semiconductor junction, the carrier con­
centration is on the order of 1O17-1O20 carriers/cm3 [11], The 
forbidden band gap Ec — Ev in Fig. 3.1 is known to be 1.1 eV for 
Si, 0.72 eV for Ge, 0.13 eV for GaAs, 0.18 eV for InSb, and 
0.33 eV for InAs [5], Depending on the carrier concentration, the 
relative location of the Fermi energy level Ev — EF or EF — Ec 
in Fig. 3.1 can be as high as (£c — £v)/2. 
P
Consider a typical microwave tunnel diode made of a degener­
ate Ge semiconductor with the donor concentration Nd = 
1017/cm3. The active p-n region has a size of 50 pm X 50 pm and 
a thickness of 10 pm. When forward biased to V = 500 mV, the 
thickness of the transitional forbidden band gap as shown in 
Fig. 3.1 becomes as narrow as d = 0.3 nm [11], The electron 
mobility in degenerate Ge is known to be at least pn = 220 
cm2/V-s [5], The velocity of electrons tunneling through the 
narrow forbidden gap d is therefore u = pnV/d = (220 X 10-4 
m2/V-s) (0.5 V/0.3 X 10-9 m = 0.37 X 108 m/s. This is almost 
one tenth the velocity of light in a vacuum, and almost equal to 
the velocity of electrons in microwave vacuum traveling wave 
tubes. This tunneling speed is high compared with the electron 
velocity in conventional bulk semiconductor, which is on the order 
of 105 m/s.
In reality, the tunneling is done via the de Broglie wave 
function. Therefore, the upper bound of the tunneling speed 
approaches c//j\ which is 3 X 108 m/s/TlfT = 0.75 X 108 m.

3.2 Diode Current Generated by the Tunnel Effect 55
The electron transit time for the narrow forbidden band gap is 
then t = d/u = 0.3 X 10 9 m/0.37 X 108 m/s = 0.8 X 10-17 s 
= 8 pps. The possible upper limit of oscillation frequency is then 
/max = 1/lOr = 1/(10 ■ 0.08 X 10-17 s) = 1.25 X 1016 Hz = 12.5 
kTHz (kiloterahertz). In terms of the free space wavelength, 
X = c/f= (3 X 108 m/s)/1.25 X 1016 Hz = 24 nm. This is in the 
range of ultraviolet wavelengths [12]. Actually, this device is not 
capable of oscillating at 12.5 kTHz. The reason is that the tunnel 
diode has bulk resistance r and junction capacitance c. Before 
reaching /max, the rc time constant will limit the operating fre­
quency. For the Ge tunnel diode of 50 pm X 50 pm X 10 pm, the 
bulk resistance r is known to be on the order of 1 B and the 
junction capacitance is known to be about 2.7 pF [5]. Then the rc 
time constant is re = 1 Q X 2.7 pF = 2.7 ps, and the frequency 
limit is = l/10rc = 37 GHz. At any rate, if the circuit is 
properly designed, the tunnel diode has a high frequency handling 
capability.
3.2 Diode Current Generated by the Tunnel Effect
Under slightly forward biased conditions, as shown in Fig. 3.1, the 
current is mainly created by the tunnel effect of electrons which 
tunnel through a thin forbidden gap at the junction. Let /C(E) be 
a Fermi distribution function that represents the probability of 
the energy level E being filled throughout the junction. /C(E) 
would lie near the low edge of the conduction band of the n-type 
semiconductor in Fig. 3.1. If pc(E) is the density of states per 
joule of energy band at the level, then /c(E)pc(E) is the available 
number of states at the energy level E per joule of energy band 
for tunneling in the n-type semiconductor. Not all the electrons in 
these states actually tunnel through. In order to tunnel through, 
there must be some empty states in the valence band in the p-type 
semiconductor. If fv(E) represents the probability that energy 
level E is filled throughout the junction in the upper edge of the 
valence band of the p-type semiconductor, then [1 —/V(E)] is 
the probability that the level E is vacant and available for the 
electron to occupy the junction.
Therefore, if pv(E) is the density of states per joule of energy 
band at the energy level E, the number of empty states in the 
valence band of the p-type semiconductor is [1 — /v(E)]pv(E) per 
joule of energy band. Therefore, the number of potentially tunnel­

56 Microwave Tunnel Diodes
able states from the conduction band of the n-type semiconductor 
to the valence band of the p-type semiconductor is [1 — 
/v(£)]pv(£) • /c(£)pc(E) per joule of energy state. If the tunnel­
ing rate is Zcv electrons/s-m2, for infinite availability, then the 
number of electrons actually tunneling through at energy level £ 
is Zcv[l —/v(£)]pv(£) •/c(£)pc(£) electrons/s-m2. Within a 
narrow energy bandwidth d£ near the Fermi energy level, the 
number of electrons actually tunneling through per second is then 
Zcv[l —/v(£)]pv(£)/c(£)pc(£) d£ (electrons/s-m2).
As seen from Fig. 3.1, the tunneling is possible within £c < £ 
< £v, where £c is the bottom of the conduction band of the 
n-type semiconductor, and £v is the top of the valence band of 
the p-type semiconductor. Therefore
/* E
I Xv[l - L(E)]fc(E)pv(E)dE (electrons/s-m2)
is the total number of electrons which tunnel through the junction 
per unit of cross-sectional area. If the total cross section of the 
junction is A (m2), and the magnitude of the charge of the 
electron is q (C), then the tunnel diode current is
rE
Id = qA VZCV[1 - /v(£)]/c(£)pv(£)pc(£) d£ (A) (3.2.1) 
JEC
In this equation, q is known to be 1.603 X 10'19 C. A typical 
junction cross-sectional area for a microwave tunnel diode is 
A = 50 pm X 50 pm = 2500 pm2. In Fig. 3.1, since the electronic 
energy level is relative, a location of zero electron-volt level can be 
chosen. For example, in the case of a degenerate Ge tunnel diode, 
if £c is chosen to be £c = 0 eV, then £v can be about 0.03 eV 
when the diode has a forward bias qV = 0.1 eV. When the 
forward bias qV = 0 eV, as seen in Fig. 3.1, the value 
of £v — £c is greater than in the case of qV = 0.1 eV. Since there 
is no forward bias, the value of Zcv is zero or extremely small. In 
Eq. 3.2.1, the integral is basically an effective electron tunneling 
rate. When qV = 0, the integral range of £c to £v is large, as 
large as 0.15 eV, yet Zcv ~ 0. The value of integral therefore is 
zero. When forward biased to qV = 0.1 eV, the integral range of 
£c to £v decreases to 0.03 eV but the effective tunneling rate or 
the value of the integral in Eq. 3.2.1 increases due to the increase 
in value of ZCv. In a typical microwave Ge tunnel diode of 
junction area of 2500 pm2, the diode current is on the order of

= 2.5 X 1024 electrons/s-m2.
This is 2.5 X 1015 electrons/ns-m2 or 2.5 X 1012 electrons/ps-m2. 
Since the actual junction area is A = 2500 X 10 12 m, the actual 
tunneling rate across the junction is 2.5 X 1024 electrons/s-m2 X 
2500 X 10“12 m2 = 6.25 X 109 electrons/s. For example, in a Ge 
tunnel diode, when the bias qV = 0, Ev — Ec ~ 0.15 eV. When 
qV increases, £v — Ec decreases as seen from Fig. 3.1, but Zcv 
increases. As a result, the tunnel current increases until qV = 
0.08 eV, reaching Id = 5 mA [5]. Beyond this point Ev — Ec gets 
smaller and smaller and for this reason, Zcv gets smaller. Tunnel­
ing is possible only through the range of Ec and Ev.
When qV ~ 0.15 eV, both Ec and £v line up, or Ev — Ec = 0. 
At this point Zcv is getting small as is Id. Id is decreased as low as 
2.5 mA [5], If qV is further increased, then Ec > Ev. By the time 
qV reaches 0.3 eV, Zcv is zero and tunneling ceases. From this 
point on, the transition of electrons from the conduction band of 
the n-type Ge to the conduction band of the p-type Ge gets 
started with small probability. This current created by conduction 
band-to-conduction band transfer is called the drift current. 
Therefore, with a value of qV = 0.3 eV, the tunnel current stops, 
and drift current starts to flow. At this point, Id is as small as 
1 mA [5], As qV is increased further, the transition probability 
increases and the drift current increases.
When reverse biased, £v > Ec always. If \qV\ increases, £v — 
Ec increases. So does Zcv. The tunnel current increases in the 
reverse direction as reverse bias {qlA increases. Further investiga­
tion of the integrand in Eq. 3.2.1 is presented in the next section.
3.3 Concept of Negative Resistance
In Eq. 3.2.1, the energy level of a tunneling electron, E, is 
Ec < E < £v, as seen from Fig. 3.1. When the diode is forward 
biased V volts, raising £F with respect to EF decreases the value 

58 Microwave Tunnel Diodes
of (Ev — Ec). At a certain bias voltage V = Vv, Ec becomes equal 
to Ev, and the integral Eq. 3.2.1, or the tunnel current, becomes 
zero. Therefore (Ev — Ec) is determined by the bias voltage under 
the biased condition, and the diode current Zd is also deter­
mined by the bias voltage. In the tunnel diode studied in Section 
3.2, the tunnel current is zero at qVv = 0.3 eV. This suggests that 
(Ev - EFp) + (EFn - Ec) = 0.3 eV.
It is an accepted assumption that

Under the forward biased condition in Fig. 3.1, noting that V is 
negative,
Ev = Ec = (EFn - Ec) + qV+ (Ev - EFp). (3.3.7)
Note in this equation that when qV = 0, EF = EF and Ev — Ec 
— {E^ — Ec) + (Ev — Ep) is verified. The value” of (Ev — Ec) 
decreases when qV is negative or forward biased. The value of 
(Ev — Ec) increases when qV is positive or reverse biased. Let the

If Eq. 3.3.11 is numerically integrated for a specific tunnel 
diode, then the current-voltage characteristics, or the relation 
between the diode current and the bias voltage, is generally found 
to be a curve represented by a solid line shown in Fig. 3.2. When 
the bias voltage is zero, the tunneling rate is zero, and so is the 
diode current. At V = Vv, Ec = Ev, the integral of Eq. 3.2.1 will 
be zero, as is the diode current. Beyond V > Vv, Eq. 3.2.1 loses its 
meaning and does not apply. Beyond this point, there will be no 
more tunnel current and the drift current due to electron

current Iv is indicated by the solid curve. The drift current is indicated by 
the dashed curve.

transition from the conduction band of the n-type semiconductor 
to the conduction band of the p-type semiconductor takes over. 
This situation is indicated in Fig. 3.2 by a dashed line. The Ge 
tunnel diode chip of 50 jim X 50 jim is studied in Section 3.2, 
Vv = 0.3 V with Id = 1 mA. The peak current of Id = 6 mA is 
reached with the forward bias voltage Vp = 0.08 V [5],
When the bias voltage is reversed, as seen in Fig. 3.2 and Eq. 
3.3.6, the value of Ev — Ec gets larger than qV gets larger as seen 
in Fig. 3.2. Therefore the tunnel current increases in reverse 
direction as the reverse bias qV increases.
Between the two zeros of the tunnel current, the tunnel 
current reaches its peak at V = Fp. In a range of Fp < V < Vv, 
did
— < 0 
(3.3.12)
If the differential conductance is represented by gt, then
d/d
gt= — <0 
(3.3.13)
When a tunnel diode is operated as an amplifier or an oscillator, 
the bias voltage is always
Vp<V<Vv 
(3.3.14)
and the differential conductance of the diode is always negative. 
When a microwave signal is superimposed on the de bias voltage 
V, the bias voltage is perturbed by the microwave voltage AF, and 
the diode current is perturbed by A/. Therefore the microwave 
signals interact with the differential negative conductance gt = 
A//AF, which is negative. At this point, it should be noted that 
the static conductance G = I/V is always positive no matter what 
the voltage is. For example, in the Ge tunnel diode presented 
earlier, the maximum gt = A//AF occurred at the bias voltage 
FB = 0.12 V with the bias current 7B = 2.5 mA [5], At this point, 
gt = A//AF = —3 mA/0.30 V = -100 mS and G\ = 7B/FB = 
2.5 mA/0.12 V = 21 mS.
3.4 Dynamic Negative Conductance
The differential conductance gt contrasts with the static conduc­
tance Gt. The differential conductance gt is termed the dynamic 
negative conductance with respect to microwave signals for the 
bias voltage within a range of Fp < V < Vv. After being properly

operating at microwave frequency.
biased, only gt becomes important for interaction with microwave 
signals. The microwave load is connected in parallel to the tunnel 
diode as shown in Fig. 3.3. Usually both the tunnel diode and the 
load are not purely conductive. There are some susceptances: Bt 
for the diode and BL for the load. For best results, BL is usually 
adjusted to tune out Bt.
BL + Bt = 0 or BL = —Bt 
(3.4.1)
Under this condition, the law of conservation of energy at equilib­
rium requires that
IgtIK2 + |gLK>2 = SlK,2 
(3-4.2)
where Vo is the microwave voltage across the diode as shown in 
Fig. 3.3. The first term is the power generated by the negative 
conductance gt. Since gt is negative, it generates microwave 
power instead of consuming power [6]. The term gLVo2 is the 
microwave output power to the load gL. Then gLV°/A, where A 
is the power gain, is the input power to the amplifier. Eq. 3.4.2 
states that, after tuning out the susceptances, the sum of the 
power generated by the dynamic negative conductance gt and the 
input microwave power is equal to the microwave power con­
sumed by the load conductance gL. Then, solving Eq. 3.4.2 for the 
power gain A,
A = gL - 
(3.4.3)
gL - Igtl
It should be noted that gt is a negative quantity. If gL is adjusted 
so that
gL ~ Igtl = 0 
(3-4.4)
with the condition from Eq. 3.4.1, then
A —» oo 
(3-4.5)
This is an oscillator.
In practical tunnel diode oscillators, both Eqs. 3.4.1 and 3.4.4 
are complicated functions of the operating frequency. They are 
usually transcendental equations of the operating frequency w.

62 Microwave Tunnel Diodes
The simultaneous solution of both Eqs. 3.4.1 and 3.4.4 for the 
operating frequency is the oscillation frequency [7,10].
For example, with regard to the microwave Ge tunnel diode 
studied in Section 3.3, gt = —100 mS. For oscillation, the load 
conductance gL = — gt = 100 mS, or the shunt load resistance 
across the diode is 10 S. The tunnel diode is generally a low 
impedance device. In Eq. 3.4.4, if gL — |gt| = 1 mS, then from 
Eq. 3.4.3, the power gain A = gL/(gL — |gt|) = 100 mS/1 mS = 
100 or 20 dB.
Generally, a microwave tunnel diode chip is packaged. If an 
equivalent tunnel diode capacitance, including the package capaci­
tance and the junction capacitance, is Ct = 5 pF, then the admit­
tance at 10 GHz is = wCt = 2it X 10 X 109 X 5 X 10 12 = 
0.314 S. So, to meet one of the oscillation conditions in Eq. 3.4.1, 
the load susceptance must be inductive. BL = 1/wLl = Bt = 
wCt = 0.314 S. Then Ll = 
= 1/(2t7 X 10 X 109 X
0.314) = 51 X 10 12 H = 51 pH. This small shunt inductance is 
difficult, if not impossible, to obtain in a lumped circuit compo­
nent. However, when the diode is mounted on a distribution 
parameter circuit such as a waveguide, a coaxial line, or a micro­
stripline, realization of small equivalent inductance is not so 
difficult [6,7],
For example, if the packaged tunnel diode is mounted on a 
microstripline of characteristic impedance Zo = 50 ohms, the 
characteristic admittance is then Yo = 1 /Zo = 1 /50 == 0.02 S. The 
normalized susceptance 
to be realized is therefore =
BL/To = 0.314/0.02 = 15.7. If the open microstripline has a 
length /, then 5L = tan(27r//Xz) or (//Xz) = (l/27r)tan"1 5L = 
(1 /2tt)tan ’15.7 = 0.24. This means that the package capaci­
tance of the tunnel diode can be tuned out by attaching a 0.24 
wavelength microstripline. At 10 GHz, the free space wavelength 
is 3 cm. So 0.24 wavelength is 7.2 mm in free space. If the 
microstripline is formed on a ceramic substrate of er = 4, then the 
effective transmission line wavelength gets shorter and Xz ® 
XO/^=XO/2 = 15 mm. This means that 0.24 wavelength is 
3.6 mm. At any rate, it is not difficult to realize one of the 
oscillation conditions in Eq. 3.4.1 using a distribution parameter 
approach.
3.5 Diode Packaging and Equivalent Circuit
Tunnel diodes operating at microwave frequencies are packaged in 
various configurations [13]. Only two representative configurations

configuration. C. Drop-in type package. D. Equivalent circuit.
are shown in Fig. 3.4. These configurations are pill type packag­
ing, Fig. 3.4 A, and the drop-in type packaging, Fig. 3.4 C. The 
pill type packages are used primarily for the cavity, waveguide, 
coaxial line, and microstripline applications. The drop-in type 
packages are for microstriplines. In this chapter, the packaged 
tunnel diodes are discussed, but the same configurations are used 
for various types of microwave diodes which will be presented in 
the following chapters. The microwave diodes include Gunn 
diodes,IMPATT diodes, Schottky barrier diodes, and PIN diodes.
A cross-sectional view of a pill type packaged tunnel diode is 
shown in Fig. 3.4 A. A tunnel diode chip of approximately 50 gm 
diameter and 10 gm thick is mounted between the upside-down 
metallic post and a gold wire mesh. The disk-shaped p+-n + 
junction tunnel diode wafer is enlarged in Fig. 3.4 A. The gold 
wire mesh is bonded to the n+ side of the tunnel diode chip. The 
wire mesh protects the diode chip from excessive mechanical 
pressure and accidental shock. The gold wire mesh is bonded on a 
metallic washer such as Kovar, and the washer is bonded to the 
bottom metallic disk. The top disk -post metallic structure is 
therefore for the p-side of the diode and the bottom metallic disk 
is for the n-side of the diode. The p-electrode and the n-washer are 
separated by an insulating ceramic cylinder as shown in 
Fig. 3.4 A.

64 Microwave Tunnel Diodes
Though the diode chip can be as small as 50 /zm in diameter 
and 10 /zm thick, the pill type packaged tunnel diode can be 
1300-3230 /zm in diameter and 1020-2460 /im in height [13],
The diode chip can be a planar structure as shown in Fig. 
3.4 B. This type of chip can also be 50 /zm X 50 /zm and 10 /zm 
thick, yet the active part can be as small as 10 /zm X 10 /zm.
Both the disk type diode chip and the planar diode chip can 
be packaged in a drop-in type package as shown in Fig. 3.4 C. The 
dotted side of the lead microstrip is the anode. This type of 
package can be 2390-2590 /zm in diameter and 790-1120 /zm 
thick [13],
As seen from these diode chip mounting configurations, the 
packaging is designed to minimize stray inductance and capaci­
tance so that the diodes can be used at high microwave fre­
quencies. A widely accepted equivalent circuit of a packaged 
microwave diode is shown in Fig. 3.4 D. In this figure, Rs is the 
series resistance which includes the resistance of the bulk parts of 
the semiconductor (also called the spreading resistance of the 
semiconductor) and the ohmic resistance of the metallic leading 
conductor in series with the diode chip. Ls is the lead inductance. 
R j is the junction resistance and Cj is the junction capacitance. 
CP is the package capacitance. Theoretically Ls, which is the 
inductance associated with the packaging of the diode chip, is in 
series with Rs and should be considered. Yet in reality, the 
inductive reactance associated with Ls is usually negligibly small 
in comparison with the rest of the impedance. It is therefore often 
omitted.
In most activated tunnel diodes, Rs is on the order of 1 fi, Ls 
is on the order of 10“12 H, Rj is the differential negative 
resistance on the order of 10 fi, Cj is on the order of 10-1 pF, and 
CP is on the order of 1 pF. Tunnel diodes are generally considered 
low impedance devices.
The input impedance of the equivalent circuit of a microwave 
diode as shown in Fig. 3.4 D is

The frequency at which the real part of Z becomes zero is called 
the resistive cutoff frequency, /sc = o>sc/2tt. When < o>sc, then 
ReZ < 0. The packaged tunnel diode is a negative resistance 
device. When > o>sc, then Re Z > 0. The packaged tunnel diode 
is no longer a negative resistance device in these frequencies.
So, letting Re Z = 0 and solving for o>,

Note that Rj < 0 in an activated tunnel diode.
It is of interest to know that both CP, the package capacitance, 
and Ls, the lead inductance, do not contribute to the resistive 
cutoff frequency. For example, a typical 10 GHz range tunnel 
diode [7-10] has -R} = 65 fl, Ls = 25 X 10 12 H, C, = 0.9 X 
10 12 F and Rs = 3.5 fl. Substituting these parameters in Eq. 
3.5.4, the resistive cutoff frequency /sc = gjsc/2t7 = 11.35 GHz. 
Even if the tunnel diode has a potentially high operating fre­
quency, as calculated from the tunneling electron transit time 
across the junction, the reality is that the packaging and bulk 
semiconductor parameters Rs and Cj control the resistive cutoff 
frequency together with R}.
A frequency at which the imaginary part of Z becomes zero is 
termed the self-resonance frequency of the diode. In Eq. 3.5.1, 
solving Im Z — 0 for o>, it is found that
cp(r2t + X2)

This is actually a transcendental equation because both XT and 
Rt are functions of o>sr. Nonetheless, it clearly shows that the 
larger the CP, the lower the o>sr.

For a typical 10 GHz tunnel diode of — Rs = 65 fl, Ls = 25 pH

capacitance is found to be fSI = 
= 19.79 GHz.

The condition of Re Y = 0 (when the input conductance is zero) is 
fulfilled by RT = 0. Therefore, the resistive cutoff frequency 
Eq. 3.5.4 also represents the conductive cutoff frequency. The 
condition Im Y = 0 results in the same conclusion as shown in 
Eqs. 3.5.5 and 3.5.6. The susceptive resonance frequency is there­
fore equal to the reactive self-resonance frequency Eq. 3.5.6.
3.6 Microstripline Circuit
A schematic diagram of a microwave tunnel diode amplifier 
oscillator using a microstripline configuration is shown in Fig. 3.5. 
A pill type packaged tunnel diode is mounted at a point one 
half-wavelength away from an open end of the stripline. At this 
point, transmission line theory states that the impedance of the 
stripline itself is infinity when viewed toward the open end. The de 
bias to the diode is brought in through a bias feeder line of one 
quarter-wavelength, which is connected at a point one quarter­
wavelength from the open end on the main microstripline. At this 
point, the impedance is zero. The quarter-wavelength de bias

feeder line acts as a radio frequency choke along with the capaci­
tor tab, which presents a capacitive short to the ground plane and 
a bonding tab for the biasing lead wire.
Microwave signals are fed from the coaxial input to the 
microstripline at left in Fig. 3.5. The line length lY and l2 are 
adjusted to satisfy the impedance matching as indicated in both 
Eqs. 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 [6], The incident signals are amplified and 
taken out from the same place as entered. The negative resistance 
amplifier is essentially a one-port amplifier. The input port and 
the output port are identical. Both and l2 may be adjusted to 
satisfy Eq. 3.4.4 and Eq. 3.4.1. Then it functions as an oscillator.
Since the diode is the negative impedance device, a negative 
impedance ZN is presented at the junction of the collinear micro­
stripline and the impedance-matching strip of length l2 in Fig. 3.5. 
If the characteristic impedance of the collinear microstripline is 
Zo, the voltage reflection coefficient p at the junction is, according 
to transmission line theory, given by
. ZL - Z( 
p = ~--------
zL + z(
(3.6.1)
Note that ZL is negative [6,10], The voltage reflection coefficient p 
is, by definition, the ratio of reflected voltage to the incident 
voltage. In this case, the reflected voltage is the output voltage Vo, 
and the incident voltage is the input voltage V\. Therefore,

Then Av = (-51 - 50)/( — 51 + 50) = 101 = 201og10101 dB ® 
40 dB. If 7?n = — 50 fi, then Av = oo. This is the condition for 
oscillation.
If Eq. 3.6.5 is solved for RL, then

Rl = —50(10 + l)/(10 — 1) = —61.1 for negative resistance 
must be created at the input of the amplifier.
As seen from Fig. 3.5, the size of the entire circuit board is at 
most Xz/2 X Xz/2. For example, at 10 GHz, the free space 
wavelength is Xo = c/f = 3 X 108 m/s/10 X 109 Hz = 30 mm. 
For example, if an alumina or a ceramic substrate is used for the 
circuit board, the relative permittivity of the commercial substrate 
is er = 4.5-10 [15]. Then the wavelength in the dielectric shrinks 
to XZ = XO/^. If er = 4.5 then Xz = Xo/ 1/4.5 = XO/2.12. If 
er = 10, then Xz = Xo//W = XO/3.16. Therefore, for f = 10 GHz 
and Xo = 30 mm, Xz = 14.15 mm for er = 4.5 substrates and 
Xz = 9.49 mm for er = 10 substates. The size of the entire circuit 
board is then 21.75 mm X 21.75 mm for er = 4.5 substrates and 
14.24 mm X 14.24 mm for er = 10 substrates. The thickness of the 
commercial circuit board is 250-1250 p.m [14], A similar circuit 
can be monolithically developed on a Si or GaAs substrate.
The negative resistance diode amplifier described above can be 
made into an oscillator simply by changing the bias voltage to the 
diode. If the diode is biased so that 7?N = Zo, then, as seen from 
Eq. 3.6.5, Av oo and the circuit becomes an oscillator.
3.7 Waveguide Circuit
A waveguide circuit utilizing a microwave tunnel diode package is 
schematically sketched in Fig. 3.6. The impedance is matched to 
satisfy Eq. 3.4.1, 3.4.2, or 3.4.4 by adjusting distance /1? /2, and the 
screw penetration depth into the waveguide. The input microwave 
signals are fed into the waveguide opening, and the amplified 
output is taken out from the same port. The de bias supply is fed 
through a coaxial connector. The design and operating principles 
of this waveguide amplifier are exactly the same as the microstrip 
version described in Section 3.6. The amplifier circuit can be used 
as an oscillator simply by changing the bias voltage [15]. For

example, in Fig. 3.6 at 10 GHz, the internal dimension of the 
rectangular waveguide cross section is a X b = 22.9 mm X 11.45 
mm, where a is the width and b is the height of the waveguide. 
The waveguide wavelength Xg is calculated to be
(3.7.1)
where Ao is the free space wavelength. For f = 10 GHz, Ao = c/f 
= (3 X 108 m/s)/10 X 109 Hz = 3 cm, substituting Ao = 3 cm 
and a = 2.29 cm in Eq. 3.7.1, then Ag = 4 cm. The length of the 
waveguide structure is at most one waveguide wavelength, 4 cm in 
this case. According to waveguide theory, the waveguide imped­
ance is several hundred Ohms [6,20]. The tunnel diode impedance 
is on the order of several ten Ohms. Also, the low impedance 
point in a rectangular waveguide is located at an off-center posi­
tion as shown in Fig. 3.6. The posts mounted at this location 
reduce the impedance further. At this point, a pill type packaged 
tunnel diode is mounted. The input impedance of the tunnel diode 
mounted waveguide is adjusted by the penetration length of the 
tuning screw protruding into the waveguide as shown in Fig. 3.6.
3.8 Tunnel Effect Microwave Amplification, Oscillation, Detection, 
Mixing, and Harmonic Generation
Tunnel diodes are made of Ge, Si, or GaAs. Usually Vv is less 
than 1.0 V. Both low voltage and low noise operations are

possible. Because of low working voltages, high power operations 
cannot be expected. The transit time of the tunnel effect is much 
less than the electron transit time due to the drifting or diffusing 
of electrons. Therefore the high frequency limit of a tunnel diode 
itself exceeds comparable electron devices based on drift elec­
trons, yet the associated circuit parameters prevent the realization 
of high frequency goals [7], In summary, the tunnel effect creates 
negative conductance and the negative conductance amplifies 
microwaves. When the negative impedance of the diode equals the 
positive impedance of the circuit in magnitude, the diode goes into 
oscillation.
As seen in Fig. 3.2, the current-voltage curves of tunnel 
diodes are, in general, highly nonlinear [16-20], Nonlinear devices 
are useful for microwave detection (Chapter 7), mixing (Chapter 
8), and harmonic generation (Chapter 10) [21],

Microwave Avalanche Diodes
4.1 Avalanche Effect
In a depletion region of a reverse biased p-n junction, there will 
be a high field due to a high voltage drop across the depletion 
layer. Since there are not many charge carriers in the carrier 
depletion region, the resistivity of this region is higher than in the 
bulk portions of the semiconductors. Most of the applied reverse 
voltage will appear across the depletion region. When the reverse 
bias voltage increases to a certain point, the speed of residual 
electrons in the depletion region produces enough kinetic energy 
to ionize a neutral atom, thus producing a pair of electrons and a 
hole. The newly generated electron will be accelerated and collide 
with another neutral atom to produce another electron hole pair. 
This process repeats itself rapidly, and a large number of carriers 
is suddenly created when the reverse bias voltage reaches a certain 
voltage, which is determined by the ionization potential of the 
atoms of the semiconductor material. This rapid production of 
electron-hole pairs by multiple impact ionization is termed the 
avalanche effect. The production and multiplication of carrier 
electrons in the depletion region resembles an avalanche in the 
snow covered mountains.
When the avalanche effect takes place, there will be a sudden 
burst of reverse current as shown in Fig. 4.1 A for a certain reverse 
bias voltage FB. This voltage is termed the avalanche breakdown 
voltage. Depending on the ionization multiplication factor of the

material, if the carriers are rapidly multiplied and suddenly pro­
duce a large current, due to the finite resistance of biasing cir­
cuitry, the diode terminal voltage drops, as shown in Fig. 4.1 B. 
The avalanche effect current increases, but the terminal voltage 
drops in spite of an increase in the reverse bias electromotive 
force. If the reverse bias electromotive force is further increased, 
the depletion region gets wider due to the high resistivity of the 
depletion region. The ionization multiplication factor begins to 
saturate and the bias voltage begins to increase again with the 
steady increase of current, as seen from Fig. 4.1 B. The current­

4.2 Avalanche Effect Current 75
voltage curve of Fig. 4.1 B is in great contrast to the current-volt­
age curve for tunnel diodes shown in Fig. 3.2. Both the tunnel 
diode and the avalanche diode of Fig. 4.1 B have a negative 
differential conductance or negative dynamic conductance. How­
ever, the negative dynamic conductance of the tunnel diode is 
controlled by the bias voltage. The negative dynamic conductance 
of the avalanche diode is controlled by the current. The tunnel 
diode is therefore termed a voltage controlled device, and the 
avalanche diode is termed a current controlled device.
In microwave electronics, characteristics shown in Fig. 4.1 A 
are desirable for microwave switching or momental carrier injec­
tion or generation. The characteristics shown in Fig. 4.1 B are 
suited for microwave amplification and oscillation by the use of 
negative conductance, as in the case of the microwave tunnel 
diode amplifiers and oscillators. An avalanche diode with charac­
teristics shown in Fig. 4.1 A with a sharp “knee” is known as a 
Zener diode. It is widely used in voltage regulator circuits and 
clipper circuits.
4.2 Avalanche Effect Current
When a p-n junction diode is reverse biased, the reverse current 
due to the drifting of residual carriers in the depletion layer is 
given by
I = 7O(1 - e~qV/*T) 
(4.2.1)
where
q is the magnitude of electronic charge 1.6 X IO’19 C;
V is the magnitude of reverse bias voltage across the junction, in 
volts;
k is the Boltzmann constant 1.38044 X 10“23 J/K;
T is the absolute temperature of the junction K; and
Io is the magnitude of the reverse saturation current, in amps 
[1-4].
The reverse saturation current Io is related to the device parame­
ter as follows
[ -D Pno Dnnpo 
•si \ i t.
In this equation,
Lp is the hole diffusion length into the n-type region at the 
junction, in meters;

76 Microwave Avalanche Diodes
Ln is the electron diffusion length into the p-type region at the 
junction, in meters;
Dp is the hole diffusion constant in the n-type region, in m2/sec; 
Dn is the electron diffusion constant in the p-type region, in 
m2/sec;
pno is the hole density in the n-region of the junction under 
equilibrium condition, in m 3; and
npo is the electron density in the p-region of the junction under 
equilibrium condition, in m-3 [2],
The reverse current expressed by Eq. 4.2.1 is correct only if the 
diode voltage is far less than the avalanche breakdown voltage Vs. 
Near the avalanche breakdown voltage Vs, the carrier electrons 
multiply by impact ionization multiplication. Just before impact 
ionization multiplication sets in, the reverse current is usually 
saturated, and it is approximately Io. If the width of the depletion 
layer is w at the avalanche breakdown voltage EB, and if an 
original number of electrons is to be multiplied to N times the 
number of original electrons at the end of the traverse, then
N = a(E)dx 
(4.2.3)
•'o
where x is the one dimensional coordinate in the direction parallel 
to the electric field, and a( V) is McKay’s ionization rate per unit 
distance and is a function of the bias voltage V [5],
The magnitude of the reverse current under the avalanche 
breakdown is then
I(1-N) = IO
(4-2.4)
or
1=-^.

Therefore when N -■> 1,

This is the avalanche breakdown. Substituting Eq. 4.2.3 in
Eq. 4.2.4
I = ------------------------ (4.2.7)

Note that the width of the depletion layer is also a function of the 
bias voltage V.

4.2 Avalanche Effect Current 77
In Eq. 4.2.7,

1 - / a(V)dx 
Jo
M is termed the avalanche multiplication factor. If the integral 
Eq. 4.2.7 is numerically integrated, the current-voltage curve as 
shown in Fig. 4.1 will be obtained.
The voltage across the reverse biased diode, V, is related to the 
biasing electromotive force EB and a combination of the load 
resistance and the bulk resistance R by
V=EB-IR 
(4.2.9)
For a proper value of R, a sudden increase of current makes the 
voltage across the diode drop suddenly, creating the current-volt­
age characteristic curve as shown in Fig. 4.1 B. The characteristic 
curve is determined by the McKay’s ionization rate a and the 
external resistance R.
For example, if the reverse saturation current of a microwave 
avalanche diode is Io = 100 pA, and it started breakdown at 
V = 15 V with reverse current of I = 1000 pA, then from 
Eq. 4.2.4, N = (7 - Io)/I = [-1000 pA - (-100 pA)]/- 1000 
pA = 0.9.
At VB = —15 V, if w = 5 pm, then according to Eq. 4.2.3, 
0.9 = Jowa(-15 V)dx = a(-15 V)w = a(-15 V) • 5 pm. In this 
example, McKay’s ionization rate per micrometer is therefore 
a( —15 V) = 0.9/5 pm = 0.18 pm1.
The avalanche breakdown voltage EB depends on donor con­
centration on the n-side. Generally, the more donors, the lower 
the breakdown voltage. If 1/ = —15 V, then for Ge, Nd ~ 2.5 X 
1016 cm 3; for Si, Nd ~ 7 X 1016 cm 3; and for GaAs, Nd ~ 1.5 
X 10l7cm 3 [6],
Combining Eqs. 4.2.7 and 4.2.8, I = MIO. Therefore M = 
I/Io. In this example, M = —1000 pA/ — 100 pA = 10. The 
avalanche multiplication factor is the ratio of the reverse current I 
to the reverse saturation current Io.
In this example, the bias circuit has an internal resistance of 
50 fi, including the bulk resistance, contact resistance, and lead 
resistance of the avalanche diode. If the diode does not break 
down at EB = —14.9 V, then the terminal voltage across the 
junction is, using Eq. 4.2.9, V = EB — IR = —14.9 V - (—100 X 
10 6 A • 50 fi) = —14.9 V. If the diode breaks down at EB = 
— 15.1 V and I = 60 mA, using Eq. 4.2.9, V = EB — IR = 

78 Microwave Avalanche Diodes
-15.1 V - (-60 X 10 3 A • 50 fi) = -12.1 V. So, the magni­
tude of voltage across the junction decreases after sufficient break­
down. The more avalanche current, the lower the voltage across 
the diode, as shown in Fig. 4.1 B. In this example, the avalanche 
multiplication factor is M = I/Io = — 60 X 10~3 A/— 100 X 
10 6 A = 600, and the N number is N = (I — Io)/I = [ — 60,000 p.A 
-(-100 mA)]/- 60,000 mA = 59,900 mA/60,000 mA = 0.9983. 
McKay’s ionization rate per micrometer in this example is a( —12.1 
V) = N/w = 0.9983/5 m™ = 0.1997 /im’1.
An alternative empirical expression for the avalanche multipli­
cation factor is
1
M = ------ ----------
1 - (k/kb)
(4.2.10)
This is valid only if |K| < |FB| and n = 3 to 6, depending on the 
semiconductor, where FB is the beginning voltage of substantial 
breakdown [6]. Equation 4.2.10 is therefore useful for an avalanche 
diode as in Fig. 4.1 A or before substantial breakdown of the 
avalanche diode of Fig. 4.1 B. After a substantial breakdown of 
the diode of Fig. 4.1 B, Eq. 4.2.10 does not apply.
Solving Eq. 4.2.10 for (K/KB),
(4.2.11)
V =
(4.2.12)
If n = 4, M = 10 and FB = -15 V, then V = -14.6 V. If 
n = 4, M = 600 and kB = -15 V, then V = -14.994 V.
At any rate, Eq. 4.2.10 describes proximity to V = FB and 
V < VB for the first time.
After V = VB and beyond, Eqs. 4.2.7, 4.2.8, and 4.2.9 take 
over, though these equations are valid even when V < VB for the 
first time.
After all atoms are ionized, then the junction reaches a satura­
tion resistance of R3. The avalanche diode current is, using 
Eq. 4.2.9,

If AU > 0, then A/ > 0. This is the reason that the 
current-voltage curve of Fig. 4.1 B bends back after reaching a 
point (Uv, 7V).
The avalanche diode of this example carries 15 V across a 
5-jam wide depletion region. This means that the electric field 
across the depletion region is E = 15 V/5 X10-6 m = 3 X 106 
V/m = 30 kV/cm = 3 V/jam. It is of interest to note that the 
same field strength appears with different impressions depending 
on the unit employed.

60,000 pA/12.1 V = 0.00496 S. In terms of resistances, the 
incremental resistance of the diode is ra = l/ga = —47.6 
7?B =
1/Gb = 75 kfi, and Rv = 1/GV = 201.6 fi.
Equation 4.3.3 is analogous to Eq. 3.3.13 for tunnel diodes. 
Therefore, the principles of microwave amplification and oscilla­
tion and the concept of dynamic negative conductance for tunnel 
diodes are also applicable to avalanche diodes.
4.4 Further Application of the Avalanche Effect
Though the principles of amplification and oscillation of avalanche 
effect diodes are the same as the ones with the tunnel diode as far 
as the application of the negative conductance is concerned, the 
mechanism for producing the negative conductance is quite dif­
ferent as studied in previous sections. The avalanche effect re­
quires at least one order of magnitude, and generally more orders 
of magnitude, of the bias voltage than tunnel diodes. The avalanche 
effect relies on impact ionization multiplication. This tends to 
generate a greater amount of noise than the tunnel effect. The 
avalanche effect takes more time than the tunnel effect. This will 
affect extremely high frequency operation in the microwave fre­
quency range. The direct application of dynamic negative conduc­

Problems 81
tance in the area of amplification and oscillation is therefore not 
as popular compared to the tunnel diodes.
The avalanche effect, however, provides a useful carrier injec­
tion mechanism [7] for the IMPATT diode which will be studied 
in Chapter 6. The avalanche effect also provides an effective 
nondestructive microwave short circuit to the microwave transmis­
sion line when it is properly mounted and operated [8,9], This is 
useful for microwave diplexing, which will be studied in Chapter 
10.

5.1 Electron Energy Transfer within Conduction Bands
This chapter is about Gunn diodes. The original Gunn diode was 
a simple bulk n-type GaAs semiconductor with metallic ohmic 
contacts at both ends [1], In this bulk n-type semiconductor, when 
the minimum available total electron energy e is plotted against 
the wave number k of the wave function xp of the Schrodinger 
equation, the plot takes various forms, depending on the material. 
Even with respect to similar materials, the plot takes a variety of 
forms depending on the direction of the wave vector k. In n-type 
GaAs, for example, the wave vector k is placed parallel to the 
crystallographic axis [100] (Appendix 4); the total energy e versus 
the wave number k curve looks like Fig. 5.1 [2,3,6,8,13,14], Ac­
cording to quantum theory, the wave number is proportional to 
the momentum p by the following relation

where h is Planck’s constant, 6.6256 X 10 34 J-s [2], The wave 
vector k is in the direction of propagation of the wave function xp, 
which is the solution of Schrodinger’s equation [4], The wave of 
wave function xp is the de Broglie wave; it is not the photon wave

the one shown in Fig. 5.1, the applied electric field which acceler­
ates electrons in the n-type GaAs crystal must therefore be paral­
lel to the [100] crystallographic axis. Since the wave number is 
proportional to the momentum, some people call the energy-wave 
number diagram the energy-momentum diagram, even though it 
is the e-K diagram.
Wave number k is the same as the phase constant 2tt/X in 
electromagnetic field theory except that X is not the wavelength of 
electromagnetic waves but the wavelength of de Broglie waves. A 
de Broglie wave is a wave function ip which is a solution of 
Schrodinger’s equation. The units of k are radians/meter. A 
particle of total energy e can be considered a de Broglie wave of 
wavelength X. If the particle’s mass is m (kg), the velocity is u 
(m/s), and the total energy W (J) is kinetic energy, then the 
momentum p is

p2 = (mu) = 2m ■ —mu2 = 2mW
The saturation velocity of an electron of nondegenerate n-type 
GaAs is known to be u = 100 km/s [6,8,12,14], Then p = mu =

9.11 X 10 31 kg X 100 X 103 m/s = 9.11 X 10 26 kg-m/s. 
Therefore, from Eq. 5.1.1, the wave number k = 2ir p/h = 2ir X 
9.11 X 10“26 kg-m/s/6.6256 X 10“34 J-s = 8.64 X 108 rad/m. 
This means that the de Broglie wave of an electron with momen­
tum p = 9.11 X 10“26 kg-m/s and energy W = p2/2m = 
(9.11 X 10“26 kg-m/s)2/(2 X 9.11 X 10“31 kg) = 4.55 X 10“21 J 
has the de Broglie wavelength of X = 2tt/k = 2ir rad/8.64 X 
108 rad/m = 0.727 X 10“8 m = 7.27 nm. This is the wavelength 
of the wave function ip, not the wavelength of electromagnetic 
radiation from the moving electron nor the oscillation wavelength 
of the Gunn diode.
Starting with zero applied electric field, if an electron occupies 
the bottom of the lower conduction band in Fig. 5.1, it will 
gradually rise; it will gain kinetic energy as the applied electric 
field is increased. If the additional energy due to the applied 
electric field exceeds 0.35 eV, the electron will transfer to the 
upper conduction band. When this transfer occurs, the following 
things accompany the transfer.
1. The mass of the electron increases. If the mass of an electron in 
the lower conduction band is mL, and the mass of an electron 
in the upper conduction band is mu,
mu ~ 17mL = 1.2mo 
(5.1.2)
where mo is the static mass of the electron [3],
2. The mobility of the electron decreases. As seen above from 
Eq. 5.1.2,
mL ~ 0.07mo; 
(5.1.3)
the mobility of the electrons in the lower conduction band /j.l 
is
where wdL is the drift velocity of electrons in the lower conduc­
tion band in m/s; wdu is the drift velocity of electrons in the 
upper conduction band; E is the applied electric field strength 
in V/m. The theoretical values of pu = 0.010-0.018 m2/V-s 
and = 0.5-0.8 m2/V-s are reported [6,8,13],
3. The electron velocity slows down in the upper conduction 
band.
Mdu < MdL 
(5.1.5)

For example, if the actual electron transit time across the bulk 
portion of the Gunn diode is t s, then the oscillation frequency / 
must be f = 1/t. If the device length is d, and the saturation 
velocity of the electron in the nondegenerate n-type GaAs is 
us = 100 km/s, then t = d/us, f = us/d and therefore d = us/f. 
If f= 10.525 GHz then d = 100 X 103 m/s/10.525 X 109/s = 
9.5 X 10 6 m = 9.5 jam. If the bias voltage is V = 8 V, then the 
electric field strength E must be E = V/d = 8 V/9.5 X 10 6 m = 
0.842 X 106 V/m = 8.42 kV/cm = 842 V/mm. Now if us = udu, 
then the mobility of electrons in the upper conduction band is
= udu/E = 100 X 103 m/s/0.842 X 106 V/m = 0.119 m2/F-s.
According to Eqs. 5.1.2 and 5.1.3, even if the same kinetic 
energy W is given to the electron in the lower conduction band as 
in the upper conduction band, then

According to published theory, E^/Eu can be as low as 0.1 
[6,8,13], This argument fails when E^/Eu is too small. If E^/Eu 
is too small, then Eq. 5.1.6 does not apply and therefore Eq. 5.1.7 
does not apply either. What is of importance is the fact that the 
mobility of the low field electron is greater than the mobility of 
the electron in the high field region. Now, according to Eq. 5.1.7, 
if »du = us = 100 km/s, then wdL = 4.14 X »du = 4.14 X 100 
km/s = 414 km/s. The mobility of electrons in the lower conduc­
tion band is then [ll = 5.2jiu = 5.2 X 0.119 m2/V-s = 0.62 
m2/V-s. This is at EL = 0.8£u = 0.8 X 0.842 V/m = 0.674 X 106

5.2 Current-Voltage Curve of Transferred Electron Devices 87
5.2 Current - Voltage Curve of Transferred Electron Devices
If the electron density of the lower conduction band is nL (m 3), 
and the electron density of the upper conduction band is nu, the 
current density in the transferred electron device (TED) under a 
given electric field strength E (V/m) is
J = qn^u^ + qnuuu
= qnLp.LE + qnjiuE (A/m2) 
(5.2.1)
where q is the magnitude of electronic charge in coulombs.
When the applied voltage V is low and E is small, most 
electrons are in the lower conduction band where nL » nu and 
HL > p.u all the time. The first term, qnLp.LE, dominates in 
Eq. 5.2.1. In this low voltage region

In the low voltage region, the device current increases almost 
linearly with the applied voltage as shown in Fig. 5.2.
When the applied voltage V approaches the threshold voltage 
CIH for the electron transfer, some of the electrons begin the 
transfer from the lower conduction band to the upper conduction 
band. At this point the magnitude of the first term of Eq. 5.2.4 
decreases and the magnitude of the second term increases. With a 
sufficiently high voltage, most electrons are transferred to the 
upper conduction band and the lower conduction band is almost 
empty. In the high voltage range, the second term of Eq. 5.2.4 
therefore dominates. In the second term, there is slow drift veloc­
ity, a heavy effective electron mass, and small electron mobility. 
Consequently, in spite of a high applied voltage, the device 
current does not flow much, as seen from Fig. 5.2. Between the 
low voltage 1/ and the high voltage in Fig. 5.2, there is a

possibility that the current dips to form a negative differential 
conductivity.
For the 10.525 GHz Gunn diode discussed in Section 5.1, if 
the diode de current is 30 mA and at a de bias of 8 V, then the 
diode is consuming 8 V X 30 mA = 240 mW of de power. If the 
microwave power emission is 80 mW, then the oscillation effi­
ciency is (80 mW/240 mW) X 100% = 33.2%. In Fig. 5.2, a 
typical value for VH is 12 V, then I = qAnufj,uVii/d. Then A = 
Id/qn^V* = 30 X 10'3A X 9.5 X 10 6 m/[(1.6 X IO19 C)

10“6 m)2 = (35.3 fim)2.
A GaAs of cross-sectional area A = 1247.3 X 10 12 m2 and 
thickness d — 9.5 X 10“6 m can expect the capacitance of Cd = 
ereoA/d = 13.2 X 8.854 X 1012 F/m X 1247.3 X 1012 m2/9.5 
X 10“6 m = 0.153 X10“12 F.
An emergent diode structure here is an n-type GaAs chip of 
donor concentration nu = 1015 cm 3 = 1021 m 3 of area A = 
35.3 |im X 35.3 jim and thickness d = 9.5 X 10 6 m. The actual 
device is much thicker however. The reason is that the above 
mentioned thickness d = 9.5 X 10“6 m is only the active part of 
the diode structure. The diode must have good ohmic contacts on 

5.2 Current-Voltage Curve of Transferred Electron Devices 89
both sides of the surfaces of the active region and the active region 
must be developed on a substrate. This active region is therefore 
usually grown epitaxially on top of a good conducting, heavily 
doped n+ GaAs substrate 100 pm thick. On top of this n+-sub- 
strate, a 9.5 pm thick n-layer, which is the active layer, is epitaxi­
ally grown. On top of this active layer, a thin layer of heavily 
doped n++,-layer is epitaxially grown for good metallic contact. 
The exterior of this thin n + +-layer and thick n+-substrate is 
metallized by evaporating a thin layer of AuSn or AuGe for lead 
structure bonding. The diodes are packaged in a similar way as 
described in Chapter 3. Usually, the thin n + +-side is the cathode 
and the thick n+-side is the anode. The thin n + +-side is directly 
attached to a heavy heat sink [5,7,9,10,11,13,15,16],
If all electrons are transferred to the upper conduction band 
then, as seen from Fig. 5.2,

The saturation current of 30 mA is therefore reached at

Fig. 5.2

(5.2.7)
or

(5.2.8)
This means that in order to reach the saturation current of 30 mA, 
V must be UL = 30 X 10”3A/0.01283 S = 2.34 V. As seen from 
Eq. 5.2.5, the high field static conductance of the Gunn diode CH 
is
CH = qAn^u/d (S) 
(5.2.9)
which is 0.002475 S in this example.

The Gunn diode’s low field static conductance GL is, accord­
ing to Eq. 5.2.7,
Gl = qAnd^/d (S) 
(5.2.10)
which is 0.01283 S in this example.
Between V = VL and V = EH, the available electrons change 
their distribution. Some electrons are in the lower conduction 
band and the rest of them are in the upper conduction band. In 
the region where VL < V < KH, nL + nu = constant but the dis­
tribution changes and Eq. 5.2.4 stands.
For example, if the diode reaches saturation current Is for a 
certain voltage in the range VL < V < FH, then from Eq. 5.2.4,

andnL = n - nu = 1021m 3 - 0.88 X 1021m 3 = 0.12 X 1021m-3. 
So at V= 8 V, nu: nL = 0.88:0.12. Similarly, at V = 10 V, 
nu:nL = 0.95:0.05. At V = 4 V, nu:nL = 0.52:0.48. This means 
that between F, and FH in Fig. 5.2, electrons are gradually 
transferred from the lower conduction band to the upper conduc­
tion band as the bias voltage V increases.

Eq. 5.3.8 is therefore well satisfied by the first term of the right

The dynamic conductance and static conductance are different 
from each other in both magnitude and signs.
Once negative conductance is established, the effect of dy­
namic negative conductance is identical to the one discussed in 
Section 3.4 for tunnel diodes and in Section 4.3 for avalanche 
diodes. Actual diode packages and circuit design are also identical 
to those in Chapters 3 and 4. Therefore the effect of negative 
conductance on the amplification, the oscillation, packaging, and 
circuitry are not repeated here.
5.4 High Field Domain and the Gunn Effect
When a bulk n-type GaAs semiconductor is sandwiched between 
a pair of ohmic contact conducting parallel electrodes as shown in 
Fig. 5.2, the electric potential distribution and carrier electron 
charge distribution are as sketched in Fig. 5.3.
In the beginning, at t = 0, assuming that the bias voltage is 
beyond the threshold voltage CTH and that it is in the negative 
o x

slope region of Fig. 5.2, a high field region will appear at the 
contacts in both the cathode and the anode. Contact potential and 
contact resistance are the reason for the high field. Beyond the 
threshold voltage, the drift velocity of electrons at the high field 
region, uu, is slower than the drift velocity of electrons at the low 
field region, uL, or uL»uu. As a result, electrons tend to 
accumulate near the high field domain. Electrons near the high 
field region at the anode are discharged almost immediately, but 
electrons at the cathode high field domain must drift across the 
device thickness d (meters).
As sketched in Fig. 5.3, at time t the high field domain and 
the associated carrier electron accumulation region drift across the 
device thickness d with the upper band drift velocity uu. Since 
uL uu, the charge accumulation grows as it travels across the 
device thickness d. At x = d, the accumulated electron charge is 
discharged at the anode, and the initial condition at Z = 0 is again 
established. The phenomena will repeat itself again and again 
until the bias voltage is shut off. The oscillation frequency must 
therefore be
u
f=^ 
(5-4.1)
d
This effect was found experimentally by J. B. Gunn [1], and is 
called the Gunn effect. Note that, in order to observe the Gunn 
effect, the bias voltage must be beyond threshold, and it must be 
placed in the negative differential conductance region.
In most commercial Gunn diodes, uu ~ 100 km/s. By know­
ing the oscillation frequency, the effective device thickness is 
known or vice versa. For example, if f = 26 GHz, then d = 
105 m/s/26 X 109 s-1 = 3.8 X 10 6 m. The effective device 
thickness can be smaller than the actual device thickness. Electron 
charge in the high field domain discharges and the domain col­
lapses before reaching the anode metallization. This is the case of 
the limited space-charge accumulation mode (LSA) operation 
[6,8,14],
5.5 
Oscillation by Transferred Electrons
Oscillation by transferred electrons is distinctly different from the 
oscillation due to the tunnel effect or the avalanche effect. In both 
the tunnel effect oscillator and the avalanche effect oscillator, the 
negative differential mobility of carriers is not required to form a 
negative differential conductance. In the tunnel effect oscillator, 
the carrier mobility through the junction is not related at all. After 

5.6 Amplification by Transferred Electrons 95
all, the tunnel effect current is the quantum mechanical current 
carried by de Broglie waves; it is not the drift current. The 
avalanche effect current is the drift current, yet the differential 
mobility of the carrier electron is always positive. For both tunnel 
diodes and avalanche diodes, the negative differential conductivity 
is related to the magnitude of the quantity of the carrier trans­
portation rather than the mobility of the carriers. For transferred 
electron devices (TED), the negative differential mobility due to 
the energy transfer from the lower conduction band to the upper 
conduction band is important in order to form both the negative 
differential conductance, as explained in Section 5.3, and the high 
field domain, as explained in Section 5.4. Due to the domain 
formation, the oscillation frequency is determined by Eq. 5.4.1. In 
this equation, the average drift velocity of the high field domain 
ua is not uniquely determined by the bias voltage for a given 
device only. For optimum oscillation, both Eqs. 3.4.1. and 3.4.4 
must be satisfied after adaptation to the TED. Usually the simul­
taneous solution of Eqs. 3.4.1 and 3.4.4 with respect to the 
oscillation frequency is not analytically easy, for these equations 
are likely to be transcendental. In addition, the device is likely to 
be degenerate. In other words, not all of the roots of the transcen­
dental equation are useful to explain the experimentally observed 
oscillation frequency or frequencies. But one of the oscillation 
frequencies must fit with Eq. 5.4.1. If it does, the device satisfies 
Gunn effect oscillation. The domain velocity uu is therefore 
influenced by external circuit parameters such as gL and BL, 
beside G'TED and 5TED. For this particular Gunn diode, it is 
sometimes possible to oscillate with Eqs. 3.4.1 and 3.4.4 but not 
with Eq. 5.4.1. In such a case, it is not Gunn effect oscillation, 
even though the device is a Gunn diode. Practical configurations 
of the oscillator circuits [5,7,9,11,15,16,18,19] are similar to the 
ones shown in Fig. 3.5 and Fig. 3.6. For example, in the Gunn 
diode of 10.525 GHz presented in Section 5.3, by calculating 
ge = -9.47 X 10 4 S, the circuit conductance should be gL = 
9.47 X 10 4 S. This is small. The Gunn diode must be mounted at 
the maximum electric field location of a high-Q cavity resonator. 
In actual commercially packaged Gunn diodes, ge is on the order 
of IO’4 S.
5.6 
Amplification by Transferred Electrons
TED amplifiers are not as popular as TED oscillators, but can be 
achieved if necessary as in the case of the tunnel diode using 

96 Transferred Electron Devices
circuits similar to those shown in Figs. 3.5 and 3.6 
[5,7,9,11,15,16,18,19]. The gain of the TED amplifiers is given by 
Eq. 3.4.3, provided that the input signal frequency approximately 
satisfies Eq. 5.4.1. It is not necessary to satisfy Eq. 3.4.1 for the 
case of amplification. For example, if the Gunn diode of 10.525 
GHz, discussed in Section 5.5, is to make a 10 dB power gain 
amplifier, then A = 10 dB = gL/(gL + ge), or gL = -Age/ 
(T - 1) = -10(-9.47 X 10 4 S)/(10 - 1) = 10.52 X 10 4 S.
5.7 
Transferred Electron Devices
When a properly doped n-type GaAs is biased beyond the thresh­
old voltage, electrons in the lower conduction band transfer to the 
upper conduction band. The transferred electrons have less mobil­
ity than the electrons in the lower conduction band. As a result, 
negative differential conductivity is created and the high field 
domain is formed. The oscillation and amplification of the trans­
ferred electron devices are determined by the dynamic negative 
conductivities of the device, the circuit admittance, and the device 
susceptance. If the oscillation frequency of the device is equal to 
the reciprocal of the electron transit time of the high field domain 
crossing the device, then the oscillation is the Gunn effect oscilla­
tion.
n-type GaAs is the original material for the TED. But for 
higher frequency applications, InP is widely used. The high fre­
quency limitation is not due to the device transit time but the 
packaging RC time constant. By compensating the diode capaci­
tance C electronically, the upper frequency limit of a TED is 
extended to several hundred GHz with appreciable output power 
[17].

Impact Avalanche Transit 
Time Diodes
6.1 Carrier Injection by Avalanche Effect
The impact avalanche transit time effect takes place when a p-n + 
junction diode is reverse biased through a microwave resonator, as 
shown in Fig. 6.1 [1-3], The de bias voltage Ko is adjusted to the 
verge of avalanche breakdown at the p-n+ junction. The n-type 
semiconductor, usually silicon, is doped enough to short circuit 
the electric field inside the n+ semiconductor as seen from the 
field plot of E as a function of x diagram in Fig. 6.1 [7,12,13,17], 
There is a high field at the junction due to carrier depletion caused 
by the reverse bias. The doping in the p-side is graded and the 
doping density is greater toward the cathode. The electric field 
distribution in the p-type semiconductor is therefore large at the 
junction, but decreases in magnitude toward the cathode as 
sketched in Fig. 6.1. At x = 0, the electric field junction is at the 
maximum, Eo (V/m). Toward the cathode, the field strength 
decreases. At the cathode, x = d, and the field strength is zero as 
it reaches the conducting cathode. Under this condition, if a small 
amount of microwave bias field e (V/m) is superimposed on Eo, 
as shown in Fig. 6.1, then Eo + e momentarily exceeds the 
avalanche breakdown field strength Ea,
(Eo + e)>Ea 
(6.1.1)

Depletion Region
At this moment, the impact avalanche ionization multiplication 
will occur at the junction. Thus electron-hole pairs are generated 
and the carrier is injected into the drift region, which is in the 
p-type semiconductor. The carrier injection is only momentary. As 
soon as the microwave bias voltage and the de field (e + Eo) 
become less than the breakdown voltage Ea,
(Eo + e)<Ea 
(6.1.2)
the avalanche breakdown ceases and there will be no more carrier 
injection. As seen from the illustration in Fig. 6.1, £'a is exceeded 
by (Eo + e) at least once per period. £'a is known to be 9 kV/cm 
for Ge and 20 kV/cm for Si in commercially available IMPATT 
diodes. The generated electron-hole pair is quickly separated. The 

6.1 Carrier Injection by Avalanche Effect 101
electrons are immediately discharged at the anode. The holes 
travel through the p-region to reach the cathode. The drift velocity 
of the holes is known to be 6 X 106 m/s for Ge and 5 X 106 m/s 
for Si in commercially available IMPATT diodes. The holes will 
be discharged at the cathode at x = d, thus producing a relatively 
large current i. If the transit time r of the holes crossing the 
p-device coincide with the period T of the small microwave 
voltage e, or
t=T 
(6.1.3)
then the large cathode current energizes the microwave resonator 
when the discharged current i is properly phased with the res­
onator voltage e. Positive feedback is accomplished and the 
system goes into oscillation. This type of p-n+ junction is called 
an impact avalanche transit time (IMPATT) diode.
The important mechanism here is that the small microwave 
voltage produces a large microwave current by periodically inject­
ing carriers by means of momentary impact avalanche ionization 
multiplication.
For example, if an IMPATT diode is operating at f = 
26 GHz, then the period T = 1// = 1/(26 X 109 s / = 0.038 X 
10 9 s. This means that the electron transit time across the drift 
region is r = T = 0.038 ns. If the IMPATT diode is made of Si, 
the drift velocity u = 5 X 106 m/s [1], By taking the average 
velocity of a triangular velocity distribution throughout the drift 
region, the thickness of the p-type drift region is therefore approx­
imately d = ut/2 = 0.5(5 X 106 m/s) X 0.038 X 10-9 s = 95 X 
10 6 m. Now, £a = 20 kV/cm for Si [1], By taking the average 
field strength of the E field of a triangular distribution, the de bias 
across the drift region must be Fa = E^d/2 = 0.5(20 X 105 
V/m)(95 X 10 6 m) = 95 V. As seen from Fig. 6.1, the voltage 
drop across thin n+-layer and metallization is negligible compared 
with the voltage across the p-region. Fa = 95 V is considered to be 
the avalanche breakdown voltage of this 95 jam thick reverse 
biased IMPATT diode. If the carrier injection angle is 0, then

For example, if Ea = Eo, then 0 = tt. The carrier is injected for 
the entire half-period of microwave cycle. On the other hand, if 0

Since Ea = 2 X 106 V/m, the bias de field strength Eo must be 
adjusted so that Eo together with e produces the desired carrier 
injection angle 0. From Fig. 6.1, it is seen that when the oscilla­
tion is weak, Eo must be close to Ea. When oscillation starts, 0 is 
small. As the oscillation gets stronger and approaches steady state, 
0 gets larger. Ideally, as soon as the bunch of the carriers dis­
charges at the anode, new carriers should be injected and multi­
plied at the anode. 0

So if 0 — it/A,, Eo is chosen to be 1.9 X 106 V/m for Ea = 2 X 
106 V/m, then e/Eo = [(2 X 106 V/m/1.9 X 106 V/m) - 1]/ 
cos(tt/8) = 0.057. This means that the amplitude of the micro­
wave field strength e = 0.057Eo V/m = 0.057 X 1.9 X 
106 V/m = 0.1082 X 106 V/m. Eo is translated to the terminal 
de bias voltage using the triangular approximation as shown in 
Fig. 6.1, Vo = 0.5Eod = 0.5(1.9 X 106 V/m)(95 X 10 6 m) = 
90.25 V. The amplitude of the microwave voltage vo, which 
is superimposed on the de bias Vo, is vo = O.Sed = 0.5(0.1082 X 
106 V/m)(95 X 10“6 m) = 5.14 V.

6.2 Oscillation by Impact Avalanche Transit Time Effect
When the p-n+ junction diode is reverse biased at avalanche 
breakdown voltage, an appreciable amount of shot noise occurs in 
addition to the thermal agitation noise. If a microwave resonator 
is placed in the bias circuit, as shown in Fig. 6.1, an appreciable 
amount of microwave voltage will develop across the resonator 
due to the filter action and resonance effect. As stated in Section 
6.1, this microwave voltage v superimposed on the de bias Vo will 

6.2 Oscillation by Impact Avalanche Transit Time Effect 103
inject carriers into the drift region. The carriers discharge a 
relatively large amount of current into the cathode and into the 
resonator, and the oscillation builds up by the positive feedback 
loop through the discharged current on the cathode.
Suppose that a total hole charge Q (C) is injected at a distance 
x in Fig. 6.1. This hole charge Q induces the negative charge — Qc 
on the cathode at x = d by electrostatic induction. The same hole 
charge Q induces the negative charge — Qa on the anode at x = 0 
by electrostatic induction. The charge neutrality law states that
Q = 2C + 2a 
(6.2.1)
For simplicity, plane parallel electrodes are assumed at x = 0 and 
x = d, and the amount of the charge induced is inversely propor­
tional to the distance. Therefore, at the cathode,
2C =Q~, (6-2.2) 
d
When the injected hole charge Q approaches the cathode, x 
increases so 2C increases. The change in Qc refers to the induced 
current flow in the external circuit. This current is due to the 
electrostatic induction by the moving charge Q. The induction 
current therefore starts to flow even before the hole charge Q 
physically reaches the cathode at x = d. If the induced external 
circuit current is /e,

where u is the average drift velocity of the injected hole charge in 
the p-region, then d/u is the hole transit time r across the 
p-region.

But before the current Ie can flow, the charge Q must be formed 
at x = 0.

104 Impact Avalanche Transit Time Diodes
If the carrier injection angle is 0O, then 0O is the electrical angle 
of the microwave bias voltage V within a portion of the positive 
half-cycle as illustrated in Fig. 6.1. During this period of 0O, the 
hole charge Q is formed. The charge Q is not fully discharged 
until the injected hole charge reaches the cathode r seconds later 
or
0O + 
(6-2.6)
where 0t is the hole transit angle across the drift region. Therefore, 
from the injection of the carrier at the junction to the discharge at 
the cathode, there is a phase delay angle of
0 = 0O + 0t 
(6.2.7)
from the peak microwave bias voltage. When the discharge at the 
cathode, dQ/dt, is at a maximum, it is the peak cathode current. 
The peak current delays the peak voltage by the angle 0.

(6.2.8)

where v is the microwave bias voltage and i is the microwave 
current at the biasing circuit. It should be noted that there is a 
small biasing de current which also flows beside the microwave 
current i. Then z in Eq. (6.2.8) is the microwave impedance of the 
diode.
If the delay angle is such that
| < 0 < 77 
(6.2.9)
then z contains the negative real part or negative resistance. The 
negative resistance is
r = z cos 0 = z cos(0o + 0t) 
(6.2.10)
As discussed in Chapters 3, 4, and 5, the negative resistance is 
responsible for oscillation and amplification. As seen from 
Eq. 6.2.10, the negative resistance is determined by, among other 
things, the delay angle 0. The maximum realizable negative resis­
tance occurs at
cos 0 = cos(0o + 0t) = — 1 
(6.2.11)
or
0 = 0O + 0t = 77 
(6.2.12)
to meet the condition 6.2.9.

If the circuit is matched to this condition, from Eq. 6.2.8,

PL = ri2 = RLi2 = — 
(6.2.13)

(6.2.14)
where the negative impedance
z = r(«) + jX(w) 
(6.2.15)
and the load impedance
ZL = /?L(W)+yWL(W), 
(6.2.16)
the oscillation frequency is the simultaneous solution of 
Eqs. 6.2.13 and 6.2.14 with respect to the angular frequency w. 
The microwave output power is given by Eq. 6.2.13.
For example, if the IMPATT diode of 26 GHz described in 
Section 6.1 produces microwave output power PL = 500 mW = 5 
X 10-1 W to matched output microwave impedance RL = 50 12, 
then the microwave voltage across the output terminal is 
v = 
= ^50 12 X 5 X 10’1 W = 5 V. The output micro wave
current is i = y/P^/R^ = ^5 X 10’1 W/50 12 = 10-1A = 100 mA. 
As calculated in Section 6.1, this 5-V, 100-mA, 500-mW micro­
wave power is generated by de bias Vo = 90.25 V + 5.19 V — 
5 V = 90.39 V. The amount of charge Q generated at the avalanche 
region can be calculated from Eq. 6.2.3.
Q = id/u = (5 X 101 A)(95 X 10 6 m)/5 X 106 m
= 9.5 X 10-12 C = 9.5 pC.
Since the charge of an electron is q = 1.6 X 10“19 C, then the 
number of holes at the avalanche region is after the avalanche 
effect, Ah = Q/q = 9.5 X 10’12 C/1.6 X 10’19 C = 5.94 X 107. 
While this does not look like very many, they are confined in a 
small region of the avalanche region. Now, if the diode has a cross 
section of A = 150 /rm X 150 /rm and the avalanche region has a 
thickness of 9.5 firn, then 5.94 X 107 holes are confined in 150 X 
150 X 9.5 |tm3 = 2.14 X 10’13 m3. Therefore, the hole density 
nh = 5.94 X 107/2.14 X 10’13 m3 = 2.78 X IO20 m’3 = 2.78 X 
1014 cm’3.
Since Eq. 6.2.5 can be interpreted as an average current during 
the oscillation period r, then the de diode current Zdc = Ie = 
q/7 = g/-= 9.5 x 10’12 C • 26 X 109 Hz = 247 X 10’3A. Then 
the de power consumption of this diode is Po = VoIdc = 90.39 V

X 247 X 10 3 A = 22.3 W. The efficiency is then (PL/PO) X 
100% = (5 X 10-1W)/(22.3 W) X 100% = 2.2% The microwave 
voltage across the diode is now v = 5 V and the microwave 
current is i = 0.1 A. Therefore the diode impedance is, from 
Eq. 6.2.8, z = v/i = 5 V/0.1 Ae> = -50 0, if 0 = tt. This is the 
negative resistance. This satisfies Z + ZL = — 50 
+ 50

which is an oscillation condition and the oscillation frequency is 
f= uA/d = Q.5u/d = 0.5 (5 X 106 m/s)/95 X 10’6 m = 26 X 
109 Hz = 26 GHz, provided that the resonator is at resonance or, 
in Eqs. 6.2.15 and 6.2.16, Z(w) + ZL(w) = 0. In this specific 
case, since ZL(w) = 0, then Z(w) = 0 at resonance, or vice versa.
6.3 Amplification by Impact Avalanche Transit Time Effect
The magnitude of the negative resistance due to the impact 
avalanche transit time effect can be obtained from Eq. 6.2.8
r = z cos(0o + 0t)
(6.3.1)
under the amplification equilibrium
where v is the microwave voltage across the load after tuning. 
Then u2/RL is the microwave output, v2/r is the power generated 
by the negative resistance r, and the output power v2/R^ divided 
by the gain A, which is u2/ARL, is the input power. Then

but the condition

For example, if the load or external circuit impedance RL = 50

chosen with the impedance z > RL or adjusted to meet the 
condition 6.3.7 by adjusting the de bias voltage Vo or by trimming 
the external impedance. If z = 60 fl is chosen and A = 20 dB =

(6.3.16)
This means that the de bias voltage Vo must be adjusted so that 
the overall transit time r = 0.02274 ns to obtain 20 dB power gain 
using a 60 fl diode to 50 fl load impedance. It is interesting to 
note that the period for 26 GHz microwave is T = 1/f = 1 /26 X 
109 = 0.038 ns.

w±r = cos”1 0.85 = ±0.5548 + it rad
= 3.6964 rad or 2.5868 rad 
(6.3.23)
Then w + = 3.6964 rad/0.02274 X 10”9 s = 162.6 X 109 rad/s 
and w”= 2.5868 rad/0.02274 X 10”9 s = 113.76 X 109 rad/s. 
The frequency bandwidth is therefore

This means that this 26 GHz amplifier has a half power gain 
frequency bandwidth of 7.77 GHz.
A larger bandwidth can be obtained by making the IMPATT 
diode structure in the form of a distributed parameter transmis­
sion line. The anode and cathode of the IMPATT diode form a 
microwave transmission line in this structure [14], This is therefore 
an IMPATT traveling wave amplifier.

Read Structure [4]
The impact avalanche transit time effect can be utilized by making 
the device structure n+-p-i-p+ as originally proposed by W. T. 
Read. The biasing scheme and the electric field distribution are 
sketched in Fig. 6.2. To make a good ohmic contact with a metal 
electrode, the end layers n+ and p+ are doped heavily. An impact 
avalanche carrier injection occurs in the avalanche zone around 
the n+p junction whenever the combination of the de bias field Eo 
and the microwave field e exceeds the avalanche breakdown field 
Ea. The generated electrons are discharged quickly at the anode.

The generated holes must travel through the depletion region, 
which is created by the reverse bias and the intrinsic semiconduc­
tor layer to reverse bias and the intrinsic semiconductor layer to 
reach the cathode. This n+-p-i-p+ structure generally requires a 
relatively longer electron transit time and a higher de voltage than 
the simple n+-p structure as shown in Section 6.1. This is there­
fore suitable for use in low-microwave-frequency, high-power 
IMPATT device. In Si IMPATT devices, the impurity concentra­
tion is IO20 m"3 for Np or Nn, 1024 m 3 for Np + or Nn + , and 
even 1014 m3 for [9,10].

region by momentary avalanche breakdown. A similar effect can

to the one shown in Fig. 6.3.
The structure is n+-n-p+. This structure is termed a single 
drift flat (SDF) structure. When reverse biased, the avalanche 
zone appears at the n-p+ junction. When the de field Eo plus the 
microwave field e exceeds the avalanche breakdown field Ea, the 
electron-hole pairs are generated by the impact avalanche effect. 
The generated holes exit quickly at the cathode, but the generated 
electrons are injected into the drift zone and drift across the 
n-layer to reach the anode. In this silicon structure, an efficiency 
of 5-6.5% has been reported [5],

the double drift flat (DDF) structure has been engineered. A 
schematic diagram of the DDF structure is shown in Fig. 6.4. 
When the combined electric field strength of the de bias and the 
microwave bias exceeds the avalanche breakdown field strength, 
there will be a momentary avalanche breakdown at the n-p 
junction. As illustrated in Fig. 6.4, the generated holes drift across 
the p-region to reach the cathode, and the generated electrons 
drift across the n-region to reach the anode. A critical adjustment 
to be made in fabricating this type of device is good synchroniza­
tion of drifting electrons and holes. The transit time for the 

6.8 Barrier Injection Transit Time Devices 113
electrons and holes must be statistically equal in order to accom­
plish this objective. It has been reported that the efficiency of 
DDF IMPATT devices is 8-11% [5], This is a significant improve­
ment over the SDF IMPATT.
6.7 
Trapped Plasma Avalanche Triggered Transit
In the ordinary IMPATT structure of an n-p device, as shown in 
Fig. 6.1, if the de bias electric field Eo is almost equal to the 
avalanche breakdown electric field £a by positive feedback, the 
microwave voltage V grows so large that the microwave field e is 
almost equal to E& or
Eo + e«2Ea 
(6.7.1)
The avalanche breakdown occurs in a wide region in the p-type 
semiconductor. In other words, when the IMPATT is driven to a 
large signal level with a high de bias, the avalanche zone is 
extensive, creating a large amount of electron-hole pairs by the 
impact avalanche ionization multiplication effect. In the positive 
halfcycle of the microwave field, a large amount of plasma is 
generated in the diode. The large amount of avalanche breakdown 
demands a large voltage drop through the microwave resonator 
impedance, which is connected in series with the de bias voltage 
source. This low terminal voltage makes the carrier drift velocity 
slow. Before all of the electrons and holes drift away from the 
wide avalanche zone, the microwave field e goes to the negative 
half-cycle by trapping the plasma in the p-region. In the negative 
half-cycle, there is a field strength of at least (£o — e) V. There­
fore, the electrons and holes still move slowly toward the anode 
and the cathode respectively. This makes the current in the 
negative half-cycle very small. The large amount of plasma in the 
positive half-cycle makes the current extremely high. In the nega­
tive half-cycle, the trapped plasma slowly disintegrates by the 
electrons and holes drifting away from it or by recombination of 
them within it. Then the cycle of the process repeats. This mode of 
operation is termed the trapped plasma avalanche triggered transit 
or TRAPATT [6,7], The TRAPATT mode of operation efficiently 
produces large microwave current and power.

Barrier Injection Transit Time Devices
Instead of the n-p+ structure in the SDF IMPATT device shown 
in Fig. 6.3, n-m structure—an n-type semiconductor-metal

114
Impact Avalanche Transit Time Diodes
Schottky barrier structure—can be utilized. The reverse biased 
n-m Schottky barrier behaves similarly to the n-p+ junction in 
reverse biasec conditions. When the bias field momentarily ex­
ceeds the threshold voltage of the avalanche breakdown, 
electron-hole pairs are generated in the depletion region of the 
reverse biased Schottky barrier diode. These are initially triggered 
by tunneling electrons through the barrier from the metal to the 
semiconductor. The generated holes exist immediately to the 
metallic cathode. The generated electrons are injected to the drift 
region of the n-type semiconductor and then drift across the 
semiconductor and exit through the ohmic contact to the anode. 
Though the junction structure and mechanism of carrier injection 
is different from SDF IMPATT, other parts of their actions are 
similar to the one with the SDF IMPATT. This device is termed 
the barrier injection transit time device or the BARITT device. 
The actual BARITT diode is quite complicated [8], but the essen­
tial elements of the theory are as stated in this section.
6.9 
Mounting Configuration of IMPATT Devices
The biasing structure of IMPATT devices is quite different from 
the biasing schemes of tunnel diodes, Gunn diodes or avalanche 
diodes. As shown throughout Chapter 6, the microwave resonator 
must be connected in series with the de bias circuit of an 
IMPATT device. In other microwave active diodes, the microwave 
circuit can be either in series or parallel to the bias circuit. The 
microwave resonator circuit discussed in Chapter 3 is connected in 
parallel with the active diodes.
A typical waveguide mounting scheme for an IMPATT device 
is shown in Fig. 6.5. As seen from this diagram, the IMPATT 
diode is connected in series with a disk resonator, also called a hat 
resonator. The diameter of the disk is approximately one half­
wavelength.
If a pill type IMPATT diode is used for an MMIC or 
microstrip circuit, the circuit configuration as shown in Fig. 3.5 is 
applicable. If a planer IMPATT diode is used, a different circuit 
configuration, as shown in Fig. 6.6, can be used to accomodate 
different diode biasing requirements. An important design concept 
is that the diode must be properly biased and the microwave 
voltage must be superimposed on the de bias voltage [18,19], The 
configuration shown in Fig. 6.6 uses two half-wavelength res­
onators, one spreading over both sides of the diode and the other 
one at the right-hand side of the diode. The diode is biased 
through the microstripline resonator and Xz/4 microwave choke

lines which include the capacitor pads. An extremely thin 
microstrip allows for high impedance. Input impedance of the 
Xz/4 thin bias line is extremely high because the line is thin and 
capacitively short circuited at a point Xz/4 away from the feeding 
point at the microstripline resonator. At this point, microwave 
impedance is almost zero because it is Xz/4 away from the open

circuit end of the microstrip resonator line. These points are 
therefore points of minimum disturbance to microwave oscillation 
for feed points of de bias voltage. The impedance of oscillators is 
matched by single-stub matching. By adjusting and /2 as shown 
in Fig. 6.6, desired impedance-matching or coupling to the output 
circuit is accomplished.
The microstrip IMPATT oscillator or amplifier shown in the 
figure uses microstripline resonators. Instead of microstripline 
resonators, dielectric resonators can be used. If so desired, by 
simply placing a dielectric resonator close to the microstripline, 
the oscillator can be fabricated [11],
For example, if the IMPATT diode operates at 26 GHz, the 
free space wavelength is Xo = c/f = 3 X 108 m/s/26 X 109 s ’ 
= 1.15 X 10~2 m = 1.15 cm. If the microstripline board is made 
of an alumina substrate of er = 10, then the transmission line 
wavelength Xz « Xo/ =1.15 cm/ /W = 0.364 cm. The entire 
circuit board of Fig. 6.6 can be built on a Az/4 X X//4 = 0.45 cm 
X 0.45 cm chip.
6.10 Impact Avalanche Transit Time Effect Devices
Several different types of IMPATT devices are studied in this 
chapter. In spite of some variations, the following points are 
common.
1. The junction is reverse biased.
2. The bias voltage is on the verge of the threshold of avalanche 
breakdown.
3. Superimposed microwave fields cause momentary avalanche 
breakdown and, by the avalanche impact ionization multiplica­
tion, a number of electron-hole pairs are generated in the 
avalanche zone of the junction.
4. During the momentary avalanche breakdown, and after the 
breakdown ceases, the carriers are injected into the drift zone 
and the bunch of carriers drifts across the drift zone producing 
a half-cycle of microwave current in the outside circuit.
5. The process repeats.
6. Good synchronization of the tuning of the resonance circuit 
and the electron or hole transit time across the device is 
needed.
The IMPATT devices are relatively high power devices when 
compared with other active diodes such as tunnel diodes or Gunn

diodes. However, because of the nature of the avalanche break­
down, the device is noisy. Therefore, it is wise to use IMPATT 
devices for transmitting rather than for receiving in an rf amplifier 
or a local oscillator of a microwave receiver [12],
Like any other semiconductor device, the electrical character­
istics of an IMPATT device varies with environmental tempera­
ture. For example, the avalanche breakdown voltage changes with 
temperature. Even the thermal resistivity of the semiconductor 
itself is a function of temperature [15], Therefore, cooling mecha­
nisms and heat sinking devices must be carefully designed.
There are some other versions of IMPATT devices. In addi­
tion to TRAPATT and BARITT devices, there are TUNNETT 
and QWITT devices. All are distinguishable by how carriers are 
injected into the drift region. Both the TUNNETT (tunnel injec­
tion transit time) devices and the QWITT (quantum well injection 
transit time) devices employ the tunnel effect to inject electrons 
into the drift region [16], but the TUNNETT has a homojunction 
structure at the injection junction and the QWITT has a hetero­
junction structure at the injection junction. A QWITT device is 
generally considered to have a better injection efficiency than a 
TUNNETT device [16],

Microwave Autodyne and 
Homodyne Detectors
7.1 Autodyne and Homodyne Detection by Nonlinear Diodes
7.1.1 Autodyne Detection
In microwave electronics, autodyne detection usually means con­
verting carrier microwaves to lower frequency signals, including 
the direct current or zero frequency signals. Carrier microwaves 
are simply rectified or detected. When the carrier signal is ampli­
tude modulated, the demodulation takes place after detection.
Normally, an impedance Z is defined as the ratio of the 
voltage across the impedance v to the current z:
. v
Z = -7 
(7.1.1)
z
or
v = Zi. 
(7.1.2)
This means Z is the dynamic impedance or the different­
ial impedance of the microwave frequency, and is not the static 
impedance. If the voltage-current relationship is linear, the 
impedance is a constant, independent of the voltage or the cur­
rent. However, if the impedance Z is dependent on v or z, the

voltage-current relationship is no longer linear. The impedance is 
then said to be nonlinear. If the microwave current i flows 
through the nonlinear impedance Z(u) when the microwave volt­
age v is applied across the nonlinear impedance Z(u), then
. v .
i = -^r~=Y(u)u

where Y(u) is the nonlinear admittance. If v is the input micro­
wave voltage to be detected, then i contains the detected current. 
If v is a periodic function with respect to time, in a form of ut, 
where w is the angular frequency and t is time, then the Fourier 
expansion of Eq. 7.1.3 gives
i(r) = f[u(/)] v(r);

This is the detected current by the nonlinear admittance Y(u) or 
the nonlinear impedance Z(u) after tuning out the susceptance 
B(v) or reactance X(v). In practice, most of the time Io is the 
self-bias current. This must be taken into consideration for inte­
gration of Eq. 7.1.8.

This is called the square law detection. The detected current is 
proportional to the square of the input voltage.
This rule holds to the self or externally biased detector. G'(KO) 
indicates that the derivative of the differential conductance at the 
microwave input is zero with the de bias voltage at Vo. Biasing a 
crystal detector to find a maximum G'(FO) is a useful technique [1] 
because the detected current is proportional to G'(FO) as seen 
from Eq. 7.1.13.
For example, in the case of a 5082-2750 microwave Schottky 
barrier diode which is a metal-semiconductor contact diode, the 
measured current-voltage characteristic is as shown in Fig. 7.1 [7].

Bias Voltage (mV)
Fig. 7.1 Current-voltage characteristic curve of a 5082-2750 micro­
wave Schottky barrier detector diode.
The diode current I is plotted against the diode bias voltage Vo. 
From this data, the value of dynamic conductance G(FO) ~ 
| AZ/AFJ v at various bias voltage points Vo can be calculated and 
plotted. The results are shown in Fig. 7.2. In this figure the 
calculated dynamic conductance G(FO) is plotted against the bias 
voltage Vo. As seen in Fig. 7.2, the differential conductance is 
nonlinear. The differential conductance starts low and then in­
creases rapidly after the bias voltage exceeds 180 mV. From this 
data, the derivative of the differential conductance G'(FO) = 
^dG/dyjy can be calculated and plotted. G'(FO) is plotted against 
the bias voltage Vo in Fig. 7.3. As seen in Fig. 7.3, G'(FO) is also 
nonlinear. At a bias voltage greater than 180 mV, G'(FO) increases 
rapidly but reaches a maximum at Vo = 240 mV. According to 
Eq. 7.1.13, the detected current Io is proportional to G'(FO). If Io 
is to be maximized for the given microwave amplitude then, 
in the case of the 5082-2750 diode, the bias voltage should be 
approximately 240 mV. If this is compared with the zero 
bias case, estimating from Fig. 7.3, G'(0 mV) = 1.0 S/V, 
then (7'(240 mV)/G'(0 mV) = 30 S/V/1.0 S/V = 30. This 
means that the detected current ratio Zo(240 mV)/Zo(0 mV) = 
30 = 20 log10 30 dB = 20.5 dB. By simply de biasing the diode 
at 240 mV, the detected current increases 30 times or 29.5 dB.

It should not be confused with Io from the de bias current of the 
diode. Io is the detected current of microwave voltage v{. For the 
same amount of microwave signal strength, the 5082-2750 diode 
has a maximum detected current at the bias voltage 240 mV. 
Fig. 7.1 shows that the bias voltage 240 mV would produce a de 
bias current of 10 mA. According to the specifications of the diode 
[7], the tangential signal sensitivity of this diode is at a maximum 
in the neighborhood of the bias current 10 mA. The maximum 
tangential signal sensitivity is listed as —57.5 dBm [7], The 
tangential signal sensitivity is, by definition, the signal input 
power level which produces a unity signal-to-noise power ratio at 
the output. In industrial practice it is not easy to measure the 
signal-to-noise ratio at the input directly because of the low noise 
level involved. Instead, the detected signals are amplified and the 
input microwave signal level which makes the amplified output 
signal-to-noise ratio 0 dB is observed to be the tangential signal

sensitivity. This means that (S/N)output = 1=0 dB. The (S/N)input 
can be obtained from the definition of the noise figure of the 
measuring system which is by definition
N.F. = (S/N)input 
(7.1.14)
Then
(S/N)input = (N.F.)(S/N)output 
(7.1.15)
and
(S/N)input = 8 dB 
(7.1.16)
is very well accepted in industry [7], This means that (S/N)out t 
= 1 = 0 dB and N.F. = 8 dB is implied. The actual measurement 
of N.F. may not be 8 dB, but when (S/N)output = 1, then 
(S/N)input = N.F. of the measuring system.
The tangential signal sensitivity of this particular diode is 
specified as —57.5 dBm. This is usually for R = 50 fl resistance. 
P, = -57.5 dBm = [logfo1 (57.5/10)]-1 (mw) = 1.78 X 10“6 mW 
= 1.78 nW. If the microwave input signal voltage at the peak 

7.1 Autodyne and Homodyne Detection by Nonlinear Diodes 127
value is volts, then = O.5(u?/7?). Then v{ = /lRPi = 
^2 X 50 X 1.78 X 10“9 = 4.2 X 10 4 V = 0.42 mV.
The microwave power of — 57.5 dBm means it is 1.78 nW and 
it will develop 0.42 mV or 420 uN across the 50 fl impedance. 
This voltage is indeed small when compared with the bias voltage 
of 240 mV.
As far as autodyne detection by a nonlinear diode is con­
cerned, beside the tangential signal sensitivity (TSS), the current 
sensitivity /?, the voltage sensitivity y and the video resistance Rv 
are considered as specifying or characterizing parameters. If the 
microwave carrier frequency CW voltage in peak value is V and 
the detected current is Io A, then the ratio
(a/v) (7-1’17)
is called the current sensitivity. The dimensions of are the same 
as for the admittance. To avoid confusion, A/V (amperes/volts) 
is used as the unit of the current sensitivity instead of S (Siemens). 
If Eqs. 7.1.13 and 7.1.17 are combined, then
G'(FO)
(A/V) 
(7.1.18)
For example, in the case of the 5082-2750 diode, at bias voltage 
240 mV, G'(240 mV) = 30 S/V, and for microwave input power 
of —57.5 dBm, v{ = 0.42 mV. Therefore the current sensitivity for 
— 57.5 dBm CW input is
30 S/V
X 0.42 mV = 8.91 X 10"3 A/V
= 89.1 jiA/mV.
In the microwave detector diode industry, the frequency of the 
detected current or voltage including the detected de component is 
commonly called the video frequency. The resistance of the diode 
at this video frequency is called the video resistance. For example, 
the video resistance of the 5082-2750 diode is specified as RN = 
1.2-1.6 fl [7], If Rn = 1.6 fl is chosen for small input power, then 
the detected voltage CD across the diode is, by the definition of

Thevenin’s short circuit current. The detected output voltage is 
Thevenin’s open circuit voltage. The detected output current Io 
is in the short circuited “ video” circuit. The detected output 
voltage is with the open circuited video circuit. ED is therefore 
considered as the emf in the “video” circuit. The ratio ED/P; is 
called the voltage sensitivity.

(7.1.20)
In this example, the 5082-2750 diode produced VD = 10 fiV 
for microwave input power P; = 1.78 nW. The voltage sensitiv­
ity of this diode therefore is y = 10 ju.V/1.78 nW = 
5.62 pV/nW = 5.62 mV//iW.
7.1.2 Power Rectification
In large microwave power detection for utility purposes, nonlinear 
diodes are used and modeled as an on-off switch. [8], When a 
microwave emf applied to a utility circuit is in the positive 
half-cycle, the diode is turned on. When the microwave emf is in 
the negative half-cycle, the diode is turned off. This is a straight­
forward microwave rectification. If the microwave emf to be 
rectified is
E = Eo sin( wt) 
then the rectified output emf is
er = 
[ Eo sin(wt)d(wt) =
2 77V 2 
77v2
(7.1.21)
(7.1.22)
where Eo is the peak value of the applied microwave emf in the 
utility circuit.
For example, in a waveguide of characteristic impedance 
Zo = 450 fi, if a microwave of P = 1 kW is applied to a rectifying 
diode, the microwave emf is approximately
Eo = J2ZOP = fo X 450 X 103
= 9.49 X 102 V

To date, to the author’s knowledge, there is no single mi­
crowave rectifying diode of PM = 500 W, VM = 200 V, and IM = 
2.5 A with Rv = 4.8 fi. A number of experiments have been done 
by synthesizing a diode array utilizing a large number of micro­
wave detector diodes in the past [9,10]. Therefore, by using MMIC 
technology, there will be an MMIC power rectifier diode package 
in the near future.
7.1.3 Envelope Detection
In microwave communications, if is amplitude modulated to
yi = M1 + m sin(^z + ^p)]
(7.1.29)
where m is the depth of modulation, p is the modulation angular 
frequency, wi0 is the amplitude of microwave carrier, and <f>p is the 
initial phase angle of the modulation signal, then the detected

current is, by combining Eqs. 7.1.13 and 7.1.29,

(7.1.30)
In this equation, the first term is a de component, the second 
term is the fundamental frequency of the modulation signal, and 
the last term is the second harmonic of the modulation signal. 
Thus, the square law detector output current contains the de 
component and the second harmonic. If the de and the second 
harmonic outputs are filtered out, the rest is the fundamental 
frequency current
A = mG’(Vo)v2osin(pt + <£p) 
(7.1.31)
Thus the detected and filtered current preserves the waveform of 
modulation signals shown in Eq. 7.1.29, or the modulated mi­
crowave signals are demodulated or detected. The envelope of the 
microwave carrier is mvio sin( pt + <f>p). Therefore Eq. 7.1.31 shows 
that the envelope is detected.
For example, for the case of the 5082-2750 diode, if t>io = 0.42 
mV and m = 0.5, then the microwave input signal is
v1 = vio [1 + m sin( pt + <f>p)]cos(wt + <f>)
= 0.42 X 10 3 V [1 + 0.5 sin(pt + ^>p)]cos(wt + <f>) (7.1.32)

7.1 Autodyne and Homodyne Detection by Nonlinear Diodes 131
The detected current is, from Eq. 7.1.31,
I. = (0.5 X 30 S/V)(0.42 X 10“3 V)2Sin(/rt + <#>p)
= 2.646sin(pf + <j>p) fiA 
(7.1.33)
Therefore, for the microwave autodyne detection by nonlinear 
conductance, G'(VO) is important as well as G(VO). The nonlinear 
conductance is created by various solid-state devices in microwave 
electronics. One of the most common structures is a Schottky 
barrier diode.
7.1.4 Homodyne Detection
In the case of homodyne detection, the detector diode is biased 
with microwaves from a local oscillator whose frequency is equal 
to the incident microwave signals to be detected. If the local 
oscillator signal is represented by
vloM = vloocos(vt + ^) 
(7.1.34)
Then the total voltage impressed on the detector diode vt is, with 
Eq. 7.1.12,
vt = Uj + vlo = vtcos(ut + </>) + vloocos(vt + ip) (7.1.35) 
or in the phaser form
= t5! + Vio = 
+ Vioe^ 
(7.1.36)
In a triangle formed by + vlo and i5t, the angle against i5t, 6, is 
by inspection of the triangle
Then, by the use of a trigonometric identity,
= uj + vjo - 2v1V/o COS#
= v] + 
+ 2V1vlocos(<p - t) (7.1.38)
Combining Eqs. 7.1.13 and 7.1.38, the detected current is

+ vjoo + 2iWoocos(<J> - »/,)] (7.1.39)

132 Microwave Autodyne and Homodyne Detectors
Since the information is contained in v{, the amount of informa­
tion containing detected current 7d is
7d = —+ 2t7iU/oocos(4> - VO] (7.1.40)
The local oscillator voltage vloo does not contain any information 
at all, but it produces a self de bias Vo and strengthens informa­
tion containing the second term of Eq. 7.1.40. The detected 
current is optimized by choosing
4> — ip = 0 
(7.1.41)
This is achieved by synchronizing the local oscillator signal to 
incident microwave signals to be detected.

For example, if the 5082-2750 Schottky diode is used as a 
homodyne detector, and the local oscillator provides Plo = 
10 mW of power to Z = 50 12 load, then v/oo = yj2P/oZ = 
^2 X 10 X 10“3 W X 50Q = 1.0 V. If this voltage is applied 
across the diode, then the de self bias voltage Vo is developed and, 
from Eq. 7.1.42, Vo « 1.0 V/iryfl = 0.225 V = 225 mV. If the 
incoming microwave signals to be detected and the local oscillator 
signals are synchronized to each other, then 4> = and 
cos(<£ - ^) = I- By using Eq. 7.1.40, the detected current is 
7d = (30 S/V/2)[(4.2 X 10“4 V)2 + 2(4.2 X 10“4 V) X 1 V X 1] 
= 12.6 X 103 A = 12.6 mA. In this calculation, the value of 
<7'(225 mV) = 30 S/V is found in Fig. 7.3. This means that the 
homodyne produces 12.6 mA of detected current for 0.42 mV of 
microwave input signals. For the same input signal voltage, if this 
is an autodyne detection, it would produce only 6.3 /xA at the 
optimum. The current gain increase of homdyne detection over 
autodyne detection is 201og[12.6 X 10 3 A/6.3 X 10”6 A] = 
66 dB. This is a significantly larger gain over the autodyne 
detection.
7.2 Detection by Schottky Barrier
At the contact of the metal and the n-type semiconductor, the 
electrons in the metal repel electrons in the semiconductor and 
create the depletion layer at the contact. This carrier depletion 
layer is also created by natural electron diffusion from the metal 

7.2 Detection by Schottky Barrier 133
to the semiconductor neutralizing holes. This layer is known as 
the Schottky depletion layer. It creates a potential barrier off <£b 
at the contact with respect to the metal’s Fermi level where q is 
the amount of electronic charge. For example, q$b = 0.6 eV for 
AlSi, 0.8 eV for AuSi, 0.8 eV for AlGaAs and 0.48 eV for AlGe 
diodes [2], If the semiconductor is negatively biased by the amount 
of — V volts the effective potential barrier is q(4>b ~ V) electron­
volts and, with the electrons in the semiconductor, the potential 
barrier is easy to overcome when the bias V is increased. The bias 
which makes the semiconductor side negative is termed the for­
ward bias. Electrons in the semiconductor gain kinetic energy and 
overcome the effective potential barrier (4>b — F) electron-volts 
and drift into the conduction band of the metal. The total energy 
of the electrons overcoming the barrier potential q(<j>b — V) is 
generally greater than that of the electrons originally in the metal. 
The electrons drifting out from the semiconductor to the metal are 
called hot electrons or hot carriers. Therefore the diodes utilizing 
these hot electrons are called hot carrier diodes.
Adapting the Richardson-Dushman equation of thermionic 
emission [2] to the semiconductor, the forward current due to 
electron emission from the semiconductor to the metal is given by
I -q(<K - K) \
/f = SRT2e-------—------- (A) 
(7.2.1)
where S is the contact cross section m2, R is the effective 
Richardson constant 4irqm*k2/h\ k is the Boltzmann constant 
1.38 X IO’23 J/K = 8.62 X 10“5 eV/K, and q is the electronic 
charge 1.6 X 10 19 C; m* is the effective mass of the electron, 
h is Planck’s constant, 6.625 X 10“34 J-s, and q<j>b is the 
Schottky barrier potential created by the Schottky depletion layer.
For example, in Eq. 7.2.1, in a room temperature T = 300 K, 
q = 1.6 X 10-19 C, and if m* is assumed to be equal to m = 9.1 
X 10“31 kg, then the effective Richardson constant
R = 4tt(1.6 X 10 19 C)(9.1 X 10“31 kg)

The energy diagram of the metal n-type semiconductor Schott­
ky barrier diode is shown in Fig. 7.4. As seen from Fig. 7.4 and 
Eq. 7.2.1, when the forward bias voltage V is increased, (<j>b — V) 
becomes negatively large. And as seen from Eq. 7.2.1, the forward
current increases exponentially. At

but the net current at zero bias must be zero. So at the zero bias,
the same amount of the current must flow in the reverse direction.
Ib = SRZ2e( ^b/k7')
(7.2.8)
therefore the net current at zero bias is
I = 7f - Ib = 0

For the reverse direction, V < 0 and I approaches

This is the reverse saturation current then combining Eqs. 7.2.10 
and 7.2.11
I = I&(e(qV/kT} - 1) 
(7.2.12)
The current-voltage curve of a Schottky barrier diode or a hot 
carrier diode is sketched in Fig. 7.5. For example, if the contact is 
Al-Si, then<£b = 0.6 V. Using the contact area S' = 1.712 X 10-7m2, 
the effective Richardson constant is R = 1.2 X 106 A/m2- K2, 
when the forward bias V = <£b = 0.6 V, from Eq. 7.2.3 at room 
temperature T = 300 K, I{ = SRT2 = (1.712 X 10 7 m2)(1.2 X 
106 A/m2- K2)(300 K)2 = 18.6 X 103 A. Evidently, the diode is 
destroyed before reaching the forward bias V = 0.6 V or 600 mV. 
When the forward bias V = 0 V, according to Eq. 7.2.7 the 
forward current of
Zf = SRT2/
= (18.6 X 103 A)e<_<1-6><10~19C)<0-6 V)/<1-38xlcr23 j/ok)(30°k))
= 1.58 X IO’6 A
is supposed to be flowing even though it is small. In reality, there 
is no forward current. The electrons trying to diffuse into the 
metal from the semiconductor form the forward current 7f, which 
is counterbalanced by the reverse current Ib of the same amount 
which is formed by electrons diffusing from the metal to the

semiconductor. So in this case, Ib = 1.58 X 10“6 A, and the total 
current Io = 7f — Ib = 0 A.
According to Eq. 7.2.11, the reverse saturation current in this 
case is 7S = S'RT2e<“'?'(,b/k7’) = 1.58 X 10“6 A since q/kT = 1.6 
X 10“19 C/(1.38 X 10“23 J/K)(300 K) = 38.6, the current-volt­
age curve of this diode must be 7 = 1.58 X 10“6 (e38 6K — 1) A. If 
V = 280 mV = 0.28 V, then I = (1.58 X 10“6 A(e<38'6x0'28) - 1) 
» 0.08 A. If V = 240 mV = 0.24 V, then I = 1.58 X 10“6 A 
(e(38.6xo.24) _ i) = 0.0167 A = 16.7 mA. According to the mea­
sured value shown in Fig. 7.1, this is supposed to be 10 mA. At 
V = 180 mV = 0.18 V, 7 = (1.58 X 10“6 A)(e<38'6x018) - 1) = 
0.0016 A = 1.6 mA. According to the measured value from 
Fig. 7.1, this is supposed to be 1.5 mA.
In spite of the many rough assumptions made, Eq. 7.2.12 is a 
workable equation with reasonably acceptable errors.
The differential admittance G', which is useful for detection as 
seen from Eqs. 7.1.13 and 7.1.31, is obtained by differentiating 
Eq. 7.2.10 with

Comparing Eqs. 7.2.18 and 7.2.19, it is known that the current 
gain due to de biasing is obtained by Eq. 7.2.17.
7.3 
Detection by Degenerate p - n Junction
For tunnel diodes discussed in Chapter 3, if the doping is light in 
the degenerate semiconductors, the Fermi level of the p-type 
semiconductor approaches the surface of the valence band, and 
the Fermi level of the n-type semiconductor approaches the lower 
edge of the conduction band in Fig. 3.1. Light doping means that 
there are not many holes available in the p-type side to accept the 
tunneling electrons, if they are tunneling from the n-type side. 
This means that the forward tunnel current is small in comparison 
with the heavily doped regular tunnel diode. In Eq. 3.3.11, lightly 
doped degenerate p-n junction diodes or tunnel diodes have 
smaller kr, kv, krv, AEn, AEn, E — EF, E — EF, E—E, and 
C

E — Ec values. Therefore the forward tunnel current is small until 
the bias voltage reaches the valley voltage Vv. After that, the drift 
current begins to flow. The forward characteristic of the lightly 
doped degenerate p-n junction is shown in Fig. 7.6. Under reverse 
biased conditions, the area facing the conduction band of the 
n-type semiconductor against the valence band of the p-type 
semiconductor through the thin forbidden gap increases rapidly. 
This means that in Eq. 3.3.11, large kc, kv, kcv, E — £F, Ev — E, 
and E — Ec values are expected. Therefore, a rapid increase in 
the reverse tunnel current results from the increasing reverse 
voltage, as shown in Fig. 7.6. The current-voltage curve of this 
lightly doped tunnel diode resembles an upside-down and back­
ward regular p-n junction diode. This is the reason that this diode 
is called a back diode or backward diode.

7.3 Detection by Degenerate p-n Junction 139
Fig. 7.6 Current-voltage characteristic curve of a lightly 
doped degenerate p-n junction (back diode).
The back diode has a large second differential conductance at

drifting starts to occur.
d2/
(7-3.1) 
dr
This value is obtained graphically from Fig. 7.6 or numerically 
from the numerical integration of Eq. 3.3.11. Once the value of 
G'(V) is obtained, the detected de current can be obtained from 
Eq. 7.1.13, and the demodulated signal from Eq. 7.1.31.
Usually, practical back diodes appear to have large differential 
conductances G(V) = dl/dV at V = 0 or V = Vc where hot 
electrons or conduction band-to-conduction band drifting begins 
to occur, when compared with Schottky barrier diodes. In con­
trast, the second differential conductance G'(V) = d2I/dV2 is 
not as large. For example, in a commercial back diode at V = 0 V, 
G'(0) < 1.0 S/V, and at Vc = 400 mV G'(0.4 V) <; 8 S/V [4],
In microwave detection, one of the most important factors is 
G'(V) = d2I/dV2. As a result, heavily doped degenerate p-n

140 Microwave Autodyne and Homodyne Detectors 
homojunction diodes, which are common tunnel diodes [5], and 
heavily doped degenerate p-n heterojunction diodes [6] can be 
used as microwave detectors. For that matter, a common nonde­
generate p-n junction or BJT or FET can also be used for 
microwave detection as long as the junction capacitance, lead 
inductance, and spreading resistance or bulk resistance are small 
enough.
7.4 
Detector Circuits
Schottky barrier diodes, back diodes, or any other detector diodes 
can be mounted on a microstrip circuit or a waveguide circuit as 
shown in Fig. 3.5 and Fig. 3.6. It is important to tune out the 
diode susceptance, and this can be done by using tuning stubs or 
tuners. The diode susceptance is formed by the junction capaci­
tance, package capacitance, lead inductance, and lead and bulk 
resistances. When the detector susceptance is tuned out, detection 
by nonlinear conductance takes place. Higher sensitivity is ob­
tained under this condition. As seen in Figs. 3.5 and 3.6, it is 
important to have the rf choke and the de return through a de 
load or video load. In Figs. 3.5 and 3.6, for detector use, the de 
bias terminals are replaced by the detected output. The de load or 
the video load is connected to this detected output connector. If 
an external de bias is desired for the detector diode, the bias 
source is added in series with the de load or the video frequency 
load [3].
7.5 
Autodyne Detection and Homodyne Detection
Microwave autodyne detection entails the extraction of video 
frequency signals from microwave signals. The extraction is done 
by applying microwave signals to a nonlinear impedance. The 
nonlinear impedance is made of various kinds of semiconductor 
diodes such as Schottky barrier diodes, back diodes, and tunnel 
diodes. One of the most important parameters is the second 
differential conductance of the diode G'(F) = d2J/dF2. This is a 
key parameter in determining the conversion efficiency from micro­
wave signals to video signals. The conversion efficiency can be 
optimized by choosing a proper de bias voltage V for optimizing 
G'(F). In the case of homodyne detection, instead of a de bias, 
microwave signals of the same frequency as those to be detected 

Problems
141
will be used for the bias from a local oscillator. The strength of 
the bias microwave must be adjusted to optimize G'(K) for 
conversion efficiency optimization. The synchronization of the 
local oscillator signal to the incident microwave signal is also 
required for optimization. Both autodyne and homodyne detec­
tion are used for the envelope detection in microwave communica­
tion utilizing AM, ASK, and OOK type modulation. In homodyne 
detection, by adding a frequency tracking circuit to the local 
oscillator, FM, PM, FSK, or PSK type modulation can be handled 
for demodulation.
In microwave utility power transmission, autodyne detection 
is used for rectification. For better efficiency, the video resistance 
of the rectifier diode must be as small as possible.
In addition to seeking larger G'(V) values, the lead induc­
tance, lead resistance, junction capacitance, and package capaci­
tance must be made small enough to operate at microwave 
frequencies. For optimum operation, the diode must be impedance 
matched for both the microwave frequency circuit and the video 
frequency circuit. That is, the diode must be impedance matched 
at the video frequency of the video circuit, and it must be 
impedance matched at the microwave frequency of the microwave 
circuit.

Microwave Superheterodyne 
Detectors
8.1 Microwave Superheterodyne [1]
In Eq. 7.1.4, the detected current is
z(t) = G[»(t)] v(t)
This is for autodyne detection [1], Therefore, the only microwave 
signal being fed is at signal frequency ws and microwave signal 
voltage r’s(wst). Equation 7.1.4 can be rewritten as
*s(^s0 = 
(8.1.1)
If the differential nonlinear conductance G is controlled by a local 
oscillator voltage zz/w/t), then
z(wst,wzt) = G[zy(w/t)] tzs(wsz) 
(8.1.2)
This is for heterodyne detection [5], In heterodyne detection, the 
diode differential conductance is controlled by the local oscillator. 
If the local oscillator voltage impressed across the heterodyne 
detector diode is
v, = vlo cos (w/ + ip) 
(8.1.3)
and the incident microwave signal voltage or the microwave rf 
143

144 Microwave Superheterodyne Detectors
(radio frequency) voltage to be detected and impressed across the 
heterodyne detector diode is
vs = ysocos(“st + <#») 
(8.1.4)
then similar processes occur in the case of homodyne detection. 
Equations 7.1.35-7.1.40 will apply when both v, and vs are 
impressed across the heterodyne detector diode simultaneously. In 
Eq. 7.1.40, for practical cases, = us vlo = uloo. The hetero­
dyne detected current is therefore
7d ~ G'(K))^/cos[(wsz + <#>)“ (w/f + ^)] 
= G'(KJ^/cos[(ws - 
+ (<#>“ ^)] 
(8.1.5)
Id is called the heterodyne detected current [9], If = ws, it 
degenerates into homodyne detection, Eq. 7.1.40. The self-biased 
voltage Vo is, as in the case of homodyne Eq. 7.1.42,
(8.1.6)
77V2
The difference frequency between the microwave signal frequency 
fs = ws/2tt and the local oscillator frequency f, = W//277, which is 
/if = (ws — W/)/2t7, is called the intermediate frequency (IF). In 
this detection technique, the incident microwave signals are de­
tected by observing the intermediate beat frequency with the local 
oscillator. This detection, by taking the beat, is called heterodyne 
detection. If the beat frequency or the intermediate frequency is 
beyond audio frequencies, then the heterodyne detection is called 
superheterodyne detection.
At the detector diode, two frequency signals, one from the 
incident rf microwaves fs and the other from the local oscillator 
(LO), are mixed. The diode is therefore called the mixer diode. In 
practice, the mixer diode contains other frequency components 
and harmonics other than the intermediate frequency. Usually a 
filter is attached to filter out the intermediate frequency for use.
As seen from Eq. 8.1.5, the mixer, with the IF filter, is the 
subtractor for the frequencies. This is also called the down con­
verter, because microwave frequencies are converted down to IF. 
In addition, Eq. 8.1.5 shows that it is a multiplier for the ampli­
tude, and produces a high gain in detection. In homodyne detec­
tion, Id in Eq. 7.1.40 is de. A de current is generally difficult to 
amplify with high gain, low noise, and without interferences. In 
superheterodyne detection, Id in Eq. 8.1.5 is an intermediate 
frequency. The IF signals are easy to amplify using a high gain IF 
amplifier.

8.1 Microwave Superheterodyne
145
For example, /if = 30 MHz is one of many common frequen­
cies used as the IF signal in a microwave mixer. For example, if 
the incident microwave rf is /s = 9.376 GHz, then the local 
oscillator frequency ft = fs — fit = 9376 X 106 Hz — 30 X 106 Hz 
= 9346 X 106 Hz. If the incident microwave rf signal power 
Ps = —95 dBm = [logfp1 (95/10)]-1 mW = 3.16 X 10“10 mW = 
3.16 X 10“13 W = 0.316 pW, then the input voltage across the 
Zo = 50 Q line is
vs = y2PsZo = h x 3.16 x 1013 W x 50 Q
= 5.62 X 10 6 V
A 5082-2285 mixer Schottky barrier diode has low noise with the 
local oscillator power of 0 dBm [6], So for P/ = 0 dBm = 
1 mW = 10’3 W, and Zo = 50 Q,
v, = fop^ = h X 10 3 X 50 = 0.316 V.
This will develop a self-bias for the mixer diode. The self-bias 
voltage is obtained by the use of Eq. 8.1.6.

From the data sheet of the current-voltage curve for the 
5082-2200 series, G'(71 mV) » 7.5 mS/V [6], Then from Eq. 8.1.5,
|7d| = (7.5 X 10“3 S/V)(5.62 X 10 6 V)(0.316 V)
= 15.174 X 10 9 A
According to the specification sheet, the IF impedance at 0 dBm 
local oscillator power injection at 9.376 GHz for the 5082-2285 
diode is Zif « 100 Q. This means that the IF output voltage is 
vit = ZitId = 100 Q X 15.174 X 10 9 A = 1.5174 X 10“6 V. This 
means that at vs = 5.62 jaV, a 9.376 GHz microwave signal is 
converted down to vif = 1.52 jaV 30 MHz IF. The conversion loss 
Lc = 20 log rs/rit = 20 log(5.62 pV/1.52 pV) = 11.35 dB. The 
conversion loss can be decreased by increasing vt. For example, if 
P/ = 3 dBm instead of 0 dBm as it is in this sample calculation, 
then the conversion loss Lc « 8.35 dB. If P/ = 6 dBm, then 
Lc « 5.35 dB. However, according to the specification sheet, the 
noise figure is higher for this particular diode if the local oscillator 
power exceeds 8 dBm [6], For most commercial mixer diodes in

146 Microwave Superheterodyne Detectors
the 9-12 GHz range, the conversion loss is about 7 dB, and the 
noise figure is about 6-7 dB.
As seen from Eq. 8.1.5, the important parameters to increase 
the detected output are G'(VO) and vt. If the diode is chosen, then 
the local oscillator power injection Pl controls both G'(VO) and v,.
8.2 Microwave Superheterodyne through a Schottky Barrier Diode
The current-voltage characteristic of a Schottky barrier diode is 
expressed by Eq. 7.2.10
I = SR^' ^/k7'(eWk7> - 1) 
(8.2.1)
thus the conductance at any bias voltage V is, from Eq. 7.2.14, 
d2/ i q \2

7/^’ 
(8.2.2)
where
Is = SRT2e(“‘?^/kr) 
(8.2.3)
as defined in Eq. 7.2.11.
As seen from Eq. 8.1.6,
(8.2.4) 
77v2
The detected IF current is from Eq. 8.1.5
Id = G'(E)usuzcos[(ws - W/)f +(<#>- VO]
If the IF impedance is Zif 12, then the IF output voltage uif is
uif = /dZlf 
(8.2.5)
An example of a 5082-2285 Schottky mixer diode is given in 
Section 8.1. For this diode, as calculated in Section 7.2, using 
<?>b = 0.6 V, q/kT = 38.6 V’1 at T = 300 K, and R = 1.2 X 106 
A/m2-K2, and from Section 8.1, it was found that G'(F) = 
G'(71 mV) = 7.5 mS/V. From Eq. 8.2.2,
7.5 X 10 3 S/V = (38.62 V-2)/se(38-6 v~1)(71xl0~3 v)
Is = 7.5 X 10 3 S/V/38.62 (V 1) X 15.5
= 3.25 X 10-7 A

8.3 Microwave Superheterodyne by Back Diode

From Eq. 8.2.3,
S = E/RT2e(-^/kT)

This is the cross-sectional area of the Schottky junction. Assuming 
the equivalent depletion layer is d = 2 pm thick, the junction

This mixer diode has less contact area than the detector diode of 
the example presented in Chapter 7.
8.3 Microwave Superheterodyne by Back Diode
As seen from Fig. 7.6, in the neighborhood of zero bias, a back 
diode presents a large second differential conductance G'(VO). As 
seen from Eq. 8.1.5, this is an advantage for larger IF output 
current. As was explained in Chapter 7, the back diode is a lightly 
doped tunnel diode. The tunnel diode current is given by Eq. 8.3.1 
as
Id = qA f\v[l — fv(E)] fc(E)pv(E)pc(E) dE (8.3.1)
As seen in Fig. 3.1, under biased condition, Ev — Ec depends on 
bias. So the bias current of the back diode under the bias voltage 
Vo is, from Eq. 3.3.11,

(8.3.3)
The IF output current is, from Eq. 8.1.5,
Af = G'(^o)ysy/cos[(ws - w/)? + (<#»- V')] 
(8.3.4)
where Vo is determined by the local oscillator voltage v, as
For example, if the back diode presented in Section 7.3 is used as 
a mixer diode, then with the local oscillator power injection of 
0 dBm (10"3 W), 9.346 GHz produces 316 mV for vlo and 71 mV 
for bias voltage Vo across the back diode. From Fig. 7.6, at 71 mV 
bias, G"(71 mV) ~ 0. With additional de bias, the bias point should 
therefore be corrected to be 10 mV to maximize the value of G'(V). 
Referring to Fig. 7.6, G"(10 mV) « 0.33 S/V. If the incident 
microwave rf signal is —95 dBm (3.16 X 10"13 W) at 9.375 GHz 
with vs = 5.62 X 10"6 V, then the IF output current at 30 MHz 
is, from Eq. 8.3.4, Zif = (0.33 S/V(5.62 X IO"6 V)(0.316 V) = 
0.586 X 10"6 A. If the IF impedance of this back diode is Zif = 
50 fl, then uif = ZifZif = (50 fl (0.586 X 10"6 A = 29.3 X IO"6 V. 
The conversion loss is Lc = 20 log( i?s/i?if) = 201og(5.62 jiiV/29.3 
jitV) = —14.3 dB. In this case it is the conversion gain, rather than 
the loss. If the bias point is not optimized with any de bias 
correction, that is if Vo = 71 mV, then the conversion loss is a loss 
and it is higher. At any rate, this example shows that, if properly 
biased, the back diode can provide less conversion loss than a 
comparable Schottky diode mixer.
8.4 Microwave Mixer Circuits [2,3,7 -11]
The microstrip circuit shown in Fig. 3.5 and the waveguide 
configuration shown in Fig. 3.6 are applicable to the mixer circuit 
for microwave superheterodyning with a slight modification. The 

8.4 Microwave Mixer Circuits 149
input will be no longer a single frequency ws only. Both the 
incident signals of frequency ws and the signal from the local 
oscillator wz are fed through the same input to the mixer diode. 
The generated IF or beat frequency signals are taken out from the 
port which is used as a de bias supply port. At this point the RFC 
must pass at least the IF frequency. An external de bias may be 
fed through the same terminal. The first stage IF transformer will 
follow the IF output terminal. Though it is not commonly used, a 
regular tunnel diode is also usable as a mixer diode. In Figs. 3.5 
and 3.6, when a Schottky barrier diode or a back diode is used as 
a mixer diode, the tunnel diode must be replaced by those diodes 
mentioned. The stud length or screw tuner adjustment must be 
modified to tune out the susceptance of the mixer diode. Various 
mixer diodes have different admittances which are unique to every 
device.
The mixer diode mounted as shown in Fig. 3.5 or Fig. 3.6 can 
be arranged in microwave circuits as shown in Fig. 8.1 A, B, and 
C. In these figures, transmission lines such as coaxial lines, wave­
guides, and microstriplines are represented by line drawings. 
Transmission lines in 8.1 A and C can be coaxial lines, wave­
guides, or microstriplines. Transmission lines in Fig. 8.1 B are 
waveguides only.
In Fig. 8.1 A, the microwave signals of ws are directly fed to 
the mixer diode and the local oscillator output of wz is simultane­
ously fed to the mixer diode through a directional coupler. Both 
signals beat with each other and the IF current of wif = ws — wz 
will flow through the mixer diode. The intermediate frequency 
transformer (IFT) is connected to the diode as shown in Fig. 8.1 A. 
Both the primary and the secondary circuits of the IFT are tuned 
to wif. The heterodyned frequency is therefore emphasized and 
filtered out to the IF output terminal. This is a single ended mixer. 
No provision is made to suppress the electrical noise from the 
local oscillator.
In the balanced mixers as shown in Figs. 8.1 B and C, the 
local oscillator noise is suppressed. For example, in the hybrid 
T-balanced mixer shown in Fig. 8.1 B, the microwave input signal 
of frequency ws is fed through the E-arm of a waveguide hybrid-T. 
By the very nature of the hybrid-T, the signals of ws split into the 
collinear arm with opposite phase of each other and excite mixer 
diodes Dj and D2 which are mounted at equal distances from the 
junction [3]. Mixer diodes Dj and D2 are excited by the signals of 
ws at opposite phase to each other. The two mixer diodes are 
connected to the primary of an IFT. The signals of ws do not 
couple to the H-arm of the hybrid-T due to its operational

151
principle [3], The output from a local oscillator of wz is fed 
through the H-arm of the hybrid-T. The local oscillator power of 
frequency wz is split into the collinear arm in phase by the very 
nature of the hybrid-T and excites mixer diodes Dj and D2 
simultaneously [3]. Therefore the diodes are excited by the local 
oscillator in the same phase. By the design of the hybrid-T, the 
local oscillator power does not couple out of the E-arm [3]. Now 
both signals ws and the local oscillator power wz coexist in diodes 
Dj and D2. The IF signals wif = ws — wz are therefore generated 
in the diodes and flow into the primary winding of the tuned IFT. 
In addition, the diodes are connected in a push pull configuration 
for microwave signals and a push-push configuration for the local 
oscillator against the primary winding of the IFT. Therefore, at IF 
frequency wif, the signal is strengthened but the local oscillator 
noise is suppressed at the primary winding because the diodes are 
connected in the push-push configuration to the IFT and the 
local oscillator noise. The IF signals of wif are coupled out 
through the tuned secondary winding of the IFT. Thus, the 
balanced mixer has the advantage of local oscillator noise suppres­
sion.
Since the hybrid-T is usually made of three dimensional 
waveguides, it is not adaptable to a microwave microstripline 
circuit. In such cases, the configuration shown in Fig. 8.1 C is 
used. This is a hybrid ring balanced mixer. By the very nature of 
the hybrid ring, the microwave signals fed into junction 1 appear 
at junctions 2 and 4 due to equal phase path lengths, where mixer 
diodes Dx and D2 are mounted [3], The input signals excite diodes 
Dx and D2 in opposite phase to each other. Path length 1-2 is 
Xz/4 and path length 1-4 is 3/4Xz. This means that the waves 
traveling from 1 to 2 and from 1 to 4 have a phase difference of 
180°.
The local oscillator power of frequency wz is fed at the 
junction 3 as shown in Fig. 8.1 C. By the very nature of the hybrid 
ring, the local oscillator power appears at junctions 2 and 4 only, 
where Dj and D2 are mounted. Since junctions 2 and 4 are 
mounted at equal distances, from junction 3 respectively, both 
diodes Dj and D2 are excited by the local oscillator in the same 
phase. Both the incident microwave signals and the local oscillator 
power coexist in diodes Dj and D2. The IF current wif is therefore 
generated and fed into the primary winding of the tuned IFT 
which is connected to the two diodes Dj and D2. The generated 
IF current is coupled out of the secondary of the IFT. Again the 
diodes are connected in push-push from for local oscillator noise 

152 Microwave Superheterodyne Detectors
and push-pull form against the input signals. Thus the local 
oscillator noise is suppressed and the signals are intensified.
If the operating microwave frequency is in UHF or low 
L-band, the distribution parameter transmission line circuits as 
shown in Fig. 8.1 get inconveniently bulky and large.
For example, at fs = 30 GHz, the free space wavelength is 
Xo = 10 mm. If an alumina substrate of er = 10 is used as a 
microstripline circuit board, the transmission line wavelength Xz 
= Xo/ = 10 mm/ /W = 3.16 mm. Therefore, the hybrid ring 
size of Fig. 8.1 C can be developed on an area of less than 
3 mm X 3 mm. On the other hand, in UHF of 300 MHz, Xo = 
100 cm. Therefore with the same alumina substrate, Xz = 31 cm. 
This means that approximately 31 cm X 31 cm area of circuit 
board is needed to make the hybrid ring. This is too bulky and 
inconvenient. In UHF and L-band frequency applications, a 
lumped parameter approach is shown in Fig. 8.2 is therefore 
preferred. Fig. 8.2 A shows a schematic diagram of a balanced 
mixer and Fig. 8.2 B shows a schematic diagram of a double 
balanced mixer. In Fig. 8.2 A, both mixer diodes are excited with 
both the local oscillator (LO) power of frequency and the 
incident microwave rf signal of frequency ws. The beat frequency 
current of frequency wi{ is generated in the diodes. The IF voltage 
then appears across terminals A and C and it is coupled out 
through an IFT. Since the bridge A-B-C-D-A is balanced at 
wi{, there is no IF voltage across terminals B and D. Across 
terminals B and D, only the microwave rf voltage of ws exists. 
Since the local oscillator voltage is fed through the neutral point 
of the windings of the transformer, as shown in Fig. 8.2 A, as far 
as the local oscillator frequency is concerned, the local oscilla­
tor frequency potentials at B and D are equal to each other and 
the local oscillator potentials at A and C are equal to each other. 
This means that B and D are electrically tied together and A and 
C are electrically tied together even though these points are 
physically separated from each other. This means that branches 
A-B and A-D are connected in parallel to each other, and 
branches C-B and C-D are connected in parallel to each other, 
and also combined branches B-A and B-D and other combined 
branches C-B and C-D are connected in parallel to each other at 
the local oscillator frequency. In short, Dx and D2 are connected 
in a push-push configuration against the local oscillator power. 
Thus the local oscillator noise is suppressed. Since the bridge is 
balanced at the local oscillator frequency, the local oscillator 
power does not leak out through the transformers shown above. 
The local oscillator voltages across terminals B and D and A and

C are zero. At the microwave rf input signal frequency ws, the 
diodes Dj and D2 are connected in a push-pull configuration for 
the impressed voltage across terminals B and D, or alternatively 
activated for each successive and alternate half-cycle of ws. The 
same applies to these diodes at wif across terminals A and C also. 
The bridge is also balanced at ws, so there is no voltage across 
terminals A and C at ws. There cannot be any voltage across E 
and F at ws either. The conversion loss from microwave rf to IF 
can be further reduced by adding two more mixer diodes to the 
bridge circuit as shown in Fig. 8.2 B. This is a double balanced 
mixer. The principle of the double balanced mixer is almost 
identical to that of the balanced mixer. All four diodes carry 
current at ws, the beat frequency current at wif is generated, and 
the IF is coupled out of the IFT. All four diodes are equivalently 
connected back to back and are parallel to each other at These 
diodes operate in a push-pull configuration at ws and wif.
For example, an RMS 2 lumped parameter microwave UHF 
double balanced mixer is designed for /s or ft = 5 to 1000 MHz 
and IF = 0 to 500 MHz [7], This is packaged in a size 0.25 
in X 0.30 in X 0.2 in or 6.35 mm X 7.62 mm X 4.9 mm. If f. = 
500 MHz microwave UHF, the free space wavelength is Ao = 60 
cm. The longest dimension of the package is 7.62 mm/600 mm = 
0.013 of a wavelength. A properly packaged lumped parameter 
mixer saves space. Typical conversion loss of the RMS 2 is 
specified as 6.5 dB. At midband, the isolation between the local 
oscillator terminal to microwave rf input terminal is rated at 
35 dB and the isolation between the local oscillator terminal and 
the IF terminal is specified at 30 dB. This tiny surface-mount 
technology (SMT) package, contains everything shown in a 
schematic diagram of Fig. 8.2 B.
8.5 Microwave Mixing
The process of producing IF by beating incident microwave rf 
with the LO output is called microwave mixing. The beating is 
done through a nonlinear impedance. Semiconductor diodes such 
as the Schottky barrier diodes and back diodes are easily used for 
the mixers nonlinear impedance component. The nonlinear char­
acteristics of these diodes are considered to be a logic multiplier; 
thus beating occurs. Conversion from microwave rf to IF is not 
always positive. But this conversion loss can be easily compen­
sated by the usual practice of a high gain IF amplifier following

the mixer. One of the most important mixer diode parameters is 
the second differential conductance G'(V) = d2I/dV2. The larger 
the G'(V), the larger the IF output. Mixers can take the form of 
single ended, balanced, or double balanced mixers, depending on 
desired mixer performance. Conversion output and noise charac­
teristics are usually better in balanced mixers than single ended 
mixers. Balanced mixers are more complicated in design, fabrica­
tion, and tuning than single ended mixers. The mixers can be 
fabricated in a transmission line circuit using coaxial lines, wave­
guides, or microstriplines. These mixers can also be fabricated in 
compact lumped parameter circuits in the microwave UHF range.

If the cross-sectional area of the diode is S (m2), then the charge 
stored in the depletion layer is
Q = qNdSw = SpqNdE{Vo + KR) (9.1.13)
The differential capacitance or the dynamic capacitance C is 
defined as
substituting Eq. 9.1.13 in Eq. 9.1.14,
C = S^N^ -±-(Vo + Fr)-1/2
=
V 2(ro+ kr)
(9.1.15)
This dynamic capacitance at the junction, called the differential 
junction capacitance, as seen in Eq. 9.1.15, is nonlinear with 
respect to the reverse bias voltage VR. This diode, made intention­
ally sensitive to the bias voltage, is called the variable capacitance 
diode or the varactor.
For example, in a typical microwave silicon varactor, S = 50 jam 
X50 jam = 2500 jam2 = 2.5 X 109 m2, Nd = 2 X 1015 cm 3 
= 2 X 1021 m 3, q = 1.6 X 10 19 C, e = ereo = 11.8 X 8.854 X 
10“12 F/m = 1.04 X 10“10 F/m and Vo = 0.8 V at VR = 2 V.

160 Parametric Amplification
Then, from Eq. 9.1.15,
C = 2.5 X 10“9 m2
(1.6 X 10~19 C)(2 X 1021 m3)(1.04 X 10 10 F/m) 
2(0.8 V + 2.0 V)
= 1.9 X 10“13 F = 0.19 pF [1],
In most parametric amplifiers, the varactor is biased by a local 
oscillator power, which is called the pump power, in addition to 
de bias voltage VR. For example, if the local oscillator power is 
PLo = 30 mW to Zo = 50 fl, then the voltage across the 50 fl load 
is v, = /2Z^P[7 = ^2 X 50 fl X 30 X 10~3 W = 1.73 V. In this 
case, the minimum FR is VR = 2 V — 1.73 V = 0.27 V and the 
maximum VR is VR = 2 V + 1.73 V = 3.73 V. For VR , from 
K 
Kmax 
Kmin
Eq. 9.1.15, C = 0.31 pF. For VR , Cmin = 0.167 pF. This
x

x 
mill

means that when the local oscillator voltage swings between 
1.73 V and —1.73 V, the junction capacitance of the varactor 
diode changes from 0.31 pF to 0.167 pF with a g-point dynamic 
capacitance of 0.19 pF.
Equation 9.1.15 gives several suggestions for a varactor design. 
The value of the dynamic capacitance C can be adjusted by 
proper selection of S, Nd and e. A large value of C lowers the 
impedance of the diode and lessens the efficiency. A small value 
of C limits power handling capability. S' can be as small as 
10 /rm X 10 jam and as large as 250 jam X 250 jam. sr can be 11.8 
for Si, 16 for Ge, and 13.2 for GaAs [5],
The difference (Cmax — Cmin) is maximized also by maximizing 
S and e within reason. However, the ratio Cm.x/Cmin is a function 
7

of (Fo + VR + V,) and not a function of S, Nd, and e.
9.2 Parametric Mixing
From Eq. 9.1.15, the dynamic junction capacitance of a reverse
biased p-n junction is given by
(9-2.1)
If the reverse bias voltage VR is modulated by a local oscillator or

9.2 Parametric Mixing 161
a pump oscillator in the following form

(9.2.2)
where
KRo is the de reverse bias voltage,
up is the amplitude of the local oscillator voltage, which is called 
the pump oscillator of a parametric amplifier,
wp is the angular frequency of the pump oscillator, and
<f> is the initial phase angle of the pump oscillator output.

9.2 Parametric Mixing 163
In parametric amplifier technology, the difference frequency 
(wp — ws) is called the idler frequency.
"i = % - 
(9.2.10)
The magnitude of the idler frequency current is
(% ~ ^VsoVpCo
|Zl " 4(ro+rRo)
If the pump frequency wp is adjusted to
% = 2us 
(9.2.12)
then, from Eq. 9.2.10,
(9.2.13)
Substituting Eq. 9.2.12 in Eq. 9.2.11,
In addition to this current in the diode, the original signal circuit 
current
IGI = ^so 
(9.2.15)
is flowing as seen from Eq. 9.2.9. After adjusting
4>p = 
(9.2.16)
where n is 0 or an integer, the total current |zT| at ws is then
|zT| = Izjl + |zs| 
(9.2.17)
In a practical parametric amplifier circuit, the varactor is loaded 
parallel to both the microwave signal circuit ws and the idler 
circuit To increase the excitation efficiency, both circuits are 
usually tuned to their individual resonance frequencies so they do 
not interfere with each other except through the diode. If the 
quality factors of the signal circuit resonator and the idler circuit 
resonator are Qs and Q;, respectively, then the total current in the 
diode under resonance is
iMr = 
+ i/si/eT 
(9.2.18)
Substituting Eqs. 9.2.14 and 9.2.15 in Eq. 9.2.18,
I<t|r = ^[4(^ro)+<) 
(9.2.19)

164 Parametric Amplification
Under this condition, the voltage across the capacitance Co is
(9.2.20)
Then the voltage gain of this amplifier is
A = ^=
% 4(ro + uRo)
(9.2.21)
For example, if the same pump oscillator as shown in the previous 
example of 30 mW is used, the oscillator produces vl =1.73 V 
across the 50 fl line. If the same voltage is applied to a pump 
cavity of Qp = 200 to which the varactor is loaded, then the pump 
voltage across the varactor is t>po = vl^Q^ = (1.73 V)\/200 = 
24.5 V.
From Eq. 9.2.5, it is desirable that t>po ~ Vo + URo or URo ~ 
"Po — K = 24.5 V — 0.8 V = 23.7 V. The diode must be reverse 
biased 23.7 V for P/o = 30 mW operation. If the incident mi­
crowave signal is fs = 0.375 GHz, Ps = — 90 dBm = 
[logjQ1 (90/10)] 1 = 10 9 mW = 10 12 W, then the voltage across 
Zo = 50 fl line is us'o = >/2ZoPs = ^2 X 50 fl X 10 12 W = 10 X 
10 6 V.
If the input circuit resonator’s loaded Qs value is 200, then the 
voltage is stepped up to vV) = 
=10 X10 6 V X \/200 =
141.4 X IO 6 V. Now from Eq. 9.2.21, choosing Qx = 200, A = 
3 X 24.5 V /200/4(0.8 V + 23.7 V) + /200 = 17.6 = 
(20 log 17.6) dB = 24.9 dB. To obtain this gain, condition 9.2.12 
must be fulfilled. The local oscillator frequency must be adjusted 
to /p = 2/s = 2 X 9.375 GHz = 18.75 GHz. This type of amplifi­
cation, or the amplification through a variable junction capaci­
tance, is called parametric amplification.
In Eq. 9.2.9, the frequency (« + ws) is called the up-conver­
sion frequency. The voltage gain of the up-convertor is then, 
through a procedure similar to the one used to obtain Eq. 9.2.21, 
^up
Vp'foTp 
4(EO + URo)
(9.2.22)
where u is the magnitude of the voltage across the junction 
capacitor at the up-converted frequency (« + ws), and gup is the

9.2 Parametric Mixing 165
quality factor of the resonance circuit which is tuned at the 
up-converted frequency (wp + ws).
For example, if fs = 600 MHz, fp = 1.2 GHz, and Pp = 
10 mW = 10 2 W, then vp = /2PpZo = /2 X 10“2 X 50 = 1.0 V 
for a 50 £2 line. If the varactor is mounted in a resonator of 
1.2 GHz with Q = 200, then the voltage across the varactor is 
v„ = JQv' = 7200 X 1.0 V = 14.14 V. The de reverse bias re­
quired is then KRo = 14.14 V -0.8 V = 13.34 V. If 0up = 200, 
the conversion gain is, from Eq. 9.2.22,
(14.14 V)7200
A,m = 
--------------------- r = 3.53
up 4(0.8 V + 13.34 V)
= (20log3.53) dB = 10.96 dB
and the frequency is converted from /s = 600 MHz to f. + f = 
600 MHz + 1200 MHz = 1800 MHz.
In Eq. 9.2.9, the frequency (w — ws) is called the down-con­
version frequency. The voltage gain at the down-conversion fre­
quency is
_ ^out, down _ Vp/Qd 
, 
,
down“ vso 4(Fo+FRo) 
(9-2’23)
where Qd is the quality factor of the output resonator circuit 
which resonates at (wp — ws).
For example, if fs = 9.2 GHz and fp = 12.4 GHz, the down- 
converted frequency should be f — fs = 12.4 GHz — 9.2 GHz = 
3.2 GHz. For the pump oscillator in the previous example, Pp = 
10 mW, Qp = 200 and vp = 14.14 V. If Qd = 200 as in Eq. 9.2.23, 
the conversion gain is
14.14 V/200
^down ” 4(0.8 V + 13.34 V)
= 3.53 = (20 log3.53) dB = 10.96 dB
The pump power Pp = 10 mW necessitates the de reverse bias 
voltage of 13.34 V through the pump frequency circuit of Qp = 
200.
In this parametric mixing, the signal frequency w. and the 
pump frequency wp are mixed with each other through a nonlinear 

166 Parametric Amplification
junction capacitance C. The output is at the signal frequency ws 
through parametric amplification, at the sum frequency wp + ws 
through the up-conversion, and at the difference frequency (wp — 
ws) through the down-conversion [2], This parametric mixing has 
been viewed classically by the Manley and Rowe relationships 
[6,7], One of the latest alternative processes among many other 
possible versions is presented in this section [4,5,9-11],
9.3 Noise in Parametric Amplification
Noise in parametric amplifiers is considered smaller than other 
types of microwave amplifiers except for masers. This is the 
reason that parametric amplifiers are used when noise is critical as 
exemplified by preamplifiers for earth stations of a satellite com­
munication system or a radio telescope. In many cases, these 
amplifiers are mounted near the focus of large parabolic reflector 
antennas.
The voltage gain of a parametric amplifier across the junction 
capacitance is given by Eq. 9.2.21 and
(9.3.1)
The available noise input power to the amplifier is
Nt = kTAf (W) 
(9.3.2)
where T is the temperature of the input circuit, k is the Boltzmann 
constant 1.28 X 10 23 J/K, and A/ is the frequency bandwidth 
of this amplifier [3], Then the available noise output power due to 
the available noise input power is
N., - N.A1 -
+ krA/ (W) (93'3)
This is because A is the voltage gain. The power gain Ap = /I2. In 
addition, the amplifier itself generates noise and delivers the noise 
to the output. The available noise output caused by internally 
generated noise is thermal agitation noise and shot noise [4],
The parametric variable capacitance p-n junction has a leak­
age resistance R to which the junction capacitance C is consid­
ered to be connected in parallel. The thermal agitation noise

9.3 Noise in Parametric Amplification 167
(Johnson-Nyquist theorem) emf across the junction resistance R 
is
wRN = J4kTR A/ (V) 
(9.3.4)
The available noise power to a matched external load resistance, 
which includes the input resistance and the output resistance, is 
therefore
Rl = R W 
(9.3.5)
v RN
^oR = — = kTA/ (W) 
(9.3.6)
This noise power will be split into two parts, one going back to the 
input and the other going on to the load resistance. The noise 
power going to the load is
•X>RL = |kTA/ 
(9.3.7)
The diode is considered to be a noise current source of shot 
noise. The shot noise current is given by
zn = /2^A7 
(A) 
(9.3.8)
where q is the charge of an electron and Id is the diode current 
[4], This noise current flows back into the input circuit, out of the 
diode itself and into the output load.
In this equivalent circuit of noise current, to calculate the 
available noise under resonance, the condition 9.3.5 is met by
«ou. = 
= 2*l = 2R 
(9.3.9)
where J?out is the resistance of the output circuit, and J?in is the 
resistance of the input circuit, and both J?out and J?in are con­
nected in parallel with R. Then the available noise output is

In most parametric amplifiers
and
2(K + URJ
—------ — « 2 
(9.3.14)
VP
7d = 0 
(9.3.15)
Therefore, F in Eq. 9.3.13 is small. Usually F is about 2 or 3 dB 
or less. As seen from Eq. 9.3.11, if the amplifier is refrigerated, the 
noise will be decreased. Refrigerated parametric amplifiers are 
common in satellite communication systems and in radio tele­
scopes with the parametric amplifier at the focal point of the 
parabolic reflector.
In the example of the parametric amplifier presented in Sec­
tion 9.2, the amplifier has a gain of A = 24.9 dB at fs = 9.375 
GHz with the pump power injection PRo = 30 mW of reverse bias 
voltage of URo = 23.7 V and Qs = 200. Qs = 200 means that 
Q, = fs/Ms = 200 or A/s = /s/200 = 9375 MHz/200 = 46.9 MHz. 
Therefore, according to Eq. 9.3.2, at room temperature T = 300 K, 
the available noise input power to the amplifier is Ni = kTAfs = 
(1.38 X 10 23 J/K)(300 K)(46.9 X 106 s“x) = 1.94 X 10’13 W =

9.3 Noise in Parametric Amplification 169
0.194 pW. If this noise is amplified by the amplifier is A = 
24.9 dB, since this is in terms of power gain, Ap = log fo/^4/10) = 
log1“01(2.49) = 309.0 times. So the noise output is, according to Eq. 
9.3.3, Noi = 
= 0.194 pW X 309.0 = 59.95 pW. This is the
noise output of the parametric amplifier if the amplifier itself does 
not generate noise.
If the differential resistance of the reverse biased varactor 
diode is R = 10 kS2, then the noise voltage across the diode due 
only to the thermal agitation noise in the signal channel is, from 
Eq. 9.3.4,
uRN = ]4kTR bf
= (4 X 1.38 X 10 23 J/K • 300 K • 104 12 • 46.9 X 106 s’P2
= 88.1 X 10’6 V
The corresponding thermal noise power is, from Eq. 9.3.6,
AoR = kTA/ = 1.38 X 10 ’ 23 J/K • 300 K • 46.9 X 106 s 1
= 0.194 pW.
Only half of this power goes to the load. From Eq. 9.3.7, 
^>Ri. = Xr = 0.097 pW.
If the reverse leakage current is Id = (Vo + FRo)/J?R = 
(0.8 V + 23.7 V)/104 12 = 2.45 mA, then de dissipation power of 
23.7 V X 2.45 mA = 58.1 mW. Here it is assumed that R ~ Rr 
which is the de reverse resistance of the diode at that bias point. 
From Eq. 9.3.8, the shot noise current is zN = ]j2qld = (2 X 
1.6 X 1019 C X 2.45 X 10"3 A X 46.9 X 106 s’ 1)1/2 = 0.19 X 
10’6 A. A part of this shot noise current flows out the output 
circuit. From Eq. 9.3.10, the shot noise power that appears at the 
output circuit is, together with Eq. 9.3.9,
Ns=^RoutqId^f

From Eq. 9.3.11, the total noise power in the output circuit at 
resonance is therefore
PN = 
+ ^oRL + Ns
= 59.95 pW + 0.097 pW + 22.98 pW = 83 pW

temperature.
9.4 Parametric Amplifier Circuit
A simplified schematic diagram of a variable capacitance diode 
parametric amplifier is shown in Fig. 9.2. A variable capacitance 
diode or varactor is mounted in a rectangular cavity resonator as 
shown in Fig. 9.2. This cavity resonator is adjusted by a shorting 
plunger to resonate at the idler frequency. This is the reason that 
this cavity resonator is called the idler cavity. The idler frequency 
is the difference between the pump oscillator frequency and the 
incident signal frequency.
The pump frequency power is fed through a waveguide iris to 
the idler cavity. Impedance matching is accomplished by adjusting 
a tuning screw at the pump frequency. A similar arrangement is 
made for the signal frequency. If the pump oscillator is on and the 
signals are fed into the idler cavity, there will be parametric 
mixing of the incident signal and the pump frequency. Parametric 
mixing generates a beat frequency signal at the idler frequency 
which is stronger than the incident signal. The idler frequency 
power couples out of the iris and comes out to the waveguide 
where the incident waves are fed. In other words, if a small signal 

9.5 Parametric Diodes
171
is fed at the input signal frequency to the idler cavity, amplified 
large waves at idler frequency come out of the idler cavity. If the 
pump oscillator frequency is adjusted to exactly twice the input 
signal frequency, then the idler frequency is exactly equal to the 
incident signal frequency. The amplified signal is therefore at the 
signal frequency. The idler cavity must be tuned to the signal 
frequency. If the idler cavity is tuned at the difference frequency 
between the pump frequency and the incident signal frequency, 
the system is a down-converter. If the amplified output is at the 
difference frequency between the pump frequency and the inci­
dent signal frequency, the outpout screw tuner must be tuned to 
the difference frequency. If the idler cavity’s shorting plunger is 
adjusted so that the cavity resonates at the sum frequency of the 
pump and the incident frequencies, then it is an up-converter. The 
output screw tuner must then be tuned to the sum frequency. It is 
possible that the pump power may leak through the idler cavity to 
the signal frequency waveguide. Good waveguide filters are there­
fore needed to operate a parametric amplifier properly.
9.5 Parametric Diodes
Reverse biased p-n junction diodes present nonlinear capacitance. 
The diode is therefore a capacitive reactor. When the incident 
microwave signal is mixed with pump power at the nonlinear 
capacitor diode, depending on the tuning of the output circuit, the 
system becomes
1. a parametric amplifier of the incident microwave signals,
2. an up-converter for the intensified signals of the sum frequency 
of the incident microwave signal frequency and the pump 
oscillator frequency, or
3. a down-converter for the intensified signals of the difference 
frequency between the incident microwave signal frequency 
and the pump oscillator frequency.
The nonlinear capacitance is created by the widening of the 
depletion region of a p-n junction due to the reverse bias.
It should be noted that the junction capacitance considered in 
this chapter is the differential capacitance or the dynamic capaci­
tance. It should not be confused with the static capacitance Q/V. 
The dynamic capacitance is dg/dK
It should also be noted that the reverse diode resistance 
discussed in this chapter is not the static resistance 1^. It is 
the dynamic resistance or the differential resistance |dKR/ 

172 Parametric Amplification
d/R|p-R_p-R. If a p-n junction diode is reverse biased, the static 
resistance could be as high as 103 fi. The dynamic resistance 
under proper bias can be higher, as high as 104 Q.
The intrinsic resistivity of Si is 2.5 X 105 il-cm. For Ge it is 
only 43 fl-cm and for GaAs it is 4 X 108 fl-cm [8],
One feature of varactor parametric amplifiers is the low noise. 
The shot noise contribution over the amplified and transferred 
noise from the input is very small. This makes the noise figure of 
the parametric amplifier small.

10.1 Harmonic Generation by Nonlinear Junctions
A p-n junction is basically considered to be an “on-off” switch. 
When it is forward biased, it is “on” and when it is reversed 
biased it is “off”. Under this simplified consideration, when a 
sinusoidal voltage is applied across the diode as shown in Fig. 
10.1, the voltage is rectified. The rectified voltage is expanded by 
Fourier series. Fourier’s theory states that for a periodic function

Inspection of Eqs. 10.1.6, 10.1.7, and 10.1.8 shows that the voltage 
waveform as shown in Fig. 10.1 B contains a de component, a 
fundamental frequency, and even harmonics rapidly decreasing in 
magnitude with the order of harmonics. A frequency spectrum is 
sketched in Fig. 10.2. Usually the harmonic generating diode is 
mounted inside a cavity resonator which resonates at a desired 
harmonic to enhance the desired harmonic frequency. Band rejec­
tion filters are attached to suppress the undesired harmonics.
In reality, practical diodes are quite different from the ideal 
diode just discussed. The difference between the ideal diode and a 
practical diode is illustrated in Fig. 10.3. Due to the differences in 
the current voltage characteristic curve, the practical diode cur­
rent takes a complicated waveform as shown in Fig. 10.3 C. These 
waveforms are usually not describable by analytic functions. As a 
result, analytical integration of the Fourier coefficients 10.1.2 and 
10.1.3 is difficult, if not impossible. It has to be done numerically 
or graphically. If this is done, it will usually be found that 
nonideal diodes produce stronger harmonics than ideal diodes.
For example, in the extreme case of a nonideal diode in Fig. 
10.3, the current would approach a rectangular pulse train as 
illustrated in Fig. 10.4 A. The Fourier coefficients of this type of

Inspection of Eqs. 10.1.9 and 10.1.10 shows that the amplitudes of 
the harmonics decrease more slowly than in the case of the ideal 
diode as the order of the harmonic n is increased. Furthermore, 
odd harmonics are generated. In other words, the practical diode 
generates richer harmonics than the ideal diode. This sharp and

narrow rectangular pulse current train can be generated by a deep 
cut-in voltage and a sharp rise in the current-voltage characteris­
tic curve in the forward direction of the diodes as shown in Fig. 
10.3 B. If the diode has a deep cut-in voltage but the current rises 
gradually with the forward bias voltage as shown in Fig. 10.3 B, 
the diode current approaches the triangular pulse train as illus­
trated in Fig. 10.4 B. The Fourier coefficients of this triangular 
pulse train are found to be [1]

Inspection of Eq. 10.1.13 shows that the harmonics of higher 
orders of this triangular pulse train are not as strong as the higher 
harmonics of the rectangular pulse train. Ordinary p-n junction 
diodes, Schottky junction diodes, PIN diodes, varactor diodes, 
avalanche diodes, Zener diodes, back diodes, and step recovery 
diodes are alternatives available for microwave harmonic genera­
tion.

To maximize zz20, IOwt = tt/2 or wt = tt/20 and thus zz20 = 
zo/10t7. If this is an ideal diode, from Eq. 10.1.7 zz20 = 2zo/(20 — 
l)(20 + 1)t7 « zo/200t7. The rectangular pulse train therefore pro­
duces stronger harmonics. If f= 9.3 GHz, /20 = 186 GHz. For 
9.3 GHz, wT= 2tt or T= 2ir/2irf= l/f= 1/9.3 X 109 s1 = 
0.11 ns. ut = tt/20 means t = 77/(20 X 2 77/) = 1/40/= 1/(40 
X 9.3 X 109 s-1) = 2.69 ps.
When a20 = zo/10t7 the conversion loss is a20/io = 0.318 = 
201og100.0318 dB = —29.95 dB. If an ideal diode is used and 
wt = 77, then zz20/zo = 1/20077 = 0.000159 = 20 log100.000159 
dB = —75.97 dB. This means that, in terms of the voltage, if the 
input fundamental frequency signal voltage vo = 1 V, then for the 
pulse train diode, w20 = 0.0318 X 1 V = 31.8 mV and for the ideal 
diode, w20 = 0.000159 X 1 V = 159 pV. These are viable values in 
practical microwave engineering.
10.2 Step Recovery Diodes
A step recovery diode is a junction diode specifically designed to 
store carrier charge at the junction during the forward cycle and 
discharge it during the reverse cycle with a discharge current in 
the form of a sharp step function. A step recovery diode is made 
of a p-n junction with a reasonable amount of junction capaci­
tance [2], a p+-p-n diode with the p region used for charge 
storage [3], or PIN structure with the i region used for the storage 
of charge [4],
When the square wave voltage is applied to the diode as 
shown in Fig. 10.5 the diode current does not shut off immedi­
ately. As seen from Fig. 10.5 the reverse current will flow for a 
short period of time due to the stored charge accumulated in the 
junction during the forward cycle. The reverse current lasts only 
for a short period of time until the stored charge is exhausted. 
When the charge is exhausted, the diode opens circuits or sud­
denly goes into the off-state, as illustrated in Fig. 10.5. The 
off-state is the state that the diode is supposed to be in under the 
reverse bias condition. This is the reason that this type of diode is 
called the “step recovery diode” or the “snap off diode”. This step 
recovery transient is very fast. Recovery times in the picosecond 
range have been reported [3]. This fast transient is useful for short 
pulse generation and microwave harmonic generation [5], The 
discharge time of typical microwave diodes are reported to be 
0.5-10 ns [2],

If a sinusoidal emf

(10.3.1)
is applied to a step recovery diode as shown in Fig. 10.6 A, the 
current in the diode will have a waveform as shown in Fig. 10.6 B. 
The current waveform for the positive half-cycle is similar to 
Fig. 10.1 C. As a result, the frequency spectrum will be, from 
Eqs. 10.1.6, 10.1.7, and 10.1.8,
(10.3.2)
where io is the peak forward current. In the reverse half-cycle of 
the applied emf, the reverse current’s waveform resembles 
Fig. 10.4 B. According to Eqs. 10.1.12 10.1.13, and 10.1.14,

Eqs. 10.3.2 and 10.3.3

Comparing Eqs. 10.3.2. and 10.3.3, the step recovery diode pro­
duces richer harmonics than an ordinary nondegenerate p-n 
junction diode.
10.4 Harmonic Generation by Backward Diodes
By inspection of the current-voltage characteristics of a backward 
diode as shown in Fig. 7.6, the current waveform can be sketched 
as shown in Fig. 10.7. In these drawings, it is assumed that the 
fundamental frequency signal voltage is sufficient to go over the 
threshold forward voltage. For the positive half-cycle, the diode 
conducts for one short period of time when the input signals 
exceed the forward threshold voltage. At the reverse half-cycle, the 
diode is a good conductor. Therefore, the current waveform of a 
single backward diode takes a form as sketched in Fig. 10.7 B. 
This is a combination of Eqs. 10.1.9, 10.1.10, 10.1.11, and

takes a waveform illustrated by Fig. 10.3 C. This may be approx­
imated by a train of triangular pulse currents as shown by 
Fig. 10.4 B. The Fourier coefficients are then given by Eq. 10.1.12, 
Eq. 10.1.13, and Eq. 10.1.14. A variable capacitance diode, or 
varactor, which is presented in Chapter 9, is one of the most 
common nondegenerate p-n junction diodes used for microwave 
harmonic generation. If a combination of a sinusoidal voltage 
v = v{ sin wZ and a de bias voltage Kro is applied to the diode, then 
the total reverse bias voltage across the diode VT is
VT=Vo+Vro + v=Vo + Fro + sin wZ (10.5.1)
where Vo is the junction contact potential. The capacitance of a

As seen from this result, the varactor is useful for third harmonic 
generation. Inspecting Eqs. 9.2.7 and 10.5.5, respectively, it is wise 
to operate with the zero de bias voltage for a larger harmonic 
output if it is possible. Usually, the self-bias is developed across 
the diode when the fundamental frequency power is fed. As a 
result, it is impossible to create a condition = 0, unless a small 
capacitor is connected in series with the diode to block the flow of 
de current. In an actual varactor diode, for the forward half-cycle, 
the diode behaves like an ordinary nondegenerate p-n junction 
diode, and for the reverse half-cycle, it is a varactor. The actual 
frequency spectrum is therefore a combination of Eqs. 10.1.12, 
10.1.13, 10.1.14, and 10.5.5.
10.6 Microwave Harmonic Generator Circuit
Microwave harmonic generation is needed when
1. A high micro wave frequency signal is needed and there is no 
available economical fundamental frequency oscillator at the 
required frequency.
2. An accurate crystal controlled high microwave frequency signal 
is needed but no high frequency crystal at the required fre­
quency is available, or it is expensive.
A schematic diagram of a microwave harmonic generator 
circuit is shown in Fig. 10.8. In this figure, microwave power of a 
fundamental frequency f is fed through a coaxial line to a 
harmonic generating diode. The current in the diode contains 
microwave harmonic current and launches microwave harmonic 
fields into a waveguide cavity resonator which consists of a 
shorting plunger and a waveguide iris. The resonator is tuned at a

10.7 Microwave Harmonic Generating Diodes 189
desired microwave harmonic frequency. Through the iris, the 
harmonic signals are launched into the output waveguide. A screw 
tuner is used for matching the impedance of the harmonic. In this 
arrangement, the fundamental frequency signals do not enter the 
waveguide because the waveguide is made too small and is cut off 
to the fundamental signal wavelength [6,8-10],
Since the harmonic current is generated in the semiconductor, 
if the junction capacitance is significant and the lead inductance is 
not negligible, then the generated harmonic current is internally 
bypassed or short circuited and may not even be radiated into the 
waveguide cavity resonator. In the diode current equations in 
previous sections, the order of the harmonic n can mathematically 
be any desirable large number. This simply means the harmonic 
current may be generated in the junction but does not mean that 
it actually radiates the particular harmonic. Except for custom- 
made laboratory diodes, discharge times of commercial homojunc­
tion step recovery diodes are 50-450 ps and the minimum cutoff 
frequencies fc = 1/2^7?^ are 100-350 GHz, yet the actual oper­
ating frequency range is 1-20 GHz, with an operating output 
power range of 0.3-10 W, an order of harmonic n = 5-10, a 
junction capacitance Cj = 0.1-4.7 pF, and a reverse breakdown 
voltage of 20-100 V de [3,7].
For example, at / = 300 GHz, if C3 = 0.25 pf, the impedance 
of the junction capacitance is l/2irfCs = l/(2w 300 X 109 s-1 X 
0.25 X 1012 F = 2.1 fl. In order to couple 100 GHz energy out 
of the diode, the coupling of the diode to the cavity must be 
adjusted so that the diode couples at the low impedance location 
in the cavity. This is usually an extreme corner of a cavity 
resonator [6]. At any rate, the effective and efficient coupling of 
the diode to the cavity resonator with low junction capacitive 
impedance is not easy, if not impossible.
10.7 Microwave Harmonic Generating Diodes
Degenerate p-n junction diodes, nondegenerate p-n junction 
diodes, Schottky barrier diodes, heterojunction diodes, step recov­
ery diodes, tunnel diodes, varactor diodes, and any other non­
linear diodes produce harmonics. The principle of harmonic 
generation is explained as follows. When pure sinusoidal voltage 
of a fundamental frequency is applied across a nonlinear diode, 
the current is a nonsinusoidal periodic function of the fundamen­
tal frequency. Fourier expansion of a nonsinusoidal function 

190 Microwave Harmonic Generator Diodes
contains inherent harmonics of the fundamental frequency. Har­
monics are therefore generated. In addition to harmonics, as 
stated in Chapter 8, the nonlinear impedance can mix different 
frequencies. The fundamental and the harmonics can mix, and the 
harmonics themselves can mix with each other. At any rate, the 
beat frequencies coincide with the fundamental and its harmonics. 
The original harmonics and the beat frequencies usually have 
different phase angles with each other [1]. Therefore, if mixing 
occurs there is interference in phase angle in each spectrum of 
harmonics. At any rate, if a particular harmonic signal of good 
quality is desired, a good reliable filter is needed to reject unde­
sired signals.

11.1 Microwave Binary States of Diodes and Transistors
By controlling the bias voltage properly, any nonlinear semicon­
ductor diode can be placed in a binary state. For example, in a 
conventional nondegenerate PN junction rectifier diode, if the 
diode is forward biased, the diode is considered to be in an “on” 
state. When the bias is reversed, the same diode is considered to 
be in an “ofF’state. There is a particular diode which is specifically 
designed for switching on and off with microwave signals. One 
such diode is called the PIN diode. When this diode is forward 
biased the diode conducts microwave current. When forward bias 
is removed or reverse bias is given the diode is turned to the open, 
or off, state for microwaves [5-8].
Variable capacitance diodes or varactors which are described 
in Chapter 9 present relatively large capacitances at lower reverse 
voltages. At high reverse voltages, the capacitance becomes small 
and the diode is considered to be open. In this chapter, PIN 
diodes and varactor diodes are presented as microwave power 
controlling devices by putting them in the binary states of “off” 
and “on”. Applications of these devices for microwave switches, 
diplexers, step attenuators, and phase shifters are presented 
[10-13]. Microwave transistors can also be used for microwave

switching [6-9]. The switching mechanisms and the applications 
are presented in the following sections.
There are two categories of microwave switches: the on-off 
switch and the routing switch. No matter what category, the 
switching function depends on the binary state of the nonlinear 
component of the switch. The binary states are the low impedance 
state and high impedance state. These binary states are created by 
a bias in one way or the other. When the device is in the low 
impedance state, the microwave current flows through the device. 
When the device is in the high impedance state, very little micro­
wave current can flow through the device.
Some important characterizing parameters of on-off micro­
wave switches are, besides the working frequency range and other 
factors, the insertion loss and the isolation.
In the microwave transmission line, if the output of the 
transmission line is Po (W), keeping the input power constant, as 
well as when an on-off switch is inserted with the “on” state in 
the transmission line, and the power received drops down to Pon 
(W), then the insertion loss of this switch is defined as
Lins = 101og10 dB 
(11.1.1)
\ ^on /
Under the same conditions, if the switch is turned off and the 
received transmission power drops down to Po[[ (W), then the 
isolation of this switch is
Liso = 101og10
— 1
■^off ! dB
(11.1.2)
Typical insertion loss of a commercial switching diode is 0.9 dB 
per diode, and the isolation is 25 dB per diode, depending on the 
bias [3],
Another important switching parameter is the switching speed. 
The shortest transition time between the binary states is called the 
switching speed. A typical switching speed of commercial switch­
ing diodes is less than 2 ns [3]. This is not so fast if signals on the 
order of GHz are to be immediately and completely stopped. For 
example, during the switching time of 2 ns, a 10 GHz microwave 
signal will pass through 20 cycles. In other words, the period T of 
the frequency f = 10 GHz microwave is T = 1/(10 X 109 s1) = 
0.1 ns. If the switching time is t = 2 ns, then the number of cycles 
of microwave signals passing through before the switch opens is 
N = t/T = 2 ns/0.1 ns = 20 cycles.

11.2 Microwave Binary States of PIN Diodes 195
If the incident microwave power Po is 1 mW or 0 dBm, and 
when the switch is on Pon is 0.9 mW or 101og10(0.9 mW/1 mW) 
dBm = — 0.46 dBm, then the insertion loss of this switch is, from 
Eq. 11.1.1,
/ 1 mW \
L-n, = 101og10 ---------- = 0.46 dB
ins 510 ( 0.9 mW)
or
L,ns = 0 dBm - (-0.46 dBm) = 0.46 dB
If the switch is open and Po{{ = — 30 dBm = 10 3 mW, then 
from Eq. 11.1.2, the isolation is Liso = 101og10(l mW/10-3 mW 
= 30 dB. Po{{ = — 30 dBm = 10 3 mW is still significant power 
in many cases. The sensitivity of many microwave receivers is 
— 50 to —120 dBm or 10“5 to 10 12 mW. In order to obtain 
desirable isolation, multiple switching diodes or transistors are 
combined in a well-thought-out transmission circuit impedance 
design. If the switch is a routing switch rather than an on-off 
switch then, in Eqs. 11.1.1 and 11.1.2, Pon is the switch output of 
the on-route output and Po[[ is the switch output of the off-route 
output.

and is considered to be reasonably small at microwave frequen­
cies. There is no ideal i-type semiconductor. Most practical PIN 
diodes are made of silicon which is not 100% pure. Most practical 
PIN diode i-layers contain a small amount of n-type impurity, and 
are identified as n-type i-layers. It therefore conducts a small 
amount of de current under forward bias and an appreciable 
amount of microwave frequency current. Under reverse bias con­
ditions, the depletion layer punches through the i-layer and the 
junction capacitance is minimized. The conduction, dependent 
upon the minority carrier and the microwave reverse resistance 
7?R, is considered to be mostly made of bulk p+- and n + — layer 
resistance and ohmic contact resistance. The value of Rr and the 
small value of the reverse junction capacitance Cs make the 
microwave impedance under reverse bias high.
If the thickness of the i-layer is L (m), the cross section is S 
(m2), and the conductivity is a (S-m) under forward bias, then the 
microwave resistance of the i-layer R1 is given by
= 
(11.2.1)
So
Under forward bias superimposed by a microwave voltage, the 
carriers will be injected into the i-layer from both the n Mayer and 
the p Mayer. Electrons and holes injected into the i-layer will 
recombine there. If the mobility of electrons in the i-layer is p.n 
(m2/V-s), the electron density is n (m 3), the mobility of holes is 
p.p (m2/V-s), and the hole density is p (m3), then the conductiv­
ity is
° = q(.Pnn + MPP) 
(11.2.2)
In the i-layer, by the definition of holes, statistically
Mn ® MP = M

where p is the average mobility of the carrier.
The charge neutrality law requires that
n = p
then

o = 2qpn 
(11.2.5)

11.2 Microwave Binary States of PIN Diodes 197
Substituting Eq. 11.2.5 in Eq. 11.2.1,
The electron charge in the i-layer is then
Q = LSqn (C) 
(11.2.7)
If the lifetime of the electron in the i-layer is r seconds and 
the diode current is Io (A), then
e = V (C) 
(n.2.8)
Combining Eqs. 11.2.7 and 11.2.8,
LSqn = Ior 
(11.2.9)
Substituting Eq. 11.2.9 in Eq. 11.2.6, the microwave resistance of 
the i-layer under forward bias is then
£2
(11.2.10)
In practical microwave PIN diodes, the value of RT is on the 
order of 10-1 
[1]. This is on the same order as Rb, the
magnitude of the resistance in the bulk of p +- and n +-regions. The 
total microwave resistance under the forward bias is then
Rf = Rb + 
+ Ro 
(11.2.11)
The carrier mobility is on the order of 10 1 m2/V-s. The diode 
current on the order of 10 “3 A, and R o is the combined contact 
resistance and lead resistance. The thickness of the i-layer is on 
the order of 10“4 m. The contribution of the skin effect is 
considered to be small for forward resistance [1].
When the de bias is reversed, the depletion layer spreads 
throughout the i-layer and there will be reverse resistance in series 
with a small capacitance caused by the i-layer as shown in Fig. 
11.1. The microwave resistance under the reverse bias, Rr, con­
sists of the bulk resistance of the p+- and n !-layers Rb, the ohmic 
contact resistance Ro, and a small amount of 1?Ir, if any. The 
equivalent series resistance is due to dissipation loss in the carrier 
depleted i-layer
Rr = Rb + R+ R, 
(11.2.12)
This resistance is essentially linear. Therefore, RF in Eq. 11.2.11 

198 Microwave Switching Semiconductor Devices
and Rr in Eq. 11.2.12 are quite different. Inspection of specifica­
tion sheets for commercially available microwave PIN diodes 
reveals that, in most diodes, Rb + Ro are equal for forward and 
reverse and the values of these are on the order of 10-3-10° fl. 
Some high loss diodes have Rr much higher than RF [1-3],
The junction capacitance under reverse bias can be calculated 
based on the geometry of the i-layer.
= £o£rf 
(11.2.13)
Lj
Again, inspection of commercially available microwave PIN diodes 
reveals that the value of junction capacitance ranges from 10 1 to 
10° pF.
The microwave impedance of a reverse biased PIN diode is 
then
= 
(11.2.14)
«Cj
The order of magnitude computation of the impedance ZR at 
10 GHz is 103 — ylO3 fl. The binary states of a microwave PIN 
diode are then 10-1 fl when forward biased and 103 — ylO3 fl 
when reverse biased. These switching characteristics are useful for 
microwave circuit switching, attenuation, and phase control 
[5,10,13].
For example, the conductivity of intrinsic silicon is known to 
be a = (1/2.5 X 105) S//im. If the thickness of the i-layer is 
L = 100 fim and the cross-sectional area is S = 100 /xm X 100 
/im = 104 /im2, then from Eq. 11.2.1, the resistance of the intrin­
sic layer Rj is Rj = (100 /im)(2.5 X 105 fl-/im)/104 /xm2 = 2.5 
X 103 fl at zero bias or reverse bias.
Under the same condition, the electron mobility in intrinsic 
silicon is known to be /xn = 1350 cm2/V-s = 0.135 m2/V-s and 
the electronic charge q = 1.6 X 10 19 C. The resistance of the 
i-layer under reverse bias is, from Eq. 11.2.6,
100 /xm
Ri ~ 2 X 104/im2 X 1.6 X IO"19 C X 0.135 m2/V-s
= 2.3 X 103 fl
When the PIN diode is forward biased, the electrons in the i-layer 
are discharged to the anode and the diode current Io flows.

11.3 Microwave Switching and Multiplexing 199
The lifetime of electrons in the i-layer is known to be 100 ns in 
commercial PIN diodes [3], The forward current is 50 mA [3], 
Then, from Eq. 11.2.10,

(100 X 10 6 m)
A'F ” [(2 X 0.135 m2/V-s)(50 X 10“3 A)(100 X 10"9 S)]
= 0.074 O
As a result, according to Eqs. 11.2.11 and 11.2.12, the forward 
resistance RF can be on the order of 10° but the reverse 
resistance can be on the order of 103 
[3],
11.3 Microwave Switching and Multiplexing
The principle of microwave switching by the use of a PIN diode is 
illustrated by Fig. 11.2 A. This waveguide switch is basically an 
E-plane T [2,12], The PIN diode is mounted on the E-arm, one 
half wavelength from the junction. According to transmission line 
theory, the impedance of a lossless transmission line repeats the 
same value every half-wavelength [2,12], The PIN diode mounted 
physically one half-wavelength from the junction is therefore 
electrically the same as mounting the PIN diode right at the joint. 
The shorting plunger behind the PIN diode is a tuner that 
produces an inductance to create a parallel resonance with the 
diode’s junction capacitance when the diode is reverse biased. The 
parallel resonance produces a high impedance at the junction and 
the waveguide is therefore open circuited at the junction. When 
the diode is forward biased, the waveguide is practically short 
circuited making microwave transmission possible.
The input impedance of a short circuited transmission line of 
length I is given by
2 77/1
Z^yZ^an —

where Zo is the characteristic impedance of the waveguide and Xg 
is the waveguide wavelength [2,12], If the length I is chosen to 
produce a positive input impedance, then Z; is inductive,
Zj = j^L,

If 109 s"1, Q « 10 13 F, and RR ~ 103 fl, then |ZL| is on 
the order of 105 fl.
When the diode is forward biased, the forward resistance is 
10° fl. This is usually negligible with respect to the matched load 
which is on the order of 102 fl. Thus the waveguide switch is 
closed when the PIN diode is forward biased.
When the PIN diode is switched electronically using a switch­
ing circuit for a waveguide junction with many waveguide 
branches, multiplexing is possible by sequentially switching from 
one waveguide to another.
When two PIN diodes are connected back to back as shown in 
Fig. 11.2 B, the combination provides a limiter, or limiting switch. 
When a microwave signal is weak, as small as 10"18 W, the diode 
is practically open circuited as demonstrated by Eq. 11.3.9. The 
carrier depletion is throughout the i-layer of the PIN diode. 
Therefore, for either the positive half-cycle or the negative half­
cycle of small input signals, the diodes are practically open 
circuited. When the microwave signal is strong, as large as 104 W, 
the diodes are self-biased forward and the forward resistance RF 
is now in the range of 10 1 to 10° fl. The diodes are now switched 
to the closed state.
In Fig. 11.2, when weak signals come in from the antenna, the 
PIN diodes are open. Then the signals reach the receiver. When 
the transmitter is on, high power from the transmitter closes the 
diode switch, but the power goes to the antenna, not to the 
receiver. The receiver is protected by the PIN diodes, which act as 
limiters. This system is a microwave diplexer.
For example, a commercial 5082-3202 microwave switching 
PIN diode has a switching time of less than 5 ns, a forward 
resistance RF = 0.8 fl, a reverse resistance Rr = 8 fl, and an 
isolation Liso > 25 dB. The total capacitance, including the pack­
age capacitance and the junction capacitance, is CT = 0.32 pF. 
This diode is designed to operate up to 8 GHz [3], If the operating 
frequency of 7 GHz is chosen, then the free space wavelength is 
Xo = 3x 108 m/s//= 3 X 108 m/s/7 X 109 s"1 = 0.042 m = 
4.2 cm. If a microstripline of characteristic impedance Zo = 50 fl 
on an alumina substrate of er = 10 is used, then the transmission

11.3 Microwave Switching and Multiplexing 203
line wavelength Xz = Xo/ = 1.33 cm. The tuning transmission 
line length I is now obtained from Eq. 11.3.8.

= 0.2 cm,
or Xz/2 more can be added for ease of fabrication with the same 
impedance. Transmission line theory states that the impedance 
value repeats itself every Xz/2 [2,12], In this case, Xz/2 = 1.33 cm/ 
2 = 0.665 cm. Thus, I = 0.2 cm or I = 0.2 cm + 0.665 cm = 0.865 
cm.
In reality, the short circuited transmission line is inconvenient 
for the microstripline configuration. According to transmission 
line theory, if a Xz/4 long open circuited line is added, this 
configuration works the same as the original short circuited line 
[2,12], In this case, Xz/4 = 1.33 cm/4 = 0.33 cm. As a result, if 
the open circuited microstripline is used, then the tuning line 
length is either I = 0.2 cm + 0.33 cm = 0.53 cm or I = 0.865 cm 
+ 0.33 cm = 1.195 cm. At any rate, the maximum impedance at 
the diode is, from Eq. 11.3.9,
= y/1 + l/[2ff(7 X 109 s“1)(0.32 X 1012 F)]
X l/[2ff(7 X 109 s-1)(0.32 X IO12 F)] =602 fi.
This is considered to be high in comparison with Zo = 50 fi. If 
this is not high enough for some reason, then more than one PIN 
diode may be connected in series. This is easily done using 
monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) technology [5], 
Now this single PIN diode presents 602 and opens the trans­
mission line of Zo = 50 fi. This means that, from the input side, 
the input 50 line is terminated by an impedance of 602 
+ 50 
= 652 fi. According to transmission line theory [2,12], the

204 Microwave Switching Semiconductor Devices
voltage reflection coefficient at this open state at the input is then
(ZL + Zo) - Zo 652 - 50 
= 
------ o/------ o = ------------ =
H ZL + Zo) + Zo 652 + 50
The voltage transmission coefficient at this point is
t = 1 - p = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15
This voltage is further divided into 652 12 and 50 12. At the output 
transmission line, the voltage transfer coefficient across the 50 12 
output line is therefore
As a result, the power transfer coefficient is
Tp = Tv2 = (0.012)2 = 0.000144
Indeed, not much power can go through.
From the definition of Eq. 11.1.2, the isolation of the PIN 
diode switch is
L-o = 101oglo — = 101oglo ------------ =38.4 dB
1SO 
\Tp/ 
’ 0.000144 /
This is quite adequate for a single diode switch [5].
Now if the diode is in the “on” state, the diode presents 
Rf = 0.8 12 to the Zo = 50 12 output transmission line. The 
voltage reflection coefficient at the input side is then
(Rf + Zo)-Zo 0.8 12 + 50 12 - 50 12

The voltage transmission coefficient is then
r = 1 - p » 1 - 0.00179 = 0.9921
The voltage transfer coefficient from the input to the output of the 
switch is then
The power transfer coefficient is
rp = rv2 = 0.957

11.4 Microwave Step Attenuators and Phase Shifters 205
This means that 95.7% power goes through and only 1 — r2 = 1 
— 0.957 = 0.043 or 4.3% power is lost in the switch. According to 
the definition of Eq. 11.1.1, the insertion loss of this PIN diode 
switch is therefore

Lins = 101oglo - = 101og10 —- = 0.191 dB

This is considered an acceptable insertion loss for a single PIN 
diode.
11.4 Microwave Step Attenuators and Phase Shifters
The switching structure shown in Fig. 11.2 A can be applied to 
switch attenuators and phase shifters in a microwave system. 
Examples are shown in Fig. 11.3. In Fig. 11.3 A, when the PIN 
diode Switches 1 and 2 are on while Switches 3 and 4 are off, 
Attenuator 1 is in the circuit. When the PIN diode Switches 1 and 
2 are off while Switches 3 and 4 are on, Attenuator 2 is in the 
circuit. Attenuators 1 and 2 can be replaced by phase shifters, and 
the device becomes a step phase shifter.
A short circuited waveguide stub acts as a reactance. When it 
is inserted in a waveguide, it therefore works as a step phase 
shifter. A PIN diode controlled step phase shifter is schematically 
illustrated in Fig. 11.3 B. The phase shifter, or the reactance, is 
active when the diode is reverse biased. When the diode is forward 
biased, the phase shifter is out of the circuit.
In these attenuators and phase shifters, PIN diodes are em­
ployed merely for switching. The PIN diodes are also used as 
attenuation elements or phase shifting elements. The amount of 
attenuation or phase shift across the PIN diode depends on the 
bias voltage. By controlling the bias voltage, it is therefore possi­
ble to make a digital step attenuator or phase shifter or an analog 
attenuator or phase shifter. When a PIN diode is forward biased, 
the diode is an attenuator [13], When the PIN diode is reverse 
biased, the diode is a capacitive phase shifter [10], If a quarter­
wavelength transmission line is attached to this reverse biased PIN 
diode, the PIN diode quarter-wavelength loaded transmission line 
becomes an inductive phase shifter.
For example, with a commercial HPND 4165 PIN diode, the 
forward resistance changes from RF = 1000 2 to RF = 3 2, when 
the forward bias current changes from 0.01 mA to 3 mA [3], If this 
diode is mounted in series in a microstripline of characteristic

By changing the de forward bias current between 0.01 mA and

be used as a microwave attenuator [13],
According to the specification of the same PIN diode, the 
diode capacitance changes from C = 0.5 pF to C = 0.22 pF when 
the reverse bias changes from 0 V to 10 V [3]. The phase shift due

Examples of the way to actually realize these attenuators and 
phase shifters in microstrip configuration are shown in Fig. 11.4.
A surface mountable 5082-0001 PIN diode chip has a size of 
0.38 mm X 0.38 mm and is 0.11 mm thick [3], The diode is 
mounted in series with the microstripline of Zo = 50 Q, as shown 
in Fig. 11.4 A. The diode is biased through thin microstripline 
Xz/4 rf chokes. The Xz/4 rf choke consists of a high impedance 
thin microstrip Xz/4 in length and a capacitor pad. The capacitor 
pad forms an rf ground while the Xz/4 thin microstrip of high 
impedance (as high as 200 Q) presents an extremely high 
impedance at the T-junction to the 50 Q microstripline. This 
prevents the escape of microwaves into the de bias circuit. The 
distance between the T-junction and the diode chip is chosen to 
be Xz/4 to minimize reflections [2,12], When the diode is forward 
biased, it is an attenuator. When the diode is reverse biased, it is a 
capacitive phase shifter. By changing the bias voltage stepwise,

either a step attenuator or step phase shifter is made. At 7 GHz, if 
the substrate is alumina with er = 10, Xz/4 = 3.3 mm, as ex­
plained in Section 11.3.
To make an inductive phase shifter, a Xz/4 microstrip section 
must be attached to the diode and must be connected in series 
with the 50 fl microstripline as shown in Fig. 11.4 B. The Xz/4 
microstripline transforms the capacitance of the diode to induc­
tance at the microstripline input [2,12], The diode is reverse biased 
through an rf choke composed of a capacitor pad and a thin high 
impedance Xz/4 line as seen in Fig. 11.4 B. The other side of the 
diode must be short circuited to the low side of the microstrip. 
The ground plate near the low side microstrip of the Xz/4 trans­
former line must be etched away. The lower microstrip must be 
connected to the upper microstrip of the input microwave line 
through the substrate as shown in Fig. 11.4 B.
In these designs, if the impedance of the high impedance thin 
Xz/4 microstripline is 200 fl, a capacitive reactance of 5 fl would 
be sufficient for rf grounding. This means that 1/wC = 20 fl or 
C = 1/(20 fl)(277 X 7 X 109 Hz) = 1.13 pF. If the substrate is 
alumina with er = 10, the thickness is H = 0.5 mm, and the area 
of the capacitor pad is S m2, then C ~ eoeTS/H. So the area must 
be S' = C77/eoer = 1.13 X 10“12 F X 0.5 X 10"3 m/8.854 X 
10“12 F/m X 10 = 0.0635 X 10 4 m2. This means that S = 0.25 
X 10“2 m X 0.25 X 10 2 m = 2.5 mm X 2.5 mm or larger will 
fulfill the function of rf grounding.
The PIN diode can be mounted in parallel to the mi­
crostripline to make an attenuator or the phase shifter as illus­
trated in Fig. 11.5. If the diode is forward biased then it is an 
attenuator and if reverse biased, it is a phase shifter. As seen in 
Fig. 11.5, microwaves are fed through the bypass chip capacitors 
and the diode [13], The diode is biased through a Xz/4 microwave 
choke and a capacitor pad. If the microstrip’s characteristic ad­
mittance is Yo and the forward conductance of the diode is GF, 
then the current reflection coefficient at the input of the diode is
Yo+Gf- yo = gf

11.5 Microwave Switching by Transistors
Almost all types of microwave transistors are used for microwave 
switching. Both bipolar junction transistors (BJT) and field effect 
transistors (FET) are used for microwave switching. HEMTs are 
useful for high speed switching. For BJTs, the collector current is 
controlled by the base voltage. If the base-emitter is forward 
biased, then the transistor is on, but if the base-emitter is reverse 
biased, the carrier depletion region created at the base-emitter 
junction shuts off the collector current.
For an n-channel FET, when the gate is positively biased or 
zero biased with respect to the source, the channel is wide open 
and the drain current flows. The transistor is therefore on. When 
the gate is deeply negative, the channel gets narrow and pinched 
off by the negative potential on the gate. This makes the flow of 
drain current impossible. The drain circuit of the transistor is 
therefore open. By controlling the gate voltage, the FET can be 
turned off and on. The “on” state of microwave transistors can be 
connected in microwave circuits either in series or parallel and 
controls microwave current. The action of microwave transistor 
switches in microwave circuits is basically identical to the action 
of microwave diode switches, but for transistors the base voltage 
or gate voltage controls the action of the switch. Most commercial 
transistor switches use more than one transistor and are developed 
in the form of MIC or MMIC [6,9], These MMIC type microwave 
switches are used as on-off switches, routing switches, and 
microwave multiplexers and are commercially available. The isola­
tion and the insertion loss of microwave switching transistors can 
be treated similarly to switching diodes. The treatment is therefore 
not repeated here.
As a practical example, a KSW-2-46 MMIC GaAs transistor 
SPDT microwave switch has an insertion loss of 1 dB and an 
isolation of 50 dB between de and 4.6 GHz [6]. The entire switch 
is packaged in 0.185 in. X 0.185 in. X 0.06 in. or 4.7 mm X 
4.7 mm X 1.55 mm. The switching speed is specified as 2-3 ns, 
with microwave power handling capacity up to 27 dBm. The 
microwaves are turned on or off by a de control voltage of 0 V 
and -8.0 V [6],
As another practical example, a single GaAs MESFET used as 
a microwave switch will be presented. Using a transistor curve 
tracer, the output characteristic curves of the MESFET (Uds ver­
sus Ids) are obtained. From those curves, the differential resistance 
rds = (dl^s/d/ds) *s calculated for various values of Uds and Ugs.

rds = dVds/dIds, of a microwave GaAs MESFET 
for various values of the drain-source de bias Vds. 
Egs = —2.5 V (top) and Egs = 0 V (bottom).
An example is shown in Fig. 11.6. According to the curves of this 
n-channel GaAs MESFET, to turn it on K = 0 V is sufficient and 
to turn it off E. = —2.5 V is sufficient. As seen from this curve, 
though this particular FET is common for microwave amplifica­
tion, the resistance is high. This type of transistor is therefore 
useful only for high impedance circuit switching. For low 
impedance circuit switching, transistors of low differential resis­
tance must be used.
11.6 Microwave Switching
Microwave diodes and transistors are useful for microwave switch­
ing [7,8]. Switching can be simple on-off, routing, or multiplexing. 
The switching devices can be mounted in a microwave circuit in 
series or parallel depending on the desired switching characteris­
tics. The switching characteristics are controlled by a de bias on 
the switching device. The switching speed of most commercial 
solid-state microwave switches is on the order of ns. A number of 
cycles of microwave signals can therefore pass through before the 
switch is fully off when operating in high GHz microwave fre­
quencies. The switching devices can be applied to attenuators and 
phase shifters [10,11], The attenuation or phase shifting can be 
done within the semiconductor device, or the semiconductors are 
simply used for switching while the actual attenuation or phase 
shifting is done by a separate set of attenuators or phase shifters.

12.1 Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation
In a paramagnetic crystal such as a ruby or in an ionically bonded 
gas such as ammonia, it is possible to artificially create a situation 
in which the molecular density of high energy state molecules is 
greater than the molecular density of low energy state molecules 
[1,8,9], This state is called the density inversion. Creating the state 
of density inversion is called pumping. If the difference in energy 
of the higher energy state and the lower energy state of the 
molecules is AFp, the energy difference can be supplied by the 
pump oscillator by feeding or pumping photons into the system. If 
the photon frequency is / then, according to quantum theory,
A£p = VP 
(12.1.1)
where h is Planck’s constant and
h = 6.63 X 10“34 J-s 
(12.1.2)
For photon energy at microwave frequencies of approximately 
109 Hz, approximately 10“25 J energy is needed to pump the 
energy of a particle from the lower state to the upper state of the 
system. The particle can be an electron, an atom, or a molecule 
depending on the type of maser.
217

218 Quantum Electron Devices
In practice, the pump oscillator power is on the order of 
P = 10 2 W. If the energy transition from the lower level to the 
upper level takes t = 10 12 s, and the number of particles making 
the transition in t is N, then
P = Nhfp/r 
(12.1.3)
N = Pr/hfv 
(12.1.4)
In this example
N » (10“2 W)(1012 s)/10 25 J = 1011
particles that take upward transition in 10“12 s. This means that 
10 23 particles take upward transition in 1 s. The particles of higher 
energy states always have a tendency to make the downward 
transition, provided that such an energy state is quantum mechan­
ically allowable. Suppose that such a state is available at AES 
lower than the higher state. If the system is in a microwave cavity 
resonator of frequency fs with a small input power which satisfies 
the following quantum mechanical relationship:
A£S = VS 
(12.1.5)
Then the downward energy transition is triggered by the stimula­
tion from the input signal. This stimulation input signal and the 
microwave cavity resonator trigger a massive downward transition 
[9], The energy of transition is small, but the number of particles 
are sufficiently large and the transition takes place within a short 
period of time. When the particles in the higher energy state make 
the downward transition by stimulation given by Eq. 12.1.3, 
photon energy will be emitted. The energy of emission may be as 
small as 10“25 J but the number of particles which make the 
downward transition is large and the transition occurs within a 
short period of time. The emitted power is therefore sufficiently 
large to be used as a microwave amplifier. The emitted power is 
on the order of 10“10 W. Small stimulation power of approxi­
mately 10“13 W can produce the amplified output. This is the 
micro wave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation, or 
the maser.
If the emission of radiation from the maser is Pe = 10“10 W, 
and the number of particles making the downward transition is 7Vd 
in t = 10“12 s then,
Pe = Ndhfs/r 
(12.1.6)
Nd = Per/hfs 
(12.1.7)

12.2 Pumping 219
In this example,
Ad » (IO’10 W)(1O-12 s)/10~25 J = IO3
particles make the downward transition in 10“12 s or 1015 parti­
cles make the downward transition in 1 s to produce emission of 
IO10 W.
For stimulation, if Ps = 10“13 W is absorbed in the maser, 
then
^s = WsA 
(12-1.8)
Ns~Pj/hfs 
(12.1.9)
In this example,
Ns = (IO’13 W)(10’12 s)/10-25 J = 1
particle makes an upward transition in 10“12 s, or 1012 particles 
make upward transitions for stimulation to produce the emission 
of radiation each second.
In this example, 10 23 particles are pumped up from the lowest 
level to the highest level in one second. During the same time, 1012 
particles are stimulated from the second lowest level to the highest 
level. Also, during the same time, 1015 particles make downward 
transitions from the highest level to the second lowest level and 
emit amplified radiation. Thus, in this case, 1012 photons are fed 
into the system and 1015 photons are emitted at signal frequency 
in one second. The power gain is therefore 1015/1012 = 1000 or 
10 log 1000 dB = 30 dB.
Note that these examples show only an order of magnitude 
calculation rather than a precise, accurate calculation.
12.2 Pumping
If the energy level of the high energy state of the particles of the 
maser material is Eh and the energy level of the low energy state 
is E,, then 
'p

(12.2.1)
If the particle density in Eh is N£ and the particle density in E; 
is Nt* under the condition that neither pumping or stimulation is 
given, then
A* < N*

weight of level E,, k is the Boltzmann constant 1.38 X 10“23 J, To 
is the temperature of the maser material, and
A£p - £h - Elp
Equation 12.2.3 is simply stating that if wh ~ w,, then the number 
of particles in the higher energy state is less than the number of 
particles in the lower energy state.
Under the thermal equilibrium, some particles in the lower 
energy state make the upward transition spontaneously and some 
molecules in the higher energy state make the downward transi­
tion spontaneously [10].
Statistically, if the probability of occurrence of the upward 
transition is wz*h per unit of time and the probability of occur­
rence of the downward transition is per unit of time, then 
under thermal equilibrium, the number of particles which make 
the upward transition 
must be statistically equal to the
number of particles making the downward transition, which is
= 
(12-2.4)
When the maser material is pumped at an exact frequency given 
by Eq. 12.1.1, then
W/ph > w*h 
(12.2.5)
The upward transition probability under pumping can be repre­
sented by assuming a linear relationship as
W/ph = £Pp + w*h 
(12.2.6)
where £ is a proportionality constant and Pp is the pump power 
[2]-
Under steady state, with pumping and without stimulation,

(12.2.9)
This is the density inversion which means that, while pumping, the 
number of particles in the higher energy state is greater than the 
number of particles in the lower energy state. This relationship is 
opposite to Eq. 12.2.2. The density inversion is created by pump­
ing. Substituting Eq. 12.2.6 in Eq. 12.2.7

With greater pumping, the number of particles in the higher 
energy state that are available for maser action is greater.
For example, if A£p = 9.5 X 10“25 J, then the pump oscilla­
tor frequency / must be adjusted to
9.5 X 10“25 J
6.63 X 10“34 J-s = 1.4 X 109 Hz

This is 1.4 GHz. Since the energy of one electron-volt (1 eV) is

9.5 X 10“25 J
A£n = ------------- ---------  = 5.9 X 10“6eV = 5.9 ueV
p 1.6 X 10“19 J/eV
In practice, the value of wh and w, are in the neighborhood of 
unity. If wh = 1.01 and w, = 0.99,Pthen (wh/wz ) = 1.02. If the 
maser material is cooled to liquid helium temperature which is 
To = 2 K, then the thermal energy level is k£o = (1.38 X 10“23 J/ 
K)(2 K) = 2.76 X 10“23 J = 1.725 X 10“4 eV = 172.5 /xeV. As a 
result, the ratio A£p/k£o = 5.9 p.eV/172.5 p.eV = 0.034. The 
pump energy gap A£p is very small in comparison with the 
thermal energy k£o. It is wise to choose £z at a value far above 
the thermal energy k£o. If E, is chosen toPbe E, = 10 k£o = 10 
X 172.5 jtteV = 1725 /xeV, then £h = Et + A£p = 1725 /xeV +

In the example of Section 12.1, the number of particles which 
make upward transitions in 1 sec is 1023 s1 = w, hN,. Now 
w, h = IO-7 s-1, so N/ = 10 23 s-'/w/ h = 1023 s_1/10-7 s 1 =

In summary of this example, before pumping, = 0.986 X 1030, 
Nf = 1 X 10 30 particles, and after pumping started, Nh = 1 X 
1031, N, = 1 X 10 30. These sample calculations are to gain a 
quantitative understanding rather than to show accurate and exact 
cases.
12.3 Stimulation
Suppose that there is an allowable quantum mechanical energy 
state at E, for the maser material and E, is lower than Eh. The 

12.3 Stimulation 223
energy difference between Eh and E) is represented by
AES = Eh - Els 
(12.3.1)
If the microwave energy of Eq. 12.1.3 is fed to this maser material, 
some of the particles in E, will make the upward transition to Eh. 
The upward transition probability per unit time h is under a 
principle similar to Eq. 12.2.6,
w/sh = -nPs + “*h 
(12.3.2)
where y is a proportionality constant, Ps is the microwave input 
signal power, and wz*h is the spontaneous upward transition 
probability from energy state Et to Eh under the thermal equilib­
rium condition.
The number of particles which make the downward transition 
from Eh to Et per unit time is then, under a steady state 
condition with pump power on the input signal power feeding,
Miwh/S = ^/sh 
(12.3.3)
Substituting Eq. 12.3.2 in Eq. 12.3.3,
Miwh/S = ^Ps + <h) 
(12-3.4)
As seen from this equation, the presence of the signal power 
increases the number of particles which make downward transi­
tions per unit time. This process is called stimulation.
For example, if the frequency of a signal to be amplified by 
the maser is fs = 1 GHz = 1 X 109 Hz = 1 X 109 s-1, then AES 
= Eh - Els = hfs = (6.63 X 10“34 J-s)(l X 109 s1) = 6.63 X 
10 25 J = (6.63 X 10-25/l-6 X 10-19) eV = 4.14 /reV. In the ex­
ample of Section 12.2, Eh = 1730.9 /reV. As a result, Et = Eh — 
&ES = 1730.9 jueV — 4.14 /reV = 1726.25 /reV. This is a three 
level maser: Eh = 1730.9 /reV, E, = 1726.25 /reV, and E, = 1725 
/reV with a thermal noise level of kTo = 172.5 /reV.

Emission
When one particle in the upper energy level Eh makes the 
downward transition to Et, it loses energy AES in Eq. 12.1.3 and 
emits a photon hfs. If Ahwh/ particles as in Eq. 12.3.4 make the 
downward transition from Eh to Ez, the total number of photons 
emitted in a unit time is Nhwhl and the power emitted is
Po = 2Vhwh/AES = N^hlhfs (W) 
(12.4.1)
substituting Eq. 12.3.4 in Eq. 12.4.1,
Po = N,^PS + <h)Vs (W)

This shows a linear relationship between the input signal and the 
output signal.

the input signal power. If the proportionality constant is 77 then, in

This equation shows the contribution of the pump power and the

12.5 Gain
The gain of a maser is the ratio of the signal output power to the 
signal input power

Substituting Eq. 12.4.6 in Eq. 12.5.1, 
£P + W/*h
G = N>, P s-P (^s + ^h/s)¥s 
(12.5.2)
This equation shows that the gain G is a function of input signal 
level Ps. This means that the maser is inherently a nonlinear 
amplifier, especially at an extremely small signal level such that
(12.5.3)
If the input signal level is sufficiently high so that

Then, omitting wsh/ in Eq. 12.5.2,

G = N, P s p Ws 
(12.5.5)
P </P
This is not a function of Ps. The maser is therefore linear. The 
gain depends on P .
If the Ps is too high, rj in Eq. 12.5.5 becomes a function of Ps. 
In a large Ps, the available vacancies in Eh are quickly filled up 

226 Quantum Electron Devices
and hence wz h decreases. This causes a decrease in t] as seen from 
Eq. 12.4.5. This results in the saturation of the maser.
In the example shown in Section 12.3, it is shown that y = 
9.08 x IO’7 (W-s)1 and wshZs = 
= 1.009 x 10”17 s"1. So to

12.2.10,

However, this will not happen in reality. Condition 12.5.3 means 
the downward transition loses coherency and spontaneous transi­
tion takes over. There is no maser action when this happens.

7.8 dB
12.6 Noise
The reason for using a maser as an amplifier is due to low noise. 
Noise power emitted from a maser due to maser action can be 
obtained from Eq. 12.4.6. By letting the input signal power Ps = 0, 
any radiation coming out of the maser is considered to be noise 
power PN.
From Eq. 12.4.6 with Ps = 0,
%PD + w,*h
(12.6.1) 
P wwp s
As seen from this equation, spontaneous transitions represented 
by w*h, wsh/ and wsh/ are the cause of noise power emission [10], 
Besides this quantum mechanical noise, the maser emits thermal 
noise given by
Pt = kTB 
(12.6.2)
where k is the Boltzmann constant, 1.38 X 10“23 J/K.
T is the absolute temperature of the maser in K, and B is the 
frequency bandwidth in Hz. The frequency bandwidth of a maser 
is extremely narrow. For example, it is common that B is on the 
order of 105 Hz, at 1010 Hz operating signal frequency. Some 
masers are cryogenically refrigerated to 2 K, the temperature of 
liquid helium. This makes the thermal noise of the maser as low as 
10“18 W. If it is not refrigerated and instead operated at room 
temperature, 300 K, then the thermal noise is on the order of 
10“16 W.
The maser is a quantum mechanical device. The operating 
frequency must exactly fit into the quantum mechanical energy 
gap of the maser material as shown in Eq. 12.3.1. If Eh and Et 
are discretely defined, the operating frequency must therefore be

228 Quantum Electron Devices
exactly equal to
Eh~E,
.6.3)
The energy levels of an isolated single molecule in low pres­
sure gas masers are discretely defined. The bandwidth is therefore 
practically zero.
From Eq. 12.6.3,
E = A/=(l/A)A(Eh-Ej
= (^h + ^Ej-^-jAEj 
h
(Eh — |AEh) - (e, + |AEZ) AE. + AE,
- —---- ----- ----- (12.6.4)
h 
h
The spread of the energy level AEZ is called the line width. For an 
isolated single molecule, the linewidth is zero. The frequency 
bandwidth is consequently zero.
If the maser molecules are packed together in a crystal, these 
molecules interact with each other. The energy levels are no longer 
strictly discrete. The linewidth AEh, and AEZ appear by the 
mutual interaction of maser molecules.
In most practical masers, the thermal noise power is 
10-18-10~16 W or Pt = —150-— 130 dBm depending on the 
temperature.
In the maser investigated in Section 12.5, Eq. 12.6.1 is rewrit­
ten as
= N^shlhfs 
(12.6.5)
For the maser example presented in this chapter, 7Vh = 1031, 
wsh/ = 1.009 X 1017 s1 and AE = hfs = 6.63 X 10 25 J. Then 
PN = 1031 X 1.009 X 1017 s”1 X 6.63 X 10"25 J = 6.69 X 1011 
W = -102 dBW = -72 dBm.
This amount is not considered low noise for a maser. The 
quantum mechanical noise is much higher than the thermal noise. 
This is an example of hard pumping which makes 7Vh large, 
accounting for high quantum mechanical noise. If the pump 
power is reduced 20 dB, then PN = — 92 dBm.
This is still unacceptably high noise for a maser, which is 
supposed to amplify low level signals. Cutting the pump power 
down will cut the quantum mechanical noise down, but at the 
same time, it will cut down the gain. As a result, the gain and the 

12.7 Frequency Standard 229
noise have to be simultaneously considered to obtain optimum 
performance.
Now if B = A/=10 MHz, for example, from Eq. 12.6.4 
AEh + AE/s = h&f = 6.63 X 10"34 J-s X 10 X 106 s’1 = 6.63 X 
10 28 J. This should be compared with the transition energy gap 
A£s = 6.63 X 10“25 J. The total linewidth of combined linewidths 
on Eh and E, is only 1/1000 of the transitional energy gap AES.
If the power gain of the maser is G, the total noise output is 
the result of the amplified thermal noise kTBG, and the quantum 
mechanical noise PN is PNT, then
PNT = kTBG + PN
The noise figure of this maser is defined as
kTBG kTBG
For example, if a maser has a gain G = 30 dB = 103, T = 1 K, 
B = 107 Hz and PN = 10 12 W, then
10 12 W
F = 1 1----------------------------------------------------------
1.38 X 10"23 J/K X 2 K X 107 s 1 X 103
= 4.6 = 101og4.6 dB = 6.62 dB.
(12.6.6)
(12.6.7)
If PN is reduced to PN = 10 13 W, then F = 1.36 = 1.33 dB. 
If PN is reduced to PN = 10 14 W, then F = 1.036 = 0.15 dB. If 
the relationship
PNT — kT^BG
(12.6.8)
is forced, the equivalent temperature TN is called the noise 
temperature of the maser. Then
... 
1 NT
N ~ kGB
1 N 
kGB
(12.6.9)
PN is also called the additional noise. The quantity (PN/kGB) = 
7/ is called the excess noise temperature of the maser.
For example, in a maser, if PN = 10“13 W, B = 107 Hz and 
G = 30 dB = 103, then TB = 10 13 W/(1.38 X 10 23 J/K)(103 
X 107 sec1 = 0.72 K. If T = 2 K, then TN = 2 K + 0.72 K 
= 2.72 K.
12.7 Frequency Standard
As seen from Eq. 12.6.3, the energy gap between Eh and Et 
determines the maser signal frequency /. There are characteristic 
values for Eh — Et for each maser material. Thus, each maser

material has its characteristic frequency. The characteristic fre­
quency is distinctly defined by Eq. 12.6.3. Some examples of 
maser materials and the characteristic frequencies of maser mate­
rials are listed in Table 12.1 [2], The characteristic frequencies are 
so accurate that they are used for frequency standards and time 
standards, as exemplified by an atomic clock.
Most maser output is very small and is not used unless it is 
amplified. Straightforward amplification requires an extremely 
stable and accurate signal source to begin with. Since such an 
accurate signal source is not usually available, the straightforward 
amplifier is not generally utilized. Instead, a maser controlled 
oscillator, as shown in the block diagram in Fig. 12.1, is used as a 
standard frequency signal source. In this diagram, a small portion 
of the voltage controlled microwave oscillator signal is sampled 
through a coupler and is fed into the maser. The voltage con­
trolled oscillator can be any voltage controlled solid-state active 
diode or transistor oscillator. When the oscillator frequency coin­
cides with the characteristic frequency of the maser, the signals are

diagram.

12.8 Gas Masers 231
amplified by the maser and the output is detected, amplified, and 
fed into a tracking circuit to maintain the power supply voltage of 
the voltage controlled microwave oscillator as well as to maintain 
coincidence of the microwave oscillator frequency and maser 
characteristic frequency [3],
12.8 Gas Masers
As seen from Table 12.1, the majority of frequency standard 
masers are gas masers. Molecules of low pressure gas are reason­
ably isolated from each other without much interaction or cou­
pling among themselves, producing a well defined single line 
frequency spectrum. As an example of a gas maser, an ammonia 
maser has been selected [4], A schematic diagram of the ammonia 
gas maser is shown in Fig. 12.2. Low pressure ammonia gas at few 
mm Hg is shot out of a nozzle to an evacuated environment. The 
gas molecular beam is led to a molecular beam focuser. The 
ammonia molecule is a dipolar molecule which consists of one 
“positive” nitrogen atom and three “negative” hydrogen atoms. 
The electrical center of the nitrogen atom and the electrical center 
of the three hydrogen atoms do not coincide; thus, they form a 
molecular dipole. These electrical centers vibrate with each other 
at 23.870 GHz, creating an oscillating dipole. Some molecules will 
oscillate strongly and some molecules not quite as strongly, de­
pending on the quantum state of the molecular energy. In other 
words, some molecules are in a state of £h and other molecules 
are in a state of E,. 
‘s
When the ammonia molecules are led to the focuser, the 
focuser separates the Eh molecules and the Ej molecules by 
exposing the ammonia molecules to a nonuniform high electric 
field. The high electric field is created by a quadrupole structure.

232 Quantum Electron Devices
Molecules in the Eh state are pushed inward by the nonuniform 
field of the quadrupole structure and the E, state molecules are 
pushed outward [2], This causes the Eh molecules to focus and the 
Et molecules to diverge. The focused molecules are received by a 
cavity resonator shown in Fig. 12.2 and the diverged molecules are 
evacuated by a vacuum pump. The microwave cavity resonator is 
adjusted to resonate with the characteristic frequency of the 
ammonia molecules, 23.870 GHz. The majority of the molecules 
inside the cavity resonator is in the Eh state and fewer molecules 
are found to be in the Et state. This is the density inversion state 
which was explained in Eq. 12.2.10 [7,8], In this case, pumping is 
achieved by natural spontaneous thermal pumping while the gas is 
still in the tank. In fact, when the ammonia molecules are coming 
out of the nozzle, the density is not inverted. It follows the 
Boltzmann relation as shown by Eq. 12.2.3. The beam focuser 
selects the molecules and allows molecules in the Eh state into the 
cavity resonator [7,8], The cavity resonator is excited by the input 
signal. The input signals stimulate the molecules in the cavity 
resonator as explained in Section 12.3. The emitted radiation 
power expressed by Eq. 12.4.2 is enhanced by the presence of the 
cavity resonator [5],
Without the cavity resonator, em, the maximum microwave 
electric field strength associated with the emitted microwave radia­
tion Po, is, by Ohm’s law
em = /HX (V/m) 
(12.8.1)
where r?o is the wave impedance of the maser gas medium. If the 
quality factor of the cavity resonator is Q then, by definition, the 
maximum electric field strength is
e(m = ^Q^oPo (V/m) 
(12.8.2)
In many cases, masers do not work without a properly tuned 
cavity resonator. Most often the emitted field strength given by 
Eq. 12.8.1 is very small in comparison with the noise given by 
Eq. 12.6.1 for quantum mechanical noise and by Eq. 12.6.2 for 
thermal noise. The emitted fields are masked by noise and no 
coherent maser action is possible. On the other hand, if the cavity 
resonator is used, the emitted field strength at the quantum 
frequency given by Eq. 12.6.3 is strengthened, as seen from 
Eq. 12.8.2. The cavity resonator is considered to be a very narrow 
band pass filter. It therefore suppresses noise frequencies other 
than the resonance frequency of the cavity resonator.

12.8 Gas Masers 233
For example, in a microwave cavity resonator, if the quality 
factor Q = 10,000 is not uncommon, then /Q = 100. If a maser 
emitted to the vacuum a wave impedance of rio = 377 12, with 
emission of Pe = 10 10 W = —100 dBW = — 70 dBm without a 
cavity resonator, the electric field associated with this emission is, 
from Eq. 12.8.1, em = A X 377 12 X 10 10 W = 8.68 X 10 3 
V/m = 8.68 mV/m. If the cavity resonator is present, this field 
strength is stepped up by a factor of /Q = 100 or em = 8.68 
mV/m X 100 = 868 mV/m. For stimulation, if the input power 
of this maser is Ps = 10"13 W = —130 dBW = —100 dBm then, 
without the cavity resonator, the maximum field strength is
em = h X311QX 10"13 W = 8.68 X 10"6 V/m = 8.68 jiV/m
If the cavity resonator is present, this is boosted up to
em = A0,000 8.68 jiV/m = 868 jiV/m
In summary, the cavity resonator acts like a step-up trans­
former. Like a transformer, it can step-up the field strength but it 
cannot increase the power. The power is conserved but the energy 
associated with the field strength is increased. A resonator is 
capable of storing electromagnetic energy. This illustrates how 
effectively a cavity resonator helps stimulate maser action and 
strengthens the radiating electromagnetic fields of emission.
According to circuit theory, the quality factor of a resonator 
can be calculated from Q = f/bf, where f is the resonance 
frequency and A/ is the frequency bandwidth of the resonator. 
If f= 1 GHz = 109 Hz and Q = 10,000, then A/ = f/Q = 109 
Hz/104 = 105 Hz = 0.1 MHz = 100 kHz. This means that the 
cavity allows electrical noise within 100 kHz of the resonance 
frequency of 1 GHz but it rejects the rest of the noise spectrum. 
For example, if the emission frequency bandwidth without cavity 
resonator is A/o = 10 MHz = 10 X 106 Hz and the cavity fre­
quency bandwidth is A/= 105 Hz = 0.1 MHz, then the noise 
power within the cavity frequency bandwidth will be suppressed by 
the ratio A//A/o = 0.1 MHz/10 MHz = 0.01 = — 20 dB. If the 
noise power emission without cavity resonator is PN = — 72 dBm 
in the 10 MHz bandwidth, then with the cavity resonator the 
noise power is reduced to PN = —72 dBm — 20 dB = —92 dBm 
in 100 kHz bandwidth. The cavity resonator therefore helps to 
strengthen stimulation and emission of radiation and to suppress 
noise.
These calculations are again merely order of magnitude calcu­
lations to illustrate some quantitative aspects and calculation 

234 Quantum Electron Devices
procedures. It is therefore not necessarily exact, accurate, nor 
specific to any particular type of maser.
The emitted microwave power from the ammonia molecules in 
the Eh state into the cavity resonator re-stimulates the gas 
molecules by joining the newly fed input signals. This process 
repeats as long as the signals and the pump feed the activated 
ammonia molecules in the cavity resonator. The amplified mi­
crowave signals may be taken out from a waveguide which is 
coupled to the cavity resonator as shown in Fig. 12.2, or the 
output can be taken from the same waveguide as is used for the 
input. After microwave power emission, the ammonia molecules 
transfer from the energy state Eh to the state E,. Molecules in the 
lower energy state in the cavity will be evacuated from the cavity 
resonator by a vacuum pump. New high energy molecules are 
continuously fed into the cavity resonator through the nozzle and 
the molecular beam focuser. In this type of maser, the pumping is 
done thermally at room temperature and the molecular density 
inversion is accomplished by selectively focusing the beam of high 
energy molecules into a microwave cavity resonator.
12.9 Solid Masers
Paramagnetic crystals such as ruby or rutile are used for solid 
maser material [1]. An example of a solid maser, a ruby crystal 
maser, is presented in this section. A schematic diagram of a ruby 
crystal maser is shown in Fig. 12.3. A ruby crystal is basically a 
crystal of A12O3 with a small amount of Cr in it. A crystal of pure 
A12O3 is an alumina crystal which is white and transparent. When 
a small amount of Cr is introduced, the color ranges from pink to 
dark red, depending upon the amount of Cr impurity in the host 
crystal of A12O3. The more Cr atoms, the darker the color is. The 
color of ruby crystals used for the maser is usually pink. These Cr 
atoms, as an impurity in the pink ruby, are responsible for maser 
action. The Cr atoms in the host A12O3 crystal structure are 
paramagnetic. The total magnetic dipole moment of the Cr atom 
is specified by its quantum numbers [2]. The natural quantum 
energy state separation A£s of Cr atoms in the ruby crystal to 
satisfy Eq. 12.1.5 is in the optical wavelength of pink to red. For 
microwave frequency applications, it is necessary to create an 
artificial energy level separation A£s to fit the operating mi­
crowave frequency. This is accomplished by applying a magnetic 
field to the ruby crystal. As seen from Fig. 12.3, a magnet is

needed for the maser. When the Cr atoms in the A12O3 host 
crystal are magnetized, new energy levels are generated by the 
Zeeman effect as follows [1],
AE = Msgs$B 
(12.9.1)
Ms is the angular momentum quantum number of Cr atoms in the 
Al 2O3 host crystal, gs is the spectroscopic splitting factor which is 
related to the energy loss in the crystal, is the Bohr magneton 
which is a magnetic dipole moment due to the spin of an electron 
[6], and B is the applied magnetic flux density. Generation of 
energy levels by the magnetic field is called the Zeeman effect. 
These generated energy levels are called Zeeman energy levels. As 
seen from Eq. 12.9.1, the Zeeman level expressed by this equation 
is the relative energy increase or decrease with respect to the 
energy level with zero magnetic field. These energy splits are 
caused by the magnetic dipole moment of the Cr atoms in the 
A12O3 host crystal with respect to the applied magnetic fields. If 
the magnetic dipole moment of a Cr atom is parallel to the 
applied magnetic field, the atom is in the lowest possible energy 
state. If the magnetic dipole moment is antiparallel to the applied 
magnetic field, the atom is in the highest possible energy state. 
Between these two extreme states there are a number of energy 

236 Quantum Electron Devices
states available for the application of maser action. As seen from 
Eq. 12.9.1, the energy separation AES to satisfy Eq. 12.1.5 at 
microwave frequencies is available by simply adjusting the mag­
netic flux density B to produce AES to satisfy Eq. 12.1.5 for the 
signal frequency.
Since there are a number of other energy levels available, it is 
not difficult to find a third energy level which satisfies Eq. 12.1.1 
in conjunction with Eq. 12.2.3 and Eq. 12.3.1. The frequency of 
the pump oscillator must be tuned to satisfy Eq. 12.1.1 with pump 
power sufficient to produce sufficient density inversion between 
the level Eh and the level Ej. The pump power is fed through the 
waveguide shown in Fig. 12.3 into the cavity resonator. The signal 
power is fed through another waveguide as shown in the same 
figure. The cavity resonator is therefore a dual mode resonator, 
resonating at the pump frequency and also at the signal frequency 
in different modes [2,5], The cavity is designed so that the two 
modes are orthogonal to each other. The two modes interact with 
each other only in the ruby crystal when the maser action is 
activated. The input signals stimulate the density inverted pumped 
Cr atoms in the ruby crystal to make a massive downward 
transition. This downward transition emits the radiation of mi­
crowaves in the cavity in strength. The emission and incoming 
signals join to re-stimulate the Cr atoms in the crystal, which 
causes more emission of radiation. This process repeats and an 
equilibrium state is reached. The amplified signal is taken out 
from the same waveguide into which the input signals are being 
fed, as seen from Fig. 12.3.
In the maser, the useful energy gap A£s is smaller than the 
thermal noise energy kT at room temperature. At room tempera­
ture, A£s is masked by the noise and maser action is impossible. 
As a result, in a practical maser, as seen from Fig. 12.3, the maser 
is placed in a double dewer which contains liquid helium and 
liquid nitrogen. The liquid helium cools the maser as low as 2 K. 
To achieve this low temperature and to prevent evaporation and 
boiling loss of liquid helium, the maser is also cooled by liquid 
nitrogen at 77 K, as seen in Fig. 12.3.
For example, the Bohr magneton is known to be /? = 9.27

signals to be amplified, A£ = hfs = 6.63 X 10 34 J-s X 1 X 109 
s1 = 6.63 X 10 25 J. In Eq. 12.9.1, the quantum number of a Cr 
ion in A12O3 is known to be M} = 1/2 [6], The necessary mag­
netic flux density B to produce A£ = 6.63 X 10 25 J is depen­
dent on the direction of magnetic flux with respect to the crystal 
axis. In practice, B = 0.2 T is found to be adequate for 1 GHz

12.10 Masers
A feature of microwave quantum electron devices is that the 
interaction of electrons and microwaves takes place on bound 
electrons rather than free electrons. In transistors and semicon­
ductor diodes or, for that matter, in various thermionic devices, 
microwaves interact with moving carriers which are free electrons 
and holes. In quantum electron devices, electrons are bound. This 
is true even in gas masers. In gas masers, the gaseous atoms or 
molecules are moving, yet the interacting electrons are attached to 
the atom or molecule and never separate from their home parti­
cles. The orientation of the electron, atom, or molecule with 
respect to a reference axis determines the relative energy level of 
the electron, atom, or molecule. The transition of energy, upward 
or downward, simply means the orientation of the electron, atom, 
or molecule is changing to high energy state or low energy state. A 
maser can be an electronic maser, an atomic maser, or a molecular 
maser, depending on what kind of particles are emitting coherent 
radiation. The coherency of microwave radiation is created by a 
cavity resonator which resonates at the frequency of the emitted 
radiation due to quantum transition of the active particles. Inside 
the cavity resonator, there is a standing wave of microwaves. In 
standing waves, all electromagnetic fields are in phase or change 
in unison with respect to time, establishing coherency. The cavity 
resonator helps establish coherency and helps increase the effi­
ciency of stimulation and emission of radiation. The process of 
preparing particles for emission of radiation by feeding energy to 
them is called pumping. Pumping can be done coherently or 
incoherently. Coherent pumping is done by irradiating the parti­
cles by coherent radiation of a proper wavelength. Incoherent 
pumping can be done thermally by simply heating the particles 
involved.
Maser amplification depends on the particle density, inversion 
and dependency of the downward transition probability on stimu­
lation.

Ferrimagnetic Electron Devices
13.1 Ferrimagnetic Materials
Ferrimagnetic materials provide important parts in various mi­
crowave electronic systems [1]. Ferrimagnetic materials are used in 
tuners, filters, attenuators, isolators, circulators, modulators, 
switches, and shutters. In this chapter, practical aspects and basic 
theory of the interaction of ferrimagnetic materials with mi­
crowaves are studied, and principles of practical ferrimagnetic 
microwave circuit components are investigated.
Common ferrimagnetic materials used for microwave applica­
tions are ferrites and garnets. When ferrites and garnets are de 
magnetized and the microwave magnetic field h is applied perpen­
dicularly to the magnetizing de magnetic field, the induced mi­
crowave flux density b is not parallel to the magnetic field h. On 
the other hand, for ferromagnetic material, the microwave mag­
netic field h and microwave magnetic flux density b are parallel to 
each other whether the material is magnetized or not. In the 
magnetized ferrimagnetic material, the microwave magnetic field h 
and microwave magnetic flux density b are not parallel to each 
other. In the soft ferrite, if the magnetizing de magnetic field is 
removed and no residual magnetism exists, it then turns into 
pseudo-ferromagnetic material, or the microwave magnetic flux 
density b becomes parallel to microwave magnetic fields h [2], It is 
241

242 Ferrimagnetic Electron Devices
interesting to investigate why b is not parallel to h in de magne­
tized ferrimagnetic material.
13.2 Gyromagnetic Equations
The ferrimagnetic phenomenon is due to the precessing magnetic 
dipole moment of bound unpaired electrons in the ferrite material. 
For example, if the ferrite is Fe3O4, it contains unpaired electrons 
in Fe3+ ions. These unpaired spinning electrons are responsive to 
applied magnetic fields, both de and microwave. Since electrons 
are negatively charged, if they are spinning they can be considered 
tiny magnets. Each spinning unpaired electron has a magnetic 
dipole moment. For simplicity, if homogeneous ferrite is consid­
ered, there is a number of spinning magnetic dipole moments in 
the ferrite. When a de magnetic field is applied to the ferrite, the 
spinning magnetic dipole moments precess around the direction of 
applied de magnetic fields the way a tipping and spinning top 
precesses around gravitational fields. If the total magnetic dipole 
moment of precessing electrons per unit volume of the ferrite 
material is M A/m under the applied de magnetic field H A/m 
then, for a lossless system, the torque per unit of the magnetiza­
tion M, which is the total magnetic dipole moment per unit 
volume, is by the classical magnetodynamic principle
t = X H (m-N/m3) 
(13.2.1)
When the magnetization M is introduced, the permeability of the 
medium is considered to be |io as B = p.o(H + M). According to 
classical mechanics, the torque is equal to the time rate of change 
of the total mechanical angular momentum J.

z
t = — 
(m-N/m3) 
(13.2.2)
dt
where J (kg/s3) is the total mechanical angular momentum of 
precessing electrons per unit volume of ferrite material. The 
magnetization vector M and the angular momentum vector J are 
considered to be related by definition
M = yj 
(13.2.3)
The proportionality constant y is termed the gyromagnetic ratio.

13.2 Gyromagnetic Equations 243
Combining Eqs. 13.2.3 and 13.2.2,
Equating Eqs. 13.2.1 and 13.2.4,
dM
— = Moy(MxH) 
(13.2.5)
dt
This is the gyromagnetic equation for the magnetization of an 
ideal lossless ferrite. For a realistic ferrite with losses, modifying 
the Landau-Lifschitz equation, Lax and Button [1] introduced a 
gyromagnetic equation for ferrites with slight losses; modifying it 
further in the MKS unit system,
dM 
a dM
— = „(M x H) - X — 
(13.2.6)
where a is a damping constant for loss associated with the 
precession and M is the magnitude of the magnetization vector 
M. Equation 13.2.6 states that the loss term is proportional to the 
torque, which is a reasonable assumption for the first approxima­
tion.
Since the electron charge is considered to be negative, the 
magnetization vector M and the angular momentum density J are 
antiparallel to each other. The gyromagnetic ratio y, as defined in 
Eq. 13.2.3, is therefore a negative scalar quantity. The unit of the 
gyromagnetic ratio y is [(A/m)/(kg/s3)] = [A-kg/m-s3].
As far as the precession of the electron spin is concerned, if 
the angular velocity of the precession is wo (rad/s) then, accord­
ing to classical mechanics of precession,
t = wo X J

This means that for the lossless ferrite, a = 0 and wo is parallel to 
H since y is negative. For a lossy ferrite, a #= 0 and wo is still 
parallel to H. The reason is that — dM/dt is parallel to dJ/dt

and dJ/dt is parallel to wo. For a lossless ferrite,

where fo is the precession frequency (Hz).

This is an alternative unit of the gyromagnetic ratio; it is simpler 
than (A-kg/m-s3), previously presented. The unit (Hz/T) is more 
widely used in practice in MKS unit system.

Since H is antiparallel to dM/dt, depending on the sign of a, wo 
can be greater or less than If a < 0, then wo > |y||ao/f, 
noting that y < 0. If a > 0, then wo < |y|juo7Z.
For microwave operation, wo must be on the order of IO10 Hz 
to have some interaction with microwave frequency signals. For 
practical purposes, )jloH should be on the order of 10-1 T. This 
means that in most practical microwave ferrite devices

This is an approximate order of magnitude calculation. In a 
specific device, the actual value changes greatly depending on the 
specific type of ferrite material used, the geometry employed, and 
the magnitude of de magnetic bias and its direction to the crystal 
axis if it is a single crystal ferrite. For example, if a ferrite device 
is operated at 8 GHz under a de magnetic bias of 0.6 T, then the 
gyromagnetic ratio of this particular ferrite under this specific 
operation is

In Eq. 13.2.6, if both the de magnetic field Ho (A/m) and the 
microwave field h (A/m) are applied to the ferrite material at the 
same time, it can be expressed that
M = Mo + meJU' (A/m) 
(13.3.1)
H = Ho + he7"' 
(A/m)
(13.3.2)
where Mo is the de magnetization. The corresponding microwave 
frequency components are represented by me7"' and he7"' respec­
tively. Substituting Eqs. 13.3.1 and 13.3.2 in Eq. 13.2.6 and 
equating the microwave frequency components only,
jwm = Moy(Mo X h) - jioy(Ho X m) ->a(uz X m) (13.3.3)
where uz is the unit vector in the direction of Mo and Ho which is 
usually in the z-direction [1].
The magnetization vector m and the magnetizing magnetic 
field vector h are related by
m = Xh 
(13.3.4)

For lossless ferrites, a = 0. When the operating frequency w 
approaches wo, the susceptibility approaches infinity. This is the 
condition for gyromagnetic resonance and wo is called the gyro- 
magnetic resonance (angular) frequency. The loss term prevents 
the susceptibility from approaching infinity.

In other words, the ferrite is saturated in the z-direction. As seen 
from Eqs. 13.3.6 and 13.3.7, the susceptibility is a complex quan­
tity. It is therefore presentable in a general form

imaginary part represents the dissipative susceptibility.

It is interesting to note that the microwave magnetic field h, 
will not be affected by the presence of the ferrite material at all. 
This is mainly due to the assumption of Eq. 13.3.10. For a small 
de magnetic bias or zero de magnetic bias, there is appreciable 
coupling of hz to b unless it is intentionally made so that 
hz = 0 [2],
In order to obtain some practical and quantitative concepts, 
the following examples are presented. If a microwave power of 
P = 100 mW is concentrated in the crosssectional area S' = 1 
cm X 2 cm = 2 X 10~4 m2, then the magnitude of the Poynting 
vector P is P/S = 0.1 W/2 X 10“4 m2 = 0.5 X 103 W/m2. If the

13.4 Faraday Rotation
When linearly polarized electromagnetic waves are propagating in 
a de magnetically biased ferrite in the direction of the biasing de 
magnetic field, the direction of the polarization rotates as the 
waves propagate. The direction of rotation is the same regardless 
of the direction of propagation of the waves with respect to the 
direction of applied de magnetic bias field. The angle of rotation 
of the polarization is determined by the ferrite material, the 
amount of de magnetic bias field, and the operating frequency. On

the other hand, the rotation angle is independent of the propaga­
tion direction. This phenomenon was originally discovered by 
Michael Faraday on linearly polarized light propagating along an 
axially magnetized glass rod. This phenomenon of rotation of 
polarization due to an axially magnetized medium is called Fara­
day rotation. Faraday rotation can be explained using the perme­
ability tensor which is represented by Eq. 13.3.15. For simplicity 
of explanation, if the ferrite considered is lossless, then the damp­
ing parameter in Eq. 13.3.6 and 13.3.7 is zero,

As seen from Eq. 13.4.2 and Eq. 13.3.15, the diagonal perme­
ability is a real quantity and, as seen from Eq. 13.4.3 and 
Eq. 13.3.15, the nonzero off-diagonal permeability is an imaginary 
quantity. By custom, the diagonal permeability is represented by p. 
and the off-diagonal permeability is represented by jk. For the

This assumes the de magnetic field is applied in the z-direction 
as illustrated in Fig. 13.1. If the transverse magnetic (TM) mode 
of microwaves is fed along the z-direction parallel to the de 
magnetic field, the microwave field lacks the z-component by 
definition of the TM mode. Then only bx, by, hx, and hy exist.

It is interesting to note that the same ferrite presents different 
permeabilities depending on the polarization. For waves of posi­
tive circular polarization, the permeability of the ferrite is For 
waves of negative circular polarization, the permeability of the 
same ferrite is p~{{.
A trigonometric relation

states that a linear polarization cos wt consists of a positive

gating in the direction of the de magnetic field in the ferrites, the 
linearly polarized magnetic field consists of a positive circularly

magnetic field ^he~jwt. The same ferrite presents different effective 
permeabilities to different circular polarizations. For j/?e7“', 
and for |/?e~7“', If the phase constant of the positive circular 
polarization waves is jB+ and the phase constant of the negative 
circular polarization waves is ft , respectively, the propagating 
circularly polarized waves in the ferrite can be represented by the

stant [4],

The phase constants j8+, and /F are by definition the phase shift

This gives a reference to the amount of the phase shift. After 
propagating the distance L, the phase angles shift as shown in 
Eqs. 13.4.25 and 13.4.26, respectively. Since the field vectors F + 
and F“ are rotating in space, the reference phase angle shifts 0+

For a given geometry L and material e, y, the angle of 
Faraday rotation varies significantly with the applied de magnetic 
field Ho and the operating frequency wo. By selecting the material, 
operating frequency sample length, and the de biasing magnetic 
field, a wide range of Faraday rotation angles can be obtained.
In the sample ferrite presented in Section 13.3, from 
Eq. 13.3.27 and Eq. 13.4.12,
/re+ft = (4tt X 107 H/m)(13.1 - 11.4)
= 2.14 X 10 6 H/m 
(13.4.35)
From Eq. 13.3.27 and Eq. 13.4.16,
MZff = (4^ X IO’7 H/m)(13.1 + 11.4)
= 30.79 X 10’6 H/m 
(13.4.36)
Since Ho and wo are both parallel to the z-direction, the rota­
tional direction of wo or precession is equal to the positive 
rotation of h. As seen from 13.4.35 and 13.4.36, the ferrite shows 
low permeability for the positive rotation and high permeability 
for the negative rotation in the coordinate system shown in 
Fig. 13.1.
The permittivity of a ferrite e = eoeT varies widely depending 
on the composition of the ferrite. Some ferrites are metallic and 
some are dielectric. So if
£ = 2.5£O = 2.5 X 8.854 X 10 12 F/m
= 22.1 X 10“12 F/m 
(13.4.37)

256 Ferrimagnetic Electron Devices
For example, for f = 8 GHz, and L = 2 cm, from Eq. 13.4.25,
0 + =2ttX8x1O9Hz /22.1 X 10 12 F/m X 2.14 X 10"6 H/m

From Eq. 13.4.26,
0-=2ttX8X1O9Hz ^22.1 X 1012 F/m X 30.79 X 10 6 H/m
X 2 X 10”2 m = 26.23 rad 
(13.4.39)
Then the angle of rotation of the total magnetic field h, is from 
Eq. 13.4.30,
0 + -0 
6.91 rad - 26.23 rad
= -9.66 rad = -(2tt + 3.38) rad (13.4.40)
This means that vector h rotates clockwise one turn plus 3.38 
radians for 2 cm propagation in the z-direction. If the propagation 
direction is reversed, keeping all other directions the same, then 
the direction of rotation remains the same. The direction of 
propagation does not change or determine the direction of rota­
tion of a vector h. It always rotates clockwise in the geometry of 
Fig. 13.1. If the rotation direction must be reversed, the only way 
to do it is to reverse the direction of Ho. That is, if Ho is in the 
— z-direction, vector h rotates counterclockwise. The angle of 3.38 
radians is 193.66 degrees.
13.5 
Faraday Rotation Type Isolators
A microwave circuit component which permits microwave trans­
mission in one direction and absorbs the microwave power for 
reverse transmission is called an isolator. Isolators are used for 
stabilizing transmitters and oscillators against load variations. 
Some isolators are built based on Faraday rotation.
Equation 13.4.34, is derived assuming that the microwaves are 
propagating in the positive z-direction is seen from Eqs. 13.4.23 
and 13.4.24. Equations 13.4.8 and 13.4.13 hold regardless of the 
direction of propagation, as do Eqs. 13.4.12 and 13.4.16. These 
equations are basically rotation dependent but not propagation 
direction dependent. For reverse propagation, both Eqs. 13.4.25 
and 13.4.26 hold. Consequently, for reverse propagation, the Fara­
day rotation angle 0 is the same as for forward propagation and 0 
is given by Eq. 13.4.34.

13.6 Faraday Rotation Type Circulators 257
An important Faraday rotation type isolator is the 45° rota­
tor. The material, geometry, applied de magnetic bias, and the 
operating frequency range are carefully chosen to make the angle 
of Faraday rotation 0 = 45° according to Eq. 13.4.34. If 0 = 45° 
for propagation in the positive z-direction, it should also be 
0 = 45° for reverse propagation. This situation is illustrated in 
Fig. 13.3. The situation of the microwave electromagnetic field for 
forward propagation is shown in Fig. 13.3 A. The input and the 
situation for reverse propagation are shown in Fig. 13.3 B. Mi­
crowaves are fed so that their electric field vector e is perpendicu­
lar to the resistive film to avoid dissipation in the film. Maxwell’s 
equation and Poynting’s theory require that the vector e should be 
perpendicular to the vector h and the direction of propagation. 
The waves pass through the resistive film with small loss and 
encounter the ferrite rod which produces a 45° Faraday rotation. 
The waves pass through the ferrite rod with little loss. For reverse 
propagation, the microwave fields are fed with their electric field 
vector e in the same direction as cited before. According to the 
Poynting theory, the direction of the e vector, h vector, and 
direction of propagation follow the right-hand rule. Passing 
through the 45° ferrite Faraday rotator, the magnetic vector is 
now perpendicular to the resistive film and the electric field vector 
e is parallel to the resistive film. The microwave energy is there­
fore dissipated in the resistive film and does not exit. The forward 
insertion loss of an isolator is therefore mainly due to the loss in 
the ferrite and the reverse insertion loss is mainly due to the 
resistive film. Thus the reverse propagation experiences a large 
amount of loss. This is the principle of the Faraday rotation type 
isolator. Isolators are used for reverse isolation between the oscil­
lator and the load as well as interstage reverse isolation for 
multistage microwave amplifiers.
13.6 
Faraday Rotation Type Circulators
Assuming that there is an n-port junction, where n is an integer, 
and p is an integer less than n, if the microwave power is fed to 
the (p - 1)';' port, the output appears only at pth port. When the 
micro wave power is fed at the n‘h port, the output appears only at 
the first port, the n-port junction functions as a circulator.
An example of a 3-port circulator is illustrated in Fig. 13.4. A 
microwave field is fed to Port-1 of a rectangular waveguide with 
the electric field vector as illustrated in Fig. 13.4. The microwave

sion. B. Reverse transmission.
field exits from Port-2 through a 45° Faraday rotator. The micro­
wave field does not exit from Port-3 because Port-3 is the cutoff to 
the E-mode (Appendix 5). The E-mode exists when the electric 
field vector is parallel to the waveguide axis. When micro­
waves are fed into Port-2 with the electric field vector as illus­
trated, the output appears only at Port-3 through the 45° Faraday

13.7 Faraday Rotation Type Switches 259

rotator. The output will not appear at Port-1 due to the horizontal 
field cutoff (Appendix 5). When the microwaves are fed into 
Port-3 with the electric field vector as illustrated, the output 
appears only at Port-1 after traveling through the 45° Faraday 
rotator twice. The waveguide of Port-1 will not accept the horizon­
tal field. The horizontal fields go to the Faraday rotator and 
appear at Port-2 with 45° orientation. The 45° oriented electric 
field vector is horizontal to the tilted waveguide at Port-2 and the 
field is rejected. The rejected field reflects back through the 45° 
Faraday rotator and arrives as a vertical field at the waveguide of 
Port-1. The vertical field can come out of Port-1 only. It cannot 
come out of Port-3 due to the E-mode cutoff. The E-mode is a 
propagation mode which has a longitudinal E-component in the 
direction of propagation. This is the principle of the Faraday 
rotation type circulator. The circulators are used for microwave 
multiplexing and interstage reverse direction isolation for cascade 
microwave amplifiers.
13.7 
Faraday Rotation Type Switches
A Faraday rotation type distributor switch is illustrated in Fig.
13.5. The orientation of the input electric field vector can be 
rotated in desired different directions by properly adjusting the de

260 Ferrimagnetic Electron Devices
bias magnetic field by an electromagnet. When the electric field 
vector is oriented in the direction of ep the input waveguide is 
coupled mainly with the output waveguide-1. Faraday rotation 
type shut-off switches are schematically illustrated in Fig. 13.6. 
The de magnetic bias is supplied by an external electromagnet. 
When there is no de magnetic bias, microwaves transmit. When 
the de magnetic bias is on, the rotator is adjusted to be a 90° 
rotator. The electric field vector then rotates to the horizontal 
orientation. For the case of a shutter switch, as in Fig. 13.6 A, the 
waveguide is cut off to the horizontal field, so the waves reflect 
back instead of transmitting. In the case of the reflectionless 
shut-off switch as illustrated in Fig. 13.6 B, the horizontally ori­
ented electric fields are dissipated in the resistive film and do not 
reach the output waveguide. In this scheme, there is no reflection 
in the input waveguide if the switch is well designed and fabri­
cated.
13.8 
Field Displacement
The microwave magnetic field pattern in a rectangular waveguide 
is illustrated in Fig. 13.7 A [4], Careful inspection of the micro­
wave magnetic field pattern reveals that, for forward propagation 
as shown in Fig. 13.7 A, there is a clockwise rotating magnetic

field at the left-hand side of the waveguide. For reverse propaga­
tion, there is a counterclockwise rotating magnetic field at the 
same location. If a magnetically biased ferrite slab is placed in the 
waveguide, as shown in Fig. 13.7 B and C, the ferrite slab presents 
p+ff to the forward propagation and the same ferrite slab presents 
to the reverse propagation. As seen from Eqs. 13.4.12, 13.4.16, 
13.4.4, and 13.4.5,

262 Ferrimagnetic Electron Devices
If the operating frequency w is less than the gyromagnetic reso­
nance frequency |y|//o = wo, then
Meff > Meff 
(13.8.3)
This is the reason that the magnetic flux is attracted by the ferrite 
slab for reverse propagation and the magnetic flux is not attracted 
as much by the ferrite slab for forward propagation, as illustrated 
in Fig. 13.7 B and C, respectively. As seen from these figures, the 
microwave field pattern of a magnetically biased ferrite loaded 
waveguide changes depending on the direction of propagation. 
This phenomenon is called field displacement.
13.9 
Field Displacement Type Isolators
As seen from Eqs. 13.8.1 and 13.8.2, the effect of the field 
displacement is great if operated near w = wo = |y|Ho. Micro­
waves are attracted to the ferrite slab in reverse propagation. If 
the ferrite is a lossy material, it can produce appreciable reverse 
attenuation while maintaining a reasonably small forward loss. 
This type of isolator is called the resonance isolator. The reso­
nance isolator is considered to be a special type of isolator based 
on the field displacement principle, and it is appropriately called 
the field displacement type isolator. The resonance isolator is a 
field displacement type isolator operated at or near the gyromag­
netic resonance frequency.
If a low loss ferrite slab is employed or operated far below the 
resonance frequency to gain a wide bandwidth, the high reverse 
attenuation is not obtainable by the ferrite slab alone. A piece of 
resistive film is usually attached to the ferrite slab to absorb 
microwave fields attracted by the ferrite slab and thus produce 
sufficient reverse attenuation for practical applications. Without 
the resistive film, the ferrite loaded waveguide is basically a 
nonreciprocal phase shifter. The nonreciprocal phase shifter is 
called a gyrator if the forward phase shift is 2 n it and the reverse is 
(In + 1)t7, where n is zero or an integer.
13.10 Field Displacement Type Circulators
If a magnetically biased piece of ferrite is placed at a waveguide 
junction as shown in Fig. 13.8, this is a circulator. When the de 
magnetic field is in the direction which is out of the paper, the 
left-hand side looking into the direction of propagation is always

13.10 Field Displacement Type Circulators 263

propagation. C. Ferrite loaded waveguide, forward propagation.
and the right-hand side is fjQi, and Meff < /ieff. The waves 
usually couple toward the right-hand side waveguide as shown in 
Fig. 13.8. Thus the microwaves fed into Port-1 couple to Port-2; 
the microwaves fed into Port-2 couple to Port-3; and the micro­
waves fed into Port-3 couple to Port-1.
Similar explanations can be presented for the case of a micro­
stripline circulator shown in Fig. 13.9. A microstripline junction is 
placed across the magnetically biased ferrite disk. The direction of

264 Ferrimagnetic Electron Devices

a de magnetic field is in the direction out of the paper. If 
microwaves are fed into Branch-1, the waves tend to couple to 
both Branches-2 and -3. Observe carefully the time sequence of 
the microwave magnetic field vector h. When microwaves couple 
from Branch-1 to Branch-2, the h vector rotates clockwise. When 
microwaves couple from Branch-1 to Branch-3, the h vector 
rotates counterclockwise. At the left-hand corner of the junction, 
the ferrite disk presents p^ff and at the same time, at the right-hand 
corner of the junction, the same ferrite disk presents p^. As 
studied before, if operated under the condition Pgff < p7ff, the
Fig. 13.9 Microstripline circulator.

13.12 Ferrimagnetic Electron Devices 265
microwave field is attracted to Branch-2 rather than Branch-3. So 
the majority of microwaves couple to Branch-2 rather than to 
Branch-3. Microwaves usually couple to the right-hand side 
branches when looking into the direction of propagation if the 
ferrite disk is de magnetically biased in the direction out of the 
paper. So the microwaves fed into Branch-1 couple to Branch-2; 
the microwaves fed into Branch-2 couple to Branch-3; and the 
microwaves fed into Branch-3 couple to Branch-1. These circula­
tors are biased on the principle of field displacement. They are 
therefore called field displacement type circulators.
13.11 Field Displacement Type Switches
In field displacement type circulators, the direction of the de 
magnetic bias on a piece of ferrite determines the direction of 
coupling. If the magnetic bias is given by an external electromag­
netic, by simply reversing the excitation current of the electromag­
net, the coupling is switched from one waveguide to another. This 
explains the principle of a field displacement type microwave 
switch.
13.12 Ferrimagnetic Electron Devices
Isolators, circulators, gyrators, ferrimagnetic phase shifters, ferri­
magnetic attenuators, and ferrimagnetic switches are all micro­
wave ferrimagnetic devices [5-8], Their function is based on either 
Faraday rotation principles or field displacement principles. Both 
Faraday rotation principles and field displacement principles stem 
from precessing and spinning unpaired bound electrons of Fe3 + 
atoms under a de magnetic field [8], The directional properties of 
these devices are determined by the direction of de magnetic bias 
field. By controlling the direction of de magnetic bias field, the 
directional properties of the ferrimagnetic electron device are 
controlled.
For devices such as ferrite isolators, circulators, and switches, 
the descriptive parameters are isolation, insertion loss, power 
handling capacity, VSWR, operating frequency, and the frequency 
bandwidth. These characterizing parameters are defined in ways 
similar to those described in Chapter 11 for microwave switching 
diodes, and will therefore not be repeated here. In commercial 
devices, isolation more than 15 dB, VSWR less than 1.5, and 

266 Ferrimagnetic Electron Devices
insertion loss less than 1.2 dB are often considered acceptable. 
Some devices have wide bandwidths over many GHz yet the 
isolation is not as high. Some have a narrow frequency bandwidth 
and yet have high isolation and low insertion loss. Circulators and 
isolators are used for reverse isolation, multistage amplifiers, and 
microwave multiplexing.

Velocity Modulation Devices
14.1 Velocity Modulation Devices and Kinetic Energy Transfer
The process of producing a variation in the velocity of moving 
electrons by applied microwave electromagnetic fields is called 
velocity modulation. As seen from the definition, this phe­
nomenon and its underlying principles appear widely in published 
techniques of microwave electronics for both solid-state and 
thermionic devices. For simplicity, velocity modulation in 
thermionic devices will be considered. By slight modification, the 
same concept applies to solid-state devices.
Suppose that an electron of charge q coulombs and mass m 
kg is moving with the velocity u m/s in a vacuum and is 
accelerated by an electric field which is the gradient of the electric 
potential V volts. By the law of the conservation of energy, the 
kinetic energy 1/2 mu2 (J) must be equal to the potential energy 
qV (J) or
±mu2 = qV (J) 
(14.1.1)
Then velocity of the electron is

Note the sign of the microwave velocity. The velocity may be 
forward or backward depending on the phase angle u>t.
The acceleration of the velocity modulated electron can be 
obtained by differentiating Eq. 14.1.10.

As seen from this equation, there is no acceleration from the de 
potential Fo at this point, if Fo is uniform in space near the point 
of consideration. It is of interest to note that there is a 90° phase 
difference between the velocity and the acceleration. The accelera­
tion is more effective at a higher angular frequency w. Many 
microwave thermionic devices—such as klystrons, magnetrons, 
and traveling wave tubes—are made so that Fo is uniform in the 
space where the electron beam interacts with microwaves. Equa­
tion 14.1.12 is therefore applicable in most cases. On the other 
hand, in microwave solid-state devices such as microwave FETs 
and active microwave diodes, the de acceleration and velocity 
modulation are applied at the same time and space. Then both Fo 
and v are functions of the position of the interaction. If a one 
dimensional variation in the x-di recti on is considered, both Fo and 
v are functions of x. The velocity u is therefore a function of both 
x in space and t in time. Then the acceleration is

In practical microwave devices, the microwave potential v is 
produced by an externally applied voltage um across a pair of 
electrodes. The microwave potential v is proportional to the 
applied voltage v{. If the proportionality constant is k,
v = kUj 
(14.1.18)
This proportionality constant k is called the beam coupling coef­
ficient. Substituting Eq. 14.1.18 in Eq. 14.1.10,

u = wdl + ^^sinwt I 
(14.1.19)
The term (kUj/2JQ is called the depth of velocity modulation.
If the density of the electrons is N (m-3) and the cross section 
of the electron beam current is S, the electron beam current is 
then
I = qNuS (A)

274 Velocity Modulation Devices
The electron transit angle A0 is given by

(14.1.30)
where A/ is the electron transit time through the interaction region 
for velocity modulation.
For example, in practical velocity modulation thermionic de­
vices, the electron acceleration voltage is on the order of 103 V. 
The electron velocity is calculated from Eq. 14.1.2
uo
2 X 1.602 X 10 19 C X 103
9.109 X 10 31 kg
= 3.52 X 107 m/s
This is approximately 1 /10 the velocity of light in a vacuum. This 
is a typical value of an electron velocity for a microwave thermionic 
device.
If P = 10 mW microwave power is fed through a coaxial cable 
of Zo = 50 fi, then the peak voltage across the coaxial cable is 
P = v2/lZo or
v- = J2ZOP = 1/2 X 50 fi X 10 X 10“3 W = 1 V
If this microwave voltage is stepped up using a cavity resonator of 
Q = 200, then the available cavity voltage is
v = v-jQ = (1 V)/200 = 14.14 V
this compares with the de acceleration voltage Vo = 1000 V. The 
inequality 14.1.6 is therefore verified as
v
14.14 V
1000 V = 0.01414 < 1
According to Eq. 14.1.11, the amplitude of the microwave velocity 
is
3.52 X 107 m/s
um = --------- ---------- X 0.01414 = 0.249 X 107 m/s
This compares with the de velocity uo = 3.52 X 107 m/s. If the 
device is operated at frequency f = 9.5 GHz, then the amplitude 
of acceleration ao is obtained by Eq. 14.1.12 as

14.1 Velocity Modulation Devices and Kinetic Energy Transfer 275
This is an impressive amount of acceleration considering (v/Vo) 
= 0.01414 and v = 14.14 V.
Most velocity modulated thermionic devices are designed so 
that where microwave fields exist, there are no de fields. So, in Eq. 
14.1.16, Eo = 0. As for Em in Eq. 14.1.17, this depends on how 
microwave fields interact with the electron beam. If the microwave 
voltage of v = 14.14 V (peak value) exists across the cavity 
resonator and is directly applied to the electron beam longitudi­
nally across an interaction gap of g = 1 mm, then the microwave 
field strength at peak value is
v 14.14 V
E = - = ----- -— = 14.14 kV/m

This is significant field strength. Longitudinal means that the 
direction of the electron beam and the direction of the applied 
microwave electric field are parallel to each other. In practical 
velocity modulated thermionic devices, the beam coupling coeffi­
cient k is 0.75 or higher and never exceeds 1 by definition. If 
k = 0.8, the depth of velocity modulation is, from Eq. 14.1.19,
ku 
0.8

It is interesting to note that in spite of the impressively strong Em 
and large acceleration, the depth of velocity modulation is very 
shallow. This is due to short interaction time.
In medium power devices, the de beam current can be as high 
as I = 500 mA. The beam radius can be as thick as r = 1 mm. 
Then from Eq. 14.1.20, the electron density is

It is interesting to note that the electron concentration of 
thermionic devices is much less, a factor of 10”6 of the carrier 
concentration for solid-state devices.

276 Velocity Modulation Devices
According to Eq. 14.1.24, the amplitude of the microwave 
beam current is only
ky
= ---- 1 = 0.005656 X 500 mA = 2.83 mA
m 2Eo
This compares with the de beam current I = 500 mA. In the 
initial stage of velocity modulation, not much microwave beam 
current is induced in the de beam. According to Eq. 14.1.25, 
modulation of the beam consumes microwave power of
Pm = 
= 2 X 14-14 V X 2.83 mA = 19.99 mW
As seen from Eq. 14.1.25, this power is transferred in part from 
the de beam current Io. If Io is less, Pm is less. If Io is zero, Pm is 
zero no matter how much the input power P is.
The average microwave energy involved in the interaction 
space of the electron beam and microwave electric field is calcu­
lated using Eq. 14.1.27.

14.2 Bunching
If the velocity modulation shown in Eq. 14.1.4 is applied to a 
smoothly flowing electron beam as shown in Eq. 14.1.2, a modu­
lated beam current as shown in Eq. 14.1.23 is produced. This 
modulated beam current can be modified by dividing both sides of 
Eq. 14.1.23 or Eq. 14.1.21 by Squo,
(14.2.1)
Actually, I/quoS is the electron density of the velocity modulated 
beam, represented by n:
Combining Eqs. 14.2.1 and 14.2.2,
kuj
n = N 1 3-------sin wZ
(14.2.3)
This equation shows the density modulation explicitly. As soon as 
the electrons are velocity modulated at a particular location, 
density modulation is produced. This density modulation can be 
increased by the use of the electron bunching technique.
The electron beam with the velocity modulated beam is intro­
duced to a drift space. The drift space is a space of equipotential. 
In this space there is neither acceleration nor deceleration of the 
electrons. The electrons therefore maintain their initial velocity 
when they enter into the drift space.

The principle of binomial expansion has been employed in the

If the beam current at x = xr is /j and at x = x2 the current 
is I2, then the law of conservation of electric charge applied to the 
drift space between x = xr and x = x2 requires that the amount 
of charge entering at x = xr during AZj at t = Zj must be equal to 
the amount of the charge exiting at x = x2 during the time 
interval Az2 at t = t2, if no charge accumulation or depletion is 
permitted in the drift space. Then

Under a fixed system structure with constant de voltage and 
microwave voltage, the electron transit angle
A
0b = w— 
(14.2.16)
will determine the density modulation. Within the restriction of 
Eq. 14.2.11, the density modulation gets greater with a larger 
electron transit angle 0. Under constant system structure and 
constant voltage, the electron transit time ld/uo is fixed, so the 
higher the operating frequency, the greater the electron bunching. 
Under constant frequency operation, by adjusting uo, the bunch­
ing parameter can be increased or, by selecting x = x2 to make Zd 
greater, the bunching parameter is increased.
It is important to compare Eq. 14.2.12 with Eq. 14.1.23. The 
modulation term at x = x2 is 0 times greater than at x = xY, and 
this is the effect of electron bunching. Slow electrons that leave

280 Velocity Modulation Devices
x = Xj early are caught by fast electrons that leave x = xr later. 
Thus, at x = x2, electron bunching takes place.
In practice, the condition 14.2.11 is not always met. In this 
case, Eq. 14.2.10 can be expanded into a Fourier series and the 
definition of the Bessel function can be applied to it. When this is 
done,

where n is an integer, Jn(nXb) is a Bessel function of order n and 
argument nXb, and 9 is a part of the delayed phase angle from 
the modulation voltage to the microwave beam current at x = x2 
[1-5]. Equation 14.2.17 contains the Bessel function Jn(nXh). The 
Bessel function is an oscillatory function with respect to its 
argument. The function reaches its maxima at certain values of the 
argument nXb. This means that at a certain value of ld, there will 
be a maximum beam current, or there is electron bunching at that 
location. Beyond the value of the optimum ld, the current will 
decrease, or debunching takes place. This relationship will become 
clear if the fundamental frequency component of Eq. 14.2.17 is 
observed. For the fundamental frequency,
n = 1 
(14.2.18)
Then, from Eq. 14.2.17,
72 = 7jl + 2J1(Arb)cos(«f-0)] 
(14.2.19)
where 0 is again a part of the delayed phase angle of the 
microwave beam current at x = x2 from the modulating voltage 
at x = xv According to the table of Bessel functions, Jj( Xb) is an 
increasing function from zero to Xb ~ 2 for the first maximum. 
Beyond that point, the function decreases. It is also known from 
Eq. 14.2.17 that the velocity modulated and bunched electron 
current contains harmonics. The bunched electron beam can be 
used as a harmonic generator [6, 7],
Continuing the example presented in Section 14.1, to maxi­
mize the microwave modulated current, according to Eq. 14.2.19, 
J^Xh) must be maximized. According to the table of Bessel

This is a long device. At Xb = 1.8, JJ1.8) = 0.5815. Though this 
is not impractical, it is inconveniently long. If /d is made a 
manageable size of 15 cm, as in the case of a practical device, then 
Xb = 1.8 X 15 cm/178 cm = 0.15 and J/0.15) = 0.08. This 
means that by making the drift space 1.78 m/0.15 m = 12 times 
longer, the modulated current gets J1(1.8)/J1(0.15) = 0.5815/0.08 
= 7.3 times stronger.
If ld = 1.78 m is chosen then, according to Eq. 14.2.18, the 
magnitude of microwave beam current is
Im = 2IdJd(Xb) = 2ZoJ1(Arb) = 2 X 500 X 10 3 A X 0.585 
= 0.585 A
If ld = 15 cm is chosen, then
Im = 2 X 500 X 10’3 A X 0.08 = 0.08 A
As shown in Section 14.1, when the beam exits the velocity 
modulation region and enters the drift space, the microwave beam 
current is only Im = 2.83 mA. At the end of the drift space, for 
long devices, the microwave beam current grows to Im = 585 mA, 
which is 585 mA/2.83 mA = 206 times greater or 201og10 206 = 
46.3 dB microwave beam current amplification. For short devices, 
the microwave beam current grows by a factor of 80 mA/ 
2.83 mA = 28.3, which is 201og1028.3 = 29 dB microwave beam 
current amplification.
14.3 Dynamic Induction Current
If an electron beam is velocity modulated and bunched, the 
electron beam current is no longer smooth. The well established 
modulated beam current can be approximately described by
Ib = Io + Zsinwjt - -) 
(14.3.1)
where Io is the de beam current and the term Zsinwft — x/u)

tuating with the microwave frequency co if observed at a constant 
location x and the variation is moving with the electron beam 
velocity u m/s. If a pair of parallel grids with a very small gap 
between them is introduced perpendicular to the modulated beam 
current as shown in Fig. 14.1, the electron bunch in the beam will 
induce an electric charge on th grid by simple electrostatic induc­
tion. In Fig. 14.1, the amount of electron charge in the electron 
beam between x and x + Ax is, by mathematical manipulation,

where / is the separation distance of the grids as shown in 
Fig. 14.1. The amount of the induced charge on the grids is 
inversely proportional to the distance between the inducing charge 
and the grids. The amount of inducing charge A<2 is therefore 
distributed inversely proportionally to the distance to the grids in 
Eq. 14.3.6. If the two grids are electrically connected to an 
external circuit, an induced current of AgyAt A would flow.
Actually, the electron charge packet A<2 exists across the gap 
and induces the current AgyAt in the external circuit. The total 
induced current in the external circuit is therefore

It should be emphasized that this is the induction current in the 
circuit which is connected externally to the pair of grids. Io is the 
de current in the circuit which is the same amount of de current in 
the beam. In the circuit, there is the same amount of de current 
induced but this does not contribute to microwave current genera­
tion directly. In Eq. 14.3.11, l/u is the electron transit time across 
the pair of grids and ul/u is the electron transit angle across the

Then, from Eq. 14.3.11 and 14.3.12,

(14.3.12)
(14.3.13)
In this equation, koZ is the magnitude of the microwave current in 
the circuit, and I is the magnitude of the microwave current in the 
electron beam. Therefore, ko represents the ratio of the microwave 
current in the circuit to the microwave current in the electron 
beam. This is the reason that ko is called the beam coupling 
coefficient.
The microwave beam current I induces the microwave circuit 
current koZ. By reciprocity, the same beam coupling coefficient ko 
takes effect for the velocity modulation as shown in Eq. 14.1.18. In 
a phasor form, the microwave circuit current is represented by
i'm = V 
(14.3.14)
If the external circuit impedance across the pair of grids is ZL, 
then the induced voltage across the gap is
VUW.A 
(14.3.15)
Continuing the example of a velocity modulated thermionic 
device presented in Section 14.2, if I = 10“3 m, then the beam

According to Section 14.1, the microwave beam current in this 
device is Im = 2.83 mA when the de electron beam is velocity 
modulated at the beginning. After drifting for a while, for the long 
device, Im increases to 585 mA. The magnitude of the induced 

14.4 Klystrons 285
microwave current in the circuit is therefore, from Eq. 14.3.14, 
im = ko/ = ko/m = 0.75 X 585 mA = 438.8 mA
If the load impedance across the grids is ZL = 200 + jO S2 at 
resonance, then the microwave voltage across the grid is, from 
Eq. 14.3.15,
um = 
= 438.8 x 10 3 A x 200 0
= 87.75 V
As stated in Section 14.1, the velocity modulating voltage was 
v = 14.14 V. The voltage amplification is therefore vm/v = 
87.75 V/14.14 V = 6.2 times, or the voltage gain is 201og106.2 = 
15.9 dB.
For the short device,
um = l'mZL = 80 X IO’3 A X 200 0 = 16 V
In this case, the voltage amplification is
vm/v = 16 V/14.14 V = 1.13
and the voltage gain is
201og101.13 = 1.06 dB
14.4 Klystrons
A klystron is a microwave amplifying or generating vacuum tube 
invented by the Varian brothers [1]. This tube is based on velocity 
modulation, bunching, and dynamic induction [8-10]. The tube is 
capable of operating at high power with high microwave frequen­
cies beyond the solid-state microwave device range.
A schematic diagram of one of the most simple two-cavity 
klystrons is shown in Fig. 14.2. As seen from this figure, mi­
crowave input signals are fed into a cavity resonator which is 
called the rhumbatron to produce the velocity modulation voltage 
Uj across the pair of grids [1], The velocity modulation voltage v{ 
gives the de beam current velocity modulation as shown in Eq. 
14.1.23. Before the de beam current hits the first rhumbatron, the 
electron beam is smooth and there is no modulation in it. The 
electrons are accelerated by the de acceleration voltage Vo. After 
passing through the grids of the first rhumbatron, the electron 
beam enters the drift space. As seen in Fig. 14.2, the first rhum­
batron and the second rhumbatron are directly connected to each

other, with no electric field in this space. The electrons drift in this 
space and there will be no significant change in the velocity during 
the flight in this drift space. The drift velocity is equal to the 
initial velocity of the electrons when they leave the first rhumbat­
ron. After drifting some time, the electrons begin to bunch, 
forming the bunched beam current as seen from Eq. 14.2.17. This 
is the reason that the first rhumbatron is called the buncher. At 
the location where the bunched beam current is at its maximum 
value, a second rhumbatron is placed. By the principle of dynamic 
induction, the dynamic induction current, as seen from Fig. 
14.3.14, will flow in the rhumbatron circuit. The microwave volt­
age vm as seen from Eq. 14.3.15 is induced across the grids of the 
second rhumbatron and radiates out through the output wave­
guide. The second rhumbatron is called the catcher. Electron 
beams passed through the catcher rhumbatron are collected by a 
collector as shown in Fig. 14.2. If the klystron system is properly 
adjusted, it is possible to make vm > v{, a klystron amplifier. If the 
catcher and the buncher are connected by a positive feedback link, 
the klystron is an oscillator.
If the buncher admittance is T = Gg + JB&, then the input 
power is
Pi = jGgfiA* (W) 
(14.4.1)

where i>? is the complex conjugate of i\. This microwave input 
power produces the velocity modulation and the bunched beam 
current as shown in Eqs. 14.2.19 and 14.3.1. Comparing

Gain equations 14.4.12, 14.4.17, and 14.4.19 show that the 
gain can be optimized electronically by adjusting Vo, Io, w, and u 
or by optimizing the tube structure and circuit by adjusting ld, I, 
g, G&, and ZL. As seen from Eqs. 14.4.12 and 14.4.19, the gain is 
inherently a function of the operating signal level. The klystron is 
therefore a nonlinear amplifier. When the input signal is small 
enough to allow the approximation 14.4.14, the gain is approxi­
mately linear as seen from Eq. 14.4.16.
A power oscillator can be built by connecting the catcher 
rhumbatron to the buncher rhumbatron externally. If the transfer 
admittance from the buncher to the catcher is Ym, then the input 
voltage t5j at the buncher produces the catcher current Tmt\. The

output voltage is vm, and the output power available at the catcher 
is 
A portion of this is consumed by the load impedance
vmv*/2RL while another portion of the power at the catcher is fed 
back to the buncher. If the transfer admittance from the catcher 
to the buncher is Yt, then the microwave catcher voltage um at the 
catcher induces the buncher current ytum. The power fed back to 
the buncher from the catcher is then |(ytum)*ui. Then

The klystron is thus an electron tube based on velocity modula­
tion, bunching, and dynamic induction.
Continuing the examples presented in Sections 14.1, 14.2, and 
14.3, after tuning and matching the impedance of the buncher and 
catcher at f = 9.5 GHz, the buncher conductance Gg can be 
calculated using Eq. 14.4.1:

If the catcher has the same structure as the buncher, then RL =

From Eq. 14.4.11, the output power of the klystron with the 
long drift space is
Po == 2koPI /o2J12( Tb)

The power gain is, from Eq. 14.4.12, 
126.8 W
10“2 W = 12,680 
or 10 log1012,680 = 41 dB. The voltage gain is, from Eq. 14.4.17, 
Av = {A = ^12,680 = 112.6 or 20 log10112.6 = 41 dB. For the 

14.4 Klystrons 291
short drift space klystron,
Po = 2 X 0.75 X (104 fi)(0.5 A)2 X (0.08)2

Then the power gain is 
A = —

10“2 W = 2400
or 101og10 2400 = 33.8 dB. The voltage gain is Av = v/2400 = 49 
or 201og1049 = 33.8 dB.
When the electronic tuning, resonator tuning, and impedance 
matching are not perfect, the voltage gain will be a complex 
quantity or phasor as shown in Eq. 14.4.19.
The electron transit angle 0h across the drift space /d is, from 
Eq. 14.2.16, uld/u. For the long drift space device,

This is the phase angle of the phasor voltage gain in Eq. 14.4.19,
Q = 480 X 2tt rad + 143.17° + 90°

This is the phase angle which first appeared in Eq. 14.2.16. For the

Then

If the buncher and the catcher are connected by a feedback

as
If 1/R L is greater than the right-hand side of Eq. 14.4.38, then 
the demand of the load is greater than the klystron can supply. 
The oscillation then dies down. If 1/R L is less than the right-hand 
side of Eq. 14.4.38, then the load is too light and the oscillation 
builds up. When 1/R L is equal to the right-hand side of Eq. 
14.4.38, the oscillation is in its steady state.
In Eq. 14.4.38, Av is maximum when / = ItrN, where N is an

A positive feedback loop two-cavity klystron can be converted 
to a single cavity klystron as illustrated in Fig. 14.4. In this 
structure, the rhumbatron is a buncher for departing electrons. 
The departing electrons from the rhumbatron enter a decelerating 
field space since the reflector or repeller is biased negatively. The 
velocity modulated electrons enter the repeller space and, after 
reaching maximum penetration, these electrons are repelled back 
to the rhumbatron. By this time, the electrons are bunched and 
induce a microwave current as in the catcher rhumbatron of a 
klystron. Thus, the rhumbatron in Fig. 14.4 plays the role of the 
buncher for departing electrons and also plays the role of the 
catcher for bunched returning electrons. The velocity modulation 
is initially done by the microwave voltage induced in the rhumbat­
ron at the resonance frequency of the rhumbatron cavity resonator 
by the electrical noise in the cavity. This noise is predominantly 
shot noise in the beam, partition noise created by the electron 
beam hitting the grids, and thermal noise in the cavity. This type 
of single cavity klystron is called a reflex klystron.
In reflex klystrons, positive feedback is achieved electronically 
by the bunched electrons returning to the rhumbatron. Reflex 
klystrons are used for low power or midlevel power applications. 
Reflex klystrons can be replaced by solid-state devices such as 
active diodes and FETs. Reflex klystrons today are employed only 

296 Velocity Modulation Devices
for special cases such as high or low temperature use or when 
there is a need for wide tunability or extremely low phase noise. 
On the contrary, multicavity klystrons are used for high power 
and high frequencies. Solid-state devices are expensive and incon­
venient for these applications.
14.5 Velocity Modulation Devices
Most microwave electron devices, whether solid-state devices or 
thermionic devices, rely on the velocity modulation principle of 
the charge carriers in various forms. A velocity modulation 
thermionic device with a lienar electron beam and buncher and 
catcher rhumbatron cavities is called a klystron. A klystron is a 
microwave amplifier. Small input microwave power fed to the 
buncher rhumbatron cavity resonator produces velocity modula­
tion in the electron beam. The velocity modulated electrons drift 
in the drift space. After drifting for a while, the electrons bunch. 
A catcher rhumbatron cavity resonator is located at that point. 
By electrostatic induction from the bunched electrons passing 
through the catcher rhumbatron cavity, the resonator induces a 
large microwave current in the catcher cavity. The induced micro­
wave current is coupled to the output waveguide. Thus, micro­
wave amplification is complete.
The performance of a klystron amplifier is characterized not 
only by gain and frequency bandwidth, but also by the bunching 
parameter, the depth of velocity modulation, the electron transit 
cycles in the buncher and catcher gaps, the beam coupling coeffi­
cient of the buncher and catcher gaps, and the number of electron 
transit cycles across the drift space.
Multicavity klystrons produce tight bunching over a short 
drift. They are therefore suited for high power klystrons with short 
drift space. Klystrons are primarily high microwave frequency and 
high power amplifiers. Output powers on the order of kW and 
MW are common. By adding an external positive feedback loop, 
the klystron can be made into a power oscillator. A single cavity 
klystron is a reflex klystron. A reflex klystron is an oscillator of 
low or medium power. For this type of application, more inexpen­
sive and compact solid-state devices are preferred in most cases. 
However, for special applications of high frequency, tunability, 
low phase noise, or when extremely high or low temperature 
operating conditions are required, reflex klystrons are preferred 
over solid-state devices. Reflex klystron oscillators are negative

resistance oscillators like tunnel diodes, Gunn diodes, and 
IMPATT diodes. Any negative resistance oscillator can be made 
into a negative resistance amplifier if the load resistance is prop­
erly adjusted. In a harsh environment such as extremely high or 
low temperatures, high or low pressures, or high humidity, where 
most solid-state devices fail to operate, the reflex klystron ampli­
fier may be a good alternative.

Magnetrons
15.1 Formation of a Re-entry Beam
In a klystron, the electron beam is generated at the electron gun, 
goes through the process of velocity modulation, bunching, and 
dynamic induction, and finally hits the collector, ending the 
electron beam. If the end of the beam can be brought to the 
beginning and repeatedly recirculated, the output power and 
efficiency will be greatly increased. This re-entry of the electron 
beam is conceptually desirable for high power and high efficiency 
microwave electron devices. This concept has been utilized in the 
magnetron since 1927 in thermionic technology [1-7], but to date 
it is not utilized in solid-state devices technology.
In a magnetron, the re-entry electron beam is formed by a 
thermionic diode of cylindrical structure as illustrated in Fig. 15.1 
[1-8]. In this figure, the radius of the cathode is represented by rc 
and the radius of the anode is represented by ra. A cylindrical 
coordinate is attached by coinciding the z-axis with the cylinder 
axis. In a magnetron, a magnetic flux density Bz (Tesla) is applied 
parallel to the z-axis of the cylindrical coordinate. If the cathode 
potential is zero, the anode potential is Va, and the charge of an 
electron is q, then the electrons are initially accelerated in the 
radial direction by the radial electric field, but because of the

presence of the magnetic flux Bz, the electrons are pushed in 
the tangential direction by the Lorentz force. The magnitude of 
the tangential Lorentz force is qBr (Newton). The torque on the 
electron with respect to the z-axis will therefore be r(qBr) (m — 
N). However, according to Newtonian mechanics, the torque is 
equal to the time rate of change of the angular momentum. 
Therefore

The electrons revolve around the cathode with the angular velocity 
given in Eq. (15.1.3). As seen from this equation, at r = rc, $ = 0. 
This means that the electrons are not moving in a tangential 
direction on the surface of the cathode. The angular velocity 
reaches its greatest value at r = ra, or close to the anode. Fortu­
nately, the magnetron’s microwave interaction is at or near the 
anode most of the time. Near the anode, the tangential velocity of 
electrons is

If the height of the cylindrical structure is h, the thickness of the 
beam interacting with the microwave structure on the anode is 8, 
and the electron density near the anode is N, then the tangential 
electron beam current which is interacting with the microwave 
circuit on the anode cylinder is,

This is the tangential beam current. It flows near the anode and 
the beginning and end are undefined. This is the re-entry electron 
beam current.
It is of interest to note that the anode voltage Va does not 
enter in Eq. 15.1.6 explicitly, yet Va is important to generate the 
radial velocity r as in Eq. 15.1.1. For example, a magnetron of 
ra = 7 mm, rc = 2 mm, and B = 0.2 T, with sufficient filament 
power and anode voltage should produce an angular velocity of 
Eq. 15.1.3 on electrons near the anode at r = ra

By Eq. 15.1.4, the tangential speed of electrons near the anode is
= 7 X 10 3 m X 1.62 X IO10 rad /s = 1.131 X 108 m/s
This is about one third of the velocity of light in a vacuum. If the 
tangential electron beam in the magnetron near the anode has an 
equivalent thickness of 8 = 2 mm and width of h = 15 mm, and 
the hot filament with sufficient anode voltage on the order of 103 
V produces an electron density of N = 1016 m-3 then, from 
Eq. 15.1.6, the tangential beam current is

This does not mean that the anode current of the magnetron is 
5.44 A. This is only a tangential beam current. This large amount 
of current is created by recirculating electrons many times. The 
anode current will be created by the radial beam current Ior. This 
radial current is suppressed by the magnetic Lorentz force. There­
fore, when the magnetron is oscillating, 7or « This aspect will 
be investigated further.
15.2 Formation of Electron Poles
In Fig. 15.1, suppose that Cavity-1 is analogous to a buncher and 
Cavity-2 is analogous to a catcher in a klystron. Then Cavity-1 
and Cavity-2 are spaced by the drift space. Cavity-1 and Cavity-2 
then form a klystron with respect to the circulating beam current 
near the anode, as was studied in Section 15.1. Cavity-2 can be 
considered a buncher for Cavity-3. Though Cavity-3 is a catcher 
for Cavity-2, it is also a buncher for Cavity-4 and this process 
continues repeatedly around the anode. Each cavity receives an 
induction current by beam coupling and in turn gives velocity 
modulation and bunching in the circulating re-entry electron 
beam. The rotating bunched electrons take on a form of rotating 
electron clouds or electron poles. The cavity resonators pick their 
own resonance frequency signals while filtering out electromag­
netic noise. By velocity modulation, drifting, bunching, catching, 
and proper synchronization, the electrons tend to bunch at the 
positive maxima of the microwave electric potential which rotates 
around the anode as the cavity resonators change their polarity

modulation at Gap-5. In reality, each of the six gaps contributes 
to the velocity modulation at each gap including itself, due to the

Magnetron Oscillation
If the circulating bunched electron beam current in Eq. 15.2.1 is 
combined with the anode configuration shown in Fig. 15.1, the 
magnetron is considered to be a re-entry configuration of a 
klystron. In the case of Fig. 15.1, there are six klystrons connected 
in cascade, each cavity playing the role of a catcher for the 
preceding cavity as well as the role of a buncher for the succeed­
ing cavity. The circulating beam current goes through six equi­
valent two-cavity klystrons per revolution. However the beam 
current re-enters. After one revolution, the second revolution will 
begin, and this process continues as long as the magnetron is 
energized. Practically, a magnetron can be considered a cascade of 
infinite numbers of two-cavity klystrons. According to Eq. 14.4.12, 
the power gain between the n‘h cavity and the n + l'A cavity is

Here the electron temperature is assumed to be T = 500 K. Then

The oscillation starts at the noise level of 8.456 X 10 14 W. After 
only one quarter microsecond, the power grows to 1004.7 W, with 
a cavity-to-cavity gain of 1.01 = 0.043 dB. By this time, the 
magnetron is saturated and reaches the equilibrium condition. 
Since this microwave power is available at the interaction gap of 
the output cavity resonator, if the impedance matching is perfect 
then, from Eq. 15.3.15,
vn = pRLPo
If the microwave power is launched into a waveguide of R{ =

In the magnetron, the circulating bunched beam is used over 
and over again. It consumes relatively small amounts of anode 
current due to the strong de magnetic flux density B,. The axial 
magnetic fields tend to prevent electrons from reaching the anode. 
Strong magnetron oscillation occurs near the anode currents, cut 
off by the axial magnetic field. Some magnetrons operate under 
dc-to-microwave power conversion efficiencies greater than 90%. 
One of the reasons that the magnetron is popular for use as a 
power oscillator is its high efficiency over other microwave elec­
tron devices.
In a magnetron at a location (r, <£, z), if the electric potential 
at the point is V volts and the potential energy of the electron is 
qV joules, then the kinetic energy of the electron associated with 
the radial velocity r is \mr2 joules. The kinetic energy of the 
electron associated with the tangential velocity (r<j>) is |m(r<f>)2. 
Therefore, by the law of conservation of energy,
|mr2 + |m(r<f>) = qV

Under a constant anode voltage, if B increases, the electron will 
not reach the anode at a certain value of the magnetic flux Bc. 
This flux density is called the cutoff magnetic flux density. If the 
cutoff of the anode current occurs at r = ra, then ra = 0 in Eq. 
15.3.19. Under this condition, if Eq. 15.3.19 is solved for B, the 
cut off flux density is obtained. From Eq. 15.3.19,
thus,
8m Uara2
(15.3.20)
This equation gives the cutoff magnetic flux density and is a 
measure of the proper amount of magnetic flux density to be given 
to the magnetron for oscillation. The optimum value of B can be 
obtained by trimming B around the value of Bc.
Solving Eq. 15.3.19 for ra2,
If the electron density near the anode is N (m 3) and the height 
of the anode cylinder is h (m), then the de anode current can be

15.3 Magnetron Oscillation 311
The de anode loss is then
^dc = VaL
(15.3.24)
This loss may be small at the cutoff condition, but power will be 
needed to heat the hot cathode. Power will be needed to generate 
B if the magnetron is biased by an electromagnet and must be 
included to calculate the magnetron efficiency.
In the example presented in this section, near the anode at 
r « ra, the tangential kinetic energy of an electron is
|m(ra<j>)2 = |(9.1085 X 10“31 kg) X (1.131 X 108 m/s)2 
= 5.83 X 10“15 J
Since the magnetron is oscillating, ra = 0. From Eq. 15.3.16,
= 3.64 X 104 V
The cutoff magnetic flux density Bc can be calculated from 
Eq. 15.3.20:
8m Va
8 X 9.1085 X 10 31 kg X 3.64 X 104 V
1.602 X 10~19 C
7 X 10 3 m
(7 X 10 3 m2 - (2 X 10~ 3 m)2 = 0.2 T
If B = 0.2 T, most electrons do not reach the anode, but some 
electrons reach due to fringing fields, debunching, and mutual 
repulsion. Thus, the anode current is extremely small.
If the efficiency of the magnetron is 17 = 0.5, then

Likewise, if 17 = 0.95, then Za = 0.001 A. Thus, by monitoring the 
anode current, the approximate efficiency is known.
15.4 Magnetron Principles
The underlying principles for magnetron oscillation are the same 
as for klystrons. Velocity modulation, drifting, bunching, and 
dynamic induction generate microwaves in magnetrons. The 
mechanism of microwave power generation therefore resembles 
the mechanism of a multiple cavity klystron. However, in mag­
netrons the re-entry structure of the electron beam is employed. 
The electron beam which deposits microwave power at the catcher 
cavity re-enters the drift region leading to the first buncher cavity. 
The bunched electron beam is then recirculated. The tangentially 
moving bunched electrons are called electron poles. The electron 
poles induce microwave current in the resonating cavities.
The circulating electron beam is formed by a radial de electric 
field and an axial de magnetic field from a magnet. The de anode 
current is reduced by controlling the axial de magnetic field. The 
high efficiency of a magnetron is due to two reasons. The mag­
netron oscillates only when the de axial magnetic flux is suffi­
ciently large enough to cut off the anode current, reducing the de 
power loss. The other reason is that the electron beam is recircu­
lated, and the bunched tangentially moving electron beam current 
is used repeatedly.

Traveling Wave Devices
16.1 Velocity Modulation by Traveling Waves
The speed of electromagnetic waves in traveling wave devices is 
usually much greater than the velocity of electrons in an ordinary 
electron beam. The velocity of electrons accelerated by an acceler­
ator potential Va is given by Eq. 14.1.2 or
(16.1.1)
If Ej is large so that u approaches the velocity of light c, then the 
electron mass m becomes relativistic or
m
(16.1.2)
In most thermionic devices, 
u c
(16.1.3)
This case is inconvenient if the electrons and electromagnetic 
waves are to interact. To reduce the relative speed of electromag­
netic waves along the electron beam, a slow wave structure as 
illustrated in Fig. 16.1 has been invented [1,13], In this illustration,

a helix is shown. Assuming that the electromagnetic waves, or 
microwaves, propagate along the helix with the velocity of light c, 
and the angle of the helix is t[/, then the longitudinal component 
of the tangential velocity c is [1-3]
uz = c sin i// 
(16.1.4)
As seen from this equation, by adjusting the angle of the helix t[s, 
the axial propagation velocity of microwaves uz can be adjusted to 
any value from 0 to c. It is therefore possible to adjust uz to be 
equal to the electron velocity u which is in the direction along the 
helix axis as shown in Fig. 16.1. If
uz~ u 
(16.1.5)
the longitudinal electric field component Ez, which is associated 
with the traveling waves, will travel with the velocity uz. The 
microwave field Ez can then be expressed in the following travel­
ing wave form:
Ez = Eoe~aze~j(^z~ut) 
(16.1.6)
where Eo is the amplitude of the longitudinal electric field at 
z = 0, a is the attenuation constant in nepers per meter, and is 
the phase constant in radians per meter.
Depending on the phase angle (fiz - a>t), the longitudinal 
electric field Ez can be positive or negative. Electrons in the 
positive field will be decelerated and electrons in the negative field 
will be accelerated. Since the electron velocity u and the wave 
velocity uz are made equal, the electrons and fields travel at the 
same speed. This means that electrons under the accelerating field 
are kept accelerating and electrons in the decelerating field are 
kept decelerating. This is called velocity modulation on the elec­
tron beam. In this traveling wave structure, the electrons travel at 
approximately equal speeds of accelerating or decelerating fields.

16.1 Velocity Modulation by Traveling Waves 317
The duration of velocity modulation is therefore large in both 
space and time in comparison with the klystron. Due to the 
lengthy effective velocity modulation time, the electron beam is 
tightly bunched. After velocity modulation, the velocity of elec­
trons may be expressed in the form of
u = uo + 
(16.1.7)
where uo is the de velocity of the electron in the beam and um is 
the amplitude of velocity modulation at z = 0. ae is the attenua­
tion constant of the velocity modulation. ae is actually negative 
because, if the amplifier tube is properly adjusted, the velocity 
modulation grows as it propagates. jBe is the phase constant of the 
propagation for the velocity modulation in the electron beam.
If the electron beam is velocity modulated as shown in Eq. 
16.1.7, then the density of the electrons in the electron beam is 
also modulated. The modulated electron density can be expressed 
by
p = po + 
) 
(1618)
where po is the de charge density and pm is the amplitude of 
microwave electron charge density at z = 0.
The electron beam current density is therefore
i = pu = pouo + (powm + pmMo)e’“-e"7(ft2'“')
+ pmume-2a‘ze-2J(^z^ut) 
(16.1.9)
The bunched electron beam inherently contains the second har­
monic. The de beam current density is then
(16.1.10)
and the microwave beam current density at the fundamental 
frequency is
im = (Po«m + Pmuo)e-^e~^z-^ (16.1.11)
If the cross section of the electron beam is S (m2), the electron 
bunched beam current is
1= Si = Spouo + S(poum + pmuo)e-a‘ze-j(^z-ut)
+ Spmume-2^ze-2j(^z~ut) 
(16.1.12)
For example, the acceleration voltage for a typical traveling 
wave tube is on the order of 103 V. From Eq. 16.1.1, the de

velocity of the electron is

Wo
2 X 1.602 X 10 19 X 103
9.1085 X IO'31
= 1.876 X 107 m/s
This is about one tenth the velocity of light c, which is typical for 
electrons in microwave thermionic devices. As far as the relativis­
tic factor is concerned, from Eq. 16.1.2,
' 1.876 X 107 m/s 
3 X 108 m/s
= 1.002
Thus, at V& = 1000 V, the relativistic contribution is small but 
discernible. So u <§: c in Eq. 16.1.3 means that, in reality, u ~ 
c/10.
If a helix is used to slow the wave velocity to uz = uo = 1.876 
X 107 m/s, then the angle of the helix $ must be adjusted to, 
using Eq. 16.1.4,

3 X 108 m/s

If the length of active region of the helix is L = 30 cm, the 
duration of velocity modulation r is approximately

On the other hand, in the case of a klystron with the gap distance 
g = 0.5 mm,

A traveling wave tube therefore has a longer period of velocity 
modulation than a klystron. Velocity modulation in traveling wave 
tubes is therefore more effective than in klystrons.
According to transmission line theory, the phase velocity u_ is 
related to phase constant (i by [6,7]

of um and pm, but the values of uo and po give the upper bounds 
of these modulated values.

the slow wave structure such as a helix or meanderline or inter­
digital circuit is k, the induced microwave current in the circuit is, 
by the definition of the beam coupling coefficient,

In this equation, / is the space length of the interaction region. 
Unlike the space length of the klystron, the traveling wave tube 
interaction space length / is not well defined physically. However, 
it is possible to define / electronically.
The relationship between the bunched electrons and the longi­
tudinal electric fields due to the wave slowing structure is illus­
trated in Fig. 16.2. The center of the electron bunch is represented 
by the symbol e. As explained in Section 14.1, to put energy in 
the beam, the electrons must be accelerated by the electric field. If 
the electrons are decelerated by the electric field, then the electric 
field is receiving energy from the electrons. In other words, kinetic 
energy of the electron is converted to the energy of microwave 
electric fields. By careful observation of Fig. 16.2, it appears that, 
as soon as the center of the bunch enters the space of the 
decelerating field, the microwave field receives energy from the 
bunched electrons. The length of the deceleration region zt is one 
half-electronic wavelength or, in Eq. 16.1.8,

According to Eq. 16.1.8, if the peak microwave electron charge 
density of the bunched electrons is pm and the cross-sectional area

By electrostatic induction, the same amount of positive charge is

electrons. The induced microwave longitudinal current in the

When a bunched electron beam current (16.1.9) is put through 
a periodical circuit structure, by dynamic induction, a longitudinal 
microwave current given by Eq. 16.2.6 will be generated. If the 
wave-slowing structure is a helix, the microwave helix current is 
given by Eq. 16.2.10. This current travels along the helix with a 
velocity approximately equal to the electronic wave velocity in the 
beam. The microwave current in the beam is therefore, in a phasor

6.25 X 10 3 m/2 = 3.125 X 10“3 m is the length of one section 
of the traveling deceleration region. When a traveling wave tube is 
properly designed, fabricated, and operated with a beam accelera­
tion voltage Va, the starting region of the helix line is the velocity 
modulation region and the end region is the catching region. In 
the velocity modulation region, traveling Xe/2 = 3.13 mm sec­
tions of acceleration regions and other traveling Xe/2 = 3.13 mm 
sections of deceleration regions alternately exist in succession as 
sketched in Fig. 16.2. In the early stage of electron beam-micro­
wave field interaction, these sections are occupied by electron 
beams. However, due to velocity modulation, sooner or later there 

16.2 Dynamic Induction in a Traveling Wave Structure 323
will be bunching. By the time the electron beam reaches the 
catching region of the helix line, electrons are bunched and the 
centers of the bunches are all in the traveling Xe/2 = 3.13 mm 
sections of deceleration regions and very few electrons are left in 
the traveling acceleration sections.
According to Eq. 16.2.11, the beam coupling coefficient de­
pends on modulation. Equation 16.2.11 is rewritten as

16.3 Traveling Wave Amplification 325
Since the current gain is e “e/ = 10, the input current to the 
helix line must be 7j in = 0.0297 X 10 3 A. If this input current is 
fed from a Zo = 50 fl line, then the input power is

The microwave output voltage of this traveling wave amplifier is

16.3 Traveling Wave Amplification
As seen from Eq. 16.2.13, to obtain microwave amplification, the 
microwave attenuation constant ae must be negative. The cou­
pling of the bunched electron beam current and the wave-slowing 
circuit can be considered a transmission line that is continuously 
energized by the bunched electron beam current. A generalized 
equivalent circuit of a traveling wave amplification system is 
shown in Fig. 16.3 [4, 5],
Any transmission line can be represented by a series-parallel 
combination of a series impedance per unit linelength Z, and a 
parallel admittance per unit linelength Y. By Ohm’s law, if the line 
voltage across the transmission line is V and the line current is I, 
and assuming the transmission line extends in the z-direction and 
the voltage wave V and the current wave I are propagating in the 
z-direction with no reflection, then the voltage drop per unit 
length of the line is

In this cold state with no electron beam, as long as the transmis­
sion line is fed by the input signal, there will be a traveling wave

form

where Vo is the amplitude of the microwave line voltage at z = 0 
and t = 0. Yj is the propagation constant of the circuit only, or

or

(16.3.8)
When the bunched electron beam is turned on, the governing 
differential equation is Eq. 16.3.4. In a well adjusted traveling 
wave amplifier, the microwaves on the transmission line and the 
microwaves in the electron beam current form a combined wave 
propagating in unison in the same direction. Under this condition, 
the traveling voltage wave on the transmission line is expressed by
V= VoeJh>t-^z 
(16.3.9)
where y = a + j/3 is the propagation constant of the traveling 
wave, a is the attenuation constant, and ft is the phase constant. 
The microwave beam current is then represented by

In practical traveling wave amplifiers, the value of the right-hand

assumed to be negligible,

direction. Equation 16.3.35 represents a forward wave. As seen 
from Eq. 16.3.8, this wave is the same wave propagating in the 
wave-slowing circuit. As seen from Eq. 16.3.8,
Yi = vZT = ac +j(3c
(16.3.36)
where
ac = ReUt

Combining Eq. 16.3.35 and Eq. 16.3.36,

Substituting Eq. 16.3.39 in Eq. 16.3.9,
y — y e-ac^e-J(.Pc^-wt)
(16.3.40)
This is a voltage wave propagating in the z-direction with attenua­
tion constant ac and phase constant j8c or the phase velocity

This forward wave is completely determined by the wave-slowing 
circuit impedance Z and admittance Y. This mode of waves is 
attenuating and does not contribute to the amplification at all.

The positive sign represents u as being slower than uo and the

Equation 16.3.52 can be further stated as
Y - Yi = beJ^ = jb 
(16.3.54)
or
Y - Yi = be~'"/(‘ 
(16.3.55)
In the case of Eq. 16.3.53,
Y = Yi + b cos[(5/6)tt-] — jb sin[(5/6)77-]
= (ac - (73 /2)b) +j([Sc - lb) (16.3.56)
Applying Eq. 16.3.39 in Eq. 16.3.56,
Y = (ac - (73 /2)b) + j(/3c - lb) (16.3.57)
Substituting Eq. 16.3.57 in Eq. 16.3.9,
jz = jze-(«c-(A/2)*)ze;[w'-(ft-^)*] 
(16.3.58)
If ac > (73/2)b, this wave is attenuating as it travels. On the 
other hand, if ac <

constant — lb, the propagation velocity is

to
Pe-lb > £
(16.3.59)
This wave is faster than the waves in the “cold circuit.” The cold 
circuit is a wave-slowing circuit or transmission line without the 
electron beam.
In the case of Eq. 16.3.54,
Y = Yi +Jb = «c +j(£ + b) (16.3.60)
Substituting Eq. 16.3.60 in Eq. 16.3.9,
V = Eoe““-e7[“^(ft+fc)zl 
(16.3.61)
This wave is attenuating. As it travels, the amplitude decays 
exponentially. This wave has a larger phase constant.

The propagation velocity is then

Pe+b < Jc
(16.3.62)
This is a slow forward attenuating wave. That is, this wave 
propagates slower than in the case of a “cold circuit.” Similarly, in

334 Traveling Wave Devices
the case of Eq. 16.3.55,
Y = Yi + be~J”/b = (ac + (A/2)b) + j(j8c - t/2) (16.3.63)
Substituting Eq. 16.3.63 in Eq. 16.3.9,
y = y e~(ac+(A/2)fc)zey[w'-(/?c-fc/2)] 
(16.3.64)
This is the attenuating wave. The amplitude is attenuating expo­
nentially as it travels. The propagation velocity of this decaying 
wave is
The propagation velocity is greater than the cold circuit wave 
velocity.
As seen from Eqs. 16.3.58, 16.3.61, and 16.3.64, in a traveling 
wave-electron beam interaction system, there are decaying fast 
waves, amplifying fast waves, and decaying slow waves. Traveling 
wave tubes utilize the amplifying fast waves.
The plasma oscillation frequency of the traveling wave tube in 
examples presented in Sections 16.1 and 16.2 is, from Eq. 16.3.24,
rqp^- I 1.602 X 1019 C X 1.18 X 10 4 C/m3

This contrasts with the operating frequency

From Eq. 16.3.46, normalized electron beam velocities are

w
uo w ± wp/A
28.27 X 1010 rad/s
= 0.9953 or 1.0048

16.3 Traveling Wave Amplification 335
Since uo = 1.876 X 107 m/s,
u = 1.876 X 107 m/s X 0.9953 = 1.867 X 107 m/s
or
1.876 X 107 m/s X 1.0048 = 1.885 X 107 m/s
These are the velocities of the fast wave and slow wave. It follows 
that within the de velocity transit time for the entire tube ro = 
L/uo = 15.99 X 10“9 s; the fast waves reach at zfast = 1.885 X 
107 m/s X 15.99 X 10“9 s = 30.14 X 10 2 m and the slow waves 
at zslow = 1.867 X 107 m/s X 15.99 X 10~ 9 s = 29.85 X 10"2 m. 
The difference is zfast — zslow = 0.29 X 10 2 m < 0.625 X 
10 2 m = X,.
Electrically speaking, both the slow wave and fast wave enter 
the traveling wave tube at the same time and reach the output end 
with about a half-period difference.
The size of b in Eq. 16.3.48 can be estimated by knowing the 
gain of practical traveling wave tubes. In this example, a traveling 
wave tube with a power gain of 20 dB is considered. Then, from 
Eq. 16.3.58,

16.4 Backward Wave Interactions
When microwaves and an electron beam are traveling in antiparal­
lel directions, the microwaves can, if properly adjusted, receive 
energy from the oppositely directed electron beam and the mi­
crowaves will be amplified. This type of electron tube is called a 
backward wave tube.
An electron beam-microwave interaction scheme as illus­
trated in Fig. 16.3 will take place, except that the voltage wave, 
the current wave, and the electron wave are backward or antipar­
allel to the electron beam velocity uo. Microwaves are propagating 
in the — z-direction and the electron beam is moving in the 
z-direction. In this case, in Eqs. 16.3.9 and 16.3.10 the negative 
value of y should be used. In Eq. 16.3.30,

It is amplifying as it propagates backward in the — z-direction as

A favorable backward wave condition for high amplification is 
when both
Red, Imd < 0
Under this condition, if y = y^ then d —> co, and the system is in 
oscillation. In practice, backward wave interaction is used for 
oscillation rather than for amplification.
It is interesting to review the oscillation condition of this 
backward wave oscillator.

16.4 Backward Wave Interactions 339
The oscillation frequency is 3 GHz. At this time, the acceleration

The acceleration voltage is therefore determined by 1/ ^LC, 
which means that the operating voltage is determined by the 
circuit which itself is determined by an operating frequency. In 
this example, 1 / yjLC is determined for 3 GHz.
It does not operate well at 6 GHz even if ft is adjusted. If ft 
is changed, it violates the oscillation condition in Eq. 16.4.11. This 
difficulty is introduced because an ideal lossless line was assumed. 
In reality, the line has loss. If the line loss is represented by a 
shunt conductance per unit length of the line G (S/m) then, 
according to transmission line theory, the phase constant is [6]

16.5 Gyrotrons 341
16.5 Gyrotrons
Ordinary traveling wave tubes are longitudinal interaction devices. 
Gyrotrons are transverse interaction devices. In ordinary traveling 
wave tubes, the longitudinal microwave electric fields interact with 
the electron beam, both of which are parallel to each other. To 
make the interaction effective, the propagation velocity of the 
microwave field along with the longitudinal electron beam must be 
slowed to approximate the speed of the electron beam using the 
wave-slowing structure. In gyrotrons, the interaction is transverse. 
The propagation velocity of the microwave field is therefore not 
controlled at all. Microwaves propagate down a waveguide with 
their natural speed. Electron beams, however, must have a trans­
verse component which is in synchronization with the variation of 
the transverse microwave electric field [14],
One method of creating a transverse component in the direc­
tion of the electron beam is to create a single coil helical beam or 
a double coil helical beam using a longitudinally applied de 
magnetic flux and a longitudinally applied de electric field as 
shown in Fig. 16.4. To avoid congestion and confusion, only one 
representative electron orbit is sketched in these figures. Since 
gyrotrons are transverse interaction devices, it does not matter 
much if there is a standing wave or a traveling wave inside the 
waveguide.
For the case of a single coil helical beam gyrotron, the end 
view of the interaction between the microwave electric field in the 
waveguide and the electrons is shown in Fig. 16.5. Here again only 
one representative electron orbit is sketched. When electrons first 
enter the waveguide, microwave electric fields of the TE°X mode 
and electrons in the orbits are not bunched and are not synchro­
nized [6,7]. Some electrons are decelerated and other electrons are 
accelerated. If the electron motion and microwave field polarity 
change are synchronized as shown in Fig. 16.5 A, then some 
electrons are kept decelerated and others are kept accelerated as 
seen from the illustration. Thus electrons receive velocity modula­
tion. This velocity modulation takes place when electrons are in 
the neighborhood of the cathode. By the time the electrons ap­
proach the output of the waveguide, the electrons bunch, as shown 
in Fig. 16.5 B, due to the velocity modulation given to them 
earlier.
If the bunched electrons and the microwave electric field are 
synchronized in such a way that the bunched electrons are kept 
decelerated as illustrated in Fig. 16.5 B, the lost kinetic energy of 
the bunched electrons is converted to microwave potential energy

and the microwave field gets stronger. This is how microwave 
amplification or oscillation is accomplished in gyrotrons.
The feature of a gyrotron is that velocity modulation and 
catching are done without grids or gaps. Actually, this single coil 
helical electron beam gyrotron is, in principle, the same as old 
helical beam tubes [8,9] and the later peniotron oscillators [10],
The circular motion of a single coil helical beam is basically 
cyclotron oscillation. The cyclotron oscillation angular frequency 
wt (rad/s) is determined by the applied de magnetic flux density

This is considered small.
If /c = 10 GHz, then r = 0.159 X 10 3 m. If /c = 1 GHz, 
then r — 1.5 X 10“3 m.
At any rate, the radius of the cyclotron motion is small in 
comparison with the dimensions of the waveguide. The diameter 
of the waveguide is about equal to one half-wavelength of mi­
crowaves. Unless microwave electric fields are focused in the 
example of the peniotron structure as shown in Fig. 16.6, the 
interaction between the electrons and the microwave field is not 
effective [10]. A peniotron structure consists of a double fin 
structure as seen in Fig. 16.6. These double metallic fins concen­
trate the microwave electric field in a small, restricted region 
where the interaction to a single coil helical electron beam takes 
place.
An alternative method takes on the form of a double coil 
helical beam as shown in Fig. 16.4 B. When an electron orbit is

viewed from the end of the cylindrical waveguide near the output, 
electrons are bunched by this time and the situation looks like 
that shown in Fig. 16.7. The electron cycloidal motion is adjusted 
so that the bunched electrons are always in phase of deceleration. 
Decreased kinetic energy of the electrons is transferred to mi­
crowave energy and thus amplification or oscillation takes place. 
If the period of the cycloidal motion of bunched electrons is r, 
and if the period of the microwave frequency is T, then the 
synchronous condition for a double coil helical beam is

This means that, by adjusting B, the cyclotron frequency of the

the microwave electric field for oscillation or amplification under 
an optimum operating condition.
As seen from Fig. 16.7, the double coil helical beam occupies a 
large volume in the waveguide. The interaction with a microwave 
electric field takes place in a larger area than a single coil helical

power and high frequency gyrotrons are in the form of double coil 
helical beam gyrotrons.
An example of a commercial VGT-8014 gyrotron is shown in 
Fig. 16.8 [12], This gyrotron produces an output of 100 kW, 
continuous wave at 140 GHz with a beam voltage of 80 kV, an 
anode current of 8 A, a heater voltage of 15 V, a heater current of 
5 A, and is magnetically focused by a supercooled VYW 8014 
magnet using liquid helium and liquid nitrogen.
16.6 Traveling Wave Interactions
In traveling wave electron devices, traveling microwaves interact 
with electron beams. Traveling microwave electric fields cause 
velocity modulation in the electron beam. The velocity modulated 
electrons form electron bunches. If properly phased, the bunched 
electrons are decelerated by the microwave electric field which is 
traveling with the bunched electrons. The decreasing kinetic en­

Problems 347
ergy of the bunched electrons results in increased microwave 
potential energy. This is how microwave oscillation or amplifica­
tion takes place.
The interaction configuration between traveling microwave 
electric fields and the electron beam can be forward, backward, or 
gyrating. In a forward traveling wave tube, microwaves are slowed 
by the wave-slowing circuit as they travel in the same direction as 
the electron beam. In the backward tube, microwaves travel in the 
opposite direction of the electron beam. Due to the strong feed­
back of backward tubes, most backward tubes are backward 
oscillators.
In gyrotrons, electron beams interact with transverse mi­
crowave electric fields. It does not matter much if it is forward 
wave interaction, backward wave interaction, or standing wave 
interaction, as long as the synchronization between the polarity of 
the microwave electric field and the direction of the cycloidal 
motion of the bunched electrons is kept in a positively interacting 
phase for microwave energy production.
One feature of traveling wave devices is the wide frequency 
bandwidth. A wide frequency bandwidth means that there is 
greater channel capacity for communications.

Fundamental Principles of 
Microwave Electron Devices
17.1 Basic Principles Involved
In reviewing microwave electron devices in this book, the basic 
principles common to microwave electron devices are the transit 
time effect, the principle of velocity modulation, beam coupling, 
electron bunching, negative admittance, spin wave interaction, 
nonlinear admittance, quantum mechanical transitions, and power 
or voltage transfer principles [1-8], Various microwave electron 
devices operate using one or more of these fundamental princi­
ples. How these fundamental principles take effect in microwave 
electron devices is reviewed in this chapter.
17.2 Electron Transit Time Effect
In an electron device, a drifting electron takes a finite time to 
move from one point to another point. The time necessary for an 
electron to drift between two specified locations is called the 
electron transit time. In most microwave electron devices, 
351

352 Fundamental Principles of Microwave Electron Devices
the electron transit time between two important locations in the 
device is comparable to the period of the operating microwave 
frequency. If the distance between the two locations in the mi­
crowave electron device is / (m) and the electron drift velocity 
between the two locations is u (m/s), then the electron transit 
time between the two locations is
/
(s) 
(17.2.1)
u
If the operating microwave frequency is f (Hz), the period of the 
microwave frequency is
T=y (s) 
(17.2.2)
In low radio frequency or in audio frequency electron devices
t « T 
(17.2.3)
Thus, the electron transit time is negligible in comparison with the 
period of the operating frequency. In most microwave electron 
devices, both r and T are on the same order of magnitude. As a 
result, the effect of the electron transit time produces distinct 
principles in microwave frequency electron devices in contrast to 
their low frequency counter parts. The electron transit time effect 
is involved in other microwave principles such as velocity modula­
tion, beam coupling, electron bunching, and negative admittance. 
The electron transit time effect is therefore considered to be one of 
the major principles of microwave electron devices.
For example, the channel length / of a low frequency FET 
from the source to the drain is about 10 jam [1], If the drift 
velocity of an electron in the channel is 100 km/s, then the 
electron transit time r from the source to the drain is 0.1 ns. If the 
operating frequency is 20 kHz, the period T is 0.05 ms or 50000 ns. 
In this case r <c T and r is therefore negligible. If the same FET 
is operated at 20 GHz, then the period T is 0.05 ns. Now that 
t > T, before the electrons complete a trip from the source to the 
drain, the polarity of the gate changes twice. Under this condition, 
transistor action is impossible. The gate does not have coherent 
control over the electrons in the channel. For coherent control of 
the gate over the electrons in the channel, r must be negligible in 
comparison with the operating period T. This is the reason that 
the gate length / of microwave FETs is small (as small as 0.5 jam). 
As a result, the transit time is only 0.005 ns, which is one tenth T 

17.2 Electron Transit Time Effect 353
for 20 GHz. The concept of the electron beam coupling coefficient 
developed with a klystron is applicable here. Using Eq. 14.3.12, 
for I = 0.5 firn and f = 20 GHz, ko = 0.98. For I = 10 jam and 
f = 20 GHz, ko = —0.0005. This simple calculation shows dra­
matically why the low frequency FET with I = 10 jim does not 
work at microwave frequencies. The beam coupling coefficient is a 
measure of the coupling of energy between the electron beam and 
microwaves on the electrode. A large beam coupling coefficient 
means better coupling. In a klystron, the gap of the buncher or 
catcher is on the order of 10“4 m. The electron velocity is on the 
order of 107 m/s. Then, by Eq. 14.3.12, at 10 GHz, ko = 0.98.
To make the beam coupling coefficient larger, a shorter dis­
tance I or faster drift velocity u is required. The electron drift 
velocity u is limited by the relativistic velocity 3 X 108 m/s. As 
long as the device relies on the electron drift current—as in FETs, 
transferred electron devices, avalanche diodes, parametric devices, 
and microwave thermionic devices—the device ceases to function 
before the relativistic velocity sets in. In contrast, tunnel diodes 
are not based on drift current and are therefore not limited by a 
relativistic drift velocity. A narrow tunnel junction and a fast 
propagation velocity of the de Broglie wave function make the 
high frequency adaptability of a tunnel diode better.
The electron transit time effect plays vitally important roles in 
electron energy transfer devices such as IMPATT diodes, Gunn 
diodes, and TRAPATT diodes. The oscillation and amplification 
frequencies are closely related to the electron transit time across 
the drift regions of these devices as are the drift regions of 
klystrons and interpole drifting in magnetrons. Electrons must 
travel across the drift region in specified times to produce output 
in the output electrode at the correct phase. To do this, the 
electron transit time across the drift region, or the electron transit 
cycle, must be precisely adjusted.
The electron transit time effect is the foundation of electron 
bunching. In klystrons, magnetrons, and traveling wave tubes, 
electron bunching is created by the electron transit time effect. 
The electron transit time effect in the drift region produces elec­
tron bunching. The bunched electrons produce the microwave 
output in the output circuit.
Minimal electron transit time is desired in the interaction gap. 
An adequate electron transit time effect is desired in the drift 
region. Either in solid-state devices or in thermionic devices, 
microwave electron devices take advantage of electron transit time 
effect in the drift region to produce microwave energy at the 
output from the kinetic energy of drifting electrons.

354 Fundamental Principles of Microwave Electron Devices
17.3 
Velocity Modulation
Velocity modulation produces electron bunching after drifting for 
a proper time period. This is an important basic principle of all 
microwave thermionic devices, including klystrons, magnetrons, 
and traveling wave tubes. In solid-state devices, the drift velocity 
of the electrons is modulated by the presence of microwave fields. 
However, the electron transit time is relatively short when com­
pared with the thermionic counterpart. Therefore, the velocity 
modulation itself does not cause electron bunching as exemplified 
by the GaAs FET. On the other hand, the formation of the high 
field domain in Gunn diodes is caused by the coexistence of high 
mobility electrons and low mobility electrons. This is a variation 
of velocity modulation in which the charge accumulation region is 
in the bulk of the semiconductor.
17.4 
Beam Coupling
Beam coupling is the coupling of energy between the microwave 
electric field in the circuit and the electron beam of the stream of 
electrons in the electron device. At the input of a microwave 
amplifier, beam coupling refers to the transfer of microwave 
energy in the circuit to the kinetic energy of electrons in the 
stream of electrons. At the output of a microwave amplifier or a 
microwave oscillator, beam coupling refers to the transfer of the 
kinetic energy of electrons in the device to the microwave field 
energy of the output circuit. Beam coupling takes place in almost 
all active and passive microwave electron devices except masers 
and parametric devices. In FETs, Gunn diodes, IMPATT diodes 
and all microwave thermionic devices such as magnetrons, 
klystrons, and traveling wave tubes, the output is produced by 
electrons actually striking the output electrode or by electrons 
passing in proximity to the output electrodes. Actually, by the 
principle of dynamic induction, the output microwave current 
starts to flow in the output circuit even before the electrons reach 
the output electrode via the displacement current. The displace­
ment current, created by the bunched electrons in the device, 
transfers to the conduction current at the output electrodes due to 
the law of continuity of electric current, even before the bunched 
electrons reach the output electrodes. In microwave solid-state 
devices, the bunched electrons reach the output electrode and 
discharge there, creating a large pulse current. In microwave

17.6 Negative Admittance 355
thermionic devices, some electrons actually strike the output elec­
trodes but the majority of the bunched electrons just pass by in 
proximity of the output electrodes and produce microwave output 
current by induction.
17.5 
Electron Bunching
Bunched electrons produce microwave currents at the output by 
induction or discharge, or by both induction and discharge. In 
microwave electron devices, bunched electrons are created by 
direct density modulation as exemplified by the GaAs MESFET, 
by velocity modulation as exemplified by klystrons, magnetrons, 
and traveling wave tubes, by periodical intermittent avalanche 
breakdown as exemplified by the IMPATT diode, and by periodi­
cal local quantum energy transfer as exemplified by the Gunn 
effect diode. Regardless of the mechanism used to create electron 
bunching, if the device depends upon the electron transit time 
effect, the bunch created in the beginning of the electron transit 
grows as it travels across the device. The concept of the bunching 
parameter in Eq. 14.2.15 can be widely applied to any electron 
transit time device, whether solid-state or thermionic. By suitable 
adaptation of the parameters in Eq. 14.2.15 for individual specific 
devices, the bunching parameter in Eq. 14.2.15 can be defined for 
transit time devices besides klystrons.
17.6 
Negative Admittance
The concepts of negative admittance and negative impedance can 
be widely applied to active microwave electron devices. Positive 
admittance consumes energy and negative admittance generates 
energy. If the positive admittance is Y = G + jB and the mi­
crowave voltage across the admittance is V, then the power 
consumed by the positive admittance is
P = ±GV2 
(17.6.1)
where the microwave voltage is assumed to be a sinusoidal wave­
form and V is the peak value. If a negative admittance is Y = 
— ((7 + jB) and the microwave voltage across the admittance is V, 
then the power consumed by the negative admittance is
P = ±GV2 
(17.6.2)

356 Fundamental Principles of Microwave Electron Devices
This is the negatively consumed power by the negative impedance. 
Negatively consumed actually means the generation of microwave 
power. In all microwave active electron devices, including mi­
crowave transistors and active diodes, producing the power P 
with a terminal peak voltage V, the magnitude of the negative 
conductance is
IP
(17.6.3)
This type of admittance, or negative admittance, defined by the 
actual microwave output power and voltage is called the dynamic 
negative admittance. An absolutely necessary condition in obtain­
ing negative admittance is to have negative conductance. The sign 
of the susceptance does not matter. For example,
-G+jB = — (G+jB) = -Y (17.6.4)
This is a negative admittance. However,
G — jB = — (jB — G) = -(-G+jB) 
(17.6.5)
will not make a negative admittance. This is because |F2 multi­
plied with the conductance will produce positively consumed 
power.
The dynamic negative admittance appears wherever the mi­
crowave radiation exists: at the drain of a GaAs MESFET; across 
an activated Gunn diode, IMPATT diode, tunnel diode, or para­
metric diode; at a klystron’s catcher gap or a magnetron’s gap; or 
at the output of a traveling wave tube. It will even appear at the 
open end of a radiating waveguide or across an antenna aperture. 
This concept of dynamic negative conductance coincides with the 
differential negative conductance as discussed with tunnel diodes, 
Gunn diodes, and IMPATT diodes. In conjunction with the 
positive admittance TL which is connected in parallel to the 
negative conductance, in the steady state of oscillation,
-Y + TL = 0 or Y2 = Y2 
(17.6.6)
If
G < Gl 
(17.6.7)
the oscillation will die down. If
G > GL 
(17.6.8)
the amplitude of the voltage across the negative admittance will 
grow until Eq. 17.6.6 is reached by nonlinear effects. As pointed 

17.7 Spinwave Interaction 357
out in the discussion of tunnel diodes and IMPATT diodes, 17.6.7 
can be used for amplification of microwave signals if Eq. 3.4.2 
is met.
At this point, a question arises about dynamic negative con­
ductance. Does negative admittance produce microwave energy or 
does microwave energy create dynamic negative conductance? It is 
obvious in the case of the tunnel diode and the avalanche diode 
that dynamic negative conductance generates microwave power. It 
is less obvious for the Gunn diode and the IMPATT diode and is 
not obvious at all for klystrons, magnetrons, and traveling wave 
tubes. In fact, the observed current-voltage curves of the Gunn 
diode and the IMPATT diode generally exhibit smaller negative 
differential conductances than the tunnel diode, yet they produce 
a large oscillation output exhibiting a large dynamic negative 
conductance. The negative differential resistance will not appear 
under the normal operation of klystrons, magnetrons, and travel­
ing wave tubes, yet it produces large amounts of microwave 
power, exhibiting high dynamic negative conductance. This clearly 
indicates that the differential conductance on the static 
current-voltage curve, A7/AK, is the static differential conduc­
tance. It is not equal to the dynamic negative conductance all the 
time. The existence of the negative static differential conductance 
as seen in tunnel diodes, avalanche diodes, and Gunn diodes 
assures the possibility of amplification and oscillation. However, 
the actual power balance is accounted for in the dynamic negative 
conductance. Except for tunnel diodes and avalanche diodes, it is 
safe to say that, in most active microwave electron devices, oscilla­
tion or amplification creates the equivalent dynamic admittance 
rather than that the dynamic negative admittance generates oscil­
lation or amplification.
As seen from Eq. 17.6.6, the dynamic negative admittance can 
be measured by observing the load admittance under steady state 
oscillation. A plot of the load admittance under constant output 
power on a Smith chart is called a Rieke diagram [2,3], A mirror 
image of the complex conjugate of the load admittance on the 
Rieke diagram is the negative dynamic admittance.
17.7 
Spinwave Interaction
Ferrimagnetic material is used for isolators and circulators. Para­
magnetic material is used as the paramagnetic crystal for crystal 
masers exemplified by ruby masers.

358 Fundamental Principles of Microwave Electron Devices
The magnetic properties of a material depend on the spin of 
unpaired electrons of some particular atom in the host material, 
exemplified by Cr atoms in A12O3 crystals in the ruby maser. The 
Fe3+ ion has an unpaired electron spin in Fe3O4 in the case of 
ferrite. When the ferrimagnetic material or the paramagnetic 
material is magnetically biased by an externally applied de mag­
netic field and a local anisotropic magnetic field, the electron spins 
precess around the magnetic bias field due to the magnetic dipole 
moment generated by the spin motion of the electron itself. Then 
the magnetic dipole moment of spinning and precessing electrons 
and the local biasing magnetic field interact with each other. In 
ferrimagnetic material such an interaction is classical and in 
paramagnetic material such a interaction is quantum mechanical. 
In ferrites, the magnetic dipole moment of the spin and the 
interaction energy of the bias magnetic fields are defined and 
continuous. In contrast, for paramagnetic material the spin energy 
is discretely described by quantum numbers.
When these electron spins are irradiated by microwaves, they 
change energy by absorbing the energy from the microwaves or 
emitting the energy in the form of microwaves. In ferrimagnetic 
material, the transition of the energy is continuous while in 
paramagnetic material, the transition of the energy is discrete. The 
energy of the magnetic dipole moment of the spin or magnetiza­
tion is described by the Landau-Lifschitz gyromagnetic equation 
in the ferrimagnetic-microwave interaction. The energy of the 
spin angular momentum and microwaves in the paramagnetic 
material is described by the Schrodinger equation. The solution of 
the Landau-Lifschitz equation is continuous while the solution of 
the Schrodinger equation is discrete, defined by quantum num­
bers. Though one is classical and the other quantum mechanical, 
the principles of isolators, circulators, and masers are based on the 
microwave interaction of electron spin waves in the host material.
17.8 
Nonlinear Impedance
If the working ranges of the input excitation are not restricted, 
then existing electron devices are all nonlinear. If they are not 
nonlinear, there would be a runaway condition. The device will 
either explode in a way similar to the “ big bang” theory or it will 
implode in a way similar to the “black hole” theory. Fortunately, 
due to the nonlinearity of existing electron devices, neither explo­
sion nor implostion occurs.

17.8 Nonlinear Impedance 359
In GaAs FETs, the drain current is nonlinear with respect to 
the drain voltage. The drain impedance is nonlinear and the drain 
impedance is controlled by the gate voltage. When the FET 
oscillates or amplifies, the dynamic drain impedance is considered 
to be negative even though the static drain resistance is positive. 
The magnitude of the negative dynamic impedance of the drain is 
controlled by the gate voltage. The magnitude of the dynamic 
negative impedance determines the gain and frequency of the 
GaAs FET. The current-voltage curves for tunnel diodes, Gunn 
diodes, IMPATT diodes, TRAPATT diodes, and BARRITT diodes 
show strong nonlinearity. These active diodes show not only static 
negative resistance, but also show dynamic negative impedance. 
This is the reason they are used for amplification and generation 
of microwaves.
Schottky barrier diodes, back diodes, step recovery diodes, 
varactor diodes, and PIN diodes all exhibit distinct nonlinear 
current-voltage curves. They have static nonlinear resistance and 
dynamic positive nonlinear impedance. The gain is always less 
than unity, though dynamic positive nonlinear impedance, detec­
tion, mixing, harmonic generation, and microwave switching are 
accomplished. The varactor diode has positive nonlinear imped­
ance when it is not pumped. When pumped, it has negative 
dynamic impedance and amplifies microwaves or oscillates at 
microwave frequencies. This relationship is analogous to the case 
of the maser. The maser material, a ruby crystal for example, is 
not active by itself. When pumped, it becomes active and ampli­
fies micro waves or oscillates at a micro wave frequency. Under this 
condition, or under the pumping condition, with proper mi­
crowave circuitry, varactor diodes and the maser material present 
dynamic negative nonlinear impedance. A switching PIN diode is 
a typical nonlinear diode. If it were not nonlinear, switching 
would be impossible. This is the situation with all of the detector 
and mixer diodes.
The anode voltage versus anode current characteristics of 
microwave thermionic devices such as klystrons, magnetrons, and 
traveling wave tubes are nonlinear. The characteristic curves satu­
rate due to the limited availability of thermionically emitted 
electrons. The finite amount of available electron density creates 
nonlinearity in the dynamic negative impedance of the microwave 
thermionic device. The nonlinear electronic impedance of a 
thermionic device generates harmonics of its own.
In ferrimagnetic devices and masers, electron devices exhibit 
nonlinearity for a large input signal. Ferrites exhibit high nonlin­
earity for high input. Experimentally, the nonlinear impedance of 

360 Fundamental Principles of Microwave Electron Devices
a ferrite is utilized as the time varying inductance parametric 
amplifier rather than as a time varying capacitance parametric 
amplifier. Nonlinearity in masers is caused mainly by the avail­
ability of vacancies or atoms in a desirable quantum state. For a 
large input signal, masers exhibit nonlinearity due to the satura­
tion of available energy states for transition.
17.9 
Quantum Mechanical Transition
All solid-state devices are based on quantum mechanical transi­
tions. Microwave solid-state electron devices such as FETs, diodes, 
and bulk effect devices are based on the energy band theory. The 
energy band theory stems from quantum mechanical transitions 
which can be described by the Schrodinger equation. Obviously, 
masers are based on quantum mechanical principles. Even mi­
crowave thermionic devices such as klystrons, magnetrons, and 
traveling wave tubes rely on quantum mechanical transitions at 
their cathodes. Thermionic emission is a quantum mechanical 
phenomenon. After all, the exact description of electrons in solids 
is impossible by classical mechanics. This is the reason that 
quantum mechanical concepts are used in solid-state electron 
devices.
In tunnel diodes, the quantum mechanical tunneling effect 
produces negative resistance. In Gunn effect diodes, the quantum 
mechanical energy transition of electrons within the conduction 
band generates the traveling high field domain or the charge 
accumulation layer.
In masers, quantum mechanical transitions of the quantum 
states of atoms or molecules emit microwave radiation for ampli­
fication. In most microwave electron devices except for masers, 
the quantum mechanical energy transfer is done between the 
kinetic energy of the electrons and the potential energy in some 
form. The current-voltage characteristics of electron devices de­
scribe such energy transfer. In masers, the quantum mechanical 
energy transfer is between the potential energy difference of the 
two energy states and the photon, or AE = hf, where h is Planck’s 
constant.
In a double coil helical beam gyrotron with a beam voltage on 
the order of hundreds of kV and a magnetic flux density of several 
Tesla, the electron mass and speed are relativistic. When the 
bunched electrons are in an outer orbit of cycloidal motion, the 
electrons are in the high energy state. When the bunched electrons 

Problems 361
are in an inner orbit of cycloidal motion, they are in the low 
energy state. These high energy states and low energy states are 
quantized. The energy states can be described by discrete specific 
quantum numbers when the bunched electrons make a downward 
transition from the high energy state to low energy state. If the 
energy difference is AE, then the radiation frequency of emission 
is f = &E/h. When a gyrotron is operated in this mode, it is 
called a free electron maser. To enhance stimulation, the wave­
guide is a cavity resonator. The pumping, which transforms lower 
energy state electrons to high energy state electrons, is done by 
both a de beam voltage and a de magnetic field [4,6],
For this quantum mechanical energy transition, the electron 
beam does not need to be a double coil helical beam. It can be a 
“zig-zag” orbiting or meandering electron beam. These beams 
can be formed by shooting an electron beam into a spatially 
periodically alternating de magnetic or electric field. Every time an 
electron changes its direction of motion, there is a discrete amount 
of energy change. If the amount of the energy change is AE, then 
the radiation frequency of emission is f=LE/h. Again, the 
waveguide with the periodical static field must form a cavity 
resonator which resonates at the emission frequency for efficient 
stimulation. This type of free electron maser is called an ubitron 
[4,6].

1 Microstripline Principles
The microstripline technique [1] is widely used in microwave 
integrated circuits and is often associated with microwave electron 
devices. Fundamental principles of microstripline techniques 
closely associated with microwave electron devices are reviewed.
A-1.1 Characteristic Impedance
In most practical striplines, a conducting strip is sandwiched by 
dielectric layers which are themselves sandwiched by conducting 
layers as shown in the cross-sectional view in Fig. A-1.1. If the 
line voltage is V and the line current is I, assuming the mi­
crostripline is infinitely long or perfectly impedance-matched with 
no reflection, then the characteristic impedance of the stripline is 
defined as
Zo=y

strip and the ground plate are E and H, respectively,

and H must be known. To obtain E and H, Maxwell’s equations 
must be solved under given boundary conditions.
A-1.2 Propagation Constant
Traveling voltage waves on a microstripline are expressed in the 
form of
V= Voe~^+Jut 
(A-1.4)
where y is a complex constant called the propagation constant:
y = a + jft 
(A-1.5)
The real part a is called the attenuation constant and the imagi­
nary part is the phase constant. The attenuation constant a is 
determined by the voltage loss per unit length of the line due to 
ohmic loss in the conducting strip, dielectric loss, and small 
radiation loss. In practical microwave striplines, the value of a 
itself is significant but the actual distance of traveling is so small 
that the total attenuation is usually negligible [1]. The phase 
constant is the phase shift per unit distance of propagation. The 
voltage wave shifts its phase 2 77 radians for a full wavelength 
distance of propagation. By definition of the phase constant,

parallel to the surface of the microstrip with the y-axis perpendic­
ular to it and the z-axis coincides with the direction of the 
microstrip. Maxwell’s equation of Faraday’s law at the same 
location states that

the stripline is represented by

On the microstripline, the forward current wave is represented by 
Zf(z) and the backward current wave is represented by Zb(z). The 
resultant of the forward current wave and the backward current 
wave on the stripline at any location is
Z(z) =Zf(z) -Zb(z)

circuit, a plot shown in Fig. A-2.1 will be obtained. To avoid 
confusion, only a few lines are shown.
When the complex coordinate is removed, Fig. A-2.2 is ob­
tained. This Smith chart [4] is a plot of voltage reflection coeffi­
cients for various normalized transmission line impedances with 
the complex coordinate removed. In practical Smith charts, vari­
ous additional scales are attached around the outside of the 
outermost circle for convenience. The normalized admittance is

(A-2.4)
Z(z)
In a Smith chart, the value of Y(z) is always found at 
diametrically and symmetrically opposite sides of the center of the 
diagram for the point Z(z). The Smith chart can therefore be 
used to obtain the normalized impedance Z(z) and also the 
normalized admittance Y(z).
If an electronic oscillator is connected with a transmission line 
at a location z on the microstrip and the oscillation is in a steady

where Te is the electronic admittance of the electronic oscillator 
presented at z. Then
_ f(z)=-fe 
(A-2.6)
Therefore, knowing T(z), Te is known. Various values of T(z) 
produce the same oscillation frequency. A plot of a constant 
frequency contour is produced on the Smith chart. By changing 
T(z), a family of constant power contours and a family of 
constant frequency contours can be produced on the Smith chart. 
The chart of the family of constant power contours and constant 
frequency contours of an electronic oscillator is called the Rieke 
diagram [5], As seen from Eq. A-2.6, the Rieke diagram shows the 
negative electronic admittance presented at the location z.
3 Cavity Resonator Principles
Originally, microwave cavity resonators were meant to be spaces 
surrounded by conducting walls. When microwaves are introduced 
into the cavity, the stored microwave energy reaches its maximum 
at a certain microwave frequency and the operating frequency 
causing resonance is called the resonance frequency.
The original concept of the cavity resonator is now extended 
to almost any microwave resonator which is not necessarily made 
of closed conducting walls. For example, a pair of two parallel 
conducting plates is considered to be a cavity resonator. A stripline 
section with both ends open is also called a cavity resonator as 
well as a rectangular or circular patch on a microstrip circuit if the 
size is comparable to the operating wavelength.
The electromagnetic fields E and H in the cavity resonator are 
a set of solutions to Maxwell’s equations
V X H = oE + JweE
V X E = -jw/iH 
and of the wave equations

which can be derived from both Eqs. A-3.1 and A-3.2 by 
eliminating either E or H from them [3], Once E and H are known 
by solving Maxwell’s equations, the resonance frequency of the 
cavity resonator is obtained from Eq. A-3.3 or Eq. A- 3.4.
Various microwave rectangular cavity resonators are illustrated in 
Fig. A-3.1. The cavities shown in Fig. A-3.1 are surrounded by 
conducting walls. To put microwaves into this metal box, a 
coupling hole or a small antenna will be constructed on the 
conducting wall.
Various modes of electromagnetic field distribution in the 
rectangular box shown in Fig. A-3.1 are conceivable. One of the

“Cavity resonators” can be formed using sections of open or 
short circuited transmission lines. The transmission line can be a 
coaxial line, a two-wire line, a waveguide, or a microstripline.

Another important factor in a cavity resonator is a quality 
factor. The quality factor Q of a cavity resonator is defined as a 
factor which is proportional to the ratio of the stored electromag­
netic energy inside the cavity resonator to the power loss P in the 
cavity resonator. The proportionality constant is the angular fre­
quency u:

resonator, 5 is the cavity surface, and Ht is the magnetic field 
tangential to the cavity wall [3], In this simplified assumption, the 
loss was assumed to be only ohmic at the cavity wall. If the 
radiation loss, the power loss due to the coupling to the external 
circuit, or the dielectric loss are involved, then these losses must 
be added to Eq. A-3.54.

Energy states of electrons in solids are described by the electronic 
energy E and lattice energy Et of the solid. By external excitation, 
the state (E, E,) may transfer to the state (E', E/). If the proba­
bility of finding an electron with the energy E or E' is /(E) or 
f(E'), respectively, and the probability of the lattice energy being 
Et or E/ is g{Et) or g(E/), the probability of transferring the 
state from (E, E/) to (E', E/) is proportional to f(E), g(E[) and, 
due to Pauli’s exclusion principle, [1 —/(E/)] [6-10], If the 
proportionality constant is represented by a, the transition proba­
bility from E to E' is

6 Waveguide Principles
One of the most popular waveguides used with microwave elec­
tron devices is the rectangular waveguide [3], as illustrated in Fig. 
A-6.1. A rectangular waveguide is a conducting hollow pipe with 
a rectangular cross section. Microwaves are launched into the 
waveguide by a small antenna or a small solid-state oscillator, 
which can be placed directly inside the waveguide. A detector, 
mixer, varactor, or PIN diode is mounted inside the waveguide for 
various applications. The electromagnetic field of a hollow wave­
guide is governed by a wave equation which is derived from 
Maxwell’s equations. The wave equation for the lossless system is
V2H + w2egH = 0 
(A-6.1)
where H is a microwave magnetic field inside the waveguide, e is 
the permittivity, and g is the permeability of the medium inside 
the waveguide. In most cases, e and g are that of the air. In the 
coordinate system shown in Fig. A-6.1 for Hz,

can be chosen. If so, the electromagnetic field distribution of this 
mode is called the Hm„ mode or TEm„ mode, where m and n are 
zero or integers. Equation A-6.9 is for the case of m = 1 and 
n = 0 or H10 mode or TE10 mode. In most applications, the TE10 
mode is used. TE stands for transverse electric which means 
Ez = 0. H mode means Hz =# 0.

This mode is the Emn mode or TMmn mode. TM mode, or 
transverse magnetic mode, is not used for practical waveguide 
transmission due to a higher attenuation than the TE mode. Due 
to mode instability, a waveguide with a circular cross section is 
not used often. Waveguides with elliptic cross sections are used at 
times and are treated approximately like rectangular waveguides.
7 Cyclotron Frequency and
Plasma Oscillation Frequency
When an electron with velocity u enters a magnetic field of flux 
density B which is perpendicular to the electron velocity u, the 
amount of force exerted on the electron by the magnetic field is
f = Bqu 
(A-7.1)

7 Cyclotron Frequency and Plasma Oscillation Frequency 395
where q is the electric charge of the electron. The direction of the 
magnetic force is perpendicular to both B and u or, in the vector 
form,
f = — <?B X u 
(A-7.2)
As a result, the orbit of the electron is bent and the electron goes 
into circular motion. This circular motion is called cyclotron 
motion. According to mechanics, r, the radius of curvature of this 
circular motion, the angular frequency to, and the centripetal force 
f are related to each other by

This angular frequency of circular motion, or cyclotron motion, is 
commonly called the cyclotron frequency. The cyclotron fre­
quency is actually the angular velocity of the cyclotron motion. 
The actual cyclotron frequency is obtained by dividing Eq. A-7.6 
by 2tt.
Weakly ionized gaseous media is called plasma. In plasma, 
electrons which do not recombine with positive ions oscillate 
around a neutral position. This oscillatory motion of electrons 
around a neutral location is called plasma oscillation. The plasma 
oscillation is generally three dimensional. If only an v-component 
is observed, the equation of motion of the electron is, omitting 
friction,

8 Crystallographic Axis 397
8 Crystallographic Axis
A crystallographic axis is represented by the Miller indices. Miller 
indices are formed by establishing a rectangular coordinate system 
in the crystal. If a crystallographic plane is given, the intersection 
of the plane and the three coordinate axes—namely x-axis, j'-axis, 
and z-axis—are expressed in terms of the lattice constants. If 
these intersections are designated as lattice constants nx, nY, 
and nz, the Miller indices of this plane are (l/«x, l/«r, l/« .) 
X nx or v or z where nx or y or 2 is the smallest number of the lattice 
constant values nx, ny, and nz. If these sets of numbers are 
represented by mx, my, and mz, respectively, then
m
m
(A-8.1)
(A-8.2)
(A-8.3)
The Miller indices of the crystallographic plane are now given by 
(mx, my, mz). An axis perpendicular to the crystallographic plane 
(mx, mY, mz) is represented by the symbol [mx, my, m,]. If the 
crystal has a cubic lattice, the rectangular coordinate system is 
commonly set up along the cubic lattice. Sometimes the rectangu­
lar coordinate system may be set up arbitrarily, regardless of the 
natural crystal lattice structure. In such cases, the Miller indices of 
the crystallographic plane are represented by (mx, mY, mz). Miller 
indices are integers by nature of the crystal.
For example, crystallographic axis [110] means that this axis is 
perpendicular to the crystallographic plane (110) and a set of the 
reciprocal numbers is (11 oo). This plane intersects the x-axis at a 
distance of one lattice constant. The same plane intersects the 
y-axis at a distance of one lattice constant. The plane does not 
intersect the z-axis. So, the [110] axis direction is perpendicular to 
the plane (110), which means the [110] axis is 45 degrees from 
both the x- and y-axes and perpendicular to the z-axis.
