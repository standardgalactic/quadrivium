n its bid to keep people talking
about – and using – Skype,
Microsoft has refreshed its chat
apps. Having tackled mobile in the
summer, it’s now turned its attention
to the Desktop, adding new tools to
Skype on Windows, Mac and Linux
that place a greater emphasis on
messaging. For example, you can now
click reaction icons to express your
feelings, mention people in group
chats using the ‘@’ symbol, share
images in phone calls and instantly
see if someone is around using the
reintroduced status updates.
Other new features include the
option to select a light or dark theme,
a way to better organise your chat
list by time, and to see whether or
not the messages are unread or the
person is currently active. It’s now
easier to share photos, videos and
files of up to 300MB in size, by
dragging and dropping, and you can
go straight to the new chat media
bit.ly/animate436
This fun Chrome experiment brings photos to life by letting
you jiggle them around on screen for comic effect. It’s
utterly pointless, of course, and actually made us feel a bit
seasick, but whether you capture or upload a photo or use
one of the provided random images, you can play around
to your heart’s content. The tool works by stacking circular
image segments of your photos, allowing you to click and
drag to animate. Double-click (or double-tap if you’re using
a tablet or phone), then throw in some randomised effects
or, if it gets too much, hit Space (or tap with two fingers)
to pause the action. Selecting More Options lets you choose
the quality and central size of the image, and a link to your
movable photo can be shared on Twitter.

Live broadcasting over
the web can feel
daunting, even if you’re
only streaming to people
you know. Instagram’s
new Go Live With feature
lets you bring a friend for
support and broadcast
alongside them. To use it,
tap the camera icon in
the top-left corner of the
screen, select Live, Start
Live Video, then tap the
two-face icon and choose
the person you want to
invite. If they accept,
the screen will split in two, with you taking the top half and
them the bottom. You’ll then stream together, with viewers
seeing you both in action. Because the feature is flexible
– with guests able to drop out at any time and the option
to swap them for someone else – it could be a great medium
for interviewing people live. When the broadcast ends,
you can save the video to Stories or discard it.

ensuring automatic updates are

We pick the 10 best things you must do on the web this fortnight

Need to Know
8 15 - 28 November 2017
What happened?
Android users downloaded a fake
version of WhatsApp more than
a million times before Google spotted
the malicious app and removed it.
The fake app, called Update
WhatsApp Messenger, was live on the
Google Play store and its use of the
WhatsApp logo looked enough like the
real thing to convince millions of users.
The app spoofed WhatsApp’s developer
ID by simply registering the same name
– WhatsApp Inc – with a space at the
end, so it looked identical to users.
Additionally, it had a four-star rating and
plenty of reviews, so it’s no wonder it
managed to fool so many people.
Once downloaded, the fake version of
WhatsApp hid behind a blank icon on
phones’ home screens. The dodgy app
was malicious, but its only effect was to
serve advertising to make money, rather
than hoovering up user data or anything
more dangerous.
Researchers at security firm Avast
investigated further, revealing that there
are plenty of other fake apps pretending
to be the legitimate messaging app in
the Google Play store. This isn’t the first
time the Google Play store has been hit
by malicious applications and a quick
glance at the app market reveals major
brands such as Facebook are still being
spoofed by dodgy duplicates.
How will it affect you?
If you already have WhatsApp installed,
it will automatically update when a new
version becomes available – you don’t
need to go hunting through
the Google Play store for it.
Whether you’re installing
WhatsApp for the first time or
downloading it again because
you’ve got a new phone, make
sure you’re choosing the
genuine article by looking
closely at the developer name,
screenshots and logo. For
WhatsApp, it should – if Google
is doing its job correctly – be
the first one listed.
Another indicator is the
number of downloads – fake
apps may get thousands of
false reviews and downloads,
but it’s hard to hit a billion
unless you’re legitimate
(although the million in this case
is definitely worrying).
It’s tougher for less popular
apps. There are many other
apps and brands being spoofed
on Google Play, and you may not be as
familiar with their logo. Or the
developer may not be one you’ve heard
of – it’s easy enough to recognise
Facebook as the listed developer of its
Messenger app, but you probably won’t
be familiar with the developer of
a retailer or restaurant app.
If you’re ever in doubt, head to the
website of the brand or app in question,
which is likely to have a link to the
official download page on Google Play.
If you downloaded the fake WhatsApp
app but can’t find it for removal, head to
Settings, then Apps to see a list of
everything you’ve downloaded so you
can uninstall unwanted entries.
What do we think?
Google needs to clean up its Play store,
and fast. Of course, users need to take
responsibility and pay attention when
installing apps, but we’ve been
repeatedly told that Android apps
downloaded from the official store are
safe, yet a million downloads of the fake
WhatsApp version proves otherwise.
Although Google promptly cleaned
up the listing for WhatsApp, a quick
search for Facebook’s Messenger app
reveals a similar problem that Google
has failed to address, which is shameful.
Because although the fake WhatsApp
wasn’t particularly dangerous – it simply
showed advertising for profit – other
fakes have caused far more damage,
taking over phones to mine
cryptocurrencies or harvest bank
details.
It’s a huge embarrassment for Google.
The company is developing some of the
most advanced artificial intelligence in
the world, including driverless cars that
can halt to avoid a pedestrian stepping
into the street, yet it can’t spot duplicate
apps stealing a popular developer’s
logo? We’re not impressed.
Even if Google can’t automate its way
out of this problem, it should hire a
couple of staff to check its top 10, 20 or
30 apps every day to remove spoof
versions, or recruit more staff to
approve apps from unknown developers
before they go live. Anything less is
putting its users – and the company’s
reputation – at risk.

At the time of writing, the Play store still

What we think of this fortnight’s top tech news stories and rumours,
and how they affect you

Need to Know
What happened?
The last remaining route to
get Windows 10 for free is
finally being shut down by
Microsoft. The company
originally provided a
window of one year –
ending in July 2016 – for all
Windows 7 and Windows
8.1 users to upgrade for
free to the new operating
system. However, earlier
this year, Microsoft gave
assistive technology users
an extension to upgrade to
Windows 10 for free, but
that too now has a deadline
of 31 December. After that
date, anyone wishing to
upgrade to the new
operating system will need
to shell out for a new PC or
pay £120 for the software.
How will it affect you?
Assistive technology
includes speech
recognition, screen-reader
apps such as Narrator and
Magnifier, the digital
magnifying glass that
zooms in on part of the
screen – all tools built into
Windows to make it easier
for someone with poor
vision or other physical
challenges to use the
operating system.
Microsoft does not
Windows 10 free
upgrade to end
specify which assistive
technologies a user must
depend on to qualify for
this benefit, nor does it
require you to confirm your
needs. The aim is simply to
give more time to those
who may need it to ensure
their assistive devices and
apps will work with the
upgrade. Head to the
upgrade page at bit.ly/
upgrade436 to claim the
free download.
What do we think?
If you missed the deadline
for the free upgrade, this is
one way to get it.
Benefiting from an
exception made available
to people using assistive
technologies may feel
morally questionable, but if
you truly can’t afford the
upgrade and need it,
remember two things:
Microsoft wants you to
upgrade, because it’s
easier for the company if
we’re all using the same
software, which is why the
upgrade was free for a
year; and there’s no limit to
downloads – nabbing your
own free upgrade doesn’t
prevent those with genuine
assistive needs from
getting it, too.
What happened?
Digital currency Bitcoin has
topped $7,000 (about
£5,327) in value and is
predicted to soar even
higher before the end of
the year. Released in 2009,
it had virtually no value
until 2013, when it climbed
in price from a few dollars
per Bitcoin to peaks of
$1,200. Since then, it’s
fluctuated up and down
– until this year, when it’s
been steadily climbing to
new highs month after
month.
To get Bitcoin, users
‘mine’ it by setting their
computer to solve a
challenge, with each task
getting progressively more
difficult. This method exists
purely to slow the release
of blocks of Bitcoin, so they
aren’t all released at once.
How will it affect you?
You don’t need to mine
Bitcoin these days because
you can simply buy it,
which is much easier.
Mining has become more
difficult as the number of
people involved in Bitcoin
has increased. To compete,
you need a top-end
graphics card and a
Bitcoin reaches its
highest price ever
willingness to burn through
electricity to keep your
mining rig powered.
To trade Bitcoin, you can
simply buy some and hang
on to it until the prices go
up. To do so, you’ll need a
Bitcoin wallet – there are
plenty of guides online, but
a good place to begin is
bitcoin.org/en/getting-
started. You don’t need to
buy an entire Bitcoin to get
started, which is handy
because the high price has
made that increasingly
difficult.
What do we think?
Is it too late to get on the
Bitcoin bandwagon? It’s
impossible to say because
the value fluctuates so
much. You could buy at
$7,000, and the next day
the price could nosedive to
nothing, or it could leap to
$10,000 by the end of the
year. It was certainly easier
to get into Bitcoin back
when it was almost
worthless and the risks
were lower. But if the idea
intrigues you, there’s no
reason not to dip your toes
in the Bitcoin waters – just
don’t expect to get rich
overnight.

FIRST LOOK
10 15 - 28 November 2017
Amazon Kindle Oasis
bit.ly/oasis436
Amazon’s new Kindle is its best-ever
e-reader. The device has had an
across-the-board revamp, with a
larger display, better battery life and
some welcome new features.
The new model is still incredibly thin
and light, and is now made of smooth,
gun-metal aluminium, which gives it a
touch of luxury. What’s more, there’s
no need to panic if you drop the
Kindle Oasis in the bath because one
of the e-reader’s big new features is
that it’s waterproof and able to
survive complete immersion in up to
2m of water for 60 minutes.
But you don’t have to drown your
new Kindle to enjoy its benefits. The
screen is the largest ever on a Kindle
and measures 7in across the diagonal,
one where you left off on the other.
To move from reading to listening,
simply tap the top portion of the
touchscreen, look for the headphone
button in the bottom-right corner and
tap it to switch. The Oasis will then
download the audio file.
One annoyance is that there’s no
3.5mm headphone jack or built-in
speaker – you’re limited to Bluetooth
only. You should also bear in mind
that audiobooks are much larger than
ebooks, so you need to keep an eye
on available space.
Despite those caveats, Amazon’s
latest luxury e-reader is easy to
recommend, with its improved
hardware, software and design. At
£229.99, it’s also cheaper than the
original Kindle Oasis, all of which
makes it the best e-reader that money
can buy.
What happened?
Google temporarily locked some
users out of their Google Docs files,
preventing them from editing or sharing
their documents.
Files were flagged up as violating
Google’s terms of service, and users
who tried to access documents they had
been editing only moments before
found that they had frozen. A message
then appeared on screen saying: “This
item has been flagged as inappropriate
and can no longer be shared”.
Docs users who approached Google
for clarification about why their
document had been locked – or if it
could be unlocked – received a note
reading: “Sorry, an error occurred while
submitting the appeal request”.
A Google spokesperson said the issue
was the result of a faulty code push.
“The morning of October 31, we made
a code push that incorrectly flagged
a small percentage of Google Docs as
abusive, which caused those documents
to be automatically blocked,” they said.
“A fix is in place and all users should
have full access to their docs. Protecting
users from viruses, malware and other
abusive content is central to user safety.
We apologise for the disruption and will
put processes in place to prevent this
from happening again.”
While the majority of affected users
were unable to access files, another
Google Docs locks users out of their files
Google Docs user, Iain Mackenzie, told
the BBC that he saw the words “game is
over” appear in a document he had
been editing for a few hours (bit.ly/
bbcgame436).
He insists he was the only person
editing the document at the time and
even the revision history couldn’t shed
any light on what had happened.
How will it affect you?
If you were affected by the temporary
lockout from your Google Docs – which
lasted a few hours in some cases – you’d
be forgiven for panicking that
something more sinister than a ‘faulty
code push’ was responsible and
worrying that you may have lost access
to important documents. Fortunately,
Google was – as ever – quick to fix the
problem and issue an explanation and
apology, so you won’t have needed to
fret for long.
What do we think?
Considering how many billion users
Google has, it’s surprisingly uncommon
for Google services to suffer such
glitches, although the company may
want to rethink the wording of its scary
lock-out warnings. The real mystery
here is why Mr MacKenzie saw the
sinister “game is over” message in his
document, but perhaps this can be
attributed to the incident occurring on
Halloween!
which means more text per page and
less frequent page turns. The display
looks as sharp as ever, too.
The Oasis’ other big new feature is the
ability to play your Audible titles via
Bluetooth. This means that if you own
both ebook and audiobook editions, you
can switch between them, picking up on

T-BOTS Balancing Robots
bit.ly/tbots436 | From £45
No matter how impressive your robot looks, it won’t seem so
smart when it topples over. Based on the open-source
programming language Arduino, T-BOTS use a combination of
accelerometers and gyroscopes to precisely measure their tilt, so they can
maintain their balance as they move around. You can design your own T-BOT
skins, invent games and learn to program using Arduino or just assemble the
robot, download the software and play. Your T-BOT can also be controlled using
your phone or PC. The T-BOT team hopes to raise £100,000 by 22 November.
Amazon’s latest innovation lets
its couriers unlock your front
door and leave your packages
in your home – which, some
online commenters say,
“crosses the creepy line”. The
smart-lock and security-camera
combo – known collectively as
Amazon Key – will cost $249.99
(approximately £189).
The cloud-controlled Cloud
Cam is the ‘brain’ of the
operation and comes with
night vision and two-way audio
to allow customers to remotely
watch their front door being opened.
Once installed, a courier will knock on
your door and, if no one answers, they
can ‘unlock’ your home via an app. The
Cloud Cam then records the courier as
they drop off the delivery, while sensors
in the door and app make sure they
close it behind them. The courier won’t
be authorised to proceed to their next
delivery until they’ve shut and locked
your door.
The Cloud Cam is also being pitched
as a standalone security device, with
motion detection that learns over time
what should and shouldn’t be in your
house. That means footage will be
regularly analysed over the cloud to
detect things like pets, which shouldn’t
be flagged as intruders. Amazon Key is
being launched in 37 US cities, but the
company said it plans to expand the
service in the future.
Does Amazon really want
the key to your house?

Amazon is clearly serious about
its new service and has even
stated that it’ll be “a core part of
the Amazon shopping experience
from this point forward”.
However, customers need not
worry about handing over an
actual key to the company
because the service is much
more sophisticated than that.
For starters, you’ll be able to
watch the entire process live on
your phone if you’re worried
about the courier entering your
home. The system also ensures
that your doors are locked so
that the property is fully secure.

THIS ISSUE’S EXPERT:
Tyler Moffitt, Senior
Threat Research
Analyst at Webroot
(www.webroot.com)
Q
What have been
the worst
ransomware
attacks of 2017?
James Bletchley, Twitter
A
NotPetya came
top of our list as
the most
destructive ransomware
attack of 2017, followed
closely by WannaCry and
Bad Rabbit ransomware
breeds trouble
A new strain of ransomware that
bears a striking resemblance to the
NotPetya threat from earlier this year
(see Security Helpdesk, below) is
spreading through organisations in
eastern Europe. Dubbed ‘Bad Rabbit’,
it has hit government departments
in Ukraine, Kiev’s public transport
system and Russian news agencies.
Bad Rabbit uses the common
ransomware trick of fooling users
into infecting their computers with
malicious files disguised as something
legitimate, in this case an Adobe
Flash installer. The ransomware
slowly encrypts a user’s files after
it is installed and, just like NotPetya,
can schedule an automatic reboot
of the system that shuts down the
computer. Users are then presented
with a splash screen that asks them
to pay 0.05 Bitcoin (around £247)
for a decryption key.
Locky in the number two and
three spots, respectively.
NotPetya took number one
because of its devastating
intent to damage an entire
country’s infrastructure. This
ransomware started as a fake
Ukrainian tax-software
update that, once applied,
spread laterally through
networks like a worm.
Unlike most ransomware
attacks, NotPetya’s code
wasn’t designed to extort
money from its victims but
rather to destroy everything
in its path.
The ransom originally
asked for about $300 (£225)
in Bitcoin, but the system
that collected money from
victims for decryption keys
quickly disintegrated.
NotPetya was designed to do
as much damage to the
Ukrainian infrastructure as
possible. Not only did it shut
down Ukrainian power plants,
banking services and
supermarkets, but NotPetya
also infected hundreds of
thousands of computers in
more than 100 countries.
Additionally, the
ransomware shut down
Maersk, the largest
shipping container vessel
in the world, along with
FedEx (causing a reported
$300m in damage).
WannaCry initially
spread via spam emails,
including fake invoices,
job offers and other traps.
It was the first ransomware
to take the whole world by
storm, infecting several
hundred thousand people
in a single day. Some
reports say the damage
could amount to $4bn.
Luckily, a security
researcher in England
managed to discover
a kill-switch domain, which
was all that was needed
to disable WannaCry.

SECURITY ALERT! | What’s been bothering us this fortnight
Security Helpdesk | Your questions answered by security specialists
Researchers
have already
developed a
vaccine against
BadRabbit, but this
requires creating
a custom file that
blocks the write permissions of the
ransomware. Once you’re infected,
you have little choice but to pay
the ransom or abandon the files.

Dell loses control of customer
backup website
A web address used by Dell to help
customers restore their data was taken
over by a third party for a month,
between mid-June and mid-July.
The built-in backup and recovery
program installed on Dell computers
periodically checks a web address called
DellBackupandRecoveryCloudStorage
.com. A software backup and imaging
company called SoftThinks, one of Dell’s
partners, previously had control
of this address but forgot to renew
the domain in mid-June, leaving it
open to abuse. The site then started
showing up in security alerts for
pushing malicious software.
A spokesperson for Dell told Web
User’s sister site IT Pro that the domain
“expired earlier in 2017 and was
subsequently purchased by a third
party. The domain reference in
the Dell Backup and Recovery (DBAR)
application was not updated, so DBAR
continued to reach out to the domain
after it expired. Dell was alerted
of this error and it was addressed.”
Dell said it doesn’t believe calls
to the URL during the period in
question resulted
in the transfer
of information
to or from the site,
or infected any
users with
malware.

Indiegogo
Marketplace
bit.ly/indie436
Indiegogo is second only to Kickstarter as
a go-to site for crowd-funding projects.
But unless you’re constantly on the
lookout for initiatives to fund, you’re likely
to miss many of its fledgling products.
Indiegogo Marketplace rounds up these
clever innovations and lets you buy them
immediately, with the promise of a refund
if the item isn’t sent within the specified
time. We like the listings’ detailed
explanations and accompanying videos,
the straightforward checkout process
and sheer range of unique items. Just be
aware that most prices are in US dollars.
The Onion
www.theonion.com
The bods behind the popular satirical
news site The Onion have peeled backed
the layers of their previous design and
come up with a less cluttered, more
easily navigable offering that makes
better use of available space. Boiling
down the main links to just Politics,
Sport, Local, Entertainment, Video and
Clickhole (The Onion’s parody of
clickbait), the revamped site has more of
a blog-like feel. It’s still very US-focused
(despite removing the tagline ‘America’s
Finest News Source’) but that’s not to
say it won’t touch your funny bone, and
we like that stories are easy to share.
HUMOUR
Where I Want for Christmas
whereiwantforchristmas.com
Sick of receiving socks for Christmas and just want to get away from it all? Then steer
your friends and family to Virgin Atlantic’s new ‘crowd-funding’ website and you
could be jetting off somewhere warm and relaxing come the New Year. Simply
choose a destination and enter a suitable cost to generate a page asking others to
chip in for your holiday. The hope is that you’ll hit your target and get enough cash
for a return flight, although you can revise the cost up and down should the flight
prices change. It’s a nice, well implemented idea, even if you are restricted to Virgin
flights and its list of destinations. We reckon it’s bound to take off.

Nature’s Calendar
bit.ly/nature436
In its bid to study seasonal changes in
plants and animals, the Woodland Trust
is asking you to help expand its database
by recording your own observations. The
task is made easy, with a step-by-step
process that involves selecting a species
group before noting the event, date and
location, together with a photo and
comments. All your submissions can be
viewed on live maps alongside those of
other contributors, and there’s a small
section of recent records to look at. The
site also explains what’s being recorded
and why, and provides interesting
seasonal and research reports, too.
Cat Friendly Clinic
catfriendlyclinic.org
Created to help vets become more
feline friendly, this informative site is
purr-fect for cat owners, too. As well as
explaining what it means to be a
cat-friendly clinic, it helps you quickly
find suitable local vets simply by entering
your location. It then lists clinics
according to its own gold, silver and
bronze ratings, and lets you see where
they are on a map. You can view the
addresses and websites of most clinics,
and – if you’re a vet – discover how you
can become accredited. There’s also a
donation button to support the charity’s
work, along with links to its other sites.

Reset Era
www.resetera.com
Allegations against the founder of
gaming forum NeoGAF saw the once-
popular site go into meltdown in October.
Rather than abandon the community that
had run for more than a decade, a group
of users decamped to a new message
board called Reset Era, which has
already attracted thousands of members.
As you may expect, the forum isn’t much
to look at aesthetically, departing little
from the look of many other similar
offerings. But for anyone interested in
discussing games, entertainment, sports,
politics and education, it’s already
proving to be a bustling destination with
hundreds of lively discussions.
The Shoe Shack
www.theshoeshack.co.uk
This online shoe shop is heading in the
right direction with a polished look and
easily navigable design that makes
finding and buying footwear a breeze.
Broken down into five main categories
covering shoes for women, men, girls,
boys and school, there isn’t a huge
choice (just 39 products for women, for
example), but there’s a good selection of
photos, decent descriptions, a simple
checkout process that uses PayPal and
an online message facility if you have any
queries. In all cases, the prices are very
reasonable and if you spend £25 or more,
you get an extra 10% discount. Standard
delivery is also free.

Next Meal
nextmeal.co.uk
Created by Martin Stone, who runs the Muswell Hill Soup Kitchen in North London, this
site aims to help homeless people in the capital find a meal and much-needed support.
It does so by allowing visitors to enter a location before displaying a list of places
willing to assist. Click a result to see an address, opening times, a map and details of
how to call or visit the venue’s site. Crucially – since a homeless person may not have
internet access – each page is simply designed, so anyone with internet access can
print a page of results and hand it to someone in need. Next Meal currently only
caters for London, but it’s an excellent idea that could expand nationwide.

Borrow a Boat
borrowaboat.com
This site aims to make hiring a boat plain
sailing, by giving you access to more
than 13,000 privately owned and local
charter vessels in more than 50 locations
across the world. Finding them is a
simple matter of entering a destination,
boat type and time frame. You’re then
able to see how much a boat costs
to hire and get a feel for its age and
facilities. As well as filtering the results by
price, layout and manufacturer, you can
specify extras such as on-board Wi-Fi or
even a cook. We love the comprehensive
descriptions, but we’d like to see more
boats available to book online rather
than having to contact the boat owner.

a video showing how the company

New Jimdo site builder
Jimdo has launched a new
website-building tool called
Dolphin, which streamlines the
design process for anyone who
wants to quickly build a
templated site. The tool asks
a series of questions to find out
what you need, then designs you
a website based on your answers.
If you connect social-media
accounts, it will grab your photos
and fill the site with content
automatically. The software is
still being tested but you can try
it out for yourself at www.jimdo

Test the speed of your
website in other countries
It’s easy to find out how quickly
your website loads from your
home country, but do you know
how well it performs when people
visit it from overseas? Now you
can find out by going to Website
Speed Test (bit.ly/webst436).
Type in the address of the page
you want to test and select one
of the 14 international locations,
which include New York,
Frankfurt, Singapore and Sydney,
from the drop-down menu.
Then click the Run button for
a breakdown of how long each

Q
I don’t need to earn a fortune
from my website, but I’d like
it to cover its costs. What’s
the best way to create a small income
from a website?
Tristram Newstead, via email
A
The easiest way to earn an income
from your website is to place
adverts alongside your content that
pay out when a visitor clicks them. The most
common program for this is Google
Adwords. The amount you earn depends
on how many clicks you get but also on
the topic of your content, because some
subjects can result in far larger payments
than others. A website specialising in legal
information, for example, may earn five
times the revenue for every click of a site
offering software downloads.

Watch live coverage of
The Ashes on BT Sport
From 23 November
In a major win over Sky, BT Sport has gained exclusive rights
to the 2017-18 Ashes as part of a new five-year deal with
Cricket Australia. The first of the five Test Matches starts on
23 November at The Gabba in Brisbane (22 November here in
Blighty) and is followed by the first-ever Ashes Day Night Test
match, which will take place at the Adelaide Oval.
The live coverage includes an all-star line-up of pundits.
Joining former English and Australian cricket captains Michael
Vaughan and Ricky Ponting in the commentary box will be
Geoffrey Boycott, Adam Gilchrist, Graeme Swann and Damien
Fleming. BT Sport’s Matt Smith will present the coverage.
As well as screening every minute of live action on TV, in the
BT Sport app and online at sport.bt.com – where the “enhanced
video player” will provide an interactive timeline and in-depth
real-time statistics – BT Sport will show a daily 90-minute
highlights programme. Short highlights of the Ashes will also
be available for free every evening from 7pm through the
website and app. With Australia’s David Warner promising
“hatred” and “war”, let’s hope England can retain the title.
Pick of the fortnight
Download Doctor Who: Shada
From 24 November
Thirty-eight years after filming was
abandoned due to BBC strike action,
the ‘lost’ Doctor Who story Shada
has been completed (again) using
a combination of original footage,
animation and specially recorded
dialogue. Tom Baker and Lalla Ward
reprise their roles as the Doctor and
his companion Romana, following the
original Douglas Adams script to bring
the six-part serial to life. Unlike previous
recreations of Shada (and there have
been several), the production team had
access to nearly seven hours of raw
footage from the original 1979 shoot,
which they used to edit the new version
from scratch after scanning the original
film negatives in full HD. The new
episodes come in the wake of last
year’s successful animated recreation
of the lost 1966 Doctor Who story
The Power Of The Daleks.
Shada will be available as a digital
download from iTunes initially (bit.ly/
shada436) before being released on
DVD and Blu-ray on 4 December.
Watch Marvel’s The Punisher
From 17 November
Marvel’s Netflix series are among the
most popular on the streaming service,

Punisher, which is based on the Marvel
Comics character of the same name,
to also prove a hit with viewers. The

vigilante Frank ‘The Punisher’ Castle, as
he uncovers a conspiracy involving the
people responsible for the death of his
family, and exacts his deadly revenge.

that invites “bingeing Britons” to
engage in spoiler-filled conversations
and discuss fan theories. The Club
kicked off on 31 October with a group
chat about Netflix original series
Stranger Things 2, hosted by YouTube
personality Wall of Comedy.
Watch Irish-language shows
on iPlayer
The BBC has apparently remembered
that iPlayer is supposed to cater for the
whole of the UK, and has launched a
new portal that makes programmes for
viewers in Northern Ireland easier to
find. Irish-language programmes
include Ar Bhealach na Gaeltachta,
in which presenter Conall Ó Máirtín
visits the islands and coastal Gaeltacht
regions around Donegal, and the
music series Trad Ar Fad!. Meanwhile,
Ulster-Scots programming will include
three series of Brave New World,
which explores Ulster’s links with
Canada, the US and New Zealand.
All programmes on the Northern
Ireland portal (bit.ly/nireland436)

Roku Head-To-Head Product Test
15 - 28 November 2017 23
Discuss this review at forum.webuser.co.uk
If you’re looking for
a great-value streaming
device, you won’t be
disappointed with the
Express. It’s a refined
product that’s been
through a great number
of iterations and has all the
same basic functionality
as the more expensive
Streaming Stick+.
In general use on a regular
HD TV, you’d struggle to
notice the difference.
The Streaming Stick+
has a number of benefits,
though, including
a Bluetooth remote and
the ability to switch to
a second Wi-Fi network.
But the real deciding
factor is whether you want
4K. If you don’t need it yet,
the Express is perfectly
sufficient. But if you’re
planning to upgrade to 4K
and UltraHD any time soon,
you may as well spend the
extra on the Streaming
Stick+ and enjoy the
significant bonus of its
bundled benefits.
Remote control
One thing that has changed
is that Roku has modified
the shortcut buttons on its
remote. Where our last Roku
remote had buttons for
Netflix, YouTube and Google
Play, this one looks like it’s got
some new sponsors. You still
get Netflix but its button sits
alongside arguably less
universal providers: Red Bull
TV, Rakuten TV (movie
rentals) and Yupp TV
(South Asian channels).
The Express remote uses
infrared so you have to point
it at the Roku box to operate
it, while the Stick+ remote is
Bluetooth, so it can point in
any direction so long as
you’re in range. This sounds
like a superfluous luxury but
is actually vital because
there’s no clear line of sight
for infrared to operate
between your sofa and the
back of the TV where the
Stick+ is plugged in. It’s also
a fantastic excuse for
unfettered sloth since you
don’t even have to lift your
arm to control the device.
One day all remotes will
be like this.
Interestingly, the remote of
the Stick+ still has an infrared
beamer built into it, and has
three more buttons than the
Express remote: a power
button, and volume up and
down. These aren’t for the
Roku itself, but can be used
to control the main volume
and standby setting of your
TV, via the TV’s own infrared
receiver. Our first thought was
that this would require some
fiddly and time-consuming
setup – but no, the Roku has
a go at doing this all by itself
and we were more than
pleasantly surprised when
it set up the option perfectly
on the Panasonic TV
we tested the devices on.
Resolution and
hardware
The main difference between
the two devices is the
resolution. If you have a 4K
TV or are thinking of getting
one, the Streaming Stick+ is
the obvious option. We found
that, when plugging it in, our
TV and the Roku’s apps were
able to automatically detect
that a 4K device was in use,
so we could access 4K
programming on apps that
supported it and got invited
to join the BBC iPlayer’s
UltraHD trial. The Express
supports the more standard
1080p (Full HD), which is
compatible with most
modern TVs.
The other significant
difference is that the Express
only works with 2.4GHz Wi-Fi
networks, while the Streaming
Stick+ can connect to 5GHz
networks, too. It’s helpful to
have two networks to choose
from if your internet traffic
is heavy but it can lead to
complications if you’re trying
to connect to the Roku from
other devices, because you
might need to work out which
network you’re on before
connecting to it.
We miss some of the
hardware options that used to
be available on previous Roku
models, though. We’re still
mourning the passing of
Ethernet sockets, which were
OUR VERDICT
great if your device was near
your router or you used
HomePlugs to beat problems
with your Wi-Fi’s reach.
There’s also no USB socket
for streaming music, photos
and videos from a USB stick,
though we guess that’s
probably just something
people don’t do any more.
There’s no headphone socket
either, which was a brilliant
addition to the Roku 3.
Choice of apps
One of the big plus points
of Roku devices was the
wealth of available apps and
this, thankfully, continues to
be the case with these latest
devices. On a basic level, you
can get all the UK terrestrial
catchup services: BBC iPlayer,
ITV Hub, All 4 and Demand 5.
While the iPlayer is almost
universal across streaming
devices, you’d be surprised
how many don’t offer access
to some of the commercial
catchup services.
It’s also strong on the
streaming services, with apps
for Netflix and Amazon Prime
Video leading the charge,
backed up with a range of
rental options, from Google
Play and Sky Store to Rakuten
and Sainsbury’s, so you can
browse around and find the
best deal on any movie or TV
series you might be interested
in. This means you aren’t tied
to a single system, so you can
look out for deals and switch
between services as often
as you like.

Product Test Motorola Moto G5S
Despite its flaws, the G5S
deserves a lot of praise.
Motorola has improved on
the G5 in many respects,
making this model a true
budget contender. Its
fingerprint reader is fast;
the design is beautiful;
the relatively untouched
Android experience is a
breath of fresh air; and the
camera is simply incredible
at this price. If you’re after
the best-looking budget
smartphone, with the best
camera, then this is it.

Christopher Minasians reviews
the latest budget smartphone
from Motorola
is slated to come to the
phone sometime this winter.
The phone’s performance,
however, is disappointing and
hasn’t improved much over
the G5’s results. This is
because it retains the same
1.4GHz quad-core Snapdragon
430 processor and 3GB of
RAM as its predecessor. In our
benchmark performance tests,
it kept pace with its Moto G5
siblings and was narrowly
beaten by the Vodafone
Smart V8 and Lenovo P2.
With a 3,000mAh battery
replacing the G5’s 2,800mAh,
and feel a lot more upmarket
– the little details, such as its
chamfered edges, are a rare
sight on a budget phone.
Motorola has again opted
for a front-mounted
fingerprint reader, which
doubles up as the Home
button. Turn the phone over
and you’ll notice the G5S’s
protruding camera, but we
like its indented logo, which
provides a subtle finger-hold
that makes the phone easier
to grip single-handed.
There’s a micro-USB port at
the bottom (no USB Type-C,
unfortunately) and, thankfully,
a 3.5mm headphone jack at
the top. Dual-band Wi-Fi
802.11a/b/g/n and Bluetooth
4.1 are also included.
The 5.2in screen is a Full HD
(1,920 x 1,080 pixels) IPS
display, with an impressive
backlight that hit a peak
of 500cd/m2 (candles per
square metre) in our tests.
If you crank the display to
maximum brightness, you’ll
be able to read the screen
in the brightest sunlight.
Image quality is pretty
good across the board, too.
With a contrast ratio of 1,708:1
and the capability to display
80.4% of the sRGB colour
standard, the G5S is able to
produce a reasonable array
of colours, while retaining
the darkest shadows and
brightest whites.
Interface, performance
battery and camera
As ever, Motorola hasn’t
tinkered extensively with
Android. Switch on the G5S
and you’re faced with an
almost pristine installation of
Nougat 7.1.1. And there’s more
good news: Android Oreo 8.0
we were hoping for a better
result in our battery-life test,
but the G5S lasted 12hrs
12mins, which marks only
a small improvement over
the G5’s 11hrs 51mins. Both
continue to lag far behind the
Lenovo P2’s incredible battery
life of 28hrs 50mins.
On a more positive note,
the G5S’s camera is its
standout feature and
dramatically better than
similarly priced rivals. It picks
up plenty of light, ekes out
lots of detail and captures
natural-looking colours.
F
ollowing on from the
Moto G5 (which we
reviewed in Issue 423,
bit.ly/webuser423), Motorola
has gone back and tweaked
its budget handset. The Moto
G5S has a larger battery,
an upgraded camera and
a newly refined design.
It’s £20 cheaper at launch
than the G5 was, but the
older phone is now
discounted and costs around
£40 less than the G5S.
Build and screen
Where the G5 merely had
an aluminium rear panel, the
G5S’s unibody design is cast
entirely from aluminium. This
makes the 5.2in phone look

disk is getting full, free up space’, ‘When I get
disconnected from the internet, alert me’
and ‘When there is a new open Wi-Fi spot,

available, sorted into various colour-coded
categories including Productivity, Performance,
Security and Entertainment. You can edit tasks
as required.
Ellp is now out of beta, and this first stable

improvements and new cards get added.
The free cut-down version of Paragon Hard
Disk Manager offers a selection of drive-

Mute every page on
a website in one go
The stable version of Chrome 62 is now
available, and among its otherwise fairly
unexciting list of new features is a useful
tool for controlling the sound on noisy
websites. Instead of right-clicking a
specific tab and choosing ‘Mute tab’,
you can turn off the sound across every
page on a site. To activate the feature,
go to chrome:flags and search for the
entry ‘Sound
content
setting’.
Select
Enabled
from the
drop-down
menu and
restart the
browser.
Now, when
you want to
silence every
page on a website, simply right-click any
of its tabs and choose ‘Mute site’ to turn
off the audio across the board. When
you want to restore the sound, right-
click a tab and select ‘Unmute site’.

Anyone who works for a website will know how
important (and addictive) it is to keep track not only
of the number of visitors to your site but also how
many your competitors attract. TrafikLite (www
.trafiklite.com) is an extension for Chrome, Firefox
and Opera that puts this information at your
fingertips, so you can check the popularity of any
site instantly. Just click the toolbar button to see
the current site’s monthly visitor numbers, Twitter
followers and ‘likes’ on Facebook, as well as its
global ranking. You can also view TrafikLite’s own
‘reputation’ rank for the site as a score out of 10. For
example, the world’s most popular site, Google,
gets 9 out of 10, while Dennis Publishing’s tech-
news site Alphr (www.alphr.com) earns 7 out of 10.

Timestamp videos to resume
watching later
Some video sites remember how much of
a video you’ve watched so you can pick
up where you left off when you next visit.
Others don’t, or they require you to log in
or allow the site to store a
cookie on your computer,
which may not suit your
private-browsing needs.
A new WebExtension
called Media URL
Timestamper (bit.ly/
time436) solves this
problem by letting you
save your place in long videos, podcasts and other streams so you can resume
your watching or listening later. By default, it timestamps all streams that are
more than 10 minutes long at 60-second intervals, but you can easily change the
settings or timestamp videos manually by right-clicking the address-bar icon and
choosing ‘Update timestamp’. The tool works on a wide range of streaming sites,
including YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, Dailymotion and BBC iPlayer.
Try the new LastPass
Now that the fantastic Firefox 57 has
finally arrived – see our Workshop
on page 52 for full details – many

are compatible with the new browser.
One such tool is the popular password
manager LastPass. A beta version
of the LastPass WebExtension
(bit.ly/lastpass436) has been released,
although we
hope the stable
version will be
available by
the time you
read this. As
with the old

you manage

mining your PC
Last issue, we addressed
the growing problem of
websites that sneakily harness
your PC’s processing power
to ‘mine’ for cryptocurrency,
and recommended a Chrome
extension called MinerBlock
(bit.ly/miner435) to stop them.
You can get the same protection
in Opera by installing a new
add-on called Mining Blocker
(bit.ly/mining436), which scans
websites for
mining processes
and code, and
disables them
before the
site loads. The
crypto-blocker
then checks the site again
after it has loaded to ensure no
miner is running. It blocks more
than 20 known cryptocurrency
miners including CoinHive,
JSEcoin and Minecrunch.
Block pop-up ads
in Edge
Like most browsers,
Microsoft Edge has a built-in
pop-up blocker. Go to More,
Settings, ‘View advanced
settings’ and switch on ‘Block
pop-ups’. If you find that
pop-ups – and especially adverts
– still appear, however, you can
increase your blocking power by
installing the new Popup Blocker
extension (bit.ly/popup436).
Any time a website requests to
open a pop-up, this lightweight
tool stops it and lets you accept
or deny the request. You can
also choose to open the pop-up
in a background tab if, for
example, it’s essential for
logging into the site or viewing

If the recent rumours
circulating online are to be
believed, then Snapchat’s
foray into hardware with its
much-hyped Spectacles
(think sunglasses with
built-in cameras) has turned
out to be a colossal flop.
Thankfully, the company’s
short-sightedness doesn’t
extend to its mobile app,
which continues to be
updated with new and
genuinely useful features.
The iOS version of
Snapchat, for example,
has just received a major
update that adds a trio
of very handy abilities.
For starters, it’s implemented a proper sharing option
for iPhone and iPad, which means that you can now easily
post photos, links and more on Snapchat from within other
apps, such as your web browser or the Photos app, via the
Share function. An equivalent feature has been available for
Android users for some time and is long overdue for Apple
Snapchatters – finally, no more tedious copying and pasting
links. We explain how to set up Snapchat’s new sharing
function in our Mini Workshop, right.
Also new is a useful shortcut that
lets you view a friend’s Story or
send them a Snap by long-tapping
their name. And iOS users now get
to choose how long they want to
drop off the radar for in Ghost
Mode (under See My Location in
Settings). Location sharing is a key
part of how Snapchat works, but
not everybody wants to broadcast
their whereabouts all the time.
The new update provides the
option to temporarily disable
Snapchat’s location-sharing
feature for a period of either three
or 24 hours – in addition to just
turning it off until you
turn it back on again. These two features
weren’t available in the Android version of the
app at the time of writing, but are expected
to be added in the very near future.

Our guide to
Blockchain
What is it?
Well, that’s a question and a half.
Blockchain is being heralded as the
next game-changer in technology, but
conveying exactly what it entails is no
mean feat. In the simplest of terms,
blockchains are a method of digital
bookkeeping that chains together
a continuously growing list of
transactions in secure batches of
data known as blocks. They are the
protocol upon which cryptocurrency
services such as Bitcoin are built.
Ah, Bitcoin. Can you explain that
one again?
Sure. Bitcoin (bitcoin.org) is virtual
money that can be transferred direct
from one person to another without
third-party interference from a bank or
central authority. It is secured by military-
grade cryptography and lets you send
and receive payments without revealing
your identity. Some people confuse
Bitcoin with blockchain but this isn’t
quite correct because the blockchain is
the network on which Bitcoin relies. It
just so happens that Bitcoin has become
the first useful application for such
technology. We’ll see more uses soon.
How do blockchains work then?
Basically, whenever a change is made to
a database, it is detailed in a block. When
another change is made, another block is
created and this is added – or chained –
to the previous one. This continues block
after block after block, but here’s the
thing: for a block to be added, it must
be verified by all the previous blocks.
If, for some reason, there appears to be
something amiss, then the block will be
rendered invalid and it won’t be added –
this is crucial for the overall security of
the blockchain.
So each block in a chain could
contain a transaction?
Exactly. Just think of a blockchain as a
publicly available
shared ledger of
records, which
anyone can
browse and verify.
The blocks are
like pages of the
most recent
transactions to
have taken place
and the
verification
process involves
everyone with
access to the
chain (or ledger). Only if everyone agrees
will a new page be added to the back of
the ledger, otherwise it will be rendered
invalid and scrapped.
But how are the blocks verified?
Blockchains use a technology called
hashing (see box, right), which means
every block is assigned a unique number.
This number is called a hash and is a way
of boiling down the hefty amount of data
contained in each block into a smaller
chunk for the purpose of sorting,
referencing and comparing. But here’s
the clever bit. The hash for a new block
FAQ
Everything you need to know about the most
interesting new technology trends and events
Bitcoin uses blockchain technology, but it
isn’t the same as blockchain
Blockchain is like
a ledger to which lots
of people contribute
Blockchain has been
described as “a seismic
shift on par with the
impact of the internet”,
but what on Earth is it?

HOW IS A HASH CREATED AND USED?
15 - 28 November 2017 39
Discuss blockchain at forum.webuser.co.uk
Blockchain
has the hash of the previous block
embedded in it. This ensures that each
block in the chain is inextricably linked.
If there is a break in the chain, it will be
easy to identify.
Could the chain be broken?
Yes, but it would be very difficult to do
so and not just because the whole chain
is protected by complex cryptography.
Let’s say you were able to target a block
in the centre of a Bitcoin chain that
stated you had bought one
coin. If you decided to
falsely alter the
information to say
that you purchased
10 Bitcoins, an
entirely new hash
would be created. This
would place it out of
sync with the blocks
either side, so the
system as a whole
would not validate the
change. The only way
to force that block into
the chain and not invalidate the whole lot
would be to create a new chain from
scratch. Fraudsters would be wasting
their time and energy even trying.
So why is it such a game
changer?
It primarily comes down to the way the
blockchain is stored. Rather than follow,
say, traditional banks, which store
databases on their own servers, the
blocks of a blockchain are scattered
across hundreds of thousands of
computers and there is no master copy.
This makes it difficult to hack because
there is no single go-to location. More
importantly, it means the database is not
under any central, sole authority.
What’s so good about that?
Because one organisation or person is
not able to keep hold of all the records,
the blockchain is
entirely verifiable.
Anyone can check
transactions and
hashes going back to
the start and it will
always remain an
immutable record.
So everything in the
blockchain is
permanent,
unalterable and
accessible to anyone
on the internet.
Indeed, you can
actually download the Bitcoin blockchain
and view transactions in near real-time
(bitcoin.org/en/download) – just be
warned that it’s more than 145GB in size!
Doesn’t that compromise
my privacy?
Privacy is definitely a concern. Many
individuals and companies are wary of
publishing their information to what is, in
effect, a public database that can be read
without restrictions. Furthermore, since
there is no central controlling authority,
there are certain issues of trust. But the
records are at least tamper-proof and
private keys are issued to users to
prevent fake transactions. Just don’t lose
them – otherwise you can wave goodbye
to your Bitcoins!
What else can blockchain
be used for?
Anything to do with transactional data
that can’t be altered after it has been
created. People have looked into using
the technology for the processing of land
titles, or to track and trade stocks and
bonds. Shipping giant Maersk plans to
use blockchain to track flowers and
machine parts on its cargo ships, while
Dubai is seeking to trace goods through
its ports via blockchain. Six big banks
including Barclays and HSBC hope to let
financial markets settle transactions
using a digital-cash equivalent called the
Utility Settlement Coin.
Could blockchain be used for
illegal activities?
Sadly, yes. Criminals already use
virtual currencies to obscure their
identities during transactions
and to funnel their finances
around the world. Former
Dark-Web operator Ross Ulbricht ran a
hidden website called Silk Road that sold
illegal drugs to people using Bitcoin. It
shows that many people are seeking to
take advantage of the way blockchain
technology works.
And could it affect our economy?
Possibly. Imagine that a blockchain-
based virtual currency replaced national
currencies in the global financial system.
Governments would lose control – they
wouldn’t be able to devalue their
currencies in a meaningful way. This is a
long way off, however, and certainly not
something to worry about right now.
You can’t break a
blockchain to
increase the
value of your
Bitcoin stack
Shipping company Maesrk is planning to
use blockchain to track its cargo
Blockchains use
a system called
hashing, which
creates a unique
value for every set of
data. In each case,
however, the length
of the hash is the
same. So, let’s say
we had the sentence
“i love web user” in a
block. This could result in a seven-
figure hash of 7fgs637.
But now let’s say the following block
contained a second sentence: “i love
web user a lot”. Again, we could get a
seven-figure hash (perhaps 8f6e67a).
This time, however, the hash for the
previous block has formed part of the
data used in generating the second.
This is very important.
Why? Well, if you
subsequently try to
change the first
block – maybe by
adding capitals
(“I Love Web User”),
an entirely new hash
would be formed for
it. That would have
a knock-on effect
on the second hash,
rendering it invalid. If there are third,
fourth, fifth hashes and so on, then
they’d be affected too, all along
the line.
To rectify the problem, you’d need to
go back to where the problem began –
at the stage where the capitals were
added. Of course, the complications
are somewhat deeper, but the intrinsic
linking of the blocks aids security.

in the world, but that
doesn’t mean it’s the best option
for your personal computing needs.
And while Windows 10 is generally
reliable, Microsoft has been accused
of taking liberties with users’ privacy
ever since its launch in 2015 – only
last month, the Dutch Data
Protection Authority found it guilty
of multiple privacy violations.
On top of that, users have reported
update problems, and the recent Fall
Creators Update disappointingly
failed to bring any interesting new
additions to the table (well, Desktop).
As of next year, you won’t even be
able to get Windows 10 for free via
the assistive upgrade, after Microsoft
announced it will close the loophole
on 31 December (bit.ly/assist436).
Fortunately, there are alternatives
to Windows that are constantly
improving and adding new features,
and you can run them on your current
PC without having to upgrade your
hardware. In this feature, we explain
how to install and make the most of
Chrome OS, Linux and MacOS, and
offer reasons why you might (and
might not) decide to use them
instead of Windows.
We’re not suggesting you abandon
Windows for good, so there’s no
need to regret splashing out on that
new PC or laptop. With our help,
however, you can try a different
operating system for size – to see for
yourself what advantages it offers.
Windows isn’t the only operating system for
your computer – and it may not even be the best.

Chrome OS, but don’t let that put you
off. Fast, reliable Wi-Fi is everywhere
these days, so it’s rare that you’ll be
stuck without a working internet
connection for long. Even if you can’t
find a wireless hotspot, you can always
turn your mobile phone into a portable
one, solving the problem temporarily.
You have to use web apps with
Chrome OS, which means you won’t be
able to install your favourite Desktop
programs, such as Photoshop Elements
and Microsoft Office. However, you can
use online versions or web-based
alternatives that work just as well.
There are also plenty of Chrome apps
that you can use offline – see page 43
for five of our favourites.
Google doesn’t make Chrome OS
available for download (otherwise
people wouldn’t buy its Chromebooks),
but you can get around this limitation
by installing Chromium OS, the open-
source operating system it’s based on.
SWITCH TO CHROME OS
How to switch to
Chrome OS:
To use the official Chrome OS, you
need a Chromebook – take a look
at our three recommendations
on page 42. If you’re happy
to settle for Chromium OS
(which is close enough),
you have two main choices.
The oddly named website
ArnoldTheBats World of
Whimsy (chromium.arnoldthebat
.co.uk) hosts daily, weekly and special
builds of the operating system. There
are three different types: CARMOS, for
devices powered by ARM processors;
Camd64OS for 64-bit systems; and
Cx86OS for 32-bit systems.
The other option is to install
CloudReady: Home Edition (www
.neverware.com), which is essentially
a version of Chromium OS designed
to run on home PCs. The installation
process is fairly straightforward but you
need to be able to boot into a USB flash
drive. Most PCs are set to do this
automatically but if yours isn’t, watch
the screen when you first turn on your
system and follow the instructions for
which key you need to press to enter
Why Chrome OS is better than
Windows:
Windows’ size and drain on system
resources make it a bit of a bloated
beast, and the OS needs regular
maintenance. So if you’re not using
your computer for high-end
tasks, such as playing 3D
games and intensive video
editing, it can seem like overkill
– especially now that we download
fewer programs than ever. If, like many
people, you only use your computer to
browse the web, check your email and
social-media accounts, stream music
and write documents in a word
processor, Chrome OS is likely to
provide everything you need with
less hassle.
Given that we perform so many of our
computing tasks online these days, it
makes sense to use a modern operating
system that’s designed purely for use
on the web – which is exactly the aim of
Google’s OS. Unlike Windows, it’s very
lightweight, which means it starts
quickly and runs beautifully, even if you
run it on an older computer with a lower
specification.
Once you’re used to working in the
cloud and storing all your personal files
there, you might find it difficult to
switch back to Windows. The ability
to access everything from anywhere
(as long as you’re online) is refreshingly
convenient.
What you should be aware of:
Chrome OS runs on Chromebooks and
Chromeboxes, which are lightweight,
and (usually) inexpensive devices. You
need an internet connection to use
1
Go to bit.ly/cr436 and click to
download USB Maker for Windows 7
and newer. Run it and choose the
version of CloudReady you need 1
and the drive you want to install it on.
You should use an 8GB or 16GB model
– larger versions aren’t ideal, and
SanDisk drives are not recommended.
2
The creation process shouldn’t take
long. Once it has finished, plug the
USB drive into the computer you want
to use with CloudReady and power it up
or reboot it. The computer should
recognise the drive and run the
CloudReady installer. When prompted,
select your language 1 and keyboard. 2

Click the Let’s Go button, select
your network and sign in with your
Google account details. Next, click the

use it as the computer’s only OS or
install it alongside Windows.

Once you’re in the BIOS or UEFI screen,
look for a boot-order menu and set it so
that the USB flash drive is first to boot.
When you install CloudReady, you can
choose whether to use it as your only
OS or install it as a dual-boot system
alongside Windows. If you opt for the
latter, you can set which of the two
operating systems you want to launch
when you switch on your PC. See our
Mini Workshop on page 41 to find out
how to get started with CloudReady.
EXPERT TIPS
FOR USING CHROME OS
Customise how Chrome OS looks
As with Windows, you can customise
the Chrome OS Desktop’s colour
scheme and background. To change the
Desktop wallpaper, find an image you
like on the web and download it (if you
need some inspiration, search for
‘desktop wallpaper’ to see thousands of
images). Close your browser, right-click
the Desktop and select ‘Set wallpaper’.
Click the plus button, then click ‘Choose
file’. Select the Downloads folder and
double-click the image you want to use.
To position your image, choose Centre,
Centre Cropped or Stretched,
depending on which looks best.
To apply a theme to Chrome OS, go to
Settings and, in the Appearance section,
click Themes. This opens the Chrome
Web Store and displays the available
themes. Browse them and when you
find one you like, select it and click the
Install button.
Perform calculations and
conversions
The search box in the Chrome OS
launcher (the equivalent of the
Windows Start menu) does more than
just find information. For example, you
can also use it to perform calculations.
Click the search box and type 23.78
* 54.12. Chrome opens to show the
answer and also displays a calculator
keyboard in case you want to use the
answer to do further calculations.
You can also use the search box to
convert quantities from one unit to
another. For example, it can convert
miles to kilometres, pounds (in weight)
to kilograms, and pounds sterling to US
dollars using the current exchange rate.
Enter the conversion you want, such as
‘$50 in pounds’, ‘1 light year in miles’ or
‘3 tablespoons in millilitres’. Chrome OS
can convert almost anything into
another corresponding unit.
Google Pixelbook
£999 from bit.ly/pixel436
There’s no question that the Google
Pixelbook is expensive, but its
gorgeous two-tone design, backlit
keyboard, rotatable screen and
super-thin (10mm), lightweight (1kg)
build make it a pleasure to use. Its
specs are more in keeping with its
Windows 10 rivals, too, with a choice
of Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processor;
128GB, 256GB or 512GB of storage;
and up to 16GB of RAM. It’s the first
laptop to come with Google Assistant
built in, allowing you to perform
everyday actions using your voice.
It may be pricey, but it’s now the
Chromebook that sets the standard.
BEST NEW CHROMEBOOKS TO BUY
Acer Chromebook R11
£240 from bit.ly/acerr436
The Acer Chromebook R11 is an
incredibly versatile device at a
fantastic price. With just 2GB of RAM
(and 16GB of drive space), it’s by no
means the most powerful Chromebook
available, but it’s more than good
enough for browsing the web and
working with apps. The touchscreen
is versatile, too, because it allows you
to scroll through web pages and press
buttons with your fingers rather than
using the touchpad. The option of
flipping it into tablet mode is a
valuable extra, although the 11in screen
is relatively small and its battery lasted
less than nine hours in our tests.
HP Chromebook 14 G4
£325 from bit.ly/hpchrome436
HP’s latest Chromebook is very well
constructed. It weighs just over 1kg
and has more memory (4GB) and a
faster processor (1.83GHz) than many
other models at this price. It’s also
very easy to use, with a large
touchpad and three USB ports for
connecting peripherals, but its main
selling point is its generous 14in
screen, which is even larger than the
Google Pixelbook’s. What’s more,
unlike most Windows laptops, this
Chromebook is extremely quiet and
offers a decent battery life, as well as
32GB of built-in storage plus an extra
100GB from Google Drive.

Google’s Chrome OS makes excellent
use of keyboard shortcuts, but there are
far too many to remember. Press
Ctrl+Alt+? to bring up an onscreen
keyboard. If you then press the Shift,
Ctrl and Alt keys in various
combinations, the available keyboard
shortcuts will appear on the keys.
Move or hide the shelf
Chrome OS has a ‘shelf’ bar at the
bottom of the screen that’s similar to
the Windows taskbar, containing a
search button, app launcher and icons
for frequently used apps. Right-click an
empty part of the Desktop and a menu
appears that lets you position the shelf
to the left, right or bottom of the screen.
You can also set it to hide automatically.
Perform a barrel roll
This isn’t particularly useful, but it’s fun.
Open a few windows in Chrome OS,
then hold Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Reload (or F3)
and the screen will perform a barrel roll.
The same happens if you type
do a barrel roll into the browser.
Redeem special offers
If you buy a Chromebook, you can enjoy
special offers for services including
Google Play, Google Play Music and

Polarr is undoubtedly the best
image-editing app for Chrome OS,
with many of the advanced features
offered by traditional Desktop
software. It includes in-depth tutorials
to help you get to grips with its many
tools, and records every edit you
make in case you need to undo any.
Offline highlights include face
detection; clone, masking and
brushing tools; more than 100 filters;
and the ability to add watermarks.
Pocket

The Chrome app for the advanced
bookmarking tool pulls together all
your online articles, videos, images
and links, so you can read and view
them offline. Pocket works within its
own app window, presenting your
entries in a list or tile view and giving
you a snapshot of their content.
Naturally, you need to go online to
save the content, but you can tag,
search and ‘favourite’ items offline,
and archive or delete those you’ve
finished with.
History Eraser App
bit.ly/history436
History Eraser protects your privacy
by performing basic maintenance
such as clearing Chrome’s history,
emptying the cache, clearing saved
passwords and removing cookies.
It works offline in its own window and
lets you specify time frames for
deleting items – for example, the last
four days. Best of all, there are backup
and restore options in case you delete
something accidentally.
Screencastify
bit.ly/screen436
Although you can’t install traditional
video-capture software in Chrome
OS, you can use the brilliant
Screencastify to
record what’s
playing in a tab,
on your Desktop
or via your
webcam.
Screencastify
supports offline
recording
(up to 10
minutes), offers
a selection of
drawing tools
for annotating
your videos and
lets you save
recordings locally or in Google Drive,
or upload them to YouTube when you

Solitaire
bit.ly/solitaire436
This offline version of the card game
gives you the choice of nine Solitaire
variants including Klondike, Forty
Thieves, Pyramid and three variations
of Spider. Each game offers useful
options to undo unlimited moves;
hints for when you get stuck; and the
option to restart a game with the
same cards. It certainly beats the
ad-stuffed Windows 10 app!

SWITCH TO LINUX
Why Linux is better than
Windows:
Windows comes in a variety of paid-for
editions (such as Windows 7 and
Windows 10), each of which offers
several different versions (Home, Pro
and, in the case of Windows 10, S).
The one you opt for will depend on your
budget and computing needs, but if
you’re buying a new PC, it will almost
certainly come with Windows 10
preinstalled, and there are plenty of
people yet to be convinced about the
benefits of Microsoft’s latest OS.
With Linux, there are a lot of different
operating systems – or ‘distros’ – to pick
from and they’re all free. Depending on
what you intend to do with your OS,
you’ll be able to find a distro that’s
perfect for your needs. For example,
Ubuntu (www.ubuntu.com) and Mint
(linuxmint.com) are ideal if you’re
switching from Windows; Elementary
OS (elementary.io) is a good choice if
you’re accustomed to using a Mac; and
LXLE (www.lxle.net) is perfect for
anyone who wants to run an OS on an
old or slow system.
The beauty of Linux operating
systems is that you don’t have to just
pick one and stick with it. You can run
any OS directly from a DVD or USB flash
drive, try it for as long as you like and
then install it if you decide it’s for you.
Another benefit is that, although Linux
operating systems are free, you’re not
necessarily forced into updating to the
latest version (as you are with Windows
10). Opt for an LTS (Long Term Support)
version and you’ll receive five years of
isn’t that difficult – a lot of popular
distros, including Ubuntu and Mint,
look and work in much the same way
as Microsoft’s OS. However, performing
some operations, such as installing
software and making major changes,
involves a bit of a learning curve.
You can run Windows software on
Linux, but you first have to install the
WINE (www.winehq.org) compatibility
layer. WINE (Wine Is Not an Emulator)
can run most Windows programs
flawlessly, exactly as if they were running
on Microsoft’s OS. You can also use
WINE as the default installer for your
Windows programs, which saves you
the hassle of having to configure them.
Another thing to be aware of is that
1
Download the ISO image file from
linuxmint.com, write it to a disc or
USB flash drive, and boot from it.
You’ll be greeted by the Desktop and
can start using the OS without making
any permanent changes to your
computer. It works like Windows –
click the Mint button 1 to open the
equivalent of the Windows Start menu.
2
Try Mint out for as long as you like.
Once you’re ready to install the OS,
double-click the Install Linux Mint icon
on the Desktop. 1 A wizard will open.
Select your language and click Continue.
Tick the box to allow the installer to
fetch third-party software for graphics
and Wi-Fi. 2
3
Click the Continue button. If you’re
installing Mint on a clean hard
drive, select ‘Erase disk and install
Linux Mint’. 1 If you want to create or
resize a partition for the OS first, tick
‘Something else’ 2 instead. While Mint
is installing, set your location and
keyboard layout, and enter your
details.

which means your PC won’t be left
vulnerable to malware threats and
performance problems but you can still
stick with an OS you are familiar with
and not have unwanted ‘improvements’
foisted on you.
What you should be aware of:
Linux isn’t actually an operating system,
it’s a kernel – the central component
that operating systems are built around
(Windows is built around a Windows
kernel). There’s a chance that you may
already be using Linux without realising
– Android, Google’s mobile operating
system, is actually based around it.

Linux has different Desktop
environments (interfaces) to choose
from, including Cinnamon, Unity,
GNOME and MATE. So once you’ve
decided which operating system you
want, you have another choice to make
– which may be one step too many for
some people. Linux Mint, for example,
is available in 32- and 64-bit variations,
and with Cinnamon, KDE, MATE and
Xfce Desktop environments.
How to switch to Linux:
Simply decide which Linux operating
system you want, then download it. You
can then write it to a DVD or USB flash
drive, boot into it, try it out and then
install it. You can dual-boot the distro
alongside Windows if you want, which
will allow you to choose which operating
system you prefer to use at boot up.
To do this, install Windows first, then
create a partition for installing your
Linux OS. Boot from your live Linux disc
or flash drive and select the install
option. The ‘Installation type’ screen
should show you an option to ‘Install
Linux OS alongside Windows’ (the
actual wording will vary depending
on the operating system).
EXPERT TIPS
FOR USING LINUX DISTROS
Learn Linux commands
You can use the main Linux interface
for pretty much everything, but typing
commands into the text-based Terminal
window saves a lot of time. To master all
the available commands, we recommend
using the ‘apropos’ command with a
description. Typing apropos editor,
for example, will show a list of all the
commands that relate to any editing
programs on your system.
Make the most of Sudo
Of all the commands you can use in
Linux, Sudo (‘super user do’) is the one
you’ll want to be most familiar with.
It essentially runs any command that
follows with elevated privileges – a bit
like running something in administrator
mode in Windows. There are some
switches you can use with it, such as
sudo –b, which runs the command
in the background, and sudo su, which
makes you the root user (‘su’ stands
for switch user).
You can use Sudo to quickly install
applications. For example, typing
sudo apt-get install gimp
installs the popular image editor Gimp.
Auto-hide the Dock in Ubuntu
By default, the Dock remains visible
on the left side of the screen at all times.
If you don’t like it taking up space, you
can hide or unhide the launcher.
In the latest version of Ubuntu, click
the down arrow at the top right, click
the Settings button and select Dock on
the left, then choose to Auto-hide the
Dock. You can also change its position
by moving it to another screen edge.
The WINE compatibility layer lets you run Windows software in Linux
Ubuntu has a familiar appearance for
anyone used to Windows
TERMINAL KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
Make your actions more efficient in Terminal – Linux’s version of the Windows
Command Prompt – by memorising these handy shortcuts:
Moves the cursor to the start of the line.
Moves the cursor to the end of the line.
Jumps to the next space.
Jumps back to the previous space.
Deletes all text before the cursor.

SWITCH TO MacOS
SWITCH TO MacOS
Why MacOS is better than
Windows:
The Mac interface is renowned for being
very intuitive to use, with its
customisable dock that contains
shortcuts to all your favourite programs
and folders. Also, MacOS and iOS work
together beautifully – you can start
performing an action on one device,
then switch to another and pick up
where you left off. If you own an iPhone
or iPad, you can access pretty much
anything on any of your Apple devices.
When you copy something on your
iPhone – provided you have Bluetooth
turned on and are logged into iCloud
– you can paste the item directly into
a program on your Mac.
The apps that come bundled with
MacOS are (arguably) better than their
Windows equivalents, and Siri is at least
on a par with Cortana in the battle of
the digital assistants.
Furthermore, as we’ve often reported,
Windows 10 spies on its users, and
comes with advertising (or ‘suggestions’,
tips and promotions, as Microsoft calls
them) throughout. MacOS doesn’t force
these invasions of privacy and space
on its users.
What you should be aware of:
You really need an Apple computer to
run MacOS – that could be a MacBook
or an iMac, iMac Pro or Mac Mini – and
they are far from cheap. There is a way
around this restriction, and that’s to
build a so-called ‘hackintosh’ – non-
Apple hardware that’s been ‘hacked’
to let it run the Mac operating system.
However, it’s important to know that
Apple frowns on hackintoshes (not least
because it provides a way for people
to avoid buying Apple hardware)
and the licence agreement that comes
with MacOS specifies that you’re not
allowed to install it on non-Apple
hardware. So if you do, Apple could
potentially sue you for copyright
infringement and breach of contract.
It won’t, of course, but you should still
be aware of the potential risks.
How to switch to MacOS:
The quickest and easiest method of
switching to MacOS is to – you guessed
it – buy an Apple computer that comes
with the operating system preinstalled.
If you can’t afford to do that, or you
decide to go down the hackintosh route,
you’ll first need a copy of the OS, which
you’ll have to get by using an actual Mac
and downloading it from the Mac App
Store. Once you have that, you’ll need
to make changes to your computer’s
BIOS/UEFI, install the OS, install the
required drivers and update your
device. It’s a long process that may send
you crying back to Windows.
You can find an ‘Always up-to-date’
guide at bit.ly/hackintosh436 that tells
There are lots of fantastic games and apps to be found on Google Play
– a much better selection than what’s on offer in the Windows Store. Running
Android apps in Windows, rather than on a phone or tablet, is actually very
straightforward: you just need an Android emulator such as MEmu (www
.memuplay.com) or Bluestacks (www.bluestacks.com).
These free programs emulate Google’s mobile operating system on your
PC monitor and let you run virtually any Android app you like. You can either
install apps that are available
on Google Play or sideload
ones from other sources.
The apps can be viewed in
a window or full-screen,
and controlled using your
mouse rather than your
finger (unless you have
a touchscreen). You can
also sync them with your
Android device.

EXPERT TIPS
FOR USING MACOS
Optimise your file storage
The latest version of MacOS, High Sierra,
offers useful options for optimising your
storage. To access them, click the Apple
menu in the top-left corner of your
screen and choose About This Mac. You
can set your Mac to keep photos, music
and other downloads on your Mac only
until storage is low, and then hive it off
onto iCloud Drive. This is a big help for
anyone with a small drive – including
those with only 128GB of space.
Another option designed to save
space is the ability to optimise all
storage on your Mac. Open iCloud Drive
options and you can set up iCloud Drive
to keep all your files on your Mac until it
starts to fill up. Sierra will then start to
move files you haven’t used for a long
time online, easing the load on your
local storage.
Manage files in a tabbed window
The MacOS file manager, Finder, is now
available in every application. This
means that rather than having multiple
windows open, you can now keep
things tidy by putting all your open
documents in a single tabbed window
instead. The best thing about this
feature is that it will work with any app
that uses standard windows, without
you having to make any changes.
Relive your memories as
slideshows
One of the most interesting tools in High
Sierra is Memories, which is a new
feature in the Photos app. As with the
version in iOS 10 – and a similar tool in
Google Photos – it carries out smart
image analysis to group your pictures
together into ‘memories’, based on their
location, subjects’ faces and more. The
idea is to resurface your best pictures,
such as a set from last year’s camping
holiday in France or all the photos
featuring a particular person.
You can view your memories as
a slideshow by double-clicking a set,
clicking the Play button and choosing
Play Slideshow. Slideshows can also be
customised using the theme and music
of your choice.

week, without you needing to leave the
page. Your focus, lists and all other
settings are synced between all your
computers when you log in with the
same Momentum account.
How it can be improved:
Our only gripe with Momentum is that
some of its best features – including
integration with Todoist and the option
to add longer notes – are only available
when you upgrade to Momentum Plus
for a far-too-expensive $29.95
(approximately £23) a year.
OUR VERDICT
Momentum manages to fit an
impressive number of useful tools
into a page that’s both attractive
and simple to use. If you’re looking
to be more productive, this add-on
is a great starting point.
New Tab pages can
make your browsing
experience faster and
more productive.

Chrome New Tab pages
15 - 28 November 2017 49
Discuss New Tab pages at forum.webuser.co.uk
What we liked:
If you’re not a fan
of Chrome’s default
bookmarks bar,
Infinity offers
an excellent
alternative. Its simple,
intuitive grid of app
shortcuts and bookmarks (along
with a Google search bar) make
it easier than ever to find your
favourite websites and services.
The New Tab page is fully
customisable, so you can rearrange,
add and remove shortcuts, and even
choose the number of icons to display.
By default, it includes apps for History,
Bookmarks and Apps, so you don’t
need to use Chrome’s built-in tools.
You can add more apps by clicking the
‘+’ icon and searching Infinity’s library
or save any web page by clicking the
Infinity icon (in the toolbar) when
you’re viewing it.
Infinity’s free cloud syncing means the
launcher will look the same on all your
PCs. You can upload your own wallpaper
and add additional search engines. One
standout feature is that its icons can

If you worry that
you’re easily
distracted online,
Be Limitless could
help you get more
done. It’s a newcomer
to Chrome and, like our
Gold Award winner, puts a range
of handy tools at your fingertips,
letting you set a goal for the day,
create to-do lists and notes, and even
send emails from your Google account.
Similar to Momentum, it also shows
a new quote and wallpaper every day
to inspire you.
The extension’s standout feature is
that it provides detailed insights into
how you’ve been using the web. Every
day, it keeps track of how much time
you’ve spent on social media and email
(you have to tell it which categories
some sites belong to), and you can
add your own labels such as ‘work’
or ‘shopping’. What’s more, it lets you
explicitly specify which sites are
productive, so it can give you an overall
productivity score for the day.
How it can be improved:
Be Limitless has a more confusing
interface than our other award winners.

display live info, including the current
weather and Gmail’s unread count.
How it can be improved:
Infinity’s launcher-style interface is a
little dull and it doesn’t let you see to-do
lists and the like at a glance. It also takes
a little longer to set up than our Gold
Award winner.
OUR VERDICT
Infinity provides the tools to add
a fully customisable launcher to
your New Tab page. It’s fast, free
and easy to use, making it an
excellent choice for anyone who
wants more than Chrome’s default.
OUR VERDICT
There’s no need to guess how much
time you’ve wasted on the web with
Be Limitless, because it tells you!
However, if tracking your
productivity isn’t of interest to you,
you’re better off with one of our
other award winners.
Speed Dial 2
bit.ly/speeddial436
Speed Dial 2 is an excellent
launcher-style New Tab page that
provides instant access to your
most visited pages, bookmarks
and history. It’s super fast and there
are loads of customisation options,
but it lacks the productivity tools
of our other award winners, and you
need to pay a one-off fee of $4.99
(around £4) to enable syncing
between devices.
Save to Pocket
bit.ly/pocketc436
Trending stories are put on every
New Tab page when you install
Save to Pocket, and you can open
them there and then, or opt to save
them for reading later on your PC,
phone or tablet with a single click.
The extension can also display your
most visited sites and bookmarks,
but otherwise it has no standout
features and we found it distracting
rather than helping us focus
on our work.
Beautab
bit.ly/beautab436
Beautab won the Gold Award in our
last round up but, unfortunately,
it’s not been updated since, which
makes us worry that it may no
longer be supported. If that doesn’t
put you off, then it’s well worth
installing because it includes an
excellent range of productivity
features including daily goals,
a to-do list, countdown timer and
a note-taking tool.

Amazon Household lets you share your
Prime benefits with one other adult
Spotify Premium for Family costs from
£2.50 per person per month
Netflix’s Premium plan lets you stream
content to four devices at the same time
50 15 - 28 November 2017
Share your Amazon Prime
benefits
If one of your household is already an
Amazon Prime subscriber, you don’t
have to log into their account to enjoy
Prime benefits such as free next-day
delivery and Prime Video streaming
– Amazon lets you share a Prime
membership between two accounts
using its Amazon Household option.
To set this up, visit www.amazon.co.uk/
myh/households on the account with
Prime membership and select ‘Add an
Adult’. Log in with the secondary
account and you can start sharing
Prime benefits across the two accounts
at no additional cost.
Prime benefits can’t be shared with
children’s accounts, but clicking ‘Add a
Child’ from the Household page lets you
share digital content with your children
and manage the parental controls on
their Amazon devices.
Add multiple profiles to your
Netflix account
You can stream Netflix on more than
one device at a time, as long as you’ve
signed up to the right plan. Currently,
the Standard plan (which costs £7.99
per month) entitles you to watch Netflix
content on up to two devices at once,
while the Premium plan (£9.99 per
month) lets you stream to four different
screens simultaneously.
Irrespective of which plan you’re
signed up to, you can also add up to five
different profiles to every Netflix
account, which allows you and your
family to have your own personalised
TV recommendations and recently
watched lists. To add a profile, click the
account name in the top-right corner
and select Manage Profiles.
Note that all users must still log in
using the account holder’s credentials.
You can then select your own profile
after launching the Netfix app or site.
Share Spotify Premium
with five people
Spotify Premium for Family lets you
share Spotify Premium membership
between five friends and family
members, provided they all reside at
your address. Unlike some of the
services in this feature, Spotify lets
everyone keep their existing login
details, so you can keep your music
libraries and playlists totally separate.
At £14.99, it’s more expensive than a
normal Premium membership (£9.99),
but it’s still a lot cheaper than buying six
The cost of signing up to lots of different online services soon
mounts up. Edward Munn explains how to save time, money
and hassle by sharing your accounts with other people
separate subscriptions.
To set up a Family membership, visit
www.spotify.com/uk/family, then click
Get Started. Once you’ve set up Spotify
Premium for Family, you can manage
the other accounts at any time by
opening your Account page and
selecting ‘Premium for Family’. Clicking
an empty slot lets you invite someone
by emailing them or copying a link and,
if they’re already a Spotify Premium
subscriber, they will simply be moved to
the Spotify Premium for Family plan at
the end of their current billing period.
Stream Now TV shows
to four devices
Now TV lets you register up to four
devices at any time, but the catch is that
you can only watch on two
simultaneously. What’s more, once
you’ve registered
four devices, you
can only make
one change to
your devices list
every month. This
means that even
if you remove
more than one
device, you can
still only add one
new one each
calendar month.
To add a
device, just start
watching
something on it
by logging in with
the appropriate account credentials and
pressing Play. To remove a device, go to
‘Manage devices’ in the My Account
menu and clear it from there.

members using Google Play Family
Library. To set up Family Library, open
the Play Store app
on your mobile
device, then open
its main menu and
select Account.
Tap Family, then
‘Sign up for Family
Library’ and follow
the on-screen
instructions to set
up a family group.
Once you’ve
invited your family
members, they
also need to
follow the above
steps to set up
Family Library.
You can choose
to add purchases
to the family library automatically or
to add them manually after you’ve
bought them.
Use one calendar for all
the family
Coordinating each family member’s
plans so you know everyone’s comings
and goings can be a challenge, and
Google’s family calendar feature is here
to help. After you’ve set up a family
group (see previous tip), a calendar
called Family is created automatically.
Anyone in your family can see, create,
edit or delete events on the family
calendar. You
can’t add
non-family
members to the
calendar, but
you can still
invite them to
individual
events.
To share a calendar with a non-family
member, visit calendar.google.com on
your computer, then go to My Calendars
and click the down arrow next to the
calendar you want to share. Select
‘Share this Calendar’ and, under ‘Share
with specific people’, add the email
address of the person you want to share
with. You’ll then be able to select their
permissions.
Give your family access
to iTunes
Like Google Play’s Family Library (bit.ly/
family436), Apple lets you share apps,
books, music, movies and TV shows
bought from the App Store and iTunes
Store. To set up Family Sharing, go to
Settings on your iPhone or iPad and
tap your name, then tap Setup Family
Sharing and Get Started, and follow the
instructions on screen.
Note that by setting up purchase
sharing as the family organiser, you are
agreeing to pay for any iTunes and App
Store purchases that your family
members make. However, you’ll be
invited to set up ‘Ask to Buy’ for any
family members under the age of 18.
This means you’ll receive a notification
when a family member wants to buy
an app, and you can choose whether
to approve or deny the request.
Apple Family Sharing also lets you
share your iCloud storage and Apple
Music plan with up to five other family
members.
Account sharing isn’t limited to content you
stream or download. Google Photos recently
introduced a new feature that lets you
automatically share your photo library with
your partner so you no longer need to send
them photos you want them to see. The tool
lets you filter images by date or by the faces
that appear in them, so you don’t have to
share everything with your partner.
To set up library sharing, open the main
menu in Google Photos on your phone and
select ‘Share your library’. Tap ‘Get started’,
then follow the instructions on screen to
choose what you share. You’ll need to ask
your partner to do the same in order to
browse their photos in the app.

F
irefox has lost a lot of ground to
Chrome over the years, but it’s still
an excellent and very capable web
browser. Now, Mozilla has overhauled its
software with a faster engine – Firefox
Quantum – that makes use of multiple
processor cores and prioritises the tab
you’re currently using. The browser has
always been a bit of a resource hog, but
the latest release (also known as Firefox
57) uses around 30% less memory when
compared to the old version.
And that’s not all that’s changed. The
refined and rebuilt interface has square
tabs, smooth animations and a Library,
which provides quick access to saved
content such as bookmarks, browser
history, downloads, tabs and screenshots.
Try the new Firefox Quantum

Pocket is now a major part of Firefox.
When you visit a site or page that you
want to view later, just click the Pocket
button. 1 You’ll be able to add tags, 2
remove the page 3 or view your list of
saved pages. 4 Saved pages can also be
viewed via the Library. You can use
Pocket with or without an account.
1
Firefox Quantum’s new interface isn’t
hugely different from previous
versions of the browser, but the tabs 1
now have sharper edges, the page-reload
button has moved 2 and there are some
new buttons in the top-right corner. 3
‘Save to Pocket’ is now part of the
address bar. 4
2
The Library section is one of the main
new management tools and is home
to all your saved content. Click the
button 1 to access your bookmarks,
Pocket list (saved items), history,
downloads, synced tabs and screenshots.
2 Recent Highlights – sites you’ve visited
– appear below. 3

You can now take and save
screenshots directly in Firefox. Go to
a page you want to capture, right-click
and select ‘Take a Screenshot’ to open
the screenshot tool. You can save the full
page, 1 just the visible area 2 or select
part of the page by hovering over a web
element. 3

Protect all your devices
from the KRACK flaw
2
To check that you have received the update in Windows
10, open Settings (Windows+i) and select ‘Update &
security’, Windows Update, then ‘Update history’. If the
update has been installed, you should see a KB number
between 4041600 and 4042900 1 and an installation date
from early- to mid-October. 2
1
The good news for Windows users is that your PC should
already be patched and protected, as long as you’re using
Windows 7 or later and haven’t switched off automatic
updates. You can see a full list of the updates for various
versions of Windows by visiting bit.ly/sectc436 and scrolling
down to Affected Products. 1
3
Many PCs use Intel Wi-Fi hardware but, thankfully, Intel
has released a patch. To find out which hardware it covers,
visit bit.ly/ints436. Check which hardware your PC uses
by typing device manager into the Start menu. Open
‘Network adapters’, right-click the Wi-Fi adapter 1
and choose
Properties. Click the Driver tab 2 and update if necessary.
4
iOS has recently been updated to version 11.1, which fixes
KRACK on Apple’s mobile devices. To check you have it,
go to Settings, General, 1 Software Update. If your
device hasn’t updated yet, you’ll see the ‘Download and Install’
option. 2 Tap this to start the installation. You may need to
plug in your device.
A
s we reported in Issue 435 (bit.ly/webuser435),
researchers have discovered how to crack the WPA2
encryption that protects your Wi-Fi from snoopers.
The flaw, called Key Reinstallation Attack (KRACK) lets a
skilled hacker see anything you send over your connection.
Now that details have been confirmed, we have a better
idea of what’s affected and how we can protect ourselves.
If you can, you should update any devices that connect to the
internet, including computers and mobile devices. Routers
are also vulnerable and should be updated if possible. This
Workshop will guide you through your current options.
At the time of writing, some devices hadn’t been patched,
so keep an eye on the various manufacturers’ support pages.

Andy Shaw says
If you haven’t updated your devices,
you’re at greatest risk from KRACK
when using public Wi-Fi networks
because you can’t tell whether or
not they’ve been patched. In this
situation, you should proceed with
caution. Use a VPN if you can (see
our Workshop on hassle-free VPNs
in Issue 435) and connect to HTTPS
versions of websites when possible.

Macs will be fixed in MacOS Version 10.11.1. To find out
which version you have, click the Apple icon in the
top-left corner and choose About This Mac. Here you can
see which version of MacOS you’re using. 1 If you don’t yet
have 10.11.1 (which was still in beta at the time of writing), click
the Software Update button 2 to see if it’s available.

Some versions of Linux have been updated already,
including Ubuntu, Arch, OpenBSD and Debian. To
upgrade Ubuntu, for example, go to Settings and locate
the Update Manager. Click Check 1 to see the latest updates
and Install Updates 2 to download them.
7
Android poses more
of a problem. Google
issued a patch for
KRACK on 6 November and
the company’s own devices
should receive it soon after
that, but other manufacturers
will have to produce their
own updates. Android 6
devices are the most
vulnerable. When the patch
arrives, you’ll be able to
‘Download updates manually’
1 from ‘About device’ in
Settings. Until then, follow
the advice in our Expert Tip,
opposite.
8
Updating your router will solve the problem for any
device that connects to your home network. Although
most router manufacturers were aware of which devices
were affected at the time of writing, they hadn’t yet released
fixes. Keep up to date with the comprehensive list at CERT
(bit.ly/cert436). 1
10
If a firmware update is available for your router, you’ll
need to go into its settings, which usually means
typing its IP address into your web browser. Some
routers, such as the TP-Link model we’ve used here, will find,
download and update their firmware on demand. 1 Others
may require you to download the patch separately.
9
The CERT site links to any advisory information your
router manufacturer has announced. It’s also worth
searching for ‘krack’ on the company’s support website or
forum. You’ll probably find that most of the results are posts
from concerned customers on the forums 1 but these threads
should also link to any announcements from the manufacturer.

create scheduled and
encrypted backups,
and save them directly to
your Drive cloud storage.
FBackup: fbackup.com |

1
Open FBackup and click File, Options, ‘Online destinations’.
Click Google Drive, 1 then Add 2 and choose a name for
your configuration, such as ‘My Google Drive’. Then click
‘Choose account’ and follow the instructions to log into Drive.
Select a folder for your backups, then click OK twice.

and click Next. Select Google Drive from the Destination
menu. 1 In the next menu, select your configuration 2
and click Next. ‘Selection of files and folders’, which lets you
pick files and folders to protect, is highlighted by default.
3
Presets in the same menu let you back up specific
programs and file types. Click the drop-down menu to
select one. 1 To browse a wider selection of presets, click
Plugins. 2 Once you’ve chosen your backup source, you can
use the filters 3 for greater control over what’s protected.
4
When you select a filter, only files of that type will be
backed up, so if you want to back up files of every type,
simply leave all the boxes unticked. Note that there’s an
additional box you must tick if you want to back up empty
folders. 1 Click Next 2 when you’re happy with your selection.
5
On the next screen, choose ‘Make full’ 1 from the
drop-down menu if you want to create an archive of all
your files; or select ‘Make mirror’ to create an exact copy
without compressing the files. If you select the archive option,
you can click ‘Yes, use password protection’ 2 to encrypt it. 6
Click Next, then choose how often you want the tool
to create a new backup. 1 Finally, click Save, then
‘Save and run’ 2 and the backup will start. To restore
a backup, click the appropriate button for the backup on

1
Sign into Chrome using a Google account, then install
the add-on from bit.ly/chis436. 1 A clipboard icon will
appear next to the address bar. 2 You only need to
install it once, because it should install automatically on your
other computers when you next sign into Chrome on them. 2
Now, when you copy to your device’s clipboard, the
number on the Clipboard History icon 1 increases.
Click this for a full list of the items you have saved to
the clipboard, as well as details of how long they’ve been
there 2 and how many text characters they contain. 3
3
Items saved on your clipboard will only appear on your
other devices if you click the ‘Send to cloud’ button. 1
This uploads the information to Chrome’s cloud storage.
Within a couple of minutes, your saved clips will appear in
the lists on your other devices.
4
Click any item in the list to copy it back to your
clipboard so you can paste it into another document.
Copying a clip turns its time icon green and resets the
time to ‘a few seconds’ 1 to show when it was last used. You
can switch to any other application and paste it as normal.
5
To manage items on your list, use the tick boxes to
select them. 1 You can then add them to a ‘Favorite’
list, 2 export one or more items to a text file 3 or
remove them completely. 4 The icon buttons also let you add
to favourites, view the full text and delete clippings. 5
6
To configure the settings, click the Clipboard History
icon and choose Options. 1 Here, you can decide how
long items remain in your clipboard list 2 (the default
is to keep them forever), choose how to sort items and

Get to grips with some serious PC DIY to boost

58 15 - 28 November 2017
To begin, you just need to go to www
.wix.com, click the Start Now button and
create an account or sign in using your
Facebook or Google credentials. Wix will
ask you what kind of website you want to
create. Pick an option that best suits the
kind of topic you’re going to be covering.
If you don’t see anything suitable, select
How to...
Finally create that website
you’ve been putting off
Got a great idea for a website but no idea how to do it? Wayne
Williams shows you how, with Wix’s useful site-building tools
Get started with Wix
Wix is a brilliant online website builder
that provides two separate design tools:
Wix ADI (Artificial Design Intelligence),
which puts together a site based on your
answers to a handful of questions; and
Wix Editor, which lets you choose a
template and customise everything
to your requirements, picking and
choosing from thousands of advanced
design elements.
W
hen the web first took over the
world, there were just two ways
of building a site – using a
WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You
Get) editor or manually coding in HTML.
These days, there are many more options
available to would-be site owners,
including web-based creators such as
Weebly (www.weebly.com/uk) and Wix
(www.wix.com). These use a simple
drag-and-drop approach, so you can
concentrate on the actual content of
your site without having to worry
about coding or whether your site
will display properly in every
possible browser. These
services even host your
finished site free of charge
until you feel ready to buy
a domain name and take
on hosting duties yourself.
If you’ve been thinking of
creating your own website,
but weren’t sure how and
where to start, we’ll show
you just how easy it is to

Other. You can then choose which
method you want to use to create your
site. We’ll mostly focus on ADI in this
project because it provides the simplest
way to get started.
For help with your first few steps,
follow our Mini Workshop, below. If you’d
rather go straight to the Editor for
greater control over your site’s design,
follow our Mini Workshop on page 61.
Customise your site design
Once you have a basic website created
using ADI, you can get started with the
customisation tools. The Site Design
menu lets you pick a design theme from
a sidebar and select a colour scheme.
Pick a main colour and Wix will
recommend a palette of colours that
complement it, so you don’t end up with
a headache-inducing site of clashing
hues. You can switch between dark and
light modes, and there’s an advanced

Once you’ve signed into Wix and
selected the type of website you
want to create, you’ll be asked to pick
a method for creating your site. Select

website for (non-profit, school, author,
blogger and so on). Type something
and it will display some matches. 1

Select an option, then click Next.
You’ll be asked if you need a facility

and click Next again. Enter a name for
your site, then an optional address.
Check the details 1 and add a logo 2
if required. You can connect a social
network, too. 3

Click the Start button and select
one of the offered designs. Click
the ‘Create my Homepage’ button
and wait while the site is generated.

slide, fly, fold and turn. You can also
choose a scroll effect (parallax, reveal,
zoom in and fade in) and page transitions
(none, horizontal, vertical, cross fade and
out-in). Make whatever changes you like
and click the Preview button at the top
to see the results.
You can also change the design of
each site section. If you’re not happy
with the site header, for example, clicking
the Designs button will let you pick a
different one from the options. You can
then change the colour, text settings
and animation for that section.
To edit the content, pick a section to
change and replace (or remove) the title,
subtitle and description. You can also
swap or edit any images, galleries and
videos, as well as any buttons and links.
As your site grows, you can add new
sections to a page, or new pages, by
selecting the relevant option, then
clicking and dragging.

Publish your site and improve
its ranking
When you’re happy with how your
customised ADI site looks and have
added all your content, you can publish
it to the web, ready for the hordes of
visitors who will be clamouring to view it.
To do this, just click the Publish button
top right. You can use a free Wix.com
domain (which will include your name,
and ‘wixsite.com’, as well as any
customisable addition), or connect your
own domain, if you already have one.
Click ‘Publish & Continue’ to view the
site in your web browser, then go back
and make any changes you require.
In order to attract visitors to your site,
you’ll need to promote it. You can do this
through word of mouth, and by using
social sites such as Facebook and Twitter.
Wix also offers help with getting your
site noticed. In the Pages sidebar, click
the Settings cog and select Page SEO
in the pop-up menu. SEO – which stands
for Search Engine Optimisation – helps
people find your site on Google, Bing
and other search engines.
Give your page a description
(explaining what makes it unique) and
add some keywords that relate to the
content. Google uses these keywords to
build a picture of your site. If you don’t
want a particular page to appear in
search results, you can hide it.
Wix has a ‘Get Found on Google’ plan
that you can use to improve your SEO.
You have to enter some tags, optionally
have Wix analyse them and suggest
some alternatives, then go to your plan
and see what you need to add or change
to potentially get ranked higher.
Once your site has been up and
running for a while, you can use Wix’s
Manage section to view Insights into
your traffic, including how many visitors
you’ve had and where they’re visiting
from.
The Manage
section lets
you promote

View animated GIFs
If you find an animated GIF on the web
that you want to keep, you can save it to
your hard drive by right-clicking it and
using the ‘Save image as’ menu option
– just as you would with a regular static
image. However, many image viewers
aren’t able to display the animated
version, so if you want to see the GIF
in all its glory, you should reopen it in
your browser. Drag it from the folder
you saved it to and drop it on the
browser window or address box.
Hold down the Ctrl key and spin the
mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
Watch movies
You can’t download movies from Netflix
and many other streaming services,
but if a video on a web page can be
right-clicked and saved to your hard
drive, it can be watched later offline
using your browser. This should also
work for videos attached to an email
or shared using an online service.
When you’re ready to watch the
video, simply drag it from an Explorer
window and drop it on the browser
window or address box.
Not all video file formats are
supported by all browsers, but
Chrome covers the widest range
so it’s usually the best option. If the
video is in a compatible file format,
it will begin playing immediately;
C
hrome doesn’t just display websites, it also
runs apps, and these often have as many tools
and options as paid-for Windows programs.
While most apps are for online use, it’s worth
remembering that some of them also work offline,
so you can install them in Chrome and use them even
when you aren’t connected to the internet.
To find offline apps, go to chrome://apps and click
Web Store. Select either Apps or Games on the left
and look further down the menu. Under Features,
tick the box for Runs Offline. Your results will be
filtered to show all the items that can be run offline.
You can also check whether an app will run offline
from its description. Click an app and, in its
information column on the right, look for the lightning
bolt and the words Runs Offline. Clicking this will take
you back to all the other apps that run offline.
When you’ve found an app you want to use, click
‘Add to Chrome’ to install it. You’ll find your apps
in chrome://apps, where you can also run them.
Install offline apps
Read PDF files offline
You don’t have to install a standalone
tool to view PDFs; you can use your
browser instead, even when you’re
offline. Double-clicking on a saved
PDF in Windows 10 automatically opens
it in the Edge browser, which received
some extra tools for handling PDFs
in the Fall Creators Update, including
the ability to fill out forms and make
annotations. You can also open PDFs
in Chrome, by dragging and dropping
a file from an Explorer window.
Press Ctrl+F to search the text.
To see a list of Chrome apps and games that run offline, tick the box
in the Features section
Use your browser to watch videos saved
to your hard drive
Drag a PDF file to Chrome to read it in the

If you see words that look like
they’ve been typed in a
typewriter, follow the instructions
and type them exactly as they
appear, paying close attention to
spaces and punctuation.

any video that is in an incompatible
file format will be saved to the
Downloads folder, even if it’s already
saved elsewhere.
The ‘.mp4’ file format most commonly
used by phones will play fine in Chrome
and Firefox, but not in Edge.
Listen to music
It’s a similar story with music files:
Chrome and Firefox can play audio
files dragged from Explorer and
dropped on the browser window,
but Edge can’t. Common audio file
formats that are often found on the
web can be played offline, such as MP3
and M4A, but not all audio formats play.
Any file format that can’t be read will be
saved again, even if it’s already stored
on the hard drive.
Read ebooks out loud
Ebooks in EPUB file format can be read
if you have Edge in Windows 10, even if
your PC is offline. Just double-click the
file in an Explorer window and the file
will open in Edge, which is set as the
default book reader. If the browser
window is large enough, it displays two
pages side by side, just like a real book.
Edge is a fully fledged ebook reader
and comes with all the usual features:
click your mouse anywhere to display
a toolbar at the top and a progress bar
at the bottom. You can drag the slider
to jump to a new part of the book or use
the mouse’s scroll wheel to flip pages,
and you can click the button in the
top-left corner to open the ebook
contents and jump to any chapter or
section. The buttons in the top-right
corner of the toolbar let you select the
font style, text size, spacing and more.
To hear the ebook read out loud, click
the book/speaker icon in the toolbar.
If you want to change the speed at
which the text is read or the voice that
Edge is using, pause the reading and
click the person icon to make your
adjustments.
Using Edge as an ebook reader is
particularly useful on hybrid laptops,
which have screens that fold flat or can
be detached and used like a tablet.
and if Google Drive is set up for
offline use, you can carry on working.
Offline mode lets you open and edit
documents even when there’s no
internet connection, because it stores
a copy of your files on the hard drive.
Any changes you make are
automatically synced the next time
you go online.
To set up Google Drive and Google
Docs for offline use, go to Google
Docs Offline on the Chrome Web
Store (bit.ly/docsol436) and install
the extension in Chrome. Now, go to
Google Drive (drive.google.com) and
click the cog icon in the top-right
corner. Select Settings from the menu
and tick the box next to Offline.
Install Google Backup and Sync
to keep a folder on your hard drive
that’s synced with Google Drive
online, so you can access your other
files offline. Go to drive.google
.com, click the gear icon and
select ‘Download Backup and
Sync for Windows’.
Save websites for
reading offline
Go to getpocket.com and sign
up for a free account. In
Chrome, install the Pocket app
from the Chrome Web Store
(bit.ly/pock436), then go to
chrome://apps, run the Pocket app
and sign into your Pocket account.
Return to the Chrome Web Store
and install the Save to Pocket add-on
(bit.ly/savep436). This adds a button
to the Chrome toolbar.
When you’re browsing the web and
want to save a page to read later, click
the ‘Save to Pocket’ button in the
Chrome toolbar. To read your saved
web pages, go to chrome://apps and
click the Pocket icon. It opens a new
window in which you can browse your
saved pages and open them to read,
even if your computer is offline.
Use Gmail offline
If you’re often without
an internet
connection, you can
set up Gmail
for offline use –
as long as you use
Chrome. Go to Gmail
Offline in the Chrome
Web Store (bit.ly/
gmol436) and click
the Visit Website
button. A page opens where you
can enable or disable offline mail.
When you are connected to the
internet, just visit mail.google.com
to access your email in the normal
way. However, when you’re offline,
go to chrome://apps and click the
Gmail icon. In offline mode, you can
see and read all the emails you’ve
received over the last seven days.
Any new messages that are created
are sent the next time you’re online
and using Chrome.
If the last seven days of email isn’t
sufficient, go to chrome://apps and
click Gmail. Click the gear icon in the
top-right corner and select Week,
2 Weeks or Month next to ‘Download
mail from past’. Click Apply. Normally,
file attachments in emails can be up
to 25MB but when you are offline
there is a 5MB maximum.
Use Google Docs offline
Google’s online office suite of Docs,
Sheets and Slides lets you create
documents, spreadsheets and slide
shows. However, if you lose your
internet connection, Chrome freezes
your work and waits until the internet
connection is restored. This is clearly
less preferable to using Microsoft
Office on your PC, which never needs
an internet connection.

Fix PC after CD drive upgrade
Q
I was surprised to find that my new
Mesh PC (www.meshcomputers
.com) came without a CD drive, so
I removed the blanking plate and fitted
an HP CD drive I had. The power cables
wouldn’t fit the drive, so I used the
cables from an older PC. Now when
I switch on, nothing appears on screen.
It says Asus and then “No signal”. Could
it be the cables? The cooling fans on the
removable side aren’t working either.
Gerald Stephenson, via email
A
CD and DVD drives are becoming
obsolete now that so many people
download software, listen to music on
Spotify and stream movies from Netflix
and other services. The easiest way to
add a CD or DVD drive is to buy a USB
model. Prices start at around £20, and
you just plug them into a USB socket.
If your computer isn’t working with
the CD drive installed, you should
remove the drive and any cables you
added. If this fixes the problem, there is
a compatibility issue with the CD drive
or cables. It may be that the power
supply is at its limit, and adding an extra
component is too much for it. Make sure
the cables are the right way round, too.
If you can’t get it to work, the external
USB option is probably the cheapest
and easiest solution.

Use software DVD alternative
Q
I have a Dell laptop with Windows 7
and a DVD-RW drive, and I’ve just
bought a new Dell PC that doesn’t have
a DVD drive. How do I install a program
from a disc on my new Dell?
Geoff Wheeler, via email
A
As we pointed out to Gerald
Stephenson, above, the simplest
solution is to buy a USB DVD/CD-writer.
However, if you don’t want to spend any
money, you could try a software option.
Download InfraRecorder
(infrarecorder.org) and use it to copy
the software disc to the hard drive of
your Windows 7 laptop (which has a
DVD drive). To do this, select Actions,
Copy Disc and Disc Image. Then transfer
the resulting ISO file to the new
computer – you can use a USB memory
stick, transfer it over your network or
Zip it and sync it with OneDrive,
Dropbox or Google Drive.
On the new computer, download and
install Microsoft’s Virtual CD-Rom
Control Panel (bit.ly/msvcd436). This
lets you mount an ISO file as a virtual
CD/DVD drive on Windows XP, Vista
and 7 (Windows 10 doesn’t need it).
The Virtual CD/DVD drive works just
like a real one, so open it in Explorer
and run the software.
SOFTWARE
Enhance images in PDFs
Q
I do volunteer transcription work for
a family history society, which scans
old documents and fiches and makes
PDFs of them. Volunteers then transfer
the text of the PDFs into a spreadsheet.
Some of our elderly volunteers are
having difficulty reading the PDFs
because the original documents are faint
or use old typewriter fonts. It would be
nice if we could enhance the text in the
PDF to make it darker or convert the
image to a negative, such as white text
on a black background. Is there any PDF
software that will do this?
Keith Griffiths, via email
A
The best time to make your
documents easier to read is while
scanning, because scanner software
offers a choice of resolutions, colour
settings, filters and so on. Once you’ve
created a PDF, there’s no simple way to
edit the images. If money is no object,
using Adobe Acrobat and Photoshop
may help, but even that would probably
require time-consuming work and
technical knowledge.
Q
Google Drive has been telling me
that I’m using an old version and
need to update. How do I do this?
Should I back up all the music and
documents stored there to a memory
stick first? Drive’s site doesn’t make it
clear whether I have to uninstall the
software and download afresh.
Carole, via email
A
Yes, you should definitely back up
everything on Google Drive. It’s
unlikely that anything will go wrong
during the upgrade, but a backup
insures you against problems, and
you’ll kick yourself if you don’t do it
and then something goes wrong.
When you download and install the
new software, it automatically
replaces Google Drive with the new
‘Backup and Sync’ tool, which keeps
all your old settings and files. When it
starts, it asks you if you want to back
up extra Windows folders, such as the
Desktop, Documents and Pictures
folders. These may use a lot of space,
so deselect them if you don’t have
enough online storage space.

There are a couple of other possible
solutions, but we can’t guarantee they’ll

It analyses the image and turns it into an
editable text document. You can then
select text by dragging over it with the
mouse, press Ctrl+C to copy it, switch to
another application and press Ctrl+V to
paste it in. That’s fine in theory, but its
success depends on the scan’s quality.
Another option is to export PDFs as
JPEG images and load them into a
photo editor, such as Paint.Net (www
.getpaint.net). You can then make them
black and white, sharpen them and so
on. To save a PDF as JPEG images, go to

How do I get rid of potentially
unwanted programs (PUPs), and
how do I avoid them in the first place?
Monte Byrne, via email
A
PUPs aren’t usually malicious,
so security software often ignores
them, but they are annoying and can
be hard to remove. A good way to
avoid downloading PUPs is to get the
software directly from the developer’s
website rather than a download site,
and to avoid pirated software.
The free version of Malwarebytes
Anti-Malware (www.malwarebytes

many antivirus programs. To clean

WaitToKillServiceTimeout and increase
the number. If it’s 5000 (five seconds)

create them.
Double-click HungAppTimeout and
set the value to 8000 or 10000, which

WaitToKillAppTimeout and set the value

Hide addictive apps with
Microsoft Launcher
One of my favourite features of Microsoft
Launcher (Gold Award winner in Issue
435’s round-up of Android Launchers;
bit.ly/webuser435) is the option to hide
apps. I’ve long been
aware that I waste too
much time on apps
such as Facebook and
Instagram, but if I
delete them altogether,
I’ve always ended up
reinstalling them.
To wean myself off
them, my first step was
to simply remove the
apps from my home
screen and put them
slightly out of reach in
the app drawer. Now
that I’ve installed
Microsoft Launcher,
I’ve gone one step further and hidden
them completely, making them even
harder to find and open!
To hide an app, open the Launcher’s
Settings menu, then tap Customisation
and ‘Hidden apps’. Tap ‘Hide apps’ and
tick the apps you don’t want to be visible
in the app drawer. Once that’s done, you
can only open these apps by navigating
to the ‘Hidden apps’ menu, as described.
As well as taking away the temptation
to use time-wasting apps, it’s a handy
feature if you don’t want someone to see
an app you have installed!

Turn off Windows Update
in Windows 10
Automatic updates are switched on
by default in Windows 10. This is great
because it means your PC always has the
latest and best features, but some users
might not want automatic updates
because it can hog system and network
resources at critical moments.
In Windows 8.1 and before, Microsoft
allowed users to turn off auto updates
completely. Unfortunately, there’s no
such option in Windows 10, but I have a
workaround. Search for services.msc
in Cortana/Search box and open it. Find
Windows Update in the Services list, then
double-click it. In the Windows Update

TOP TIP
If your PC has
4GB of memory
or less, it’s easy
to run out.
Having just 10
tabs open in
Chrome will
sometimes max
out the memory
on my PC and
slow it to a halt.
There’s a
hidden setting
in Chrome that can solve this problem.
Type chrome://flags in the address
bar and look for a setting called
‘Automatic tab discarding’. On most
PCs, it’s set to Default – but it doesn’t
say what the default is! Click it and set
it to Enabled, then click the Relaunch
Now button that appears.
If your PC’s available memory gets

BROWSERS
low, this setting frees up some by
discarding any web pages on tabs
you’re not using. You don’t lose the tab
or the web page – you can just click
the tab to reload the page so you can
continue browsing.
I have found this is a great help
when I have lots of Chrome tabs open.

Organise your Google tools
When you visit the Google homepage
or any other Google site, you’ll see a grid
icon displayed in the top-right corner.
Clicking it shows icons for Calendar,
Drive, Gmail and so on, but did you know
that you can rearrange their order and
put your favourite ones at the top?
Just click and drag the icons to move
them around and they make space for
you to drop them wherever you want.
Click the More link at the bottom
to see further Google services and their
icons. I use Google Keep a lot and found
it hidden below the More section. I have
now dragged the icon up to the first row
where I can open it in one click. The
changes are saved and work on every
Google site as long as you’re logged in.

APPS
Record your walks easily
After seeing last issue’s tip about the
BBC iPlayer Radio widgets, I thought I’d
investigate which of my other apps have
useful widgets. The best I discovered was
the widget for Strava (bit.ly/strava436).
I’ve used the app to track my hikes and
bike rides since it was recommended in
Web User last year, but one gripe I had
with it was that it’s quite fiddly to start
recording an activity and even more so
to pause it. The Strava widget puts a
‘Start recording’ button on your home
screen; when you tap it, the appropriate
page in the app opens instantly. Tap Start
to begin recording and you can then stop
and resume the activity from the widget,
and tap Finish when you’re done.
When an activity is not in progress, the
widget also displays your total mileage
for the week including
bar charts for the days
of the week. I find this
really useful because
knowing how far I’ve
walked is the reason
I use it in the first place!

Turn off the iPad
sidebar
For months, whenever
I’d swipe from right to left
on my iPad Air, I would
accidentally enable a
sidebar displaying Twitter.
After doing some research,
I discovered this Slide Over
feature is intended for
multitasking because you can use it to
display a range of different apps while
continuing to use whatever other app
you have open on the rest of the screen.
If you didn’t realise this was its
intended purpose, swipe in from the
right-hand side of your screen, then
swipe down from the top of the sidebar
to pick from a range of apps including
Messages and Mail. If you have an iPad
Air 2 or newer, you can swipe the edge
of the sidebar to expand it to a 50/50
split screen.
If you don’t want to use Slide Over
or Split Screen, you can disable these
features altogether by opening Settings
and tapping General, then Multitasking.
Next, switch ‘Allow multiple apps’ to off.
You’ll no longer be irritated by unwanted
sidebars appearing when you swipe.

Stop Twitter keeping you
awake
Did you know that you can stop Twitter
from straining your eyes by enabling
its dark-themed night mode? To enable
it from your browser, click your profile
picture to open the site’s main menu and
select ‘Night mode’. Doing the same
again disables the feature.
In the Twitter app for Android (bit.ly/
twitter436), you can enable automatic
night mode by tapping your profile
picture, then ‘Settings and privacy’.
Under General, select ‘Display and sound’
and tap ‘Night mode’ and ‘Automatic at
sunset’. The app might ask for permission
to access your location.
If you prefer to toggle it manually, you
can just tap the moon icon in the bottom-
left corner of the app’s main menu. The
latter works in the iOS app, too.

Why is my iPhone sending
iMessages to Android?
Q
When I send a message from my
iPhone to a friend who has an
Android phone, the message appears in
blue, showing that it was sent as an
iMessage. However, you can’t get
iMessages on an Android phone, so he
never receives them. In fact, before I’ve
even started typing the text, the box at
the bottom where you type your
message has ‘iMessage’ written in it. For
all my other Android contacts, the box
says ‘Text Message’ as expected. Can
anyone explain why my iPhone is being
tricked into thinking it’s sending
messages to another iOS device?
vista, Web User Forums
A
Is it possible that the recipient has
used an iPhone in the past? If so,
your iPhone may still recognise the
phone number as belonging to an
iPhone, even though it no longer does.
To stop this, the recipient needs to put
their SIM card back in their old iPhone,
tap Settings, Messages, then turn off
iMessage. Next, they should open
FaceTime from Settings and turn this off,
too. If they don’t
have the iPhone
any more, they
can deregister
iMessage using
the form
at bit.ly/
deregister436.
It’s important
that they follow
these steps,
otherwise they
might fail to
receive
messages from
anyone who tries
to contact them
using an iPhone.
If you’re ever
struggling to
send an
iMessage (maybe the recipient is abroad
and has mobile data turned off), did you
know you can opt to send it as a normal
text message by long-pressing it and
selecting ‘Send as Text Message’?

Online delivery keeps
passing me by
Over the past two months, I’ve ordered
two items online and the experience has
both frustrated and infuriated me. The
companies and the products were ﬁne,
but they were sadly let down by the
courier, which in both cases was Hermes.
Both transactions suffered exactly the
same problem: the packages were sent
halfway around the country before
arriving at my address.
The ﬁrst, a purchase from eBay,
promised delivery by Saturday 21
October. But the tracking
showed it travelling from
London, past
Bedfordshire
(where I
live) to end
up in Rugby,
Warwickshire.
As if that wasn’t enough,
by Monday they decided
to send the package on
holiday to Plymouth for
a few days before ﬁnally
arriving here this
afternoon.
My previous
experience was even
worse – the package was sent to
Nottingham, then Bristol before arriving
two weeks late.
When I complained to Hermes, I got
a standard letter explaining that they
deal with thousands of packages and
occasionally the odd one (always the one
addressed to me!) goes astray. The irony
is that this afternoon I received an email
asking for my feedback on how they
handled my complaint. I couldn’t wait to
click the link but – guess what? The link
was dead! I think that says it all.

Make your emoji quiz easier
I think your ‘Take a Screen Break’ emoji
quiz is getting too hard. I doubt that
anyone is guessing all the right answers
and winning the coveted Web User mug.
With this in mind, here are my say-what-
you-see guesses for the horror-ﬁlm emoji
I
am pleased that mobile-phone
companies are finally being exposed
for ripping off their customers over
the cost of handsets (Need to Know,
Issue 435). When you sign up for a
two-year contract that charges you
£50-odd quid a month, you’re
effectively paying around £1,200 in
total (£50 x 24 months). Yes, I realise
that includes calls, text and data,
but it’s still a lot of money.
The least the mobile networks can
do when the two years is up and
you’ve paid for the phone is to lower
your monthly payment to the
appropriate amount. But it seems that
instead they go on charging you the
same sum for as long as they can get
away with it. Either that or they try to
convince you that you need to
upgrade the handset you’ve just
Mobile networks must stop ripping us off
ﬁnished paying for to whatever the latest
iPhone, Samsung or top-of-the range
model is, so they can keep on ripping
you off indeﬁnitely.
I’ve had the same HTC phone for the
last ﬁve years and it still works
perfectly well. As soon as I reached
the end of my two-year contract with
Vodafone, I moved to a cheaper
SIM-only deal with Three and put the
new SIM card in the old phone. I’ve
paid for it, after all, which means I can
do what I like with it.
Mobile companies have a duty to be
fair to their customers rather than
deliberately overcharging them
beyond the end of their ﬁxed deals.
This is especially true for older people
who may not realise that once their
contract is up, they don’t have to keep
paying the same amount – or even
stick with the same company. You’re
free to sell the phone once you’ve paid
for it, although you probably won’t get
much for an old model.

Tech is no excuse for
bad manners
What a patronising Star Email in Issue
435 from Humbert, San Antonio (‘Get
with the 21st century, grandpa!’). It’s true
that the youngsters of today are
obsessed with and constantly glued to
their mobile phones, but that doesn’t
mean we shouldn’t expect them to put
their devices down once in a while.
This is especially true at mealtimes,
when ﬁddling with a phone instead
of concentrating on your food is
downright rude.
Rather than mocking ‘grandpa’ for not
being ‘down with the kids’ perhaps
Humbert should acknowledge that the
ubiquity of modern technology does not
preclude the need for basic manners!
Despite Humbert’s assertion, I’m sure
that plenty of children still enjoy talking
to their grandparents, and know that
ignoring people around you in favour of
your phone is simply unacceptable.

Short-sightedness can be
genetic
As someone who has been short-sighted
for as long as they can remember, and
whose parents are also short-sighted,
I take issue with Terry Sims’ comments
in Issue 435 about the causes of myopia.
In fact, I suspect that his claims are
factually incorrect.
I have read several scientiﬁc reports
that link more than two dozen genes to
an increased risk of children developing
myopia, and short-sightedness has long
been observed – if you’ll pardon the pun
– to run in families. As for saying that
“the condition can be reversed”, well I
wish someone had told my opticians that
information because I could have saved
a fortune on spectacles over the years!
However, where I partly agree with Mr
Sims is that children today don’t do their
eyesight any favours by staring close-up
at computer and mobile-phone screens
all day long. I don’t believe that straining
their eyes in this manner is the sole
cause of myopia, but I imagine that it
exacerbates existing conditions and
could potentially lead to serious vision
problems in later life.

Crafty crypto-mining
should be illegal
I was interested and
slightly horriﬁed to read
not one but two items
in your latest issue
about websites using
the processing power
of their visitors’ PCs to
mine for Bitcoin and
other cryptocurrency.
Surely this devious
practice is completely illegal?
If not, then it certainly should be. How
can it be allowed for websites to
deliberately slow down your computer
so they can surreptitiously use your
system to make money for themselves?
I’m pleased that you recommended
tools that can prevent this from
happening, but as with malware, adverts
and so on, I imagine that no sooner do
you block one set of known culprits than
another springs up. I certainly don’t want
my PC being exploited for somebody
else’s gain so I will be installing the
strongest protection possible to stop this
crafty and unauthorised ‘crypto-mining’.

Facebook is what
you make it
Gold Master makes some good points
about Facebook (Inbox, Issue 434).
If people don’t like the annoyances and
autoplaying videos, then they’re not
forced to use it. He is also correct that
there is a certain degree of peer pressure
these days that obliges one to be ‘on
Facebook’.
Personally,
I ﬁnd
Facebook
useful
because
I make
sure
I am in
total
control of
what I see
and do on it.
I don’t like being
pestered with
adverts, so I use an ad blocker. I don’t
like my personal life being made public,
so I have my privacy settings tightened
to the max, to prevent intrusion. And I
don’t like having to wade through the
minutiae of people’s everyday lives,
especially when I barely know
them, so I am only
Facebook friends with
real-world friends and
family members.
If I get bored of
seeing a particular

to be invited to play

then I adjust my news

Do you agree? Let us know at webuser@dennis.co.uk
flatly refused to pay the ransom –
not least because you can still get most
of the main channels in HD without
plumping Murdoch’s cushions.
Sky doesn’t like to tell you this,
and you’ll certainly struggle to find the
information anywhere on its website,
but it’s obliged
to deliver the
HD channels
for the BBC,
ITV, Channel 4
and 5, even if
you don’t pay
for HD. It’s
only Sky’s own channels and the rest of
the 654 makeweights that aren’t
available if you don’t fork out for HD.
Somehow, we’ve managed to muddle
by without high-definition pictures from
Psychic Today and QVC.
Still, Sky finds bizarre and novel ways
to punish us for not paying the HD tax.
Barry Collins refuses to pay Sky’s HD tax
and predicts the company’s collapse
Page 404
Take, for example, the on-demand
services. If I set my Sky+ to record
Channel 4’s Grand Designs in HD this
evening, I can keep that recording on
my box in perpetuity, until the box dies
or I cease to be a Sky customer. If I try
to download the same show from the
Channel 4 catchup
service on Sky – the
exact same digital
bits and bytes that
are broadcast to the
satellite dish – I can’t
watch it in HD and
the download is
automatically deleted from my box
28 days later. It’s beyond irrational.
To be fair to Sky, some (but only
some) of this is due to regulatory
restrictions placed on on-demand
services such as the iPlayer to prevent
them from harming commercial rivals.
Nevertheless, it’s an inordinately stupid
way to treat customers who (like me)
pay £22.50 per month – and I’m on one
of the cheapest packages available.
Now, compare that to Netflix or
Amazon, both of which cost much less
than a tenner a month. All the shows are
in HD (unless the original series was only
recorded in standard definition), with
many in Ultra HD if you pay £10 a month
on Netflix – less than half of what Sky
charges me for fuzzy vision.
The Netflix app is available on as
many devices as I want it to be, and two
of us in the home can watch different
shows on Netflix at the same time. Sky,
on the other hand, limits your household
to only three devices and you can only
change one device per month, just to be
extra awkward.
Sky’s day is coming. It’ll collapse faster
than a deckchair in a hurricane once
someone steals its football rights. And I
won’t be sending flowers to the funeral.
Somehow, we’ve managed
to muddle by without
high-definition pictures from
Psychic Today and QVC
A
t some point in the next ﬁve
to 10 years, Sky is going to
the wall. I promise you. Netﬂix,
Amazon, Facebook or
a combination of the three is going
to snatch Sky’s sports rights and the
company will be ﬁnished – its boxes
sitting redundant under our TVs like
old branches of Woolworth’s on the
high street.
When it does capitulate, we’ll look
back at this era of TV and wonder how
the hell Sky got away with it for so long.
Because when you examine what we’re
being asked to pay – twenty, thirty,
forty quid or more for each month –
it’s ridiculous. Genuinely insane.
Sky might be flogging the life out of
Ultra HD right now, but in our household
we’re still leading the rebellion against
bog-standard HD. Sky has the front to
charge you £10 extra if you want to
access HD channels, and I’ve always
