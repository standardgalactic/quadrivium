Preface
Preface
In many respects Applied Mathematics by Example is an ideal text book. It combines a
light-hearted approach, well-rounded explanations and plenty of practice opportunities. It
makes an ideal companion for those students who are commencing a course in mechanics,
either at school or for undergraduate courses in Maths, Engineering or Physics.
From the outset of his teaching career Jeremy Pickles felt that available material was
far too dry and dull. His aim was to enliven the study of mechanics through interesting
or even humorous examples together with full explanations of where the various prin-
ciples and formulæ came from. He had the view that this book would serve as both
an introduction to mechanics and an introduction to the historical development of the
subject.
He begins his story with reference to the experiments of Galileo and the origin of the
constant acceleration formulæ. Likewise each main principle is described in the historical
context of its origin. Most of the mechanics required for an introductory course, such
as that found in A-level maths, deals with discoveries and models put together in the
17th century by Galileo and Isaac Newton. By treating the subject in this way, through
asking the same questions that these great scientists did, the reader is able to absorb the
essential cause of the mathematics. The eﬀect of this is to give weight and substance to
the principles of mechanics. Just as when dealing with projectiles we seek to discover
why the path of a cannon ball is a parabola (literally, para – near to, bola – a throw)
so we should also seek to determine the cause of the very question and answer. Jeremy
addresses these issues with alacrity.
He also had a deﬁnite end-target in mind when he put this material together. He asked
himself the questions of: How was it proved that the moon stays in orbit around the
earth? Why does it not fall down? What keeps it at a constant distance away from us?
Who was ﬁrst able to prove this? Through the text we are introduced to Newton’s way
of thinking – that there is a single system of law governing weights and orbits. Jeremy
knew that by answering such questions the reader would be able to master most of the
mechanics required in the M1 and M2 modules for A-level mathematics. Furthermore,
the text provides a useful introduction to mechanics for undergraduates.
Mechanics itself is an endearing and very useful educational tool. It teaches the student to
understand physical laws that are expressed in mathematical terms and to apply those
principles in unfamiliar situations.
It teaches how to work logically and provides an
excellent training in problem-solving. By these means mathematics itself is shown as an
essential tool for engineering and science. Jeremy’s book does justice to the real nature
of the subject.

Preface
During the last ten years of his life Jeremy worked as a part-time A level teacher in
the department of which I was head. He was an excellent teacher at this level and was
devoted to helping the students under his care. This book is written from experience of
teaching mechanics, which in itself is an extremely useful background at a time when so
many text books are put together by authors solely employed by publishing houses.
I sincerely hope that students of introductory mechanics will ﬁnd this book a useful
companion.

Introduction by the Author
Introduction by the Author
Mathematics is an exceptionally useful subject. In our technological society, it has ap-
plications in business, in computing, in engineering, in medicine and in many other
disciplines too. Of all academic qualiﬁcations, A-level mathematics is the one reported
to correlate most closely with an individual’s level of income. These factors naturally
add to the attractions of the subject, but there are also disadvantages.
A student who learns at school about the history of the Roman Empire or the novels of
Jane Austen is not concerned about what use this knowledge will be in later life. Nor are
their teachers or the exam boards who set the syllabus. The student will no doubt learn
some skills, how to weigh evidence or how to present an argument, but the main aim is
the broadening of horizons, the reﬁnement of judgement and the enjoyment of the study
in the here and now. By comparison, the syllabus for mathematics is more constrained by
the need to master the methods and skills necessary for future applications and further
study in more advanced courses.
This book approaches mathematics from the wider perspective enjoyed by less obviously
practical studies. A particular aim is to make accessible to students Newton’s vision of
a single system of law governing the falling of an apple in the orchard and the orbital
motion of the moon. With recent changes in the syllabus, this, the example par ex-
cellence perhaps of the modern scientiﬁc method, is available only to specialist ‘Further
Mathematicians’ (less than 1% of the student population). Both Newton and the student
population deserve better.
En route to gravitation, we address similar topics to those covered in an A-level syllabus in
mechanics, but there is more concern with the history of the subject and the development
of ideas. So far as is possible, the ideas are introduced with the vivid arguments and
illustrations used by Newton, Archimedes and Galileo in their writings. While there is
no avoiding the need for calculation, the surprise is how far we can get with how little
seriously technical work.
A famous mathematician once said that the complete appreciation of mathematics re-
quires an element of poetry, and it is true that mathematics can oﬀer the same sort of
inspiration. The poet sees the essence behind the daily experience, the universe in a
grain of sand, and the mathematician sees the law working behind the parachute and
the pendulum, the suspension bridge and the rolling motion of a wheel. To see the two
together, the principle and the particular application, is very beautiful and enormously
satisfying to the student.

Introduction by the Author
The aim, then, is to oﬀer in each of the diﬀerent areas covered half a dozen or a dozen
examples where the seam of mathematical principle rises close to the surface of everyday
experience. Some topics belonging strictly to a more advanced level of study, such as
oblique collisions, or the envelope of a trajectory, are included because of their familiarity
to anyone who uses a garden hose or watches snooker on TV. They are, however, not
an integral part of the development and readers may simply browse these or skip them
altogether as they wish. Conversely, less attention is paid to formal vector methods.
These are introduced in an appendix and used in the main text only to support Newton’s
intuitive demonstration of the “ v2/r ” centripetal acceleration formula. Elsewhere, we
stick with the common-sense arguments with which Newton and Galileo ﬁrst explored the
study of forces and velocities. One of the unsung attractions of mechanics as a subject is
that it asks for very little book-learning. The same few formulæ apply over and over again
in diﬀerent contexts. Practice and experience, more than formal instruction, develop the
art of knowing which formula to use when. To help broaden the base of experience, a
range of exercises is provided and supplemented with hints, answers, or worked solutions.
Every eﬀort has been made to select problems which not only provide the necessary hours
of practice but also oﬀer some feature of interest in their own right, whether in relation
to the history of the subject, the context of the application, or the occasional touch of
humour. Some harder ‘challenge’ problems are also included.
Students who go beyond the level of this book will eventually ﬁnd that the marvellous
system we are studying, powerful as it is, does not answer all the questions we can ask
about the universe. The detailed analysis of planetary orbits, which provided such a
convincing demonstration of the Newtonian framework, shows that at extreme levels of
accuracy ﬁne adjustments are needed to allow for Einstein’s theory of relativity. And,
looking back, we may have also lost something of the mediæval outlook, the sense of a
prevailing order which holds everything together. But still we have here a glimpse of how
lucidly and how beautifully mathematics can bring together diﬀerent practical, worldly
measures into a uniﬁed system of law.

About the Author
About the Author
Jeremy Pickles was born in 1946 in Hampstead. He attended Tonbridge School in Kent
and was awarded a scholarship to St John’s College, Cambridge when he was 16. He spent
seven years there, gaining a BA and masters, followed by a PhD in Theoretical Physics
with a thesis titled ‘Many-body Theory and the Landau Theory of Fermi Liquids’ under
the guidance of Brian Josephson (later a Nobel Laureate). He was also a Cambridge Blue
in athletics, specialising in the 880 yards.
After leaving Cambridge he became a Re-
search Oﬃcer at the Central Electricity
Research Laboratories for 20 years, with
some success; in 1977 he won a prize for
a paper on the calculation of electric ﬁelds
using Monte-Carlo methods.
In 1992 he
left to set up his own consultancy, Statis-
tics Extremes.
A keen advocate of the
beauty and relevance of mathematics, he
began teaching A-level maths on a part-
time, voluntary basis at St James Indepen-
dent School, where both his sons had been
pupils. He was also an active member of
the Institute of Mathematics and its Ap-
plications and chaired its London branch
from 1993 – 1996.
He attended philosophy courses for many
years and through these was initiated into
meditation and also introduced to Vedic
mathematics.
This is an old system
of mathematics from the ancient Hindu
Vedas that was rediscovered in the early
20th century. The simplicity of the tech-
niques interested Jeremy greatly and he
gave a number of lectures on Vedic maths
together with Andrew Nicholas, Kenneth Williams and James Glover.
He also co-
authored two books on the subject: ‘Introductory Lectures on Vedic Mathematics’ and
‘Vertically and Crosswise’.

About the Author
Throughout his years of teaching, Jeremy made up his own homework questions for his
pupils. He wanted to give them practical problems that demonstrated how mathematics
worked in the world. He also wanted to give his students an insight into the history of
mathematics, something often overlooked. He had a great love and understanding of his
subject and was able to convey it with patience and simplicity even to the unmathematical
mind.
In 2004, I suggested that he write a book incorporating some of his ideas and work sheets
so they could be used by others. He was able to complete it just two months before his
death from cancer in 2006.

Editor’s Note
Editor’s Note
From 1997 – 1999 I was fortunate enough to attend Jeremy’s A-level classes in applied
mathematics, studying not only mechanics with him but also statistics. From these I
vividly remember the interesting and ‘realistic’ problems that he set the class; problems
which he usually concocted himself. These were not your average ‘dry’ questions, but
involved real-world situations which gave you a true ﬂavour of the use of mathematics in
understanding Nature and her eﬀect on us and our surroundings, often with a nice touch
of humour. One particularly memorable question started with Mr E is playing for the
Slug and lettuce in the annual cricket match against the Frog and Radiator... . Perhaps
unsurprisingly to those who knew him, questions about cricket featured prominently.
But aside from the human interest, these questions had a serious objective: to encourage
you to think clearly about how to apply mathematics to a problem in order to solve
it. This is one of the hardest aspects of applied mathematics (and similarly of physics).
Once the problem is concretely phrased in the language of mathematics, one can apply
the machinery of ‘pure’ mathematics to produce a solution, which is often relatively
straightforward due to its logical nature. I shall always be grateful to Jeremy for helping
to plant a seed of physical understanding in my mind as a result of this.
In fact I have more than this to thank Jeremy for. He and James Glover allowed me to
take both Mathematics and Further Mathematics at A-level despite my not having the
usual qualiﬁcations required. Further to that Jeremy coached me in the mathematics
Sixth Term Examination Papers I was required to sit to gain entrance to read Natural
Science at Cambridge. More than 10 years on and a degree, masters and PhD later, I
indirectly owe my academic training and career to Jeremy and James’ leap of faith.
It is therefore a great pleasure to be able to repay some of that debt by helping bring
Jeremy’s book to fruition. In this task, the book has beneﬁted greatly from the input
of a number of other people.
On the technical side, James Glover provided a great
deal of feedback on the book as well as writing an eloquent preface, John F. Macqueen
created solutions to many of the vector problems and consolidated the text as a whole and
Kenneth Williams provided valuable comments and errata. In other matters, Jeremy’s
family Sine, Jonathan and James have been a great support both to me in preparing
and editing the text and, no doubt, to Jeremy in writing it. I have tried to ensure that
the text and mathematics are both free of errors and clearly presented, and have also
added solutions to a number of problems where none existed previously. Undoubtedly
some errors/typos will have slipped through my ﬁngers, however, and for those I take full
responsibility.

A note on symbols
A note on symbols
A number of mathematical symbols are used in this text, which will be familiar to many
readers. For the beneﬁt of the younger or more inexperienced reader, however, here are
a few words of explanation regarding some of the symbols used.
Basic symbols: ≈means approximately equal to, while ⇒stands for implies (often
used between steps of working where equations are being simpliﬁed for example) and ∴
stands for therefore. Multiplication is denoted in the usual ways – a × b, a · b or ab – as
is division: a ÷ b, a/b or a
b. The universal constant relating the diameter of a circle to its
circumfrence is given the usual symbol π. It has the numerical value 3.14159 . . . .
Vectors: For most of the text, vectors are treated informally. However, in Appendix A,
the notation of writing vectors in boldface is generally employed: a. The notation −→
AB,
meaning the vector taking one from A to B, is also used.
Angles: The greek letters θ and α are often used to label angles. Occasionally they are
denoted by ABC, meaning the angle formed by going from point A to point B and then
to point C. Angles are treated almost exclusively in degrees, e.g. 90◦. For conversion to
radians (a particularly ‘natural’ way to measure angles, but only occasionally used in the
text), one may simply remember that a full circle, i.e. 360◦, is equivalent to 2π radians.
Thus 90◦→90 × 2π/360 = π/2 radians. Similarly π radians →π × 360/2π = 180◦.

Kinematics – motion in a straight line
1.1
Galileo and the acceleration due to gravity
Our study of mechanics begins by following the work of Galileo, a famously independent
thinker. Born in 1564, in an era in which scientiﬁc questions were settled by reference to
authority, he pioneered the use of reason and observation. Using his own improved design
of telescope, he studied the sunspots on the Sun and showed that Jupiter has moons while
our own Moon has mountains. These discoveries challenged the presumption of the time
that heavenly bodies could have nothing in common with the Earth and would obey
diﬀerent laws. Later, he came into conﬂict with the church for asserting that the Earth is
not motionless at the centre of the universe, but revolves around the Sun. Seventy years
old, and forced by the Inquisition to retract his published opinions, he muttered “But it
still moves” even as he signed his recantation.
In those times, not much importance was attached to the precise measurement of the
phenomena of nature.
Nobody had investigated systematically such basic aspects of
experience as the way things fall. It was presumed, though, that an object dropped from
a height would fall at a constant rate, this rate – the speed – depending on the weight of
the object, with heavier objects falling faster.
Galileo’s inquiring mind found such beliefs inconsistent. If a one pound cannonball, with
a lesser natural speed of fall, is attached to a two pound cannonball, will it not slow
the larger cannonball down? But, on the other hand, should not the two together make
a composite body of weight three pounds, which should fall faster than either of them
separately? Arguments such as these led him to make a fresh start on what he called the
science of motion.
In Florence you can still see the instruments which Galileo devised for his investigations.
Having no stop-watch, he devised a water-clock to measure intervals of time, weighing
the ﬂow of water to measure the time elapsed. To allow more precise measurements than
were possible in free fall, he studied the descent of a ball rolling down a sloping groove,
repeating his measurements hundreds of times.
As a guiding principle in interpreting his data, Galileo looked for simplicity:
in the investigation of naturally accelerated motion we were led ...following
the habit and custom of nature herself...to employ only those means which
are most common, simple and easy. For I think no one believes that swim-
ming or ﬂying can be accomplished in a manner simpler or easier than that
instinctively employed by ﬁshes and birds.

Kinemactis – motion in a straight line
When, therefore, I observe a stone initially at rest falling from an elevated
position and continually acquiring new increments of speed, why should I not
believe that such increases take place in a manner which is exceedingly simple
and rather obvious to everybody?
In modern terminology, he found the very simple rule, that a falling body increases its
speed by equal increments in equal intervals of time, that is to say, its acceleration is
constant.
1.2
Constant acceleration formulæ
Kinematics is the study of movement. The word ‘kinematics’, like the word ‘cinema’,
comes from the Greek word kinesis, meaning motion. The most basic formula in kine-
matics is
distance = speed × time ,
(1.1)
which applies in the case of constant speed. From his investigations, Galileo developed
further formulæ which apply in the case of constant acceleration. His concern was pri-
marily with the constant acceleration produced by gravity, but the formulæ are valid in
any situation, such as a rocket accelerating upwards or a car accelerating on a horizontal
road, where acceleration is constant, at least for a time.
The ﬁrst of these is
v = u + at ,
(1.2)
which gives the velocity v attained after accelerating from velocity u at a constant rate
a over an interval of time t. While it is referred to as a formula, it is more than just a
recipe for calculation. When a is the subject of the equation, we have
a = v −u
t
,
(1.3)
which says acceleration is “change in velocity divided by the change in time”. This is the
very meaning of acceleration. No-one who understood this should have much diﬃculty
in remembering Formula (1.3).
Galileo’s second formula tells us the total displacement which has resulted by the end of
the time interval. If this displacement is denoted by s, then
s = u + v
2
t .
(1.4)
This also is a formula which has a natural meaning. On the right hand side (u + v)/2 is
the average of the initial velocity u and the ﬁnal velocity v. So Formula (1.4) is saying
“displacement = average velocity × time”. Again this is not diﬃcult to remember. The

Kinemactis – motion in a straight line
term ‘displacement’ is used, rather than ‘distance’, to emphasize that the direction of the
movement is signiﬁcant. For example, when a stone is thrown 20 metres into the air and
falls to earth again, the total distance travelled is 40 metres. But as far as displacement
is concerned, the journey up cancels the journey down, so the displacement s is zero.
The two formulæ, v = u + at, and s = 1
2(u + v)t, are between them the source of all that
needs to be known about constant acceleration. There are other formulæ, and special
ways to use them, but there is nothing actually new. Everything else is derived from
these two. For example, there is a third formula which results from substituting v from
Formula (1.3) into the right hand side of Formula (1.4). Then
s = u + v
2
× t
= u + u + at
2
× t .
Simplifying, we ﬁnd
s = ut + 1
2 at2 .
(1.5)
Formula (1.5) re-expresses the content of Formulæ (1.3) and (1.4) in what for some
circumstances is a more convenient form.

Kinemactis – motion in a straight line
In the same way, writing Formula (1.3) in the form u = v −at and substituting into
Formula (1.4) gives Formula (1.6)
s = vt −1
2 at2 .
(1.6)
There is still one more way to substitute into Formula (1.4). Having substituted for u
and v, there remains the option of expressing t as (v −u)/a. Putting this into Formula
(1.4) gives
s = u + v
2
× v −u
a
.
Simplifying this – note (v + u)(v −u) = v2 −u2 – means that we end up with
v2 = u2 + 2as ,
(1.7)
which is Formula (1.7).
There is a pleasing and useful symmetry about Formulas (1.3) to (1.7). Each of them
involves just four of the ﬁve variables s, u, v, a and t. And each of these ﬁve variables
occurs in just four of the formulæ – each formula leaves out a diﬀerent variable.
1.3
Using the constant acceleration formulæ
Example 1.1
A stone is thrown vertically upwards at a speed of 14 m/s. What is the maximum height
achieved?
To answer a question like this, ﬁrst identify the most convenient constant acceleration
formula and then transpose the information in the question into the variables of the
formula. In the present example, we know the initial speed u = 14 m/s, we require to
know the height attained s, and we can presume that the acceleration is the acceleration
due to gravity, numerically equal to 9.8 m/s2. The fourth variable is not stated in the
question, but is nevertheless implied. This is the ﬁnal speed v, ‘ﬁnal’ meaning the speed
at the end of the time interval which is of interest to us. At its maximum height, the
stone is neither on its way up nor on its way down. The speed v must therefore be zero.
To solve for s, the best formula is Formula (1.7), v2 = u2+2as, which relates the unknown
s to the three known variables u, v, and a. But there is one decision which has to be
taken before the formula can be applied. Which direction is to be taken as positive, up or
down? If “up” is taken as positive, then the initial velocity u = +14 m/s, but if “down”
is positive, u = −14 m/s.
There is no right or wrong in this choice. It is only necessary that the choice, once made,
is consistently applied. If, here, “up” is taken as positive, then u is positive, and s, being

a height gained, is positive, while a, being the downwards acceleration of gravity, has to
be treated as negative.
Putting in these values
02 = 142 + (2 × (−9.8) × s) ,
from which s = 10 m.
Example 1.2
With the same data as in Example 1.1, how long does the stone take to return to earth?
There is more than one way to answer this question. The best method is to use
s = ut + 1
2 at2 .
As before, u = 14 m/s, a = −9.8 m/s2. t is the unknown, while s = 0 is implied by
the statement that the stone returns to earth. The distance travelled is 10 metres up
and 10 metres down, total 20 metres, but the eventual displacement from the starting
position is zero. Putting in these values
0 = 14t +
1
2 × (−9.8) × t2
=⇒0 = t(14 −4.9t) ,
gives t = 0 or t = 20/7. 20/7 seconds, or 2.86 seconds, is the answer we need. The
t = 0 solution reminds us that the stone is also at ground level at t = 0, just before being
projected upwards.
Another way to answer the question is to ﬁrst calculate the time to reach the maximum
height. The formula
v = u + at
then tells us that
0 = 14 + (−9.8)t ,
or t = 10/7. Adding another 10/7 seconds to allow for the downward journey gives the
same total time of 20/7 seconds as before. Although this is a correct answer it does
involve the assumption that the times for the upward and downward journeys are equal.
Ideally, this would need to be demonstrated mathematically.
Example 1.3
In practice, it is unlikely that the stone in Example 1.2 would be projected upwards from
an initial position exactly at ground level. A more exact calculation would allow for the

height, say 1.4 m, at which the stone was released when thrown upwards. On returning
to ground the stone is 1.4 m below its starting point, so that s = −1.4. Then
s = ut + 1
2 at2
=⇒−1.4 = 14t −4.9t2 .
Multiplying by 10 to eliminate the decimal point, and cancelling a factor of 7 gives
7t2 −20t −2 = 0 .
A problem about throwing a stone has now been transformed into a quadratic equation.
In applied mathematics, pure mathematics can be put to use! The standard ‘quadratic’
formula gives solutions
t = 2.95 secs
or
t = −0.10 secs .
The negative solution is a little surprising. Pure mathematics is innocent of practical
matters and is faithfully reporting to us the valuable information that if the stone ﬁnds
itself in my hand 1.4 m above the ground, travelling at 14 m/s, it should have taken
oﬀfrom the ground 0.1 seconds ago. The positive solution is rather the one we need.
As would be expected, it is just that little bit larger than the value calculated on the
assumption that the launch point was at ground level. The calculation could be further
elaborated by allowing for the eﬀects of air resistance or for the size of the stone. Whether
these reﬁnements are necessary would depend on the use for which the calculation is being
done.

Kinemactis – motion in a straight line
Example 1.4
A car is reputed to be capable of reaching 60 miles per hour in 6 seconds, from a standing
start. On the assumption of uniform acceleration, what distance would be covered in this
time? (1 mile = 1.609 km.) Here, we have an acceleration in the horizontal direction,
rather than vertically, but we can still use the formula
s = (u + v)t
2
,
though we must remember to express the values in a consistent set of units. We cannot
measure time in units of hours, and in units of seconds, in the same equation. If we choose
metres and seconds as our standard units, u = 0, v = 60×1.609×1000/3600 = 26.8 m/s,
t = 6 seconds. The distance covered comes out as s = 80.45, or about 80 metres.

Velocity-time graphs
As its name implies, a velocity-time graph plots the velocity of a moving object against
time. The graph gives us another way to look at the formulæ we have been using.
In the case of an object moving at constant speed, the graph is simply a horizontal
straight line:
velocity
time
Figure 1.1: A velocity-time graph for an object moving at constant speed.
This is not a very exciting graph but it does illustrate a new idea. The area under the
graph forms a rectangle whose height is the constant value of the speed and whose base
is the time-interval under consideration. The area of the rectangle is
area = height × base
= speed × time
= distance .
The area under the graph thus represents the distance travelled.
In a graph representing constant acceleration, velocity is represented by a plot of constant
slope equal to the acceleration a, while the initial speed is u and the ﬁnal speed is v:

Using a velocity-time graph
The constant acceleration formulæ apply, naturally enough, only to time intervals during
which acceleration remains constant. When the acceleration takes diﬀerent values during
the period of interest a velocity time graph helps to bring all the information together.
Example 1.5
A car travelling at 15 m/s has to slow to a speed of 5 m/s to get over a speed bump. It
starts to decelerate 5 seconds before reaching the bump, takes 1 second to traverse the
bump and 5 seconds to accelerate back up to 15 m/s. By how many seconds has the
bump delayed the progress of the car?

Figure 1.4: A velocity-time graph for the sprinter of Example 1.6.
In the acceleration phase the sprinter covers a distance represented by the triangular
area in the velocity-time graph, 1
2 × 2 × 12 = 12 metres. At constant speed he covers
a further distance 2 × 12 = 24 metres. Between t = 4 and t = 10, his speed falls to
12 −(0.5 × 6) = 9 m/s. The distance covered is 1
2 × (12 + 9) × 6 = 63 metres. The total
distance covered in 10 seconds is therefore 12 + 24 + 63 = 99 metres.
After 4 seconds, the sprinter has covered 36 metres. Over the remaining 64 metres, his
acceleration, or rather deceleration, is constant, so that the time taken can be calculated
from the formula s = ut + 1
2at2, with given data s = 64, u = 12, a = −0.5. Putting in
the values gives a quadratic equation for t:
64 = 12t −0.25t2 ,
which has two solutions, the practically relevant value t = 6.11 seconds, and a second
solution t = 41.89 seconds. This latter corresponds to the unrealistic scenario in which
the sprinter continues to decelerate after crossing the ﬁnish line, eventually acquiring
negative velocity and re-crossing the line from the far side. The time, then, to complete
the full 100 metres is 4.00 + 6.11 = 10.11 seconds.
Notice that the two calculations provide a check on each other. The sprinter has covered
99 metres in 10 seconds and needs a further 0.11 seconds to cover the remaining 1 metre,
which is consistent with his speed of just under 9 m/s at this stage of the race.

2.1
Separating horizontal and vertical motion
The motion of a projectile such as an arrow or a cannonball reﬂects both the impetus given
to it and the continuing operation of the force of gravity. Before Galileo, scholastic opinion
held that the ‘forced’ motion of the initial impetus and the ‘natural’ motion produced by
gravity would not mix. It was presumed that the projectile would continue in a straight
line along its original direction of motion until its initial impetus was exhausted. Then
gravity would take over and it would fall vertically to the ground.
The idea of two motions not mixing contains a grain of truth, but Galileo was able to
see that the important distinction was not between ‘forced’ and ‘natural’ motion, but
between horizontal motion, however caused, and vertical motion, however caused. He
visualized a particle moving on a ‘limited and elevated’ plane, like a ball rolling over the
top of a cliﬀ. Before it reaches the cliﬀedge, it has a constant horizontal speed. The
horizontal motion continues as it passes over the edge, but now gravity comes into play
as well. The operation of gravity, and its eﬀect on the vertical motion, is not altered by
the horizontal motion, nor is the horizontal motion altered by gravity acting vertically.
Example 2.1
A ball, travelling horizontally at 7 m/s, rolls over the edge of a cliﬀ. Where will it be

motion, it will after one second be 7 metres clear of the cliﬀface. Considering the vertical
motion, the distance fallen under gravity will be the same as if the ball had been dropped
from rest, so the usual constant acceleration formula applies
s = ut + 1
2at2 ,
with u – the initial speed in the downwards direction – being zero. With t = 1 and, if
we take the downwards direction as positive, a = 9.8 m/s2, the downwards displacement
is s = 4.9 m.
Repeating the calculation at t = 2, the ball is 14 m beyond the cliﬀface and has fallen
through a vertical distance of 19.6 m. These two separate pieces of information combine
to ﬁx the position of the ball.

In the same situation as Example 2.1, what is the velocity of the ball after 2 seconds?
θ
7 m/s
19.6 m/s
The idea of calculating horizontal and vertical motion separately, and then combining
the results, applies to velocity as well as to position. When t = 2 seconds, the horizontal
velocity is 7 m/s and the vertical velocity is v = u + at = 0 + 2 × 9.8 = 19.6 m/s. These
can be combined using Pythagoras’ theorem. The total speed of the ball is therefore
V =

Components of velocity
When a particle is projected at an angle of elevation, its initial velocity is directed partly
upwards, partly horizontally. We say that it has components of velocity in both the
vertical and horizontal directions. The initial velocity has to be separated into its com-
ponents before the calculations of the vertical and horizontal motions can begin. If the
speed of projection is V , and the angle of elevation is θ, then from the trigonometry of
the diagram

the horizontal component is V cos θ and the vertical component is V sin θ.
Example 2.3
An archer shoots an arrow in a direction 30◦above the horizontal with a speed of 50 m/s.
(This is thought to be a fairly representative value for an archer with a longbow at the
time of the battle of Agincourt.) What height does it attain, and how far does it travel
before hitting the ground?
For the arrow, the vertical component of the initial velocity is 50 sin (30◦), and the hori-
zontal component is 50 cos (30◦).
To ﬁnd the height attained, it is suﬃcient to consider just the vertical motion. The arrow
has reached its greatest height when the vertical velocity is zero, so using
v2 = u2 + 2as
02 = (50 sin (30◦))2 −2 × 9.8s ,
we ﬁnd s = maximum height = 32 metres, to 2 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
To ﬁnd the range, we need ﬁrst to ﬁnd the time of ﬂight. If the position of the arrow at
time t is represented by co-ordinates (x, y), where the origin is the point of projection,
y = s = ut + 1

The arrow returns to earth when y = 0, so that

giving two solutions for t, t = 0, which is hardly news, and more interestingly t =
50 sin(30◦)/(9.8/2) = 5.1 seconds.
Meanwhile, the horizontal position x is determined by the horizontal velocity component,
which remains constant throughout the motion
x = 50 cos(30◦)t .
After 5.1 seconds, when the arrow returns to earth the horizontal distance covered, in
other words the range, is 50 cos(30◦) × 5.1 = 220.92, or 221 m to 3 s.f.

The range of a projectile depends on its initial speed and the angle of projection. If we
suppose the initial speed is V , and the angle of projection is θ, and follow through the
arrow calculation of Example 2.3 with these general variables, the time of ﬂight comes
out as t = V sin θ/(g/2) and the range is

When θ is 45◦, sin 2θ reaches its maximum value, sin(90◦) = 1, and the range reaches its
maximum value, V 2/g.
Example 2.4
Find the maximum range for the arrow of Example 2.3. Find also the angle of projection
for which the range of the arrow is exactly 50% of the maximum achievable.
The maximum range, in the absence of air resistance, and assuming level ground, is
V 2/g = 502/9.8 = 255 metres. To hit a target at half this distance, the factor sin 2θ in
the range formula V 2 sin 2θ/g must equal 0.5, giving θ = 15◦and θ = 75◦as two possible
solutions. It is a general rule that for a given horizontal range there are two possible
values of θ, symmetrically disposed about the maximum range angle of 45◦. Gunners

The constant acceleration formulæ, as used in Example 2.3, give equations for x and y. x
does not appear in the y-equation, nor y in the x-equation. The time variable t, however,

nize the curve as a parabola, the name parabola coming from the Greek meaning to fall.
Of course, since the coeﬃcient of x2 is negative, the parabola is upside down compared
with the parabolic graphs most often encountered in exercises in pure mathematics.
Example 2.5
Cricketer B hits a ball towards the boundary, aiming to clear the pavilion which is
70 metres away and 8 metres high. If the ball is struck with initial speed V at an angle
of 40◦to the horizontal, deduce the required value of V .
Here, we may borrow the equation for the arrow, derived above, by replacing the angle
30◦by 40◦, and the speed 50 m/s by V . So, in coordinates measured relative to the initial
position of the ball
y = x tan(40◦) −
9.8x2
2 × (V cos(40◦))2 .
If the ball just clears the pavilion, y must be 8 when x = 70. Substituting these values
in gives an equation
8 = 70 tan(40◦) −
9.8 × 702
2 × (V cos(40◦))2 ,
or making V 2 the subject,
V 2 =
9.8 × 702
cos2(40◦)(70 tan(40◦) −8)
giving V = 28.4 m/s.
Success would require an initial speed at least as large as this, though, as in the case of
the arrow, a more exact calculation would have to take into account air resistance.

The envelope
Consider a hose, squirting a jet of water with a given speed, or an anti-aircraft gun able
to ﬁre a shell with a given muzzle velocity. As the angle of projection varies, a range
of diﬀerent possible trajectories is produced. If the target, say P in Figure 2.5, is near
enough, it can in general be reached by two trajectories with diﬀerent angles of projection.
Other points, such as Q, are out of range, whatever the angle of the gun. The boundary
between the region of accessible targets and the region of inaccessible targets is what is
called the envelope of the family of parabolic trajectories. The diagram suggests to us
what turns out in fact to be true, that the envelope is itself another parabola.

Example 2.6
A frog squirts a jet of water with speed 7 m/s to catch a ﬂy, hovering one metre away in
horizontal distance and 2 m above ground. At what angle θ should the jet be squirted?
The strategy for solving this problem is similar to that of Example 2.5, making use of
the equation of the trajectory, although the actual solution is more diﬃcult.
With the new data, x = 1, y = 2, and V = 7, and the frog gets the ﬂy if

of θ and seeing where the graph cuts the axis. If the ﬂy is within range, we expect to
ﬁnd two values of θ that ﬁt.
Mathematical connoisseurs will also appreciate an alternative method of solution, partly
because it is quicker than drawing a graph and partly because it reveals a hidden sim-
plicity in the awkward equation for θ. The trick is to recognise that the term involving
1/ cos2 θ can be rewritten using the trigonometrical identity
1
cos2 θ = sec2 θ = 1 + tan2 θ ,
which is Pythagoras’ theorem for a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse sec θ = 1/ cos θ
and sides tan θ and 1. Then the equation becomes
tan2 θ −10 tan θ + 21 = 0 ,
which is just a quadratic equation in disguise, with tan θ being the unknown. Solving
– the equation factorises nicely – gives the values of tan θ for a direct hit as 3 and 7
corresponding to solutions θ = 71.6◦and θ = 81.9◦.

3.1
Newton’s laws
So far, in kinematics, we have studied the movement of objects or particles without
concerning ourselves with the reason why they move. In dynamics, we study the forces
which we infer to be the causes of the movements that we see. Like the word dynamite,
‘dynamics’ comes from the Greek dunamis, meaning strength or power.
A mediæval philosopher might have said that an apple falls because it is in its own
nature to fall. But now we say that the apple, as inert matter, has no intrinsic power of
motion, and must be impelled by some external force. This modern concept of force was
formulated by Isaac Newton, born in 1642, the year Galileo died. He was still an unknown
student in his early twenties when he made crucial discoveries in calculus, optics, and
the theory of gravity. Much of this work was done in a Lincolnshire farmhouse, still
there today just oﬀthe A1 trunk road, where he retreated from the plague which swept
through towns and cities in 1665 – 1666.
Newton’s laws of motion state the relationship between the forces and the movements
which they produce.
1. The ﬁrst law is:
Every body continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line
unless compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it.
To illustrate this, Newton gives some examples. Projectiles would continue their
motion, with the same speed in a straight line, if they were not retarded by the
resistance of the air or impelled downwards by the force of gravity. Planets and
comets meet with less resistance and so continue their motions for much longer
times.
2. The second law is:
The change in motion is proportional to the motive force, and in the same direction
as the motive force.
This law is usually expressed in the form of an equation,
F = ma ,
(3.1)
where F is the motive force, m is the mass of the body to which the force is
applied, and a is what Newton called the change in motion, or as we would now
say, its acceleration. Because the law is about change in motion, rather than the
motion itself, the eﬀect of the motive force is superimposed on any pre-existing
motion of the body.

3. The third law is:
To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Press a stone with your ﬁnger, says Newton, and the ﬁnger is also pressed by the
stone.
It is remarkable that from these three laws, together with the basic ideas of ‘mass’, ‘force’,
and ‘body’, Newton could develop what he called his system of the world, explaining the
motion of the planets, the comets, the moon and the tides in the sea. At the same time,
the laws allow the analysis of a wide range of practical phenomena, like the stability of
structures, the motion of vehicles, or the ﬂow of air across the wing of an aeroplane.
We could hardly expect the scheme to be so successful unless it in some way reﬂects the
intrinsic laws of the universe. As Galileo expressed it, “The book of nature is written in
the language of mathematics”.
3.2
Identifying forces
In mechanics, the forces commonly met with, apart from the force of gravity, are the
reaction force when one body presses against another, the tension force when a body is
pulled by a rope or string, and the frictional force which arises when a body slides across
a surface. A body immersed in a ﬂuid may experience a pressure force from the ﬂuid
and a drag force resisting its motion. In all these situations we are guided towards the
concept of ‘force’ by our own immediate bodily experience.
Other areas of physics may be concerned with electromagnetic forces or with the forces
in the atomic nucleus. In these cases the forces are outside our direct experience and
have to be inferred from the motions which appear to be produced.
Forces are measured in units of newtons. A force of one newton, according to the second
law, is suﬃcient to give a mass of one kilogram an acceleration of 1 m/s2, so that in the
equation F = ma we have 1 = 1×1. This deﬁnition does not tell us what a force actually
is, only how to measure it. To appreciate the basic idea of a force we have to refer back
ultimately to our own experience as described above.
Example 3.1
Galileo’s experiments show that – in the absence of air resistance – objects fall with
an acceleration of g = 9.8 m/s2. According to the equation F = ma, the gravitational
acceleration of a body of mass m must be impelled by a force of magnitude mg. The
weight, therefore, of a smallish apple, of mass 0.1 kg, is 0.1 × 9.8 or about one newton.
On the moon, where the acceleration due to gravity is 1.6 m/s2, the weight of the apple
would be only 0.1 × 1.6 = 0.16 newtons.

A lift of mass 300 kg is pulled upwards by a cable in which the

Although it is not mentioned explicitly in the question, we
have to remember that the force of gravity still operates. We
cannot turn it oﬀto simplify the calculation. The force ‘F’
in F = ma is therefore not the tension on its own, nor the
weight on its own, but their combined eﬀect, taken together.
This is called the resultant. In this case, if we take the ten-
sion, acting in the upward direction as positive, the weight
should be treated as negative. Then
F = tension −weight = ma
⇒
3300 −2940 = 300a
and the upward acceleration is found to be a = 1.2 m/s2.

Equilibrium
A body which is at rest, or travelling at constant speed in a straight line, is said to be
in equilibrium. The word implies balance. Before Newton and Galileo, we might have
presumed that Mr A sits at rest in his armchair because this happy state of quiet repose
is simply the natural condition for a man in an armchair. But, with Newton, we now
say that this state of rest is only possible because the upward reaction forces on Mr A
from the ﬂoor and from the seat of the chair are together exactly equal to his weight.
When Mr A sits, he compresses the cushion until the upwards reaction force is just right
to maintain the balance.
Mr A in his armchair is an example of static equilibrium, where there is no movement.
But the ﬁrst and second laws show us that a perfect balance of forces is also consistent
with motion at a constant speed.
Example 3.3
Mr B, mass 80 kg, stands in the corridor of a train to Glasgow travelling at 100 km/hr.
What are the forces on Mr B?
Although Mr B is speeding towards Glasgow at 100 km/hr, he is, according to the ﬁrst
law, in a state of equilibrium. There is no motion in the vertical plane and the speed of
the horizontal motion is constant. The forces experienced by Mr B must be in balance
so that their resultant is zero.
Inside the train, he is shielded from the forces of air
resistance, and so there are no forces horizontally, either forwards or backwards.
As far as the balance in the vertical direction is concerned, his weight is 80 × 9.8 =
784 newtons and we infer that the reaction vertically upwards from the ﬂoor of the train
must be of equal magnitude. A reaction force of this kind is often called a ‘normal’
reaction, using the word in the sense of ‘perpendicular’. This is to distinguish it from
any frictional force which would act in a direction parallel to the surfaces in contact.
3.4
What is a body?
Newton’s laws imply a distinction between whatever is regarded as a body and the
environment which is regarded as outside it. The forces describe the relationship between
the two. It is the forces from the environment on the body that enter the calculation –
the eﬀect of the earth on the apple, the cable on the lift, the force of the seat cushion on
the body of Mr A.
There is no restriction on what may be regarded as a body for the purpose of Newton’s
laws. It would be possible to say that Mr A’s head is maintained in equilibrium by an
upward reaction force from his neck just suﬃcient to balance its weight. It is up to the

student to draw the boundary between the body and its surroundings in whatever way
is found to be useful. Depending on the point of view, a car may be a single entity, or
an assemblage of components, or a cannonball may be viewed in terms of its constituent
atoms, each experiencing the forces exerted on it by its neighbours.
Often, Newton’s laws are used to describe the motion of a ‘particle’. Literally, the term
implies a body of zero size, and this would have been a very natural picture for Newton to
have in mind as he visualized the motion of a planet through the vastness of space. But
more generally, a ‘particle’ means any body, like the falling apple, or Mr B standing in
the train, whose size, shape, or orientation are not considered relevant to the calculation.
The only attributes of a particle are its position, velocity, acceleration and mass. Often
– but not always – this is a useful simpliﬁcation.
Example 3.4
Mr C, mass 60 kg, goes up in a lift of mass 340 kg, the tension in the cable being
4200 newtons. What is the upward reaction on Mr C’s feet from the ﬂoor of the lift?

Figure 3.1: The forces on the lift (left) and the forces on Mr C (right).
First, apply F = ma to Mr C plus the lift, considered as a single composite body of mass
340 + 60 = 400 kg and weight 400g = 3920 newtons.
F = tension −weight = ma
⇒
4200 −3920 = 400a ,
giving a = 0.7 m/s2. Now apply F = ma to Mr C, considered as a body on his own,
subjected to his own weight of 588 N and the reaction forces R1 and R2 on his feet from
the ﬂoor of the lift. Since Mr C’s acceleration must be the 0.7 m/s2 just calculated,
R1 + R2 −588 = 60 × 0.7 = 42 .
The total reaction force R1 + R2 = R is therefore about 630 newtons. Since Mr C is
considered as particle, we do not distinguish between the separate forces R1 and R2.

(b) Together, the bucket and the chain may also be regarded as a body in equilibrium.
The force exerted on the combined body from the hook must be equal to the combined
weight, 2.5 × 9.8 = 24.5 newtons. Necessarily, this force has to be applied at the point
where the hook holds the chain. According to the third law, the force exerted by the
chain on the hook is equal and opposite, that is to say 24.5 newtons downwards.
The force which the chain exerts on the hook or on the bucket is the tension. Here,
because of the weight of the chain, the tension takes diﬀerent values at the top and the
bottom. Exam questions and other problems involving chains or strings often assume
that these are “light”, that is to say their mass can be disregarded. In these cases the
tension at the two ends of the string are the same.
People sometimes ﬁnd it puzzling that the force or pull exerted by a string at one end is in
the opposite direction to the force exerted at the other end. Consider this from the point
of view of, say, a tug-of-war rope. The forces on the rope at its ends are stretching it and
must be opposed to each other – if acting together, they would give it an impossibly large
acceleration. Similarly the forces exerted by the rope at each end are pulling inwards
towards the middle of the rope.

Applying Newton’s second law to the car and trailer together

so the acceleration is a = 1 m/s2. If T is the tension in the tow bar, then applying the
second law to the trailer on its own
T = 600a = 600 newtons.
Note that the driving force plays no direct part in the equation for the trailer. The
trailer does not know about the engine. It is only via the tow-bar that the driving force

The same answer for the tension T could equally well be provided by applying the second
law to the car:
1800 −T = 1200a ,
conﬁrming the same value for the tension.
Problems of this kind are referred to as ‘connected particle’ problems. They illustrate
how Newton’s methods for single bodies or particles can be extended to complex systems.
While Newton’s laws presume a division of the universe into distinct entities or particles,
the example of the tow-bar indicates how, at least in principle, we bring the separated
particles together again.
Example 3.7
Weight A, of mass 5 kg, is connected to weight B, of mass 2 kg, by a light cord which
passes over a pulley. Initially, the cord is taut and A and B hang down on either side of
the pulley. What is the acceleration when the system is released?

Figure 3.3: The pulley system of Example 3.7
Pulley problems can be confusing to the uninitiated. We know that when the system is
released, A will go down, and B will go up. With its separate parts going in diﬀerent
directions, it is diﬃcult to visualize an equation for the system as a whole.
Instead, we have to work with equations which represent Newton’s second law applied to
each of A and B separately. If the string is inextensible, the downwards acceleration of
A must be the same as the acceleration of B upwards. We do not know its value, but we
can call it a. And if there is no friction in the pulley, the tension in the string will be the
same on both sides, and we can call it T. This may not seem like progress, but it allows
us to write down Newton’s equations for A and for B:
Under the force of its own weight, A will accelerate downwards, and the tension in the
cord will act to slow its descent
49 −T = 5a .

B will accelerate upwards, its weight acting downwards being insuﬃcient to overcome the
upward pull of the cord. If the string is inextensible we may say that the acceleration of
B upwards is the same as that of A downwards, so that
T −19.6 = 2a .
By naming the unknowns and writing down the equations of motion, applied mathematics
has completed its job. It has presented us with simultaneous equations in the unknowns
a and T. Now it is up to pure mathematics to solve them. In this case the easiest route
is to add the two equations together so that the T’s cancel out.
49 −T + T −19.6 = 5a + 2a
⇒
29.4 = 7a ,
so a = 4.2 m/s2.
The tension T, if we require it, can now be found by substituting back for a in one of the
equations, giving T = 28 newtons.

Resistance forces
4.1
Air resistance
Galileo was aware that his proposition that every object falls with the same acceleration
was an idealization. Dropped from a tower, a cannonball will reach the ground slightly
sooner than an apple, while a leaf or a spider hardly seems to fall at all. He recognized,
though, that these diﬀerences arose not from diﬀerences in the eﬀects of gravity but from
diﬀerences in the eﬀects of air resistance.
Modern engineers use a formula to estimate the force of air resistance or drag. For an
object with cross section A, moving at speed v through a ﬂuid of density ρ, the drag is
D =
1
2CdAρv2 ,
(4.1)
where Cd, which depends on the shape of the object, is called the drag coeﬃcient. This
is not a fundamental law, in the same way that Newton’s laws are fundamental. Rather,
the formula sums up for practical purposes the eﬀects of the complex eddying ﬂuid ﬂow
around the moving object, and the coeﬃcient Cd is most easily found by experiment. For
a sphere, or a streamlined car, Cd is about 0.3, compared with a value of 0.8 or more for
a parachute.
Looking at the formula we see that, as might have been expected, the drag force increases
with the size of the moving body, and with the density of the ﬂuid which must move to
let the body through. The drag also increases with the square of the speed v, so that it
rapidly becomes signiﬁcant as the body picks up speed.
Example 4.1
The fastest recorded tennis serve is 150 mph, or about 66 m/s. Estimate the extent to
which the ball would be slowed by air resistance by the time it passes over the net about
0.2 seconds later.
In the formula for the drag force, we substitute values for the drag coeﬃcient for a
sphere, Cd = 0.3, the radius of the ball, 3.2 cm, the density of air 1.2 kg/m3, and the
speed v = 66 m/s, giving
D = 0.5 × 0.3 × π(0.032)2 × 1.2 × 662 = 2.5 newtons ,
and taking the mass of the ball as 58 grams, the consequent deceleration will be, by
Newton’s second law
a = D/m = 43 m/s2 .
After 0.2 seconds the speed would be
v = u + at = 66 −43 × 0.2 = 57 m/s .

Resistance forces
Of course, this is only an approximate value, since the drag force, and so the acceleration
of the ball, are actually changing continuously as its speed reduces.
4.2
Terminal velocity
If an object is dropped from a suﬃcient height and gains speed as it falls, there comes a
point when the drag force equals its weight. The ball is now in equilibrium, as deﬁned in
Section 3.3, and no further acceleration will occur. The speed vt at which this happens
is called the terminal velocity, and can be calculated from the equation
Drag force = D =
1
2CdAρv2
t = mg = weight .
(4.2)
Example 4.2
Calculate the terminal velocity for the tennis ball of Example 4.1.
Substituting in the values,
0.5 × 0.3 × π(0.032)2 × 1.2 × v2
t = 0.058 × 9.8 ,
gives vt = 31 m/s.

and weights.

Table 4.1: Terminal velocities for free fall through air.
We see that Table 4.1 largely bears out the early idea that larger, heavier objects fall
faster. The underlying principle of equal gravitational acceleration is only directly ob-
servable in the ﬁrst few tenths of a second after an object is dropped, before air resistance
has a signiﬁcant eﬀect. From the vantage point of the twenty-ﬁrst century, it is easy to
look back on the mediæval view of mechanics with a certain air of superiority. But,
without the help of Galileo and Newton, we also might have found it hard to look beyond
our own immediate experience.

Example 4.3
Sketch the velocity time graph for the tennis ball as it is dropped from rest at time t = 0.
Two pieces of information help us to determine the shape of the curve. First, we know
that at t = 0, when the downward velocity of the ball is zero, the air resistance force
is zero and the acceleration is simply the gravitational acceleration g = 9.8 m/s2. This
ﬁxes the initial slope of the v-t graph. And secondly we know that the velocity can
never exceed the terminal velocity. We expect therefore that the gradient of the graph
reduces, as t increases and air resistance has a greater eﬀect, becoming almost zero as it
approaches the terminal velocity.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Dynamic friction
Friction was ﬁrst studied by Leonardo da Vinci but the formulæ we now use originate
with Charles Coulomb, the same Coulomb whose name is commemorated in the name for
the unit of electric charge. His thesis on friction, completed in 1781, won a prize oﬀered
by the French Academie des Sciences for “...new experiments, made on a large scale,
and applicable to machines valuable to the Navy, such as the pulley, the capstan and the
inclined plane...”.
Friction occurs when two surfaces are in contact, and it opposes any tendency of one
surface to slide across the other. If the surfaces are in fact in relative motion, the resistive
force is ascribed to dynamic friction. If on the other hand the resistive force is suﬃcient
to prevent any motion it is ascribed to static friction. The two kinds of friction are very
closely related but it is convenient to consider dynamic friction ﬁrst.
Coulomb’s key insight was the realization that the magnitude of the frictional force does
not depend, as one might have expected, on the area of the two surfaces which are in
contact, or on the speed of their relative motion, but only on the nature of the two
surfaces in contact and the reaction force between them. Experiments show that the
frictional force is very well approximated by the formula
Ff = µN ,
(4.3)
where N is the normal reaction force and µ is the coeﬃcient of friction which is determined
by the nature of the two surfaces. This formula is often called the law of friction.
For example, suppose Mr B, mass 80 kg, is skating on an ice rink. The normal reaction
force from the ice must balance his weight, 784 newtons. If the coeﬃcient of friction
between the ice and the steel blades of his skates is µ = 0.05, the frictional force opposing
his motion will be Ff = 0.05 × 784 = 39.2 newtons.
The formula also tells us – because there is no dependence on the areas of the surfaces in
contact – that the frictional force Ff remains the same, regardless of whether Mr B has
both skates in contact with the ice or glides elegantly along on a single blade. Similarly, if
Mr C, mass 60 kg, now skates alongside Mr B, the coeﬃcient of friction will be the same,
because the surfaces in contact, ice and steel, are the same. But since Mr C weighs less
than Mr B, the normal reaction is only 588 newtons. The frictional resistance to the
motion of Mr C is therefore 0.05 × 588 = 29.4 newtons.
Table 4.2 shows some typical values for the coeﬃcient of friction µ for a range of surfaces
and materials.

Table 4.2: Typical values for the coeﬃcient of friction.
We suppose that the coeﬃcient of friction between the tyres and the road is – according
to Table 4.2 – µ = 0.7. We are not told the mass of the car, but can suppose that it
is M kg. Then the frictional force which slows the car, once the wheels have locked and
the tyres slide across the road surface, is Ff = µMg and the deceleration of the car is
determined by Newton’s second law, F = −Ff = Ma. The unknown mass M cancels
from the equation and we ﬁnd a = −µg = −6.86 m/s2, the minus sign indicating that
the frictional force opposes the motion and the car is slowing down.
The speed of the car at impact, v, and the speed of the car before the brakes were applied,
u, are linked by the constant acceleration formula
v2 = u2 + 2as .
We do not know v, but it will at any rate be greater than zero. The acceleration a we
have just calculated and the distance s is equal to the length of the skid marks. So the
minimum estimate for the initial speed u is given by
0 = u2 + 2 × −6.86 × 15
⇒u = 14.3 .
Before the accident, therefore, Mr A was travelling no slower than 14 m/s, or 32 mph.
4.4
Static friction
The general tendency of frictional forces is to oppose relative motion between two sur-
faces, and the term ‘static’ friction describes the case when relative motion is altogether
prevented. For example, a mass M, resting on a rough horizontal surface, and subjected
to a horizontal force P, will remain at rest when P is small, because the frictional forces
are suﬃcient to maintain equilibrium. The mass will only be dislodged when P exceeds
a threshold equal to the maximum static frictional force achievable. See Figure 4.1.

Figure 4.1: An illustration of static friction and the transition to dynamic friction as P

It is usually accepted that the maximum friction, which P must overcome, is equal to the
dynamic frictional force µN which will operate once sliding does actually occur. Since
this is a maximum value, the law of friction for static friction takes the form
Ff ≤µN .
(4.4)
The coeﬃcient of friction, µ, is hard to measure reliably in the static case and there is
some evidence that the ‘static’ value of µ is larger than the ‘dynamic’ µ – in other words
it is easier to keep the movement going than it is to get it started. For the purposes of
calculation, though, we shall be assuming that the two values of µ are the same.

tion between the pots and the ground is
0.7. How many pots, mass 0.5 kg each, are
needed to withstand a force from the door
of 20 newtons?
If Mr B uses n pots, the normal reaction
between the ground and the pots will be
N = n × 0.5 × 9.8 = 4.9n newtons and the limiting frictional force will be µN =
4.9µn newtons. To match a force of 20 newtons, 4.9µn = 3.43n = 20, giving n = 5.83,
or, since pots come in whole numbers, n = 6.
Example 4.6
Mr C puts his toolbox, total mass 15 kg, on the ﬂoor in the rear of his van. Later, while
driving, he is obliged to brake suddenly, decelerating at 5 m/s2. If µ is the value of the
coeﬃcient of friction between the toolbox and the ﬂoor of the van, what is the value of
µ which will prevent the tools from sliding forwards when he brakes?

The van and the toolbox are both in motion, but, in so far as we are hoping that there
will be no relative motion, this is nevertheless a problem in static friction. When the
van decelerates, the toolbox, not itself experiencing any direct braking force, will tend to
continue forwards at constant speed. To decelerate, it must be retarded by the frictional
force from the ﬂoor of the van.
From Newton’s second law, therefore
Ff = ma = 15 × 5 = 75 newtons .
But from the law of friction

over a pulley. Initially, the string is taut with A resting on a horizontal table while B

What is the acceleration when the system is released? What happens if µ = 3/7?

Resistance forces
This is a variant of the pulley problem of Chapter 3, and the same principles apply.
We apply Newton’s law separately to mass A and to mass B and solve the resulting
simultaneous equations. Considering the horizontal motion of A, the tension in the cord
T, acting to the left, is opposed by the force of friction Ff acting to the right. The
equation of motion is therefore
T −Ff = 5a .
We assume, provisionally, that motion does indeed occur, so that the frictional force will
take its limiting value, Ff = µN = 1/7 × 5 × 9.8 = 7 newtons.
If the string is inextensible, the downwards acceleration a of B is the same as the hori-
zontal acceleration of A. And if the pulley is frictionless, the tension in the string is the
same on each side. So with the same variables a and T, the equation for the downward
motion of B is
19.6 −T = 2a .
Solving, we ﬁnd the acceleration is 1.8 m/s2.
For the larger value of µ = 3/7, the limiting value of the frictional force on A is µN =
21 newtons. This is larger than the weight of B, so the system remains at rest, with
a = 0, T = 19.6 newtons and Ff = 19.6 newtons, less than the limiting value.
4.5
Rolling motion
The rolling of a wheel can be regarded as the combination of two separate motions, the
rotation of the body of the wheel around its centre and the steady progression of the
centre itself. A given point P on the circumference, when near the top of the wheel,
will be moving faster than the centre, because here the eﬀects of the rotation and the
steady translation tend to add. Conversely, when near the ground, it will be moving more
slowly. Approaching contact, the direction of motion becomes vertically downwards, and
P is lowered towards the ground, while after contact, P lifts oﬀvertically upwards, rather
as the soles of our feet do when we walk.
If we follow P through a complete revolution it traces out in space a mathematically
interesting curve known as a cycloid. The crucial point is that, P, at the moment it is
in contact with the ground, is instantaneously at rest. Consequently, there need be no
frictional force resisting the motion.
This is the situation in freewheeling motion, but when, say, a car accelerates, there are
additional forces from the engine which are directed to increasing the speed of rotation of
the driving wheels. With an increase in rotation speed, the point on the wheel in contact
with the ground would tend to slip backwards, except that a frictional force, acting in
a forwards direction, opposes the relative motion. We are led therefore to the seemingly
paradoxical conclusion that it is the force of friction which is ultimately responsible for
driving the car forwards.

To conﬁrm, consider that Newton’s third law says that the force exerted by the car, on

example in the shower of mud or grit which is projected backwards when a car moves oﬀ
rapidly on a loose surface.

Vector addition
Forces are ‘vector’ quantities. They have direction as well as magnitude. Consequently,
we cannot necessarily say that a force of 15 newtons, plus a force of 10 newtons, makes
a total force of magnitude 25 newtons. 25 newtons is a maximum ﬁgure, but depending
on the directions, the answer might be as small as 5 newtons.

C

Figure 5.1: The parallelogram OBCA.
When forces combine they follow the parallelogram law. Suppose, says Newton, that a
body, initially at rest at O, is acted on by two forces FA and FB. Applied separately, FA
would in a given unit of time take the body to A, while FB would take it to B, as shown.
Now complete the parallelogram, drawing AC parallel to OB and BC parallel to OA.
FB
FC
FA
Figure 5.2: The corresponding parallelogram of forces.
When force FA operates, it carries the body in the direction of A, towards the line AC.
But this progression of the body towards AC is not altered by force FB, acting in the
direction OB, which is parallel to AC. The body will arrive at the line AC at the same
time, independently of whether FB acts or not. By the same argument, the body will
arrive at the line BC, regardless of whether FA acts or not. Consequently, at the end of
the given unit of time, the body must be at C, which lies both on AC and BC. The force
FC, which would in this same time have carried the body directly to C, is the resultant
of the separate forces FA and FB, their combined eﬀect.
The parallelogram in Figure 5.1 above is a diagram of the movements or displacements
occurring in the given time t. The lengths of the lines represent the distances moved, and,

Resolving forces
since the body was initially at rest, the lengths are also proportional to the accelerations
(s = 0t + 1
2at2, for the same t). By Newton’s second law, the accelerations are in turn
proportional to the forces. So the parallelogram geometry applies equally to the forces.
If FA and FB are two forces represented in magnitude and direction by two sides of a
parallelogram, their resultant FC is represented by the diagonal. See Figure 5.2.
A specially simple case is when the forces FA and FB are perpendicular. Then Pythagoras’
theorem applies and the resultant FC has magnitude equal to

Components of a force
The geometrical argument for calculating the resultant can be used in the reverse direc-
tion, to express an oblique force F as the sum of two perpendicular forces. These forces,
in the x- and y-directions say, are called the x- and y-components of F.

is the angle between F and the x-axis. Similarly, Fy = F sin θ. These properties of the
force components follow exactly the same idea that we have already used for velocity
components in our analysis of projectiles.

Resolution of forces
We have called our axes x and y, but there is no rule which says that these have to
be horizontal and vertical, or east and north, or in any other ﬁxed directions.
The
intelligent approach is to adapt the axes to the problem at hand. Then if F is a force
which is inclined at an angle θ to some important direction OD, the component of F
along the chosen direction OD is F cos θ.

Resolving forces
Example 5.1
A force of P = 500 newtons is applied to a railway truck of mass 2500 kg, at angle of 30◦
to the line of the track. There is a resistance force of 300 N directly opposing the motion.
What is the acceleration of the truck?
"##!$!
!!%!&##!$!
"#°!
'((!%!)!
In this example, we may presume that the truck will stay on the rails, so that we are only
concerned with motion along the track. We therefore focus our attention only on the
forces which act in this direction, or, for an oblique force like P, only on the component
of P in the direction of the track. There are of course other forces acting, such as the
weight of the truck, which acts downwards, and the transverse force from the rails which
keeps the truck on line, but we do not include these in the calculation of the motion along
the track. Resolving forces parallel to the track, therefore, we write Newton’s second law
F = ma as
500 cos(30◦) −300 = 2500a
The ﬁrst term on the left hand side is the component of P along the direction of the track
and the second term, which is the resistance force, enters with a minus sign because it
opposes the motion. Solving for the acceleration, we ﬁnd a = 0.05 m/s2.
Example 5.2
Mr C, mass 60 kg, freewheels downhill on his bicycle, mass 5 kg. If the slope is inclined at
an angle of 10◦to the horizontal, and air resistance and frictional forces can be neglected,
what is his acceleration?

Here, the force driving the acceleration is the combined weight of Mr C and his bicycle,
637 newtons.
This acts vertically downwards, but it is best to resolve forces in the
direction of the actual motion, which is down the slope. This is perfectly legitimate –
we are not restricted to axes only in the horizontal or vertical directions. With the slope
at 10◦to the horizontal, the angle between the weight, acting vertically downwards, and
the direction of motion, down the slope, is 80◦. Resolving down the slope, and treating

Resolving forces
Mr C and the bicycle as a single ‘particle’, gives Newton’s law in the form
637 cos(80◦) = 65a
→a = 1.7 m/s2 .
A very slightly quicker route in this type of problem depends on the trigonometrical
identity cos θ = sin(90◦−θ). Our expression for the component of Mr C’s weight which
acts down the slope, 637 cos(80◦), can be equally well written as 637 sin(10◦), which
relates the force component directly to the angle of inclination of the slope.
Example 5.3
Two weights W1 and W2 are connected by a string which passes over a smooth pulley.
W1 is suspended vertically below the pulley while W2 rests on a smooth slope which is
inclined at an angle α to the horizontal, where tan α = 3/4. How should W1 and W2 be
related if the system is to rest in equilibrium?
W1

P
A

Since the weights are at rest, this problem would be classed as an exercise in statics –
as compared with Examples 5.1 and 5.2 which are applications of dynamics. The only
diﬀerence is that here the value of the acceleration happens to be zero. The arguments
we use are exactly the same.
Suppose the tension in the string is T. Then, considering the equilibrium of W1,
T = W1 ,
while resolving down the slope gives the condition for the equilibrium of W2:
T = W2 cos(90◦−α) = W2 sin α .
The angle α comes from a right-angled 3, 4, 5-triangle, so that tan α = 3/4, sin α = 3/5,
cos α = 4/5, and so
W1 = T = W2 sin α = 3W2

Resolving forces
Another way to look at this answer is to replace the single weight W1 by three equal
weights w and similarly the weight W2 by ﬁve weights w.
We can suppose that the
weights are equally spaced on the string, so that three weights w lie on BP which, because
of the 3, 4, 5 geometry is 3 units long, and ﬁve w’s on AP which is 5 units long.

Figure 5.6: Simon Stevin’s solution to the problem.
If we imagine the weights on AP and BP form part of a continuous loop, we expect the
loop as a whole to remain in equilibrium. Any tendency to rotate one way or the other
would constitute a perpetual motion machine. But the loop segment BA, taken on its
own, is clearly in balance which implies that the weights on BP and AP must balance
each other, in agreement with the conclusion we have reached by resolving forces. This
elegant argument was discovered by a contemporary of Galileo, Simon Stevin, called the
‘Dutch Archimedes’ for his proliﬁc inventions, which included a sand yacht which beat a
horse in a race along the sea shore.

Resolving forces
5.4
Resolving forces in two directions
In the examples so far, it has been suﬃcient to consider the balance of forces in a single
‘obvious’ direction – usually the direction of any actual or possible motion. But in more
complex problems it is necessary to resolve forces in two separate directions.
Example 5.4
A brick rests on an inclined board, with the coeﬃcient of friction between the brick and
the board being µ = 0.5. One end of the board is lifted until the brick starts to slip.
What is the inclination of the plank to the horizontal when this happens?
θ
Mg
N
Ff
Figure 5.7: A brick on an inclined board.
Suppose that the mass of the brick is M and its weight is Mg. The brick will start to
slide once the component of its weight in the direction of the slope, Mg sin θ, exceeds the
limiting frictional force Ff = µN.
This condition, however, does not provide suﬃcient information on its own. We have ﬁrst
to calculate the normal reaction N. On this inclined surface, N needs to balance not the
whole weight of the brick but only the component of the weight which is perpendicular
to the slope. Resolving perpendicular to the slope gives
N = Mg cos θ .
Assuming limiting friction and going back now to the force balance parallel to the slope
Ff = µN = µMg cos θ = Mg sin θ ,
so that
µ = tan θ .
(5.1)
This equation for the limiting value of the angle of inclination of the board was discovered
by the German mathematician Euler. For µ = 0.5, the solution is θ = 26.6◦.
Example 5.5
A kite of mass 0.5 kg is attached to a ﬁxed point on the ground by a string of length
30 metres, and kept airborne by a lift force of 20 newtons from the wind. If the lift force

is inclined at an angle of 30◦to the vertical, at what height above the ground can the
kite rest in equilibrium?

Figure 5.8: The kite of Example 5.5.
As in Example 5.4, this is a question where it is necessary to resolve forces in two direc-
tions. Suppose that the tension in the kite string is T and that the string makes an angle
θ with the ground. Resolving vertically, assuming equilibrium, gives
T sin θ = 20 cos(30◦) −4.9 .
Resolving horizontally,
T cos θ = 20 cos(60◦) .
Dividing the ﬁrst equation by the second, to eliminate T, gives
tan θ = 1.242 .
Hence θ = 51.2◦, and the height of the kite above the ground is 30 × sin(51.2◦) =
23.4 metres.

Rigid bodies
6.1
Why rigid?
For many purposes we can deal with tennis balls, cars, and even planets as though they
were particles, of eﬀectively zero size. But there are instances where the particle picture
is not enough. A playground see-saw would hardly be a see-saw if it did not have two
ends, separated by some ﬁxed distance. In the language of mechanics, a ‘rigid body’ is a
body whose ﬁxed size and shape are signiﬁcant features of the problem at hand.
The analysis of rigid bodies involves an extra degree of complication. Potentially, we
must deal with their rotation as well as with any translational motion from one point to
another. The questions discussed in this chapter, however, all relate to bodies which are
in equilibrium, keeping a ﬁxed position and orientation. Problems about cricket bats or
Catherine Wheel ﬁreworks are, regrettably, beyond our scope for the present.
6.2
The lever
The law of the lever was formulated by Archimedes, generally reckoned, along with
Newton and Gauss, as one of the three greatest mathematicians in history. Born in 287
BC, he lived in the town of Syracuse in Sicily, and was famous both as a mathematician
and as an inventor of mechanical devices and engines of war. Of his work it was said, it is
not possible to ﬁnd in all geometry more diﬃcult and intricate questions, or more simple
and lucid explanations. . . no amount of investigation of yours would succeed in attaining
the proof, and yet, once seen, you immediately believe you could have discovered it.
The law of the lever says that if two masses rest in equilibrium on a beam, or ‘rigid rod’,
the product of the masses with their respective distances from the fulcrum are equal. In
the diagram below, m1 × x1 = m2 × x2.
x1
x2
This Archimedes deduced from simple arguments of symmetry. Suppose, he said, that
the masses are measured in some common unit. If the unit is m, suppose for the sake of
illustration, m1 = 3m and m2 = 2m. Then the total mass is 5m, and the beam will be
balanced if its length is divided into 5 equal parts with a unit mass placed at the centre
of each.

Applied Mathematics by Example: Theory
64 
Rigid bodies
Now, without disturbing the overall balance, the three masses on the left hand side can
be brought together at their common centre of gravity, as can the two masses on the
right:
Here it is seen that the mass 3m on the left is positioned one unit of length from the
fulcrum, while the mass 2m on the right is at a distance of one and half units, conﬁrming
the constancy of the product, mass × distance.
In modern terminology, the law of the lever is expressed in terms of the ‘moments’ of
the forces acting either side of the fulcrum, where the moment of a force about an axis
is the product of the magnitude of the force and the perpendicular distance of its line of
action from the axis. Given a fulcrum, the action of a force can be magniﬁed if it acts at
a greater distance. We meet applications of the law every day in, for example, the door
handle or the bottle-opener, and also, as Newton remarked, in the operation of muscles
and bones in living creatures.

The natural fulcrum for this calculation is the point of contact of the wheel with the
ground. To lift the legs of the barrow clear of the ground, the clockwise turning moment
of the applied force on the handles must balance the counter-clockwise moment of the
load.
U × 1.00 = 400 × 0.25 .
The force required is therefore U = 100 newtons.
6.3
Rigid bodies in equilibrium
Generally, problems about rigid bodies in equilibrium or in limiting equilibrium, on the
point of movement, need three equations for their solution. Two equations come from
the balance of forces in horizontal and vertical directions, or other alternative directions,
just as with the analysis of a ‘particle’. The third equation comes from taking moments.
The principle is that in equilibrium the sum of the moments is zero. The centre for the
moments calculation can be chosen to make the equation as simple as possible – there is
no requirement that it should be a natural fulcrum for the problem.
Example 6.2
A shelf 2 metres long, supported by brackets at its two ends L and R, carries a set of
encyclopædias of total weight 100 newtons. The volumes occupy a one metre length of
the shelf at the left hand end. What are the loads FL and FR on the two brackets?
We shall ignore the weight of the shelf itself and suppose that the weight of the books
acts through their geometric mid-point. There is no natural pivot here but we can choose
to take moments about, say, the left hand end of the shelf, L. Then
100 × 0.5 = FL × 0 + FR × 2 ,

FL
FR
and FR = 25 newtons. We notice how the decision to take moments about L eliminates
from the resulting equation the force FL which acts through L. This is a general principle
and a very valuable trick for arriving at simple equations.
Having now calculated FR, it follows that FL = 75 newtons since the sum FL + FR must
equal the total weight of the books.
Example 6.3
Farmer G is pushing (in a horizontal direction) on a cube-shaped bale of straw, of size
1 m × 1 m × 1 m and weight 500 newtons. Calculate the force F required to make the
bale start to turn over.

!#$$!
!!!$&#!
!!!(!'!
When the bale turns, it will rotate initially about the edge E. The clockwise moment
of F about E must overcome the anticlockwise moment of the weight, acting through
the centre of gravity. It does not matter that one force is vertical, the other horizontal.
“Force × perpendicular distance” applies just the same. Thus F × 1 = 500 × 0.5, and
the force required is 250 newtons.
The supplementary question which arises in this situation is how rough the ground needs
to be to stop the bale from sliding away from G as he tries to rotate it. To consider this
we need to consider the forces on the bale more carefully. In addition to the weight of
the bale and the applied force F, we must include the normal reaction force N from the
ground on the bale and the friction force Ff.

Considering the equilibrium situation just before the bale moves, resolving forces hori-
zontally and then vertically tells us
Ff = F = 250 newtons , N = 500 newtons .
Since µ ≥Ff/N, the minimum coeﬃcient of friction between the bale and the ground
must be 0.5. Notice that as Ff and N act at E, they don’t contribute to moments about
E.

Rigid bodies
Example 6.4
A ladder of length 6.5 m and weight 200 N rests against a wall with its base on rough
ground 2.5 m away from the bottom of the wall. The wall is perfectly “smooth” so the
reaction R from the wall on the ladder is exactly perpendicular to the wall. What is the
minimum value of µ, the coeﬃcient of friction between the ground and the ladder, for
the ladder to remain in equilibrium in this position?
R
N
Ff
θ
200 N
Figure 6.1: The ladder of Example 6.4 resting against a wall.
Let θ be the angle the ladder makes with the horizontal. From the dimensions given,
cos θ = 2.5/6.5 = 5/13, and θ is an angle in a 5, 12, 13 Pythagorean triangle with sin θ =
12/13, tan θ = 12/5. The simplest moment balance comes from taking moments about
the base of the ladder, which will eliminate both N and Ff from the resulting equation.
Assuming the centre of gravity of the ladder to be at its mid-point, and balancing the
moment about B of the ladder’s weight with the moment of the reaction at the wall, R
200 × 1
2 × 6.5 cos θ = R × 6.5 sin θ ,
giving R = 200 × 1/2 × 5/12 = 412
3 newtons. And, resolving vertically and horizontally,
N = 200 newtons , Ff = R = 41 2
3 newtons .
Since µ ≥Ff/N, the limiting value for µ is 412
3 ÷ 200 = 5/24, about 0.21.
Example 6.5
If, in Example 6.4, the actual value of µ is 0.35, how far up the ladder could Mr B climb
before it starts to slip, if his weight is 800 N?
This looks a more complicated problem than Example 6.4, but the same equations apply.
We need only to add in the extra contribution of Mr B. If he climbs a distance x up the
ladder, the moments equation becomes (see Figure 6.2)
0.5 × 200 × 6.5 cos θ + 800 × x cos θ = R × 6.5 sin θ .

The horizontal force balance is unchanged

Now put R = Ff = µN = 0.35×1000 = 350 in the moments equation to ﬁnd the limiting
value of x,
x = (6.5 × 350 tan θ −0.5 × 200 × 6.5)

giving x = 6.01 metres. The ladder would therefore slip just before Mr B reaches the top.

B which passes over a pulley at a point D 4.2 m directly above A. If the weight of the
bridge is 2000 N, calculate (a) the tension in the chain needed to lift the bridge from its
horizontal resting position and (b) the vertical and horizontal components of the force
exerted by the bridge on the hinge at A.
(a) Consider the equilibrium of the bridge and equate the anti-clockwise turning moment
about A of the cable tension T with the clockwise moment of the weight. Then, if p is
the perpendicular distance from A to the cable BD,
T × p = 2000 × 1
2AB .
To calculate p, notice that the area of the triangle ABD can be calculated either by taking
AB as the base, and AD as the height, or taking BD as the base, and p as the height.
Since both routes must lead to the same answer, p = (AB × AD)/BD. Substituting for
p in the moments equation
T = 2000 × 1
2AB ×
BD
AB×AD = 1000 × BD
AD = 1381 newtons.
(b) Again, since the bridge is in equilibrium the horizontal force H from the hinge must
balance the horizontal component of the cable tension,
H = T cos θ = T AB
BD = 952 newtons.

(c) Similarly, the vertical force V , together with the vertical component of the tension,
must balance the weight of 2000 newtons, giving
V + T sin θ = 2000
⇒V = 2000 −T sin θ = 2000 −T AD
BD = 1000 newtons.
V and H are forces on the bridge from the hinge. The forces on the hinge will, by Newton’s
third law, be equal and opposite, that is 952 newtons into the wall, and 1000 newtons
downwards.
A hidden assumption in all the calculations here is that the weight of the chain is small
compared with the weight of the bridge. A more realistic chain would sag under its own
weight, modifying the geometry of the triangle ABD and the equations we have derived
from it.
Example 6.7
A suspension bridge has a span of 100 metres and the deck, which weighs 200 tonnes,
hangs from cables ﬁxed to piers on either side. The cable ﬁxing points are 20 metres
above the level of the deck. Assuming that the weight of the cables is small compared
with the weight of the deck, calculate the tension in the cables (a) at the centre of the
span and (b) at the ﬁxing points.

Figure 6.4: A suspension bridge with a span of 100 m and a deck-weight of 200 tonnes.
Consider the right hand half of the bridge – including the deck and cables, but excluding
the pier – as a single body shown in Figure 6.5. It is subject to three forces: its own
weight, 100 tonnes, acting through the mid-point M of the half-span OX, the horizontal
force from the tension in the cable T0 at the centre of the span, and the oblique force T1
at the cable attachment point P. To ensure the overall balance of forces, the vertical and
horizontal components of T1 must be equal to the weight 100 tonnes and the horizontal
tension T0.
A further requirement for equilibrium is that the combined turning moment of these
three forces must be zero. The lines of action of both the deck weight and the horizontal
tension T0 both pass through M, giving zero turning moment. To ensure zero moment
from all three forces, the line of action of the third force T1 must also pass through M.
To satisfy the geometry, its vertical and horizontal components must have the same ratio

The same kind of analysis can be applied, not only to the half-span, 50 metres long, but
to any segment of the bridge, with length x measured outwards from the centre of the
span. Then, in the equation for T0 above, the length 25 metres is replaced by 1

weight 100 tonnes becomes 2x, pro rata with segment length, and the height 20 metres

Centres of gravity
7.1
Using symmetry
In the examples of Chapter 6, we have assumed that the weights of objects like a straw
bale or ladder act at centres of gravity which we take to be at their geometric centres.
For rods and rectangles, cubes and circles, and many other shapes, the centre of gravity
is obvious from the symmetry. Where they apply, arguments from symmetry are very
pleasing and economical.
Example 7.1
Mr B, constructing a shop sign, wishes to determine the centres of gravity of large letters
F, I, S, H, cut out from rectangular sheets of uniform density. He concludes that, because
of symmetry, the centres of gravity for the letters I, S, H, must lie at the centre of their
respective rectangles.

7.2
Archimedes’ calculations
Archimedes devised elegant geometrical arguments to ﬁnd the centre of gravity of other
shapes – the cone, the hemisphere, and the parabolic section – where symmetry alone is
not suﬃcient. Example 7.2 shows how he calculates the centre of gravity of a uniform
triangle (technically called a triangular lamina, after the Latin word for a sheet).

Suppose the triangle is ABC. We may imagine it divided into a large number of thin strips,
parallel to BC. Each of these strips is, approximately, a rectangle (though Archimedes’

gravity will all lie on the median AD, the line joining the vertex A to the mid-point D of
the opposite side BC. Their combined centre of gravity, therefore, which is the centre of
gravity G of the whole triangle, will also lie on AD. By a similar argument, considering
strips parallel to AC or AB, G lies also on the medians through B and C, and therefore
at their common point of intersection, called the centroid.
!
"!
#!
$!
From Euclid’s geometry, or by a simple vector calculation, it is known that the centroid
divides each of the medians in a ratio 2 : 1, so that the height of the centre of gravity
above the base of the triangle is one third of the height of the triangle.

Combining shapes
Centres of gravity for more complex shapes can be found by dividing them into two or
more simpler shapes with known centres of gravity, and if necessary applying a calculation
based on the principle of the lever.
Example 7.3
A dart is made from a square piece of paper, 24 cm×24 cm. As a ﬁrst step, corners A and
B of the square are folded over to meet at the centre C. Where is the centre of gravity G
of the folded sheet?

From the symmetry, the centre of gravity will lie on the centreline of the paper, OC, so
it is only necessary to calculate the distance of G from AB. Once the paper has been
folded, we can look at it as made up of two parts, one being the rectangle DEFH, and
the other the double-thickness triangle ODE. The centre of the rectangle is 18 cm from
O and the centre of gravity of the triangle is 2/3 × 12 = 8 cm from O. The masses of
the rectangle and of the triangle are equal, both being one half the mass of the unfolded
sheet, and so their combined centre of gravity is at the mid-point, 13 cm from O.
Example 7.4
Mr B, constructing a shop sign, wishes to determine the centres of gravity of large letters
F, I, S, H, cut out from rectangular sheets of uniform density. He has concluded that,
because of symmetry, the centres of gravity for the letters I, S, H, must lie at the centre
of their respective rectangles. But where is the centre of gravity for F?

consisting of three parts, a stem, measuring 5 units high by 1 unit wide, a top branch,
1 unit by 3 units, and the lower branch, 1 unit by 2 units. These parts are all rectangular,
and we know therefore their centres of gravity. To calculate ¯x, the rule is that the whole
mass of the letter, which is 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 mass units, when placed at a distance ¯x
from a knife-edge fulcrum running along the y-axis, should have the same turning eﬀect
about the axis as the separate masses of the component parts, located at their individual
centres of gravity. The co-ordinate ¯y is similarly found by consideration of the turning
moments about the x-axis.
A good way to set out this type of centre of gravity calculation is to make a table. Here,
we will have four columns, three for each of the component parts of the “F” and one
for the whole letter. Apart from the labels, the ﬁrst row contains the masses “m” of
the various parts, which in this case are pro rata with their areas. The second row “x”
contains the co-ordinates of the centres of gravity. For the component parts these are
known values, and for the whole letter F we write ¯x. Finally the third row is the product
“mx” of the ﬁrst row and the second – eﬀectively the turning moment about the y-axis.

so that ¯x = 1.4 units. By a similar calculation, ¯y = 3.1 units.
7.4
Hanging from a ﬁxed point
When a rigid body hangs freely from a ﬁxed point, the centre of gravity will lie directly
beneath the point of suspension.

A uniform rectangle ABCD is cut out of a sheet of metal. AB = 40 cm and BC = 20 cm.
The rectangle is suspended by a thread which is attached at a point X on AB such that
AX = 30 cm. When the rectangle hangs in equilibrium, what is the angle between AB
and the vertical?
Here we are invited to ﬁnd the angle which AB makes with the known vertical XG. In

When the letter hangs freely, the centre of gravity G lies below the point of suspension,
and in the diagram the ‘as is’ vertical GT is superimposed on the letter F in its conven-
tional upright form. If XG is drawn from G perpendicular to OT, the angle between OT
and GT can be determined from the geometry of the triangle GTX. Here, using the re-
sults of Example 7.4, XG = ¯x = 1.4 units, TX = 5−¯y = 1.9 units. If, as drawn above, the
units are in fact square (rather than the more general case of rectangular units) so that
one x-unit is equivalent to one y-unit, the required angle GTX is arctan(14/19) = 36◦.

 P 
Imagine a tea cup, hanging from a peg P. The handle has a circular proﬁle with a centre at
C. The weight of the cup acts at the centre of gravity G, which must lie vertically below
the point of support at the peg. Equilibrium is maintained by an equal and opposite
vertical reaction at the peg. If the peg is smooth (no friction), this reaction must be
perpendicular to the curve of the handle and its line of action must pass through the
centre of curvature at C. The radius CP is therefore vertical and the cup must hang so
that P, C and G are all in the same vertical line.
By visualising a circle, centred at G, which passes through P, we see that the cup must
slide on the peg until in its resting position GP is a maximum, so that G is as far below
P as possible.

In the diagram, C is at the centre of the cup, in the plane of its rim. G is the geometric

is in line with the shaft of the peg. At the limiting angle, the vertical line down from G
passes just within the rim at R. The required angle, therefore, is the angle CGR. CR is
perpendicular to CG, and angle CGR = arcsin(CR/GR) = arcsin(5/21) = 14◦.

Momentum

Momentum
8.1
Momentum
In ordinary language, momentum is what makes a moving object hard to stop. The more
massive the object, and the greater its speed, the larger is its momentum. For a mass m,
travelling with velocity v, the momentum is given by the simple formula mv. Since mass
is measured in kg, and velocity in m/s, the unit of momentum is kg m s−1. Alternatively
– we shall see why in Section 8.4 – the equivalent form N s, standing for newton-seconds,
is used.
8.2
Conservation of momentum
The formula, momentum equals mv, does more than just introduce another a piece of
terminology. Momentum, so deﬁned, obeys a far-reaching law, the law of conservation of
momentum.
To illustrate, consider two astronauts, ﬂoating in space, facing each other, and both
having zero velocity. A has mass 100 kg and B has mass 80 kg. A now pushes B, exerting
a force of 20 newtons for a period of 1 second. According to Newton’s second law, B now
accelerates away from A, the acceleration being a = F/m = 20/80 = 0.25 m/s2. After
1 second, B has velocity 0.25 × 1 = 0.25 m/s and his momentum is 80 × 0.25 = 20 N s.
         A                                                                 B 
       100 kg                                                          80 kg 
     0.2 m/s                                                           0.25 m/s 
According to Newton’s third law, A, while pushing B, is himself subject to a reaction force
of 20 newtons in the opposite direction. His acceleration is a = −20/100 = −0.20 m/s2,
where the minus sign indicates that the acceleration is in the opposite direction to B’s.
After 1 second, A has velocity −0.20 m/s and his momentum is 100 × −0.20 = −20 N s.
In the absence of any other forces, A and B will now continue to drift apart, but their
total momentum will remain zero, just as it was initially, when both had zero velocity.
The general principle is that the total momentum of any isolated system, not subject
to any external forces, remains constant. This is the law of conservation of momentum

Momentum
(LOCOM). The internal forces in the system may be as complex as you would care to
imagine – astronaut A may push B again, or throw things at him, or throw him a line and
pull him back in – but, so long as there are no forces from outside, the total momentum
is unchanged.
8.3
Collisions and explosions
In actuality, the universe functions as a whole. Truly isolated systems, for which mo-
mentum is exactly conserved, are hard to ﬁnd. But some situations can be regarded as
nearly isolated, for the purposes of calculation. In a collision, for example, when car A
hits bus B, the forces of A and B on each other during the brief duration of the actual
impact are much larger than the external forces such as frictional forces from the road
surface.
Likewise, when a Bonﬁre Night rocket reaches the apex of its ﬂight, to burst into a cluster
of stars, the cluster at ﬁrst radiates symmetrically, and the individual momenta of the
separate parts total to the momentum of the rocket just before it exploded. Over a longer
time scale the eﬀects of the external force of gravity come into play and the cluster moves
predominantly downwards, losing its initial symmetry.
In a collision, then, or an explosion, the total momentum immediately after the impact or
explosion can be assumed equal to the total momentum just beforehand. If two colliding
masses m1 and m2 have velocities u1 and u2 before impact, and v1 and v2 afterwards, the
law of conservation of momentum takes the easy-to-remember form
m1u1 + m2u2 = m1v1 + m2v2 .
(8.1)
Example 8.1
Particle A, mass 1 kg, and travelling at 5 m/s, collides head-on with particle B, mass 2 kg
which is at rest. After the collision B moves away at 3 m/s. What is the velocity of A?

Momentum
“m1u1 + m2u2 = m1v1 + m2v2”
⇒(1 × 5) + (2 × 0) = (1 × v) + (2 × 3)
⇒v = −1 .
The speed of A after the collision is therefore 1 m/s. The minus sign indicates that its
direction of motion has been reversed. The mathematician understands a velocity of
−1 m/s, travelling to the right, to mean 1 m/s, travelling to the left.
Example 8.2
A railway truck A, travelling at speed 6 m/s, collides with a similar truck B. After the
collision the two trucks couple together and move oﬀbefore hitting a third truck C.
Finally, the three trucks move oﬀtogether down the track. What is their common speed?
We do not know the mass of the trucks, but if they all have the same mass we can suppose
that this is M. Then the principle “momentum before equals momentum after” can be
expressed as
(M × 6) + 0 + 0 = (3M) × v .
The factor M cancels and v, the ﬁnal speed which was to be determined, comes out at
2 m/s.
Notice that we need not be concerned, unless we are interested, with the details of the
intermediate state when A has hit B but C is still at rest. The conservation law allows us
to link directly the initial and the ﬁnal states, by-passing whatever happens in between.
This can greatly simplify the calculation.

Momentum
8.4
Impulse
An impulse is what sets an object moving, giving it momentum. In the same way, an
impulse, acting on a body of mass m which is already moving, can produce a change in
momentum. So the formula for impulse I is
I = mv −mu ,
(8.2)
where u is the initial velocity and v is the ﬁnal velocity of the mass m.
There is also a second formula for impulse which refers more directly to the impelling
force, rather than the impelled object. Suppose that the body is accelerated from initial
speed u to ﬁnal speed v in a time t seconds. If the acceleration a is presumed constant,
then
v = u + at .
Our ﬁrst formula for impulse, I = mv −mu, is equivalent to
I = m(u + at) −mu = mat .
From Newton’s second law, F = ma, so that the alternative formula for impulse is
I = Ft .
(8.3)
Since force F is measured in newtons, and duration t in seconds, the formula shows how
it is that impulse and momentum can be expressed in units of N s, as well as kg m s−1.

Momentum
The impulses on A and B are equal in magnitude but in opposite directions. This is
a consequence of Newton’s third law. Although the calculation for A gives a negative
answer, we would often just state its magnitude. It is after all fairly obvious that when A,
travelling to the right in what we have chosen to call the positive direction, runs into the
obstacle which is particle B, it will receive an impulse in the reverse direction, towards
the left.
Example 8.4
Mr C of mass 60 kg dives oﬀa stationary boat of mass 150 kg. If he pushes oﬀwith a
horizontal impulse of 90 N s, what is his forward speed on hitting the water?
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
From Newton’s third law, Mr C exerts an impulse of 90 N s on the boat and the boat must
exert an equal and opposite impulse 90 N s on Mr C. If Mr C acquires a forward speed
V m/s, his gain in momentum, from an initially stationary position, will be 60V N s
and this must equal the impulse exerted by the boat of 90 N s. So V = 1.5 m/s. The
boat, of mass 150 kg, will meanwhile be pushed in the opposite direction with speed
90/150 = 0.6 m/s.

Momentum
Example 8.5
A hose 2 cm in diameter delivers 75 litres of water per minute. If the water jet is directed
perpendicularly against a wall, calculate the force exerted.
75 litres of water per minute is equivalent to a ﬂow of 1.25 litres per second, or 1.25 ×
10−3 cubic metres per second, or, in terms of mass, M = 1.25 kg per second as the
density of water is ρH2O ≈1000 kg m−3. If the water ﬂow speed is V m/s, the volume
of water discharged in one second is equivalent to a cylinder of length V metres and
cross-sectional area π × 0.012 sq. m, so that
ﬂow rate = V × π × 0.012 = 1.25 × 10−3 ,
and V ≈4 m/s. Consider now a time interval of one second, during which the momentum
lost by the water hitting the wall is
mass × change in velocity = MV = 1.25 × V = 5 N s .
This must be equal to the backwards impulse I = Ft exerted on the water in the 1 second
time interval, which by Newton’s third law is equal and opposite to the impulse experi-
enced by the wall. Since t = 1, the force F on the wall comes out as 5 newtons.
8.5
Duration of impact
In practice, it may be hard to determine the precise duration of impact when a ball hits
the ﬂoor or a car hits a tree. However, in the formula I = Ft, it is the product of force
and duration which matters, not their individual magnitudes. The eﬀect of a force F
acting for a time t is the same as that of a force 2F acting for a time 1
2t. The impulse
I summarizes the total eﬀect of the impact, regardless of the uncertainties about its
duration.
Example 8.6
Mr B playing tennis receives Mr C’s service travelling at 30 m/s and returns the ball (mass
58 g) at a speed of 25 m/s. Calculate the impulse received by the ball. If the ball is in
contact with the strings of B’s racket for a period estimated as 6 ms, calculate also the
average force applied to it in this time interval.
Using the formula I = mv −mu
I = 0.058 × (25 −(−30)) = 3.19 N s .
Using I = Ft
I = 3.19 = F × 0.006
⇒F
= 531.7 N .

Momentum
The impulse on the ball is therefore 3.2 N s and the average force applied to the ball is
about 530 N (the precision of the data for this question does not justify giving answers
to more than 2 signiﬁcant ﬁgures).
8.6
Coeﬃcient of restitution
Newton studied collisions using a device which has come to be known as his ‘cradle’.
!
Balls of diﬀerent sizes and mass could be drawn aside and released from diﬀerent positions,
so allowing a range of diﬀerent impacts to be observed, while velocities after impact could
be inferred by observing the height to which the balls rebounded.
As well as conﬁrming the conservation of momentum in the collisions, Newton discovered
another relationship linking the velocities before and after impact.
Over a range of
diﬀerent speeds of impact, the relative velocity of the balls, just after impact, was – to a
close level of approximation – proportional to the relative velocity just prior to impact.
That is to say
separation speed = e × approach speed ,
(8.4)
where e, called the coeﬃcient of restitution, is a constant which remains the same for all
collisions between the same two bodies. Newton experimented with a range of diﬀerent
materials, ﬁnding values of e close to 1 for hard materials like glass or steel, and lesser
values with cork or compressed wool.
The same rule is found to apply to the impact of a ball with a rigid surface, such as a
ﬂoor or a wall. In this case, clearly, the speeds of the ball before and after impact are
one and the same with the speeds relative to the ﬁxed ﬂoor.

In Example 8.1 above, particle A collides at speed 5 m/s with a stationary particle B,
rebounding with speed 1 m/s, while B moves oﬀwith speed 3 m/s in the direction of A’s

The approach speed in this collision is 5 m/s, while the separation speed is (3+1) = 4 m/s.
For A and B, therefore, e = 4/5.

Momentum
We suppose the mass of the balls is m, and call the unknown velocities of C and D after
impact v m/s and w m/s respectively. To ﬁnd v and w, two equations are available, the
momentum equation
0.5m = mv + mw ,
and the equation for the coeﬃcient of restitution
0.5e = 0.48 = w −v .
Cancelling the factor m in the momentum equation, and solving simultaneously, shows
that after impact the cue ball C has velocity 0.01 m/s, while the object ball D moves oﬀ
with velocity 0.49 m/s.
Collisions in the special case when e = 1 are called perfectly elastic. For our snooker
balls, the solution with e = 1 is v = 0 m/s, w = 0.5 m/s. Collisions between snooker balls
are indeed nearly perfectly elastic, and after a head-on impact, the object ball carries
oﬀmost of the momentum while the cue ball is almost brought to rest, as is commonly
observed. More comprehensive calculations would need to take into account any spin
imparted to the cue ball and also the brief period of skidding by which the rolling motion
of the balls adjusts, after impact, to the changes in translational speed.
Example 8.9
The speciﬁcation for Wimbledon tennis balls requires that a ball dropped from a height
of 100 inches (254 cm) onto a concrete surface should rebound to a height of not less than
53 inches and not more than 58 inches. Deduce the equivalent limits on the coeﬃcient of
restitution.
From the constant acceleration formula v2 = u2+2as, the impact speed of a ball dropped
from a height H is v = √2gH. This is the approach speed. Likewise, if it rebounds to
a height h, the speed at which it leaves the ground is √2gh, and this is the separation
speed. The coeﬃcient of restitution is therefore the ratio √2gh : √2gH, or e =

h/H,
and lies between limits

53/100 and

58/100, or 0.73 and 0.76.
Example 8.10
A tennis ball is dropped from a height of 2.5 metres on to a level surface and bounces
repeatedly until it comes to rest. The coeﬃcient of restitution is e = 0.75. For how long
does the bouncing motion continue?
The time taken to reach the ﬂoor for the ﬁrst time can be found from the formula
s = ut + 1
2at2. With s = 2.5, u = 0, a = 9.8, we ﬁnd that t1 = 5/7 seconds.
Compared with the original drop height, the second bounce is lower by a factor e2 = 9/16,
and the time of ﬂight is reduced by a factor e = 3/4. The additional time taken to reach
the ﬂoor for the second time, allowing for both the upward and the downward journeys,
is t2 = 2 × (3/4) × (5/7). The time for the third bounce is similarly reduced by a further

Oblique impacts
Example 8.11
A snooker cue ball, travelling at speed 0.5 m/s, makes an oblique impact with a stationary
object (target) ball of equal mass m. After impact, the cue ball is deﬂected through an
angle of 30◦while the object ball moves away at an angle of 60◦from the original line of
the cue ball. Find (a) the speeds v and w of the balls after impact and (b) the coeﬃcient
of restitution.

After the impact, the components of velocity along the original line of motion of the cue
ball are v cos(30◦) =

Conservation of momentum along this line gives

But momentum is also conserved in the transverse direction. If the object ball goes to the

At the moment of contact, the two balls touch on their common tangent plane and the
cue ball exerts an impulse on the object ball perpendicular to this plane, along the line
joining their centres. For the coeﬃcient of restitution, we calculate approach speed and
separation speed using velocity components in this same direction. Here, the cue ball
travels towards the object ball with speed 0.5 m/s at an angle of 60◦to the line of centres,
giving an approach speed of 0.5 cos(60◦) = 0.25 m/s. After impact, the cue ball is moving
perpendicular to the line of centres so that the separation speed is simply the speed of
the object ball, w = 0.25 m/s. So
e = separation speed
approach speed
= 0.25
0.25 = 1 .
The collision is therefore perfectly elastic. This example illustrates a general rule, appli-
cable to ideal, perfectly elastic snooker ball collisions, that after impact the cue ball and
object ball move oﬀat right angles to each other. A more general calculation shows that
the 90◦angle is a maximum value – if the coeﬃcient of restitution is less than unity, the
angle between the two velocities is always less than 90◦.

If the surface is smooth and so without friction, there are no horizontal forces acting on the
ball, even during impact. Its horizontal momentum and horizontal velocity component
remain unchanged. If the speed just before impact is U, and just after impact is V ,
V cos θ = U cos(30◦).
Considering the vertical motion, the approach speed and separation speed for the impact
are deﬁned in relation to the plane of contact, in this case the ground surface itself. The
approach speed is the downward component of the incoming speed U, U sin(30◦). The
separation speed is the upward component of the outgoing speed V , V sin θ. By Newton’s
law of restitution, V sin θ = e×U sin(30◦) = 0.75×U sin(30◦). From the velocity triangle,
tan θ = 0.75 tan(30◦), and we ﬁnd θ = 23◦, independently of the initial speed U.

Potential energy and kinetic energy
Imagine, said Galileo, that this page represents a vertical wall, with a nail driven into it
at A, and from the nail let there be suspended a lead bullet by means of a ﬁne vertical
thread AB, say four to six feet long. On the wall let us draw a horizontal line CD at
right angles to the vertical thread AB, which hangs about two ﬁnger breadths in front of
the wall.
A 
"!
C 
!#!
Then, if the thread is drawn aside till the bullet is in position C, and then released, it will
descend along the arc CB, passing B, and rise again until it almost reaches the horizontal
CD, any slight shortfall being caused by the resistance of the air or of the ﬁxing of the
string at A.
Again, suppose another nail is driven into the wall close to the vertical AB, say at E,
but protruding about ﬁve or six ﬁnger breadths so that the thread catches on it when
released from C. Now the bullet, having reached B, will continue upwards on an arc BF,
centred at E, and again will reach or very nearly reach the horizontal CD.

Depending on the position of the nail E, the ﬁnal position F will vary, but – so long as
E is not so far below CD that the string winds itself round and round the nail – F will
always lie on the horizontal CD. In modern terminology, we would say that this constancy
reﬂects the fact that all positions along the horizontal CD have the same gravitational
potential energy, relative to the low point at B. The term potential energy conveys the
idea of a store of energy, not actually visible but available for use, as when the bullet is
held to one side at C, but is not yet released, or when it rises again to D before swinging

back again. The formula for the potential energy of a particle of mass m at a height h
above a chosen baseline level, is
Potential energy = mgh ,
(9.1)
where g is the acceleration due to gravity.
By contrast, kinetic energy is energy which shows directly in the motion of a particle, as
when the bullet traverses the arcs CBD or CBF. The kinetic energy of a particle of mass
m, travelling at speed v, is given by the formula
Kinetic energy =
1
2mv2 .
(9.2)
Both potential energy and kinetic energy are measured in units of joules, abbreviated as
J.
9.2
Conservation of mechanical energy
Galileo’s example shows how the potential energy before the motion starts is the same as
the potential energy after it is complete. The principle of the conservation of energy goes
further to say that the total energy remains constant throughout. The same quantity
of energy, existing ﬁrst as potential energy, is transformed into kinetic energy before
returning once again to potential energy.
Strictly, we are speaking here of the conservation of mechanical energy, which applies,
as Galileo noted, only when dissipative forces such as friction or air resistance can be
ignored.
Often, energy will appear to be lost.
Even so, like the horizontal line CD
in Galileo’s illustration, the conservation principle sets a limit to the possible range of
motion.
Example 9.1
A stone of mass m falls from rest through a distance h, hitting the ground with speed v.
Show how the principle of the conservation of mechanical energy applies in this case.
To ﬁnd the speed v at impact, apply the constant acceleration formula, v2 = u2 + 2as,
with u = 0, since the stone falls from rest, s = h, and a = g, the acceleration due to
gravity. Then
v2 = 0 + 2gh ,
or multiplying both sides by 1
2m,
1
2mv2 = mgh .
The kinetic energy gained during the descent, if air resistance is neglected, is equal to
the potential energy lost, so that the total mechanical energy remains the same.

Energy
Example 9.2
Starting from rest, a mass m slides down a smooth slope through a vertical distance h.
Show again that in the absence of friction the total mechanical energy is conserved.
Suppose ﬁrst that the slope has a uniform gradient inclined at an angle α to the horizontal.
Then the acceleration down the slope will be g sin α and the slant distance travelled to
the bottom will be h/ sin α. To ﬁnd the speed v at the bottom of the slope, apply the
constant acceleration formula, v2 = u2 + 2as, with u = 0, s = h/ sin α, and a = g sin α.
Then
v2 = 0 + 2g sin α
h
sin α .
The factors of sin α cancel and the ﬁnal kinetic energy 1
2mv2 is, as in Example 9.1, equal
to the initial potential energy mgh.
Notice that this conclusion is independent of the angle α. It applies therefore, to a slope
of any angle, or to a slope comprising two sections with diﬀerent angles, but still falling
through a total vertical distance h, or indeed to any slope, following any proﬁle, whether
curved or linear.

Example 9.3
Usually, mechanical energy is lost during a collision. When a drop of water splashes on
a hard surface, energy is lost to the viscous and surface tension forces in the drop, and
when car A hits bus B, energy is consumed in deforming the bodywork.
Elastic collisions are a special case. These are collisions in which the coeﬃcient of resti-
tution e is equal to unity. A ball bouncing on a hard surface with e = 1 would rebound
with its original speed and kinetic energy, and rise again to the height from which it was
dropped.
In Chapter 8 we looked at the example of an oblique collision between ideal perfectly
elastic snooker balls, with speeds before and after impact as shown in Figure 9.2.

The work-energy principle
Usually, the system we have to study interacts with its environment.
Energy losses,
arising from friction or air resistance, or energy inputs, as from the engine of a car,
will also need to be accounted for. The examples we have considered so far, where an
independent energy balance is maintained, are approximate models or special cases.
The contribution of a force to the energy budget of a system is expressed by the concept
of ‘work’. The work done by a force F moving through a distance d is deﬁned as the
product F × d. This is an intuitively reasonable deﬁnition. A greater force and a greater
distance both imply greater expenditure of eﬀort. If we carry a mass of 10 kg up a ﬂight

of stairs which rises through a vertical distance of 3 metres, the force which has to be
applied is equal to the weight 10g = 98 newtons, and the work done is 98 × 3 = 294 J,
equal to the increase in potential energy of the mass.
Notice here that the horizontal distance travelled while going up the stairs does not enter
into the calculation of the work done. It is a vertical force F which is required to lift the
weight, and the distance d is measured in the same direction.
In the case of an energy loss, as opposed to an energy input, the applied force F is in the
opposite direction to the distance d. The air resistance force on a car, for example, is in
the opposite direction to the motion of the car.
Example 9.4
Estimate the force applied to a cricket ball when it is thrown a distance of 50 metres.
If the throw covers the 50 m distance as a full toss, its initial velocity energy can be
estimated from the formula V 2/g for the horizontal range of a projectile: V 2 = 50g =
490 m/s. With a mass of 160 grams, the kinetic energy comes out as 1
2×0.16×490 = 39.2 J.
(Notice we need not waste eﬀort with a square root operation to ﬁnd V , when it is V 2
which we really want in order to ﬁnd the kinetic energy). If the propulsive force F is
applied over a distance of one metre, while the ball is in the throwers hand, F ×1 = 39.2,
and the applied force must be about 40 newtons.

Example 9.5
A dart of mass 25 grams is thrown at a dartboard with speed 10 m/s. On impact, the
spike penetrates a distance 1 cm into the board. Estimate the resistance force experienced
by the dart.
Suppose that the resistance force is constant and equal to R newtons. The work done by
R against the dart is R × 0.01 J which must be equal to its loss of kinetic energy, which
is 1
2 × 0.025 × 102 J. Hence R = 125 newtons.

Power
Power is the rate of doing work. The power output P of an engine which delivers W
joules of work in a time t is
P = W
t .
(9.3)
There is also an alternative formula which may be found by remembering that the work
done W is equal to F × d. Then
P
= W
t
= F × d
t
= F × d
t
= F × v ,
(9.4)
since speed v equals distance divided by time.
Power is measured in units of watts. The units of power and energy, the watt and the
joule, are named respectively after James Watt (1736 – 1819), the inventor of the steam
engine, and James Joule (1818 – 1889). Joule demonstrated the equivalence of mechanical
energy and heat in an experiment in which the potential energy of a falling weight was
transformed into the kinetic energy of a set of paddles in a water tank and ﬁnally into
the heat energy of the water. The story goes that later, while on honeymoon, he sought
to conﬁrm this result by measuring the temperature diﬀerence between the water at the
top and bottom of a high waterfall in the Alps.

Example 9.6
A sparrow generating a power output of 1 watt ﬂies at a speed of 10 m/s. What is the
propulsive force which it is exerting?
With a power output of 1 watt, the propulsive force exerted by the sparrow must be
F = P/v = 0.1 newtons.
Example 9.7
A cyclist in the Tour de France climbs steadily up a gradient of 1 in 10. If the combined
mass of the cyclist and his cycle is 70 kg, and his power output is 300 watts, calculate his
speed.

√
101
Suppose the speed of the cyclist is V . In each second, the distance travelled up the slope is
V metres, corresponding (by Pythagoras’ theorem) to a gain in height of V/
√
101 metres.
The resulting gain in potential energy may be equated to the work done by the cyclist in
the same one second interval. Thus
300 × 1 = 70 × 9.8 ×

⇒V
= 4.4 m/s .
At this relatively low speed, it is a reasonably good approximation to omit the eﬀects of
air resistance.
Example 9.8
Mr A in his limousine, total mass 2000 kg, is cruising at a steady speed of 20 m/s. The
power output from the engine is 5 kW. He now puts his foot on the accelerator, increasing
the power to 15 kW. What is the acceleration of the car?
At a power output of 5 kW, the tractive force exerted by the engine is P/v = 5000/20 =
250 newtons, and since the speed is constant, the resistance forces must also be of the
same magnitude 250 newtons.
When Mr A puts his foot on the accelerator, the tractive force from the engine increases
to 15000/20 = 750 newtons, and, allowing for the resistance forces, the resultant forward
force on the car is 750 −250 = 500 newtons. By Newton’s second law, therefore, the
acceleration of the car is 0.25 m/s2.

Example 9.9
The maximum power output of Mr A’s engine is 100 kW. If the total resistance force
when travelling at speed V is 0.625V 2, what is the maximum speed achievable on a level

At maximum speed, the tractive force from the engine must match the resistance force.
P
V = 105V = 0.625V 2 .
So V 3 = 160,000 and V = 54 m/s, or 194 km/hr.

Circular motion
10.1
Centripetal acceleration
Consider a particle moving in a circle at constant speed. It is not in equilibrium, for this
implies a state of rest, or motion in a straight line. But, if the speed is constant, in what
sense is there an acceleration?
To resolve the paradox, we have to remember that acceleration is the rate of change of
velocity and that velocity is a vector quantity, possessing both magnitude and direction.
And though the speed remains constant, the direction is continuously changing, turning
inwards away from the straight line direction along the tangent.
Because there is a change in direction towards the centre of the circle, there is what is
called a centripetal acceleration, or literally a centre-seeking acceleration.
To calculate the acceleration, Newton visualised the particle moving at speed v on a
many-sided path ABC . . . within a circular wall, radius r, undergoing a series of glancing
impacts.

Z

C
Figure 10.1: Motion in a circle showing the changing direction of the velocity (left) and
Newton’s many-sided path visualisation of the problem (right).
For example, at A, the component of velocity along the tangent is unchanged, but the
particle receives an impulse to the right, towards the centre of the circle. As the particle
moves round the path ABC. . . ZA, receiving successive impacts, its velocity vector rotates.
To show this, we can draw a vector diagram with the velocities in the segments AB, BC,
shown as arrows of constant length v with their tails anchored at a common origin.
The changes in velocity at A, B, . . . resulting from the impulses at A, B, . . . can now be
represented by vectors ∆vA, ∆vB, . . . as shown in Figure 10.2.
When the path ABC. . . ZA has a large number of sides N, its total length is very close to
the circumference 2πr of the surrounding circle. The time taken for a complete circuit,

travelling at speed v, is 2πr/v, and the time taken to traverse each side is ∆t = 2πr/Nv.
Likewise the changes ∆v at successive vertices A, B, . . . are approximated by arcs of
the circumference of a circle, radius v, in the velocity diagram, and these are each of
magnitude 2πv/N. The magnitude of the acceleration, therefore, is
a = ∆v

(10.1)
and its direction is always towards the centre of the circle.
10.2
Motion in a horizontal circle
The implication of the centripetal acceleration formula is that when a body moves in a
circle, it is because some force constrains it to do so. We see this in the tension in the
string when a boy whirls a conker above his head, or the tension in the wire when a
hammer thrower prepares to throw in an athletics competition.
Example 10.1
A car negotiates a bend in the road with a radius of curvature of 50 metres. If the road
is level, and the coeﬃcient of friction between the tyres and the road is µ = 0.8, what is
the maximum safe speed?
Suppose the car has mass M and the maximum safe speed is V . What holds the car to
the curve of the road, or, more exactly, keeps the car accelerating inwards towards the
centre point of the curve, is the frictional force from the surface. The maximum speed is
reached when the frictional force Ff attains its limiting value µMg. By Newton’s second

law, therefore
F
= Ma
⇒Ff = µMg = “mv2/r”
= MV 2/50 ,
giving V = √50 × 0.8 × 9.8 =
√
392 = 19.8 m/s. The occupants of the car, especially any
passengers on the rear seat, will perhaps ﬁnd themselves sliding towards the outside of
the bend, a phenomenon which is often ascribed to ‘centrifugal force’. This is a somewhat
misleading term, however, in that there is no real force impelling them outwards, but only
the natural tendency of their bodies to persist in the original line of motion of the car.
“Centrifugal force” is an illusion, originating with the unfounded assumption that our
bodies will follow round the corner purely in obedience to the intentions of the driver. A
similar situation operates in straight line motion when the driver brakes suddenly. Then,
the occupants in the car, continuing with their previous motion, appear to be thrown
forward, relative to the car.

Circular motion
Example 10.2
Mr C, mass 60 kg, turns a corner on his bicycle, mass 5 kg, in an arc of radius 20 m. If he
is travelling at 5 m/s, what is the angle at which he will need to ‘lean in’ to the curve?
!!!!"!

G 
The principle here is essentially the same as in Example 10.1, but Mr C needs to be
considered as a rigid body. A simple particle cannot ‘lean’ one way or the other. There
are three forces acting which need to be taken into account. The weight of Mr C and his
cycle, Mg = 65 × 9.8 = 637 newtons, acts downwards through their combined centre of
gravity. The upward reaction from the ground N, also 637 newtons in magnitude, acts
upwards through P, the point of contact of the tyres with the ground. The third force is
the frictional force Ff, acting horizontally through the point of contact with the ground.
The frictional force Ff keeps Mr C accelerating towards the centre of his curved path.
From Newton’s second law
Ff = Mv2
r

= 81.25 newtons .
If Mr C is to remain stable, the turning moments of the forces about the centre of gravity
G must cancel.

so that

and θ = 7◦. Notice that the distance GP cancels out from the ﬁnal answer, as also would
the mass M, if we had left it in algebraic form.

Circular motion
Example 10.3
In a conical pendulum the bob goes round and round in a circle rather than to-and-fro. It
is called a ‘conical’ pendulum because the motion of the string, following the bob, traces
out the surface of a cone. Just like a standard pendulum, it provides a measure of time.
Suppose that one end of the string is ﬁxed to a point O while the other end is attached
to the bob B which moves in a horizontal circle with its centre a distance h below O.
What is the time taken for B to complete one circuit?
h
O
B
Eventually, as we will see, the formula for the period of the motion t will only involve
the variable h and the acceleration due to gravity g. But we need to label a few more
quantities to develop the intermediate working. Suppose that the mass of the bob is m,
the tension in the string is T, and the inclination of the string to the vertical is θ. Then
the bob moves in a circle of radius R = h tan θ with speed V = 2πR/t.
Resolving forces vertically gives
T cos θ = mg .

Motion in a vertical circle
Similar principles apply to the analysis of motion in a vertical circle. The main diﬀerence
is that because there will be diﬀerences in gravitational potential energy at diﬀerent
positions on the circle, there will be diﬀerences in kinetic energy and the speed will
therefore vary.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Circular motion  
Suppose the car has mass M and is travelling at speed V . On a level road, the normal
reaction from the road surface on to the car is equal to its weight Mg, but on top of the
bridge it takes a lower value N. The diﬀerence Mg −N constitutes a net downward force
which ensures the car follows the proﬁle of the road, accelerating downwards towards the
centre of curvature. So
Mg −N = MV 2
40
.
In the limiting case, when the car is on the point of becoming airborne, N reduces to
zero, since clearly N must be zero once it is no longer in contact with the road. The
critical value of V therefore satisﬁes the equation
Mg = MV 2
40
,
so that
V
=

40g
= 19.8 m/s .
In fact, the car would be diﬃcult to handle even at lower speeds. The reduced normal
reaction would lead to a lower limiting frictional force and – as in Example 10.1 – a lesser
capability of negotiating any bend.
Example 10.5
A child of mass 30 kg on a playground swing moves through an arc extending for 30◦
either side of the vertical. The chains holding the swing are 2 metres long. What is the
tension in the chains at (a) the extreme points of the motion and (b) at the lowest point?

&"#'!#
At the extreme points of the arc, the speed is instantaneously zero, and the acceleration
radially, towards the centre of the childs circular arc, is shown by the v2/r formula to be
zero. Resolving forces in the radial direction, therefore

Circular motion
assuming that the swing is supported by two chains and that the tension in each is T.
We have also ignored the mass of the swing itself.
With these assumptions, we ﬁnd
T = 127 newtons.
At the lowest point of the motion the speed is greatest. If the eﬀects of air resistance
and the friction in the fastenings of the chain can be ignored, energy is conserved. The
gravitational potential energy at the high point of the motion is transformed into kinetic
energy at the low point. Then
Mgh = 30g(2 −2 cos(30◦)) = 1
2Mv2 ,
so that v2 = 5.25 m2/s2, v = 2.29 m/s.
Resolving forces radially again, therefore, at the low point
2T −Mg = M v2
r
⇒T
= 30 × 9.8 + 5.25/2

= 186 newtons .
(10.3)
We are here treating the child as a ‘particle’.
Strictly, the centre of gravity will be
slightly above the seat of the swing, and will move in a circle of radius slightly less than
the 2 metre value assumed. This will lead to a slighter larger value of T than the one we
have calculated.
10.4
The pendulum
The period of oscillation of a simple pendulum is independent of the amplitude of the
swing, so long as this is small compared with the length of the string. This was discovered
by Galileo while a student at Pisa, taking his inspiration from his observation of the
motion of a suspended lamp during Mass in the cathedral.
To investigate the motion of the pendulum, we look at the balance of kinetic and potential
energy as it moves in a circular arc from E to F around a centre point C.
Because of the geometry of the circle, there is a relationship between the distance CE
and the vertical height gained CM = H. The angle CET is a right angle (“angle in a
semi-circle”) and so the triangles TEC and EMC are similar. From their ratios
CE
CT = CM

is proportional to the amplitude of the swing X. If we halve the amplitude, we halve the
speed. This indeed suggests that the time required per oscillation remains constant even
when the amplitude changes. But the proof is not complete, because the speed varies
from point to point on the swing. To complete the demonstration we use the idea of
what is called the auxiliary circle.

Circular motion
Imagine a point Q moving in a circle in the x-y plane. We choose the radius of the circle
as X, the same as the amplitude of our pendulum oscillations, and suppose that Q moves
at a constant speed V = X

g/a equal to the maximum speed of the pendulum bob.
As Q moves round the circle, P∗, the foot of the perpendicular from Q to the x-axis,
moves backwards and forwards between the endpoints E and F. P∗is a kind of artiﬁcial
bob which mimics the motion of the real pendulum bob. We see that it has the same
amplitude of motion, ±X about its centre point at the origin, and the same maximum
speed V , attained when P∗is at the origin and Q crosses the y-axis.
It remains to verify that P∗has the correct speed at intermediate points.
From the
diagram, at a distance x from the origin, the speed of P is equal to the x-component of
the speed of Q, that is v = V cos(90◦−θ) = V sin θ = V ×(QP∗/OQ) = V

(X2 −x2)/X.
Remembering V = X

g/a, we have ﬁnally
v =

a(X2 −x2)

which is the same speed-distance formula as for the real pendulum bob P.
The period of oscillation is the time required for one complete cycle of the pendulum’s
motion – starting at the centre C, moving to the extreme point E, then in the reverse
direction to F, and ﬁnally back again to C. During this time the auxiliary bob completes
one circuit of the auxiliary circle, covering the circumferential distance 2πX at a speed
Vmax = X

independently of the amplitude X.
Example 10.6
A pendulum of length one metre swings through an angle of 5◦either side of its resting
position C to extreme points E and F. Calculate the time taken from C to reach (a)
maximum amplitude at E and (b) half amplitude at H, where H is the mid-point of CE
and (c) to arrive at H for the third time.
For a pendulum of length 1 metre, the period of small oscillations will be T = 2π

1/9.8 =
2.007 s, irrespective of their exact magnitude.
On the auxiliary circle, C1 corresponds to C on the pendulum arc. Likewise C2 and C3
correspond to H and E (see Figure 10.5).
Travelling from C to E with the pendulum corresponds to the quarter circle C1C2C3 on
the auxiliary circle, so the time needed is T/4 = 0.50 seconds.

Figure 10.5: The auxiliary circle for Example 10.6.
Travelling from C to H corresponds to an arc of angle θ on the auxiliary circle, where θ
is the angle DOC2. From the geometry, sin θ = DC2/OC2 = CH/OC3 = 1
2CE/CE = 1/2,
and θ = 30◦. The arc is therefore one twelfth of the complete circle and the time for the
pendulum to reach H from C is T/12 = 0.17 s.
The pendulum passes through H twice in one complete oscillation, once on the way out
to E and once on the way back. After one oscillation it reaches H for the third time after
a time interval T + T/12 = 2.17 s.

Gravitation and planetary motion
11.1
The Copernican model
Anyone who looks at the night sky for an hour or two will see that the stars and constel-
lations move as a single unit, wheeling around the Pole Star. The convincing appearance
is that the observer is at rest on a ﬁxed Earth while the heavens revolve, and this was
the picture of the universe accepted without question all through the Middle Ages. The
sphere of the ﬁxed stars was the outer limit of the universe while the earth was ﬁxed
at the centre. Between the two, the Sun, Moon and planets moved in their own orbits
against the background of the stars.
The planetary orbits were taken as circular, or to ﬁt more closely with observations,
made from epicycles, circles moving upon circles. It was thought that the mathematical
perfection of the circle could best reﬂect the divine intelligence of the celestial world, con-
trasting with the imperfections of worldly – literally mundane – life on earth. Practically,
it makes no diﬀerence to the observations, whether the Sun and planets revolve around
the Earth, or the planets, including the Earth, around the Sun. But it would have been
a bold man who proposed the Sun-centred system as an actual reality, for this would mix
the two worlds together, the celestial and the mundane. Most probably it was for this
reason that Copernicus waited almost until he was on his death-bed before publishing
his heliocentric model On the revolutions of the heavenly spheres in 1543.
Even with his new model Copernicus remained convinced that the revolutions of the
planets were based on circles. It was the young mathematician Johannes Kepler, working
in the 1590s with more accurate data, who found that the orbit of Mars just would not ﬁt
without an unreasonably large number of secondary circles. Driven on by the conviction
that the true picture must somehow show a divine simplicity, he was led to three laws of
planetary motion.
11.2
Kepler’s ﬁrst law
Kepler’s ﬁrst law says that the planets revolve in ellipses with the Sun at one focus.
To draw an ellipse, imagine two nails, ﬁxed six inches or a foot apart, and a string two or
three feet long tied to the nails at each end. Now hold a pen P against the string so that
it is stretched taut. As P moves within the constraining string, it traces out an ellipse.
The ellipse has two foci, F1 and F2, at the positions of the two nails, while its geometric
centre lies at O mid-way between them.
For most of the planets, including the Earth, the orbit does not diﬀer greatly from a circle.

Figure 11.2: Kepler’s second law: Equal areas are swept out in equal times.
If the planet takes equal times to move in its orbit from A to B and from P to Q, then the
areas ABS and PQS are equal. Newton showed that planetary motion following Kepler’s
second law was consistent with motion governed by a centripetal force acting towards S.
To argue this, he imagined the orbit divided into a series of small steps, AB, BC, CD
and so on.

Suppose that in one unit of time the planet moves from A to B, and the eﬀect of the cen-

to Newton’s ﬁrst law, the planet would, in the absence of any impulse, continue in the
next interval of time to c, covering a distance Bc = AB. The impulse at B, however, acting
along the line BS, acts to draw the orbit in to C, where cC is parallel to BS. Considering

Also ∆BcS = ∆BCS, since they have the same base and are drawn between the same
parallels BS, Cc. Therefore, ∆ABS = ∆BCS, which is to say that equal areas are swept
out in the two equal time steps. The same will apply to subsequent steps CD, DE, etc.,
and also to the larger areas which may be made by summing multiple time steps to make
larger intervals of time.

Kepler’s third law
Kepler’s third law is that the squares of the orbital times of the planets – their “years”
– vary as the cube of their mean distances from the Sun:
T 2 ∝R3 ,

where the precise constant of proportionality is unimportant for most purposes, but can
be shown to be 4π2/GM, where M is the mass of the body being orbited – the Sun in
the case of planetary orbits. Here G is Newton’s universal constant of gravitation; see
Section 11.5. Table 11.5 shows how closely Kepler’s data ﬁt.

Table 11.5: Kepler’s third law.
While Kepler’s second law shows that the force governing planetary motion is directed
towards the Sun, the third law tells us how it varies with distance. As we shall see, it
varies according to an inverse square law.
The planetary orbits are of course elliptical, but we can get a sense of how the third law
operates by looking at the special case of circular orbits. Then for a planet travelling at
speed V in an orbit of radius R, with an orbital period T

According to the third law, the square of the time T is proportional to the cube of the
distance R, so that acceleration = 4π2R/T 2 ∝4π2R/R3 ∝1/R2, conﬁrming the inverse
square relationship for the acceleration, and also for the force which is the product,

mass × acceleration. In this way, the pattern of the planetary orbits in time reveals the
variation of the centripetal force in space.
Example 11.3
Mars has two satellites, Phobos and Deimos, at mean distances of 9380 km and 23500 km
from Mars respectively. Find the orbital period for Deimos, given that Phobos completes
one revolution in 7.65 hours.
Kepler’s laws do not just apply to planetary motion, but to any body orbiting any other
body under the force of gravity. If T is the desired orbital time, then, by Kepler’s third
law, (23500/9380)3 = (T/7.65)2, hence T = 30.3 hours.
Example 11.4
Find the greatest distance of Halley’s comet from the Sun, given that its period is 76 years
and its distance of closest approach is 0.59 a.u.
From Kepler’s third law, by comparison with the Earth which has R = 1 a.u. and T =
1 year, the mean distance R for Halley’s comet satisﬁes (R/1)3 = (76/1)2, so that R =
17.94 a.u., giving a maximum distance of (2×17.94)−0.59 = 35.3 a.u., or 5280 million km.
Halley observed the comet in 1682, and found that its closest approach to the Sun was
very similar to that of comets that had been seen in 1607, 1531 and 1456. From this,
and the regular intervals between the sightings he concluded that these were all one and
the same comet – “It would be next to a miracle if they were three diﬀerent comets”.
He predicted its return, therefore, in 1758. By then, he would have been 102 years old
but he expressed the hope that, should the comet reappear, posterity would acknowledge
that it had been ﬁrst discovered by an Englishman.
11.5
Newton’s law of gravitation
The well-known story is that Newton conceived the idea of universal gravitation on seeing
an apple fall in his orchard, and imagining how, if unimpeded, it would continue to the
centre of the Earth. Whether true or not, the story conveys the insight that the familiar,
earthly force of gravity is one and the same with the force in the heavens which holds
the planets to their orbits.
Newton proposed then, a power of gravity pertaining to
all bodies, proportional to the quantity of matter which they contain. Combined with
the inverse square relationship with distance, this gives a formula for the gravitational
attraction F of two particles A and B, with masses M and m, separated by a distance r
F = GMm

Circular motion
In line with the third law of motion, the force F acts on both masses – if A attracts B,
B attracts A. The factor G is a universal constant, the same for all masses.
Now for the test. Are the motion of the Moon and the motion of the apple in the orchard
both correctly accounted for by the same value of G? For the Moon, and its revolution
around the Earth, we have as data
distance from Moon to Earth = dm = 384400 km
period of revolution = tm = 27.32 days = 2360 × 103 secs
orbital speed = vm = 1023 m/s
centripetal acceleration = v2
m
dm
= 0.00272 m/s2 .
Strictly, the Moon does not revolve around the Earth, but both revolve about their
common centre of gravity. To allow for this, Newton used the adjusted value
centripetal acceleration of Moon = 0.00269 m/s2 .

Circular motion
For the apple, the calculation is more complicated, which is one of the reasons for the long
interval between Newton’s original insight, in 1665 or 1666, and the eventual publication
of his Principia, in 1689. The total gravitational force on the apple is the sum total of
forces from all the diﬀerent parts of the Earth’s sphere, some of which are very close on
the ground beneath, others far away at the Antipodes. These all have their own value of
separation distance r in the formula for the gravitational attraction. Eventually, Newton
found that the result of an exact sum over the whole sphere still agrees with the formula
provided the whole mass of the Earth is treated as though located at its centre. So for
the apple
distance from apple to centre of Earth = radius of Earth = 6370 km
centripetal acceleration (observed value) = 9.81 m/s2 .
For consistency, then, the centripetal acceleration of the Moon, adjusted according to the
inverse square law for the diﬀerent distances from the centre of force, should match the
observed gravitational acceleration of the apple. So
calculated acceleration = 0.00269 ×

= 9.80 m/s2 ,
which as Newton said of his own calculation, “answers pretty nearly” to the familiar
value of g.
Example 11.5
To help convey the idea of how the Moon stays up, while at the same time continuously
falling down, Newton oﬀered the picture of a cannon, ﬁred horizontally from the top of
a high mountain. As the muzzle velocity increases, the range of the shot increases, until
ﬁnally at some very high velocity the cannonball goes right round the Earth. It becomes
a ‘little moon’.
Calculate the speed with which – in the absence of air resistance – the ‘little moon’ would
circle the Earth, and its corresponding orbital period.
If we assume that the height of the mountain is small compared with the radius of the
Earth, the radius of the orbit may be approximated by the radius of the Earth, 6370 km

say, and the centripetal acceleration will simply be the value of g at the Earth’s surface,
g = 9.8 m/s2. If v is the speed of the ‘moon’,
acceleration = “v2/r” =
v2
6370 × 1000 = g = 9.8 ,
so that v = 7901 m/s, with an orbital period of (2π × 6370 × 1000)/7901 = 5066 seconds,
or about 84 minutes.
A similar calculation applies to the orbits of artiﬁcial satellites, orbiting at around 250 km
above the Earth. Sometimes these are visible moving rapidly across the night sky, taking
7 or 8 minutes, if passing directly overhead, to traverse from one horizon to the other.
Example 11.6
Find the ratio of the mass of the Earth to the mass of the Sun.
Denote by Ms, Me and Mm the masses of the Sun, the Earth and the Moon, let Re, Ve

The language of vectors
A.1
Vectors
Vector quantities are those which have a direction as well as a magnitude. The word
literally means ‘carrier’, as in ‘vehicle’. Examples of vectors are velocity, acceleration,
or force, by contrast with mass or temperature which are ‘scalars’ having no sense of
direction involved in their deﬁnition.
We have of course, already been working with
these vector quantities, but pause now to re-express some of the same ideas in a vector
language which did not emerge until the nineteenth century, long after the time of Galileo
and Newton. The vector language says nothing fundamentally new, but it is does make
some of the more subtle ideas easier to express.
A.2
Displacement vectors and vector addition
The most fundamental vector is the displacement vector, a simple translation in space,
such as ‘take two steps to the right’. It has magnitude, ‘two’, and direction, ‘to the right’.
Let us give the vector ‘take two steps to the right’ a name, say a. (Traditionally, vectors,
in typescript, are written in bold, or, underlined if written by hand. i.e. a or a. Alterna-
tively, they may be written with an arrow above them ⃗a.) In the same way ‘take one step
forward’ is another vector, say b. ‘Take two steps to the right and one step forward’ is an
example of vector addition. We can say the combined instruction is a vector c = a + b
. When we come to represent this on a diagram there are several ways in which it can
be done. We can draw the vectors on the page in the order that they are given. Starting
at O, two steps to the right bring us to a point A. From A, one step forward takes us to
the ﬁnal position C.

Figure A.1: Left: a followed by b.
Center: b followed by a.
Right: The resultant
c = a + b.
Alternatively, we can draw the steps in the reverse order. Now we go ﬁrst one step forward
from O to say B, and then two steps to the right to the same ﬁnal position C. The vector
arrow corresponding to ‘take two steps to the right’ now starts from B, instead of O, and
‘take one step forward’ starts from O instead of A. But they are still the same vectors

The language of vectors
a and b. They have the same magnitude and the same direction as before. We are not
obliged to draw them anchored always to the same point.
A third diagram shows the arrows for the two instructions both starting at O. Here we
need to complete the rectangle OACB to ﬁnd the ﬁnal position C. All three diagrams
express the same idea – that the two separate instructions, when combined or ‘added’
together, have the same outcome as the single instruction ‘move diagonally, one step
forwards and two steps to the right’.
The same ideas apply when we add vector e to vector f when these are obliquely inclined,
rather than perpendicular. OEGF then becomes a parallellogram rather than a rectangle
and g = e + f.
O

G
Adding a to itself creates the vector 2a = a + a. This clearly has the same direction as
a but moves twice as far. −a, or −1 × a, similarly means the vector which has the same
magnitude as a, but is in the opposite direction, while 1
2a has the same direction, but
moves only half as far. Other multiples or combinations, such as a + 23
4b or 2a −3b also
have the obvious meaning.

Position vectors
Position vectors are vectors which are used to describe positions. The vector a is in itself a
pure movement, or displacement. But if we decide to relate it to a ﬁxed point of departure
O, a describes not just the movement but also the point, call it A, to which it brings
us. Diagram such as those of OACB or OEGF above then have a dual interpretation,
covering both the movements a, b, c etc. and the geometry of the positions A, B, C . . . .
At this point the student might reasonably ask what is the purpose of bringing in the
new terminology if the end result is only to arrive at geometry which we already know?
Is it only jargon? The answer seems to be that the language of vectors is much more
compact. For example, the point M with position vector 1
2a + 1
2b is the midpoint of
AB, and the point D with position vector 1
4a + 3
4b lies on AB and divides it in the ratio
AD : DB = 3 : 1. Saying “1
4a + 3
4b” is much shorter. This helps us express more subtle
or more complex statements and still keep the thread of the argument.
Example A.1
Show that if a and b are the position vectors of points A and B, the point with position
vector 1
2a + 1
2b is the midpoint of AB, and the point D with position vector 1
4a + 3
4b lies
on AB and divides it in the ratio AD : DB = 3 : 1.
First, we argue that if a takes us from O to A, and b takes us from O to B, then the
displacement vector x which would take us from A to B is (b −a). Going from O to A,
and then from A to B, is the same in the end as going straight from O to B. So
a + x = b ,
and x = b −a. Going half way from A to B arrives at M, with position vector m =
a + 1
2x = a + 1
2(b −a) =
1
2a + 1
2b, and going three quarters of the way at D, with
d = a + 3
4x = a + 3
4(b −a) = 1
4a + 3
4b.
Example A.2
The medians of a triangle ABC are the lines joining A to the mid-point of BC, B to
the midpoint of CA, C to the midpoint of AB. Show that the three medians meet at a
common point G, called the centroid, which divides each median in the ratio 2 : 1.
Suppose that the position vectors of A, B, C are a, b, c. We propose that the point G is
the point with position vector g = 1
3a + 1
3b + 1
3c and check that it satisﬁes the required
conditions.
If D is the mid-point of BC, its position vector is d = 1
2b + 1
2c. The vector y which takes
us from A to D, so that d = a + y, is y = d −a = 1

thirds of the way from A to D we arrive at a point with position vector

3y = a + 2
3(d −a)
= a + 2
3( 1
2b + 1
2c −a)
=
1
3a + 1
3b + 1
3c ,
which is our designated point G. G therefore lies on the median through A and divides it
in the required ratio 2 : 1, and by a similar argument G will lie on the medians through
B and C and divide them also in the same ratio.
The compactness of the vector notation means that the same type of argument applies in
three dimensions as well as in two. It would be equally easy to show that the medians of
a tetrahedron, joining corners to the centroids of the opposite faces, are also concurrent.
If the corners have position vectors a, b, c, d, the point where the medians intersect
turns out to be 1
4a + 1
4b + 1
4c + 1
4d.
A.4
Vectors for velocity, momentum, acceleration, force
When the simple movement or displacement described by a vector is interpreted as the
movement occurring within a given unit of time, we have a velocity vector. We are just
saying velocity = displacement/time, in two or three dimensions, in place of the formula
in one dimension, speed = distance/time.
Similarly, for momentum vectors. If v is a velocity vector, then, as seen above, we can
ascribe a meaning to 1
2v, or 3v, and so equally to mv, where m is a mass.
Again, just as velocity vectors may be deﬁned as changes in displacement vectors, within
a given unit of time, so acceleration vectors are deﬁned as changes in velocity vectors,
per given unit of time. And if acceleration a is a vector, so also is force F, deﬁned as ma.
Example A.3
Ferryman F takes a passenger across a river 100 m wide. F can row at 1 m/s through the
water and the river ﬂows at a speed of 0.5 m/s. Calculate the time taken to reach the
point directly opposite on the other bank.

The language of vectors
To travel directly across the river, F must aim upstream. In a vector diagram, we combine,
tip to tail, arrows representing the river ﬂow and F’s motion through the water, and ﬁnd
the actual velocity relative to the river bank as their vector sum. If F’s destination is
directly across the river, we know that the actual velocity must be perpendicular to the
river ﬂow, and so can use Pythagoras’ theorem to calculate his speed relative to the
bank as

(12 −0.52) =
√
3/2 = 0.866 m/s. The time taken to cover the 100 m width is
100/0.866 = 115 seconds.
It is fundamental to calculations like this that the Pythagoras’ theorem and all the other
rules of geometry remain valid when applied to displacement vectors, velocity vectors or
force vectors etc. We in fact know this to be so because of the direct correspondence
between displacement vectors and position vectors, which considered as ordinary locations
necessarily follow standard geometry.

Example A.4
Mr E is at sea, making for an island 2 km to the west. In still conditions, he can row at
3 km/hr, but because his boat drifts in the strong north-westerly breeze it deviates from
his chosen course to the extent of an additional velocity of 2 km/hr towards the south
east. How long will he take to reach the island?

The method of solution is just the same as for the ferryman in Example A.3 but the
vector diagram for the velocities is a little more complicated in that it has no right angle.
We have to use the cosine rule rather than Pythagoras’ theorem. If Mr E’s actual speed,
relative to the island, is v, the cosine rule gives 32 = 22 + v2 −(2 × 2 × v cos(135◦)). With
cos(135◦) = −cos(45◦) = −1/
√
2, we ﬁnd a quadratic equation for v, v2 + 2
√
2v −5 = 0,
with relevant solution v = 1.23 km/hr. The time take to reach the island is 2/1.23 =
1.62 hours, or 1 hour 37 minutes.
Example A.5
A kite of mass 0.5 kg is attached to a ﬁxed point on the ground by a string and kept
airborne by a lift force of 20 newtons from the wind. If the lift force is inclined at an
angle of 30◦to the vertical, what is the tension in the string?
We investigated a similar kite calculation in Chapter 5 and now look again from the
vector point of view. If the kite is in equilibrium, the three forces acting on it – its
weight, the lift force and the tension in the string T – sum to zero. The vector arrows
placed nose to tail in a vector diagram must form a closed triangle, or “triangle of forces”.
See Figure A.2.
A practical tip in sketching the triangle is to put in the known forces ﬁrst. Here, we
started with the vector arrow for the weight, and then adjoined the arrow for the lift
force. Then the tension force necessarily has to complete the triangle. The magnitude of

the tension can be calculated using the cosine rule
T 2 = 4.92 + 202 −(2 × 4.9 × 20 cos(30◦)) ,
so that T = 15.9 newtons.
One may be tempted to ask where the kite is in the force diagram. The answer is that
it is not there at all. The diagram is not a picture of the physical set-up but a diagram
purely of the force vectors that act on the kite.

Momentum, in an oblique collision, is conserved both along the original line of motion

which expresses Pythagorass theorem for the triangle of velocity vectors. Here, u, vA and
vB are the magnitudes of their respective velocity vectors. vA and vB, the velocities of
balls A and B after impact, are therefore at right angles, giving visible expression to the
principle of the conservation of energy.
A.5
Unit vectors
For practical calculations, it is often convenient to express vectors in terms of components
along co-ordinate axes. If i is a vector of unit length directed along the x-axis, and j a
vector of unit length along the y-axis, then r = ai + bj represents the displacement from
the origin to (a, b), or equally the position vector (a, b). Velocity, acceleration or force
vectors can similarly be expressed, so that for example v = ci + dj represents a velocity
whose components along the x- and y-axes are c m/s and d m/s respectively.

(702 + 2402) = 250 metres. At a speed of 10 m/s, the crow will cover this distance
in 25 seconds.
The velocity vector is v = displacement/time = (70i + 240j)/25 =
2.8i+9.6j m/s, and the bearing is the angle θ in the diagram, θ = arctan(70/240) = 16.3◦.

At noon, the yacht in Example A.7 moves oﬀwith velocity vector 2i+j km/hr. Calculate
(a) the time at which it will be due north of O, (b) the distance OY at its closest approach
to O, and (c) the time at which this closest approach occurs.
With both the initial position and the velocity speciﬁed in terms of unit vectors, the
information can be combined into a single equation for the position vector rY at time t
hours after noon. This is
rY = (−8 + 2t)i + (6 + t)j .
The yacht will be due north of O when the coeﬃcient of i in the equation for rY is zero.
This occurs when (−8 + 2t) = 0, t = 4, that is at 4 pm.
The distance OY, according again to Pythagoras, satisﬁes
OY2 = (−8 + 2t)2 + (6 + t)2 = 100 −20t + 5t2 .
Separating out the perfect square,
OY2 = 100 −20t + 5t2 = 80 + 5(4 −4t + t2) = 80 + 5(t −2)2 .
OY will be smallest when OY2 is smallest, and since the square term can never be less
than zero, this will be when OY2 = 80. The minimum distance is therefore OY =
√
80 =
8.9 km, which occurs when t = 2, i.e. at 2 pm.
The alternative method to ﬁnd the minimum value of OY2, for those who prefer calculus,
is to equate the diﬀerential d(OY2)
dt
to zero, giving −20 + 10t = 0, or t = 2. Then check

that the second diﬀerential is positive (so that we have a minimum value rather than a
maximum) and substitute t = 2 back into the expression for OY2 = 100 −20t + 5t2 =
100 −(20 × 2) + (5 × 22) = 80. OY =

80 = 8.9 km, as before.
Example A.10
A ball, travelling horizontally at 7 m/s, rolls over the edge of a cliﬀ. Relative to an origin
on the edge of the cliﬀ, what will its position vector be 2 seconds later? What will its
velocity vector be?
This is an example from Chapter 2, now expressed in vector form. In Chapter 2 the
solution depends on separate calculations for horizontal and vertical motion, using the
constant acceleration formulæ. Here, we use the same formulæ but in vector form, using
the i, j format to distinguish between horizontal and vertical. To ﬁnd the position of the
ball, we use the vector form of s = ut+ 1
2at2, with initial velocity u = 7i and acceleration
a = −9.8j. With t = 2,

Example A.11
Snooker ball A with mass 0.15 kg and velocity vector 0.35i m/s, strikes a glancing blow
on an identical stationary ball B. After the impact, ball B is observed to have velocity
vector 0.15i −0.15j (in m/s). Use the law of conservation of momentum, in vector form,
to ﬁnd the new velocity vector of ball A. What are the speeds of A and B after the
collision? What is the angle between their directions of motion? What proportion of the
initial kinetic energy is lost in the collision?
The vector form of the law of conservation of momentum
muA + muB = mvA + mvB ,
(A.1)
here takes the form
(0.15 × 0.35i) + (0.15 × 0) = (0.15 × (xi + yj)) + (0.15 × (0.15i −0.15j)) ,
where 0 = 0i + 0j stands for the zero vector. Equating coeﬃcients of i and j, we ﬁnd x =
0.2, y = 0.15, so the velocity vector for ball A after the collision is 0.2i+0.15j m/s and its
speed is

(0.22 + 0.152) = 0.25 m/s. Its velocity now makes an angle arctan(0.15/0.2) =
36.9◦with its original direction of motion, parallel to the unit vector i.
B has speed

(0.152 + 0.152) = 0.212 m/s and moves oﬀat an angle of arctan(0.15/0.15) =
45◦so that the angle between the directions of motion of A and B is 36.9◦+ 45◦= 81.9◦.
The initial kinetic energy of ball A is 1
2mu2 = 1
2 × 0.15 × 0.352 = 0.00919 J. After the
collision, the kinetic energy of A is 1
2 × 0.15 × 0.252 = 0.00469 J and the kinetic energy
of B is 1
2 × 0.15 × (0.152 + 0.152) = 0.00338 J, making a total of 0.00806 J. The loss of
energy is 0.00113 J, 12.2% of the initial total.
Example A.12
Mr C playing cricket, despatches a ball back over the bowler’s head with velocity 18i +
18j m/s, where i is a unit vector directed horizontally, along the line of the wickets, and
j is a unit vector in the vertical direction. The ball was bowled with velocity −40i and
just clears the boundary 65 metres away. Given that the ball has mass 0.16 kg, calculate
(a) the magnitude of the impulse imparted to the ball and (b) the impulse required if
instead the ball clears the boundary (also 65 metres distant) over square leg? For those
not familiar with the ﬁelding positions of cricket, square leg lies along the line of the
stumps being defended by the batsman, perpendicular to the line of the pitch.
(a) Here, we apply the deﬁnition of impulse in its vector form, I = mv−mu. With initial
velocity u = −40i, and ﬁnal velocity v = 18i + 18j, the impulse is I = 0.16(58i + 18j),

is 18j+18k and the impulse I = mv−mu is I = 0.16(40i+18j+18k). Applying Pythago-
